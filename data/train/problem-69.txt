John tugged his arm until he laid back down, pushing his face into John's neck. John didn't like that Sherlock put up his guard so easily. He wished they would get past…whatever this was.
"You're…" He sighed, "You're something else. You're separate. God, John, why do I have to spell it out for you?"
“Exactly,” John rolled his eyes again, “If you’re just gonna insult me on my clothes, let me pack instead.”
He looked down, just for a flash of a moment, "Yes," he replied, his voice still soft, his eyes still dripping with empathy. He tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair, the now not empty chair, the now full chair with the person that should be sitting in the chair, "And because I would have to come back eventually. Mycroft wanted to wait. I didn't, neither did Greg, so... I came back." His words were almost tripping over each other. I was sure with a good wine and a few hours he would tell me all of the details anyway. I was sure this was him simply trying to be formal.
Sherlock fell back next to him and John could feel his legs right next to his but not touching. Sherlock's feet almost touched the ground. Maybe his bed was too short. Maybe John was too short.
"You know, when I was your age I was dealing with some rough things. A girl had just broken up with me, my pa had just gone into the hospital, and I wasn't feeling all that great. So, I just wanna ask, how're you, John?"
"For the slim chance of not having to hide? For the slim chance of being just another couple, overlooking the fact that we could break up at any point? Overlooking the fact that we won't be normal no matter where we go, John."
Sherlock stood straight, "You say that, but what's been hurt so far?" He cocked his head, "Really, you have nothing to lose at this point."
Sherlock didn’t deserve this. That was the only thing going through his head on the way back to John’s house. He said he was going to get some of his stuff and break up with Mary, but Sherlock was on the fence that he would actually do it.
He didn't know what about this moment made him remember, but he thought about the dare. Surely, it wasn't important now, but John still wanted to tell him.
Sherlock chuckled, pushed John's shirt up higher and whispered against his skin, "Take this off for me."
, I don't." Sherlock titled his head, an innocent smiling playing on his lips, "Thought you would realize that by now."
John’s eyes were closed long after it ended, his mouth partly open. It took everything not to kiss him again.
By the time Molly stopped asking questions the bell had rung, leaving them to run off to their class with John looking over his shoulder the whole way there.
John kept his gaze, "But everyone deserves to feel like they belong. Like they're worth something." He squeezed Sherlock's hand, "Especially you."
John snorted, "Don't flatter yourself." He forced his feet to step forward, towards the car, and towards hell in the process. Funny, he felt like he'd been here before.
"No. Why should I? So Mycroft can lecture me some more? So you can watch my every move? So I can go through this all again in four, five, six months? Why? Why should I go back?"
He dug around the sheets for his boxers, before taking the shirt Sherlock has most certainly gotten from the ground. John rolled his eyes again, but took it, just a bit glad that it smelled like smoke like the rest of Sherlock.
"I wouldn't call this within reason." Sherlock said, very aware of the space (or lack thereof) between them.
"I'm fine, Dad." He said simply, because for the most part, he was. He had accepted his situation a long time ago, and he could be doing a lot worse.
He definitely wasn’t his. Never would be his. Sherlock didn’t even want him to be his. That’s not how these things worked out.
He did like having Sherlock here, no doubt, and it had to be somewhat bad if Sherlock didn’t go to school. Or he could've just completely ditched (that's what everyone else thought anyway).
“No. You’re potentially the best thing I’ve ever gone after.” John said, that sly smirk emerging again.
Sherlock's eyes flung open soon after that. They dashed around the ceiling before landing on John and relaxing. John didn't know whether to smile at or kiss Sherlock.
He could feel a smirk forming. He quickly looked down, busying himself with the blanket on top of him. He had no idea who Sherlock was, meaning he could be whoever he wanted to be.
"I won't bite." John said, a slight grin on his face. He looked tired, his hair messy, his eyes heavy. Sherlock almost felt bad for leaving. Almost.
On Monday he didn't even wait for Sherlock to find him. He scanned the crowd for him the moment he was able to, completely overlooking Molly, who made up for it by hitting him on the shoulder with a book.
“What, Sh-” Sherlock put a hand over John’s mouth. John’s eyes were wide. Sherlock’s were cool and collected. John was sure he was blushing. (Himself, not Sherlock. Sherlock never blushes.)(Though, now he was wondering what it would take to get Sherlock to blush.)
John was- something else. John was everything Sherlock thought didn't actually exist in a person. He bought Sherlock clothes when he saw his was worn, he lent him his coat when it was cold outside, he laughed when Sherlock got snow in his hair. He was... Not Sherlock's.
He sat by his phone (Pale blue, rotary, stuck there since it first landed on his bedside table.) thinking of everything he wanted to say and how hard it would be to actually say it.
"Mycroft, probably, so we'll have to be quiet." He reached for John's hand, and pulled him upstairs as soon as he had it. John was then dragged down a hallway and into a room. It looked like a normal teenager room that someone then smashed with a bat.
He looked around the room as he thought of the answer, probably looking for evidence that I was broken, "I can't tell you that."
"I don't think of you as others, cause you're not like them, John. You never were. You're so different from everyone I've encountered that I can't believe that I have to explain this."
They were on the road with as much food as John would let them take and two bags, a suitcase, and a box of books in the backseat. John couldn’t stop smiling.
"I know I'm not close. I know I don't know you, but I'm not going anywhere, yeah? I've got a job to do, and that means making sure you're alirght. So... Are you alright. Sherlock?"
"There's nothing to let go of, Sherlock." He pushed him off "It was one goddamn day. A week ago, I might add."
“Jesus H. Christ, Sherlock.” John sighed, letting his fingers slide into Sherlock’s hair and pulling him back in.
He almost laughed at that. He hated the sticky heat, but enjoyed the attached humidity, just like hating everything that came with being Sherlock, except Sherlock himself.
Instead, he reached for Sherlock's hand. It wasn't that far apart to begin with, so all it took was one small movement and his hand was in John's.
Sherlock was smiling wide, trying to keep up with John, but soon giving up in favor of letting him do what he wanted. John eventually got to Sherlock's neck, trying to mark him the way he did to John, but not really knowing if he was doing it right.
"If I was the one who jumped, if you had to watch, if I came back and claimed I was doing it to protect you, how would you react?"
John's head sprung up. He turned slightly, and out of the corner of his eye saw a small movement. He rolled over and pulled himself up into a sitting position.
John thought about it for a moment, "I like you because…God, you're brilliant. You're interesting, and I feel this need to spend more time with you. I like you because there's always more that I don't know, and a day with you feels like an eternity, and a day without you feels like too much. You…I don't know how to even put you into words, Sherlock. I love you."
John paused. He looked tired, bags under his eyes and his twitchy fingers. He looked tired. I wanted to take him into my room and hold him so tight, tight enough to keep all of his pieces together because it looked like he was about to fall apart. At the same time, I wanted to kick him out, tell him to go get a hotel and piss off. I suppose I found balance in doing neither.
He turned the knob, gently opened the door, and stepped in, not bothering to close the door behind him.
John couldn't walk two feet without stares or whispered questions for the entire day. He had a headache since his first class, and his eyes stung beyond belief. He gave up trying to pay attention in classes and just hoped that he looked awake.
i think this might be one of the last chapters. i’ll write 1-2 more maybe to wrap everything up but,, i think i’m mostly done with it. i love these boys so much, and i love everyone who’s taken the time to read this. i feel like every fic i write makes me seem john and sherlock in a different way, and it makes me so happy uncovering more about their character with every chapter. it’s not quite done yet, but it will be soon.
John laid his hands flat over Sherlock’s hand over his mouth to tell him it was alright. Sherlock let his hand drop, but not very far.
In the brief moments that Sherlock was quiet, John wasn't even annoyed at how much Sherlock had been talking. Actually, it felt kind of nice to have someone ask him all that, because Sherlock was actually interested (or at least it seemed) in John's answers.
I sat in my chair, staring at the one opposite me. I sat, and the sun went down, and I couldn't find the energy to get up. I didn’t want to move or breathe or acknowledge that this space was real. When I met John— A long time ago, almost a forever ago— I swore I wouldn’t get attached. I never get attached, but now here I was. John was gone and I… His chair was empty. And he wasn’t coming back.
"I think…" He looked up at John's ceiling, "I think I test people's patience-" John snorted. Sherlock glared at him, "I think people would much rather choose something easier." He sat back on the bed.
John's dad clicked his tongue and shook his head, "He ran away with some boy. Turns out he might be a fag." He  gave John a glance from over his shoulder, "Family's torn apart. It's real selfish what he did, don't you think?"
Silence buzzed around both of them, and when John looked up Sherlock's eyebrows were knitted together slightly, just enough to make a small wrinkle. John looked back down.
"Apparently, you do." He went to walk out the room, "He's all yours." He said to someone outside the door.
Sherlock's long fingers made their way to John's chin, it shot electricity down John's spine all the way to the tips of his fingers. It caught John off guard, but then again, Sherlock always did.
"So what?" He shouted, throwing his hands in the air, "So what if I'm being dramatic, John? Not everyone wants to be as boring as you."
John tried not to smile too much, or too little. He was able to keep conversation and note of Sherlock's expressions through the entire meal. He got really good at noticing both the shifts in the planes of his face, and what they meant.
John blinked, then couldn't come up with a reason not to. He sat up, Sherlock rolling off to the side, and pulled his shirt over his head.
As Mycroft walked out, in walked a blonde-haired, blue eyed man, shorter than Sherlock, broader than Sherlock. His lips were pinched with anxiety, and his fingers fidgeted at his sides.
Could he kiss him freely now that they had kissed once? Or did you have to kiss a certain amount of times before that happened? Would they kiss again? Would John even want to look at Sherlock anymore?
Sherlock didn’t want to forget this, this moment of perfect joy, this moment where both of them were untouchable.
Sherlock spun his phone in the hand absentmindedly. Finn was across him, tourniquet wrapped around her arm.
"Stop saying that," I said calmly. All of my energy stores had been burnt, my chest almost burning from the effort to keep my ribs intact.
John sighed. Sherlock looked at him. Sherlock’s eyes were focused on John’s, close to curious. They made tiny movements around John's face, darting from feature to feature.
Sherlock wanted to lean forward and kiss them, but he didn’t know if that was something he could do.
Well, except the morphine he convinced the nurse to give him, but that hadn't lasted long once Mycroft had found him.
He watched as John’s eyes fluttered open and landed on his face. He watched as John’s lips slowly curved into a smile, skin tinted the color of the sun. He reached out a hand and ran his finger down John’s cheek, skin brushing skin, rose-dawn hugging them both close.
"Leaving." She stated before slipping out the door and shutting it behind her. John frowned and looked out the peep hole, seeing an equally dressed up brunette meet Harry at the door, beaming brighter than the sun.
Really it was easy, just one word, one syllable, three letters, and John would have him. He could take all he wanted from Sherlock if he stayed long enough, he could destroy him if he had the will. He could crush everything that was and is Sherlock Holmes with the right word, the right phrase, or the right body language.
When John got back to school he felt like he was keeping a secret. Like every mark under his clothes and every word Sherlock whispered in his ear was another one he was forced to hide. It was almost a relief coming home to an empty house, where no one would ask questions about where he had been.
John opened the door and the bed was empty, but off near the closet, clothes were off hangers and strewn about the floor.
Sherlock laughed, something high and careless, nothing like John had heard from him before. Sherlock's laughs had always been low and quiet, like Sherlock himself. They made John feel warm, but this one grabbed onto his heart and tugged. It made him smile back.
THIS WAS SO RUSHED IM SO SORRY. I FREAKED OUT A BIT CAUSE I WANTED TO PUT IT OUT TODAY BUT HADN'T WORKED ON IT THAT MUCH. I HOPE ITS OKAY.
"Hmm?" John asked, not able to keep his eyes from wandering the room. It was the exact opposite from the living room just a few feet away, and had Sherlock written all over it.
"Mm, yes." He moved just a microscopic amount closer, hitting just the right angle for the setting sun to hit the top of his curls and dance in his eyes.
John walked into school next Monday, confident he was done with Sherlock, over it. Until Sherlock decided he wasn't done with him.
John pulled him along into his bedroom, where Sherlock pushed him back onto the bed and threw his jacket over a chair.
Was it even a relationship? Sherlock had taken him out to dinner, it had to be something. John just wished Sherlock was there. Not that he would have the guts to ask him about all this, but Sherlock would find a way to make him feel better about it without John mentioning it.
John chuckled softly, "Yes. Here. Because if I let you off now, you'll find a way to get me to let you off forever."
. Sherlock not liking girls. Sherlock liking boys instead. It had to be hypothetical, because they both knew- everyone knew- you don't
Molly tapped him on the shoulder, squeals passing her lips, “John! John!” she said in an urgent whisper. Blue and ash was all John saw at first, stomping towards him with all the grace of a charging bull, all rock and roll and...something John couldn't place.
He tried stepping towards the door, but he couldn’t get the steps right. He turned and John was already next to him, holding out his arms. Why couldn’t he see how fucked up this was, how hurtful this was. How was he okay with this? How was he okay with being here even after all this?
He tells him of dark corners and skulking, of perfecting the art of invisibility. The thrill of disappearing into a crowd, becoming a nonentity, the proverbial fly on the wall. The transformation from man to homing device. How he’d learned to write someone’s story with just a look.
It doesn't make a lick of sense. The answer had been a simple yes or no. But there must be a method to the madness, even if Sherlock cannot parse it. And he likes that he can’t parse it, likes to see John being enigmatic, for whatever reason, but he also hates it.
Sherlock circles his hips, grinding on John’s cock, and moves his legs down, hooking his ankles behind John’s thighs and digging in. “Oh, I
Earlier this week, John, Rosie, and Mrs Hudson had stopped by to help decorate the tree and, since then, Mrs Hudson has been a fixture of the sitting room, turning up like clockwork to add more tinsel, fairy lights, ribbons, twee figurines, etcetera.
John’s been speaking. Sherlock’s not heard a single word that came before, but what he’s heard is not a question, at least.
. So, after the dance lesson, John had decided not to dwell on the concerning congeries of emotions it had inspired. It’d ended, he’d got married, and everyone had moved on.
In a rare display of emotion, Mycroft gives Sherlock a solemn, meaningful nod. It might as well have been an embrace. But the moment is gone as quickly as it had come, Mycroft pulling the officiant aside to tie up loose ends, finalise some business or other.
“Like I said,” John says, leaning back into Sherlock’s chest, a hand coming to rest atop Sherlock’s interlocked arms around his waist. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“Christ, Sherlock,” John says in a hissed aside. “C’mere, darling. The flowers will be okay, c’mere.”
Sherlock sighs, pressing his forehead to the ice-cold glass of the window. “It was performative. There was no love lost between Mummy and Mémé.”
“Guess it was worth it, in the end,” John says when Sherlock’s finished. “All of that misery led them to each other.”
Greg's become a human ball of unease. "You boys need my help? With--or, I can just--" He jabs a vague thumb over his shoulder.
Sherlock’s lips quirk up. “Thank you, Watson. When you present it so enticingly like that, how could I possibly refuse?”
“I know,” Greg says mournfully. “It’s pissing bleak. I'm never going to find anyone else like her. Just--never."
As John watches Sherlock place a hand on his hip and snake his body, he says, drily, “I’m starting to think that won’t be a problem.”
“Holmes, I am—I am rather worried if the RA worsens that you will be unable to perform any tasks at all.” Holmes was shaking his head, scoffing, dismissive of my statement, but I soldiered on, sat up straight and rounded my shoulders. “I propose to become your personal physician."
“Christ's sake,” Janine throws in. John’s stricken silent, turns slowly to Janine, his ire palpable. “God love you, John, but you’re being a bit thick.”
The Thorn and Thistle is as quintessentially old-man-pub and meat-and-potatoes as Sherlock remembers, largely unchanged since the ‘90s, though the average clientele’s age still seems to be somewhere upwards of fifty.
“I’d be lying if I said it’d been the drink talking,” John says, and Sherlock is rapt. He doesn’t want to move, lest he shatter the moment. It’s such a rare bird, this, when John divulges something personal. “I was lonely and I wanted to be with someone.”
“I will always be your stalwart friend, but I would whole-heartedly embrace any enhancement to that friendship, however unspeakable, that you should accept.”
Our stalwart armchairs pushed aside, Holmes and I sat on the bearskin hearthrug, he with his long legs outstretched toward the fire, hands propping up from behind, and I in Indian-style. At such a close proximity, I could smell shag tobacco on Holmes’s clothes and lavender on his skin.
But John just giggles harder, and he kisses Sherlock, and then they’re both laughing against each others’s lips.
The external presentation of a disguise is important, of course, but even more important is one's behaviour: John needs to appear to be attracted to Starr. It isn't
On coltish legs, Sherlock manages to stand up and take a few steps forward, but another wave was hot on the heels of the previous one--it shoves Sherlock forward with brute force and he bowls headfirst into John.
“Hi there, Rosie.” Hafiz puts a hand on his hip and leans over, speaking in the fake, jovial tone adults often use with children, “What a pretty name for a pretty girl.”
He releases the gift tucked between his hip and the arm of the chair and looks up and over. John is looking down at him with vague amusement--and with something else. Fondness, perhaps.
“And if we were to put that tradition into practice, I think,” I said, forgetting myself and sweeping my gaze along his body, “we would need not search far and wide for a handsome, tall, dark-haired man.”
about her, so enwrapped in the dancing and Sherlock and--well, Sherlock, mainly, but also this godforsaken raging boner. Almost as if he’s some kind of one-track mind neanderthal.
Days later, back at 221b, Sherlock noisily throws himself into his armchair and sinks low, legs inelegantly splayed. He waits, but his theatrics do nothing to garner John’s attention, so he tries on a drawn-out sigh.
, I’m sorry,” John says frantically, pulling out of Sherlock’s mouth. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, got a bit too--are you--”
John pulls off, his lips sheeny with saliva, and says with pleased-as-punch self-satisfaction, “Didn’t I already say that?”
Sherlock feels as if this budding thing between him and John is too precious to be shown to the world.
The sketches that lie within are still in pristine condition, and he thumbs through them: a stray dog nosing around rubbish near a busy Parisian cafe, a street performer and his cello near the banks of the Seine, a self-portrait of an unsmiling Mémé (which makes Sherlock smile), pipe drooping out of the corner of her mouth. He pauses on the last sketch of a well-muscled young man (a day laborer with a penchant for ballet, Sherlock had deduced, due to his various scars and his specific musculature), draped in nothing more than a sheer shawl, the fabric wrapped like liquid around the distinctive planes and angles of his body. One of the few men who’d run in Mémé’s ragtag circles, no doubt. Sherlock had looked at this piece often to challenge himself to deduce a subject seen through another’s eyes. Mémé was perceptive, and she’d captured the man well. Sherlock had even told her as much.
The three of them join Sherlock and spread out in a circle, Greg greeting Sherlock with an rough elbow to his arm, which Sherlock does not look pleased about, and John reluctantly bounces his shoulders and shifts his weight from foot to foot in time to--whatever the hell this
As Sherlock settles into the driver’s seat, he becomes aware that his father’s Peugeot has seen better days.
Mrs Hudson flicks her eyes from John, to John’s towel, then to Sherlock before her lips stretch into a smug, knowing smile. “Is that what they’re calling it these days?”
Sherlock drags his chair around the table and places it down next to John, plops into it, and leans into John’s personal space. “Interesting.”
When we at last parted to breathe, Holmes got to his knees and swept aside his dressing-gown to throw a leg over my lap and sit astride me. I fell to my back and brought him down with me and we continued to kiss--open-mouthed and hungry. For a moment, he hovered above me on all fours, and I reached up to frame his angular, intelligent face as he looked down at me with shining eyes and kiss-swollen lips.
“I can barely remember most of them,” John says after a while. “And, you know, you can be lonely even when you’re with someone. I felt that way with most of the women I dated.”
Holmes, surprisingly, relented without fuss and I deftly undid the buttons, helped remove his shirt by pulling it over his head, then undid the tie of his trousers, allowed him to lean on me in order to step out of the trouser legs. Holmes did not look at me once nor speak throughout this process, hugging himself protectively when he was stripped nearly bare, opting to stare forlornly outside the bedroom window.
John climbs over Sherlock and lies down so they’re face to face, kisses the petulant moue off Sherlock’s lips. “I’m sorry. Didn’t mean to be flippant. I’m just not good at this sort of stuff. That was--beautiful, really. I don’t know what to say to match it, but, for the record: I feel the same. I really,
“How’s your--,” John bites off as Sherlock encircles his cock and slides his fist over his length, “--thigh?”
“Yeah, well--yeah. Because she was gorgeous and she knew it. But she’s also a criminal--bit of a turn off, that--and about 20 years younger than me.” John runs his fingers up Sherlock’s hand, the one paused at his belt, then up his forearm. “And, most importantly,
“You’ve just said I look the same age as someone who’s 8 years older than me,” John says grumpily. “Not really seeing the compliment.”
Sherlock doesn’t turn to look at John, fearful that he’ll see something akin to horror on John’s face.
been able to figure out what Sherlock wants when it comes to the more tender qualities of life. Or if he wants to acknowledge and indulge in
Later, they repair to the den and engage in assorted conversation that mercifully does not pertain to Sherlock, his childhood, or the type of men for which he has a predilection.
“O-kay,” John says cautiously. “While this philosophical discussion is happening, I’m going to pour one out to celebrate the fact that I’ve just dodged a kiss with Mycroft.”
Danny and Rosie exchange murmured hellos before Danny quickly returns to the sanctuary of his father’s leg.
When Mrs Hudson announced me and I stepped into the old sitting room, I understood her implication immediately.
Later in the day, Sherlock plays "Happy Birthday" on the violin (lyrical accompaniment of the drunken-sailor-on-shore-leave-at-a-pub variety courtesy of everyone else) for Rosie, who is beside herself as she claps along and giggles.
The paparazzo is unmoved. “I’ll just ask it anyway, since we’re all here, and be on my way: Is it true you cheated on your wife with Sherlock Holmes?”
He’d almost forgotten what sex could be like: an alternative to drugs, indeed. Calmative, mind-hushing.
John is naked and lying on his back, head propped up by pillows, feet flat on the duvet, legs akimbo. Cock erect and waiting. Sherlock is between his legs, a smirking, wonderful creature. He’d reapplied his lipstick, so the colour is brighter, a more alarming pink, and layered it with a gloss. It looks pristine. Untouched.
"Yes, yes, one of the few left in the world, expensive and delicate and all that. I am well aware, you have told me more times than I can count. And I am handling it perfectly well, thank you," I said, irritated. I began to tune the instrument, Holmes scolding me with every wrong turn of the pegs. Once Holmes was satisfied, the violin in tune, the bow rosined, I positioned my chin on the chin-rest, awkwardly held the violin and rested the bow on a string.
“That won’t be necessary," Holmes interrupted sharply. "I have already acquired aspirin, attempted the Gold treatment, and examined and researched to the best of my ability any other possible medicinal cures but I am, as you have remarked upon in your chronicle of our first case together—what was the fanciful title you gave it?
“Hm, interesting, weaponising your birthday,” John says, sounding very amused. “After eight years of not acknowledging that you have a birthday. Surprised you haven’t tried it on me before.”
do it. So he does it, lightning quick: he presses his index and middle fingers to his lips, makes an idiotic kissing sound only he can hear, and sends it off Sherlock’s way.
The cool water on his clammy skin is glorious, and he lets out a grateful sigh, his eyes lazily traveling across the room and hitting on a bar of soap on the sink. He glances at the bathtub’s soap holder. It’s empty.
“Sure,” Janine says askance. She flips her hair over her shoulder, gives the hem of her shirt a tug so her décolletage is more strategically visible, and stands up, looking every bit fierce and determined. “Anyway. Wasn’t planning on getting a leg over at my dead mate’s daughter’s second birthday party, but these are desperate times. I’m going in.”
He traces John’s jawline with his tongue until he’s at the base of John’s ear, teeth nipping the lobe and purring, “I can’t wait for you to fuck me.”
“Come to think of it,” Mummy contemplates John, “you rather like yourself a bit of rough,” looks at Sherlock, “don’t you, darling?”
“Just a hunch,” John says with a tiny smile that Sherlock finds himself mirroring. A nod at the sketches in Sherlock’s hands. “Are those yours?”
John squeezes a dollop of sun cream into his hand. “What d’you think, genius? Put your head back down.”
“What do you think?” Mrs Hudson is asking, pulling him away from his bitter ruminations. She sweeps her arm to indicate the mantle, where facsimiles of quirky Victorian era-illustrated Christmas cards are lined up in a neat row.
Sherlock wonders if there’s more they can do. If Sherlock were to seek more comfort, John would hardly turn him away at this juncture.
Unfortunately, the RA had become worse in the first few months I had moved into the villa; I had been tending to him carefully but it had amounted to nothing.
John calls over the bartender to order a water for Sherlock and a local brew on draught for himself just as a twangy guitar solo permeates through the speakers. An old man fingering an air guitar and his dance partner, a washed out blonde woman cheering on his unimpressive panto, take the centrestage of the dance floor, garnering the attention of several sets of judgmental eyes.
“An understatement,” Sherlock says, clenching his arsehole around John’s cock experimentally, causing both of them to moan.
And just like that, Sherlock feels as if a great, hulking weight has been lifted from his shoulders--feels light enough to float above all earthly things.
Slipping from my grip, leaving me bereft, Holmes moved to retrieve the kettle, but I stopped him, placing a hand lightly on his back. “Allow me,” I said softly.
It is imperative that Sherlock gets fucked in this very moment, so he rolls over to grab the lube off the sidetable, but before he can roll back, John reaches out and enfolds Sherlock in his arms, pulling Sherlock’s back to his chest.
I was astounded by his nonchalance. “This is a serious affliction, Holmes! I must acquire some aspirin--"
“I mean, they weren’t as exciting as the monkey one. That old man was fucking mental. All that bosh about a ‘life serum’--”
they’d drawn each other's names in the exchange. (Sherlock had been reasonably certain, at one point, that other people existed. But perhaps he’d been mistaken.)
“Because you’re you. But I’m me. Clearly you’re interested in men in some permutation of non-heterosexuality. The real enigma is how
Sherlock’s grounding shifts beneath his feet. He has to sit down. He does, on the edge of his bed, and stares at the wall across, mind whirring in attempt to process this new information. How could he have missed it? It'd been the final piece of the puzzle that is John Watson.
Sherlock has done and will continue to do whatever it takes to make John’s life the best it can be, because John deserves nothing but the best. John saying that Sherlock had changed his life for the better--it’s validating. If Sherlock were to never see John again after today, he could at least find solace in the fact that he’d somehow managed to pull off granting John a modicum of peace.
“The club, to be precise, is in on it. They would want to make sure their most valuable customer remains in one piece; they were watching her and, in turn, you. She’s been using the pilfered credit cards to buy a staggering amount of alcohol by the bottle from the club.
Once he’s naked (freed) from the waist down, John collapses back onto the seat and strokes himself with great urgency--but that won’t do. Sherlock wants to
He shifts his eyes to Sherlock, who cuts a dash in black trousers and a salmon-pink button-down clinging to his lean chest. Rhapsodic with the music, he’s moving his body in alarmingly lithe ways that has John transfixed. It’s fascinating to witness Sherlock like this, so untethered and loose, nothing like the buttoned-up, imperious character Sherlock assumes in day-to-day. For a man who purports to use his body for transport only, he seems fluent in the artistry of movement. John has never, not once, seen him ooze this kind of confident sensuality. It's not new, however, that Sherlock is entirely unselfconscious as the last man standing, quite literally, amidst a sea of women on a hen do bender, being watched by an audience of judgmental eyes, dancing suggestively to
While the tub fills, John disrobes, and when the water’s high enough, he leans his knee on the edge of the tub and presses down his weight so he can haul his good foot over the edge. He anchors his hands down on the side of the tub and lowers himself onto his arse.
John ignores him, stepping inside and sweeping his eyes over the room until he lands on the Locard statuette. “Who’s the bloke with the moustache?”
I ignored his sardonicism yet again. With confidence, I dragged the bow down the string, emitting a strident sound. My shoulders slumped, dejected. “It would appear I remember absolutely nothing.”
“No need to thank me; in fact, I should thank you. While, nominally, this is my home, it’s been less of one while you’ve been gone.”
John opens his eyes and finds Sherlock bending at the waist, pressing back into John’s groin and moving with a gorgeous rotation, pestling John into the wall.
Sherlock flops back onto the bed, pouting. “Have people nothing else going on in their sad little lives and sad little minds? Why do they care so much?”
“It’s literally the only rule. You go under it, you swap spit. So. Go on.” Wiggins sniffs. “But before you make your decision you should have all the facts.” Sherlock is just on the verge of throttling him when he finishes with a dead-eyed, “I’ve always thought you were a dishy geezer.”
Sherlock gestures helplessly at the window. “Why not enjoy the majesty of the outdoors from the comfort of home?”
John reaches for Sherlock’s hand and interlaces their fingers, holds their entwinement atop his thigh.
They zigzag down street after street, taking arbitrary turns to shake off their pursuer. Sherlock veers a sharp right into an alleyway and waves John into a spot beside a skip where they crouch down against the wall, shoulder to shoulder, and wait. John holds his breath.
Greg shakes his head in slow motion. “Something’s rotten in Denmark. I’m not as stupid as you and Sherlock think.”
Sherlock heads to the booth, hanging up his coat and scarf on a hook, and slides in toward the wall. Scans the room, his foot tapping steadily. Stops. Drums his fingers on the sticky table instead.
“Because the ancient Romans would have objected to it,” Mycroft says snootily. “In fact, it would have been punishable by death. The Greeks on the other hand--”
“...naturally, I was curious about my own lip pattern and how accurately it could determine my sex--
Janice? smiles down at her. “I had some already, but thank you so much sweetheart. That’s very thoughtful of you.”
Finally, on Tuesday, she sits him down for a chat. She tells him that she loves him more than anything, but she’s made peace with the fact that he loves and has always loved someone more.
(Also, final reference: Holmes did say “Cut out the poetry, Watson” in "The Adventure of the Retired Colourman.")
Mummy and Dad leave early to catch a train, Mummy planting an embarrassing number of departing kisses on Sherlock and Mycroft’s reluctant cheeks, followed by Wiggins, who’d been expected to attend another party, seemingly popular amongst his Irregulars cohort. Mycroft, thankfully, is next to go, feigning work as an excuse.
John sits beside him, as silent as a stone, but when Sherlock finally sips in a breath to speak, John preempts him: “Just leave it. Let your mum have this.”
” Mummy says with authoritative finality, though her actions betray her tone as she cups Sherlock’s cheek with a soft mitten. “My baby boy. Look at you. Your grandmother would be so pleased to see you like this--settling down with someone. Living your truth. Just like she did.” Then, with clear spite, “Though it took her rather
Why he thinks it now, in this moment, he doesn't know. For someone who has all the answers, Sherlock cannot explain it, though he may always wonder at it. All he knows is that it is significant and life-affirming to love someone like this--natural, pure, and unencumbered.
Though, there is one mercy: John is fully absorbed in typing up a blog post and hasn’t, almost stubbornly so, looked Sherlock’s way once. Sherlock is grateful to be left to suffer sight unseen. But there’s also a niggling, pettish voice in the back of his head that wishes John
But, then again, he does so hate to disappoint Mummy, and she had seemed inordinately uplifted by the idea of his and John’s entanglement.
“Sherlah!” she cries, running at him. Sherlock smiles, pleased to see her and relieved she’s not acted out of turn because he isn’t John, and squats down, lets her hug his knee. He gives her head two quick pats, and she looks up at him with inquisitive, fathomless eyes. “Where’s Daddy?”
, Sherlock isn’t entirely unbiased; he’s been attracted to John since the day they met, but he’s been attracted to many men over the course of his lifetime and had always been able to dismiss such fancies. In recent years, however, he’s found his resolve steadily disintegrating. Worse yet, in the past few weeks, Sherlock’s reptilian brain had triumphed one too many times over the logical neomammalian.
Sherlock slumps deeper into the armchair, chin to chest. “My mother is a loose cannon. Who’s to know what she’ll do? I haven’t ever--,” Sherlock breaks off. He hasn’t ever brought someone home to meet his parents, he’d meant to say. But does he
“You are a fine specimen of man, John,” Holmes said wonderingly as he looked at the hand that remained on my hip, then shifted his line of sight slightly eastward and decidedly centre from my hip, which made my body hot with desire.
Sherlock shrugs one shoulder. “I spent a few months in Los Angeles back in the late nineties. Learned the basics to get into the good graces of suspects in a series of robberies and murders.”
John’s eyes lock onto Sherlock’s chest, and he sits on his haunches to have a wider view in which to sup him up. “God, you’re stunning.”
I laughed nervously. “I couldn’t possibly be more certain, Holmes. I have had ample time to think about it: nearly 8 years, in fact.”
Sherlock doesn’t know how he’s meant to respond to that, so he reaches for the top button of John’s shirt. “My turn.”
It won’t be possible for Sherlock to ever fit so cosily in someone else’s arms. It is a certainty that he will never be so secure and serene anywhere but here.
Two weeks into his stay, his head pulsating with a hangover headache and his stomach churning with nausea, he bites the bullet and sends a text with shaky hands:
Sherlock decides to tell him the story of his grandmother’s life in love: how, despite all odds, she’d fallen in love at the age of sixty and had managed twenty happy years in an idyllic Norfolk cottage with her partner Flora (in their own little world, orbiting each other, all their unbecoming and becoming quirks and pastimes mutually appreciated and understood and loved). Those twenty happy years were the ones in which Sherlock had known her. He does not mention the twenty years she’d had to live alone in that cottage, after Flora’s death.
Come morning, at this rate, with the amount of alcohol John’s plied himself with, maybe the night will be nothing but a faint memory.
for a cigarette often turned into a ride down the pub.” She leans in toward Sherlock, her voice taking on a light but conspiratorial tone, “Think they’re being clever. But we know better, don’t we?”
Janine punches him in the arm, and he nearly spills the drink onto his freshly-laundered Dolce & Gabanna shirt.
John is looking suspicious. He knows he’s being talked about, and hates not knowing what is being said.
He knew that he couldn’t let himself stagnate too long. Putting Sherlock to rest would, in theory, help the rest of them move on. John wasn’t sure about that in practice, but he knew he couldn’t ignore the funeral forever. After puttering around with a bit of cleaning, John finally forced himself to call the funeral director. His name brought no recognition, but upon explaining that he was Sherlock’s friend, he was met by the familiar, reserved,
She joined him on the street a few minutes later with a wad of tissues and a handful of flowers. She offered him a few tissues, which he quietly declined. He wasn’t going to cry. He was getting better, he would prove it. When their cab pulled up, John helped her in, then walked around and climbed in himself. He cleared his throat and gave their destination, ignoring the lingering glance in the rearview mirror. Thankfully the cabbie had the sense to keep his mouth shut, and the back seat fell into unsettled peace as well. John had learned not to mention Sherlock in public; the media storm that had built his reputation had flattened it in a tornado of hatred and ridicule, and the public took the news as it came.
They walked through the park until the cooling evening air and the gnaw of hunger ushered them into a restaurant. John felt unsettled as they sat down at a table together. He almost didn’t need the menu in his hands; he knew the menu well since Sherlock had finagled a delivery deal with the owner. He knew by this point that he had made a mistake by coming to this part of London. It had been almost a year since Sherlock died, but he keenly felt the pull of home. He couldn’t shake the petty feeling that he should be seeing Sherlock sat across from him at the table. He dampened the traitorous thought with a couple glasses of wine, trying to enjoy Mary’s wit and smile while the ache of loss smoldered in his chest. When they parted for the night, Mary kissed his cheek; he didn’t return it, only smiling. After seeing her into a cab, he walked away from the restaurant. He didn’t want to take a cab back to his flat. Not yet. Slightly buzzed from the wine and Mary’s kiss, he wasn’t sure he should be alone with his thoughts in the back of a cab. He felt safer on the familiar pavement, surrounded and comforted by the ghosts of his old life.
He picked up his glass and settled into his armchair with a sigh, crossing his legs. He took a sip of the whiskey and sat, only for a moment before he lost the battle against his curiosity and grabbed the DVD. He picked up the case and flipped it in his fingers, glancing briefly at the television. He had a player. He had an excuse. This was a chance to see his mannerisms, his stupid little charming habits that he missed so desperately. It was a chance to hear his voice again. To hear his name called by that voice again. Before he could talk himself out of it, John dropped the disc in the player and walked back to grab his drink. He plopped down on the sofa across from the television and stared at the wallpaper in 221B, complete with the spray-painted smiley face he hadn’t been able to scrub away. He took another sip of whiskey to steel himself and stared just above the television as Sherlock’s baritone rumbled into his flat. It had been so long since he had heard that voice. He hadn’t quite forgotten, but the memories had taken a ghostly form. Hearing Sherlock’s voice so clearly was almost alarming.
John grimaced at the thought and nodded shortly. He sniffed, turning and shuffling into the flat. He moved a few stacks of papers off the sofa that he had allegedly slept on, sitting down and patting the spot next to him. He scratched his stubbled jaw and wondered how long he would have to wait before his stomach would stop roiling. He didn’t have any appetite, and the deeper he slipped into this depression, the less inclined he felt to force any food down. He knew the hunger would fade eventually. He watched as Mrs. Hudson sat down next to him, then he sighed heavily.
After reviewing the few pictures he had of Sherlock, he wanted to indulge in documenting his happy moments. He would no longer allow himself to be ashamed of his happiness, or his desire to revel in those moments. Whatever this was with Mary, whatever they might be in the future, they were happy. The picture was proof of that.
John pushed aside his hesitancy and allowed casual intimacy to creep into the cracks of his broken heart. It felt good, and he wanted to tend the delicate feelings that were beginning to blossom, lest they bear fruit. As they approached the palm house, John stepped ahead and opened the door for Mary. Hot, humid air hit their lungs, and John inhaled deeply, closing his eyes as he sighed. He took Mary’s hand again after loosening his jacket. He held fast this time, glancing up at the wide green fronds that gently filtered the sunlight streaming through the glass roof.
He insisted on being a pallbearer. Together with Lestrade, Stamford, and the funeral director himself, John helped move Sherlock out the door and into the hearse. As the men carried the coffin, John thought back to the times he had carried Sherlock’s body in the flat – limp with exhaustion, or alcohol, or that time the Woman had drugged him and Greg simply filmed the fiasco of getting Sherlock home
John’s brow rose slightly, but he nodded, pulling up another chair and scooting over so she would have room to eat.
to fill the space. Slowly, slowly, tension drained from John’s shoulders, relieving the ache that radiated along his clavicle. Maybe this was healing.
As months dragged on, John found that he was starting to feel better. He was hesitant to use that word, and he warned Ella against the phrase, but he explained to her that he gradually felt more present. He still measured the passage of time relative to Sherlock’s death, but the 12
“Sher…” A knot rose in his throat, and his voice became too thick to grind out. He swallowed against the block and tried again.
“I’m angry,” he finally stated. The admission was a weight off his chest, and he had to suck in a deep breath as a counterbalance.
“Oh, that, yeah. That’s um, that’s stuff from my office. Stuff of Sherlock’s,” he explained. “I probably should have thrown it out, but I didn’t know if…”
“Love you too! Bye!” he announced abruptly, ending the phone call as he snuggled into his pillow. He passed out in minutes, floating on a cloud of intoxicated bliss.
They walked through the hall until John paused at a bench. He tilted his head, and Mary nodded. They sat down together to enjoy the ambience of the room. The heavy heat was a balm against the chapping chill of the April winds, and a small waterfall babbled in the background. It was a good place to sit and be.
When morning came, John wasn’t sure what he regretted more: the drinking or the phone call. He felt too humiliated to thank Harry for her help, and he couldn’t bear hearing her voice, so he sent a long text asking her to keep the previous night’s events between themselves.
Moving forward felt good. Sometimes he felt bad for feeling so good, but Ella assured him that it was a common reaction to the recovery process. Work brought a sense of stability back to his life. As much as the nine-to-five bored him, it ensured that he slept, ate, and showered on a regular basis. The cheques didn’t hurt, either. He moved into his new studio and gradually made his own space, leaving behind the organized chaos that comprised his life with Sherlock. Some messes just couldn’t be sorted.
Mary beamed, and John smiled back. This was something. He wasn’t sure how far it would go, but it was better than nothing. John grabbed a scrap of paper and wrote down his mobile number and a suggestion for where to go, handing it over to Mary. “You said you’re new to London?”
He closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, curling his toes together. The flat was too bloody quiet. It would always be too quiet from now on. But he needed the quiet of the flat to escape the noise of the outside world. Death had many consequences: arrangements needed to be made, belongings cleaned up and cleaned out, life must grind on. The media had taken care of phone calls, for better or for worse. Everyone who knew anyone knew that Sherlock had died, and how. The incoming calls, texts, and emails had inundated him at first. There were questions he couldn’t answer, questions he couldn’t bring himself to answer, accusations he couldn’t stomach. Everyone seemed to think he was Sherlock’s closest friend – and maybe he was, maybe he had been, but with every acquaintance he had never met and every touching story he had never heard before, a heavy weight grew in the pit of John’s stomach. Had he really known Sherlock at all? He quickly reached the conclusion that he had wasted his time with the man, not realizing that it would be cut short so soon. Even if he had spent his life with Sherlock, he would have wasted it. He was too cautious, too scared, too late.
John took another bite of his sandwich and contemplated Mary, wondering why she might be joining him. She looked up with a smile and he instinctively smiled back around his mouthful. He quickly swallowed and cleared his throat. “So, um, you wanted to talk?”
soon indeed. He had gone forever in less than a month! Later that night after John had been dropped off by his so-called mates, Sherlock had been waiting for him with a small celebration of his own. It wasn't much, just a piece of tiramisu with a post-it note: "Happy birthday, John." Sharing dessert with Sherlock in relative silence had turned out a better plan than the whole dinner he had arranged. John's heart twisted when he wondered if Sherlock counted himself among the friends that hated him. Considering what had happened between them shortly afterward, he wouldn't be surprised.
To his surprise, one of the nurses, Mary, opened his door holding her lunch. His relief was apparent in his expression, and she giggled when she realized he thought he was getting stuck with an unexpected patient. “Hey. Sorry to interrupt. I hoped we might be able to chat?”
A new flat and a new routine afforded John the luxury of avoiding his grief, for the most part. Unfortunately, that also meant avoiding most of his friends. He still saw Ella, but she wasn’t a friend. She was a weekly reminder that as much as he liked to think he had moved on, he was still stuck in the mire of his emotions. They mostly talked about his workplace, his coworkers. Office friendships mainly revolved around work – going to lunch, happy hour, texting back and forth. Nothing personal, and that suited John perfectly.
He felt like a child, lost and alone and delusional. He dropped his head in shame and cried, covering his face with his palm. His right leg burned and ached as he wept. He knew Mrs. Hudson was waiting in the cab. He needed to go. He pulled himself together and drew himself up to attention. Sherlock had never enlisted to his knowledge, and John was officially ex-Army, but they had served together. John saluted his fellow soldier with a nod, then he turned on his heel and walked away.
John discovered that he hadn’t run out of tears after all. They burned in his eyes, and his voice broke as he quietly admitted, “Yeah.”
John could handle most of the fans, and the colleagues, and even the friends here and there. He had struggled with what to say to Mike Stamford, who looked almost as pained and confused as John felt, but he finally settled on a heartfelt thank you. Even in the face of this heart-wrenching pain, John wouldn’t trade his time with Sherlock for anything.
In anticipation of the visit, John tidied up. The whiskey went in a cabinet, flanked by two glasses. Behind the glass door, it appeared more official, as if it were only brought out on special occasions. It was half gone, but Greg wouldn’t notice. He wouldn't pay attention to anything that wasn't prominently displayed. He wasn’t an idiot, but he wasn’t a snoop either. Besides, this was a social visit, not a job. John tossed the miscellaneous post into his bedroom and did his level best to ensure that Greg would have no reason to wonder or worry about him. A few books on the table, curtains opened to let some light in through the bay window. It looked perfectly normal. He looked perfectly normal. Normality was a good disguise; nobody would ever think to question it.
John knew Harry wasn’t trying to be funny, and in all honesty, any break from the saturated tragedy was welcome.
John’s chest ached under all the admissions he wished he had made. It was easy to tell himself the tender words could wait when he thought they would have forever, but now, saying the words wouldn’t make a lick of difference. The words weren’t meant for her.
Privately he wondered what else Greg might have kept out of the box. It wasn’t worth asking. Greg was moving on, and John didn’t want to hold him back in the past. Besides, if it wasn’t in the box, it was probably in a bin somewhere.
“I love you,” she said earnestly, the first time that night that she sounded anything other than in control. If John were sober, he would have heard the concern in her voice.
They walked onto a glass floor decorated with a honeycomb pattern, and then John looked up. The blue sky shone through the center of the sculpture, and a beautiful concentric pattern filtered smaller patches of the sky. In all the chaos, there had been order. He only needed to look at it from the right perspective. He licked his lips and glanced at Mary, watching her experience the artwork for herself. He tucked his hands into his pockets and drew his heels together as he stared at the walls, then back at the sky. Birds and insects chirped, punctuating his thoughts with a note of reality. As he stood there, it was easy for his mind to drift. As captivating as the sculpture was, he wondered
“You only have to look at their faces,” Sherlock continued. “I wrote an essay on suppressed hatred in close proximity based
John opened the door with a little more force than was strictly necessary, and his brow shot up when he saw Mary in her bright red coat smiling at him.
He looked around the flat, somewhat satisfied with the meager progress he had made, and when he turned toward the bookshelf, he found himself confronted by Sherlock’s bee books.
Monday morning at the clinic, he felt different, but in a good way. He felt more whole. Over the past several months he had shunned part of his past – and a big part of himself. He was emotionally exhausted but hopeful that he could make something of this new beginning. It was easier to smile at patients, laughing with them over anecdotes and asking about their weekends. The fog was starting to lift, and John was so grateful.
Their shadows grew long in the waning light, and soon it was time to say goodbye. The casket was lowered, and each of them tossed a handful of dirt into the grave, along with a few flowers. John felt like throwing up. He leaned against Harry and Mrs. Hudson and let his family lead him back to Harry’s car to go home. As they drove away, emotions welled up again, asphyxiating him from within. He practiced slow breathing and avoided Harry’s worried glances in the rearview mirror. He was thankful that Mrs. Hudson had declined to ride with him, instead choosing to get a bite to eat with Greg and some of the other mourners. John was too tired to socialize any more, and he didn’t have any appetite.
John continued his sessions with Ella, once a week. He didn’t tell Mrs. Hudson where he was going, and frankly, it seemed to be a bit pointless. He wasn’t feeling better. He told her in bits and pieces about what he had been doing, what he was planning, what he had failed to do. Maybe it helped a bit, just to tell someone else some of what was going on in his head. He felt that he couldn’t burden Sherlock’s other friends and despite Harry’s offer, he didn’t want her to know that he was struggling. Ella consistently encouraged him to go talk to Sherlock but never made it a required task. Perhaps she had learned from the blogging assignment that once John had a mind for something, he would follow through better than she could have imagined.
John nodded and turned off the main path toward the installation. From a distance, the structure had almost resembled a cage, cold and looming on its hill. The intricate, almost woven pattern emerged from the mass as they drew closer, layers upon layers of twisted steel stretching up seventeen meters tall. Four walls came together in a square, perched on a platform and surrounded by a circular path through the wildflowers. A series of wide steps wound around the hill to an entrance into the sculpture. John squinted a little as he tried to make any sense of the pattern. Then he saw it – the name of the artwork. They called it The Hive.
On Tuesdays, he afforded himself the luxury of an extra hour in bed. He stared at his ceiling and bided his time carefully. He didn’t work until three, and the botanic gardens opened at ten. He would meet Mary there, and they would probably get lunch afterward. He grunted and grabbed his phone to check the time, working out when he had to leave. He didn’t want to be late, after all. He checked the train schedule and allowed himself to lounge around for another half hour, then he finally got up. He groaned and stretched, grimacing as his joints popped. The rut of a comfortable routine and a lack of regular exercise had taken their toll. Ever since Helmand, he had looked his age; now he really felt it.
John couldn’t take it anymore. He turned to her, his heart in his throat. “Yeah, listen. I- I’m not actually
He ambled to the kitchen in his boxers and grabbed a pan, throwing together a quick scramble with some toast, washing it down with a cuppa. He eyed the pile of post that he usually forced himself to sort on Tuesdays and pushed it away for later. He had a prior engagement. He didn’t exactly feel like getting dressed and going out, but he knew it was for the best. Besides, he was meeting Mary – he couldn’t just
Harry slapped his back, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek. “Yeah, you too! You should come around more often.” She gave him a small smile and plucked out a couple tissues for him.
The clip ended a few minutes later and the speakers hummed as Sherlock stared out from the screen. John turned the television off and looked at Mary speechlessly, only raising his brow. He inhaled deeply and pressed his lips together, searching for something to say.
He had gone to the funeral parlor the night before to set up the posters displaying photographs and memories. Mycroft had sent Anthea over with a box of photographs from Sherlock’s childhood, and John had spent hours looking through them. He slowly pieced together a part of Sherlock’s life that they had never really discussed. It seemed a picturesque childhood. Now he would never know how Sherlock really felt about it. Clearly, something had happened; something had changed. The photos dropped off around his early teenage years, and then there was nothing until a stony-faced graduation photo taken at Cambridge. Sherlock had lost his boyish chubby cheeks, and the smiles that had come so abundantly in his childhood had faded away. John wished he could fill some of the gaps. He was grateful that Sherlock's smile had surfaced again in recent years. He didn’t want to think about the world without it.
He continued to work on his drafts, but new comments kept popping up. Jacob, Mike, Mrs. Hudson. John thanked Jacob, a young fan who had been following the blog for a long time. Mike and Mrs. Hudson had asked about getting a drink, along with someone new, Mary, who signed off with a kiss. John ignored them. Even Harry still followed the blog, it seemed, but she didn’t have anything to say about his post.
Finally, her voice abruptly rang out. “John… uh. Do me a favor, Johnny? Let’s put the whiskey down, hm? Let’s find the cap- Tell me when you’ve got it.”
The words had tumbled out, but now he was suffocating again, shaking his head at how wrong it sounded. He had been so full of life. The man who had brought
John glanced up with hurt smoldering in his damp eyes. He wouldn’t ask, but his expression begged the question.
When they arrived at the cemetery, John directed the driver to Sherlock’s grave, a little surprised that he remembered the twists and turns. When they finally reached the spot, John stared out the window disdainfully. The ground had flattened now, but the grave was still a bare rectangular patch of dirt. He felt a strong urge to leave. It was the path of least resistance. Then Mrs. Hudson stirred as she shifted to get out, and he remembered he had little choice but to go. Accountability had its merits. “We’ll just be a few minutes, mate,” he murmured quietly, patting the seat in front of him.
They sat together on the bench, leaning on each other and soaking in the warmth of each other’s company until the humidity became too much to endure. John grew restless and glanced down at the folded map sitting on his lap.
back to life was gone. Even whilst cleaning the flat and sorting Sherlock’s things, John couldn’t shake the denial that seemed to soak back in whenever he let his guard down. It was no longer outright denial. He knew Sherlock was dead, intellectually. He had buried him! He just couldn’t believe it. If he remained stuck in that cycle of disbelief followed by the sucker punch of overwhelming grief, he couldn’t foresee getting better. Hope was a poison he couldn’t wash out of his system.
Slowly, John branched out. He got better at deflecting impolite questions and politely accepting condolences as he planted the seeds of the next chapter of his life. He reached out to Sarah and officially tendered his final resignation, apologizing for his sporadic assistance and requesting a letter of reference for his upcoming job search. He was relieved to find that she had no bad blood toward him, and he only got a little misty when she brought up their misadventure with Sherlock. Sarah had understood John’s predicament all too well, but unlike most of the women John dated, she never resented Sherlock. John appreciated that now more than ever.
John exhaled with relief that he hoped wasn’t too obvious, and he nodded. “Thank you,” he said, though he couldn’t say what for, exactly.
show up. Loathe as he was to admit it (even to himself) he often felt fine once he was out of the house. Left to stagnate, he would be worse off. So, he found himself on the Tube again, swaying back and forth on his way to Kew Gardens. He texted back and forth with Mary to pin down exactly where they would meet. Finally, he reached his stop. It was a short walk to the gate where they had agreed to meet. Checking his watch, he was satisfied to see that he had arrived about ten minutes before the gardens opened. Right on time.
up the stairs. Sherlock’s weight had been hell on his back and knees, and Sherlock had always tangled his limbs around John in the most awkward way. But now, even as Sherlock’s body weighed painfully upon his shoulder, John was glad to carry him one last time.
John sucked in a deep breath and his mouth twisted into a grimace. Mary was there for him. Mary was there. Still there, even as he struggled to rein in his thoughts and feelings and the tremor in his hand that threatened to leak into the rest of his body. Memories flooded in. He could feel himself shaking. He still felt Mary’s hand calm and warm on his shoulder. He remembered reaching out to take Sherlock’s wrist, desperate to feel a pulse bounding against his fingertips. He remembered the hands that grabbed at him, trying to pull him away from his friend – the man with whom he had wanted to spend the rest of his life. It was different now. Mary wasn’t pulling him away; she was standing with him, holding him steady.
At the end of the day, John waited for Mary to join him so they could leave together. He held the door for her, then followed her out onto the pavement. “I was thinking Regent’s Park? It’s close to a good spot for dinner. And there’s plenty of flowers,” John reasoned.
John realised that Mary was holding his hand and he held fast. Mary was doing for him now what Sherlock had done back then. His heart was broken but not incapable of beating, or feeling. He wouldn’t let this opportunity pass him by. Not again.
that surrounded him. He briefly thought of Sherlock’s fits of boredom and felt a little self-conscious. Of course, life since Sherlock had never been truly boring. Even the flat was a trove of oddities and loose ends that Sherlock had hoarded and forgotten over the years. The first time John had walked in, he felt as if he had walked into a haphazard museum curated by the subject of its study. He had never felt comfortable looking through Sherlock's souvenirs under the detective's watchful eye, and it still felt like an invasion of privacy. Sherlock’s shelves had gathered John’s curiosity and a fair amount of dust between surreptitious cleanings.
He sucked in a deep breath and leaned over to grab the remote off the table. He turned the television on again and fiddled with the controls until the DVD rewound.
On the ride back to Baker Street, John held Mrs. Hudson’s hand loosely in his as he mulled over the muddled thoughts swimming around his head. He knew he couldn’t stay at the flat. He needed a change, a place of his own. He needed to survive this, to bear witness to Sherlock’s genuine genius. He couldn’t squander the gift of life that Sherlock had bestowed upon him that invigorating night. To get a place of his own, he would need a job. Mrs. H had been very forgiving about the bills, but he couldn’t depend on her generosity forever. He knew he wasn’t quite moving on, but he could move forward. Sherlock would consider it idiotic to stay stuck in the mire for any longer – he had already wasted time moping about. He needed to form a plan.
As a doctor, a soldier, a friend, John couldn’t find an answer. Where there was once an abundant wealth of information – answers John didn’t wish to know to questions he didn’t think to ask – Sherlock had now left a gaping hole that he couldn’t fill. Sherlock’s explanation, more like an excuse, didn’t satisfy him. The ‘confession’ had washed over his ears, only taking root as news stations projected Sherlock’s lies in Piccadilly Square, newspapers, magazines, talk shows, everywhere. It was inescapable and inconceivable. Nobody believed in Sherlock. The public that had carried him to such heights now turned on him, casting him away as a fraud. But John had been there. His life had changed over the course of a brief conversation, followed by an invitation.
“I’m proud of you,” he said quietly, his throat sore from all the talking and the crying. “And… thank you. For coming. And… Sorry I didn’t call, I-” He took another sip, the cup in his hand shook slightly after he swallowed. “I’ve been trying to get things done. There’s so much.”
John smiled at the encouraging comment and quickly typed out a reply. ‘Yeah. It feels good. Thanks. Typing up the old cases now.’
John hesitated before opening his mouth. Others had asked out of a sense of duty or morbid curiosity without any genuine concern or desire to understand. But maybe Mary was different. She
John nodded. “Yeah. The parks, the river walk… the touristy crap.” He paused for a moment. “D’you know I haven’t been to some of that either? Tower of London, all that.”
“Oh, no. Er, come in.” He stepped aside and waved her in. He was thankful for Greg’s visit – at least it had driven him to tidy the flat.  He hurried over to grab the remote and turned off the television. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “Friend of mine just, uh, stopped by.”
In lieu of talking to Mycroft, John dealt exclusively with Anthea. She had the sense not to offer her condolences, at least not in a canned catchphrase. John didn’t know whether she knew the extent of her boss’s dealings in his own brother’s demise, and he couldn’t blame her for Mycroft’s poor decisions. Still, the explosive knowledge that Mycroft had given away Sherlock’s weaknesses had left shrapnel that still lodged in his throat whenever he thought of the man. He couldn’t rightfully ban Mycroft from his brother’s funeral, but he would be damned if he let Mycroft dictate every detail. He reached out regarding photographs of Sherlock from their childhood and informed Anthea of the arrangements he had made. He didn’t ask how Mycroft was coping. He couldn’t bring himself to care.
John stared down into his lap. “I can tell you what you can do. You can stop being dead,” he murmured, washing down the bitter words with whiskey.
John broke out of his reverie and gathered himself immediately. He had been lost to the world, steeped in thoughts too big to hold.
of every month was no longer anchored to sadness. He no longer felt chained to his grief. The freedom tasted bittersweet. As he grew more accustomed to the world without Sherlock (though he knew he would never fully adjust) he found it slightly easier to live with the daily reminders that had felt like salt in his raw wounds in the early days. He might get upset, but he could keep going. He still felt wounded, but not mortally.
John knew he looked terrible. He was still wearing yesterday’s clothes and his hair was a right mess, not to mention his snotty nose and red eyes. But Mrs. Hudson wasn’t going to leave until he opened the door.
Greg nodded and leaned toward the door. He was clearly uncomfortable. Perhaps he felt that he was intruding on a life that no longer had space for him. Perhaps he was right. The old camaraderie between them felt brittle now, strained by the memory of the friend who had affected both men deeply but in vastly different ways. That chasm stood stark and uncomfortable now. The naked truth was rather ugly, and better clothed in soft white lies.
No more Tchaikovsky, or Vivaldi, or Mozart, or Holmes. Sherlock had shared a few of his original compositions, and now John wished he had a recording. It would pale in comparison to hearing the bow dance across the strings of Sherlock’s violin, filling the flat with music and resin dust, but it would be something.
When the bell rang, John exhaled hard and buzzed Greg up. He was met by a box, which he took with a terse smile. He promptly set it down on the counter and moved to let Greg by.
He walked over the uneven burial ground with Mrs. Hudson, stopping when they reached Sherlock’s grave. Outside the confines of the car, she had begun griping about the state of the flat. John had plateaued, leaving the bulk of Sherlock’s things in place. He couldn’t get rid of them, and he refused to involve Mycroft.
He opened his eyes and saw that she was leaning toward him now. He felt like a wounded animal, her prey. She knew he was hurting, and still, she was pushing him harder. Perhaps that was part of the therapy. He had asked for help. He knew he needed it. So, he took his time. He took a deep breath.
“Was that supposed to happen – the light going down? Yeah, okay,” came the voice, not yet attached to a body. Sherlock blustered onto the screen and started pacing in front of the sofa, gesturing wildly. “Oh, er, hm. So, what do I, what do I- What d’you want me to do at the end?”
show up. Molly didn’t come. He had been expecting to see her, even steeling himself to comfort her, but he never saw her. Come to think of it, he hadn’t heard from her, not since before Sherlock jumped. He was most shocked that Sherlock’s parents didn’t show up. They had never discussed their families in any detail, but Sherlock never said that his parents were dead. John knew better than to assume that meant they were alive but hadn’t Mycroft and Sherlock traded snippy taunts about their mother? John concluded that maybe his parents preferred something private and closer to home, wherever that was.
“Oh, John!” Her delight was genuine, but her surprise wasn’t. She had likely heard him coming down the stairs. “Come in, come in!”
He had provided more than enough evidence for the skeptics. Anyone who persisted in insulting Sherlock was only out to cause trouble. John wasn’t going to let some idiot ruin his day. In the early afternoon, Ella texted him. He had told her about his plans with Mary, and it seemed like she had approved. John couldn’t contain a wry smile and thanked her for checking in. He had stressed that it wasn’t a date. It was just going out. There was a difference.
John sat in near silence and shifted uncomfortably. Traffic pealed by on the roads below him, and rain beat against the tall windows facing the street. He could hear faint voices coming from downstairs, most likely the television. Mrs. H did enjoy her “Bake Off”. Sherlock was off in Edinburgh, enraptured by a string of crime that he had neatly tied together over the weekend. As John understood it, now it was simply a matter of ‘catching the idiots red-handed’. John stared at Sherlock’s most recent barrage of texts and tucked his phone away with a sigh. Sherlock’s adventures weren’t nearly as fun when he wasn’t a part of them.
“…Yeah.” He nodded. “That was you on the blog, then? ‘Mary, x.’” He mimed quotation marks with his fingers, and her blush teased out a small smile from him. “How did you find it?”
Dressing for the funeral felt like preparing for battle, without any of the camaraderie or bluster. The deafening silence reminded him that he had to face this alone. His suit was pressed, his hair combed and gelled into place. He had shaved twice, in the hopes of avoiding a haggard look by the end of the day. Any measures he could take would surely help. He steeled himself for the pity and morbid curiosity that he had attracted since the day Sherlock died. In the mirror, John looked a perfect picture except for the emptiness in his tired eyes, and the bags that weighed them down. He repeatedly checked his watch until he couldn’t delay any further, then he slowly headed down the stairs to collect Mrs. Hudson.
a bloody encyclopedia. John had never realized there was quite so much to know about honeybees, or that Sherlock was so passionate about them. He carefully tucked the book back in its place on the shelf and filed Sherlock's obsession with bees into the back of his mind. Come spring they could take a walk through the park on a dull day. He might even find a moment to ask Sherlock about the bees.
“Shit,” he mumbled. He cleared his throat and grabbed the whiskey and a glass. He would only pour enough to ease his mind a little. Just enough to relax his throat and allow him to breathe again. He immediately screwed the cap back on and put the bottle away in the cabinet. He had learned not to leave the bottle within reach on the bad days. It wasn’t a lack of self-control so much as a matter of convenience. He wouldn’t pour another if he had to get up. By the time he summoned the energy to do so, the urge would have passed.
He met Mary at the Victoria Gate, hugging her as she offered an embrace. John picked up a map and frowned at it briefly, trying to figure out how much they could realistically do in a day, then revising his plan to make it enjoyable. He knew he wanted to walk through some of the indoor displays, and he enjoyed the solitude of the outdoors, too. He could try to relax around Mary and capture that treasured feeling of being alone, with someone else. It was a rare treat, and one he desperately needed. He hadn’t experienced that kind of tranquil camaraderie since Sherlock died.
Finally, the doors closed. The funeral director came to the front of the room and addressed the crowd that had stuck around for the burial. He said a few words about his professional relationship with Sherlock, including a few of Sherlock’s quips and questions about his job that made John cringe as hard as they made him laugh. He sobered when the floor was offered to anyone who wanted to make any comments. John swore he could instantly feel at least half a dozen pairs of eyes on him. He sunk into his chair a little. He had never been good at these things. He had to prepare his words to make sure he got them right. As it became evident that he would not be speaking, a few individuals chose to stand and share the stories they told John earlier. Then, to his great surprise and mild horror, Harry stood. Even as he blushed, John folded his hands in his lap. Things would only be worse if he tried to stop her.
still stuck out slightly, and John reached out to gently extract it. He cringed as the other books fell into the void it left, but the disorder wouldn’t upset Sherlock now, would it? He opened the book and thumbed through its pages. It smelled musty, and John relished the weight of it in his lap. He started to scan it, taking the time to read Sherlock’s notes now. Even as his vision shimmered with tears threatening to fall, John smiled. He could practically hear Sherlock’s voice. John couldn’t make sense of half of what he was reading, but that wasn’t the
John sniffed, swallowed, and tried to bring himself back to his task. The blog. He typed out a simple sentence and posted it.
John mulled over that as the clock ticked. He thought about what he would say if he had the chance. What should he say now? Talking to a gravestone seemed futile, but perhaps it was better than soaking himself in Scotch and drowning in his own sorrow.
“Thank you for coming,” he murmured, and he meant every word, even to Sally who couldn’t quite meet his eyes. Anderson was actually crying. John didn’t know what to do, and he was thankful when Greg ushered the man away to clean him up.
John’s throat tightened as he walked around the flat with fresh eyes. Sherlock was a master of Judo, a fact he displayed in a certificate on his bedroom wall. Previously written off as an annoying experiment, John realized that for the dog hair poster (complete with samples, by necessity) Sherlock must have stopped and collected hair from each of the species listed. John laughed through his tears as he imagined Sherlock categorically petting dogs and then saving the shed fur. He considered the artwork that Sherlock had brought into the flat. The man had always considered himself rooted in facts, science, and reality, but he had clearly had a sensual side. John had seen Sherlock’s humanity for better and for worse. He felt as though he had never stopped to fully appreciate it. That was something of a lie – he had spent many evenings drifting off to Sherlock’s violin, and he had borne witness to cases that compelled Sherlock to show a rare but deep reserve of compassion. Come to think of it, his introduction to Sherlock had been a spectacular show of understanding on Sherlock’s part. He had met Sherlock as an irate, infirm man teetering on the edge of suicide. Over the course of one breathtaking night, Sherlock had brought him back to life. With a wink and a smile, Sherlock had lit a fire within him, encouraging him to take steps toward recovery. Within weeks, John felt like a person again. He wished that he had the same insight, that he could have performed a miracle for Sherlock like so many Sherlock had done for him before.
One day, about three weeks after the funeral, John decided he was ready to see Sherlock, to share some of what he wanted to say. He wasn’t ready to say all of it, but Ella seemed to think it might help to get the words out. He didn’t have any better ideas. He trotted down the steps and hesitantly approached Mrs. Hudson’s door. He knocked, and she answered quickly.
Saying it hadn’t been easy, but it was such a weight off his chest. It was one of the truths that had shaped his relationship with Sherlock, yet he had never addressed it with the other man; it had seemed there was never a good time to talk about it, and then they were out of time.
“I thought we could start to discuss the funeral.” She spoke delicately, but there was a practical nature to her concern. “Before Mycroft does anything,” she explained with a mild expression of disdain.
“I’m here because…” His voice dropped off, and he glanced away, feeling a bit sick to his stomach. He closed his eyes and steeled himself, taking a moment to collect his anguish and stuff it back where it belonged. He heard her shift in her seat, and then she spoke clearly, demanding that he answer her.
Once the hearse was ready to go, John flagged down Harry to ask for a ride, arranging for Greg to ride with Mrs. Hudson. He didn’t want her to be alone, but he couldn’t be cooped up with her for however long it took them to reach the cemetery. She was already starting to move on, or so it seemed, and John couldn’t fathom it. He knew it wasn’t healthy to feel that way, but he couldn’t force himself to be around someone happier than him.
John snorted. “Yeah.” A small smile graced his lips more genuinely than anything he had felt earlier. This wasn’t cruel, like finding humour in Sherlock’s rambling. Mary had hit it right on the head – the man was nervous. Something about wishing John a happy birthday had made him
haven’t gotten out to really see things, you know?” She scoffed and tore the piece of naan in her lunch, using it to soak up the remnants of her curry.
. Sherlock had known the value of sitting in silence. They both had bad nights on occasion, and they both knew talking wasn’t always helpful. John ached for one more silent night with Sherlock. They could spend time alone even when they sat together. He wasn’t sure he would ever find that again.
He took his lunch in his office and leaned back in his chair with a frown when he heard a knock. He wasn’t expecting an appointment for at least an hour and a half. He had been rather looking forward to enjoying his long lunch. He swiveled his chair toward the door. “Yes?”
Mary obliged him, and they took a proper picture together, their cheeks practically squished together in an effort to fit more of their picturesque surroundings into the frame.
Under her guidance, he found some headache pills and put them out for the morning. He wrote a note to make a scramble, and told Harry a meandering anecdote about how Sherlock used to eat eggs and soldiers. John hated soft boiled eggs, but he would make them for Sherlock.
“Hello John,” Sherlock said in a cheery tone, garnishing the greeting with a smile. “I’m sorry I’m not there right now. I’m very busy. However, many happy returns. Oh, and don’t worry. I’m going to be with you again
John kept his appointments with Ella and kept skirting the issue of his blog. He didn’t have anything to say. He certainly didn’t have anything to say to the world. He needed to focus on his life, for now, he insisted. He still found himself reading old entries at night, sometimes. He still felt like a guest on his own blog. Ella made a note of that when he let that slip during a session. As he fell into a routine, the weekly meetings became bi-weekly. The appointments started feeling less clinical, a lot less painful. Now it was more keeping track of his life. How was work? Any friends? Was he dating? John shook his head whenever she asked that. He wasn’t ready to date. He hadn’t really dated in the last six months of Sherlock’s life, anyway. He had discovered that save for his libido, everyone was a lot happier that way, and he could manage his libido well enough. It was a sustainable life, until it fell apart. He didn’t share those details with Ella.
He turned away from the headstone and started to walk back to the cab. He had said what he had come to say. But he stopped, turning back to face Sherlock’s name.
John was surprised when he heard from Greg rather out of the blue. He had seen him maybe once or twice after the funeral, but then… John was mired in his grief, Greg in never-ending paperwork and tangential guilt; the spiral, like a noose, had tightened considerably after Sherlock’s attempted arrest. Not that it could have been avoided. Greg’s career was already on the line as case after case became subject to appeal as Sherlock's reputation began to crumble. But none of that mattered after Sherlock took his life. Not to him, and certainly not to John. Neither of them felt strongly enough about the other to overcome the awkwardness. Life went on.
The imagined afternoon in the park with the bees never came. Moriarty and his bloody game clouded their life and stole their precious time. John stood by Sherlock through it all until his patience snapped in the lab. Not even an hour later, Sherlock jumped. John had come to think of their lives as one, a life meant for them to live together, and now Sherlock’s was over.
After a brief silence, and with a sharp intake of breath, Sherlock re-centered himself. In almost a whisper, he asked, “What was my excuse again?”
He made another quick, bland dinner and tried to keep up with the bare necessities of life. A couple of people had checked in with him, mainly Mrs. Hudson popping in when he stopped moving around. She was far from subtle, but perhaps she was on edge. Everyone else seemed to be moving on, slowly. Work and family beckoned, sucking people back into everything else; John both longed for a distraction and loathed himself for it.
The claws of boredom sank deeper. His fingers twitched, and his frayed nerves buzzed for something, anything to take his mind off the
Greg sucked in a breath and pushed up off the chair, crossing the small room to reach the box. “Yeah, there’s- there’s- there’s something here, um… Wasn’t sure if I should have kept it in,” he admitted. “You remember the video message he made for your birthday?”
That small fact had made him question the foundation of their friendship in the early, fragile days of grief. But then, there were so many things about Sherlock he never knew, and things Sherlock hadn’t known about him – of course, Sherlock didn’t care about mundane details.
She started walking back toward the cab, making use of the tissues in her pocket to blow her nose. John stared down at the dirt over Sherlock’s body, trying to imagine that he was talking to more than a stone. If Sherlock were here he would no doubt ridicule him, reminding him that the corpse couldn’t hear him. In some ways, that was emboldening; in others, heartbreaking. He glanced over his shoulder to check that Mrs. Hudson was well past gone, then he turned back to Sherlock and drew a deep breath. The time had come.
Looking around the flat he became more aware of just how much work he had to do. He stood with a heavy sigh and glanced over his shoulder into the kitchen. He pursed his lips and turned back toward Sherlock’s empty armchair. Every nook and cranny of the flat had Sherlock’s mark on it – things were his, or worst of all,
He coughed against a sob that welled up with bile in his throat. The five stages of grief were shit. Grief came in waves. Denial, bargaining, anger, depression, rinse and repeat – John wasn’t sure he would ever reach acceptance. Part of him didn't want that. Accepting Sherlock’s death would be putting him to rest, and John wasn’t ready. For the rest of his life, he would never be ready.
John turned a few lights on and stood in the doorway for a couple minutes. He was overwhelmed. Where to start? John knew that if he asked, Mycroft would send people to come through and scrub the flat of all traces of Sherlock, but he didn’t want that. He could make decisions after getting some sleep. He skipped dinner, choosing instead to head straight up to his room. He stripped off his clothes and curled up in his bed, feeling more alone than ever.
Harry didn’t sleep much that night. She considered a trip to London and resolved to ask John about it in the morning. She had never really been in this position before. He had always been cleaning up after her, listening to her rants and raves, healing her broken heart. Years of hurt lay between them, but he was her brother, and she was his sister; they found a way to push through the past to reach one another when it mattered most.
John walked back to the hearse, taking his position as they pulled the casket out and carried it to the graveside. It was a nice place, under a pine tree. Its massive trunk cast a shadow in the golden light of impending dusk. Mycroft stood a distance away, apart from the mourning party, but John chose to ignore him. He certainly wouldn’t welcome him.
“Fine. Whatever,” Greg answered from behind the camera, and John could almost see him rolling his eyes at Sherlock.
. It was a shock to see "W.S.S. Holmes" written in loopy cursive on the inside cover in pencil. John's curiosity spurred him to flip through a few pages, and he discovered several charming annotations. Some of the notes were written in the same shaky hand, but most had been written in Sherlock’s familiar scrawl.
Arguably less personal was Sherlock’s eclectic bookshelf. Books were fair game, John decided, pushing out of his chair to peruse the titles. Most were medical texts, forensics, psychology, the occasional true crime story; nothing surprising. A series of crime fiction novels teased a soft smile from John’s lips. The fact that Sherlock owned pedestrian crime novels was endearing. Some of the books were in foreign languages. John cocked an eyebrow when he found a dog-eared collection of Shakespeare's sonnets and other works. He crossed the fireplace and continued to read through the rows of books, generally unsurprised but vaguely amused nonetheless. Then he paused, his gaze resting upon faded gold letters embossed in dark leather: "ABC and XYZ of Bee Culture." Immediately to the right of the hardcover was a more recent edition, and beside that several more books about bees – specifically, honeybees. John paused, then pulled out the leather-bound
John cleaned up and glanced at the clock, sighing when he saw he still had an hour to go before they were supposed to go bury Sherlock. It was something of a rushed affair, but part of him just wanted it all over with. John stood up and brushed himself off, bringing Harry back with him. As he re-entered the viewing room, he busied himself with introducing Sherlock’s friends to his sister, putting names to faces for her.
Sherlock sighed, "My dad gets visits. Usually they're supervised, but…they thought it was going so well, and my dad cleans up real nice." He tore a hand through his hair, "I didn't even say anything. I make sure to be quiet and not reactive."
John reached for Sherlock's hand and gripped it tight. He meant what he said. He constantly felt like he was walking on eggshells around here, like he could never be himself, like he would never find himself. He felt like he was always hiding something, but with Sherlock…Christ, with Sherlock he felt…
He reasoned he shouldn’t be this anxious around John, since he hadn’t given him any sign that he should be, but the more he went into Victor the more he was sure John would scrunch his nose and tell Sherlock to get out.
He stayed aware of his surroundings, careful to not knock anything over. He gave a quick glance to John. His head was titled back, arms over the sides of the chair, legs stretched out. Sherlock repressed a chuckle, and made his way to the bathroom.
John stared back at this man he was forced to call his father and for a brief second wondered if he actually cared. John knew he hadn't had the best life, but neither had John, and only one of them was at a bar all day.
John laughed, and tried to think of a reason for there to be a wavy building, but Sherlock's features were much too distracting. Everything about his face was long and translucent, down to his eyelashes. His hair was even messier than usual, the blankets behind him doing little to hold them down as they still fell in all directions around his head.
"Well," He paused for a moment, "I think you deserve it. I think everyone deserves to be sought after. Within reason."
John rolled his eyes before kissing Sherlock again, his hands on either side of Sherlock's face and Sherlock's chest pressed against his.
He shook his head instead. He could've said yes, he could've outed Sherlock right then, but Sherlock had just as much evidence against John as John did him.
Sherlock nodded, then looked around. John didn’t really know what was actually going on. Sherlock said that he didn’t need to, and that whatever that he saidJohn had to follow. John didn't know why he agreed.
John said she hadn’t taken everything, and she would probably be back, but it had been more than twelve hours, and everything was still quiet. Sherlock just felt on edge. At any point Mary could come back and tear this apart.
fuck. im in love with my own fic. this is my new child. (also i think i figured out how to format it right?)
He smoothed out his clothes and opened the door with a bit more apprehension in his body than he would've liked. Sherlock was already standing there, white sleeves rolled up past his shoulders and black washed jeans high above his ankles. His hair was pushed down with a flat top hat, but still sneaked under the visor, curling it's way over Sherlock's eyes. All the air left John's lungs.
"Oh yes. See, I think we both want to get out of here. I think we both hate everyone and everything here."
John huffed. Both of them were getting irritated now, “Why not? Why can’t I? Since you know everything.”
"You like being alone." He started slowly, " Well, you like people thinking you like to be alone. You think you deserve it. That you're too much effort, too much time. Oh, Sherlock."
"Sherlock?" He opened his eyes, and sure enough Sherlock was standing above the bed. His shirt untucked from his jeans, and his hair a mess from running his hands through it again and again, as he was doing now.
It made John furious. He wished he could wipe that goddamn smirk off his face without getting his own bashed in in the process.
Everything was so new. Lips on his, hands in his hair, fresh marks on his neck, all by a guy. It made his mind stop dead in it’s tracks.
Sherlock spun side to side in the chair. There was a heavy silence in the space between John's breaths, and an even heavier one between Sherlock's.
Sherlock shifted, but didn’t respond. John took the opportunity to push closer, his mouth now against Sherlock’s neck.
"How is it not fair?" I asked, sitting straight, keeping my face blank, "If I was the one who fell, who came back without a word—"
Every time he saw Sherlock in the hallways after that, he could feel the wet heat of his mouth on his skin. He could feel every fading (and not so fading) mark tingle, and flare up like faulty wiring.
The whole thing was Molly’s idea. She thought it would be just the most if John led him along. In the middle of the damn year too, when Sherlock had already stared John down plenty of times.
"Humans are built to be bored, John, it's what makes us different from the apes who can pick fleas all day long and don't think about a higher purpose."
Sherlock teased the idea of taking a shower himself, but the thought of it made him want to sleep. Everything made him want to sleep, honestly, and funny enough, that was the one thing he couldn't get ahold of. John wasn't sleeping either, but Sherlock was pretty sure that was because he was worried he would run off again.
Sherlock would never be shot down. He didn’t go out much sure, but he did like to tease. He played the game as much as anyone. Even how he dressed: dark leather jacket, plain shirt a size too big on his tall, thin body, tucked into black jeans. All of it was meant only to attract, and even though he never went steady, he would still be found petting on girls while a movie flickered in the background, found the next day with fading marks on his neck to accompany the broken skin on his lip.
"No, we should leave our middle-class life where we have somewhat of an education in favor of being homeless and humoring that fantasy of being together forever."
Slow. He held back, yes, but guided instead of dominating. Simply teaching instead of taking. Their mouths were open but no tongue intruded. John instead got hints and glimpses of it. Nothing more.
"But you're gonna ask anyway." Sherlock said. John could tell he had lit a cigarette from the smell in the air. The first drag always smelled the sweetest.
John blinked, eyelashes brushing his cheek, and his hand found a place on Sherlock’s hip. It was a nice pressure, a perfect fit.
Sherlock's face was mostly blank, but there was a slight dip in eyebrows and a slight turn in his lips that John couldn't help but notice.
He liked being the one to make Sherlock both mad and happy. He liked laying on his bed and staring at the ceiling. He liked being able to just talk, without worrying about what Sherlock was gonna say, since Sherlock said odd things himself. He liked being asked questions and feeling like there was a reason he was being asked those questions. God, he just really liked Sherlock.
small thing i thought was nice: towards the start when i wrote “rose-dawn” it was a reference to how homer describes the sunrise as “dawn’s rosy fingers” just btw.
John was immediately behind him, asking questions, trying to figure out what was wrong, but Sherlock was busy in his own head.
They were like planets how they gravitated towards each other, not able to leave the other’s gentle orbit. It felt like nothing. It felt so fucking natural that nothing else. Time, place, relationships. None of it was important.
Her head tilted back in a sharp laugh, "Of course. C'mon." She waved him into a grey building, windows broken, one misplaced fire away from crumbling completely.
John looked at him for a few moments, really looked at him. He started from the top. Long face, sharp cheekbones that practically casted shadows on his jaw, and lips just as sharp. The bottom of his ears poked out of his hair, which was in shambles on his head. John wondered if he ever looked in the mirror.
John didn't really know why he said that. There was no point in making conversation. In fact, he probably shouldn't make conversation, so he doesn't give Sherlock any reason to keep talking to him.
John's heart stopped. He knew it. He knew it from the start. John was nothing to Sherlock, while Sherlock ended up being everything to him.
John didn’t know what he was doing. He knew that grass was under him, and Sherlock was on top of him, and Sherlock's eyes were burning brighter than he had ever seen. Hot breath lingered with his, and all he saw was pale skin and pink lips, and he was so close and so far from where he wanted to be.
Sherlock hated being at yet another hotel. It was a little better with John behind him from the start, but he still had that pit in his stomach. He wanted to tell it to go fuck itself.
Sherlock nodded again, tilting his own head up so he could bury his nose in John’s neck. He took a small breath, “Mycroft likes to pin all of my… Demons, on-“ Sherlock shook his head, realizing he didn’t want to say his name.
“Wh- Sh- I am not-” John’s face was hot and he was stuttering. He hated Sherlock for being able to read him like a book.
John wasn’t too sure how Sherlock got into his house. He had blurred memories of trying to push him away, of telling him that he couldn’t come in, but all he knew was Sherlock was lying on his bed, flicking ash everywhere, threatening to set his room, and his life, on fire.
“Well…?” Sherlock was still looking down at him, ego the size of his messy hair and as dark as his jacket.
This probably wasn’t a good idea. Sherlock could hear Mycroft's voice in the back of his head, telling how this was going to backfire, but he couldn’t find the energy to care.
Sherlock kicked his shoes off in the middle of the room, ruining the plastic aesthetic and making John smile just a bit.
This bed felt odd. It could’ve been because Sherlock hadn’t had a bed that wasn’t in the hospital in far too long. Waking up next to John was also odd. They had hardly done anything ‘romantic’, but it still far too intimate to be sleeping in his bed.
John didn’t know if he should have jumped to that. He could still love her. She had lied and shot his best friend, but she did care. And she didn’t shoot to kill.
"Tell me about yourself." Sherlock said quietly, feeling a bit strange for asking this type of question.
Why did John even care? It's not like they had a promise to tell each other everything that happens in their life, especially when John couldn't even get the courage to tell Sherlock about the main reason he went out with him to begin with.
John glared at him, "She isn't the only one, you know. The entire school wants to know what's behind Sherlock Holmes."
John could barely handle Sherlock. He was in a constant state of fatigue when Sherlock wasn't around, and when he was John's head felt like it was gonna explode. Maybe it was just because he wasn't used to using it.
Sherlock wasn't in the hallways when John dashed between classes, and he wasn't there glaring John down at the front of the school either. In fact, John didn't see him all day.
He pulled away from John, swinging his feet over the side of the bed. This wouldn’t be okay, this was something that would never be okay.
It was a single bed on the third floor. Shower wasn't awful, nor was the actual bed. He could live with this. Hopefully not for long, but for the night it was manageable. He flopped down on the bed, not bother to dry off or even lay down a towel, his whole body relaxing into the mattress, and his feet unbelievably sore from the walk.
John sighed, leaning back a bit but not relaxing completely, more like he was bracing himself. Good. He should've. He was lucky I didn't throw him out the window. "He wanted to be safe."
we had a deal. You were gonna tell me about him." She crossed her legs and her red poodle skirt fell over them. In a different light, she would be just another girl John was scared to talk to.
Why hadn’t Sherlock told him before? He didn’t even know that there was a murder involved. Though, now that he thought about it, it made sense. Sherlock only seemed this focused when it was a decent murder case.
Sherlock’s face was centimeters away from John’s, their breaths mingling and making stars in the negative space. It was only a matter of time until they crashed together, so why couldn’t it be now?
"And you're hopping back on with me? How lucky am I?" Sherlock grinned, and Finn grinned back. He was glad they were able to joke about shit like this, he didn't how else he would be able to handle it. He knew Finn didn't like be forcefully detoxed and always found a way out of it, but she never lost her sense of humor about the whole thing.
John seemed a bit lost, wandering about by the door, while Sherlock had moved under the covers and pulled them above his head. He didn't know what time it was, but he did know that every bone in his body was calling for sleep.
“I mean… I can’t.” He couldn’t take Sherlock's glare. John stared down at the space between them, at the negative space, only filled by wind and tension.
fuckinf sorry this took so long, it was the end of the school quarter and i’m actually making an effort this year.
"You can leave. Mycroft leaving means his protection goes right along with him. God, he has the morality of a greek god."
John ended up wearing what he wore to school that day, really what he wore to school everyday. He wanted to dress up or look different in any possible way, but his current wardrobe didn't allow it.
John was giggling. Actually giggling, as he pulled Sherlock into his house. The moment the door was shut Sherlock had him against the wall, leaving marks across his neck and jaw. John was out of breath before they even got to the living room.
“Maybe I should decide that myself?” John asked. Was it even a question, really? John didn’t seem to work in questions.
Sherlock kissed John softer than he thought was possible. It made John's stomach flip. Sherlock settled next tohim on the rather large bed.
John brushed his fingers against the car, which had a cherry red paint job, shiny rims, and fender. It was in perfect condition, perfect style.
"You look at me with this light behind your eyes that I've never seen before, and I like to think I'm the source of it."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "You're drifting from the point. Humans always want more, I'm just able to say it."
John took a step forward, his gaze dropping and rising as he looked and analyzed. Sherlock wondered if that’s what he looked like while he deduced.
John hadn't asked too many questions about why Sherlock didn't want to go back to his house. He just called Mycroft and convinced him to give them enough money for a few nights. It helped that John was naturally charming and had a harmless aura about him. Besides, John wasn't the one Mycroft was frustrated with.
Sherlock swore his chest almost opened and wrapped around John in an attempt to pull him closer. His heart almost traveled from his ribcage to John’s just to get out.
He picked up the receiver, and got all the way to putting it to his ear before setting it back down again. He sighed and tapped his fingers on his thigh.
He occasionally told John bits and pieces of his life, late at night when the stars were the loudest thing in the sky. He told him about things he had sought to forget, and John listened to every word. He would sometimes tell Sherlock stories is return, when his own words got too heavy, and Sherlock would fall asleep listening to the hills and valleys in John’s voice.
A part of him was surprised that he wasn't found yet, another part slightly disappointed. He sighed, shut his eyes and willed for his mind to shut off, falling asleep just like that, in a puddle on a cheap hotel bed.
Really, it was all John's fault. He was the one constantly picking fights, he was the one pushing Sherlock, he was the one who made Sherlock chase after him. He always made it hard on Sherlock. He shouldn't be surprised that Sherlock left.
He lifted the receiver and held it tightly in the air letting the first few numbers spin around. He shook his head and slammed it back down.
"Uh…" John shook his head, and shrugged, "I've wanted to go to medical school for as long as I can remember, Harry and I don't get on, haven't in a while, and…" He nodded, "My mom's been gone awhile."
Everyone said Sherlock didn't have a heart, didn't have feelings, but John could see them clearly. He could also see how Sherlock thought they weren't there. He liked the idea of people leaving him alone, but John wasn't too sure if he actually liked being alone. He seemed to like John around. Either that or John really was an idiot.
This is the part he loved. Just before he explained how his head worked, when his chest felt full and his eyes felt bright. When he felt the only power he had rush through his fingertips and legs, and spine.
Sherlock wanted to argue, but he just pushed his face into John's neck, letting himself fall back into whatever state he was in before John woke him up.
"You want to get out of what you think is a shitty life at times, but at the same time you know you shouldn't complain. You don't know how to actually care for someone, or what it feels like to fall for someone. You probably think I'm gonna leave you whenever I 'get what I want.' I assure you, John, I won't."
Sherlock rolled his eyes then kept them fixed on John, watching him attempt to take a drag. John tried to make it look cool, but the moment it hit his throat he could feel a cough coming, and it wasn't long before it came out.
They made it through the door and John went to lead Sherlock to his room. When he had stayed here before he had been shown to a guest room, so being shown right to the master bedroom felt like something almost taboo.
Sherlock sat up properly against the headboard and John could feel a lump in his throat, and he knew that right now Sherlock could crush him. He could demolish everything that  happened between them with the right word. John didn't know if he could survive that.
John was as good as the sun, in Sherlock’s opinion. Just as bright, just as warm. He could hide with John in these cold months and be just fine. He wanted that. Those soft domestic moments where this was all routine. Maybe not even with John, but… Sherlock wouldn’t mind.
John looked around. There was nothing wrong with his room. He kept it neat and tidy, made his bed every morning, cleaned off his desk every night. He had a few movie posters up, and a few comic books strewn about, but besides that everything was normal…plain almost.
The lump in John's throat was fully formed again and John could barely speak around it. Everything hurt again. How could Sherlock make him feel like this over and over again?
"I think I like you." John said quietly. He knew he liked Sherlock, he knew he wanted him at this point, but just saying it felt like something bigger than when it was just in his head. Saying it made it feel real, like this could actually be something.
Sherlock didn’t sleep. He didn’t want to lose this, and he knew if he let himself fall asleep he would’ve. He wanted the day to be longer, time to stretch this moment into an eternity so he could sit here, live here, and never have to be anywhere else.
He didn’t know if he was getting better, but he felt brighter. He had found a ‘job’ at a local police station, helping with smaller cases. He was able to put together profiles more effectively than most others, and he enjoyed the stimulation.
He locked his eyes on me. They were soft, almost melting with the amount of pity behind them. "I can't, Sherlock. You know I can't."
Molly huffed, "You're starting to worry me. You two only knew each other for what? A couple weeks? And it's not like he was your best friend."
John didn't know Sherlock's brother, or his situation well enough to say otherwise, even though every bone in his body wanted to object. He just moved closer, so their knees could knock against each other.
He was used to this bit. The part where he lied his ass off to get out of a situation he wanted to be in. He was used to isolating himself, telling himself it would be better if he left, because most of the time it was.
Sherlock nodded, “Then, thank you. I don’t think anyone’s ever…done something like this for me.” He said, picking up a fork.
"Don't give me a lecture Mr. Damsel-in-Distress." She stuck out her tongue, but it turned into a smile.
He could've gone back inside, but by the time he considered it a cherry red car was in his driveway. John didn't know if he should wait for Sherlock to come to the door or meet him at the car, so he stood awkwardly between them, pulling at the fabric of his pants.
It was pitch black when Sherlock heard a knock on the door. He was somewhat of a light sleeper already, and the added anxiety of Mycroft finding him didn't make it any better.
John was tired. He felt it in every fiber of his being, every breath he took, every time he moved. When he looked in the mirror he could see it in his skin, in his veins. He considered staying home just to get an extra hour of sleep. He could probably get away with it.
Sherlock shook his head lightly, turning to the side. Finn was nodding out at the same time, her head dipping and rising, trying to get a look at John but was mostly unsuccessful. John himself was already getting frustrated.
Molly pursed her lips, as if deciding whether or not she was mad. After a moment she shook her head.
Orange sunlight was slipping through the window, breaking the muted colors of the hotel room. John didn’t object, moving easily under the covers and towards Sherlock.
It was raining and John was stuck with Sherlock. On a case. Why did he agree to this? His shoes were so soaked that he could feel his socks getting damp, and his jumper was forever ruined. Mrs. Hudson would be furious about both of them dripping water onto her carpets.
Mostly silence and small gasps were all that filled the room. John felt blurred around the edges again, like the rest of the world was on fire and he had immunity, like everything finally fit together again.
John was in front of him, grabbing the sides of his face and looking for life. Sherlock wondered if he had any left.
Sherlock chuckled softly. He sat across from John and stared into space for a second, chewing on his lip.
John must've been losing his mind. Sherlock chuckled, and John felt warmth from his face all the way to his fingertips.
"Would you rather me come over to ask about the weather? Maybe your grades, or family troubles." He smashed his cigarette into the side of John's bedframe and hopped off the bed.
John shook his head, his hands still pushing Sherlock away, wishing, pleading that he would leave because if he didn’t, John wasn’t sure he would be able to muster up the courage to do it himself.
Sherlock rose out of the drivers seat with ease and strolled over to John in a black shirt and black washed jeans.
He could still feel the guilt wrapping around his ribs over everything John had given up for him, and everything he would continue to give up, but maybe right now, in this small, small moment, maybe it was okay.
All the facts Sherlock read hit him like bricks. Army, single, unarmed, definitely taking the job for the money, obviously had no clue who Sherlock was.
He probably shouldn't have been this angry. It shouldn't have affected him this much, but god, it didn't do anything.Being locked up for months at a time didn't do anything. Why would he ever want to go back?
Sherlock flicked ash onto the floor, before pulling John back onto his chest, "It's your fault if we get caught."
"Why not, Sherlock? Remember when you were first in my room and you said I felt suffocated? I didn't believe you, but you're right. You're so right." John gripped the sheets around him,
He didn’t know when it became so easy to lie to Molly. Sure, it's not like they made a blood pact, but they were each other's only friends. They told each other everything just because they had no one else to tell.
"Mycroft likes appearances, and I like proving points." Sherlock said, "Hell, I'd take you on this couch if the risk was worth the reward."
"You should've let me handle it!" I yelled and I swore I could hear birds take flight, "You should've let me..." I shook my head and stared into my lap. I hated this. I felt like every piece of my chest was being picked apart, like I was laid out for John to play with. He had complete control over my emotions for the past 24 hours and now that he was back, despite everything being different, nothing had changed. He could still press all my buttons, push tears to the back of my eyes, make my heart and hands tremble. He was still in control of every aspect of me. He always had been, and I was sick of it.
Sherlock looked at the grass, then back to John, and with a small shrug said, "I wanted to see if you'd say yes."
Sherlock had pushed him back onto the bed, and John could smell the smoke on him, on his worn leather and cotton shirt. He destroyed every protest John had, consumed them in an instant. John couldn't breathe, couldn't move.
God, he hadn't even told Sherlock about the dare. Was it a dare really? It wasn't like it was important anyway. It's not like John could fake the whole relationship.
to tell her anything, even though she's always saying how she's worried about me since I'm with you."
Of course, no matter how much John pretended like nothing had happened, there were still the kids who wouldn't shut up about it. Molly being one of them. John heard all the new rumors from her.
The man shuffled from foot to foot, his tongue darting out to brush over his lips, "Excuse me-? Your brother told you about me?"
Sherlock's eyes ran down John's torso. He inhaled and then tugged John until he was snuggled up warm against him.
John shook his head and he could feel Sherlock's arm wrap around his stomach. He had half a mind to slap it away.
John tried not to chuckle. Sherlock really was thin, almost too thin. John could really see it now, since Sherlock wasn't wearing a shirt. (Despite John insisting that he should in case someone walked in.) John could count his ribs through his skin. He wondered what he ate at his house, and if his brother made him meals or not.
He could still hear John and Mycroft bickering over him, (Felt funny, people talking about him while he was so close. He could answer all their questions.) but it felt like he was behind a wall. Wasn't sure what side each of them were on.
