He continues to lavish John’s neck with kisses, now biting and sucking at all the exposed skin his mouth can reach. Sherlock can
“Yes John! Luggage that he never picked up. Must have been killed before he had the chance.”
“You,” Sherlock all but begs, slender fingers clutching at John’s hips.
John steeled himself. “Looking much better,” he lied. “I’m sure you’ll be out of here in no time.” He gave Sherlock what he hoped was a convincing smile.
Once the dressing gown has been appropriately discarded, John climbs back on top of Sherlock and the kissing resumes, this time along with the glorious slide of flesh against flesh, hands roaming through hair, across arms, bellies, chests, thighs.
“Take. Me,” Sherlock growled.
Sherlock clings to John as if his very life depends on his existence. Perhaps it does, John thinks, filing it away for a later discussion.
“Where’s Sherlock?” Lestrade asked, clearly growing more and more impatient by the second.
******
“Sherlock?” John reiterated when the detective didn’t answer his question.
John shifted his head so that his cheek was resting on Sherlock’s shoulder, his nose brushing lightly against the side of his neck. The silk of Sherlock’s robe was soft and cool when it brushed against John’s cheek as they swayed. They were long past the point of doing anything remotely resembling a waltz, and were simply just swaying lazily from side to side.
They laid there for a while, simply watching each other. They seemed to be gravitating towards one another and before John knew it, he could feel Sherlock’s warm puffs of breath ghosting across his face.
Sherlock is tired of being ignored in favor of the dishes—even though it’s usually for no more than fifteen minutes. On this particular evening, he’s decided to actually do something about it.
” John exclaimed, understanding dawning on him. “Who do you love most?”
John and Sherlock glanced at one another, bursting into a fit of laughter the second their eyes made contact.
left, John.”
“Hmm? Ah, with this,” Sherlock said, triumphantly holding up a hotel key labeled ‘room twenty-one.’
Moriarty stopped on the middle of the bridge, turning to grin wickedly at Sherlock.
“I think Sherlock was a good man,” John said, suddenly feeling inexplicably defensive.
“Wallet.” Sherlock repeated, extending his hand palm up towards John.
“Okay.” John paused, considering for a moment before saying, “do you want a hug?”
At one point, Sherlock ends up pressed in-between a wall and John’s body and he slumps forward into John and mumbles something into his neck.
A few moments later, there was a creak followed by a gasp that could barely be heard over the volume of the music. John and Sherlock pulled away from each other almost instantaneously, like two opposing magnets repelled by one another.
Sherlock jumped off his chair, striding to where John stood in a matter of steps. “Why didn’t you just say so?”
John shifted uncomfortably, readjusting his jacket to cover his lap. He noticed Sherlock doing the same thing before he distractedly re-told—more like bragged—the story of how he’d solved the case and much to John’s relief, left out a number of details involving mouths touching and a rather obvious lack of clothing.
“John!” Sherlock bellowed from his more than comfortable perch on his chair.
He let his gaze wander lazily across the floor until it reached a pair of shoes. John blinked. His eyes moved up the attached legs, past the flowing coat to the glorious mess of dark curls. John’s heart nearly leapt straight out of his chest.
“Moriarty said this is all about who you love, right?” John asked.
******
******
“Hug me,” Sherlock said.
In an attempt to avoid passing out from the emotional whiplash he’d just experienced, John tried to focus on feeling the steady rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest with every breath he took. Because he was very much alive. Only the living breathe, John reminded himself.
” John breathes, and Sherlock hums, the sound vibrating against John’s hand and sending all his blood rushing southwards.
Neither one made any attempt to extricate themselves from the embrace, and so they sat there—tangled on the floor while Sherlock slowly stopped shaking in fear from his nightmare, his breathing returning to normal—for what could have been hours.
Sherlock gave him a small, sad smile. “I’m sorry John. That’s not possible. Believe me, if it were–”
Sherlock snapped. He stormed back in and shouted “he’s not coming back! He’ll never come back! He’s gone! Forever!” He yelled and yelled and yelled until Rosie began to cry and then he yelled some more because it felt
“Be safe,” John said, then crept out of the hallway and began to make his way around the man.
Before Sherlock could process what was happening, John had thrown himself at Sherlock, wrapping his arms tightly around him. Sherlock froze like he’d just been turned to stone, unsure what to do with the sudden intimate contact.
“What?”
When they finally pull back flushed, breathless and panting for air, Sherlock speaks. “I promise to never let you out of my sight again.”
“Christ, Sherlock,” John said. “Are you coming or not?”
Sherlock squirmed under John’s hands, but he held fast, making sure they were angled just so, so that Sherlock’s face wasn’t visible to anyone from the lobby. Judging by the slightly disturbed looks on the faces of the four men as they glanced in their direction, it was clear that this was certainly the best way to ensure the men didn’t bother them. Meanwhile, Sherlock was
his mind told him. His bloody experiments. His chair. His bed. His memories. For the first time, John wished he could have a mind like Sherlock’s, so he could imprint their time together permanently into his mind. He’d never want to leave it.
"Let's just get out of this place." John quickly said; changing the subject.
John didn't even try to break free.
"I'm not technically supposed to, but... Come on. I'll take you to him."
But how? He would only laugh in the face of pain.
John wheeled himself out to the car and had help to get inside.
Trying to mentally convince himself that everything would be fine, Sherlock hesitantly laid down beside him.
"I went to sleep, and I had a... a really messed up nightmare. When I woke up, I could still hear Moriarty, and I
Another text. This one read, "And now he's actually sobbing. Aww, I almost feel bad."
"Wipe that god awful smirk off your face."
Annoying him would be the first step.
"Sherlock, maybe this case isn't worth the effort."
"S-sorry."
"I sure hope you're right about this, doc."
The laughter became crazed and maniacal, and John heard the sound of the mirror smashing.
"Talk?!" Sherlock nearly screamed at him. "He wants to TALK?! I should MURDER that man!!"
John sighed a bit.
"Yes, please!"
"What is it...?"
"You sure?"
Sherlock smiled weakly.
"Because you actually listened to me for once and I'm glad you'll be alright."
John started to blush again.
"Mycroft?"
Sherlock looked up at the night sky above them. "Isn't it beautiful?"
John started to wake up a bit.
"I'm only telling the truth. You were too late, Doctor."
"What are you waiting for..."
"Now wouldn't that be interesting." Sherlock replied with a small smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. "John, hand me my phone."
He began to dream.
with John Watson." Sherlock replied determinedly.
Sherlock stared down at his shoes as he limped along beside him.
... Had I... not tensed up, would you have...?"
"We'll find out soon enough."
" he smirked then fired the gun.
Watson nodded for her to leave.
"I tried to kill him while he was asleep once. Does that count as talking to him about it?"
John hoped Sherlock would find out soon.
"Dammit, Lestrade!" Sherlock shouted. "Why did you drag me inside?"
"What if I don't want to be safe?"
"Understood. I'll see what I can do."
"Tell me," Sherlock demanded.
But he had done so under the impression, however possibly false, that doing so would benefit John.
He began to worry more about Sherlock.
"Sherlock?"
It was Sherlock's phone that received the call. The person on the other end, a voice John didn't recognize, asked, "Is Mr. Holmes there?"
But he had already learned that Mycroft's assistance couldn't be bought.
"Not in town unfortunately."
John curled up a bit on the couch as he slept.
It didn't take long for him to realize that the victim was none other than Molly Hooper, the shy young woman that worked in the morgue at the Scotland Yard and had a blatantly obvious (to everyone but Sherlock) crush on Sherlock.
"I swear, he just can't stop getting into trouble, can he? I'm taking my men to check on him. I'll report to you on what we find. Call an ambulance, will you?"
"Take me to him."
John blushed even more.
He took his hand away from his hair.
"Brutally sexually assaulted you. You almost died again."
"I trust you," she told him, taking his hands in hers.
"J-... John...?"
"I'll shoot you too, Sherlock. I mean it."
"Please, don't!" He shouted. "Just show me who you are. Why are you
John got into the taxi.
"Let's try to go back to sleep."
John soon passed out from blood loss.
"Do you realize what you've done, showing up here?" Mary shouted at him.
He gulped a bit and quickly told a doctor what had happened.
“John, please.
, so you may as well stop doing it, you stupid git. Hear me?”
, if you let them.” He stretched to his full length before rolling onto his stomach and folding his arms under the pillow, his face still turned toward his husband. “Best to let them move into the past and deal with ‘right now’, and ‘right now’, I’m alive and in love with the finest man I’ve ever known.”
Because it’s Sherlock. And Sherlock never does things by halves. Therefore, full-on snit.
“Why, Mr. Holmes. I have no reason for your presence here. Whatever could you mean?” Her voice sounded shocked but Sherlock knew it was feigned. As she walked closer he could hear the creak of her leather boots and the light slapping sound of a riding crop, Irene’s favorite instrument for conducting her “therapeutic scolding” sessions.
Lestrade had once wagered me, at a murder scene, that, in his opinion, there was an afterlife and that the murder victim was probably standing right beside up yelling the perpetrator’s name into our deaf ears. I scoffed at him and he wagered me a fiver that he was right. I accepted and asked to which dimension should I send his winnings. He laughed and said, “You’ll see” and that was it. It had seemed like nothing at the time but, at this very moment, it had made

She smiled uncertainly. “That’s very true, dear. I lived my life with a lot of evil people, and I made a lot of mistakes, but, thanks to you two, some of them have been…
It didn’t take long. Sherlock was able to deduce that the crime was one of expediency, the wife and lover of the murdered man having hired someone to eliminate him from the equation. His cash was still in his wallet, which ruled out robbery. The knife attack had been from the front and there were no defensive wounds, so the victim had recognized and felt at ease with the killer, indicating an individual already known and possibly welcomed. Two sets of footprints in the gravel and wet pavement around the body, one leaving at speed and one leading to nowhere, indicating a car was waiting nearby, and blah blah blah…
“You’re gorgeous,” he blurted out, being the unrefined, country doctor that he was, just before he slapped his hand over his mouth in horror.

I became so angry with myself that I took a thoughtless, though completely intentional, swing at a cup poised precipitously on the edge of a table. I fully expected to move right through it, simply using it as the target of my anger.

Sherlock’s smile broadened in a way that told Lestrade he was in for it. However, before Sherlock could open his mouth, Lestrade lifted the crime tape and ushered both of them under it.
“God help me, I’ve created a monster,” John faux-lamented, as he turned off the burners and prepared to put the food on some nearby plates. There was a deep chuckle behind him that he could feel vibrating through his back.
“I’ve never denied it, John. I

A small, defiant voice in my head said, “Make me.”
“John, please,” Sherlock said, calmly, as he presented the guard with a card. “If you will call this gentleman and identify us, I’m sure he can put this all into perspective and our expulsion from the park will be unnecessary.”

learn how to manage your personnel.”
There were no words to describe it. The first day that John saw Sherlock back in a suit was one of the best days of his life. True, he was still a little underweight, so the tailored suit was a tad loose, but, all in all, he looked killer. All day long, John couldn’t wipe the stupid grin off his face.
“Oh.” Sherlock sighed, his eloquent silver eyes seeking the ceiling. “Apples and oranges, John.
The officer looked at Sherlock suspiciously. “And you are…?”
He noticed that Sherlock had slid wordlessly across the room to stand at the arm of John’s chair.
I stood close behind John, observing. I certainly wasn’t going to solve it for them. This was meant as training for John, who may know my methods but was, by no means, their master. “Come on, John, you have the same information at your fingertips as I had. Check your file.”
life that isn’t some elitist judgement?”
John was not a great typist, so it was fortunate that the GPS tracker program had a user-friendly interface that allowed him to set the system in motion with a minimum of fuss. When the ping was finally triangulated to a location, John had expected to see that Sherlock was at St. Bart’s or NSY. Instead, the phone pinged off a tower located near a string of bars known for their seediness and penchant for creating corpses. John swore softly as he got up to check the coat rack behind the door. No, the belstaff was definitely gone, so Sherlock couldn’t possibly be in disguise as a drug addict or derelict, two of his favorite costumes for undercover work. The coat was far too posh and unmistakable to wear on
He moaned to himself.
, Sherlock?” he demanded, angrily. “You didn’t tell me that!”
Sherlock smiled enigmatically. His seatmate didn’t like it for some reason and struck him in the face with the pistol butt at short quarters. “I don’t like you,” he said, with an unpleasant growl. “I don’t like your

“Yup. I am wrapping you up so you feel warm and cared for. Once that has occurred, I will feed you tea and sandwiches until you are properly fed and hydrated, at which time we will watch a silly movie until you have regained your normal sensibilities.”
John came first, as Sherlock’s insertions had provided steady friction to his swollen, beleagered prostate. Thick ropes of cum shot out of his huge cock, decorating his chest in abstract forms as he cried out in pleasure. The orgasmic spasms of his anus milked Sherlock’s erection as he kept shoving it into John until he, too, erupted, the muscles of his gangly form clenching and unclenching in sequence as his emissions were wrung from him and deposited deep inside his lover. They clung to each other in wordless, gutteral ecstasy until the spasms passed and their erections faded, at which point they collapsed into a nerveless heap of drowsy bliss.
“Not judging from the tabloids. You’re the Second Coming in a deerstalker hat”
“Missed. Lousy shot, not a serious attempt,” Sherlock mumbled.

Lestrade’s phone rang. “Lestrade here, what is it?” He shushed John with a wave of a hand, then yelled, “WHAT? Say that again!”
There was the sound of tumbling bodies, followed by someone kicking the door shut.
“He spilled ice water on me, John. I wasn’t prepared for that. Besides, now I look like I’ve had an accident in the loo. I have to sit here until it dries.”
Outside the suite, an elevator dinged and a commotion spilled out into the front room of the suite. “Ambulance!”
“In that case, I’ll be alone for the rest of my life, John. Would you wish
care?”
“He’s saved me, time and time again, Mycroft,” Sherlock replied, tersely.
The bruiser stirred and sat up, taking in his surroundings. One of the men in the ring stepped in to rifle his pockets, disregarding his noisy protests. In one of his pants pockets he found Sherlock’s phone, which John had had engraved for him after they had started dating as a gift. Sherlock never let it out of his sight after that. The man wordlessly handed it to Wiggins with a kind of reverence, and Wiggins passed it on to John.
Sherlock abruptly released him, allowing him to wander out of the derelict old building. As he passed the open car door, he heard Anthea hiss, “You’re an

Sherlock looked mildly offended. “Not at all, John! Male dancers are not uncommon, they just dress and move a little differently. Mariyah has been teaching me...” without warning, Sherlock performed a perfect belly roll, both up and down, followed by a hip shimmy, “a great many things about male dance.”
A pause. “No. I wasn’t in the mood for company.”
Another chuckle. “Look who’s talking. I learned at the foot of the Master.”
>>>***<<<
Sherlock’s hand moved from my head to my hand, enclosing it between his two.
A few minutes later, Sherlock returned downstairs. He paused at the doors, as if trying to decide which one to use; return to the parlor for a further, probably disastrous discussion, or go through the kitchen and into the sweet asylum of his bedroom.
Sherlock leaned toward John and used his hand, thumb and finger touching, to punctuate his words. “Que...s'est-il...passé, Jean?”
,” Sherlock gasped, pulling John toward him by the hips.
intend to become so involved. Now, if you would be so kind as to remove yourselves from our doorway, my husband was about to molest me in the most shocking manner possible, which I will undoubtedly enjoy, so, if you don’t mind…” He indicated the hallway with an elegant sweep of his hand.
John pulled back, his mouth opening and closing like a fish. Finally, he was able to say, “Why would
“Stop it.”
Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson. Lestrade. You’re all going down.
“John? Shall we?” Sherlock rumbled, throwing a towel debonairly over his shoulder and wincing.
“Half-assed job; again, not a serious attempt.”
“I’m OK, Sherlock. Bitch hit me across the face with her crop, then pistol-whipped me. Got blood in my eyes and one of them’s swollen shut.” John’s voice was right beside the bed. Sherlock could feel his hands groping for him. Short sensitive fingers were touching, appraising, catalogueing his injuries. “Jesus Christ, Sherlock, what did she do to you? I can’t see…”
The server carefully picked up the vase and carried it gingerly into a serving area, still wearing the same look of fright and disbelief as before.
“What is it?” John asked, still somewhat red-faced in anger.
Our lips parted and, as I slipped into a well-needed sleep, I heard him say, “I love you, John Watson. Always have, always will.”
“So, what happened, Daddy?” she asked, coyly.
“A great deal, I should think,” Sherlock replied. “Alcohol is a commonly-used sedative and pain-reliever for those with emotional issues.” He cocked his head to the side and noted, “Not that it is of any more use in numbing existential pain than drugs are, but at least you never became an all-out alcoholic.”
The obvious question leapt to mind without conscious thought.
The evening was cool but comfortable for only a jacket. John had paced the streets and parks around Baker Street for well over an hour before deciding to stop into a local pub. He wasn’t especially well-known there, so he was able to sit at the bar in relative anonymity. It’s
“The caliber of law enforcement doesn’t change with location, John. They are all low-level morons with a badge who can’t see what is clearly standing in front of them,” Sherlock replied, calmly. “I am not here to make up for their deficiencies.”
“There are sixteen more to go…”
“Sort of like someone we know,” John quipped again.
Sherlock laconically held up his phone for John to see. On it was displayed an image of Della, sitting almost on top of John, kissing him, with one hand underneath the table in a spot that required no imagination whatsoever. John wilted. Shit…

Suppressing a laugh, Sherlock said, straight-faced, “Of course not, Fleur! I know you are perfectly competent to bathe yourself! I’m just here to help.”
“Drove his oldest child away because of his violence and hatred of her so-called ‘lifestyle’. She is now a divorced alcoholic under treatment with the NHS. He, then, attempted to ‘beat the gay’ out of his youngest child, causing said child to accept admittance to the first medical program that would accept him.”
The comforter suddenly flew off Sherlock’s face and he snarled, “What sort of half-arsed, ill-considered treatment is this? Trying to crush me to death under your not-inconsiderable weight and smother me with blankets?” He threw the comforter back over his head again without awaiting an answer.
“I thought we weren’t on a case, Sherlock…”
brought forth a new round of cursing from John.
Sergei would return, from time to time, sometimes turning on the light, sometimes not, all to keep them disoriented. He would offer the phone, which Sherlock would refuse, with predictable results. John seemed to get the bulk of the ‘encouragement’ when the lights were on, while Sherlock got them when the lights were off.

“Papa?” A small hand was laid upon his shoulder in inquiry.
Sherlock surged forward in his chair, turned his body sharply toward John, and yelled, fiercely, “DO NOT FAULT THEM FOR YOUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS, JOHN!”
looked at other men the same way he looked at John, and it made John feel 6 feet tall. After they had chosen two chairs together for their towels, they both sat in the shallow end of the pool, where there were seating ledges in the shade.
A muscle jumped in the older man’s cheek. “Mr. Holmes, I’m here to determine if you are involved in a case involving this division.”
Sherlock snorted quietly before responding, icily, “Thank you.” Yet, he didn’t move. He just sat and stared, his face unreadable. John didn’t meet his eyes. Instead, he sat down at the table and began opening containers.
“What can I do to make you feel like I love you and care about your well-being, love?” he reiterated. His voice was soft and one hand reached out to stroke the mass of dark curls that had escaped the top of the comforter.
Blink blink. “Oh.” Blink. “Not necessary...”
I’m going to kill you, Mrs. Hudson. If I survive this, I am going to kill you. And Sherlock. I’ll make it a two-for-one special.
“Thank you, Angelo,” Sherlock nodded. With one hand, he indicated that John should sit with his back to the window while Sherlock took the side wall seat. Rosie occupied the space in the corner, between them.

It felt so good, just lying there, all snug and toasty, but his bladder would not be denied. So, with a bleary head and a heartfelt groan, John threw back the covers and tried to exit the bed.
To my surprise, he grabbed my face in his hands and kissed me square on the lips. Not that I complained, mind you. He pulled back, surprised, as the reality hit him. “You’re real...I can touch you...how?”

When Mycroft opened it, a ceramic heart paperweight, with the word “Brother”, fell out into his hand.

Deep, resigned sigh from the bedroom. “If we must.”
Mrs Hudson entered the parlor, followed by Sherlock bearing a steeping teapot and three china cups on a teak tray. He set it down on the kitchen table and began pouring out the golden-brown elixer of life the British called ‘tea’. He handed cups to Mrs. Hudson and John before taking up his own and venturing a sip.
He finally lifted his eyes up to meet Sherlock’s. “It got worse from there, Sherlock. My father...he turned his attentions to me.”
Sherlock relaxed, releasing his pent-up anxiety with a sigh. “Satisfactory. I choose the subject matter.”

It was the only way I would have tolerated such a passage, under the circumstances.

A sharp rap on the door got their attention. Sherlock’s eyebrow rose. “Don’t answer it, John.”
A big grin spread across Sherlock’s face. “Just like old times.”

John shrugged. “We’re not going anywhere anytime soon anyway, Sherlock. This is an upscale restaurant. The wait is proportionate to the reputation. Besides, it’s free, so who cares?”
Eyes lowered, Sherlock turned slowly in his crouched position to look at John, who was obviously gobsmacked by his child’s accusation. When their eyes finally met, John promptly looked away.
She smiled, one-eyed, up at him. Shampoo dripped down the other side. “You know, Papa, I don’t want to be called Rosie anymore.”

Sherlock’s arms slid around John’s body, holding him as close as humanly possible. Their legs intertwined as they kissed and nuzzled each other, the sheet providing a layer of chastity that neither one seemed to mind.

Outside there was a faint popping sound, like a car backfiring, except it came in bursts.

“What?” John jerked in surprise. “How…?”

Another sound, this one more disturbing. Someone was
“Stupid,” John muttered to himself as he wandered through the darkened streets of London, unsure of where he was or where he was going. “I should have accepted that ride back. I got no idea where I am.” He leaned against a street sigh and waved. “Taxi!” he yelled, but several in a row passed him by. He harrumphed to himself in irritation. Sherlock always made it look so easy. Then again, Sherlock is tall, good-looking, and dresses like a toff, so expectations of a good tip are high. John dressed like an everyman who didn’t have an extra pound to buy a pint.

Furiously, Lestrade turned to his men. “Who took the witness accounts?” he yelled.
John blew air out through his nose. “Nothing,” he said, peevishly. He forcefully shoved the drawer closed, pushing himself away from it at the same time. “Nothing important.” With that, he strode out of the bedroom, his slippers making flapping sounds in his haste.
John and Sherlock's situation only get worse...
Sherlock’s eyebrows congressed. “What? What are you…?” A light suddenly went off behind his eyes.
Sherlock could find him here if he
“Yeah, I know. When it’s being done by someone you love...God, it’s the best fucking feeling!”
“Oi, missus, mind your own business next time,” John chortled, and her face turned red.
He reached up to brush some unruly curls away from Sherlock’s forehead. “You need a haircut again.”

A shake of a dark, curly-haired head. “No, thank you, Mycroft. I think I’ve imposed upon you enough for one night. Again, thank you for finding John. I think I’ll take over from here.” He walked out the same way John did, only a bit slower. As he passed the open car door, he heard a light, feminine voice say, “Good luck! He’s a stubborn one.”
In the background they could hear the guard having a conversation with someone in a

Lestrade slapped John on the back and said, “You don’t have to, John, that’s the best part! You two are soulmates, haven’t you figured that out yet? You will always find each other again, throughout eternity.”
“I love you, you know,” John murmured into his flatmate’s ear.
Finally, Sherlock unfolded his long limbs from his low chair and, walking quietly over to the twin doors into the hallway, closed them both with a barely-audible >click<. John paused for a second or two, his eyes shifting to where he knew Sherlock must be standing without quite making it there. Then he resumed dishing out food onto two plates.

I grinned mischievously at him. “Of course. Now, help me move John on out. Each one of you, grab a wrist and I’ll grab his feet.”
Sherlock smiled expectantly. “I’m not in the least surprised. Please,
me before you do something like that!”
“No problem,” Sherlock rumbled in his deep baritone. “I’ve had worse.” He lifted his hand to the back of his head. “Still have a bit of a headache, though. Thank God for the rug and the wood floor.”
John released one hand and, reaching over, picked up a mug, and pressed it into Sherlock’s now-free hand. He then released the other arm he had been holding prisoner. He watched as Sherlock loosened up that arm and then held his mug of tea with both hands, sipping quietly. His head was down but his eyes flicked up to meet John’s. He was still sulky. He took another sip of tea and remarked, “You remembered the sugar.”
“Yeah. You and me against the world.”

Normally, Sherlock wouldn’t ask John for input. He would just throw on clothes, jump in a cab, and be whisked to NSY with John in tow. It was a sign that his confidence wasn’t yet completely restored, that he still relied on John for support.
Sherlock chuckled to himself. John was always
“Je t'aime aussi, mon petit soldat.”
“FINE! GET IN MY BLOODY LAP!”
“He is stable, Sherlock. The doctor said so, and he is the top of his field. It was fortunate that he was on duty when you all arrived after the accident. He was able to perform surgery quickly to relieve the pressure on his brain.”

John stirred, his hand splaying flat against Sherlock’s chest. “Hmmhm? Sherlock?” he responded, groggily. He raised himself on one elbow and smiled up at his friend. “How you doing?”
The Imperial Guards marched the tall man dressed in white, with the dark, curly hair, into the bridge of the massive star battleship. His face was a mask of indifference, but his sharp silver eyes took in everything around him. Occasionally, one of them would push him along, only to receive a poisonously-annoyed look and a muttered, “Idiot!” in return.

The GetBox buzzed as I said, “Love you”.
“I don’t deserve him.” The words were bitter in John’s mouth, like hemlock with a lime chaser. “I never
I nodded my head. “Hello, Uncle Rudy,” I said, barely suppressing a smile.
“Yes, always the germophobe. Fastidious to a fault, Mycroft,” Sherlock observed, without rancor. He stood tall and without fear. “So, what are we to do now, Brother? I am, once again, your prisoner. What is it to be this time?”
“Where’s Rosie? Is she with you?” she asked. “I brought her some milk and cookies but she isn’t in her bed.” She hefted the plate as she spoke.
John turned around to face the homeless network. “Do any of you know of a nice, private place where I can blow this wanker’s face off without interruption?”

For not the first time in his life, Sherlock felt like a complete idiot. He rarely took note of the behaviors of the female of the species unless it related to a case, and yet this little girl had spotted it clearly.

what I had to do.
John crossed the room, took up the case, and opened it. Inside was a group of wrapped, disposable syringes with needles attached, a tournequet, some packaged alcohol wipes, and a pre-prepared vial of solution. John nodded. “At least, you’re careful.”
I need to put everything I have into projecting that thought into that incredible brain of his, the one that doesn’t miss anything.
I half-turned and snarked, “Well, if you and Lestrade wouldn’t mind giving me a hand here. John is nothing if not persistent!”

Shaking his head, his entire expression screaming “Philistine!”, Sherlock said, “Why don’t you go get yourself a drink and sit down, John?”

“Your doing, John. Everyone else lost their heads, except you. Without your expertise, she might have bled to death before the emergency personnel reached her.” There was unmistakable pride in Sherlock’s voice that made John blush just a little.
There was a mostly-finished bottle of whiskey next to him and a shattered short tumbler in the fireplace. Jamming the clip into place, he held it up to his head and whispered, “I’m coming, Sherlock...”
“I know,” John said softly, his heart hurting so badly for this man that he loved so dearly. “I’m here, Sherlock. I’m going to help you through this. You don’t have to do it alone.” He scooted behind Sherlock without touching him and kissed the back of his head through his hair. “I love you, you beautiful, otherworldly creature.” He felt his fingers being squeezed in reply.

“You will only talk to him to ask him questions, and if I don’t like the answers, I will take it out on one of you.
“You can ask her yourself tomorrow, when we get back,” John said, as he stood. He walked over to his husband and removed the note from his still-clenched fist. “I’m sure she had a reason, Sherlock. Maybe she didn’t want

Sherlock blinked, his eyes glazing over slightly as though his brain had just undergone a massive malfunction and subsequently experienced a temporary shut down. Just as soon as it had appeared, the look was gone, replaced by the usual visage Sherlock wore, hiding his feelings from the world. Only John had been lucky enough to be offered the occasional, treasured glimpse at what was hidden behind the mask. He quite liked what he saw there.
“It’s alright,” John assured, setting the book down and moving closer to his side. The cardiac monitor blipped in protest as Sherlock’s pulse elevated.
Sherlock glanced up at John, confusion clearly written across his features. “Are you feeling alright, John?”
“I just– I don’t want– What if–” Sherlock sighs, his head dropping a fraction.
The feeling of pure, unadulterated
“You never told the paramedics that!”
John quirks an eyebrow. This is new. Well, Sherlock telling him how to write his blog is not by any means new, but he’s never done it in such a
“Mrs. Hudson, I suppose. I love her like family.”
“That’s fine then, I’ll just call Lestrade. Get him to pop down, and we’ll be on our way,” John said with forced cheerfulness.
******
John supposes this should scare him a bit—it is a tad too protective, after all—but instead it ignites something deep in his belly, causing him to tip forwards and capture Sherlock’s lips with his with a sense of renewed fervor.
It was a chilly winter evening. Mrs. Hudson had dropped off tea earlier at two twenty-one b for John and Sherlock and had made sure to tell them ‘you boys better bundle up tight tonight, it’s going to get cold out there,’ before heading off to bed herself.
By mid-afternoon, John insisted that Sherlock at least try to eat some reheated soup that Mrs. Hudson had brought up with the tea earlier that morning, saying ‘nothing heals like my chicken soup recipe, so eat up dear!’
John sighs. “I’m fine, Sherlock. But I’m. Not. Breathing.” He punctuates every word in hopes understanding will dawn on Sherlock.
His eyes shot wide open then, and he shouted, “soft hands! That’s it John! I’ve solved it!”
“I’m sorry?”
“I’m sorry.”
Still no response.
“Is that–?”
“I’m locked in here with the smartest, most brilliant man in all of England, I think we can figure something out,” John insisted.
This was
The chair. It still
“Excuse me?” John addressed the cabbie. “Could you please turn the heat up?”
******
John let himself enjoy the feeling of his fingers running through Sherlock’s hair until his soft smile was instantaneously removed from his face. They were stopped in some traffic and the taxi driver was currently looking
“What is it?” Sherlock asked from directly behind John, making him jump in surprise.
“Think I could’ve figured that out myself,” John shoots back.
“Hmm?” Sherlock hummed and shut his eyes as another shiver wracked through his body.
“Oh no,” Lestrade said. “It’s him?”
“I know. I’ve never seen him look like this.”
John let his hand fall to rest dangerously close to the dark curls of Sherlock’s hair. He considered his options. He supposed it could be considered part of the experiment if he just–
“I’m not sure,” John said, glancing around the police station as if Sherlock would magically appear at any moment. “He wandered off some time ago. Said he had something to see to. You know how he is.”
John swallowed. Took a breath. Pinched his arm. Pinched it again, just to be sure. In a flash, he shot from the bed, tripping across the floor as the sheets wound around his legs.
Thankfully, the footsteps receded quite quickly, followed by the sound of the door clicking shut, leaving them alone once more—thankfully the man must not have come close enough to see Sherlock’s face. His fingers still dug into John’s hips, sure to leave bruises in their wake.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up. “Baker street!” he shouted and all but vaulted into the street to hail a cab.
He procured his phone from his pocket, and within a few taps, found quite quickly that there was no service. John glanced up at Sherlock, who quickly averted his gaze.
John will stand, let out a hideously contented sigh and stretch with his arms high above his head, the hem of his jumper lifting just high enough for Sherlock to glimpse the softness of his middle. He’ll lean down and press a kiss to Sherlock’s temple. Then the most awful thing always happens, time and time again without fail.
There was no fooling the great Sherlock Holmes. John unclenched his hand and stuffed it under his leg.
Sherlock’s heart pounded in his chest, begging to be set free from the confines of the jail cell that was his rib cage. He found he was struggling to breathe—how unpleasant—and was stricken with the inexplicable feeling of his heart being torn to shreds, stomped on and thrown away, with the whole process in a constant cyclical repeat.
John’s vision blurred slightly and he stumbled forwards a few steps. His
“Goodnight Sherlock,” John says.
“I was saying–” Sherlock continues talking, but both John’s eyes and mind can’t help but drift to more salacious thoughts.

This time, there was no gang of assassins. No ruse to keep up. No false pretenses.
John figured Sherlock must be quite sick if he was going so far as to actually thank him.
“I want to see him,” Sherlock announced.
******
“We have to stay awake,” Sherlock said, his breath warm where it ghosted against John’s cheek.
“You too,” John says, and he’s not really quite sure why he says it, but he does all the same. And of course, Sherlock complies.
is your plan?” he squeaked.
that way– Sherlock, are you paying any attention?”
“You– you’re not–” John managed to splutter despite his shock-addled brain, gesturing wildly from Sherlock to the corpse and back again.
“What is it that we’re looking for, exactly?” John asked, turning around just in time to see Sherlock staring down an orange left behind on the counter before shaking his head and moving on.
“You’re not mad, you’re
“What?”
“John,” Sherlock gasped, having enough sense to look rather scandalized.
“Sherlock,” John repeated. “Fifteen minutes. We’re running out of time.”
“Yes, as you’ve said. And I was actually planning on going to bed following the proceedings of this experiment but now it seems I don’t have a bed.” Sherlock pauses, studying his bed for a moment. “Well, a usable one,” he amends.
“Your little pet couldn’t keep up?” Moriarty crooned.
“Tea?” he asked, glancing into the sitting room where Sherlock was already wrapped into a ball on his chair, head buried somewhere beneath his coat.
“Warm enough?”
John has to force himself to breathe lest Sherlock think he were dead again. He swallows. Lets out a shaky breath. Shuts his eyes. The hand pauses for a moment before continuing its ministrations across John’s skin. The hand is abruptly removed and John is saddened by the sudden loss of contact, but not for long, as he soon finds himself with an armful of Sherlock.
John startled awake what was likely a few hours later, judging by the moonlight streaming in through the windows of the flat. Sherlock was still curled up against John’s side, his dark curls tickling John’s cheek where they brushed against it. John gently attempted to extricate himself from the tangle of Sherlock’s limbs without waking him.
“No, I’m alright. Just need a good nights sleep.”
John took a sip of his tea before setting the mug down on the side table and returning his full attention to the newspaper. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sherlock flitting around the flat, his silken housecoat flowing dramatically out behind him. He paused to scribble something in a notebook at the cluttered kitchen table, then turned with a dramatic
******
“Making sure I’m breathing?”
“Wouldn’t say it’s a pleasure, dear.”
Sherlock’s hands rose up to grip at John’s waist and John let out an involuntary sigh at the action. He gripped at the lapels of Sherlock’s Belstaff, quite sure that that—along with Sherlock’s weight pressing them against the door of the flat—was currently the only thing holding him up and keeping him from crumpling into a boneless heap on the floor. Sherlock’s mouth moved from John’s lips to his jaw, then neck as he continued his ministrations with those glorious lips and tongue and teeth.
The figure stopped backing away, swaying tentatively in the doorway.
“Looks like someone bashed it in pretty good. Not sure with what yet.” Anderson paused for a moment before turning to John. “I am sorry.”
He had to leave. Now. John couldn’t find him here, he couldn’t–
“No!” Sherlock thundered and pushed with the remainder of his strength.
“Of course,” John said, leading him over to one of the occupied tables and pulling back the white sheet a fraction.
“You are nothing like me.”
everything.
No matter. Sherlock has never been known to give up easily when he wants something. And he
John reached up and, not wanting to disturb Sherlock’s privacy, tentatively knocked on the door. The whimpers stopped almost instantly, turning instead to muffled sniffles that John was sure Sherlock thought he couldn’t hear.
Sherlock winced as he turned the key, the lock mechanism clicking loudly as it opened.
“Sorry,” he apologized. “So sorry.”
John paced around the kitchen as he waited for the water to boil in an attempt to free his muscles from the stiffness they were currently being incapacitated by.
When John is satisfied with how thoroughly kissed Sherlock looks, he begins to make his way down his neck to his chest, then belly, and then lower yet. Sherlock gasps and mumbles an unintelligible string of words which may be curses, praise, or declarations of love. To be honest, John would be quite fine with any of those. Sherlock finally stills and John halts his ministrations, glancing up briefly through his eyelashes to make sure the man is still alive. The sight he’s met with makes John’s breathing stutter and he pauses for a moment from the steady rhythm he’s created with his mouth and tongue: Sherlock is biting down on the back of his hand, his entire body trembling.
positively mad with rage. Before John has any time to react, Martin is throwing his entire body at John and then they’re both tumbling over the edge and into the frigid water of the Thames.
Sherlock’s hips snap upwards and he lets out a low groan, pressing against John.
Sherlock flops down on the couch and John wonders who gave him the right to look so gorgeous, all splayed out like that, his limbs a glorious mess of harsh, unforgiving angles. He unbuttons his shirt, opens it and says “touch me, John,” and John instantly knows he’s in major trouble, because he probably shouldn’t feel like
“Of course not,” Sherlock said, trying to keep Moriarty talking.
Baker Street was simply not the same. Not since Eurus. Not since Mary’s death. Not since Rosie’s birth. It really hadn’t been quite the same since John and Mary had gotten married, he supposed. Actually, perhaps it had been the fall that had truly changed everything.
It seemed John also returned said aforementioned feelings of camaraderie. Intriguingly, from what little he could remember about their adventures together, when Sherlock said to jump, John simply asked
Once John has relieved himself, he makes his way into the kitchen and puts the kettle on to make tea. He wanders around the sitting room while he waits for the water to boil and eventually finds himself making his way to the desk where his laptop is unsurprisingly nowhere to be found. Yet Sherlock’s laptop—which he rarely uses, as for some unknown reason, John’s seems to be far more suitable—sits out, the lid half open, just begging to be opened. John does just that.
******
“Take my hand,” Sherlock says, and though John can’t see his face, he can hear a hint of a grin in the detective’s voice.
“Sorry to meet under such awful circumstances,” John said, flashing the man a sympathetic smile.
“Still don’t need anything, Sherlock.” Then at the look of utter dejection on Sherlock’s face, John adds, “I’m fine, really Sherlock.”
******
Mycroft glared at him with an iciness that seemed to fill the room, making it feel even colder than it was.
“But why?”
John flexed the fingers of his left hand, curled them into a fist. Clenched his jaw. Repeated the process. It couldn’t be him, could it? Sherlock was smart. Smart enough to avoid getting murdered. Wasn’t he? He
Sherlock finally released John, sitting up to look just slightly to the left of his eyes—due to his profound embarrassment, he absolutely refused to look John in the eye. To John’s surprise, he found Sherlock was actually
The following few weeks are comprised of heated gazes, lingering touches, considerably closer proximity at crime scenes—at a particularly gruesome one, they even allow their fingers to brush together—seemingly purposeful caresses, fingers brushing against one another as tea is passed back and forth, and Sherlock constantly insisting that he’s cold and snuggling up next to John on the sofa, despite the fact that there is always a blanket draped across the back of the sofa. Apparently retrieving said blanket would require too much focus to be redirected from whatever case Sherlock happened to be in the midst of solving at the time, so John didn’t bother to make a fuss about it.
The two of them watched in silent awe as Sherlock examined the body, wordlessly gathering evidence in his mind and unraveling theories. He rose with a slight uncharacteristic grimace, stretched his back with feline grace then flitted off, presumably to piece together the last of the evidence.
Sherlock swiped at his eyes with his sleeve and looked back at John’s face. His eyes were shut, lips parted slightly in a silent gasp of pain. His chest was still bleeding profusely but more importantly, it wasn’t moving. John wasn’t
The detective was certainly not known for his impeccable sleep schedule. In fact, John wasn’t even sure Sherlock slept at all some nights. He–
“Explain. Please. I need to understand why.”
“Dada?” Rosie called again from the sitting room.
Sherlock’s head appeared at the top of his coat, like a gopher popping out of its hole. “How would you know?”
John’s grin grew wider.
Sherlock quirks a brow but thankfully says nothing further of the matter.
If someone happened to look up at the window—if anyone was still awake at this hour, that is—they would have seen the silhouette of two men, both deeply in love yet too foolish to say anything about it, swaying in time with the synchronized beating of their hearts.
“You alright, love?” John asks, holding out his arms as Sherlock finally reaches him.
“Yes?” The questioning lilt at the end of the word gave Sherlock’s falsehood away, but John purposefully chose to ignore it.
He splays his fingers out against John’s chest, taking in as much of John’s warm,
His question was answered with a deafening silence that was quite unusual to be coming from the great Sherlock Holmes.
“Moriarty’s network. Who did we miss? And don’t send John, send me back.”
“Boys,” Mrs. Hudson chastised as Sherlock bounded up the stairs.
John let out a contented sigh, allowing his own eyes to slip shut. He was mildly aware his legs had fallen asleep—Sherlock might be ridiculously skinny, but he weighed more than John had predicted.
John rolls over and snuggles deeper into the covers, pressing his face into Sherlock’s pillow and reveling in the scent of pure Sherlock that envelopes him like a blanket of warmth and comfort and
Sherlock opens his mouth. Closes it. Turns in a circle. Looks at John. Swallows.
Sherlock swallowed and nodded, leaning towards John when his phone rang, making both men jump.
So when Sherlock sinks into the water behind him, wraps his long arms around John’s waist and pulls him in against his chest, John happily obliges and sinks back into the comforting heat of his flatmate’s body.
“Could you
He sneezed three more times before they got the call from Lestrade.
“You really are a– good friend,” the detective mumbled.
******
“Sherlock,” John pinched the bridge of his nose. “My wedding is
John glanced down, his face heating to find that at some point in the night, Sherlock had curled up against him, his head pressed into the side of John’s stomach. One of Sherlock’s arms was slung across John’s lap, his fingers curled tightly around John’s hip, ensuring that he couldn’t move anywhere.
“Right then,” Lestrade said. “Want to take a look?”
“My pleasure.” John shifted the box as he climbed the stairs behind Mrs. Hudson. “This is much more affordable than my old place,” he mused.
John takes much longer than necessary examining Sherlock, even though he knew after the first glance that nothing was likely to be broken. Better safe than sorry, though, he tells himself.
“What about the river? The bath?” John asks. “Martin McDonald? Did you tell him to pull me into the Thames? Pay him to do it?”
Mycroft would be livid.
“Please.”
This Sherlock is rather different, John thinks: incongruent to the tall, confident, looming man who’d been present for the past few weeks, subtly—and also not-so-subtly—finding excuses to touch him. It had driven John completely and utterly insane. So much so that John ‘I’m definitely not gay’ Watson is currently shagging his very male flatmate, and quite exuberantly, at that. This man beneath him could barely function, struggled to form full sentences—and whole words, for that matter. In fact, from the way he kept gasping and sighing and panting, it seemed he was even struggling to do something so simple as breathe.
“No.”
“Well,” Sherlock clears his throat. “Breakfast? Coffee? Tea? Toast? Eggs?”
“Very well,” Mycroft sighed.
what he’d been doing to John for the past few weeks? He was driving John utterly insane.
Sherlock gave him the best mock-pout he could muster in his current state.
Despite the fact that John is fairly steady on his feet, Sherlock wraps one arm around John’s middle, placing the other on his waist to steady him. They start to make their way to the stairs when Sherlock pauses.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, brows pinching together for a brief moment.
But did Sherlock? Did the madman have any
“No worries, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock assured her.
“No? Than who am I, Sherlock?” Moriarty stepped closer, invading Sherlock’s space.
“Sherlock. I know he’s gone and you loved him very much. We all did. But you can’t bring him back. You should be ashamed of yourself.” She took Rosie on her hip and headed back downstairs, slamming the door behind her.
“So sorry,” John said, his voice coming out an octave higher than he’d meant. “Ahem. It– it was the only thing I could think of. They’re gone now,” he added, nodding towards the lobby.
“Right, just out of curiosity,” John said. “How did you determine all that? What did you see that told you all that?”
Searing hot pain shot through Sherlock’s back and he crumpled into a boneless heap on the ground.
Sherlock’s brow crinkled. “Was I?” He considered the thought for a moment before adding, “seems likely.”
” Sherlock murmured in his sleep.
“You ready?” he whispered.
“Never mind,” John said. “Have you solved it?”
“I just thought you boys might want a cuppa, but I’ll just come back later, how’s that? Or maybe I’ll just come by in the morning.” Mrs. Hudson, apparently forgetting altogether that John was in fact, getting married to a
Sherlock forced himself to take a deep breath and dove into his mind palace, wildly searching for an answer. Cpr. Yes. He could do that. Another deep breath. He blinked away a fresh set of tears and laced his fingers together against John’s chest and began, counting as he went, his voice echoing through the gallery.
“Not really,” Sherlock answered in a voice that seemed far too small for the great detective.
He flails his arms around until one hand lands in something plush and soft. His lungs slowly fill with air as oxygen is pushed gently into his mouth. The air is glorious and warm and like no air John has ever breathed before. It makes him feel calm. It makes him feel whole.
John rolled his eyes so hard he worried they might pop right out of his skull.
“Yes John!” Sherlock exclaimed, grabbing the doctor’s shoulders. “You’re brilliant!”
John paused his reading to glance at him—sure enough, he was talking in his sleep again. He seemed to be doing that quite a bit and John found it rather interesting to hear what he had to say. It always seemed to be something to do with the story he was reading, as though Sherlock’s mind was inserting himself into the book.

A mug falls into the sink with a
It took three weeks for John to stop picturing his best friend’s body lying on the cold pavement every time he closed his eyes.
Sherlock let out a shaky breath. “Wait for me.”
The flat had been reduced to nothing more than rubble, no thanks to his sister, and yes, they’d rebuilt it. Together. Him and John. But the colours were never quite right, the placement of things always just slightly off. Even John was different. He had more lines on his face and it looked as though he’d aged more in the past year than he had since they’d met. He was solemn and quiet and when he seemed to think Sherlock wasn’t paying attention, he looked sad. As though millions of thoughts were weighing him down, drowning him with their weight.
“Scott.” Supplied John.
Ten months of growing within the underground life of London. Getting involved in everything from prostitution to substance abuse. He grew, same as he grew within his daytime career. Took him only ten months. And for what?
“Sh…Sherlock!” John cried in urgency, his chest heaved as he roughly spoke, “I….won’t….won’t last, Christ, Sherlock.” John’s fingers dug into Sherlock’s flesh.
Navy blue clashed with a swarming galaxy.
It’s an elegant watch with an old black leather strap covered by dirt and debris, it sure had seen a lot of action.
Their minds were hazy with the aftermath of the orgasm, far better than getting high on substances if you ask Sherlock.
His heart was beating fast as he sat up from his bed, scrambling for his gown as he went downstairs in search of his flatmate.
His forehead against Sherlock’s forehead, as he slowly leaned downwards to place a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock starts walking away, already planning his next target's assassination mission before calling out one last thing.
It had been ages since John had properly drunk wine, what with tackling Rosie needing constant care, going out on cases, and the surgery. The amount of stress this past week had brought was enormous, and John got time to fully relax, he had a day off from work tomorrow too. Dinner was ready. And who knows, Lestrade might turn up with a good case for Sherlock.
The seconds morphed into minutes when finally the cake was in the oven. Both Watson’s stood before the oven’s glass door looking at the cake when Rosie spoke.
Hummed John in response, before wishing her goodnight and trotting down to return to the living room. He spotted Lestrade putting on his coat, and Molly saying her goodbyes to Mrs. Hudson.
After a few seconds, when they regained their breaths, Sherlock pulled out and slumped on top of John once again. “That…was….”
His fists then collided with the ground beneath him, his forehead pressed to it, as he let out shattered breaths and screams. The cold attacked his lungs as he sucked in a chillier breath, and then he let out a mixed noise from the back of his throat. Tears escaped him. And it was the first time he cried in ages. Everything came tumbling down on him. His world was long gone, he was only existing off of power and money, nothing else that satisfies him.
The Evening went smoothly as the lot ate dinner consisting of Turkey, made by a hundred-year-old recipe as Mrs. Hudson has informed them, Gravy, Roasted Potatoes and Parsnips, Roasted Beef and Mashed Potatoes, Herb stuffing, wine for the adults, and juice for Rosie.
returned to him.
“John Hamish Watson, combine this and the fall, and you shall see the depth of my loyalty. I am devoted to you.” Sherlock’s baritone spoke clearly. “Goodbye, John.”
He was blinded by fury at himself as memories of his so-called
“He is smart John, he must have realized he was bleeding when he injured himself.” Sherlock took a step closer to John, making him incredibly close as he whispered. “Behind me.”
Desire burning in the atmosphere.
John set down his glass, trying to hide his smug, as he maneuvered around the flat in search of pen and paper, his mind racing. He remembered the last time they had played it. How John had to stick the paper to Sherlock’s forehead. How he had to touch Sherlock’s curls, making way for the paper. And John lounged for another touch. This was what he's after.
The fireplace was alive. Casting orange shadows across the room, its crackling sounds breaking the silence. The wind howled outside, snow was falling. And there was Sherlock, sat on his armchair, looking elegant with his long limbs, drinking away his wine.
A few minutes pass by, and Irene doesn't expect an answer, Sherlock is quite reserved in the matters of the heart, Which is why it took her by surprised when he spoke.
But alas, I am quite pleased with how things turned out at the end. When Sherlock’s out at town, there are the bee's, that he keeps buzzing to keep me company.
“Come for me, my Darling.” And that was the undoing of John Watson.
I didn’t only hurt Sherlock, I had hurt myself hurting Sherlock. I had hit him hard. I remember the day the same way I remember killing my first enemy at war. My knuckles were red with blood, skin tearing and a slightly bluish bruise formed. That was nothing compared to what I did to his face. Bruises and blood splashed his face the same way they splashed my enemies, and I had hated myself. Hated myself for doing him the same as I did to my enemies for Sherlock, my partner is life, is not my enemy, but quite the opposite, and so much more.
He stubbed the cigarette on the ground, stood up swiftly and dusted off dust and lingering debris before taking back the coat from Irene’s outstretched hand and handing it to the MI6 agent.
And then the night came. Mrs. Hudson greeted Lestrade and Molly at the door, urging them to come in. Rosie had shown delight when both Uncle Greg and Molly came in, wrapping attacking them with hugs.
No rustlings of a mad genius conducting an experiment, the harsh grinding tunes of the violin or exclamations such as: “Tea John!” or “Oh John you’re an idiot, dating a psychopath!”
John’s eyes were glue forwards, the corridor was unnaturally clean and white, yet he felt a strange feeling. Of course, he felt eerie and all that, but something new he wicked up. Like when he was in Afghanistan. And it clicked. Sherlock. Of course, Sherlock would feel useless and even guilty, as much as he never shows, John knows it. He had put them both in danger. And he came with a pocketknife.
Like a black hole inside of him. Swallowing everything he had. Every last bit. Leaving him drained. Unstable.
“And the first?” Lestrade inquired once again.
“I’m the brawn, you’re the brains.” John voiced the truth. A fact. An obvious fact. And Sherlock hates that, but sometimes he doesn’t see it, and so here is where John steps in. He took a glance behind him and saw Sherlock nodding, with a neutral expression.
Yes, I had suffered under your sayings. It is rare that people’s sayings get to me, but hearing you calling me a machine, hearing you accuse me of things, hearing you say the words, they had cut deep John. As if I gave you a road map straight to my heart. But I do forgive you, as you forgave me for all the hurt that I have caused you.
The flame awakens.
Eating him.
“Sherlock.” Sherlock said sternly.
“And is it
Slowly he ascends the steps, thinking what his mad flatmate was up to.
And with that, John vanished to get to work.
John was lavished with huffs and groans from his lover as he continued to rock and grind himself against Sherlock.
It’s not surprising, not at all. That miserable childhood of neglect and abuse battling to see which could do the most damage followed by a decade of high-pressure school life and even more soul-crushing ladder-climbing broken up only by a short stint in the military where the last lingering bits of his idealism had been obliterated.
He is the man who has everything and nothing, and he’d had nothing to live for.
John felt it, the heartbeat of the world’s only consulting detective.
I remember going back to 221B. Seeing Mrs. Hudson again after so long…
“Mr. Holmes,” began Rosie with her sweet angelic voice, her hands clasped in front of her, “I, Rosie Watson, request you to help in decorating our Christmas tree.”
John wasn’t sure how he had happened to visit her. His colleague and friend, Michael Stamford, had stopped by his mansion once with a card to Ella’s address. After a small heated argument John had initiated, he tossed the damned card into his drawer, for it to not be seen until ten months later. That’s how long it took for John’s state to deteriorate.
Something about the wrist watch strikes Irene odd as her gaze locked on it.
with a very familiar handwriting.
Rosie nodded as she ran off, leaving John alone.
Sherlock though, his theory confirmed,
John dismissed this as just his drinking, as he stood up and announced that Rosie ought to go to bed since it’s nearing 1 am. John accompanied Rosie upstairs to their shared room, putting her to bed.
But some temptations can’t be resisted when you’re drunk. He doesn’t want to be obvious, though. And then it hit him, the stag night.
As if sensing Sherlock’s inner dialogue, John growled out, “yes…yours…”
He looked peacefully asleep, he looked younger than John ever saw.
“Random stranger. Literally bumped into him at the gallery,” John started. The gallery was another thing to get his mind off of things instead of indulging in other activities. And there he was, walking down the aisle when he bumped into this strikingly looking man, who gazed back at him in a menacing way. “He looked at me like he was looking at the art, and it wasn’t appreciative. Then he called me – what was it – a touch-starved, love-famished skeleton of a child behind money, playing with lives because no one ever taught me to play with blocks.”
Wool comes into contact with her bare arms sending little electric shocks throughout her body.
He had been in denial all this time. Nothing will ever change, if not for worse. He is broken beyond repair.
Sherlock pulled off of John, instantly feeling the loss of contact. He looked down upon John, “You’re so handsome, my darling,” he rasped out as he reclaimed John’s mouth, running his hands along his body, muscled and toned and strong and
Soon, the lot gathered around the living room. Wine, Mince Pie, and the British Christmas cake were served on plates. The Christmas tree shined as Lestrade spoke.
John’s eyes were glassy as he dove into action, turning Sherlock over, running his hands through him in a thorough examination, not liking one bit what he was seeing and feeling.
By the time John found pen and paper, Sherlock had moved the armchairs closer to each other, just like before. And then he collapsed on his armchair. So impossibly beautiful.
The next day, the socks attempted to save him.
“The surgery called, I need to fill in for someone, I owe him a favor,” John informed Sherlock who lowered Rosie back to the ground from attaching a star to the top of the tree.
Sherlock practically fell on top of John as he came, he called out John’s name as he emptied himself inside him.
Some creatures feed on the dead. It's part of life.
He thought of everything Sherlock had done to him. And he truly marveled at how he ended up with a man like Sherlock in his life. The detective was like a planet, pulling John into his orbit.
“Yes...yes…Sherlock,” Panted John.
He opens the door slowly and was greeted with the redecorated not burning Christmas tree, and John must admit, it looked much better than before.
Sherlock’s lithe body like a sculpted work of art was pressed against John.
It was eating him. Inside out viscously, tearing his flesh wide open as he struggled for breath. He was rotting at self-disgust to the far measures he had had to take entertain himself. To keep himself living. To keep himself from falling apart.
Sherlock has looked at it quite fondly, a few minutes of staring, as if he is remembering something he...
“I love her.”
Sherlock lifted both hands, previously lying on the armchair’s armset. One hand raised to John’s hair, which was glowing golden as the fire threw its light onto them. The other hand ever so gently stuck the paper to John’s forehead, with the same care he handles his violin. And John found himself wondering what else are those elegant fingers could potentially do.
Irene then asked, “He’s what keeps you going, isn’t he?”
As he turned into a corner, the air turned chillier and a shorter man jogged beside him. Drug dealer. Apparent from clothes. And John didn’t think twice before his fists landed in the bloke’s face.
The words had fled the stranger’s mouth at lightning speed. Picking at John’s flesh, taking him apart and staring at his inside’s working. He rattled off telling everything about John’s life. And John had sat there, dumbstruck at
Scent of burning tobacco.
“Martha is your first name, Mrs. Hudson?” began Lestrade, “Blimey, I never knew. What about you Sherlock? Sherlock isn’t your first name, is it?” he asked, raising an eyebrow as he munched down on another mince pie.
The wooden door supported John’s weight as he leaned with his back on it, the weather was bloody cold, and his fingers were numb. He had brought a few bags of groceries Mrs. Hudson had ordered him to bring, as she had happily sake she would cook the turkey for tomorrow. He had been gone for shorter than he thought.
At that Sherlock shoved his hand between them to stroke John’s cock in rhyme to his thrusting, John’s fingernails dug at Sherlock’s back, his head burrowed into Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock’s head was mare centimeters from john’s head, every moan rumbled through John’s chest. Sherlock’s whole body covered john’s, his head near John’s, breathing into his ear, whispering words only he would hear. Their labored breathing a melody in Sherlock’s ear, John’s hand found Sherlock’s curls, he grasped tightly eliciting a moan from his beautiful man.
Electricity bolted through John’s body, sending him into another world, as he let Sherlock in.
John said with a smile at the close-eyed detective. The ambulance was outside, and the wound wasn’t dangerous at all. “You’re a drama queen.” My drama queen.
John’s body jolted with electricity, his hips moving and frotting, his breathing irregular, and his moans filled the room.
Rage shot through his body as a shiver gave away. His breath fast. Brows furrowed. Head bowed in shame at his own self.
Sherlock stood with the barrel against his chest, both his hands on the killer’s face, his thumbs pressing into his eyes resulting in a screech.
” John’s disbelieving voice carried out.
And John got lost in the music. Drowning him in it. It was beautiful and cheery and warm. Just what John needed.
Rosie’s face had lit up with excitement as she ran to search the gifts under the tree. She radiated joy as her tiny hands grasped around a soft squishy gift with her name labeled on it. The brown card also read
And so he took on the challenge of owning a multi-million dollar company.
“Don’t be gone for too long, daddy. We still need to bake a cake!” Said Rosie as she hugged her father, and then she whispered to his ear, “there is a mistletoe above where you and papa stood.”
John set down his glass, taking in the other empty one. It was cold against his palm. Red liquid was poured into the glass, bloodlike; he gave it to Sherlock as the detective took a turn to his seat.
But it didn’t last long. They never last. At some point, one is bound to realize what is happening.
But how can he? How can he when everything he……no, this is wrong.
“But it’s Christmas!” Exclaimed John, frustrated at Sherlock’s refusal to cooperate.
“There wasn’t any way to save her, she was in far too deep.” He offers.
The monster had a rather liking to beating. On the drunken nights he would return home he would use John as his personal punching bag. Sometimes using any object at his disposal to use against John’s youthful body. The memories attacked John viciously, and John did not want to be or resemble that monster.
Irene thought.
John’s eyes fluttered open as he took in the curls that were tickling his face. His nose was nuzzled against Sherlock’s nape, breathing him in. His scent was fragrant and soft. John’s arm lay possessively around Sherlock’s torso, their sheets tousled from a night’s sleep.
Sherlock’s head stirred, John was caught in alarm. “I know.”
-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-
As John slightly moved to shift himself, Sherlock gasped as he saw stars bloom before him, “John, move,” he demanded as his hips started to rock, seeking friction.
I was nothing but lost and in a dark pit.
“Yeah, not good, I know. I don’t give a shit and neither did he. He’s….” the man had seemed nothing like John ever saw. Everything from the way the man talked to how he held himself or his dramatic coat with his attitude and his voice, it was all…”…interesting, and what absolutely drove me ‘round the twist was that he acted like he had the same sort of ‘oh what an interesting little bug’ thought about
“Can I ask you something?” John asked before he lost his nerve.
They lay like that for a while, tired and spent and sated until Sherlock finally murmurs, “John, you are absolutely–” He pauses to take a breath. “Brilliant. Marvelous. Amazing. Incredible. Fantastic.”
They found a small hallway to hide in where they were able to see the painting the thieves were most likely to target without being seen themselves. They pressed close to one another and waited and waited and waited.
“You know, when you drooled all over my shoulder,” John says.
Sherlock remained silent, gaze focused intently on a spot to the right of John’s head.
John continued working his hands through Sherlock’s hair until the detective was making noises oddly similar to that of a purring cat. John smiled softly to himself. It was rather endearing to see this side of Sherlock—one of England’s greatest minds unraveled by something so simple as John’s touch.
When John wakes to the bright beams of sunlight filtering in through his window, he thankfully smells no trace of the smoke from the night before, as though it had never happened. But it had. The armful of consulting detective that is currently pressed along the entire length of his body is evidence enough of that fact. At some point in the night, the gap that had been between them had closed and apparently disappeared altogether. One of Sherlock’s legs is slung over John’s hips and John is surprised to find that it appears it was in fact
“Right,” Lestrade repeated—it certainly didn’t take a genius to deduce the gist of what had happened.
“Yeah, I did.”
“Yes?”
Mrs. Hudson waggled her eyebrows at John.
But this time was different.
Sherlock lets out a low moan and slumps further into his chair as John sucks and kisses down his neck, leaving large red marks in his wake. John moves back to Sherlock’s mouth and they kiss until their lips are bright and swollen, their breathing coming out in sporadic huffs of desperate breath and then suddenly it’s not enough and John wants
John curled into his own chair, sipping his tea in long, burning gulps. The flat was unbearably cold. It had always been slightly drafty with poor insulation, but it seemed far worse now. John shivered despite the warmth from the tea.
“Closest bathroom is down the hall on the right. I’ll come get you at once if we hear anything.”
“Yes, of course it did,” John exclaimed.
“Hired? By who?” John asked, intrigued.
“Yes! Get angry!” Moriarty encouraged, giving Sherlock a rough shove.
John pulled his coat tighter around his body, willing the warmth to stay shut away. Sherlock flipped up his coat collar, the tip of his nose already turning an alarming shade of pink.
“Of course,” John sighed, jogging after Sherlock.
“Sherlock, are you sure you didn’t hit your head when you fell?”
“Besides,” Sherlock continued. “If I don’t, they’ll all be in danger.”
“No, I’m not gay,” he explained.
“Alright?” Sherlock asks, a hint of concern present in the deep timbre of his voice.
John glanced at Sherlock, a silent question written across the slight furrow of his brow. Sherlock stared back, unblinking, his piercing silver-blue gaze locked firmly onto John’s, silently willing him to make the correct deduction.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to wake you.”
John’s heart was nearly pounding right through his ribcage, his chest heaving with each breath sucked into his burning lungs. Sherlock’s coat billowed out behind him as John tried to keep up, the detective’s longer legs giving him the advantage of speed as they ran, weaving through the machinery.
“So you’re studying cuddling?”
It wasn’t until John paid close attention to Sherlock’s slow, even breaths against his neck, and the steady rise and fall of his chest pressed against John’s side that he realized Sherlock had fallen asleep in his arms. John suppressed a soft chuckle, suddenly determined not to wake him from his sleep that was decidedly more peaceful than it had been before.
“Tea sounds lovely,” Sherlock said, though it came out in a garbled mumble through the thick wool of his coat.
“I promise,” Sherlock let out a breath. “I’ve been here too long. I can’t be seen.”
Sherlock hates the quiet nights. Not because there are no cases to solve. Not because it’s one of the rare times Mrs. Hudson doesn’t bring them dinner. Not even because John does the cooking. It is because of what happens after they eat dinner.
“Oh, of course. I can get them for you,” John said, holding the door open for her as they made their way back into the morgue. “So sorry for your loss.”
of all people would be scared of a simple storm.”
Needless to say, from then on, there was no need for two bedrooms in two twenty-one b.
“I beg your pardon?” Sherlock asked indignantly. “I appear to be very much alive, thank you.”
“Not your... fault,” John croaked. He gave Sherlock a small smile. His fingers loosened around Sherlock’s hand. “No regrets,” he rasped. Sherlock let out a small huff and buried his face in John’s neck, being careful not to jostle him too much.
As if on cue, the wind whistled eerily as it blew past the windows of the flat, making both men jump in their seats.
“For you,” Sherlock said softly, offering no further explanation.
John falls asleep almost instantly.
him to say yes.
Now that Sherlock’s legs were unrestrained, Lestrade pulled the down comforter up from the foot of the bed to cover Sherlock’s body, then peered down at him. “Sherlock, will you let me look at your injuries since John can’t see them?
“LIAR!” came a shout, followed by the sound of ripping and tearing. “I’ll show you!”
The figure moved forward until he was touching the smaller man. A chin came to rest on John’s shoulder as Sherlock said quietly, directly into John’s ear, “Can we do it again?”
my Papa!”
I sat with him, watching him age with loving eyes. It was easy to be patient when time is of no matter. I found that I could travel around London without effort and could even, upon occasion, enter the glowing white door that constantly beckoned to me from the corner. I would talk with Uncle Rudy, my parents, and even Mycroft, once he had passed. All resentments and anger were put in the past. I finally understood why things had happened the way that they did between us, and we forgave each other for being less-than-perfect human beings. Mrs. Hudson was so pleased to see me again that she gave me a big hug, and Lestrade joined the party some time later. There was only one person missing...

“Not him, John, I mean, a professional...” Lestrade corrected himself, hastily

“My God, I love you, you incredible berk,” John laughed, kissing his lover again and again. “You are always so full of surprise! Now, drink your tea and get ready. We have a lot to do today.” He winked. “And maybe, later on, we’ll do some shopping…”

Minutes later, Security showed up and the server directed them into the service area. A few minutes after that, Agent Doyle calmly walked up to their table, spun a chair around backwards, and sat down, resting his arms on the back of the chair.
