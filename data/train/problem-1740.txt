Those hands, that prick, those lips, that tongue.
“Seb, rule one, never, ever, sample the merchandise, I don’t care what they’re calling it.”
Sherlock abandoned John’s cock and carefully crawled up his body.
With her weight on her knees, Sally straddled Janine, slowly inching her way up her body.
“There was a burglary at a bungalow owned by a wealthy man for the purposes of entertaining a certain lady. When a suspect was arrested, he offered the story that he was invited to the bungalow by Miss Helier to discuss a play he’d written. At the time of the alleged meeting, Miss Helier was rehearsing lines with her understudy, but the young man claims he was received at the bungalow by a parlourmaid and met someone calling herself Miss Helier. The young man had a drink, and the next thing he remembers he was stumbling out in the road, where the police caught up with him after a tip about the burglary. When confronted with the real Miss Helier, he denies it was her. The police found the bungalow had, indeed, been ransacked and jewelry taken. The wealthy man was not in residence, and the other occupant, the lady in question, who is in fact someone else’s wife, was called to London by a bogus telegram.”
“Sounds wonderful.”
“Thanks for the ride, Mister Holmes. Would you like to come up for a cuppa?”
They giggled. Their foreheads touched.
While Mycroft obliged, his lips driving her damn near insane, Molly reached back, curling one hand around his neck. The fingers of her other hand were laced in Greg’s. She squeezed them, then pulled back slightly, just enough to put a sliver of space between her face and Mycroft’s, and panted,
…oh, my mouth might be sweet, wet, too. He and I could sweeten, dampen each other in so many ways…
“Well…”
“My, there’s nothing defective about this cock.”
Mycroft groaned.
Sometimes you can’t answer. Sometimes I have to prompt you, prod you.
The hurt part of this hurt/comfort is the brutal whumping our poor British Gov't gets in TFP.
And, thus, the kneeling.
“Oh, Doctor!”
Holmes silenced Watson with a kiss. Then he pulled away and laced his fingers in Watson’s. “Why don’t we return to the cottage and I’ll allow you give me a demonstration of just how steady your hands can be?”
“Tell her you’re heat suppressants have failed and you’ve gone into oestrus.”
Sherlock was still dressed and tied, arms wide, to the headboard.
Then I raised an eyebrow.
And then a smile.
. Omegaverse. Alpha/Alpha. Car sex.
When the oven was closed, he took a sip of lukewarm tea. “Thank you.”
He freed his erection and slicked it with some oil he’d found.
“Take, for instance,” continued Holmes, ignoring the quip, “that dreadful business of the Abernetty family. You chose to use it as an example of how something apparently trifling could be significant and of how a classic case might have a least promising commencement. Which is true and all very good. To be certain, “The Six Napoleons” was a great case, but the Abernetty case was also a great case and, yet, in the whole of your public chronicles it is never mentioned except that once.”
It's a gift
“I know that river,” I said. “I remember it from when I was a child, staying with my aunt.”
“I do. I love you, love you, love you. Those beautiful black wings. Like a raven, no? Of course, you’re clever. Ravens are clever, aren’t they? Glossy black raven wings. And eyes, so soft and grey, but sad. Why are you sad, Sherlock? Don’t be sad. I love you. I’ll always love you. What can I do to make you smile? May I touch your wings?”
Nothing is so ferocious as a sailor’s appetite when he’s finally home. After I’d washed the remnants of Captain Basil from my form, I was seated across from Watson, tucking into the most toothsome steak and oyster pie I’d ever tasted without so much as a pause for speech. He was eating, too, but more slowly and with undisguised regard for me.
‘Price above rubies?’ Ha! As if gems were not worthless pebbles next to the scarlet beads on your skin drawn by my blade.
Reclining on a wooden bench like a piece of ceramic in a kiln, I found my sorrows had almost vapourised.
“A gentleman Alpha? How old-fashioned. By the way, I looked you up on the internet last night. Lots of porn and testimonials about ‘The Machine’ but about Sherlock Holmes, only your website.”
“Oh God,” he groaned.
Molly's Milk is Irish whiskey, Irish mist liquor, and cream.
His gaze turned to John. He blushed. “For, uh, someone.”
Watson flew to his feet and rescued the cigar, which made an evil hiss when tossed into the fire.
“Too late now. You’ve ruined the surprise.”
“It is quite the retreat when one is feeling the strain of things.”

Sherlock uncoiled. John gasped.
WHACK!
And roasted chestnuts, I confess,
“Indeed. May I?”
“…you could tell me what’s bothering you. It’s the friends part of the friends with benefits, the buddy part of the fuck buddy or, you know, just being a decent human being.”
Yes, he’d got his man, and a rather nasty piece of work, at that.
Too big. Too roomy.
Oh, lads, were they?
“Come now,” chided Sherlock. “Among my brother’s preferred hosiery, the newly-released Zaidee stocking is the only one that features heart-shaped gold glitter.”
Not at first, of course. Routine case. Routine chase. Then Sherlock got lost.
“Blindfold?” he asked.
“You said six months, Jim.”
“Hold that lift! Thanks. Oh, Mister Holmes.”
The back of John’s head was hitting the cupboard door, his teeth were in danger of being shattered by the rim of the heavy bottle, and he was folded in two like a paper doll, but he didn’t care.
“So?”
“Oh, God. I’m going to come!”

Holmes is still asleep. He’s had a good night, and I left the bed with the prayer of anyone who’s cared for an ill loved one: that his body allow nature’s great restorer to have her way with him for as long as she pleased.
“Yes, Brother Mine, and I come bearing lubricant. Masters, spread yourselves.”
A Blarney stone is Jameson, ginger beer, and lime. And Jim is, of course, quoting Yeats.
“Stella!”
He stirred and turned his head. “Doctor.”
“Holmes!”
I shook my head slowly.
It was a ridiculous tableau: Seb, naked and still dripping from the shower, his lover-employer-tormentor bent over the arm of the sofa, with bespoke trousers ‘round his ankles and a Quasimodo hump of coat, jacket, shirt on his back.
“Not yet,” said Sally, tapping a button.
“Boss, have you ever tried candy corn?”
An uneasy silence settled between them.
“To review one’s career

It was a change, I’ll admit, to witness the great detective Sherlock Holmes doing something as prosaic as tromping through a pumpkin patch in search of the perfect specimen.
“If?”
“I’m okay, but Edgewater’s not so good.”
Mycroft looked away abruptly and, thus,  did not see the corner of Lestrade’s mouth twitch in satisfaction.
She chuckled. “Sure.”
“Of course. It is yours.”
Kate bent until her head was between Molly’s legs. She put her hands under Molly’s thighs, coaxing her to bend her knees. Then she nuzzled at Molly through the fabric of the gown.
A swipe of a mouth on a sleeve and Mycroft was being yanked from the chair. He had sense to pluck the small bottle of lubricant from his dressing gown pocket, but dropped it when he was shoved onto the bed, face first.
He was holding her hair up and kissing the nape of her neck. “Six months, six days. I’m so changeable. But to be fair, I’ve only two. Weaknesses, that is.” He licked, then worried a tender spot with his teeth. “I tried to stay away, but I found I quite simply could not live without you, Molly.”
But John always thinks what a wonderful way to greet the day.
“Yes, that’s exactly how he’d look at me if he knew.” He sighed. “I knew he’d be out tonight. John doesn’t realise it, but his libido is like clockwork. Full moon, he always goes in search of somewhere to rest his head.” Sherlock shrugged. “We’re all creatures of habit, I suppose.”
Lestrade pulled off Mycroft’s cock, wiped his face on the back of his hand, and grinned. “Perfect threesome, isn’t it?”
Mycroft finally gets Lestrade's attention. Mystrade. Flirting only.
She heard the ‘click’ of the chair’s lock.
“Getting old.”

This was the moment he had to seize!
He stood and stripped down to his drawers, folding and hanging his clothes neatly on the wooden chair as he went. Then he slipped between the sheets.
“I must go to the Continent, Watson.”
“Don’t expect it to be an annual treat! As much as I love you, I don’t fancy getting myself tied to the railroad tracks just so you and your massive intellect can arrive in the nick of time to save me!”
“How was your day at the circus, Holmes?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened. His nostrils flared. Then he licked his lips.
Whack! Whack!
Mycroft didn’t make a sound or any voluntary movement. He was sorely tempted, however, to make a great many sounds and quite a few movements as the round towel-covered shape at his lap rose and fell.

“No directly but it’s a necessary by-product.”
“She shredded his dick off with her—!” shrieked the client. He wrenched out of the guard’s grasp and fled down the stairs and out the door.
“That, too.”
“You know this is what Marx said would happen.”
John blushed.
“Thirteen. Over. And over.”
“I’m not the one tied up.”
But the fifth October found me under the weather and news of my illness reached my brother’s ears. We corresponded quite cordially, and he vowed there would be no mischief that year to aggravate my weakened state.
Jim released her feet, reached for his glass, and sipped.
“Understandable. I have a PA of similar temperament. Perhaps, Colonel, you’d prefer to take the role of voyeur and join in if the mood strikes.”
They laughed, then Molly’s expression fell serious. She whispered, “If you needed it for some reason…”
“Like that, love?”
“Watson?”

“Sixteen,” said John. He took a deep, noisy breath. “You have been naughty, Sherlock Holmes, and for that, you’re being punished.”
I recognised him at once.
“Oh, God, John,” groaned Sherlock when John’s slicked fist was ‘round Sherlock’s prick and his slicked two fingers were sunk deep in Sherlock’s hole.

Apropos of nothing, they were in Singapore. But, no, not apropos of nothing, as Jim was about to find out.
“Thinking about this?” asked Seb, sucking on Jim’s half-hard prick.
“In these shoes.”
Lestrade produced a set of keys and unlocked a warehouse door, then a gate, then he switched on a set of lights.
Sherlock toyed with tassels which hung from gold stars which covered his nipples. He looked away. “In the loo, one fingered me while another sucked me off.”
How coffee dragged you by the nostrils from far away! Nothing else like it except, perhaps, bacon.
She laughed as he nuzzled her neck and shoulders, then her cleavage and her stomach; everywhere he went, he left dark red smears on her skin in his wake.
Sherlock chuckled. “More, John,” she urged before she bit the ridge of John’s shoulder. Four fingers curled inside Sherlock’s cunt. John’s rutting sped up.
Dark eyes glinted. “Even better.”
“Oh, I think it was popular when I was young. My aunt used to sing it. I forget how it starts but ‘…a lilac for the kiss of first blush true, a dittany for the one who made you blue, a daisy for the innocent untouched, a bouquet made of blooms you love so much.’”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck.”
Stella raised an eyebrow.
“And just where are we going?”
We got to our feet and made our way carefully down the shingled path.

Finally, Molly shooed the faun away.
“Not at all. Care to roleplay?”
“Really? I’m looking for new digs.”
“It’s pink princess day, Gregory.”
“I am happy, too.” He pressed his lips together, then spoke with a tremour of anxiety. “There are moments, however, my dear Watson, when I think myself unworthy of such happiness.”

A friend.
As Sherlock stepped into the music shop, the bell on the door jangled.
Should we turn left or right?
“Perfectly foolish: fat cigar, wire spectacles, bushy eyebrows, even bushier moustache.”
Holmes had said he wanted to leave for the island at first light, and first light was approaching swiftly, much more swiftly than I desired. This was not a romantic holiday despite our prolonged and ardent dalliance some hours earlier. It was a case, and a paying, anxious client was expecting our arrival by midday.
“You’ll have to wait for that,” I said.
“I’m betting your hung like Captain Kirk.”
“Perhaps you’d like to go through your routine again. It would be motivating, bordering on inspirational.”
“I don’t know. It just is.”
And when John was finally fully sheathed inside Sherlock, he twisted his head and nipped gently at Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock centric. Masturbation. Dub-con for John.
A giggling trio smashed into John.
“Oh, yeah?”
Mycroft pet his head and said softly, “You seem to be displaying signs of triviality.”
“And why are you here, Donovan?”

A/N. For the Holmes Minor October prompt: mischief.
Sherlock nodded, and John threw the bottle of lube onto the bunk.
Molly lowered the partition. “Barts, Henri?”
“Parts of me were.”
It humbles me that I, who relied so heavily on my powers of observation, did not notice the line from Dryden’s Virgil spanning my belly until I set about dressing myself for the day. Beekeepers’ work is as arduous and never-ending as that of their charges. I fell instantly asleep last night, too spent to spare a single thought for the man who must have dressed me in night-clothes and tucked me into bed like a child and left behind these beautiful words to inspire me, like a gift under a pillow.
Molly looked in the bag. “Nothing for you. Or are we sharing? Or do you have to go?” Molly tried not to pout, really, she did.
“Isn’t absinthe illegal?”
Breath by breath, they snuggled closer. Then Lestrade ran a hand down the front of Mycroft’s pyjama trousers. “I’m spent for anything but doing my best impression of a corpse, but if you wanted…”
Lestrade slid the covering open and took a sip.
“Not entirely. But I think it highly probable.”

Sherlock whined, and John jerked the lace down and spread his cheeks.
Lestrade stopped. “By the way, Sherlock, what are you, Tinkerbell?”

“I could drive you home, too.”
“Don’t.”
John smiled. “Fancy a walk home?”
A few minutes later, Jim was much more relaxed. “We need call pest control, Sebbie.”
Mycroft shot him a look. “It’s a question of units, of measurement.”
“Number two was also an odd, lingering case. You were having a tray in bed, something occurred—“
Lestrade turned his head and caught sight of Mycroft sitting at a table.
He liked the way it filled his mouth, tickled the back of his throat, brushed the top of his palate. He liked the way it spread his lips. He liked swirling his tongue ‘round it, mapping the veins and ridges and changes of texture. He liked the taste of it.
Cake waited.
“Oh, God!”
Sherlock pressed her lips to John’s damp collar. “She was right. People do get sentimental about their pets. If the bomb, or the snipers, had killed you …”
“You found Evans?”
“You don’t have to. No pressure at all.”
Mycroft checked his watch. “There is going to be a raid.”
Was it a 6 or an 8?
“No, but you must make absolutely no mention of this to anyone.”
“No!”
“Smee?”

“Have you been working out?” Moriarty asked with a chuckle. “For me? You shouldn’t have.”

“Marion Crane went missing in 1960. She was 33 years old. Unmarried. Lived with her only sister, Lila, Liv’s mum. Both parents dead. It was a Friday. Marion’d taken a long lunch hour to meet her boyfriend at a hotel room and was late getting back to work. Her boss was an estate agent. That afternoon an American client gave the agent $40,000 in cash for a property which was to be gifted to his daughter upon her upcoming wedding. Marion was a good employee, secretary, typist, clerk, etcetera, one of two in the office. She had worked there for ten years without incident. She was entrusted with taking the cash to the bank. She pleaded a headache and asked to go home after the delivery. The money never made it to the bank, and Marion didn’t show up for work on Monday—or any other day. Lila was in Cornwall that weekend with friends.”

“Who?”
Holmes & Watson reflect on a bizarre murder in the country.
John was an Omega-for-hire. He’d had an appointment with a new client, and he’d got the bloody address wrong. He knocked on the door, the wrong door. The well-spoken, well-dressed toff had set him straight, the place John wanted was three doors down, but, suddenly, there’d been a small explosion, and John, once a doctor-soldier, always a doctor-soldier, had followed the well-dressed toff inside to see if he could help.
I turned my head sharply and forced myself to look it full in the face.
“Mrs. Hudson!”
“Appearances can be deceiving. If you showed me yours, I’d show you mine.”
He yanked Sherlock’s pants down and swallowed his cock.
Sherlock leaned back against his armchair and curled his arms behind his head. A theatrical gesture, but the right one, because John’s pupils blew completely black, having already darkened some when Sherlock had first removed his shirt.
SMACK!
I am a kraken. Rising from the depths. Breaking ships like nursery toys.
“New stockings?”
“Ma’am, you can take your gas mask off. Funny you even have one of those.”
“So you see, John, glitter is almost invisible. You had no idea when you kissed me that night that there was anything on my skin.”
Lestrade gave a tiny gasp.
He looked down and frowned at the empty tin of tomatoes. It had splashed red drops on his trousers; the red was a contrast to the rest of the stains on his trousers, which were shades of Sussex brown and green.
“Uh-huh. Careful,” said Seb. The blade was flat against Jim’s body, lying almost parallel to his erect cock, as if the two were first-time lovers gazing into each other’s eyes in the afterglow.

He leaned forward and watched her hands playing with her clit and toying with her nipples as she bounced, fucking herself on his cock.
“That I’m yours?”
Whittled luminaries!
“It can be a refuge.”
“I doubt anyone will remember a few discordant notes given what happened afterwards.”
“We traded some bake goods for it,” explained John truthfully. Sherlock added a plausible story for Stella to tell her supervisors.
“I’m in town for a christening, Janie’s youngest, and I got lost, of course, and I saw you and thought, well, whatever I thought, I decided to follow you, like a common criminal.”
My trembling became full-bodied shudders as I wept.
I didn’t look at him until he said,
“Looks like the Landladies Society’s Midsummer Night’s Ball was a success after all,” said John.
John mimicked her, defiant, but only for a moment. “Oh, fuck.”

My eyes were closed, but I felt a sudden doubling of cool air. I pried one eye open and saw Sherlock’s fan alongside mine.
Holmes huffed with mock indignation. “The bees!”
He unbuttoned his shirt and stepped closer to the bed. When he was within arm’s length, Sherlock grabbed for his waist, pushed up his vest and began kissing his torso.
“In my bed?”
“Wow. They’re sharp.”
Lestrade collapsed onto the bus seat and peered in his bag.
“Boss.”

John obliged, bucking his hips hard, then he whispered,
Dark eyes fixed him. A head shook. “No, Mister Holmes.”
And then, of its own accord, rising from the desiccated foliage, is a skeleton!
It was a puzzle.
Holmes’s words were the first he’d spoken that day. After perfunctory nods, we’d drunk our morning tea, smoked our morning pipes, and perused our morning newspapers in silence. Then he’d set about an experiment and I’d feigned interest in a novel, expecting to doze. In those days, I was extremely lazy and slept fitfully most nights.
Sherlock buttoned his coat.
“She was your friend, wasn’t she?” said Holmes gently.
“Cartwright’s a clever chap. Here you go.”
“Sorry. Won’t happen again. But that’s another thing that John doesn’t know about me! That I’d rescue a storm-drenched calico, dry it, feed it.” He reached into the cupboard. “Look, sardines!”
Holmes understood intellectually that his was only an indirect role, an accidental one borne of ignorance or arrogance or simple lack of precognition.
Bottom!lock,  neat, no chaser. Sherlock/John. John with tentacle cock.

“You’re on break,” he cooed as he kissed her neck.
“There is still a bit of brown left, and I’m told a lot can been accomplished with properly positioned cushions.”
Sherlock, still nude from his spanking, got up and found the nearest dressing gown and slipped it on.
“It is now!"

John was purposefully effusive with his language and purposefully deep and abiding with his massage, not just because he wanted Sherlock to know how loved and cherished he was, but also for a more practical reason: he wanted Sherlock wrapped in a blissful cocoon while he went to make tea.
Mycroft smiled at the ground and rocked back on his heels. “Indeed.”

John licked at skin which was now damp with sweat.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. This can’t be very comfortable.”
“But, Watson, before you do, read the letter again.”
“Oh, well, that’s very thoughtful of you.”
Seb and Jim applied themselves to the task while Molly moaned.
“Well, let’s not disappoint them, especially today,” said John as he leaned closer, kissed Sherlock, and gave their cocks a lustful squeeze.
“But wouldn’t that strengthen, not weaken the case for his death being accident? I had a look at the little book myself and saw, quite plainly, that the drawing of the Sussex Brown Cap reveals it to be almost identical to that of the Brown Toad’s Death, the ones Hawkriver had with his supper. The mistake could be easily made, even by an experience forager like Hawkriver. On a side not, it is precisely why I always make certain you finish at least a third of your omelette before me.”

“He’s taken his postcard collection, except one,” observed Holmes as he removed the postcard with a gloved hand.
Holmes raised the topmost garment.
“When I say ‘presume,’ I mean ‘hope.’”
John approaches the coat and the scarf.
And nuzzles a hardening bulge.
I cried out and waved the note-book, which sent a pair of embers flying: one lit upon my dressing down, setting me a-smolder, and the other landed in the witch’s brew, which turned out to have a remarkable flammability.
He closed the distance between us as if by magic.
John raced after him. “About?”
“No, Spanish.”
“My dear man, I know it’s difficult, but pull yourself together.”
I went to my club after breakfast and did most of my initial business by messenger from there. The following day I took advantage of Holmes’s absence from Baker Street to discuss with Mrs. Hudson the second part of my plan. She acquiesced, albeit not without reservations.
“What about the crime of pretending to be dead? Or pretending to be dying? You’ve done both, the latter when, according to he who may or may not swing for the crime of pencil-sketching, you were wearing pajamas.”
“I love you, Sherlock.”
Watson sniffed and looked pointedly at the postcard. “Which one did Andrew leave behind?”
Sherlock deftly removed the condom, tied it off, and wrapped it in a tissue.
“The Bard says, ‘The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.’”
“Thanks to you, my dear boys. The board has voted: you’re all invited to play the role of fairies next year, especially the Detective Inspector.”
“Bored.”
“No, I want to be fucked today.” Jim released the gun, and Seb twisted away and returned the gun to its place. Then he twined his fingers in Jim’s.
“No, Sebby.”
On this second morning, Holmes had convinced Watson to come down for breakfast. Mrs. Hudson had done her part in rewarding Watson’s effort by featuring smoked kedgeree among the table’s delicacies.
“When one has lived four hundred years, human laws are merely suggestions.”
It was the kind of cold, crisp winter night that John enjoyed. The pavement and paths themselves were clear, but along the edges, tall, craggy mounds, the dirty remnants of the previous week’s heavy snowfall, loomed.
“Good night, Watson.”
“I look forward to it.”
Though he was rapidly sweating through his shirt, all Lestrade really wanted was a…

“Yes. Something important, something left by mistake.”
Sherlock stepped slowly towards the stairs.
“My sitting room is not your laboratory. Take your chemistry home!”
Sherlock nodded. He glanced at the rucksack. “Doctor?”

“Silk,” he repeated. Then his eyes fluttered open. “Oh, can’t get distracted,” he said in a quiet sing-song voice.
You gush, syllables as well as sweat, tears, saliva, prickly oozings.
“You’re the wonder, Sherlock. You’re the one strutting, too.”
“It and you are both very large knobs. Finish the job and come home!”

I nod. “A black dragon which takes to the sky, breathing fire, reducing Hell and then the garden of cavorting Watsons to ashes. I grab hold of its tail and it ferries me back to the quiet garden.

“Sherlock, do you remember—?”
“For the hundredth time, no, it isn’t drugged!” snapped Sherlock.
“You’re looking good, Molly. New dress?”
Then, Molly in her Christmas jumper and woolly socks, spreading her legs in the window seat, flashing those red knickers. Her eyes were closed. She was touching herself, making herself wet. He watched the red centre of knickers grow darker with every passing moment.
“Zero regrets,” I said, placing my hand atop his, “a life full and long.”
“Quantity might increase,” Mycroft continued, “while quality…”
Grey eyes blinked. “Sorry?”

“If I can convince it to eat you first…”
“Baby, you’re making me too hard. I can’t hold out, not against you, not in those.”
She circled the desk.
The dreadful moment had arrived.
It was painful for Mycroft to let his emotions run free, but he braced himself and allowed Lestrade to study his face and wonder at motives and craft his response.
Mycroft hummed and wiggled his arse, which only made Sherlock want to pound him harder, which he did while singing,

She replied by nodding towards the establishment behind me.
Seb swallowed his cock with much less preamble than when he’d slit his neck, Jim thought idly, as he studied the blood and felt the burn and listened to the little grunts Seb made when he was trying to find a rhythm.
His phone beeped.
“To Eden.”
“Do you want to go home, Margaret?”
“The Decagon club is a sex club, Sherlock, isn’t it?”
I smile. He’s on the mend, indeed.
“Gregory.”

It was going to be so good.
“Yes?”
“Spanish is my mother tongue.”
“Cheers.”
“Yeah.”
Seb shoved his woolly hat on his head and growled.
“I’m an idiot,” grumbled John.
John laughed at himself. “Of course. Sorry.”
Then, in the window, one hand began to crisscross the chest, fondling each breast in turn while the other hand traveled up to rest at the base of a swan-like neck.
“Holmes,” I said softly, reassuringly, affectionately, “I love you, too, but what are these symbols?”
For the Kinktober Day 14 prompt: Role Reversal.
Sherlock was on the floor. He stared at John, wide-eyed, and brought a hand to his bleeding lip.
She waited in the hotel bar, sipping a cocktail, the specialty of the house, until her room was ready.
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
If Kate’s eyes deceived her, if that voice wasn’t the husky purr she heard in her dreams—and nightmares—if that scent could be replicated and bottled and sold to someone else, she would still know it was her.
I glance up from my reading.
“—and you sprang into the street. You passed by me on your way out. I was, of course, breakfasting in the style of one who is not a savage invalid, that is to say, at a table, and followed with your coat and slippers. Per your instance, we went straight to Scotland Yard.”
“Or games that require a pawn, Holmes? The scale of your Reichenbach ruse was much more grievous than that of Baskerville. You kept me in the dark for years! And relied on my grief, my genuine mourning for you, for your success. I can understand the logic of it, but I cannot relish such a role. Or but dread its encore.”
Sherlock’s bedroom door squeaked.
She smiled and squeezed tight round his cock.
“And it’s not even my birthday.”
Sherlock leaned forward and hissed in Mycroft’s ear. “I’m going to piss my come up in you, Brother Mine, but only if you beg.”
She thrust slowly, then faster, then, at his urging, even faster. When she was tired, she slicked her hand and curled it round his stiff prick.
“I draw closer to the dark pool, but then I realise that the obsidian stones which line the bottom of the pool are not stones at all.”
“Have you a second key?” asked Lestrade.
“…but I was thinking of this.”
“Sorry, Sherlock. As utterly fuckable as you are and as much as I want to fuck you, this was a bad idea. It’s too hot.”
“You look fabulous,” said John. He brushed Sherlock’s lips with his own.
Irene kept her expression neutral, but she couldn’t help staring. She knew Molly’s breasts as well as her own, and those were…
“There, perfectly wrapped.”
“My pussy’s wet, Daddy.”
“I understand what it is to take extreme measures to remedy the boredom of life. But he helped himself to my penknife, a gift from my grandmother which she’d once used to slit the throat of Barbary pirate, and I advised him in no uncertain terms that I would reclaim it one day.”
Sally eyed the bottle of rum as Stella ladled dark red liquid from a bowl into a glass.
“I’ve barricade myself in the bedroom.”
“It certainly is. Here, John.”

Seb’s fingers travelled along the leather to the ring and the strap.
“It is a remarkable volume. Watson and I agree on that point,” mused Holmes. “I suppose I shan’t have need of such a work, seeing as I have Watson to chronicle my exploits as we go along, so to speak.”
“Good afternoon, ladies. This way.”
“But,” persisted Sherlock, “over a forty-eight-hour period, say, on holiday. That might be a fair playing field. Laboratory conditions.”
Anxiety about Jim sat in the back of her mind all day, and when she had a spare moment, she wondered just what he was up to.
“You’re not shaving your moustache?!”
“You, Detective Inspector?”
“Hello, Sherlock. You look—”
“No, Watson, I have no desire for any monument No preposterously contorted semblance of my former self in stone or brass on a tall pedestal. Certainly not a figure that the average person has to crane the head to see properly.” He looked around and sighed. “Perhaps, though, a bench would do. A place where weary ramblers can rest their feet, where friends can elect to meet to converse, and most of all, a place to go when the world presents its seemingly insurmountable obstacles and confounding problems, as it often does, a place to find repose and to think.”
Jim drives the snakes out of Molly's office (but, of course, he put them there, too). Outdoor sex.
“Of course.”
I might have even compared Holmes to a sculpture, one of those that appear so lifelike, except that he was no stone, even in sleep.
“Both is good,” said John as he yanked his pyjama bottoms down and off.
Then he took the first bite.
“How about you take a horsey ride on Daddy’s lap afterwards?”
“I’m human. I have the same number of hours everyone else has. I suppose it’s a question of where I want to put my efforts during those hours. Yes, I could have you fired. It would take time and unpleasantness, and I have absolutely no wish to do it. A war? No, I can’t start a war, and I don’t really need to, there are plenty about to pick if I fancy playing those kinds of games, but once again, not really interesting.”
“These are strange times,” he said, turning his head and eyeing the array of baked goods.
“It’s been ages.”
Sherlock sniffed. “I was having fun.”
Seb grinned and handed over the parasol.
“Did you say my name aloud when you came?”

“Sixteen. Like that metal in your mouth?”
“A-patch?”
“By Jove,” I muttered under my moustache. “How did our library cards get switched? And what on earth could interest Holmes that much?” I lifted the plain red cover to glance at the title page. “Good Lord!
But I needn’t have disturbed myself.
“Holmes!”
John caresses Sherlock’s face, then gently tugs on Sherlock’s bottom lip. “Can you answer me, Baby? You don’t have to use your words, but it would make me feel better. Can you be good for me?”
“Holmes, do you think there could be anything inside that?”
“Missed you.”

John began to giggle. “I don’t know that I can now.”
“—of balloons that pop,” muttered Holmes, rolling his eyes.
Two, one. Two, one.
“Enjoy your book,” he said, then turned and fled the shop.
“But how are you—?” I sputtered for the music was, indeed, still playing.
Then his entire prick-head was being suckled. Then the tip of a tongue teased his slit.
“How shall we end the night, my queen?”
“Yes, sir,” mumbled Sally.
“Has it affected you, my dear Watson?”
“Some might call it a classic, even.”
Sherlock let out a loud, satisfied moan as John bottomed out. Then he whispered,
“I am not accustomed to displaying emotions even in very private settings among trusted persons.”
As Sherlock Holmes neared his third birthday, Mycroft began to wonder, with mixed disappointment and relief, if his younger brother were normal. As far as Mycroft could tell, Sherlock showed no signs of heightened intelligence, but Mycroft admitted that his own grasp of what a three-year-old should and should not be able to do was tenuous. Nevertheless, he decided to test Sherlock.
…drip, drip, drip.
John smiled and reached for him.
Lestrade was licking from Mycroft’s left nipple to the ridge of his shoulder. Then he covered Mycroft’s body with his once more and ground his hips into Mycroft’s. He sank his teeth gently into Mycroft’s skin and groaned. He licked, then bit, at Mycroft’s neck, then the tip of his chin, then his lower lip. Then he sat up and removed his dress shirt.
I ended up living in rooms in Queen Anne Street for a period after that, although ‘living’ is an exaggeration as I’d left behind most of my belongings, and when I was not at my surgery or with Holmes on a case, I was staring at a blank wall, contemplating his confession of love and his proposal to retire together.

Sherlock turned in his chair. “John?”
Then, sometimes, John licks Sherlock’s hole open and fucks him. Then, sometimes, John slicks his own prick, slides it between Sherlock’s thighs, and comes. Then, sometimes, John turns Sherlock just enough to take Sherlock’s prick in his mouth and suck. Then, sometimes, John simply watches his lover, the most beautiful creature in the world, still and slumbering, while he, John takes himself in a slicked hand and finds his own release.

“John. Sherlock. How are things?”
Lestrade raised an eyebrow.
They chatted amicably about books for a few minutes, then there was an awkward pause.
“Was there a very large strawberry or a boar wearing a nun’s habit?”
John exhaled the breath he’d been holding.
“Oh, Holmes, you ol’ softie. You want us to take charge of that handsome, well-tempered Setter until Mrs. Forester’s son returns for him?”
Sherlock put his feet on the bed and lifted his lower half, pushing into John’s touch.
“You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”
He rolls and the penny drops.
He hummed and kissed my cheek.
Jim hummed. He also placed his feet flat on the bed, just in case, but the humming worked.
The revelers were still at their merry-making when our hansom cab began its slow return to Baker Street.

“On the surface, very little, but, curiously, human beings are extremely willing to blame any phenomena outside the norm on having eaten this dish prior to retiring for the night. It’s quite remarkable. They will happily blame any maneuvers by ghouls, ghosts, possessed furnishings, oh, the list is endless, on the consumption on a Welsh rarebit. You can invade their dreams, their homes, their gardens, their ancestors’ graves, even their very persons and terrorise them to no end, and they’ll say, ‘Oh, it was all that Welsh rarebit I had for supper.’ And so, in behooves you, my dear, to learn how to prepare this dish well and propagate its popularity among your employers. It will a great boon to you in the future and should you need to work with another agent, well, you can provide a very useful service.”
Not a bullet from a gun, or someone firing it, but rather one of those overly-sweet, ridiculously-flavoured, rudely-named cocktails served in tiny glasses at drinking venues that Mycroft wouldn’t have deigned to visit even if he was of the appropriate demographic to do so.

I slowly got to my feet, weighed more by the memory of my own foolishness than by the spirit flowing through my veins.
“Heh, heh! That’s my favourite villain! Are you going to wear your twirlable moustache?”
“Hello,” answered a soft voice.
Sally winced. “I’ve got to go.”

John navigated the stairs with eyes shut and burst into the sitting room where the scent was even stronger.
“What?”
They’re still fucking.
John sighed at the last four squares of toast. “I don’t know, Sherlock. I’m very full.”
John hummed.
Fear manifests itself in thick, wooly blankets and thick, wooly jumpers and thick, wooly scarves and hats and gloves and socks. In hot cups of tea and hot bowls of soup and hot baths. In a hell-worthy inferno roaring in the fireplace.
Holmes wondered just who it was in Watson’s life who wasn’t listening. And he felt the sting of being the ‘no one’ who clung to every word.
I did not know for how long Holmes had been thinking upon the subject prior to checking out the book, but he’d had the book itself for nine weeks.
“Holmes.” I took him in my arms and held him tight. “Some people store their resentments for a long time and let them fester and build. I am not one of those people. And I am not unhappy. Far from it. I adore you just the way you are.”
“You’ve been naughtier.”
“Thank you…”
“Fourteen. Christ, you

He set the phonograph playing again. Now he was in his dressing gown alone. He placed a jar of unguent on the small table beside him as he sat on a straight chair before me with legs spread.
“How so?”
Lestrade laughed again. “Mycroft, I’ve been thinking, well, a lot and a long time. Well, I don’t know if you even…”
“Heh, heh. Need my cock for reference?”
And though it was too soon, John felt his body stir again as he watched Mycroft mount Sherlock and fuck him ruthlessly.
Yes, that’s also a good one.
“And he’s still in his cups?” I suggested.
I heard another noise.
“Hobgoblins of little minds, Seb? Do you have to blow up every old lady I see? That would put a crimp in the ol’ schedule, wouldn’t it? And that was Sherlock. What now?”
Agog.
Sherlock squinted at the near-faded words. “Abracadabra?”
He was quite pleased with himself when John forgot what he was about. Twice.
And feeds.
He was, naked, kneeling upon a very fine bed and gazing upon an equally fine arse while holding his hard, leaking prick in his hand.
Lestrade produced a pair of handcuff and held them in the air.
He grinned and lumbered towards the bench perpendicular to mine. He didn’t sit so much as rest his weight on it until it creaked.
“Cabbage, Holmes?”

Mycroft’s eyes widened.
Now I am of the belief that a man’s bathing routine is his own. What I do to achieve the ‘cat-like cleanliness’ Watson attributes to me is a private matter as are the elements of Watson’s regimen. I know that he prefers a Turkish bath but as a man cannot be running down to Northumberland Avenue every time he requires a scrub behind the ears, he often makes use of the homemade article. I also know, based on complaints voiced by Mrs. Hudson, that Watson’s bathing displaces quite a bit more water than our long-suffering landlady believes is necessary to achieve any kind of cleanliness, save that of an animal the size of an elephant.
It was someone else.
He made to rise. I stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
Stella rubbed her foot against Sally’s cunt, flexing, then pointing, then wiggling her toes.
“Christ, you’re gorgeous.”
They rarely fucked in John’s bed, and some hours earlier, John had gone to bed alone, abandoning Sherlock to an experiment in the kitchen. The experiment was about mud. Or dirt. Or maybe sand. John had been too knackered to pay it much attention. It had to do with buckets. Several buckets.
“NO!”
I might have launched him against the wall. Or worse.
John’s face darkened. “That’s my fear, too. That one day an ex-Army doctor will be yesterday’s news.”

“Yes, Gregory. Just tying up a few loose ends. There.”
He remembered her voice once in a low, singsong teasing lilt as she’d reached for him.
Something soft pressed at her cheek, and she smelled an exhale of sweet-sour breath.
“How?”
He should’ve pushed off the door and got on with it, but he didn’t.
The cuddle Jim had been desiring was now nothing more than a wisp of memory.
“Oh, Martha, thank you so much for suggesting this. It’s been ages since I’ve been here. Or had a nice afternoon tea.”
“Yes, my queen. The world, anything in it, yours. Fuck, fuck…”
“He’s such a good boy, Harry.”
I sighed.
“No, the card does not mean what you think it means. No, you should not interpret it as a sign that you should take your own life tonight, or any other night.”
She took his hand in both of hers and said, “Have a good evening,” but was writing on his palm with her finger.
“Greg.”
Holmes snorted. “He saw you?”
“Ah, I see. What do you want, Mister Moriarty?”
“Foreplay? Yeah, that’s the point.”
John barked.
After that, John chose his moments so carefully that they were few and far between.
Lightly seasoned.
“Different ways of cooking them. Very moving.”
“Good morning, Toby,” said Jim.
“Oh, well, we can’t have that.”
“Both of which are plentiful at my flat.”
“I couldn’t wait.” Sherlock’s voice was raw, and John gave him credit for making a coherent statement when he was so close to the edge. “Mm?”
“All right, ladies, it’s wonderful to see all of you here tonight. We’ve three hot toddy offerings: whiskey—“
“Interesting. You need not to be bored. Funny enough, that’s what I need, too. Oh, we’re going to pals! Love the Dolce & Gabbana, by the way! Guess what? I changed my mind. That’s my one flaw. I’m so changeable!”
The knickers were tied with thin hot pink ribbon on each side. Mycroft reached over and pulled one of the ends and kept pulling until the whole ensemble was decorating the floor of the car.
Lestrade laughs as candles—candles so well hidden they seemed conjured from thin air—light spontaneously. “You know how to set the mood, don’t you?”
“One hand here, and one hand here.”
I sat, agog, at the fairy.
Mycroft blushed, then stammered, “G-g-gregory?”
“Kiss me.”
And then they’re kissing.
“Now, look a bit closer.”
Lestrade looked at his watch, then leaned closer. “There’s a couple more hours in it.”
“That’s my shirt!” protested John.
But it is something wicked enough to inspire folding me over the arm of the Baker Street settee, sodding me to bleeding, then fellating me to screaming, yes, screaming, at two o’ clock in the afternoon.
He laughed. “I think my demon, at least this one, is exorcised.”
We passed the night at a country inn.
“You, too, love. Now?”
Holmes snorted.
Lovers came, went…
There’s a hum round Seb’s prick that is the nicest thing he’s felt in ages.
Sherlock hummed and tapped the screen. “Last thing she wants? So, the opposite would be…? Pets, pets, pets. Ah. Here we go. And they live for twenty years. Much better than Tabby or Terry or whatever.”
“From a glance, reflected in a mirror—”
Sherlock lay bent and spent for a few moments, petting the chestnut coat, catching his breath. Eventually, he stood up and set himself to rights and left the platform.
I rushed to open a window.
“Fancy yourself in a bridle?”
Daft.
He wanted to suck her clit right then.
“You will know when it is time to don it.”
You’re drunk.
“See?” said the voice behind her. “He’s all right.”
“You’re only saying that because you haven’t seen Matthews yet,” said Jim with a shrug.
“…eight hours,” supplied Lestrade.
“Did you like it?”
“Yeah, yeah. Have a laugh and get me out.”
“Fuck,” whispered Sherlock.
Mycroft reached into his pocket and pulled out a wad of cotton handkerchief, which he carefully unfolded.
They stared at each other until Mycroft told the driver to leave him.
Jim didn’t need to see it to know it. After all, he’d spent the better part of afternoon picking it out.
Tight, but not too tight. Deep, beautifully deep. Welcoming, clenching.
“You were at the brothel?”
Moriarty stood under Mycroft Holmes, looking up, admiring his own handiwork.
“Good heavens! Sit down, my dear man.”
“And Woodhouse finally hanged.”
She fished two condoms from the pocket of her robe, and they used them both.
“I’m not naked, John. I’m wearing the Carllina ensemble with copious amount of body glitter and three-inch mules.”
“Your brother.”
“Newman was not a fortune-hunter, at least not in the sense he claimed. He was trying to hide the bullion he had stolen under the guise of recovered treasure, and he would’ve succeeded, he and his accomplices, if it hadn’t been for you. That business of switching the wheels of the wagon to muddy the tracks, so to speak, was very clever.” I made a resigned noise. “Ah, well. Newman and his crew didn’t get away with it.
“Not a real sacrifice,” chirped Kate.
“You just solved a locked-room, body-in-the-library murder, Sherlock,” whispered John as they watched the fracas, “without breaking a sweat.”
“How could I forget?” I replied as he passed by and launched into a thorough survey of the environs. “But even I don’t know where I am. I took a walk, happened upon a half-hidden gate and curiosity got the better of me. This might be the Garden of Eden, for all its lush seclusion.”
“No one listens anymore,” Watson had said over tea as they were waiting for the dogcart to take him to the station.
“But Mrs. Hudson?”
“Nineteen. His cock? In that mouth? In that arse? Hell, even between those pretty thighs.”
“Mrs. Hudson saved me from a blunder and, as compensation, she demanded that I take Bessie’s place for the day.”
“The last ‘someone’ was fifteen years ago. He’s growing tea in India these days.”
And so it was that I surfaced slowly, gradually from a dream I knew to be pure memory and then was launched, suddenly and abruptly, into abject wakefulness.
Mycroft fell to his knees. “I’m here.” He kissed Lestrade’s cheek, then cradled it in his palm. He looked up and asked coolly, “What do you want?”
Sherlock nodded. He nuzzled the front of Jim’s trousers. “There are cheaper ways.”
Tap-tap-tap.
Lips twitched. “Yes?”
And then they were drinking americanos and chatting amicably.

“So pretty, aren’t they? I love them.”
“He did work like a dog.”
Molly hummed, and fell back into Seb’s arms.
“And then some,” said Mycroft, watching.
“As ever, Watson, you see, but you do not observe.”
He glared. “Is genius wearying, Watson?”
“Many returns of the day, my dear man.”
“Right. Chicken. But gin, too, apparently.”
“I thought it a pity that they had to break the ceramic mask in the end. Understandable, necessary, but still.”

“You said you liked it.”
“Another nice round number. Oh, John!”
“Doctor Watson appeared as soon as the library opened, looking for meanings to the dying man’s final words and gestures. Liking puzzles and wanting to help, I ruminated on them after he’d left. If I’d been murdered, I’d want to communicate with my last breath something vital about the person who did it, and if I’d been strangled like Edwards, I’d have seen the forearm of the man up close. So maybe it was a birthmark or a tattoo. I remembered where I’d seen a similar symbol. I found what I sought, traditional tattoos and markings of the peoples of Madagascar. And I remembered that on the crew manifest that Doctor Watson had showed me there was a sailor named Rako, which might have been short for Rakotomalala. But I wasn’t certain, of course. And I’ve always been intrigued by the work you do…”
“It’s very curious,” I said, ignoring the twitch of Holmes’ lips which meant he knew very well I hadn’t been listening. “Why don’t you summarise the key points, Holmes, then maybe I’ll have a better idea.”

There was a giggling beneath Mycroft’s bed.
Sherlock bounced lower and lower. He flipped his tail smooth down the side of the platform, then with some, but certainly not all, of his head hidden behind a spray of plumes, nuzzled John’s crotch.

John looked down and shook his head. He’d thought he’d been imagining things when he’d heard the voice on the payphone.
I left Holmes to his hunting, and I set about my own.
“I said I was in the neighbourhood. We better step lively. We’ve got a body to bury and a fish to catch before she wakes up.”
Sherlock’s expression turned scornful. “If you’re suggesting that any orgasm experienced by my Omega would be subpar…”
“Even better.”
We were given our scraps of paper. Mine did not say ‘Smee.’ The lights were turned out, and I waited with the others. Then there was a bell, which indicated the hunt for Smee could begin.
“You are,” interrupted Holmes. “And when I look at you, that’s who I see: who you are, who you’ve always been, brave, loyal, stout-hearted, compassionate.”
“Mine.” A wink. “All mine.” A head spun ‘round, taking in the room. “How about on the sofa? A bit of the ol’ ‘you show me yours, etcetera’?”
“No, please! I’m dying. Don’t go!”
“Not as behind as you think you are. Here let me take that from you. Wouldn’t want to spill,” he said.
“Drop your pretty knickers,” said Mycroft in a slightly louder voice.
He smiled and poured two glasses of an iced concoction which was the same colour as his lovely frock, a frock, I noted, of a fabric so flimsy as to lay plain the ruffled knickers beneath.
“Yes, please.”

Author's Notes: For the Holmes Minor September prompt 'stitches' & for my Ladies Bingo square G-3 'Relationship Study.'
By one o’clock the heat was such that my sweat-soaked shirt hung on a hook outside the garden shed. I was not expecting any visitors, and I knew Holmes, despite being equally absorbed in tending his hives, would alert me to any unexpected arrivals. If he whistled, I’d make myself presentable as quickly as possible.
Mycroft nodded.
Beautiful, yes, graceful, yes, as precise and telling as the scientific instruments they manipulated, yes, but I’d forgot how strong until that rare display of pure grip!
I gazed at the rush of waters and, in pure selfishness, allowed myself the luxury of single cold shiver.
The darkness lifted to reveal a hovering figure with a long neck, a pair of glowing oval eyes, and, atop a grey bulbous head…
The first 200 words were written for DW drabble zone prompt (#122): seeking shelter.
“A Suffering Bastard.”
Lestrade slid closer and put a hand to Mycroft’s jaw and kissed him.
Stella smiled. “So, no dinner?”
“Let’s fill him up with naughty spunk,” sang Mycroft. He moved his hands back to Sherlock’s head and began to thrust in earnest.
I said nothing, merely cleaned my supplies and bundled up the soiled linen.
Her body was gorgeously swathed in silk undergarments of a cranberry-coloured that was…
“I left a note,” said Sally. She took Stella’s hand in hers and kissed the fingertips. “You know I’d been getting nowhere on this case. I was in the shower, and I suddenly made a connection. I wasn’t certain anything would come of it. I just wanted to check it out myself before I mentioned it at work.”
“You…are…getting…sleepy.”
I was adjusting the flame of the burner beneath a bubbling flask of what Watson had called ‘witch’s brew’ when I heard it.
He reappeared and placed it beside me on the table.
“Hey, hey, hey, my father made his choices. Hudson and Beddoes made theirs. You just, you know, saw the tip of the cat’s tail before everybody else did. As usual. That’s all. Hey.” He sunk a hand in Holmes’s dark hair and gripped him hard, holding him steady, as he kissed him, hard and desperate. “Remember, you’re proud butterfly.”
“Please, drop your pretty little knickers!”
The kitten stared.
Holmes’s features lost their angularity as drops formed rivulets and streams form rivers.
Jim shook his head. “There is no scheme that will ever require that. There’s only so much risk to you I am willing to tolerate. Plus, if it ever fell through and we divorced, who would get custody of Seb?”

“Will it even wo—?”
Lestrade laughed. “You’re full of surprises, Mycroft Holmes.” He tilted the lid back, then offered the empty cup to Mycroft. “One for yourself?”
Holmes blinked. “You really believe that?”
He felt nervous. He’d come to do a hit, and he felt nervous!
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand. “We can just make the second half if we hurry.”
He smiled. “I used my knowledge of chemistry for profit instead of problem-solving, but the recent sugar shortage put my business in jeopardy, just when I had almost realised enough profits to complete the purchase of this place. I hope you will join me here when we retire, Watson, and I hope you will forgive my subterfuge. I was looking for sugar amongst the most likely places in the East End. When I learned there was none to be found, I had to go abroad. I was successful. Business resumed. This cottage is ours, if you’ll have me. What say you?”
Holmes, Watson, OC
With effort and assistance, I sat up. Dawn was breaking, and there was a mound of about a hundred pounds of duckweed lying beside me.

“Where did you say you were?”
“I’d say, a cup of coffee, a glass of water, and I’ll fuck you into the mattresses, good sir.”
” The last was a weary huff. “’Tis odd, though, to have the rest of your life coloured by such a blink of an eye.”
After a week of sleepless nights, I cut loose the past. What Holmes had said and done and my own blindness to whole bloody affair haunted me as did the suffering that some of my actions, though performed in ignorance, had surely caused him. Studying yesterday with today’s wisdom, however, was not only futile, it distracted from the business of tomorrow.
“Oh, look, mistletoe! Mrs. Hudson must’ve done some holiday sprucing while we were out.”
“A bit.”
Author's Note: I put on my best Watson aura and used an online tarot reading service and got three cards. I used the parts of the interpretation which best fit the story. For the LJ Holmes Minor monthly prompt: card.
“Sure!”
“…work of art entitled ‘The Fall of the Gingerbread House of Usher’ takes the cake!”
Sherlock licked his own fingertips and slipped his hands beneath John’s toga. As he teased John’s nipples, John began to rut anew.
“And you did all the renovations yourself. Brilliant.”
“Finally.”
POOF!
“Just as I am?” teased Molly.
Singing.
Molly hummed. One of her hands was resting lightly on a head of dark hair; the other dropped and her fingertips dipped into the plastic cup and brushed the melting whipped crème. She brought the white frothy sweetness to her lips and sucked.
“Baker Street, Doctor Watson.”
Mycroft squeaked. “Again!”
First time writing this pair.
The door opened.
Mrs. Hudson flushed, then her expression sobered. “You didn’t forget Doctor Watson.”
“Open and shut,” he said, holding up a white rectangle. “Thief left his card.”
Lestrade shook his head at the puzzle. “Sherlock Holmes is a bloody genius.”
“Well, I had a nice time,” said John.
For Kinktober 2021 Day 3: Body Worship.
I turned. “Why?”
“Listen, you need to know: I’m broken, as an Omega, as a Guide, as anything.”
“Yeah, that’s where I wanna be. Right there. Fuck!”
“But you don’t—oh!”
Seb woke to the click of metal and the scent of the salt water. His fingers immediately went to the tightness at his neck.
“Sparkling wine, John. It cannot be called ‘champagne’ because—“
“At times,” I admitted.
“You mean politically?”
“Perhaps I should sell some of my pajamas,” Holmes said, just before I silenced our mutual giggling with a long kiss.
“And you can just—oh, God—up and down, just like that?”

Lestrade was behind the wheel. He smiled at the road in front of them and began his recital of the facts of the case.
“Free show for the neighbours. Don’t worry, if they give you any trouble, I’ll arrest them.”
Kate didn’t need to sink into her role. She’d been there since she started her journey, following the cryptic clues—learnt by rote and burnt—step by step to this frozen corner of the world. She was good at following instructions, made for it, in fact.
“Oh, he did, did he? Just what did he confess?” MacCoy took a long sip, then another, then groaned. “Christ, this is my last drink.”
“BLOODY HELL, YOU’RE NOT A HYPNOTIST!”
Mycroft did an about-face, once again showing his arse to the mirror.
Title page, yes.
“I’m going to clean you now. It won’t be comfortable.”
And the last thing Sherlock thought before he let the Machine take over:

“Once more, my queen? Please.”
Mike patted his sides. “Left it in my coat.” He turned to John. “Excuse me. Just a second.”
“Guess who has been assigned to oversee security for the event?”
But those little drinks were not good. They were too sweet in Mycroft’s opinion.
“Indeed.”
“How on earth did you guess that?!”
A faint blush rose in Sherlock’s cheeks, which turned crimson when John said,
“The art of love, sir.”
“Well,” said Lestrade.
“When I’m ready,” said Kate but she knew that she was nearing the edge of her own sanity, so she reached for the slick at once. She closed her eyes as she stroked her cock, imagining a different Irene from the one laid out on the bed, one that was not beaten and bloodied. She opened her eyes long enough to crawl upon the bed safely.

John recognises that voice. John/Mycroft. Alt 1st Meeting. ASiP. Phone sex.
“What time? I imagine you’re an early bird.”
“Fuck!" exclaimed Lestrade at the brush of Mycroft’s cock deep inside him.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
“What? Detective Inspector!”
“You first!”

Sally leaned in for a kiss.
“Where?”
“The dumplings? Always, John.”
Sherlock’s voice softened. “I nibble that spot on the right side of your neck, the one that makes you sigh.”
I followed her instructions to the letter, and upon viewing the result, that good lady pronounced, without artifice, “Oh, well done, Doctor!”
Moriarty looked up and chuckled. “Oh, that was worth it all. The panic on your face. Don’t worry, Sherly. My kisses are spooktacular.”
“Harder, Johnny, please. And bite, please, bite them.”

When she finally bit into a dark mound, she moaned.
In the early hours before dawn, Irene hurried along the street.
“Not exactly. What do I look like, beside the black wings, I mean?”
“We’ve been parked in my garage for half an hour, Gregory.”
Lestrade held out her palm.
The show, of course, had another purpose.
There was more kissing while Irene added a third finger and began to thrust, in and out; her thumb rubbed about Kate’s clit.

“Do you know what that bastard was studying?”

“Have you thought about where you’d like to have this garden?”
There was something glorious about the change of season, and this one, with its waning light and its crisp nights and its harvest colours, was my favourite.
“There’s a vacant stall approximately fifteen paces to your left.”
Then John presses his nose into Sherlock’s hair and breathes in the fragrance of poncey shampoo. Then he kisses down and up the entire length of Sherlock’s spine.

Kate returned with a thin, lacy gown and a belt with a huge medallion buckle.
Sally’s face fell.
“Let me look. Gone. Every bit.”
They drank in silence for a few minutes.
I lick, in overlapping swathes, from the cleft of Watson’s arse to the nape of his neck, following his spine as a boat follows a winding river.

“With my unconventional gifts and disposition? No, Watson—”
“Sorry I can’t offer you something more sophisticated,” said Lestrade as he handed Mycroft the mug. “Just the powdered stuff but made with milk.”
“’Will you walk into my parlor?’”
One auburn eyebrow rose. “Detective, you seem …”
She leaned back once more against the window pane and opened her legs. One hand was petting her patch of hair while the other was lower, a single finger pushing inside.
“Naughty girl,” he teased, resting his hands on her hips as she lifted off him slightly. “Here I am waxing all poetic, and all you want to do is…”
“Sleuth-hound, remember?”
“A mistletoe hat.” Sherlock shot a hand forward in an arch from his forehead, then made a fist.
When John emerged, Sherlock held out his jacket. “Sorry.”
“Smee?”
“Um,” Lestrade stopped. “Mine?”
Moriarty visits Sherlock. Sheriarty. Hate sex. The dialogue is lifted from the 1945 Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes film "The Woman in Green."
“Yeah,” said John, nuzzling, then kissing the bulge in the fabric.

Well, thought Sherlock, that solves the problem of room temperature champagne.
He withdrew his cock completely and bent low. His thumbs wiped half-tears from eyes, then his palms brushed cheeks. His fingers curled under to massage a jaw that might be a bit sore tomorrow.
Mrs. Hudson walked towards the settee with her head high and her jaw set.
This is a first, sleeping before fucking. They’d fumbled a bit in the car between the pub and the flat, but the case, the buggered-to-hell case had left Lestrade a walking corpse.
“Fist?”
Mycroft strode into the room.

The Detective Inspector’s cheeky smile before he pronounced the last word left no doubt in Mycroft’s mind.

“Damn you!”
He stepped forward, prick in hand.

“It’s yours, you know. I got it for you.”
John’s eyebrows reached his hairline as he watched himself licking Sherlock’s nipples.
“And wanted him dead,” Holmes echoed.
“Me, too.”
“What?! You’re joking!”
I was thinking about the case.
“Dark hair in soft curls that are begging to be touched. Cool grey eyes the colour of my gran’s Persian cat. Kissable lips in a natural pout. Face and chest like a Renaissance sculpture. Tattoo on the left shoulder which matches the one on your cheek. In a nutshell, you look sexy as hell.”

“Happy Easter! We come bearing a gift,” said John. He opened a box and began to tease away the cloth that enveloped the object which lay within.
“And the uniform. Heh, heh.”
She woke once to him rubbing her nipples and cleavage with his come, woke again to his tongue in her arse. She suckled his prickhead once. She felt his prick inside her more than once.
You take a long swig, then sigh.
The back of Mycroft’s head hit the wall next to the door as Lestrade’s body slammed into his.
“Here,” said Holmes, producing a box.
Lestrade’s eyebrows rose, and he pressed his lips together and stared pointedly at Mycroft’s towel which was beginning to tent.
He kissed her long and hard and slipped a hand under her nightshirt and squeezed her arse.
He laughed. “Your Solomon-siring days are over, my good man, when Mrs. Hudson sees what you’ve done to the new rug!”
“May I?”
“Who’s probably cursing the loss of his prop!” I added. “Oh, good, I hear Holmes and Lestrade on the stairs.”

As Sherlock had silently predicted, by the time he had scrubbed his entire body with the hottest water he could stand and set all his clothes apart for thorough laundry, John was dead to the world, face-down in the bedding and snoring.
And to warmth.
Sherlock and Mycroft stared.
“No.”
Mycroft unfastened his trousers.
“How powerful are you, really, Mycroft?”
Good Lord, I’m not the headmaster! Not even in my untoward fantasies!
Mycroft closed her eyes, trying not to purr. She leaned into the petting and it continued, along with the chanting, “Such, such good care of me, always.”

“Fairies,” corrected the three in unison.
Something inside me seeks release, freedom.
Without a word, Mycroft yanked down the front of his knickers. His cock sprang free and Lestrade gobbled it down as his hands explored.
“There. How do you feel, Watson?”
“Yeah, I know.”
I hummed in agreement. “The braiding of many ribbons round the pole.” I smiled at the memory, but then my smile faded. “It was a shame that one juvenile error in judgement should pave the way for,” I sighed, “a senseless loss of life.”

She ripped her gaze from Jim’s suckling to watched Seb’s prick disappear inside Jim’s hole.
John sat back on his heels, gasping, the lower half of his face wet. “I think the situation calls for a bit more leverage, don’t you?”
“Yes, Daddy!”
Hear that? Of course, you do. Your hearing, like all your senses, is exceptional.
“Well, now you have two, should you wish to politely decline one.”
They were panting. Then Molly said quickly, almost desperately,
She simply feeds.
“Your penchant for American breakfast cereal is embarrassing, Seb. And offensive.”
“You’re welcome,” said Stella. She gave Sally’s arse a playful squeeze. “I wasn’t the only one worried. Lestrade was frantic. Even Sherlock was upset.”
“This Witches’ Brew is quite good.” Sherlock slurped the last of the cocktail and set the glass on a passing tray. He began to shimmy.

Toby meowed inquiringly at the beep.
“Show Daddy your knickers, Sugar.”
“That wasn’t love. That was madness. Obsession. Hubris.”

The prosecutor went pink but recovered quickly. “You could not have seen what you claim to have seen, Miss Mohels, at that spot on the night in question. You are mistaken. Do you wear glasses when you are not plying your art?”

When he was sashaying with ease, he stopped and stood, with a hip cocked to one side, in black knickers and black hold-ups.
He might have materialised out of the ether. He wasn’t there, then he was. His body pressed against hers. His hands slipped under her arms and cupped her breasts. His lips were against her neck. His voice lost its teasing quality when he spoke again, breath warming her skin.
Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.

When the load was shot down Seb’s throat, he coughed a little. But just a little.
Sally grinned.
Seb grinned. “Sorry, Molls. I’ve always wanted to do that!”
“But it’s a commission, Mycroft.”
“I didn’t—“
He opened the door.
“Always, but I’d rather you come for me first.”
“Elsewhere? With whom?”
“You’re my charge, Mister Holmes! My ward, if you will, for the next twenty-four hours!”
John said, “I’m going to go see about—“
It was some time before order was restored to the court, and then I realised that Holmes didn’t just request my presence as an audience to his theatrical grandstanding; the notes I took were to post his bail when they charged him with contempt, which they did.
He closes his eyes and strokes his prick, letting tiny sighs escape when he thinks of Mycroft’s hand on him. He tries to match the rhythm of his fantasy. He’d love to slick a finger and tease his rim with the other hand, but his position on the bed, on his side, won’t allow for that, not without possibly disturbing John.
“Don’t finish this without me,” Violeta said as she fit one more piece in. Then she got to her feet and ruffled Lomax’s hair and left.

Jim made a motion with his hand.

“Succumb to your charms so readily?”
“My?”
John can’t believe it. He stands up as Sherlock turns. He hesitates. Is he supposed to follow?
John smiled. “Yeah, then I’ll say I want to mount you, split you open, breed you, make you mine. It’s all fine. You’re still Sherlock. I’m still John.”
The hand with the gun faltered slightly, but it was enough. I lunged and tore it away.
“Bees are good for flowers,” remarked Watson. Then he frowned. “Of tomatoes, I’m not certain.”
The hand on the throat did not move, but the hand on the breasts slipped lower and lower.

Without meeting Mycroft’s gaze, Sherlock releases his cock and extends his hand over John’s prone body. His cupped palm is soon filled with slick.

Then he grunts. It’s a noise of contradiction; like satisfaction at his stretched hole being finally,
“Good morning, Sherlock.”
“Thank you,” said Irene.
Irene's had a bad day. Irene/Molly. D/s. Flogging. Restraints.
too nice a day to be inside working, but I could have just said I had the flu or something.”
Seb slipped out of the jacket, then out of his shirt, then put the jacket back on over his bare chest. “Better?”
“May I help you, sir?”
John pulled off his jumper. And then his vest. And then he crawled up the bed towards Sherlock.
“Please have a seat. Your tea will be served momentarily.”
Bathing, swimming, washing in darkness.
My body tensed, but I mastered my animalistic urge and withdrew abruptly.
“Ah.”
tucked tightly under his arm. Even he knew the melody:
“Yes, Inspector.” Lomax met the searching glance with a click of his heels and a slight bow. “Francisco Lomax de Serrano, at your service. English father, Spanish mother.”
“A what?”
“Well, uh, the truth is I’ve been having a bit of trouble in the romance division.”
What candle could ever burn brighter than your gaze the moment our eyes first met? What hearth could ever bestow more heat than that come-hither stare with which you branded my skin, my spirit, my soul so long ago?
“Hi! Welcome to ‘My Fair Lady’ karaoke Night at Cheers!”
At this, Grodman’s face lost a bit of its rubicund tint. He absentmindedly extended a hand to his side, but when his fingers brushed the quilt, he drew them back as if scalded.
“Killer bees!”
“You, sexy.”
Lomax’s eyes and mouth formed round saucers of surprise.
“Ah, well.”
Mycroft and Lestrade act out the film noir scene from TFP. Cross-dressing. Role-play. Handcuffs.
“I took pity.”
“I brought him a toy,” said Jim. “But I forgot it in my pocket. He must’ve gotten tired of waiting for it.”
“Irish coffee,” said Moriarty.
“The 1956 version has noir elements that appeal.”
“Molly.”

John took out his pocket-knife and opened the box. Then he set knife and box on the table and reached inside the box. Soon he was holding a pair of red cotton pants that said NAUGHTY in gold across the arse.
The fox licked its lips, and Mycroft felt a strange sensation crawl up and down his spine.
“Sebbie, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have doubted you.”
“Oh, yeah?” Dark eyes widened. “Be good, and I’ll make it worth your while.”
“Mine? Seb’s?”
“Three days is more than enough time to wreck you.”
I woke to a soft eruption of laughter emanating from the sitting room. Immediately, there was a caress of my shoulder and then the tapping on my hip resumed.
“Which is?”
For that, I, a stranger to prayer, will beg Providence.
“You look good enough to eat.”
“An early start that apparently includes saluting the dawn with our naked arseholes!”
“Sleepwear. Nightdresses, undergarments, and the like. The shop had a secret passageway leading to a side door where the goods might be collected by their purchasers.”
You nodded. “Otherwise, there’s only Mrs. Hudson. And Essie.”
Sherlock lunged back for a rough kiss.
She clung to a column and shuddered through her orgasm, but when her eyes opened, there was no one beneath the voluminous folds of her dress.
I hummed and took that living hand, so warm and capable, in mine and fell asleep.
“Might make a better tale.”
But as he near the cottage, he frowned. Through the windows, he saw no sign of Holmes in the sitting room.
John’s shot hit the outside edge of the target.
“Yes?” prompted Mycroft.
He was the puppet. The mouth was the puppeteer.
Sherlock Holmes was a mystery. Though I accompanied him on many adventures, I never knew the full extent of his professional dealings. My chronicles are more than the tip of the iceberg, but they don’t tell every story because, quite simply, I don’t know every story.
“What’s that, Watson?”
“Happy Christmas, Detective Inspector,” said Mycroft with a nod of the head, which made him feel a bit player in a Dickens drama, but then he supposed that there was more truth than fiction to the notion.
“What?” asks Mycroft softly.
“He saw you. In which hand was he holding the umbrella?”
“Would you like the last s’more?”
“Naughty sociopath. Okay, Daddy’s had enough. This stench is going to be hell on the Westwood.”
“I am a professional problem-solver, not unlike yourself, Doctor. May I?”
“Whether there’s enough milk for your morning tea is a stronger predictor than the lunar phase.”
Seb winced. “You two are definitely going to kill me.”
It was the morning of the second day of Watson’s convalescence after being shot by the man who went by many names including John Garrideb.
“Mister Holmes!”
“Your arse, Sherlock. Your cock. Everything in between. You love being tongue-fucked. And sucked off. And when I tease the bit in-between without touching either end.”
And another.
“Home, Georges.”
“Hell, yes.” Lestrade’s empty bottle hit the table with a thud.
“Oh, yeah, I’ll give that one a workout. Unless you’d prefer to…”
“What a delicious thought!”
“And once you dress, you and your sister will be escorted to Simpson’s for lunch,” said Mister Holmes.
“Well, for the record, I think your tongue is just as sensitive as it ever was,” said Watson cheekily, as they made their return to the cottage hand-in-hand, “but, of course, more spice can be arranged.”
Sherlock pressed his face to John’s belly.
“Trevor.”
A Parasol is Lillet Blanc, St. Germain, honey syrup, lemon juice, and champagne.
“It’s so crowded that I didn’t see you until now. Not very observant of me, no? But, to be honest, you’re one of the last people that I’d expected to see in a place like this. Come here often?” He asked with a laugh. “I do, by the way,” he added.

The green fairy might have been about to yawn, at least it opened its minute mouth, but I heard the words in as clear a tongue as ever I heard.
He hummed. “Promise?”
“One needn’t be especially observant to see yours was a troubled kip. What were you dreaming of?”
“I’m sorry, Boss. It’s not going to happen. I’ll harm you.”
Mycroft hummed and closed his eyes. “Among other areas.”
“Why haven’t I read about this in the paper? Oh, there was a suicide.”
“What would you like?” asked Jim. “Me leaving is an option.”
“I know. I saw the video. Oh, Molly.”
When she returned, she was naked from the waist down. She coated the end of the umbrella handle with lubricant.
Mrs. Hudson and Bessie burst in with the rest of the breakfast things, bestowing upon Holmes their own good wishes for his day.
“I was on the morgue database and happened to dip into the personnel files. Your supervisor will make the announcement tomorrow. All long overdue. So, I brought Pinky’s house.” Sherlock gestured to an enormous glass tank in the hall behind him.
John stepped in front of the toilet, unfastened his jeans, and pulled out his cock, but something made him hesitate.
Watson shivered, not from the memory of the scene, or the night’s cold, but rather from the notion, fantastic though it was, that the blue squares of the quilt were glinting, well, rather <I>vengeful</I> in the dim light of the kitchen.
“Can I take you to bed?”
“Perfect,” he pronounced. Really, the trio had no rival: coffee, cake, and film.
The most difficult part of the whole affair was hiding from Sherlock long enough to assemble the test. The little scamp was like Mycroft’s shadow! But Mycroft persisted and, at times resorting to frank subterfuge, managed to secure the necessary supplies and the time and privacy to put them together in a form which was most satisfactory.
Marie’s hand was the neater one, and she liked embroidering. For Christmas, she’d given Martha a square with a bit of her favourite verse, Keats, of all things, the romantic dear, stitched in lavender thread. Marie had received, in turn, a length of glorious gossamer-wing lace that Martha said had come to her through Mister Holmes, of all people, after his trip to Paris.

“And then…”
Damn!
“I’m not adverse to the idea, Detective Inspector,” said Mycroft. He circled the bed until he stood at the foot of it. He raked his eyes up and down the crumpled bedding while he turned up his collar and buttoned his shirt. “But I am wondering at the source of inspiration.”
“I know,” said Holmes. “But I had a perfect vision in the cab yesterday of what to do about it.”
Then he turned, lowered himself, and looked up.
“Good. May I?”
“You said ‘just as I was,’” retorted Molly. She touched her hair. “Though this wig isn't going to last much longer. Help me.”
“Yeah, whatever. He was found in this egg. The creature’s supposed to hatch out of it or something. That’s why he’s naked with all the makeup and stitches and whatnot. You know what, from a certain angle, he looks a lot like you.”
“No, I’m going to kiss your naughty arse.”

Then he lifted his head and addressed Italian leather.
“Gregory.”
“How? Did Sherlock give it to you?”
Mycroft laughs. This is a first.
Holmes finds Watson at the circus.
Stanley shook his head. “I don’t joke about sub-committee decisions, John.”
Lestrade was perched on a stool, an untouched cup of tea in front of him.
“Oh, God,” breathed John. “Sherlock.”
Lestrade emerged from the bathroom with a towel wrapped round his waist. He was drying his hair with a second towel.
“Oh, God, Sherlock.” John stumbled back toward the bed. “And when you brought me off with just your feet.”
“Happy Halloween.”
Miss Helier’s eyes widened. “Is that a retaining fee?”
Mycroft whimpered, then coughed and managed a hoarse ‘My dear?’
Finally, the kiss broke.
“Mine definitely.”
With a walking stick, not a cane, and Holmes’s arm, I emerged from the cottage. As I immediately settled on the bench beside the back door, the first steps were somewhat anticlimactic.
“I’m going to eat one of the cakes and join you, John.”
“How do you know about Matilda?”
John’s hands went to the buttons of his shirt but even before he parted the fabric, Sherlock noticed the wet spots
“Thank you. That was thoughtful. First time at a centre?”
She appears, holding a tall can.
Sherlock grunted and raised his knees, clasping his thighs tighter around John’s rutting form.
“I should not be able to resist,” you say in that melting tone.
He spares a glance at his handiwork then bows, pressing his lips to the top of each boot.
“’Just don’t.’ In my own home! I’m the smart one! I know science! I know chemistry. ‘Remember what happened to Alice!’ How absurd! It does not look dangerous. Quite the contrary. Careful. Hmm. Doesn’t smell dangerous. In fact, it smells like…delicious, delicious cake.”
Lestrade and Sherlock give up smoking. Pre-canon. Sherstrade. Public sex. Oral sex.
“We’ll be going now.”
“They showed me the photographs. You said they would. I prepared myself. I work in a morgue, for Christ’s sake. But, still…”
Victoria Station. Oh, what joy to drain into this swirling cesspool! The stone that has blocked the entrance of my tomb for three long years has been rolled away! As I reclaim my city, so shall I reclaim my address, in my own clothes, with my own face and name, regardless of the violent hysterics provoked in dear Mrs. Hudson. I shall reclaim my Watson, too, and together we shall, with our Scotland Yard colleagues, vanquish the last of my persecutors.
He handed Lestrade a cup. It was one of those environmentally friendly travel mugs with a clear dome. Whatever the cup held was covered in whipped cream and dark brown sprinkles.
Doctor and nurse, Molly has just finished changing his dressings, reassessing his wounds, and helping him to and in the loo.
“I wished for Holmes to find me. And he did. But I also wished for her, for the girl, to be well and at peace, body and mind.”
“Please.”
“You’ve bought property. A house.”
“It’s a uniform, Sherlock, for work, not a costume for a fancy-dress party.”
“You’ll want to touch it, I presume.”
“Huh! What’s that in my bed? It feels grainy. Like,” John flicked on the lamp, “sand! Glitter sand!”
John’s hips bucked hard once.
“Fuck me all night.”
“…in addition to the honey and flowers and your professional attendance as a supplement to Doctor Shepherd…”
“Will you marry me?”
John’s tongue swirled ‘round Sherlock’s prickhead.
Holmes groaned. “A few stray drops on my back ‘tis all. You owe me no apology, Watson. After a day spent attending patients and battling the elements, I expected you to return as stirred as the equinoctial gales without.”
“They were tears
“There you go, ruining another perfectly good firearm,” said Seb when the whole barrel was sheathed in Jim’s dripping cunt.
John did.
“It will take time to accustom ourselves to it.”
“Whose fault is that?”
At once, the lead was attached to the ring and the strap was being wound ‘round knuckles and Seb’s head was being jerked forward.
“I’m getting close. You’re going to think about this tonight, aren’t you?”
“Holmes, it should be quite obvious to the most observant man in the world that I adore you, too.”
“You’re working late.”
In the centre of the sitting room, surrounded by candles, large and small, was my enchanted scene.
Hopkins strode back and forth before our crouched forms, bringing the birching rod to his palm with a slap.
“Thank you very much. And so you shall. When a doctor goes wrong, he is the first of criminals, but I have a proposal for you to mend your ways.”
Sherlock woke up the next day alone in his own bed.
“—what some consider paragons of the male physical form in near nude states. Yours was, by far, the duller enterprise.”
“I had no idea how right I was!”
“Yes, indeed.”
Sherlock mewled.
“Hey! Wh—?”
I wiggled my toes. “A bit small, I’ve always thought.”
Pairings Watson/Holmes; Jeeves/Bertie; Raffles/Bunny
That was the moment John’s bladder decided to make its needs known again.
I leveled a look at him that stopped his protest.
John smiled. “No. Not until you say what you’ve got me for Christmas.”
“Whew! Want to take a turn?”
“Mm? Too long?”
“Lucky you.”
(even to me)
“Aren’t you aroused?” continued Jim.
“How does love become so warped?” I asked the flames. “Like most things, I suppose. Slowly, then all at once.”
“Uh-huh,” said Molly. She caught Seb’s eye and gave a nod.
Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience.
“Yes. And then we’ll nab them!”
“None of that,” cautioned Holmes like a seasoned nanny when Wolf made for me. He stepped between us and gave Wolf a solid rap with his stick.
“When it’s assembled, would you care to view it? In person, I mean, in my home?”
“You called me ‘Sir Ambsace,’” I sighed and let my eyes fall back upon my puzzle. “I should’ve remembered the word. Unusual, and it marked a night of such misfortune and such luck.”

“Come on, Kate. I want to hear you.”
“All right. But for the record, I don’t fancy going back in the closet.”
“Ah-ha! Then you see them for the amateurs they are!” He laughed, then drew closer. “My dear Watson, what say we hurry back to our cosy rooms and remedy this oversight at once? Chemically-speaking, of course.”
“Nice hindquarters,” said John with a grin.
My rational mind knows it was mere moments, and yet time sufficient to see the many possibilities before me and choose my fate.

Eventually Stella was on top. She straddled Sally and pulled the sides of her short robe apart. The top was hanging off her shoulders, but the gold sash was still tied. She ground into Sally and grunted happily.
Lomax turned towards him.
“Like this one?” John bent again and applied the same treatment to the other nipple until Sherlock began to whimper.
“A very uninhibiting one.”
“Looks like we both passed out,” said John. “Finally.”
Lestrade stepped away from Madeline Trust. “What am I looking at, Holmes?”
“Good.”
A bit of skiing. A cross-country trek or two in snowshoes. Marvelling at the sweet woodland creatures and the way the sun hit the icicles on the branches. Listening to the wind through the firs or the spruces or whatever those damn trees were. That sort of thing.
“They taste so sweet, don’t they?” sang Sherlock. Mycroft nodded.
“Your penchant hasn’t escaped my notice, my dear man. Everywhere we go, you inquire about jams, jellies, curds, and marmalades. You must have quite the collection by now, a veritable connoisseur of confiture. Captain Basil picked this one up for you on his latest excursion. Lingonberry.”
Lestrade turned off the road.
“I shall not,” he replied petulantly and blew out the candle. “How much do you think the author was compensated for writing a lurid story about me?”
Jim sang as Seb unbuttoned the dress and as he himself removed the lace mantilla-style veil.
“—play with them.”
The lid of a large trunk to John’s left swings open, and Sherlock pops out like a jack-in-the-box.
He drank from her as he fondled her, and as her arousal grew, the fluid in his mouth grew sweeter and richer and, impossibly, more delectable.

“I suppose if it hadn’t been rain, it would’ve been ants. Now, where shall we hie to?”
“Every damn day.”
“No. Andrew heard her singing and dancing round the urn in the middle of the night, and when I asked her about her art and how she worked she said, ‘Oh, Doctor, I do the opposite of those clever Indians, the one who make the elephants, they say they look at a pillar of stone and simply chip away all that is not elephant. I, on the other hand, take an elephant or, say, a snake, and keep adding and adding until it’s a pillar of stone!’ I think she had poor Alaric’s urn in mind.”
“But?” I didn’t understand.
“Care to take the waters, Inspector?” asked Raffles.

“Tie says ‘Ice Man’; trousers say ‘Fox hunt by way of Saville Row.’ Means you changed to give me the blow job that I so richly deserve, thank you very much, by the way. Georges took the most direct route. No time for reciprocation. Or a chat. Which means, of course, there’s something to chat about.”
“Let’s give ‘em a show, my dear.”
“Naturally. So we’ve got a bit of time.” Moriarty opened Sherlock’s trousers and slipped a hand inside.
Without a word, Lestrade gripped Lomax and threw him bodily into the corner of the wide stone pillar. He covered Lomax’s body with his own and roughly kissed the lips parted in astonishment.
“True. And curtains. And teapot.”
“A driftwood fire is an excellent companion, but second to you, my dear Watson. You did what no bonfire could do: brought me a puzzle, helped me solve it, and now, are helping me celebrate. A trove above rubies, lost, found, or thrown before swine.”
“No, not yet.”
“Isn’t it?”
“Gregory.”
“Detective Inspector can bend the rules a bit, no? Care to do a perp walk to the bedroom?”
He looked down, and Mycroft watched the penny drop.
“No,” said Sherlock.
“What?”
“Ok, Spock.”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed, then froze at the creak of the front door.
MacCoy didn’t turn his head this time.
“Well done and congratulations, John, you’ve just slayed your first vampire.”

Sherlock got himself in order, too, and dragged John, still muddled and slow from the afterglow, through the cold night to Baker Street.
I turn abruptly. “Holmes!”
It made it much easier for John to imagine he was, in fact, horny enough to stick his cock through a hole in wall for some stranger to suck.
Her knees buckled at the metallic
“John?”
“Goodness, no! I don’t drive at all since the cataract surgery.”
“The cushions, Watson.”
Mycroft sighed and set his pen on the desk.
Sherlock untied the sash and pulled the sides of the dressing gown apart. Then he palmed his half-hard cock. “Ride me?”
Sherlock grabbed Mycroft’s hips for more leverage.
Jim turned the sign on the front door as he sidled to the counter. Then he sank behind the counter and reappeared with a violin case. “Thought you might be interested in this.”
As we exited the shop, Holmes said, “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe an enterprising reporter will choose to cast Mrs. Norton née Adler in the role of heroine, but I agree the melee which ensued was memorable. You also, of course, saved my life, tackling the gunman as you did and subduing him.”
Molly drops the can in her bag. “I think I’m going to need it. Double shifts are looming.”
Platinum curls bounced as Mycroft shook his head. “I’m not your sister.”
“I felt like celebrating. Thank you. Again.”
“I cleaned them out yesterday!”
He handed me an odd pair of spectacles attached to a leather cap. The lenses were tinted green, and there were straps at the back to adjust the fit.
“Whetted my appetite, you mean? For a while. You know how the blackmailing game goes. Who knows when we might run into each other again? Ta, ta for now.”
Sherlock shrugged, then whined. “I’m so bored, John.”
Summary: Watson returns to find Holmes tidying the sitting room.
“The third were something wild. Beautiful. Intriguing. Desired by both. Dangerous. They each confided in me, unaware that the other was doing the same. I hadn’t heard from either of them in several days. I was worried, so I went to see Mister Holmes and he and Doctor Watson agreed to accompany me.” She smiled weakly at us.

Mycroft whimpered. “Naked. In my bed.”
“You helped.”
And then Mycroft’s cock was being praised as strongly as it was being stroked and Mycroft’s handkerchief caught much less of his emission than he would’ve wished.
“Motion to make John the Holmes family heirloom,” says Mycroft, thrusting gently into John’s mouth.
“I should like to return and see it in every season.”
Moriarty had prepared for much, but not for the blow of that simple utterance. He strode to the ropes, adjusting them and speaking with clipped urgency,
“Really?”
John accidentally yanks the chain, but it isn’t an accident. It’s a reminder. That he is hostage and captor; that wherever Sherlock goes, he
Irene closed her eyes and leaned back.
“If it’s fellating you want, Seb, you’ll have to bargain.”
“With you and…?”
Jim nodded.
I bent forward, praying that the legs of the table might bear the strain as well as Holmes had, and whispered in his ear,
“I’m dead, doesn’t that count?”
John had resigned himself to the uneasiness when a chance event (he and Sherlock had been asked to move boxes for Mrs. Hudson in her lumber room) had led to a discussion and a sharing of their own stored troves and, finally, the discovery of one of Sherlock’s childhood toys (a large, plush bumblebee). Sherlock’s cheeks had pinked, and John had been especially gentle with his ribbing.
Your prick is ready, has been ready for quite some time. Stiff and pink, engorged and neglected, the vein running along the side at the edge of bursting. It weeps, too, not as furiously as your eyes, but just as sweetly.
Jigsaw pieces hit the floor.
“You get hard watching me on the pitch?”
“Jigsaw puzzle?”
I searched his expression for subterfuge or hyperbole, but then remembered he’d just set fire to my points of reference.
“I’m fucking you like a good Omega should, aren’t I?”

Lestrade pulled off with a slurp. “Later.” He sat back and wiped his mouth on his sleeve and winked. “After you fuck me. It’s my weekend off, remember?”

And won.
In a few moments, he was on his back, and she was sinking down on his prick and exhaling a long, satisfied moan.
In a fit of feverish self-disgust, Mycroft threw the dildo on the floor.
“Yes, but I’m better.”
“And this?” asked John.
Mysterious ways, indeed, but they must be tackled. A thin blanket is all well and good, but the fastidious gardener won’t stand for a long snake-like heap of those proportions.
“I don’t photosynthesise, if that’s what you’re asking,” replied Mycroft. “But you can be forgiven the misconception given the only thing you’ve ever seen me swallow.”
“Here.”
“Indeed,” said the stranger.
“Yes, an antique, but kept in excellence condition,” agreed Madeline Trust. “However, the family rumour was that the clock was also where Aunt Ada hid instructions and locations of three sites where she had found certain mushrooms. She believed these sites were known only to herself and that the mushrooms themselves were unknown to chefs, painter, and scientists alike. The mushrooms were unparallel in taste, beauty, and scientific import. When Alphonse heard that Angus had inherited the clock, he was furious. He returned to England at once.”
“Oh, God,” moaned Mycroft, speeding up his stroking and stepping over the pair of knickers that John had just ripped from Sherlock to get a better view. He rolled down Sherlock’s bodice and pinched a glittery nipple.
“Yes! Toby’s got a new outfit!”
“Bloody hell! All right, gorgeous. Don’t move. I’m going to need a very different liniment.”
Mycroft blushes.
“In one day, he’s destroyed a quarter of my wardrobe! My valet says it’s the pup or him! I adore the little blighter, but I can’t afford to lose Jeeves.”
“I suppose someone will go looking for him at some point.”
John was winding his way through the growing crowd, scanning the faces while trying not to appear as if he were talking to anyone or to himself. He was stubbornly resisting the urge to touch the device in his ear, the device by which he was hearing a tinny version of Sherlock’s voice lecture him on
And then the body fell from the window, splintering, dissolving into a ribbon of silver fog.

In seconds, Sherlock was naked, on hands and knees on the bed and an anal plug was rolling across on the floor. Head buried the mattress, he reached behind himself and parted his buttocks.
“’Tis the season.”
There were other people dancing on the other platforms, but John only had eyes for Sherlock.
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
Mycroft hummed approvingly as he pushed his trousers off his hips.
“Yes, please haul Mister Holmes and the trunks to the carriage downstairs.”

“Thank you for my Valentine,” said Mycroft, inhaling the ripe scent of John’s pleasure mixed with the fragrance of the bubble bath. She licked her thumb and began teasing John’s nipples through the pink fabric. “Especially these, liked them so much that I rushed back to my girl.”
Sex, Mycroft decided. It was sex.
Mycroft’s hands soon returned to Sherlock’s hair. He held Sherlock’s head by the roots.
John got to his feet and stomped decisively toward the door.
I smirked.
“I’m repeating myself. And you’re not sucking.”
“Where?”
“Feeling better?”
“Bring you off here or make you suffer a bit until we reach yours?”
“Just so.”
And as John’s blood flows into Sherlock’s mouth, Sherlock uses her tongue, her lips and her mouth’s suction as well as her roaming hands, to tease John to climax.
“Plenty of time. Come, Watson.” Holmes marched off, whistling an off-key version of “Ode to Joy.”
“Please, Watson, let me paint those lips with these fingertips, which yearn to be suckled and bit. They want to explore you, map every sweet spot of your shivering, shuddering, slippery sex, and revisit those sites, over and over again.”

It was a 1000-watt smile, the kind that someone might write a song about, and he was standing so close that Mycroft could smell the hint of bitter coffee beneath the strong mint.

“Let’s,” I said.
I’d spent weeks arranging for a fairy fête in the garden, my very own midsummer night’s dream, to be celebrated this very evening, the most auspicious of dates. I’d assembled a miniature banquet table with canopy and chandelier. I’d even carved a host of tiny candles to light the affair.
Watson’s eyebrows rose; then, he, too, smiled, and as he got to his feet, he said,
“They match the dress.”

But as soon as he was spent, Sherlock pushed him and Mycroft off and fell to the rug offering John his arse.

“That was quite a rage, though. You chopped their heads clean off.”

When Sherlock pulled back, her eyelids drooped. “The way you fuck yourself on me. Your wetness. Your scent. The way your body moves.” She smiled and asked, “Do you mind?” Her hand dropped between her legs.
“Go fetch your pumpkin, Watson. The game’s ah, well…”

Did this person really not know who John was?
He nodded, then looked down and frowned. “No boobies yet, though.”
I took up my drink. “Or how close you and I came to losing our lives. Cheers, by the way. To second chances.”
Three scenes about Holmes and sewing.
“Sherlock,” John looked down at his own hands, “I haven’t anything for you for Christmas...”
As foreseen, he readily agreed to the request. That is Watson’s beauty: unshakable loyalty.
“Thank you, Sherlock.”
I leaned in closer for a better look. The depth of the box was an illusion.
“But not for the reasons you think, Doctor. Not that it would’ve mattered. I was there. My reputation would have been ruined by the scandal, and I would’ve lost my livelihood if Lestrade hadn’t thought very quickly, indeed. What library is going to employ someone who has been netted in a police raid, especially one of that sort?”
ACD - Sussex/Retirement
“More sensational, perhaps. Though I can’t see how the story of a man failing to restrain his basest instinct and lashing out at those who love him is anything but tedious. Of course, the
Sherlock nodded. His eyes fell to the bulge in Mycroft’s trousers. “I’d like that more.”

I still spent most of my waking hours reading, novels, newspapers, even, with Mister Holmes’s permission, maps I found in his eccentric and ever-expanding library, but now I elected to do most of my reading in an armchair before the sitting room hearth rather than in the quarantined privacy of my bedroom.
A few minutes later, she was snuggled against him.
The military taught him efficiency and precision as well as how to take care of himself and any number of weapons, but they never succeeded in altering his innate preference for disarray and everything casual. So, it’s very rare that Seb makes an effort with anything beyond work and the things that work requires: a strong, flexible body and weapons and knowledge on which he can depend.
The lolly stick rolled from one side of the mouth to the other. Mycroft reached over again and pulled it out, cracked the window, and threw it out into the storm.
“That massive intellect—“
Lestrade shot him a look, then shrugged. “Sure.” He picked up the glass closest to Mycroft, sipped, and scowled.
“Flask. Long Island Iced Tea.”
The final surprise for Mrs. Hudson was that they ate at the kitchen table and only when all the cleaning had been done—and most of it not by her!
Mycroft raised an eyebrow.
God, if they were going to sod him and toss him off…
is vodka, orange liquer and pomegranate juice.
Sherlock raised the flask in offering. “Long Island Iced Tea, Molly?”
“Now,” breathed Mycroft, diving onto the bed. Part of the petticoat sprang awkwardly up in the air and part bunched awkwardly around him. “This princess wants to be mounted and fucked.”
“This cocktail makes me think of Mrs. Hudson.”
“You didn’t charge Lancelot for keeping that book past the date of return.”

“Have a nice holiday?” asked Mrs. Hudson.
Was the Detective Inspector asking him up for tea? It was five o’clock in the afternoon, a perfectly suitable hour for tea.
“I know a good Chinese restaurant that stays open until two. Shall we exit the closet?”

“Mm. Oh, yeah?”
Title: Whit Monday
“More likely he’ll swing,” said Lestrade, and Holmes and I took the words for the dismissal they were.
While his host's face was half-hidden in the mug, Mycroft quickly countered.
Lestrade pulled off. “You can call me ‘Greg’ when I’m sucking your cock, love.”
Lestrade sniffed. “Hello! Smells fabulous.”
John gazed out the open window. “Pure as the driven snow,” he muttered to himself for no reason at all.
“You like nice round numbers,” remarked Sherlock.
The first thing John recognized was Sherlock saying,
Dressed as fairies for a case, Lestrade, Sherlock, and John drink something called Love-in-Idleness and sneak off to the forest. Lestrade/Sherlock/John. Dub-con for magical-potion-made-them-do-it. Oral sex.
“Yeah, yeah. Do you want to come?”
“The corset’s not the surprise.”
“More wonderful because we didn’t prepare it ourselves.”
He’d made it three steps back to the campervan when he heard the low, rumbling, dryly sarcastic, slightly aroused baritone he’d been expecting to hear.
“Excellent. Boss asked me to convey his apologies. He’ll be late. And sorry for the change of address. This is definitely coming down in the world.”
And I was left with a singular reminder, not of the ephemeral nature of life, nor of the heady elixir that is newly-confessed love, but of the fact that the most observant person at 221 Baker Street was not its tenant, the world famous detective, but rather its noble proprietress.
“You were fantastic, Holmes!” I exclaimed as we settled in the hansom cab. “How you concluded it was a tailor’s shop which was wanted and not a seamstress shop or any other similar establishment from nothing but a thread, a needle, and a smear of chalk, was nothing short of brilliant!”
The animal rooting around in Mycroft's herb garden decides to root around somewhere else. Mycroft/fox. Bestiality. This one is more open to reader interpretation. Is it a shape-shifter? Is it a possess animal? A dream? Something else entirely. Your call.
Three voices yelled.
A few years younger than myself, he was frail, but with a resolute expression. Only a few sparse hairs graced his round head, but upon his upper lip was the thickest, fullest, most magnificent moustache I’d ever seen.
John’s hand joined Sherlock’s.
In the next moment, the world and everything in it, the alley, the street, the city, Sherlock and John, was dark again.
We lay curled together on the sofa, Holmes in my arms, and we stared at the fire in silence, the Moroccan case resting on the table, closed, once and for all.
“Four to six hours.”

“If I sank right here, between your knees,” Lestrade cupped the front of Mycroft’s trousers, “and sucked you, slow and easy, do you think you could lie back, close your eyes, and just enjoy it?”
One side of John’s mouth rose in a wicked smirk. He retrieved something from his toilet kit.
“Fuck, Sherlock. That mouth!”
“Really?”

The little one was playing with his balls, God, he loved that, while the bigger one would have nothing but his prick, which had stiffened and began to leak its own ooze.
Surprised un-surprise. Un-surprised surprise.
Lestrade looked around them. “Luring your boyfriend,” they both winced, “to a slice of paradise just so he can cool off is pretty sweet.” He kissed Mycroft, bracing himself so only their lips touched. Then he pulled back. “Boyfriend is too juvenile, lover's too specific, friend is…”
Title: Opening a door
“No, but I am the world’s only consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, and I am trying to catch a clever serial killer who has taken the lives of four hypnotists in the past month.”
Sherlock nodded. He made a strolling circle around the interior of the tiny shop. He checked his mobile.
“Just joined. First time. You?”
“This is some collar on this dog, Raffles!” I hissed.
Sally glanced at her watch. “There’s a half hour left of Halloween. Your place or mine?”
They kissed and entangled their damp naked bodies in ways that were becoming easy and natural to them. Eventually, the flask of oil was plucked from the satchel that had served as picnic hamper. Holmes rolled onto his belly, and Trevor rolled atop him. Trevor kept his body as close to Holmes’ as the act allowed.
