While he and Steve were starting to argue about whatever the hell was going on, of course Clint showed up out of nowhere and started petting the cat and fussing over it. The cat was leaning into the archer’s hand and looking absolutely
“No.” He pondered for a moment. “Besides, he’s slacking on the job. Dum-E, look at that mess over there. I thought I programmed you to help me around here, not try to launch a new career as a model.”
They slipped into casual, quiet conversation after that, and the couch was beginning to real absolutely way too comfortable. The exhaustion of the day was hitting him, but Tony willed his eyes to stay open and was doing an excellent job of it.
On another day when Steve went down to Tony’s workshop to retrieve the man from one of his insomnia fueled workshop benders, Steve knew he wasn’t imagining the nearly half a dozen cat care blogs Tony had open on a few of the monitors before he quickly closed them when he noticed Steve’s presence.
“Yesterday,” Tony decided to bring up, carefully watching Steve’s expression for signs of discomfort. “You mentioned ‘we tried before,’ but who’s ‘we’ and what did you all try?”
Tony continued to look through Steve’s sketchpad while he was making coffee, and now that he didn’t feel as if he was sneaking around, he could take the time to fully appreciate the details. Somehow, Steve had managed to capture the soft glow of the arc reactor in his chest, and Tony’s heart swelled with fondness.
“Thank you... for this.” Steve vaguely gestured, probably trying to convey that he meant more than just looking through his old artwork. “Even after I’ve been a complete ass, you’ve kept reaching out to me.”
After half-heartedly making himself something for dinner, Tony retreated back to the guest room he was staying in and decided he should probably check in with Pepper and let her know he was still alive.
“Alright, then.” He sighed and scooped the extremely asleep cat to carry him out of the workshop. “You’re lucky you’re so damn cute.”
And that was when another man walked soundlessly into the kitchen, scaring the shit out of Tony, which resulted in him choking a bit on his food. “Jesus, shit! I have a potential head injury, don’t startle me like that.” He noticed Coulson politely hiding a laugh with his hand.
Steve looked around at his team scattered around the kitchen and wondered how in the world he had missed it. He quietly watched as Tony and Bruce began interrogating Thor about the breadth of his understanding of other beings and languages. Natasha and Clint were doing their weird, silent twin assassin bickering thing while Bucky had scooted over to pay more attention to Orion.
“Doesn’t seem too far from it.” Tony returned the smile, letting himself lean closer to Steve.  “We were married in one of those, weren’t we?” He paused, hoping he hadn’t just put his whole foot in his mouth. “I know they’re not
“You know, he likes to ride around on Dum-E’s base like he’s some sort of Roomba,” Tony laughed, eyes full of warmth when he looked over at his bot playing with the cat. (After that Steve had googled ‘cats and roomba’ and had not been disappointed by the results.)
Tony couldn’t stand the silence any longer, so he poked at Steve again. “Hey, you gonna let me see what you’ve got there?”
And that just… really fucking sucked. Tony wished they could have met under different circumstances somehow. Maybe then they would have had a chance to be together.
Tony rolled his eyes at the AI’s response and stared at the cat who was pawing gently at the door now that he had Tony’s attention.
It seemed like they had pretty much run out of things to investigate, though Tony figured later he might look over the newspapers again, just in case he had missed anything. There was only a handful of days remaining until Christmas Eve, and it felt like they were quickly running out of time to break the curse on Steve.
Around lunchtime, Tony tried to get into the kitchen, but Steve met him in the doorway, handed him a sandwich, and then turned him away. Not one to look a gift sandwich in the mouth (or crust, or… whatever), Tony ignored his curiosity to respect whatever Steve’s surprise was. The kitchen was clearly off-limits until further notice, as was the dining room that they never actually ate in.
Tony couldn’t stop watching Steve as they finished decorating the tree, occasionally catching Steve watching him, too, and he had a distinct feeling that this could end poorly… for both of them.
The ghost shrugged. “This isn’t something I decide myself. I don’t… I’m not even sure where I am when I’m not here. I just wake up here, and it’s December thirteenth all over again.”
Bucky gave the archer a wary look but complied with his request anyway. Clint grabbed him by the shoulder and told him to stand still, then he started maneuvering him into a pose where he was holding Orion close to his chest in a defensive stance.
“You deserved to know what you were getting into, but I was afraid to tell you the truth.” The look of resignation on his face was ill-fitting of a man like Steve, and Tony didn’t like it. “What happened yesterday is on me.”
“Who the hell is that?” Tony demanded, totally unsure of where the hell this cat had come from. How did it get inside the Tower? Was there a security breach of some sort?
Steve’s attention immediately shifted to Tony, and he felt heat start to crawl up the back of his neck when those beautiful blue eyes considered him. This crush was getting way out of hand.
The man nodded, though he seemed bashful about taking credit. Judging by the set-up, Tony supposed he hadn’t been imagining the whole flirting thing.
Steve started slamming the shield against the armor’s helmet, cracking it open and ripping it off. He raised the shield again, obviously winding up for the final blow. Tony raised his hands in self-defense, the unfamiliar red of his gauntlets a stark contrast to Steve’s blue uniform.
“...who tragically fell through the ice after rescuing the children. Judging by the descriptions given by the children of the man who pulled them from the water, authorities believe the mysterious hero to be a Steven G. Rogers, who was reported missing three days later by his family. A body was never found to confirm the hero’s identity.”
“You don’t have to ask me; it’s my decision to make,” Tony started to argue with him, tears threatening to spill over. “Don’t start making decisions for m—“
Slowly, Tony took Steve’s chin in his hand and wiped some of the icing off, dragging his thumb across the man’s plush bottom lip (to obviously get as much of the icing off as possible,
“What…? Steve, I—” The emotions he had managed to keep at bay break loose at that. “I love you so much, I shouldn’t have given up so easily. But you— you’d been my rock for so long that I was lost without you.”
“Mm, Pepper woke me up for some business stuff.” Tony vaguely waved his hand through the air as he invited himself into the room.
Tony proceeded into the house, cautiously checking his surroundings as he walked down the entry hallway. “Is anyone home?” he called out, honestly not knowing what kind of response he would get. There wasn’t an answer.
Apparently Tony hesitated for a beat too long before answering because Rhodey continued. “Tony, I know how you get. You see a sad puppy and you want to fix all its sad puppy problems without any regard for yourself. But what’s gonna happen when this puppy isn’t sad anymore and finally crosses over into the big dog park in the sky?”
Later that night, Steve found himself spending time with Tony in his workshop yet again. He was watching Dum-E wheel around the room, “cleaning” while Orion was riding on the bot’s base.
The man didn’t let any details about his plans for dinner slip while they were eating breakfast, despite Tony’s many attempts at prying for information. Afterwards, he shooed Tony out of the kitchen, leaving him to his own devices while Steve worked on... whatever he was plotting.
He hesitated to answer her, listening for more noises from downstairs. Which apparently worried her more.
And then Steve directed his attention to the living room couch, where there was a fluffy orange cat draped across the arm of the couch, looking incredibly comfortable and very much like it lived there.
He was in the kitchen on the communal floor when Steve came in, his cheeks were slightly red, so Tony figured he must have just taken his motorcycle out for a spin despite the fact that it was absolutely frigid outside.
He just about had something figured out when he felt an uneasy sensation creep across his shoulders, as if he was being watched. Which was a ridiculous notion because only Steve ever bothered him while he was working, and the Tower was probably the safest building in the city if you didn’t count the feline infiltration.
Tony had to replay that last part a few times. “You’re about to disappear back into some frozen hell purgatory thing, and instead of trying to stop it, you just want to spend time with…
“Listen, Steve, I may not have known the guy, but if he was worthy enough for you to consider him your best friend, there’s no way he would hold you accountable for his death. Bucky wouldn’t want you to punish yourself like this,” he said with finality.
Steve narrowed his eyes at the cat innocently eating what was probably his second or third meal of the day. “Because his Auntie Nat taught him how to lie.”
“Pep,” his voice was breaking and betraying his emotions to her. “Call the sale off. I’m not going through with it.”
“Don’t mention it.” Tony brushed it off, even as he could feel his heart lodging itself in his throat.
“Why are you here anyway? Thought you said you were gonna be avoiding this place like the plague,” Tony asked after draining half of his cup. Oh, sweet caffeine.
So he decided to take a chance, “Maybe we can get it right, too.” The smile he earned from Steve left him awestruck and blinded as if he were staring directly into the sun. Suddenly, the room seemed a lot warmer than it had been before. And Steve was so much closer than he had been before…
Tossing back the sheets, he slid out of bed to wander through the house searching for Steve, just in case he was secretly waiting somewhere to jump out and yell surprise like some sort of extremely attractive and sweet jumpscare. The first place he headed to was Steve’s bedroom. When Tony quietly opened the door, he was greeted by the sight of Steve’s belongings neatly packed and setting on the bed, waiting to be put back into storage. Of course Steve was the type to be overly considerate of others when he was the one who was cursed. He fought back the urge the reach out and touch the boxes, knowing they were the only signs of Steve that were left.
Before he could bask in whatever it was that had developed, curiosity overtook all other thoughts going through Tony’s mind, and he carefully reached for the sketchpad, trying to not wake Steve in the process. He quietly and delicately flipped through the pages, the first few were sketches of Dum-E and the other bots, and different pieces of equipment around the workshop… then it was just… pages and pages of Tony working, hair mused and face streaked with grease. Tony pouring over blueprints. Tony laughing. He wasn’t aware he could still smile like that after he and Pepper had broken up.
“Your little trick at the property line made a convincing argument, but my hypothesis needs a bit more testing.” Tony started looking around at the other things scattered across the kitchen table before settling on his cellphone. Well, it was worth a shot.
He noticed that Steve seemed a little hesitant, he hadn’t made any sort of movement like he was going to reach out for the sketchbook. “Have you tried touching them recently?”
Of course that came across as a challenge to Tony, and he immediately decided he was going to blow his mind with this pose. Actually, no. No blowing. That would be a very unfortunate train of thought in his current state of undress.
Tony went to his room to freshen up, and he actually changed into some nicer clothes because why the hell not? He was pretty sure Steve had been flirting with him the past few days, and after the whole… Icing Incident, what was the harm in digging his own grave a little deeper?
“From what I’ve seen… I think they’re the ones who got it right.” There was color creeping up Steve’s neck and his cheeks, and Tony was mesmerized by it.
Tony slowly made his way down the hallway as silently as he could manage. He passed by a collection of what appeared to be old, faded family photos, probably of whoever owned this place before his father bought it. He was momentarily distracted by the photographs when he noticed one in particular of a tall, blond man with broad shoulders that had clearly been taken outside the house. Next to it, there was a portrait of a much thinner young boy, though he had similar facial features to the taller man.
“That would make you my Watson, would it not?” Tony couldn’t help but wink at the man. “You do have a grand gift for silence, Rogers.”
“Yeah, that’s… that’s me.” Steve confirmed, running his hand through his hair like it might be some sort of nervous habit. “Hit a bit of a growth spurt.”
Eventually, they decided to call it quits for the evening, as apparently even ghosts have a regular appetite. Dinner started off as a quiet affair, each of them cooked their own food and didn’t really talk much as they sat across from one another at the table in the kitchen.
Steve’s movements seemed a bit subdued, and he didn’t acknowledge Tony’s presence aside from the nod he gave when Tony walked into the room. He didn’t appear to be upset about yesterday’s developments, just maybe a bit… pensive.
The little guy was given a clean bill of health, but the vet wasn’t able to find a microchip. Steve thought he caught the vet offhandedly insinuating the cat was probably dumped by someone who didn’t want him anymore or couldn’t take care of him. Apparently that was a frequent occurrence after Christmastime. He definitely caught Clint visibly stiffen in his peripheral at that.
“Look! It’s you!” He exclaimed excitedly presenting Tony with the gingerbread man he’d just finished icing. The little cookie had his trademark goatee and Tony tried to not get choked up at the sight of Steve adorably beaming about his cookie mini-me.
“Tony,” Pepper started. “I know you say you want to help him break whatever this— this curse is, but… are
Tony gently poked at Orion’s soft tummy as he sat down on the couch right next to Steve. “Hey, sharing is caring. He’s my furnace, too.”
There were less than forty-eight hours remaining until the curse would whisk Steve away until next year, and quite frankly, it was stressing Tony the fuck out. He’d found the man drawing in the study, nestled in an armchair near the window with his sketchbook propped on his knee.
When Tony saw Steve again that night, he very pointedly did not bring up what had happened at the gate earlier. Whatever it was that he was feeling right then, he’d bottled it up and wasn’t sharing a drop of it with Tony.
There was another harsh jolt, and an indistinct voice shouting about alignment again, but Tony wasn’t given a chance to focus on it as overwhelming anguish and betrayal threatened to drown out the rest of his senses. As he was trying to orient himself, suddenly he was grabbed from behind and lifted off his feet. Tony tried to gain control and break away using his boot thrusters (he definitely didn’t recall the drivesuits having
“Then find some lonely grandmother to adopt it. I don’t care, just get it out of my tower.” He was getting fidgety as their conversation turned more into an argument. “We’ve taken in enough strays as it is.”
Surprisingly, Steve opened up a bit and began to tell Tony about his childhood with Bucky, about growing up in Brooklyn and constantly getting into trouble and fights. It was hard for Tony to imagine the absolute truck of a man in front of him ever needing saving in a fight, but Steve claimed he used to be small and sickly as a kid.
Rogers didn’t dignify Tony’s comment with a verbal response, but he could see the man’s jaw get visibly tighter as Tony continued talking. Geez, how much stiffer could a dead guy get?
Steve let out a laugh at Tony’s silliness, his eyes twinkling with amusement. “That’s not even what I said.”
“Not a fucking word of this to anyone,” he (somewhat lamely) threatened Bruce as he stepped into the elevator and reached out to pet the cat, who magically woke up immediately upon contact. He totally had been feigning sleep for Tony. Devious, little bastard.
this.” Suddenly Tony latched onto Steve’s wrist, like it’d help him stabilize his thoughts. He was really slow on the uptake this morning.
The blush was only growing deeper, and Steve waved off Tony’s comment, clearly not great at handling the attention on himself.
Sometimes it’d just be him and Tony, and he’d still find himself sketching the genius hard at work, grease and oil smears on his face, hair sticking up where he’d ran his hands through it.
“He always looked out for me, and when it came down to it, I couldn’t do the same for him. I wasn’t there when he needed me.” There was so much pain and grief laced through Steve’s words.
“Are you sure you’re okay? Phil said you hit your head hard enough to black out. Do I need to send Rhodey your way? I think he’s in town for the holidays.”

as an anomaly rather than a true feeling, since bondmates are notoriously codependent as they adjust to their connection.
Stark is not a fan of the organic mechanism, finding it delicate, convoluted, and poorly designed. Let Brucie-poo and Dr. Choi rhapsodize over nucleotides, amino acids, and the subtle adjustments of cell evolution to cosmic radiation. DNA may be the most sophisticated recording mechanism in the universe, but whoever did the debugging and load testing didn't know shit. All that complexity and you still end up with cancer-- with disease, defect, and death. In the face of the transitory, of humanity's inescapable epitaph of 'nothing lasts', is it any wonder Tony sought improvement? A shield
"They're carrion-feeders," Tony tells him, somber but also dismissive as he catches the last image associated with his mate's discomfort. Steve's only salvation likely lies in the fact concrete thoughts are far more difficult to pick up, even amongst veterans of

soothing-- causing a now-familiar lassitude to settle over Steve like a mist. While the brunt of bonding heat seems to have passed, it's unlikely to be over just yet. Desire burns like coal fires beneath a barren moon, waiting, mindlessly seeking exit. He could let it rise now to swallow everything, drag Tony down beside him, his own skinny arms like a garland about his alpha's corded neck.
'I would have thought all that outrageous tech might give you the willies,' Jan had remarked one day, the short of breezy stealth-interrogation she often carried out in the communal kitchen. Steve had blushed pointlessly, the newness of the situation still leaving him stunned by the number of deadly, capable, and unmistakably beautiful women who strode purposefully in and out of the Tower. Ladies, though Bucky might have called them 'dames' just to see what would happen-- and boy, would he have been in for a surprise!

Despite the fear of heat-resurgence and all its attendant dangers, Steve cannot fight the instinct to bend and kiss the remnants of violence written on Stark's skin. He does so with more reverence than he'd imagined himself capable of outside of Church, very aware of Tony's nipple hardening in proximity. When he raises his head, the alpha's fingers take hold of his chin-- not roughly, but with intent.
The black spots in his vision scatter and fade, and the first few unencumbered lungfuls of air taste almost unbearably sweet. Then there's the lack of pain as tension drains from his body, the absence of hurt becoming its own separate sensation. One he cannot help but savor, despite his body's most recent betrayal. When awareness expands at last beyond the battlefield of his own physiology, it includes the weight of his alpha kneeling beside him. Those strong, oddly elegant hands are raised in a parody of surrender, as though Tony wishes to take Steve by the shoulders but cannot quite bring himself to risk a single touch.
'You read too much, punk,' that old echo of Bucky comments. 'All that history'll get tangled up like yarn around your brain. How many bombed-out cathedrals, how many little stone churches did we see, surrounded by ash? They showed you too, on film and all-- that terrible cloud. Looked like a mushroom waiting to be picked by the Hand of G-d. Can't you hear the train along the trestle? Ain't nothing that lasts.'
He recalls thinking mournfully that he'd just ruined this gig for both himself and Bucky-- their longest continuous stretch of employment, thanks to Steve's health.
some meticulous voice notes within. Aloud, Steve says, "Three days. Maybe we are finished, after all."
never questioned it, save sometimes in the dark when he felt simultaneously lost in his body and spiritually claustrophobic, or in the depths of fevers that always seemed a little more than whatever common cold was making the rounds.
Steve feels like a traitor now. The creature reflected in the numerous, narrow mirrors inlaid about the room is no different from the person he was four days ago, save for the regalia of robe and visible love-bites. Yet the reflection now looks and feels quite alien, as when one stares at a particular word or phrase for so long it ceases to make sense. It's wrong, it's all wrong somehow, and he feels his chest constrict as anxiety crests over him, no longed levied back by the bond and its attendant biochemicals.
"None," Steve agrees, and allows the other man to put an arm around his shoulders. Not an attempt to provide comfort but rather to
"Steve, I can feel-- are you alright!?" There's an edge of panic in Tony's voice, though its impossible to tell if Rogers himself is bleeding over via the bond or if it is merely an instinctual alpha response to their mate's distress. Regardless, the protectiveness radiating from Stark's end of the connection is powerful and enveloping-- almost but not quite stifling, as an untried swimmer might find the deliquescence of the sea.
Tony now knows more about art theory than he ever wanted to, having listened to any number of discussions between Steve, Natasha, Pepper and (the traitor) sometimes even Bruce.

I highly recommend
"Yeah, but you make everything look easy, sweetheart," Rogers says-- quietly, but very much aloud. His lips quirk slightly, though so painfully, as he speaks the endearment. It never failed to make his lover shiver faintly, delight repressed under a theatrical glower. Who else but Tony Stark could bristle and preen all at once?
Steve isn't terribly surprised to find that the bathroom is just as ridiculous as the bedchamber, though thankfully free of living ornament. Almost the size of the suite proper, its gently curving walls are lined with columns of nephrite-veined marble, all gathered in attendance around a central sunken bath. The floor, where visible, is done in tile of greenish quartz. Any pattern it might have is lost under the preponderance of thick white rugs, which Steve can only view with horror, knowing the effort it must take to keep them so clean. The ceiling opens to a stained glass cupola, casting everything in translucent shadows of topaz, lime, and viridian. Even the tub is lined with soft faux fur, the waterproof kind that costs a small fortune and must be replaced regularly. The faucet handles are gold, in the shape of leaping dolphins-- a detail so outrageous Steve actually clamps a hand over his mouth to trap the belly-deep chuckles of hysteria suddenly bubbling within.
to it; pressing, crushing as the vacuum of space beyond the armor, needing only a pinhole to rush in and destroy the unnatural pocket of air. There's no temperature that Tony can discern, at once cold as that infinite blackness and hot as the desert in her most hostile peak of day. At times it feels merely lukewarm, the temperature of cadaver-flesh and of the same texture-- organic matter abandoned and already starting to decompose.
"Alright, alright," Stark says aloud. If the message was his, he is likely unaware of it. "You don't like that, and I guess I can understand." Rather than acting spurned or moving away entirely, Tony merely scoots back a bit on the tile, ensuring the soft rug is entirely beneath Steve before laying his head in the startled omega's lap. "Just… I can't…"
. Just a bunch of fuckery, more mind games-- thanks a lot, Wanda. Being called into account was just the same as the illusion, and Tony is familiar enough with that.

' Steve thinks. He's seen passion and tenderness from this man, but also abstraction and an odd mercurial flickering of attention. His own perceptions are unreliable too, their three-days acquaintance mired in lust and blurred recollections. No matter how intimately connected he and his mate may be, he is at present armed only with a guttering match. How can you know someone utterly right away, even a soul mate? If someone returned to you a missing limb, wouldn't it still feel strange after its prolonged absence?
, just responsible asset control. Everything else, every ephemeral 'impression', is just a distraction. Rattling his wrists in their bindings as much as he can, Tony smiles as though he knows something. He doesn't, but 'they' don't know what, and mind games are like sex-- it's just not as much fun with only one participant.

[+] 1.5 billion people is (very) roughly equivalent to the population of Earth in the mid to late 1800's. Given the limited number of viable survivors, the rigors of space travel and establishing a colony, I figure it would take considerable time for a 'futuristic' reboot of civilization to reach today's numbers.
in some undefinable way, a relic of the Eighties his inventor chose to keep despite all the other memories willfully boxed up, dumped, or left behind. A CPU with an arm, camera, pincers, and wheels; but it-- 'he', Steve has always thought, much in the same way one considers an endearingly foolish yet somehow clever dog-- hasn't given up. The evidence appears again and again, despite the fact Rogers hash't actually seen him move since before the funeral. 'Round and 'round the increasingly dark tracks go
Steve himself carried no such weapon-- he never has, for betas have no need of them. Nor had he ever entertained any murderous impulse towards his attacker. First, he'd wanted only to dodge the confrontation, saving his-- and Bucky's-- job. Then, as the truth began to filter into his conscious mind, his goal had turned to disarming the other man, keeping himself from injury, and figuring out just what the hell was going on. Alphas were said to see even chase as a challenge, but Stark had only brought his own two hands up slowly, giving plenty of time for refusal before gently cupping one of Steve's fists. The kisses Tony laid on those boney knuckles held no force, no demand. They were a petition, a show of restless yet coiled patience, as the precarious stones of a mountain must anticipate the avalanche. Inevitable, unstoppable. Tony's eyes said, 'It is only a matter of time, but I will wait with you.' Steve still doesn't really know how to interpret this supposed aberration, seduction and plea where only force or violence had been expected.
A self-deprecating grimace twisted Steve’s handsome features. “I’ve been told they’re hallucinations. Likely brought on by the trauma of… piloting alone after Bucky was unconscious.”
Finally his mind booted up and caught up with the conversation. And then promptly screeched to a stop.
“I hardly think they’ll deploy us after yesterday,” Steve countered as he opened the door, the blaring of the siren became impossibly louder as the noise from the hallway flooded into the room.
On the last used page is a finished drawing; it was Tony, sound asleep on the couch, looking more peaceful than he had felt in years. The fondness was clear in the soft lines on the paper, and Tony’s heart felt like it was catching in his throat.
Tony began to summarize the main points of the article out loud. “A few days before this was printed there was an accident with two children on the lake out front, it sounds like they had fallen through the ice while playing on it. Thankfully, they were saved by an unidentified man…” His voice trailed off as he read the rest of the passage, and he cleared his throat before resuming.
Steve’s eyes were a bit watery when he answered, and Tony was sure he was heading in a similar direction. “I think you broke the curse.”
Unable to just lay there and be a quiet model for Steve, Tony was compelled to keep the conversation going to fill the silence.
“Don’t mind if I do.” Tony took a seat in an armchair that was near a small table in the corner of the room.
The smile disappeared from Steve’s face as he slowly looked down at Tony’s hand on his wrist. Oops. Maybe he wasn’t much of a touchy-feely kind of person, and admittedly sometimes Tony was a bit too touchy. Tony was about to apologize when it registered in his caffeine-deprived brain that he was holding Steve’s wrist.
“Mm, nope. I definitely do not have a cat.” Tony gave him a puzzled look, as he leaned against the counter to watch Steve. “What makes you think I have a cat?”
Whenever Sam would drop by the Tower when he was in from DC, Orion would follow him around and sat next to him wherever he landed. Steve would admit it was pretty stinkin’ adorable to watch their cat act like a little host whenever their friends visited.
Tony dragged his hands down his face and huffed a sigh. “Okay, so, long story short. My uncle-figure was dealing under the table to terrorists, and he tried to have me killed when I found out. Thankfully, it didn’t stick.” Surprised blue eyes were staring back at him as Steve listened intently.
“Oh, here we go again. I should’ve known what to expect from his Robin.” Barnes scrunched up his face at the comment, but Tony ignored him. “Lemme guess, I should go talk to him?”
“Steve?” There wasn’t an answer that time, so Tony quickly knelt by Steve’s side, concern flooding his thoughts.
Suddenly, the creature let out a bellowing roar, and Tony felt another jolt shake their connection. The images became foggy, like his copilot might be trying to rein them in. Tony’s own mind was reeling from seeing himself in what was supposed to be Steve’s memories, but Tony had never built a suit like that before. It’d be too small to fight Kaiju in unless you wanted to get smacked out of the sky like a bothersome gnat.
When they were disconnected from the system, Tony took a shaky breath and sank to his knees on the metal floor of the conn-pod, unable to remain standing from the weight of everything he just saw crashing down on him. He chanced a look up at his copilot to his side, but Steve averted his eyes and rushed out of the conn-pod the moment the door opened.
“You’re a regular Sherlock Holmes, aren’t you?” Steve commented with a warm laugh that had Tony beaming in response.
Feeling like he finally got his feet back under him, Tony allowed himself a brief moment to consider one of his own memories that had stuck in his mind a bit more than the others that had flurried by. He’d pushed it deeper and deeper down in recent years. The last time he had seen his parents before they were killed in a Kaiju attack that had made landfall. There was a swell of emotions in Tony’s chest as he saw his mother’s kind face in the crimson hues of his memories.
He stared at the ghost for a moment, taking in his features, those gorgeous blue eyes seemed locked on something in the distance, or rather, something that wasn’t there at all. Afraid to lose the man to it, Tony hopped up out of his chair and clapped his hands a bit too loudly.
He entered his code to get inside the workshop, and inside he found… Tony chatting away with Orion just like he did with his bots as the cat was stretched out across his table, watching as he worked on something small.
“How do you not get noticed being all… orange and everything? Still don’t know how you got past Cap that first day.”
Quietly, he poked around the house until he found a cleaning rag and some furniture polish in the hall closet, then he headed up to the attic. Everything was the same as they’d left it when Steve had stormed out the day before.
“People who care that much are rare.” His face softened, and Tony didn’t feel like he had really done anything that made him worthy of receiving that look from Steve. “Sometimes ‘a lot’ is a good thing.”
And the universe seemed that it wanted to keep reminding Tony of that. Instead of his feelings slowly dimming over time as Steve had been living in the Tower, it was just getting worse and harder to ignore. Wasn’t that the opposite of how exposure therapy worked?
He knew he was rambling at that point, but maybe this was it. Maybe this was why Steve was stuck in this weird limbo.
By the time he was finished, Steve’s cheeks were a lovely shade of red, and it had crept up to the tips of his ears. Yeah, looks didn’t matter to Tony anymore, but god… Steve was cute. What the hell did he mean by ‘a guy like you’ anyway? Did he… find Tony attractive? Oh shit.
“He really is going to turn into Garfield,” Tony sighed and rolled his eyes. “JARVIS, start a feeding chart so this glutton doesn’t swindle every person in the tower with that face.”
His copilot was watching him with hints of awe and fondness in his eyes as Tony continued to pace the room, but Tony froze as something else dawned on him, too.
“Is knocking not a thing anymore?” Steve joked as he looked over his shoulder (oh god, his glorious, completely bare shoulder), and Tony thought he caught Steve smirking at him. To be fair, Tony was stopped dead in his tracks, probably with his mouth hanging open. He should close that, maybe. Or try to say something at least.
When the azure images came into focus, Tony immediately spotted Steve’s doppelganger again. His hair was a bit different, but he was still all wrapped up in the American flag. Tony made a mental note to ask Steve about that later, along with the millions of other questions rapidly springing to mind.
, if you please) how wrong everything has begun to feel. A foolish endeavor, undertaken only in his sleep-deprived excitement at finally being able to articulate the problem in his own mind. Of all the outlandish things he's encountered since waking in that submarine-- the awful, the astonishing, and the absurd-- the Chitauri…
Of course, there are also new terrors that stalk abroad in this 'world of tomorrow', a place not shining and prepackaged or possessed of 'ooh'ing crowds and orderly lines, as the pretender showpiece he and Bucky attended had been. The ills of this fresh century are not precisely original, but they are still the likes of which Sarah Roger's little boy could never have dreamed. It's like the good ol' rag-bag; buttons and pockets, swatches cut out of shirts otherwise stained and ruined. Everything from humanity thrown in and rummaged, for evil is nothing new under the sun, remerging pieced together in a way that-- while vaguely recognizable-- still evokes fresh horror. Clouds like poisonous mushrooms, packed into missiles the size of a giant's aspirin
to crack up, that's all there is to it. Anyone who saw him down here every night, especially like this-- as close as idolatry as a Catholic boy from Brooklyn is ever likely to get-- would know he's a lot closer to the edge than he claims. He is not the only pilgrim here, however. Be it faith, madness, or something in-between, the skid marks on the floor betray one other. Rogers cleaned up a similar set three days ago, but their reappearance inspires no irritation. In fact, the very sight of them is heartening.
Flicking the top open with a practiced thumb, Roger's fingers blindly ascertain there is the only one pill in his palm before he shoves the tiny missile under his tongue. At the same time, he clamps his lips together in a grim vise. Once in contact with his saliva, the pill begins to dissolve-- not as liquid, but as a pure oxygenated mist. 'Tri-Ox', the Pharma Guild calls it. Breathing out through his nose, careful that only carbon dioxide should escape, he inhales through lips still mostly closed, tipping his head back to ensure as much of the precious substance flows down into his lungs as possible. Steve has never seen an ocean with his own two eyes, but he nevertheless pictures the sudden relief he experiences in just that manner. The mist, vaguely salty with additives of analgesic and minor muscle relaxers, is like a dense wave crashing upon the shore of some previously airless moon. That first high tide which comes to pull him from where he lies, beached and breathless as any mer-folk of his mother's stories, in an ever darkening limbo.
"What would you like to eat?" Tony asks, perhaps subconsciously inspired by his mate's thoughts. Then, just as quickly, "Never mind, I'll have them bring a little of everything."
The sentiment is much appreciated-- almost sweet, though he's as yet no judge of his alpha's conscious character-- but hardly material. Given Tony's fame (or infamy) the story has almost certainly been beamed around the entire planet and back by now, noted in every digitized journal and covered by any holo-program even touching on science, industry, academia, or politics. The minute Steve disentangles himself from his enticing new mate, he's going to have a more-than-academic understanding of just what a nightmare this is. It's going to hit him like a ton of bricks-- like a right hook from Rumlow, that bastard alpha prime of the schoolyard. Rogers never backed down from a dust-up with the behemoth, but he almost never came out on top, either. 'Sometimes,' Bucky would say, 'I think you
Fisting his hands in the couch's accompanying ratty blanket, frayed at the edges from the many fumblings of Dummy and U, Steve feels a fresh sting of screaming and cancerous grief. There's no escaping the scent of grease, oil, and other less identifiable chemicals in Tony's inner sanctum, but the
-- he's fully aware his imagined conversations with Tony are just that, and that his pantomime is a poor one to boot. Denial is a part of the grieving process, the SHIELD-mandated therapist tells him; there are five stages, or eight, or twelve, depending on who you ask. There are support groups where you're supposed to talk about it-- which is fine, he supposes, assuming you can find the words-- and daytime talk shows willing to dissect it in a week-long series.
bonds-- spontaneous, true connections sparked by spiritual or genetic compatibility (depending on one's philosophy) occur in less than forty percent of the population, and convention ensures that most of these are only within the same social strata. Great care is taken to keep like with like. Yet this bond
-- repulsors instead of rockets!-- and he's a swell guy.' That he was a bit more uncertain about the bodyguard's employer went unsaid. Jan had hummed her agreement, but he had seen Natasha's gaze flicker amidst the kitchen's many reflective surfaces, as if she observed him from all angles and thus knew something he himself did not.
"How's that working out for you?" the smaller man asks, taking one of those calloused hands in his own and squeezing gently. The rumors must be true-- despite the stereotype of the aristocratic alpha, Stark must do a great deal of engineering work himself.
Still, it's not bad work, as work to be had with only a Basic Education certificate goes. They can afford real meat every ten-day-- not synthetic protein strips-- if Steve hasn't been too sick, and they bought a larger heat cube over the winter. More importantly, they can lodge at whatever beta boarding house they choose. No living in a company compound where they garnish half your wages for the privilege of tenancy in a cupboard. Recently, Bucky's started going on about how, in a few months, he might be able to take out a loan on a mid-sized holo vid unit, something he's been lusting after for quite a while.
Smiling ruefully, Tony considers the advice. 'A prisoner's first obligation…' He hardly needs to be told that, having written the proverbial book on modern day escapes, but there's something about hearing the words in Steve's voice that makes them sound more… solid. There's a quality in super soldier's bearing that has nothing to do with the serum, an earnestness his mannerisms that draws Tony even as it aggravates him. The push and pull of the tide; a desire for union that also frequently sounds like an argument. In ("no, I didn't!"), out ("yes you did!"). He'd never in a million years say as much, especially not now, but the entire team had responded to that essence in Steve-- had, at times, been held together by it. Captain America, the great binding polymer, whose capacity for belief made things
He's been placed in, of all things, some sort of vat. Carved from unbroken stone like every other feature of the cell, its rim extends just below eye-level, allowing the contents to engulf him up to his adam's apple. The distressing, inches-distant threat casts his mind repeatedly back to his torture in Afghanistan, though he quickly chokes (ha ha!) off the memories. Despite the constant low-grade anxiety this inspires, Tony almost wishes it were only water he's contending with.
They've finally managed to get more than an arm's length apart, Stark reactivating his slim palm-sized screen with a thumbprint, obviously ready to make the first in a series of calls. His eyes are still fixed on Steve, however, their gaze as palpable to the omega as invisible fingers slipping under his robe. It is for this reason-- the preservation of coherent thought, for both of them-- that Steve mumbles something about the 'fresher, gesturing vaguely towards the adjacent sliding door, and high-tails it in that very direction.

of them interviews with the most high-profile and high-paying employer in three districts, but whatever it was had to be impressive. They're not rolling in credits by any means, but this is the most Rogers has ever been paid for what is essentially menial labor. It's work most comparable establishments have automated to one degree or another, but the Grandmaster prides himself on providing the authentic luxury of human servants. As a bouncer, Bucky's function is more glamorous only by virtue of visibility. He must always look immaculate, but he says it's really just a lot of hurry-up-and-wait. When he is needed, there's always a barrage of abuse from the offending alpha or alphas, none of whom hesitate to remind the guards of their place on the social totem pole. 'If I had a five-piece for every time some drunken peacock told me they could buy and sell my whole family, I might be able to buy and sell
Feeling abysmally foolish and longing for the ignorance of only moments ago, Steve barely notices the sudden liquefaction of his knees. Hands failing to find purchase on the sides of the marble sink, he slides down to the verdant tile floor, hips and tailbone jarring against the hard surface as though to emphasize how ill-suited they are for the task Nature has apparently chosen. His own mother had been a slender creature, and the entry of her son into the world a prolonged and dangerous ordeal. She very nearly perished. Certain persons in the village were not shy about remarking that it might have been better if she had--  she and her runt pup, with her. While perhaps an inch or so taller than Sarah har'Rogers, Steve is thinner still, and of a more 'delicate' (how he
"Not so well," Tony chuckles. As quickly as the delight appears, it is submerged beneath a more serious look of concern. Stark's face is as mobile as it is neo-classically beautiful, expression not at all concealed by his neat, if eccentric, beard. "Are you well? In pain anywhere?"
May I present Chapter Two: in which Steve considers the situation in a larger context and very quietly panics, Tony panics less quietly, and the boys manage to communicate without really talking.
But Steve can see his own reflection very clearly in the glass, a plaid overlay across a mask he knows better than his own face. The blood in his own veins pumps swift and certain, yet it lay very nearly still in a coffin of ice for more than seventy years.
What compensation Rogers receives-- if any-- is a pittance. Reinstein takes it out of his own paycheck, when he can afford it. But it's nice to do something other than scrub pots, and the chorus 'tweeners are always very complimentary about his designs. They like Steve, with the absent companionability one shows towards a pet or mascot. Sometimes it rankles, but mostly it's fine. He's never really expected to find another beta willing to take him as a romantic mate-of-choice, and his brotherly partnership with Bucky has always been enough for him. At age seven, he'd run headlong into a trio of alphas beating up on some unfortunate beta from town. The interference mostly resulted in said alphas whaling the tar out of
, and he was looking at Tony from under those pretty eyelashes, and it hit him that he was so beyond incredibly gone for this man.
The man laughed warmly and bent down a bit to chase Tony’s lips, but then his brow furrowed. “Wait, aren’t you cold? Where’s your coat?” He rubbed his hands up and down Tony’s arms to generate some heat, but then he looked down at their feet.
He was about to walk up the snow-dusted front steps when the front door flew open and a very harried-looking man in a suit (almost as drab as the SUV) rushed out of the house as if he couldn’t get out of there fast enough. Tony watched as the man stumbled through the snow and seemed to shout out a jumbled mess of an apology as he realized who he had just darted past. Tony just raised an eyebrow at the chaos as the man leapt into his SUV and peeled down the driveway, stirring up a flurry of snow in his wake.
As he gingerly turned back the cover, Tony heard the bed creak as Steve stood up and came to stand next to him, watching over his shoulder with a melancholic smile. It dawned on him that Steve probably hadn’t seen his own drawings in…
Gently, Tony sat down on the bed next to him, leaving as much space between them as he could, trying to not crowd the other man on the narrow mattress. “What do you think they are?”
“At first it annoyed him, ya know, brought up bad memories, but he’s come to begrudgingly accept it.”
Tony felt his heart sink as the smile vanished from Steve’s face and his brow furrowed. His gaze lost that twinkle Tony was starting to get used to seeing when they were together. “Could what be guilt?”
He couldn’t even protest when Clint decided to get the cat a purple collar because the way the color popped against the orange of his fur was just really nice. The archer had declared the cat looked “dashing” in purple, and honestly, he was right.
“Well, I stripped down to my boxers to express my feelings, so I’d say we’re in the same boat here at least.” Tony let out a chuckle at how ridiculous both of them were.
Tony grabbed onto the blanket, hoping it would act as some sort of buffer so that he could actually touch Steve, and thankfully, unexplainable ghost physics were on his side in that moment. He pulled Steve against his chest, resting his cheek on top of the blanket pulled over Steve’s head. The iciness felt like it was seeping through the blanket, like that first morning when Steve walked through him, but a million times worse.
” Steve’s cheeks were turning a bright red as he understood what Tony meant. “Oh, that’s… not illegal anymore? That’s great.”
That seemed to help a bit, as the ranger clearly bit his bottom lip to keep from outright laughing at Tony’s antics, though there was still a weariness in his eyes that was unbefitting a man of his age. Tony couldn’t help but wish that they could have been born into a world that wasn’t on the precipice of destruction.
“Now that you’re here, actually, I was on my way out, too. I’ll show you to your room first, Mr. Stark.” He motioned for Tony to follow him back into the hallway and led him up the stairs, pointing out various rooms and tossing out tidbits of information about the history. Tony wasn’t really listening, but he did tune in when Coulson mentioned the pantry and fridge had been freshly stocked.
“I’ve gotta tell Fury,” Tony headed towards the door, but he paused in front of it and whirled to face Steve again, stopping him with a hand on his chest.
Sometimes Orion would be in the workshop with Tony, and Steve would take up residency on the couch and observe their interactions while he drew. Even Tony’s bots seemed to be taken with the little cat. When Dum-E wasn’t making questionable smoothies for Tony, the bot would dangle a toy from his claw for Orion to jump up and smack around.
Never one for awkward silences (but definitely one for awkward rambling), Tony felt like maybe he should get to know the man in front of him a little better after the emotional moment he’d had in the study.
“Oh, thank god.” Tony sighed in relief. “I was really about to do whatever the hell you wanted there.”
There was a long pause before Steve answered him. “It’s… cold.” His voice was so quiet, so… distant. Something wasn’t right.
“I think I’ve earned myself a permanent position on Steve’s shit list,” he began explaining, though he wasn’t sure why. The guy just had one of those faces that made a person spill their guts. “I made the grave mistake of asking about some art supplies in the attic, though it probably didn’t help any that I had yelled at him about his dead best friend right before that.”
In his peripheral vision, there’s an extraordinarily bright flash of lights, and Tony breaks away from Steve’s kiss to reluctantly check it out. When the light dies down, there’s nothing but Norse god in the pod’s viewport.
In absolute contrast to Natasha, sometimes he found Bruce taking naps with Orion curled up at his side on the couch. Bruce had commented that it was very calming, and Clint joked about the cat being some sort of “serotonin machine.”
It was like time had frozen as they stared at each other across the yard, both at a loss for words. A sudden gust of wind not so gently reminded Tony that he had ran outside without his coat on, so he slowly made his way back across the yard. Steve hadn’t so much as moved from his spot in the doorway, and Tony hesitantly reached out to him, overwhelmingly grateful when he found he could still touch him. Gently, Tony pulled the taller man down into a hug, whispering an apology as Steve buried his face in the crook of Tony’s neck.
uncertain of you," he admits. "I imagine you feel the same way about me, at least a bit." Stark has far less to worry about, though. He is an alpha, and so every high card already belongs to him.
It's true, then, Steve acknowledges-- but only in the dark, empty spaces behind his heart. The reason for the faint thought is two-fold: first, the difference between understanding and acceptance and, the second, sheer self-preservation. He can feel the newly formed bond humming along his surface considerations, what the Church calls 'a twining of the outer souls'. Right now, confusion reigns between the bondmates-- static cutting in and out so often one can barely make out the song. Gender Treachery-- what is more colloquially referred to as 'passing'-- is illegal. Steve can't even hazard a guess as to how the alpha would react to the revelation that he was not, perhaps,
is ill-fitting and still not quite appropriate, but he also treasures his new and obstinate doubt towards the Divine. It reminds him of Tony, of old and largely playful arguments he now continues alone-- though with a much more conciliatory attitude-- in the dead of night. Now they can commiserate, he and the memory of his lover, on the imperfect construction of the universe and all within it.
It's a rote response, and he ruins it by choosing that moment to push up on his elbows in a clumsy attempt to sit. The bed is a sybarites's dream, embracing both occupants to a point that makes keeping one's balance in the softness an exhausting effort. Flinching (and blushing-- why not multitask?) in a manner impossible to hide, he bites down on an accompanying groan as unfamiliar muscles loudly register both their existence and their complaints.
Having never been very good at the first two, and well aware of the spectacle he made in the kitchen, Rogers doesn't think his career as an omega is off to a very good start.
This chamber seems contrived to make him acknowledge himself, as laughable as that sounds. Solitary confinement has its side effects (many of which come on more quickly than expected), and he's had more than his fair share of time in the hole, but this is something
Phrasing aside, Tony hadn't been all that surprised by evidence of Cap's good opinion, merely disconcerted at knowing it had been so openly articulated. He'd managed to tolerate a 'you're alright, Stark' on their way to the infamous shawarma (along with the hearty shoulder-clasp of a man who still sometimes misjudged his own strength), but made it a point to cut any further praise or attempted apology off at the knees. Rogers, he has learned, is someone who can actually occasionally admit when he's wrong; a terrifying opening Tony learned not to give others long ago. Keep up with the pace, Cap-- it's the 21st century and we're never wrong or really sorry, only sorry we got caught. The potential for real friendship with his fellow Avenger has remained present but untapped, along with the definite attraction a wild dwarf planet might feel for a stable main-sequence star. Gravity which must be resisted because the cost was simply too high. There are things to admire about Rogers; idiosyncrasies to be affectionately annoyed by, flaws and differing opinions held sometimes so righteously that they actually make him refreshingly human. They're both grown men; comrades, fellow veterans of the PTSD wars, heavy on the bizarre histories but not totally without social skills. It could work, this camaraderie, and sometimes it actually does.
"Village healers or the dubious credentials of those in the Grandmaster's pay!" the alpha dismisses, as if someone like Steve would be worth even a glance from the doctor kept on staff at the resort. "In Nova York and Hu'Maliwo, there are specialists-- lots and lots of specialists! We can see as many as--"
Sickly, small, and hardly a sound genetic match for anyone, Rogers had been classified a beta at twelve, and the results were the same when he was retested per mandate at fourteen. No one ever questioned it;
Lithe and deceptively delicate in a sky blue gown, Helen had accepted Tony's hand-off of Steve with the same aplomb of being passed champagne.
Thus he puts his finger on whats bothering him, the vague mental association that's been with him since he first began analyzing his surroundings. For a time, he'd occupied himself with the logistics behind creating the lighting trick. After all, doing it up in arc reactor blue might be more appealing-- give Stark Industries a chance for ingress to the interior decorating market. But looking at it hurts, even thinking about it hurts, because the lines and angles are fundamentally
Even if the Grandmaster doesn't fire Tweedle Dee for the follies of Tweedle Dumb, the life Steve had is like Babylondon, which G-d struck from the Earth so thoroughly even the island on which it stood disappeared. The story of Lot's wife teaches one not to look back, but that's a hard command to follow when someone you love might be left to make their own way in the ashes.
"Are you afraid of me?" Stark asks, too absorbed in the inquiry to sound hurt. His face is that of a man presented with ancient Pre-Burn runes, or some esoteric quantum formula. He's trying to
'Nah,' he'd finally muttered, ignoring Natasha at her inscrutable ritual of morning tea. 'He's ten times better than anything out of
' It had not been the time for detailed revelations, nor had their intimate hunger allowed the attention span for such. From what little Steve can glean from their suddenly static-filled bond, he doesn't expect the inventor to be particularly forthcoming now, either.
. Tony has been forced to accommodate aliens and so-called magic in his world-view; enhanced humans and hammers that _judge_, to say nothing of the weekly artificially-enlarged monster attacking a national monument. There's just a certain point, however, at which he must put down his stylish Gucci heel. Magic is only science not yet understood-- an argument he loves to pick with Thor, especially given that Jane has unequivocally taken Tony's side. Loki's precious glow-stick is a perfect example. Within the scepter, a stone; within the stone, a gem that contained only

Unlike many of the jewelry-clad vultures Steve had encountered, Dr. Cho's tone had been playful but devoid of innuendo, as if they were two strangers who happened to be relaxing on the same summer pier. Her gentle hum filled him with a strong sense of relief and as much relaxation as he was generally capable of in a public setting.
Steve's censure and disappointment in Tony had been just as palpable. Forget Thor's chokehold and impassioned ranting-- Tony could have cheerfully clocked Rogers one for that one tired glance. Of course the soldier had been angry and distrustful-- he'd never been the wraithlike corpse of Stark's vision, so he didn't
Resentful humor; laughter after a sock in the jaw, your mouth full of bloody teeth. Part of it stems from the institutionalized use of betas for titillation and the fact unbounded alphas consider coupling with them a safe outlet for lust. Technically, alpha/beta intercourse is illegal, but political or financial visibility can achieve a paradoxically remarkable amount of discretion. People are always willing to look the other way for the right price.

Though he does not know his location, the identity of his captors, or the purpose of his confinement, Tony Stark has come to one inescapable conclusion: the accommodations are simply unacceptable.
Frustrated, disgusted with himself and sick of being in his own head, Steve stalks past the last few stations without a glance. He hardly needs his little tour at all, so clear and vivid are the images in his mind. It's the ritual that's important; making sure everything is where it should be, that he has his finger firmly on the page where Tony left off. Like confession, almost, in that it is a scouring of the soul. Beyond the work area is the storage and charging bay, a curvilinear chamber Steve sometimes referred to as a 'vestibule' purely for the sake of needling Tony. As aggravated as the engineer pretended to be, Stark himself indulged in enough 'braid-tugging' with his friend that he seemed oddly delighted by the attention in return. Iron Man models stand arranged in clear, shatter-proof cases all along the wall, looking as inscrutable as the guardians in an Egyptian tomb. Marks II almost up through the present-- save, of course, the active version. The one Tony was wearing when…
. Pointless of course, especially in that moment, facing hazel eyes full of practiced Ivy League compassion behind their armor of sensible glasses. He could see it written right there along the edges of her pupils; that the concern was real because, when you have a rare specimen, you don't break it or allow it to be destroyed.
His feelings on the matter have not changed, though they are often overwhelmed by resentment for what seems like a cosmic bait-and-switch. It leaves him feeling fickle, ungrateful, to rage at G-d for
Stark, who has been lingering on the opposite side of the door for longer than his vocalizations would have indicated, is at last moving away. Steve can sense the other man forcing his attention elsewhere. A moment later, a distant, one-sided conversation begins. "Still here, Pep. Yeah. Well, if that's true then I want you to land on them with both of your dainty but oh-so-capable feet! … Well, no, but if I'm not prepared for this, I can guarantee he isn't either-- he's not a pawn and I won't have him treated like one!"
imprint occurs; in the end, they're at the mercy of either biology's caprice or their parents' ambition. But if you're an alpha, already your own master in an Imperium of 1.5 billion people, the odds are a bit better you can stay that way.
Pushing the long crimson sleeves of the robe up past his elbows, Rogers activates the wash basin, dashing several handfuls of cool water on his face. The facilities are no less grand for being hidden discretely away, though it seems a waste of space to dedicate so much of the room to opulent tub and rugs alone. There's even a plush waterproof settee on the far side of the bath. It's as if the human function of digestive elimination is too crude to be acknowledged. But then, what does Steve know about the hygiene habits of high society alphas? Maybe some can't even lower themselves to cop a squat, and so just explode when they're forty.

She did a lot of eggs, and Tony supposes she was technically very good, even if she didn't stir his particular interest. There was something disorienting…
helpless as in the last few days. Thor stalks raging between worlds, calling in every favor owed him throughout the Nine Realms as he searches in vain for a lead. Hank and Bruce are preoccupied with gamma rays, neutrino behavior, and bizarre positron emissions as they comb last known locations, as well as the sites of two confirmed deaths. Natasha has descended so far into underworld channels that even Clint cannot follow, seeking any intel other nations may be hiding about losses within their own borders. Which leaves Barton, Van Dyne, and Rogers himself to monitor the situation and maintain guard against any other opportunistic villains. In addition to liaising-- or attempting as much-- with Reed Richards, who has allowed his own portion of the investigation to wander down some rabbit hole Pym and Banner find both questionable and dangerous by turns. Janet is working to keep the lines of communication open, but even her patience is wearing thin.
"Are you certain?" Tony asks, after a pause in which his mate can sense the inventor weighting the right to privacy against the sheer overwhelming desire to offer succor. Most alphas likely would have broken the door down by now, sliding dura-steel panels or no, so Steve works hard to project gratitude for the space instead of distress over everything else.
Bristling reflexively at the vague implications of condescension and charity, Rogers manages to check himself. It's on his lips to say that he has always looked out for himself-- a half-truth Bucky was always kind enough to avoid correcting-- but he stays that, too. '
They sit like that for some time, backs against the mirrored and marble wall, beside the washbasin with its faucet-dolphins leaping in gold. The silence between them is strange, thick but somehow incongruously comfortable. What can be said, at this point? Yet, as Steve gazes on their reflections amidst the forest of nephrite-veined columns, he cannot help but think they look like nothing so much as two boys sprawled and resting, deliberately relaxed to disguise the fact they are hopelessly lost.
This is madness! He has fallen into a land of attitudes and expectations so foreign he might as well be on one of the Imperium's infant colonies. If the intersection of fate and random circumstance affected him alone, he would still be overwhelmed, but at least he would be free of the guilt that hass been nagging him-- however distantly, thanks to heat and pheromones-- since he lost sight of Bucky's face in the crowd nights ago. Barnes has always refused to divulge just how he managed to get
half). Anyway, he felt like it said a lot about the kind of person Steve truly was that he refused to allow the system to abandon his friend after Barnes had given so much to the cause. But then again, the bond that Jaeger pilots shared… was something truly indescribable.
“Holy shit, Steve. I don’t really know much about art, but I can recognize skill when I see it.” The man ducked his head shyly at Tony’s praise, and god
The cat wandered around getting to know all the interesting new people as they showed up. Orion somehow wasn’t fazed by Thor’s booming voice, nor Natasha’s generally intense presence, though Steve noticed her posture immediately softened when the cat approached her. Instead of returning to Steve to settle back down, he curled up in Bruce’s lap and promptly fell asleep, and Steve tried not to feel disappointed about it.
“So there’s a situation with one of the properties your family owns,” she started the moment Tony had let his guard down and taken the first bite of sugary goodness.
“Natasha was right, I do like cats. But I honestly didn’t think you were going to keep the little guy.” Tony’s voice sounded distant, and the ‘I didn’t want to get attached in case’ was unspoken, but Steve could feel it. “Attachment isn’t something I deal with well, if you haven’t caught on by now, let alone when the attachment is to something… squishy.”
“Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty!” chorused a much too cheerfully awake voice as the door was thrown open so hard that it clattered against the wall as it made contact. The sheet over his head was ripped away, and Tony was greeted with the sight of blonde locks and a playful smirk.
