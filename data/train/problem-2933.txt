Not that Dean was complaining. The first time he and Sammy had arrived back to see Cas standing in the kitchen, a freshly baked pie on the bench as the angel smiled that wide way he did when he was genuinely proud of achieving something on his own— Well, let’s just say Sammy was lucky he didn’t suffer as much mental scarring after that incident as Dean had wanted to inflict on him. He found it hard to resist his angel at the best of times.
this person yet, you have no clue why they phrase things the way they do! Maybe it’s an inside joke or a reference! Maybe they’re fucking around with you! Maybe they’re pulling you out of someplace other than Hell that’s coincidentally named for it!”
I'm struggling to get a grip on writing cas again i feel, so sorry if he's slightly ooc. probably doesn't help that i keep writing him with differing levels of human and angelness (and au-ness) and I feel like that would impact how he behaves in small ways even if through it all he's still Cas. i dunno, i may be overthinking things and yall may read this like 'nah it feels like cas' or 'yeah its ooc slightly but in the same way All ur cas writing is slightly ooc' or something lol
They headed down to the beach a few hours after checking in— they would’ve gone down earlier, but Dean had wanted to ‘test the bed’ and Cas hadn’t exactly been complaining— and watched the waves together quietly, feet tangled together in the sand. Dean’s head rested on Cas’ shoulder, and both of them had slung an arm around the other's waist.
also i was reading back through these and now that i use em dashes all the hyphens annoy me so i made use of my fancy schmancy new keybind (thank god for autohotkey, i just set it up so the numpad minus works as an em dash because the word shortcut uses that minus specifically) and have started to fix that
She reached out for a moment, as if she was going to touch his arm gently, and he stepped back, irritated. Cas, who had given up pretending he was focused on the exhibit as soon as he realised she wasn’t leaving them alone, frowned as if he was about to say something. Before he could, though, Dean had levelled a glare at the woman.
“So, are you like— changing your name or anything?” Dean asked, looking at them slightly cautiously. “If you’re not sure yet, or whatever else, that’s fine! I, uh— I googled the other day, because I wanted to know more about, uh, genderfluid and non-binary people than I already did, so I could support you better, but there was a lot of stuff about how varying it is from person to person.
again I'm not mad at her or anything (if anything i feel guilty abt making her feel guilty) its just real shitty timing esp since idk if next Wednesday will work for me or not and also i now have 0 plans to get my mental health consistently back up as fanfic etc isn't helping outside a temporary serotonin boost and i really don't wanna be feeling this shitty for another week.
can't even talk abt fandoms bc i fell back into reading for spn again so its not interesting!! y'all know i like spn!!!!!
complain if you don’t like where you end up— the most I can promise is ensuring there’s no cases there before I book.”
it makes me relieved tho bc i was considering not going for a few reasons, and now i am thinking i will with this new version of the trip because a) two of the organisers were a main reason why i was thinking i might drop out and b) the vibes seem a lot better now???
He’d asked about it once, when Cas had painted them while sitting at the bench as Dean baked. He didn’t mean anything by the question, wasn’t passing a judgement on this new way Castiel had decided to express himself, so he was amused when Cas squinted curiously down at his half-finished nails for a few moments before glancing back up and shrugging in Dean’s direction.
Another long’un today but I cannot be bothered posting it separately and it’s under 800 words sooooo
He just didn’t seem to be any more inclined to help Dean in his dramatic quest than he had been when Dean first summoned him.
related to a hunt to do for such a long stretch of time was… disconcerting. A part of Dean wasn’t sure he liked it.
It’d been a few years since Dean regularly went out to bars, excluding what was needed to get info on hunts, but they felt like a vestige of his old life somehow. His life
The fogginess he got if he went too long without sleep, and in the mornings before he had his coffee, he could do without. If he could retain both the ability to sleep beside Dean every night and the alertness he’d had as an angel, things would be a little easier. Actually tasting food was nice, but having to remember to eat even when he was entrenched in activities was not. And general bodily functions were just
“He has working eyes, right? Like, we weren’t gettin’ served by a blind waiter? Because he obviously has no issues with your personality if you two are best pals.”
“Yeah, no, we, uh, we’ve dealt with him already. I guess it’s slightly more accurate to say God is dead, and we killed him.”
Dean froze, body thrumming with an entirely different sort of nerves than before. There were only two things related to the agency that would cause Cas to forget himself enough to call Dean right in the middle of class, and Cas didn’t seem upset enough for one of them. That meant…
Ex-angel dealt with, he made his way gently through the halls of their new house towards the kitchen, Miracle on his heels. He hadn’t planned anything
“And if you need to get somewhere magical that doesn’t have a traditional road or anywhere to park?”
i've had there! right there! (aka gay or european) stuck in my head all day and imma commit arson lmao. my brain was reminded of it while reading a hannibal fic and playing it has Not Helped hdmsnbhnk
in good news i did a fair bit of writing for the fix-it last night instead of sleeping fkxdhzj. productivity win!
“I mean. I understand that, but we haven’t ever spoken before today. Surely they understand that if we were working together, there’d be
“Yeah!” The woman continued. “It was really weird, he kinda fell off the face of the earth a few years ago. He had a wife and a kid and then he just sorta. Disappeared. None of us really know what happened to him.”
“Well, Cas— Do angels have soulmates? Because that sounds a hell of a lot like the dreams I had in the meetup to meeting Jess for the first time.”
“I don’t mean to alarm you,” Cas said, keeping his voice low, “But a woman has been staring at us for the last 10 minutes or so.”
“I haven’t noticed any issues in the sexual intimacy department. I’m sorry if I missed anything on your side of thi—”
shocked to find that it would work perfectly no matter what. It was a real start, and that was a helluva lot better than what they’d had previously.
also idk how security cameras in colleges work its quite possible that they wouldn't be installed in professors offices anyway (or if they are they probably don't have audio) bUT I'm gonna work on the theory that they do in order to stop students from like, breaking in to try and steal test results etc, and have audio because. reasons. maybe the meeting was being recorded as evidence,. maybe azazel is being hella careful because he can't have any evidence that he's a massive creep.
edit: holy shit i keep forgetting to add a title and summary before posting chaps LMAOOOOO this is like the third day I've hit post then just
It’s Dean that finds it, and Sam isn’t sure if he should be surprised or not. Dean’s never been one for research, had never really had the patience for it, but he was far from unintelligent. He just usually applied it in different ways.
However, even with that, I ended up starting this soulmate au that I expect I will one day continue and post fully. I’ve added this to a series that I’ll post any stories that spawn from this into (I’ve already added little shadow) to go along with posting the link in the end an of specific chapters, because it means y’all don’t have to come back and check if I’ve finished them off and posted and can instead just sub to the series lol
They couldn’t stay like this forever, though, so eventually he found himself disentangling from Cas’ arms. They stared at each other silently for a moment, Dean afraid to break the moment by disrupting the quiet, but he found the words welling up inside him.
“Yeah— uh. Meg ended up asking me for help on it the other day so I’ve actually finished it now. Sorry.”
As he continued down the path to humanity, Cas found himself... wanting, in ways he never had before. He’d catch Dean’s eyes on a hunt, see him grin in a self-satisfied way, and it opened up a yearning in his slowly forming soul that he didn’t quite know what to do with.
extend to the point where they help a resurrectionist dig up and sell their father’s body… I saw the shovel you brought last night.”
Any small level of worry that otherwise lingered in the back of his mind dissipated when he rolled over with a groan and felt a crinkle of paper underneath his cheek. A minute later, he’d roused himself enough to sit and check the note Cas had left for him, unable to quash to fond smile that rose to his face as he stared at the familiar handwriting.
“I… don’t know, actually,” Cas replied. “The symptoms came on very slowly. I thought that it was just a cold or something similar at the start.”
yes i know technically magnus is not the high warlock at the point in time that this is set but shhhhhh we ignoring that, this is a mishmash of book and show canon remember
A moment of silence passed, slightly less awkward than the one from when Cas first entered the room, and Dean found himself reaching out to clasp Cas’ hand in his own. If Cas had made baby steps towards naming this thing between them, he could make baby steps in his own way. The bright grin Cas sent his way as their fingers interlaced was
he stumbles across it, even if he couldn’t say why. Dean didn’t say anything, didn’t even look up from the book that he was skimming through, but a tangible energy had suddenly filled the room.
i spent like four hours in a vc suffering absolute brainrot w online friends as we all compulsively refreshed twitter and tumblr today. i am exhausted but have no regrets at all. dean and cas are married and it was beautiful and I'm so glad i got to attend.
I’d apologise for consistently going back to this au but I have many thoughts abt it and I don’t see y’all complaining djdjskks
truly tempted to just. rewatch lazarus rising so i can just,,,, stare at cas at the end without feeling like my mum will judge me (i mean she already did tbf so i probs could've). yes i have issues.
I think I did too much today to like, wallow in feeling shitty tbh, so leaving the house was probably good for me. I’m definitely not at 100%, and my vibes could crash after I post this fairly rapidly (wouldn’t b the first time), but I survived my class & chatted with a new classmate, ended up meeting the friend I thought I wouldn’t see even if it was only for 30 mins, and hung around with my brother and a few of his mates this afternoon at the clubs showcase (as well as getting free shit w/out signing up for clubs because he knows people). Weird vibes returned whenever I was still for too long, which I think he picked up on (I kept getting up out of the stall and like, walking around in front of it lol) which he used to advertise more clubs at me in what i think was his way of like, keeping me distracted like i so desperately needed fjskdksl
With all the usual culprits ruled out, Dean sat up and swung his legs off the side of the bed, forcing himself out of the warm comfort the bed covers provided. He could hear the faint murmur of noise from across the hall, in Jack’s room, and he wouldn’t be surprised to find Cas had spent the last few hours in there, watching over Jack sleeping with the same intensity he used to reserve for Dean and Dean alone.
“Well, when we were out at the farmers market this morning and I wandered off while you were talking to the beekeeper, I walked past a stall selling them and noticed they had a bee shaped one. The chick running the stall noticed me looking and… convinced me into buying some.”
Cas rehashed his worries that he would struggle to connect emotionally with any of their kids, that he’d turn as cold and distant as his father had been and subsequently his eldest brother seemed to be with his own son. Dean admitted he was still worried that he’d turn to alcoholism to deal with his issues if things started to get tough. Both of them were worried that something would happen to the other and they’d feel they had no options but to leave their children alone for long periods of time, as they had been growing up, even with the stable jobs they were employed in compared to their fathers. As the night passed, they reassured each other that they would be okay, that they’ll hold each other accountable and not be afraid to lean on the support system provided by their friends and families if needed, legs stretching out and tangling together as they both lost some of the tension they were carrying in the reminders that neither of them were in this alone.
But the important things, the things Dean had always subconsciously worried about in regards to ever pursuing something with Cas (not that he’d allowed himself to consider the possibility much)? Well, they didn’t, not in any way that would matter.
didn’t tell you he was here? He just left before you were conscious enough to think about checking who was at your bedside?”
Cas paused for a moment, obviously considering his experiences, but he resumed walking almost instantly.
I feel tall as fuck in them (they're my highest heels plus have a chonky sole) even tho I'm like. maybe the average height for afab folks in them (I'm, uh, 5'1 lmaooooooo)
But processing things had left him wholly unable to pretend Cas hadn’t meant the world to him, and the idea that he might never see the angel again?? Well, it’d given him his fair share of sleepless nights, that was for sure.
He told himself he was just being practical, waiting for the ‘right time’ in between all of their hunts and apocalypse averting activities. Justified things as him not wanting to spring the subject on Dean, wanting things to instead come up naturally in a situation where the hunter wouldn’t get spooked. Denied the idea that he was being self-serving in any way by avoiding the topic, that was allowing himself to cling to these moments where Dean didn’t
got an assignment in today just one + a quiz to go over the weekend (then the essay next fri but I got plenty of time for that lol)
this would theoretically b where i finished the full fic if i ever properly finish it up and publish it separately, so unless i go back and fill in the gaps in future drabbles this might be the End Of This AU. or i might add a fluffy established relationship drabble or two. we shall see.
also i finished my very abridged watch through of shadowhunters that i started two days ago. sometimes the best way to consume a show is by watching a playlist of all the interactions between 2 characters in it then watching the two finale eps in full <3
“I don’t really know what you want me to say, Dean. I thought— Well— It seemed fairly self-explanatory to me.”
it — that allowing himself to feel so freely left him vulnerable. He’d glance over at Cas frequently and find himself bowled over by the wave of love that flooded his system, at risk of drowning in the ocean that comprised of his affection for the blue-eyed angel he had essentially sworn his life to. He’d be okay, though.
look I'm tired of hearing abt academic integrity bc i get it by now lol and sometimes i daydream and come up with fic ideas in my boredom in classes and sometimes those ideas are directly influenced by the content we covering
i made smart mental health decisions today (didn't go hang out with a group of friends bc i knew i wasn't up for it energy or social interaction-wise based on how i did in class) so like. that's a good thing ig? seeing them might've been nice if i was less exhausted over everything but the one person i'd really wanna see wasn't gonna b there so i decided that it wasn't worth how i'd feel afterwards.
been drinking prior to this. Hell, the first night they spent in the resort had been spent doing questionable amounts of shots in the hotel’s bar till the wee hours of the morning. But this was the first time they’d gone
“It’s not anything to do with you, Dean! It’s just not a level of intimacy I personally enjoy, no matter who it is I am in bed with."
“That certainly explains why you’re both so comfortable with each other!” She remarks with a nod, and they smile back at her as she walks away
happened to be far enough away from their conversation that Dean suspected Cas had half-hoped he would forget about the whole ‘celebrate Cas’ birthday’ plan. If true, Cas had severely underestimated Dean’s determination to throw him a proper birthday.
On top of that, the dreams themselves were very strange. They were muddled and unclear, all centring around a pair of bright green eyes that he associated instinctively with
adjustment, but the wording isn’t very clear. It’s designed to open up a portal to anyone you channel it towards, and it implies that includes people that aren’t still alive, but the Empty is more complex than Heaven and Hell.”
you know? Because after everything we did to stop everyone that Chuck decided to throw at us for kicks, it feels like humanity is gonna be its own downfall, and there’s nothing we can do to change it.”
The dreams were nothing, he was sure. It was just… his minds way of processing falling, the change from angel to human.
This was unplanned and would probably go nearer the end of this au but I was having feelings abt the fact that I have 5 soulmate aus in a show that’s all abt free will where cas falling in love with dean was explicitly going against gods plan. And I have things that like, reason that put in my brain to make it seem less weird (eg soulmate dreams is set in an au where chucks not a total dick even if he is a bit absent, and although I may have written something that contradicts it I feel like someone other than chuck controls the connections in marks. I won’t talk abt words because that’s potential spoilers as I imagine I’ll address it in canon and I don’t have a solid reason in names yet bUT I think it would be very funny if chuck did control the marks to some extent in that but didn’t link dean and Cas, like cas being a bit cracked did that and literally altered Dean right into the past and chucks like ‘what the fuck how did this happen’ lol
was, and as far as I know you’re the only person around to be sitting vigil at my bedside. Are you telling me a ghost up and decided to hold my hand as I rested before running off to murder some folks? Because that’s the only other feasible option right now, buddy.”
“I’m Castiel, by the way. Castiel Novak, although I guess you’d know part of that from the gravestone.”
also the Australian government is finally gonna be paying me money so that's a relief bc they were being dicks abt getting my payment started and I had to redo my entire claim (meaning i don't get back paid :/)
i was productive today!!!! i updated the bnha chat fic that I haven't touched in like a year and a half so if any of yall like bnha then check that out as I somehow doubt my og readers are still around lol
be able to stay somewhere other than home without feeling the need to be ready to pack up and go in as short a time as possible.)
too much like the portal they’d gone through to exit the Empty, but an unfamiliar man stepped through a second later.
instead I read james bond fanfic and watch a bunch of bdg's videos bc productivity just. does not exist for me this week. for anything
i'm charging my switch tonight so i can check on my ac island for the first time in months, can't wait to pick some weeds tomorrow <3
Cas licked his lips before nodding, tension obvious in his body, and Dean smiled reassuringly before leaning in again.
Chaps 46-52, 73, 75, 107, 141, 177, 181, 195, 213, 233, 246, 261— dean and Cas walk along the beach 😌
like one of my old college buddies. Like, full-on spitting image doppelganger style. It’s… slightly freaky.”
Repressed implied a lack of awareness about what you were pushing down, that you’d thrown a sheet over the elephant in the room with your eyes screwed tightly shut before proceeding to ignore its presence, not willing to even
“I dunno, babe, I hadn’t really given it much thought before? I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about birds.”
If there are any aus y’all wanna see more from that I haven’t touched in a while, lmk!! I kinda lose track of this shit after a while fjsjsjdkv especially since my method of choosing what to add to often involves scrolling through recent(/recentish) chaps and seeing what stands out (unless I already have ideas lol, which does happen as well)
The day of Cas’ birthday dawned almost unusually sunnily for how early in the season it was. Dean wouldn’t be surprised to find that Jack had had a hand in that fact, though he’d probably never know for sure. He extracted himself from Cas’ arms as carefully as possible, by now acutely aware of how late Cas liked to sleep when given the chance, and dropped a gentle kiss on his brow when it furrowed slightly at the loss.
sky humbly requested more soulmate au the other day and who am i to deny them that content. this is cas' perspective which I'm less practised at + is set at a nebulous later point (look we haven't been able to watch more yet so I'm still working with full knowledge of only 4 seasons here despite all the spoilers i have for later shit) so sorry if its a lil janky but this section of the story is what was sticking out in my brain today.
I got 3 months of free discord nitro today bc of an epic games promo and I'm gonna be so sad when it goes away I love the cross server emoji thing
Dean remembered as well. Her daughter, Tasha, been a few years younger than him, but not young enough that her admiration was overtly uncomfortable to deal with. He
They haven’t been together for that long yet, not in the grand scheme of everything they’ve been through. Not by a long shot. And that relative newness, that moment of readjustment he has every time he sees Cas and remembers he doesn’t have to hold anything back, not anymore, definitely plays a part in that amazement.
anyway that's like the only thing that happened in my life today lol but it was a very exciting development
so reminder. I’ve watched like 19 episodes of this show. none of them include castiel yet. fully basing this characterisation off fics I’ve read because its like,, my only point of reference for him lol. excuse the fact that this is probably horribly ooc
it won’t be an issue? I know you have a soulmate, I remember you getting your Words in, so don’t try to pull
Unfortunately, now that Cas had acknowledged the truth of the matter — however long it took him to reach this point — he found himself
On top of that, the dreams themselves were very strange. They were muddled and unclear, all centring around a pair of bright green eyes that he associated instinctively with
So, when he sat across from Dean one Saturday afternoon and solemnly said ‘We need to talk’, it was no surprise when he was met with a frustrated Dean.
In this particular case, said person was actually an older woman — Susan — that they’d saved on a routine salt-and-burn a few years prior.
we started moving today!! we have about a week where we have access to both houses, luckily, but it's still stressful
“Cas?” He called again, more quietly this time, walking to their bedroom and peeking in in search of his husband.
“It may be my vessel, Dean, but this body still belongs to Jimmy. That’s why we need to talk about him, actually.”
The day had started off fairly normally, for them at least. It had been a fairly routine hunt, just a vamps nest, them getting their footing back after the slew of apocalyptic events they’d had to combat in recent times. But something had happened, something had gone
get his feathery ass into that hospital room, Sam would find an angel blade for the sole purpose of brutally murdering Cas with it, he knew he wasn’t imagining the slight tinge of fear that entered Cas’ gaze.
had to do something, this time. Cas was happy to go on with life as usual, pretending nothing had changed (and truthfully, nothing
It takes approximately two seconds for Dean to be in his personal space, hands on Cas’ hips and their lips pressed gently together. Their foreheads remained pressed together even as the kiss broke off, and Dean couldn’t help but grin.
Eventually, something had to give. Cas knew that, had known it since he first acknowledged who Dean was to him, and every day more he spent avoiding the inevitable conversation made it more and more difficult to broach. But he’d have to, and soon— Sam had been sending him worried looks recently, as if he was gearing himself up to ask Cas what was wrong, and he’d found himself avoiding Dean, which was neither sustainable nor something he was enjoying.
i cannot believe i've reached 100 days, that seems absolutely fucking batshit. that's almost a third of the way through. its not quite but it Feels like it is. what the actual fuck i feel Way too proud of myself for this
2) my oldest sister sent me the sweetest fucking message asking me what pronouns I use and telling me she’s proud of me for like, standing up for myself and my identity & gender presentation. I almost cried in the best of ways.
eager about things, but he’d gotten to class slightly earlier than he usually managed as Cas seemed to always be early.
“She came over to say hi and I noticed her shirt. I thought you would like it, so I told her about you.”
hard thing is bc I feel distant from a lot of my friend group (even tho I love and appreciate them) she remains one of the 3 friends that I feel like I could comfortably do one on one shit with (even if we're not going to be) so like. knocking her out of first place just sticks her in third which is still very fucking close.
Cas smile brightened, and Dean was very glad he’d been smart enough to put down the cloth he’d been holding when he’d seen Cas walk into the store. Dropping a cloth may not be as bad as dropping a mug, but he’d already endured
, and he found himself tightening his arms around Cas’ waist once again, and burying his head in the crook of Cas’ neck as best he could from his position.
also i had a close encounter w a huntsman spider on my dining table today. it was not fun. I'm gonna freak everytime one of my cats meows repeatedly now because that's how i discovered it as i was tryna work out what was up with her (normally when she randomly meows she wanders up and down the hallway, but she was just sitting in a chair staring at it. i thought she wanted to b up on the table for food and was blocked by my mums bag but n o she was tryna tell us abt the spider. which like. on one hand i appreciate. on the other please tell someone other than me next time k thanks shads)
Ah. So she probably wasn’t talking to him with the intention of ending up in his bed, as she didn’t seem surprised about the ‘husband’ bit, but there was always a chance she was just
to stay balanced when they actually left the ground. He wound his arms around Cas’ waist, trying (and failing) to not grip too tightly. Cas let out a small chuckle, as relaxed as he always seemed when he got on a broom, and Dean forced himself to relax slightly.
But on the other, a part of him was insisting that Cas regretted it, had overemphasised his emotions to try and comfort Dean, had meant love in a different way than Dean had interpreted, and the idea of that idea being true??
so i wanted to write established relationship fluff but couldn't get my braincells to work on the honeymoon fic so yall get that soulmate marks epilogue drabble i said i might end up writing. I really need to connect all of these properly for their own fic and some point but unis been hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
interest, was leaning forwards to bring their body closer to yours rather out of a desire to hear your words more clearly? And how was he supposed to make it clear that he was engaging in a conversation for purely friendly reasons, and wasn’t looking for anything more significant than that?
Sam had, unsurprisingly, done exactly what he’d said he would, and a few days after their wedding, Dean and Cas pulled up outside their accommodations for the next fortnight. The resort was far nicer than the hotel’s they tended to stay in for hunts, but not so much so that they’d feel out of place, and Dean grinned at Cas as they checked in to their suite, hands linked between them.
vics entering a snap lockdown so i have to do the first seminar for the philosophy unit I decided to do for some godforsaken reason through zoom and I already wanna die.
today was much less productive than yesterday unfortunately but I was in pain throughout it so its excusable lol (nothing bad dw!!). i wasn't planning on updating this au bc i've written a lil outside of this + I still feel moderately guilty abt it not being purely spn related even though I literally have no reason to lmao bUT it was on my mind today and nothing else was flowing right <3
Not that he wasn’t enjoying himself, of course. This time with Cas, the freedom to choose what they would do each day, to talk casually to people who would likely never know the true horrors of the world— it was freeing, in a sense. They didn’t have to worry about keeping up appearances or entrusting too much information to someone who was just as likely to try and kill Cas for his inhuman status as help, about how to best work together to try and take a deadly monster down while planning for whatever big bad had decided that
Chaps 156, 157, 162, 174, 190— dean and cas continue to be gay for each other and I love that for them
“My sheets need washing anyway, but I thought we could share tonight? If you’re okay with me watching over you, at least.”
See, Castiel was a fucktonne braver than Dean was about certain topics. That bravery had led to him forcibly pulling Dean’s head out of his ass a few months back, when Dean had almost died on a hunt. Cas had been
“Billie Eilish? She’s not the person I expected you to reference over the course of this conversation.”
“Gabriel is just as likely to prank me the moment I enter the building as he is anything else,” Cas admitted, and Dean sent him a wry grin.
“Oh, you mean the fact that you are still struggling to get past your internal boundaries on showing casual affection to male partners, especially in a more public setting.”
But for now, he carries his secret in silence, holds it close to his core where it thumps in time with his heartbeat, pulses around every cell of his body alongside his blood, lights up his soul in its brilliance.
As he looked across at Dean, all his planned-out explanations and questions flew from his brain. He tried to collect his thoughts, but Dean was growing more and more closed off by the minute, and he had a horrible feeling that he only had a couple more seconds before Dean would give up and walk off again. So he mentally scanned through everything he’d been thinking over in the last month or so, re-figuring out his main concerns and worries, then blurted out the first question that came to mind.
name update! i started using ember in like, food delivery apps and the like alongside in my own brain and seeing the ‘ur delivery is now confirmed, Ember!’ thingies did start to bring the serotonin as I got more used to the name so I’m gonna start tentatively using it in more places!! we love to see progress
The next time they were in class, Dean decided, he was gonna talk to Castiel. Again. Hopefully making it clear that he wanted the guy's number in a gay way, rather than in a classmates-potentially-working-on-an-assignment-together way. He tried not to look
“The nearest shelter had far too many animals, I didn’t want to overload them with more by giving them a litter of kittens when the animals they have are already going unadopted.”
He hadn’t actually bought Cas that many gifts, especially in comparison to the amount of things he’d eyed up online. Some new items of clothing, a honeycomb themed baking set, and a few other novelty items (both bee themed and not) ranging from the simple and cute to the ridiculously overpriced and tacky.
melt into Cas’ embrace, it didn’t take long for him to pull away, especially if someone else was in the room with them.
All this to say, Dean no longer knew if he wanted to keep to his usual birthday tradition. Although the peace of the open road still appealed to him, part of him was loath to give up the quiet mornings he’d been sharing with Cas lately. The comfort of his angel’s arms around him and the soft intimacy afforded by lying in with him for an hour or so before getting up and preparing for the day.
It’d been almost five years since Dean lost Cas, and scarcely a week had gone by where the angel didn’t cross his mind.
death and destruction in the world. Both monstrous and human. And it feels like there’s barely anything we can do to change things.”
different vibe to the fluff I've been piling on y'all this week, which explains why it has different vibes to the rest lol
“I named them Snowflake. Partially because they’re white and partially because they had a snowflake on their nose when I found them.”
Sam wasn’t sure what response he expected from his brother, but it certainly wasn’t the one he got. Dean threw his arms around his brother, hiding his suddenly-watery eyes from view, before pulling away just as abruptly.
The how and the why of the ritual's success were much less important than its existence, in the long run. As long as he kept having these quiet moments with Cas, Dean could take on whatever the world threw at him.
Chaps 156, 157, 162, 174, 190, 191, 204— more magnus/alec mostly but i did bring it back to our boys!
Cas blinked up at Dean seriously, as though he had to consider the offer, and a small smile broke over his lips.
want Michaels true vessel to have a soulmate? Someone that he would easily turn away from his divine duties for? Soulmates may have
this was part of the deal. They’d talked about it, when Cas was first considering things, and Dean had made it clear that he’d never loved Cas because of his powers. But the crushing feeling of

And sure, when they'd found Sam he claimed he had nothing to do with getting Dean out of Hell. Dean wouldn’t have been inclined to believe him, well aware that Sam was likely just as determined to rescue Dean from his fate as Dean had been him, but the surprise on his face when they reunited couldn’t have been faked.
“I see. And did the sheriff happen to tell you that my father’s death is well understood to have been as a result of consumption?”
hopefully u also agree some of them are funny because i spent almost 2 hours doing this (like i was getting distracted and shit for parts of it but it was. a lot more effort than u think) but even if u donot, at least it'll b useful. also i finally started to work on this au again, it only took me a lil over 3 months. also I'm using molt not moult I've decided actually, i have edited little shadow accordingly (and also edited it to make it better now that i feel more confident in my spn writing as part of the reason I've struggled to continue this is i just didn't feel happy with chap one in various ways)
Cas had always prided herself in having a strong sense of identity, having language to describe herself even when feelings and emotions failed. She’d latched onto pansexuality almost immediately after realising she wasn’t straight, was feeling more and more certain that she also lay somewhere on the ace spectrum as each day went by and those mythical hormones that were supposed to make her interested in sex didn’t appear; but here, when it came to something that was arguably one of the most significant aspects of herself, she was falling short.
not in the least. It explained why Sam had been hesitant to bring it up earlier, why all of his words about the spell so far had been couched in a series of ‘maybes’ and hopeful smiles. Dean would honestly have been
“Not— Not to do anything yet, obviously, I’m still not sure how ready I am for all that, but, well. I’ve already mentioned that I’m liable to get… ‘clingy’, as you put it, after a grooming session, and I thought—”

that could help him. Surely his soulmate wouldn’t leave him here, buried underground, with no escape route? Surely they’ve stayed around, waiting to hear noise from his coffin, and any moment now the dirt will be removed and the lid will be opened and he’ll be looking into the friendly eyes of his soulmate (his

“Well, come on then, babe! I can’t exactly go grab the box for you, I’ve been gravely injured. I don’t even know that a band-aid will fix it properly.”
This isn’t unexpected, considering his status. Rather than meeting the man in a tavern, or at the market, and choosing to spend the rest of his life with him, he is informed of his betrothal in a routine meeting with his father and their advisory staff. So when he first sets eyes on his future husband, it is in the portrait of the other prince that Bobby hands across to him with a consoling smile.
over the counter to throw his arms around Dean, far too surprised to think about exiting the service area the normal way. Multiple questions try to tumble out of his mouth about why and how Dean was back in-state, unfortunately all at once, resulting in a stuttered and probably incomprehensible mess of words (look, he may be energised by the sudden appearance of his
this is terrible but at least its not cars fanfic. It was almost cars fanfic. Blame my online friends for that fact.
He dissolves into a fresh fit of giggles. Dean's never seen him laugh so hard. It's absolutely beautiful.
The hunter gives him a confused look, but points to a red tab on his vest. "Pull this," he shouts, and then leaps out.
Castiel gives her a polite wave, then turns back to Dean. Perhaps he did take things a tad too far. If only Dean wasn't so
“That’s the thing, though,” Dean says, with a humorless chuckle. “We’re so different. You’re super smart, and you’ve got all these dreams of being a novelist and traveling the world. And I’m just a doofus who's probably gonna end up coaching high school football or being a douchey personal trainer. But you— you’re gonna do great things, Cas.”
Cas makes the cutest sound when Dean kisses him— a startled, muffled yelp that quickly melts into a contented hum— and somehow Dean just
Dean sucks in a breath and looks sharply at Cas, but Cas is totally focused on the screen. The only hint that anything is out of the ordinary is the tiny quirk at the corner of his lips. Motherfucker. He knows
Dean swallows hard. "I don't believe that," he says. "You're awesome, Cas. You'd do just fine. Even if you're an asshole."
level of alcohol tolerance instead of his own. He's thrown back four shots and he's only just now starting to feel buzzed.
been hanging out on this plane of existence for a good hundred years or so, but I’m the exception, not the rule.”
you want to explain?” Missouri cries, whirling on Sam. “I get a text from Dean at nine-thirty at night asking me to bring baby stuff over, and when I ask him what the hell for, he just says ‘long story.’” She lifts the pillow and starts whacking Sam with it instead. “A long story? Nothing long about it! You knock up some poor girl and now you’re a baby daddy, end of story!”
Dean puts his knife away and storms after him. "You're seriously going to play the 'why didn't you call me?' card? We didn't even fucking
Cas jerks violently and looks up, and Dean’s heart breaks into a million pieces. His friend's eyes are red and bloodshot, his whole face sagging with exhaustion, tears and snot streaming down his face. He’s letting out little hiccuping sobs, and he stares at Dean with blank eyes, like he’s not really seeing him.
Mary turns around, and Cas’ first thought is that it’s obvious where Dean and Sam get their good looks from. Mary is tall, blond, and willowy, with soft eyes and a gentle smile. “Hello, Cas,” she says, and her voice is gentle too. “Dean’s told me so much about you.”
Cas places Jack on the scale, keeping one hand on the back of the baby’s head. Jack scrunches up his face as the cold metal touches his skin, then lets out a wail that's amazingly loud for someone so small.
“I don’t understand,” Cas says as he slides into the Impala’s passenger seat. “Why aren’t Jack and Ben coming with us?”
Castiel leans forward and kisses him, long and deep and full of promise. "Only if I can, too," he murmurs.
“I don’t know,” Cas chokes out, and Dean hates how broken and defeated he sounds. “I don’t know what’s wrong. I can’t make him stop, Dean, I've tried everything and I can't make him stop—"
He reaches the edge of the platform and holds out his hand. “Heya, Cas,” Dean says, softly so that no one else can hear. “Why don’t you come on down from there?”
"Tell me," he whispers, breath hot against Dean's ear. "Tell me what you want and maybe I'll give it to you."
There’s silence for a few moments. Dean assumes Castiel’s gone off to change clothes, so he’s startled when a second pair of hands appear at the sink.
He wrenches open cabinet drawers and yanks out a fistful of dish towels and washcloths. "Here," he says, kneeling down in front of Dean. "Is it your finger? Or your hand?"
Sure enough, the bartender nods and reaches for a bottle of Jack, looking slightly less annoyed. Dean half-expects to get carded, but this guy doesn't seem to give a fuck how old he is. He pours a generous amount into a shot glass and slides it across the bar.
Gabriel snorts. “Dude, don’t compare yourself to me. You’re a seraph, not an archangel. Totally different thing.”
After a few more blissful seconds, Dean forces himself to pull away from Cas. Just for a second, so he can say the thing he needs to say.
Dean's not proud of the needy whimper that claws its way out of his throat, but he's too far gone to care. He watches, jaw slack, as Cas bends down and wraps his lips around Dean's cock, and then everything around him whites out, narrowing down to that single point of contact. It feels
Zachariah’s buggy eyes get even buggier. “If you’re not going to help me, why are you still in my office?”
“I mean, don’t get me wrong, I was digging the whole Apple Store vibe, but this is better. Kinda like ‘airport lounge meets Marriott convention center.’”
“You do know some things,” Dean says gently. “You know that the kid eats like a horse and wakes up every three hours like clockwork. You know that he likes it when I talk to him in stupid voices. You know that he likes looking at the elephant painting more than the turtle one.”
Once all adults are properly caffeinated, the boys insist on visiting the park. They also insist that Cas come with them, which means that he winds up acting as playground supervisor while Charlie and Dean find a nearby bench to sit and catch up. It’s there that Charlie pulls the entire story out of Dean, mumbled in between sips of dark roast and bites of blueberry scone.
Cas thinks immediately, and squashes the thought just as fast. He and Dean have been friends for nearly a year now, and he has yet to witness anything that suggests Dean is anything other than straight. Cas suspects that Dean would definitely
needs to stop thinking about this when Dean's sitting right next to him or they aren't going to make any progress.
“Just can’t believe she thought we were together,” he mutters, tapping the steering wheel nervously. “Wait. Do you think other people think that? Like when we were in the waiting room? People saw us and thought we were together? Like two dads?”
Dean chuckles from the couch, and Cas feels absurdly proud of himself for making a joke that was actually funny.
“As you know, every year we auction off something for charity,” Charlie continues, her gleeful smile still in place. “Last year it was free burgers from the Roadhouse. The year before it was free oil changes from Singer’s Auto. But at the end of the day, those are just
"Take me to the infirmary," Cas says with a smirk. "And I swear to God, if your panties show up on the X-ray, I'm going to murder you with my bare hands."
Dean pokes his head around the kitchen door and sends his brother a death glare. “Wafer thin ice, bitch.”
The next instant Cas is easing onto the bed, slotting himself right up against Dean, their faces nearly touching. He has a lazy smile on his face as he continues to palm his dick; Dean's eyes are drawn to it like a magnet.
because he doesn't want Cas to stop but he also doesn't want to let the words in, doesn't want to believe them. He doesn't
After a moment's consideration, Dean looks the stranger right in the eyes and throws him a bitchface worthy of Sam, but the man just smirks and raises his glass as if he's making a damn toast. Fuck. Maybe
“I don’t feel good,” Dean says abruptly, then stands up. “I think I’m gonna go puke. Be right back.” He stumbles out of the living room. Cas hears the front door open and close, which he assumes means that Dean went outside to vomit in the yard. At least he didn’t do it on Cas or the couch.
“I haven’t had time,” Cas retorts. “I’ve been a little busy with, you know, taking care of a newborn.”
"Yeah, okay," Dean says. He sounds dazed, not like himself. Slowly he sinks down into a kitchen chair, still holding the blood-soaked towel.
"If you tell anyone about this," Dean croaks, his face burning, "they will never find your body. Capiche?"
There’s something cold and soft pressing against his forehead. It feels nice. He leans into it and whines when it moves away. He tries to speak, but his tongue is thick and swollen and all that comes out is a hoarse grunt. A deep voice rumbles and a strong hand cups the back of his neck, supporting him as he sips water from a wooden bowl. He keeps his eyes shut tight, not wanting to see who or what is taking care of him. It could be a witch, a forest sprite, a demon. Looking into an evil being’s eyes gives them power over your soul, and Dean of Winchester likes his soul the way it is, thank you very much.
“So? I’m only twenty-four,” Dean retorts. “Age doesn’t have anything to do with being a good parent.”
Castiel James Novak, hottest of all hot nerds, loves him, Dean Winchester, C student, king of fart jokes, and fuckup extraordinaire. He said
“Yes, I see.” Mary’s eyes twinkle as she looks at Castiel, like they’re sharing a secret. “I think I’ll let Cas introduce us.”
He glides down and lands on the red-stained snow. A flick of his feathers and he’s back in human form, staring down at the boy who rescued him all those years ago. Only he’s not a boy anymore. Dean has grown into a young man, one of the most beautiful Castiel has ever seen.
"I think so," Castiel says, looking around helplessly. "There's an obscenely large bed and a lot of horror film posters on the walls."
He pushes his erection between Dean's cheeks, smearing precome over the small of his back, and spanks that perky ass over and over again, a little harder each time, all while sliding his length back and forth along Dean's increasingly wet crack. The pale flesh turns steadily pink, then darkens to a lovely deep red as Castiel rains down blows, enjoying the way Dean’s buttocks jiggle from the impact. He takes himself in hand and rubs the leaking head over Dean’s hot skin, then spanks him with the length of his cock, making Dean gasp and writhe and rut against the mattress. He can almost taste Dean's ecstasy in the air, the sharp mix of pleasure and pain like a burn on his tongue. It's heady and intoxicating and Castiel knows he shouldn't take more, knows he's already passed the limit of what he can safely get away with, but it tastes so good and Dean is so lovely and really, what's the harm in stealing a few more kisses? Dean's already going to be so blissed out by the end of this, he won't know the difference.
“I just worry that they’ll ask a lot of questions about Jack’s real parents.” Cas’ forehead wrinkles up and Dean wants to smooth it out. “We have the records from the hospital, but I don’t know anything about his mom’s health history, or her family’s."
His hair is much lighter than it is now—almost white-blond instead of light brown— but his eyes are the same bright green and his smile is just as captivating. He looks like he was a happy baby.
"Yes," Cas says, shocked at how calm he sounds. "Gabe's extremely immature. Do you know he rented a chocolate fountain and put it in his apartment?"
“I suppose,” Cas says, though he doesn’t sound convinced. “Now, tell me again what I should expect at this ‘shindig.’” He actually uses
“I do not regret my choice,” he says. “But I do regret causing you pain.” He bows his head. “Please forgive me.”
Dean nods and continues sipping. The trick with these conversations is not to push too fast. Establish rapport, but don't draw too much attention to yourself. Make them come to you.
Cas can't get the image out of his head for days. Dean Winchester, flannel-wearing, football-playing, all-American jock, sprawled on his bed like a pinup model, stark naked except for a pair of lacy green panties. Very
Cas lets out a disdainful huff that says he very much doubts it, but he’s quiet until Dean pulls into the parking lot of the botanical gardens. Then he visibly perks up. “I like this place.”
Dean’s throat is closing up, and he’s horrified to feel tears burning in his eyes. He can’t cry in front of Cas. Not now, not ever. He stands up quickly and retreats into the other room.
“Okay, okay.” Dean pauses on his way out the door. “Just, my mom wants to know pretty soon so she knows how much food to make. And if she needs to make up a guest room or something.”
"Oh God, yes," Dean moans, scrambling to unbuckle his belt. "Been wanting to play with it all day. You have such a gorgeous dick, Cas."
Castiel leans forward, eyes shining like two stars. “I promise,” he murmurs. “I will stay by your side. Always.”
Dean can’t take his eyes off the baby. He’s red and wrinkled, sure, but he’s also really fucking cute. He leans forward so he’s directly in the infant’s line of sight. The baby stares up at him with a little squint and his tiny mouth opens in a yawn. Dean actually
"Yes," Cas answers. "I tried to limit myself. I only meant to take a little bit, but…" He licks his lips. "I’ve never tasted anything like you, Dean. You’re absolutely indescribable, and I couldn't resist. These past few weeks, when I had to feed on others, they tasted repulsive. You're the only one I want anymore." He sighs, sounding resigned. “I understand if you need to kill me. There's no possible way you can let me live, after what I did to you."
"Probably." Dean shrugs. "I'll be honest with you, dude. I don't know how much help I'll be. Research isn't my strong area. I mostly just beat the crap out of things until they die."
He parks Baby in the narrow-ass driveway, hauls all the plastic bags out of the passenger seat, and staggers up to the side entrance that leads into the kitchen.
The boys race back into the house, leaving Dean to escort their visitor rather awkwardly up the front steps.
“We figured that the best strategy was to hide Cassie and his troops on Earth,” Gabriel says. “None of those bureaucratic bozos ever come down here if they can help it. They
Dean’s jaw drops when he sees what’s waiting in the kitchen. Of all the scenarios he imagined on the way home, none of them even came
Castiel keeps quiet, recognizing the vulnerability of this moment. Dean isn't looking at him. He's staring into the flames, and it's unclear whether he's even fully aware that he's speaking.
A jumble of emotion flashes through Dean—pity, regret, sorrow. “What was the punishment?” he asks, afraid to hear the answer.
Dean feels a little awkward. Cas just saved him from getting ganked by demons, but apparently Cas is
Cas pauses, taking in the sight of Dean's heaving chest and half-torn shirt with a shit-eating grin on his face. "Sensitive, are we?" Without waiting for an answer, he dives in and starts biting Dean's nipples through the fabric.
“I’m a trickster,” Gabriel replies, snapping his fingers. A row of Mr. Potato Head dolls appear on Zachariah’s desk. “It’s part of the job description.”
Dean’s curiosity finally gets the better of him. He ventures up to the table and peeks into the bundle of blankets. “Holy shit,” he breathes. “How old is this kid?”
Cas doesn't know what to do. All of his instincts are screaming at him to protect Jack, but Luke is blocking the only exit, and something tells him that it's a bad idea to make any sudden moves. Luke might be drugged out of his mind right now, but he's still bigger than Cas, and probably faster and stronger too. He could easily overpower them and hurt Jack in the process.
Dean can’t breathe. He’s suffocating, pinned under that intense gaze, but he doesn’t feel powerless. He feels like he could do anything— lift a car, fly to the moon, kiss Cas.
Rows and rows of women's panties, of every possible cut and color, line the drawer in a shimmering sea of silk, satin, and lace. Castiel doesn't know much about lingerie, but he suspects that they're expensive and high quality, just like everything else Dean owns.
Dean recalls having a conversation, in this very kitchen, about how Cas needed to have more fun. Christ, that feels like a lifetime ago. Has it really only been three months since they became co-parents?
“Well.” Dean coughs. “We don’t… really call it that, but… yeah. If they decide they want to commit to a long-term thing, then people usually spend a lot of time getting to know each other. To make sure they’re compatible.”
Cas’ voice cracks, and Dean feels the lump in his throat swell as he realizes Cas is getting choked up, too. “And when I think about you leaving, I… I can’t, Dean. I can’t imagine my life without you. Jack loves you. So much. And I…” Dean holds his breath. “I love you, too.”
Castiel is pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food— gourmet burgers, crispy frites with garlic aioli (which is apparently just a fancy word for mayonnaise), and the most delicious key lime pie he's ever tasted. He hasn't eaten anything since breakfast, and he wolfs down everything within ten minutes.
"Are you all right?" Cas asks. He looks thinner than the last time Dean saw him. His cheeks are hollow, there are dark circles under his eyes, and all traces of his wicked, sly humor seem to have disappeared.
Dean emerges from the ER twenty minutes later, his hand wrapped in a cocoon of white gauze. There's a grouchy expression on his face, but it immediately softens when he sees Cas and Jack.
Sam gives Dean one of his best bitch faces. “Gee, I don’t know. Maybe because you’re madly in love with Cas and inviting him and his baby to stay with you for three weeks is going to make your metaphorical ovaries explode?”
seem quite fascinated by my name at the time. If I recall correctly, you said it was 'awesome.'" He uses air quotes for the last word.
wants to feel those wings. Trace them with his fingertips, taste them with his tongue, feel them flutter and tremble under his touch...
Earning that E rating in this chapter... well, technically we already earned it, but now we’re REALLY going to earn it ;)
Castiel scrambles off the monstrously large mattress, nearly falling on the floor because the sheets are so slippery, and stands up on trembling legs. How did he end up in someone else's apartment? Was he drugged? Kidnapped?
that rattles the window panes, and all the air in Cas' lungs rushes out and his knees turn to jelly. Dean came back, thank God, thank God—
"I don't know where this insolence is coming from," John says softly, "but you better be damn sure it doesn't happen again. You're suspended until further notice. Go pack your shit up and get out of my sight. Sam, my office. Now."
absolutely covered in blood splatter, which means making a trip down to Restoration to see Crowley, which means getting a fifteen-minute lecture on why you shouldn't let hunters take books into the field. Castiel decides he will deal with that particular issue tomorrow.
Cas moves so fast it's a blur. He's on Dean in less than a second, caging him with his arms and staring down at him with undisguised lust. "How attached are you to this shirt?" he purrs, nodding down at Dean's faded AC/DC tee.
Dean barks out a humorless laugh. "I did at first. Kinda lost its appeal once I started to see just how much bad stuff is really out there."
"Yeah, but…" Dean shakes his head. "Ripping someone's heart out… that's a whole other level of crazy."
Cas never thought he’d feel comfortable in a fraternity, but over the past year, Dean and his housemates have made it a surprisingly welcoming place to hang out. Benny, Victor, Cesar, and Ash are all nice people, if a little loud and raunchy with their humor. Cole is the only one who doesn't seem to like him, but then again, he doesn't seem to like anybody, so Castiel doesn't feel too offended.
Two days into break, Cas is sitting in the living room with Jack, watching him wriggle around on his playmat, when he hears a loud clatter in the kitchen, followed by a string of curse words.
He steps inside the walk-in closet and starts rummaging around for clothes. White sweaters, linen pants, beige polos, suede blazers... it's a wardrobe far better suited to an East Coast trust fund baby than a professional monster hunter.
Behind them, Sam snickers. Dean’s face turns pink. “Look, Mom, it’s a baby,” he says, pointing at Jack.
Hawaiian Shirt Guy is rummaging around in their pantry, apparently unaware that he just did something physically impossible. “Aha!” he says after a moment, and pulls out the tin of sugar cookies. “Perfect.” He pops open the tin, takes out a frosted reindeer, and bites its head off.
“I don’t care if I ever remember who I am,” Cas says softly. “I’m happy now. With you. You and Jack and Ben.” He pauses, nodding to himself. “I don’t want to remember anything else.”
a little offended," Dean says, glaring at Sam. "I'm your big brother. You don't think I'm guardian material?"
Whoever invented mornings should be taken out back and shot, Dean thinks as a ray of bright sunshine stabs him in the eyeballs. He groans and smashes his face back into the pillow, but now that he's awake, it's harder to ignore the uncomfortable feeling of dried sweat and jizz clinging to his skin. He desperately needs a shower.
As he's staring at the statue, the hair on the back of Dean's neck suddenly prickles. Someone's watching him. Cautiously, he turns his head and scans the room. Nothing seems to have changed. The pool game's still going, and Jukebox Guy is now passed out at a table in the far corner. Dean's gaze slowly drifts to the other end of the bar. Two middle-aged dudes are chatting with Manuel in rapid-fire Spanish, and next to them, sitting directly in Dean's line of sight…
Well, he can’t really say no to that. Dean shuffles over to the couch and sinks down next to Cas, a blush rising in his cheeks as he stares at the floor.
"So do you." Dean huffs out a laugh, chest and shoulders heaving as he tries to catch his breath. "You're one hell of a kisser."
“I see.” Castiel accepts the boys’ gifts politely, then stands there with his arms full of Marvel bedding, as though he’s not sure what to do next. To be honest, Dean isn’t either.
Dean sits down on a rickety barstool and taps his knuckles against the wood. The bartender looks up. "¿Qué quieres?" he grunts, clearly peeved at being interrupted from playing Candy Crush or whatever the fuck.
"You got it." He downs the rest of his shot as Manuel turns away to check on the other patrons. Once the man's back is turned, Dean takes a closer look at the decor.
"I could go with you," he says. "To the doctor's appointment. If you want. Sometimes it helps to have another person there to take notes, or whatever."
other irritating qualities, Dean is incredibly clumsy and knocks things over with alarming frequency. He's broken three of Castiel's possessions already, including a priceless brass telescope used during the Men of Letters' first polar expedition in 1823. Castiel
, he tells himself. Then they can get up, change their clothes, maybe shower. Mmm. Cas in the shower, naked and wet… that’s a nice visual.
They go to the park and Dean insists that they get on the swings. Cas refuses at first, but when nobody else seems to look at them with anything other than mild amusement, he cautiously sits down in one and starts swaying back and forth. It’s kind of fun.
“And there’s Dean with baby Sam at the hospital.” Mary smiles down at the faded photograph. Four-year-old Dean is sitting in a chair, a huge grin on his chubby face, sneakered feet dangling off the floor. Sam is just a wrinkled red face poking out from a blanket in Dean's lap. “He was
"This has got to be the ultimate exhibitionist kink," Cas says, and Dean lets out a startled laugh. "Watching someone else put you on display."
The boy's name is Dean, and he's been tracking the wolf for nearly a month. That's all Castiel is able to get out of him as they wait in line at the tamale stand. Castiel doesn't normally eat human food— it all tastes like ash to him— but sometimes it's necessary to keep up appearances. And with Dean's sweet scent filling his nostrils, he's able to eat all of his tamales without gagging or making a face.
Mary puts her arm around Dean’s shoulders and gives him a little squeeze. “Every time he calls, it’s Cas this and Cas that. I’ve started calling it the Castiel Report in my head.”
“I’ll be up in a sec to tuck you in,” Dean calls, then turns back to his unexpected guest. “Whoa, hey!”
Should he ask Cas to move in with him after graduation? Would that be weird? What if Cas decides that he and Jack need a place of their own? Or worse, what if he decides he doesn't want to take care of Jack anymore? The thought sends a cold tingle of fear through Dean. He doesn’t want this to end. He loves coming home to Cas and Jack every day, loves curling up with Jack on the couch while Cas studies or provides snarky commentary on whatever they’re watching. He loves it when Jack does something new, like lifting his head or making a funny sound. And he finds himself fantasizing about the future, even though it’s incredibly stupid and he’s setting himself up for disappointment. They haven’t heard a word from Luke since he left Jack, but the threat of him coming back is always there, an ominous thing hovering over them like a stormcloud.
On the fourth night, Cas falls asleep during a Christmas movie marathon and jolts awake to find himself smushed against Dean’s shoulder, a thread of drool hanging from his mouth. Mortified, he jumps up and mumbles that he should go check on Jack, not daring to look at Dean’s expression because it’s probably one of disgust.
"You bring it out of me." Cas starts to roll his hips, head thrown back, eyes half closed. "First time I saw you, I wanted to bend you over my desk and fuck you open."
He crouches, spreads his wings, and takes to the air. Dean clings desperately to his shoulders, eyes squeezed shut, and tries not to puke.
He's currently crouched on the roof of a "massage parlor," which is an amusing euphemism for a place where old, unattractive men pay young, attractive women to pleasure them sexually. Normally this type of business is Castiel's equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet, but nobody smells even remotely tempting tonight. He hasn't eaten properly in days and he can feel his body weakening, but he can't bring himself to care. Existence on this planet seems rather pointless if it doesn't include Dean.
“I know a lot of this stuff is too big for him right now,” Mary says, “and the boys might want to keep a few of their old things, but this should be enough to get you started. And I’m going to put out a call to all my friends and neighbors when I get back. I’m sure they have stuff, too.”
“Fuck off,” Dean says amiably, pushing Cas up the stairs and through the front door. “You like pizza, Cas?”
Dean's getting a headache. He just spent twenty minutes getting chewed out by some pompous ass named Crowley for getting blood spatter on a book. Before that, Kevin from IT came down to fix the computer system and wanted technical information Dean had absolutely no idea how to locate. And before that, a
Silence falls. The old baseboard heaters pop and crackle. Jack's making snuffling noises in his sleep. Cas is heavy and warm against his side, smelling like clean laundry and lavender soap, his t-shirt soft underneath Dean’s palm. They don't have anything to do tomorrow. No homework or chores or other people to consider. Just them and Jack in this big old house.
"But what kind of truth?" Castiel frowns, trying to remember the exact words Rowena recited. "We already know a lot about each other. I, for example, know that you have a rather intense fetish for wearing women's un—"
"How did you end up all the way down there?" Dean demands, lowering the knife. "You just decide to take a fucking field trip?"
to. Even if I could just kiss him and hold his hand and fall asleep with him on the couch, that would be
“You are letting someone else feed Jack,” Mary repeats, “and you are sleeping in your own room tonight. For at least seven hours. Don’t make me use my mom voice.”
“I remember what happened,” Cas whispers. “Before I fell.” His voice cracks. “I’m so sorry, Dean. I never should have brought you into this.”
Dean insists that Cas stay at Sigma Zeta instead of going back to his dorm, reasoning that they have plenty of space now that everybody's gone for winter break. Cas only protests a little bit. His single room is not much bigger than a walk-in closet and he can't quite imagine trying to take care of a baby in such cramped quarters, so he eventually agrees to stay here, at least for the holidays.
"Second," Dean admits, lowering his gaze. "First was in high school. Didn't do much, just made out and... kinda dry humped."
Dean wakes slowly, his brain sluggish and foggy. The first thing he sees is the man who rescued him. He’s sitting up against the far wall of the room, mouth slightly open, snoring softly. Dean stares at him for a while. He doesn’t look very old, maybe twenty five or thirty. What is he doing, living out here in the woods all alone? Perhaps he’s on a spiritual journey? That would make sense, especially if he’s a healer or a seer.
“Hey, I do my homework.” Dean points at him with a spatula. “But I also have fun. You need to have more fun, Cas.”
Cas rolls his eyes, but he's smiling as he takes Dean's hand. "He's your kid, too. You have the same appetite."
"Dean." The word is almost a sigh as Cas' hands tighten on Dean's shoulders. "I should tell you, I'm not very experienced—"
That doesn’t help in the slightest. Dean shakes his head. “I am sorry,” he says. “It seems you are right. I can’t remember.”
"They are." Cas shifts in his seat. "I, um…" He pauses, clears his throat. "I had to try on a few other pairs before I found those. I put everything back, though."
Mary arrives at six o’clock the following evening in a sturdy-looking pickup truck, and Dean and Sam both immediately rush outside to greet her. Cas stays inside with Jack where it’s warm, but Gabe goes out to help unload the truck, which is piled high with bags, boxes, and various baby equipment, including a bouncy seat and a stroller.
"Like this," he whispers, hooking a thumb into the waistband and pulling the panties down over his hard, weeping cock. "I like when it's tight around my balls." He rolls the elastic down and fits it snugly underneath the testicles, making Cas groan with pleasure.
“Okay, that’s it.” Gabriel stands up. “If I have to hear any more mushy stuff, I’m going to be sick. You want to stay here as a human? Fine. No skin off my nose. But for the love of all that’s holy, will you
"That's an understatement." Meg snorts. "Which is why I keep telling you to fuck his brains out. It would save everyone a lot of time and therapy."
“Attention, everyone!” Charlie’s standing onstage, microphone in hand and a huge grin on her face, which usually means she’s got something evil up her sleeve.
"The pledge also says that we have a responsibility to help those in need," Cesar says. "Castiel needs help, so we're helping him. End of story."
Gabriel sighs. “The short version is that nine months ago, our big brother knocked up some nice Catholic girl, the nice Catholic girl died from complications giving birth, and Luke’s now saddled with a baby he is in no way prepared to take care of.”
"Just… do your best, alright?" Castiel says desperately when they reach the elevators. "Meg should be able to answer any questions."
Dean opens his mouth, but no words come out. Then he figures he probably doesn’t need to say anything, so he kisses Cas instead. This turns out to be a very good decision, because it makes Cas practically melt against him and start making those little moaning sounds again, his grip tightening on Dean’s knee. Instinctively Dean takes Cas’ hand and guides it up his thigh to rest on his hip, then wriggles closer and wraps both arms around Cas’ waist. Perfect.
Castiel might have depleted his supply of magic, but there are other ways of healing. He goes through his store of roots and herbs, selecting those that fight off fever and infection. He grinds some of them into a paste and applies it to Dean’s wounds, trying not to stare at the beautiful lines and curves of his body, at the thousands of freckles painting his skin. He boils other herbs into strong tea and makes Dean drink it, though the human sputters and makes a face of disgust when it touches his tongue.
"What's the matter with you?" Sam barks at him. "You broke formation, you didn't signal, then you wander off and get cornered? Are you drunk or something?"
Once Cas gets his breathing under control, he steps out of the car, collects the still-snoozing baby from the backseat, and walks through the sky tunnel that connects the parking garage with the hospital. From there, he enters another maze, this one consisting of long corridors, sliding glass doors, color-coded arrows, and endless wall directories. Everything smells like antiseptic and it makes his nose itch. A few people smile at Jack when they pass by, but Cas is too distracted and worried to acknowledge them.
He edges into the room, feeling weirdly shy all of a sudden. His earlier burst of confidence has faded and doubt is starting to take its place. This is a pretty stupid idea, all things considered. Cas’ real family is going to show up any day now, and then he’ll have no reason to stay.
"That's right," Cesar says, still glaring at Cole. "I'm a homo, I'm a queer, I'm a goddamn fairy princess. So if you think people like me don't deserve to be here, then you can go fuck yourself, because I
"You're welcome. I should—" Cas gestures at the door. "I'll just leave this here." He tosses the hoodie at Dean, then backs away, face still flaming. "I'm sorry I barged in, I should have knocked."
The front door opens and slams shut. Someone stomps their feet, obviously knocking snow off their boots. Then Cole appears in the doorway, a deep scowl on his face.
He doesn't really remember the walk up to Castiel's apartment, either. His body is thrumming with lust and adrenaline, and it takes all his self-control not to jump Castiel's bones as they climb two flights of stairs. The way those leather pants hug his round, firm ass should be
Apparently Cas isn’t as casual as he thinks, because on the fourth day he walks by the house, one of the guys calls out to him.
“Cas!” Dean crouches down. “What’s wrong?” Cas doesn’t answer, just keeps holding his head, eyes squeezed shut like he has the world’s most terrible migraine. Dean looks up at Gabriel. “What did you do to him?”
Castiel throws back another shot and slams the glass back down on the sticky bartop. Usually he can find a decent meal in places like this, but not today. Not for the past few weeks, actually. And he's pretty sure he knows the reason.
"Guess you really have been hunting for a long time," Dean says, a little awed. "How old are you, anyway?"
Castiel jerks and lets out a startled "mmmph!" but it only takes a few seconds before he's practically melting into the kiss, parting his lips and slipping his tongue inside Dean's mouth. One of his hands moves up to cup the back of Dean's neck, while the other travels down to rest at his hip, and
many levels. He jerks his hand away as if he's been burned and turns away from the mirror, inwardly cringing. He should be figuring out what the heck is going on, not fondling his coworker's intimate parts! He's such a pervert!
Castiel moves the phone away from his ear and stares at the screen. "That can't be," he says loudly. "You sound nothing like him."
Cas is impressed that she recognized it. "I was," he answers. "We've been watching a lot of that lately. It seems to calm Jack down."
“Well, for the record, I don’t care.” Dean starts heading for the kitchen. “Go get your study on, Samsquatch.”
"Clearly." Cas purses his (or rather, Dean's) lips. It's weird to see himself in such deep thought. "I suppose we'll have to make a plan once we get inside, then."
Dean should argue. This was his hunt, technically. Cas was just helping out. He needs to square his shoulders and face this head-on like a man.
Look, he’s only human, okay? He has needs. Most of the time he’s too tired and stressed for the thought of sex to even cross his mind, but lately? Now that he’s got someone else sharing the load? Yeah, that’s freeing up his mind for all
His breath catches as he looks into a pair of intense blue eyes. The man is dressed in black leather from head to toe, his dark hair is fucked up in the best possible way, and he's staring at Dean like he wants to eat him, tracing his lower lip with one long, elegant finger.
"I hated the way he treated you," Cas murmurs back, a hint of a growl in his voice. "He should show you some respect." His grip on Dean tightens as he yanks him closer, long hard lines of his body pressing up against Dean's own. Dean's not ashamed to admit that he whimpers a little bit. Cas being all righteous and angry is one thing, but manhandling him like this? That's a whole new level of hot.
an alarm clock. He uses his phone for setting alarms, like a normal person. But there's an honest-to-God antique alarm clock on the nightstand, complete with ticking hands, stubby feet, and a bronze bell.
Yes. He does want Dean. Castiel has never felt so bereft, so unsatisfied. There's a physical ache inside his chest, a hunger that gnaws at him constantly. He wants his beautiful boy, but the beautiful boy doesn't want him back.
“Okay,” Dean cuts in loudly, nudging Cas towards the dining area. “Why don’t you go grab us a table, bud?”
He does not think about Cas’ soulful blue eyes, or those big nerdy glasses he wears when he’s reading, or that cute little squint he makes when he doesn’t understand a pop culture reference. He doesn’t think about Cas explaining stuff in his deep, sexy voice, or running his hand through his sexy hair, or wearing one of those sexy waistcoats that cinch tight around his midriff.
Saturday morning drifts by in a blissful haze. Dean gets up early and makes pancakes, something he hasn't done in months. Half an hour later Cas stumbles sleepily into the kitchen with Jack, and wonder of wonders, Dean actually gets to give them
“Thank you,” Cas says, because he doesn’t know what else to say. He really wants this brainless, "no-homo" jock to leave him alone.
“Because,” Dean says, starting up Baby’s engine with a satisfying rumble, “sometimes you need just a break from the kids.”
"Were you expecting a medal?" Dean sneers. "Get outta here. I don't wanna look at your stupid face anymore."
"Easy. I can be you, no problem." Dean deepens his voice even more and puts on a pinched, dour expression. "'Hi, I'm Castiel. I like books better than people and I'm allergic to fun."
"I should, should I?" Cas sounds mildly amused. "Dean Winchester, spoiled rich boy and lifestyle coach."
"I'm gonna kill him," Gabriel snarls that evening, pacing up and down the living room. "I will kill him with my bare hands.
Manuel places both palms flat on the counter and leans close to Dean. "I don't want you talking about that shit in here, man," he says, face hard. "It's bad for business and I don't want to scare my customers. ¿Comprendes?"
They kiss until Cas is practically rutting against Dean's thigh, letting out little pathetic whines. Dean's pretty much losing his mind too, so he pulls away from Cas and looks up at him.
"Get back!" he snarls at the nearest vamp-wolf. It pays no attention, just runs a long blackened tongue around its lipless mouth as it advances on him. This close, Castiel can see every revolting detail— yellow bloodshot eyes, long claw-like fingernails, rotting fangs dripping with blood-tinged saliva.
Cas doesn’t appear bothered; in fact, he hardly seems to have heard their exchange. His attention is entirely on the baby, who’s grabbed hold of his finger and is now gnawing on it enthusiastically.
“No idea,” Gabe says. “But he’s still red and gross-looking, so I’m guessing he got squeezed out pretty recently. I didn’t really feel like asking Luke for details.”
The plane wobbles in the air, and Castiel's stomach wobbles with it. "Sam," he says urgently, "I have to tell you something."
"Hey, pretty boy," one of them taunts. It's wearing an elderly Latina woman who's barely five feet tall, but Dean knows that size doesn't mean squat when it comes to demons. Sweet little Abuela could pick him up and throw him ten feet, no problem. The other two look like they might be from the club down the street— they're both wearing skinny jeans and V-neck shirts and one of them has streaks of gold glitter on his cheeks.
He pulls Cas behind a stack of shipping containers. It's dark and quiet back here, the hustle and bustle of the hangar reduced to a soft background hum. Cas leans against a large wooden crate, gripping his knee with one hand, face drawn and pinched.
"Kill him," Abuela says in a bored tone. She and the others start to close in, flanking Dean from all sides. Dean widens his stance and his hand tightens around the handle of his knife. If he's dying tonight, then he's gonna go out with a bang.
"Finger," Dean says, still in that far-away voice. "I was slicing oranges. Knife slipped. I don't know how it happened, it just… did."
Jack cries. A lot. Usually Cas can get him to calm down with a few gentle back-pats and bounces, but today those are not working. Neither is changing his diaper, or feeding him, or anything else. He screams and screams and screams until Cas’ ears are ringing and his head is throbbing.
to be greeting people at the door, but she seems more interested in picking her fingernails with a pocketknife.
“I’ve served Heaven for eons,” he says. “I witnessed the birth of humanity, but I never actually spent time with humans. Now that I have, I’ve learned that they have much to teach us. About compassion. About joy, and sacrifice. And love.”
Rather than asking all five of them to drive out to her house, Dean’s mom decides that it’s much easier if she comes to Madison for Christmas instead. Castiel is both relieved and touched that she would make such an accommodation for someone she’s never met before. He’s never been close with either of his parents, so he’s very curious to meet this Mary Winchester. Dean starts bouncing off the walls with excitement when he learns his mom is coming here, so Cas reasons that she can’t be too awful if Dean likes her that much.
"Hey!" Dean yells, fear and anger overtaking him in equal measure. "You don't get to just walk away, buddy!"
Which is why one morning after class, he decides to treat himself to a much-needed jerkoff session. All the guys are either in class or at practice right now, and Cas is downstairs napping with Jack, so it's the perfect opportunity.
does. It's a cufflink shaped like a Star Trek captain's badge. Dean had specially ordered a pair for Charlie's wedding last year, and he was sure he'd lost one during the long night of dancing and getting blackout drunk. But here it is, sitting in a hex bag along with a bunch of other witchy stuff.
"I think," Castiel says slowly, reaching out a hand to still Dean's nervous fidgeting, "that you should do what makes you happy." He pauses, choosing his next words carefully. "I don't think you're very happy working for your dad."
Cas smiles and plants a gentle kiss on Dean’s cheek. “I’m sure you’ll survive. All the guys come back Sunday night. We can spend some time alone after that.”
pissed about it." She laughs a little. "He keeps yelling at the residents to leave him alone because they're not 'real' doctors."
"Zero regrets," Gabe declares, stuffing his mouth full of peanut M&Ms. "I hope the son of a bitch reads it."
"Hey." Dean's soft, deep voice pulls him out of his racing thoughts. "You've got your worry face on." He wriggles closer and wraps his arms around Castiel's waist. "Whatcha thinking about?"
He shifts on the sofa, trying to put a little space between them, opens the heavy tome, and begins to read.
"Okay," Dean mumbles, looking down at his hands. He hears the door open and close, then falls back against the mattress with a groan. Fuck. Everything had been going so well. Now Cas thinks he's a fucking perv, no matter how much he tried to convince Dean otherwise. If Dean ever had a shot at being with Cas, it's long gone now.
"Of the lesson." Rowena gives him an infuriatingly smug smile. "Do you think I planted that hex bag just for fun? My spells
Dean groggily lifts his head off the pillow and squints at the alarm clock. It's a little past six in the morning.
"Thanks, Dean," Cas says, giving him a soft smile, and Dean immediately feels better. Jesus. He's so gone on this man, it's not even funny.
A pause, then Sam opens the door. One look at his expression tells Dean something is super off. “What’s going on?” he demands.
Castiel hums in agreement, resisting the urge to lay his arm across the back of the bench so he can wrap Dean in a pseudo-embrace. It's taking all his self-control not to straddle the man's lap and start tongue-fucking his mouth.
“Annnnd we’ve officially crossed into pathetic territory,” Charlie says. Dean can almost hear her eye roll. “C’mon, get up. Let’s dance it off.”
“Okay, settle down everybody,” Charlie bellows over the noise. “There’s plenty more where that came from! And remember guys, it’s all for charity, so step up, don’t be shy! The more we get, the more we raise for the food pantry!”
Dean ignores him and carries Mary over to the corner table Cas has staked out. Sam and Eileen trail behind him, signing a conversation too fast for Dean to follow.
He doesn't crash the car. He makes it all the way to UW Hospital, through the confusing maze of parking garages, and into an empty corner stall without incident. Then he turns off the engine and sits there trembling for a minute or two. Jack is quiet, which isn't surprising— he almost always falls asleep during car rides, no matter how short.
Dean shrugs. He's found a loose thread in the sheets and has started winding it around his finger. "Kinda wanted to hear your take on it first," he mumbles.
Dean doesn’t seem to expect an answer, though, because he keeps talking. “You definitely look like an English major, dude. You’re all fancy.” He gestures at Cas’ upper body. “I love your vest.”
"Seriously?" Ash squints at Cole like he's never seen him before. "I knew you were a dick, Trenton, but I didn't think you were
"Sorry," Cas says, not sounding sorry in the least. "I can't help it. I've been thinking about them all day."
Cas' eyes are dark with lust, and he seems to be having trouble parsing Dean's words. "Um." He licks his lips. "Fifteen minutes, maybe?"
"Dean," Cas breathes, nosing his way up Dean's neck. "My sweet boy. I would never hurt you. Please know that."
"Turn over, my lovely," he croons, and Dean obeys instantly. His cock is angry red and weeping, his balls are tight, and a gorgeous blush spreads all the way from his face to his sternum. His nipples are covered in bite marks and there's an absolutely blissful expression on his face. So trusting, so exposed and vulnerable.
Cas grins at the elder Winchester brother, who’s hiding behind the cushion again. “Don’t be embarrassed, Dean. It shows you’re a very compassionate person.”
The raw, wrecked sound Dean lets out in response nearly breaks Castiel's resolve. "Look at me, sweet boy," he orders, lightly pinching Dean's thigh. Dean opens those beautiful green eyes and gazes up at him. "What's your safeword?"
It’s nearly midnight before Missouri puts on her coat. “It’s gonna be rough,” she warns. “You boys should take it in shifts so y’all don’t fall asleep standing up.”
"Ohhh," Castiel moans, "fuck Dean, you're so perfect, come for me, come for me, my sweet—" Then his own orgasm hits and he thrusts up into Dean with a howl of pleasure.
Once they arrive at Dean's apartment, Dean insists on ordering from some pretentious-sounding restaurant, but since he's offered to pay, Cas can't exactly object. When it arrives, they spread all the takeout containers over a coffee table that probably cost more than Cas' monthly salary and dig in.
4:56 PM: The library door creaks open, and Castiel's jaw tightens as he catches sight of the absolute
"Well, I'm not sure." Dean rubs the back of his neck. "My brother and I ran into something we'd never seen before on our last job. I was hoping you could use your big nerdy brain to help identify it."
Over the next day or two, he catches himself pretending that he and Dean are together— when they take Jack for a walk, when they drive out to Mineral Point to visit Mary, when they find new ways to make Jack laugh. He daydreams about the future. Nothing specific, just vague, pleasant images of him and Dean raising Jack, maybe in an apartment or even a house. And with those ridiculous fantasies comes the not-so-ridiculous realization that he doesn't want to give Jack up. Cas wants to keep Jack safe and whole and happy for the rest of his life, even if he has to do it by himself.
Then Castiel rises to his feet, smoothly, almost robotically, and that’s when Dean starts to think that maybe this guy isn’t exactly like other people. No one falls off the roof of a two-story house without getting a scratch. It’s not natural.
Dean sits up too, annoyed by the sudden loss of his Cas-pillow. "The guy's a total douchebag. I've worked with him for years, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that he only cares about himself. If he's putting the moves on you, it's only because you have something he wants."
hate you, okay? Jack loves you. He loves you so much, Cas." He bites back the rest of what he wants to say, what he's wanted to say for weeks now. Instead, he sits down on the floor and pulls Cas into his arms. Cas doesn't resist. He melts into the embrace, and for a few seconds they just sit there, rocking back and forth, Jack still crying behind the closed door.
"All right, all right!" Dean cuts in, shooing them away from Cas, who's starting to look overwhelmed by all the attention. "Anybody who wants to hold him needs to wash their hands first. And y'all better have had your flu shots and every other vaccine under the sun, because if
"Douchebag," Castiel mutters, but when he opens the top drawer of Dean's dresser, he realizes he may have to reevaluate that assessment.
Cas slides his own arms around Dean's waist. "Very well," he says, amused. "But once I get you home, sweet boy, I'm taking all the time in the world."
"I want you to spank my ass," Dean says in a rush. "Spank me until I'm red and stinging and I can't feel anything except your hand. Please," he remembers to add.
His insides churn at the thought of picking up those tiny, lifeless forms and throwing them on a pyre. Adult victims are one thing, but kids… Dean doesn't know if he has the balls.
Cas looks up and sees a familiar pair of green eyes. “Oh,” he says stupidly. “I know you. You're Dean."
Any chances that he's hallucinating or dreaming disappear as soon as Dean sees his reflection. The face staring back at him belongs, without a doubt, to Dr. Castiel Novak. And
“Just because you were always picked last in gym class doesn’t mean he will.” Dean tickles Jack’s feet, making him squeal.
At this point Dean would jump off the fucking Chrysler building if Cas told him to. He quickly unzips and wriggles out of his jeans while Cas unlaces his boots and tosses them over his shoulder. Then he's down to just his underwear, and Cas' eyes rake over the rest of his body, an appreciative hum sounding low in his throat.
idea how much this is gonna fuck up our lives?" Cole demands. "That kid's gonna be screaming and crying all day and all night. None of us are gonna get any sleep. How are we supposed to get work done? What if we wanna bring chicks over?"
Jody narrows her eyes. “Dean Winchester, you’d better not be thinking what I think you’re thinking.”
“Hold up,” Dean protests. “It’s snowing out there, I ain’t letting you drive Baby on slippery roads.”
Dean gazes down at the baby, a lump forming in his throat as he thinks about not seeing Jack every day, not getting to hold him or make him laugh or watch him grow up. It's so painful he can hardly stand it.
“All right.” Missouri claps her hands. “First things first.” She stands up and beckons. “I’m gonna show y’all how to make formula.”
He stares down at an unfamiliar tanned chest, at a faint dark line of hair trailing down an equally tanned belly and disappearing inside a pair of blue boxer briefs. His pecs and shoulders are covered in beautifully intricate tattoos, and huge, strong hands are running up and down the length of his torso, unconsciously mapping the new terrain.
Jack continues to shriek, his face beet red and his tiny fists clenched. Cas feels like he's slowly going insane.
"Jesus Christ," Dean gasps, a fresh burst of arousal flooding his body at the image of getting railed by the dick he's currently stroking. "You can't say shit like that."
It's like every dirty fantasy he's ever had, only better— he's got control of Cas' hands, he can do exactly what he's wanted Cas to do to him for years. And Cas can feel what he feels, can experience the sensation of soft fabric on his most tender parts, maybe understand why Dean likes it, how sexy it makes him feel.
until he can't resist temptation any longer. He slowly pulls off his boxers and starts ghosting his fingertips over the soft curve of that beautiful cock, shivering as the cool air caresses his (Castiel's) sensitive skin, watching it slowly lengthen and harden in his palm.
A brief pause. Then a smirk spreads over Cas' face. "I wear women's underwear," he says, his voice suddenly a sultry purr. "Including
Decision made, he sets off for home, unable to keep from smiling down at the bird snuggled against his chest.
set in some handwavey au where cas goes human and him and dean are happily in love. I’d be more specific but again. 19 eps in. just use your ~imagination~
Because yeah, Dean was a little bit silly about it sometimes. This entire exercise was proof of that. But that didn’t stop the fear he felt from being very real, and the near-constant teasing he’d faced over the issue hadn’t made him any more inclined to give flying a go, especially when he felt he couldn’t trust his friends to take him and his boundaries around it seriously.
to fantastic beasts and where to find them because a Hannibal author that wrote an au i really liked and then mentioned a few others in their a/n that I wanted to check out
For another, it never changed. His soulmate had never gone by a nickname, apparently, or if they had, they’d never identified with it enough for it to overtake their full name in their mind. And yeah, some people went by their full names for all their lives, god knows Dean hadn’t exactly gotten particularly attached to any nicknames throughout his life, but Dean’s name was short. Easy. There weren’t exactly that many nickname options available to him.
this exists purely because i thought it would be funny as fuck if they ran into someone who knew jimmy while on their honeymoon. like seriously the panick™ they would feel
im making my current house in the sims 4 and im highkey worried i wont finish before we fully move and I'm able to double check stuff. i started a month or so ago but barely worked on it bc idk mental health whack and now I'm like 'ahhhhhhhhhhhhh'
It was moments like this, Dean knew, that would make up his personal heaven, were he to ever end up there.
Cas paused for a second, and in that second Dean felt his anxieties skyrocket. These worries were shut down when Castiel started speaking, however.
“Didn’t want to go another week missing your chance to ask?” Cas asked, and Dean nodded. “I know the feeling, don’t worry. I’d love to go on a coffee date with you.”
a soulmate bond, Cas had found himself falling just as deeply for Dean. It comes across in some of the bright, gummy smiles he sends Dean’s way, as well as in the flicker of annoyance that will occasionally cross his face when Dean winks at a waitress while they’re travelling.
“I mean, I could be happier? Look, Cas, I don’t spend a lot of time sitting around and contemplating all the ways my life is horribly unfulfilled outside of hunting. I kinda just… live my life. Have you been ignoring me in some misguided attempt to make my life happier?”
i have watched. like 10 eps of spn. like I've read a lotta fic these past few days, but still. 10 eps. don't judge me for this.
He just wished they had any clue as to who the fuck it was that had rescued him, given Sam was no help.
apparently they've also been whack when they are active (eg a lot of that group were mods for the general server, the owner was not— one of the people removed a channel without asking, then when the owner added it back, another one (who happens to be my ex best friend) removed it again then was really evasive when asked why) and it's just all fucking strange vibes
She finished digging it out of the drawer they were apparently stored in, and handed it across with a pleasant smile.
“Not… exactly? I don’t know if I’ve talked about this with you before, but despite angels and their vessels not requiring sleep in the traditional sense, the human’s that we possess are still aware and taking in information that their mind’s need to process. This means they go through periods akin to REM sleep, where they aren’t fully conscious of the outside world and the actions the angel possessing them is undertaking.”
“Will you at least get a message down to Sammy? I don’t even wanna know what he’s thinking right now.”
“Uh, maybe the fact that I stopped having soulmate dreams years ago, right after we met in that barn for the first time?”
Cas thinks he’s fine, at first, even with the steady burn that’s been growing in his chest over the past couple of weeks. He’s just getting sick, his body no longer knowing how to handle it without the aid of grace pumping through his veins, and it’s not something he should worry the Winchesters over. Even if the burn just seems to be getting worse, not better, even though he’d have thought his immune system would’ve kicked into high gear by now.
This is a vague concept I was kicking around my head when I got back home from my holiday with my friends lol, although obvs it’s slightly different vibes. I’m glad I didn’t write it then because a) I l o v e resurrectionist!dean and b) I would’ve had no clue what to write today lmaooooooo
Because either Dean didn’t dream of him, had some human soulmate that God picked out for him when he was born — someone
That was, largely, how all of their interactions went for the first couple of weeks Dean was travelling. He ignored the voice in the back of his mind saying that it was pointless, that he was no closer to convincing Castiel to help him, that every minute he spent not moving forwards was decreasing his chances of getting Sammy back, safe and alive.
(I actually did a lil bit of writing outside of this so i genuinely did meet my goal today as,djk,dfmgh)
so i retitled all of these to procrastinate uni work today. i didn't mean for the [char/ship] & [vague concept] to become the format (like the first one was just 'hmst how to summarise differently') but it did and I'm not complaining. i made myself giggle a little as i tried to fit stuff into that format and honestly that's all that matters. hopefully this will make it easier for all of us zdxfhzl.a. however some of the summaries are v boring now bc they essentially repeat the title, so I may rework them a lil at some point. as is i reworked the ones for the aus to have a lil more detail. All the au chaps have the same titles for ease of use. except the teacher dean ones but there's a clear theme to those (it's bc the au's focus changes lol)
had been. He was tempted to do it anyway, but the pastor’s voice cut through his internal mix of elation and disbelief once again.
basically i had a soulmate au scene/montage in my head that didn't work w soulmate dreams. this one is based on matching marks. in my head i also have vague concept of a names based soulmate au. maybe I'll end up with a wholeass series of these just for destiel. guess I'll fuck around and find out.
He’d come by a few times now, usually during the morning lull, and he’d hit the stage where Dean had comfortably assigned him as a ‘regular’, albeit one that he was still liable to drop a mug in front of if the light caught his eyes in a particular way. So to see him outside of those ‘regular’ conditions was a shock Dean hadn’t been prepared for, much to the annoyance of the customer he’d been in the middle of serving right as he caught sight of Castiel.
with it. Okay with it, right up until the moment his father realised, until the moment he felt the ever-tight grip of his John Winchester's right hand burning on his shoulder as the left handed him the sheet and his eyes met a steely glare daring him to challenge the unspoken order and find out exactly what would happen.
“Gabriel — my brother, that is — invited me to his new apartment for the afternoon, and the café was on the way.”
one day (his most elaborate daydreams around a future with Cas had ended just after an imagined confession, when he’d dared to imagine anything at all— repression could be a bitch at times), Magnus and Alec spared a moment to glance at each other in obvious amusement.
“Sammy certainly gave as good as he got,” Dean replied, sliding Cas’ drink across the counter. “Anyway, I hope you have a good afternoon!”
“Dean, I… will not be able to provide sexual-intimacy to you if we choose to pursue this relationship. I feel I must be clear about that before you commit yourself to me more than you already have.”
Cas blinked, processing the meaning behind Dean’s words as he tried to formulate a response. Before he could, Dean froze, glancing back up to meet his eyes for a fraction of a second before avoiding them once more.
Dean had half hoped that Charlie would’ve forgotten about what she’d noticed at the café, but he’d known it was unlikely. Sure enough, a few hours later she was letting herself into his apartment without any fanfare, takeout in hand.
this au again lmaooo, i feel like its just a fun fluffy non-plotty vibe whereas my other aus have like. more actually important things happening in them currently. also i was reading hogwarts aus again today bc i always seem to end up there in my first few days back in a fandom fkchzdjsv. malec my beloved,,,,, u may already be in a fantasy setting but sometimes i wish to read abt u existing in a different fantasy setting while ignoring the fact that ur author was involved in a lot of fandom drama for that second fantasy setting.
“Come on, Charlie, we both know better than anyone how he gets in the mornings. I dunno why Gabe bothered to stick him on this early, you’d think he’d know better by now.”
“What, did you pussy out again? You’ve been staring at his ass for months now, Clarence, you need to talk to him eventually. Or stick your tongue down his throat. Whichever’s easier.”
I might actually manage to develop this into a full fic without the writing braincell dropping off because in a server last night I was brainstorming petty things Cas and Dean could do to each other and it was just. So much fucking fun.
Dean grumbled slightly and opened his eyes, smiling as found himself squinting up at his husband’s face.
Dean blinked his eyes open again, not having quite realised he’d closed them. He managed another wave, and Sally grinned at them both.
While they’d been bickering, Dean had been gently tugging Cas up off the couch and across the living room, so he delivered that last line with a wink as he leant casually against the nearest wall.
“Like I’d leave you on your own. I just thought someone with a little more expertise than me might be useful to have on hand. Or someone in the same state as you.”
“I don’t know why I bother going on these anymore, I haven’t had a successful first date in almost two years.”
Cas pulled his head away from its position tucked against Dean's neck to send him a soft, slow smile.
of it all, looking back through their recent past to try and work out what had catalysed the connection?
this is another prime example of 'i came in w a plan and they took too long to get there' lmaoooo. i shall just extend he when i post full honeymoon fic.
“I can’t exactly go to your brother complaining that Jimmy keeps messing up my proposal. Or saying that I’m getting frustrated with the issues we have with finding times for intimacy due to Jimmy’s continued presence in our shared body. What if he thinks that means I’m frustrated with the relationship as a whole??”
The dreams were nothing, he was sure. It was just… his minds way of processing falling, the change from angel to human.
he had no information every chance he got, spent even more time in the library than he had during finals at Stanford. Bobby sent him worried looks when he refused to give Dean a hunter’s funeral, but to Sam it just… wasn’t an option. Dean would need his body back, after all, when either Sam or his mysterious soulmate pulled him out of Hell.
to finish up in the bathroom, which they learnt when he dropped his toiletry bag with a clatter and a whispered ‘holy shit!’)
who’s affected if you spend all of eternity burning down in Hell! Are you just gonna leave them to live out the rest of their life on Earth, never getting to meet you, wondering what happened to make you never meet?”
not that I don't plan on continuing the coffee shop/childhood friends to lovers/whatever else ends up being lumped in there fic eventually as well, but I felt like some good old fashioned 'i only know his name and I stare at him every time he comes in the store' vibes
randomly fell back into yuuri on ice today, so i'm wondering if this is gonna be a period where I cycle through all my anime fandoms. that or the Olympics being on got me thinking abt it again. i still love that anime so goddamn much and periodically google looking to see if there are any updates abt ice adolescence. it's just comforting, you know?
have a soulmark? I mean, I know Jimmy had one, but I thought that faded when the vessel became fully yours.”
“—It’s just, it took me so long to even realise what the dreams meant, and I figured you would’ve said something if the bond was reciprocated, but I know I’m not exactly your ideal partner—” Cas barrelled on, apparently not registering Dean’s response, and Dean found himself freezing.
Cas was careful not to audibly sigh, well aware of familial obligation, but he did withdraw on himself as he waved and mouthed a ‘Goodbye!’ at Dean as they walked out the door together and parted ways.
It was a simple one, and neither of them really knew how it started. Just that it had, about a year ago now, and that it was useful for getting Dean out of his own head on the days that he needed an extra hand.
He just couldn’t risk it, couldn’t risk Cas’ friendship, didn’t want to taint everything they’d done for each other through the years by forcing Cas to re-evaluate all of his actions through the lens of a one-sided attraction.
sky u know exactly why this exists today flkvsjhdf,k although I'm very excited abt soulless cas au its made me Feel Things so angsty vibes it is
Now Cas was wearing his ‘I’m confused about why you’re confused’ face, and Dean felt a little bad for putting it there.
more of this au again, so sorry for any of y'all who don't like crossovers (again it should be accessible with no shadowhunters knowledge given its from dean & cas' perspective and they also have no clue whats going on bUT i get that that's not the only thing that stops people from reading crossovers)
Also, in Susan’s defence, the last time they’d met her Dean had been in the midst of a bi-panic induced ‘look at what a straight macho man I am, I’m not interested in my angel best friend
Cas had woken up while Dean was in the bathroom, and was now sitting on the bed, knees pulled up to his chest. He tilted his head inquisitively as Dean obviously hesitated, but didn’t say anything yet, apparently as loath to break the silence surrounding them as Dean was. Dean considered the situation for another moment, then surprised
“Dude, some people just like cake. You having a preference for pie doesn’t mean this was a personal attack.”
“You’re more than welcome to spend the night with me, angel, you know that right? Even when you aren’t experiencing post-grooming snuggle vibes.”
Just like most mornings, the café didn’t get any foot traffic for the first half an hour they were open. Part of Cas thought that the only reason Gabe opened the place at 6 am was to force them all out of bed before any sane human would be awake in some cruel, long-running prank that would lead to some form of pay off before they murdered him brutally for pulling them into work earlier than he actually needed to.
“But like. Even with all of that, I still feel like I want his approval. Even though I know that I don’t
easter always has a mix of nostalgia and bad vibes for me, because growing up it was always one of my favourite holidays (we used to go camping with family and family friends) but also my dad walked out the week before easter and it was. obviously not the greatest vibe. idk. it's just an interesting conflict of feelings
also had to very frantically warn off a younger person in a discord server from looking at watching the show fjsjsks, they were like ‘you guys are gonna make me wanna watch it’ and we were like NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. when we explained it was v gorey and adult they thankfully were like ‘oh yeah no y’all are right I would Not Like That’ but the fact that they’re watching squid game rn despite finding it actively distressing at points made me ahh. as such I also googled age ratings in America and promptly discovered they’re Different for tv shows and movies????? which is whack Americans explain. (I was googling bc in Aus squid game is rated MA15+, while hannibal is rated R18+— I know a lot of R American movies get knocked to ma here bc y’all don’t have anything between it and PG13+, whereas we don’t have pg13 and instead have m and ma. ratings man, why can’t they b universal. but also i want the aussie ones to be universal y'alls make no sense)
relationship doesn’t mean it was any less important to you, and there are many things you didn’t get a proper chance to try and work out with him due to his death. Although it’s likely you would never have truly been able to work out some of those issues, due to John’s own issues and ingrained beliefs, losing that possibility of change isn’t easy either.”
Dean smiled softly at him, leaning in to brush a soft kiss against his lips before pulling away once more.
wasn’t it, that the one day he was determined to do something about his crush was the one day said crush wasn’t in class. He
anyway that's a lot of words for a fandom that this drabble isn't even set around but that's how it be sometimes✨
How could they be, when they were a phenomenon that 90% of the population had direct experience with?
Eventually, Castiel mentally acknowledges what the dreams that flood his brain every night mean. There’s only so far that denial will stretch, and they’ve been feeling particularly…
Miracle was bounding along enthusiastically in front of them, pushing his leash to its limits before running back to sniff at them and their shoes then shooting off again. Pleasant energy filled the air, and Dean felt himself grinning at the fact that Cas could have such a pleasant, uncomplicated birthday. Even just a year ago the safe domesticity of it all had seemed like an impossible dream, with him dragging Cas out of the Empty by the skin of his teeth, the newly ex-angel unconscious and unresponsive.
If Dean were a lesser man, he probably would’ve stuck his tongue out at Cas in response, but he suspected that Cas would’ve just called him out on how lost in the moment he
The book Sam had been holding dropped to the ground, and Dean felt kinda glad he’d waited till Sammy was no longer holding his tea to tell him this.
Oh, sure, there are nights spent on the living room couch, cuddled together closely enough that Sammy will ignore the ever-present urge to annoy his brother in favour of leaving to any place where he isn’t a third wheel. And there are quiet mornings spent together, arms slung around waists while breakfast sizzles away in a pan, ignored in favour of the soft press of lips to skin.
Chaps 156, 157, 162, 174, 190, 191, 204, 231— wow i do truly be writing from a shadowhunters-centric perspective for a lot of this au so far, considering DFKZJ

way of describing my father,” he agreed, “Though I do not know how relevant his personality is to determining our universe.”
“I also do not have particularly strong feelings about where we end up having it,” Cas agreed. “All that really matters to me is that we’re together.”
“Less your body, and more your status as a personal space heater. Although I might be revising that position right about now given you’re
uhhh slightly less good mental health check today, its been a more hmst vibe again. i think i mentioned on here (this is truly turning into my diary as well as my daily writing fic lmaooo) but i was tryna organise to see my best friend today— unfortunately she's having withdrawal issues from her anxiety meds (she didn't titrate off them properly) so it ended up not happening. she warned me yesterday morning that it might b the case and she'd have to see how she went (and i don't resent her for cancelling at all, i'd much rather she do what she needs to keep herself as stable as possible than worry abt me) but yeah she messaged me late last night cancelling and i saw it just b4 i was gonna go to sleep and it fucked w me a lil because i hadn't realised how much i was using the possibility of seeing her to like, keep my spirits up. so then i didn't get to sleep till 1:30 am (:
“She, uh, asked if I was looking for myself or for my partner,” he admitted. “Then when I told her about you, she suggested you might appreciate some. I thought she was right, so…” He then gestured vaguely in a way that conveyed ‘so I bought you some’.
“Sorry, I’m a bit out of it this morning. What can I get you?” He asked, plastering on his best customer service smile.
She started walking towards the two of them anyway, and Dean had to grit his teeth when his purposeful aura of ‘not interested’ did nothing to dissuade her flirty grin.
Not in the slightest. He just… had some issues he had to work through still. And Cas was more understanding about it than Dean thought he deserved— He never seemed resentful or annoyed when Dean pulled away, just kind. He’d give Dean’s hand a comforting squeeze before dropping it, and was just so
He knew he’d started to fall, that was obvious by the fact that he was sleeping in the first place, but dreaming was such a
“To think I survived multiple apocalypses only to get ganked by a vamp wearing a shitty Halloween mask."
That was doable, especially given the amount of involvement they’d had in pretty much every apocalyptic event in their universe, but now the problem was with where to
1) I got my first Pfizer jab!! I haven’t had any bad side effects this far, just a sore arm and slight chills (which could just be the weather), but I wasn’t expecting to considering it’s my first dose. This is a pro-vaccine zone, folks,  please please
abt cas. no cheating/suspected cheating shenanigans going on here and no (intentional at least) emotional cheating going on either (its a childhood friends to lovers au we know they've always been a lil bit in love with each other even if they didn't realise)
“But then surely there are too many kittens for the number of people looking to adopt one, and some of these kittens would’ve missed out on being adopted?”
“The wedding is stressful because I want to make sure guests won’t spontaneously decide to unleash 10 years of ill will on each other while we’re standing at the altar,” he explained, watching Sam and Cas closely. “The honeymoon is just us, and I trust we’ll be able to handle any issues that crop up. The only thing I wanna avoid is going on a plane.”
I got an extension for the assignment that's due tomorrow at least bc I doubt I'll finish it in time esp if tomorrow is anything like today, so that's a plus at least.
He still wouldn’t be, honestly, if it wasn’t happening as frequently as it was. He finds himself doing daily skin checks, the way he did when he was a young teen and still listening to the voice in the back of his head that whispered maybe — just maybe — he deserved someone who would undoubtedly love him for who he was. Things are going to shit, have been since before he ended up in and out of Hell, but it becomes a lifeline for him.
another update to this! war of hearts is a surprisingly good vibe to write this au to, which is good because it's been playing constantly in my brain for the past couple of days (and thus played regularly on my spotify). malec my beloved,,,,,,,,,,,
. Cas didn’t always come on hunts, these days, sometimes because he had angelic duties to attend to but more often recently because he had something he wanted to get done on base, a small project that he was filling his time with now that he had that free will he’d strived so hard to defend.
“Yeah, Cas, we do. You gonna explain why you keep pulling the disappearing act on me? I thought we’d gotten past this a couple of years back, but apparently I was wrong.”
again the stream was a good vibe and was very chill which is always fun, if i was not actively interacting in chat i probably would've just had it on in the background to vibe tobc its good to have stuff like that sometimes
Dean huffed into the apartment he shared with Sam, far more frustrated than he’d expected to be when leaving for his date a few hours prior.
once again my friend streamed today gdflxksjh I'll probably stop updating yall on that being a thing that happened eventually but it's like, the main thing I'm doing with my life rn lol. see past chaps for a link to her channel where u can find the vods she uploads

, flying is an important skill to have as a wizard. Not everywhere is accessible by floo, and you can’t safely apparate to a location you’ve never been to before.”
that voice, almost better than his own, but until he saw the other man with his own two eyes he didn’t think he’d believe he was really here, back home for the first time in almost two years.
expected to pledge his life to this man that he’s only met a handful of times now, but he knows he cannot. That is not his decision to make, and would be an unforgivable slight against the Novak’s and their kingdom.
gotta deal with all this shit. It’s sat in here for decades, surely a few more years won’t hurt. We can leave it up for the next gen of hunters to organise.”
Unsurprisingly, it was easier said than done. They happened to be a ways away from the doors Dean felt it would be best to leave the ballroom from, as to attract the least attention to their escape, and as they travelled in that direction they found themselves waylaid by multiple sets of nobles that wished to congratulate them on their nuptials. Before too long, however, they’d successfully left the loud ballroom, and Dean found himself holding back a wide grin as they walked arm in arm throughout the castle’s hallway.
Chaps 39, 40, 66, 84, 142, 150, 196, 207, 230, 234, 248— some differences in castle politics/policies come up!
(“I was watching a sad movie”, “I was reading this article about a dog that died and kept waiting for its master”, “I kept looking up statistics about colony collapse in honey-bees and how not enough is being done yet to ensure we save them from extinction”.)
“It does not, but names have power, as I’m sure you are aware, for the name Hunter belongs to you even less than the name Castiel belongs to me.”
Unfortunately for him, Cas seemed more amused than annoyed by his constant stream of complaints, meaning he probably wasn’t gonna convince his boyfriend that he was perfectly fine never getting on a broom, as he’d managed thus far.
although i'm less exhausted than i was yesterday, the writing braincell has disappeared into the same void that a lot of my energy has soooooooo we know I'm not v confident in the quality of this drabble. oh well. fix it vibes are good no matter the quality of the package they come in flkxdj
and thanks to anyone that already popped by her channel or is planning to!!! all follows and views are greatly appreciated 💜💜💜
reading fics with a disclaimer of like, ‘this work is intended for fans of spn, anyone involved with the production of the show turn away now’ is so funny to me even tho I do get why some people might be uncomfy with actors reading their fic etc. like, if misha collins wants to read any of the fics I’ve published then he can go wild he deserves it
He kept thinking it over as he got up to relieve his bladder, and when he returned to their newly shared room he paused in the doorway for a second to admire the figure of Cas on the bed.
“I was not expecting things to be this busy,” he admitted, and Dean huffed out a laugh before instinctively trading places with Benny so that he could chat to Cas as drinks were made.
“I never thought I’d get to have anything like this,” Dean admitted. “Even in that year with Lisa and Ben, I wasn’t… at peace. I felt like I was constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, like things couldn’t last.”
to say the least, and the more different two universes were, the harder it was to form a reliable connection.
Both their grin’s widened, and Dean tugged Cas in by the tie for a gentle kiss. They pulled apart a second later, but continued to stare lovingly in each other’s eyes for a few moments before Dean deemed it time to break the silence.
, he had it on good authority that Jess’ family had been confused when she hit puberty and identified as wholly heterosexual considering they’d thought she was the soulmate of one ‘Samantha W’ since she’d been about 3.
Dean started slightly when he heard his husband’s familiar ringtone ring out into the class, and he saw his student’s smirking slightly as they glanced up from their work with knowing looks.
He may have known something like this was coming for years, since he started getting lessons in what was to be expected from him in service of their country, but intellectually knowing this didn’t prepare him for the
The contact was grounding, and Cas squeezed his hand firmly before searching his eyes for some clue. Whatever he saw must’ve satisfied him, as his own smile widened and he nodded to their pastor, prompting him to start the ceremony.
For another, there was still the matter of how they’d actually get to Cas to remove his grace and all his other angelic qualities in the first place.
not having the courage to do more than flash a quick smile Cas’ way before their lecture, Castiel apparently had no qualms about approaching him at the end of class.
He’s luckier than some, as forearm marks are fairly easy to keep hidden. There’s been a couple of incidents on hunts, where whatever sonofabitch they had to gank that week took a swipe at him and tore through the material that he’d been wearing every day since he hit 16 and his mark had started to appear, but it could be worse. He could be like Sammy, who grew his hair long and wore high collared shirts to hide the mark on the back of his neck, or like the unlucky fuckers who had to deal with face marks.
i didn't rly know who to use as the professor so I just shoved azazel into the role, but i don't think he quit fits right so I may swap him out for someone else if I end up continuing this. this is why me and mum need to watch more spn again lmaoooooo

Today’s is more enemies to lovers shenanigans because I have limited time to write this in (heading home on pt from uni to go to my mums bday celebration) and college vibes are the easiest to draw on rn (that’s what uni does to u ig)
“Not really,” Dean responded. “But I figure that the more we get through in one session, the less sessions we’ll have to go through overall.”
He’s just sitting, waiting for updates, dreading the moment he finds out that his instincts are as on point as he expects, that his worst fears will be confirmed. And then Sam walks in.
weren’t being groomed to take over the Institute as intensely as I was, so they got away with more,” Alec pointed out, and Magnus sighed theatrically.
“I— yeah, no, he didn’t know. I think he might’ve suspected at points, based on some things he said, but as long as I kept bringing chicks back he left well enough alone.”
“My darling Alexander, I know I’m both devilishly handsome and wonderfully magical, but even I have my limits. I will be able to help our new friends find their way home, but it won’t be as simple as getting them to slip on some ruby slippers and click their heels together.”
“Soulmate pairings are one of God’s greatest gifts to humankind. He would not do anyone the disservice of giving them a bond that only went one way.”
But Dean had been lying here for almost two hours now, and he didn’t feel any closer to sleep than he had at the beginning, even with exhaustion creeping through his muscles to settle in his bones.
“I don’t know if I can be bothered,” he admitted, and Cas shrugged before wandering further into the room.
anyway fuck the cheating bastard that unfortunately gave me half my genes but also he did raise me well for the first 10 years of my life and was. there. for another 4 after that. and sometimes it's hard to reconcile the man that read me the hobbit when i was 7 with the man that walked out on us.
“Sorry, it’s my little brother,” Dean explained, already starting to hold the phone up to his ear. “He doesn’t usually call me this early in the day, so it’s probably important.”
“Dean,” Cas started very seriously, sitting down at the breakfast table one morning. “I think I now understand why Charlie feels the way she does about certain media franchises.”
As he looked across at Dean, all his planned-out explanations and questions flew from his brain. He tried to collect his thoughts, but Dean was growing more and more closed off by the minute, and he had a horrible feeling that he only had a couple more seconds before Dean would give up and walk off again. So he mentally scanned through everything he’d been thinking over in the last month or so, re-figuring out his main concerns and worries, then blurted out the first question that came to mind.
Because honestly, they’re about as high as they would be if they were standing properly, their feet almost brushing the grass below.
so i was planning to like. write for a different au today. but that didn't happen lmaoooo (tbf I've been reading mostly college aus this week and that's definitely influencing the vibes I'm putting out lmao)
This is probably also a mess (tomorrow’s is probably gonna be the only one while I’m away that isn’t and that’s because we might be doing a writing activity at some point) but eh I wrote sooo goal achieved
And Dean felt love for Cas in every waking moment they spent together (and he’d wager that the same could be said for the non-waking ones). It didn’t matter what he was doing, how much they were pissing each other off on any given day. It was just a fact of his life now, alongside every other fundamental rule of the universe. One plus one equals two. Bert and Ernie are gay. Dean loves Cas with every cell in his body. There was no avoiding it, not now that it was out in the open, and he sincerely doubted he would ever want to do so again anyway.
“I didn’t realise you needed my permission for that, Sammy, I would’ve exercised that control a hell of a lot more often when you were an annoying toddler if I had.”
“Stuffy?” Cas asked. “Don’t worry, Dean, I am well aware of how formal my full name is in many situations. My parents like that about it, it’s part of why they chose it, but I often find it chafing.”
The second time Castiel came into the shop while Dean was working, he’d thought he was more prepared. He’d (barely) gotten through the rest of their first interaction without breaking any more mugs, which was definitely a plus, but he
more people roaming these corridors than the handful of guards that should be out here, none of them would dare lecture either him or Castiel on their unbecoming behaviour. It was their wedding day, after all.
And she knew she didn’t have to have everything figured out! Right now, she was still trying to work out if she was, well, a
ok so i am forever grateful to how fucking supportive my brother is and was of me when i accidentally came out/was sorta outed as genderfluid by my sister to my mum (but not intentionally! its a long and stressful story tho :/). It was,,, not a fun time for me, and although i imagine with time things will get easier, coming out before ur ready to is fucking hellish esp when it's not a 110% supportive environment (like my mum tries but she doesn't Get It and it's not something I can easily talk about with her because it takes a lotta emotional energy). Like seriously, he is the best brother I could've asked for and I'll forever be grateful to him and the work he's put into becoming a better ally over the years. In line with that + a convo i had on discord about how we all thought Sam would do his best to support Dean including w hiding it from John, this came to be :)
considered when it came to being a responsible house owner was that he and Cas could actually properly decorate for holidays.
“You can go take a nap if you need to, babe, me and Sammy can handle stuff alone for a little while. Did you sleep alright last night?”
“Then you don’t need to panic about that possibility! You just need to show up and tell them the truth.”
this is just based on the vague idea I have kicking around my head soulmate name aus relating to the name an individual identifies with more than their legal name. i have an mcu peter/harley fic around it that I want to write one day, so I was like 'hm
Dean had been mildly worried that Cas would tense again at the firmer movement, but it appeared that his gentling had done the trick. He wasn’t unnecessarily harsh, of course, even if Cas’ angelic status would prevent any real harm from coming to him at Dean’s hands, because he doubted it would be needed to get his wings in order.
long it would take them to figure the whole Jimmy issue out, it did put a damper on things a lot of the time. He’d decided to let Cas take the lead on things, figuring he had a better judge of both Jimmy’s boundaries and Jimmy’s alertness at any given moment, but sometimes he just wanted to hug his boyfriend without having to check if the man his boyfriend was technically possessing was awake or asleep.
While he spoke, his hands had migrated from Dean’s chest to the back of his neck, and he began gently stroking the base of Dean’s hairline.
Cas shrunk in on himself, annoyed with his apparent inability to hold awkward conversations without blurting out the first thing that came to mind, but didn’t back down from his line of questioning, no matter how shocked Dean seemed by it.
, it wasn’t exactly every day that Dean went around spilling the family business to people that weren’t directly involved in a supernatural attack.
He missed being able to revel in the peace Dean exuded when he was at rest, something he rarely got to experience or cherish while awake.
idk if i've mentioned it in my and thus far but we're currently prepping our family home for selling (: (its so weird thinking abt moving this is where i Grew Up but that's how divorce be ig) and we're in the stage of 'ok we need to get rid of everything extraneous for real estate photos'. and let me tell you. i have a Lot Of Shit so its very slow going. and stressful. I've hit the point of 'ill shove this in a cupboard and work out what to do with it b4 open houses start' or 'this is our furniture no one should open this thus it totally works as a storage spot even though I'm running out of room for my clothes'. the other issue is my room doesn't have a lot of storage and my mum doesn't seem to comprehend that (or the fact that literally every surface is covered in shit, I'm very cluttered) and is stressing about the fact that it's taking me forever (which is not helped b my inability to focus on shit like this plus my chronic fatigue). I've channeled that frustration into this drabble a lil lol. ignore the iffy quality lol i kept getting distracted
“Yeah, but this way we get to ogle each other topless in public, slowly apply sunscreen to each other's backs, see each other all wet from the ocean…”
Dean stared blankly at him for a few moments, before obviously dismissing his words and turning back to the book he was flipping through slowly, and Sam sighed. Convincing him would probably be easier if Dean would explain what exactly had happened that day, beyond ‘Cas had a deal with the Empty’ and ‘He sacrificed himself to save me’.
“That does not make it your name,” Dean pointed out, and Castiel rewarded him with a high, tinkling laugh.
note, if i end up writing a taz drabble or two in the next few days, don't be shocked. I'll still continue writing spn ones as well for the near future as we just started season 3 finally and i don't see this hyperfixation going away fully till I've at the very least finished the show, but it might not be as all-consuming as it has been so far this year. also everyone go listen to the adventure zone right now it is so fuckin worth it even if there's a few eps where it's more iffy in quality at the start
been that. And the worst thing is, there wasn’t even anything definitive he and Castiel could point to as proof that their professor was both creepy as hell and fucking
They were still holding hands, which Dean would feel more awkward about if it wasn’t abundantly clear no one in the building gave a shit. There was no one else around anyway, as everyone in the group had had to leave to go on some sort of demon hunting mission (and god, Dean was just
“We’re just two peas in a pod then, aren’t we? Because let me tell you, angel, I feel many things for you as well. For instance, right now I have a strong feeling that I want to kiss you.”
“Oh, I’m actually footing the bill tonight,” he says with a warm grin, and her eyebrows rise in surprise.
The positive affection seemed to make another round of sobs wrack Castiel’s body, but his arms tightened around Dean’s waist and he burrowed his face further into Dean’s chest, so Dean didn’t dare pull away. He could freak out about this all later. For now, he had an angel to comfort.
Wrote this on my phone bc I’ve got a friends 18th and realised I forgot to write it when I could type it up and post it on my computer, so I’ll give it a proper edit and stick the past honeymoon chaps in the a/n tomorrow 💜
look literally the only other thing i could think of was pretending i was secretly a wincestie and making this chapter just. really bad wincest fanfic, but i couldn't bring myself to putting both myself and yall through that. so my immortals parody it was. this ~totally~ counts as my 100 words today, right?
“How have you been?” Dean asked, leaning casually against his desk as Cas sorted out his bag. “You usually get here a little earlier than this, don’t you?”
that intensity as much as he used to think he would. Things were different when the person you were sharing things like that with was your son in every way that mattered.
I have no clue where my laptop is still so this chap is again being posted from my phone. We might have a couple of days of this so just ignore any weird formatting things djfjdjdk
He felt like absolute shit every time Cas reached for him and his first instinct was to shy away from the touch, even though the angel seemed to understand. And even when he
this is up slightly later today bc i needed to do restful activities for longer than usual to scrape together enough spoons to get the motivation to write, even tho it'll fuck me over slightly more in the long run as I'll be up later overall. energy things are weird.
He knew he’d started to fall, that was obvious by the fact that he was sleeping in the first place, but dreaming was such a
“Oh! Do you think you know who your soulmate is? Because that’s the main reason to ask unless you’re already dating, and I know you’re not seeing anyone.”
be pushing it down. Dean deserved happiness, no matter how he found it. Castiel had no right to feel entitled to his affections, no matter how he personally felt. Soulmate connection or not, Dean’s free will to choose who he pursued was his right.
Part of Dean, however, wishes he had the confidence to go bare. To walk around, mark uncovered, hoping that he’d stumble across his one-and-only somewhere along the way.
He’s pretty sure Cas doesn’t, although it can be hard to know for sure. Part of him marvels at the idea that he could hide
going to be able to get rid of them, are we. You’ll look at me sadly whenever I suggest we adopt one out to people we meet on hunts and I’ll give in every goddamn time.”
“Come to coffee with me this weekend?” He suggested. “It’ll be my treat, and it doesn’t have to mean anything if you don’t want it to, I just…”
His arms moved of their own accord, wrapping around Cas’ back tightly. He gripped the back of Cas’ shirt and tilted his head so it was as buried in the slightly shorter angel’s neck as possible. He felt fingers entangle in his hair, and he softened impossibly further.
my vibes today have been absolutely rancid BUT that did mean I got forcibly ejected out of the fantastic beasts fandom. however rather than rejoining supernatural i fell back into the mcu more specifically peter/harley because chaotic science /engineering boyfriends.
although ig almost all of these are soft actually so it would probably be this soft even w/out that,,,, but shhhhh
anyone got any switch game recs? i only have animal crossing and Mario odyssey and I feel like I should probably get a few more...
dean struggles with talking to cas— sorta related to chap 166 (similar vibes and could be seen as a continuation probs) but not initially intended as one <3
Cas' cheeks grow warm when he reads Dean's comment. Does that mean Dean thinks he's attractive? Or is he just joking and teasing like he usually does in group chat? Why are human beings so hard to figure out?
"He most definitely feels the same way," Castiel says, lifting his other hand and stroking Dean's lower lip with his thumb. "And he'd very much like to take you home tonight."
Gabriel enters his apartment (one of many he has on Earth), flops onto his leather couch, and turns on the television. Within seconds, he brings up a satellite view of Lawrence, Kansas, then zooms in on the town’s newest resident.
By the time he’s finished, Missouri has put down the pillow and is sitting next to Cas on the couch, eyes filled with tears. “You poor sweet thing,” she says, patting Cas’ arm.
He hears a gritting footstep and whirls around, knife raised. Castiel is coming back down the tunnel, hands held up in a gesture of surrender.
"What the heck," Dean mutters, then freezes at the sound of his voice. It's deep, ringing, sonorous— like a church bell booming at the bottom of a gravel pit. He knows that voice. And it doesn't belong to him.
The doctor’s visit goes... okay. Jack gets upset when Dr. Mills pokes and prods him and tests his reflexes, and he gets
But Castiel just smiles. “Parenting is a very admirable occupation. And you are doing it alone, which is even more admirable.”
“Please don’t,” Cas says. He’s sitting on the sofa, Jack cradled in his arms, while Gabe is perched in one of the armchairs watching the scene with utter glee. Jack seems completely unperturbed by the drama— he's fast asleep and making little sucking motions with his mouth.
Cas' hands, he knows instinctively that it's Cas touching him. There's confidence and grace in those hands; the feel of them sets Dean's nerves on fire.
“And don’t worry about packing,” Dean continues, ignoring Gabe. “I’m gonna call Mom in the morning and explain that we might need to come a couple days later than we planned.”
"Oh, I will." Cas shifts upward and kisses Dean again, long and deep, stubble rough as sandpaper. "But I want to see you first."
Luke makes another grab for the baby, this time catching hold of Jack's onesie and jerking it backwards. Jack wakes up and starts bawling.
The fear of Luke coming back grows fainter every day, as does the possibility of any relatives adopting Jack. The caseworker did manage to track down Jack's grandparents on his mother's side, but the couple is in their mid-sixties and not prepared to raise an infant. They're also extremely religious, so the news that their daughter had a child out of wedlock with that "sinful man" wasn't taken very well. Since Jack's mom was their only child, and the rest of the family is not close, it's looking more and more likely that Cas will become Jack's permanent guardian.
"Please," Dean grits out, a red-hot blush creeping up his ears, "suck me off, Cas. Or jerk me off, I don't care. Just no more teasing,
Jack shoves a pastel green envelope at his father, who takes it with a bewildered expression. "It's not April Fool's Day, is it?"
And it’s not even just about sex. If it was, things might be simpler. Easier to ignore. But every time Cas does something like listen to Ben’s rambling description of a dream as if it’s the most riveting story he’s ever heard, or solemnly pretend to eat the imaginary food Jack cooked in the Fisher Price play kitchen, Dean gets a warm, mushy feeling in his stomach that’s far, far more dangerous than just plain lust.
“Lease he’ll have a well-rounded education,” Dean says. “Right, Jack? I’ll teach you how to be a cool dude that gets laid, and you dad’ll teach you how to be a nerd with no friends.”
There's an eight-foot metal fence blocking the entrance to the service road, because nothing in Dean's life is fucking simple. Castiel keeps watch as he starts cutting a hole in the mesh, although he seems far more focused on Dean than on their surroundings.
He pulls out his phone and texts Charlie. If there's even the slightest chance that Cas might want the same thing he does, Dean's gonna take it. And if anyone can help him map out a master strategy to win someone's heart, it's the Queen of Moondoor.
"Keep telling yourself that, hot stuff," Cesar says from the couch where he's cuddled up with Jesse.
"Five stitches," Dean grumbles. "The guy looked like he was about twelve. Do they just not have grown-up doctors anymore?"
He decides to bring it up on the Friday before classes resume. That way, they’ll have the whole weekend to discuss how to handle the transition. Dean wants it to be as painless as possible, even though he knows deep down that pain is inevitable.
Five. Five children, stolen away in the dead of night. Five families that will have no closure, will never know what happened to their sons and daughters. Five funerals with empty caskets, five candlelit vigils on street corners.
Cas sits up sharply, dislodging Dean from his very comfortable position. "You had no right to do that, Dean. That was my decision to make, not yours."
The man takes a step forward, which is a really stupid thing to do on an icy, slanted rooftop, but apparently this doofus didn’t get the memo. Sure enough, his foot slips out from under him, and with a startled cry, the man falls flat on his back and starts sliding downward.
A large patch of snow is stained red, and in the center is a crumpled human figure. Castiel spots a huge moose lumbering off into the woods, blood on its antlers, and everything becomes instantly clear. Fear lurches within him. Moose are highly dangerous creatures, short-tempered and vicious; a pack of wolves can occasionally bring one down, but they are often unsuccessful. Dean may already be dead.
All of a sudden he’s up in Dean’s space, close and warm, not quite touching him but making it clear that he
Dean frowns at him. “Okay,” he says slowly, and follows Sam out into the hall. Once they’re out of earshot, he folds his arms and stares at his brother. “What?”
He's not surprised to see a small shrine on the back counter— this is a predominantly Latino neighborhood and lots of people worship saints— but he
A dull buzzing sound catches his attention and Castiel glances over at the nightstand. A slim, slate grey smartphone is resting on its surface, lighting up with an unknown number. Maybe it belongs to the person who lives here?
Cas leans on the bathroom vanity, arms trembling with fatigue. No one warned him how much his arms would hurt from carrying a baby around all the time. He tries not to look at himself in the mirror; he knows he must look absolutely disgusting. When was the last time he had a shower? He can’t remember.
"Ugh." Dean makes a face. "Fine. But if we're gonna read a bunch of boring books, we're gonna do it at my place. I'm not spending another minute in that dusty hellhole."
Mary sits down next to him. “No sense in worrying about things you can’t control,” she says, gently patting Jack’s head. “All you can do is give this little guy the very best care and love you can, for as long as you can. And if your brother
“But we have Dad,” Jack says, sounding more cheerful. “And Uncle Sam and Aunt Eileen, and Patience and Miss Moseley, and Grandma Ellen and Grandpa Bobby and Jo, and lots and lots of friends. So we’re gonna be okay.”
Cas isn't kidding. He captures Dean's mouth in a bruising kiss, and Dean can't help it— he starts whimpering, almost whining, too turned on to care how fucking needy he sounds. Apparently Cas really likes the noises he's making, because he deepens the kiss even further, forcing his tongue between Dean's lips, licking the roof of his mouth and the insides of his cheeks, like he's trying to map every centimeter. Dean lets his head fall back against the wall, eyes rolling back in his head, reveling in how fucking
“Then why jog Cas’ memory?” Dean asks, deliberately not looking at Cas. “Actually, why come here at all?”
Cas sighs and comes into the room. “I just don’t feel very prepared for tomorrow,” he says, collapsing on the bed.
Even though he initiated the kiss, Dean was still so deliciously pliant, opening up those beautiful lips and letting Castiel plunder his mouth
been as scared as he is right now. He just went to Target to buy diapers, and now there's a swarm of police outside the house and Cas' brother Luke is being shoved into the back of a squad car. Terror floods his system as he puts the car in park, jumps out and sprints across the street without even looking both ways. He nearly gets hit by a car in the process, the words
Cas leaves the room and Dean carefully turns Jack over, cradling his head, until the baby’s safely on his back. “Hey, cutie-pie.” He stretches out on his stomach and wraps his fingers around one of Jack’s chubby legs, giving it a gentle squeeze. The baby smiles and wriggles, clearly pleased that one of the big humans is down on his level.
with Cas, okay? It’s just a crush, it’s gonna go away in like five minutes. Cas needs our help and he could really use a parent right now. Hell, we all could.”
For a while, the room is silent except for the wet, sloppy sounds of kissing, punctuated with soft gasps and whispered endearments. Cas’ mouth is sweet and lush, his tongue hot and slick between Dean’s lips, his stubble rasping against Dean’s chin like sandpaper. He plunges his hands in Cas’ thick hair and rakes his fingers through it, making Cas hum and push up into the touch like a cat being petted.
The raven stands up, a little unsteady on its feet. It starts to spread its wings, but then crumples back to the ground, hissing in pain.
"Just a moment, sweet boy," Castiel reassures him, rummaging in his nightstand. He always keeps lube and condoms at the ready, just in case he finds someone he wants to feed on more frequently, but that rarely happens anymore.
Cas wouldn’t do that. Cas would take one look at Dean and his awesome kids and hop aboard the Commitment Express with no hesitation. Dean imagines a lifetime of moments like this— standing next to each other at the sink, cuddled together on the couch, taking road trips with the boys, and when did he become such a romantic sap? That’s Sam’s job, not his.
to find them. He doesn’t believe in all that fate and destiny crap, but he believes in what he sees in front of him. Cas is steady, calm, taking everything in stride with unflappable ease. He just
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, his stomach swooping uncontrollably as he looks into those warm green eyes. “How are you?”
"It's probably for the best," Cas says dully. "To be perfectly honest, if I can't have you, life isn't really worth living anymore. Some people don't deserve to be saved.”
"See what you did?" Cas snaps, but he's secretly glad Jack is making so much noise. Maybe it'll make Luke less enthusiastic about holding him.
“You did okay with that one,” she says, nodding at Jack. “Don’t worry about it. Let’s make some lunch. And I think that little stinker might need changing again."
“I can see why you and Gabe get along so well. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him open a book, even when he was going to school here.”
Cole's mouth is hanging open and his eyes are bugging out. He looks very similar to Jack whenever Dean plays peekaboo with him.
Dean tears his eyes away from Castiel's sleeping form. He crawls out of bed, wincing as the raw skin of his ass chafes against the scratchy sheets, gathers up his clothes, and slips away without a sound.
“Then go to your room, or take a walk. Just stop bugging me.” Cas types furiously, head whipping back and forth between his notes and the computer screen.
What's Cas going to do once Dean isn't on campus anymore? Cas gets along with the rest of the frat just fine (except for Colon, the homophobic rectum) and the guys are always friendly and happy to help him out. But there also seems to be this subtle, silent understanding between them and Dean. They seem to know, instinctively, that it's Dean's responsibility to take care of Cas and Jack, even though it's never been openly discussed. Dean honestly can't picture Cas staying at Sigma Zeta for his senior year if Dean isn't there too.
Sure enough, a few seconds later Cas opens his eyes. As soon as they land on Dean, they go wide with something like fear.
"I—" Castiel swallows. "I'm not really— I don't think I should be doing this. I might put us in danger."
figure it out,” Dean retorts. “That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Cas is… he’s so fucking smart, Charlie. Like, genius levels of smart. And he’s so sweet and cute and his eyes are so fucking
“I appreciate the offer,” he says, “but I’m not really in the mood for clubbing tonight. Thanks anyway.”
"Oh." Dean's expression clears, and his eyes are suddenly very soft. "Yeah, I did say that. But things are different now."
Rowena rolls her eyes. "I'm sure you and Dr. Novak can piece it together. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a previous engagement I must attend that is
Luke lets out a grunt of pain and doubles over, but he doesn't fall backwards like Cas hoped he would. He hangs onto the door frame for support, clutching his balls with his free hand, and gives Cas a look of pure hatred.
"Oh." Dean shifts his weight, looking suddenly uncomfortable. "Yeah, I, uh… I partied pretty hard last year. Almost got kicked off the team. Trying to do better this time around."
"I don't think there's just one," Castiel says dryly, just before a tangle of teeth and claws burst out of the darkness.
Cas cradles Jack in his arms and bounces him gently, humming under his breath. When Charlie returns, she plops down next to Cas and offers him a paper cup filled with cold water, which he drinks gratefully. "Thank you," he murmurs.
“I see.” There’s a much longer pause, and Dean’s stomach tenses up. This is it. This is the part where Cas decides Dean isn’t worth the risk, and leaves without ever looking back.
Dean frowns. Surely he would recall meeting such a striking man, no matter how long ago it was. “What’s your name?” he asks, hoping that will jog his memory.
anything, obviously. Just…" He shakes his head. "Sorry. It's stupid. We'll have plenty of time for that later."
So he’s surprised when Cas reaches out and cups his chin in one hand, gently turning his head towards Cas’ face. Cautiously, Dean looks up to see Cas gazing at him very earnestly.
"Hurry, Daddy, hurry!" Jack tugs on Dean's hand as they walk down the hallway of the Humanities building, heedless of the students swirling around them.
Dean shakes his head. “Changed a few diapers. Drove you to a couple doctor’s visits. Called you an asshole at least once a day. Trust me, once the novelty wears off, you’re gonna get sick of me. I’m a pain to live with.”
“I don’t know why you insist on using that ridiculous voice,” Cas says from the doorway. He’s standing there with his arms folded, looking grumpy.
An awkward pause, then Dean laughs. “Just couldn’t stay away, huh?” He grabs Cas’ shoulder and steers him towards the house. “C’mon. Meet my buddies.”
"Would you let me, Dean?" he murmurs. One of his hands slides up Dean's chest and starts toying with his top shirt button. "Would you let me try on more? I really want to see what you look like in those little red ones."
He doesn’t see Dean during any of his recon missions, but he sees other people, presumably the others who live there. They all seem to be athletes, which makes sense since sports and fraternities tend to attract the same types of personalities— loud, boisterous, outgoing, thickheaded. There’s a tall black guy and a bearded white guy who usually sit on the front steps smoking cigarettes, but the rest of the house’s occupants aren’t outside often enough for him to recognize anyone on sight.
“Actually, the colon is approximately five feet long,” Cas says without thinking. “The anus and rectum are only a small part of it. So if you
Logically, Dean knows that at the end of the day, he really doesn’t have a place in this little domestic world Cas is creating for himself. He’s convenient, he’s useful, but eventually Cas is going to get the hang of this parenting thing, and then he won’t need Dean anymore. It’s probably better that he moves out sooner rather than later. Otherwise he’s going to get even more attached, and the harder it’ll be when the day finally comes.
in this, all right? I’m here. I can help make sure you have more time to study. And I'll talk to Missouri and my mom. They can help out more, too. We're gonna get you through this, okay?"
"Don't let Jesse hear you say that," Gabe teases. "Otherwise he might reconsider doing that super up-close-and-personal,
He hates the hurt look on Dean’s face, but it’s easier to wrap himself up in wounded pride than admit Dean’s just better at this than him. He expects Dean to shove the baby at him and walk away in the face of his rudeness, but once again, his friend surprises him.
