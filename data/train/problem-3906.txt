There’s a Biggerson’s right across the street, and Dean leads him there with enthusiasm. With negative memories attached to the restaurant chain, it’s not a place Castiel would normally go, but the location fits Dean’s requirements so Castiel keeps his own thoughts silent. Once inside, they’re led to a booth near the back. As soon as they’re seated, Dean flips open the menu and starts looking at the burger section. Castiel is surprised to find he’s not hungry. When he mentions this, Dean insists he order something, that as soon as he’s got food in front of him, he’ll eat.
It’s different, settling into this new thing with Cas; even if, according to Sam, it’s really not that new. After finding out the extent of Dean’s injuries, Cas has been treating him like he could break at any moment. They’ve spent time talking, and Dean’s managed to avoid complaints about turning into a girl; out-loud, anyway.
Castiel stares down at the one bed. Of course, it’s just Dean. But all hope of possibly falling asleep watching TV and staying the night evaporate at the sight. He’d grown accustomed to there being two beds when the Winchesters got a room. “No, I think I’ll be fine.”
Leaning against the building, Castiel thinks. “Personal shopping, go to the library, walk around the lake?”
Leaning back in his chair, he surveys his desk, tidy except for the evaluations. Weekends are usually spent on work-related socializing; Golfing with clients, business luncheons, drinks in swanky clubs. Castiel really doesn't have much of a life outside of work, and returns home to a quiet apartment at the end of each day. He sighs and stands, reaching for his jacket. By Sunday evening, he’ll be ready to get back here on Monday, as socializing is draining. It's much easier to interact with others within the constraints of an office environment.
After Dean turns the corner, Castiel glances at Meg to see her staring at him, one eyebrow raised and a smirk on her lips. He hides behind his coffee, taking a sip before he asks, "What?"
Thanks to Liv, Ayaa, Jus, and the others in Thirst channel on the Discord server who accidentally prompted, then encouraged the seed framing of this scene. Darence fandom, I'm getting there!
“Cas?” Sam rocks stiffly out of his chair and comes to the door to wrap his arms around Castiel, who still has yet to move from the doorway. Leaning heavily against him, Sam says with a tired voice, “I’m glad you’re here, man.”
Dean’s voice has risen, and Cas places a hand on his arm. “Dean, Emma means a lot to me too, and that’s why I think she should help Sam.”
Sam leads Cas back to Dean’s room, where he appears peaceful in his drug-induced slumber. Another wave of exhaustion rolls over Sam, and he suggests they both go back to Jody’s for food and showers.
Might be a little OOC, IDK, but Dean's learning new habits. re-thinking how life's supposed to work.
They’re both panting, the taste of each other lost to the spray of water, hips slip-sliding together with their mutual rhythm, one of Dean’s hands guiding Castiel’s hips. “Cas,” Dean breathes into his ear, “Touch me,
“Yeah. Look,” Sam turns around, running a hand through his hair. “I talked with Jody. It’s really in Dean’s best interests if he doesn’t know about… what we do… quite yet, so I need to square some things up.”
They never catch any fish on the dock, and Dean couldn’t tell you how long they’re out there, but the sunset glow eventually shifts to a cloudless night, the sky full of stars. Their chairs get traded out for a soft blanket, and they lie there, fingers entwined, gazing upward.
They stay on the phone together while Castiel finishes his pasta, and he puts it on speaker while he washes his few dishes. They don’t really talk about much else, and just keep each other company. Castiel mentions that his wrist is feeling better, and the brace helps him be able to work, since making drinks isn’t very labor intensive. Dean complains about other drivers, talks through how far he can go on what’s left in the gas tank, and debates different routes back to the bunker.
“Yeah, I still can’t get past that this is how you chose to lay low from the other angels,” Dean raises an eyebrow, “It’s some cover.”
Nodding, Castiel keeps them walking in the direction of the Moose Lounge. “Yes, Really.” Dean pulls out his phone, taking multiple pictures while Castiel grabs his arm when he almost walks into a pole. Castiel has never actually been inside before, and finds the interior cool and dark. Dean’s grin grows wider as he spots a moose head mounted on a wall, lights wrapped around the antlers.
After they’ve tidied everything, Dean rocks back on his heels, hands in his pockets. Should he just go? Wait to be dismissed? Should he ask if his boss wants to grab a drink or…
Cas is shaking his head, but Dean keeps going. “Yeah, I know, Empty deal, happiness, whatever. The thing is, I…”
That attracts the attention of both man and beast, Miracle off the bed and down the hall in a flash. Cas looks so happy, and Dean wants to bottle this moment forever. Cas looks back at him, and he doesn’t have a big smile or anything, he just… radiates contentment. “I’ll go make coffee.”
Dean pulls away and bites his lip. “I think you need to sober up a bit. The lake’s just a block away, right?”
“Dean,” Cas breathes, sitting next to him. “I would love to participate in physical intimacy with you.”
Setting down his pole, Cas turns to Dean. “I can’t really explain. I remember being sucked into the Empty, and then… nothing. Then Jack awakened me in Heaven, asking for assistance with restructuring.”
“Grab a pair of sweats, and feel free to use the sink before you pull them on.” He hopes that came out casual and didn’t sound needy.
Castiel hums in reply. Only a few scenes into the third movie, Dean changes the channel. “Sorry, I, um, don’t feel like seeing that one right now.”
Hands sweating, Castiel steps out the door and walks to where Dean had parked yesterday. He’s nervous, because he doesn’t understand why Dean might have stayed. Was there a problem with disposing the body? Was there another incident? Standing at the back of the building, he nervously wipes his hands on his jeans.
Dean’s lips press into a thin line, obviously in disapproval, and Castiel tries to not notice the dimples that form with the expression. Before Dean can reply, Jolene comes over to their table.
“So… Cas,” Dean leans closer and Castiel reciprocates, bringing their faces closer together. “We can’t stay here all night, and it’s starting to get crowded.”
Setting the cup near Castiel, Jolene pulls up a stool and sits across from him. “I made that for you, seen you fix it for yourself before.”
Waiting was harrowing. There were few updates, and as the day passed, Sam wondered if he should have just let Dean make his damn speech. He’d answered he couldn’t remember how many questions about how and where Dean got injured, talked to the cops, had about half a dozen cups of very bad coffee, then remembered to get his phone out of the car to… to what? He didn’t know if they needed to plan Dean’s recovery or his funeral. Hiding in a quiet corner near the chapel, he FaceTimed Eileen.
“Thank you, Dean.” A spike of pettiness flares through him. “Although it would have been better if I could have had some stability while learning to be more human.”
A nurse enters the room, Cas on her heels. She tries to get Dean to open his eyes, who seems to resist the idea, until she turns off the overhead light. Slowly, Dean manages to open his eyes, and looks to Sam, who gives his hand a squeeze. With the nurse here, he’s unsure how much to say, so he just gives Dan one of their knowing looks they’ve come to share over the years.
He’s done this before and knows to first look for the homeless resources. With a temporary computer pass, Castiel finds a couple of places he can check out tomorrow. The rest of the day is spent exploring the park, and finding a good place where he can settle for the night atop a wooded hill overlooking the water.
Well versed in the art of masturbation, Dean recognizes the signs of impending release and encourages it, whispering, "I've got you, Cas," doing what he likes best on himself. It's with a groaning cry that Cas comes into Dean's hand, and the effect is so overwhelming it nearly drives him to come on the spot too. He picks up the pace on his own grinding, no shame or thought to the idea of coming in his pants.
Finding the two kids is easy enough, and for a minute Sam thinks they might escape without a fight until they see a row of masked figures standing at the entrance. There’s at least half a dozen, and some are bigger than Sam. This is gonna be a close one. After sending the two kids out the back, they engage the vampires.
Okay. They expected that he might have some short-term loss, but the grim look on Dr. Cameron’s face says there’s more to it than just that. “How bad is it?” Sam asks.
, Castiel thinks but doesn’t say. He looks down at his apron, the blond fringe of the wig falling over his eyes. “I didn’t bring a change of clothes,” he says, glancing up at Dean, who turns to look at him with another of those dazzling grins.
Dean gets up first, and places a kiss on Cas’ crown, where the hair has gotten pretty thin. They’ve both gotten lucky with their hair, mostly just going silver and receding at the temples with some thinning. Better than Sam at least. Poor guy’s hair has receded so far back, you’d think he was the older brother. But then he hadn’t been resurrected from the dead as many times as Dean had. Maybe it’s a side perk? He’d hate to see how bad his knees or back would be without all that healing mojo in his thirties.
Happiness swells in Castiel’s chest at the thought of Dean making plans to accommodate his wishes back at his home. And while Castiel has enjoyed the rough texture of Dean’s stubble, the thought of touching Dean’s clean shaven face sends a tingle through him. He imagines standing close to Dean, spreading shaving cream across his cheeks, being allowed to drag a razor across his skin, Dean’s neck exposed as a sign of trust— “Cas!”
Crossing his arms, Dean faces Sam straight on, feet braced apart. He knew that phone call was suspicious. “I have a feeling you’re going to tell me what you have planned, without asking me first.”
Blinking, Castiel looks at Meg who is smirking up at him from her desk. "No, I have work to do." And with that, Castiel goes into his office and sits down at his desk, where a huge grin breaks out on his face.
How is it that Dean manages to be exactly what he needs? Castiel pulls out a chair. “Or, you could help me now, and I can get someone to finish distributing the mail.” Dean glances up at him in surprise. Knowing food is an effective motivator, Castiel adds, “I’ll order lunch for you as well.”
“Honey, you’ve been my best worker since you started. Let me go see if I can get Isaac to cover for you tomorrow, and you were already scheduled to take the next day off, so I don’t see a problem.”
Arriving at the apartment building he’ll call home for the next couple of months, Dean texts his contact that he’s here. He gets buzzed in, and directed to the ninth floor, apartment E. He knew he’d be sharing quarters, but he doesn’t expect to see so many of the other interns crammed into the living room. There’s seven of them, and they all greet him warmly.
It’s bad, and it reminds him of the case where they found Alex. Raising kids to be used as food. Sam shudders.
In the car, they intertwine their fingers, hands resting between them. As they drive, the light turns a deeper hue, edging closer to sunset. Down the road, they pass by a lake and he stops near a dock, a folding chair and some fishing gear at the end, as if it were waiting for him. It’s a place that has an actual memory, a place in his dreams, one that Cas once visited.
the burger, Cas.” He points to the menu. “This one here, it has avocado. Not my thing, but…” Pursing his lips, his eyes roam the menu and he points at something else. “This one has fried egg. Don’t think I want that either…” Dean’s voice trails off, absorbed by his choices once again.
It seems fitting, to use the table as a memorial of sorts. Taking his folding knife out of his pocket, the same one Cas used to cut his hand for the sigil, Dean starts carving the C of Cas’s name into the table. He’ll do the whole thing, not just the abbreviation, he deserves that at least. Sam sits and watches until he’s done. Just that action took  a lot out of him, so Dean gets up and gestures at the knife.
The officer shrugs, tells Dean to report any suspicious activity, and leaves. Locking the door and leaning against it, Dean lets out a breath and massages his temples. It’s going to be a long day, and he needs coffee. He also leaves the news off until after Cas gets up and turns it on himself. It’s more of the same, with major cities having erected camps for collection and destruction of androids. It’s genocide. There hasn’t been any activity from the deviant group who marched in Detroit since that freighter that was supposedly their base went down.
Cas looks away again. “He said it was possible, but he needed me here. And… I,” He swallows. “I didn’t think I wanted to hear your answer if I returned. I thought… you didn’t…”
Castiel is settled down for the night in the Gas n Sip stock room, curled up in his sleeping bag when his phone dings, letting him know he has a text message. It’s short but alarming:
“No, Dean.” Castiel places a hand on his shoulder. “Ephraim would have found me regardless. At least this way, you were there. Otherwise, I might have—” Unable to finish that sentence, Castiel turns back to his beer.
Riding in Dean’s car feels different now, and Castiel sits primly in the passenger seat, hands on his thighs. Dean keeps glancing at him as they head to the north part of town. At a red light Dean finally turns to face him. “Dude, are you gonna wear the wig to a crime scene?”
He’s not expecting Dean to offer a place next to him on the couch. Sitting beside Dean, Castiel watches what appears to be the renovation of a bathroom. He wonders if perhaps it reminds Dean of the year he lived with Lisa. He considers asking Dean if he remembers anything, but holds his tongue. The doctor said they’re not supposed to try to force the memories. It surprises him when Dean brings it up on his own, not due to familiarity, but noticing Castiel’s hesitation. Had Castiel been that obvious, even in his silence? He explains the similarities in as vague terms as possible.
Some of the Alternate World's hunters come back, claiming that they had trouble integrating to this new world, so they find unoccupied rooms, help keep the place running.
Dean’s head lands on Castiel’s shoulder, and he huffs. “You know what happens with two guys, right?”
Dean watches as Cas turns toward the sink. Yeah. “I promise we’ll fix that as soon as Warden Sam says I’m allowed to drive again. We’ll go somewhere and get you something that fits better.”
“I’ll need to update your alarm code so you can set the perimeter alarm but not the interior. Oh, and just in case, if you ever
“Yeah. They transferred him to Sioux Falls General. If it weren’t for Jody... “ Sam pauses, and Castiel can hear him breathe into the phone. “Listen. I’m not sure what’s up with you right now, but if you want to come, I can tell them you’re family.”
A smile lighting his face, Dean comes over to the empty seat. “Well, since you’re offering to feed me.”
“With breakfast.” Shifting so that he’s not lying entirely on Castiel, Dean’s chin digs into his shoulder. “The coffee’s not as good as the cafe, but it should be enough to help start on the hangover you probably have.”
He thinks. “Dean? Hello. It’s Cas.” This is awkward. “Sam said you wanted to see me? Well, I’m here. When you wake up.”
“Fine.” Castiel is done arguing. “There’s someone coming in ten minutes, and I’ll see if they’ll cover for me.”
While Castiel borrows a razor and some shaving cream to remove his scruff, Dean finishes drying off in the shower stall. He watches Castiel wipe away the last of the cream from his freshly shaved face and says,  “A smile looks good on you.”
It sends him into a spiral of negative thoughts throughout most of Dean’s nap. Is he expected to stay? Should he prepare to leave? Where will he go?
Accepting the money, Castiel steps back out the door and finds the vending machines. He purchases a root beer for Dean, and a Sprite for himself. The snack vending machine is well stocked, and Castiel gets Dean’s microwave popcorn, a bag of pork rinds, and a package of licorice. Dean likes licorice. Back in the room, the air conditioner is chugging, and Dean is already propped up against the headboard on one side of the bed, bottle of whiskey on the side table next to two glasses. He waves the remote at Castiel as he carefully places the drinks and snacks on the comforter.
Dean bumps into the cart before he gets it moving again and he looks at Castiel with one last smile before disappearing around a corner. Meg sighs heavily behind him. "Okay, loverboy. He's gone now. Are you going to stand next to my desk all day?"
Castiel blinks. They’ve had this discussion before, microwaves don’t emit nuclear radiation. But it’s a colloquialism apparently, and he’s learned to not argue semantics with Dean about slang terms. After carefully reading the instructions, he places the packet into the device as shown, and sets the timer. The TV comes on while he watches the popcorn rotate, and Dean starts changing channels.
One hand still holding onto Dean's, Cas uses the other to hold Dean's chin, turning him to face his expression of… wonder? Hope? Happiness? It's hard to tell, because Cas starts kissing him.
Rocking together, their lengths encircled in Dean’s grip, Castiel clings to him through the wave and crash of his orgasm. Dean soon follows, his breath fast and hot against his neck, everything warm and wet between them. The weight of the man he loves presses down as Dean’s arms give out, and Castiel holds onto him, the last shudders of orgasm fading into a drowsy state. It’s like this, in what he feels is the perfect moment, that Castiel falls asleep.
. Castiel knows, better than anyone, that there’s always the next crisis, something always looming on the horizon. He’s just a human now, and of no use to the Winchesters as he is, regardless of Dean’s affirmations to the contrary. Just another mouth to feed, someone else to get hurt. Moisture wells up in Castiel’s eyes, and his breath hitches as he tries to not cry.
He hears Dean’s footsteps before he sees him, another coffee cup in hand and a croissant wrapped in wax paper in the other. Dean’s wearing a blue canvas jacket this time, over a red and white check shirt. Face lighting up with a smile, he ambles over and looks Castiel over.
He’s tried falling asleep next to Cas while watching movies he’s already seen hundreds of times, but Cas just wakes him up and says he should go to bed if he’s tired, that falling asleep while sitting up might strain something. Dammit, Dean may be more open to talking about things, but he draws the line in… asking for
Downstairs is a pretty nice laundry facility, which works out since almost everything he has is wash-and-wear. Hey, he’s just an intern, with his senior year at Cal Poly coming up after the summer. He can’t afford dry-cleaning. Getting a paid internship was a nice bonus though, as he’ll need to save all he can, as his scholarship is just barely enough to cover all his expenses.
“But this is my fault, Dean. They’re still my family and I want to help. Can I really afford to sit this one out?”
The afternoon is spent poring over geographical surveys of the region, looking for caves and other places wildlife might nest. It’s while studying Google Maps that Dean finds the old cabin. They decide to not wait another night, and go check it out. They really should have waited.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay, Cas.” Dean slips out of his chair and kneels before the other. “We were both a couple of dumbasses.”
Dean’s arousal presses against his own length, and Castiel shudders, his eyes fluttering closed as their foreheads touch. “Too much?” asks Dean, loosening his grip.
“Don’t stop,” Dean whines, fingers digging into the flesh of Castiel’s ass as he chases his own release, which he finds soon after.
Glancing at the clock, Dean sees it’s a couple minutes after five. Holy crap, where did the time go? He glances to see Castiel blinking at Meg in surprise as well.
There isn’t time in his life for intimate relationships, and one-night-meetups have always felt classless to him. So here he is, thinking inappropriate thoughts about one of his company’s interns, who is about to walk through that door any minute. Thankfully Dean appears to have taken his suggestion of showing up late today. By the time he does show up, Castiel is composed again, and is trying to reorganize the schematics.
When Castiel looks up at Dean, he catches the young man licking his lips as he looks down Castiel’s body.  “Huh?” Dean responds, before looking back up to meet Castiel’s eyes. “Oh, yeah, sure. We can take care of that.”
Wiping away the beginnings of tears at the corners of his eyes, Castiel carefully changes back into his pink shirt and apron, setting aside the shirt and tie that Dean loaned him; then he grabs the things he’ll need to make the pizza crust. He remembers the sandwiches he made for the brothers Winchester before the attack on Roman Enterprises. Unfortunately, he also remembers spending a year in Purgatory, and Dean’s attempt to pull him out.
Before he can ask more, there’s a knock at the door. Jody rushes in, seeing Dean’s awake. Sam feels a twinge of irrational jealousy at the caring touches she gives Dean. But Sam snaps out of it when she directs a question at him about the hospital asking about the incident. Thankfully, she’s kept them off their backs so far, and he tells her so.
Dean’s first instinct is to reject the idea, both at the thought that he had potential and being compared to the girl, but Cas keeps going.
Dean goes on to talk about when they were kids, growing up, Sam’s fight with Dad, and when Dean came for him at Stanford. Why is Dean wasting time talking when Sam can be getting help? In his mind he prays fervently for Jack, even though he’s supposed to be hands-off. He HAS to try.
If he were still an angel, he could heal Dean. But he’s not. Why is he even here? As if Sam could hear his thoughts, he shifts and reaches for Dean’s hand. “Hey, Dean? Cas is here. You’d like to see him, wouldn’t you?”
Cas launches into a dissection of the movie, talking about how the young man was a warrior who frequently wore a trenchcoat and was devoted to a young woman who knew what she wanted out of life, and how they spent the beginning of their relationship as friends, even though they were attracted to each other. And after they consummated the relationship with sex, she broke up with him, until she realized her father wasn’t the man she thought she was, and asked the young man to take her back. Then, they faced a new future together.
Through Dean’s hitching, gurgling breaths and Sam’s sobs, Dean tells him how proud he is, Sam says he can’t do it alone, and Dean says he’ll never be alone. He has Eileen, and he should find the life he deserves, and to never give up, always keep fighting.
No one could ever call their relationship normal, so Dean throws out the rulebook and tells Cas they can take things at their own pace. But it’s still too slow for Dean’s tastes. Now that they know how they feel about each other, Dean wants to do the things that, uh,
Back in the bunker, the silence feels almost deafening. Sam manages to get off the phone with Eileen long enough to sort through sending out mass messages to everyone in their circle of contacts. By the time he’s done, it’s late and Dean’s halfway through a bottle of whiskey, minus the glass.
After taking a drink and thinking, Sam says, "You know, with Chuck not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own. There’s just you and me, going wherever the story takes us.”
Clearing his throat, Castiel straightens his spine. "That's inappropriate," he says, before turning to go back into the office, the Anderson files forgotten.
“Where they have a horse ranch. Anyway, I told them about you, and I think it would be a great place for you to finish recuperating.”
“What if you hadn’t been forced to remember, Cas?” Sam asks. “Wouldn’t you have been happier if we hadn’t dragged you back into all this?”
Curious, Castiel picks up the cup and takes a tentative sip. Green tea with honey. “Thank you,” he says, looking down at the lid. Jolene’s been so kind. He will hate having to move on from this place. But at least he has a viable skill now.
Oh, and I guess I should note that the calendar fits with 2016, mostly because I wanted a Monday holiday.
Wide-eyed and excited, Dean looks around at all the stainless steel. “You mean you can make something other than desserts and muffins?”
He’s half surprised when Cas actually rejoins him back in bed, and they spend a little time just being close, not really talking about much of anything. They’re interrupted by the sound of a jingling dog collar, with pawing and snuffling at their door.
Dean leans his head on Castiel’s shoulder, away from the spray, and Castiel rests his head against Dean’s, catching his breath. He closes his eyes and devotes this moment to memory. However many nights they spend apart, he wants to have this always. The water is starting to cool, so they hurriedly soap and rinse, grinning at each other the whole time.
She salutes him with the drink and leaves, revealing Dean waiting patiently with that damn smirk on his face again.
Castiel’s footsteps steady as they near the water, the fresh air and early evening sunlight helping to clear up his sluggish brain. He shows Dean the sign for the upcoming park renovation. They go down to the marina, watch a boat get pulled out of the water, and turn around at the beach because there are too many people.
Questions swirling in his head, Sam jumps when a hand lands on his shoulder. Cas is standing behind him, looking at him with a solemn expression. “We’ll get through this together, Sam.”
Cas places a hand on Dean’s knee, looking at him soulfully. “And I would also like to wake up next to you.”
He realized, if Eileen passed, Sam might be along soon. And Dean knew the perfect place to meet him.
At 4 a.m. as promised, Jolene arrives with her arms full of bags and boxes. She hands a cylindrical box over to Castiel and he holds it by the handle, staring at it blankly. “What am I supposed to do with this?” he asks.
Thinking back to a lesson he learned from Frank Deveraux years ago, Dean puts on a smile, pats Sam on the back, and grabs his keys so they can get some supplies for the bunker, and for Miracle.
With a small smile, Castiel takes a picture of the stylized moose logo and is halfway to sending it to the Winchesters, when it dawns on him that they probably won’t care to receive anything from him. Mood deflated and an ache in his heart, Castiel turns south once again and doesn’t look up until he comes to the intersection that ends at the parking lot of a lakeside park. The park extends left, so he follows the street towards an adjacent library.
Smiling at Dean’s odd behavior, Castiel thanks him and watches as he fumbles with the doorknob and backs out the door, saying he’ll be right back. It’s not often he sees Dean flustered. Now if he only knew why. Castiel stands, thinking now is a good a time as any for a shower, and it’s not until he’s in the bathroom that he finally realizes he’s only wearing his boxers.
Ah, that makes more sense. “I think that sounds enjoyable. I only have a small TV that receives local channels in my room.”
With as much tact as he can muster, Castiel explains to Sam that he’s not as healthy as he thinks, that an angel is still healing him. Confused, Sam asks how.
Fully aware he’s going to have to wipe the grease off later, Sam slides his phone across the table to Dean. “Hey, check this out.” His phone is zoomed in on the important part of an article where someone is describing catching a ‘mutant bear’ rummaging through a campground’s trash.
Another customer comes in, ordering a flavored iced tea and chocolate cookie to go. Dean places his pie plate in the bus-bin, and leans against the counter on his elbows. It makes him look vulnerable, and Castiel wonders if Dean is trying to manipulate him. ‘
Castiel gathers his shopping bags, and closes the Impala’s door. Dean’s gripping the wheel tightly, frowning. When he sees Castiel lean to look in through the window, he gives a little wave, which Castiel returns. There’s an awkward moment where Castiel stands there with his armload of groceries, eyes locked on Dean’s through the car’s window. But then Dean blinks, gives him a small smile, and starts her up. With a final nod, he backs out of the parking spot and drives away.
“Yes.” Unsure how to react to Dean’s tone (is that disappointment?), Castiel takes a long drink of his beer.
“Oh.” Dean shifts from foot to foot, hands clasped, head lowered. “If you like… I could… come back when I’m finished?”
It doesn't make watching the rest of the movie any easier, and he still has secondhand embarrassment as he can't help but make comparisons to his own screw ups. When they get to the scene where Rob makes a compilation tape, Cas squeezes his hand. Shit, he forgot about this part. He refuses to turn his eyes away from the screen through the terrible proposal. Cas starts stroking his knuckles with his thumb, and Dean realizes he's been clenching again, so releases the remote and turns his hand, threading their fingers together. As Jack Black begins to sing, Dean takes the opportunity to glance at Cas, who's smiling. Okay. Yeah. That's good.
He rushes into his office, grabbing a couple of envelopes that need to go out before end of day. “I don’t have stamps, and Meg usually handles those things, so I hope that’s alright?”
When he rounds the doorway, there's Cas, standing at the make table with his hands resting on the edge, head down. Dean brings the bucket over, places it on the steel surface with a clang, and wraps Cas up in his arms from behind. He can feel the tension drain out of his body, and he buries his face in the crook of Cas's neck, seeking comfort too. Cas makes a noise and tilts his to the side.
Uneasy with the thought of having his belongings discovered at work without him there, Castiel had brought everything with him. That being the case, all he places in the back of her car is a duffel bag and a tightly rolled sleeping bag. During the drive, Jody tries to make conversation.
She was more than just a machine, and she’d quickly developed her own personality outside of her “Chloe” programming. Just like a Winchester, she’d become independent, questioning, and at times self-sacrificing to do what she thought was right. So Dean had vowed to help make her life better, have meaning. If he thought of her as a daughter, well that was none of Sam’s damn business.
He sits down on the couch, eyes glued to the screen. They’re talking about terrorism, even though nobody was hurt, according to early reports. So far no channels are showing the full broadcast of the speech, but Dean knows Emma will be able to get it, if she’s not already downloaded it.
The next morning he wakes up face-down on the table, head throbbing and back sore. At least it’s not on the floor this time. The bottle is empty, so he’ll need to get up and get another for some hair of the dog. Speaking of dog, there’s a furry warmth curled at his feet, and oh yeah, they’ll need some stuff like food and bowls if they’re going to keep Miracle.
Having long learned to read Dean’s mind about such matters, Cas asked, “Are you sure you don’t want to go alone?”
The rest of the day is spent at the library checking more videos and trying to flesh out his background story. If there’s one thing he’s learned from not only the Winchesters, but his time as a homeless person, it’s that you need a good background story to tell other people. Castiel nervously watches the clock, and shows up at the shop ten minutes before five.
I also put a lot of thought into how to label this, between Mature or Explicit. It was decided it wasn't quite explicit enough, but it's very steamy IMHO.
Making good time on the highways, since Dean refuses to use interstates when he can help it, they stop for dinner just south of Des Moines. There’s a Biggerson’s here, and even though they’ve had their share of incidents in the chain, at least the menu’s consistent.
Heart in his throat, he tries to form words. “What… what’s happened?” is all he manages to choke out.
“Hey, Sammy.” He turned around, and there was Sam, just like he looked when Dean last saw him, but wearing the clothes he wore when Dean first picked him up from Stanford.
This one has a widescreen TV for sports events, and they’re close enough to hear it when the news comes on. There’s been some kind of disturbance over towards the Nebraska border, campers missing, the usual. It’s when there’s mention of some kind of mutant bear that Sam’s ears perk up. Curious, he pulls out his phone and starts checking out news feeds for more information. It’s a local paper for a town near the wilderness area that catches his attention.
“I don’t regret last night. If that’s all that ever happens, because if you do regret it, that’s fine. I will never speak of it again, if that’s what you wish.”
Castiel looks down at her, noticing that even she is dressed slightly more casually in a soft, flowy cotton top, a tailored leather jacket over the back of her chair.
When his fingers stroke along Cas's lower abdomen, he feels his hips rock forward. So he explores further, fingertips dipping just under the waistband, and Cas growls. Oh yeah, it's on. Bolder now, he whispers encouragement in Cas's ear, as he palms the hard length straining against the already snug front of his pants. Hips snap sharply forward, Cas letting out a shout at the contact.
They stay in place through the Thanksgiving holiday, and watch as the president invites Markus and his close counsel to the White House. They pardon a turkey, and Markus shares the Manfred family pumpkin pie recipe, with Carl’s blessing. President Warren stirs up a scandal when she offers Markus the Presidential Medal of Freedom as well. Sam makes it down on Thursday for dinner, and all the androids on the farm toast each other with blue blood.

The rest of the ride to the hospital is tensely quiet, and Castiel feels relieved when he’s dropped off in front of the building, Jody saying she’ll be back after work to check up on things. Already knowing Dean’s room number, Castiel avoids the front desk and looks for the elevator.
Once having relieved himself and washed his face, Castiel feels less like something not quite alive. Exiting the bathroom, he finds Dean at the table, sliding a coffee cup toward the other seat, where a wrapped sandwich is waiting. “The diner up the street has these kick-ass grilled sourdough sandwiches.” Dean starts unwrapping a second one. “Egg, sausage, cheese,
At the sound of Dean’s pained groans, Miracle puts his front paws on Dean’s lap and thoroughly gives him a tongue bath. That finally breaks the dam and Dean grabs onto the dog, letting out deep sobs, tears dampening the tan fur. When it finally subsides, Dean lets go, only to be assaulted with more smelly dog breath and a wet tongue.
Cas returns the kiss, and there’s that want for more. “You know,” Dean says against Cas’s lips, “We can always get started on that sex part.”
Inside, he sees Sam at the dining table, sorting through weapons in his duffle bag. “Is something wrong, Sam?”
Unlocking his good hand from around Dean’s shoulder, Castiel slips it down Dean’s chest, to where Dean is gripping their lengths tight. He takes over the action, and Dean shudders, nipping at Castiel’s shoulder with a moan. He’s so close, breathing erratic, heart pounding in his chest; and when Dean reaches lower to cup his sac, it’s as if he explodes, sparks flashing behind his eyes as it grows slicker between them, his hips losing their rhythm.
Dean turns towards the bed and prepares the covers, so Castiel moves to give him privacy, turning off the hall light as he passes the switch. It’s late, so Castiel checks the perimeter of the house, making sure the doors are locked, the salt lines are intact, and that the devil’s trap rugs are in place, then prepares for bed as well.
After a long day of sitting in awkward silence and watching Dean sleep, Jody arrives, insisting they come to her house for food and showers. During the drive, Castiel sits next to his meager belongings, behind Jody and Sam who converse quietly about Dean’s condition. He has nothing to add to the conversation, and once again wonders why he’s even here.
She glances around the kitchen. “Well, you cleaned up pretty good. I guess that explains the sad state your wig is in then.”
His phone rings a few minutes later, and he suddenly feels nervous. When he answers, Dean immediately tries to convince him to not get involved. “But they’re angels, Dean. I can help.”
“I’m glad. He seemed well when…” How does he finish that sentence? A petty part of him wants to say, ‘when you kicked me out.’ But what good would that do? Dean will leave soon, and he wants to enjoy this time together.
It’s hot in here, and he’s tacky with sweat. While Dean lays out bandages and salve, Castiel uses his good hand to unbutton the collar of his shirt and flap it for some air circulation. If he had the motivation, he’d go turn on the ventilation.
“Hmm?” Dean glances up, and the light above the table catches his eyes like crystal jade. “Because they’re always coming up with different things to put
Maybe what Dean needs is another hunt to get his head on straight again. But it’s been spookily quiet. Almost like whatever Jack did calmed down the world for a little while. Fresh out of a shower after a run, Sam heads to the library and finds Dean at his computer, intently staring at something, Miracle in the chair next to him, never very far.
very good. Neither man says much else while they eat, or look directly at each other, and Dean even slows down when his sandwich is almost finished, as if he’s avoiding whatever happens next. While Castiel chews the last of his sandwich, he wonders if this is when Dean will tell him that last night was a mistake. He watches as Dean finishes, wipes his mouth, and clears his throat as he rolls the napkin into a ball.
Over time, they share small moments like this, short messages, and daily calls. It’s not as much as either of them would like, but they get by. If Castiel is feeling insecure, Dean is but the touch of a button away.
Dean swallows as he pulls the envelopes from Castiel's hand, fingertips lingering. "Have a good weekend, Boss," he says, tucking the envelopes into the "Outgoing" slot on the cart.
“Hmm.” Dean raises his beer, his voice hoarse when he speaks. “To everyone that we lost along the way.”
When Dean hands Castiel the remote, he wonders what they should watch. He hasn’t bothered with much television himself, other than the news and a couple afternoon shows. While scrolling through the menu, he spies a show that features monster hunting similar to what the Winchesters do for a living. Is it considered forcing a memory if they watch a fictional story similar to their own lives? Dean notices what he’s paused on, and Castiel rushes to explain his decision. Dean seems willing to watch the show, so he clicks on it.
Where the incident took place isn’t difficult to find, with an area by the yellow buses cordoned off, and law enforcement at the scene. There’s even someone in a hazmat suit. They get out of the car, and Dean instructs Castiel to follow his lead. Dressed in a white shirt and tie, Castiel smooths his hand down the green and blue striped polyester that Dean had tied at his throat.
Castiel has felt fear before. But his reaction at those words is unlike anything he has yet to experience. He’s immediately awash with cold and his scalp tingles.
At dawn, Castiel makes his way to a place called Fresh Start which offers resources, breakfast, and showers. There he receives kind words from the staff, the aforementioned meal and shower, as well as a handful of pamphlets before heading back to the library. Along the way he passes a cafe and bakery with a sandwich board sign on the sidewalk, with a message written on it:
When Dean wakes up, it’s with the desperate need to pee. But he’s warm, and comfortable, and… spooning? He groggily opens his eyes and recognizes the head of dark hair, the curve of an ear, and the neck splotched with the marks he left last night in the kitchen.
Three episodes in, Dean is asleep on Cas’ shoulder, and Cas presses a soft kiss to his brow before turning the volume down and switching to the news again. The feed is alive with events happening live in Detroit, where androids have barricaded themselves at Hart Plaza. With closed captioning on, Cas leans his head against Dean’s and watches them make their bid for freedom. Lids heavy, Cas stays awake long enough to see them not only succeed, but the president offers to create a committee that will determine if androids are alive. Of course, there isn’t much trust in government committees, but the fact that they’re no longer destroying androids, and at least considering their sentience, is a start.
“We? You still with your friend?” She stresses the word friend, like she’s expecting… Castiel isn’t sure what, but he’s too tired to parse it. Oh, there’s something he should mention, he thinks, staring down at his hand.
Cas faces forward in his seat, hands clasped between his knees. “I’m the young man in the coat, Dean. A warrior with principles, who found… someone who fascinated him.” He turns to Dean. “I know you hate being compared to a female in any way, but when we met, you overflowed with purpose and potential.”
When the door closes behind her, Castiel lets out a deep sigh. “Do you have any idea how hard it’s been? Falling to Earth, losing my Grace, I… had nothing.”
The angel explains Sam’s condition, how weak he really is, and how much effort it takes to keep him functional. It’s apparently difficult to keep any extra power while trying to keep Sam mobile and healing. Castiel knew it was bad before, when Dean had first explained, but the thought chills him.
Dean and Cas went to bed late and slept fitfully, to be awakened by the local police banging on their door. Dean lets Cas stay in bed as he goes to the door to tell the police they’ve already sent their androids off, and there are no more on the grounds or in the house. When the officer asks to come inside, Dean’s tempted to refuse him, but he’s learned to curb his attitude towards authority as he’s aged. When the cop asks about the amount of firepower they have around the house, Dean replies:
No. Sam cuts off that train of thought, because it’s not fair right now. Laptop in hand, he stands up and walks to the door. Stopping, he looks Dean, then back at Cas. “I’ll keep my phone on, so feel free to give me a yell if…” He’s not even sure how to finish that, but Cas seems to understand, and tells Sam to rest well. With nothing else to say, Sam walks out the door and down the hall to the elevators.
“Dean.” Cas pulls Dean forward into a hug, and that aggravates his damn injury, causing him to hiss.
When Dean asks Castiel if he needs to go to work, he can’t hold back a bitter laugh. Oh, he’s already used what little goodwill was left between he and Nora and has called to apologize as well as give Jody’s address for his last check. He will give it to Jody for expenses upon its arrival. He wonders where he’ll go when they decide he’s no longer needed here. Right now, nothing is more important than Dean’s health and safety, and he tells him so.
Jolene shows him how to put on the wig cap, and how to make sure the wig stays in place. He’s already wearing his pink shirt and brown apron, so she steps back and takes a good look at him. ”We’ll need to make sure you stay clean shaven since your hair’s so dark, but I think you look good.”
Wednesday morning finds Castiel holed up in a small conference room surrounded by papers, laptop open, and the projection screen filled with diagrams. They’ve been trying to get a contract for a major automobile manufacturer, and Castiel is beginning to reconsider his stance on checking everything over. He started this company working on business and computer software engineering. This is… well, he knows almost nothing about vehicles.
Cas asks if they can send them to the old Men of Letters bunker in Lebanon, but that’s not a good idea either. It’s currently in use by the new MoL, and you can’t just stack up and store deviant androids like cordwood for however long it’s necessary. It could be months.
felt about last night. Worrying the edge of the coffee lid with a fingernail, he glances up at Dean. “Do you? Regret it, I mean.”
Nodding, Castiel dials Meg’s extension on the conference phone and asks her to find someone to finish Dean’s deliveries.
Castiel lets out a laugh in a burst, shaking his head. Dean always manages to surprise him. Then it sinks in, that Dean never mentioned how
can she be so kind and understanding? Castiel figures he was going to run anyway, so why not tell her? Not the full truth, of course, but a half-truth, edited enough so she doesn’t call the mental health professionals. He tells her there are people after him, people he once considered family, who wish him harm.
Dean watches as Castiel grasps one of those hand-sliced fancy artisanal kettle chips between two fingers and places it on his tongue before it disappears between his lips, jaw working as he chews.
Cas’s brows scrunch, his mouth turning down. Then he groans. That’s it, buddy. Time to wake up. A deep breath, and Cas opens his eyes. He blinks, then those eyes turn to Dean. For a second, Dean’s breath catches. “There you are.”
Dean rushes inside, Emma in tow, to see an urgent news report about androids having taken over a broadcast in Detroit, demanding equal rights.
Sighing, Dean sits down and extends a hand. When Cas takes it, Dean pulls him closer. “Look, I meant it when I said this isn’t about sex. I… Can we just…” Why is this so hard to ask for? Heart in his throat, he tries again. “I’d like to wake up next to you in the morning.” Taking a deep breath, he closes his eyes and waits for Cas to answer. It doesn’t take long.
Turning off the engine and silencing its rumble, Dean pulls they key out of the ignition and turns to Castiel. “I think this is one of the nicer ones I’ve stayed at for a while.”
“I really shouldn’t,” Castiel says, while thinking that Dean should stop as well, especially if he’s going to have to drive him home when this is over. But he knows better than to say anything.
“I have responsibilities here. Serving customers, maintaining the equipment and facilities, I’m even learning how to bake,” he says with a touch of pride. He’s worked hard to adapt to his new humanity.
“Shit, I’m sorry Cas. I didn’t mean…” Dean pulls on a t-shirt. “Way to go, Winchester. Come here.” He wraps his arms around Castiel’s waist. “Does it help if there were times I got irritated at you too?”
“Not particularly.” Castiel did notice a few, but most were out of his price range when he was looking.
Sam looks Dean over, then feels behind him, feels the warm blood. His hand is covered with it. He wants to move Dean, but his brother says it's straight through him. While it’s not poking out of Dean’s chest, Sam knows the damage a deep puncture can do if they remove the object. Dean’s pinned, like a butterfly. But he’s gotta do something. Maybe there’s someone who can help, or something in the first aid kit.
Castiel Novak, CEO of Novak Enterprises, surveys the new interns lined up before him: Young men and women, eager to prove themselves in the tech business world. Most are dressed smartly in pressed slacks, jackets, straight skirts. Some are obviously making do with what they have in ill-fitting and cheap or second-hand slacks and button-ups. And then there’s the young man trying to hide on the end.
The evening news is interrupted by a press conference from the president, reiterating what Dean and Cas already know about the country being under lockdown. Cas’ hand tightens around Dean’s when President Warren says that all androids are to be destroyed. A spike of worry for Emma pierces through Dean, and he wonders if he’ll ever see her again.
come over who you obviously have some history with, and I can see the way you look at him. I still think he’s an ex, by the way. Of course I would think you were getting kinky in my kitchen!”
Castiel dismisses it with a shake of his head, and feels compelled to say something before Dean moves on. "Did your suits enjoy Disney World?" is the first thing that comes to mind.
Head hanging in shame, Castiel agrees. He spends the rest of the work day finishing the sandwich cookies she had started and cleans up. After five o’clock rolls around and the shop is closed, Castiel loiters at the stainless steel work table, wiping it down over and over with a bar cloth. The door opens and Jolene comes in, carrying a cup.
Leaning forward, Dean gives him a brief kiss on the lips. “It was just supposed to be a dumb movie, but I think I’m starting to warm up to your take.”
Castiel glances around the enclosed space. It’s not incredibly large, but he supposes there could be room if they’re careful. Moving toward the back, he gestures Dean in. Grinning, Dean slips inside and ducks under the shower, splashing the water around until he’s all wet. Castiel can’t help but stare, taking in as much of the sight of Dean as he can. He’d always thought Dean was beautiful, and he still is, his strong, muscular body slightly soft in places, the cut of his hips, the curve of his legs.
With the drink complete and lid snapped in place, it is exchanged for the stated amount of currency. Perhaps, if this coffee requires special equipment, that might explain the high price? The customer turns to leave, taking a sip from his cup. With a grimace, he turns back to the counter.
, he thinks. She’s going to tell him to leave now. Because that’s what happens, he has to leave. Always.
Dean’s expression changes to something reminiscent of last night, and he takes the opportunity to look at Castiel’s body as well. “C’mere, you’re gonna get cold hiding in the corner.” He reaches out a hand.
Shit. Cas didn’t want to admit it, but Dean figured out pretty quick the guy didn’t have a regular place to sleep. Instead of actually mentioning it though, he just dragged Cas to a late-night drive through and back to his motel room, where he helped take care of his hurt hand at least, insisting Cas sleep in the extra bed too. Just to keep an eye on him. Dean had almost tried paying for a week at the motel for Cas, but didn’t know how he’d react to that. Hell, maybe the guy actually had a place, but was ashamed of it, didn’t want Dean to see it. If there’s one thing Dean understands, it’s being ashamed of where you’ve been living.
Maybe that’s what he needs right now? Dean’s in good hands between Jody and Cas. It will give Sam time to clear his head, deal with all the bombshells dropped on them in the past few days. Before he’s made it to Jody’s, Sam is calling Kevin, telling him he’ll be on his way tomorrow.
With a nod, Castiel leaves and explores the town. He finds out about the shelters, and discovers most of the temporary housing is full, and that Coeur d’Alene is apparently well known for being a haven for the homeless. As such, it’s drawn a disproportionately large indigent population. Not wanting to take a shelter bed from someone else who might need it more, Castiel plans on sleeping outdoors again, at least while the weather is nice.
Playing it cool with a “Morning boss,” as he hands over the mail, he’s rewarded with a “Good morning, Dean,” and that now-familiar zap as their fingers brush. He can’t help but smile. Waving before moving along, Dean turns the corner and starts to whistle. It’s Friday, the weekend is almost here, and he’s going to video chat with his little brother Saturday. He almost doesn’t even care that it’s supposed to storm all weekend.
Castiel stands there a moment, debating his options. He can stand here, looming over Dean until he explains himself, Jolene watching from behind the counter, or he can sit and act amicable. Pulling out and sitting in a chair across from Dean, Castiel asks, “What are you doing here?”
“Oh. Sorry, Dean. What was it?” Castiel usually isn’t this absent minded, and shakes his head to clear it.
Reminding Sam that his body is still weak and not as healed as he believes, Castiel tells Sam that there is an angel sharing his body. He doesn’t react as badly as expected, although Castiel suspects some manipulation on Gadreel’s part. After speaking with Sam, a few moments where his face is blank as he converses with the angel inside, and the explicit agreement that there will be no more taking over Sam’s body without permission, leaving him clueless, the subject turns to Dean.
Halfway through his bowl of pasta, his phone rings. It’s Dean. He quickly swallows his mouthful, and answers. “Dean? Are you alright?”
Fridays usually involve staying late, as Castiel dislikes the crush of traffic as people scramble to get home for the weekend. It's not like he has much of a life outside the office, anyway. The last thing Castiel looks at before leaving the office is the stack of weekly intern reports. They're scattered throughout the company, and after the first month, will be evaluated and switched around.
Eileen said it would just take time, and to be there for support, letting Dean know there are people here for him. But it’s been hard, with everyone else having settled in across the country, to really show Dean that network of support. That, and Dean spends more time in his room when Eileen is here.
There are some murmurs at that, and Castiel gives them a moment to settle. “I’m sure some of you are planning on travelling this weekend, and I hope you have a safe and happy Fourth. In case you haven’t heard, our company holds a celebration on the roof the evening of, with food and view of fireworks. While we cannot allow everyone attendance, two of you will be given the opportunity to join us, as a reward for exemplary performance.”
Dean’s sitting across the table, blinking at him, looking a little stunned. He clears his throat again, shifts in his seat. “Huh. I was kinda gonna give you a whole speech about mistakes made while drinking, and how if last night didn’t mean anything to you, I’d be willing to not mention it. Haha.” He grins sheepishly.
Cas nods at the TV. "That character's choices are not yours, and he had different reasons for doing the things he did. And I do not judge you for them." His hand slides up to Dean's forearm, a gentle weight. "If you really want to stop watching, we can. But I would like to finish it."
This makes him pause. Castiel had once asked Dean what he’d prefer, peace or freedom. Could this be his opportunity to give Dean both? “And you?” he asks Sam. “What will you do? Hunt behind Dean’s back for the rest of your lives?”
Sometimes he wonders. While he doesn’t like to think about his brother’s sex life, he’d always thought Dean and Cas were in an unconventional relationship. But he’d never asked then, either. He wishes he had. He knows Dean loved Cas, and Cas loved Dean, he could see it on their faces any time they were in the same room. And many times they weren’t even together. But sometimes he wondered if THEY knew it. Dean and Cas were the epitome of the relationship status “it’s complicated”.
He looks down, and Castiel dares a glance to see there’s blood dripping on the floor. Dammit. Ephraim rushes him then, grabbing his hand to prevent finishing the sigil. Castiel’s wrist gets bent backwards painfully, and it keeps going until he can feel something inside snap. There’s a sharp pain, and Castiel can’t help but cry out. At Ephraim’s whim, Castiel is pulled away from the refrigerator and down to his knees, his injured hand still in Ephraim’s painful grip.
Later in the day, Dean jumps when there’s a knock on the door. Meg is standing there, leather jacket over her arm. “You need anything else, Boss?” she asks, a strange half smile on her face, one eyebrow raised.
Castiel bows his head and thanks her, taking his first sip of hot coffee. He can tell she’s patiently waiting, as he stalls by tearing off a chunk of croissant and shoving it in his mouth. When he’s swallowed, he takes a deep breath and looks up at her. “I need to apologize for wasting baking ingredients last night, there was a mishap.”
Crawling to that side of the bed, Castiel nearly topples over reaching for Dean’s arm to pull him closer. Does he dare believe what Dean just said? “Please, say it once more so I can hear you?”
The doctor warns them to expect Dean to be unconscious more than awake for a couple of days still, because of the pain. However, he seemed lucid during her examination, which is a good sign.  “We’ll hopefully know more the next time he wakes. In the meantime, I suggest the both of you go back home and get some rest yourselves.” She looks pointedly at Sam, who is obviously the one worse for wear between him and Cas. After a few more minutes of explaining what to expect from here, she ushers them out of her office.
