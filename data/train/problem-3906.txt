to cover it," Dean says. "Where the hell did you go?"
"And I will say yes," Cas says, so in love with this fucking idiot in front of him, except he's not an idiot but the greatest genius he's ever known.
She hangs up on her end and Naomi says, "You go look for abandoned shops and buildings. I'll hold down the fort here."
!" Sam shouts in frustration, kicking a chair. He exhales into his hands and grabs the phone, telling Mick Davies to connect him to Kansas.
"She's my ex," Dean answers a little sheepishly. "I didn't know she was working at the Paris branch."
who the fuck is michael
Castiel is greeted with Gabriel’s tight hug the moment he finds him at the school gates, his embrace pulling him under shelter and out of the rain. At least the school was nice enough to give the students a ride back to the school compound instead of getting them to go home from the airport.
STOP BULLYING ME ABOUT THE RAT????
“He did,” Castiel confirms. “Okay, you can wear those for New York, but I’ll get you some new clothes for Milan and Paris.”
release him from the Cage.
bother you on Earth.
"I need to try, at least!" Dean argues. "Dallas, apply pressure and stop the bleeding. If he goes into shock, it won't matter if they give us a surgeon or not.” Dallas runs and comes back with a black T-shirt and he presses as hard as he can on Angeles's shoulder without hurting him further. Dean would try to make up a tourniquet but the wound being on the shoulder is putting a stint in that idea. The only good thing is that bullet removal would be as easy as it could possibly be as a type III injury. "Lean into it. Salem, come get me if he worsens."
I'll be online less as the date approaches, I hope you don't mind.
I’m going to bring him back.
the new Death is can rule the
can't believe ur finally 18 i love u sm cas
makes sense.
Who said you could stay out today?
Cas paces the workshop while Kevin’s fingers graze the material for Krysten Ritter’s dress. Dean leans against a worktable, pen poised, and ready over his planner notebook as his eyes follow Cas.
Sam is the praying type. Dean’s never tried except for the one time when Sam drank himself half-blind a week after Jess died and Dean prayed to God to help his brother because he doesn’t know how to.
“I worked with money,” Anael answers. It’s not like it’s a lie, she did work with money. Though, while Hannah would be thinking accountant, Anael is talking about conning people of their money.
Dean nods again and after Adam finally leaves, Dean heads back to the NOVAK building. When he returns, Cas has his coffee order waiting for him and he doesn’t ask how it goes. Instead, he asks, “Are you ready for work?”
you're going to the winchester's house later???
Should I tell him privately or in the group chat?
"And Hester?" Meg questions.
you sound so judgemental because of it
meg’s apartment isn’t that bad
And how dare you insinuate that I am part of the peanut gallery??
Dean has to stop himself from kicking the desk.
A robber and hijacker who assists with criminal escapes, currently residing in Sioux Falls
Listen, we need a new Death.
,” Dean corrects, annoyed. “And no, he doesn’t know I’m here.”
everyone makes way for the king
“Las Vegas Oscar de la Renta show,” Dean replies.
oh i see y'all met him already
this is why i like cas better
“We’ll see what you have and see what you’ll get,” the man answers.
Fine. You’ll come with us.
Dean Winchester. He seemed like a really nice guy and I invited him in. I don’t normally do that, especially since I didn’t know him, but for the worth of all flimsy rom-com excuses, he seemed different. At that moment, I didn’t know anything about him, not even his name, except that he liked parties. But it’s like I did know him. New, but familiar all the same.
“They’re my... they’re with me,” Dean says, hesitant to even use the label of ‘friends’ or ‘family’ anymore. “Your CO, Lilith, is Michael’s sister. They don’t have a good history and she acted on it.”
yes, sir.
“Awesome! We should have lunch together later. My office is at level 8 but I’ll come up to meet you,” Charlie invites. “Me, Kev and Balthazar eat together most days. Sometimes Pam, Meg and Missouri join us.”
i could but i’d rather not remember his name
Kelly moves her hand up to his shoulder, looking questioningly at him for permission. When he doesn’t object, she pulls him into a comforting hug. “I’m proud of you and I know Dean will be too. It’s always okay to back down when you’re not ready yet, you have all the time in the world to come back.”
"Clearly, you didn't scrub hard enough," Meg says. "So are you going to back off or do I have to email the devil?"
i'll pick you up from the roadhouse in 10
Sam walks into the library to see Dean PASSED OUT on the floor, a finished bottle of beer next to him.
THEY WHAT
Eileen had forged keys based on security footage Ash had hacked from the building. They're accurate enough after Ash's best attempts to enhance the footage quality so they could be of use to Eileen. They work, miraculously, and Rowena excited assists with opening the doors with her while Ash hacks his way through the codes so the door gets unlocked.
Cas turns to him, bewildered. “You cannot possibly be thinking about this.”
I like him so much.
“We all do shit when we’re drunk,” John answers vaguely, passing out two cards between them. Blackjack, then. Dean picks up the cards just as John asks, “Your brother, is he here? I heard about the new nurse.”
. You think they care about the specifics?" Meg asks, unimpressed. "A pig's a pig to them. And to me."
I love you. I’m sorry it took me
Thinking about some things.
Dean locates Cas in the office where Michael is with Gabriel, both brothers working on their diamonds, laughing as they share stories from their past. Dean doesn't really want to interrupt them but he knew Michael was right this morning, he had to talk to Cas at some point and he'd rather it be before he asked him to marry him.
easy. He doesn't even apologise if he eats the last cookie." Michael rolls his eyes, but he takes one of Adam's hands into his own and runs a thumb over his knuckles wordlessly. Adam smiles easily and adds, "Thanks for hearing him out, Dean."
Bee died today.
Even with that, Dean still lied about needing half an hour to think about it. He just needed to buy Adam time to edit the audio and leak it to a news channel. Cheers for gullible cops (sorry Sam, but kinda not really).
Castiel finds out about Pax Luck from Rowena, who he overhears laughing about Dean and Pax with Crowley over the phone. He wishes he can say he isn't surprised, but he is. He thought he and Dean had a good thing going on, honestly. He liked Dean, at least, he liked him enough to think about abandoning professionalism and asking him to dinner again but perhaps in a more romantic setting. He liked how free he felt around Dean as if he didn't have tons of things on his to-do list and he didn't have a spotlight on him whenever he left his house.
“At your desk writing your speech, I hope,” Cas replied, and Dean nodded with a grin. “Once you’ve written it, if you need a practice audience, I’ll be happy to offer my services for that, as well.”
Claire deflates and nods her understanding, but Dean’s not done yet.
Dean nods back. “If you don’t need anything else, I’m gonna turn in. Maybe draw for a bit. You’re probably gonna want a ride in the morning, right?”
“You have got to teach me how to cook,” Cas had moaned halfway through the meal. “Or just keep cooking for me every night. That works too.”
“So for the complaints, are we looking at nurses who got their ideal shift schedule out of this, or someone who got stuck in our happy little hellhole with us?” Dean asked.
“So is that supposed to be some sort of incentive for me, here? Give up an hour of work tonight and save myself having to bail on work every afternoon for the next month?”
“It’s fine, Wulf,” Louis told him. “She understands.”
It wasn’t a long drive back to the park, but Dean charged Ed with keeping an ear on the radio, as much to give him something to do other than asking questions they didn’t have good answers for as to keep tabs on their quarry. Dean stopped about a mile out from the park so they could listen to Wulf’s climactic conjuration and banishment of yet another sad death echo. When it was clear that Lorna felt it had been a successful show, and both cameramen were taking turns showing her their footage, Dean gave a glance in the back seat to exchange a nod with Cas, and then glanced at Sam before throwing the car in gear and driving the final mile.
“Dean, it’s good to see you again. And it’s only a good day for car shopping when you’ve been issued ultimatums by your landlord,” he says, glaring at Gabriel.
Cas didn’t really engage in a lot of casual happiness. Sure, he’d go along with whatever he thought would make Dean happy, but spending more than a decade mooning over Dean and getting so little back for it struck Sam as more of an act of self-flagellation than anything approaching conventional happiness. Meanwhile, Dean spent most of his time hating himself for even thinking he was entitled to get what he wanted. It was a vicious cycle that left Sam feeling exhausted after less than half an hour subjected to it. He couldn’t even imagine how Dean or Cas lived with it 24/7.
Sorry. Far as I can tell, he hasn’t been online all day.
He went back to his note to Cas, filling him in briefly on what Charlie was doing for them, and then diving right back into the story of how they’d come so close to seeing each other face to face the night before. From there he rambled on for a few pages about nothing in particular and random stories from his childhood. He lost all sense of time and place, losing himself completely in the writing.
“Fine, so neither of us has had a lot of time for celebration.”
“Yeah, I probably would’ve used an alias, too,” Sam replied in a pained voice. “He bought the curse box they’d been stored in at an estate sale last month, so I think we’re gonna have to look into the rest of the collection to make sure there’s no other random cursed objects floating around out there.”
This probably wasn’t gonna be the sort of phone call he wanted to make inside the crowded diner. He was about to slide out of the booth to step outside for a minute when Cas grabbed his wrist and held him back. When he had Sam’s startled attention, Cas spoke out loud, low, quiet, and filled with tension that Sam could see in his eyes.
be quiet, shorter winchester.
to go and now you’re
Dean grimaces and says, "And I'm sorry for that, okay? I already said that I'll never move on from that. But the rest of you, I got you out. Look, if you're this unhappy with the plan then just walk out right now, get on the next flight back to France."
holy fuck
and i set your calls to a different ringtone
I can’t, okay?
Dean had John’s phone number on a folded note that he kept hidden in his pillowcase. He never told Bobby or Ellen about it. Every once in a while, when both Bobby and Ellen were out to do groceries or work, he’d use the landline and leave a voicemail for John, asking him when he’d come back. The first time, he’d actually gotten a reply back.
“Yeah, yeah,” Castiel mutters, putting the cigarette between his lips. “Light.” Dean takes out his lighter, holding his hand up near the side of Castiel’s face to block wind as he lights up the edge of the cigarette. When it’s lit, Castiel backs off away to the window again, looking out at the dark sky. “Alright, is the jet for Paris tomorrow morning confirmed?”
"You wanted to see me?" Hester asks.
Sam picks up and sees Eileen's face pop up on the screen. He puts the phone down on the table to gesture with both hands:
i didn't think i was gonna cry today but here we are
"I'm sorry I wasn't a cooking student." Cas rolls his eyes. He dumps all the noodles into the pot and stirs it with the chopsticks that Dean insisted on getting because they looked like lightsabers. He stirs it until they begin to bend with the steam, sinking into the boiling water.
Adam confesses, “Listen, I don’t think I trust Dean very much anymore.”
“Hello?” Ketch asks once the line connects.
I heard you when I was in the
Dean had a plan for the bug -- well, not a concrete one yet. He just wants it out of his jumpsuit first and then they'll figure out what exactly to do with it when it's no longer in the room with them. Eileen signs to Michael to keep talking as she and Ash continue getting the microphone out of the woven fabric.
I’m so in love with this boy. I really am.
trusting him?
Other than that, the other robbers were beginning to get antsy after the loss of Balthazar. He knows they're concerned and perhaps even a little bit scared at the idea of being the next one in a wooden crate with a city name on the side. He's sure they're off telling each other their real names so they won't have to die as a city. Even Crowley, Meg and Dallas, who are some of the emotionally stronger people of the team, seem jittery.
“If you tell me who else was involved in the heists, I’ll let you go,” Naomi offers. “This deal isn’t easy to get and I’m handing it right over. If you’re smart, you’ll take it and walk out of this room with no consequences.”
you're right.
, which Dean is just tremendously jealous that he could get such a great username. He wishes he could get
Dean nods, writing it down next to the sketch and then raising two more squares. “These are organza and tulle. So I’m thinking that some tulle would look good on your dress. I checked with Kevin and he said you could go and visit Vera Wang with him to check out the material better...”
No matter, Dean will just get him to take it out from the magazine and then he’ll have repaired his relations with Castiel. It’ll undo his damage.
yes bee likes you better anyway
The Empty, angels and demons
They check in on Balthazar's family every three months to make sure all is well. They're getting by fine with his cut of the money and gold, thankfully. The Dalís all agreed that they would meet once a year to ensure they are all safe and well. They'd gotten the first year out of the way and their second meet-up was in two months at Meg's mansion in Madrid, Spain.
Dean nods again and says, "Salem, be ready. Put us through with Windom and sound the alarms."
"Get the hell out of there," Dallas shouts at the truck drivers and they get out, shaking in fear. Dallas and Berlin move the truck drivers to the back as Paris, Rome, and Angeles get the cop cars emptied of their passengers. While Paris and Rome hold the cops at gunpoint, Angeles opens the back doors of the truck and Dean grins at the amount of space at the back. Angeles, Dallas and Dean start loading the weaponry, real and fake ones, ammunition and explosives onto the truck and Berlin empties out the giant canisters of the blank banknote paper, kicking them to the back of the truck.
Anael was asked by the head guard, Bartholomew, to fetch John Winchester from the bus since he’s the only inmate coming in for the morning. She waits for about ten minutes until the bus finally pulls in through the gate. As expected, Lilith is in the driver’s seat, looking bored out of her mind as she stops the bus and cuts the engine. She turns in her seat and orders John to get out of the bus before she does.
The two caskets are walked out and everyone watching from outside the bank fall silent as they go.
By the time morning comes around, Meg informs Dean that they are almost at the two-billion-dollar mark. Crowley passed forty thousand kilograms a while ago. Abaddon is tied to a chair with handcuffs, waiting for him in an office surrounded by five rifles. Cas comes with him as second-in-command to discuss anything, leaving Sam to guard the hostages with Charlie instead. Meg joins them.
It’s okay to admit you miss him,
"Dean, I want to talk to you," Cas cuts in.
1 minute after 6, the lockdown protocol is implemented.
"Are you religious?" Dean asks.
"Good afternoon, my name is Kansas. If you recognise this mask, you may have seen us at the Bank of America two years ago," Dean greets from the top of the stairs, his most charming smile splitting across his face. "We're back."
goodbye?
can’t come to Earth unless we
I don't know...
When Cas speaks, it’s soft and not as gravelly as Dean is used to hearing. “Are you okay?”
Sam and Eileen arrive soon after and give him a hug and their own congratulations and that's when Cas comes over. It's the first time Dean is seeing him today; Dean went to the venue straight away instead of going there from work with Cas. Cas is dressed in full NOVAK wear: Matching classic fit silk jersey shirt, pants, and tie, with a soft fawn blazer detail cotton twill reconstructed trench coat. Dean himself is in a NOVAK outfit too, specially styled by Cas a week prior to the event; Dean wears leather oxford brogues, a classic cut cotton tie, a charcoal grey wool tailored trousers with belt detail, pale blue cotton poplin shirt with logo tape. Over that, he wears a wool tailored jacket with cargo belt detail under a reversible striped technical linen field jacket.
? Dean Winchester, you have never killed a person in your life. If Michael said that to me, well, that’d intimidate me, but
They stop right outside of the room and Cas starts working, almost like muscle memory by now -- he pulls out a can of hairspray and shakes it, the metallic clanging the only sound echoing before he sprays the heat detectors. Cas had explained during their two months of readjusting Bela and Crowley's outdated plan that the oil in the hairspray will insulate the air around the detectors, rendering them completely useless in detecting their body heat when they actually enter the room. It's not a permanent solution but it lasts a few hours and they just need it for until Dean and Ash do their parts in disabling the alarms.
John asks quietly, "Dean’s there, isn’t he?"
Jess heard on the call between Cas and Mick from the police that Detroit -- real name apparently Michael -- had gotten shot by a sniper. She saw on the cameras, Cas running to his aid and calling for help from Rowena. She saw Eileen wheel Dean out to make space for them to work and saw Sam's broken arm, this time in a sling made from a scarf belonging to one of the hostages.
Adam, what’s wrong?
"I know I am," Balthazar smiles, wide and smug. "But it must be something plain."
Cas closes his eyes and draws in a deep breath. He’s silent for moments that stretch too long for Dean’s comfort, and then he says, “Neither can I, Dean. When will you realise that you’re just as important to me? I just don’t want anything to happen to you in there. Why won’t you let me help you?”
"No! No," Jess grins, sitting down on the edge of the truck so her legs hang off the edge. Adam sits next to her and she continues, "I helped him pull off a heist. If he doesn't marry me after this then that would be absurd." Adam laughs and leans into her side. Undeniably, working together on the heist made them closer. Jess helped to patch him up after Dean managed to get him out of the tent. He now holds the box of Star Wars bandaids, looking over the aged packaging. He'd kept it since Detroit but he guesses he forgot he had it until Jess dug it out. Though it had long expired, Adam had kept it out of sentimental value.
Both.
"Oh, dude. Don't give me details," Dean gags, raising a hand in goodbye as the man gets off at level eight. "But good on you for landing that client. You're gonna destroy that asshole in court."
Murder by gun
“Thank you,” Castiel says and Dean can hear the adrenaline and alcohol in the way his voice trembles. Dean understands why he’s so shaken up about the article almost running. “I don’t know what I would have done if it printed.”
“Dean!” Sam shouts across the field. “We’re gonna start soon before it gets too dark!”
It hurts to see Dean be so torn up about his identity and to have his insecurity about all his relationships laid out in the open without knowing how best to help him. At the very least, he’s secure about the fact that they will be back in Palermo by tomorrow evening, more or less, and they’ll have all the time in the world to deal with Dean’s personal problems.
Gabriel’s gaze is concerned, instantly turning to Dean, but Dean’s own gaze remains blank. Gabriel asks tentatively, “Hey, Winchester. You good?”
Michael instantly sits upright despite Cas flinching and Gabriel protesting. Michael winces at the strain on his fresh stitches but ignores it for the call. After a shuffle of the phone, Michael says tentatively, "This is Michael."
are you saying michael approves of me
Everything in Dean twists and aches, and he feels almost breathless in a dizzy, cloudy way. It's the sight of Cas in the morning that is so warm and sweet, and Dean is just
"And it worked. God, you should have seen their faces, man. I wish I could have taken a picture," Sam grins. "I don't know where they even picked these lawyers up, they're practically kids. They were gonna shit their pants, I swear. Cas scared the hell out of them."
A shot of the sky, still bright, and a wide shot of a lake. It looks peaceful.
Thanks for following this series! I hope it was enjoyable, at least.
Angeles can be one scary motherfucker when he wants to be.
[removed from online store]
You’re sure this will work?
HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOUR LITTLE BOYFRIEND
Stoplight.
“But you can never have too much,” Bela points out, to which Berlin shrugs in agreement. “You’re one of the best robbers I know. Hell, you’re one of the best in this house. You’re focussed and clever, nothing is too big a setback to you. I think you’re perfect to be my right-hand on this.”
Sam looks around, a faint smile tugging at the edges of his mouth, “This is so awesome, Dean. This job, this apartment.
But I'm bigger now. I know how to fight. If he tried anything, I'm not taking his shit.
“Eileen,” Eileen answers.
"I'm not. I just always wanted to try," Dean assures. "Come on, there's gotta be something you do for fun."
god i hate this so much
Sam asks, passing a tool to the surgeon, "Where's Kansas?"
change it then bitch
"You shot at the cops?" Adam cuts in, frantic. Dean clicks his tongue in annoyance, taking the earpiece off with a spare hand and putting it down on the table. He carefully pulls the glass from Angeles's palm and quickly cleans it up to bandage it.
Do you see me asking you if
Dean goes in for a hug. Adam hesitates but returns it anyway, then accepting a hug from Sam. When Sam’s phone rings, he pulls away to read the caller ID -- EILEEN.
and ambush him.
Mention of an overdose in the last section (doesn't actually happen)
Toni is certain that Naomi and Ketch have gotten their outside surveillance man captured which means that the robbers have no security now. If they didn't, then it just goes to show that the basic police force is for the incompetent.
[Passed back to Cas]
“Yes, you love me because I’m your wingman,” Dean rolls his eyes fondly. “Now will you help me?”
“Sir, is something wrong?” Dean asks, lowering his arm.
Dean chuckles slightly, "Me, I like
man leave me alone
that look.
i've never met you so i don’t doubt you will so i'll shut the fuck up
How did Chuck miss you? Who
barcelona squad
"When you find a branded apron that won't get dirty, let me know," Dean sassed.
This is no way to treat the man who is driving you to school.
He almost tried to get my brother to go but Gabriel promised he wouldn't.
I can only change how I look at it.
"Honeybee, you really can't do anything wrong," Dean smiles. "For me?"
Here we go.
"You're
Dean sighs.
i try to forget oggy i really do
Adam presses his lips together in hesitation, and he eventually says, "I paraphrased."
"We can set up the machinery later, it won't take very long. Just a furnace, a roller and moulds," Eileen says as she signs. "We should go meet up with Dean in the lobby."
Kansas just keeps fucking winning. Sam can't counter him fast enough and it's beginning to get more than frustrating. He needs a win, whether that be in regards to the public or against Kansas.
Sam ignores his question and continues, "If Cas was a Cassie, you wouldn’t be saying shit."
"I don't know," Meg mutters. "Stress?"
Amazingly, the believers loved him.
Violet and Rowena hit Dean with the spell and a bright light covers Dean. Sam and Adam shut their eyes against the brightness. When the light fades, Dean and Violet are gone. Sam is crying and Rowena tries to comfort him:
i have a date help
Cas closes the door quietly and puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. It feels grounding, almost calming, but not enough for almost thirty years of belittlement. Cas asks, “What happened?”
my fault.”
ok boss.
“You’re so cheesy,” Cas says once again, but he’s biting back a smile and he’s so endearing that Dean’s heart kind of aches in his chest. Dean wishes he had his notebook right now -- Cas looks so beautiful, smiling at the sun with pinks and oranges cast over his face, that Dean just wants to draw it and remember every detail forever.
"My name is Michael," Detroit rasps. "Adam will know me."
he's so pretty
i do many things. you'll have to be more specific.
They fall over one another trying to get into the cab and when the door shuts behind them and the cab starts moving, they laugh quietly, out of it.
let's surprise him on his birthday omg
Louis Vuitton at Champs-Elysées is huge, and Dean almost feels like a little kid on his birthday.
"Good morning, welcome to class," Dean opens and the dark-haired woman snorted, throwing a paper ball at the burly man in the hat. All the different criminals are seated at tables not unlike those in a classroom. The first two is a British woman who does perfect counterfeiting and Adam Milligan. The second row has both of the redhead women -- one is an IT expert and another is a professional con-woman. The third row has a blonde British man who dabbles in the black market as a broker of sorts and another who is known for being an infamously good jewel thief. The fourth row: one of the world's best miners, the dark-haired skilled robber who threw the paper, and the United Kingdom's most wanted robber.
Angeles finally nods, saying, "We're all just a bunch of losers, Sam." Hearing his name from one of the robbers, like they're friends, borders on weird, but it's now his new normal which amazes Sam. "All looking to start again. It's only fair that we give you that chance too."
WHEN DID
Anael looks up at him and taps the pen impatiently against the top of the clipboard. “No. Do you?”
Bee fits in fine with Clarence and Chevy. He is in good hands.
“Good, all solved!” Charlie smiles, taking a forkful of ramen into her mouth.
Meg raises an eyebrow and asks, "Won't Crowley be the first-in-command since he's second?"
the chef
"Dean's cooking is awesome," Sam says, gesturing as he speaks. "One time Dad forgot it was my birthday and Dean didn't have time to go buy a proper cake so he made one and it was amazing. I mean, I know it's technically baking, but still."
“Meg! That’s awesome!” Charlie says excitedly. Dean liked being around her; Charlie is so overwhelmingly positive and her happiness was contagious. It’s almost impossible to be in a bad mood when she’s near. They talk until Dean’s meal has long been finished and then Dean realizes belatedly that Castiel has probably been back for at least half an hour. He says his goodbyes and clears his tray, rushing upstairs and praying that Castiel left the lunch in a good mood.
Cas blinks once. Then twice. "You what?"
“Give me till this afternoon. I’ll give you an answer,” Meg bargains, already beginning to guide Dean to the exit. “If Clarence asks, tell him that.”
little angel is gone and you get
“Oh, really? That’s cool, he’s a good P.A.,” Gadreel replies, giving Dean a quick look before turning it on Eileen. “Who’s this?”
what, for valentine’s day?
He kept the snail and named it Chevy after his father's car.
Cas pauses, and his hand is a little cold in Dean's, but he contemplates it. Cas thinks of it this way: he's not even going to actually say anything. If he knows Sam as well as he thinks he does, Sam would ask Dean. All Cas has to do is say hello to Sam while dressed in Dean's shirt and shorts. No words needed. It's easy enough, just like with Rowena. Just as the knock comes again, Cas glances towards the door, steeling up a little. "I think I can do it."
Dean takes John’s number and it is odd to look at the digits on the small slip of paper, knowing that there is another end to it, an end that won’t tell him that it is unavailable, an end that will ask, “Dean, is that you?” when he calls.
"So you pray because..."
he's a massive dumbass. are we that surprised?
Cas turns to Gabriel, concerned. “Why didn’t he tell me any of this?”
When he reaches home, it's a little past 1 in the morning and Sam’s sleeping in front of the television — dressed in a distressed AC/DC shirt that Dean remembers seeing at the bottom of his closet and an embarrassing pair of red and white stripes shorts. His hair sticks up in the back as his head rests on the top of the couch, his snores the only thing louder than the action movie playing. It’s a miracle that the explosions haven’t woken Sam up. His computer is open on his lap and Dean puts his bag down, going over to take the laptop out of his hands and setting it down on the table. He turns to switch off the television and Sam blinks, awakened by the action.
tell him. You know, I always
I love him.
"You’re the one who said Kansas City is a city," Dean points out and Angeles chuckles quietly.
They were ready.
Dean didn’t get much sleep last night. He’d stayed up trying to think of a plan like Anael asked him to.
Well, I can’t write forever, even if I wish I could. So, I’ll be stopping here. This is it, then. End of the love story, but not our love.
Unless you know something else,
"Fuck,
Michael GRABS Chuck by the collar.
Castiel was finally out and free and as it appears, it wasn’t as scary as he remembered it to be. After practising with friends and family, the words had finally grown comfortable in his mouth and in his heart.
Dean resists rolling his eyes but relents, saying, "My brother's in the tent."
"What happened to him?"
"I am not shitting you, man. We really want you to design them," Sam laughs. "Will you?"
She pulls the trigger.
"I'm thinking of getting spaghetti," Adam says, squinting over at the menu propped up over the counter. "They served it today at the hospital but honestly, it looks like it went bad years ago."
“Gabriel’s nicer than I thought he’d be,” Dean starts.
saying it, and--
But Cas's breath is quiet on the other end of the phone, and when he speaks, he says, "Dean, you are so strong. Do you know that?" Dean sniffs in reply, and Cas continues, "And you don't deserve any of this, you truly don't. Have you thought about reporting your father --"
I understand that but I also hate being restricted the way I have been.
Dean's smile becomes amused and confused. "I thought we already had the big bro talk. Twice, actually."
Twenty-five minutes after the interview, colonel Zachariah Adler's termination is announced on every news station.
plus you're big romantic
"Yeah," Gabe says dismissively. "Did you
"Let me guess, something about valentines," Dean ponders. "Valentine's Day? Man, that's one month too late, Castiel."
“Nah, was thinking.”
Anael’s head snaps up, eyes wide. “She didn’t do anything.”
Finally, Cas calls again, "
Michael.
bee??
“Everything settled?” Castiel asks.
," Kansas echoes meaningfully. "
"No kidding?" Dean replies, turning to look at himself in the full-length mirror before nodding approvingly with Crowley. "Thought Bela got sick of her."
Castiel answers, “Dean tells me they make it seem like my life is perfect.”
"Loosen up, bro," Gabriel says. "Dean's saved, Michael's saved, Adam's safe, the phones are working now. We're back on track." It did sound much better than yesterday when Gabriel put it like that and Cas can feel some stress leave his body. He was still concerned about Dean's condition -- he'd spent all night and morning waiting for Mick to call with updates but nothing. He's also concerned about how Dean thinks he's going to liberate Adam from the police's captivity and get himself back into the Factory.
In the medical bay, Adam is there alone. Anael faintly remembers Rufus leaving ten minutes before. Adam goes through folders in the office as Lilith looks around, moving to one of the bedside tables to grab what looks like a scalpel. Anael tenses up, her eyes darting across the screens to relocate Dean and Gabriel. They’re almost at the medical bay.

An expert jeweller Gabriel met in jail

I'm getting ahead of myself. Oh boy.
Sure enough, they got a call from Kansas about half an hour after they dragged a Dalí back into the building. Depending on what Kansas says, they'll know if they shot a hostage or a robber.
Eileen frowns. "So what's your new plan?"
okay.
Dean and Gabriel follow Nathaniel and the guard asks, “Y’all been in here before?”
Dean catches on and protests, "But you already have me."
which is a weird look on his face because Dean is used to him being generally stone-faced. He teases, sliding into his side of the diner booth as Cas goes in after him, "Someone's all cheery."
"No, we have the chance to take them down now!" Zachariah replies.
"I think 'We're The Millers' will be funny to watch," Bela says, raising the DVD up to him. He nods, managing a small smile as she sticks the DVD into the player before getting on the couch next to him. She pulls the duvet over so it hangs over both of them and opens the ice cream tub. "Dig in, darling."
“No, you’re not. Because I came out of my own choice and he tried to come out for you. It’s not the same, nobody could be ready for that,” Dean agrees and points out. “The point is, you’re still brave. I mean, you told me. That’s big on its own.” He reaches for the wine bottle, grinning in an attempt to ease Castiel’s nerves, “Calls for a celebration, don’t you think?”
Angeles hits the ground, blood spilling from his left shoulder.
Dean stands outside of the Roadhouse, looking out at the space in front of it. It’s quiet, birds chirping.
“Winchester, get me Bela,” Castiel orders and Dean nods, calling her and connecting the call to his office.
Mick stands by the partition, leaving only himself and Adam in that closed-off area of the tent. Adam glances at him and knows him as one of the ITs. He's probably an officer who's just technologically proficient if he's been asked to guard him. Mick moves closer and Adam straightens up, wary.
He looks around -- Is this Heaven? A hallucination in Hell? Whatever Purgatory is supposed to be? -- and sees a man on the ground a few feet away: CHUCK.
The low rumble of his voice. The way their hands would glide past each other on their walks. How the whole world seemed to stop whenever the man said his name.
Castiel huffed at his remark, but was too tired to argue. “Do you want to come in?”
Dean felt heat rise into his cheeks. “None of your damn business.”
If he wanted to have a normal night, he needs To find somewhere to hide fast!
Sam almost combusts with nerves when Dean walks in.
“Stop. Keep there”
He slowly sunk into a lying position. Dean subconsciously moved with him.
“Is that... Castiel???”
Castiel’s felt like he had been punched in the gut. “He’s... gone? How?”
Was Cas just being friendly, or did this mean something else?
“Hey, nice car!”
Gabriel squealed in excitement, grabbing a cup and filling it with coffee. He shoved it into Dean’s hands, grinning like a toddler.
Hey, Cas!
Dean was acting differently. He had been ever since Castiel told him that he was leaving. He still smiled and laughed, but it seemed forced. There was a slight reflection of sorrow in his eyes.
Castiel felt a pang of pity in his chest. He knew he should change the subject. “Do you like it here?”
They break contact an eternity to soon. Cas’ face is a bright shade of red when he takes a step back. He fumbles over his words. “I—uh—I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Dean has to use the bathroom.
He leaned over and shut off the lamp, plunging the room into darkness. The only light in the room was entering in from the window, partly covered by the curtains. Dean was back, sighing as he sunk into the mattress.
“I... wha?”
—Go get drinks, since.... wait, what???”
Rowena squealed, practically vibrating with excitement. “Crowley just called me! He said he has a life-changing opportunity for you!!!”
Gabriel groaned. “He must be stalling because he’s nervous. I’ll get him—
Dean rose an eyebrow, noticing how tense his coworkers were. “Are you chill with that?”
“Yes, sir.”
But Dean was already inside the apartment.
The model felt his dry throat shake, and the words tumbled from his lips. “It is true that I find men... aesthetically pleasing.”
He smirked at her reaction, turning around and taking her untouched drink back to the sink.
It was obvious how much they liked each other...
Dean laughed, putting his hands up defensively. “Okay, okay! I’m glad you like it.”
The receptionist flinched, causing him to lose his game of ‘Flappy Bird’.
Thank you so much for the kudos and wonderful comments. You all are really incredible! :)
Castiel gave Lucifer a fake smile and offered his hand.
They worked in a thoughtful silence. About fifteen minutes later and Gabriel screamed.
The bartender nodded. “You could say that...”
Because he was going to die today.
Should he wear a shirt too?
Dean is so oblivious!
Castiel gasped in surprise, rousing a chuckle from Dean.
Meeting Castiel Novak was like waking up from a nightmare.
Gabriel nodded before disappearing behind the counter, making Dean his coffee.
Dean arrived a little later today. Definitely not because he wanted Castiel to have the seat.
All his previous anger towards Cas was gone, replaced with a nagging pull of worry and regret.
“Love it. How about you?”
Dean. Was. Going. To. Take. Cas!!! No matter how many long, or how much effort, it took.
He saved Dean Winchester.
Where could he spend the next seven hours?
The man scowled. “Well, I was GOING to leave in five minutes.... but I think I will be staying longer. Much longer.”
Then Jo giggled, attracting the couple’s attention. Castiel gave her a nervous smile before walking over to Dean.
“Yup, but make it to go. There’s a house I’m working on across town, and I need to get there early.”
“Yeah. Very good looking. Has anyone told you what he looks like?”
“Uh—yeah, sure”
I hope you enjoy!
Grabbing his phone from the nightstand, the bartender called Bobby.
“Yeah?”
The angel looks up.
“So do you like your apartment? You just moved in, right?”
Castiel felt his face heat up. “He doesn't?”
His voice was muffled by the blankets. “I think the flight really wore me out. What time is it?”
And that’s when he knew that it didn't matter what happened next. As long as Cas was with him, he would be happy.
He stared wide eyed at the angel, completely still. He then took a step back, hands shaking. “I—I don’t...”
He brought the rim of the mug to his lips, taking a long sip of the warm liquid. He was shocked with how good it tasted. The flavors were balanced perfectly, the minty flavor not overpowering the sweet. Dean didn't put sugar in here... it tasted more like honey.
“Seriously? So you’re saying that you took advantage of my sight?”
Heya, Cas. Sorry, but I’ll be out for a while. See you in a bit.
He rested his head on Dean’s shoulder. The man shifted in reaction, positioning his shoulder to be more comfortable to lie on. His hand drifted down from Castiel’s shoulder, wrapping around his waist.
But this was not about him, it was about Cas.
Maybe Cas—
“... It makes me feel trapped.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Now way. I need to get home”
“What do you mean?”
She wondered how good he was in bed.
Castiel had no idea how to react. Sure, people told him about his looks constantly. It was his job, just something he had to get used to.
Sam’s voice was filled with enthusiasm. “What about him?”
“Sure! As long as I can bring Gil along too.”
Dean gaped in disbelief, waving Gabriel over to see his brother. He sighed, shaking his head. “Cassie has been working really hard as of late. He has a crap-ton of work to take care of.”
Wait— this was the same song that came on when he was slow dancing with Dean!
“My eyes were closed”
Castiel smiled giddily. “I am going to a wedding.”
“John?”
Castiel was still, not even his breathing audible.
“Yeah, he is—I mean, he’s not the most disgusting creature in the universe.”
This was Castiel’s life. Being told what to do and how to act. Being a model was harder than most people knew.
Sam almost threw the kitchen knife at Dean. He made a stabbing motion, burning it into the wooden cutting board on the counter.
Dean paused, his cheeks going red. “I’m not going to say that one out loud....”
Dean put a reassuring hand on the model’s shoulder.
“Huh? Why not?”
The man’s cheeks went a tint of red, and he rubbed the back of his neck. “Uh—you kinda said something about bees last night, so I thought you must really like honey”
He pressed one of the earbuds into his hand. Dean put it into his left ear, leaning his head against the back of the plane seat.
Cas smiles, wide and sunny, and the question tumbles right out of Dean's lips before he has the chance to think. "Will you go out with me?"
Castiel shoves him, saying, “Don’t be gross.”
Castiel scoffs and shakes his head, looking at Gadreel as he asks loudly, “Where is Duma with that damn collection?”
I've got Cas, Sam, and the others. I'm good.
"I fell out of bed today and I looked over at Cas, see if I woke him up. I did, and he turns over and looks at me. Then he smiles, his hair’s sticking up and his voice wasn’t so deep and it’s kinda blurry when he said ‘good morning’. And I stood there and just... looked at him," Dean continues, a smile growing on his face as he carefully drips batter onto a pan.
Michael can’t believe it — Lilith genuinely thinks he’s cheating on Adam with Dean (or Dino De Luca, to her). It couldn’t be further from the truth. He barely trusted Dean with anything, let alone enough for the secret relationship she thinks they have. Though, it does mean that she likely won’t bother Adam so Michael will roll with it. At least he can try to look out for Dean. Keeping track of Adam in the medical bay from the common areas is much harder.
‘yes’. I wouldn’t have tried at all.
Naomi looks like she wants to agree but she points out grudgingly, "We shot one of them just for coming out of the Factory to get supplies and then we brought our punching bag out in front of everyone with a camera, then we publicly sniped someone. We need to win the citizens back or Interpol and FBI are fucked."
[SS2020, look 28]
Crowley hesitates. "It's still up for debate."
eternity.
back, then at least tell me
you and I have to go pay Adam
Dean NODS, running a hand over the coat again.
Dean SMILES - he feels closer to victory than he’s ever felt before.
you would like her :) she's super hot
Jess's eyes follow as Dean is taken by medics to stabilise and she nods frantically. "Yes, Dean's my boyfriend. Please save him, I love him so much, I can't lose him."
She pulls the shiv out and then shoves it back in, making Michael grit his teeth as he tries not to look too vulnerable. Irritated with the suppressed reaction, Lilith has always been sadistic, so she twists.
chickens should wear hats as a rule
Michael nods once before his expression turns serious. “Is Lilith leaving you alone?”
Jack is making more angels but
My father will probably insist on coming along as a chaperone.
“This is just some really great thing, you know? Fashion. I live it, I breathe it, God knows I’m lucky to work it under your management,” Dean says. “But I won’t let you push me, or them, around like this. I need boundaries if I’m going to be doing this shit for you.”
shut the fuck up
back and we’ll forget about it?
If it works, it works.
Sam replies, "I'm counting on it. Okay, so I'll probably be in NYC in two days, maybe in the afternoon. Should I go in myself or will you be there?"
He gets to kiss Cas now, for example. Always a win in Dean’s book.
“Her branch isn’t too far from here. If you’re free, we can go right now,” Charlie says, her voice tilting up at the end to ask if he was free.
is what you give me?
“Yeah!” Dean affirms, nodding all child-like and petty. It’s endearing and Cas smiles faintly at it. Dean lists, lifting a finger to count them off one by one, “When he was 15, Sam didn’t know what to get Jess for their first Christmas together so I taught him how to remake this tweed and ecru Chanel dress she really liked. One Christmas, it was so cold and the heater wasn’t working so I stayed up all night and fixed Bobby’s old one.”
“Okay,” Dean nods, writing it down. “Anything else?”
the way cas is biologically related to me but takes after you more hate it here
“I’m not marrying you, Dean,” Michael jokes, and Dean elbows him.
"My brother," Dean corrects. He leaves it at that -- he's the one who said no personal information after all and he's shared more than he should have.
“Why are you having dinner with him?” Dean asks, fingers tapping on the back of his phone.
"Woah, okay, back the fuck up, you coward," Meg laughs wryly, holding up her hands between them.
"They're escaping!" Paris shouts, running into the governor's office where Dean was with Meg, Salem and Angeles. "The hostages are escaping right now!"
gonna have to beat god for that one
you punched me this morning
“Definitely,” Cas says, fingers rapping on the hardcover. “But they won’t catch us.”
Gonna kill a reaper. We need
“So I take it you had fun, then?” Cas takes the Cartier bag from him and peeks inside, walking with Dean back to their shared office space. He takes out the box. Dean shuts the door behind them as Cas puts the bag down on the desk, opening the box to look at the bracelet. It’s one of the cheapest ones in the store. Astoundingly enough, since it costs $2,240. It is made of 18K rose gold, two small rings interlocked and held with a chain; simple but elegant. Cas smiles.
I hear that. So what are you
After Inias leaves, Dean asks, “What’s with Garrison?”
“Yes, you will beat the ever-loving fuck out of me,” Crowley mutters, rolling his eyes and turning back to look at Dean. “I am aware of your violent resolutions and contrary to popular belief, I don’t actually like it when people hit me. I heard that you and a certain John Winchester met in the laundry room. What was that about?”
TELL ME HOW IT WENT
"Doesn't mean I should've said it," Dean insists.
can i come over to cas's
Paris, Salem, Dorothy and Crowley stand around warily, Salem eyeing the door. Meg turns to her, threatening, "Open that door and I'll shoot you in the foot."

On Christmas afternoon, he’d gotten a present mailed from Cas — a mixtape of mostly old songs and some fairly recent. Dean can’t help but note that Cas had consciously avoided putting love songs on the cassette, only leaving one or two romantic tracks, but a mixtape is a tender gesture. His came with a short note saying almost the same thing as Dean’s, a simple:

Cas looks around the kitchen and asks, "What now?"
“I don’t know. I think John owed him something,” Dean answers, shrugging. “I tried keeping my distance from him so... Can’t help you too much there.”
WITHOUT ME?
Thankfully, they left Rufus in a good mood as well, because Adam is given the chance to go see Michael at the hospital nearby with what little time they have left of their lunch break.
did you bring a notebook tho
Where will the demons and angels
“Dean Winchester,” Dean returns, shaking his hand. “From NOVAK.”
." Cas taps the wooden spoon in his hand to the bowl with cake mixture and then to the page where it has a photo of a beautiful cake taped to it.
anyway, he's alright now. just got a bit of a shock, the experiment was right behind us.
. Fine, Gordon Ramsay," Cas says, throwing his hands up in exasperation and shifting aside so Dean has room to work on the mixture. He adds ingredients and does it all without referring to the recipe. "How do you remember all that?"
wtf now i wanna play hooky
Michael?
“What’s our play? Am I gonna ask her out for you? Set it up, what?” Dean asks, borderline excited. It’s been a while since he was someone’s wingman.
Near-death
When Castiel doesn’t have any business, Dean takes the time to visit other departments. Kevin’s workshop is really cool, full of fabric and materials, some of which Dean hasn’t even seen or felt before. Kevin promises to give him a few yards of some very smooth silk he developed that shines like the mother of pearl. Charlie is busy with keeping NOVAK retail stores stocked and making sure what goes into the stores are pieces people want to buy. She used to be a stylist at NOVAK but she assured Dean that she preferred the business side of fashion.
about that.
This may be the last shreds of peace she will know in her life until she enters the bank. Once you participate in a heist of that scale, there is no going back. These people, no matter how ill-fitting, have no choice but to become family now. If one fell, the rest would in due time.
"Of course," Bela nods, sitting him down on the couch. She tosses him one of the soft throw pillows and moves to the balcony to shut the windows, noticing the pack of cigarettes on the table. She picks it up and turns to show it to him, raising her eyebrows. "Did you smoke?"
I'm going to put the pen down now.
Well, I am religious.
“Would say I tried to find you too but Dad never told us your name,” Dean replies, his apology plastic and see-through. Michael and Cas both stand quietly, staying out of the conversation. “All he said was that he was visiting his other son at Lenox Hill Hospital.”
Castiel and Bela have a photoshoot together that's supposed to be released with an interview they did the earlier in the week when Dean wasn't around. It mostly revolved around their history together when they were still small-time designers, their favourite works and fashion icons and their upcoming collections. Bela had one planned for spring and summer and Cas said he wasn't planning anything for SS15.
When Dean called him to propose a new heist, Adam almost instantly said no, until Meg took over the phone and launched into her reasoning about how they owed it to Bela, Balthazar and Benny to do her plan and honour their memory. He agreed with the sentiment, insisted that there were other ways to do right by their friends, and proceeded to lose that argument against Meg.
Dick circles him, not that far from the way a predator circles its prey, and says, "I like your drive, kid. How about you work for me?"
“Oh, so this is a
That can’t be all to the spell, can it?
He walks a little bit closer to Castiel and cradles his face between his hands, gentle, and kisses him.
Castiel cocks his head. "Good morning, Sam." That catches Sam off-guard and he glances back at Dean before returning his full attention to the pancakes he's making.
"Ooh, I love these," Bela says approvingly, taking the Stella McCartney trench coat. "Good choice with the black, I only have dark makeup on me right now."
They get through the second door easy, and Ash just hacks the time lock on the last door. Supposedly, it would only open five hours later. They could wait it out but who knows how long they have before hostages start wandering and see things they shouldn't see? Ash could open the door in five seconds anyway.
He's giving them an ultimatum -- what's more important: Keeping the Dalís' uncooperative surveillance guy or sending a bug into the Factory with Dean?
My brother wanted me to tell you he really likes that drawing of me you did.
“Less than three weeks?” Cas echoes absently, and Dean sits down heavily on the armrest next to Cas.
Two months after Missouri, Sam had finally found it in himself to forgive everyone involved. Anael kept to her wishes, cutting contact from almost every Dalí. As far as Cas knew, she was still friends with him, Jess, Michael, Adam, Rowena, Eileen, Charlie and Dorothy. Michael and Adam flew back to Detroit where Cas hasn't heard from them since. Mick and Meg went radio silent as well, likely out of guilt for selling Dean out. Crowley is still in contact with them; Cas thinks it's out of obligation that they saved him from the electric chair.
Cas gives him a pointed stare. "Don't you smoke too?"
Suddenly, Dean’s voice comes up again, but it’s obviously not a memory.
bee died
They push the beds so that there's as little space between them as possible — Cas gets the bedside tables out of the way and Dean pushes the beds together so they meet in the middle.
Dean nods, talking into his earpiece, "Everyone ready?"
Dean smiles softly at that, "I'm sure you're a nice change from her demonic son."
Northern Bank Robbery
Adam leaves Jess in charge of surveillance while he goes to do some groundwork. Since this heist was going to be harder than the first, Adam had offered to go look at the tent for them irregularly, see if he can catch something. He's like their ear on the ground while Jess is their eye in the sky.
working on that. She’s giving us
Me too.
"I know! Fucking shit, I know," Dean snaps. "You think I don't care that Rome's dead? That's going to haunt me for the rest of my fucking life. If I could die in his place, I would. Rome -- Balthazar was my family, just like the rest of you. I love you all, and I'm always going to blame myself for Balthazar. This shit with Abaddon, I know it's making all of us scared and this is not helping at all. If you put down the gun, we can talk about it --"
I’m gonna do without you. If I
Winchesters
Dean makes sure to remember to formally introduce Sam and Adam before he goes back to Stanford. After the frankly off-putting visit from Adam at his workplace, Dean tried again when he was in a more sound mind and texted Adam. Adam apologised again for springing his presence onto him so unprofessionally and promised it won't happen again. Then they had their little meeting in the café and cleared the 'bad energy' as Kevin's mom Linda would put it.
Bad injury by gun, blood
"He doesn't," Crowley affirms. "So can I take that as a confirmation?"
Kelly writes down his progress for her notes, looking up proudly at him. "Are you ready to tell me, then?"
We went into History at the same time, coincidentally enough, and I guess we had the same idea; I was walking to the back to sit with him, and he was walking up to the front to sit with me, so we just met each other halfway. We now sit in the middle row and he passes me notes when Mr Devereaux isn’t looking.
“You didn’t know? Oh my God, you’re missing out,” Dean gapes. “I’ll show you in the car. It’s so much better.”
I had no free will. That my free
Cas gives him a challenging grin and says nonchalantly, "This isn't hot enough." Dean's eyes grow wide and he shakes his head, though a small smile stays on his face. He looks back at his computer and types into it. Cas clears his throat and gets into business. "Is there any news for me?"
Anna raises an eyebrow. “They’re criminals.”
Gabriel grins cheekily and says, “Well, he’s up there with his baby bro in the rain, so why don’t I give them a ride home and your boy toy can sit in the back with you?”
Dean returns his incredulous stare and explains, “It’ll be chewy but still a little firm. Best kind of pasta.”
Groaning, Ketch orders, walking out of the tent, "Someone, find out who that guy is. Get the medics. And hold your fire, don’t shoot Sam Winchester!"

“Perhaps we should have stayed in bed the day Meg found us in Italy. We’d have avoided all of this.” Cas huffs a half-hearted laugh. “It’s all ‘what-if’s now.”
She’d visited Champs-Elysées, smiling at the memory of how Cas had robbed this place before. Clearly, it had time to recover from the loss incurred by Cas, and it looks as if he’d never gotten his hands on their treasure.
I've read and seen this before... When out people get mad because they think their partner isn't proud of them.

Michael’s eyes GLOW as his hand hovers over the book. The design of it glows as well as Michael strains to get the book open. When he can’t, his eyes fizzle out and he gives up.
Adam starts off instantly, saying, “Dean told me you have a girlfriend, Eileen, right? How is she?” Sam and Adam get into a conversation about her and then their own careers, and for once, Dean feels like his biological family has some form of stability. Yeah, his non-blood-related family is awesome, but this is good too.
up as we went.
At least Cas is still adjusting to Paris too. Dean feels a little out of place without any of his friends there but hopefully, he’ll make some new ones and the month will pass by quick.
Lucifer FIRES a blast of grace at Michael and Michael stumbles back from the damage. He forces himself to get up and Sam and Dean watch as Michael PUNCHES Lucifer into the floor, the wood cracking under Lucifer’s body.
so, wings.
I think I want to change the title again. One last time.
Dean catches Crowley in the bathroom early, before anyone else is there. It’s not hard to realise that Crowley would be there — he hated crowds and typically woke up earlier than most people. At least, he was always one of the first to get up when they studied for heists. Plus, with how dirty the bathrooms get and how long the line will go when the clock hits 8, Crowley would be a fool to not beat the queue.
baby go to sleep
Dean takes the knife out of his pocket before he STOPS, seeing Cas’s dried blood on the blade.

Dean gets his supplies and goes to the main bathroom, wanting to take a morning shower — it’s gross, to say the least. Even with multiple bathrooms all around, it’s still crowded and some aren’t even dressed modestly. Dean ends up deciding to forgo the shower and just brush his teeth in his cell.

She presses her lips together, thinking, then she says, “You should talk to Dean, maybe you two can get an idea running. You know which cell he’s in. Oh, and his name in here is his Italian one, Dino De Luca. He’s staying under the radar.”

Pax half-smiles and pats his arm, “Then you should get going. I won’t see you at lunch, a couple of the models are going out and they invited me. I’ll call you later?”
"If you don't want to be here, it's all good, you know? You can go through the tunnel, hold the fort down with Adam and Jess. I'm cool with it," Dean starts. "I don't want to keep you here if you'd rather not be."
She puts her radio on speaker and starts gearing up, slipping on her bulletproof vest as the line connects. A woman's voice answers, "Who is this?"
The boy thinks about it before he shrugs, “Fine. I need a little more excitement in my life. I’m Castiel.”
yeah right and i'm failing my exams
’s logo on the back, clear white against shimmery black. “But yeah, I think coming here after then would be the best timing.”
Sam catches his drift and starts rambling, "I know what you're gonna say and believe me, I've been thinking about it since Cas asked me. I even talked to his PR, Pamela. That's why he's with Rowena and her right now. Also, Cas's work, while he's got proof he's got them before Roman, it's also not registered because it's just rough sketches, but it
Adam looks impressed — Michael has never been very good at things like this, evidently, but it's obvious to Dean that he tried his best for Adam.
They split the spaghetti evenly in the two bowls and then Dean pours the sauce and mincemeat. Once it's done, Dean gives Cas a lopsided smile. "Look at that, we made pasta. You don't completely suck in the kitchen."
Dean sighs, deciding that his favours with Roman are more important than secrecy. “Fine. What do you need to know?”
Michael huffs a sigh as he makes a left. "I have a boyfriend."
“Oh my God,” Cas mutters, horrified. He pushes past Gabriel, embarrassed. “I’m
"You sure?" Dean asks, looking him over.

"We'll hold off on that. I want to see if they try anything else," Naomi declines. "They're releasing hostages and I want to know why."

You won't be permanently bonded.
“I want my answer,” John says, stabbing undercooked meat with a plastic spoon.
Michael is nice, a different kind from Gabriel's nice. Gabriel is like those candy shops where you get to try as many samples as you wish but there's a sour one hiding in there. Michael is like getting to eat cake before dinner but you don't get to have dessert after.
Sammy is still babbling to himself when they walk back into the motel room. He tumbles to his knees, already walking, and toddles over to Dean.
Dean sets down the last box on the wooden floorboards of his new apartment. “Well, that’s the last of it.”
skin his dick and feed it to him.
It was always my father’s plan.
"You're the first one I'm asking, but I have a bunch of other people to get to," Dean answers. "If they all agree, it should be about nine of us, including me and you."
To say Cas has been unhappy since the day started is an understatement. He'd been moody when he woke up, already out of bed by the time Dean forced himself awake. Not to act as though Cas doesn't have the habit of waking up early, but he'd never left the bed before Dean woke up. It's a small thing to worry about at a time like this, Dean knew, but he can't stop thinking about Cas. He didn't want to do the heist, Dean should have said no, let him stay in Palermo --
we're demons ha ha so funny meg

"Nah, Crowley helped sneak this tank in through the window," Dean says, nodding over to his window. "He wanted to get a bigger tank but I told him not to spend the cash."
Once it's done and the reporter behind talking about her opinion of it, Kansas shuts it off and says, "You think the cops care about you? They chose Jack Kline over
Dean’s hands itch to reach out to Cas, pull him close and kiss him, but with the cameras watching, it’s simply not possible without losing their cover to Naomi. He stays where he is, one row behind Cas, and settles for resting a hand on his shoulder. “What would I do without you?”
My suit.
I would love to go, Dean, but fireworks are too loud.
How was your date last night?
I love you. Never forget that. Tell our sons I will be back soon.
And it’s in here. All that you
It’s over.
that’s all I can find about it. We
But this is ridiculous and sad and pathetic because Cas is being such a dick about everything but Dean can't stop thinking about him. This has to be a new record or something for how stupid Dean can be. It's almost like Dean's in a romantic comedy except there's nothing romantic about it and the only joke is him and his infatuation with Cas.
i just mean w him and that girl he got a rat for
He loved the pristine tiles of jewellery shops, the quiet tinkling of expensive diamonds. Now, he stares at concrete walls and listens to angry men get into fights across the block.
Dean pauses as if just now realising his blunder and he curses under his breath. "Oh, fuck me. I'm the worst boyfriend ever."
And that was all for the Dalís, who never came back again.
“He said to go up yourself,” the clerk says. “Highest level. Take a left and you’re there.”
: Dean...
It has been a long night -- especially long for Castiel, who didn't sleep for one second. After sending Paris, London and Salem to watch the hostages, he, Kansas, Dallas and Meg found a large crate to keep him in as a makeshift casket. Meg found them paint in a storage closet to write his name on the sides. Dallas paints a large 'ROME' on one side.
"Didn't you say you wanted to get a place in Italy?" Dean asks, clipping the bandage in place with the elastic fastener. "I was doing a little bit of research, looking at cities we could live in. I'm good with Palermo if you are."
Mick stepped in and saw Adam try to read him. Adam looks pretty young, at least when compared to Dean, Meg, Crowley or Sam. Mick says, hoping the section isn't bugged, "Palermo."
"My dad doesn't like it when I bring snails home," Cas answers. "I usually bring them to the school garden or, you know, leave them with you."
Cas leans back in his chair, exhaling lightly. "Draft it, please. Thank you, Sam. I know I could have asked one of NOVAK's lawyers but I wanted someone I could trust to do this."
That’s cute. You got your own
Dean refers to his notes quickly before answering, “Le Bernardin again, sir. Bela chose.”
“You can’t scare me like that, man,” Gabriel frowns, cupping Cas’s face in that protective-brother way, his eyes scanning Cas for any signs that he’s still unwell, and Cas just frowns back. “Dad damn near tore me apart for not arguing that he should have come along! At least his favorite son’s at home placating him.”
dean gay
"They don't have a choice. We have state secrets," Dean replies.
Dean doesn’t even answer, pulling Cas into a kiss and feeling his hands come up to cup his cheeks. Dean forgets that there are people standing all around them and Cas no longer cares. In this room, in this universe, it is just them, and as it turns out, it is that easy.
Dean nods, trying to organise his thoughts. “Okay. Gabriel and I will join Crowley in kitchen duty, I’ll start setting up a hijack with Dorothy and Meg. John’s gone, so that’s one less thing to think about. Try to keep Alastair away from Michael, Lilith is a big enough problem for him. I’ll let Cas know about all this, someone tell Michael and Adam.”
is the only way you’re getting
“Then I’m not letting you stay in there with me,” Dean says. “I want you out here,
"You did the spaghetti. If pasta was a musical, you did the title track," Dean says, smiling like an idiot at his own analogy.
you think i haven't done that before? aw precious x
why couldn’t we have been related
Quality control manager
Gabriel almost chuckles. "That's true."
Jo takes out the sheet of paper with codes printed all over and starts pressing them into the keypad on each safe. Both of them work together to unlock each one and Meg dumps the diamonds into a bag.
in love w the angel that is castiel novak
He says, "I see the way you fidget, trying to find an opening where everyone is distracted long enough for you to take it and go. I see you trying to find the blind spot in the security cameras. I saw you take this, which is pretty damning." He holds up the magazine and Adam blinks absently, running a hand over his jacket to realise that that's the copy he took.
Dean raises his eyebrows, realization dawning on his face. "Lunch with Kelly." Cas nods and Dean just smiles, "I'm so damn proud of you, Cas. Are you free tonight?"
Cas nodded. “The prepackaged cocoa is perfectly acceptable when it’s hot, but so disappointing when it’s cold.”
Cas looked to Dean in case there was anything else that needed clearing up.
Cas nodded sagely, as if that made any sense at all, and then turned to walk toward his room. “I’m sure the sleep deprivation, constant stress, long hours running around, inconsistent meals and caffeine addiction will help immensely, yes.”
Sam picked at the label on his beer bottle, staring at it for a few moments so he wouldn’t have to look directly at Ed yet. After more than a decade of watching Dean and Cas be Dean and Cas, this was simultaneously the thing he wanted to have a conversation about the most and the least. He’d never inflicted his frustrations over their obliviousness on any of their friends, but for some reason, now that Ed had explicitly asked about them, Sam felt that maybe he would understand. If nothing else, Ed was someone Sam didn’t really have an objection to dumping ten years’ worth of baggage on. He eventually sighed, gulped down the rest of his drink and set the bottle on the table.
“I suppose that’s a bonus.”
Ed nodded, setting down his beer bottle on the table and pulling out his phone. “So says their social media.” He pulled up their account and slid the phone across the table to Sam, who picked it up and began scrolling their recent messages. “Or at least that’s how I’m reading it.”
“Right, well, he was headed toward town when he sped outta here,” Dean said. “And if proximity’s a factor, maybe you’ll pick up his brainwaves if we get close enough to him again.”
In many of these little vignettes, Chuck won and crushed the universe entirely. In others, Chuck was defeated but Dean died anyway. In others, Dean ended up back in Hell, or even in the Empty, tormented for an eternity beside Cas and never even knowing that the torment wasn’t just more of the same pain that Chuck had inflicted on him since birth, never really getting a win and never having an ounce of free will to fight back with. The worst of all, though, were the ones where Dean flat-out rejected Cas after his confession and just walked away without looking back.
“So we throw Lorna’s rock collection into the to be saved pile. What are we supposed to do about freeing them all if a reaper can’t figure it out, though?”
Or how he was gonna live with it much longer, if they couldn’t find the witch again. Or if this curse didn’t start to show some signs of breaking on its own. Yeah, for now he was running through the facts of the case over and over again to keep himself from unintentionally eavesdropping on anything he didn’t want to hear. The closer they got to town, though, and the longer Dean and Cas tried to rehash the same conversation over and over again to keep their thoughts from straying, the less effective that became. By the time he felt Dean’s relief on finding Baby exactly where he’d left her, unharmed by the witch or anyone else, Sam had resorted to repeating the multiplication tables, reciting the states in alphabetical order, and conjugating Spanish verbs to avoid paying too much attention to their increasingly unguarded thoughts. So much so that he didn’t even notice when he almost ran into a dude walking his dog along the sidewalk between the edge of the woods and the parking lot where they’d stashed Baby.
: I could probably use a break, too. I haven’t read anything good in the last few weeks, trying to get it done. And I’m more than a little curious about what you wrote. Gotta admit, I wouldn’t mind a sneak peek at the next FicFeathers masterpiece.
Dean reached down and unzipped the bag closest to him without looking away from Ed and grabbed out a set of binoculars and a weird looking antenna thing. “We’re gonna go in covert if we can, scope the scene out, and then react accordingly.”
“Yeah, well, you be careful with it. Don’t dig out anything that might try to eat you until we get back.”
“I don’t think so,” Dean said, hunching over a bit and picking at his food, no longer meeting his eyes. “Probably not the kind of thing parents at school would want their kids’ guidance counselor putting out in the world.”
“Next year we bring a broom,” Dean added, leading Cas through the weeds. “Maybe a picnic.”
“It’s fine, leftover lasagna is always better anyway…” He started before recounting the thrilling saga of the alligator. Turned out the rake had actually won when the guy tripped over it while attempting a hasty retreat.
Dean debates between sitting down at his desk or just throwing in the towel and getting comfortable in bed. He gets a good look at himself in the mirror while he brushes his teeth and makes the executive decision that he needs sleep more than he needs to draw anything else tonight. Plus the idea of curling up under the blankets and giving his full attention to Cas’s messages sounds like just what the doctor ordered. It’s not like he has to be in the shop before noon the next morning anyway, and Sundays are usually slow. He’ll have plenty of time to catch up on all his projects.
"That's number one on today's agenda, I suppose," Billie replied.
Half an hour later, after talking about Dean’s childhood love of art and fascination with tattoos, and the accident Cas witnessed as a young child that inspired him to study emergency medicine, Dean’s putting the finishing touches on his work. It’s only when he finally sets his machine down and sits back to look at the finished product that Cas remembers the mirror in his other hand. At some point, he’d decided it was far more interesting to study Dean’s face as he concentrated on his work and let the mirror drop to his lap. He holds it up again now to see the pink skin around the sharp black design. He frowns a little, overriding his instinct to reach for some burn cream. Dean’s already on it, gently rubbing soothing ointment into the irritated skin. Cas hisses through his teeth, and Dean chuckles.
In fact, he found himself thinking just as much about the librarian as he was about the books he was shelving. By the time he’d reached the 700’s, Dean was convinced Cas had some sort of magical power to get under his skin. His blue eyes pierced through him with playful intensity, and whatever he saw inside Dean brought out a sly smile, like Cas knew just how much he’d shaken Dean’s whole world but wouldn’t dare reveal his secrets to anyone.
It was an obvious joke. There had been nothing wrong with his speech, but it couldn’t hold a candle to a lifetime of creative writing.
“You are definitely not as dumb as you look, Squirrel. That bodes very well for your future.”
“This is it, the spell to free souls trapped in crystals,” he said, jabbing a finger at the list of ingredients on the page. “I think we have everything we need here, except the stones themselves.”
“Dean? Can I talk with you for a sec?”
The only fandom friend he knew was in the area was Charlie. She’d taken him under her wing years ago when he’d first started watching Unnatural. She’d introduced him to fanfiction and the wider community, and had been one of the very few people he’d interacted with in fandom who even knew his real identity, let alone where he lived.
“So this is what you guys have been up to all these years.” He shook his head as Sam packed up the remnants of their spell. “I’m honestly glad I never caught a glimpse of any of this back then. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have taken it as well as Lorna did.”
Dean didn’t pay him any mind and was already halfway to getting his hibachi burning. He tossed a match into the coals and nodded with satisfaction when they caught and began to smolder.
“You know, you don’t have to babysit me like this, Dean.”
“Yeah, I like my job too much to do anything inappropriate at the hospital. We have just had an object lesson in not pissing off the nursing staff,” Dean said with a grimace. “I’m not interested in a round two of that. Even if it’s not our fault directly, I figure admin will get sick of us starting drama for them sooner or later. And if we both get fired, they’ll kick us out of our cozy little apartment here.”
“Don’t worry, I do own a suit or two, and you’re about my size,” Dean says, opening his closet and showing Cas. “I don’t just own flannel shirts.”
He lay awake listening to Dean’s breathing evening out as he fell asleep, and then finally succumbed himself.
The writing was generally something Dean kept to himself, outside of the fandom and the cloak of anonymity the internet provided him. But then Cas had gone and talked about his own writing, and somehow Dean had fallen into a strange twilight zone somewhere between his fandom persona and his lifelong passion for telling stories
“Hey,” Gabriel says with a smirk, “If we play our cards right, it’ll mean we’ve got two spies behind enemy lines. They’re both smart, capable people. Hopefully they won’t let Nick get to them.”
“Cas,” Dean said, and waited for Cas to look up at him. “This ain’t gonna end, you hear me? Even when we get up tomorrow, this…” he gave Cas a squeeze, “this is forever. You understand?”
Gabriel pounded his fist against the counter. “Argggghhh!!!”
“Would you like to dance with me?”
The Empty grimaced. “Why??? You were at peace before... you were happy! Why would you wake up AGAIN?!?”
Sam groans, bringing a hand over his eyes.
She sighed, taking a sip of her iced coffee. “Okay, I think it’s about time that we talk about... you know...”
Rowena looked back down at her phone. “In Paris, next Monday.”
“So I got a suit. What else do I need to bring to a wedding?”
“Ughhhhhhhhhhhh”
“I don’t think you understand what I mean. John is.... Dead. Dean’s visiting his parents’ graves.”
Castiel chuckled, barely audible over the music. It was as if his words were just for Dean.
“I love you, Dean.”
“... Are you a model?”
“Is there something wrong with that?”
Castiel let out a yelp in surprise. The young woman grinned mischievously at him.
Castiel eyes kept drifting over to the man.
“So you’re okay with giving them a present from the two of us?”
He was sitting by the window, face buried in his hands.
Castiel tried to fall back asleep, hand buried underneath Dean’s pillow.
“Yeah?”
They went to check out the book. Castiel got an.... interesting... look from the employees. One librarian winked at him and the other wiggled his eyebrows. Castiel was thankful that he was the only one able to see this. He would have died from embarrassment if Dean could see what they were doing.
The man’s voice was loud, making Castiel wince.
“Castiel Novak.”
Dean was still in a daze. His only remaining brain cell was screaming for him to get down and one knee and ask the model to marry him. Just skip all the dating and shit. He wanted Cas.
“Okay.”
He got into the shower, realizing a second too late that the water was ice-cold. Dean cussed, running a tired hand over his face. The water heater must have broken. Again.
Castiel took deep breaths, trying his best to stay calm. Lucifer sat in the other chair, getting ready to appear in front of an audience.
Too late to stop Dean now. He might as well just watch his brother make a fool of himself and hope that it works out.
“Rowena? Just let me sleep”
It was a new normal for him.
The hunter talked to people less and less. He didn’t even hum Metallica to himself anymore. The only thing Cas usually heard at this point was the occasional exhale.
Dean glared at the Cafe owner. “Are you... are you keeping score???”
“It should be burgers, Gabe! No one likes tacos anymore”
So where did he go?
Okay... so a super charming and hot bartender lives only a floor above him... That doesn’t change anything
Dean heard, as usual, the door swing open. The person sat down at one of the stools by the counter, waiting for Dean to swing around to them.
Dean’s POV:
“And Castiel, what was Meg like in high school?”
Together....
Dean felt a flutter in his stomach. He walked over, forgetting that he was only wearing sweatpants and a baggy T-shirt.
Dean’s POV:
Sam and Gabriel exchanged a frown.
The teen then squealed, revealing the second slide of his very boring-but-not-boring PowerPoint.
It took a moment for his rival to react. At first he just seemed confused. “You want to get a.... OH!!!”
Dean, distracted by his opponent, failed to realize that a witch was about to jump him.
Sam took a deep breath and walked over. “Cas.... I’m not sure you want to know.”
Dean was the ‘I’ll sleep when I’m dead’ type of person. He would use almost every waking moment working towards something productive. He hadn’t taken a break from work for as long as he could remember.
Why, Sam had no idea. Maybe it was because Dean was waiting for his brother to find someone first. Or possibly, he was scared.
Castiel’s alarm went off soon after, signaling that it was time for him to go.
“It was... boring. How was work? Meg told me that you had a gig in New York.”
“His smile isn't sexy enough”
Only then could he ask.
Castiel then left so he could go home and unpack. Apparently, the model came to the restaurant straight from the airport. Dean was touched by the model’s determination to make things better.
If Castiel noticed him flinch, he didn't say anything, wrapping his hand around the cup. Dean let go, walking back to the other counter to grab his own mug. His cheeks burned, and his heart was racing.
The Empty was just as lonely as the last time he’d been there. It was endless, cold...
“But I was goin’ to ask my angel to marry me!”
The man interrogated him, asking about his childhood, job, celebrity life, whatever came to mind.
After prompted by Cas, Dean retells some of his own childhood stories. He reminisces over his and Sammy’s experience on growing up on the road, both his parents having jobs in the army.
Dean decided to go back to the restaurant. Sam told him to take the day off, but he needed a distraction from how he was feeling.
Castiel shifted in his seat uncomfortably, still feeling overwhelmed by the last set of questions.
Dean’s face burned, His throat dry.
Meg shrugged. “Okay”
Dean came back about a couple hours later, exhausted.
Castiel went into the kitchen and took his banana muffins out of a tin, placing the treats onto a plate. He walked over and handed Dean a muffin.
Dean went over to his brother to say goodbye. Sam was currently making a margarita for Karen.
Dean’s face burned when he spoke. “Hey, Gabe, can you get me another drink?”
His only saving grace has been Cas. The model did what he was told with no hesitation, learning quickly from his (very few) mistakes. It actually seemed like he was enjoying waiting tables! Despite being antisocial, the man talked fondly of the customers he had met.
Castiel sighed, pressing his hand against the door. “Dean. I promise it won’t be as scary as you think. The flight is only a few of hours... and I’ll—er—everyone will be there for you. If you need me—er—us, we will do everything to make the experience less terrifying.”
Dean tilted his head. “When is mama coming back, then?”
Dean and Castiel finished their walk in a companionable silence. The bar tender unlocked the bar door and held it open for Castiel. His stupid lopsided grin sent chills down his spine. Castiel made a beeline for the counter. Dean followed.
Kevin smiled. “Huh, I wonder what he’s doing.... or where he’s going. Let’s find out together!”
“I hope things go better for you tomorrow, Cas.”
“Yeah... yeah.”
Castiel felt a twinge in the back of his neck. He tried to cover up his involuntary wince.
Castiel had to say something—anything—just to stay awake.
Castiel just stared at the Empty.
Castiel turned and left, almost sprinting out of the building. His rib cage was pounding, and his hands shook.
Dean felt like the entire world had crumbled around him.
Dean grimaced. Should he tell his brother that the water heater is broken, or should he just let him figure it out himself?
The model huffed tiredly, rubbing his eyes. “Now I am.”
Dean could not sleep.
Nope. He is not doing this...
Then it clicked
His eyes drag across Cas’ body. He had ditched the trench coat and jacket, now only wearing a dress shirt and pants. If it was anyone else, Dean would have thought they were overdressed.
After twenty minutes or so, the songs shifted from heavy guitar solos to... something else.
Bobby returned his hand to Castiel’s back. “Dean seems to be very fond of you. He kept calling me over the summer to boast about your Braille. Apparently you’re a fast learner. Oh—and he mentioned how you always walk with him to work.... he likes that. A lot.”
Dean’s interest was peaked. “What color is his hair?”
Rowena gave him a knowing smile.
Dean spluttered. “Huh?”
Dean scoffed. “I don’t know if you two remember, but I’m blind.... so are you going to tell me who this guy is or what???”
“Gabriel... I hope you don't mind me mentioning this, but Dean brought something up yesterday. I wanted to know how to approach the situation without making him feel uncomfortable.”
Dean held up a hand, silencing him. “We can try to make other arrangements, but for now you stay with me!”
Castiel walked behind the counter, stopping about three feet away from him. He spoke, his voice trembling.
The model looked down at the teen, who was staring back in admiration.
“This would be the kitchen...”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “I—Sam’s and Gabe’s wedding is in five weeks, and they want me to bring a plus one. I haven’t found anyone yet...”
Hey, everyone, I hope you enjoy!
Bobby showed Cas around while Dean sat on the couch.
Dean was still shocked. Castiel actually lived in the same apartment complex!
‘Wow. Castiel Novak walking with a handsome stranger! Who could he be?’
Dean laughed. “You really haven't heard of it? It’s about two brothers who hunt monsters and the paranormal.”
UGHHHHHH
The wait wasn't long. Within twenty minutes, Sam was exiting the airport. Dean grinned, getting out of the car and walking up to him. He wrapped his brother in a bear hug before grabbing his suitcase.
I hope you enjoy this chapter!
By the time he made it to his plane seat, his face was hidden tiredly in his hands. Last time he was on a plane he was holding Dean’s hand.
This was the only person in the entire world for him.
Dean offered him a giddy grin. His eyes glinted with excitement as he spoke. “Yup. I have somethin’ important I need to do.”
He phased in and out of sleep, a sense of calm overwhelming his senses. He only felt warmth, pressing up against his stomach and chest.
Dean ignored the wave of disappointment that washed over him when Castiel let go of him.
Dean choked back a sob, voice trembling. “I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye—I didn’t get to tell you how much you mean to me. Now you’re gone, and I can’t tell you...”
Who would get the bed? Who would have to suffer via couch?
Dean chuckled quietly, squeezing his brother’s hand. “I was.... Just thinking about a conversation I had with Cas this morning. What’s it to you?”
“Dean, who are you going to propose to?”
Had he gone to far?
Castiel tried on his one thousandth suit. Meg hummed in thought, looking him over.
So Dean took a shower, standing numbly underneath the falling water. He had no idea how long he was in there. The steaming water became ice cold with time, but the man barely noticed.
About two hours later and the man STILL hasn’t left.
The receptionist frowned. “Castiel Novak?”
“This is great news! It means that more people will want to work with you.... but.....”
