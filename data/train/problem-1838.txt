Sherlock stepped deeper into the shadows of the park letting the cool brush of the plants envelope him. He breathed in more of the smells of loamy earth and rich, growing things, letting it fill something inside of him that he hadn’t realized was empty. He felt a weight roll off his shoulders as he relaxed, letting his mind merge with the quiet around him.
John called a Council of Elders meeting before bedtime that night to listen to news Kira brought with her. John, Sherlock, and Lupaza had fallen into being in charge as instigators of the farm project, but others with good skills had joined them as time went on. They had an elderly woman who had been trained as a doctor before the occupation, and a jovial man with engineering knowhow who seemed to have naturally risen as a problem solver around the farm.
“You could say that.” Sherlock winced. “I’m sorry he was bothering you.”
Sherlock and John had sneaked off to their room for a quiet afternoon kip together. It felt horribly indulgent, but pure bliss to lie next to John in the heat of the day, an arm slung over his belly, cool air from the vents blowing over them as they dozed. Of course when they woke, it had been only natural to roll together, and trade lazy kisses that led to soft love making.
“I missed you too.” John allowed himself to be manhandled into place, burying his face in Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock reared back and dropped a harder crack against John’s right inner thigh. John finally made a noise at that, deep in his throat.
“My boyfriend,” John said proudly.
It was chilly work cleaning off the sand that had gotten simply everywhere, splashing in the river. They found clothes, and redressed, despite being still damp, the cloth clinging to wet skin. Looking decent enough, they headed back to the house, much calmer than they had set out.
look suspicious if all of his dorm mates went truly mad.
“Sorry,” Alastaire Holmes sneered.
John squirmed a bit in his seat, starting to wonder at how nosy the cleaning staff seemed to be. “Yes, thanks. I don’t believe I caught your name?”
“YOU BASTARD.” Someone entered the room with a battle cry as Alastaire jerked off his feet to fly through the air. The knick-knacks rattled in the cabinets as he hit the wall and slid to the floor. Sherlock flicked his wand again, and a bright red cut appeared over Alastaire’s cheek.
“Hey, can you come down?”
“Well, I do have internet access, and I make it back to London on occasion. Beekeeping isn’t all that I do. I’m a consulting detective.  New Scotland Yard contacts me when they’re out of their depths, which happens really quite frequently.”
“That was . . . kind of you to ask me.”
Sherlock let John drive home, positively insisting on it. John felt a bit nervous at first, being responsible for such an expensive car, but his joy at handling it soon burned through any misgivings.
“It makes me so angry. I wish I could do more, but . . .”  Molly cut off as her husband joined them.
“Jenna? Please take any messages I receive. I’m going out for a moment.”
“SHERLOCK.”
“Bedwarmer,” Sherlock said again, thinking aloud. “Is that some sort of euphemism for rent boy?”
John interrupted his woolgathering, appearing beside him with two mugs of tea.
“Alright, thanks.” John bowed his head, stretching the lovely, long muscles cording down his neck.
“Wow, it’s just lovely.” John inhaled deeply, looking about.
“Well, that’s not right.” John frowned.
Eerily enough, his eyes flickered to the side that John was standing on. “You will find a meaningful sum has been deposited into your account with the Bank of England. You are free to go wherever you wish once you have been transported off the island facility.  Please make yourselves ready to depart. Transport should arrive within twenty-four hours. Good day, gentlemen.” With that, the phone shut off.
“ARE YOU 17 YEARS OLD OR OLDER?” It asked. “READY TO APPARATE ON YOUR OWN?”,  "GET CERTIFIED NOW!"
"Will you move your handsome ass? There's the door."
“Come on, we’ll both think better on a full stomach.”
Sherlock mumbled something affirmative, and settled back under the covers.
Fatima, Seth, and Winston just shrugged at each other, but looked sympathetic all the same.
The morning had started out so beautifully, waking late to the sun streaming in the dorm windows, a gorgeous boyfriend snoring slightly in his ear. John had stretched, and contemplated which part of Sherlock he was going to nibble at first when a polite throat clearing turned his head. Mycroft Holmes was sat with a newspaper on a padded swivel chair that John was certain hadn’t been in the room when they’d tumbled into bed last night. John blushed when he thought about what he’d been doing with Mycroft’s little brother just a few hours before. He was grateful the man hadn’t arrived any earlier.
“You alright, babe?”  John poked his head into the bedroom.
“This flat is in Muggle London,” Sherlock said securing a towel around his waist. “I got a good price for it as I know the landlady. There’s any number of good restaurants nearby we could choose from.”
Instinct and muscle memory took over as Sherlock blocked the attack. Kira cried out and tried again, swinging a kick that Sherlock easily turned aside. She tried again, and things sped up or slowed down as Sherlock’s perception narrowed to nothing but the geometry of  bodies moving in space, strike and counterstrike, heartbeats soaring as he fended off the storm of pure fury that was Kira Nerys. She was good, well-trained in a variety of techniques, and it seemed the fight would come down to a test of stamina as neither gained the upper hand in the blur of moving limbs.
“Wow, Puddlemere’s doing well,” John said, glancing toward the game as the goal tally flashed over the screen.
“I heard some of my father’s men talking about it.” Sherlock shrugged. “I had to see it. I knew you’d say no, if I asked you.”
“It is not just a PR event. It’s a chance to see people. I’d really like to go, and I’d like you to come with me. Besides, Teddy’s an orphan, Owen is Muggle-born, and most of Victoire’s family already works at the Ministry. They don’t have that many other people to ask.”
A symphony of grunts, and groans, and delicious noises of near pain issued from John as Sherlock rotated the toy slowly inside him.  Sherlock placed a hand on his hip. He could
“So, he’ll be staying, what? Another day? A week?” John’s forehead puckered.
“We might have some midnight requisitioning going on here,” the Glinn said. “I’ll need your discretion in investigating this, soldier. Your office may be compromised. You have to keep this inquiry completely under wraps.”
“Ooh, what to do, what to do.”  John tapped the tip of the wand against his chin, looking about the room as a maniacal gleam rose in his eyes.
“What?” Sherlock leaned in as well.
“Good man. Take your seat, son.” Lestrade sent him off with a pat on the back.
John didn’t need to be told twice. He grabbed his own jacket and hurried behind.
Sherlock let the hot spray run over him, nearly groaning at how good it felt. Once he had soaped up, and used John’s cheap 2-in-1 shampoo, he could move without feeling as if his head were about to topple off. Putting his suit on, rumpled as it now was, slid his armor back into place, and he was feeling much more in control when he stepped back into the main room.
Sherlock whipped out his reader to scan the chips in their uniforms watching as their names popped up on the screen. “Well, Private Boca, and Private Evek, I see nothing fun in deserting your post, and endangering the well being of a law-abiding citizen. This is shameful behaviour. I’ve a mind to report this to your commanding officer.”
Sherlock floated in a world of John, John's scent enveloping him, John’s amazing mouth moving over him, mapping out the edges of his cheeks, and jaw, marking the boundary of his warming skin and the cooler air beyond. It felt marvelous, but still, Sherlock missed the feel of John’s mouth on his own, and he chased after him, sighing when their lips connected.
“Ooh, time for the summer display, then?” Sherlock glanced over to see a couple of the estate agents had gathered to watch their progress. A tall and a short woman - he’d never bothered to learn their names.
“Mmm.” Sherlock snuggled closer to burrow his nose against John. “I like it when you smell like this.”
Sherlock glanced about the room as his eyes adjusted to the light, trying to take in everything at once. Faded tapestries graced the stone walls, while a scattering of old, mismatched pieces made up the furniture in the room. Sherlock was momentarily surprised to realize that he recognized both the chairs and the floral rug across the floor. In a previous life, they had sat in their entry hallway before Mummy’s big redecorating project a few years ago. It was passing odd seeing the familiar things rendered almost exotic in their strange, new home.  A set of shelves crammed with any number of books, and knick-knacks drew him like a magnet. He’d already cataloged most of the contents, and was sticking his head into a narrow wardrobe, accidentally jostling the things crammed inside when John’s arm shot out to ease him back.
“Ah, so soon?” A creased formed between John’s eyebrows.
“What? SHERLOCK?” Harry leaned forward to peer at him. “That Cardassian kid at the Holmes house?”
“Did you kill him?” John panted.
He was about to slide the drawer closed when something caught his eye. What at first glance appeared to be the bottom of the drawer was in fact a piece of heavy card stock. Sherlock lifted it up to reveal a false bottom, secured by a combination lock with 16 dials, each containing a complete set of letters. Turning the card stock over in his hand, Sherlock read the message printed on the back:
Sherlock faltered for half a second, his smile slipping only slightly. When he came back online, he had somehow morphed into Albert, an absolutely flaming man who worked at Harry’s beauty salon.
“Well, of course the prawn rolls.” John scanned the starters section. “That goes without saying.”
“No, no, I understand. It’s fine.” Sherlock pulled John into his arms, wanting to kiss the sadness off his face.
“It really is.”
“I can’t tell you how many
John eased off, releasing Sherlock from his mouth with a last reluctant lick.  “Oh, you’re a bonny one for sure.”
enjoy our time together.”
“No, some of them are being particularly difficult, could take some time.”
John bought a ticket and boarded the train when it was called, settling himself into an open seat. He stared glumly out the window as they left the station, watching as the rows of tidy houses slid by. They all looked so settled and proper, he imagined the people within somehow had their lives together, knew what they were doing, ate granola for breakfast, and hadn’t managed to scare away the love of their lives by being big knobheads. John sighed extravagantly. When the scenery melted into nothing more interesting than fields and hedgerows, John settled back, letting the motion of the train soothe him. He felt tired down to his bones.
“Long time, no see,” Galen said, smiling broadly enough to reveal his two gold teeth.
“Yeah, alright.” John let him take them.
“I’m not sure,” Sherlock lifted a shoulder, “but it’s still excellent information, and hopefully something we can use to our advantage.”
“God, I love how you DO that.” John leaned in as the waitress scurried off.
“Well, it’s just that it’s a bit rude.” The Little Hobbit shuffled his furry feet against the ground hoping to stave off the inevitable. “I’d rather not say it aloud.”
Later when they’d cleaned up and lay wrapped together under the blanket, just breathing in each other’s air, Sherlock reached up to run a finger down John’s face. Sometimes he still couldn’t believe John was here, here in his arms, here in his life.
“That’s not what people normally say.”
“No I guess not, I just wanted to make sure . . .”
“Who are you?” he asked stupidly, rising to his feet. Sherlock had spent a good bit of time in the back garden, and this was the first time he’d ever encountered another child in it. He noticed that he was a bit taller than the strange boy.
John finally stopped, lifting his head at Sherlock’s entreating tone. “Alright, love, no worries.”  He let the little bee flutter back to its usual place along Sherlock’s left bicep.
“Oh, I’ll bet not.” Irene laughed. “All right Sherlock, you aren’t allowed to keep him chained in your bed the whole week.”
Still, the lock remained stubbornly closed. They went down through their list, tweaking one entry after another to fit the sixteen letter requirement, but to no avail.
“From your mouth to the Prophets’ ears.” Kira smiled, pointing upward.
“It’s just so good to have you here  . . . finally.”
“It’s not necessary. We just dined.” Sherlock’s rich voice rolled out to fill the beige-walled space.
They had plowed most of the way through the third bottle when John brought up Sherlock and couldn’t seem to stop.
He could break the hold, flip Anderson onto his back, but it would bring unwanted attention he couldn’t afford. He sighed and let the man chivvy him onward.
“Sorry to bother, you,” he said. “Just thought I’d get your clothes to the cleaners?”
“The prodigal sons return!” Bill called out.
“I know what boys like . .  I know what they want . .” John crooned, half-tripping over his own feet.
“Oh, God, yes. Keep doing that and I might forgive you for doing this to me, you unspeakable Alpha brute.” Sherlock groaned as John’s fingers dug into just the right spot.
“God, Sherlock, I’m sorry. I didn’t think . . . it’s been awhile.” John drew in a ragged breath, still trying to get his bearings.
“I wasn’t sure if we’d have time to go shopping in London, so I had Simpson fetch your new schoolbooks.” She nodded toward the pile of books stacked on a nearby chest of drawers.
“AAAArrr, Mycroft.” Sherlock whinged, swallowing hard. “Tomorrow’s our last day. I wanted to spend it all here, not go back earlier for
“ . . . is that all you want, a quick bang, and out the door?” Sherlock’s lower lip trembled.
“Okay. G’nite.” Mike waved as he made it into to his room.
“How lovely.  Still, if anyone is bothering you here, you will let me know?”
“Not random, and not just letters. Note how many times the X appears, along with other mathematical symbols.”
“John made it bearable.” Sherlock lifted a shoulder.
“We’ll have the Kovats start it.”
“Come on. I already got some money sent to me from my grandparents as a gift.” Sherlock pulled the transfer chip out of his pocket. “We can do some
John smiled as his lips brushed Sherlock’s lovely, plush mouth. A sweet thing quickly turned to molten lava, fire racing through John’s veins as their mouths parted and tongues leapt to twine together. Somewhat frantically they thrust restricting clothes aside, battling with buttons as hungry mouths sought out each new inch of flesh revealed. Finally, finally stripped bare, they rolled back together. John groaned, reaching down for a handful of Sherlock’s sweet, plump arse, a spot that was quickly becoming a favorite resting place of his.
So, I should probably leave a note of condolence to anyone who's been following along with this fic as I write it. I think it was 3 months between the last chapter and this one. Sadly S4 happened, and it really kicked my butt. It's taken me a little while to have the energy to come back to this story. I love these space boys too much to leave them hanging though, and I am back on the job now, wrapping up their tale of love, loss, and redemption. Hopefully updates will happen much more regularly. ^.~
“St. James Park is the tube stop closest to Scotland Yard. You'll need the Central or District line to reach it. ” Victor leaned against the door frame. "There's a station at the end of the street." He tipped his chin toward the windows.
“They’re like animals, Sherlock. They aren’t the same as you or me.”
They moved to settle into the chairs as the man slipped into the back of the store.
“We can’t keep meeting here in this park,” John said once their chuckles had died down. “People will notice.”
“Ow. Wha?” John blinked his eyes back open.
“Yes, sir. He is.” John could feel his own chest inflating with pride.
“What, at Scotland Yard?”
"Time's up! I hope you're ready." He slides his double chocolate wand of wonder inside. John exhales with odd hiccup-like sounds.
“All right.” Sherlock couldn’t fault his logic. He accepted the bottle with a small smile. “Thank you.”
John looked lovely, bubbling over, but Sherlock could see a tightness around his eyes. “Christmas didn’t go well with your family?”
“John!” Sherlock looked up, an expression of pure delight flooding his face when he spied him.
“You as well, bibi.” The man nodded respectfully enough, though he continued to watch them as they made their way through the shop.
Sherlock’s smile dropped. “Are all those things mutually exclusive?”
“The bastard.” Sherlock nearly vibrated with the sudden anger coursing through his veins. John was a standard year older than Sherlock, but he was small for his age, even for a Bajoran. The idea of a fully-armed guard knocking John to the ground . . .
“I don’t have a family crest.”
“Of course not,” The tallest boy spoke up. “It’s for the Resistance.”
The wedding was a lovely affair held in a small church a few minutes away from the hotel. Harry and Clara had both looked radiant in frothy white things, repeating their pledges earnestly to each other. John had stood next to Harry while Clara’s two sisters, Amy and Livie, had been beside her in long navy dresses. The group moved back to the hotel after, the reception being held in a large function room downstairs.
“Possibly. I thought it was something we might like to try . . .  together.”
John obviously noticed him because a minute later, he had popped off to get another cup of warm punch that he presented to the musician, leaning in to speak to him as he glanced back at Sherlock. Sherlock tried to wave him off, but soon enough the old Bajoran man was cheerfully accepting the drink and passing his violin and bow to Sherlock to borrow.
“John.” Sherlock looked up, surprised, pulling his nose from the textbook in his hand.
“It’s always a good time for a Cornetto,” John insisted.
Puzzled but thirsty, John reached for a glass of lemonade. He’d swallowed half of it down when Sherlock strolled up, now decently covered in a long robe with Claudette at his side.
A small crowd gathered to watch the performance on a side stage, a peepshow really, held behind a plexiglass screen. A couple of women were going at it fast and furious with a large purple dildo, one, nude, bent over a chair, while a women in a mesh catsuit behind her pumped the toy rapidly into her. Irene could see a collection of dildos lined up on a small table to the side of the busy couple. They seemed to be working their way up in size – there was only one silicon prick bigger than the one the catsuit woman had in her fist plunging in and out of the prone one.  The fuckee opened her mouth wide in a rapture of pain or pleasure, but Irene could tell she was faking the whole thing. She’d be kicking back with a sandwich in about ten minutes when the curtains drew shut.
“Just so,” Sherlock replied. “Plus I’ve got to go home and shave.” He lifted his hand to rub over the suggestion of dark hair prickling at his jaw. “You don’t seem to own a razor.”
John peered into the envelope, "Dangerous, no. Cryptic, yes."
“Whatever for?” John looked up as he kept pace beside him.
“I’m here, I’ve got it,” the plummy voice said. Oh, Alastaire. Alastaire Holmes?
John nodded, not trusting himself to answer, and escaped into the corridor.
“John, good morning. You made it.” Bianca’s white teeth flashed in her tan face, as she smiled first at John then turned to include the rest of the group in her goodwill. She was dressed in a more functional blue robe today, her hair pulled tightly back, but looked none the less attractive for it.
“What? Are you mental?” John’s eyes flew open wide. “I was talking with Victoire, and she told me what a big deal this Herr Moser bloke is. It will be okay, yeah? I mean we were going to be apart next year anyway. This just means we’ll be traveling by portkeys instead of simply apparating to be together, but we’ll make it work.” John paused to draw in a breath, his eyes searching Sherlock’s. “Love, say something.”
“Excellent.” Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and tugged him down the hall. “I want to show you the plants I’ve been working on.”
“I’m sorry I scared you.”
“I, erm wanted to let you know, I don’t often . . .”
John gave him the digits, and Sherlock punched them into his mobile. Shortly after he sent the message, a guitar riff sounded from the nearby kitchen, something bluesy and yearning.
“Please don’t ever hide yourself from me again. I want you, John. All of you, regardless of this wereslut business. I  . . . love you.”
“It’s dangerous,” Victor admitted. “The waves on the beaches there, you really need respect for them. After you’ve been dragged under a few times you start longing for a good old English tidal pool.”
“Mind if I take a peek?” Lestrade motioned toward his cauldron.
“What HAPPENED? You didn’t say a word!” Victoire exclaimed.
“Well, have fun,” John said. “I’ve a maths exam in just a few minutes.”
“Don’t thank us yet, Cardassian,” Lupaza said, hitting the accelerator as soon as they cleared the wall of rocks. “We’re not completely out of the woods.”
“Hey, love.” John smiled apologetically. He made a point of kissing Sherlock hello.
Many thanks to SmirkDoctor and Wikipedia for giving me SOMETHING to say about organic chemistry. I majored in art. I know nothing about organic chemistry . . . we'll just roll with it, right? ;)
“You’ll tell me if you don’t like anything? Immediately?”
“Thanks, John.” Victoire reached out to pat his arm.
“That you care for him, that you fancy him. Does he know?”
“‘Why should I give it?’”
“Well, it’s bloody brilliant.” John grinned. “But enough. It’s just you and me now. Would you like to join me in the bath?”
“So, was he alright?”
“I’ve no idea,” John sighed.
Sherlock,” he’d laughed.
“Sherlock!” Molly waved him over to her table at the restaurant.
“He tells me that Sherlock is living with a friend now, a fellow intern named Irene Adler? He’s doing quite well at his workshop, developing some new potions. Mycroft thought you might like to know.”
“Why don’t we take off a layer, and lie down. I’d just like to hold you if that’s okay?”
“It was common enough news, but yes, I did.”
“We’ve as much right as you to be here.” A round brunette called back, raising her chin. “What are you meant to be anyway?” She asked, peering closer at Teddy’s grey hairless skin.
“We could make a trade. I could get you a whole bag of pot for a spell.”
When John returned from the loo, wrapped in another of the hotel’s dressing gowns, Sherlock had gotten dressed and laid the meal on the table by the windows in the sitting room.
“Ah, forget I mentioned it.” Sherlock unlocked the doors, and they both slid into their seats.
His phone buzzed as an answer finally arrived.
“I know. I love you, too.”
“Bloody wanker, that one. With your own cousin.”
“What the . . .” John felt words leaving him as a heat rose over his face.
“Do you know what I keep thinking about? What I wish I hadn’t done?”  John asked at length.
“Oh my God, yes.” John kissed him like there was no tomorrow.
He’d gone to Hogwarts shortly thereafter, and found a variety of new things to occupy his time. Like much of his childhood, he’d simply left the hobby behind.
“Ah, John. It means we have another mystery to solve.” Sherlock grinned.
Sherlock could see what the boy planned to do even before he had fully moved, the minute shifting of his weight, the flick of his eyes, and the twitch of his muscles all radiated his intent. Almost in slow motion he watched as the boy pulled an arm back, ready to swing it in an arch toward his jaw. Sherlock shifted so that he was now to the side of the boy, plucked his wrist out of the air and used his attacker’s own momentum to invite him lie down on the ground. When time resumed its normal pace, Ro Anton had landed on his back in the dirt with a thud and a very indignant look on his face.
“Yes, yes, yes,” Sherlock ground out hardly knowing what he agreed to as John’s mouth slid over him, finding all his secret places with his warm, probing, clever tongue, fingers wrapping around his cock.  It was heaven, it was John, it was . . . all thought processes left Sherlock as he exploded, white-hot bliss rolling over him. John gathered him close, holding him as the tremors stilled.
“Aha, got you little fishie!” Sherlock crowed.
John went through the motions of assembling his ingredients while his mind wandered off.  Hopefully, Sherlock would be arriving some time that very evening. John already had permission to spend the whole weekend in the village.  The rest of the school day was an aching desert, a vast wasteland of time to cross before he could reach his oasis of wrapping his arms around a certain skinny Wizard. John couldn’t wait to see Sherlock in the living, breathing flesh again. The idea, the very idea that he might be soon listening to that deep voice rolling out in person, that he might feel those dark curls under his fingers, or watch Sherlock’s lovely face moving as he explained something, God, he couldn’t wait . . .
“Always.” Sherlock stepped back avoiding her reach. He bit into the muffin, enjoying the earthy burst of flavors over his tongue. “Mmm, this good.”
“Oh, sorry.”
“John, thank you.”
John risked another glance down. He almost couldn’t believe it, the great Sherlock Holmes on his knees servicing him. John could have wept if the man in question hadn't been turning him inside out with that clever tongue and those take-me-downtown-and-keep-going lips.
“Oh, yeah, sure.” John nodded. It wouldn’t hurt anything to simply try something on.
They managed to pull back the duvet and burrow under together.  John ran his mouth over Sherlock’s neck, finally able to give it the love it deserved. He moved to suck at the spot where it sloped into his gorgeous shoulders, and Sherlock groaned, something deep and seismic, his hands cradling John’s arse, pulling him close. They rocked together, a heat building, sparking embers that had simmered between them all day. John made sounds, high and desperate as Sherlock kneaded at his sensitive flesh. John rolled back slightly, worked his hands down, down, finally slipping under Sherlock’s waistband, his fingers finding soft skin and coarse hair.
“This is a surprise. I wasn’t expecting you at all,” Sherlock said, collecting himself a bit to step forward, half in, half out of the door. “It’s just . . . I’m sorry, the place is such a mess . . .” He gestured vaguely toward the room inside.
John pushed more upright, growing more pensive as he stared into the depths of the flames.
“Arms down, please.”
“Well,” John said as the door clicked shut behind the madman. “I guess that’s told me, then.”
As it was, they didn’t manage to get the soil reclaimator that day, but they did get things ready for their scavenger mission. They decided it was too risky to continue using the stolen groundcar. An old broken farm truck sat in the back of the garage, and Sherlock suggested trying to cannibalize parts from the newer car to fix it.
Sherlock hadn’t realized he’d slipped back into speaking Bajoran again. “Nothing, just telling her good-bye. It helps to speak some of the language of the people you’re patrolling, you know.”
“Oh, no. He’s not.” John coloured a bit when he realized it had never occurred to him to even ask. “Vic, we never really talked about Rhys, I’m sorry if it’s weird  . . . that we started going out.”
Sherlock swallowed as John turned to face him. Best get this over with he thought. “John, I understand if you want to leave . . .”
“What’s that?” Sherlock had slipped his headphones off to peer at John’s progress.
“Good.” Rhys nodded, flexing the arm in question. “I mean, you broke it in three places, but Madame Comfrey fixed it. I only had to stay in the infirmary overnight.
“Quite.” Sherlock returned the box to on the edge of the bed, folded hands in his lap, and stared down at them.
08. Help Me Rhonda
“Indeed?” Sherlock felt a heat stealing over him.
“So you weren’t gay and then you went gay?” Owen took a drink, and passed John the bottle.
It took John a second to realise what he was looking at, “Blueprints? It looks like the floor plan for this building. What are we supposed to do with this?”
sideswiped him. John pushed back, unable to hold still any longer. His untouched cock bobbed up to hit his belly, and he whimpered slightly.
Sherlock simply nodded at him as he climbed in, conscious that refusal wasn’t an option. Of course Mycroft’s smug face waited to greet him from the car’s cushy interior.
“Come on, John. To multiply by 15, just add half of your original number and then multiply by 10.”
“Hmmm.” Sherlock looked thoughtful for a moment. “He did at that.”
John sighed, disappointed to miss yet another night with him, but thrilled to see the word “love” in Sherlock's slanted handwriting just the same.
“I’m having a lie in every day,” Teddy declared as they found their seats on the Hogwarts Express.
Sherlock showed him, and dutifully John helped him drag the device up and reposition it farther along the field.  They came outside every morning before noon for several days, moving the cross around the island so Sherlock could tilt the crossbeam and measure the angle between the shadows of the nails and the hanging plumb line.  John admitted to not completely understanding the whole process, but simply enjoyed trailing after Sherlock, and basking in the good weather.
“John. John, are you ready?”
“I don’t know. I’ll get the manager.” The woman looked unsure.
“Yes, I just need to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind.”
“He could ask me to leave?” John felt a trickle of cold through his belly.
“Yes, alright,” Sherlock found himself nodding even though he knew John couldn’t see him.
Sherlock turned the hologram back on and flipped through the information on the band’s past performances. When he found a link to purchase some of their music, he punched his code in, and had it sent to his console at home. Sitting back, he watched idly as two Bajorans dressed in black appeared in front to clean up. During a more rousing section of the performance, glittery confetti had swirled down around the players, and it had left piles around the stage.
“Garret Kovat.” She managed.
John felt his face heat as he tried to shrink into his chair.  “He’s okay,” he mumbled.
“Sherlock, are you still exploding science labs?” She grinned.
“God, baby, yes,
“Doodle bug.”
Sherlock thought a moment. So much, so much swirling around his head. He ended up writing one word,
“Yeah, I should get out of this wet stuff.” John shook his fringe out of his eyes. “Don’t want to get sick.”
“Nothing too pressing, why?”
“Let it be done then.” Shakaar clapped his hands, and in a matter of moments, the crowd had moved back and a space was being marked across the floor with a bit of chalk.
John swallowed, and dutifully raised both arms above his head.
“No problem.”
“Your back foot was fine,” Sherlock said grumpily.
“Wait, I don’t have any condoms.” John’s face fell.
John pushed his hand up under Sherlock’s shirt in return and ran his hands up Sherlock’s back, pulling him closer.
“Yes, sir?”
“Yeah, okay . . .” John mumbled.
“It was hidden in the headboard,” Sherlock said, sliding down the bed to show John his find. It was small and thin, not unlike a pill carrier. Further examination revealed a top that screwed off.
John put water on for tea while Sherlock searched the pantry. He wanted to find something special, something that told John how much he’d come to mean to him over the last few months, but nothing seemed to fit the bill. He emerged a minute later with a few packets of the pasta thing that John seemed to like the most, and John pulled out a pot to heat it on the stove top.
“Well, okay then . . .”
“But that’s just it, the pheromones! They make people come after me.”
“It’s not that bad.”
“I wish Sherlock were still here. He could always get the house elves to fetch us pitchers of juice in the middle of the night,” Tom said as they made their way back to the common room.
“I dunno . . .” John began when Nigel, Mr. sea-slug-in-training himself, appeared to interrupt. “Sherlock, there you are! Look lively, man, I need donuts and tea in the conference room in fifteen minutes.”
John felt a panic rising as it became apparent that Sherlock didn’t plan on resurfacing before John had to go. He dithered about putting off leaving until the last possible minute, hoping against hope. Finally, John had to admit it was time to leave if he wanted to catch his portkey in time.
Mycroft couldn’t help it. He gasped as his cock engorged quite suddenly.
“Irene,” John sighed.
“John. What madness are you going on about?” Sherlock bristled, yanking the sheet up to better cover himself as he pushed to an upright position as well. The covers slipped further off of John leaving him nearly bare, but neither of them noticed at the moment as John continued to wail.
“Oh, nothing you’ll be uncomfortable with.  Nothing you aren’t already doing – besides holding a day job at a desk with computers. You’ll be much better suited to that anyway I think. You’ll direct supplies that the Resistance needs, while erasing your tracks. Perhaps you might pass the odd bit of information back and forth in confidence. Don’t worry, it will all be in support of your Bajoran friends.”
“Oh, this is lovely,” John said, dusting himself off as he surveyed the flower garden simply bursting with colour before them. He glanced back the way they’d come. The bushes looked even taller than they had on the other side, as impenetrable as a maze wall.
“Oh, well,” John pushed up to his elbows. “I don’t have to stay in here with you if you wanted some privacy. I’m sure there’s other rooms. The house is quite massive, isn’t it?”
“Try to get some sleep, alright?” she said.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock squinted up at his brother. “You aren’t going to be judging John are you?”
“God, that’s fantastic.” John’s smile lit the already bright room even more.
“It’s silly.”
“Hmph! I’m choosing the next game, and you had better play fair, or there will be consequences.”
Dinner turned out to be a merry affair. The owner of the restaurant knew the Holmes family well, and insisted on sending dish after dish of gorgeous food to their table to sample. They sipped ouzo and ate fresh seafood over flickering candles while Mycroft told such funny tales about some visiting dignitaries from the Balkans that even Sherlock had to giggle.
“Hullo.” The girl glanced up. “You could say that.” She wasn’t as young as she’d looked in the dimness of the bar. In brighter light, Irene could see a few fine lines tracking from the edges of her eyes, but what eyes there were. Pretty brown things, large like a puppy’s, but quick, assessing. She looked over Irene more closely, taking stock of her.
Before Sherlock’s higher brain could react, he let out a growl, deep and low from the back of his throat. The man’s eyes went round and he released Sherlock’s arm to take a step back. He moved quickly, but not quick enough to avoid being shoved against the wall. Sherlock caught the faintest whiff of Omega on the bodyguard at such close range.
“Well, then it’s bloody settled. You’re stuck with me.”
“Yes, good.” John yawned wide enough to crack his jaw.
The Little Hobbit had only a cursory idea of what the dwarves’ magic jewel looked like, but he’d been told he’d know it when he saw it.  His eyes grew round at the mounds of treasure heaped on the floor before him. Just as he thought he’d spied something twinkling and made to move closer, the coins shifted under his feet, and the mighty dragon’s head burst forth.
John’s eyes widened in surprise. It was called docking, he recalled. It wasn’t something he’d ever done with a partner, but it was strangely compelling to watch. John felt his own penis start to swell in response as the Germans managed to connect. The one in charge held his own cock and the skin of the other as he fucked his glans in alongside his friend’s. Some deliciously ragged breathing morphed into groans that led to thick pearls of come leaking out the sides of the stretched foreskin.
“At the
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said. “John this is my second cousin, Claudette.” He waved to indicate the curly-headed woman. “Claudette, this is my . . . boyfriend, John.”
Sherlock stiffened, a flicker of concern moving through his mind at being seen outside together, but he quickly relaxed into the pleasure of John pressed against him. Their mouths slotted together naturally, finding a familiar rhythm. He melted against John in a sigh.
“Love you, you git,” John whispered, pulling a corner of the duvet back for himself.
“I’m so sorry. I lost track  . . . I forgot I was in a Muggle place.”  Sherlock ducked his head.
“Can you walk?”
The man at the counter was pleasant enough, and Sherlock chatted with him as he waited for his items to be retrieved from the back.
“Sarah, look, fine. I’ve a patient coming in and I haven’t read their files yet. I’ll go. Okay? Can we discuss this later?”
“Yeah, alright.” John took it, and popped the cap open to coat his fingers with the slick. “How long, erm, how long has it been since you had someone here.” John reached out to run his fingers over Sherlock’s entrance, stroking gently before pushing a tip in.
“Christ, I know we had a huge lunch, but that’s the most walking I’ve done in months. I’m starving.”
“What’s that you said earlier? I go where needed? I serve with honour?”
“Brother . . . I . . .”
“Thanks so much!” John beamed at her as Sherlock frowned.
“What the hell?” John swore.
The services cumtoys offered varied from establishment to establishment. Some places went as far as to allow full body contact with the whores if you didn’t mind doing your business in view of the whole room. Others were strictly hands-off, enjoy the scenery, and shoot your load over their waiting skin from a distance. This place looked like a combination of the two. With the dear price of the cover charge, Irene wasn’t surprised at a little hands-on fun allowed on the floor.
“Yes, I do find an occasional change of scenery helps keep my state of mind in order.” Sherlock hefted his bag over his shoulder. “Just as long as you realize there won’t be any grand motorcycle chases or daring martial arts fights. This won’t be a BOND movie.”
The boys eventually waded out of the water to redress, even coaxing Teddy to stop sulking in the lake and join them. Sherlock produced a brisk warm breeze from his wand that he directed over them, putting their clothes and hair back to dry.
Sherlock smiled as he ran his fingertips over the written letters, smoothing the creases of the paper over and over as if handling the note might somehow bring him closer to John. Eventually he refolded it, slipping it carefully into his pocket again.
Sherlock came forward to gather John into his arms, shirt half open, sleeves flapping where he hadn’t secured them yet. John slid his hands around Sherlock’s waist, leaning in to smell the clean skin at the base of his neck. He felt the tension loosening from his shoulders.
A small roar of approval rippled from the crowd. This wasn’t a big game, but a fairly sizable group had gathered to watch the Saturday morning match.
The boys laughed, and any tension around the table eased.
“Right. Now just multiply by 10.”
“Yes, of course. No more lies. I’m done working for the Obsidian Order,” Sherlock's voice shook with the depth of his feeling. “I can’t go back to my old life though. I’m going to have to stay in hiding.”
“You never had bedtime stories when you were little?” John rounded on him.
John used the school owls after that, and redoubled his efforts sending letters twice a day. At first he’d written long, heartfelt missives, but eventually, he just boiled his letters down to something simpler.
John didn’t flinch. He merely reached out to lay a warm hand to Sherlock’s hip. “Was it on purpose?” he asked.
“Come on.” Sherlock lifted his skirts in one hand. “We have to hurry if we’re to catch the bus.”

“Six foot, one,” Sherlock supplied smoothly.
The Little Hobbit, who had found a treasure chest to hide behind, quaked all the way to his furry toes hoping he wouldn’t be found out.
“All right, John, another week.”
“Yes, dear, of course.” Rose waved him on.
“John, I’m serious.” Sherlock’s brows knit together. “I’ve never shared living quarters with anyone before. I’m afraid . . . I’ll bollocks it all up somehow.”
Sherlock flashed John a real smile as they turned back to face the man. John watched with awe as Sherlock proceeded to haggle as smoothly as any carpet seller in a Kandahar market, bringing the price of the vehicle down to something John might actually afford. Well, something he could afford with a borrowed down payment from Sherlock. Soon enough, they were back in the salesman’s office, and filling out paperwork. Sherlock passed the keys to John with a satisfied smirk.
He ended up popping a video into the player, a Bond flick he’d seen before and liked, but then he hardly watched that either.
The burned man chucked a dark canvas bag toward John. “He needs to wear it. Over the head.”
He opened a comm link, and called the front desk.
“Too tall for what?” Sherlock frowned.
“I’m sorry. I don’t mean to overstep.” The look on Victor’s face was almost contrite as he held up his palms. “Look, I can go.”
“Oh, John.” His mum went misty, grabbing a handful of her own napkins to wipe at her eyes. “I am happy. I want to pinch myself some days I’m so happy. I just didn’t want you and Harry to feel left out.”
Even though Sherlock had the trace-blocking technology on his private phone, there was no sense pushing his luck in using it too often. He refused to access it at his monitored flat, and he didn’t want to distract John from whatever it was he did with the Resistance.  Still he ached to send John messages through the day. He composed them in his head, unsent.
“Oh, John, I’m sorry. I forgot you can’t understand us.” Claudette turned concerned eyes his way. “It’s just that Etienne doesn’t speak English . . .”
“We might as well get food,” Mr. Holmes said with a wink. “No telling how long all these good-byes are going to take.”
“Can’t you get one this summer?” Sherlock tried to keep the whine from his voice. Surely the pesky need for paperwork could be taken care of easily enough.
“Ja. Good-bye then, have a safe trip.” Kurt nodded.
“Gant, we have no reason to doubt your stalwart expertise on this,” Kira added, diplomatically.
“I don’t actually work here.” Irene smiled wryly.
“Thank you.” Sherlock found his place again.
Gorgeous boy beneath rough weave or laced frills
Sherlock trailed his fingers over the stone countertop in the kitchen. The furnished flat he’d been given was simple in the way that only very expensive things can be. Some sleek, functional furniture, a full console wall, and a few tasteful pieces of art he would never have chosen himself made the whole of the décor. Of course concealed recording devices also lay tucked away throughout the place. Sherlock had located all the hidden bugs in the flat, but had prudently left them alone. If he disabled them it would only serve to have more and better devices slipped into his rooms when he was out . . . and a red flag added to his personnel record.
“Hey, you.” John tried to smile.
“Fine.” Sherlock braced himself for the impact of noise as they neared the front door.
“So long as it doesn’t involve explosive chemicals, I’m up for anything,” John said, opening the drawer. “What do you have in mind?”
“All right, fine. At least go get me another beer, huh?”
Still, it was no more and no less profound than their first kiss, or their first cuddle, or any of their other first times. Because it wasn’t about what they were
“Bye, Olivia, see you at the wedding!” John called.
“John, are you hungry we could go out .  . .”  Sherlock gestured toward the door. “I’m afraid I don’t keep much here.”
“Thanks, really. And thanks for the room too. It looks great.” John gestured to the tidied space around them.
“Naw, it’s fine.” John shrugged. “My older sister can be a real pill sometimes. I know how it goes with family.”
“It was loads of fun,” Sadiq said. “Bit crazy when the paramedics had to come for that girl passed out in the bushes though.”
John tapped his lip as he thought a moment. “I think it will be eight years this February." He held his glass up in toast. "The rest, as they say, is history." John took a sip.
“No, I don’t want you to go,” Sherlock's voice rumbled so deeply John could feel it vibrating against his back.
“John, care to join the doomed?” Mike nudged his ribs.
Sherlock could see the confusion on his students’ faces, but that was alright. At least no one was looking smug any longer.
“Thank you, ma’am.”
*****
“That’s fine then. Never mind. Oh, there’s your father.”
John had blinked his eyes clear to find that one curl that hung over the nape of Sherlock’s neck filling his vision. That curl tormented him. He actually found himself thinking about it at odd times during his day. It was like a punctuation mark, a comma, a pause as John waited for the next brilliant thing to come out of that clever mouth. For one mad moment, he’d almost leaned in and planted one sweet kiss to it, but for better or worse, the alarm had sounded, and the moment had passed. John had sighed, and rolled away from Sherlock to turn off the insistent bleep.
Sherlock pulled away to face John. “Bye.” He held his hand up in farewell.
“He’s from Yorkshire.” Sherlock tipped his head toward the door the clerk had disappeared through.
Sherlock set about making his contraption. With wood that they fetched from the woodshed, they managed to create two rough planks that Sherlock fashioned into a cross with the crossbeam attached lightly so it could rotate. He fussed for some time hammering in four protruding nails into the ends and sides of the beam and attaching the protractor in the center with a plumb line dangling from it before declaring it ready.
At a special request from the teachers for the younger students in the learning center, Sherlock had even made an appearance for a basic tutorial on computer safety. There were several consoles open in the community center, and though they were locked down with firewalls, adventurous souls could trip through the safeguards in place if they were determined. Sherlock came in to teach the children of the camp how to access the net safely. It was nearly lunch by the time he headed back to main house.
They moved through the cube room, the floor thankfully now clean, to find the door that would take them into the maze. Sherlock opened a blank page on the laptop, and turned the screen to its brightest level. Once they had unlocked the door. Sherlock led, holding the screen before him to light the way. John blew out a whistle.
“Yes  . . . no  . . . I . . . ”
After a conductor came around to check their passes, the group lapsed into a companionable slump. Tom, Dom and Owen started up a game of cards while Teddy dozed, and John gazed out the window at the passing scenery.
“Ooh, overseas post!” Victoire's eyes widened at the sight of the scroll. “Something important?”
“What?”
John followed him back to the front of the office, worry lines pinching the sides of his mouth. “What’s up, is it Harry?”
Owen waded toward the bank, valiantly trying to escape his fate, when a hand snaked up, dragging him under the surface of lake. He shrieked once, splashing wildly, before the water closed seamlessly over his head.
“The combination will be a sequence of sixteen letters,” he said. “Which of our entries might work?”
“My, my, my.” Grand-mère tutted, surveying the milk and glass shards across the floor. “Well, no matter, my dears.  It’s easily fixed.” She pulled out her wand, and with a wave, restored things back to rights.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But of course.” The man trilled a laugh. “You can’t trust rogue Alphas as far as you can throw them. Give me a bonded Alpha like yourself any day.”
He read Sherlock’s handwritten question aloud.
“And my terrible guests are finally back with the land of the living.” Victor spared them a smile as he turned back to the stove. “How loud do you two NEED to be in bed, hmmm? I hope the neighbors don’t complain.”
“Erm.” Sherlock wasn’t quite sure how to answer John. He was spared the onerous task of finding the perfect phrase when Tom peered over his shoulder and let out a cry.
“Right, I reckoned you two were busy, but Tom, Dom? What do you say?” John turned toward the twins.
“Word is they’re tightening food rations in the cities too,” Kira added. “People won’t take that lying down too long.”
“Is there a problem?” Sherlock arched an eyebrow.
Sherlock cocked his head and winced. “The violinist is too fast.”
“Okay,” John cleared his throat, holding the page upright, “Once upon a time there lived a young prince known as Sir Boast A Lot. It wasn’t his real name, but he was such an insufferable know-it-all, bothering everyone about the castle, that someone called him the nick-name and it stuck. Soon no one even remembered what the prince was actually called. Despite the name, the prince continued sticking his nose in where it didn’t belong. One day a woman, a distant relation, came to visit the castle. Unbeknownst to the prince, the woman was a powerful sorceress. When the prince insulted her that night at dinner, revealing private facts about herself for all and sundry to hear, the woman was enraged.”
“Guess today wasn’t their day, huh, traitor? We got the Bajoran scum though no thanks to YOU.”
We welcome your kind comments and kudos. 😊❤️😊
“Sherlock, I’m glad you and Irene are friends, but, well . . . Irene has Kate to go home to. Are you looking for anyone? A sweetie? I mean I know it isn’t approved of, but . . . I worry about you.”
“WHAAAAT?” Three people cried in tandem as all eyes swung John’s way.  It was John’s turn to colour up.
“Yes, what else?”
“I couldn’t get an exact location for her, but I know she was returned to Bajor five years ago. She was transferred from a space station called Terok Nor to a labor camp in the Southern hemisphere around B’hala.” Sherlock leaned forward slightly. “It was an agricultural plantation, not a mining camp,” he hastened to add. Casualties tended to be lower for farming details, and starvation was not such a risk there.
“Well, I need to . . .” Sherlock said, his eyes pulling back to John’s face.
“Yeah, well, I’m off to bed.” John stifled a yawn as he rose. “Thanks for the tea.”
The only time they left the base again was to travel to their shuttle at the space port. Sherlock and Mummy would be journeying to a nearby space station to catch an interstellar flight to Cardassia prime. Mycroft had already shipped out, returning to his army posting, and Father wouldn’t be joining them until later. They said their good-byes over breakfast, his father wishing them a good trip, giving Mummy a kiss, and Sherlock a pat on the head.  Sherlock had it planned, down to each variable. As their vehicle pulled away through the gates of the base, traveling toward the space port, Sherlock knew the best place to stop. He bent over, and began retching.
‘But you wrote your password for hobbits to read,’ the Little Hobbit managed to squeak.
Sherlock could see John in his mind’s eye, the long eyelashes that framed his glorious night-sky eyes as he gazed up at him. He’d clung to John, exchanging last lingering kisses before they had to say good-bye, slipping out separately from the safe house. It had only been two days since he’d lain naked in bed twined around John, and it already felt like an eternity.
The console in Sherlock’s flat chimed with an incoming call. He looked up from his solitary dinner at the kitchen island, surprised. No one ever called him at home.
“Yeah, in here.” His sister’s voice drifted down from upstairs.
Each time John felt himself getting too close to orgasm, he eased off on what he was doing, so that Sherlock would ease off on him, as well. By the sixth time he’d brought them both, groaning, to the edge, Sherlock couldn’t take any more. He broke down, begging.
“Sherlock, how could you possibly do that? It was thousands and thousands of pounds.” John had gone a bit pale.
Sherlock ducked his head, pulling in even tighter.
“John,” He jumped at the sound of Mycroft’s voice right by his ear. “I’m sure you can see that while Sherlock is quite intelligent in some ways, he can be rather ignorant in others.”
Sherlock arched his back at the delightful sensation, and no more words were exchanged beyond groans and sighs for quite some time.
“Pardon me,” Sherlock purred. “It looks as if you dropped something.”
“Fuck, yes, fuuu . . .” John exploded, spurting hot warmth over Sherlock’s hand as his orgasm shook through him.
They chatted amiably about the merits of Asian cuisine, and the uses of a new medication the reps were pushing until the afternoon patients began trickling in. John felt like a heel as he moved to bin his trash. He’d just negated Sherlock’s entire existence with a casual deflection. He wanted to go back, and tell Sarah,
“Oh.” Sherlock sucked in a breath. “You too, John.”
“Well, Sherlock is doing fine, we’re both doing fine, thanks.” John was starting to find the oddly posh man very irritating. He took a last swallow to finish his glass.
The reception in the British embassy was filled with the usual boring government cogs, a handful of sham wannabes, and just enough dangerous elements to make it interesting. Sherlock filtered his way through the gathering, accepting a glass of wine from a tray to pass from group to group, smiling, shaking hands and generally playing the charming gadfly. He had half of his mission fulfilled in a matter of minutes, determining quickly who was blackmailing who, who was sleeping with whom, and who was ready to do something stupid for the sake of assorted ignoble causes. Sherlock sighed, and tipped his glass back to finish it off.
“I’ve been better.” Shakaar chuckled. “Well, why don’t we take this somewhere more comfortable?” He gestured expansively in the direction of the stairs. “We can sit, have a drink, talk awhile.”
“Hey, hey.”  John reached up to smooth back the hair that had tumbled across Sherlock’s forehead. “I’m fine. Really.” The fit of coughing that followed seemed to belie his words.
“Oh, okay. I could come with you.” John rubbed at the grit in his eyes, trying to wake up. There was something so restful about Sherlock’s bedroom. It was like a river of slumber that pulled John under.
John remembered how his mum had looked so proud, eyes shining when he’d met the two of them at the Hogsmeade train station.  They were staying at a small Muggle inn several miles away along with the other Muggle families who had come to see their extraordinary children graduate.
“Nngh,
“Prophets.” Mrs. Watson sucked in a breath. “I don’t know what’s going on, but I do know we’re leaving. Sherlock, I’m sure your people will take care of things, but for now, we’re getting you out of here. Put your hood up, and tie it tightly, dear.”
“Thank you, I’m sure they will.”
“I have something.” A different voice, sharper, someone posh, chimed in. “I have a potion, a hang-over remedy that might work.”
“Thank you, John.” Sherlock dropped his gaze to his tea cup.
“Good night.” Sherlock sounded as if he wanted to add more, but didn’t.
“No, no. If you don’t want to try it, that’s fine. I just thought you . . . I . . . that is we . . .” Sherlock was panicking now. Abort, abort, he tried desperately to STOP TALKING.
“You might be the only one.” Mike laughed.
“They were giving out door prizes at Madame Puddifoot’s and I won.” Victoire worked an envelope out of her pocket.
“I love you, sweetheart, my good kitty.” John dropped kisses wherever he could reach.
“Good, sir, good. I finished it last night.”
“You didn’t seem to mind at the time,” Sherlock smirked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, I’ve never used one, but I did see a vibrating cock ring in amongst the sex toys that your brother left in my bedside table drawer. I’d have to try it out before I could tell you whether or not it’s my favourite, though.”
“Oh, wow, so it is,” John said, his eyes drawn to the suggestive rose petals left over the bed. The red of the flowers over the white of the duvet was quite striking.
“Nooo.” John laughed, turning around to face him. “Not happening, sorry.”
“Shhh.”
When all had been sorted, John rang off, feeling deeply unsettled as he hurried to make it to class before he was tardy.
“Fine, fine.” Teddy grumbled good naturedly, allowing himself to be led along.
“I was on the swim team for a few years in secondary,” John admitted.
“Oh, you’re right, God. I think I left it in the kitchen.”
“Well, my arse is freezing and I need the loo.” John roused beside him. “What say we go get cleaned up, and find something for dinner?”
. . . it was exquisite.
“I am.” John stuck out his chin. “My ma told me to go play in the garden while she got set up in the kitchen.”
“Hmmm.” Mycroft shrugged. “Still, the offer stands through the week. If you change your mind, my direct mobile number is on the card.”
“Oh, God, right.” John felt like an utter tit. He moved back to grab the accursed thing where it had fallen in the grass before the booth. “Thanks.”
A burst of sweeping violin music exploded across the room. Sherlock dived for his trousers on the back of a chair and returned with his phone. “Hello?”
“Yes, that’s me, just missing the wings.” She winked before disappearing into her office.
They wipe themselves clean absent-mindedly on the duvet, and sheets beneath them.
“It wasn’t my
Truth be told Sherlock shouldn’t be this man’s equal in rank. He should be his commanding officer with the power to send him to court martial for such insubordination, not forced to stand on the street alone while his patrol partner nipped off to get pissed. Sherlock had of course been placed in the officer track at the top military academy on Cardassia. With his line of commanding forefathers, no one expected any less of him.
Sherlock walked slowly along the line, hands behind his back. He paused before each person to see if they would hold his gaze, or look away. Five of them he already knew well from his computer classes. He nodded silently to them. One girl staring at her feet trembled slightly as he passed. Sherlock made a special note to himself. He would make her fierce before she left his instruction. A boy toward the end, one with stitches along the side of his face leered at him, cocky thing. Sherlock kept his face impassive, continuing to the end of the line, acknowledging each of them in turn before returning to his spot facing them some distance away. Sherlock cleared his throat.
A gale of laughter greeted them from the backseat. “Good one, Cardassian,” she chortled.
“No worries.” Mike helped clean up a bit, and then he was off too.
John sized up their sad, half-naked group. They had little to hand, thigh-deep in water wearing nothing more than clinging, soaked pants except for Owen in his wet shirt and trousers, and Teddy in his odd part-dolphin state.
“Mmm, as do you.” Sherlock dropped a kiss to John’s forehead.  John refused to leave it just as that, and pulled Sherlock down for a proper snog that left them both quite breathless.
Mycroft held up an elegant hand to stop the tirade. “Sherlock, the villa belongs to the entire family. Perhaps I fancied a bit of a break as well? Besides, there are enough rooms here that we hardly have to see each other if we don’t wish to.”
Sherlock winced. “No, not like a spy, not exactly. I don’t want you getting into any trouble, just if you see anything, let me know.”
“Ah, you’re off for a picnic,” Sherlock said, scanning over the baskets in the boys’ hands, and the smiles over their faces. Good humor was a very rare commodity around the school the week before exams.
“Hey Hair-bear,” John called as he neared her on the chaise lounge, her cigarette glowing brightly in the dim light of a single outdoor lamp.  John slipped into the seat beside her.
John blushed. “I didn’t know, yet, okay? It was confusing, and with Dad being such a bloody wanker all the time . . .”
I can get the first weekend of October off. I’ll be in Hogsmeade to see your apparition test. I’ll send you the details as soon as I know.
, but the words stuck somewhere near his adam’s apple and refused to budge.
“ . . . you can’t judge him too harshly, you know.” Irene said. “There’s so much pressure to succeed, to do well at the workshop.” He didn’t hear John’s mumbling answer, but Irene popped back in. “He’s the youngest you know, the youngest to ever get an internship at Herr Moser’s.”
Finally, finally, their lips connected. John’s mouth, warm and sweet, moved over Sherlock’s in incredibly soft caresses. That smell, that amazing smell, now mixed with the scent of coffee and pastry wrapped over Sherlock sending his arousal spiraling upward.  John groaned, a gorgeous sound pulled deep from his chest, and Sherlock nearly exploded inside his pants. If he could have withstood the prying eyes, Sherlock felt certain he might have swept their dishes to the floor, and taken John right there on the formica table top, propriety be damned. In a way that he had never felt before, Sherlock
One afternoon as Sherlock was back in his lab, John rambled a bit at loose ends, giving the kitchen sink a proper cleaning, before ending up in the games room. He flipped through the shelf of movies, trying to find something he hadn’t watched before, eventually settling on a kids’ film.
He took his glass to the sofa. “Vid screen on.”
“In another life, perhaps I did.” Sherlock smiled wryly. The Bajorans had a belief in reincarnation, but the Cardassians stayed away from such philosophical matters.
“Oh, Sherlock. I owe you mine just the same.” John leaned forward again, and Sherlock met him happily. Their sweet kiss turned instantly heated as they gripped at each other, too overcome for softness.  It wasn’t till they heard the scrape of the door opening that they parted, springing guiltily away from each other.
“We need to find cover!” John yelled over the whine of the engine.
A large sumptuous four-poster bed took up much of the room, and stretched over the duvet was a long, lovely Oscar. He was naked but for the black stripe of his collar around his neck, that and the dark tattoos on his biceps standing out starkly against his pale skin. He was already half hard, his prick just stirring up from the light brown nest of hair between his legs.
“Fine. Get your things and get out of here. Be more careful in the future.”
“Your watch, now,”  Mycroft corrected.
“No, I know.” Rhys shifted his weight, dropping his eyes to the floor. “This just isn’t working for me anymore.”
The hotel hosting the event was a sprawling Victorian jewel, glowing from every window as they pulled up for valet parking. The serious young man who took the car for them politely called them both sir, accepting the Aston Martin with something like religious reverence.
“WHAT? You can’t buy me a whole suit!” John complained.
John tried not to eavesdrop as she leaned over the table to write something down.  He busied himself finding two tea bags to dunk into the water.
John had resisted changing the sheets. Mostly because he couldn’t be arsed to do it, but also because he couldn’t bear to lose the last of Sherlock’s lingering scent. Having the man himself back in the bed was riches beyond measure. John sighed deeply.
“Yeah well,” John jabbed a finger toward Teddy. "You know where you can . . ."
“Yeah, sure talk to you later!” John waved as he hurried on to his own class, shaking his head. It seemed like everyone had things to announce lately.
“I love Autumn, don’t you?” John took a deep breath. “Smell that? Smells like
“Oh good. Lots to do, lots to do . . .” Mrs. Holmes led them back toward the car where another bush similar to the one they’d just carried lay wedged in the back seat.
“I didn’t think you did couple vids.” Sherlock finished lamely.
They twirled about moving to the beat, and John couldn’t imagine feeling happier. He laughed out loud when Sherlock spun him into a dip.
Time? Meaningless.
“I take on some cases on my own, yes, but I also consult with the police when they are out of their depth, which is sadly, most of the time.”
“Mummy, please!” Sherlock whinged. “I think I’ve already stood for a million photos today.”
“Fine.” Teddy huffed. His hair was a lovely green that morning, and he ran his hand back through it pushing it every which way like an overgrown lawn. “This will have to do.”
John led him to an outdoor café that featured a full English breakfast minus the bacon. Sherlock nearly wept at how good the tea was. He finished a whole cup, pouring another before even looking at his plate of food.
“Alright.” Sherlock uncurled, dropping his legs to face John. “Grew up in Sussex, attended Harrow, have a boil of an older brother called Mycroft, and we’ve never owned a television, so I don’t have a favorite programme. And you?”
“I know. Still, never been on an investigation before. Haven’t been to Cardiff in an age either.”
“Okaaaay. I think I’m missing something here.” John looked around. “Is this a game?”
“Well, that’s a bang up job of decorating. Bloody great!” John grinned as he turned to face him.
The man caught Sherlock around the middle, and they bowled over to the ground in a tangle as Sherlock’s weapon flew from his hand. Sherlock’s training kicked in without any conscious thought, and he blocked the man’s savage blows, countering with his own strikes. The man was shorter than he was, but well muscled, and equally well versed in combat.
“Oh, I’m sorry, John. I didn’t mean to lose weight.” Sherlock shifted, bringing himself back level with John’s face. “It’s just that things get so busy at the potions’ workshop.  There’s always so much to do, and such wonderful things to learn.” He propped his head up over a bent arm, and shrugged a shoulder.  “Just the other day, Herr Moser showed me a new way to brew Adder’s Fork . . .” John smiled and nodded as Sherlock pontificated on the various applications of the plant.
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock tried for a return smile and botched it only slightly. He could feel the other Bajorans’ gazes boring holes into the side of head.
Skeletal sweets and blood lollies (in honor of the witching season) to my two lovely betas, otp221b, and the-navel-treatment for their fabulous help in spiffing up this chapter.
“We’re to take you to the drop-off point,” the woman said.
The Bolians entered soon after, five short, blue-colored beings in a silvery formal wear. They bowed respectfully to the audience before settling themselves in with their respective instruments. With a gong slap and a cry, they launched into their first piece. Sherlock found himself enjoying the performance more than he’d expected, losing himself in the music until intermission arrived.
John startled from a doze to find the train stopped at the next station. A pretty young woman leaned in to point to the seat beside him.
“Yeah, I don’t suppose that will work for me.” Molly smiled.
“No, I know. I’m sorry, love. It’s fine.” John reached out to take his hand, interlacing their fingers. “So, what’s on for the afternoon?”
“Not on your life!” Owen said, crushing the paper to his chest. “It’s personal, Teddy.”
“We want to believe you, Sherlock,” Shakaar said gently. “John has had nothing but praise for you.”
Something niggled at Sherlock’s memory, something important.
So we are at the end of our journey in Sussex! Many, many thanks to all who've commented and cheerleaded this fic into existence. I've appreciated you all! Kisses and hugs, we've left our lovely men at a good stopping place for the moment!
John felt the smile sliding from his face, and quickly took a drink to cover it.
“Oh come on, Donna’s not so bad. She’s not being rude to you, is she?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Johnny, my good man!”
“Well, then, erm . . .” Sherlock had no idea how to answer, though the idea of John warm and willing on their bed had him melting where he sat. “I might, er . . . have something similar for you.”
“I forgot the luggage.” Sherlock smiled shyly sitting on the edge.
John had been pleased to give the taxi driver the address for Holmes’ Apiary, but as the car made its way up the long tree-lined drive, his fears at not having dressed well-enough, not
Sherlock flushed beautifully.
They cradled each other in bed that night, weaving their limbs together, somehow not content to drift off to sleep unless they were touching as much of each other as possible.
bag.”  It took a minute, but soon enough, John’s fully-packed rucksack soared down the hall and landed at his feet. Breathe, breathe, just breathe.  John slung his bag over one shoulder, and hurried to push his way through the heavy front door, then into the dark and down the steps. It was chilly out and John thought briefly of returning for a cloak, but decided he couldn’t be arsed to go back now.  He jogged a bit down the main path, hardly daring to believe it was really true. Sherlock actually here, finally  . . . John cleared a turn, and spied a dark shape through the bars of the gate, waiting in a pool of light from the lamps.  He upped his pace to a flat out run.  The figure turned at the sound of his feet crunching on the gravel.
Sherlock wasn’t close enough to stop John leaping forward to knock the boy against a wall. He pinned him with a forearm pressed to his throat.
“No, I won’t take no for an answer. My housemates and I are throwing a big thing. We’ve even hired a band, someone called Gretchen and the Gremlins?”  She lifted a shoulder. “They’re just the bomb in Britain I hear.”
After eating, they did the washing up, making sure things were properly put away. Sherlock felt a sudden melancholy wash over him then, a nostalgia in advance for the teapot and dishes he and John had used together for so many months. It reminded Sherlock so much of saying goodbye to his grandmother’s at the end of holidays when he needed to return to school.  So strong was the impression that for a moment, Sherlock fancied he caught the scent of the lavender from her summer garden in his nose. He chided himself that it was most likely just the smell of the dish soap they were using. John seemed similarly lost in his thoughts as they made a last circuit of the place, looking for anything they’d left behind. He stopped them at the door, doubling back to snag a last bottle of wine from the kitchen before declaring it was time to head out.
“Still, the apparating. Not everyone passes on their first try, you know.” She smiled as she patted his shoulder. “I’m giving fifteen points to Gryffindor for you getting your certificate. Good job that, very good. ” She winked as she moved on.
“Molly, it’s good to see you again.” Sherlock slid into the empty chair across from her.
“I’m sorry I didn’t calculate for a shorter size. . .”
“Okay, yes, fine,” John huffed. “I could use some assistance.”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock agreed, groping for the tube on the bed.
“For the sake of their trust. It’s a gift. Of everything.”
“Yeah, no worries.” John watched the back of Sherlock’s head as he disappeared into the loo, shutting the door firmly behind him.
‘What this one, the glowing rock?’ the dragon asked, easily picking it out of the hoard of treasure with his claws.
“Sherlock, hey!”
“What’s that got to do with anything?” His mother countered, “You’ll marry as your duty to the family. What you do on the side is your business  . .  . as long as you keep it discreet.”
“Definitely time for dinner.”
No, this one was slim, elegant, posh-looking even. God, something in the way he moved though, the contrast of that mop of dark hair against pale skin, and those oddly angular features, it all added up to something utterly breathtaking. Then the vision opened his eyes. John gloried in their ocean-water colour, and shape, slanted back slightly like a cat’s until they flicked his way, and
John was all in favour of Sherlock’s new plan. If he were being honest with himself, he’d have to admit that he’d be all in favour of just about anything Sherlock suggested at this point. He was ridiculously besotted.
“My parents read to me when I was pre-literate, but I tended to enjoy scientific journals, or history books. Fiction didn’t interest me much.”
“It’s not that big of a surprise really.” John shrugged. “I mean I’ve just been waiting for us to get caught, and it’s been YEARS.”
John followed him to the lab room. He poked around the glassware, and equipment, listened to Sherlock explain what he was currently working on, and then admitted defeat. Nothing unusual jumped out from the usual. With a sigh and a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, John left him to his work.
John puffed out a breath of air and craned his neck around the room. It was test day. Sherlock had to come to class if he wanted to pass organic chemistry.
“Budgy, no!” The mother yelled at the small boy, grabbing him back when he wandered too close to the street.
“Erm, well, it’s a personal thing.”
“What are you some kinda Bajoran-lover, gone native or something?” Larex narrowed his eyes. “These aren’t people, Holmes. Not like you and me.”
Sherlock looked up, squinting into the sun to see a boy standing next to him, a Bajoran boy.
“No, thank
“John.” Sherlock ducked his head, increasing his chins thricefold. “I had to say something.”
“Good.” John nodded. “That’s quite an accomplishment.”
“John, I found a fascinating article online today about an infection that causes bees to mummify.” Sherlock sat back on his heels. “It’s generally caused by in infestation of
“Technically, it’s my bed.”
“I had an experiment that kept me later than I expected.” Sherlock eyed John warily as he scooted as far back on the mattress as he could go without tumbling off.
. If he’d gone after me, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything either.”
“Yeah, see you Monday, Sarah,” John said, raising a hand in farewell before hurrying after.
Bianca glowed at his praise. “I will come visit, and make it for you. It will be good to have someone to stay with when I want to see London again.”
“I hope so too. I hate seeing the little ones begging. I always give them anything in my pockets.” Molly bit at her lip.
“God, Sherlock, missed you, baby, please don’t, ever again . . .”
Damn. He should have trusted his instincts and gotten out the night before. Sherlock spared just a moment to curse his hubris before his brain slotted into gear, and he sat up. He’d locked the door with the internal chain the night before, but that wouldn’t keep out several determined men.
“I did. It obviously wasn’t in the cards. Thank goodness, it turned out to be John though. Anyone else would have been horrifying.”  Sherlock mock shuddered.
Sherlock fetched another round of drinks and led John to some chairs to watch. John wasn’t sure what was in his glass, but Sherlock had thrust it into his hand unceremoniously so he tried it. It tasted tropical.
