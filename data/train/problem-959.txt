In my new flat, there was a table full of my favourite dishes. Glamorgan sausages, Welsh cakes, even a pot of cawl with lamb, potatoes, leeks, carrots and swedes, just like how my mother used to make them. I opened the fridge to find it stocked full of prepped meals, a lot of beer, and a few bars of chocolate that I let myself indulge in once in a blue moon.
“Good… that’s... good. Just wanted to be sure.” Greg cleared his throat and took a deep breath. “I want to be with you Mycroft, but I hope you understand we can’t cross a certain line until I’m officially divorced.”
“Yeah, I know. Thank you…” The look in Greg’s eyes told Mycroft how much this man wanted to touch him, to kiss him and to hold him in bed. “I’ll see you in the morning. I want banana pancakes.”
Two down, two more to go! Wish me luck! If I don't write anymore tonight, if this is my last chapter for the year, wishing you all a fantastic 2019 with more great fics ahead!
He has gotten into a lot of trouble with the A&E too. Refusing treatment is at the top of the list. Why am I not surprised anymore...
Sherlock grinned to himself, absolutely pleased with his handiwork while she stormed down the stairs. He paced around the living room and paused at where he was standing earlier when he shot the wall, recalling his favourite bits from earlier, enjoying the afterglow of sex. As he was about to turn and head back to the kitchen, an explosion went off from the building across his. The windows shattered and the blast pushed him forward onto the floor.
“JOHN!” Sherlock yelled as he kicked down the door, grabbing the bottle away from John’s hands and threw it away from them. “He had a few mouthfuls down. Call the ambulance now!” He yelled towards Lestrade.
“That was the plan, innit? One explosion to rid of all...” James snapped his mouth shut when his mother pulled a blade from her pocket. It was the one she used to cut off tongues… He knew it was a threat, and a serious one by the look in her eyes. Using Jeremiah’s son, her only grandson, was a risky move. He always had conflicting strategies with the family, and wanted to take over the empire for good by eliminating… well, his family. She was really annoyed this time. Everyone knew he was the favored son, but when push comes to shove, he also knew his mother had no more mercy for either of them than anyone else.
We intercepted a package delivered to New Scotland Yard, addressed to Sherlock. When the phone was x-rayed, we had received intelligence from our correspondence that it was the same phone from Sherlock’s first publically ‘blogged’ case. Our guy on the inside had to repackage the phone, but who the fuck uses an iridium nibbed Parker Duofold fountain pen? And who the fuck knows these things?
In the beginning, he could only let Sherlock go as far as holding his upper body in their sleep. He wouldn’t let Sherlock touch his chest or anywhere from his waist down. He was also wary of Sherlock’s untimely erections. The first time they had snogged in bed and Sherlock’s erection accidentally brushed against his knee, he went blind with rage and had a panic attack.
“Do tell. Ah wait, don’t. Let me deduce it. His wife found out, came to you to put in a good word with me.”
“He? I didn’t mention his gender…” John paused and I knew he had figured it out. “And you don’t work for Holmes? Seemed suspicious, you know, a cab always showing up just as we walk out the door. And cabs always just around the same corner too.”
Sherlock shuffled his feet as if he was a six year old getting caught stealing candies. Mrs Hudson was pissed beyond belief. She puts up with a lot of things, but blowing a hole through their floor and into her ceiling is next level. She pointed at the hole in the middle of their living room where the carpet was rolled aside.
Two chapters this week! This extra chapter is specially dedicated to JunkenMetel. Thank you for being such an amazing reader, and this chapter should give you some answers from earlier comments! xx
A few moments later, Kate and Layla were tugging each other’s hair, rolling all over the carpet. When Layla tried to free herself from Kate’s grip, she stumbled over the coffee table and hit her head on the edge.
“If that was your way of saying I’m an obnoxious narcissist, you are probably right. But I am willing to share some of that with you, John Watson.” Sherlock finished the story nonchalantly, trying to avoid John’s eyes but failing miserably.
As Mycroft finished his sentence, a knock on the door turned both their heads. Anthea had opened the door slightly to remind Mycroft of his next appointment. John got the hint and excused himself to leave.
“Hands and knees.” John ordered, and Sherlock obeyed, climbing up on the turned down bed, his elbows and knees supporting his weight.
“All of them were stabbed in the heart, and it is always a clean stab. No torture or disfigurement. And the blood on the wound is always smudged, as if someone held themselves close enough to push the blade through with their own body, to feel the victim’s life seep out of them, their last breath, last heartbeat… we are definitely dealing with a psychopath serial killer here. One that knows how to cover their tracks.”
That was when I realized that the child was the double’s. Brother. He was James Moriarty’s brother. They were very likely twins. And using your own nephew as a chess piece, he must have knew they were here, and yet he walked straight into this…
“Sorry, I made a mess… SORRY!” He yelled while running out of Tesco, headed back to 221B, as fast as his legs can take him.
Sherlock held John’s hand, not letting go. John was unconsciously holding Sherlock’s hand too, and had no intentions of letting go. The detective read John’s expression and knew what he was thinking.
Mycroft only shook his head. Everyone in that room knew Mycroft had something to do with it. John looked as if he couldn’t care less. Ever since his rescue, he had heard his story repeated six times, down to the nasty details - every abuse, every cock he swallowed, every orgasm he had while they fucked him raw... and how much they said he liked it.
John reached down and cupped Sherlock’s cock, gently rubbing it above his pants. As Sherlock got louder, he used his other hand and pulled Sherlock head down, muffling his moans.
“Like I said, we can’t just point a finger without evidence.” He paused for a moment contemplating if he should get Sherlock involved. “You know what? Tell Mrs Anderson to drop by Baker Street later today. We don’t have a case for now and Sherlock has been climbing up the walls all day. This should keep him occupied for awhile.”
“Take him home, brother mine. We’ll sort this out.” Mycroft said as he looked down at his brother, struggling to keep the doctor still. His cries could be heard from outside the tunnel, and Sherlock nodded.
“I was walking down the street to catch the bus home and I heard… heard her scream. It was a short yelp, but I heard… I saw… saw someone running away. I was afraid. So scared…”
Q’s team barely made it out before DI Dimmock and his team flooded the building. They obviously would find nothing. Q made sure of it.
“Because you possess a talent only few in the world has. I am one of them, but I’m sure you know what I mean. Running around the uncharted valley without getting lost.”
The last thing Greg needed was to go through the interrogation process. He was preparing the recording equipment in the observation room of the interview room when the door to the other room opened. John was walking backwards into the room with Sherlock pushing him in.
"What is it?" Greg still had no idea what they noticed. He was sat too far away from the files to read the date.
“Good. Perfect. Don’t stop. Please, please. Captain, please. Don’t stop.” Sherlock babbled, drool leaking from the corner of his lips where his head was facing on the side.
It was unlike M to send us messages that aren’t instructions. Perhaps it was a message for himself as well… Actually, it was an instruction, to brace ourselves for the end game. And it became clear to me that it was when we heard the call of two pips.
Sherlock thought to himself while fishing for his mobile. He flopped onto the hotel bed and sent John a text while mumbling to himself about how boring this trip was.
It was a little after midnight when John decide he’s had enough of little nibbles. Time for the main course.
“I’m not good at this, emotion thing,” Sherlock whispered into John’s shoulder, “but I want you to stay… as my partner. You’re all I have John.”
“Mother. Why isn’t there breakfast?” Sherlock asked when he sat down at the table the following morning while John walked to the counter to make coffee.
“For fucks sake! You didn’t even lock the door?” Greg whispered sternly. John looked really embarrassed, but Sherlock on the other hand, looked smug as hell.
“Yes I do have casual clothes despite what you see in my closet. Mother is very particular about… in her words, not mine,
“You are a fucking moron!” John yelled and threw himself against the bedroom door, dropped to the floor and hugged his own knees, fuming silently.
And on her 31st birthday, she received her first present (victim) from Moriarty. He would send her a card with a name on it, and they were not easy targets. Years of practice made Sally a sharp predator. The thrill of danger only fuelled her adrenaline more, and it made Sally a dangerous killer.
The rest of the day went on as if nothing had happened. Sherlock continued his mould experiment while John made tea, tapping away letter by letter updating their blog with their latest case on the child murderer. But occasionally, John would glance over to Sherlock and make a lewd gesture with his tongue.
At the age of twelve, her father had brought her and her older brother, Marcus, to their first hunting season. They were each given a swiss army knife and a small survival kit just in case they got lost in the woods. After months of training, Mr Donovan was comfortable enough to let the kids run after their German Shepherd, hunting small preys. That was Sally’s first taste of the hunt. The thrill of the hunt and kill excited her, but pigeons and deers were eventually not enough.
John dropped the basket, eggs, milk and jars of jam shattered on the aisle. He ran out through the manned counters and dropped some cash on the counter.
“Stop it. It’s Greg. None of that title business again. I meant it, Mycroft. I really like you. Too much to be in the same house with you for the long term without my feelings returned.” He slowly moved his hands away and kept it on his own lap.
“Kinda. His accent’s slightly off, and George wiped the bar after serving every pint. This one doesn’t. Routines can be learned but habits takes a lot more effort.”
Walking into my home felt awkward that day. The air smelled different. I knew there was someone new in the house, and I did not like that. I was standing behind the sofa where this stranger was sitting in, my parents on the two-seater on the left. There was only the single seat left.
I snapped at myself. There was already enough going on. The last thing we need is a distracted agent, thrown off by another agent...
“I promise you, next date won’t be like this.” Sherlock said with his lips pressed to John’s forehead.
As Sherlock comes closer to the real identity of the July 15th killer, he found himself caught between his wants and needs.
Molly simply nodded and looked out the window. Sherlock could see her tears from the reflection and decided it was best to keep his mouth shut for the rest of the journey.
“As much as it hurts, he needs Sherlock. You can’t deny your brother his biggest chance at survival.”
“Oh, but there has been a puzzle you’ve been trying to solve, isn’t there? I know who the July 15th killer is. Join me, and I’ll give you puzzles bigger than the ones you’ve ever cracked. Better yet, you get to plan puzzles and see them unfold! I’ve always found that part of the job a little… dull.”
“I remember going home that night and had a bottle of wine. Liquid courage… I wanted to lay it all out with Philip that night. But before he came home, I remembered something about that lingerie… the look on Layla’s face when I showed it to her. She looked… surprised? Or guilty even. I thought maybe I should flip through his stuff, maybe I’ll find something… and I did. Her… her ID from the hospital was in his backpack!”
The next evening, they had dinner in Greg’s favourite restaurant… or bar. From afar, they just looked like mates hanging out at their local, sharing a pizza and some chips over a few drinks. But if someone had listened in to their conversation, they may find it a little odd.
John seemed to be in his own thoughts when Sherlock spoke. He blinked a few times, hard, and almost rubbed his face with his rubber gloves still on. “Shit,” he exclaimed when the stained gloves were centimeters from his face, “it’s just, you look… ethereal. With the window, snow, Christmas tree and all that.”
Two hours after sending John to the Yard, they found Soo Lin’s apartment and Sherlock got ambushed. I was sure they would find the shop, both armed with Van Coon and the journalist’s schedules, but
Once a year, Sally would take one kill. It was always swift - stab to the heart and let her victim bleed out. At twenty, she joined the force and learned different ways to avoid getting caught. Randomisation is the key. Never let someone piece the puzzles together. She could change her persona to fit almost any environment and she was highly intelligent with a great deal of planning going into her attacks. Her lack of empathy and lack of true feelings for others made her seem spiteful and mean, but she was charming enough for everyone to disregard her occasional outburst.
The investigation begins. Sherlock, John and Greg finds out they were dealing with one serial killer, a very smart one too.
“It was in the files. I have to incorporate slangs in order for Lestrade here to comprehend my train of thoughts better, dear Watson.” Sherlock explained as he bundled up the files in his hand and labeled them with a post-it note as ‘Gang’.
Kate was on the opposite side of the interrogation room. She couldn’t bear to look into Sally’s eyes.
When Sherlock pulled John out the door, walking past Greg, he grinned slyly and stopped. “Revenge is sweet, Gregory.” He said and moved away, tugging John along.
There was a brief second where I felt someone watching. Letting go of Aurelia’s hand, I handed her the takeaway along with a stern look.
They sat quietly at the back of the cab, Sherlock obviously processing the information about the painted cipher left behind by someone. Sherlock knew it was meant for Edward Van Coon, and there wasn’t many Van Coons in the phone book. Within seconds he found the address of Edward Van Coon on and online directory, and they were headed towards his home.
“Don’t I have to sign thousands of pages of paperwork to hear this? What’s this about?” Greg was starting to get concerned. The car was still stationary, parked where it picked them up after Samuel’s funeral, waiting for Mycroft to signal it to move. When he finally pushed the button, he hung his head low and stared down at his own feet.
That only spurred Sherlock on. He leaned down against John’s back and pulled out almost all the way, and thrust back into John, hard. It shook the bed. John was moaning his name in bits and pieces, eyes screwed shut and his hips pushing back with Sherlock’s every thrust forward, meeting him in the middle.
Sally stood from the floor and walked out onto the front porch facing a lake. The moon shone brightly, reflecting the hills on the lake’s surface. She took a deep breath and stared out into the open for a couple of minutes before stripping the plastic sheets wrapped around her body and stuffed them into a sack. Walking back towards her car by the lake, she swung the sack hard, flung it into the deep end of the lake. The splash made her lips twitch into a smile that kept until she arrive back in her flat in London.
Molly invited Greg, Mycroft, John and Sherlock over for an early Christmas dinner, and she has a surprise announcement!
Sherlock wasn’t going to be home for another four hours. How was he going to kill four hours? John picked up his phone and called Aaron.
“Hmm… I’d like to think I control the world, but not just yet. Perhaps someday.” He opened his pocket watch and started to move towards the door.
I also want to thank one of my co-author in another series, TheLadyOfMusic, for checking up on me. You have always initiated conversations with me, and I thank you. I'm sorry, and I really appreciate you, H.
“Nothing specific. But you can tell them what you think of this offer, if it is legit, just to give them peace of mind. I believe you’ll be able to decide that for yourself after tonight.”
Sally let out a short sob before she continued, raising her head slightly and looked at the detective’s eyes through her lashes.
“Well, well, well. Look who’s here? M’s top dogs! Here to catch me?” He said really arrogantly. I was so tempted to pounce and take him down there and then, but we have a bigger fish to fry.
“About damned time!” Greg shouted when he walked in and saw John in Sherlock’s arms. “Pay up bitches!” He shouted with glee as he spun out into the hallway where most of the officers were.
John thought to himself. In that moment he seemed to have found courage that he hadn’t possess in the past year and decided to press on. He took another step while taking off the rubber gloves, throwing them on the floor without giving it another look where it landed.
I've hit a writer's block. Took me 3 days to write this short piece of shit. But I'm really happy with it. I think I'm a genius to write smut and Her Majesty in the same chapter without involving her at all.
Sherlock managed to solve the case of Mister Monkford relocating to Colombia in time. Our team was already on standby to disarm the lad, and he too was shipped off to join Q’s sister in Q-Branch.
As confused as John was, he was happy that his chair and flat was now free of one Mycroft Holmes, and he could return to his own chair instead of the uncomfortable arm on Sherlock’s.
She begged. She knew he was about to kill her. Pleading would not work. Bryn had to make himself known now. And he stood out into the light, but Zhi Zhu still had his back towards him. He was still too far away from them to move in.
“It was getting really boring--” Mister Kaplan clocked him in the back of his head before he could finish his sentence.
“Really, John? Even the blind could see this,” Sherlock pointed at his chest where Rudolph’s red nose stuck out in a ball of knitted wool, “from space.”
The LED lights on the vest started to blink faster, and there was an audible beep heard. That was the plan all along. Moriarty wanted everyone here, including his own brother, and get rid of all of us once and for all.
He ground his cock down hard one last time against Sherlock’s straining trousers, and moved to the feet of the bed, taking his own trousers off before removing Sherlock’s. Both their cocks were straining, twitching, begging to be touch. It was apparent that John had more self control, because Sherlock was a babbling mess. His curls damp with sweat, face and chest flushed, splotches of bruises sporting in different places, some red, some purple.
I'm slowly phasing out Bryn's POV. It's getting more and more complicated as the chapters go, so I've decided to play god. Bryn's POV will phase out in Chapter 12, just a heads up!
if I had… I would’ve came back for you immediately. I would have… gave up chasing Moriarty’s network. As long as you’re safe and alive… but you’re barely yourself anymore John, and this is all my fault. Please, John. Please wake up for me. Let me make things right for you… John.
John sat on the arm of Sherlock’s chair and wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulder, “scared the shit out of me, love.”
Ever since Layla’s murder, Sherlock was constantly bothered by something he couldn’t quite put his finger on. John felt something was wrong too.
As much as I was tempted to, I’ve learned the hard way not to preempt any of Mister Holmes’ guests from twenty long years ago.
For jimins_future_wife. I'm a 22 words short of 3k, but here you go, as requested, 3000 words of bottom!lock. xxxx
“Jesus, Holmes.” John sighed. “And you ended up in a scuffle? How did you get yourself bruised up like this punching someone? Look,” John dabbed the cuts on his hands with antiseptic solution and Sherlock hissed, “there are cuts.”
John stood in the way of Sherlock and held him still. He grabbed Sherlock’s arms and gave it a little shake. “Talk to me love. What’s wrong?”
I was recruited at 17, and that was 20 years ago. I had always been an exemplary student. Straight As, captain of the rugby team, dated both cheerleaders and captain of the ladies football team. The day I finished my A-levels, there was a black Mercedes sedan in front of my home.
In the ten minutes journey, he had managed to plan all the way ahead to have agents standby at the Black Lotus’ hideout. It wasn’t difficult to figure out their cipher, but he wanted to make sure Shan was there before he made a move.
“Where’s the grocery, John? Did you break all the eggs and milk?” Sherlock asked to distract himself.
“When have I gave you the idea that your feelings weren’t returned? Why would I have invited you to my home in the first place?”
Anthea dropped the takeaway next to Q and sternly mouthed “eat”, then paced up towards an empty terminal and started furiously typing, triangulating a location for the team. If Q had been here since we first intercepted the package, he must have been working for more than eighteen hours now.
I've been getting a little off-track. Don't worry, Chapter 13 onward we will be back to Q-Branch + more Bryn action!
Sherlock was still leaking, his orgasm still riding high, but a shiver went down his spine, and he knew he’s had enough. “John. Captain.” He whispered, but his voice broke.
“Oh, no you don’t. We’re not gonna let our first time be motivated by your brother’s voyeuristic tendencies.”
We couldn’t let it show. Anxiety, relief. Absolutely not, lest we give away the fact that Samuel was alive and sort-of-well. He was still in hiding during the funeral, and weeks after, until Mister Holmes decided it was time to put him out of his misery a little earlier than expected...
Year after year, the July 15th killer took one life, and left clues for Sherlock. He would follow the trail and hit a dead end after months. Sherlock never realised they were evidence planted to throw him off, until the death of a significant person on July 15th this year.
Greg and Mycroft raced towards John’s room. The door was slightly ajar. As they approached, Greg heard Sherlock’s confession and quickly held Mycroft back.
I am never a second priority in any security situation, and I have extended that privilege to Sherlock, to an extent Doctor Watson, and most importantly you, my dear. But in light of recent events, I have, figuratively, merged you and I into one entity. Anything that they would do for me, they would do for you.
The detective’s cock was slowly filling up. In fact, it had been half hard most of the day, except for the moments he dropped test tubes. Cleaning was not a turn on at all, whether John was staring at his arse or not.
“Oh god, Sherlock!” John pulled Sherlock into his arms and cried. They stayed there in each other’s arms for a good ten minutes before Sherlock pulled away slightly, held his forehead against John’s.
“Wrote this song for you when I was in Russia. I missed you so much, couldn’t concentrate on my plans. Had to write down my feelings somewhere.”
“John, before we… no, before you think anything stupid, I want you. I love you. More than anything.” Sherlock held both John’s hand and led him towards his chair and sat John down. He knelt on one knee between John’s knees, “John Hamish Watson…”
“I’m going to make you see stars tonight, even if you have no idea what they are.” John said huskily, voice hoarse from hours of disuse.
While Sherlock was frantically looking for clues, John woke up, tied to a chair, interrogated by a Chinese lady who thought that he was Sherlock.
“Is Sherlock alright?” Greg was now worried. It wasn’t very often that Mycroft lashes out physically towards inanimate objects. In fact, it had only happened twice since Greg had moved in.
“I only have a few more minutes before I have to go.” He handed me a file. “Here’s your test. There is a satellite phone in there, connected to my operators. They will be calling you tonight at eight. In between now and then, study everything in that file carefully. Understood?”
How I portray Mycroft Holmes in my writing actually is a reflection of myself IRL. People think I'm fine, but I'm not. I still work, I still excel, I still smile, but deep down inside all I need is a cuddle and someone to tell me that I should stay.
“Here are your instructions. Godspeed.” Anthea said while dropping two identical folders in front of us, and a Jaguar’s car key in front of me. She winked, then turned around and followed M out of the room.
Sherlock was quiet while Mycroft spoke on the other side of the phone. With nothing to do but wait, John quickly went into the bedroom and brought clothes out for Sherlock. He was still standing there, stunned, when John came out. He swiftly pulled Sherlock’s ribbon-wrapped pants down and tapped his knees for them to lift.
“God! Sherlock! So fucking beautiful!” John gasped, trailing kisses down the back of Sherlock’s knee, thighs and his arse.
“Hmm,” Sherlock hummed happily as he leaned down to kiss John, mumbling against John’s lips, “that you can do, honey.”
“Mother.” He hissed. “I see that your life is still intact.” When he tried to struggle out of his bonds, he felt another pair of hands on his shoulder. He knew who it was without looking. He could recognize his own twin brother just from the way he breathed.
Greg felt warmth spreading inside him. Mycroft was looking straight into his eyes, a shy smile on his face. He shook his head in response to Mycroft’s question.
The aftermath of "sofa sex". Bryn and the team caught an eyeful of John's behind... and Bryn's only interested in Anthea's.
“Because you didn’t, you git. I dressed you. Thought there was a case. But doesn’t matter because now I can unwrap my gift all over again.”
Slowly, Sherlock pushed in little by little until he was fully seated. John felt like he was going to explode. It was a little uncomfortable, but when Sherlock gave it a slight thrust, he saw stars in his eyes. John wasn’t aware that he was drooling onto the pillow, gasping, whining and moaning loudly.
Admitting that he needed advice was difficult. John wondered what had happened to Sherlock when he was younger to be so insecure about his inadequacies in certain areas.
“It’s Latin, loosely translated to The Controller of World Governments. That’s who I really am. Sherlock refers to me as
“Bored.” Sherlock said to Billy the skull. “Do you know if John would be home soon? Of course you don’t.” With a huff, he went into his bedroom and changed into something more comfortable, then flopped on his bed, face buried in the pillow John slept in. He missed John, deeply. The urge of cuddling up to his doctor was so strong, he needed something stave it off while John was out.
“Of course.” The consulting detective picked up his coat and turned to face John, “I’d be lost without my blogger.”
“The other one reports to this one.” Mycroft glanced over to his assistant and saw her texting said ‘other birdie’.
“Well, I guess we’ll need supplies to clean up after this. Wait here for the contractor and I’ll get some shopping done, alright?”
“Mycroft?” Greg called out when he heard a door slam upstairs. The rattle that he heard after the slam indicated that it was Mycroft’s office door. It has a fancy knocker that had came loose four months ago and rattles when he closes the door a little too hard.
Sally held on to Kate’s neck tightly and dragged her to the kitchen where it was dark. She flipped Kate over and pinned her down on the floor, cutting off her airway, just enough to knock her out. Once Kate stopped struggling, she went over to Layla and swiftly stabbed her with a six inch knife from the kitchen.
“Sherlock?” He elbowed Sherlock gently, but there was no response. “Sherlock, look.” John nudged Sherlock a little harder this time.
“I suppose there’s no use me trying to persuade you I was doing an impression.” John said sarcastically at first, but jerked back a little when there was a gun pointed to his head. It had been awhile since he was in a situation like this. The last time it happened, he was rescued. But just as they were leaving the enemy’s area, they were ambushed and he was shot. The feeling of despair, and hope, and despair again was nasty. Not one that John wanted to experience again.
When he got back to 221B, he was surprised to find a letter under the door. It wasn’t mail day. The letter was addressed to him, written in the beautiful script he recognised as Sherlock’s.
“With Layla, we have proven that it was impossible that Kate had stabbed her. Her medical showed that she was choked hard enough to blackout. If she was telling the truth, she wouldn’t be the first to encounter the same killer. Always at night, chokes the witness face down and tries to frame them for the murder.”
I actually paused at the scenes where Sherlock thinks of the shortest route, where the London map comes up on screen, and wrote based on that. So if I got something really really wrong, please let me know, otherwise just imagine those routes exists!
Q cleared his throat, seemingly annoyed by the interruption. “If you had allowed me to finish my briefing before you opened your gap, the answer should be somewhere in there.”
“Apology accepted, and I forgive you.” John held Sherlock’s face and leaned down, kissing the detective, wiping tears away from his cheeks, then leaned really close to his ear, whispering “shall we plan your revenge then?”
“I thought I did. I was still processing the emotions around it. I just dumped that piece of information into a storage room and put a red tape on top of it. I didn’t get a chance to put a note on top. This morning when I was doing some
“Harry, come on. Let’s go home.” Silently, Harry gave Sherlock an approving nod and held Molly’s hand while they leave John’s room. Sherlock went towards the only seat next to the bed and slumped into it, gently holding John’s hand.
“Oh, John. My dear John, what have they done to you? Let me help John, please...” Sherlock sat next to John on the bed and held John against his chest. The detective felt tears on his own cheeks, but they were tears of anger, and his fists balled up so tight his knuckles had turned white, fingernails bit into his palm. “Just say the word John, and I’ll rid the world of those fucking pests.”
“What is it? You’re aware that the case is closed right? Is this about Anderson? Listen, I know Sherlock isn’t Anderson’s best friend but there just wasn’t enough evidence for the murder. It was all circumstantial--”
Sherlock never left London, not even for one minute in the past eight months but he never went home to John and Rayna.
They both sat there across each other, silently sniping at each other. It went to the point where they started kicking each other under the table. That was when Mrs. Holmes stood up and grabbed the nearest newspaper, rolled it up and smacked the kitchen counter really hard. That
“Always on July fifteenth. It is a significant day. None of the victims are related in any way. Always a bottle of wine somewhere, opened.”
It was almost midnight when they got to the takeout restaurant. Sherlock knew the owners and got them out of an immigration fine for hiring illegal workers. After they had gotten their food, the owner made himself scarce.
Black Lotus was one of the smuggling arms of antiques under Moriarty’s network. Years ago, Operation Flower was leaked and almost killed Mycroft. Mycroft’s kneecap was shattered by a high caliber gun, and his right hand man was killed in that operation. I remember the moment we got a call about an extraction operation like it was yesterday. Over the years we had grown fond of Mister Holmes. Even though we call him the Iceman, we knew deep down inside he cared.
John took a minute standing back to admire the view before him. Sherlock, bent over on their bed, arse stuck up high with his back arched, making small movements trying to grind himself against the trousers. He raised one hand high, and swung it down on Sherlock’s right arse cheek, “stop that.”
“I want to reiterate that I am very, very against this monstrosity that you call a sweater.” Sherlock grumbled waving the sweater in John’s face. “But… your thoughtfulness is much appreciated.” He said while putting on the sweater, hoping that it would cover his face long enough to let the blush dissipate.
“Boring? Who. Gives. A. Fuck?!” She yelled in his face. “Your father and I didn’t build this all for fun, did we? And have you thrown everything we stand for out the window? Killing innocent people now, hmm? Wasn’t that the first thing we told you NOT TO DO?”
Sherlock started a racket and Shan was running away. John wasn’t sure what was happening until Sherlock appeared behind him and started untying the rope binding his wrists. And for a short moment, John thought the whole ordeal was over, until one of Shan’s men came behind him and pulled Sherlock away by his neck. They were struggling for only a moment, then multiple footsteps echoed through the tunnel.
“That’s enough Sally. Let the doctor leave.” Greg paced up towards them and signalled for John to leave. John nodded, glad that the conversation was over.
John realised what that meant. That day had came and went when Sherlock decided to join Moriarty… John whispered to himself in tears, realising what his husband had become.
Then we were just watching pieces unfold. The real Moriarty is on his way to be dealt with, and the double seemed to be trained extremely well. The double and Sherlock had a little squabble, picked up a phone call furiously, and left from the back door, distracted.
John was shaking, crying, screaming and thrashing about. Sherlock knew coming this close to getting shot at must have triggered his PTSD. Even with John’s fists flying close to his face, he held John, rocking back and forth trying to calm the man down.
“He’s done it. Your idiot of a brother has really done it.” Q said in a really high pitch after refreshing the same website for the last two hours.
“I can’t possibly be away from the office for any length of time. Not with the Korean elections so…”
Taking John back to the flat was difficult. He had to carry John bridal style out of the tunnel and walk past Dimmock. The DI had received instructions from above to keep them out of their reports, and Dimmock was more than happy to be the hero. As Sherlock walked by, he said quietly, “I’ll go where you point me.”
“And?” John asked after a minute of silence. They were both now sat on their respective chairs, the hole on the floor in between them.
They were halfway through the movie when Sherlock started complaining. “That is just… ugh! Why are you making me sit through this, John? It makes no sense!” Sherlock had been pointing out plot holes and technical flaws of the movie since the beginning.
While John was busy getting kidnapped and strapped on with explosives, Sherlock was busy writing his opening speech in his mind palace. He knew he was finally going to meet this Moriarty character, his new found nemesis, and the excitement completely drowned him out of thoughts about John. He should’ve been concerned when John didn’t return after two hours…
It read, “Driscoll, I had no doubt you would accept this task. You were one of my best operatives. Rules to follow on this task are listed below. Call the number when you encounter special circumstances. You are anonymous.”
Apparently he was high in America when he solved one of DEA’s biggest case. Some big time drug dealer… ah, Hudson. His landlady’s husband. That explains how he lives almost rent-free in the middle of London without an income. But again, if your brother runs-- IS the British Government, you wouldn’t need to worry about money.
“Hang on Mrs H.” John whispered, then spoke a little louder, “he’s asked me to buy six litres of chlorine and I can’t lift them up all on my own. Shoulder’s acting up again…”
At the sound of Sherlock’s voice, John let out a breath he didn’t realise he was holding in. At the same time he was worried about what he had declared earlier… but no time for that now. He needed to stay sharp when shit hits the fan, and he was absolutely sure it would.
Pulling his index finger out, Sherlock poured more lube and covered his index and middle finger. He gently probed John with his middle finger. When it was all the way in, he wriggled it around again, spreading lube inside and looking for John’s prostate. Sherlock pulled and pushed his fingers a few times with a slight hook, and when John screamed, he knew he had found the spot.
In the other room, Greg knew there was nothing he could do when he saw Sherlock cuff himself back on the table. This time, John did lock the door. All he could do was to switch everything off and leave.
Mr Donovan turned off the telly as the news report ended but Sally continued to stare at the blank screen, reminiscing her first kill.
Down the street, John and Bryn were waiting for their burgers when Bryn’s phone vibrated with a special text alert.
“This wasn’t your fault. But you can make things better,” Molly held Harry in her arms and swayed gently, “Please, let Sherlock see John. They need each other.”
While Sherlock was thinking of that, John came back into the room and laid on top of Sherlock, kissing the man chastely, and announced that he needs to leave soon.
“It was a natural reaction, doesn’t mean I want to. I will still love you as much as I do now, even if we never do
Hello everyone. Life has been tough since I stopped writing for almost a whole year now. In the beginning it was because I was busy preparing for a new life. But in the past few months my passion for life seems to have sunk to a new low. My love for this fandom has not wavered. I was so excited to start a new life in a new country, a job I could have loved, and be with someone I could have spent the rest of my life with. But now I will never know because it has been all stripped away from me during this pandemic due to travel restrictions. It was an "act of god", but I still can be disappointed and depressed.
“Ah, of course, my apologies Molly. Know that John and I are available to assist you during this time of bereavement, but of course it would be subjected to our schedule.” Sherlock declared the last sentence with sharp enunciation, as if he had memorize a script.
Soo Lin was hidden in the safehouse accessible through an underground tunnel into the museum. It was built many years ago when Soo Lin first came into the country. Unfortunately the intel she had was slightly outdated, which caused the failed mission that got J captured, or if he was fortunate, killed.
“I had merely given you an option to live here. There was no reason to be cruel, Detective Inspector.” Mycroft said with a bite, pulling his hand away roughly, throwing Greg’s hand away.
Short chapter - wrote a really long one yesterday! And was so busy with my Christmas party, I have no time!!!
“Finally.” Sherlock huffed with an eye roll directed towards the officers. He willingly allow John to pull him out and away from the crime scene, into a cab...
“Sherlock. Open up.” He waited a little while, and when there was no response, he knocked a little harder, shaking the handle. “I’m breaking down the door if you don’t open up in the next one minute.”
“No, I need you to go to the police station, ask about the journalist. His personal effects would’ve been impounded. Get hold of his diary or something that will tell us his movements.”
It was no secret that she is. Capable, smart, aggressive when she needs to be. All the best qualities M should have. The cherry on top is the fact that she is a woman. In this world of ours, dominated by men, a female leader would be advantageous, taking enemies off their guard.
John opened the cupboard and pulled out two sweaters. “Which one should I wear?” He asked Sherlock. The detective whipped his head around, staring at John’s ugly sweaters while tucking in the last corner of the sheets.
But deep down, Sherlock had already decided that the answer was only sweater, specifically to ugly horrendous-looking sweaters.
“Because I had a row with the chip and pin machine.” John was agitated after his scuffle with the self-checkout counter, but he still noticed Sherlock’s hand holding the book. His knuckles were bruised.
When Anderson first fell off the grid, she was angry, and was very close to breaking her pattern - killing someone outside of her birthday. The blade was only millimetres away from the victim’s chest when she heard someone whispering behind her.
“Next are these ones. They are unrelated murders, but all of them most likely perpetrated by their spouse or lover. You will need to find evidence to convict, as much as I need them to be sure. But that is your job. I’ve pointed you in the right direction.”
Sherlock knew it was contaminated, but he needed a sample of John’s semen when it was ejaculated along with prostate stimulation… “Tomorrow? Why not tonight John?” He asked in late realisation after John had entered the shower.
John’s nightmare was frightening. He was in captivity, skinned alive, tortured, branded with hot iron, physically and sexually abused. John was screaming when Sherlock tried to wake him up. In his nightmare, Erik had pinned him down and let the others rape him in turn. In reality, Sherlock was shaking his shoulders trying to wake him up. John’s eyes snapped open and flipped Sherlock down against his bed. His instincts was to kill. He choked Sherlock so hard it almost snapped his throat. One of Mycroft’s men had to knock John out to save Sherlock. When John came to, Sherlock was right there next to him, playing a song he had never heard before.
“You are not hallucinating John. Look. At. Me.” Sherlock held John’s hand and emphasised the last three words sternly. “John, I am here, I wasn’t dead. You almost killed me earlier though, good to see you’ve got some strength back.”
John nodded excitedly. There were tears rolling off his cheeks when Sherlock pulled out a velvet box with a ring inside.
“It’s only fair. If you wish to not be involved, I completely understand as well. But know this, Gregory, I will do everything in my power to keep you safe, even if it costs me my own life.”
John pinched the nipples between his fingers, and rolled them slowly, variating pressure to make Sherlock moan and keen. It was delicious, the way Sherlock reacted to the things John was doing to those nubs. It was getting difficult to stay in his trousers listening to Sherlock. The thought of the younger man all meek for him made him want to come just like that.
Leaving Bewick out to be hung, literally, Sherlock left the prison and hopped on the first train to Paris. There was a weather condition en route, halting all train services and it was another day before there was a train to London.
And then it was midnight. Sherlock showed up at the pool. It was quiet. He held up the memory stick and recited the little speech he prepared earlier, “Brought you a little getting-to-know-you present. Oh, that’s what it’s all been for, hasn’t it? All your little puzzles, making me dance... all to distract me from this.”
While John was away at the clinic the next morning, Sherlock kept cataloguing the books, but he was getting nowhere. Most days when he’s stuck, he would stop and think of another way in. Today was not Bryn and Q’s lucky day, because Sherlock was one step closer to figuring it out.
“Maybe some lube, condoms? Anything that fancies you, your highness?” John asked sarcastically, just to see if Sherlock was serious about the milk.
Towards the end of the third year, John had went back to the clinic as a paediatrician. Both himself and his psychologist agreed that contact with older male patients might be a trigger, and it would be beneficial for him to be around children to reinforce his caring nature.
John grabbed a beer from the fridge and adjusted his pants to hide his half hard cock. When he was happy with how it looked, he turned and headed back to the front.
The day after tomorrow couldn’t arrive soon enough. John was a nervous wreck. He kept looking over at the clock on the mantle, wishing for time to pass. He closed his eyes and leaned back on the sofa, wishing Sherlock would call or text soon, otherwise he would go crazy. He heard his phone ping and his eyes snapped wide open.
“He sounded so… soft.” She said. I quickly grabbed her earpiece and stepped on it with a crunch. In that last twenty seconds, when I looked up onto the floor where Samuel was on, I saw him looking down at us from the window. I knew he came prepared for this, but I wasn’t. We both knew there was no way for us to save all three of us.
“Hey, John!” Bryn clasped a hand on John’s shoulder and ordered himself a bitter. As the bartender walked away, Bryn took a good long look at his side profile to determine if he was the same guy from two weeks ago.
And we were on. While John and Sherlock was kept occupied by Moriarty’s little game, we had to stay ahead of him to wrap this up. If Q’s sister was caught, there would definitely be more. We were looking at a countdown.
John’s phone pinged on their work table while he was cooking lunch. Rayna was practising the violin with Sherlock and he glanced over.
Sherlock was already in his ‘thinking’ pose when John left. As he was leaving, he saw Bryn’s cab waiting across the road. He went over and knocked on his window.
John cradled Sherlock’s head in his arm against his chest, and massaged the back of Sherlock’s head gently. “Shhh… we can talk about it when you’re comfortable to.”
Greg turned his head and stared at Mycroft, puzzled with those three words. “What’s that?” He asked when Mycroft said nothing to explain.
Damn it. I should have listened to Anthea. And I suppose after that case with the cabbie they would now pay more attention to who’s driving them around.
“Sorry,” John huffed then looked into Molly’s eyes as she peeled herself away from Sally’s arms, “He didn’t mean any of that.”
“John, you are the only one for me. I won’t have anyone else except you. No force is strong enough to tear us apart. I want to take you home, John. Our home.”
“Sharp! You’re preeeeetty good. I want in on your little game with the Consulting Detective. And really? On your birthday? Sooooooo predictable! I can make the game better, if you want.”
Four months after that promise was made, right after the case with the cabbie serial killer, Greg saw a face he was dying to see all week. Looking over his shoulder from the ambulance, Greg watched as Sherlock and John walked away from the man he had lived with for the past four months.
“Then can we go back to starting our Christmas tradition?” John smiled coyly, looking up at Sherlock through his eyelashes.
After dropping John off at New Scotland Yard, I waited until he was out of sight before I texted Anthea.
“Andrew West, known as Westie to his friends. Civil servant. Found dead on the tracks at Battersea Station this morning with his head smashed in.” Mycroft handed the file over to John instead.
“Well, it isn’t always him. Some days I get yelled at for not paying, then I know it’s not him… It wasn’t difficult finding out about the cab company too. I just didn’t expect Mycroft to reach so far this time, setting up a company and taking over the Transport Ministry, all that just to keep an eye on me. That night when we chased the cabbie, he was there, the cabbie.”
My father had his suspicions, thinking that this only happens when rich man come in and kidnap all their children, selling them into modern slavery in the city. I, on the other hand, thought he was trying to harvest my organs and sell them to the highest bidder.
This chapter is 2400 words of smut and fluff to celebrate reaching the halfway mark! If you skip this, you'll miss nothing except the reason why Sherlock is wearing an ugly sweater.
John had no idea what happened the night before, but he could sense that she was furious about something they did.
“Take it outside.” She said, and the brothers pushed their chairs back in sync and walked out the front door.
As I walked into the elevator, the familiar clicks of heels echoed down the hall. Anthea turned the corner and smiled at me, motioning for me to wait.
“You may want to apologise to her, take her out for dinner. I’ve grown very fond of her muffins.” John told Sherlock when the consulting detective was done with his call. “What were you doing blowing up our floor?”
“I’ll go get it.” Sherlock appeared from behind the bookshelf and ran straight for the door, shoving past Mrs Hudson but John caught his arm and pulled him back into the flat.
“Mycroft, promise me something, would you? Promise me you won’t ever tempt me, or push me about this. Promise you’ll wait for me, please?”
Sherlock snorted while he walked past the corpse, or bits and pieces of it, while the shop across the street blasted Elvis Presley’s Blue Christmas.
The bit about Bond night was from John’s blog. The texts between them were originally comments on that blog post, but I thought texting would be more intimate, and warped the context a little to fit my scene.
“Eat up. You’ll need a lot of energy tonight.” John said with a lusty grin when he noticed Sherlock had stopped eating in favour of panting out his mouth.
“Gentleman. Do not let Sherlock engage, at all cost. I’m sure you are all aware of his new relationship status with John Watson, make sure he’s in your radar as well.”
While John was washing his mouth, Sherlock stretched in bed, and felt that bone deep satisfaction from their activities, yet having that urge to continue. It was an odd limbo to be in. Must have been caused by neither of them achieving an orgasm. He was thinking of the ways John would get them both off when said person came back to join him.
“John! Turn off the gas. We are leaving, NOW!” He grabbed John’s mobile and shoved it in his face in the kitchen.
Sherlock sat in Mycroft’s living room, hands wrapped around his knees against his chest. He had been in the same position for days since Molly last visited. He had been contemplating if he should escape for good and leave this all behind.
“These are definitely gang murders. The stab wounds corresponds with the ones you’ve cracked before. And the body is always reported by gang members. The same ones. Find their rival in the same turf and you will most definitely link it back to them.”
John knew at this point that the blank bits of his recollection were caused by his PTSD, and there was no doubt he had nightmares all night long.
Sherlock felt a shiver down his spine. That snog was enough to turn him back on. His cock went from red to purplish in seconds, blood rushing down south a little too fast. He felt John’s hands trailing lower down his side, and ended up once again on his arse.
Sherlock nodded again. He was moving to hug John when he noticed his movements were slightly restricted. Then realisation hit him. “When did I get dressed? I don’t remember doing that.”
Sebastian was annoyed, rightfully so. But to Sherlock, it was all about the puzzle. That man wouldn’t give two shits about instructions, even if they were paid handsomely to follow it.
Samuel’s brother gave a short whispered eulogy of his brother with Anthea and I on his either side. Mister Holmes stood across us from the freshly dug grave with DI Lestrade holding his hand. We all knew how Mister Holmes felt about losing someone, especially after what happened in China.
“Why?” Mycroft’s heart was beating so hard, and his hands clenched tightly to keep himself composed.
It had been a long day. Greg had just arrested a man accused of raping and murdering teenagers. Compiling the transcripts for evidence had been terrible, especially when the online conversations went from ‘how are you doing?’ to sexually explicit content within minutes. Provocative wasn’t a strong enough word for what had went on, apparently for years.
“Are you Doctor Watson?” Sherlock asked, and held out his palm with a scribbled ‘Delivery Order’. “Sign here please.” Sherlock pointed at a line on his palm with a pen.
That night, Greg removed the ring on his finger and threw it out his room window, out into the dark overgrown bushes behind Mycroft’s house.
“The Jaria diamond vanished when the owner went for a drink and showed it off to his associates. But of course, someone planned to steal it, and it vanished. It’s barely a one, John.”
“Mrs. Holmes, I am really, really sorry. We are both grown men, we should have respected your home and you both more than anything.”
John couldn’t finish that thought. He was already in their living room with Sherlock in front of him, motioning for him to unwrap his gift.
Anderson’s stomach flipped when he heard the man mention his name on the phone. He should’ve kept his mouth shut. Better to die than to be tortured. He was kept tied up to a chair for what seemed to be hours before the door to his basement opened, and Sally stood there.
Bryn was just leaving Mycroft’s office after their briefing on Moriarty’s additional surveillance. Two agents were on the same train cabin as Sherlock, and Moriarty was two cabins away.
I'm playing very fast and loose with the theme, but I think it's good enough since I've wrote the "Family" theme in an earlier chapter with Mr. & Mrs. Holmes.
“Are you going to interrogate me at all, Captain Watson?” Sherlock had put on his haughtiest look and voice, goading John to
“Before we get to the rules stuff, can I ask you something?” Greg asked when the waiter left them with their chips.
John eventually got the entire length of his index finger buried deep inside Sherlock. He fucked Sherlock with a finger for a minute or so, then slicked up the next finger to join the first. This went on again and again until John had four fingers cramped together in Sherlock’s tight hole.
“Moriarty.” Was all he said, and she tried to hide the fear in her eyes, but that split second was all Mycroft needed to know for sure.
Soo Lin was one of the first Black Lotus runners into Britain. After a few passes, she fell into J’s radar. The last time she entered the United Kingdom, J picked her up and recruited her. He knew she wanted to leave that life behind, and offered her an out for information.
“Then I saved you, Mycroft and Lestrade showed up, I carried you back here, threw you in the shower and here we are.”
They both ignored it for the first two times in favour of sucking each other’s tongue, but the third ring jerked Sherlock away and out the bedroom in search of his phone.
“Kate, I’m sorry. We were really drunk that night, and I swear, it was a one time thing. We work together. It never would’ve worked out for us anyway. We agreed to bury that night as a mistake. I hope you’ll forgive him. I don’t really care if you would be angry at me for the rest of your life, but please, at least accept my apology.”
There were three stacks of case files in the middle. He took the stack on the far left and opened the first file.
We were all huddled in M’s office that night, going through the plans once again. Everything went according to it. And there we all were, exhausted, letting go a breath we all were holding, waiting for the last piece to be moved.
And John was right. They had missed it so many times, when John finally noticed the clue Sherlock had been leaving behind, he was angry at himself. The times when Sherlock showed up at the corner of Baker Street where the CCTVs are, he would leave a coded message by tapping his finger on his thigh. It was Morse code, but translating it directly would make no sense to anyone except for Mycroft. The code was a Holmes family secret, not even the spouses are allowed to learn.
Sherlock got home an couple of hours earlier than expected while John was out. He looked around and quickly concluded that John was having a pint with Aaron,
He yelled for Sherlock running up the stairs. Panic was rising in his throat as he prepared himself for a devastating scene - Sherlock on the ground, bleeding, or in a bag...
It had been a roller coaster ride since Greg first found out that his wife was cheating. The first time he found out was six months after meeting one Mycroft Holmes,
Upstairs, Sherlock was desperately trying to redirect John’s attention away from his rivalry with Mycroft. Thankfully, Lestrade called Sherlock immediately after receiving a text from Mycroft.
Finally I have answers for WHO THE HELL IS J. I've never seen Mycroft as a cold hearted beast. He's actually a fragile sheet of ice.
John’s voice was breaking at the end. He was very close to another episode of PTSD triggered attack, just like the one he had when they caught Black Lotus.
“No! You’re mine, Philip. I can’t let you go back to her… Come away with me for my birthday next week, please. You don’t even love her anymore!”
“I trust you, Gregory, with everything. The papers are there to give them permission to terminate us when we are no longer sane, to prevent us from spilling secrets in moments of weakness.” Mycroft said in hushed tones. Greg shifted to sit shoulder to shoulder with Mycroft, trying to comfort the love of his life as subtly as he could manage.
John felt for them. He remembered the first and only time they were caught fucking on the stairs by Mrs. Hudson, and the hell that she rained upon them. He had goosebumps just thinking about it. So he decided to help a mate out, and sent a text to Mrs. Holmes from Greg’s phone.
His business with Scotland Yard elevated security measures from two to six in the matter of two weeks! How dangerous are street criminals in London these days? I read a few news articles about some of the cases he had solved. Well, if he is hunting serial killers or influential people trying to cover up their own crimes, the security is justifiable, I suppose.
“That was the fourth. The first three weren’t strong enough, the fourth blew through an exact replica of the cabinet and through the floor.”
Halfway through the performances, Sherlock disappeared into the backroom and left John looking for him. John saw some odd movements in the drapes behind the center stage and suddenly Sherlock came flying out. The performers (or criminals) put up a fight, and John knocked one of them out. Sherlock could only catch a glimpse of his foot before John pulled him, running away from the location.
It was when John sat up, he realised he was in his pajamas, smelling fresh, and in Sherlock’s bed. The consulting detective, however, was still in the same suit he was in last night, with a ghastly look on his face.
He was excited but worried at the same time. While they have explored many sexual acts, one that had not yet happen was Sherlock bottoming. He’s had John’s finger a few times, not that Sherlock cared, but he never had a good experience being penetrated. He was either high or knocked out when those times happened, and the aftermath was a little hassle to deal with. There were never any serious injuries, because even when he was high, he made sure that he was well loosened up before making any deals, just in case a blowjob wasn’t enough to pay for his building tolerance to cocaine.
The week after they solved the case with the pink lady, John Watson waved for a cab as I made the corner onto Baker Street. I assumed Sherlock was right behind him. As he got onto the cab, he asked to be taken to Scotland Yard. I couldn’t say no lest he finds out who I really am. But to his credit, he did anyway.
The last thing I saw was John and Sherlock jumping into the pool before I was thrown off the roof by the explosion.
Greg thought. This man stops using contractions in his sentences when he’s putting up a wall, the wall they had slowly torn down in the name of friendship between them over the past two years, the wall Greg had desperately tried to keep down.
Them walking down the stairs triggered Bryn to move. He realised that they would be splitting up in this investigation and called his team to keep an eye on Sherlock. It seemed like he would be walking to see Van Coon’s personal assistant at the bank. John would need the cab.
For a moment, Greg thought Mycroft was taking a piss, “piece of paper? Is that what you posh people say two hundred pages?” The DI giggled, but the look on the other man’s face was serious. And oh, Greg had no idea how terrifying Mycroft Holmes is, at all.
“Yes, John, I am alive. Sorry, I am so sorry for leaving you in grief. All that you went through was my fault… I love you John, please, forgive me.”
“Sure.” I had the file open on the kitchen counter. “But what is your name?” When there was no reply, I looked up and saw he was gone. Gathering up my things, I walked to the front door to see his car was also gone, along with the men in black suits hiding in our garden.
“You were serious about Bond night.” Sherlock whined, but nonetheless stayed seated on the sofa with a throw pillow across his lap. If John didn’t know Sherlock better, he would’ve thought that as an invitation to lie down.
No return address. He climbed the stairs and made a beeline to the bedroom. Opening the envelope, he sat down abruptly on the bed and pulled out a card. It was a short note, but it was enough to drive John absolutely furious.
John thought to himself. His mind swam around that idea for a long while before Sally’s voice made an appearance in his train of thoughts -
”It’s only your second time meeting me. No one in this family is really normal if you think about it.” Mr. Holmes quickly commented when he stopped gasping for air.
“What?” John was now confused. It seemed to him like the brothers were having a separate conversation from the words that were coming out of their lips.
We stared at each other for a quick second and started giggling like schoolgirls. Her laugh, I will never get enough of the sound of her laughter.
A year after Layla’s murder, Kate and Philip Anderson had decided to file for a divorce. Sally was over the moon! But before she could properly claim Philip as her own, he had decided to drop off the grid and went into hiding. It was eight more years before anyone saw him again.
“It's an abomination. You stuff noodles into flour with some spices, is that what it is?” She replied with a faux-disgusted look on her face.
John reached out and touched Sherlock’s eye bag gently with his fingertips, “you didn’t get any sleep?”
John took him by surprise after the little gift Greg planned for them. And he was still pleasantly surprised at how domineering his doctor was, given that he had hid all that away under ugly jumpers for years.
“Sure.” John hung up and went upstairs to change. He grabbed his brown jacket and headed down the street to the bar.
“Alright, enough.” John finally said. “It’s a bloody crime scene and we’re in here discussing my potential sex life? Come on Sherlock, we’re leaving!”
“Would you… can I have a bit of time to think this over? I’m not sure if I want to know.” Greg said, a little unsure of his decision. “Hey, I still love you for who you are, no matter what you do for a living, alright? I know it’s hard to believe me right now, but please, just give me a few days to mull things over. I won’t leave you because of this, I promise.” Greg quickly added when he saw Mycroft’s face falter.
“Help. She’s… dead. Help, please!” She cried into the phone and leaned closed to the girl. There was no conscience, guilt or remorse in her mind. ‘
The scene was set. All she has to do now is to go home and wait for the call. She stripped down the sheet of plastic around her body and stuffed it in a bag before leaving the crime scene.
This wasn’t the first time John had to dress one Sherlock Holmes in his Mind Palace. He doesn’t seem to realise, but his body reacts in sync with John’s touches.
The night before came back to him, and he smiled to himself. He reached his arm over to the other side of the bed and found the owner of this bed. Slowly opening his eyes, he saw a pair of blue-green eyes staring right into his.
“You heard perfectly well John. I heard Mother shouting last night when you were snoring away.” Sherlock answered on behalf of the other two without looking up from the papers. He took a large gulp of his coffee, then announced that he has some samples to collect from the garden, leaving John alone with Greg and Mycroft.
Psychopaths wouldn’t understand love as an emotion. However, possessiveness would be an adequate equivalent to love.
At the back, I found a business card without a name, only a number. I’ve recognised it from my days with intelligence. Q-branch made those. These cards are microchipped. If found in the wrong location, it would self-combust. I quickly memorised the number and threw it into the fireplace.
“Sally, is it?” Sally nodded as the detective spoke to her gently, “I need you to tell me what happened, could you do that?”
“Yes you do. Shut up before I shut you up for good. Using your brother’s son like that… I am so disappointed in you.”
John nodded, and Sherlock pushed John’s knees up as far as it could go, greedily licking at John’s hole. He wasn’t good with intimacy, but sex was nothing new to him. It used to be a way to curb his hormones, or a transaction, but this was new. This will not be fast and hard like it used to be.
“Could this be related to… can’t be. His affair was obvious with Donovan.” John whispered to Sherlock over Layla’s body.
In all future chapters, I will include some additional pieces outside of Bryn’s story, and they will be indicated by “###” break lines. I promised Johnlock and Mystrade, so here we start! Xx
Today is a special day. Four years. John was getting better, and Sherlock had learnt the value of sentiment, of how precious emotions can be when it is with the people you love.
We also bugged the phone (obviously) when we inspected it. It would be moronic of us to not expect a call. And the moment we were alerted to an incoming call on that pink phone, there was a whirlwind of action within Q-Branch. Anthea and I walked right in the middle of it, holding burgers and chips to find Q… frantic.
A loud crash forced John to open his eyes. Two men in suits broke down the attic door and shot the cloth holding John’s neck. It ripped and sent John falling down. They helped him up and called in his doctor.
If it wasn't clear enough in the chapter, Greg and Mycroft are living together but in separate rooms, no physical contact. They still date and stuff, but no touching and kissing... until Greg gets his divorce papers. He will, eventually, but to stick as close to canon as possible, he doesn't until further down the line.
John slowed down and opened the door, finding Sherlock flushed, wrapped in his Belstaff… and blushing. What’s Sherlock pretending to be now? Was this for a case?
Both of them had led fairly normal lives. Went to public schools, college and eventually graduated with flying colors. They were very capable young men, and everyone who worked for The Web knew that the twins would take the organization to greater heights.
“Just leave the dishes in the sink and go take a shower. Thoroughly, my love. I’m gonna need five minutes, alright?” John said as he stood up to go upstairs to their bedroom.
“Oh god, Lay? Oh no… no!” Kate cried when Layla went limp and fell on the floor. Before she could reach out, she felt a pair of hands around her neck pulling her away.
When M returned to active duty, he was required to have the umbrella with him at all times. There were a few instances where A found him carrying a regular umbrella, and the shitstorm that went through Q-branch was terrifying.
“Wonderful observation. We just need to cover it back up, which is why I needed the chlorine, John. Did you get it?”
“Moriarty was going to kill you. I couldn’t let him do that. I had to protect--” Sherlock was about to explain himself when he felt a sharp pain on his scalp. John had tugged his hair so hard he had to pull away.
“Oh John. What is it-- Oh, oh!” Sherlock exclaimed when he looked at what John was pointing at. “Soo Lin, at the museum, she started to translate the code for us. We didn’t see it.”
That could have been me. He should have been able to get out of there without a single scratch. With all the brain power combined between Mister Holmes, Q and Anthea, they couldn’t figure out a plan to do just that?
“Let’s go get some Chinese. Get changed.” Then Sherlock pulled himself out of the gap and went straight into his own bedroom.
“There was someone else, but I couldn’t see, or hear… I don’t remember what happened, but I know I didn’t kill Layla. It wasn’t me!”
“Congratulations. You’ve won the bet. Now, let’s get down to business.” Q followed up the briefing. It was simple. Follow John and Sherlock, contain Black Lotus, and capture Zhi Zhu and General Shan.
“Jim Moriarty, born James Julius Moriarty. He’s been wanted by eighteen agencies across the globe, including ours, since he was six.”
“I am given access to everything and anything I require to make decisions for… everything. The richest family in the world who controls the financial sphere, governments, secret agencies, espionage. Anything you can think of, every conspiracy you’ve ever heard, I probably had a finger in it.
John moaned in his throat lowly when Sherlock switched from his knee to his thigh, trapping John’s erection against the softest part of his inner thigh against John’s stomach. Sherlock was also hard, bucking his hips and rubbing himself on John’s hip.
John was intrigued by Sherlock’s behaviour. He walked mindlessly back to their home, wondering what his partner was up to. As he opened the door to their home, he noticed the curtains were drawn, and candles were lit. It smelt like lavender.
While John probed further as to why Mycroft was so interested in this case, Sherlock felt a tad bit prouder than he should with his doctor’s line of reasoning.
It's been awhile since I've wrote or posted anything. Life catches up to you. Bills ain't paying themselves :(
All that happened while John ordered takeaway and set the table for supper. He opened a bottle of wine, sniffed it twice to make sure it wasn’t refilled with acid, and poured out two glasses. When someone knocked on the door downstairs, for a split second he wondered how did the delivery boy got here so quickly, but dismissed that thought in favour of filling his stomach.
Sherlock walked right by and pretended he did not hear that. He knew John would take care of her comment soon enough.
“So,” Jim sets down a mug on the table next to Sherlock, “let’s get right down to business. I have a proposition for you.”
The younger Holmes squirmed when he heard Mycroft’s tone. Something was coming towards them, and with Mycroft behaving like that, he knew things were going to get very ugly, very soon.
Gas explosion was the official report. Of course Q-Branch was all over it. We had to declare Samuel as killed-in-action although his body was never found. I wasn’t surprised at that. He was standing right next to almost a kilogram of C4. His body would have been shattered into dust.
I will be taking a one month break from this fic (after chapter 20) to work on another one I'm co-authoring with TheLadyofMusic. Check it out if you like parent!lock and some pregnancy drama.
Imagine this with me - with sixty seconds to go, switching out an old lady who’s blind, filled with fear, strapped in… well, enough explosives to blow me into bits, with a two day old corpse of one of Moriarty’s men in disguise…
“Are you wearing… is that a…” Greg was lost for words. Never had he seen Mycroft wear anything other than parts of a three-piece suit, his pyjamas or a birthday suit.
By the time he got home, Sherlock dismissed his complaints about an ASBO and his court date with a ‘good, fine’. His head was still wrapped around the cipher. All John wanted was to take off his jacket, make himself a nice cuppa and sit down, relax, perhaps watch some crap telly for the rest of the day.
“John. Why are you staring at me like that?” Sherlock noticed something off with how John is behaving. He was looking at the splatter patterns on the Christmas tree when he caught John’s face through the corner of his eye. There was something endearing about the way his eyes beamed, and it made Sherlock… feel.
“That ok?” John asked when he pulled away. It was an innocent kiss, just a peck on the lips, but John wanted more. He needed Sherlock to be alright with more.
Mycroft had stationed two of his most trusted men near the safe house. He knew John would try to take his own life. He also had pinhole cameras installed to cover every corner of the house. John’s privacy was irrelevant at that moment. Keeping him alive was the only thing that mattered.
It wasn’t the first time John or Greg had met the Holmes parents, but that was when they were only friends with their sons. Now that they are dating/engaged with one, it was to no one’s surprise that they were anxious going down the stairs towards the kitchen for dinner.
I mean, we were dirt shit poor. My mother used to steal cars in the nearby cities to get by before she met my father. There was no way we could have afforded that car. Also we don’t have any friends or family member with that kind of money. Imagine driving a sedan like that through dirt roads that even horses frown upon.
