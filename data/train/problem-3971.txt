Dean wanted to rip the vocal cords out of Castiel, if only for lighting that spark in Dean that made him infuriated beyond belief every time he spoke.
“That’s not my name.”
in heaven and hell can tell you two are head over heels for each other,” Rowena waved a hand at them. “So I’m glad you were finally able to see it for yourselves! Honestly, I was getting a little worried after what happened to…ah, well…but it turned out okay in the end!”
Dean frowns. “What ideas?”
Dean felt his heart sink again. Considers asking Sam to drive. Remembers Sam just lost the world.
Cas,” Dean snaps, “
Cas sighed, looking down at himself.
Cas looks lost. “I don’t know…Jack didn’t give me a script for this part.”
Dean pulls away.
you. I’m—listen, I’m
“If you’re going to ask me what I see in him, the answer is simple,” Cas says, dusting off his fingers from pizza crust crumbs. He lifts his eyes to meet Sam’s. “Everything.”
“To your car,” Cas clarifies. “Why are you letting me drive your car? You never let anyone do that.”
He leaves Cas to stare after him, fighting a chill on the way to the impala. It’s weird opening the passenger’s side door, but he settles in in time to see Cas beginning to head over. After a few seconds, Dean’s breath fogs up the glass. He wipes a sleeve over it to clear it, revealing Cas once more—closer, this time.
Cas tilts his head, eyebrows furrowed in that way of his, and Dean thinks he looks perfect. When he dips forward and presses their lips together, it’s perfect, perfect, perfect. He’s warm, his face is burning, eyes almost watering when he pulls away.
“No,” Sam says quickly, “not in-the-same-room together, but like…
“Uh-huh.” They step through the kitchen and Dean eyes a half-eaten snack on the table. He quickly nicks it, gives it a once-over, and takes a bite. The taste of chocolate caramel nougat makes him let out a low groan of satisfaction.
“He, um. Well, I gotta ask…I know he’s—I know you two are good friends,” he says, and to Cas’ glare, “sorry,
“Dean, uh, prayed to me,” Cas told her. Dean was pretty sure that
Sam presses his lips together to contain a laugh, continuing when he’s got it under control, “Perhaps. But for a price!”
. He always,
“No,” his voice was hoarse again. Dean swallowed. “No, you’re good.”
Skeptically, Dean starts descending down the stairs.
“Hey! Not fair,” Dean motions to himself and his attire. “He wouldn’t even tell me who I was supposed to be. What story are we doing? Shouldn’t I, y’know, be getting a script, or something?”
Dean shifts his weight, feeling the keys in his pocket. Before he can think on it too much, he tosses them over the fire to Cas.
“Wait, what?”
She nodded. “Yes! I knew you would do it
What had made Dean choke was that he wasn't exactly wrong.
“Just…out,” he says.
“It’s me,” Cas replies. “Well, more accurately...it’s my Grace.”
“Sam’s Ursula,” Jack continues, clearing his throat to say the next part in one quick exhale, “Dean-is-Prince-Eric, and Cas-is-Ariel.”
He blinks up slowly, sees Sam’s form through the windows of the Gas-N-Sip. He remembers Cas, in a blue uniform, fiddling with a slushee machine that he had no business tending to.
The first problem was that he was wet. Clothes-sticking-to-your-skin wet, down to his socks, which was just
' anymore."
Jack wants to say something. He wants to comfort. He knows Cas would comfort. So he takes a deep breath to start, and—
"So..."
, I’m assuming, but Dean took it…as…”
Dean looks down at it. Back at Cas.
“Jesus, Dean! I was freaked at first because I was sure I’d accidentally let Cas’ secret slip with too much of the teasing, but no—turns out,” he starts chuckling again, “you’re just more of an idiot than I thought.”
Dean grips the couch cushions so hard, his knuckles turn white.
They stare at each other, transfixed, and Dean thinks Cas looks more innocent with this hat on, more so than, say, that cowboy hat Dean had made him wear once. Almost silly enough for Dean to let his guard down, to lean forward, and—
Sam and Jack were just inches away from them. They were pretending. It wasn’t real.
“What changed?” Dean repeats. He isn’t sure. Shakes his head a bit in thought.
Cas smiles back at him, soft and genuine. The skin around his eyes crinkling tells more than the gentle upturn of his mouth.
. We can at least do this. Besides, what’s the harm in it?”
Sam roughly grabs one of the mugs behind him and heads for the coffee machine, needing to get some caffeine in him to be even
“You smell like sulfur and...metal.”
“Nothing changed,” He decides. Dean sees Sam walking back towards the car, swallows hard to keep it contained, to keep his voice even. “That was the problem.”
“You said we still smelled,” Cas said from the other side of the spray. He had a small bottle of shampoo in his hands, like the ones motels usually carried, and brought it up to his nose to sniff it once before squeezing some onto his hand.
“No,” Dean says again. He meets Cas’ eyes. “
“They’re good. Yeah…good.”
Sam and Cas frown at each other, confused. Sam reworks the conversation and what Cas had just said, pinching the bridge of his nose when get gets it, just a second away from going after Dean to clear things up—
together.”
Dean blinks at him, then at Sam, and after coming to a decision in his head, pushes past the both of them and out of the kitchen.
“No,” Dean says slowly, “I just don’t like the idea of my best friend and my brother…y-y’know,” he waves his hand vaguely, “that.”
"I—I guess I am, man, yeah. I mean, I'd like to think I'm a little less pathetic, and I'm probably not as
Dean turns back to Cas. Just a hug. They’ve hugged before. This would be fine. Normal, even.
“Hm?”
timing. He was pretty sure that if he had to endure another second of this hell scape, Dean would have completely lost it.
“No,” Sam says immediately. “Well, kinda. It’s not your fault. Uh, remember when I said that Dean can be an idiot sometimes?”
Dean’s back in the kitchen one night, eyes half closed as he tries squinting through a migraine to retrieve another beer from the refrigerator, when he stops before he can walk through the doorway.
“Dude, you just got back from the
“Special. You’re everything, Cas,” he whispers back, heart in his throat. “You mean everything to me.”
Dean almost choked on his—well, he wasn’t really sure
Sam only grins.
“Hang on—you left the oven on unattended?” Sam says. Pulling his eyes away from Cas, Dean chuckles at the wild look on Sam’s face, like he’s half ready to bolt for the cabin to stop it from catching fire.
Sam raised his eyebrows. “Braxxie?”
Sam shoves his arm playfully. “Course we did. Now quit pouting and come eat some pie.”
“You two always come out here practically naked,” Cas says, leaving Dean and handing Sam his own jacket. “And the lumberjack outfits are fine for when it’s any other season, but you do realize it’s the dead of winter, right?”
Dean splutters into his drink at that, sitting up to wipe eggnog from his mouth and set the cup on the coffee table. He shoots Cas a look, but Cas is still frowning, head tilted in question and maybe a little bit of concern at Dean's reaction.
“Perfect.” Dean said. He eyed the painting one more time, weirdly relating to the sense of unease it brought out, and nudged his brother to get going.
Sam is sure that whatever Dean lacks in height, he makes up for in the size of the stupidity that he stores somewhere deep within his brain.
, but, yes. My gift to you, if you’ll take it.”
or not. Doesn't matter, we're...I—
He turns back to Sam, who focuses on Dean once more, seemingly having caught sight of the smoke too.
“So...that was it, huh?”
“I knew about Cas’ deal. He told me not to tell you or Sam, but…” Jack lets out a breath, working around his thoughts. “But Cas told me he was far from happy. I don’t understand what
The conversation takes them to way past midnight, and to Sam’s surprise when he wakes the next day for his morning jog, Dean is already up and milling about the kitchen.
All he knew was that he didn’t want to find out.
Dean could barely hear anything over the sound of his heart pounding in his chest.
Sam relaxes, forcing a smile. “Right. Uh, Dean? Can we talk for a second?”
Sam has a look of growing concern on his face, something Dean thinks is teetering too close to pity.
Sam is quiet for a second before he notes, “You want to stay.”
“Dean, this is playing dress up for our kid, not dress
Cas sat up, which would have been great if they weren’t completely wet, and if Cas wasn’t
“But if—if you
“Who do you think you are, human?” Castiel was a mere few inches from Dean’s face. He could feel his exhales on his chin. “To question me—you should rethink your position. You are nothing.”
He laughs. “So
“We can’t stay here,” Sam says, “We have to find a way out.”
“The logical route would be to pair up,” Cas says seriously, “You and Sam have done this before, so each of you gets a sled.”
“I was under the impression that you wanted to be as far away from me as possible, at all times. Keep me here if you wish. It’s no bother to me.” Castiel drew in his wings to fit them inside the circle. His stare didn’t falter.
“Ariel, you don’t have your voice back yet,” Sam says, cutting Cas off before he can finish. Cas shuts his mouth. “Go on, Dean, it can just be a hug.”
Cas looks confused, like he’s about to repeat what he just said. Dean stops him short with a wave of his hand.
him. Cas was strong and brave and true.
Dean frowns down at the watch on his wrist, tilting it to get a better look at the time. He’d been sure it was past Sam’s usual bedtime, which was why he’d snuck out of his room in the first place. Dean thinks he can make out ‘2:30 am’ from the thin little hands, one of which ticks away much slower than the rate he thinks seconds actually pass.
“So there
“But then why—”
“Yes. This is an angel banquet, but often times reapers are invited as well. It’s…a welcome change for them to all see each other without the threat of great catastrophe looming over their heads.”
“—like a sister, really, and I support it. I do. But come on, man.
“He’s so beautiful,” Cas continues. It still sounds to Dean like Cas is forcing the words out, but Dean can honestly barely hear them anyway over the sound of his heart beating against his rib cage.
Dean's staring at Cas, a glass full of eggnog resting against his lips. Behind the rim of it he’s hiding a smile at Cas' thoughtful squint, as Cas watches the end credits roll on the television.
“…Yeah?”
“Sure.”
together. Like… in a relationship.”
“Alright,” Jack holds his hands up, as if to set the scene. “So Ariel, you’ve just saved Dean—I mean, Prince Eric—from drowning in the ocean. Eric, you’re still unconscious on the sand.”
He stops his slow pacing in front of his own duffle, sticking in a loose plaid and zipping it shut in a few short tugs of the zipper. He shoulders it, smiles at where Dean stands, frozen, and brushes past him to the door.
After that he finds the smallest bulbs that won’t take up too much space on the little thing, passing them to Cas who hands them to Jack to put on the tree. Working like clockwork, the tree is decorated sooner rather than later, and Dean straightens up in time to hear the front door open with a metal squeal.
“It is,” Cas says, “He’s actually out on a jog right now, he said he’d be back to help with the baking.”
“And,” Cas says. Dean turns back.
“Just two,” Dean hurries to tell him. Sam shoots him a quizzical look.
Dean’s expression fell, and he gave Cas the most deadpan look he could muster.
“Ariel, it’s Ariel!” Jack whispers.
Sam slides the other mug over and pours.
Cas moves closer on the couch, and their knees touch just barely. Dean watches Cas’ Grace dip underneath his chin as Cas pulls the chain around his neck. He can feel Cas’ arms raised on either side of him as he fastens it, can smell Cas’ scent from how close they are.
She was sitting on her throne, smiling at them with a weird glint in her eye. It was starting to feel hot in here. Dean didn’t like how it seemed as though the walls were closing in on him.
“I thought Cas said there weren’t many angels left.” He plucked up something colorful from a serving tray, smiling in thanks. “So who—or
Dean thinks, for the first time, as he pulls more confetti from Cas’ hair, that it actually is.
Dean’s face turns into that hard mask he puts on when he’s about to breach a heavy topic. So Sam straightens, shifting his weight, and awaits the talk of torture, or death, or whatever depressing topic Dean comes up with. He’ll deal with it, even if it means being here in this ratty motel room for another thirty minutes.
Dean scoffs, “You’ll lose.”
on Cas’ chest. He had been looking at the necklace.
“Besides,” Jack studies the bulb, “We’re starting late. Christmas is only a week away, and I know people who start decorating in November!”
I’ll stop you from leaving whenever I say something wrong. I’ll—I’ll make sure you
Sam disappears back behind the couch, and Jack pops his head out next.
The moment is broken when Sam pops his head up above the couch with a wide smile.
Dean shrugs Sam’s hand off of his shoulder and shakes his head, mouth curved up in a confused smile of his own. “Wait, what? What secret?”
“Yeah, well,” Dean fixed his eyes on his shoes. “If you want to start fixing it, then this would be the place to start.”
“Well, hop on then Louise and we’ll sail off this cliff together,” Dean says. He waits for the recognition to spark in Cas’ eyes and he smiles—for real this time—as Cas situates himself in the front of the sled. He spares Jack and Sam a glance, amused at how Sam is struggling not to take up most of the sled with his legs, before sitting down behind Cas.
When Dean recovered from his small fit (with the help of Sam’s firm pats on the back), he did his best to keep his eyes on Cas’ face.
“Un–?”
Dean wets his lips, “I know, Sammy, but…” He looks over at Jack and Cas.
Cas makes a motion for Sam to continue, scratching at the corner of his mouth with his knuckle and then fitting the last bit of crust between his teeth.
“I’m not…
Dean finds himself mirroring his brother, but otherwise smiling despite himself.
“I think we can fast forward through the beginning parts where it’s just Ariel and get to the part where she meets the prince,” Jack suggests.
Cas pushes the door open and turns, leading the way for Dean to follow.
Sam is fast asleep, sprawled out on the couch hours later with one of his hands brushing the floor. Dean thinks he spots drool on the pillow underneath him.
That’s when it begins to click in Sam’s brain, and he lets out a displeased groan, running a hand over his face.
“Why Dean, aren’t you being quite rude to your queen?”
Dean grimaces but rests again against the couch, watching Sam flip between some murder mystery show and a documentary from National Geographic during alternating commercial breaks, until he feels boredom start to kick in.
Dean crosses his arms. He doesn’t have a good argument, and he knows it.
What the hell kind of story were they about to play?
for it all—when had he
might be good.
Not with Cas gone.
Cas shoots him a glare over his shoulder. Dean shrugs.
“Was that…was that kiss real or just…part of the story?”
He squeezed his eyes shut when he heard the bathroom door tap the wall, wishing he could hide behind the walls of the tub forever.
,” Sam muttered back. “Besides, we can scope things out. See how things are for ourselves.”
based off of
Sam shrugs, trying to hide a smile. “Plot what? The story already exists, Dean. We’re just going to…act it out.”
“’Mornin,” Dean says, sparing Sam a glance over his shoulder. Sam can smell the freshly brewed coffee, as well as hear the eggs and bacon simmering from their respective pans.
So he nods and leans forward, wrapping his arms around Cas in a hug. He feels Cas’ hands on his back, fisting the fabric of his shirt, and when Dean pulls away it’s only far enough back that he and Cas are nose to nose. His eyes flit down to Cas’ lips, and then back to Cas’ eyes. His breath hitches in his chest, heart racing—
, period. Just a blazer on top of bare skin, which was a stark contrast to his usual fifty layers of clothing and coats he wore day in and day out. The blazer was black and sequined with silver on the sleeves. Dean found himself wishing Cas would wear black more often, or at least maybe shed the tan trench coat once or twice a month in favor of the black suit jacket underneath.
Dean stares at him a second and then huffs, turning away to rub a hand over his face. “Don’t make me say it, man. You and Cas! All the—the flirting a-and the nudging and the whistling, it’s just. Too much.”
“Fine,” Sam grits out, turning his head to shout, “CAS!”
“Jack, will you finally tell us what this is about?” Cas asks, exasperated. He pulls absentmindedly at the hem of his vest.
Dean flinched. Oh god.
“Oh, good. At least the feeling’s mutual,” Cas watched the angels and reapers from afar, messing with his sleeves. Cuffing them, folding them back down again.
“Uh…hi?” Dean asks, before remembering that Cas isn’t supposed to speak. He leans over the side of the couch to where Jack and Sam are.
“I hope you can hear me,” Dean starts. He’s said those words before. He thinks this time won’t be like the last, that he’s not lucky enough for this to end with an embrace, with a sigh of relief.
Dean planted his eyes firmly on a painting on the wall. He tilted his head a little…was that
He’s my—that’s—” Dean twists his face in discomfort, “that’s just…
He looks away, making a face at the stench. It could be
“Sorry to wake you,” Cas mutters. “Ah, Jack and I were wondering if you were—if you wanted to help us with something.”
“Uh,” he scratches at his hair, “what’s all this?”
Sam looks down at Dean with an evil glint in his eye.
“What do I do now?”
Krissy says, before he can say his goodbyes,
His eyes meet Cas’ again, dropping momentarily to look at his lips before Dean forces them to stay on Cas’ baby blues.
Dean tenses, looks away. “What about him?”
“Hey, no. My trauma is fine. Dean,” Sam redirects his attention to him, “It’s today. Did you really forget?”
“You…this…” he manages.
Dean’s eyes go wide. “What the hell are you doing?”
It wasn’t like the first time they met, sparks flying, Castiel’s indifference when Dean had stabbed him. No, this time there were no sparks, only the angel suddenly appearing about a foot in front of him, wings spread so far out that they brushed up against the walls of the house.
“It’s
“What, uh. What about you?” He swallows again. “You happy?”
Cas’ eyes glisten. “I will,” he says. “I will.”
Dean waves a hand, “Wait, I thought you said you and Cas…weren’t…” he shakes his head a little. Sam stays quiet, this time, waiting for it to hit Dean square across the face.
“Something on your mind?” Dean asks, because he wants to know.
Cas leans forward, then, a hand on Dean’s shoulder while the other moves to cup his jaw. He presses their lips together softly, gently, in the type of care that Dean only remembers receiving on his way out of hell. The way a soul mends, slowly and deliberately—that’s the way Cas kisses him now.
Dean licks his lips, once, and closes the space between them. He presses his lips softly to Cas', trembling a little due to the action. It's chaste, and feels simultaneously like it lasts an eternity and only a few seconds—something Dean thinks only Cas is capable of doing.
Dean was still skeptical, but Cas seemed sincere enough for Dean to trust him and try to keep their disturbance at the banquet to a minimum. He kept feeling their glares, though, from nearly every corner of the room.
“Are you happy?”
, it’s for Sam, alright? Don’t–don’t tell me you have a grudge against him, too. This animosity is just between
, I guess, and now…we’re here.”
She shrugged. “Oh, it’s just…it seems like you two sorted things out. You’re back to standing without a hair’s breadth between you.”
Cas turned his back to the rest of the room. “Both, if I had to guess.”
. He remembers realizing that was all he ever wanted.
By the time Dean presses his back to the inside of his door, his brain feels close to rupturing from how fast he had retreated out of there. Prayers were
Dean’s eyes follow the direction of Sam’s finger, which is pointing to somewhere on the ground and behind Dean, off to his left. Just at the edge of the hill sit two sleds—the old, wooden kind that seem like they’re always one good bump away from splintering into a million pieces, but somehow never do.
“Look, I don’t care if you—if he—if
Dean feels his chest go tight with anticipation for a second, and then it subsides. He nods.
, Cas, I don’t want us to go back to how things were. Thinking about that, I can’t—I just…”
There’s a moment of silence, of just the rattling in the vents.
“The—” Dean runs a hand over his face, pressing briefly over his eyes to wake himself better. They’d already
“You think…me and Cas. You think we’re…”
) also co-habited. Needless to say, the dream had come out of nowhere, but it was easy enough to forget once the smell of bacon made its way into his room.
Cas smiles. “I think technically it was
Dean nods slowly. “Okay,” he accepts.
, and for that hour Dean felt more like himself than he had since…well, since he was last himself. He couldn’t exactly remember when that was, but he figures it was a long time ago. Back when…

isn’t there when Ariel saves Eric.”
“Hey, uh,” he starts, fiddling with his beer, “so…Dean…”
Jack’s eyes are trained on the mirror.
The day had already started out weird enough.
Dean hears Cas clear his throat.
Dean freezes.
So the door was more jammed than open. It was stuck, and Dean was somewhere between feeling everything at once and feeling nothing at all.
to dress up as?”
That’s what Sam had meant to say.
, Dean, but the hair’s a good place to start.”
Cas levels him with a stare that says ‘really?’ and Dean moves to meet him half way.
“Say it,” Cas whispers. Dean isn’t sure when it happened, but Cas was closer, now, and Dean was no longer pressed against the door.
“Sure we have, Dean. We dress up for cases all the time.”
, Sam, it’s for the nerdy angels over there.”
Sam starts gesturing with his hands, trying to get Dean to understand him, “You—just now. When you thought Cas and I were a-a thing, or whatever…you didn’t approve of…us…because you were...
“You forgot your beanie,” Jack explains, and then looking up at them, “I thought you guys came out ahead of us so you could ‘get the sleds ready.’ Cas and I started on the cookies so they should be done by the time we get back.”
“No, I can do it myself!”
Sam nods, letting out a relieved breath. He gives Dean an
For a week after they’d left Chuck in the dirt, Dean couldn’t be bothered to actually make himself
“If it was anyone else, man, it’d be fine. It’d be fine, I swear, but—”
Cas frowns, and Dean rolls his eyes. It’s another few moments of tense silence, until Dean breaks it, his heart pounding in his chest.
, staring at him with worry.
There was a lot to fix.
“What?”
Cas huffed. “Obviously I am trying to get the stench out.”
The next time Sam’s alone with Cas, he feels an obligation to knock some sense into him.

—had said it out loud. Cas was different. Every other Cas in every other universe had left Dean. Permanently. But Cas…oh, Cas had chosen to stay. Even if it had seemed like all he did was leave, Dean realized now that Cas had chosen to
“I can’t tell if the looks we’re getting are for you or us,” Sam laughed nervously.
Dean resisted rolling his eyes, but he knew Sam was right. It was just…
“It’s a private moment!” Jack whisper-shouts. “Besides, we can hear you from here. Just play your part, Dean, and act like you’re asleep.”
There was a lighter weighing heavy in his pocket. He was pacing around Bobby’s place, every once in a while sticking a hand in the pocket to feel the cool metal, thumb it over until it warmed. His plan would work.
Suffice to say he hadn’t expected it when the shower spray hit him again full force, jolting and bracing himself against the tub when it did.
“But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel like this…miscommunication…was at least a little bit my fault.”
Castiel didn’t look pleased. “I thought ‘helping you’ was what made us like this in the first place.”
Dean stares at it, eyes wandering over to Cas after a beat for an explanation. He’s standing on the other side of Jack, now, and catches Dean’s gaze.
“What story?” Cas frowns.
He waits for Cas to continue, rubbing a thumb over the buttons on the remote as the silence stretches. The credits on the TV come to a stop.
Sam had told him—after Dean first showed up and Jack had asked the dreaded question of “Where’s Cas?”—Sam had told him that it was better to keep his distance from Dean for now. That this time was different than the other times.
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed you and—” Dean darts his eyes away, “you and Cas. Whatever’s going on there, it needs to stop.”
parts of him, good and bad. And…you still?” He checks, teasing in his tone from their conversation the night before.
For a moment he thinks that Billie is back. He even jerks a bit to look, when he feels the hold around his heart return. It’s so strong, so tight, that Dean caves forward a bit from the force of it.
, except for that one time they met Sarah all those years ago. He’d had a whole other perspective on paintings after that.
“Why did you give me the keys?”
“Cas. Turn the water off.”
He remembers going back. Going back to the place that was theirs. He remembers how his knees ached after he stood from the ground, how his fingertips felt with the wet of his tears. He remembers relief, he remembers the key sliding into the lock. He remembers Cas withdrawing it. “I heard your prayer.”
“—for you both. How romantic!”
On instinct, Dean reaches out to touch it, hovering his fingers just over the glass. He lifts his gaze to look at Cas.
Dean was already fitted into jeans and a white button-down that had been buried somewhere deep inside his closet. He’d just finished combing his hair through with his fingers, spritzing it with water to get that off-shore look about him.
Dean moves for the door but Sam stands and stops him. “Woah, hang on. We just finished a case, Dean, what’s the rush?”
Cas catches his arm before Dean can withdraw it.
“That’s what who meant?” Jack asks. He’s wearing a party hat, too, with ridiculous stripes of blue and pink and purple patterned onto it. It matches the one currently strapped to Dean’s own. He shakes his head.
Cas stares, waiting for Sam to continue. When he doesn’t, Cas sighs. “What price?”
Dean froze, the hand that was still in his pocket gripped the lighter hard, like a lifeline.
Dean shot a glance at the door, which was still wide open from their barging in. Sam would be back soon from the morgue, and they would still be…
“Just—” Dean sighs. “I know what you want to say. I get it. I’m…”
Distantly, Dean heard himself sob. It was almost like someone else was crying, because he didn’t feel like he was there at all. The floor, the wall he sat against, the fingers in his hair, none of it was real. Just the searing pain in his shoulder; a tether keeping him here. He knew it was the hope that Cas would come back. The fragile, tiny thing living inside him that thought that he
—considered him. Dean knew it by the way that the angel’s eyes raked up and down his body, finally coming to rest on Dean’s face. He felt a shiver go down his spine.
“Long story short, we’re pretty sure it’s Braxxie.”
Cas sighed and reached behind him, shutting the water off.
if my best friend and brother finally got their shit together and lived happily ever after.
“Seriously?” Dean asks. Sam nudges his shoulder, chiding him.
“Don’t worry, Dean, you don’t have to say much, just make casual conversation, ask him his name. It’s mostly my lines, anyway.”
“Yes! Cas reads me a lot of stories before I go to bed, and he told me the tale of the little mermaid. It sounded…familiar,” Jack glances at Sam again, “So I thought it’d be a good idea to see if dressing up would jog my memory.”
And now Dean was left ajar.
‘Cause I’m getting you out of there, you son of a bitch. If it’s the last thing I do.”
Dean just wanted his family back.
. His breath hitches and he backs away, beer forgotten, to hightail it back to his room.
Dean looked up. At some point he had leaned closer, because Cas’ face was
Sam nodded, expression grim. Dean had to make a conscious decision to stop staring at Cas’ chest. No, the
Jack’s gaze cuts across to the rearview mirror, where, if he angles himself right, he can see Dean’s expression.
“You know what,” he smiles. “I think I am.”
“Good,” Dean responds. He tries to ignore how the racing of his heart makes his hands shake. He looks down at the necklace. It swings a little, gently touching his chest.
“Gladly,” Dean says.
After a moment, Cas lets go. He steps back half an inch as if he had forgotten himself. “Just…be careful.”
Dean shakes his head, looking lost. Sam can practically see the gears turning in his head.
that.”
They round the corner into the library, where Dean’s confronted with several large boxes that are set on the nearest table. Scattered around them are various decorations like ornaments, tinsel, and what look to be Santa hats in a few different colors and patterns. Dean’s gaze pulls away from the mess to look at Jack, who has his arms elbow-deep into the box nearest to him. He smiles wide at Dean.
Dean opens his eyes, met with Cas’ blue ones staring down at him intently. Cas withdraws his hand and sits back on his calves, holding onto the paper Jack gave him like his life depended on it. Dean swallows hard.
He looks at Dean, then, and stands a little straighter. “Okay…?”
“He’s…almost at the end of his rope, Jack.” Sam had looked sad, the light in his eyes just barely there, a small flicker that needed tending to. He’d scratched at his face in thought.
Then both hands are fixing the knot, and when Dean is done, he uses the tie as leverage to pull Cas closer. There’s a pause, when both of their noses bump against each other, where Dean gives Cas an out.
Breakfast was hardy and quick, with enough coffee to fuel him for the rest of the day as he skimmed the internet for a possible case. He had the itch, but apparently, looking around at the three sleepy faces around him at the table, no one else did.
“What?” Dean finally asked, a little stressed and more than a little peeved. He remembered clearly how their last conversation here had gone.
“You’re hurt,” Dean noted. He scanned Castiel’s body for where the injury might be, stopping only when the angel spoke.
They stop at a gas station about three hours into the drive. Sam slides out of the passenger seat to fill up the tank. Dean only nods vaguely when Sam says he’s got snacks and drinks covered before slipping into the Gas-N-Sip.
Dean pulls out a Santa hat in the wake of it just being him and Cas in the room and, holding his breath, turns to place it on Cas’ head.
Dean shrugged. “It was incase you didn’t cooperate. Whether or not I light it is still up in the air.” He flicked open the lighter, flipped it back closed.
Dean brings his hands forward to clasp the collar of Cas’ trench coat in his fists. And he doesn’t need a fireplace, he muses. He’s got a hold of the flame.
“Is it…uh, is it Cassandra?”
He’s quiet again. Dean thinks he deserves that, and tries to pay attention to the TV, but the voice in his head is too loud. Cas has to tap his knee to get his attention again.
Sam raises his eyebrows.
Sam recovers from accidentally burning his tongue on his coffee, and coughs out a laugh. “Yeah. No kidding. Glad you don’t have the rose colored glasses on, Cas.”
For a moment amidst the initial confusion at the turn in their conversation, Sam feels his stomach sink. He curses himself and outwardly sighs, shoulders drooping a little as he slowly sits back down.
The essence inside the vial swirls, a bright blue almost the shade of Cas’ eyes. Dean’s entranced, watching as it rhythmically shifts and moves against the glass.
“Well, you…” Dean starts, about to tell him off for the dress shoes and trench coat he’s never seen without, except that Cas isn’t wearing them, he’s…
“But, uh,” he says, “I might have a gift for you.”
“Hate to say this, but I…need your help.”
Because what he had with Cas was the only thing that was real. Because Dean hadn’t—Dean hadn’t told him yet. He hadn’t told Cas that he felt it too, that he felt their bond, damn it—their
The pants Cas was wearing were tight-fitting and black, hugging in all the right places. Cas was barefoot, too, which was a little odd, but Dean figured the whole outfit was already odd enough to be too out of place. When Dean’s eyes travelled up again, he noticed that Cas was wearing a necklace as well, resting against his chest.
believed that having someone die for him was okay? Especially someone who was family? Maybe worse—Dean had almost
“And the stench is in my hair?” Dean would pretend later that his voice hadn’t gone up a few octaves when he said that.
Cave for a
"What I mean to say is, now it'll be easier to get home. You can come and go when you'd like, and you don't have to wait for one of us to let you in."
“Now, wait a minute,” Dean holds up a hand, brain still processing, working over the implications of what Sam just said. “Just how far into this are we going?”
Apart from the clearing they’re in, the place is littered with trees. Dean’s gaze follows the trunks up, until he’s looking at the sky, which is quickly losing light. He thinks he can make out the beginning twinkles of constellations, and when he laughs, a puff of frosty breath obscures them for a moment before fading off.
Dean understands, then. Sam’s
Jack stares at the back of Dean’s head from the back seat of the impala. His expression is stony, Jack has seen it before—eyebrows drawn, lips pursed, eyes cold. It was the look Dean got when he was keeping something in. Or, more likely, keeping something from spilling out.
“Okay,” Dean starts, “How do we want to do this?”
“Familiar,” Cas says. He stares down at Jack with confusion. “Jack, none of us here are mermaids.”
After about an hour straight with no distractions, Dean’s room is half better. It was easier with tunes on, easier to find motivation in the lyrics of
“On time.”
They stayed like that for a moment, faces too close, Dean’s heart racing dramatically.
Dean often forgets that angels don’t sleep.
Dean blinks at him, mouth dry. “What?”
Stunned, Cas takes the necklace and Dean bows his head, feeling his ears go red. It’s a sign of trust, Dean knows, to let your guard down like this in their line of work. It’s like baring your neck to a vampire, or falling asleep next to a djinn.
Rowena raised her eyebrows, clasping her hands together. “Ahh…so, who said it first?”
“As you do.”
“Sure, Dean,” Sam smiles, “It’s for Jack. C’mon, the kid’s
“You—you
His beer bottles, for one. They were always drained before Dean could realize where the alcohol had gone, before he could snap back and see that he’d been sitting in the same spot for hours, staring at nothing and thinking of less.
“Great!” Dean clapped his hands together, rubbing them in anticipation for the food to come. “Then it’s a banquet for three.”
Dean looks at the clock again, more for show than to actually read the time, before redirecting his gaze back to Cas.
When they pull away, Dean’s a little out of breath. He places a hand on Cas’ face, running a thumb over his cheek.
Sam was looking at him with a mix of amusement and disgust.
The soft knock at his door at—he checks his clock—
He remembered the last words he ever heard, the last words that echoed in his mind: “Goodbye, Dean.”
Dean pushed himself up, expecting Cas to move out of the way. But he didn’t, because Cas had no concept of personal space, and then Cas’ hand slipped, and they were a heap on the tub floor.
His trench coat had been abandoned on the toilet lid, along with his suit jacket and tie, which Cas had thrown across the bathroom in his rush to get clean. Dean tries to keep his eyes on Cas’ face, ignoring how Cas’ shirt sticks practically see-through against his chest.
Sam laughed, glancing between Cas and Dean.
“I’ve, uh, I’ve never seen him like this before. Dean—I don’t know how much more he can take. Not with Cas…”
“Hah. No, man. No, Cas doesn’t—
He doesn’t mean to steer the conversation back to angel lore, but somehow they always end up here. Having Cas as his friend is really like having a pocket encyclopedia of all the knowledge in the world, and then some. Once, when Sam had dropped a rhetorical question about shrimp, Cas had started telling him about colors and stupidity, which let down a rabbit hole to figuring out everything Cas knew about sea life. Needless to say, Sam treads carefully from now on.
“So why are we here, again?” Dean asked.
Sam stands again, desperate for Dean to hear him. “Dean.
“Do I even want to know?” Sam asked.
Sam crosses his arms, starting to pace the room a little. “Uh-huh. Well, personally,” he shoots Dean a meaningful look, “I’d be
“No way–”
“Dean thinks we’re together,” Sam finally says for him. He thinks he sees Dean flinch beside him.
, dressed in a blue button-down and a darker blue vest on top, hair mussed so that it looked like he had just gotten out of bed. Jack, beside him, wore a red hoodie and jeans.
His door opens and light from the hallway streams in, bright like the white-hot burn of an angel being killed. Dean blinks once, twice, and there stands his own angel, a hand on the door knob.
—stronger than anything he had ever felt before.
Cas is quiet, so Dean keeps going. "I figured, y'know, without your Grace, you'll be needing to get places and, well, keys...open doors." He mentally curses himself.
"What'd you think?"
Cas' eyebrows twitch at that. "Home," he repeats, but it’s said like a question.
“It’s occurred to me.”
a script!” Dean glares over at Sam, who’s crouched on the other side of the couch. “What are you hiding over there for?”
“No,” he says, “no
Their eyes meet, and Dean reaches between them for the remote.
Time. Broken.
“I just can’t right now,” he finally whispers.
"Thank you, Cas," He says, bringing it close to his heart. Cas smiles.
It’s odd, actually, because Dean is typically the neat freak between the two of them. But last night he’d been moody, and since he hadn’t had his coffee yet, it had carried on through to today, so it seems.
Castiel stared at him, with the gaze of a being that was all-too-powerful. But there was something different, this time. Something…
“He told me you all celebrated it once,” Cas continues, “Along with some other holidays, though I can’t imagine how I managed to miss that. Anyway, he has friends in town that celebrate the christian Christmas, and now he’s got…um,
Dean pulled out the lighter, and Castiel’s squinted eyes fell away from Dean’s to look at it. He stepped back, sliding his foot deliberately over the ring of oil on the floor. Dean considered dropping the flame then, but stopped himself from doing so. It was only a failsafe.
Cas looks down, frowning. “These are my snow boots. Dean got them for me last Christmas.” He shoots Dean a confused glance, as though Dean should be in on this, and Sam was the one acting deluded. Dean can’t really bring himself to care, too busy smiling at the rest of Cas’ outfit.
? Do you want to,” He pauses, his frown deepening. “To go back—?”
Cas takes it from Dean's hand, holding it as if it’s as precious as the necklace Dean is clutching onto for dear life. He levels Dean with a serious stare.
“This is
"I think...I still don't understand. Are you meant to be my George Bailey?"
He failed.
He waits for Dean to finish.
“What’s up with you, anyway?” Sam adds, frowning over at him. Dean’s got his shoe now, and is roughly pulling the laces taught. Then he moves over to his duffle, zipping it up jerkily to fit all the contents inside.
“Jack, I can’t—” Cas starts to say, eyes skimming his lines, but Jack shushes him and goes around to the back of the couch to hide with Sam.
“I’m assuming…
He opens his eyes.
His eyes shot immediately back to Rowena. “Romantic?”
are, huh,
“Thank you,” he whispers. Cas gives a small nod, eyes a little wide. His hands are still at the back of Dean’s neck, fingers brushing gently at the hair on Dean’s nape. Dean shivers, unable to contain it. He brings a hand up to Cas’ tie, holding it a moment, before deciding it could use some adjustment.
They’d gone on a few hunts, since Chuck. It was funny how freedom meant repetition, how the days melted together like a run on sentence. Dean didn’t know where one hunt ended and the other began—vampires became ghosts and witches and back again. He didn’t
. The only thing that was pumping was his heart, twice as fast and without warning. He glanced at Cas–just to make sure he wasn’t the only one confused–and sure enough, Cas was tilting his head at her, eyes narrowed.
Cas nods.
Sam waves his hand around like he’s doing some type of magic. By now, Dean has calmed down enough to huff out a laugh.
First of all, he was
“Krissy?”
Dean stares at him. “What are you talking about?”
Jack frowns. “Don’t what?”

“And that’s why he left. He’d be uncomfortable if you and I were to pursue a—”

Cas was playing with his fingers nervously. “I’m sorry, Dean. That um,” he shakes his head a little, “that went too far.”
There were footsteps, and a dip on the mattress next to him. Dean turns over to see who it is.
Dean’s a little confused, too, looking out at the mountains. Almost every inch is covered with a layer of snow, but by far, the hill they’re standing on has the thickest blanket. Dean’s feet sink into it a little when he shifts his weight, studying their surroundings.
what she meant.”
“Dean,” he says, incredulous. “Dean, you were—you were jealous.”
“Oh,” he says, “I…think I understand now. This was your brother trying to be supportive, I assume. With the…breakfast and the coffee. Because he thought…you and I…”
What he really wants to ask, though, is if they were
“Sorry, Krissy, ah,” he steps off the break to make a left, “I’m actually on my way home right now. Was there something I could help you with?”
He was too preoccupied with the lighter to notice the time flick to 12:00, but Dean couldn’t miss the entrance Castiel made even if he wanted to.
Dean jabbed a finger over his shoulder at Cas. “Hence the bath. We met the mist and the goo. Burns like a son of a bitch.” He waved a hand half-heartedly at Sam.

He knows that’s not what Cas means. He knows…
Dean’s stomach sinks. He nearly tips the couch over with how quickly he looks back over the side. “Do
“Dean is inclined to be clueless,” Sam mumbles, pouring himself a cup. “Coffee?”
Dean instinctively reached out a hand to pull Cas’ fingers away from his eyes on one of these instances, cringing internally at the way they must still be burning.
A silence stretches on for a few seconds before Sam can’t hold it in any longer and breaks out in a fit of laughter. Dean swivels back to him, stunned, and that makes Sam laugh even
Dean feels his heartbeat speed up, looking to Jack for the answer.
“What’s up with
Dean nods, moving to leave again, taking the awkwardness as both a Cas thing and a morning thing and content to leave it at that.
The grip twists, presses harder.
“Hope so,” Dean answers, clearing his throat of its initial roughness. “Still smell like burning metal and sulfur, though.”
A lot felt empty these days.
They all look at Sam, who shrugs and stands up. “Well, time to get this show on the road! Where do you want us, Jack?”
“I have something for you.”
He chuckles, moving towards them to check them out, when Sam urgently pats his shoulder. Dean swivels around, taking in Sam’s confused—but not shocked—expression, and once more tracks his stare to see what he’s looking at.
“Awesome! Did you get what we needed?” He whirled towards Sam so fast he nearly got whiplash, vision blurring for a second before returning to him like ink splotches fading. Sam was holding out the black pouch with a smile.
And he remembers Cas, with Dean’s arm slung around him, the confused look after Dean told him that he’d had fun being with him.
. I’m not commanding you. I’m asking for a favor. It’s–it’s not even for
Dean turns back to Cas, who looks like he wants to say something more than he has ever wanted to in his
“Um,” Dean holds it out to Cas. He waits a moment too long, though, because he can see Cas’ smile beginning to falter. “Do you think you could help me with this?”
Cas leans back as instructed. Dean’s pretty sure the guy can feel the rush of his heartbeat with his back on Dean’s chest like that, but Dean can also feel Cas’ steel grips on his legs, nails digging into his shins.
Dean let out a breath. Thank god for Sam and his perfect timing, even if it was usually perfectly
Dean lets his forehead rest on Cas’, heartbeat still crazy. He closes his eyes. “We can have it, Cas. This. We can have this.”
Cas sighs softly. “My Grace.”
(a classic),
Cas was still wearing his stupid blue shirt and the stupid blue vest and his hair was still ruffled, and Dean was still angry. So he grabbed Cas’ hands to stop him from picking at them, and brought his other hand to Cas’ face like Cas had done to him earlier.
“Of course not.” Jack frowns at him like he should know better. “I charmed it with the spell you taught me. It’ll shut off automatically when it’s done.”
Christmas this year, and all the other holidays, for that matter. Of course…
—exactly are we surrounded by?”
Cas lets his arm relax, lowering it so that the necklace rests between them on the seat cushion of the couch. “You...gave me my humanity, Dean. You showed me how to care about...about everyone. I know I can never repay you for that, but I thought...I thought the least I could do was give a part of myself in return. I—” he hesitates, biting his bottom lip in thought.
Cas smiles this time, fondly annoyed. “Yes, Sam. I still.”
Jack smiles and points at himself, “I’m Sebastian, because he’s my favorite.”
“Hello Sam,” Cas said, water still beating over him. “Your brother is extremely stubborn.”
Somehow, Cas had used a bobby pin to force the door at the last possible moment. He’d said the words. He’d said ‘I love you.’ Cas had

Dean had woken up drenched in sweat, mind racing with the last lingering thoughts of a nightmare. A vamp nest that he and Sam had been hunting, Dean dying in the most
“’Cause you look better in hats? I dunno,” Dean mumbles. He feels his heart racing, chances a glance over to the kitchen where he can hear Sam and Jack clanging baking supplies around while they set up to make the cookies.

“Stay,” Dean says. “Don’t leave my side again. I want—I want you to stay.”
"Keys," Dean says, "One's for Baby, and the other's for the Bunker."
Sam sets the cups down, frowning at Dean, and then at the two plates full of omelettes, hash browns, and bacon, then back to Dean’s hands where they’re untying the apron from around his hips.
Dean lets his eyes close for a moment.

It reverberated in his ears, fast and loud and infuriating. He wished that the gun in his hand could’ve
“That’s different.” He stares at Sam a moment. “Hang on,” Dean points a finger at him, “who did he tell
This is where Sam braces himself a little, hanging on to Cas’ every movement for signs that he might flip on him. But all he does it set down his napkin and shrug.
He got up, abruptly, and stormed out of the Dean Cave without a word, just about done with the shenanigans he’d had to endure for the night. When he got to his room, Dean pushed the door shut with a thud, and flopped onto the bed as if the mattress were a black hole.
“Why?”
Dean’s eyebrows furrow together, and he removes his fingers from where they were pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Yeah, well, he’s an angel,” he says over his shoulder, swinging the door open, “He’ll catch up.”
He remembers Cas, bloody and dying, looking Dean in the eyes when he told him “I love you.” When he dropped his gaze, told everyone else the same.
“—And Jack was curious about how humans celebrate the birth of Christ.”
He and Sam had both come dressed in their usual suits-they-kept-for-fancy-occasions that were now a little too old and tight-fitting in some places. They hadn’t gone
“W-worry?” Dean asks, eyes wide. “Why would I worry?”
, if he was honest—at least his eyes had stopped burning, but Cas continued to rub at his every so often.
, I mean
don’t uh. Swing that way.”
And now he knew why.
“I just…want you to know that you—you’ve always got a room here, Jack. And we…um. We miss you.”
“Jack and I—we were discussing the bible,” Cas starts.
When there’s no immediate answer, Dean’s instincts kick in. He pulls out his gun and gently drops his bag, waiting a moment for his eyes to adjust so he can try for the stairs.
And now Dean had faced the consequences. He sat, head in his hands, his shoulder burning. The pain wasn’t physical, but it was
possible scenario.
Cas lifts it again in offering, and Dean moves his hand to fit the vial against his palm. It's warm to the touch. Dean wraps his fingers around it, and Cas lets go of the chain. It falls limply against Dean's knuckles.
There’s a cool rush of air as the door stays open, and then Dean seems to remember himself and he shuts it, turning around.
Dean thinks.
Dean directed his gaze back down at Cas’ hand, abruptly letting go.
He sucks in a breath, steeling himself for it, and pushes himself off of the door and towards the first pile.
“Okay, uh, you’re gonna have to lean back once we kick off, alright?” Dean instructs, trying to remember how to do this.
Cas shakes his head, leaning back against the counter. “How so?”
“Dean?” Jack asks. Dean meets his eyes in the mirror.
that Dean has to force down a chuckle.
Sam smirks, finishing with the buttons on his black button-up and finally turning to him to answer. “Guess you’ll find out.”
“Uh…come again?”
When it does, Dean’s scrunched features smooth out into a countenance of carefully crafted neutrality. Sam nearly rolls his eyes.
Sam takes that as Dean’s way of saying to make himself a cup, so he tentatively walks to the cupboards to retrieve a couple of mugs to drink from.
He moves so that he lays flat on the couch, fighting his own lungs to keep his breathing even. He glances at Cas once, gaging from his slightly panicked expression that Cas had reservations about doing this as well, before closing his eyes and letting Cas take the wheel on this one.
“Don’t be a dick. Seriously, dude. What is up with you lately?”
Dean would never live it down if Sam found him like this. But of course, luck was not on his side today.
, alright? That’s—that’s gift enough to last me a lifetime. Don’t worry about a gift.”
“There. Now you have legs. Go find your prince.”
, but that wasn’t even the worst part of it.
“Let’s race,” Sam says. He can feel him staring and avoids Sam’s gaze. He’ll blame the tint on his cheeks and ears on the cold, if Sam ever asks.
“Jack–” Cas protests, but Jack’s already dragging him over to the couch and plopping him down next to Dean.
“Is he…dead?” Cas asks. Dean resists the urge to open his eyes at that, smiling a little instead. This was ridiculous.
“It’s four in the morning, Cas.”
“That’s not true,” Cas frowns, “You are very attractive for someone of your gender and age.”
“No.”
“Jesus, Cas. By now you have to know you aren’t just ‘anyone.’ You’re—” He swallows. They stare at each other, and Dean falters.
“Oh. Yes, my…My rank requires I wear certain, ah,
He lets out a shaky breath.
“Did you…find anything?”
“It’s quiet,” Cas says, breaking eye contact first. The fire—quickly fading into the recesses of the grave—is the only source of light. It colors Cas a warm yellow-orange that Dean thinks is strangely inviting. If Cas was a fire, then Dean would gladly be a furnace.
, in worn, dirty clothes. And Dean remembers that he hadn’t been happier to see anyone before—not in a place like that. Not after looking for so long.
“Where are you going?” Sam asks, “It’s five in the morning.”
something, could’ve killed Chuck with a simple pull of the trigger.
Dean feels his heart racing, thrumming against his chest so fast it makes him lightheaded. He simply nods, not trusting himself to speak, and watches as Cas pulls out the chain of a necklace until it reveals a small glowing vial that hangs off of it.
Dean chuckles, pulling lightly in an attempt to get out of Cas’ grip. Cas tightens his hold by a fraction.
Cas looks over at the plates Dean had prepared, which are no longer steaming, and the two abandoned mugs on the counter.
“I believe he said that you are the prince,” Cas responds, eyes studying the ground. “And…”
Dean breathes out a gentle laugh. “Both, Cas,” he says. “It was both.”
. He took it with him to the Empty, it was swallowed by black inky tendrils along with the rest of him.
Dean watches Cas slip the beanie on, losing his breath a little at the sight. The thought occurs to him—when he’s looking long enough to notice Cas’ red nose and ears and cheeks—that angels don’t usually get cold.

“There…wasn’t…” he flicked his gaze to Dean, almost nervously, and then back to Rowena. Cas set his jaw. “You’re mistaken.”
“Hey, kid! Long time no call. How are you? Everything okay?”
He laces an arm around Cas’ chest, pressing him closer. “I’ve got you!” he reminds him.
“It’s your birthday, dumbass,” Sam says, swooping forward to slap a party hat on Dean’s head as soon as he’s made the landing. He smiles.

was lost somewhere along that path of discovery.
Dean looked at Cas, suddenly aware of how their shoulders were touching just barely. He leaned away a little, feeling warmth spread up his neck and to his ears.
Cas shrugs, but Dean takes it as a yes, to move the story along. Of course, he already knows what it is, but he might as well humor the kid some more while he’s already here.
Cas lets go of his wrist, backing away a little. “You are welcome.”
He thinks Cas might take a crack at him again, indulge him that angels don’t have halos or harps or whatever Dean had said, but he doesn’t. He watches Dean for a long moment, all the while Dean pointedly tries not to notice, flipping channels for something else to watch.
“Back later.”
“Well this is one of those times. You said romance isn’t the only kind of relationship there is. You meant
“You wished to meet. So I am here. Speak.”
Dean shakes his head, putting the pan that had just housed the hash browns back on the stove. He wipes his hands on his apron and gives Sam a quick smile.
, and you’re not even watching?” Dean asks, heart hammering in his chest.
“What’s this?” Cas asks.
, and hearing Sam talk to their kid like that was like a taking a blow to the head.
, ah, I want you to know something.”
“I want you to know that the thing—what you thought you couldn’t have…you were wrong about that. Because Cas, you—” he stops, shakes his head a little to keep his voice steady for this. He needs to say it.
Dean feels himself begin to smile, mindful of the road ahead of him. He balances his phone on his thigh while he drives.
. Dean thanks Jack, at least, that it was up to Dean to lead their fake date, instead of Cas with his frankly horrible improv skills.
“We don’t even have the tree up yet,” Dean grumbles in feigned annoyance. “Hell, we don’t even
“He went to go return those books we borrowed, remember? He won’t be back for another twenty minutes.”
Dean sits frozen to the spot, something like ice making a chill run down his spine and cool his blood.
“Jack, you can’t ask Dean to–” Cas tries.
“Oh,” Sam shrugs, feigning innocence, “you should probably tell him that, then.”
Sam’s got one foot out when Dean pipes up again.
, because Cas had told them not to, but obviously Cas wasn’t being held to the same standard as they were.
“I know it’s Christmas Eve, and that’s not typically when gifts are given... I also know that there’s probably a whole ritual that has rules and I’m sure you’re very picky about them, but I still...I don’t know if this will count as a present. But I still want to give it to you, if you’ll accept it,” Cas says.
“No,” he breathes. It wasn’t. He’d never wanted that.
Cas frowns at Sam. “Sam was certain. I can’t imagine he’d get the day wrong, but he has had quite severe brain trauma over the years. Perhaps…” Cas reaches out to Sam’s head, probably intent on searching his brain for said trauma, or for the date of Dean’s actual birthday. Sam swats his hand away.
Dean should probably say something.
“Come again?”
“An angel trap? That was the best you could do?”
Dean sighs. Sounds easy enough.
Dean swallows. “Nah. I’ll hang on to you.”
When Dean lets the space be filled with quiet, Jack takes it as a sign to continue.
“Ariel! That was a bad idea! But I will help you go to land because I am your friend. Let’s go!” Jack grabs Cas’ hand over the couch and drags him to go hide with himself and Sam. A few moments later, just when Dean is about to ask what the hell he should be doing, Cas reappears back on the couch.
The music had stopped playing a while ago. It was quiet now.
Dean stared at her, any comment he might have made completely wiped clean from his mind, like Spock in
And he knows, dazedly, that it's likely the latter, even if a lifetime was lived in this moment alone. Dean pulls back to stare at Cas like he just hung the stars rather than some simple plastic ornaments on a dingy fake Christmas tree, holding his breath as he gages Cas' reaction.
“You have a beautiful voice, Ariel. If you want to go on land, then I want to take your voice. Hand it over,” Sam outstretches his hand towards Cas who, frowning down at it, makes a motion over his throat, like he’s extracting his voice to give to Sam. Dean thinks the gesture is oddly familiar.
“Are we really doing this?”
Dean swallows to keep from choking, or potentially crashing the car.
“Stay still,” Cas grumbled, on all fours now. He loomed over Dean, trapping Dean’s legs between his and blocking most of the water with his back.
Dean swallows hard, face warm. “Yeah?” His voice comes out higher than intended, so he clears his throat before speaking again. “Thanks.”
shoe, dumbass,” he says, swiping it from Dean before he can try putting it on. Sam snickers, moving to the bed to finish pulling his socks on and getting dressed while Dean grumbles and looks for his missing shoe.
“Yes,” Cas says quickly. “I accept.”
of the snow hitting the ground startles Dean out of his thoughts.
“This is the perfect time,” Jack starts to say, “to make a move! Eric, you should kiss her, and give her her voice back!”
Sam blinks a few times, lets out an awkward cough that says he doesn’t know how exactly to respond to that. It’s nice, hearing that someone cares about his brother the way that he deserves, but at the same time it’s so sickeningly sweet that he thinks for a second that his just-digested salad might be making a reappearance.
“This…’quiet,’” Cas starts. He’s looking down at his knees, frowning. “That’s—is that what you want?”
“Hello?”
Jack’s smile is back as he pulls out an ornament. “Christmas! I thought we’d decorate.”
“Yeah, and who exactly did you make us dress up as?” Dean adds on. He looks around at all of them, trying to reign in his distant, foggy memory of the one time he’d gotten a glimpse of the movie.
“Your gift to me?” Dean manages, smile wobbly. He’s teasing, trying to bring down the weight of this without getting rid of all of it. He likes this type of adrenaline rush, different from any hunt he’s been on. Better.
He thinks maybe that it’s broken, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the amount of times it’s smashed into things on hunts. He sighs at the irony.
“So, you two…aren’t…?”
Cas tilts his head at him, an obvious question.
They were in hell. Again.
“Prove it,” Sam responds, and then he’s pushing off and leaving them in the dust.
He could feel Cas watching him, but Dean was pointedly looking away.
“Cas...what is this?”
Dean follows him around to the nearest tree, which is far enough away that Jack and Cas probably won’t hear them over their own conversation (Dean thinks he hears something about hot chocolate) if they talk quietly enough.
A tense beat. Dean considered the grooves on the floor, barely making them out under the moonlight.
Sam rolls his eyes, “Well I’m not going to
“What?” he asked.
“You’re awake! Hey—is-is that…my candy bar?”
”I can’t do this without you. Never could, never will. Not since you touched me in hell, when you saw me broken and put me back together again. Cas, it’s—it’s always been you. I’m sorry I couldn’t say it before, I’m sorry it took this long. I hope you can forgive me, and," Dean grips his hand into a fist, "I hope my plan works.
“Yeah, but,” he continues, trying not to grimace, “have you considered that… Dean’s an idiot?”
“Don’t. They probably still have that goo all over them. Let me see.”
When they pulled away, Cas was looking at him with what looked like confusion and worry. Dean tilted his head.
Cas shakes his head slightly, still confused, and then abruptly stills.

“Move, I’m trying to do my walk of shame here to the nearest set of clean clothes.”
“You’re here more for me than anything else. I don’t–” He looked back at them. “I don’t particularly like them either. But if I had declined the invitation, there’d be a bounty on my head, and we all know how that goes. There are already so few of us. It’s…better to be in good graces.”
before. You can’t blame me for being uneasy.”
Cas takes Dean’s face in his hands, lifts it a little to bring them face to face again, so that he’s looking into Dean’s eyes.
“Yeah, I know. And lucky for you,
“But, that is not the only kind of relationship there is,” Cas amends.
Sam peeks his head over the back of the couch. “Well, I’m not in this scene. I wasn’t there when you—I mean,
Sam blinks, realization sinking in. “Oh. Wait. Hang on a second—”
“Oh, yeah,” Sam says, “I forgot one of my lines, earlier. Uh, the only way Ariel can break the spell and get her voice back is if Eric kisses her.”
“What?” He jokes, “You’re telling me you don’t wanna see those two sled? It’s not for
Dean, feeling strangely defensive, mutters, “Up yours,” and rifles through the box for something to fling at him. He comes up short, but Jack rids them of Sam as he bounds off to meet him in the kitchen, giddy to start on their baking as soon as possible.
"Are these...?"
Cas reaches into a pocket, keeping his hand there while he thinks of how to proceed.
He pulls the sleds apart, placing them each by the hill’s edge, but not so close that sitting on them would be enough to send them flying down the slope.
“Uh…wow, Cas. What’s with the get up?” Sam asked, obviously teasing. He nudged Cas’ shoulder—the one without the cape—a little in jest and looked over at Dean to join in, but Dean wasn’t paying attention. His eyes had fallen to Cas’ legs.
He sighed and dropped the lighter back in his pocket. Heavy.
They’re closer than he thought.
Dean looks down into the grave, feeling the heat lick his chin and cheeks warm. Across from him, on the other side, stands Cas with his hands in his pockets.
Dean put the bottle of holy oil back where it came from, wiping his hands against his jeans to clean them of the residue.
“Uh…guys? What are…you…”
before anyone else does.
“Hold on, were you two,” Dean glances between both of them, “Were you two plotting something?”
Before he can, though, the lights kick back on. His gaze locks onto the scene below, and Dean slowly lowers his gun.
There’s another rush of cold air when Cas opens the door to get in, but he shuts it firmly before a shiver can get a hold of Dean’s spine again. Baby roars to life, the familiar rattle that comes with the wave of heat from her vents does a good job of filling the silence.
You knew it was a cold December when even the angel shivered.
tell you for sure that—me and him? Nothing going on there, man. You’ve got nothing to worry about.”
He brought Cas’ hand close, inspecting underneath his fingernails and between crevices for any of the black liquid they’d encountered. Cas’ hands were surprisingly…soft. Dean turned his wrist so that Cas’ palm faced up, frowning a little as he stroked his thumb across it.
