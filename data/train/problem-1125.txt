"Not helpful."
For a few moments, there was quiet, and then Sherlock said softly, "The transport is not supposed to fail. Not like this. External forces, maybe. But not ... just decaying."
He wriggles onto his side, biding his time, cozy under the thoughtfully provided blanket. His mind centers, focuses:
The Airbnb John had reserved was easily accessed, located a few blocks off the main street of the small town, chosen intentionally to be out of the way and obscure, within reason. John had selected it for the location, the amenities, and the proximity to a few restaurants, cafes, and a limited option of walking-distanced night clubs and bars if they chose. They'd barely set their bags and coats down inside the door and cast a quick glance around the simple but elegant cottage, before John pressed against Sherlock, advancing on him with a growl. "I think it's your turn to be just a little bit frustrated. Aroused. Hard. Teased." Firm lips, teeth, tongue, angled jaws, insistent hands - John leveraged it all along with the faintest appreciative grumble deep in his throat. The pent-up energy between them grew until John summoned his inner strength and stepped back. His eyes again bore into Sherlock's. "Take off your clothes." He didn't wait, but locked the door, assured himself that the blinds and curtains were drawn enough to ensure their privacy, and took the food into the kitchen. As promised, the refrigerator was somewhat stocked, and he added to it. Sherlock was still watching him when he glanced over his shoulder. "All of them. What are you waiting for?"
Thank you for your service, and I hope that despite the challenges, your living arrangement will continue to meet your needs.
"Not especially, but it would be nice if there's an opening to take it. Anaesthesia is always present to manage the sedation. And I know they always prefer to do the study when there's a stable airway already in place." Dawn sees that John is not enthusiastic. "They come right here to his room, he won't have to travel anywhere else. She's a nice lady, the cardiologist, and if you're interested, we can ask if you can stay in the room, as long as you stay out of the way. Watch the whole thing. She'd probably be agreeable."
"Getting a train wreck across the hall. You'll go up with Ellie and Jenn. Still on a heart monitor of course. Not much else is actually going to change." She unclips the hard wire heart monitor, connects it to the transport telemetry pack. "Better view. Eh," and she giggles, makes a 'so-so' gesture, "I mean, you have to manage without me, but the nurses there are great, much nicer digs."
Sherlock's eyes flick to John's. "Will you be here when I ...?"
His brain engages along with his cynicism. "I'm sure I won't
As expected, John takes them into the kitchen, where he drowns and bins them.
"Sleeping is boring. Almost as boring as that movie." He was standing at John's feet, looking down. "Clearly you felt the same."
"Generous."
His chest ached by the time the retching had passed, and the nurse brought him medication that hadn't helped yet but there was little else to try. By the time the med had been slowly given into his IV, several other people were at the door. One of them sported a blue-badged uniform and held the hand of a small, familiar - very familiar - boy. Their silhouettes in the door frame, backlit, were oddly juxtaposed - one stocky adult, one slim child.
"Perfect. You make the decision, I'm sure I'll love it."
"No."
With an impressed nod, an inhale of being caught off guard, Sherlock read quickly. "An executed agreement of sale for this place. I suppose that answers that, then." Just the other evening, they'd been discussing what their futures, their retirement options, might look like. Sherlock considered now, slightly unhappily, that he'd been set up. And unaware. "Interesting," he noted, with a tilt of his head. "I'm impressed."
Squint as much as necessary as you ignore the "fiction" of whatever medical programme John was in as well as the length of time covered in this chapter. Yes, I know, probably four years and then a fellowship, but ... I don't know, let's just invoke the omnipotence of either Mycroft or fanfiction and press onward, shall we?
"Sherlock. You're not going to die. And writing a will is ..."
is securely in place, the comfortable cut and size again looking ... right. Acceptable. Complete. "Oh, I'm glad to see that."
John nods, feeling the isolation again as his contact, his 'back-stage' escort dons a surgical mask then proceeds into the procedure room. John takes a step back, silent, grateful to be this close rather than in the waiting room, worrying and wondering. He can see almost nothing of Sherlock except that there is most assuredly a patient on the procedure table and that people are clustered around him, working in there. He knows that Sherlock's head is at the end closest to the ventilator, and that there is equipment and a plethora of monitors and John hopes he is blissfully unaware. He hopes a lot of things on Sherlock's behalf.
No more than five seconds elapsed before Lydia was answering Mycroft's ring on her mobile. She had not yet gone upstairs to bed, but moved away from the hallway to be sure as not to disturb Rosie. Rather than a typical greeting, she didn't waste a moment on banal pleasantries, mince words, nor try to sugarcoat anything. "You should know better than to request details via unsecured text message."
"It's not like that. It's not necessary."
"Swear to god, I'll throw myself out the window if you finish that sentence."
"Yes."
The warmth and the comfort of being home coupled with poor sleep the night before had John drifting off. He awakened when Sherlock moved, shifting and attempting to disengage without discovery, without disturbing him. "Hmm, you okay?" he murmured.
"All right?" John fights every urge he has to get in Sherlock's face, to talk to him, to ask questions, to interact with him. To possibly place his lips on Sherlock's temple. Or the back of the hand he's been holding the past days. But he directs the question to the nurse, knowing that to talk with Sherlock is presently counter-productive and would have him expend more energy on non-essentials. Breathing for the moment is his highest priority.
"Wait." John takes one slow step toward the door, and another.
Sherlock hadn't returned.
"Mmmmm," Sherlock moans the response, quietly, deep in his throat, turns his head toward John, leaning in. It is reflexive, as he seeks
The confession was a hard one, and John knew the honesty had cost him. Slowly, quietly, he toed off his shoe again and tucked it on the foot of the mattress atop the covers, adjacent to Sherlock's foot. Neither mentioned it although Sherlock's gaze met and held John's again. John whispered back, "I know. Stay anyway."
"Retired, anyway."
The one hand that remained moved until only two of her fingers remained on the neck of the microscope.
"No. You mustn't leave me alone with him."
He settles back against the chair, tries to relax his shoulders, and gives her what he hopes is an encouraging smile as he sits back. And finds his words, then. "Not nearly long enough."
He feels his face relax, his shoulders, remembering. "Yes. She was there, and doing well. I've always loved how she ... She's quite the cuddler. So, well, yes. Read her a couple of books, settled her in at home again."
"Fractured fibula, non-displaced, no internal fixation was needed after a simple reduction. Leg'll get casted once the fasciotomies heal enough." John looked up at the plural form of the word with enough surprise on his face that the physician noticed, clarified. "We added a medial fasciotomy to the lateral that was done pre hospital. Was that your doing?" He pointed toward Sherlock's left leg, where at present it was wrapped in elastic bandages, elevated on a single thin pillows, and surrounded by several white, blue-clipped ice packs.
Ryan had been one of the corpsmen in his unit, a hard worker, known and loved by everyone. He'd had his own struggles with mental health, living large, living loud, who occasionally alternated with bouts of down days, of depression. They'd ended up shipping him out of the combat zone, and John'd lost touch. The obituary vaguely cited his inner battle with depression, made a reference to a car accident, and asked for donations in his honour to the Wounded Warrior Project.
"Concussion." Sherlock had echoed the word from the treating A&E doc, hating himself as soon as he'd done it. "Okay, then." He paced a few steps outside John's darkened room. "How much longer until I can bring him home?"
"No. You heard correctly." His medical advisor, the upper level medical man he turned to for guidance was clear. "He's required intubation, you said." The contact on the other end knew all of Mycroft's communication preferences, knew not to mince words, knew not to sugar coat anything. "As they'd explained to you before, the hope was that he would rally, that the medications would be effective, that his condition would not deteriorate."
Text messages from long ago, an errant memory, sent between men much younger.
], mRNA design is not. It has been out for years, studied, researched, and in truth, it was absolutely divine providence that the technology was in place when this pandemic struck. It makes development, production, distribution, and effectiveness so much easier because of it. I understand that some people feel "I just can't risk it," and for some, that might be true on a personal level. But in no instance is it okay to take anyone's freedom of choice away. And because this is my blog, I refuse to let it be a debate that gets nasty. Truth and medical facts are really not up for that kind of argument. Discussion, of course. Know that when you attack and insult my readers like you did - really, Harr, what are you, thirteen again? - it is not okay. It's downright rude.
Sherlock scoffed. "Ridiculous." John raised a displeased eyebrow, waiting patiently for Sherlock to look back up at him. "Well, it is. Mostly, for a new vaccine like this that hasn't made it through all the trials, all of this," he tapped at the Vaccine Information Sheet, "is going to be every iteration of saying we don't know, we have no idea, further testing is necessary, or no data is available."
Mycroft laughed at her blunt sense of humour. "Thank you very much." Lydia wasn't sure how to handle that statement, so Mycroft continued to fill the quietness. "For your intuition and your attention to all of them."
, John doesn't say. He does, however, watch the adjustment to the IV medication be an abject failure. No sooner do a few minutes pass after the fractional dose reduction when Sherlock's heart rate skyrockets, along with his respiratory rate. His limbs, although the movements were somewhat jerky and twitchy, escalate as well.
I remember when he started school, how big a deal it was to choose sympathetic teachers and worry about translators in the beginning and be concerned about how other people were treating him. I remember him playing football and being really amazing at it. Travel club and being sought after by some of the coaches. Gosh he could run fast. I remember when he started getting interested in the legal profession, and then specifically in immigration law, and in a little bit of government. I know our Uncle Mycroft has said that only someone with Sam's unique background and skill set could even think to combine all of these passions with the effectiveness and the potential to make such a huge impact on people who need help. The language, the birth place, the command of English and the education he's had, have him poised for greatness. I probably wasn't supposed to say any of that either. Sorry not sorry.
Sameer, Sherlock took note, just lay quietly as the nurse cued John through a few basic orientation questions, a request for him to rate his headache pain, and an offer to use the toilet if needed.
Sighing, John turned so that he was on his side, a hand coming out to rest over Sherlock's ribs, and a few turns later, John's back was pressed against Sherlock's front, arms loosely clasped, the touch of a thigh, the press of a muscled calf. Comfortably warm body heat radiated between them.
Her eyes actually light up and she giggles. "Bring it on, then."
"Before you go for the procedure, we'll have you use the loo, brush your teeth if you want, and you'll be taken over on a stretcher."
"Oh god," Sherlock breathed, an exhaled whisper of actual shock. There were a million questions, how did he get there, had he nicked an Oyster card, or walked? Did the hospital staff try to stop him, why didn't John himself call? How long did it take him, was he crying, how did Sherlock manage to miss the noise let alone the intent of him leaving? "Is he ... are they ...?"
He squelches it, keeping his face neutral as the doctor continues. The science, the explanation, the reasons, all make perfect sense. John just hadn't realised it.
"About eighty, eighty-five percent."
In an attempt to clear the obvious fog of sedation, Sherlock blinked a few times, slowly. "No, actually, I'm fine. Take me home now."
Greg's grin is then knowing and he laughs. "Yep. Nice new jewellery, there, mates. Titanium, is it?"
Dr. Benton tries to smile, but there is a seriousness that is impossible to miss, as he says, "This is not up to you."
Cool blue eyes stared back at him. Silent, daring, challenging.
"No, not surprised."
"You usually like blood spatter."
"... and it does feel like going to bed is about the most normal thing we do."
Sherlock blinked, looked away, and exhaled. The internal wrestling continued, until Sherlock let out another faint sigh. "I hate this."
deep vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis with complications,
"Yeah, she did."
It was not easy, although John nearly made it so.
"Do you have thoughts of lodging? We'll be shipping you back to England next week."
The light was coming stronger from a different direction when he managed to open his eyes next, and he blinked clarity into some dingy windows, dirty lino, the same deserted empty room. His shoes had done a runner. The mobile, a burner pre-paid deal he'd managed to acquire, was also missing. And the remainder of whatever else had been in his pockets.
"You going to make me leave? Med school student with excellent grades, considering a stint in the military to pay off your education, rugby captain such as yourself, you're not actually cruel enough to send anyone out in this weather."
Over bright, tear-filled eyes, the patient nodded. "Thank you all so much!" His voice trembled with emotion, with the meaningful lyrics, and at the knowledge that he had pressed on hard, done difficult things, soldiered through the discomfort, and beaten this damned virus.
"Can I have Sam's too?"
"Close your eyes and I'll kiss you ..."
"Clever wit," Sherlock finished for him. "Mine, anyway."
I absolutely do not advocate bringing in alcohol for patients. I do cautiously advocate for the occasional rule breaking provided there is no harm.
I'm only partly kidding. The true fundraiser will be how much both of my dads are going to chip in to buy and keep my silence.
John clears his throat, and it is a threatening sort of attention-grabbing noise. "All we're asking here," he begins, and it is a calm tone with a sharp edge of don't mess with me underneath, "is that you perhaps make a phone call, explain things." Owlish blinks happen back at him, and John smiles with a coolness. "For all Mr. Holmes has been through, I really don't think it's too much to ask, do you?"
The toes on his calf wriggle slightly on their quest for the extra-warm spot behind John's knee and there the movement ceases. But only for a moment before there is some movement on the mattress and the air behind him, the space between them gets a little warmer as Sherlock moves close, closer.
Sherlock cuts a look in his direction, amused and quite aware of the change of the conversation. He tips his head back again and his eyes drift closed, but there is a hint of spark there, a small bit of satisfaction -
"So now this is all about
"So I can stay up later now, find something to talk about, go to bed later ...?" He was trying hard to be serious, but the giggles overtook him as he considered how much trouble John already had getting Rosie to bed some evenings, and that Sherlock often had bizarre sleep habits. John worked hard not to make it a battle most of the time, but it did seem that everyone's sleep patterns had some peculiarities already.
"Holmes?" John does not issue a challenge at all, simply wants to confirm that he's closer than he's been.
"I'll be back in the morning to enter your discharge orders -"
In the silence, she must have realised it on her own and her expression went from somewhat teasing to pained. "You're serious?" Her gaze fell to John, who nodded, knowing his face was sad, knowing that he was disappointing her, knowing that it was for her own protection. "What about Rosie?"
The eyes are still watching him when he checks again, and although the anaesthesia apparatus obscures some of his vision, the comforting competence of the eyes stay on him.
"Wishing is a futile waste of time." There was a faint huffing as John exhaled in frustration, in lingering self-flagellation. Sherlock's fingers tapped against John's temple. "I left scars on you too, you know." Without conscious effort, John's arms tightened comfortably, securely, fingers splayed and skin in close connection from shoulder to toes. Their skin, bodies, limbs, and breathing wove together. "And sometimes," Sherlock continued, his voice in a low, raspy register, "those invisible scars are just as bad, if not worse."
Until John Watson. Or well, almost. Although a relapse had occurred when John had been ... distracted, now that it seemed John was present in every sense, Mycroft had worried less.
"It's largely due to you. I can't even begin to say how much I appreciate --" He hears the tremble in his voice, clears his throat, finishes with "-- all of this." Tipping his head in her direction and hearing her tactful, gentle acknowledgement, he gathers his things, showers, and lays in bed for a little while acutely aware of his mobile, the flat, the desire that, despite his fatigue, he is looking forward to being back at the hospital.
"How was your night? They behaved?" John asked, keeping his voice low.
Sherlock made a face, as if entertaining a foreign idea, then he launched on the snippy again. "You're not going to be all bored and annoying during the concert, are you?"
It is sometimes an unlikely relationship and an unusual combination of instinct and empathy on the part of the caregiver.
"Why you shouldn't what?" It could actually have been several serious options - overdose, otherwise use, jump, cut, hurt someone, attempt self-harm - so John sought more information.
Although it could have been particularly critical and frightening, John's training spurs him to action without really needing to make a plan in advance. It keeps him calm. Which keeps Sherlock calm.
The words, whispers, Sherlock's eyes had been bright and laser-sharp focus.
The words settled, and a faint chuckle ruminated in Sherlock's chest as he considered the unintentional double entendre, and John followed, with a growling, "Oh, I'm bloody sure we can think of something." He rolled, his arm encircling Sherlock's waist, unrushed, his chest pressing up lightly against Sherlock's back as he wriggled in behind him. "Unless you'd rather just ... take a nap or something."
The day is cold, rainy, and full of little irritants. Although Sherlock forgoes the oxygen much of the time, he is aggravated by the ongoing sensation of being winded. His oxygen levels remain okay, and both John and Sherlock find that they check less often as time passes. It is more the physiologic feeling than actual physical symptoms, and of course, is worse with activity such as climbing the steps.
"Suit yourself." John raised a brow as he shook the tissues at Sherlock's mouth again. "But vomiting up the blood you're swallowing doesn't sound like a good time either."
Bits and snippets of some of the discussions trickles into the room or via the intercom between the team and the tech who is recording, monitoring, and assisting from the control room with replays and camera viewpoints.  "... pressure's up again, let's do a squirt of nitro ...  fluoro on ... he's wriggling, let's give twenty-five mics of fentanyl, and go up on the propofol ... hold that ...  can you reshoot that last run-off? ..."  There is discussion between Dr. Steinberg and the interventional radiologist about the actual stent specifics. They are being quite careful, John observes, to choose the right diameter, the right length, and the right location.
That demand, John thinks can be arranged. "In the morning, okay." Watching Sherlock breathe, John is quite aware of how comfortable his own breathing is, the deep breath, the lack of pain, the satisfactory oxygenation, the relaxed inhale/exhale pattern. The involuntary reflex complete taken for granted until ... until it isn't. Sherlock's is the opposite - he is tight, laboured, and air hungry.
The pharmacy tech nodded and as she scanned the list, she took a slight lean backwards, then looked up with a little concern in her eyes over both of their masked lower faces. "This stuff for you?"
I'm also not necessarily recommending that anyone should just assume it's okay to spend the night in a patient room without permission. Though I do think in most cases there are benefits for patients and families.
"I was gone for like, five minutes. This couldn't wait?"
"See you tomorrow?"
Exploring, studying, enjoying the solitude were things he liked. The home, very comfortable, tasks, minimal. Lights, making the place looked lived in, checking on the outbuildings, typical security things, assuring windows and doors were locked, easy. And with school demands, things to learn, read, memorise, he had plenty of time on his hands. As with any new assignment, he found that the house had sounds of its own, with creaking boards, roof noise, shifting in the upstairs. Now and again, he found, one of the showers must have an intermittent leak, as he found that the base of it was wet and at one moment he thought he heard water running while he was washing up his own few dishes in the sink. And one time he arrived home from a class to find that the upstairs almost seemed humid with the faint scent of shampoo lingering about a bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
He feels his own pulse loud in his ears, thinking about what the day still holds, for both of them, but Sherlock especially. Breathing tube, sedation, laying flat, medications, restraints, monitoring, possibly now an additional procedure.
"True." He agreed with her, and most assuredly could have elaborated, the worry, the stress, the way he'd become more of a rock for John, supportive in ways he'd never really paid attention to previously. Things had changed for them in their little world. For everyone. His silence, though, was still and understanding too.
"I hope so. He's in for a long journey."
So the NIHSS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, is the gold standard in the US to objectively quantify neurological assessment. By experienced providers, it probably takes between 5-10 minutes to perform. The doctor here does an abridged version, which in my opinion is acceptable, given the fact that both she and the nurse knew the patient well. There is a level of professional respect that each trusted the other regarding their own findings. The NIHSS is apparently used internationally, but I was unable to determine if this is broadly used by NHS providers.
, remember?"
"I was a busy doctor. A surgeon."
"So do you have any questions?" It is Dr. Benson standing at the bedside, having reviewed the discharge instructions.
"I don't really see it that way, you know."
With no trace of Sherlock at all, except that his coat and his cane were gone but his powered-off mobile was on the kitchen table. John didn't pay it too much mind, other than having it feel different, his being gone, as he heated up and ate some leftover takeaway from the refrigerator. The flat felt lonely and empty when he went to bed, but it wasn't until the next morning when John was readying for work that it changed to alarm.
Frowning, John hesitated, turning Sherlock's words about. Plans? Warily, he then replied, "What do you mean? I'm not planning on going anywhere. Unless you ..." The epiphany struck hard - Sherlock's tone, his non-verbal body language, connecting dots and jumping to the worst case scenario in his mind. "Oh god, that's it, isn't it? You want us, Rosie and I, to move out, don't you. You wanted to talk to me about it while she was away, give us time to plan ..." He recalled what he'd thought
The shoe selection had been overwhelming, and Sameer had tried on a few pairs, but each time John asked if he liked them, if those were the ones they should buy, he would hesitate, and then slowly shake his head no.
"Idiots," Sherlock echoed. "Let's be wise, then, in our own little haven, here with Rosie. Ride it out here."
Sam pursed his lips, keeping his eyes downcast, but didn't say anything.
, John thought, but while he was mustering his courage, Sherlock spoke up again. "You know, the house is right there, up around that street. I don't know when we'll get this opportunity again. And now, I'm not going to ask you again. So make your choice carefully. What is it?" Sherlock shrugged, hoping his casual dismissal would loosen John's tongue. "Or not, makes no difference to me." He took one step slowly toward the house.
"Notice I'm not laughing."
Greg tilted his head. "What do you mean? I thought you were to be bringing him out to me."
"Physician, yes I know. But discharge after a procedure still requires a little bit of monitoring here, hence the heart monitor and such." She gestured to it, took in the stable vital signs. "And most important, you'll start that dose of the new blood thinner, be observed overnight. I'll send you off in the morning with that prescription. Stroke risk reduction, remember?" Sherlock made an impatient gesture, as if to spur her to continue. "Have you eaten anything yet?"
"I get bored."
"I'm a little young for ... heart problems."
I remember him right in my face, his bright eyes and his worry lines and him holding my hand. And touching my shoulder. It didn't occur to me until later that I recognised the touch. It was familiar because he'd probably been doing it for a while. He was probably explaining things and nothing was processing. But he was there and I vividly recall thinking we were both dead.
"I'm not sure. One day at a time, yeah?"
"I felt it again. Not quite like before, but ... fluttering?"
TW:  dark themes, dark thoughts, thinking about suicide.  Please proceed carefully if these may be upsetting for you.  But I do promise you that it will be okay, they will be okay, and there are times for all of us that it is out of the dark places that hope begins to sprout.
Specific things, circumstances, I don't want to particularly forget - although I don't especially enjoy remembering either:
"No."
He attempted valiantly, he really did, to ignore Sherlock, but when it was a little too quiet, he raised his head in alarm.
"I'll ring you with a time, then." He considers John's rumpled state of being. "Keep your mobile charged. And do speak up if you, or Sherlock, come to need something."
"Indeed," she says with a perky raise of her eyebrows. "They did place that inferior vena cava filter, as I believe you already knew was a possibility. They had to wait until the alteplase was done."
A brain's complicated circuity, from sensory afferent and motor efferent neurons to the pleasure pathways, is still not completely understood. The faint buzz, the floating, pleasurable sensation, the euphoria resulting from various experiences or substances does something from almost first exposure to it - it craves more, it takes over, the brain chemistry is changed, rewired, affirmed. It is powerfully motivated by reward chemicals, the hippocampus and amygdala remember these and are not satisfied without more pleasure, more exposure, more neurotransmitters. Repeated exposures make the connection, the pathway, even stronger. It is similar to the innate drive of a person for food, water, sex, protection from elements - the basic needs. Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine are all prime examples of things that can cause increases in dopamine, bringing about milder symptoms. Some scientists and nutritionists include sugar, salt, and fat to this. Cannabis, cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids take the severe end of the scale. The more exposures, the more the brain wants. And sometimes, the more it takes to achieve it. The chemicals are moderately understood - dopamine, adrenaline, serotonin, endorphins, GABA - but they are powerful and difficult to resist.
Sherlock hadn't listened to any of these, hadn't responded to any of the admissions, the rehabs, the conversations.
One more miracle. Please?
bored."
"So, you don't have a girlfriend, then?"
"He has Laila's smile." Sonya's expression softened as she looked at a black and white close-up photo of Sameer. His dark hair was neatly combed, his smile and his eyes lively. Her words were tender as she looked, seeing the echo of her late daughter in this stranger's face, her grandson. "Oh look at him!" Her eyes grew just slightly moist. "He is handsome."
"John." Despite the personal nature of John's description, Sherlock couldn't stop the amusement from his voice. "And that accent wasn't at all bad."
"What's your problem?" A bunkmate, Ted one of the more senior CRNAs, glared but John didn't answer. They'd known each other long enough, worked together long enough, that mincing words was a pointless waste of time. It was more direct than hostile.
"God no, just stop." John realised that the pronoun was unspecified. "You did mean, not Sameer, but to kidnap Sher --" but he cut off his sentence when he realised Mycroft was having him on. He laughed at his own reaction to something that Mycroft was certainly still capable of arranging.
"I don't disagree. But it sounded like she had no other choice, or at least felt like she didn't, until her husband had died." John stretched, bringing his arms down a little, his mind and body settling from the concerns and vigilance that the evening had required. "Sam did very well tonight. It couldn't have been easy."
They'd dialed a mobile, held it, a rooftop conversation. They'd tossed the mobile aside, connections severed.
Mycroft was instantly and pervasively annoyed. "I see. And yet it falls to me each time? If not me, then to whom?" He could see that the doctor was poised to answer the question but he interjected first. "Tell me, doctor, do you have a younger brother? One that you've helped raise, one that has a genius IQ and that is so wholly misunderstood by people who mean well but ..."
Two sets of Holmes eyes turned to him.
Quick to engage without physically responding, he breathes steadily, slowly, evenly, taking stock as his mind wanders from within the cocoon of the bed linens.
"Sorry, no. It's just ... something we don't usually get to do, lounge around abed like this. You, shirtless. It's nice." John sipped, sighed, sipped again. "Ahhh, nectar of the gods, I swear it."
John blinked once but otherwise didn't move and he let the silence just lay there for a few seconds. "How's the smoking habit going?"
Dr. Franco looked Sherlock straight in the eye. "You collapsed on the kerb within the last hour. I think you're a little beyond serious." He pauses, trying to gauge whether the patient is comprehending. "But this is treatable. And we're going to do the best we can, as quickly as we can."
Sherlock and John intentionally didn't seek out active or potentially dangerous crime scenes any longer. Their family situation required safer, less risky cases these days, so by choice - and with the blessing of the police force - their consulting was somewhat predictable, more sane, less variability. They still found plenty to do, interesting and challenging cases to investigate, and they tried to stay out of harm's way. Best intentions aside, particularly on calls like this one, there was still occasionally the unexpected opportunity for injury.
The physician smiles a bit placatingly and John's unease escalates at that. "I have no control over another surgeon's ..."
"No you're not." He looks back at the movie. Another action film that they'd watched a long time ago that was passably good. Enjoyable even. "Bloody rule follower."
"By the time you're ready for home, you'll be an expert."
"Of course."
"No. Tonight. I tried scrubbing, but ..." His index finger trails over spots over both clavicles, both ribs, the center of his chest. John sees that indeed, there are some reddened patches of irritated skin where monitoring electrodes had been, leaving behind a sticky, tenacious residue. The sensitive skin is mildly abraded where he tried to scrub. It can't feel good, probably catches and perhaps itches. Either way, not good, John is sure. And unlike some of the other stuff that John can't make magically go away, this one is easily fixable.
"I know," he says quietly. And he does. A frown, a crease shows up on John's face, and he is momentarily unable to speak anything else for the emotion right under the surface.
Sherlock flicked off the light in the room as the group moved back toward the doorway. He and John fell into step together, John's hand lightly resting over the small of his back, fingers reassuring, touch grounding. A whole bunch of things came together at once, then, from Mrs. Hudson setting down a picnic basket of food and treats to Molly bringing in her own travel case and her own pillow (pink gingham with ruffles, but Sherlock's mind was whirling too fast to get the derogatory observation out of his mouth in time), and Sam excited too, his eyes bright. Rosie was a little slower, however, on the uptake figuring out what was going on.
have been giving them a hard time. "What's he done?" He could think of no other reason.
For a short while, Sherlock is breathing easy, but as he falls deeper asleep, it changes again to shallow and rapid. John awakens him once to remind him about his breathing. There is some serious blinking going on, and John senses Dawn is standing in the doorway, also watching. "You guys okay?" she asks.
"I can't speak for either of them. But I got the impression that Sherlock was miserable company earlier. John came home, made dinner, spent some nice time this evening with Rosie, and then ... well, he started getting all mopey himself, so I may have planted the seed, encouraged him to return."
"I think I've already said this to you, but it bears repeating, and then we have to move forward." He glanced at the line, never-ending, eager, socially distanced in their surroundings. A few of the other volunteers, patients, and even coordinators were keeping an ear tuned to their conversation, the uncharacteristic delay at John's station piquing their interest. "I chose to get the jab because I am at more risk from this novel virus than from the few unknowns about this new vaccine. Every one gets to make up their own mind about it." Their eyes met across the table, blue into blue, serious and momentarily unrushed. "So, what will it be?"
Yeah, please don't play with mercury.
Mrs. Hudson shook her head at the both of them. "Now boys." She angled her chin, managing to look like a grumbling teddy bear as she pursed her lips. "We're going to have dinner, go for ice cream perhaps later, play a game, read a book. Think about bedtime provided you haven't completely ruined their bedtime routines with your shenanigans." Mrs. Hudson was smiling fondly at John's still-quite-obvious hesitance. "I've managed to survive both you and Sherlock, several explosions, a random attack from one of your more notorious clients, not to mention visits from first responders of almost every sort:  fire, police, ambulance, MI-6, and of course we mustn't forget the other Mr. Holmes, you know,
Mycroft apparently flew up for a quick visit, bought Sherlock dinner which he probably didn't eat and he got something for the nurses in the unit. He is the one that brought the tablet so I could see Rosie over Skype or whatever. I don't really remember him being there.
"Actually I disagree. I have a reputation to maintain." He was good natured but there was a bit of seriousness under the jibe. "I mean, perhaps at age eight, that I could overlook. But Molly has a medical degree."
"Oh good, you're just in time, we were getting ready to call you." The nurse meets him at the door, and at John's somewhat alarmed expression, clarifies, "He's fine. They've assigned us a room. A very nice room, one of the extra big ones, a private VIP room. Not sure about the VIP status, but as soon as they assigned it, I called report before they change their minds." John glances inside the room, where Sherlock is sitting on the edge of the bed. A wheelchair is in front of him.
John glanced at his mobile for the time, assuring himself that he still had plenty before leaving for work. His transition shifts at the urgent care clinic were still short ones but busy. Walk-in traffic and those with appointments visited the practice, seeing him for screenings, jabs, minor injuries, non-acute emergencies, and the occasional out-of-the-ordinary oddity. It felt good - useful, satisfying, and thankfully, relievingly
"To my brother?" Sherlock asked, with a typical irritation in his tone.
"I heard that," Molly said with a smile, now visible with the mask tucked down as they sat across the break room at least six feet apart, the coffee in their respective hands. "I hear it's awful there. She must be so busy." The hospital census was largely known, with elective admissions down and ICU beds taken by patients in various stages of the novel virus. Molly reminded herself from time to time that despite the patients who ended up in her mortuary, there were many many more who survived to discharge and went home. "Is your sister doing okay?"
And now, he realised, taking a deep breath, he needed to make bloody sure he didn't just lie to one of his friends, one of his co-workers, a fellow human being who was suffering. Because - and they all knew it - the virus didn't discriminate, and fine was not always going to be fine.
Sherlock's eye narrowed, and John smiled, a challenge issued. With a quirk of his mouth, he silently mused,
"I'm here." John moves again to stand in Sherlock's line of vision, close to the head of the bed. He hears the directive out in the hallway that they are calling for an anaesthesiologist to intubate, that they need the respiratory therapist, that the ventilator is already in the room on stand-by, that someone is retrieving some sedation from the medication pyxis. He stands looking into Sherlock's face, knowing Sherlock needs him to be strong here, to be his rock in the storm, even as he is listening - restraints, RSI protocols, appropriate staff, and all the rest. He holds Sherlock's hand and touches his shoulder. "I'm not going anywhere."
The breathing tube had come out, and Sherlock was quickly downgraded to another area of the hospital, the other tubes and lines being removed, and he was starting to whinge about getting out.
Ask me to stay, ask me, just ask me.
Little victories indeed. And if the principle of learning obedience was one small victory at a time, John was all for that.
"I'm sorry I ..."
"It's not the same."
"Did you call the police, John?"
"Would you have rather lost your leg from the knee down?"
Rosie wasn't having it just yet. "I want to go too!" Her pout was exaggerated, her little eyes welling up, but Molly had not only anticipated it but was ready. "With you."
His voice lowered to a more hoarse, more base whisper, a plea, a humbled tone "...
"Did you leave something behind?"
Only to find that Sherlock was holding up a makeshift, heavy conglomeration of household items, and was eyeing up angles over his casted ankle and calf. It was a makeshift, handheld sledgehammer.
The flat is quiet. Upstairs, Lydia and Rosie are silent, sleeping, when John arrives home. He hedges in the sitting room, thinking he could crash on the couch again, or ... perhaps a better idea to burrow into the bed in Sherlock's room. Although he may have been hoping that he would end up there - a lifetime ago, wasn’t it, they were flirting, waiting, yearning even - this was definitely not the way he would have chosen it. But he decides it is the better - not to mention much more comfortable - option. He strips quickly to pants and vest, plugs in his phone, tucks his feet between the cool sheets, and inhales deeply of the vague scent of hair products, Sherlock's poncy bath gel, and the laundry smell. John thinks it also smells a tiny bit like cigarette smoke, and finds himself wondering at Sherlock's smoking habit that he'd thought abandoned. Apparently not so.
Still humoured, John sighed with exaggeration as Sameer got out of the car, chuckling. He turned to Rosie, to help with her carseat. "Come on you, let's get you inside and into the bath."
"Want me to take her up?" Sherlock asked, looking on as John looked up at him with appreciation for the offer, and his voice was low and melodical.
Sherlock had his mobile out, the app open, and he flashed the screen at John so he could see. "There's an Uber driver only a block away and available. Okay?"
The lead medic nodded with John's assessment and unzipped one of the equipment bags for supplies. "And your symptoms started when, exactly?"
"Her, neither. I'm so sorry." John's voice was somber, and he once again in his mind he heard the mantra, I-hate-this-virus, over and over. He'd said it, agreed with it, echoed it when someone else said it, and it couldn't be helped. That phrase, he spoke aloud, "It can't be helped, Mrs. H. I'm sorry. We've no choice, really."
"I disagree." The pout on Sherlock's face grew a little mean at being contradicted, then, and John smiled with triumph. Raising his chin, he offered the suggestion. "How about tickets to that sold out musician's show, you know, that David what's-his-name, you've been wanting to see. Didn't you say there's a performance coming up here in town? Connections, yeah? Those tickets might be yours, as a reward, if you ask nicely and do as he's asked."
There is at least, fortunately, recognition, but he is not processing everything, not well. Pupils are dilated, the awareness of discomfort, a frown of concern, of things that should be involuntary - respiration, ventilation - very much in this moment requiring effort and focus. They only see each other for a few seconds before the group leaves the lift, the wheels of the bed bumping slightly over the gap in the floor, but John sees enough to realise a very profound thing:
"Yes it is. You're going to get comfortable in recognising normal so that abnormal will absolutely feel differently."
"You can't come back early, not even for a mystery like this?"
"Maybe you'll like this instead," he growled and then there was the sound of pain, and there was quite a bit of background noise.
He turned, getting a feel for the house.  He would, apparently, be spending the next several nights there, and stood a moment, puzzled at something.
An obligation to be repaid.
"No."
John's interview at the urgent clinic had gone quite well. The receptionist, charge nurse, and practice founder and he just clicked,  interview committee firing questions and all-in-all having a good time, the banter between them all jovial and prodding. It seemed immediately that it was going to be a good match with temperament, work ethic, and a passion for community health, with all parties realising that this was just going to ... work out.
The insomnia had grown to epic proportions, the middle of the night being an endless, interminable pit of torture. Even thinking about trying to lie down, to close his eyes, to rest, ended up with his mind whirling and his heart racing. In bed, it was worse: his head ached, his shoulder throbbed, and he rolled over again. And again. And again. Pillow adjustment, covers off, covers on, slow deep breathing, counting bloody sheep, guided imagery seemed pointless in that nothing helped, nothing worked. Flip, flip, flip. Sigh, swallow. Deeper sigh.
The translator looked at the woman, who stood there. Her eyes connected with John again as the translator spoke, and then toward the door of the flat. There was more murmuring, Dari, he was almost sure, and John was quite aware that Sam had probably been quite visible from the door.
From within his arms, Sherlock could feel John really try to take control of himself, of the remaining muscle tension, of his breathing, of his body position. He could feel the moments when his mind was settling, in the tightness of his shoulders as they very faintly began to ease. Pressing his lips tenderly against John's head one more time, he thought about the possibility that this virus could worm its way into their home too, their family. "I hate this virus too."
Greg cannot hide the sparkle, the interest, the passion for the opportunity, that flared in his expression as he pocketed the card.
He describes, a little monotone, the last evening. Dinner - John'd eaten, Sherlock, a birdlike nibble meant to appease. Pain medication, mindless crap telly, the settling on the couch, John's hand resting lightly over that epigastric area that caused him the most discomfort, willing if he could through the power of his hand to ease the symptoms. Of the soft-spoken, whispered words of love, of thanks, and then seeing Sherlock's eyes close for what would be the final time. The irregular breathing pattern - Cheyne-Stokes - the longer and longer periods of apnea. The faint releasing of muscle tone until finally, the last unanswered exhale.
Three adult faces were sporting smirks at that, as Mrs. Hudson made her way back downstairs, muttering something about them having to hoover on their own since she'd been denied access to the flat.
"I'm okay with pink and purple if you want," he told her.
"Not do what? Talk about something you brought up, that was clearly misunderstood on my end, that seemed rather important at the time?"
The ambulance driver appeared then in the doorway, poking his head inside, meeting them part way. "Going to have to lift over that biggest tree. This driveway," he began, gesturing over his shoulder as he shook his head, "is an absolute nightmare."
"Do keep up."
"I actually never thought it would happen."
"You're not still there, right?" Her long hair was still pulled back, and John thought he could still see fatigue, deep and set-in, around her eyes as she spoke. "Haven't seen you lately."
"Not too much."
"Well, clearly you're not feeling well, with fever, and vomiting, and --"
Thank you for seeing it. For getting it. For
His heart continues to resonate, to pound, and his mouth is dry the entire trip to the hospital, and he is grateful for the deserted roads this time of night. The hospital hallways are also mostly deserted once he clears through the A&E, the waiting room of the ICU also empty - lucky everyone else, his mind pokes at him - and he presses the buzzer. "Watson for Holmes."
"Are you even going to remember the answer if I give it? Seems whatever you took earlier is still kind of lingering."
"You are also a ridiculous man."
Mycroft, John discovers, is very uncomfortable. Squeamish. Whether it is hospitals in general or Sherlock in hospitals, he doesn't know. Either way, he only stays a few minutes, promises to stay in touch, threatens to remove John forcibly if he doesn't leave the building later today. He reminds him that John should not test him in this, that Mycroft will assure it happens willingly or not. They share small smiles at that memory, and then Mycroft presses a business card into his hand. "There is guaranteed twenty-four, seven reach-ability if you need transport, errands, or access to me if for some reason you fail to get through on my mobile. I do expect to be accessible, but, well, hang on to that."
"Of course not," he blurted although John considered that he was likely lying. "This happens to other people. To the common. Not to me. Not like this."
Sherlock's brow raises. "And you accused me of not knowing how to play the game. That's the point. Hasten and facilitate the discharge to home."
"Planning on escaping without someone monitoring you?"
"It was not what you saw. It was mostly ... violent. Gunshot. Trauma. Unplanned, unexpected."
"English and Dari, of course."
Fine, whatever. Obviously, Mycroft was calling to annoy him, to express his dissatisfaction that Sherlock hadn't called him. Sherlock huffed, irritated, and counted to four before replying, "I didn't tell you about John's injury --"
Sherlock's gaze snapped instantly on John, who could feel the defensiveness rise. "I was going to tell you. It's not official, yet."
"And snuggled with your daughter?"
"You'll do no such thing," Mycroft informed him, a hand wrapping coolly, lightly around his arm as the surgeon gave a brief update then got summoned away, but not before pressing his business card into Mycroft's outstretched hand. He had already dropped his hand from John, and with brusque formality he addressed the patient. "Sherlock?"
At the doorway, she'd joined him to press a business card into his hand. On it was her mobile number. "Use this if you have to."
"Thank you." John had never heard quite the level of sincerity. "I ..."
All too well he vividly recalled one notification from a newer Deputy Inspector Gregory Lestrade advising him that he'd found Sherlock, again, at a crime scene spouting off his mouth, impaired but ... there was something more. Something too precious to waste. He told him that an intervention was needed if any of them were going to prevent something serious - more serious - from happening. There had been something in his words, in his tone, in the sincerity that had rung true that had made Mycroft wondering at the DI's above-average insight.
And out to get him.
"How many did you get this time?" Mycroft let the question hang and it took Sherlock a few moments before he actually heard and understood the question.
her or anything." John holds his words, knowing that choosing battles here is the wisest course of action. "Unless she's completely incompetent."
John thinks. "I'll go if you want, and I guess soon. I do think Rosie isn't feeling all that great. And I probably should check in ..."
" For some reason, Sherlock didn't usually ever swear, and both hated doing it even as he got off on it. Or would, shortly. A faint tinge of colour infused his cheeks, his cheekbones tinted and even more angular than usual.
"I'm relieved."
Opting not to answer that, not wishing to encourage him just yet, John set the pen and paper down, then pressed a kiss into Sherlock's temple. "You're a ridiculous man, too." John felt rather than saw Sherlock's smile, his face changing shape a little as it rested against him. "I find I'm rather ... fond of you anyway."
"John. Please. I know you, and that you're going to tell me anyway and that you're mildly uncomfortable asking for it, speaking up. So, here, I have opened the door wide for you to just blurt it out. What do you want?" Sherlock watched as John wrestled internally with how to say it, and when, or even if. Eventually, he stopped walking. John continued only a pace before stopping himself. Sherlock was giving John the opening, the opportunity, and some gentle impetus to speak up.
"-- and has a giant case of imposter syndrome, when actually you're likely the highest qualified student in your class --"
"Suit yourself. You're not going to need it that long."
John initially shook his head, then remembered something. "Did someone update his brother?"
"No, I mean using good common sense and concrete evidence."
John wasn't sure how to respond to that. Most of him wanted to rail at the unfairness of the situation and hug Sameer right there in the store. "I'm so sorry." He settled for kneeling, taking Sameer's hand, and speaking slowly, "I know you miss her." He could see the moment his son seemed to move back into all right territory. "I wish I could have helped you take care of her when she wasn't feeling well. We definitely would have bought her another pair of shoes." John wanted to say 'bloody shoes' but knew it wouldn't make either of them feel better. Sameer nodded, the faintly sweet crooked smile that he seemed to have picked up from Sherlock somehow. "You know," John said, looking back at the racks of boxes, "I'll bet she had a favourite colour. Maybe we could choose that for your new football boots?"
"I know. Almost there. Deep breaths, you're doing so well." He hesitated, wondering if either the doc or the anaesthetist had additional things to tell him, but they seemed quite content to let John continue. "So there's a little more medicine, feel it? It's helping you just fade off lightly to sleep. And you can close your eyes if you want, I'll keep talking ... or yammering ... while you do. That's it, good, keep them closed. It'll help. Deep breath." He made eye contact with the anaesthesiologist, who made sure John could read the syringe label, Fentanyl, and Allison offered John the bite block. At his gesture toward Sherlock's mouth, she nodded although it was with a question. John nodded back, trying not to sigh audibly. He didn't want to be the one dishing out the unpleasantness but knew it was probably best for Sherlock. "Okay, good, and I'm going to help with the bite block --"
"No," he finally answered. "And why is that one mine? I'm not the oldest in the family."
Shit, he'd not given much thought to the fallen tree, the inaccessible driveway. The still-driving rain. The storm.
John:  Although I would agree that the rings would compliment the bowl nicely, I don't know about you, but I really don't plan on taking mine off. I know yellow gold is rather traditional, but I was thinking platinum would look more appealing on your hand.
"Home. He and Greg are reviewing some miscellaneous things. He's fine." John frowned just a little at the slightly altered truth. "Well, getting there. Still some, you know, breathlessness at times. Especially with exertion, climbing the stairs. But improving."
"Just be in the moment for a little bit, John, even when it's hard. He's better. The PE is resolving. Breathing tube next. We'll worry about tomorrow, and the day after that, when it comes."
"My personal policy is that I don't trust the encryption." She eased into one of the stuffed chairs, considered by the contour of the cushion, the location in the room, that she was sitting in John's chair. "Didn't sound like there was a problem. Exactly."
"You have a brother, Sherlock Holmes?"
John'd never had a hand massage, never a manicure, not in all his years, so he had little to compare it to, but the experience was ... nearly spiritual in nature, leaving him feeling remarkably taken care of, and feeling particularly cherished.
Chagrined, John shook his head. "Of course you're going. You have to. You said you would." He was still offering an occasional assurance - trying to convince whom, he wasn't sure - as he led the way down the hallway, preceding him into the bedroom, knowing he'd follow. "Which suitcase?"
John nods. The big question in his mind, of course, is
A few hours of sleep and things look well not quite as bad. Rosie should be back today and maybe it will be better this time.
"They diagnosed me with that as a child. Tried meds, therapy, tutoring."
"We'll catch you on the way back out, you can help push the bed up to ICU." There is a sparkle in the nurse's eye, and a good deal of confidence. They stop, don head coverings and masks, then disappear into the procedure room.
"I gave them two weeks."
"Ugly."
"There were others that were, and I'm so very --"
Age ten, the recital. Both parents in the audience and Mycroft, the slightest fingering problem, the quick correction, the moving forward in the piece, the way his cheeks heated. His teacher afterward, assuring him that most people did not have the slightest inclination that he'd made a very tiny mistake, that he'd recovered well and did not let it affect him. His father, mildly disappointed, his mother, warm and snuggly and hugging his own perfectionistic tendencies away. He'd allowed the hug, the assurance that it was okay, and his fingers carried the scent of horsehair, of rosin, of music, of the polishing cloth, of the easy acceptance from his mother.
"Hands off."

"They ar----
Giving them, and all of us, and the world at large, HOPE.
"Let's wait and see how --" John stopped speaking when there was a sudden flail within the bed and Sherlock tugged at the sheet and blanket hard, flinging it up over his head and just staying there. John tried very hard to keep the chuckle from his voice but knew it was evident in the tone. "Let me ask, did you learn that from Rosie? Because that's exactly what I used to get from her when she didn't want to hear something." The lump under the covers sighed and movement at the top of the bed indicated that Sherlock had indeed turned his head as far as he could in the direction away from John. He left out the fact that Rosie had long ago outgrown that particular childish tantrum. "One thing at a time. I know you don't want to hear it."
Greg made a tchucking sound in his throat. "You should set a good example for Rosie, here."
"Thank you for your service, Dr. Watson. Best of wishes as you continue to recover."
" There was a faint pause. "Or you'll have to leave. Others are waiting."
(See the end of the chapter for
One side of Sam's mouth went angling down, and he shook his head no. "I don't think so. And, I guess really, there isn't anyone left there."
"I don't have an issue being known as non-compliant."
"But the sooner we get him on a wean, the sooner we can get rid of this tube."
"Oh good, I can say hello too," Greg settles back on the chair, picks up Rosie, "To your papa and ..."
"I worked with her for nine years."
"You've never done this. Ever. Not even once." John tucked in his shirt, and was in the process of sliding his belt through the loops when he asked, "Am I being manipulated? Played?"
"One what," she says. "I don't see anything. And I don't think I see you, either," she directs at John. There is the faint sound of a chuckle as she leaves, only to return a few moments later with extra toothbrush, toothpaste, towel, and hospital slippers. With a wriggle of her eyebrows at the two of them, she ghosts from the room, the door closing completely behind her.
Dr. Benson is a little skeptical. "I've never seen it. I'm not sure. I mean, I hear you, it makes sense. But ... well, we have to confirm it anyway." He presents his case, that it could just have been spasm, inflammation, other odd reasons and just a very unusual, rare coincidence that the arterial and venous clots both happened in close succession. "And it could have been afib. That could definitely explain it."
Two departures, actually.
"Do you think we can try it?" Her words were carefully inflected, casual but direct. "We'll ask your papa and Mr. Holmes to step out for the first part of our meeting, and then they'll come back in at the end?"
"Compromised!"
Broodily, Sherlock simply looked back at John, unhappy, stubborn, and glaring in response.
"Does that mean, knock it off, you know that's annoying?"
Allison stood patiently waiting, watching, as the medication entered the IV tubing, gauging Sherlock's reaction. Although he still was obviously awake, his face was less tight. And it eased more over the next minute or so after the last dose.
Almost immediately, John envisioned Sherlock's calf between his hands, the lotion and the muscle and the ... intimacy. Although he’d  just been touching him, soothing the muscle cramp with his hands, this was very definitely different. With a dry mouth, he set the lotion down next to Sherlock. "Here you go." Stepping back, he took careful note of his own pounding heart as he tried to pay attention to something ... anything ... else.
- clear over time. So he keeps the explanation very brief, assures Sherlock that he is not going anywhere, and that he should rest. And just breathe.
"You're not going to bleed out."
"Sherlock," John said after a moment, knowing the nurse was waiting for some sort of acknowledgement.
"You knew he needed it."
Sherlock's question did not surprise John, in the least. John could feel the stress easing off him, rolling off in waves and in the settling of his breath as he exhaled. He could almost feel his spine straighten, his shoulders release a little of their perpetual tension, his mind realise that it was indeed time to move on, and that there was definitely an end in sight. "So you're good with it?"
John could feel his heels digging in and his confidence raised along with his chin. "I don't believe I caught your name."
"Even with that, his NIH is still down to a zero." Rob gestures at the paper printout that he’d written on then placed on the foot of Sherlock's bed, referring to the scoring scale that is used when assessing patients for signs of a stroke.
"John Watson," he speaks his name.
"I hope they continue. My sister said it was the highlight of the day." They grinned at each other, knowing that perspective was everything in these trying times. "One of the other non-covid units got wind of it, asked if he would lead it for them too. He turned it down flat, said it was only for his unit right now."
It was the light purple blanket Mrs. Hudson had crocheted for Rosie when they'd redecorated her upstairs bedroom, when John'd moved into the downstairs one.
It felt more like a benediction.
"I do trust you to take care of yourself. Take care of us." He sat up straighter, a bit more himself, more comfortable than he'd been for this awkward and sobering conversation. "I also trust that you're about to make me a nice cup of tea."
"We're home now, anyway. And Mrs. Hudson had a meal for us, packed up and waiting on the stairs." He crossed to the micro, set the dish inside, the buttons beeping loudly.
He blurts the word out, incredulous. "John!" He tries to press up on his elbows, to better express his ire from a more upright, more authoritative position.
This is it!  Thanks for following along, for all the help and encouragement on this rather intense journey.
The Proctor's Disciplinary council, only once:  come pick him up, and just to keep you informed, there will be a university panel meeting later today, where I will be recommending immediate expulsion for behavioural misconduct.
He finds pyjamas, changing quickly in the bathroom, brushes his teeth while he is in there. In the bedroom, he clicks on the baby monitor so he will know when Rosie wakes. He turns out the lamp, and without a word, he tucks the oxygen in within arms reach near Sherlock's nightstand, close to him, before climbing into the other side of the bed.
"Lots of my friends at school --" Sam tried again.
He sounds a bit too casual for John, who considers that they are working within a very small window for accuracy, and even a little too aggressive -
John hesitates only a second. "Blanket apologies, then."
"Go hurry them along. I hate it here, I want to go home, and there's no reason to stay any longer." Pointedly, John sat quietly where he was, sipping at his own coffee, watching Sherlock's frustration with rising compassion. "Now."
"Of ...?"
"Answer my question. What would happen?"
"It's to protect your teeth, that's all." John moved one hand from where Sherlock's rested so that he rubbed lightly along his forearm, hoping it would be distracting. Or comforting. Or anything at all that would work. "And they have to get it in so they can give you more medicine. Too late and your jaw sometimes clenches." He watched the swirl of white medication mix within the IV tubing. "He's giving you more now, I see, so take a deep breath and in a moment, we'll have you open your mouth while you finish going to sleep."
"It was fun. Doing something nice for someone that was, well, sort of -- mostly anyway -- a surprise."
"I know. I'm here to help you, they asked me to come in, okay?"
"I don't want to talk about it."
She takes his hand and he does not pull away. Not on the surface anyway.
"Then sniff the corpse and blow off the cigarette ash, I don't care. Whatever gets you to slow down a little. The sooner you comply, the quicker we can leave."
"They'll be along," he assured, declining the invitation to make a nuisance of himself. "And just so you know, I prefer you at home too."
An incoming call with Mycroft’s caller ID.
"True. No one can argue that the vaccine to treat a virus we've only been aware of for barely more than twelve months -- I mean," and John forced himself to catch his breath. "Obviously, the usual twenty four months of study afterward is not possible. It would have been nice to wait for that - except that people are dying, and --"
Rob has seen the activity, spies the urinal, and is ready to say something positive when John's voice cuts through the intention. "His arm is ice-cold. I think we need Dr. Nguyen."
of your own."
Discharging a patient out of the hospital was much different than it used to be, when it was handing papers back and forth, signing here and there, pointing, sharing a biro. Now it was usually giving discharge instructions by phone, speaker phone in the room on occasion, sometimes over video calling, with a family member or caregiver. It involved coordination of when the patient's ride was coming or whomever was able to drive over to pick them up and a limited contact exchange at the doors of the hospital. It was often an ambulance to another facility and involved oxygen and transfer devices.
"I know. And I apologise for the pressure." Although he can't see it, Mycroft knew that the man's facial expression was unpleasant; lips drawn, eyes tight, perhaps teeth clenched. He has at least marginally offended this man, this friend, resource, and confidante. Time to soothe the ruffled feathers. "Your opinion means quite a lot to me."
John reached out an arm, touched Sherlock along his wrist, only to be very surprised when Sherlock drew back. It reminded John of a turtle drawing its arms and head to safety. "I don't understand, then."
The oxygen level drops a bit more, and he feels Dr. Nguyen's hand on his arm. "His ABG is back, and he's working harder. He needs to be intubated. It'll let him rest, take over the breathing for a little." Although he wouldn't have challenged her on it, because he can see that Sherlock's work of breathing is not improving, nor is his oxygen level. This effort can't be sustained long term, and she holds out the printout so he can see for himself. For all the values being slightly abnormal, it is the arterial oxygen level that is the most abnormal, quite low, an indication that they can wait no longer.
Dinner begins promptly, unrushed but not leaving any time for people to become maudlin or for the evening to drag, plates are carried out with great efficiency, water at the tables, quick and professional servers. Mike Stamford opens the evening just as people are part-way into the entree.
Over the next hour or so, the room remained candle-lit only, Sherlock's mobile remained off-line, and John did what he could with the open air room. Which wasn't much save to remove what was easily retrieved from the room and block off the doorways best he could to keep out the wind. The water damage already was severe. Perhaps when the day cleared, he would be able to find some plastic sheeting to drape over the damage.
Only to be awakened what seemed like a few minutes later by Rosie's sounds in the morning, her day beginning as usual, her night having been everything - restful, restorative, peaceful - John's was not.
"She's on her way. Brought a warm blanket."
"Waiting for what?"
John takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes. They touch in so many places, clasped hands, forearms, temple to jaw, and for a moment they breathe in the other, reveling in the rightness, the pain of separation falling off like unneeded and forgotten bits of burden. The circle is complete.
"You'll be all right. Need me to get you anything before I leave?"
"Never heard of him."
"Should I apologise already?" John says from the foot of the bed. Uh oh, but maybe a good sign.
"Don't worry, I won't."
From down the hall came the low murmuring of voices. Uh oh, he contemplated, he'd intended to go upstairs. Not Rosie, too early. Perhaps Mycroft? Mrs. Hudson? Greg with a case? He couldn't identify who the other speaker was. Shrugging into his dressing gown and slippers, he checked the time - middle of the night - and soundlessly stepped into the hall.
"Just shut up," Mycroft whispered, "or I'll make sure Rosie gets her wish to see your nose bl--"
There was the milestone of Sherlock looking his smoking habit in the face.
"And accessories."
There was.
Yes, this is why I carried a tissue with me up on stage. Sorry, give me a mo while I ...
He was already being shooed away. "Go. It'll take us a minute to load him anyway."
The resultant chuckle did much to lower the tension, the awkwardness. "No worries," she grinned a bit then, saw a distraction, and took it. "How old is your daughter?"
It is not pulsatile like a pseudoaneurysm, John thinks, though he can't be entirely sure at this point. Not yet. John wonders at the seriousness, the risk of retroperitoneal haematoma, where the bleeding is even worse on the inside and harder to tell. "Back pain?" he asks.
Softly, John snickered. "That he did." He turned to see Sherlock tucked on his side, eyes open, just watching. "Thanks for helping keep the house in order. And for ..." he hesitated.
Mycroft.
"Try the music again," Dawn suggests.
"I guess, yeah." His brow was still a little furrowed, but he made an attempt to restate the meaning. "One only helps for a little while. The other, for longer."
Leaning back in the chair at the bedside, he crossed one ankle over his knee as if he had no inclination to do any such thing. "Partner?"
Mrs. Hudson had arrived in plenty of time to mind Rosie while John, Sherlock, and Sameer went on their outing. A brief tube ride, a few blocks' walk, and shortly they were ushered into an office. As they'd done previously, they sat opposite a small table and a smiling young woman.
Unrushed, he considered John for a moment, and when he spoke, his words were quiet. "That bad?" It was more a statement and an observation than a question.
More blasting rain came in from the open walls and roof of the corner of the room then, and John pondered briefly his dilemma. "Will you be okay if I run to the car, grab my bag?"
"Pain out of proportion, it's tight. Really unsafely tight. Matter of time."
"Small bedsit. The literal place on the floor is barely big enough, but ..." He shrugged, pondering that he was giving it any consideration, and he reminded himself of many reasons why it was unacceptable. "It's really not a good idea, Sherlock. I'm sorry."
"I brought a gift for Rosie, too, come to think of it. Should be in there somewhere." John digs a bit deeper, into his overnight bag, finds a parcel, holds it out, and Sherlock nods. "Take it home for her. Just a small --"
But not for John.
"You may as well at least stay tonight. Neither of you particularly need a jaunt across town."
"No boundaries, then. Good to know," John rolled his eyes.
"You okay?" he asked quietly.
A nurse looks up as his strides place him opposite the desk, his fingers resting on the flat surface in front of him.
. But the warm presence of another person made the other observations unnecessary. Because, somehow, in his sleep, he had wriggled up fairly close to his flatmate and coiled an arm around his waist. Although it had been a bloody long time since spooning or snuggling with someone, his body remembered and took great advantage of the opportunity. There was faint rise and fall under John's arm as Sherlock breathed. Riotous, unruly curls were in his line of vision, very nearly brushing against his forehead. Hoping for stealth, he relaxed his body, lightened his touch, and began to slide his arm away.
Post op was only supposed to be a few hours, to stabilise, wake up from anaesthesia, receive pain meds if needed, to meet certain goals, and be sent to another ward. John's post op experience was typical - "take some deep breaths now" and "this pain medicine might make you a wee groggy" - and he moved through the process without incident.
John tried to imagine living in a remote cottage with Sherlock, growing old together, his shooting the walls and probably worse than that, and the various adventures they might have. None of the imaginings included vicious animals, but John thought he would save that battle for another day. "Okay, fine. Both."
"Doubtful. My assignment is at the surgical hospital, not on the front lines."
"So does mixing up the order change the outcome?" There is silence in the classroom. "Crickets," he observes. "Okay, then. Show of hands, everyone participates, here are your two options. First, the order of metal first, magnet second, or magnet first, metal second, doesn't matter and the results will be the same. Your other option, that the results will be visible and obvious depending on which substance I place down first. Matters?" He looks about. "Or doesn't matter?"
"I know, but ..." John let the words trail off, knowing that if Sam was okay that pushing him was not wise. "Well, if you ever feel like you wished maybe you had a bigger family, or get lonely, we'll just invite Aunt Harry and Uncle Mycroft over more often. You know, for family entertainment purposes."
"Must be the truth, yeah," he utters, feeling the strong muscles of Sherlock's arms again, the vigor, the understated health and strength. "I've missed this." Laughter bubbles out of him at the sheer joy of reunion, of rightness. "Missed you."
John removed his mobile from his pocket. "Yup, Lestrade." Rosie was watching him as she nibbled on the sweets she'd procured from the machine. "I guess we'll take care of that tomorrow."
"Your stethoscope. Not the usual nurse grade one, which is fine, by the way. This one you're wearing, cardiology afficionado only, someone with extreme dedication to the craft ..."
From behind the mostly closed door of the connecting bathroom had been normal sounds of someone getting ready for bed, water running, the clicking of a tooth brush after rinsing. John heard Sherlock blowing his nose, and then a sneeze, followed by the hissed words, "Oh shit." John was already sitting upright when the alarm in Sherlock's voice summoned him with quiet urgency, "John!"
"Just go home." The flatness, the lack of fight, is sobering - John hates it.
"The heparin drip?"
The milestone of their first day home passes with relative ease, their first night on their own is another milestone that ended up being quite memorable, but in a surprising sort of way and not necessarily for the reason either of them would have hoped.
Yes please. Go ahead, I'm ready.
"I need shoes."
Smoking cessation:  completely and permanently, no further smoking ever in your lifetime. Transdermal nicotine patch may be used, one patch per day following the steps exactly as prescribed by your physician. If further cessation modalities are needed, please discuss this at your first follow-up appointment.
Sherlock's breathing is exertional by the time they finish a brief stop in the loo - teeth, toilet, hot flannel for his face - and John works a bit of magic when Sherlock almost trips on his oxygen tubing trying to get into bed. Both are grateful for the extra-long tubing that attaches to the concentrator that John has relocated to a more central location in the hallway. The pillow barely crinkles under Sherlock's head, the curls settling lightly on the pale linen and over his pale face.
"I am."
"It's ninety percent backwash. No thank you." Though he wrinkles his nose in disgust, Sherlock ruffles at Rosie's hair, briefly.
John was composing his response when his mobile buzzed again, another text demanding to be collected immediately. He opted for a more prompt response, and dialed.
"Look, I'm sorry we're here. Mostly. But there's a large part of me that's grateful. I thought a few days ago that ..." He can't bring the words out. "We'll get through this. You will."
"Just my hand," Sherlock whispers, "I want to touch is all." His voice is sultry and gravelly and close to John's ear. "For now."
Molly had driven to meet them half-way, and was stowing Rosie's bag in the boot of her car. "Okay."
The men stand huddled at her side, their arms brushing, and for the first time since Rosie'd taken ill, Sherlock finally feels he can dial back the high-alert. Sort of. Now John is here, and Rosie is better - not one-hundred percent yet, but on the mend, has turned the corner - that awful, nauseous ache in his chest expands, eases, abates.
Since that earliest connection with Molly and Sameer had gone so well, John had done his best to ensure that their family got together with Molly with some regularity. Over the past months, she had come over a few nights when he and Sherlock had plans, and there had been a few excursions, meals, and random encounters at Barts. They had gone to see a movie together, the five of them.
But, the address must've been bad, and in the settling dusk, John couldn’t locate the house. His GPS was simply circling, and there were no house numbers along the stretch of road. John was ready to ring his supervisor and just about to turn around when he spotted a nearly hidden driveway, a space in which a small lane wound in and between some carefully manicured hedges. John nosed the small company owned car into the lane, found a long drive that managed to eventually deliver him to a small estate, several outbuildings, a car park, and a very expensive looking home.
," John presses his own word back at him, "for any sort of serious discussion is limited to about thirty seconds. We were discussing --"
"Any thoughts as to why?"
John figured the question was more tame than it could have been. "Depends. Someone sick as he was, probably not too long." He gestured a bit toward Carrie, if she wanted to clarify.
"And you're running the code?"
"The swelling
John was never one for making an abundance of body noises. He seldom cleared his throat, sniffled, or even chewed loudly. So when he made a few sounds in his throat, a couple of times in a row one evening while they were watching some documentary Sherlock was interested in, he glanced up apologetically to find Sherlock watching him.
It was Christmas Day, and Rosie had sounded her wake-up call while it was still dark outside, rousing the house. The adults staggered toward the kitchen and the tea-kettle and insisted that they be given a few more minutes of peace. It was not dark any longer, the morning passing with excitement and newness as Sameer experienced his first Christmas in London.
John said it first, identifying the rhythm that he'd suspected, but there was no satisfaction in being right. "Atrial fib." John was somewhat reassured - only a little - that it was indeed narrow complexed and not ventricular in origin. John knew that it was fast. Really fast. No wonder Sherlock wasn't feeling well, had no energy, and couldn't catch his breath.
Sherlock reached out a long arm, took the remote from him. He was a bit more intense than the situation warranted.
endoscopic cardiovascular ultrasound, transoesophageal echocardiogram with agitated saline transthoracic contrast echocardiography,
"Are you still up on the roof?"
"I want to come with you now." He was being difficult for the sake of being difficult, John knew, but even knowing that, leaving wasn't going to be easy.
"You're in the hospital," John tries to explain things, keeping it to the basics, "This is your room. You're -- hey, leave that alone," but it only buys them a few minutes before Sherlock tries to get at his oxygen again.
He takes another deep breath, and drifts, extremities tingling, and the adventure continues.
None of the things had been that unusual, or so John'd thought. Until he put them all together.
"Wednesday." John hesitates, stops completely. "Yes, I'm fairly certain it's still Wednesday."
"I don't care what you call it."
"Please don't, Sherlock."
Had Sherlock been a brawler, he might've punched a wall. Or better, his brother. And oh he was angry, seething at having been left in a holding cell for nearly three days. And he was shaky, hungry (the fare he'd been served, quite lacking), thirsty, and without a working mobile again.
. "Asked them if they understood. Explained about the likelihood of him dying, that there was little else we could offer. Asked them if they wanted CPR even as I tried to tell them it wouldn't work anyway."
Rosie tilts her head, the smile resting crookedly, a product of not necessarily her genes but her environment. "You think?"
Resurgence.
So I get to the end of the chapter and it's kind of like a Forrest Gump chapter, all taking place while sitting on a park bench, except that this time it's a waiting room.  I find that I'd rather keep the chapters this length so that I can post more frequently.  The PFO (patent foramen ovale) closure is a minor procedure done while the patient is awake, with some sedation, pain medication, intracardiac echocardiography, and careful monitoring while the device is deployed.  The devices are made of nickel-titanium, mesh, and some with specially designed foam.  It's done a couple of different ways (reader's choice) and most commonly akin to a sort of "occluder" that is custom chosen based on PFO size, and then attached to both sides of the hole.  Complications include rhythm disturbances (afib, most commonly), stroke, bleeding, thrombosis, pericardial injury, or embolization of the device.  Is it a spoiler if I just lay it out there that no complications are planned and no fictional character has been harmed as a result of this procedure?
Sherlock's mobile pinged much later, hours having dragged by with a book, a movie in the sitting room before moving to the bedroom with restless energy.
A TEE is a trans-esophageal echocardiogram, and I guess in the UK this is a TOE? Anyway, the procedure is the same, an ultrasound probe on an endoscope that does, as one of the characters says, get a front row seat to some parts of the heart that are more difficult to see using a TTE (trans-thoracic echo). That pesky left atrial appendage, for sure. And while a bubble study can be done with regular echo, in this case, the providers wanted to check out the entire thing in this manner.
"Yes I am. It's all downhill from here. It's like the seal has been broken."
"Sorry, I know I'm holding tight." Sherlock, still trembling, is laying almost flat on the bed while John leans hard, pressing over the former groin puncture site that has begun to expand. "The coughing and the blood thinners," he begins.
Sameer's head had raised almost immediately when he'd heard footsteps on the stairway, and he was watching expectantly. An eye narrowed as he saw Sherlock enter alone, close the door, hang up only one coat, and look to find him, their eyes connecting. Sherlock took in the state of the table - only a few pieces placed, others just rearranged - and that of Sameer: anxious, on edge, distracted. Sameer's hands fell to his lap as he sensed that something was greatly amiss. An ominous announcement was on the horizon.
"It will ultimately be your choice. And I hear you, that this is kind of bad news. But it's treatable. And you've come through so much of it already."
"Sherlock," John began.
Mycroft looked smug. "Thank you."
"Why are you annoyed?"
"Damaged. Wet. That front corner room is ... a disaster. We had to carry him to the ambulance. Downed trees over the drive and such." A nurse came in then, checked on Sherlock's leg and IV pump, made a few notations, asked about his pain level, and left again. "Hopefully, in both cases, nothing permanent that can't be repaired."
"No matter what, you can't just go around digging up mysteries."
Sherlock keeps silent, but his lips thin out and John can tell he finds that annoying. To offset the upcoming irritability, he tries to be reassuring, pats Sherlock on the calf. "I'll explain it all to you."
, I would have enjoyed it a lot more."
John enters the hospital before visiting hours (again), passes the security desk, waves a hand in greeting at the now-familiar morning shift officer, and takes the shortest path through the lobby to the lift and down the hallway on the acute care unit, and strides into Sherlock's room. He presses open the door fully, and Sherlock turns at the noise. He is reclining in the chair by the window, jaw set with irritation, oxygen still resting under his nose and coiling around his ears. He is watching the world outside the windows, life going on without him. And he is seething, yearning to be ... anywhere else but in this hospital room. The IV pump he is connected to is still infusing, the bag of heparin on the pole full, likely newly hung. John wonders if it is the thought of an entire, new bag being brought in that set him off this time.
, John thinks.
"Hmm," Dawn says from the bedside, "perhaps he's not too much a fan of being awake, or even a little bit awake, with this tube."
By the time John'd arrived to Baker Street, the flat dark, heavy, and quiet, there were more:
She checked with both of them, cycled another blood pressure, assured them the monitor was very stable, and made sure the call bell was well within Sherlock's reach.
There was some collective adult male breath-holding in the absolutely silent room until Sameer nodded. The therapist flicked her eyes quickly at them, then at the door. As they'd discussed, making a minimum of fuss about leaving would be optimal if at all possible.
[message deleted]
He was even angry with Mike, with whom he had spoken with those weeks ago. Mike was
John relays this as well, and in short order, Sherlock coughs, then gags, and the vent alarms and then there is more thrashing, restless pulling, agitation, movement, and a few minutes where both John and Dawn are trying to calm him back down, keep the tubes intact, the lines safe.
John made a grand gesture at the children. "Do you see that? You and Mycroft should learn a thing or two. Compromise. Make a deal to get what you want. And to keep peace."
He updated the security agency, letting his employer know that everything seemed fine, and was surprised when, a few hours later, found a message. They'd been in communication with the homeowner, who was now requesting in-person attendance until he returned. It was looking like John had managed an alternate address for almost two weeks. An email followed noting the client's regulations specific to the home.
"Did she seem nice?"
"No."
The word died in his throat as he heard a noise. The faint flicker of a lighter meeting the end of cigarette, two hands and an angled jaw illuminated briefly across the room, the flare of a draw as the cigarette found ignition, glowing red. “Idiot.”
John swallowed over the sudden, thick lump in his throat, grateful that he didn't need to respond out loud. Tapping gently on Sameer's arm, he gestured in a brushing motion with his fingers that he should move over, to slide over on the bed, to make room. There were a few adjustments of the covers, and they lay there, John's feet hanging way over the end of the bed but in peaceful companionship, listening to the rumbling storm move overhead and finally grow more distant.
"Operation Warp Speed means that ..."
His slow blink, his nod, let her know that she is heard, but overall Sherlock deflects. And they both know it, as he abruptly changes the subject. "Your presence here, quite appropriate. It's somehow fitting that no one else in this room has the slightest inclination of how hard you worked and how crucial your role was to their good mental health." Molly tries to keep the surprise from her face, thinks about shushing him, but he is discreetly hushed. "Of course he told me. Well, I deduced most of it, naturally. But I think you know I can keep a secret."
"No. No mobile." John sighed at his persistence. "You're
"Come here," he said quietly, an arm outreached. He pulled her close, gave her a close hug. "I'm not disappointed at all. This was your first year." When she nodded, he spoke again. "You competed with students who have been there many years, are probably a lot older?" Not waiting for her to confirm when they already knew, he went on. "I'm proud of you. For you. Not because of what you do."
"So I hear, too."
. Highly intelligent demonstrations of ..."
John stands up, shaking feeling back into his arms as he cocks his neck, trying to crack the stiffness out of it, tries to blink the dryness out of his eyes.
Sam winced as John helped him stand. "Couch first, I'll have a look."
From the bed, "John?" Sherlock's voice was muffled and raspy, a far cry from the usual smooth speech.
And it had started very slowly. Back in the days when Sameer didn't even realise what kind of a relationship they were in.
Slowly, reluctantly, the boy shook his head in the negative and didn't raise his eyes at all. "I need to be with my papa."
I RSVPd for the med school reunion in Scotland. Mostly, I need a break from the mundane, routine. Brings back another timeslide ... I remember telling Ella once that nothing ever happens to me, and then beginning the blog with that very statement. Shortly after that, I met Sherlock. I'm not a superstitious person but I don't think I would ever recommend saying that again. Ever.
"If the power goes out, we'll just see how non-useful you think it is then." John snorted just a little. "If you don't care for it, you are free to leave." Sherlock made a pouty face. "No, seriously, if you don't like it and don't appreciate it, you can take your negativity and ... go away." Playfully, he gave him a gentle shove to the shoulder. "You could go upstairs, finish unpacking."
Responsive, at least, John thought with a little bit of relief. "What?" John though perhaps he'd mis-heard.
"I suspected as much. Let me know, then, and I will see to it."
Dental work:  If you need dental procedures (beyond cleaning) within 6 months from placement of the PFO closure device, it is recommended that you take a course of antibiotic therapy for 3 days prior to the procedure.
"Blood's running down the back of your throat. Spit it out so it doesn't make you sick."
The first memory, one of them anyway, is really thick fog. Detached. Being suffocated and absolutely panic stricken that Rosie needed me and i couldn't get to her and she was crying and calling and there was beeping from a siren which I now guess was a monitor alarm from event. No not event event. No a ventilator. Jesus Christ. And every time I heard her crying it was like torture and everything hurt and people were hurting me and hurting her and I couldn't get to her. And it kept happening. It was the hell of war and combat, I was needed to render aid but I was suffocating and then floating away again only to relive the nightmare. Until I heard Sherlock. His voice. It made absolutely no sense at all. And he was calm. It was like a voice in the storm. It was I can't even say how monumental hearing him was and it gave me focus. And he was telling me to settle down and breathe.
Behind Sameer's back, Molly's hand comes up to her own face to wipe away her tears. She resolutely does not look at the other adults and steels herself with another smile. It is as sweet as it is resolute.
"Piss off," John breathed, almost inaudibly.
Before there is more friction between them - in a very good way, John thinks - the hand off continues. Rob signals the IV pumps, confirming the heparin infusion that is infusing, the amount remaining, and they verify palpable pulses in all four extremities, that the dressing is dry over Sherlock's femoral access site, and ask if he needs anything.
Rather than actually laugh out loud, John exchanged a few pleasantries with the nurse, and eventually asked if there was any update for procedure start time.
"Fine." Though the tone and the delivery and the attitude seemed to imply that it was anything but.
The milestone is linked with further progress between the men who sleep downstairs, too, although it was not necessarily discussed or planned.
"What does your name mean papa?"
"Not really. You push his buttons, and it won't take much." Mycroft looked back steadily, so John clarified. "You excel at it. Both of you seem to thrive on it. In fact, there are times I'd wager that you love it."
John could feel his jaws clench, his radar on high alert, his protectiveness kick in to overdrive. "How long's this been going on, then, hmm?"
John cleared his throat again, pressing onward before Sameer asked anything else or picked up on Sherlock's rather obvious demeanor. "You can call him, if you want. Or when we get home, if you'd like, you could write something to him. A thank you note." John made the suggestion easily, and Sameer seemed to give it some consideration.
There was continuing discussion of provider preference of medications, from hydroxychloroquine to supplements such as quercetin and vitamins including C, D, and Zinc. Most of the staff rolled their eyes as political leaders offered unfounded, untried, unproven, and questionable medical advice, particularly in the news that kept coming from America. John and most of the physicians he worked alongside tended to suggest that vitamins, supplements, and the like fell into the "not harmful and possibly helpful" category. All the staff knew that the virus would be studied until the end of time, collated into large groups as research was assimilated, processed, and analysed.
There was an actual phone call when a fellow staff member was diagnosed, all without names of course. Although they social distanced as best they could, the surgical masks were not 100%. Staff was particularly at risk at mealtimes or when close for extended periods of time, such as during procedures or report.
Mycroft wouldn't have known the term in his youth, but he understood enough about it to recognise the uniqueness that he shared with his younger brother Sherlock. Of their relationship, their commonalities, their gifts. Blessed at birth with parents of unusual genetics - intelligence, wisdom, and the ability to embrace their children's needs - all he needed to do on some of those childhood days was to look at Sherlock, to see limitless potential in the eyes of his brother. They played, they fussed, they argued as they grew, and yet Mycroft was the only one who really understood Sherlock's frustration, his railing at the limitations of his youth or of his social ineptness. Of his being continually, pervasively misunderstood.
Two papers, no details, and a lot of questions.
John's mobile dings early, awakening him. His own night has been somewhat restless, wondering, itching for time to pass. Although he is fairly certain Sherlock would have been unable to make it all the way home without John hearing about it, he kind of listens with half an ear for the sounds of the front door. He has only called the nurses desk once, received the report that the room was quiet, Sherlock's telemetry monitor was still transmitting meaning that he had not eloped from the nursing unit, that the night was stable. That was hours ago. Now, it is still mostly dark out, and he squints at the incoming message. John knows that today is the day, that the tiny bit of patience Sherlock's had is fully expended. The game is most definitely on.
"Call me if you need," she said in parting. There was an intensity there, a serious nature of the request.
John recognised her immediately, one of the nurses he'd worked alongside the past few months, scrambled for her name. "Oh, yeah. Hello Carrie."
"Yes."
John glanced at Sherlock, then at Sam. "I have a request, though." Pause, explanations in Dari. "All communication tonight is to be done through your interpreter. Sonya, I know you and Sam could easily communicate in Dari, which is fine and probably easier for you, but understand that, as his father, my job is to make sure he's safe, happy. To ... protect him." Pause again, and John watched Sam listening intently to the relaying of the messages, smiling a little at the familiar sounding language. "To do that, I want to, I
"Oh, this has been awesome!" Rosie crooned, holding the mobile as she wrote her name in multiple colours inside the journal while wearing the new jewellery. "But you know what I'd really like for my birthday?" She hesitated, letting the adults really look at her, wondering. She could see that her
"I understand that tomorrow is the big day." Mycroft shakes his head no when John gestures at the chair, and John eases into it himself. Very few things should ever interrupt hot tea, morning caffeine, and he isn't about to wait longer than absolutely necessary. The first sip is warm and spreads through his chest, his arms, soothing and satisfying. Mycroft shuffles faintly on the balls of his feet, watching Sherlock do the same to his tea but not with the same reverence that John shows.
They'd agreed to let Rosie settle in before talking with her about not only Sherlock's medical experience but also the change in the dynamics of their relationship. And so, a few hours later, John pried himself from the couch and silently ascended the stairs to crawl into his own, cool, not recently used bed of his own. He didn't sleep too well.
"Me too." Although John seems ready to move on, Sherlock stays put, contemplative. He wears a small serious expression that morphs into a tender smile. "John?"
John wants to chuckle a little and does so. "I could ask you, things okay?" He is keeping his voice barely a whisper.
misunderstood. "And I'm sorry, for what it's worth, that doesn't sound like it was much fun for anyone." A moment stretched out between them, Sherlock finally pushing aside his contraption, and John smiled with abject approval at that choice. Then he took what he hoped was a teachable moment. "Just so we're clear: the cast is to stay on your leg, in its intact shape, one hundred percent of the time, until the physician has examined you at your next appointment, xrayed the leg, and determined that your treatment plan indicates you no longer need it. And then it is to be removed through proper channels by designated personnel only." John watched Sherlock's mind whirl about looking for loopholes, and sought to close up any remaining openings. "If there is any gray area remaining in what you know to be the purpose of the cast, the treatment of your injuries, your recovery, or anything else that you might try to get away with, you are to come to me and expressly ask permission about it." Sherlock's jaw clenched, but he kept quiet. "Do you understand?"
"Don't say his name." The snarl is quiet with a brokenness behind it.
And I hope I'm not reading into things but it certainly seems that there is some I don't know chemistry between us now. When he looks at me, there's something else now. Affection maybe. I think that I almost lost him again and I want. I want. I just I don't know how to say it I want.
"I'd like to
"Can I come back in the morning?"
Classes took a long weekend break and amidst the first few, large raindrops, he parked the car close as he dared to the front door, hoping to beat the impending heavy rain as he scurried inside. Ominous, heavy clouds and a metallic acrid scent in the air foretold of a thunderstorm coming, and John just barely beat the first popping raindrops as he closed the door behind him, noting again the faint hint of cigarette smoke outside the house. The view out the window was surreal as the dark storm mixed with the dark of sunset. The black line of clouds, the perfect set up of temperature drop, convergent winds, and barometric pressures brought heavy, pounding rain along with thunder, lightning, and fierce winds.
Dawn, Sherlock's nurse, a respiratory therapist, and another staff member guide the bed again, the halls, the lift, the turns becoming more familiar to John. He and Greg follow at a distance. Once they are in the lift, Dawn gives him a bit of an update. "So blood pressure's up a little, we see that when the body tries to do its own perfusion, you know, increases pressures in order to get the blood through. He got some pain meds, and we upped his sedation." She waits until John nods. "They already told you the stent is in, the arm, nice signals in his wrist, so that's great."
"I haven't, exactly. Simulation, several times. And I'm a third-year, so I've already done a lot of surgery."
So by the end of the day, the irritability is for some reason pronounced, and Sherlock declares that he has a splitting headache and disappears into the bedroom. John finishes a small amount of straightening up, tucks Rosie in for the night, and waits a bit before turning in himself. Sherlock tosses the moment he enters, his breathing and body movements all quite clearly conveying his displeasure. And that he is still awake.
"We lost a lot, I know. And I had other patients, on my many shifts. Some did great, went home. But not all, of course. Jack was ... special I guess." Shifting in the chair, she watched Rosie for a few moments. "He fought so hard. Up until the end."
Sam's twelve year old, slightly wobbly voice came from the top of the stairs. "Papa?" The word was faintly tremulous and quiet, then followed by a faint moan.
As expected, Sherlock immediately fled the room only to stop at the doorway of the nearest loo. Then, stepping inside, he brought the heels of both hands up toward his mouth, made a few loudly obnoxious raspberry noises into his wrists before leaving the entire first floor to his brother. He hoped the sounds had been especially nauseating and that it ruined his dinner. Heaven knew, the annoying older sibling of his needed to lose a few pounds.
"You're not coming?" John asks. "I mean, just to deliver him?"
Finally. Until this moment, John thinks, he hadn't realised how
"Four hundred. And one-fifty. Two of versed earlier." He gestured toward his work table. "I have more."
(See the end of the chapter for
"All right." He figured the tea was mostly gone already, and he could grab one of Mrs. Hudson's baked goods on the way out the door. "I suppose rushing now is okay, but later tonight? I'm taking my time with you." He turned toward Sherlock, his own hands sliding under Sherlock's tee shirt, reaching, hugging, feeling a bit of the urgency and simmering desire between them. The bed, fortunately, hadn't been made, and the sheets were still sleepy-warm and welcoming. With a slow and steady inhale, John tucked a knee onto the bed as he eased them down onto it.
Fitting. He would have snorted if he'd had the energy. As it was, he'd binned the useless, broken mug, tea remnants and all, and thought caustically about the parallel between the mug and his bloody life.
"I fail to see why this is any of your business."
"How often does this happen?"
This directive is for your eyes only. Of course, this caution applies to any and all correspondence, present and future.
"And the house?"
From the doorway comes another voice, from one of two people wearing green scrubs. "Before you get to that peace and quiet bit, I'd like to talk with you first. I work with Dr. Williams." He introduces himself, the man with him as the anaesthesiologist, and they stand close by the bed. "I'd like to talk with you about how I'm going to, with your permission, fix your PFO, that small hole between the upper chambers of your heart."
For a few moments, John waited him out, then asked, "Can I help you?"
Although the words were low-keyed, they ratcheted up Sherlock's posture again, eyes wide, almost pressing up on an elbow in protest. "You're okay. Relax if you can. I'm here. And they're letting me stay. Deep breath in, slowly. And when you breathe out, let your eyes close a little. And let your shoulders down as you exhale." John glanced over at where Allison was waiting, her hands folded in front of her, at the anaesthesiologist, who had another syringe already connected to Sherlock's IV. "They're giving you a little more medicine, it'll help you relax now." Nodding, John watched Sherlock try very hard to follow his directions, and watched the white medication in the syringe labeled 'propofol' puff into Sherlock's IV. "Sometimes this medicine stings a little, it just means it's working. You're doing amazing." It occurred to him he was a bit like a football announcer, calling a play-by-play.
