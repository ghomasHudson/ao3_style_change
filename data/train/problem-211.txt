, his knee hasn’t hurt like this since the weeks after he first tore it. The thought briefly crosses his mind to take advantage of being in a medical building, but he tamps it down. John is on his way, and for some reason that means he absolutely cannot be seen struggling, holding ice to his swollen leg as if that’s more pressing than Sherlock almost snapping his neck.
” Greg calls from the kitchen, as John shakes his head, steps back into the bathroom, and immediately sends a reply email profusely apologizing that they would not, in fact, be needing the translator after all, but would of course still pay for the inconvenience of cancelling so last minute.
Sonya lets it go as the cameraman holds up two fingers, presumably giving her the remaining time. She glances down at his legs with raised brows, and John feels a fiery burn through his right leg as his brain tries to scrunch his prosthetic toes in his boot.
John wants to return the medal. Go back in time and never put on skis that morning. Never arrive in Korea in the first place. Never go to that stupid lodge in his stupid monoski and let that stupid maniac push him down the hill. He wants to lie flat on his back again in the snow, holding up a snapped pole, and
-In case you don't know already, you need to know before you read that the Paralympics is usually held about a month *after* the Olympics as a completely separate event. As you might (unfortunately) expect, it's not nearly as attended or televised, and the host country often has to build separate courses, facilities (both depending on the sport) and accommodations for Paralympians. There is also an enormous funding gap between the two, for both the event itself and for the athletes (in terms of gear, coaching, sponsorships, etc.). You'll see the big changes I've made to this existing system in the chapter below.
First time I kissed him, little one, I . . . well, it was Water Walkin’ Jesus. It was the miracle of my own heart beating without me even needing to remind it to pump the blood. It was like the first time I ever rode a horse, or swam through water, or took a breath. Maybe you can understand.
He looks up. The rest of the studio returns with a great clap of color and speed. Sonya is trying not to stare at John’s hand on his leg, barely suppressing her glee. Rick is trying to give a secret signal to the cameraman, confirming that they’re zooming in on the sight. The HD screen is displaying tweet after tweet of support for John’s win and their kiss using the hashtag #lovewongold.
He doesn’t even really remember what he says in response when Maxine and Ron throw endless thanks at him again once they’re seated in the very front row of of the disability seating with a limitless view. The snow is so close up it nearly burns his eyes.
John snorts under his breath and grins down at his bare feet sinking into the sand as they join Greg and Sherlock standing quietly on the shore. Sherlock immediately reaches for him and pulls him close to his side by the waist, kissing the side of his head without hesitation. The plain, blatant fact of it makes John’s heart dance in his chest. He wants to call up to the heavens for somebody up there to take a picture of them all. Of John standing on the beach of his home in front of his two closest friends with Sherlock Holmes effortlessly pressing his lips into his hair. Of him breathing easy and open with the  warm weight of Sherlock’s wedding gift hanging around his neck and over his chest, protected by the thin navy fabric of his shirt.
Sherlock nods. What he really wants is to turn over and hold John’s face in his hands and swear to him that absolutely nothing is about to change tomorrow. That they will still be
Lahela smiles, but her eyes are sad. “Yes, your brother is well,” she says. She pauses and licks her lips, then goes on, still turning back awkwardly at the edges of the beach. “He’s going to UC Berkeley in the fall. For engineering.” Then she smiles once more, glances one last time at John, and turns to keep walking towards the palm tree-lined road.
‘Course he may never actually give the darn things to Wilma. Journals with pages filled up to the brim may all just be permanently lost on the day we both die (We’re always saying that these days—gonna be all or nothing, neither one of us or both of us together. Morbid as a fresh grave on a wedding day, Alma Jr. would probably say. But then again, I’ve already died the once. I’m allowed to make my own rules about the second time).
A raspy, off-screen laugh: “That, and even more time spent arse-deep in snow, if you added it all up.”
Greg nods. “That is how I have learned my lesson. I cannot . . . I cannot ignore what is painful. I cannot only see the parts of John that I want to see. Or of you.
I think one last time of my shaking, wrinkled hand signing the paper that said “I, John Watson, choose not to Stay in Time when I die. I choose to fade from the earth into nothing.” Think of how I remembered the color of Catherine’s eyes as I signed it. How I knew I wouldn’t see those eyes in Time. Not ever again.
Then, through a purposefully un-focused camera lens, we see the blurry outline of the patient’s chest slowly rise, then fall on its own. It looks like a tiny spasm.
“I need to sleep. Take some water and you can kip in your truck,” I say. He nods like he was expecting that, takes a warm bottle of water from the little countertop and leaves after lookin’ at me one last time. I watch him through the window walk back slowly to his truck. He leans his head on the door for a long time before climbing in and folding up his long legs on the seat.
I picture Sherlock racing through a rodeo ring on a jet black horse, mind going crazy doing all his calculations and bullshit and the crowd going wild, the lights flashing and his Stetson shining and the sweat rolling down his forehead into his eyes. I picture him pocketing his prize money with a firm handshake and walking away from all the crowds and flashing lights, going back to whatever hotel he’s crouchin’ in in bumfuck nowhere with nothin’ to do but sit all alone until he’s back up on a horse for the next night. No one to tell him he was a goddamn genius, not just some failed cowboy who got lucky with a length of rope.
Sherlock is alone out on the water. Gasping for breath with a burn in his arms and limbs, shaking with exhaustion since he already battled through these waves once not even an hour ago to help Dickie. Sherlock tears his eyes away from Hank pushing through the breaking waves and looks out towards the horizon. The vastness of the sea suddenly looms before him with a moan. He can hear the empty groaning of the void across the surface of the ocean, stretching out to infinity with no break in sight. No people, or whispered words, or family, or jobs, or money, or competitions on crowded beaches.
to surf against someone still in the qualifiers,” Kip interrupts. “Like the surfing Mother Theresa. If that doesn’t scream hidden goddamn motive I don’t know what does. Probably just wants to see someone get crushed.”
I follow her inside, embarrassed as she takes a quick look around the near empty space. She sits on the little foldout bed while I stoop into the tiny kitchen area and put on some coffee.
“God, take it.” John feels another groan from Sherlock’s throat radiate through his body and pushes his head farther down onto his erection. “Fucking
“That doesn’t mean he hadn’t touched a surfboard before then,” Sherlock cuts in. He can read in every inch of John’s body that he’s listening. Intently. The clock ticks down to thirty more seconds before the airhorn, and Sherlock feels absolutely desperate. He hasn’t said enough. Hasn’t done enough. Hasn’t told John Watson what he fiercely needs him to know.
“Course I’m nervous,” he says in a half-whisper, and Greg carefully keeps his gaze away from John’s shaking hand. “And I
Sherlock shakes his head and fights down a sickening roll through his stomach. His eyes flicker to John, alive and breathing and gazing out over the snow like this mountain belongs to him, like this mountain should bloody recognize that it has Group Captain Olympic
And God, John is lying in the arms of this gorgeous man—a man who can powerfully soar across the snow like the most graceful, beautiful thing John’s ever seen. The man who looked at John nervously sitting alone on the side of a mountain, watching the normal skiers all whoop down the slope without him. The man who skied right up to him, his free curls flying in the wind, and said, “
to feel guilty and resent the whole thing—the rescue and the touch of Greg’s hands, the words he whispered to him in the snow.
He finds a spot in some shade at the base of a tree and sits to wait it out, trying to look as simultaneously intimidating and invisible as possible. He breathes in the sea air and tries to calm himself over the next couple hours watching the beach slowly come to life – as the surfers start warming up out in the waves, and the announcers start going over the day’s match-ups. He watches John stretch his left calf muscle over and over again. Keeps constantly searching for a golden blond head moving throughout the sea of tanned bodies and native Hawaiians, bobbing among the other surfers warming up in the massive swells. John looks tense. He can see it from a mile away. It takes all of Sherlock’s willpower to stay where he is, to just let John be. The best thing he could possibly do for him at a surfing event in Oahu is stay as far away from him as possible. The raw truth of that hurts somewhere deep and unfamiliar in his chest.
John’s eyelids flutter open, squinting into the dark, and then he gasps, and Sherlock is suddenly thrown head first across the bed, then man-handled in a single breath onto his back, his arms pinned to the mattress and John’s elbow pressing hard on his neck.
I look at them. Look at them and nothing else exists. The mattress beneath me is a pool of soft water, warm and clean on my skin. I want to sink.
,” Greg murmurs, in that same far-away sounding voice he’d used at the bottom of the course. Sherlock watches him hold John impossibly tighter. “You needed him.”
Sherlock takes another sip of his beer out on the porch and nods, bringing his knees up to his chest.
Sherlock thumbs at the dripping slit of John’s penis beneath the rippling ocean, causing the water to cloud with small drips of precome leaking from the tip. Sherlock breathes in deeply against John’s back, pressing into his spine, then looks down over John’s shoulder at his own hand on John’s cock and groans out loud. John grabs frantically at Sherlock’s thighs as Sherlock goes on, voice breathless.
We stare at each other, and I feel that I’m missing something critical passing between us. Then he kisses my forehead for a very long time before lying back down on my chest, my arms around him.
“Hm, but that was ages ago. You, you are still the soldier. You could still be fitting in your uniform.”
Interviewer: “Ah, so some of the mystery is revealed, now. One more piece of the puzzle of Sherlock Holmes.”
Edit: I forgot in the first posting to say THANK YOU to everyone who has left such kind encouragement for this fic! I can't tell you the number of times this past week I'd be scrolling through idly on Tumblr and suddenly see someone mentioning "Gimme Shelter." I can't tell you how my heart bursts each time that happens :) I'm grateful, I'm a little speechless, and I'm pumped to get working on the next chapter.
Then Greg collapses in John’s arms, smearing the semen across their bellies, and he gives one of his best groans to date.
Greg’s throat briefly burns as John sends a careful look his way—both at the fact that John is still consciously thinking of him that way, as well as the fact that John apparently felt the need to say it out loud in the first place. As if everyone else in the room had already forgotten. Even Greg.
There’s a quick meeting with Aguirre back in the white metal trailer when we get back. He ain’t happy about the loss numbers, but considering we is right pissed about losin’ a month of work we all seem to call it even. He gives Sherlock a long hard look through the slits of his eyes before we both walk out, and something deep in my chest starts thumpin’ like mad thinking that maybe Aguirre knows something he oughtn’t to.
I see them again, year after year. They get darker, deeper, more red and black. I never once come after him.
Because it really had been a failure, hadn’t it? He’d just effortlessly achieved the highest degree possible in the life category of How to Burn Your Relationship to the Ground. He would have won the Gold Medal in the sport of Fostering a Breakup in under Five Seconds.
He grins in the corner of his mouth, a sad grin, and I know he’s thinkin’ the same thing. Then his lips shake, and I watch helpless as something crumbles on his face. Something I last saw that night he ran out to me across the fields, after I’d taken a walk all day, and he’d thought I’d up and left him without even a word. It rips through my core, steals the breath out from my lungs.
That day I first ever held you in my arms. You was the first baby I ever met, did you know? The very first one. You was crying up a storm, not settling for anyone, and your momma placed you in my arms, trusting as the sun, and you stared up at me and quieted like the whisper of the dawn wind. The way it used to hush against the sides of the pup tent your granddaddy and I used to share.
Sherlock stares at him. Miraculously, before his very eyes, there is a new Greg Lestrade before him, and it takes his breath away. It is like a part of Greg had been in darkness, all these years, and Sherlock had never noticed—not until this moment when he stepped in the light.
He sees only John Watson, who looks back at Sherlock with such steadfast focus that Sherlock wants to say “fuck it” and race back into shore as fast as he can. Abandon his board in the shallows and run to John and cup his face in his hands and tell him that saying
The camera cuts to Kuznetsov holding his head in his hands, looking down at the snow and breathing hard.
Everything stops, and they face off. I think the stranger’s going to say something menacing and growl. “Put ‘em up and surrender!” he’ll yell. “We’ve got you cornered, kid. The game’s up!”
The indignation rushes back. “It wasn’t like that . . . I haven’t just been . . . I’m perfectly capable of remaining in shape over two days’ worth of inaction . . . Food isn’t as important as . . . And how do you know whether I wasn’t showing up to the practices you decided to ignore? You sent me a single email and never bothered to check if I’d seen it! Never asked where I was!”
When I finally sink down in my chair with a groan she sinks to her knees beside me, brushing sweat-soaked thin hair back from my forehead.
We had Chinese food after that, and watched a Bond film so that Sherlock could pick it apart scene by scene and make me double over in laughter, and then disappeared into the city in the dead of night, sticking to the hidden pavements and passages that only Sherlock knows, where only the two of us existed, far away from prying eyes and unfamiliar voices.
She smirks at me and winks. I feel the wink sail right past my shoulder, missing my skin – its mark. “I remember my first Visit here,” she says. She leans forward onto the bar, and I know I’m supposed to take a look at her breasts. I do for a second, let my eyes flicker just over the curves of her nipples beneath her shimmering, tight silver shirt. But then I think how this stranger’s breasts are just slightly rounder than
I think of Sherlock Holmes slamming the door in my face. I think of him hiding now – Time Jumping. Thinking that he can pretend he didn’t almost press his mouth to mine. Thinking he can pretend he didn’t breathe life into my dead veins. Resurrect me.
John’s shoulders are shaking. He grips the back of Sherlock’s neck with his palm. Greg presses his hip into the counter until it stings and tries to focus on the fact that everyone is
She waits until I’ve caught my breath before speaking softly, just so that no one else can hear. “You yelled out something about ducking for cover on the balcony,” she says. “Do you remember?”
And John had closed his eyes, and stepped forward on two legs of muscle and bone as he inhaled the snow and pine, and he’d kissed the boy whose shirtless poster he once kept hidden on the inside of his closet door at his third foster home.
.” He looks to John, who looks like he’s been trying to fade back into the snow, in that way he’s always done. But Greg cannot lose him. Not now. This is the whole point. He needs them both to hear. Greg shuffles closer. “Listen. I have never told you, either of you, what exactly my parents have said to me. Before they left.”
I can see him sometimes out there, when the curtain of mist clears up enough. He’s just a dark figure moving out all alone across the sea of blue-green fog. Sometimes I imagine he looks up and sees me as a little spark of warm fire – the promise of food and hot leather boots to come slowly make his way back to when the loneliness has seeped into his skin and made him feel like wet brown paper. I can’t tell who would benefit more from him feeling that way.
John sucked in a breath and stared speechless, hovering at the edges of the crowd. He felt like he’d entered a time machine – doomed to stand frozen like a statue while he viewed a scene from his past life in Los Angeles. Stood there gaping until someone came up and handed him a lukewarm beer, and another laughed and said
He has so many ideas, so many grand plans that fill up the words coming out his mouth like honey and gold, but this one sounds more ridiculous than them all.
“Kurt and I . . . we’re gettin’ married,” she says. She looks up at me from under her eyelashes and waits for me to say something, anything.
“Er, no. He . . . he isn’t my coach year-round. It was just for that bit of training, once I knew I’d qualified for Pyeongchang. I’m . . . I’m just here on my own.”
I can’t fuck this up. Everything he’s worked for, everything he’s made himself into – I feel it all rides on how I handle this conversation. For Sherlock to ever be able to walk back into a room or a crime scene and work with the Yard again after this, and to feel that he is still respected (and feared, envied, loathed, what have you) as Sherlock Holmes the detective, the genius, the
Scotty runs his fingers through his curls and opens his mouth twice before speaking. “Would you – do you want to see the island tomorrow? The competition isn’t for two days and you’ll just be here with nothing to do and I thought that maybe . . . well there’s this road we can drive down that people think is scenic, and I have a Jeep, or there’s good spots to swim, or I can tell you where you should go check out, or –”
“I had to tell him,” Sherlock says robotically, his eyes fixed on the spot John disappeared. “It couldn’t wait. He needed to know before tomorrow.”
But of course it’s cold. Nearly every day of his entire adult life has been cold, aside from that decade or so spent out in the middle of the smoking desert, and even then, at night, the way the cold wind would snarl across the shifting sands, and the ice would seem to drip down from the endless blankets of stars . . .
He stares at the metal in his palm and tries to think of the memories it always invokes. The ones that keep him up at night, and remind him that there must be some godforsaken reason he survived, and whisper in his ear that he should put off walking out into the sea for one more day. Just one more day. And one more.
He hadn’t seen Greg, not even a hint of silver hair in the sun, or a flash of sunglasses, but he’d known instantly that he was there, too, as if the air itself perked up and suddenly smelled of spearmint. Sherlock had never felt so torn in his life—his attention stretched to its limit between watching every hair on John’s precious, beautiful, golden head as he bent to receive his medal, and simultaneously wanting to destroy the podium, smash every camera, chase everyone away until he could find Greg Lestrade left alone somewhere in the grandstands and sink to his knees, beg him for forgiveness, kiss his feet.
“I’ve checked outside,” Sherlock finally murmurs. “There’s nobody out there, no cameras. It appears Super-Greg’s fans don’t realize he’s been here in London instead of France for three days.”
The blood drains from his cheeks, his mouth hanging stupidly open in shock. It’s humiliating; he feels naked in front of the world, all eyes on him when they should be on—
John closes his eyes. He can still hear it over the fire ripping through his helicopter. The rough crack of the blades exploding. His own voice screaming curses into his headset, his composure gone.
Watson, roughly: “They . . . they tell you to learn your gut, in the army. To trust what you feel . . .”
My skin is old, and my hair is thin and grey, and I look like I’m a little kid wearing his father’s suit.
It’s the first time we’ve ever hugged. First time touching face-to-face and upright. My cheek fits perfectly in the crook of his neck. When I finally pull back for air my nose brushes against his. He’s leanin’ down over me to hold me, to get closer, like I’ll fit right neat inside his body if he could just wrap his hands around me tight enough. The spell grabs me with both fiery hot hands and yanks me down to the deepest pit of hell. I look out over the empty parking lot and grab him by the front of his vest, forcing him backwards and steppin’ on his toes until I have him pressed up against the wall of the little walkway to the trash bins. I kiss him so hard I can feel his teeth cutting into my lips. He gives a little cry in the back of his throat, and I can taste it coming off his tongue. My palms glide across the stubble on his cheeks and his body melts against me until we’re one like braided rope. He pulls my face back away from his and I let myself look straight into his eyes, glittering diamond pools blown wide and shining over with water.
“I feel like I’m waiting for you to pop a dog treat in my mouth,” I say through my wheezing, shaking my head at myself.
But something’s not right. Something is off. Something about the way John’s holding him closer than he ever does when they’re falling asleep, something about the tightness in his voice, the close breath from his mouth . . .
Sherlock Holmes is gone – completely subsumed by Scotty’s puffed chest and high chin and slicked back curls. John stands there in shock – tries and utterly fails to picture this man’s hands on him, falling asleep with his nose tucked into the crook of John’s neck, holding him by the shore as he wept, cupping his palm to John’s cheek just an hour ago in a Jeep pulled over to the side of the road. It’s equal parts fascinating and heartbreaking. John stares at the dichotomy until feels almost sick to his stomach watching the charade he’d once gazed upon with breathless, shivering awe. He watches open-mouthed as the spectators part before Scotty effortlessly gliding across the sand, aviator-covered eyes staring straight ahead at the booming waves.
Holmes, not unkindly: “Well, since you’re being so insufferable about it, and since I expect you will not give up your efforts, I’ll answer a question from yesterday. I was dragged here on a ski trip with my parents when I was thirteen. Utterly miserable. Pointless and boring. My brother loved it.”
It was hand built from extra Army supplies – wood painstakingly sanded down and covered in cheap Army issue wax. A big white peace sign painted on its belly.
They’d all sat on the living floor in the dusk light, wordlessly agreeing not to sit on the furniture. And John had told them, with painful slowness, about the first day he ever tried to walk on his new leg. About gripping the standing bars, sweat dripping down his face, and the nurse rolling in front of him on a stool to hold his waist steady, telling him, “
“Well it’s important to know what waters he’s surfed on before! You can’t just walk out there totally ignorant!”
, three bloody months I have been begging you to wear the glasses, and suddenly John is home for seven hours and you wear them?”
John has no idea what to say. He stands there stunned, bag still lying at his feet. “Word travels fast,” he finally grunts out.
It's not important to the ultimate plot whether you can fully picture and understand John's process of getting on his normal-walking-around prosthesis, but if you're curious and want to have a mental image, I used
But I stayed, and let him lead me into his bedroom, what I knew instantly to be our bedroom now, and learned all through the night what it meant to make love to someone, body to body and soul to soul.
Sherlock hums, warm tingles dripping down his neck and back at the feeling of John’s fingers running slowly through his hair. He feels hotly embarrassed now about his sleepless nights standing alone by the waves, not knowing that John was at that very moment finding his way back to him for good.
I feel anything but brave, but I decide on the truth. “Sherlock knows I signed the paper not to Stay,” I say quietly. “He wanted –” I swallow hard. “He wanted me to Stay with him.”
“What will I do with the two of you,” Greg mutters to himself up ahead of them, just as Sherlock jumps to feel John’s arm suddenly around his back, and John’s warm mouth up near his ear, whispering, “You always were a genius, you know.”
He clears his throat twice and reaches up to hold Sherlock’s hand against his face. “How do you always know what to say to me? We haven’t even known each other a month.”
He bends his knees deeper and sucks in a breath, fighting like hell to reach the bottom without flying off into the spray, bucked from his board. He hears the wave crash in a screaming roar behind him, feels the slapping rush of spray and foam slam at his back with the force of a moving train. It shoots him forward like a rocket across the surface of the water, blinding him in a cloud of whitewater that slaps at his bare skin and burns in his eyes. He can’t tell if he’s up on his board or hurtling through the water. If he’s breathing in oxygen or salt. If he’s traveling towards the shore or being sucked back down into the claws of the deep.
Sherlock’s chest rises with a deep breath, straining the lycra. It falls. Then rises again. Again and again.
I can’t say anything back. My whole body’s trembling beneath him like a leaf in a strong wind. His steady fingers flick open my belt and zipper, and he pulls. He groans deep in his throat when he sees my dick full and hot by his hips. I try to reach up and get his Levi’s off but I can’t. My fingers tangle up over each other into knots and I can’t catch a full breath to save my life. I realize I ain’t never taken off someone else’s jeans before, not even his.
“John,” Sherlock says, struggling to keep up, trying not to let the panic show in his voice. “They didn’t force me to come in at all. I . . . I offered to—”
Holmes, tilting his head: “Well done, past me. I don’t even remember saying that, was too insufferably cloudy on the pain meds J— my doctor kept insisting I take.”
The feeling of John’s hands on his bare skin, just five minutes away from a beach full of people, sends a fiery thrill through Sherlock’s core. He feels John’s thick and hot desire suddenly pressed into the dip of his hip, thinks of the way John’s thighs had bulged as he clung to his board and soared across the face of the wave, and in a rush of pure desire Sherlock reaches down for the underside of those thighs and lifts John up against the wall, thrilling as John wraps his legs around his waist without hesitation and grinds Sherlock’s body into himself.
They all shake hands; a dizzying jumble of “thank you”s and “good luck”s and “it was our pleasure,”—”no really, it was ours!”
—has inspired an entire generation of French kids to take up competitive skiing just because he wore a French flag about his shoulders all those unstoppable years he won Gold. All the way up until that last Sochi run.
John hasn’t texted Sherlock something curse-filled in what feels like weeks. Sherlock misses it desperately.
He looks over at me like he’s afraid of what I’ll say. We ain’t never said anything like that to each other before – always kept it unspoken, under lock and key. Now he’s gone and said it and I find my mouth can’t push out any words back to him. I leave his words hangin’ in the air with no answer.
He glimpses the outline of John’s metal knee through his snow pants and feels that horrifying, shameful twist of
But John does hear it. And he feels the ghostly press of Sherlock’s lips against his forehead as a shiver sends its way down his spine, tattooing the words onto the veins beneath his skin.
Greg can’t remember the last time he heard John sound this defeated. He shoots Sherlock a quick glance, which Sherlock immediately returns, his eyes full of concern.
“Of course it’s not simple. But you’ve got a man who says he fucking loves you, and you’ve got a bank account full of prize money because you’re a fucking professional ass surfer, and you’ve got a best friend who thinks you’re an absolute moron for not getting the hell out of here. Tell me one reason why you aren’t back on a plane right now.”
Lips meet again, and again, and again, long sighs into one another’s mouths, across two open tongues, and Sherlock can practically taste them on his own parted lips, and his tongue rolls in his own mouth, and his fingertips silently clutch the sheets, and he can
away from them all in the sand, one hand clasped up to his face, the other one covered in blood. Running away from Dean’s calls.
He refuses to feel embarrassed for asking something so inane, so childish after everything Greg has just confessed. Deep down, he’s always known that these are the last words Greg ever expected to hear, and yet the most yearned for. Guilt burns in John’s chest at the fact that Greg’s heart has been chasing after something so simple and so small, with no promise of reward.
He follows me at a safe distance into the trailer. I feel his eyes on me every second like he can’t look away. I sit down silently in the wooden chair and nod at the bed. His legs are too long for it, and his knees end up ‘round his chest. I keep waiting to wake up, to blink and open my eyes and see that I’m just sitting in an empty, silent trailer same as always.
Just then they reach Sherlock, who’s turned to greet them, hands stuck in his pockets and shoulders slightly slumped, like he’s trying to make himself look smaller in the air. Greg grows quiet as they approach, and John feels sudden nerves churn in his gut. He feels like he needs to say something. Somehow bridge the gap between the two halves of his life suddenly clashing together in the sand. He opens his mouth to try to speak, hands clammy and awkwardly clearing his throat. Then Sherlock reaches out a hand before John can say anything and Greg takes it in a firm and silent handshake, sharing a quiet look that makes John’s chest ache to witness. Sherlock turns to take Molly’s hand then, leaning down to kiss her cheek. John gapes, mouth wide open. He’s barely seen Sherlock shake another person’s hand before, let alone this. He burns the image into his memory, hiding it deep in his mind.
He leaves the meeting after a final handshake with Corporal Johnson with a very important signed piece of paper in his hand, then goes back to his room to change in a sort of slow-motion daze. He sets the very important signed piece of paper down on his bed. His roommate, an LW-6 from Mexico who only briefly nodded at John the night before, is gone.
And apparently John Watson thought Sherlock’s traditionally long shower was the perfect time to tell Greg that he texted Sherlock that afternoon. He told him when and where and why. He probably told him what they said. He
When John had imagined this moment—the morning of his prelims spent preparing his gear, warming up his body—he’d expected it to feel just like any other race, no great weight on his shoulders. The real work—the work of Sherlock’s Gold—would have already been done, and Greg and Sherlock would both be relaxed, and they could all treat John’s race as a day off, of sorts. A victory lap. An excuse to spend the day in the sunshine and fresh air.
and when the Lieutenant shoved him off the top of the diving platform into the freezing cold, chlorinated pool and he thought he was gonna die of fear before his back hit the water.
He saw my thoughts in the air between us, whispered my name right before he pressed his lips against mine, there in the shadow of the place where I thought my heart had been buried forever.
Greg, in his headset: “Should take a few pictures. It’s too late in the day for the police to get here. They’ll want photos of the scene.”
When Sherlock knocks softly and sneaks inside ten minutes later he’s got a bag full of what smells like ham sandwiches. I notice he didn’t get any alcohol. He must’ve read that on me in the five seconds I stood dumbfounded on the stairwell landing. He sees me looking at the bag and tosses it down on the little wooden side table without a glance. In five seconds he dead bolts the door and throws the blinds shut tight.
I shut my eyes and breathe in a lungful of his scent. Feel awash in how familiar it is in my bones. Just like it’s always been there hiding. Waiting for me to tear off the veil with gentle fingers. He is as familiar to me as the fresh, young skin I first saw when I looked down at my hands in the alleyway in the moonlight. And as bittersweet as the color of Catherine’s eyes before they closed.
He hadn’t meant to say that. He really hadn’t meant to. But now that it’s out and open Sherlock’s chest practically roars for a fight, gunning to let off some of the weight left behind by having to watch John’s fingers graze the naked skin at the base of Greg’s fucking perfect tan neck.
Pleasure rolls down Sherlock’s spine, rearranging his internal organs until they are perfect and right and aligned. A familiar rush of gratitude tugs faintly in Sherlock’s chest, and he dances his fingertips across John’s shivering thighs, unable to find any words except his own touch.
An awkward silence falls over the call, and John wonders if the soft rushing sound he can hear on the other end is the sound of James Sholto breathing. The world continues to hum and churn around him, spectators taking advantage of the break to swarm the restrooms and concession stands, calling across the crowds to get the attention of family and friends and rubbing their hands together with dramatic moans to try and stay warm.
John swallows hard and nods, hating that he was so affected by a mere two fucking seconds of not knowing where Sherlock was. He feels young and helpless. “I know that. I know. I just thought –”
Greg gives himself a good mental shake. “That’s when I knew,” he tries to tell Sherlock over the crowd. “That John was . . . he was my—”
Sherlock suddenly leans down so his forehead is pressed into John’s back, draping himself over John’s body with his curls fanning out across his skin.
“And there’s not some life-saving pedal you’ll be unable to press with your plastic right foot in case of emergency?”
The snow reflects so fiercely in the Canadian’s goggles that they look pure white. John wonders how Greg feels now that the competition has officially started—that terrifying, teetering moment right before pushing off from the top of a run, unable to stop or turn back once the poles strike the ice. But then again, he’s rather used to all this, John suspects. The nerves and the anxiety and the entirety of your life’s work all coming down to one run on skis. And this is only the prelims. And Sherlock handles pre-race nerves like he’s simply bored waiting for a cup of tea to steep.
He’s interrupted by the blare of the alarms behind us back in the hangar. Without finishing his sentence, Greg leaps to his feet, rips off the mic, and sprints back to the helipad. A mechanic runs out to meet him, holding out his bag and helmet. We run to keep up.
John sweeps his first heat. Annihilates it, in fact. The other three surfers didn’t even stand a chance.
They all wait in silence. It isn’t until the doctor clears his throat again, looking between Greg and John, that Greg realizes he’s waiting for them to leave for patient privacy. But just as he tries to catch John’s eye, Sherlock sighs.
The first time it happens, Sherlock doesn’t even look at him or ask for his time. He knows internally, just as Greg has perfected his own internal clock, and so they don’t need to communicate. Sherlock simply grits his teeth, pulls down his black skull bandana to spit once into the snow, then glides back to the chairlift so he can do it again.
He steps back into the shadows under the grandstands and leans his head on a metal beam. Feels familiar invisibility wash over him; the comfort of being alone in a crowd; the muffled quiet.
“Ah fuck off, you’ll jinx it. If anything I’ll be blowing a kiss to your Margot, not your sorry arse. Kiss and a wink.”
John sighs, averting his eyes from Sherlock’s naked body and looking out across the waves. “We’re still in fucking public!”
John lets out a breathless laugh and holds on tighter to the wooden chair back under his hand. “Of course you did,” he says under his breath. His eyes flick over to a small side table, only one photograph on top of it. Besides the surfboard it’s the only personalized thing in the room. He’s drawn to it like a magnet, quickly stepping across the wooden floor. A young curly-haired boy looks back at him, shit-eating grin over his whole freckled face. A woman crouches behind him and holds him around the middle, eyes bright behind huge cat-eye glasses with a smile that’s just barely forming on her lips. There’s a row of military jets behind them, lined up on hot white cement and asphalt. Before he realizes what he’s doing John picks up the framed photograph in his hands. There’s writing just along the bottom in a long, feminine scrawl, and he squints hard to read it.
“We’re signing off with John Watson, for team Great Britain. On behalf of NBC-International, we hope that any young amputee skiers at home can see the hope in this incredible athlete’s drive and bravery. You truly
“It’s boring of you to be so literal. I might leave you for someone else more desirable in the stands.”
Nurse Hooper finishes her swallow and sets her cup down. She seems to be at war with herself. She bites her lip, then finally says, “Yes, I think he’d want you to know.”
And I wonder what in hell we must look like, two grown men clinging to bare skin, as I press my lips to his curls and whisper again, “Alright now, I got you.”
“Johnny, I’ve been looking for you!” Molly looks flushed, like she ran to him across the beach. “You know your round is in fifteen minutes?”
I think a lot these days about when and how Sherlock and I first got together. Not in a ‘first meeting’ sense – although I think a lot about that, too. How easy it would have been for me to take a different path through that park and not run into Mike, or how I could have been just a tad too grumpy that day and rubbed Sherlock the wrong way so that he didn’t extend the flatshare invitation. How I could have already ended it all without every knowing what was waiting for me just around the corner.
John watches Greg jog back to his circle of friends in the sand, the warmth in the pit of his gut slowly fading with each step Greg takes away from him, then he keeps his head low and slinks through the crowds up towards the bluff by the pier so he can change in the shade of a palm tree trunk. He leaves the top half of his wetsuit hanging down around his waist beneath his t-shirt and ventures over to the packed boardwalk. His feet just lead him there. He has no idea why.
Sherlock and Greg both softly frown as John turns and walks back to Walter, who’s looking at him with undisguised curiosity.
He kissed me, then. A fierce, passionate kiss. We hadn’t kissed like that in weeks. It took my breath away, feeling him sigh into my mouth as his warm tongue rushed inside, dancing with mine. Suddenly we were back in time to a year ago – just the two of us snogging in our bathroom, unable to keep our hands off of each other, unable to break apart for breath. I moaned into him, tasted his lips as he whispered my name over and over and over. I looked up into his eyes, still rimmed with red, and I couldn’t help the smile that broke out across my face.
Slowly he came out of it, his eyes never leaving mine. I could feel the air around us shift, losing its electric charge and settling into a floral sigh, like heavy wet moss laying its blanket down on the earth. We looked into each other, sought reassurances both, and without thinking I slowly started to trace my fingers down across his chest, down towards his nipples, down towards his stomach. It wasn’t sexual. It was salvation.
introduce myself,” John says, looking the frozen kid straight in the eye. “Group Captain John Watson. Great Britain. Paralympic Biathlon. Pleasure to meet you, and best of luck. Same to you both.”
“Believe me, Greg here has already shared every emotion he could possibly have on the matter while you were still clamoring your way in here. Took you a bit of time to get here, didn’t it? Since it appears you thought yourself too worthy to sit in the ADA seating up front, no? You could’ve gotten here much faster if you hadn’t been stuck trying not to trip on fifty bleachers.”
“Waimea Bay’s holding a big wave surf contest the week after Billabong. One that I fully intend to win. I’d be an idiot to waste all my strength trying to get a prize I’ve already won twice.”
He thinks of lifeless black eyes covered by long hair lying still on the floor of a wet and steaming jungle, pumping out gurgling blood into the screaming void. Remembers the terrifying, nauseating fear that had coursed through his body two seconds after the world had exploded, and the feeling of his lips moaning out the word “mom” into the shattering gunfire.
“There he is!” someone from the press yells, and hundreds of cameras flash as Sherlock suddenly comes into view on the course, a pinprick speeding across the ice impossibly fast, like his body’s been dropped from the sky, heading for the third-to-last gate.
, he is lucky. He thinks of his life in one great swoop, images from all over the world flashing before his eyes in a blaze, and it all culminates in this, in a quiet slope of French snow, two men beside him, their cheeks turning pink.
Everything changes. The air around them crackles and fizzles with heat. John stares down at his board and thinks he’s going to vomit. His limbs shake, and his gut clenches, and he feels his vision greying out around the edges.
Sherlock kisses him again, licking the tips of his lips with his tongue. He pulls off his own shirt, mind racing. There aren’t enough words in the English language to convince John Watson that Sherlock has never wanted anyone,
Sam: “But yeah, I mean, the guy is right. We are all a family, however you want to look at it, in whatever way. You just have to be, in this place. So, yeah, we are family.”
And that’s when Sherlock realizes that he is the world’s biggest idiot. Because his eyes suddenly focus, and the hazy fog of indignant hurt clears from his mind in the salty breeze, and he sees that John Watson is not, in fact, lounging back on his hand and laughing like it’s the only way he knows how to breathe. Instead John’s entire body is tense, the smile on his lips is stale and fixed, and the hand pressing back into the warm sand is slowly, ever so slowly, pushing him up to stand.
Greg glances at Sherlock’s fingers clutching the fork as it creates a mountain of rice. “Are you looking at yourself?”
Who didn’t deserve to be hugging an ex-drug addict to his chest while that ex-drug addict was busy trying to make sure he remembered every line of a news article about an ex-RAF pilot who was confusing and unknown and and terrifying and
John flutters awake behind his eyelids, feeling bleary and sated and heavy. He stretches his tongue in his mouth and drowsily wonders how much longer he’s got until his alarm will go off to wake up if he wants enough time to go surfing with Greg before work. His ears fixate on the rolling sound of the ocean, waves cutting through fresh dawn air and pouring their pools of cool froth over the virgin sand. It sounds closer than it usually does – more steady and consuming and insistent. John takes a deep breath in and smells the hint of salt in the air, carried on a bed of blooming flowers.
Greg pats John’s chest in silent warning before stepping back from him, moving to turn down the sheets on the queen-sized bed as if he didn’t just learn anything revolutionary at all. As if he doesn’t realize that John Watson just did one of the bravest things in the history of the earth by telling him that he thought he was going to die today in the Olympic snow.
“I thought . . .” I clear my wet throat. “I thought he was really gone, those times you seen me. I thought he was . . .” My voice shakes. “I thought he was gone.”
John had seen it in Sherlock’s eyes, in the final moment before he turned away: Sherlock had fully known that John would leave. He had not been surprised at all. Because that’s what John does. John leaves things. He sees the first hints of chaos, of things spreading out of his control, and he tidies himself away, packs up his life, and leaves. Moves on. Fades into the background. Closes his eyes and keeps his preferred reality intact. He’s had enough of chaos. More than his fair share.
Sherlock holds up a middle finger without looking back. “You sure as hell didn’t think my dick was irritating yesterday. Now stand there and argue all you want, but you know you want to.”
John presses back harder against Sherlock’s lips and curses under his breath. “You held your huge cock in your hand –”
I smile grimly and stare quickly at the ground. I’ve heard that question a thousand times before. “It’s the cancer from the War,” I explain. “They haven’t cured that one yet. Haven’t tried.”
I literally walked into it – his headstone. When I looked down and saw the name it took the breath out of my lungs. I was back at Barts, watching him fall, hearing the crunch of his skull hitting the cement. I was screaming his name and reaching desperately for his bloody hand and watching his body be carried away from me forever.
Scotty seems to realize for the first time that his hand is still on John’s bicep. He snatches it back quickly, fluttering his fingers by his side. John feels his arm twitch at the absence.
And he’s falling and falling in a stream of fire and smoke until the earth swallows him whole, ripping bone from bone, setting his skin to flame.
we can work out whatever else comes at us.” He glances at the sinking sun in the sky. “You can still fit in a few more runs, I’d think.”
John tells the alarm in his mind to shut the fuck up. He raises himself up off of Sherlock’s hips and leans down to press an open, wet kiss to the tattoo one last time.
Chris gestures behind him towards the vast horizon line, brilliant and shimmering in the sun. “But you see, they are not separate at all. They are the full sky. And they are the full sea. And yet they are also joined together seamlessly into one by the horizon line you see. And the sea sends its waves up towards the heavens to greet the sky, and the sky sends its wind down to kiss the surface of the water. And in that way, they are still one.”
With an effort he forces himself to turn and look at Sherlock, standing beside him looking absolutely gorgeous with the sunlight reflecting off his aviators and the salty wind blowing in his curls and the warmth of the sand glittering across his skin.
Sherlock had wanted to interrogate himself—complete with the rusty metal table and see-through glass and single lightbulb of some horrible detective film. Where was the Sherlock Holmes who went through nine days of withdrawals just so Greg Lestrade would agree to meet with him again? Where was the Sherlock who’d woken up at 3 o’clock in the morning most Saturdays for three years and secretly cleaned the house just so he could watch Greg and John bat eyelashes at each other all day thinking it was the other one who had done it?
And then John drops his hand, and he looks up at the stadium which is screaming for him, not even noticing the four cameras pointed directly in his face. He stares at it all as if from far, far away, his face still carefully blank.
Suddenly I realize, dawning on me like the sun. Hintley’s out. And from the looks of it, Hintley doesn’t realize it yet. He slams on his own brakes and stops in a cloud of smoke, holding his gun steady towards the stranger as he creeps towards him on the pier.
Greg brings Molly and his kids to the base for a visit, taking them up with Sam in a helicopter for a tour, and Simon teaches the kids to make Elsa shake hands and roll over.
Their rough, low voices sound crisp in the intimate darkness. Etched permanently into the air of the house and set apart from the rest of the world churning on just outside the windows. John smirks, running his thumb gently across Sherlock’s chin. “Good. That way you’ll remember me when the saltwater gets in it and stings so you don’t do anything too stupid today.”
I can hear the coyotes moanin’ in the wind standin’ smack in the middle of her kitchen. The way the tent glowed, and the stars sighed, and the fire smoke wrapped around our skin together like a cloak.
The voice sounds like whipped-cream and Sherlock and home. The voice calls out, “Surf like hell, John Watson.”
The flicker I see through his eyes is such a great, heaving sadness that it nearly knocks me breathless. Then in a flash it’s gone. Replaced by something calm and warm, the smooth, uncomplicated emotion of desire.
Sherlock shrugs one shoulder, looking out calmly at the horizon. “Seeing as how he owns a third of the place I don’t see why we can’t ask.”
Sherlock after all. That maybe it’s someone else, a machine, even, and not the man John has held and kissed. The sense of wrongness pounds through his veins. Over and over, his mind replays the moment Sherlock’s body slammed head-first down the ice, into the orange fence.
“Now, I don’t think I have to tell you that you just made another kind of history this afternoon, too,” she says, and Greg realizes with a horrifying thud in his stomach that the camera is panning back to catch Sherlock in the frame.
“Aren’t we the last people on earth you would need to explain yourself to?” Sherlock asks casually up at him, leaning back in his chair. But Greg notices how his knee is bouncing on the floor, and his fingers are clenched white around his mug.
blooming after being locked in a bud all winter. “We’re fathers,” he said back, and then we laughed together, surprised, amazed, relieved, brimming over laughs. Laughs that turned into gasps as we reached between each others legs, and tasted our pleasure on each others’ lips, and finally came together with a mutual cry of “Oh god, oh
When the sun dips below the mountain peaks and drags the rays of light down with it one by one we’re already sittin’ by a fire and stream. I watch the licking flames swallow up the shine on his boots, the metal rivets on his Levi’s, his brassy belt buckle. I can smell him on every breath of air, like the mountains done kept his scent safe and secret in the trunks of the firs and released it back out in the air when it saw us ridin’ up over the hilltop again, coming back.
. Only, he isn’t even sure what ‘it’ is. He had no plan at all when he dialed the phone, other than a gut feeling. The same gut feeling that made him say yes to Sherlock and Greg that first time, that made him ski again after his injury, that made him look up at the stars on his back in the sand instead of closing his eyes.
The air prickles around John’s skin. His body prepares to flee, prepares to tense up hot and defend and deny and refute. But then John hears himself say softly, “I know.”
John shakes his head. “I’m gonna start making you put a dollar in a fucking jar every time you apologize, and then you can buy me a brand new surfboard. What happened next?”
Scotty swallows hard and looks at John. He doesn’t look quite so casual anymore. He looks ruffled. Unsure.
Voice-over, off-screen, one we recognize as the other head paramedic, Patrick: “It’s those first few moments when you are in the snow that are the most critical. If you hesitate, if you wait too long to stabilize the patient, to get them back in the helicopter, hypothermia can set in. Even with just a broken bone, it is a race against the clock. You are racing against death.”
My heart aches in my chest, and water suddenly fills my eyes. I feel absolutely alone on the planet, alone with Sherlock Holmes in my arms, smellin’ like sunlight and earth and straw. “You’re not a fool,” I breathe. “Not a fool for wantin’ that at all, shit –”
Finally, he brings a hand up to his forehead and leaves a brief message. As he talks, he moves his hand to rub the back of his neck.
yet. And John had been so overcome with adoration for him in that moment, chasing after him and begging him to stay in the middle of the warm, lamplit street, that John had taken two steps forward and grabbed the side of Greg’s face and kissed him square on the mouth.
Holmes, from the back: “Yes, let’s invite everyone, even Sam and Robbie. And we can all bring a plus-one to Simplon Pass and have a little reunion over the blood-soaked crevasse.”
Greg: “When Holmes was . . . when he was down there in the ice. Watson’s voice in the radio call to me. I cannot even . . . I cannot even think about it. Cannot imagine.”
John raises one brow, just a little, puts the polish on his perfect glare, and Sherlock’s arse hits the seat with a dull thud.
By the time he’s done the sun’s long gone down. My empty stomach feels tight and nauseous. I keep a straight face through all his stories, not showin’ him anything of what I’m feeling, what I’ve been feeling. I’m not sure it’d be humanly possible to show so many emotions all at once. I’m furious, and I’m stunned. Rocked off my center and stranded and found and grieving and relieved and so unbelievably angry.
God, those sounds. I’ve always known Sherlock to be a highly emotional man, even before the first time we fell into each other and let our bodies finally press into one. He just hides it, like a BAFTA winning actor. Even with me, his adorer, his One, he mostly hides it. And so I had never seen Sherlock Holmes break down and crash into pieces like he did that night. He looked into my eyes, and his irises shone fiercely in Technicolor outlined in disbelieving, angry, terrified red, and he whispered with a raw voice, “John, no, I can’t,” and then he fell.
I pick up a dishrag to wipe off the glasses sitting on the counter even though they’re already dry as a field in drought. “Tell me this, Junior,” I say, keeping my voice low even though I suspect Sherlock can still hear every word. “How is it you . . . you said you suspected, you know. . .”
Greg and John both give him quietly focused looks as he pulls away. Sherlock never initiates that, never says it first, and the air in the room suddenly feels too thick, too hot. Sherlock fights with himself not to duck his head and blush or squirm.
Sherlock is too surprised to even grasp John’s fingers back before John throws back his head onto the pillow with a sigh and comes into Greg’s palm, crying out until Greg clamps a hand over his mouth to stifle his groan.
Sherlock shakes his head, his hands still clasped in front of his mouth, and his entire spine rigid and taut. “
I wait for myself to wince at the mention of that place. Instead I’m filled with joy so immediately I nearly laugh. It feels unprecedented to share joy like this, like my body can’t even contain it anymore, leaking out like sunlight through my weary, thin skin. And I marvel that the universe somehow thinks I’m still worthy of feeling happiness like this. After everything.
John groans, just as his fingers impossibly tighten in Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock eagerly tips his head back as John spills into his throat. He swallows him down as John pulses his hot release across his tongue.
Then he glances at the time on the wall, and pales. He’s late. He’ll barely have time to arrive at the stands for the first round of Sherlock’s race. He and Greg are probably wondering where John is, or if he’ll even come. Maybe they’re wishing he won’t. Grateful they haven’t seen him limp up to the stadium, an apology written in his face.
John laughs. “Again? Oh good, if I were superstitious, I’d think he’ll fall and break his neck again, too.”
He takes a final deep breath before pulling away, slapping his hands once on his knees and shaking out his shoulders.
Then he leans down, filled with the rush of his own daring, his life’s dream written above them into the clouds, etched in the sky, and he kisses John, too.
Just as I’m passin’ by him into the kitchen, I hear his voice whisperin’, low and deep to the dozing baby in his arms.
I fight down a wave of nausea from my medication, making my way as quickly as I can towards his side. The curtains in his room are pulled back, filling every corner with the bright afternoon sun. Warming his pale white skin. I reach his side and immediately take his limp hand in mine, sitting on the bed and looking down into his face.
The girl next to me leans on the bar with sequin covered shoulder pads, hair teased straight up towards the ceiling and smacking her bright pink gum. She’s smiling at me in a way I forgot people could.
John suddenly realizes that they aren’t even touching anymore. Are back to standing a few feet apart, John keeping his balance with his hand on the lockers. The fact that Greg hasn’t rushed to pick up his crutch, or begged him to sit—that he’s instead showing the sort of gentle carefree-ness that John has often longed for Greg to show, a simple trust in John’s abilities to take care of himself—feels like a terrible omen now. A sign of the end.
-They wouldn't technically be driving down the Pacific Coast Highway to get from Hermosa to Laguna. That's not really how it works. . . (I think they'd most likely take the 405, although I'm too lazy to do the research of when exactly that freeway got built). Anyways, just don't use this fic for travel advice.
Sherlock wants to scream. “Don’t I? It isn’t that hard to figure out watching you tuck his hair behind his ear and whisper sweet nothings into his ear.”
He stops speaking mid-word, and swallows a moan instead. He gazes back up once more to the crevasse, scanning what’s going on with the team. Behind us, we can hear the sounds of the team heaving the stretcher with the patient over the edge, Sam controlling the ropes.
“God, what ever happened to you to make you so afraid of success? It’s the most goddamn tedious thing I’ve ever seen. You already want to agree, if the angle of your body towards me and your rising pulse is anything to go by. You know you’re a good runner. You think you could possibly be better at it than me. That excites you. So agree to run with me and you can get your little personal victory in and then we can surf the day after without all of this emotional nonsense.”
Greg turns away with his head in his hands and groans a French curse before turning back and enveloping Watson in his arms. Watson gratefully hugs him back. Holmes dodges the hug, but looks on with a small, proud grin. Gerold rubs the side of his face and laughs, shaking his head. Sam jokingly curses at the sky before putting a friendly arm around Robbie, who laughs and mutters what appears to be an exasperated joke at Watson. Simon smiles, just briefly, then looks down at his shoes, scuffing his feet.
He’d limped back to his room and spent an embarrassing amount of energy restraining himself from calling John. John was busy—Greg knew what it was like after winning a Gold medal more than anybody. He’d satisfied himself with going over their conversation in the locker room again and again.
She shrugs her shoulders helplessly and looks down at her hands. “I care about him,” she says, and she sounds incredibly sorry.
He feels one hundred years old, and he struggles not to limp in the sand. The last week’s worth of shifts sweating down at the dock yards feel like icy lead in every muscle of his body, leaving him frustrated and out of breath as they trudge through the hot, deep sand.
John nearly gasps. The man from the pier stands next to him transformed. Gone is the shocked curiosity, the inquisitive yet vulnerable stare covered by loose curls locked on to John’s eyes from the center of a swarming crowd. In its place is a statue. A God. John knows his mouth is hanging open as the man next to him slowly pulls off the hoodie to reveal tanned bare skin, his entire muscled back covered in an intricate tattoo that John can’t quite fully glimpse. He stops himself just in time from dashing over to get a better look.
Then they glimpse the skier just ahead in third place through the trees, hurling himself around a turn, looking devastating and strong and exhausted—
,” Greg had said, looking far older than Sherlock had ever seen him, like he had left the sheer vitality of his spirit and strength at the bottom of the staircase. Like the man who had chased after John not two hours ago had been fifteen years younger. “
No, now he’s suddenly looking at a stranger. A soldier. A pilot dropped into the middle of the silly, unimportant Winter Olympics who almost died out on the battlefield, who had to be searched for, who understands what it means to get ready to die.
Reality sucks the life from the room, banishing the echoes of celebrations. That stupid, irresponsible, fucking unbelievable kiss should have been the greatest moment of his life—the thought that
The stranger laughs once, harsh. “Funny,” he says, holding up the object in his hand towards Hintley. “Because that weasel over there was at least two ranks below you in the military, and yet he managed to immobilize you just long enough for me to walk right up to Van Cleave. Your only job.”
The constriction that had been sitting tightly in Greg’s chest since Sherlock opened his mouth and said “two times” finally starts to evaporate, and he goes to lie back down along John’s side when Sherlock’s hand quickly shoots out and catches his cheek. Greg freezes, a small frown on his face, as Sherlock holds him steady, then leans across John’s chest so he can give him a kiss.
John’s hands are clenched so tightly his knuckles are shining white. “That’s right. I am your partner. You are my partner. And I am standing here wondering why you thought it was fucking alright to wave off medical attention after falling onto your face at ninety-miles an h—”
The nurse frowns for a moment, oblivious to John’s rambling thoughts, before double-checking his notes on the thick stack of John’s medical records. “Sorry,” he says. “I am not as used to deciphering records in English. Is it just the tight skin that’s causing the impaired movement here?”
Interviewer, after hesitating: “I know you want to get home now, for the end of the day, so I will be as honest as possible with you, if that is alright?”
“No,” he says grinning. “But then you went and fucking showed up one day and made me want it more than anything, you asshole. I just want to be with you. So why the hell not?”
Sherlock suddenly realizes that they haven’t done this in ages—lie in the dark like schoolboys, whispering precious things, their hands roving over each other’s faces, shoulders and chests. Once, such a moment would have filled Sherlock with delight over their shared secret; out of every person with posters of Greg Lestrade on their walls, Sherlock beat them all. And not even the most catastrophic force of nature could rip him from this bed.
We watch Watson walk away through the crowded hangar, dodging mechanic tool carts and helicopters with ease, until the red of his jacket is swallowed up from view.
I’m at the Exit Point. My old bedroom – the one I rented just before the War. Clothes are strewn over the creaking wood floor, across my old bed with my red flannel duvet. The walls are made of smoke, and my feet float ghost-like clear above the ground. In limbo.
He asked me to get in the water with him and hold him from behind, to wrap my arms around him and sing low into his ear (“for
They all nod. The wave is easily twenty feet tall, towering above the rest of the horizon line and blocking out enough of the sun to cast a shadow along the shore. John’s ears pick up the sound of the announcers cutting through the thick, tense silence on the beach.
“Love,” Greg says, barely able to speak. “That would bring me pain. More than anything. For you to stop skiing. It is the only reason I had the surgery. The only reason I recovered as I did, it was because of you.”
He’d whipped around in the snow, shocked, to see Greg mounting the last few steps of the course-side stairs to the platform where Sherlock stood, visibly limping and clearly in pain, so out of breath there was an impenetrable white cloud obscuring his face.
The door opens again. Greg’s ribs loosen for the first time since he witnessed Sherlock’s head make contact with the snow.
He’d held John in the silent kitchen for a long time, letting John breathe roughly against his chest. John had stood stunned, arms hanging limply at his sides, feeling numb and small and completely overwhelmed. Then he’d felt Sherlock’s lips press gently into his hair, suddenly filling his bones with such a sense of
Sherlock’s throat clenches, and he takes a moment to let his words settle. John waits beside him. Steady and calm.
Ah. That. Sherlock should have kept his damned mouth shut. “I’m perfectly prepared. Greg sent me a training schedule, which I’ll start tomorrow.”
Christ, but everyone would be able to see. And he’s wearing his full snow pants over his leg today, plus his snow boot fitted over his prosthetic foot, and so inevitably one of the Olympics organizers would approach him and explain that, “
I pass the time fixin’ up a rope haul to hang our food and gear up in the trees away from the animals. I get lost in the work – in chopping up a pile of wood, swinging my arms over and over like the little hand on a clock and knowin’ that nobody screaming is gonna interrupt me. At one point I raise the axe and feel a prickle up my spine like I’m being watched, but when I turn back towards the fire the stranger’s still dead asleep with his brimmed hat covering his face.
He can’t figure out Sherlock’s goddamn coffee contraption to save his life. After ten minutes of cursing under his breath he gives up and puts on some boiling water. He finds a loose teabag deep in the back of the silverware drawer and bobs it up and down haphazardly in the steaming water, pretending that his hands aren’t shaking. By the time he has a mug full of over-steeped and stale tea the gripping fear is already back full force, pulsing through his body in black, heated bursts. He looks out the kitchen window and holds the un-drunk tea in his hands, watching the calm tide lap gently at Sherlock’s shore and picturing towering walls of water in his mind, ripping across the surface of the ocean and roaring as they break over into a fury of whitewater and foam, crushing Sherlock’s limp body beneath them, burying him deep under thick, wet sand.
Because of course Sherlock had known what day it was – that it was Helen Watson’s birthday - even though John hadn’t said a single goddamn thing about it. And while John felt hot tears building in the back of his eyes Sherlock had taken the shaking mug of coffee from his hand and wrapped him in his arms, whispering into his ear, “The tattoo wasn’t planned, obviously. Just walked by a place that looked clean and got an idea.”
We fuck. Sometimes rough and fast, angry slaps on thighs and dirt smeared on skin and jeans left dangling round shaking hips. Sometimes slow and soft, his body draping over mine like a blanket and the heavens and the soil all at once. I never drape myself across him – not the way he does. Our bodies get older, more weathered by the wind and the vast plains. It takes the edges off, helps me feel the whole weight of him without feeling like my lungs is closed off from the air.
The airhorn startles him, just like it always does. John holds back his flinch and runs forward into the waves, throwing down his board into the shallows once he’s waist-deep and leaping on top of the solid, familiar wood. His heart races in his chest, pumping the blood through his body so harshly he can feel it pulsating through the tips of each of his fingers.
And when sleep failed him and his shoulder felt on fire John had pressed one last kiss into Sherlock’s curls then slipped out from under him with a grimace, telling himself that if he laid there any longer it would be admitting that they might never get to do it again.
A voice, off screen: “Um. . . Well, actually, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked that before. Not in fifteen years.”
Scotty takes a step closer, invading his space so that John has to crane his neck to see him. From this close he can feel the heat radiating off his chest.
Sherlock immediately responds, “I never would have skied again if not for Lestrade returning to the sport. So yes, obviously, I am glad for his return.”
“Like I have said, he knew what he was saying yesterday. He understood the timing. Whatever happens, it is not your fault.”
Sherlock wills his mind to go blissfully blank, staring out at the sea and listening to the soft whirls and crackles of the foam as it hisses into the crevices of the tide pools and retreats.
, he is still so utterly incapable of properly loving John Watson. And John is still so incredibly strong.
But it isn’t Greg making sure he’s still alright, or Sherlock telling him he’s an idiot for letting his leg get so cold. It’s an unidentified number—an official Olympics email address, actually.
“It was his own decision,” Greg says, his eyes glued to John still adjusting his leg in the snow. “Sherlock,
With one final serious glance at each of them, Chris turns to face out over the ocean, raising the conch shell to his lips. He takes a deep breath and blows a deep and mournful note, echoing out across the waves and billowing over the sea. John’s chest vibrates to the noise. He looks up at Sherlock, whose eyes are burning brilliant blue framed by long, wet eyelashes. Sherlock smiles, and cups John’s face in his hands, and John closes his eyes and hums as Sherlock presses a long, soft kiss to his forehead, thumbs rubbing just along his jaw. John reaches up to hold onto Sherlock’s wrists as the conch shell continues to blow out over the sea. He feels the wind in his hair, smells the salt in his nose and resting at the back of his throat, breathes in the scent from the hollow of Sherlock’s neck as his toes grip at the foundation of the earth beneath his feet.
wrong, and what gives the two of them the right to make fun of him? Now? When they now both know that Sherlock received the text he never wants to receive again for the rest of his life earlier today? After John nearly hyperventilated in the snow? After Greg took them to see the empty course? How can they—?
Greg blinks as the image on the screen looming behind them flashes in a whirl of CGI snow into a photograph of the Super-G medal ceremony from Vancouver—Greg on top with the Gold, pulling up the Silver and Bronze winners onto his step with his arms around their shoulders. Greg tries not to frown when he realizes he doesn’t even remember who the Bronze was—a skier from Poland? Russia? Or was he an American?
John runs a hand over the back of his neck, feeling odd and itchy in his skin. Sherlock snorts under his breath and shoots him a sidelong look, and John can tell that he’s irritatingly trying to suppress a fond grin.
Sherlock’s blood roars again, an ache in his stomach and chest, and he has Greg pressed down into the mattress, the sheet kicked off, before he can even think. He can’t believe they’re doing this; Sherlock has no plan, took no time to prepare, can feel Greg’s naked chest and back and legs everywhere, overwhelming him, and he has to race tomorrow, and John skied away from them in the snow, and this pulse through his body feels alien and new, the way Greg is letting him lead, giving everything to him, and maybe this is a mistake—
He breaks the silence, voice booming straight through my skin. “What should I call you in case we get separated?”
I think of her opening a kitchen drawer and finding the stack of all the postcards Sherlock’s ever sent me. I think of leavin’ her alone day after day when I’m out on the roundup down in the Tetons working twenty hours days with nobody to cook dinner for her or ask her how was school. I think of not knowin’ how to wash her little jeans and shirts without a washing machine the way her momma does it.
He runs a hand through his hair. Seems to come to some sort of internal decision, his jaw growing firm. “When I was younger, if there had been someone—a skier—who was like this, and did not keep who they were a secret, and still competed . . .” His breath falters. “It would have changed everything. Everything for me. I think—what if my parents could have seen that? That it is not a failure? What if I knew that I would not one day have to choose between love and my skiing? And yes, there will be hatred. We cannot control what everyone thinks. But we have each other. The two of you can continue competing. I can coach. We can live as before, but without fear, as I wish someone had done for me. I do not have competing anymore, but I have this.
“I’m not impressed you found me,” Sherlock had said, because even if he had lost the ability to be someone who was beloved, part of a family, at least he could still excel at being insufferably sarcastic.
Sherlock ducks as John throws his balled-up napkin at his head, then rises on aching legs to his feet, stretching out his body with a groan. He feels lighter than air. Like he didn’t just sit there and have a conversation about dead and missing moms for the first ever time in his life. He thinks for the thousandth time that John Watson is a marvel.
John takes a shaking breath and finally forces himself to meet Greg’s gaze. He almost gasps. Greg’s face is soft. Patient. John realizes he isn’t angry, or jealous that John found a different friend than him, or even accusing that out of all the people it had to be that chief asshole Scotty Holmes. He’s just stating a fact,
Again, John only grins, his hands competently moving over the controls with ease. “No, this bird’s been modified, as you know from your personal inspection. There’s no life-saving pedal hidden under my fake right foot.”
Slowly, carefully, hidden from the rest of the grandstands by their bodies, Sherlock’s hand joins John’s and Greg’s, all of them touching. It makes something burn though John’s imaginary right leg and pulse through his burned shoulder. Only, it isn’t pain. It isn’t that familiar, prickling fire like nails. Instead, it feels like . . . like the muscles beneath finally unclenching. Like every part of John’s body is connected, the metal and the burned tissue and the real bones. Like he’s finally—
“I didn’t know. I saw that you were enjoying yourself, and you clearly didn’t want to go back to your hotel, and I have a couch. You hadn’t even thought of your hotel room – I figured I’d help you out.”
I escape out back into the alley and slam the door behind me against the roaring smoke and sound, shutting it off into a muffled thump and beat – slowly, slowly dying. I stumble out further into the alley on shaky legs and gulp down lungfuls of air, clearing out the sweat and grime and noise. Clearing out the floral perfume.
On a tiny side street in the middle of broad fucking daylight after just annihilating his round of the Billabong Masters, John has his hands tight on Sherlock’s neck and shoulders and Sherlock is gasping against his lips, holding on for dear life and groaning against John’s mouth “you fucking did it,” and “thank god,” and “I’m sorry,” and “
Greg pulls on his favorite sleeping shirt—John’s ancient RAF flight training tee with giant holes in all the seams. He goes to turn off the bathroom light, and Sherlock can tell from the sound of his footfall on the cheap carpet that he’s limping. “
Greg barely registers the animal roar of the crowd as they all simultaneously realize that John is not accepting Kuznetsov’s all but inevitable Gold. He leaves Vanko further and further behind with every leaping stride, burying him in clouds of kicked up ice and snow.
“Actually, yes,” he croons, or tries to, at least. “If you would be ever so kind as to do me a favor. I find myself in a bit of a predicament. Something urgent has come up regarding my training—you know how these things go—and, you see, my coach Gregory Lestrade, his phone appears to be off, and it really is ever so important that I speak with—”
“You’re unbelievable,” Johnny finally says over his steady, even breaths. “Do you actively try to be a smug bastard all the time or does it just come naturally to you?”
, you will take this from me, too? The happiness of this day? You think that a kiss is all I can think about after I have just watched you
His eyes follow a little swallow taking flight from a branch and disappearing into the fog of clouds. He hums. “For what?”
Her lips are sad. I feel that what she is about to say will ruin me. “Dr. Watson,” she says clearly, “Mr. Holmes is in a state which I believe you, as a doctor, might be familiar with.” She pauses, and everything halts. “You’ve heard of locked-in syndrome?”
“You can’t—Sherlock, you can’t just hotwire these, you know. It’s not like a normal car. You need the IOC keycard—”
Greg’s voice: “It makes me sad. A man like John Watson, he deserves someone who can hold him together if he needs to break. Maybe it is not my business, but I wish for that for him.”
He feels John shift behind him onto his elbow, sitting up and leaning over Sherlock, reaching for Greg’s face in the dark. They kiss above his ear, and Greg’s soft “I love you” drips down onto Sherlock’s eyelid, sliding down his cheek.
John has the sudden, intense feeling of going on stage for a play, head popping out from behind the backstage curtains.
Sherlock shoots him a grateful smile. He realizes he couldn’t stop telling that story even if John had asked him to. It feels so good to let it fall from his lips, like finally releasing the image of his mom kneeling in the dirt to fade away over the sea. Like finally setting her free.
I could feel our daughters moving, pushing lower inside of him as the round curve of his belly slowly changed from pushing straight out to hanging low and heavy over his hips.
Alexxphoenix42 created this jaw-dropping moodboard where she somehow managed to find Sherlock's actual goddamn beach house.
God, but John’s eyes had been beautiful when they’d locked onto Sherlock’s just moments ago. Sherlock had watched breathlessly as the thoughts passed so freely across John’s face. Exhaustion, followed by confusion and wariness, finally blotted out by sheer disbelief and relief. By joy. And he’d sought out Sherlock in the crowd as he stood there dripping, chest heaving, on the shore and stared at him with a look that said
Greg, in English: “Wouldn’t be our Watson if he wasn’t ready for the end of the world at all times.”
Maybe he wouldn’t have been so cowardly. But then again, maybe it isn’t cowardice at all. And now all this time, day after day, John has missed the opportunity to be proud of Sherlock’s life. To be grateful for his fight, his recovery. To shower Greg with gratitude for being there. To tell Sherlock that he is just as much the hero, just as much the soldier.
Something tugs in Sherlock’s chest at the soft sound of Greg’s voice. He plops down on the bed, purposefully half-squishing Greg, and drops Greg’s laptop carelessly to the floor.
“Six-thirty tomorrow morning? Hermosa?” John asks as he rubs the back of his neck with his other hand.
Well, I’ll write it down. It was awfully simple. The morning after we found out, I woke up to a characteristically empty bed and the sound of Sherlock in the living room. I was stretching my tired, aching muscles across the freshly washed sheets, letting the scent of Sherlock’s nightly hand cream rise up out of the fabric like puffs of sunlight and warmth, when he appeared at the foot of the bed. His face looked pale, with eyes still puffy from the long night. He was naked.
“You never called me,” Sherlock says, hating that he sounds like a whining, teary-eyed child. “John never called me.”
Robbie looks quickly over his shoulder at Holmes sleeping in the back. He shares a brief, silent look with Simon, Patrick, and Sam before answering back into his headset.
that I wanted to experience it with you?” Greg pulls away from Sherlock, fresh anger prickling under his skin. “It is my fault that I wanted to be back up there at the top with everyone else, not just waiting down at the bottom all alone, without any of the—”
“Greg, you were there to watch, I’m assuming?” Sonya asks, sounding so enthusiastic it was as if she wanted Greg to respond that simply
The camera catches an odd look on Watson’s face, visible behind his headset, before he reaches up to put his sunglasses on. Then, he smirks.
Silence looms for a heavy beat, then Greg’s palm rests hesitantly on top of John’s hand. John desperately thanks his past-self for having kept his glove off after hanging up the phone.
And he’s about to spectacularly let him down now, isn’t he? Let them all down. A lifetime of work, nearly four years of coaching, and he’s about to let the skiing darling of the world down.
There is only the hurt sound that had whined in Greg’s throat, the sharp pinch in his lungs, as he pulled Sherlock firmly against his chest, settling them both beneath the cheap Village sheets, as he pressed his snow-chapped lips into Sherlock’s curls and said, “
This little record will be good for me, I think. I hope future-John isn’t rolling his eyes too much at my sentimentality. I would hope the same for future-Sherlock, but his eyes have probably already rolled out of his head and onto the floor, so it’s really too late for that, isn’t it?
“Never underestimate the power of a best friend with a police badge,” Greg says smirking. “Had to whip it out three times just to figure out what goddamn flight you were on, and that was after I had to call and ask every fucking surfer on earth whether they heard correctly that
John tries for a smile, but his eyes sag at the effort. He feels the seconds tick by in the air like bombs dropping, each one pushing him farther and farther away from Sherlock’s air. Sherlock is looking at him as if he could memorize every inch of his face if he only stared hard enough, eyes roaming slowly from his forehead to his chin and back again, eyebrows furrowed in concentration underneath a curtain of morning-soft curls.
Settle on a view of the outside of a small building of flats nestled on the outskirts of town. Ivy crawls up the sides, and little terraces are filled with small breakfast tables, potted plants, and extra stored snowboards and skis.
One more breathless orgasm later, and one thoroughly long, lazy snog between Sherlock and them both—Sherlock, who claimed he needed to “conserve his energy from wasting it on something useless like an orgasm,” and whom Greg noticed had actually long gone soft—after all three of them take in a deep inhale and satisfactorily sigh, there is a quick wiping of somebody’s shirt across wet skin. Three bodies pile up in a breathing heap across sweat damp sheets, surrounded by three colors of hair strewn across the white pillows.
“Oh right, you’re the fishin’ buddy. Mr. Holmes mentioned you once or twice. Granted I ain’t worked for him that long, but yours was the one name I managed to catch. Sorry for not lettin’ you know. Woulda tried to do him a last good secretary service and let his friends and family know but . . . for all I know he kept those peoples’ names and information all up in his head. Couldn’t find an address book nowhere.”
Whatever he’s about to ask me, the answer is yes. Because Sherlock is my sun, and because he gave birth to our daughters, and because he’s
“Plus,” Greg says as they step out into the harsh sunlight, “You look like shit. Like some lost puppy in a cardboard box nobody wanted to adopt from the animal shelter.”
John doesn’t disappear. He stands firm and waits, staring through the thick crackling air between them and looking at Sherlock like he hasn’t ever seen a sight so beautiful. Like Sherlock is somehow a sunset covered ocean and a velvet field of flowers and the first warm hints of dawn lapping gently at the cold, silvery shore.
he almost says, then quickly recovers. “With this man. It’s quite inspirational that he puts up with my . . . neurotic ways. I’m not the easiest person to work with. He deserves all the credit.”
I take time to clear my throat, lettin’ him see the thick emotion in my eyes. He looks small, even standin’ there in his old Stetson hat and the nice maroon checkered shirt I got him for Christmas.
She hums, like I just gave her the answer she was missin’ to her crossword puzzle. “Well I reckon’ his folks would be glad if you wanted to carry out his wishes. ‘Bout the ashes I mean.”
He blinks twice to all of her questions, and I imagine I can see the fond exasperation on his face. She nods and shakes her head at herself. “I know, I know,” she says. She looks at me. “I know you’re fine.”
Sherlock shrugs and looks out over the water. “Not my fault you wear every emotion on your face. I mean, shit, didn’t they teach you how to be stone-faced in the Navy?”
Well, actually this is related to Sherlock’s skiing now. But apparently he subconsciously decided that the same rules still apply.
city. See him using his Dispatcher in the cold, dark fog and walking along his stretch of beach in the fresh, clean air of sunrise. I see him flying down the pier on his motorbike. Thick black curls in the wind.
Johnny practically growls. “No you don’t. No you fucking don’t. How big of an idiot do you think I am? Scotty Holmes magically wipes out on his only wave of the day after three years of a near perfect record? Wiped out my ass.”
“Shit, John, more than anything.” Sherlock plants a wet and open kiss at the base of John’s neck and rolls his body against him, sending shockwaves of ripples out across the water. His hands rove slowly again up John’s stomach and chest, trailing saltwater across his shivering skin and covering his muscles with his huge, warm palms. John presses forward into his hands, head leaning back and lungs full of air as he lays himself open to Sherlock’s touch before the horizon line.
, Sherlock thinks, trying with all his might to somehow telepathically send the thought through the air and straight into John’s brain, because they weren’t given enough time, he should have swept John into his arms and kissed him, celebrated all over again, because John
Maxine gasps beside him. Someone in the crowd screams, and hundreds more wail a curse in a collective gasp.
John is nodding and already moving to pull his clothes back on when the nurse pauses from the doorway and peaks his head back in. The bleak clinical blankness on his face falls away, and John catches a glimpse of a relatively young man just excited to be working at the Olympics.
John stands in the middle of the darkened bedroom and looks down at Sherlock sleeping on his stomach like the dead, sheets tangled around his waist and curls plastered to one side of his head.
One hundred and thirty-eight hours, now, as he braces himself against the wind and spray and tracks the current of the waves by the light of the greying stars, memorizing their rises and falls, completing the tables and formulas in his head that will help him pick the largest wave tomorrow at the competition.
John nods and starts to get into position to chase the wave. He stops just before starting his first stroke. “Will you tell Molly, for me? Tell her . . . you know.”
Chris holds up a patient hand, then gestures with a nod towards the rocky cliff far behind him, silhouetted by the slowly purpling sky. “Let’s go then,” he says.
Then she speaks. “Dr. Watson,” she begins, looking back up into my eyes. With her other hand she reaches up and removes the pin from her starched nurse’s collar, then leans forward to drop it in the wastebasket by my chair. “I’m so sorry,” she whispers. She blinks hard. “I didn’t know.”
John had gasped awake and stared at the ceiling with greying vision, heart pounding, and once he finally convinced himself that Sherlock was safe and alive next to him, he realized that the ache in his shoulder was real. Pain radiating out from where Sherlock’s head was pressing down onto him, heavy with sleep. John had tried and failed for almost an hour to look down at Sherlock’s soft and vulnerable face and not picture it pale and draped with seaweed, floating endlessly in the depths of the sea like a ghost. Swallowed up whole by the deep.
I nod, even as the weight of the world hangs heavy on my tired shoulders. Alma’s face from that day in my hallway floats in my mind, as the truth of it all had flashed across her eyes seein’ Sherlock’s boots and jacket through the bedroom door. I see little Wilma lookin’ up awestruck at Sherlock the night before like he was the sun.
He tries to reach for Greg’s arm to pull him back, snatching at his sleeves, but Greg drops the few feet down to the snow, grunting at the pain that punches through his knee.
And so, in the blink of an eye, five men are shoveling at the base of the deep pit, utterly silent except for the heaving breaths and the crunch of the metal through the snow. From the edges, Sam watches them closely, carefully monitoring the fragile surface of the ice – the carabiners and ropes.
She leans towards me, and my nose picks up the familiar scent of her perfume, drowning out the spilled alcohol and sweat of this place. “That explains it then,” she murmurs, lips curved.
We keep the strap on in the closet – it’s so rarely used it doesn’t really warrant taking up space in the bedside table. I’ll probably look back on this and think that I’m just a dirty middle aged man, but Christ I practically salivated at the sight of Sherlock slipping those black leather straps over pale skin – at the look of the huge black cock jutting out into the silent, buzzing air of our room, at the way it peaked out from under the soft swell of his growing belly.
Sherlock stays silent. He breathes for a long time, letting John sink down into him as he drifts back to sleep, his stomach still sticky from the smear of Greg’s release, and the puffs of air coming from Greg’s nose blow Sherlock’s curls back from his face.
Watson: “And yet, every day, you show up to do the same thing you did the day before, but it’s never the same. Every single mission, every call, it’s never, ever the same.”
There’s a long, crackly sigh, then what sounds like Greg walking down a hallway and opening a door, then silence, the eerie absence of all background noise. “
Jeongseon had been abandoned—no Paralympic races would use the course, and it was only being kept in shape for the promise of Sherlock’s Final in 3 days. He’d known subconsciously from a skimmed email that morning that even practice runs had been banned for a day due to a snowdrift by Gate 9. He’d had no memory of even arriving at the course, or mounting the staircase hundreds of feet to where he stood now. He’d half-wondered if he really had damaged his head in his fall, and the side-effects were only now hitting him, causing him to black out and imagine years of his life and literally fly halfway up mountains.
It makes me angry to think about it. If I were a tenth as smart as him I’d be outta sight of farms and cow and calf operations and little no-name towns faster than you could say my own name.
I don’t want to talk about this. “Had a girl I was going steady with before I left for ‘Nam. Name was Alma – said she’d wait for me. Reckon I oughta go find her and get myself a ranch job back near Signal or something.”
It’s been one hundred and thirty-seven hours since he last held John Watson. One hundred and thirty-six since he last saw him. The knowledge that that number will only ever grow towards infinity leaves a thudding ache in his chest, drowned out by the heaving drone of the wind whipping across the churning surface of the ocean.
Sherlock grips the carpet with his toes. “Well, anyway, we can’t practice together tomorrow. Your knee—”
We were both naked, as we’re wont to do, even in the dead of winter. I pulled him by his lower back against my skin, fitting him perfectly into the curves of my body in that way I know he’s meant to fit. He was heavy and warm. He wrapped himself around me, consumed me, as if I’d been missing a huge piece of myself before he was lying right there. Right in my arms.
He guides me onto my stomach with wide open eyes. Gently pulls up my hips. We both ignore his shaking fingers. He traces the scar on my back for a moment, and I can hear the entire ocean waiting deathly still outside. Hovering and listening for me and him to be joined.
Greg makes a conscious effort not to grow irritated. “Perhaps they will be inspired by John’s race.”
He tries to breathe. Tries to convince himself that John being stuck in eighth is actually a good place to be, when—
It’s Sherlock, with an enormous, full belly stretched firm and round over both of our daughters. It’s this man I love, this man I adore, who has solved thousands of crimes and dashed over rooftops, now so heavy and pregnant, wheezing and weighted under this unfamiliar body. It’s him, with a swollen, sensitive chest and dark nipples threatening to undo all the hard work of the scars beneath them.
John feels sick to his stomach, vision going hazy as he stares without blinking at the roaring walls of water.
“You think that it does not concern me?” Greg shifts so they can see each other through the dark, face to face. He touches Sherlock’s cheek. “Love,
And so he straightens his spine, wrapping the thin towel around his waist, and steps back into the locker room. He blinks. He’d expected there to still be an athlete or two quietly getting dressed, stretching sore muscles, their muffled sounds simply lost to the echoing cheers still in his head.
John picks up his gun and starts to check it for the eighth time that morning, his fingers automatically going through his pre-race checks while his mind wanders . . .
I step back into the airless, dark trailer and see she left her sweater on the bed. The soft blue fabric feels weightless and fragile in my fingers. I go to hang it up in the little closet, and I try to close the closet door before I look at what’s hanging on the inside of it, but just like every time I try that, I fail.
Greg curses under his breath, shaking his head at himself. He thinks of the million reasons why watching John win a Gold medal is the happiest day of his life. Is worth every memory of loneliness. Is worth a kiss on a screen.
“Maxine’ll have my head for this, I’m sure, but we were wondering, seeing as how this might be Shanie’s only run—”
A door slams, and John looks up from the last thirty-odd minutes of texts blowing up his phone in rapid succession to see a group of his competitors filing in the locker room, each of them giving him a brief nod.
Maxine had nearly had a conniption when he finally came back to join them at their seats, nervously chattering on about how they thought they’d scared him away, and how Ronnie was trying to think of a reason to stay in their seats without John. She’d asked him how he even had such good phone reception up here anyway, and how insane the line was for the “lo-lo” or whatever he called it, and whether he was just talking to
When he turns back to Sherlock and Greg, they both have odd looks on their faces—ones John can’t quite place. He couldn’t possibly tell from this distance, and yet he imagines Greg’s eyes are still wet.
“But what do I say if they ask me about our relationship? What if they ask about you? About how me and John met?”
He’s closer. “How could I mind?” he breathes. It’s barely a whisper. Awestruck and quivering straight up into the clouds.
.” He’d held him, pressed him up against the lockers. Stroked his scars. Touched his leg with his bare hands. Felt the knee-joint click into place. He’d kissed the metal.
If only Sherlock and Greg could see him now, he thinks with a sharp pang. Could have watched him make that call. Could fully understand that there was a reason he just called James instead of anyone else on the morning of Sherlock’s Final. That he is
In the silence that follows, with the three of them looking at each other in the darkness, Greg’s hand still held in John’s, John feels a tight ball of emotion rise in his throat.
Greg drops his gloves behind him in the snow, then carefully leans down over Sherlock and holds his face in his bare hands. Greg’s lips are moving. His eyes don’t leave Sherlock’s closed lids, and a gust of wind effortlessly blows a lock of Sherlock’s curls over Greg’s thumb.
John’s never known the answer to anything more fiercely in his life. He strokes his thumb across Sherlock’s cheek, swallowing hard. “God yes,” he whispers.
He sees them through John’s eyes now, and an unprecedented warmth settles over his skin as he waits, starting at the palm of the hand John had grasped in his wet, salty grip.
Greg drags his tongue up the web of scarring over John’s shoulder, huffing wet breath over the places he knows John can feel as hot tingles working their way through the numb skin. “And what else?”
Greg’s done it again – pulled him up and out. John’s back feels open and assured, pushing back up against the weight of the world and drying inch by inch in the waking sun.
‘Bout a year later I slip away from my dreams to the feelin’ of soft dry lips pressing just below my ear. By the time I can force my eyes open Sherlock’s already gone, his side of the bed slowly growin’ cold while I hear him puttering around out in the kitchen puttin’ on a pot of coffee and humming to himself.
So yeah, Sherlock solves crimes over the phone when he could literally start giving birth to twins any second, and I hold up fingers to him when it’s time for him to hang up and do things (1: go to the bathroom, 2: drink water, 3: eat food, 4: let us stand together with our hands on his belly so we can feel our daughters’ kicking, 5: kiss me and let me remind him he is my sun).
“I went on a skiing trip once to France,” John says, yelling over the roar of the crowd. “He was staying at the same lodge. We just became friends.”
He wasn’t the man who told me he had the girls for that weekend, and that he wished he could go to the mountains with me, but maybe some other time, maybe next month . . .
Then the noise rushes back in a booming wave, louder and shriller than ever before, bursting in his ears. He hears his name, so clear the entire sky is filled with it, dripping white clouds and blue silk pierced by the Olympic flag. He licks his lips; tastes Greg and Sherlock there, the desperation of their love. Then he shakes his head clear of everything, holds his chin high, and steps up onto his Gold Medal Podium to the sound of his national anthem, tears in his eyes, his body instantly finding parade rest.
There’s a pause at the other end of the line. I realize she probably thinks I’m callin’ for a service not realizing he’s gone.
had minded. Catherine had minded. The Protestors filling the streets had sure as hell minded. But I look and I see nothing but truth in his eyes. Nothing but clear open wonder. It makes my eyes sting, and I blink.
when I’m not with you!” he screams. I stand frozen as he turns back towards the lake, chest heaving through his thick flannel shirt. I walk up beside him and see his body flinch away from me.
I open my eyes in the Exit Point. The edges of the room slowly fade into focus, and I gasp as I realize where I’m standing. I’m in my old army barracks – half unzipped duffel bag strewn on the floor next to the thin Army-issue mattress sagging on the metal cot in the corner.
Even the memory of his emotions is revolting. He stomps across his room to the shower and takes his third one of the day, angrily swiping soap across his skin until it hurts. He recites the chemical makeup of his shampoo. He lists every IOC-approved ski design from the inception of the Olympics until now.
Scotty lets out a single laugh, low and brusque. “I think this entire island would line up to disagree with you there,” he says, the sarcasm not quite hiding a deeper darkness.
He hums. The roar of the sea washes over us, and I ache in my chest that he’s taken me here. That this is my second to last ever Visit before I’m gone. And that somehow, deep down he must know.
