Still collecting herself, crouched on the floor of the entryway.
Hearing it.
Gaping, really.
John waited for the penny to drop. Nodding when it did. And then setting his cup down with a click of his tongue.
"Thank you, Mrs. Hudson," he finally managed, his eyes downcast in humility, "I don't deserve this warm welcome."
Sherlock laughed at that. Fully understanding John’s tease. “Trust me, I would,” he laughed. His smile though, fell a little as he trudged back over - looking down into John Watson’s eyes.
It licked like a fire into even the smallest hidden corners of his life. Places he had not realized Sherlock had touched, had been irrevocably changed. Altered carbon. Now ashes.

A ridiculous notion. A fantasy.
What would John want?
“John,” Sherlock breathed his name then, looking at John’s mouth, as his tongue had darted out to lick his lips in response to the stimuli - the nearness -

When he had knocked on her door, during one of his 'investigations’,

Molly was awkwardly conversing though, and Sherlock thought it might not be such a bad thing to have her here on the scene. At least John would know more about Sherlock's own proclivities then. She wasn't an unattractive woman, after all, and highly intelligent ...
Presently, he began again,
He had never wanted to be inside of someone's ribcage before. Sharing their beating heart. Listening to their beautiful brain. Feeling their every breath as it passed through their lips and into their lungs …
John blushed deeper.
Harry protested the insult to her character, as their hands both held on to the planchette and felt it move again. “You’re pushing it!” she charged.
Hoping to post the next update right after the holiday weekend!!!
He turned back.

most had just wanted a fling. And he had been up for it!
Six months.
His eyes drank in the soldier.
"John."
It was busy work, mostly. Helping out with minor tasks and mysteries to be unraveled for the Avengers team. Stuff that seemed, not insultingly, but logically, beneath the scope and requirement of the skills of an avenger. John dove into it head first. Thriving on the energy of the group. Going in to the surgery less and less often as the weeks progressed.
Wasn’t offering to commit one for you!
John's head shot upright. Eyes scanning corners.
Would he be in the same state as he had left them? Broken and bleeding out?
Black
He was also suddenly so
With every gesture of 'Here, take
"John,” Sherlock whispered in a hushed tone, almost afraid to break this reverential silence. And John settled down onto his heels again.

Mike was tapping him on the arm and signaling that he was off to the loo. John nodded.
How lucky was Sherlock - that John had not only risked his

Because John had run out of his own generic brand and had asked if he could borrow it ... ?

So ... that made this even easier, right! ... if John remembered him ... ? Mike noodled on that for a moment.
this is a human offering
She somehow continued her exploration of the room - unobtrusively, for a stranger - finally settling in on Sherlock’s chair. She plopped down on it. Just like a cat. John did a double take.
He could no longer picture a girlfriend as a permanent thing. Nothing would be anymore. Nothing could be. He himself might float away at any moment. Life was ... fleeting. Transient now.
Written there?
John wondered if she reminded him more of Harry in moments like this, than of Sherlock? Sherlock had not really been privy to the small anger that seemed to be bottled up inside of this woman …  But he decided that the cat-likeness swung all in favour of her being more like Sherlock, every time.

and wanted to tear off of him.
He felt old since his return to merry old England. Used up. Not having that much left to offer;
So long as he let Sherlock live.
He stuck around for you.
How had John not realized? Criminals follow a pattern … they can’t help themselves. They try something, it works. They do it again. And again. Until they are caught. Or shoot themselves on a rooftop overlooking London to prove a point.
Maybe he understood these super humans more than he expected he would? Having been around Sherlock Holmes for so long.
*****************************
of him? Broken and ugly?
He was looking for a soul to steal.
Sherlock eyed with pleasure, all of the signs of John’s comfort here … with him.
John's fingers flew over the keys in reply, eager to engage and keep him talking! Never so intent on holding his own in a conversation in his entire life:
Their hands brushed a little with the exchange, and John held his hand there at the touch a moment longer than necessary. Looking up. Catching Sherlock's eye. A monumental effort to not step up into the genius' space and snog him silly for all of his antics this afternoon - and for how much he couldn't bear the space that was currently separating them …
Now ...       it was getting harder and harder.
Their waiter came back, barely flashing the bill towards the bright white suit as if it was perfunctory only, before snagging the proffered card and heading back into the restaurant to run it for payment. The flash of shock on Sherlock’s face was, again,
Not here.
Step 1
He had taken the matter in stride.
And he hardly wanted to think about before ...
I did, yeah.
He wanted to hear it.
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the discarded box and other detritus from the freezer explorations in the bin. All things he also would have thrown out …
Dissolution.
“That you loved him?”
Or … a creak of a board downstairs, and John would bolt upright expecting Sherlock coming up to his room. And then …  the humiliation of realizing Sherlock would not have done this. Even if he had been alive.
“I never told him,” Sherlock cut in quickly.
And then she wasn’t.
No matter how much
Now you play a very fine fiddle -
John looked down at his hands in Sherlock’s hair, one on Sherlock’s arse … with some surprise. Sherlock looked down at one hand clutched in John’s jumper, straining at the threads with his titan grip as if he had been pulling him in closer (which he had) - the other on John’s neck, fingers splayed up into John’s golden hair … and they just … dove right back in for another kissing session. Not wanting to interrupt this fantastic moment.
Make Sherlock beg.
"Like this?" she asked, playfully. Showing him a pen by wiggling it.
you do, if you weren’t getting married tomorrow?” Mike asked, his brow raised, and mischief in his eyes, “paint the town red?
The criminal, who barely warranted the name, had been easily caught. He was wearing a jumper!
“TA!” Mike acted affronted, “I will!”
He may be an arrogant sod, but he's our arrogant sod ... haha
Elated was not exactly the word for how John Watson had looked ...
Working to set things to rights.
“When will he be back?” She clearly paid no attention to his attitude, and was quickly cataloguing everything in the house with a sweep of her eyes. It was an unsettlingly familiar behaviour to John, and it took him a moment to recover at the onslaught of images of Sherlock standing and spinning in place as he documented a room …
And for the full story. "I've missed him too," she stated. Reading his thoughts like a book.
On the day they took you away …
Runaway Groom ...
"So this is a light evening?" John grinned.
John felt his throat strain as he screamed out Sherlock's name
Would see you in handcuffs.
Few had the ability to tear themselves away when Sherlock was deducing them. Most lashed out or stormed away. John was doing neither. He just needed to collect himself.
standing. Knowing that the Chef would choose to see him inside the four walls of the kitchen ...
"You know what ..." he began. As the lad stopped in the darkest corner, closest to the kitchen and beckoned him to be seated. "I'm just going to ..."  the lad seemed to understand, but then led John instead back to the restrooms and took his coat. John shrugged. Took himself into the loo and returned to his seat in the quiet corner a few minutes later.

They had spent so much time together, been so engrossed in the web of deceit and trickery that was Jim Moriarty - that neither of them had seen the writing on the wall. The crime that now placed John behind bars.
He also doubted that she had been given permission to reply anything outside of the scope of Sherlock's dismissal from the premises. And so ...
. Where he had been playing ping-pong before, back-and-forth between faces - John now sat just breathing.
The case had been dull. Barely a three, really ... Sherlock wasn't entirely sure why he had taken it in the first place. But he was bored. And he knew he needed something to do when he was bored.
“You’ve reached Sherlock Holmes.
Goal achieved. :)

John’s smile couldn’t have been
He raised his glass and toasted Mike with the last dregs of their ale.
"Too," John corrected from behind fingers, being childish and petty. But he did not care. If Sherlock was going to spit his words back at him, then ...
John dropped his fork. Flagging down a waiter.
“O!” Harry called, as the planchette moved again, “take it down quick!! You
Still there.
“Will you tell John Watson …”
As he hung up the phone he wondered.
John stumbled back. Tripping a busboy, who had been on his way out the door.
John mused on that as he sat there, taking another drink. Wanting to reach for the bottle of whiskey hidden in the cupboard beside him and pour them both out a glass to forget.
John nearly dropped his phone at the comeback.
He knew he needed to pique the soldier's interest.
He was gone.
John’s jaw nearly dropped off his chin at that reply!

? From doing something so utterly stupid ...
This looks delish.
But ... what if John Watson didn’t turn out to be interested?
"John."
Sherlock washed his hair and tried desperately to wash away the thought of any of those ‘ifs’ having been a possible outcome to today's reality. His hands hooked behind his neck and he bowed himself with the weight of it. The water rushing past his ears and down his elbows.
palm … ?
It was like snow now,
about each other."
Softly.
Sherlock whipped his head around, to see John standing in the doorway of Mrs. Hudson's kitchen.
Nat - as she had asked him to call her - was surprisingly supportive.
At the same time his left leg shot out and dropped the other man by kicking out his knees from behind and he heard a satisfying thud as the miscreant hit the pavement.
“I came back,” he said at last. Firmly. As if he was staying put.
You say, and you turn the golden key -
He handed the Nokia flip phone to John. And John held it. Feeling the weight and solidity of the old piece of tech in his hands. So familiar, and yet so foreign …
Don’t you mean the
“Hello? Yes, I’ve already said as much, and who is this?” a rude voice. Smooth and thick, like honey.
Each time, John waited for the inevitable ... “It’s genius,” they would say,  “absolutely brilliant. You say this guy is gone now?” Always praise for him … followed up inevitably by, “such a pity! We could have used his help!”
Knowing he will do you justice. Being the keeper of the light.
Then he thought the better of it.
His hand went back to touch the device in Sherlock’s hand, “may I? actually?”
Did he think it would make things easier? Be kinder? If John thought they were nothing more than friends? Colleagues. Flatmates.
of course.
John tentatively reciprocated the kiss, starting forward. Softly. Barely. Registering if Sherlock made any flinch or movement? As a result of the abrasion of his own touch. And very quickly realizing that Sherlock was not minding the roughness. He was pressing in, and drawing out. Begging John for more …
John felt like he had been kicked in the gut.
He paid her the two pounds for his
… you to do … has been to help others. To fix and to save. Not to hurt. That. THAT … “ he pointed out, “is the BIG difference, Sherlock. And it is an important distinction.”
John stepped back and waved at them both - in dismissal. As they rolled away, shouting out to Lestrade, gruff with emotion, “When you get there, give my love to the Chef? Will you? And tell him

John was nodding. Looking for reassurance? As if he needed to verify if
"May I join you?" A baritone voice asked humbly.
He wanted to chuckle at that.
He picked it up.
John straightened up further. And leaned himself back a bit into his chair. Now having her full attention was a bit intense ...

He didn't know what deity he was asking. Or who was controlling his fate. But he had to trust they were still listening.

He had come in gently then, offering her his hand, and standing her back up onto her feet.

But knew that wouldn't get him very far.
Run off to Italy?”
“What would you like, John?” The man was tipped back in his chair. Languid and somehow … snake-like, in his repose. The chair beneath him did not seem to like being tipped at such an angle, and it really felt almost insulting to the fine restaurant they were in, to be so?
He nodded at Mike. Acknowledging the reality of how messed up
Not even if his own body cried out and gave him a million warning signs … not when it began shutting itself down … and driving him delirious and screaming and demanding it … and forcing it!
Cane long forgotten. No sign of a limp, or pain. Able to run. Ready to run!
… MARY.
"Look, Sherlock," John tried at last. Sherlock cut him off by taking another step forward, still maintaining eye contact. Pinning John into place as he stared up into Sherlock's eyes.
"No one's reading your blog ..."
“Where can I get some good food around here?” John asked above the din.
John Watson had always been a romantic.
Afghanistan? Or Iraq?
He hadn't realized how desperately he had wanted to hear that voice again …   To maybe even … this time … ask a few telling questions?
--< 1 Year, 2 Weeks In >--
Emmy ordered a plate of scallops and shrimp, and John politely asked for whatever the Chef recommended and then they sat waiting. The room was half full. There still was not a candle on his table. And he was glad of it. Wasn't worth wasting on them, certainly.
And what's worse ...
“Disgustingly cheerful -” Sherlock finished, “- YOU KNOW!! Maybe it will get through his defenses?! I’ve seen it work on other people around here. God knows why ...”
Two of the happiest weeks of their collected lives so far.
John blinked.
Bloody genius!
Sherlock was backing away a bit.
When Sherlock dove inside also, scooting in next to him and whistling a signal at the Gondolier. Still grinning? John was confused …
"It is imperative," Sherlock was spinning around. Anxiously playing with his hands. And then fisting them into his hair as he did another loop, still thinking.
Had they?
Do you know why I got angry? hmm?" John asked now, absolutely serious, "back at the restaurant? Do you know what you said?"
To adjust and adhere to the present. The now.
This was Sherlock’s ‘about-to-unleash-a-string-of-deductions-that-sound-a-lot-like-insults’ face.
Whoever thought that losing a friend would ruin one’s life so completely?

She looked the tears that sprang up in her eyes. "Aren't you?" She asked, shaking her head, and gripping his hand tightly. She patted it, "neither am I, dear." She got a grip on herself just as quickly though and sighed, talking of curtains and repainting the basement room to rent out instead ...
He thought dourly.
After a moment, he asked, “So … how did - you?” to clarify about - "

Now as he stood staring down his ale, he wondered why he had bothered?
John followed. Feeling like a schoolboy playing hooky. Sneaking around the hotel in the wake of Sherlock.

As a general rule, Sherlock was downright rude when anyone showed emotion. Emotions were messy things that complicated the facts.
You take his shirtfront apart, button-by-button. The aubergine fabric slipping from your hands, as you shake with adrenaline.
His free hand came up, to ruffle the fringe of John’s hair from his forehead. Smoothing away the creases that had formed in John’s brow, and kissing him there. Pulling him closer.
Go check out the Clueda animated interview if you haven't yet!
He looked the question up at Sherlock. Sherlock lacing their fingers together to hold his hand tighter, before turning to face John fully, “don’t be angry with me, John.” He stated. As if John would.
John eyed him with a 'we-all-know-what's-really-going-on-here-look', and waited for Sherlock to cotton on to his level.
It was traditional at least ... right?!
man! For Christ's sake! … and a Doctor ...

He sat up, putting the menu in his lap

He wasn't sure of his success. But he knew that John would at least think on it. And thinking on it, would buy him some time either way …

John took one last look up at the flat and then turned away. His hand shaking.
And suddenly, he was struck by the fact that tomorrow was ...

So why did he want to find a place to go hide?

As John watched, he shut his mouth (with a great deal of effort). And was tilting his head to the side now, like an owl (or a cat, very feline)...       Thinking.
He meant it.
And now here he was.

Then she added, "do you think there is such a thing?"
Sherlock's eyes travelled up from their intertwined hands then, and he caught John staring openly at him. Like it was Christmas. Like
"Sir, please calm down! Sir?"

"When did he move out?" Sherlock tried, his voice becoming gruff with the emotion he had not allowed himself to show earlier ...
John waited.
The low rumble of the city streaming effortlessly in through the thick walls and paned glass. Alive and radiant. A beating heart, pulsing with life. No matter how many of its residents pursued their sleep.
There had been some buzz in the papers about the establishment. The Landmark had taken on a highly recommended Chef of late, who had somehow managed to uncover an embarrassing embezzlement scheme ... John vaguely remembered hearing of it. Nothing to do with him. Now that Sherlock was gone, he tried to avoid that kind of thing.

The stranger was lost in the crowd crossing a street.
He tried to keep any anger out of his voice. He truly needed to know this, and his brain was not supplying the information for him.

taking such a risk.
Sherlock had come home to the EMT’s leaving, and John put a hand on his shoulder and pulled  him in for a long embrace. They stood silently staring at the leaving emergency vehicles. This time, not taking away a victim or handling any crime. Just the softest, sweetest lady that had ever lived or breathed in their world …
It had felt good to write something out on paper. Even if he had disguised his answer for Sherlock’s. He wondered what would pour out if he decided to put the keyboard beneath his fingers again, and let flow a conscious stream of thought?
of the reception venue …
They enjoyed a few shy moments awkwardly looking away from one another. Before again meeting eyes … and again trying unsuccessfully, to keep from laughing …
As he sat by the fire, sipping whiskeys neat, feeling the warmth pool and harbor deep down inside him. Where he would contain it, and keep it at bay. Store it, and bottle it up, and try not to explode when the next text came …
And loaded …! Family money he assumed.
“Your date here had other plans for you,” Sherlock was rapid-firing, using every ounce of his BRILLIANCE and deductive reasoning to evidently tear this imposter to shreds! “A gigolo,

to find me? Did you really mean that?”
if he was still in a torture chamber, locked away in the cold and dark, away from the sunlight.
He wondered ... why was it so easy to forgive Sherlock?
Sherlock took John’s hand in his. Squeezed it, and kissed him - chastely - on the cheek before hoping back into the kitchen. Being sure to send a note with the dinner that arrived, mouthwatering delicious, and steaming, before John’s eyes.
Sherlock's eyes were open, even as John's fell closed the moment their lips met. John was breathing him in. Engulfing him with all of the affection he had bottled up, every day, every week, every month! He had known Sherlock. He hoped Sherlock was logging every reaction with heightened pleasure. Getting to the fires banked beneath his skin. Sherlock had only to scratch the surface, apparently, to release it. To give it room to breath. A wildfire, roaming free. John felt Sherlock read his thoughts, as Sherlock smiled into the kiss. Their teeth clinking, as they pulled apart. John covered his mouth shyly, apologizing with a look.
Tentatively.

Just           Falcon,
“Well,” he decided to wrap up the inevitable, asking one more time “will you come? Harry? To the wedding?
Or come up with some odd excuse to party late into the wee hours …?? Surely there must be some all night bars here? Or even a rave going on? He hardly cared …

It had seemed so out of character for this posh boy. To reach out to the homeless and the helpless for help. To reward the homeless when others of his station would avoid them or prefer them to be locked up. It showed great care. It showed a heart.
John felt his lower lip being sucked and a soft nip, as Sherlock pulled back. Pleasure and pain warring against each other even as he pressed in for more. The wall behind him dug into his shoulder, and he winced.
His unusual surroundings ... and the soft skin of Sherlock’s shoulder next to his face ... told him otherwise.
She stopped, embarrassed for a moment when she realized she didn't need to go through the spiel and wouldn't have anything to hand him yet anyways ... no menu, no questions. She awkwardly curtsied and left him there.
What did Sherlock Holmes look like? Act like?
It was getting late.
You know full well, that he loved you.

each and every kiss being planted on his lips. Amazed at how eagerly they both reached for each other. Reading each others body language in response ...
She went on to clarify,
Sherlock wished he knew everything there was to tell...
John's thumbs were stroking the back of Sherlock's own gently as he tugged Sherlock down in invitation to kiss, saying "come here."
He grinned up at Sherlock.
He gave him
John stilled.

John was smiling at that.

that Sherlock loved him.
John was realizing just how much he had missed being able to read those very same texts today.
John was in his arms. Their breathing was in sync.
“Oh, I can explain so much better in there,” Sherlock twisted his long neck to point with his eyes towards the bedroom. Slowly turning back to look at John and blink innocently, before his soft little grin crossed his face again, giving him away … entirely.
Sherlock’s hands strayed a bit and then found their way back, trying to keep within the parameters of John’s placement of them.
That in any case
"Don't you try that on me! Why you boys think you can fool this old lady! Come in and give me a hug!" OOF! She pulled him in to her embrace and squeezed. John couldn't help but laugh a little as she let go. "Now what is stopping you from coming in to have a bit of tea with me? You off to an appointment somewhere, Doctor?" She asked with a twinkle in her eye.
The game was

TJLC IS REAL - waiting for season 5
Five seconds later it seemed, as more kissing ensued. Sherlock using his tongue this time. John's mind was exploding with the sensation of having so much of Sherlock focused on him.
Think - -"
They were both breathless with it.
The papers had continued on about the case after Sherlock’s demise, all about how the genius was a fraud, and this poor Richard Brook had been tried unjustly … nothing about Moriarty’s death? It had made John sick, in all honesty. The amount of resistance he had applied to NOT going after and ending the madman himself …  In order to achieve
Like layers, to be peeled back and analyzed. Sherlock had so little to go on.
John watched the others' faces for a clue - as the chefs and busboys and waiters were making way for this effigy to come towards John. They were all looking to this man, the Chef for guidance, for direction as to what to do with this new kitchen nightmare??

She hung up the phone, pinching her nose and leaning against the frame of the doorway to the kitchen. Looking every bit ‘done in’.
Content in the knowledge that he was not going to have to hide anything from John.

John waited until Sherlock was fully seated. All at attention. Hands on the table to show that he wasn't fidgeting. A sheepish look on his face. Pursed lips so that he wouldn’t speak too soon … eyes down on the table.
It tasted …  like forgiveness.
“Right,” John waited. Deciding it was best to just agree. When she did not go into further detail, he ventured another question, “He sent you here to look for Sherlock Holmes?” Nodding as if he understood that much. A statement more than a question really, “Is it about the ash?”

Grinning like the cat who caught the canary, he tried to follow along with Mary as she chewed him out. Gripping his arm and trying to tug him into the next room, his responses of "Yeah, great. Fine. Yes! I'll … uh … I'll be right there." He indicated his wardrobe when she stopped, and signaled that

Mary was always saying it.
He saw the look of infinite sadness cross Sherlock's face, the moment he had pulled the trigger.
Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. Careful not to break the surface tension.

Sherlock looked confused.
It made his heart twist.

John couldn’t hold back a chuckle at that, “two peas in a pod!” John was mocking him, “you would have taken that pill!” He jabbed his finger at Sherlock’s crossed legs, “... just to prove a point! Back when I first met you! And here Moriarty goes and offs himself just to win the little game he started??!!” He laughed, “

of Sherlock ... He climbed into Sherlock’s lap. Their kisses were greedy. Their hands roamed, as if to make up for lost time. They could not get enough. John pressed his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, begging it to part for him. Begging him for more with every moan and whimper that it drew from the gorgeous man … Sherlock opened willingly.

A miserable mess.

Sherlock pulled him back to the bed then, kissing him the whole way. John dropping the shoes, forgotten. His socks coming off next. Unlatching his belt and pulling it loose. The button of his trousers and the zip. Slipping out of them and standing there, starkers in his … he giggled. In his jumper!
He kissed the top of John’s head. Holding him close. Squeezing him in. Wanting to wrap the soldier in all of the love he had had to hold back for weeks now! How it had taken the strength of Hercules to resist day after day, watching his soldier from afar ... and now he didn't have to!
Was the man happy now??

“Still reading my thoughts, I see?” John retorted, playfully.
“So …” Sherlock began, eyeing John with something of a question ready to pounce in his demeanor. John waited. Leaning back and crossing his arms.
He was grappling with the full reality, that this might be his last real moment with John Hamish Watson.
To handle the pressure that he wanted,

Sherlock shuffled over to the kitchen. Chuckling. Unbuttoning his dress shirt as he went, and heading towards the bedroom to change into something more comfortable for sleep attire.
He wasn't.

John nodded. Glad he could still conduct light for someone. Watching as the light filtered back in as if through a lens. And Nat was firing on all cylinders again.

John couldn't help but keep a weathered eye on her. He would wrap it all up for today, if that was what she needed. But he was not going to push her out or intrude. She just needed a moment.
This was John now. This was reality. An angry smile froze his face and prevented the hot stream of tears that threatened to break loose ...
Offer a little comfort.

"John," Sherlock's voice had become soft. John's head whipped up. And he eyed Sherlock with that flame of anger as if about to consume him. Sherlock though, wasn't mocking him. Sherlock was watching him intently.
Several delicious options presenting themselves immediately to John’s hungry eyes. He’d forgotten how much he LOVED Italian food …

John was embarrassed, “No! God no …”
One more deduction, there, than Sherlock had let on about …

His brain was fizzling out gloriously as he listened to the rapid breathing of the man beneath him. Felt his erratic pulse as it raced. Knowing his own must be doing much the same thing ...
John could practically see her filing the information away as she moved on to other questions about the missing detective. He sighed.

Arms reaching around and pulling each other closer ...  Wrapping each other in their warmth. Their bare feet overlapping and sharing space eagerly.

You’re happy, he’s happy.
Sherlock was known throughout the place, clearly - as no one halted their explorations. They had quickly bypassed the kitchen for the hall that led past the night manager’s office. From there they took a set of back stairs up and up and up into the heart of the hotel …

John waited.
He found himself strolling back over.

The smile in Sherlock’s voice so warm and bright

He calmed down. He stated his intention a little more specifically. Calmly.

And criminals had reason to fear.
… and that he himself had frozen. Unmoving …
'Quick! Take my hand, John!'
He couldn't care less.
And who had saved them both from what might have been ...
The fact that John had already figured that much out ... ? He let out a deep rumble of laughter.
Letting his hand slip back around the icy mug of ale, he took a long pull.
John noticed the way Sherlock stood. When they were near. Talking. Walking. Angling towards him.
And then he saw Molly.
"He’s going to be rude to you. Incurably rude. But you can NOT let him push you away!! Do you understand this, Mike? Tell me you understand how important this is?!” Sherlock was taking Mike by the shoulders and spinning him around. Boring into his eyes with a fierce gaze. Mike felt rather like a mouse trapped by a python. Sherlock was being SO serious.
Mrs. Hudson had brought them up their tea. And offered plenty of advice on the flowers and napkins, and any other mundane details that neither of her boys could be arsed to decide on without playfully devolving into bouts of hugs or wrestling in her presence. Which inevitably had led to kisses and snogging, and Hudders carefully tiptoeing out of the room in their wake.
And Sherlock decided then,

and John's heart skipped a few beats as he silently nodded once more, grateful for the invitation, and followed …
No more disguises.
Sherlock doesn’t love you because you’re a lovely doctor, and a crack shot. Though you are all that and witty, to boot! He doesn’t love you because you’ve saved his life more times than that boy can count to. He probably scrubbed half his maths from his memory. He loves you because you are you. Broken bits and all. He never even has to ask you to change. And he never

No answer.

NO - GOD no!
All of these years later?
"Thank you, yes. I am better. Doctor - uh?" John asked with genuine gratitude, "lots of stress this week I'm afraid. Long hours. All that. Guess I overdid it tonight. So much … uh ... food … yeah, so - I'm fine. Thank you. All fine." He went to sit up and felt his head pounding a bit. He slouched back down promptly and then decided to flat out lay on his back for a few.
John was not immune
He looked over again at Mike.
John smiled.
This incredibly real, fantastically unbelievable voice …

John was tired. And the fact of the matter was - Sherlock had staged a suicide to get away from John. Or to do start a new life. Or … God knows what. But it had not involved John. It had not needed John. John was superfluous, and so … John had not been included in the plan. Sherlock had cut all ties quite neatly.
It reminded John of no one tall and lanky with dark curly hair or pale blue eyes … no one at all.
Covering him. Smothering him. Like a blanket.
John was bowled over. He
She winked, "He asked me how much, the reptile! Like I would be bought off!" She placed a plate of scones on the table and then went to the stove to pick up the whistling kettle. "Sherlock was one-in-a-million, I told him, you can't replace that with currency. I should know, my Frank tried!"
It was on the rocks.
How would John have dealt with that?
They came crashing into the flat again at 2:00 a.m.
Found himself typing another message:
Wondering what Sherlock would have said in reply?
Out of respect he told himself.
She had
“Right,” John nodded, stepping up, “ - explain away then?” John pressed up against him and took a few more kisses, so willing, so readily offered, before he himself was pulled into Sherlock’s room by the hand, and the door shut and locked with a twist of the knob.
The way the soldier now leaned more heavily on his cane, despite the fact that his frame was now lighter -
His thoughts dwelt on all of these things. As he looked up and out the thin window of his cell here, at the London police station. The solid white walls. The metal cot. The iron bars. The tick of feet across the parquet floors. The MET. A place he had considered, almost friendly, as of two days ago. Where he had come so many times, in the company of Sherlock. And he was now a guest himself. He laughed a little at his own stupidity. A guest would have the option to leave ...
It was tabloid drivel of course ...
“Be your usual ..." Sherlock made a grimace face. Waving a flourish with his hand to accentuate.
A snort laugh started from behind him, "'Course we can see him! You daft?!"

Of that thought.
He knew. And he found a way to fix it. Without John protesting. Without John demuring or even … realizing he could. Without him catching on. Subtly brought him along as if this was already the plan, and John might as well take advantage of it.
John caught Sherlock’s eye seriously.
Next came a steaming hot cup of black coffee … and … a pot of tea under a warmer? John wondered where they had even conjured up such a thing in a posh restaurant like this.
He sighed. Looking down at the row of silver cutlery and crystal cut wine glass before him. Sitting down at this posh establishment was a terrible idea. He did not fit in here.

And John flushed at the feeling.
Everywhere his eye landed ... further proof that they were now so intertwined ... there was hardly a distinguishable space between where John ended ... and Sherlock began ...

Attempting to get himself under control before asking, but failing as he yelled it out, unbidden ...
He gasped as John's hands slid into his. Interlocking.
It was not a look he had seen before -

Just like his dreams, since Sherlock's fall, he could only do one thing.

You come closer and touch his face then. Needing to ground him. Needing the contact, even if it is with sterile and unforgiving stone. He does not pull back this time.
John laughed then. In disbelief, after they pulled apart to breathe. And Sherlock took a step back. Back to the position he had been standing in a few moments before, as Flatmate. As Friend.
To see Sherlock standing in the door frame between his room and the kitchen.  Also halted.

He had wanted a normal life.

John could feel Sherlock shift in his seat, and scoot closer. Felt his hand slip into the nook between John’s leg and the plush seat.
Mike would understand.
John exhaled in relief - laughing a little at how fast this was going, and followed.
He was feeling much like his eleven-year-old-self today. Desperately wishing Harry was here.

"Every time. I meant 'I love you'."
And that was
John was strong. His pride stronger. He would fight until the last. Until he knew defeat was emminent.
Sherlock noticed he wasn’t looking around.
Another tear spilling, he turned his face away from Sherlock's warm,

He kissed Sherlock’s blushing cheekbones, kissed down his jawline. Licked at his small earlobes. Biting a little … before moving on to his neck. To his pulse point. His collar bone. His shoulders. He undressed as he went down. Button by button. Taking every inch of Sherlock apart before climbing back up and finishing him off.
Sherlock still was incoherent, but very, very glad of the soup and the sugar in his system now - turning a few lights on in the attic - as he watched John, mesmerized ...
Not to the doctor.

him with a finger pressed firmly to Sherlock's lips. His eyes glazed, face in profile.
He stopped at the corner and lifted his feet. Looking at the soles in the dimming light of dusk. A reflection lay on the surface of the cobbled walkway leading to an alley. He eyed it warily as he paused to brush off the sole and release the rock that had been wedged in, irritating his every step. How many times had he huffed an exasperated sigh and followed Sherlock down an alley just like this? Raced? Chased after a criminal? He'd lost count. And now there was no reason to look down an alley.

His eyes wandered around the room. Now really taking in each table. Curiosity returning to him. Now that he was no longer starving. For air or attention.

to ask ...
Of that he was certain.
Sherlock felt butterflies in his chest and could sense the apprehension radiating from John as well. As if they both realized how big this first step could be.
He kept waiting for the day, when Sherlock would get bored of him. The man had an insatiable appetite for new experiences. A dangerous craving for an adrenaline rush. A rapacious way of devouring knowledge. Going so far as to test the limits of scientific experiments, with chemistry and even the occasional drug (Watson had safely warned him off a few of those, by sharing his own personal experience in full detail). But he knew it was inevitable
What would have been the impetus?

“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked. When they had reached the bottom step and were standing beneath a few overhanging branches from the garden above … genuine worry in his voice.
Would he even be interested?
He could never come back after this ... his mind was racing. What exactly had happened?
It was a dance. Back and forth. And Sherlock always loved dancing.

... A snap?
I deduced it, John.
There was a massive island in the center of the room where all of the activities swirled around. Racks were rolling by. Bins being carried back and forth. John spied no less than six chef's aprons. One he knew would be the Sous-Chef, or lead line cook in charge of all the other line cooks. And then the head Chef, the Executive Chef. He was unmistakable. The others buzzed around him like bees in a hive following his every whim and gesture fluidly. He was in charge here and he did not have time to waste.
Minutes went by.

The hotel bar was elegantly furnished. High back chairs served as barriers between patrons in the tight space. Bodies were crushed together in the sweltering heat of the fireplace. And John was feeling nicely buzzed with a drink in his hand, and his best dress shirt on. He’d already caught several approving looks from both women, and
And looked his fill one more time. Relief written all over his face. Subconsciously relaxing as he sat there
Sherlock took an emboldened step towards John. Though he hardly knew how to say what he wanted to ask ...?
… when John turned to take him again.
Not a question as to whether
He looked back in the direction of the would-be thieves and checked all four directions surrounding them, including a glance at the canal, before looking back at Sherlock. All points secure.
He would not give Mycroft the luxury of seeing him
The look on Sherlock's face, would be forever fixed in his memory. Alongside the laughs. The smiles. The rapture. The enlightenment. The aha. The scintillating. The austere. The bored. The petty. The fierce. The chagrin. The hyperfixated. Now there was a new look to catalogue:
One bed. One chair. One desk. One drawer. One gun ...
"I want you by my side," Sherlocked breathed next to him. So quietly, only they could hear. His lips hardly ghosting, as the cameras flashed around them. Both were blankly staring at the crowd that surrounded on all sides. The police escort. The caution tape. The reporters. Here Sherlock was baring his heart out, and wishing - more than he had ever wanted anything in his whole privileged life, that for one precious moment, they could have had the privacy of 221b. The chance to say this in closed quarters. Behind locked doors. And to take it all back, if need be...

Sherlock found himself now being dragged in the opposite direction.
They stepped into each other's spaces and slotted themselves together. Arms wrapping closer. Sherlock adjusting them nearer the wall. Soon John was pinned up against it.
He would begin writing on his blog again. He also decided. As his head hit the pillow that night. Too tired to think, but feeling like he had accomplished something. Which was a big step.

“Sorry! John? Have I hurt you?” He apologized. Letting him go …
He rubbed at his bad shoulder. Feeling the cold seeping in now that it was getting windy, “S’nothing! Just this damn … shoulder. Prize from invading Afghanistan.” He tried for humor, to knock it aside as if nothing, but felt it still linger between them … the connection. Lost.

“Pardon?” John asked. The wind was biting cold. But he liked it. It was sharpening his thoughts and chasing out the last remnants of his beer buzz.
None in his.
And John had found himself on the doorstep of stranger. Welcomed in. A man who knew everything about him. Could tell him all of his secrets, without him having to say a word. Like a lifelong friend. Secrets shared, unspoken. It was a relief. It was a burden lifted. The things John wandered the streets fearing someone
His hand reflexively went for the small of her back as he guided her through the restaurant towards their table, following the waiter. Though he already knew where it would be. In the corner. Almost dark. By the kitchen. And thought to himself ...
He hastened to add - genies and bottles and all - “But I don't want to hear anything bad … if … if that's okay?”

And I doubt yours is up to date.

Proving a point.
Sherlock sidled out of the booth, and held out his hand for John to take.
Being laid bare.
… Much too early for a mid-life crisis.
Sherlock reached out for John's fingers a moment too late - for he had moved just beyond the limitations of the handcuffs binding Sherlock's wrists. His anger flared up, and he yelled at the sky. In a language no tongue was needed to interpret.
But he found he hardly cared.
They were just facts.
After several attempts to ‘bump into’ or otherwise secure a greeting … he had given it up as a lost cause. Not only was he somehow flustered each time! ‘The Soldier’ - a title he found he was rather fond of - seemed to be in his own little world.
Medically trained.

Mycroft would pay for this treachery...

“Say whatever you have to,” Sherlock reminded him, with instructions as he headed for the door, hands gesturing wildly, “if he mentions needing accommodations, let him know you have someone else in the market for a flatmate. If he mentions needing a job, say you know someone hiring. Anything! I don’t care. I just ... need ... a chance. To meet him. He just needs to see me. Once! GIVE. Me. That. Chance! And I will do anything you need for the next MONTH!!”
John felt all of Sherlock’s scrutiny and careful attention on his own fingers. It made them tingle. He tried to steady them.
John had to shake the feeling again. Not exactly what he was expecting …
Ashes, ashes everywhere …
John told himself. But it got John to thinking …
John realized. The man he had conjured was not real.
.... Sherlock's chair covered in a pile of John's books, newly picked up from the local library. Adventure novels mostly, and romantic drivel all of them ...
Her tastes were expensive, but John didn't mind. She giggled too much. Way, way too much. John realized after a few solitary moments of thinking what to come up with next to keep a conversation rolling. It seemed they had exhausted their common ground by leaving the grocery store.
He watched Sherlock pacing back and forth in the room. A bull in a china shop, as his dad would say ...
Bursting with the ridiculousness, that even a waiter could tell this man was a piece of work ...
So where could you have seen
The weight flipped and fell back into his hands. He set it down on the table again. He was trying to avoid John's eyes. Still, he glanced just to make sure it registered.

The trill, sharp and sweet. Barely audible. Breaking his solitude. Asking to be answered.

Sherlock nodded.
He should punch Sherlock. Right in his perfect nose.
He had just said that last bit out loud. He tried to play it off, "I do you know! Talk to ghosts," he raised his eyebrows playfully, "seeing anyone yourself?" he asked. Not really expecting her to think that was funny, but lacking inspiration on any other plausible front ...
Not now.
and then made himself indispensable in it ...
He pinched his nose and just stood there staring at the hall. As if it might transform him, and make him the prince that the story needed here. To make this a real fairytale with a real happy ending ...
He started wandering around the room, hand brushing on things - the sink, the tea kettle, the cabinets …  His hand alighted on the underside of the cabinet, and he lifted a small device for Sherlock to see. “One more reason you should thank Mrs. Hudson.”
Thank God, Mike had not been in the room!
Mike broke the silence at last, just before the vehicle reached John’s intended destination;
John slid it out from underneath the tea cozy carefully, unfolding it. His eyes skimming the words written there. His heart stopping and starting in his chest as he did:
Half term is here! John’s bags have been packed since the night before. Sherlock’s stuff is still strewn all over the room ...
He realized.
As he dragged himself by.

An impressive looking redhead in a black tight leather bodysuit came strolling in like she lived here ...
How to answer?
“My usual … ?” Mike wondered aloud ... ?
. Better and better ...
John was in his arms.
Every night. For a week.
"Knew you weren't dead.” John stated at last. Setting his cup down after having a good sip, “took me a bit, but I put two and two together. Not an idiot you know."
"Anything more I can do for you, sir?" the lad had asked. As John shook himself out of the pleasant turn of events to respond.
Because peppered in, were happy memories of John. And happy memories of John thinking about Sherlock,

"Jesus, Sherlock!" John was desperate, slapping Sherlock's hands away as he tried to reach out to him. Choking back a sob. As Sherlock continued relentlessly, John found himself rocking back against the counter and hugging his own arms close. Knowing this was just Sherlock's curiosity and it could not be stemmed ...
say anything to him
Sherlock really was a mystery, but if this was that important to him? Mike wouldn’t let him down. "And you just want me to bring him back up here? Talk with you? That's it?"
I had feelings once!
Sherlock had played along nicely enough with the dancing, and the begging. He wasn't above employing his own well earned skills in deceit to aid in the capture of a criminal mind so devious. But he had not thought he was taking John in with him. And he began to wonder, had he been fully honest with John the whole time? Had he confused John in any way? In the process, as to what part was a lie? and what had been real?

He laughed an awful, shouldn't-be-laughing crime-scene laugh, at the thought ... the possibility of having had a statue made of Sherlock instead ...? and erected somewhere in London. Would John have gone to see it? His smile broke through his tears. Sherlock would have

Sherlock leaned forward to meet John's lips with his own. Immediately sealing them. Almost like … Sherlock had never kissed before? He held his lips there.
“For him.
Sherlock was supplying, unhelpfully ...
Hours went by.
It is hard,
Right.
John went over to the sink then, and filled up the kettle. The slightest incline of his head registering the present awareness. He was turning it on to make tea. Enough for two, Sherlock noticed, as he got out the mugs.
He requested.
And then one more.
That was nice. Always welcome ... then John's eyebrows rose. He re-read it.
What do people usually say?
John could not wait for the evening's end.
“Soul mate?” the old lady laughed heartily, "you want to know your destiny?!!” Her eyes were wide and scared, as if John had asked for a fearsome thing …
He hadn't wished that since Afghanistan.
He was going to have to look up Sherlock’s agency. There must be a dozen novels about the man already? Fan blogs dedicated to his work??
John wasn't avoiding meeting his eyes.
"I request to see the Chef in person,

All along, he had known that Moriarty could NOT be smart enough to handle all of this alone. Jim Moriarty had proven his genius, certainly. Sherlock bowed to that knowledge quickly enough to not be played by it. But this?? This smelt of Mycroft. And Mycroft alone.

And staring back at John.

and a real smile on his face.
John still trying to really, truly confirm that he - "this man here" he realized he was asking it out loud now, pointing frantically at Chef "this man is ... " he took his eyes momentarily off of Sherlock, but darted right back, as if he might have disappeared even as he asked the question "this man here is real? You can, in fact - see him?" John needed confirmation from someone. ANYONE. Desperately!

John felt disgusted with people. That anyone could do that? That anyone could just ... leave someone … ? Knowingly? In that kind of limbo ...
He was almost disappointed he couldn’t guess her tastes wordlessly … Sherlock would have. She set her cup down politely a moment later. Making a face. Having drank it all still. “Thanks,” she lied politely.

But the mask was slipping, revealing Sherlock's full face and form as he stopped contorting it to look more like an American. To stop sounding like an American. He had been playing a role. It dawned on John.
John laughed despite himself then, “I suppose so. The mystery of why half the world just disappeared?” His eyebrows raised, and he shook his own head at his own idiocy, “I get it. Sorry you’re stuck with just me here, then.” John offered her a rueful smile by way of apology. Knowing he would hardly be of much help.

And so ...

Sherlock found himself grinning back.
He kept the grin to himself. Tucking his head under and gazing at the microscope again.
John wiped his eyes. He wanted to see Sherlock fully. To enjoy this moment. And not relive the tragedy that was the past few months, years of their lives, when they could have had
He thought, and raised his glass to toast the air.
To stop the careening bullet, that was now rushing towards it's intended target. And bound to hit with full deadly force upon arrival. DOA. Intent to kill. Premeditated. Murder.
Where Sherlock's eyes had been closed a moment ago, he was now really looking him over … pinning him with those crystal blue eyes … piercing and haunted … He was mesmerizing. The snake charmer again, with his spells. Reading the signs, John was sure, as his pupils dilated, and his breath caught, and his heart sped up in response … all to Sherlock’s nearness …
- within the matter of a week!
Oh you know.
He looked down at the kettle in his shaking hands and turned away from Sherlock. Hiding the blazing red glow that had crept up his neck and cheeks and was now burning at his ears. He knew his ears were still visible. He never could hide them. His hand found its way to one ear anyways. Feeling how warm they were now. Knowing they practically glowed in the dark, at this point. And he...      slowly dying inside.

“Okay, okay! I get it. I won’t let him rebuff me. And then?” Mike waited for the rest.
His eyes drifted across the darkened room. Taking in the familiar scents and trappings of their shared life together. His and John's.

She finally plopped down in a chair. Then sat eyeing John with something akin to pity. She reached out and took his hand, "Oh John." she said, "It's doing me a world of good to see you healthy and whole."
Mike seemed to reboot fast enough, stammering out, "Old friend of mine - John Watson." He flourished a hand in John’s direction.
He felt ashamed. Like he needed to explain … himself.
John took a breath. He wasn’t boring …
Sherlock’s warm eyes,
John smelling like Sherlock's bath soap ...
Disregarding the cold. Half-expectant. Half-dread.
“Anything,” you reply.
John’s face fell.
Sherlock made a sound that was not entirely decent. Before giving as good as he got, "because, I need to make sure London knows you are off the market!"
John wandered the now half-empty streets of London. The pamphlets that swirled in eddies around the corner as he walked, all showed images of Thanos. Thanos. Thanos. Some were revering him as a god. Praising his decisiveness and action. Praising his ability to save the planet from its own destructive ways! Others - rightly so - posited that his act was purely selfish. A hazing mentality.
Sherlock looked back up.

He needed to see Sherlock.
something Sherlock had NOT intended
It had not just been the cane. Not just the psychosomatic limp that Sherlock had read … no.
John climbed off of Sherlock then, stumbling away. Did Sherlock not … want this? Oh shit.
John realized he had gasped a little at the crush of palm against palm. The smooth of skin and the warmth of Sherlock’s contact ...
As if by sheer force of will he could win this one...
... he hadn't even
But they had another issue to address.
So John had to admit that it was flattering for an unknown author like him to have grabbed the attention of the most sought after publisher in town.
Sherlock was being kind. Playing up to John's temperamental mood - just as Sherlock would have known how to;
John had time to go running odd little errands …  and

He couldn't bear the thought of unsolved crimes, without a Sherlock Holmes in the world to help solve them. Or a brilliant resolution ...  without a genius behind it that would smile quietly at the praise John was sure to give him, for it.

but it was familiarity.
John decided to do something was the only course of action. She had been asking his opinion on things he had known far less about over the course of the past few weeks. Why not offer some of his military trained insights? They had come In handy on several occasions thus far.

your typical upscale restaurant fare.
Watson had watched with humor, as the mask began to slip from Sherlock's stoic exterior throughout that past year. The longer he knew him. If anything, you would think this would have shattered the persona, the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes. Diminish him in some way, in Watson's eyes. But it had the completely opposite effect. It endeared him to him, so much the greater, than if he had found no flaws. No chinks in the armor. At all.

Racing out on the Lestrade case -
He turned up his collar before stepping out of the door. Barely waiting for the cab to stop. Allowing his grin to settle down to something a bit more tame - before John turned from where he was knocking, and could see him.
A wink had settled any fears,
An experiment
Having clearly more guts than brains, the one in John’s grip still tried to move, and John twisted hard. Feeling the horrible grunting sound as he wrenched the arm, and the would-be thief began whimpering - begging to be released. “You’ve broke my arm!” He was whining. Shaking from the pain.
John was mesmerized.
His own head screamed at him ...

Strong enough to catch Sherlock.

The man leaned forward, as if imparting a top secret … “very YOUNG actually.” The man seemed pleased with his answer, “no one ever suspects the young ones. I was …”
And John could just … go … and die of embarrassment somewhere?

Sherlock continued, catching up as if for lost time,
As John walked, he passed several transients. One stooped over a fence, digging in bins. One leaning on a telephone pole, smoking the nub end of a cigarette. Eying John with curiosity.

He was not sure Sherlock would have approved of either his condemnation or his approval.
The man deserved more. And Sherlock knew -

Limps badly.
All pretense of ‘Chef’, and ‘restaurant patron’, were gone.
He hated not knowing.

FINALE
“Ta!” John replied, nodding to the bartender in thanks, as he maneuvered his way out of the enclosed space. A new wave of tourists was already pouring into the lobby.
Willing himself to not turn the brightest shade of red known to be found.
Sherlock pulled John further into the room by his hand. Still held. John was not going to be letting it go, if Sherlock wasn’t …
Before the fall.
A plan to burn Sherlock had been the cover. Yes. Moriarty had made that game
But he dwelt on it for a long time. Longer than he should have.
It had grown out a bit. Not unkempt.

Harry begged and begged … but John would never tell what had been said …

... John's laptop open on the table, displaying Sherlock's hair analysis from the previous case. Work they had been doing together yesterday morning ...
John sidled into the booth. Waiting for Sherlock to appear from the kitchen. Still on duty.
Sherlock looked up.
The giggles turned into a low rumbling chuckle as he imagined the genius with the velvety voice - now having a yellow painted smiley face ... instead of a very 3D human one.
Looking at it.
Delicious looking ...    but ...   ?
Sherlock quite agreed. As they kissed and bumbled their way into the hall. Making out against the wall there for a moment, where he pressed John against him and drew out a few delicious moans for good measure. Before John reached out behind them and killed the kitchen light. Dropping down to lead Sherlock back into
John would take what was offered.
On his blog now, there were only a few readers left that would actually see what he wrote. So the pressure was gone. And he might as well give it a try.
John held on tight. The 'thank you' coursing through his veins, answered by every corresponding beat of Sherlock’s pulse as their fingers knit together.

He wondered. Berating himself for not being happy in this moment.
"John?"
Thank you.
“I need you to verify that the green ladder is still in the gardener’s shed outside! And if so, is the third rung missing? Then call me back. Here. Time is of the essence. The number is …” He rattled off a series of digits, beginning with a country code that John instantly recognized as being foreign, “do you need me to repeat it?”
The murder had not been optional.
Sherlock was not exactly given over to romanticism, and Mike was not exactly a close friend ... So talking about feelings was not something that was going to happen. And Mike was fine with that.
"John?" he begged. And Sherlock,
He had read the room wrong! He spun around and went red from head to foot. Noting that he had already kicked off his own shoes in his haste … he embarrassingly picked them back up now and made for the door. At least he wasn’t naked for the walk of shame ...
Mycroft had insisted on the headstone. And John was grateful for the remembrance. Sherlock deserved to be immortalized.
It was the oculist, by the way.
"Mr. Ramsey?" John's big stupid grin came out now, as he brought his jaw back up to reasonable levels, "Gordon?" He slapped the table, Whispering excitedly to Sherlock near him,  "Gordon

She simply gave him a sad little smile in return, and went back to her text.
He felt himself inclining his head towards Sherlock - closer - asking as he did so, "May I?" to his own surprise. His eyes still trained on Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock turned his face closer - as it dawned on him, just what John was asking. He had been staring down at John’s mouth also - and then - he willingly brought their lips together in agreement.
... It appeared to be
These scenic tour boats were everywhere, John found. A steep fare for a scenic, romantic ride, usually a slow loop through the canals and back to their point of entry. They all had their spots …
Her eyes sparkled.
He felt crushed with the need. To hold. To be closer. To be one.
And John just wanted the one without a cape back.
She snorted, “may have underestimated John Watson, more like.”
There was only

John felt a jolt run through him, at hearing his own name spoken. In
Her hands swirling and twirling around the crystal ball. Muttering something unintelligible like an ancient spell. And then her eyes rolled back in her head and her voice had shifted to a deep, low rumble as she muttered, “something’s coming to me! I’m … I’m getting a name!!”

John felt sorry for the staff that would have to deal with the mawing gap in his wake … but … well ...

Of course he had.

She trailed off. Letting Sherlock ponder on all of that … now that he had one more cup of tea in front of him.
Rolling his eyes.
Sherlock mumbled something under his breath.
His mind racing with the possibilities,

Every detail was vivid in his mind:
There was a note.
Tell him, I wasn’t a machine.
Sherlock dropped the phone and took that last step off of the ledge. Arms outstretched. Like he was flying ...
The reply again, swift:
Valentine's. February 14th of all days.
Sherlock was hardly surprised at this point, when a well dressed staffer came in on patent leather high heels - handed him his coat - and told him he was free to go. At 3 a.m.
Not a thank you.
John certainly hadn't.
A shiver ran down his spine.
And … Sherlock swivelled to look around …
In that moment. Almost like a wish. But felt more like a memory ...
But then he had heard Ella's voice in his head. Asking him to push his limits.
There was a lot

at this sort of thing …” Sherlock was losing the battle of containing a smile behind his lips, “your pants actually look pretty good.” Sherlock gave him a half-cocked eyebrow and lost all control then, folding forward in laughter. John started tittering and gave up the resistance completely. "Shhhh!!" he chided, an eye to the door where Mrs. Hudson had gone, and joining in. Full belly laughter gripping them both and taking the tension out of the room.
It reminded John of Baskerville, with another small grin. He had found himself smiling more today than he expected. With his Sherlock mirror sitting there - blonde, and curved, and as un-Sherlock-like as they came, sitting across from him in Sherlock’s chair …
Hope I didn’t offend you?
ok, I'll behave myself after this chapter. maybe ... (yes, I AM rewriting this bit ...)
“You use a flip phone?” he was asking, incredulous. He couldn’t stop himself.
"I prefer to text," Sherlock popped the consonants, glancing at John quickly. Unable to resist. Then eyes back to the counter.

People will… talk.                                 ("
It felt nice.
“Just human,” John deflated. His eyes scanned Sherlock, as if he was staring at something unattainable … a marble statue of a god, come to life ...
Feeling rather foolish ...

John frowned. Sherlock would not have spoken like this. Beyond flirtation. Quite filthy. John colored red.

The shock hardly registered.
His eyes could not stop staring
John's taut reply, he hoped, would dissuade Sherlock from further comment this evening. Of all evenings!!! Sherlock would have a heyday if not made to
John looked around. The unfinished living space was a mess. Sherlock had pages of newsprint and photographs pinned up with red string all over the room. Clothes strewn all over the floor. A makeshift mattress on the floor nearest the window. A good spot to sit and read, John thought. And could picture Sherlock being there many long nights. And rainy ‘off’ days when he wasn’t playing the role of head Chef downstairs.
He had a serious question to ask now:

He would erect this temple to John watson ... with his bare hands.
He waited until reason had won out over the small hope that he held onto - and his extremities were becoming uselessly numb - before hailing a cab of his own back to Baker Street.
He could imagine the cheeky grin on the other end as Sherlock read his text … if he could only picture the face!

An endless sea of stars out there - hiding beneath the London fog - in the veiled night sky.
But they do not show the burden
Lestrade had not come down to visit him. Perhaps he could not? Without looking like he was playing favorites? It had hurt John, to realize. That even this friendship, would be of no help to him
He wondered how many years it would take? Before he’d get to meet them? It had already been three!
At Mike’s stupidity?
Even if they had shut their eyes and pretended after all the evidence in New York ... and Sokovia.
Sherlock ignored the question. Wrapping his scarf around his neck. Then picking up his mobile and checking it. Forgetting it was supposed to be

Why wouldn't Sherlock drop it and let him escape? Go to his room?
"Back in here, Doctor!"
They went over to a section that was clearly the highlight of the whole tangled web. A central point that zeroed in at none other than Bart’s bloody hospital … and John gasped as Sherlock pointed to it.
Or was it again …
Heroes existed.
Sherlock was humiliated.

Mike nodded, “What ya need, mate?”
This was probably his only chance.
Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.
Two hours before - a willing look.
Sherlock felt like adding one more ...
Don’t keep me waiting like that next time.
Then he made his way back up to his room to order some takeaway.
"I didn't want to be
John blushed. How to tell Sherlock? How to say - how many,
He tucked himself around the corner, pulling another swig from the bottle and knocking his head back against the wall. Breathing a deep sigh of relief.

It was the first time Sherlock had seen John sleep with his back to the door …

“And three?” John asked, impatiently. Not knowing, or caring who this Moran fellow was yet. He was sure they would be getting to that. Soon ...
"Wh-What did I say, John?" Sherlock asked, finally finding his voice.
Noticing the thinning frame -
Sherlock tilted his head this way and that, trying to suss it out. For this man, it seemed like they were, in fact,

The silence was calm. Breathing in the night air, windows down. Lights streaming by and glancing off of the cab, like a mirror on a spinning carousel.
"Exactly!" he replied and thanked her as he began to jot down a quick note:

As John simply nodded, now counting out loud; "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
He saw the man's face as he ducked it down. Tucked his chin in.
John smiled ironically
"John Watson is right here to catch you."
John had never really heard this tone of voice from Sherlock before. The closest he had ever come to such an attitude, had been after the old woman was killed under Moriarty’s thumb, just as she tried to reveal something about the bomber to Sherlock …

Sherlock faked typing up his report. He didn't have nearly enough data from today's research to put together anything of use - and if he was honest with himself - he hadn't been paying nearly enough attention to it. A man's alibi depended on it, he reminded himself, and he also

John must have looked his shock.
John could just hear echoes of what Sherlock would say … if he was seeing his face right now. But Sherlock was just staring down at John’s hand, where it rested on his. On the table.
Vividly locked.

He patted the cold stone as he made his goodbyes for today. His customary, "don't be dead," slipping from his lips as he went.
“What
Sherlock smiled, “yes, it is getting quite deep now. I imagine it wasn’t easy becoming a gondolier in this entirely misogynistic field of apprenticeship.”
Able to demonstrate
"Got my eye on a nice little place in central London," he let the words roll off. No hint of rehearsal about them. He had, in fact, been moved in for weeks now, "together we ought to be able to afford it!" He had absolutely no need for help in affording it, but in that moment he was willing to empty his bank account should he be required to provide proof!

To halt time ...
More memories came to her as she prattled on, Sherlock not minding in the least that it was small talk, and mostly nonsense about himself.
“You are not the one that owes apologies, John,” Sherlock corrected, “what I did was unforgivable. There was a plan. It went wrong. I had to make do. A snap decision, one I’ve regretted daily. Trust me ... I … never meant to hurt you in the process. I wanted to include you ...  it was ... just

He tried again to collect himself, before turning his face to be visible by Sherlock again. Lips tight. His other hand a fist on the railing.
THIS John Watson was not my John Watson -
It suited a Chef.
John responded to the touch. Making a soft sound before pulling away, with one last, drawn out kiss of his lips, before bringing their foreheads to rest together. Humming. Holding. Pressing them there together. As if a bit overwhelmed in this moment. And needing to just ...

John hoped he spilled it all on that ridiculous suit …
There was a cold wind shearing it's way through his thin jacket and he could not wait to reach the restaurant. He needed a nice quiet, gentle place to rest for a few hours undisturbed. Able to people watch and not look conspicuous doing so. A restaurant was ideal. As long as you kept ordering food (and paying for it) they were more than happy to oblige. John knew he would find himself staying longer and longer hours each Friday night, if he returned. Maybe he could ask the manager to set aside a table for him?

His brilliant mind had wandered John’s psyche like a library and had checked out all of the volumes with care.
He felt the dead phone in his pocket, realizing

A man who's magnetic pull seemed to draw him out more intimately than any friend before ever could - or ever would. And yet - he could have spent the next fifty lifetimes just trying to understand the man himself.
Sherlock nodded.

His eyes went back to Sherlock. “Are you … are you here for a case still, then?” John asked, again looking around with dodging eyes at the scenario. The restaurant. The hotel. The …  oh
John was looking around and finally finding something about the environment comforting. Maybe just the fact that he had been invited in? For his next words were:
A review of one text alone would have called out the glaring differences!
Then shut his mouth and waited. Anxiously. As John stepped up into his personal space.

An appropriate level of fear and awe crossed his face as he met John’s unflinching gaze … and transferred it to his bigger companion, before he fled.
Sherlock was still in his seat. And John in his … when they pulled away. But it mattered less and less. They were
Irene had said something similar that day. To tempt Sherlock. To try and claim him. To pull him away from John. Right before his eyes.

That voice was deep … and he was suddenly wondering .... ?
He decided not. John was far too humble.
And certainly
His gait.
He felt like John for a moment.
John sipped at his black coffee. Studiously ignoring the figure that sat across from him in the darkened booth. His fork lifted again to his mouth, and the ghost again spoke as the fork touched his lips.
He ordered the Filet Mignon and sat quietly enjoying his dinner when it arrived. It was truly remarkable. Not quite what he wanted, some home cooked fare...  But he had had enough remarks back and forth in his head tonight. And this was nice.
“Sherlock Holmes!”
... He couldn’t be trusted!!

Symphonies wanting to escape their birdcage of blood and bone. Fluttering to the cadence of his lungs, and tripping to the beating of his heart on repeat.
Mrs. Hudson would be out like a light. No doubt having taken some herbal soothers. Knowingly, or unknowingly - John suspected she would be happily dreaming the night away.
No more battles to haunt him ... No more life or death scenarios to torture himself over ...
John read the letters off: “S. H. E. R. L. …”
"Good to see you, Mrs. Hudson!" John called over his shoulder. Continuing forward resolutely.
John was a soldier. He knew how to aim. How to swiftly, mercilessly, end a life - if it was required.
John looked the question mark up at his waiter's beaming smile, and did not have the heart.
The food was phenomenal.
And it was at that moment,
John could see that. Nodding again. Looking over Sherlock’s tux now, realizing … that was no waiter's tux … much too formal. Fitted. High quality fabric. Distinct cut …
Natasha Romanov?
John's jaw must have dropped, for he foundered to close it again. Matching him look-for-look.
His hand was making it’s way up Sherlock’s arm, checking for dexterity. No flinches or responses of pain to the touch, and then curving around to hold onto his neck. The tips of his fingers brushing gently into the nape of his curls, beneath his collar. Feeling his carotid artery pulse. He felt Sherlock vibrate with the touch. Involuntarily, his eyes closing …
