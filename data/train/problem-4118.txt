“Okay, fine,” Sam conceded, “I’m just saying, if… you know, if the opportunity presents itself don’t hold out on my account. Would be nice not having to deal with your snoring for one night.”
Again, Alejandro let out a small, throaty laugh, and he reached out to take one of Dean’s hands and brought it between their bodies. “Just do what you did earlier, and I won’t be long either.”
Suddenly, as he sipped on his coffee, a thought occurred to him.
“As an ASL teacher for adults,” he replied, and this time, the smile on his lips turned a little brighter, lasted longer, and it was clear to see the pride in it. However, his brow was also furrowed slightly, and he regarded Dean with a regretful expression that made Dean feel even worse than if his brother had been blasé about it. “There’s a learning center for people who recently lost their hearing, up in Lincoln. It’s a pretty big opportunity. Good employer. It’s a municipal institution with additional funding from a private foundation. The payment would be pretty good, too. And with it being a bigger city, I’m sure I could find something a little more challenging than doing maintenance, too.”
glad his brother was finally happy.
As Alejandro was checking some home decor items in a store window, Dean spotted some display rack with the more campy, touristy variety of clothing - typical sombreros, ponchos, shirts, and dresses in traditional Mexican patterns and colors. He also spotted something that was probably a little more exotic for the locals - hats that more closely resembled American cowboy hats, and Dean stopped to look at them, feeling a strange mix of emotions in his chest once more.
There was a heavy pressure inside of him suddenly, forcing its way up his chest, through his throat, and up his nose and eyes. Tears prickled in them, and Dean wiped his eyes as he sat up, looking down at his feet on the dark hardwood floor. Of course, Cas had not come back. He never would. Dean just had to continue living with that.
“Salud,” Dean replied and took a sip, waiting for Alejandro to take his first bite of the burger to see his reaction. To his great delight, it was one of pure pleasure. Alejandro’s eyes fluttered shut, and he let out a sound that could only be described as a moan.
“Oh, we talked about his sister and her husband earlier. And he mentioned something about them not having seen nearly as much as we did.”
He tried desperately not to think, not to remember, not to see Cas in his mind. It wasn’t images of that night when he had first met the angel that haunted him now, but so many others, so many occasions that formed a jumble of images and emotions in him that threatened to bury him under their weight. Most of all, it was those last moments back in the dungeon of the bunker, and he could practically hear Cas’ voice in his mind, could hear the words that had shocked, shaken, and changed him forever.
“Wow. That is, I have to say, really awesome,” Alejandro said as he returned to the table with two new bottles of beer. “Just a shame you can’t really go around and tell everybody about it.”
, he felt something akin to shame. And beyond that, even, as ridiculous it was, fear. Fear of what his dad would say or would have said if he knew.
“Getting together is amazing, and yes, especially when one of you just came back from the dead,” she said with dry humor, “But… being together, experiencing all those firsts together, that’s what’s truly awesome. And if you’ve found the right person, it only gets better and better.”
Confused by his own feelings or not, Cas could not miss that this was hard for Dean, and he felt a swell of sympathy in his chest. “Dean, we don’t have to talk about it. I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable.”
“That’s nice,” Dean replied before he put the backrest of the chair up and settled down again more comfortably.
Sam didn’t say sorry, but he also didn’t continue, and Dean was grateful for that. Where silence between them had often been natural, comfortable, it now felt heavy, though. Like a vacuum that was trying to pull something from Dean, to be filled with truth and honesty. The pull inside himself was stronger, though. A part of him knew that keeping everything bottled up wasn’t the ideal way to handle things, but the fact was that he simply wasn’t ready. He didn’t know if he’d ever be.
Rationally, Dean knew all this. Rationally, he also knew that he had never held it against other hunters if they actually turned their backs on demons and monsters and started a normal life. However, with each mile he drove, Dean felt an anxious, tight sensation in his stomach that couldn’t be anything but guilt.
And damn, I need this pandemic to be over already because I want to go to quite a few of the places that are mentioned in this chapter. Most of all the last ;-)
Here's another chapter that, as you can see, goes back to the time right after Cas' death and after defeating Chuck. I realize the timeline is a bit messed up. I was trying to research what the possible time frame here was and found only rough estimates and guesses. One of them placed the events of eps 18 and 19 roughly in April, so that's what I went with. (The entire SPN timeline is such a mess anyway, because in some seasons and episodes, they jumped ahead by months and even more, and then it didn't line up anymore, but I'm just ignoring that ^^)
Of course, he had always had that, and he’d made good use of many aspects, many pleasures of life, before, too. Up to the point of defeating Chuck, however, it had always felt like he had to rush through everything, take and savor it as long as he could, and often pass up on opportunities too because their life, their responsibilities, got in the way. Or his own, stupid self.
It also hurt to know, once again, that he could never make up for the wasted opportunities. Never say what had never been said. Never give back just a tiny portion of what Cas had given him that night he’d died.
Another thing: I 'stole' a line from something one of you said in a comment early on. ZissaVulpes, I hope you don't mind ;-) When I read your comment back then, I loved that line so much that I saved it for this chapter.
“Hmm, not quite in the mood today?” he asked softly, resting his chin on Dean’s upper stomach, a hand caressing his shoulder.
“Salud.”
have in common - Dean and his father had always been polar opposites. Dean just had to learn to honestly believe that.
the impact of it - of finally being free, truly free. And hell, he deserved to feel something good for once, even though he’d doubted that very fact many times.
When Sam and Eileen had first started talking about moving in together, Dean had wondered about that. Had tried to see himself with someone, but every time he had wanted to imagine a face, there had been just one he could see.
“Yeah. Hilarious. And now shut up and eat your breakfast.”
It was a bit of a surprise when, after one of the remaining two had temporarily incapacitated Sam with a heavy punch and then both of them having pinned Dean down on the floor, he got to meet another member of the nest, and, after a moment’s pondering, recognised her as Jenny, a girl they had failed to save from a bunch of vamps back fourteen or fifteen odd years ago or so. They didn’t have time to exchange any pleasantries or unpleasantries for long. While the two male vampires still held Dean, Sam came up from behind and cut off Jenny’s head with a clean blow, and the fight commenced.
sat on a horse before but had no actual theoretical knowledge of horse riding. Yolanda, their guide for the day, briefed them on some basics about what to do and what to avoid before they got to meet their horses. Sam got a larger, brown gelding, with a calm, good-natured disposition, and Dean was given a slightly smaller calico mare who seemed a bit more lively but equally friendly.
I have a bunch of regular readers in our discord server, and recently, they've given me their speculations on what they expect when Cas is coming back and how that's going to go. I'm really curious what you all think (not that I can tell you if you're right or wrong, but I really love hearing people's theories). So if you have any thoughts on this or other things you're speculating about, please let me know.
“Jesus Christ,” Sam just mumbled to himself, not wanting to imagine what points they had or had not reached until then, and also not believing what a couple of idiots his brother and Cas were. Even now, after finally having gotten their shit together and starting to date, they still couldn’t manage to communicate properly. He so wasn’t ready to be their relationship counselor for the rest of their stupid lives.
“I remember a lot of things,” Alejandro replied, now sitting down comfortably on the armchair between the stereo and a table with art supplies. “For example, how you said the story of your and Sam’s hunting adventures was one for an entire night. And since it’s only half-past ten…”
Dean was still thinking about this when he had put his phone away and gotten ready for the night, not quite yet tired enough to sleep. His thoughts automatically drifted from Charlie, Garth, and others to Cas. He had always called Cas his best friend, and in many ways that was true, but in many others, it wasn’t. What he and Cas had shared - so much was clear to him now - had always been something different, always skirted along the edges of something much deeper, and sometimes something a little… well, messed up.
of them, though - geewobbles for her great work so far, and zophiezee for taking over and also having done a really good job! <3
It's not Tuesday yet, but I can't wait to post this chapter. You may know why when you read it ;-)
“Nope,” Dean replied, again wondering where his brother was going with this, but Sam said nothing after that, just finished his smoothie and started clearing the table, content with that response.
If Alejandro did notice something, he didn’t say or show it. His fingertips just gently danced along Dean’s lower arm, up and down in feather-light movements, and after a while, Dean felt his mind calm down. Not entirely, but enough to smile when he should, and after a while, that became easier again.
“Oh!” Her face lit up in surprised delight. “Just a mo, honey,” she said softy before she turned and poked her head around the corner of the bar into an area where Dean expected the toilets to be, but he spotted a third door, slightly ajar.
Dean couldn’t help but wonder how much Alejandro could make with that. It wasn’t exactly packed and hadn’t been all day.
So here's another chapter, a bit sooner than expected because my beta-reader was quick. :-)
“So,” he said at last as he drew back and got up to put the guitar away, “What do you want to do today?”
to get back to. Sure, there were people he was close to, and his dog that he missed, but, strangely, and despite the old saying that absence made the heart grew fonder, he missed them all a little less every day.
“I’m not sure,” Dean replied, trying to force his thoughts or the way that physical contact made him feel for a split-second to the back of his mind. He put on a smirk. “I mean, I understand only half of what they’re saying, so I really couldn’t tell.”
So, so sorry guys. I made a post about this on tumblr, but I don't know how many of you are following me there, so I'm hoping you weren't too disappointed (or even concerned) that there was no update this Tuesday. The thing was, I recently started watching 9-1-1, and the second-last episode last week as well as the finale this Monday had my last two brain cells scream the name of the biggest ship of that show. Big stuff happened, and I've still not fully processed it ^^ (if any of you need a good show to watch with an overall very diverse cast, amazing characters and a super super cute and amazing ship - buddie - give it a go).
“Lie down,” Alejandro whispered against his stomach, kissing his way further down, but then - both luckily and unfortunately - leaned back again to open the button of Dean’s pants. If he had kept his mouth there, Dean would've lost what little control he had left.
“I’m on vacation,” Dean shot back and, after his first sip of coffee, finished the math in his head, realizing he had slept a good seven hours last night.
A part of him knew these dark thoughts were not entirely rational either, but he couldn’t help it. The feeling made his stomach clench and his heart twist so heavily that he almost hoped Alejandro would beg him to get in his car and come back.
Following an impulse, Dean sent the photo to Claire - just that, without any comment. It was still pretty early, and he had no idea if she was even up yet, but she could check it later. Maybe it would make her smile, he thought as he went to the bathroom for a quick shower and then got dressed for the day.
and a winking emoji.
“Did anybody play it? I don’t remember leaving it here,” Dean asked, looking at Colin with a teasingly stern expression.
Dean rolled his eyes, suppressing a laugh. “Yeah, no, I fully expected we’d just drive off with twenty burgers and without packing a thing or you saying goodbye to your girl first.”
,’ but Dean didn’t so much mind being ridiculous about this.
without sounding like a crazy gullible person who believes, as you’d call it, every batshit insane story they hear.”
I hope you enjoy this chapter. The gifts Dean and Sam give each other are actual things that exist, which I was very happy about finding. If you google them, you'll find them too.
Dean turned off the water and headed for the kitchen, pouring himself a large glass of tequila, focusing on the heat that trickled down into his stomach as he drained it with three large gulps and ignoring the fact that he knew this wasn’t good, wasn’t wise. Wasn’t what he’d promised Sam months ago. He couldn’t find it in himself to care.
There it was, as Cas had partly expected, but that didn’t stop his heartbeat from going up a few notches, a strange chill running down his spine, and something in his midst that made it feel like he could not fully fill his lungs with oxygen. It was hope, fear, shame and everything else he could not fully make out yet because his body was simply too loud for him to hear his own thoughts.
I should have written these author notes days ago. Now I feel I can't remember everything I wanted to say.
“But I made a deal with the Shadow. It… it wanted me. Why would it let me go?”
r’ and ‘
Dean rolled his eyes at Sam, but he was too giddy to get into any playful arguments. It was true that he had no real experience with horses to speak of, except for one time, but he was rather determined to not make an ass out of himself. After all, he’d also been rather skilled on the mechanical bull.
I do want to take this opportunity to thank
“Maybe you can sing another song, another time,” Cas suggested, and there was still that soft, warm smile on his lips that Dean could barely get enough of. He’d sometimes seen Cas wear a similar or even, in rare moments, this precise expression, but ever since he had come back, it had almost become the default for him. It wasn’t difficult to guess that Dean was at least part of the reason for it, and that fact made him just so
Dean nodded slowly. “I know they probably weren’t the best people. Those schools, it was bad what they did to the kids back then.”
On their way back, Dean was mostly quiet, and it was Alejandro who picked up a conversation after a while. He told Dean that his mom had always liked birds which was why he had chosen a vase with hand-painted birds and leaves on it, and went on to explain that he also still had to find Christmas gifts for his family but hadn’t yet decided what to get for everyone.
Or maybe, a small voice in the back of his mind wanted to say, he still felt such loss in his heart that would take a long time to heal. Longer still, if he didn’t even allow himself to begin to cope with it. It probably would be healthier to address it, to allow himself to wallow in misery, to cry - which he hadn’t done since right after it had happened - but when had Dean Winchester ever been one to do what was healthy?
a job, just that nobody was paying them to do it. Now, however, they probably needed to come up with some long-term strategies on how to survive financially, and Dean honestly had no idea where to even start with that. “You’re lucky Eileen has some money.”
“Yeah. Um… Allan gave it to me. It used to be his wife’s.”
… haven’t seen
I want to say something about how I brought Cas back and why. I know of at least one of my regular readers who prefers Cas as an angel, but bringing him back as a human has always been the plan.
As anticipated, Alejandro’s brows went up, and his eyes widened. “You-- you what? You’re shitting me now.”
Alejandro gave him a small smile, then slid his chair closer to Dean’s and laid one arm around his shoulder. The gesture itself was casually intimate, his fingers on Dean’s upper arm were warm, and Dean already thought that maybe Alejandro had a good idea on how to pass the time until they’d go out for dinner as they were planning. But then, after squeezing his shoulder briefly, Alejandro let his arm sink down again and shifted his position to face Dean.
. Hell, part of me has known for years, and I probably should have said something, and--” Sam huffed out a short breath in frustration.
It took him a long time to go back to bed and even longer to fall asleep again, trying to think of anything but that. Anything but Cas.
During the night and early morning, the wind had picked up a notch, bringing with it some cooler air but not enough to forebode a chilly day. It was still dark out when Dean woke up, surprisingly before Sam. So to avoid waking him, he moved the coffee maker to the bathroom, made some coffee, and then sat down in one of the two chairs on the balcony, looking out over the sea. The sun was starting to rise on the horizon, painting the dark water golden where it touched the rippling surface. Dean had to admit he’d hardly ever seen a sight more beautiful than this in nature, something more calm and comforting.
Sam shrugged faintly. “He, um, kinda made a comment once. About you and…”
Admiring the artwork of it was the only reason Dean had not immediately drawn his eyes from it, and even let his gaze linger after Alejandro had already let his top slide down over his pants again. Or so he told himself.
2. Whenever something in Spanish comes up, I hope I got these things right. I have a person from Spain helping me with translations, but Mexican Spanish is different in some aspects. If you are Mexican and think I got something wrong or do so in future, please let me know.
Instead, though, Dean had hidden the book under his mattress whenever his dad had come back home because, for some reason, he hadn’t been sure his dad would have approved. Dean had been twelve years old and, in his father’s eyes, already
Cas probably had to adjust to all of this, Dean thought when hearing the answer, had to figure out what to do with a perfectly mundane, human day. Of course, over the years, he had done a couple of rather human things, like binging Netflix shows, but Dean also thought that that probably wasn’t on the forefront of Cas’ mind right now.
The truth was, no matter how much he had enjoyed himself tonight and how much he wanted to feel anything but guilty about this, a small part of him did. Not because it was wrong or shameful. Surprisingly and to his relief, he had felt none of that - no more internal rejection and judgment. Being with another man, with Alejandro, had felt good and natural and rewarding. What he did feel guilty about was not having realized all this sooner, and he wondered - trying not to, not to think of it, not to imagine it, but failing - what it would have been like. With Cas.
“Can I ask another thing, though?” he started after a moment, and Dean turned his head to look at him and prompted him to go on with a nod.
Dean wanted to brush it off, to deny all his brother’s questions and just let it rest, let it rest with his father and the complicated relationship they had had. But another part of him, one that still felt vague and fuzzy, difficult to grasp, wanted out, wanted to understand and to learn and not deny and ignore.
“We? You mean you, me, and Eileen?”
“Hey,
“Did you say… quad riding?” Dean asked at last as he got out of bed and went over to the table where Sam had already poured him a large mug of coffee.
Cas would have very much liked to flip him around then, grab him by the booted ankles and pound into him with all the need and impatience he felt rising in him, but apparently, that was not what Dean had in mind.
“Hm, doesn’t that sound romantic,” he half-joked. Dean also couldn’t deny that he had always kind of envied people who’d found their calling in hunting and made a deliberate choice to join the life, rather than being pushed into it as children. And more so, if they hunted together as partners, though he had also seen too often how that could end.
“Dean! Look out!” someone shouted. Someone that wasn’t Sam. Someone whose voice Dean would have recognised anywhere but could not be hearing right now because… no, it was impossible.
“Don’t you?” Dean asked again, one hand sliding onto Cas’ chest, roaming upward in a fluid, firm movement. Then, he used it for purchase to raise himself up higher, and his eyes fell shut, head siking back slowly and lips parted with relish as he let himself sink back onto Cas.
Maybe he couldn’t say he felt that he was
long story. But, um… back to the King of Hell.” And that was definitely easier to talk about than how the forces of darkness - or Chuck, actually - had prepared this long game with their parents, the apocalypse, and everything in between that had shaped and predestined his and Sam’s entire path.
“Then you should probably go.”
“But,” Alejandro went on and looked back at Dean with a smile that seemed encouraging, “you’re not like them. We’ve had such great times together already. You’re really great fun to be around, and I hope that whatever-- Well, once you go back home to America, we’ll stay in touch. Because I really like you, Dean. And… at least for me, this thing has become more than just an arrangement for casual sex.” He let out a small, breathy laugh, somewhat bashful, and it all tugged at something in Dean’s chest, filling it with warmth but also something like anxiousness. “I mean… friends. I don’t know you that long and not as well as Raúl or Nando and the others, but I do consider you a friend. And that means it’s really perfectly and totally...
Dean felt a little calmer at that reply, because it was the exact middle ground between the two replies he had imagined.
Dean just shrugged but smiled nonetheless. When he teased Cas like that he knew it was understood the way he meant it because, hell, he wouldn’t want Cas to be any different.
had learned from his father’s mistakes. It wasn’t something he would have claimed to have done without being pushed towards that realization, but thinking about it now, he knew it to be true. He had done better with Sam than his dad had ever done, and with Ben, Claire, and despite all the things he still couldn’t forgive himself for, even with Jack. At least, Dean had never pushed his own agenda on them, had never made them feel ashamed for wanting things for themselves or for just being kids.
“It sounded like he meant a lot to you,” Jesse now commented, who obviously had gotten the same impression as his husband, and Dean could see how.
“Maybe,” Sam replied, cryptically, and when Dean asked what, he remained tightlipped and simply said he’d find out soon enough. And although Dean didn’t exactly like not knowing what Sam had planned, he realized he had lost and was just going to have to wait and see.
Once the lights were out and both of them laid in their beds, he thought more about that birthday. It had been almost twenty-five years, and the emotions the hunt had triggered in him - the trauma, really, that it had caused. He also thought of Raúl, who could sit laughing and drinking with his boyfriend despite having been hit in the face and kicked out by his own father. And then about his own father, who had treated Sam almost the exact same way for something as mundane and normal as wanting to go to college. Parents could try their hardest to mess up a kid’s life; sometimes, they’d succeed, but that didn’t have to be the rule, and Dean hadn’t been a kid for decades anyway.
“Hey.”
It was lunchtime when they returned to the ranch, around two hours after they had ridden out, and Dean patted his horse goodbye as he and Sam walked back towards the main building. Sam winced a little and rubbed his butt, walking with his legs much more apart than usual.
Sam rolled his eyes slightly but looked at Dean in amusement. “Well, as you said, we’re on vacation.”
“I could have come around and allowed myself to love you.”
“I think you are,” Alejandro returned, tone teasing.
As he took the first spoonful of eggs, tasting the slight spiciness of chili peppers and the freshness of tomatoes in them, his mood instantly picked up. He just could have done with a bit of meat in the dish, too, but that was only a small downside.
“Thought so.” Though Dean kinda wanted Cas to tell him nobody else could compare with him.
It took a few more slow breaths from Alejandro, who’d opened his eyes again, until he nodded slowly with a small smile on his lips, and Dean slid into him deeper until he was all the way in, the tightness overwhelming him a little. Or a lot.
“Sorry about that, but you asked.”
“Yeah. That about covers it. Cas is back, and I’ve finally got my head out of my own ass and admitted what he means to me. I don’t think it can get much better than that.”
mean that. You didn’t say… you know? I got that part right. You didn’t mean you loved me like a brother, but… Y-- you
Also. Yeah. I'm kinda really, really, really fucking curious what you all are gonna say about a little something here. I mean two little somethings, but one other little something that may not be as little as the first little something. I'm not making much sense here; you are confused and thinking 'the hell did she smoke?'. Nothing. I'm just giddy about this. Don't rip my head off.
“There’s something called library science?”
One hand on his knee, Dean braced himself as he looked away to obviously collect his thoughts, and Cas sat there, not daring to say anything or even take more than short, shallow little breaths.
Another funny thing: When I was writing about Dean cooking, I instantly had to make the recipe he was doing and test if it worked. In case you're interested: https://leandra-winchester.tumblr.com/post/642568295679164416/normal-people-writing-dean-winchester-made-a
“You can start to move,” Alejandro all but breathed, wrapping his arms around Dean’s upper body and pulling him down. When Dean had caught his breath and gotten used to this intense feeling, he leaned down and let their lips meet for more kisses, slow and open-mouthed, in tune with the measured rhythm Dean was picking up.
He went behind the counter and pulled a book out from next to the cash register.
Sam looked at him and nodded. “Yeah, sounds good to me. Down to the beach after that? We got that snorkeling gear I bought yesterday to try out.”
While he had enjoyed all of that, most of the time, thinking back, it almost felt like it had been a kind of performance. As if those were the only things he was
It was Cas who made him stop in his tracks. “You got a guitar?” he asked with surprise both on his features and in his tone, and Dean held the instrument in his hand a little longer, turning it back around.
It was kind of funny when all that psychology crap one always read or heard about proved itself to be true a few days later. What Dean had desperately tried to realise and truly feel, he said to Sam when, for the first time in a while, he brought up Cas and Jack.
After a while, he succeeded. There was still a dull, heavy ache in his chest, but he could breathe more freely again, had his tears in check, preventing them from forming as he took one, deep and slow breath to find the energy to force them back completely.
“Salud,” Dean replied and maintained the eye contact for a moment as he drank. “So, speaking of other languages, how come your English is so damn good?” Small talk. You couldn’t really go wrong with that, plus Dean
I have a second beta-reader now, which means I'm splitting chapters between the two of them and will be updating more frequently from now on. I aim to post two chapters per week. This one was still edited by my first beta, and she'll do the next one by approx. Friday or Sat.
And finally, it seemed to click as Cas’ eyes widened, his mouth forming a tiny ‘o’, and he leaned back in his chair. Then, however, his brow furrowed again. “I’m still not sure I fully understand.”
Dean took a deep breath, rolling his eyes slightly, more to himself as he listened to the music that, admittedly, wasn’t bad at all even though he couldn’t understand the lyrics.
There was really not another living soul to be seen anywhere around, just a few boats far out on the sea. It almost had Dean feel like they were stranded on a deserted island, just the sea and the sand, and them. In the shallow water, he reached for Alejandro’s hand and pulled him close, bringing their lips together for a kiss that tasted of saltwater as cool lips were sliding against his own.
“Don’t you fucking dare!” Dean said, ignoring the implications in Sam’s words for the moment. Then again, there wasn’t anything that spoke against staying a whole night for once. They both knew this was just a casual thing for the duration of Dean’s stay.
“Well, I’m not gonna say no to that,” he said and opened two more bottles, clinking them together as soon as Dean lifted his. “Salud.”
“You seem somewhere else with your thoughts, though.”
“Also, my hair’s not quite long enough yet to comb it with a fork,” he said then, smirking, and saw Alejandro roll his eyes in amusement.
Dean could have teased him a bit more, could have added another remark, but instead, he just looked back out towards the sea, squinting against the brighter sunlight and watching the soft waves as the water slowly turned a brighter blue.
There was a human expression Cas had always found interesting and hilarious: to look like a deer in the headlights. He knew that this must be precisely what he looked like, but he could not bring himself to… to do anything, speak or breathe or even think.
I do hope you enjoy this chapter as well. Please let me know and drop me a comment. :-)
I used another poem by Alma Perpetua as the start of this part, and... I guess it's no spoiler when I say that one's kinda foreshadowing what's about to come, soon ;-)
hadn’t felt that way, he and Cas might not have found their way back to each other as they always had.
“Ah, shame. This beach here looks really nice. So does this bar,” And okay, maybe that had sounded a little flirty, though Dean hadn’t even meant it that way.
“I guess it’s your lucky day, son. All six are free.”
“Right, I need some breakfast. How about some eggs and bacon?”
And, maybe, life was good after all. Or it could be, eventually. And he could learn to live with the guilt of causing Cas’ death, accept it as a part of him. Among everything, that seemed to be the hardest task of all.
“So…” Alejandro started, both of them having been quiet for a while, maybe both equally lost in thought. “How about some mindless entertainment, and then we see where this night is heading?”
A little later, one topic that came up caused the group’s mood to shift to a more serious one. Raúl, who was sitting there next to his boyfriend, Fernando, started talking about his parents and his father in particular. It was a story like one everybody had heard somewhere, or seen in a movie or TV series, and Raúl spoke of it with little regret, just some residual bitterness, and anger when he explained how his father had hit him and then kicked him out after finding out his son was gay.
“My is Captain Janeway,” Luisa said before Adriana leaned in and added, “Not the captain; she is in love with Seven of Nine.”
“Yeah, you definitely won’t need me third-wheeling,” Dean admitted with no hesitation.
Dean was kissing him so gently, patiently like Cas could never have imagined a kiss to be like, least of all from a man like Dean Winchester, who was always so rough on the outside.  Cas had imagined that when pursuing someone else, Dean would always be passionate and playful, coy and self-assured. Now, he was the exact opposite, all careful and hesitant, uncertain and patient.
He couldn’t help but wonder if, maybe, had he stood up to his father then and for his friend, he could have prevented Lee from becoming what Dean had found out last year.
Cas left his index finger between the pages and closed the book this time as he turned to look at Dean. “Dean, I’m sure Eileen will be fine, and we’ll hear about your new niece or nephew when we do.”
“Hm, I kinda like it, too,” he said softly, around a smirk as he brought his hands to Alejandro’s hips, still cool from the dampness of his swim shorts, only warming up where the sun kissed his skin and where Dean’s thumbs drew small circles.
Like the café, the cabin was clean and lovingly decorated, although a touch more modern and timeless than the café. There was a small sitting area in the front with a kitchen unit at the side, at the center of the building a large stone fireplace that Allan had lit, telling him it should provide enough warmth for the remainder of the night if he added a few logs later.
Whenever he tried to imagine himself running such a place, Dean also found that he could not see himself taking on such a pursuit alone. He just didn’t know who to picture himself with, and that thought, more often than not, led to other thoughts he’d rather not allow to surface.
“Maybe not,” Alejandro huffed.
For now, there was nothing of the latter, and plenty of the former. After Sam had left, Dean spent the entire day by the beach again, and in the evening, he and Alejandro watched
On his route up north, he eventually reached Monterey, and of course, he could not pass through that town without paying the renowned Monterey Bay Aquarium a visit. As was expected, the place was full of kids. Dean thought back to his own childhood with a pang of sorrow because their dad had hardly ever taken them to any such places. The few occasions he could remember had been short, rushed experiences, and more in passing when the occasion had presented itself rather than something he’d planned to do with his kids. There’d been a tiny, privately-owned aquarium which had been part of a hunt, and another time, a petting zoo just on the outskirts of a town they were staying at. While Sammy had gotten to pet some baby goats and ponies, Dean had been told he, at age ten, was too old for that.
“Sorry,” Dean replied. “Saw you fighting with this and thought you might need some help.”
“You’re wrong, though,” she added a moment later as they both moved on to the shelf with pickles. At first, Dean thought she was about to go on about the mayo, but the look on her face - a soft, earnest smile - told him she was talking about something else.
“Hello?” he called, and then heard some shuffling from behind the kitchen door.
It had been quiet on the beach all late afternoon. On top of the season coming to an end, there was a bigger party at a beach bar further south, and so, after a couple of his friends had said they’d come over, Alejandro had put a ‘closed’ sign up by the road and decided to host a private party instead.
“Nah,” Dean said, shaking his head softly, “Keep it as compensation for letting me crash at yours. Plus, this was more fun than work.”
Another aspect that had him ponder whenever he let his thoughts go in the direction of this topic: how did you
). I hope you enjoy it. And once again, thank you guys so, so much for all your lovely comments.
When Dean went into greater detail, telling him about Jefferson Rooney and how he had been the one, possessed by Lucifer, to father Jack, Alejandro seemed even more astounded by the tale than the whole Nazi Necromancers story.
Sam shrugged. “Yeah. Last time we had the chance, only I got to ride a horse, and it wasn’t as bad as I expected--”
This morning, when he had woken up with the first rays of sun, it had only been a testimony of how exhausted he felt that he even had been able to sleep that long. Ever since he had opened his eyes, sticky and swollen from last night’s crying, Dean had, in a strange way, felt a little lighter. As if now, after having used so much energy to maintain the facade and keep his feelings and memories contained, he suddenly had an excess of energy. It certainly wasn’t the kind of energy that made him want to jump for joy - he was very, very far from that - but he could feel that lightness in him. It gave him the strength to slowly, eventually, and with more time, get used to the loss he felt. He could draw even more strength from memories of Cas, think of him and smile from time to time instead of clenching his jaw and pushing everything back, far back into a locked box in the farthest corner of his mind.
to do over what he thought he must do.
So, this is the final chapter (before the rather short epilogue). I do hope it meets your expectations, but I'm kinda thinking it will. ;-)
Alejandro turned once more with a laugh, gave Dean one thumb up, and then waded into the water, submerging just a few seconds later and swimming out in a moderately paced crawl.
“How did your dad react?” Dean asked instead, trying to divert the topic.
He rounded the bar, took the stool furthest to the left, and sat down, at the side of the bar, facing Dean but still at maybe an arm’s length distance.
That feeling of elation came out as a soft chuckle, and it made Cas stir from his sleep. Raising his head slowly, he looked up at Dean in the dim light, cast only by the alarm clock on the nightstand and the bit that came through the gap under the door. Dean stretched to turn on the bedside lamp, which made Cas blink, eyes still small with sleepiness as he looked at Dean. His hair was tousled, and the sight filled Dean with such deep and overwhelming adoration that it made the breath hitch in his throat.
“Mmh, you know, this feels really nice,” Alejandro said softly, and it took Dean a moment to realize that he didn’t simply mean the kiss but, as Alejandro’s fingertips gently ran along Dean’s cheek, his now slightly longer scruff. He hadn’t shaved or trimmed it in a couple of days.
He thrust into him a little harder, a little faster, feeling his own breath pick up speed. Even though it all had lasted just a few short minutes, Dean was reaching a point pretty quickly where he knew he’d find it difficult to slow himself down. He was sure that this was
Dean just nodded and waited for Alejandro to head out the door. He closed his eyes and took two, three deep breaths, willing himself to calm down, to feel the air stretch his lungs and fight off the constricting ache in his chest. When he opened his eyes again, he saw the tequila bottle in front of him, eyeing it for a long moment, before, at last, he turned away from the kitchen unit and left the bottle there, untouched, as he headed back out towards the beach again.
“You’d think with us having killed countless monsters I’d be able to handle one lousy mosquito,” he said, and Dean noticed then that he had a plastic bag in one hand, which he now set down on the small dining table to sit at it and take out the contents.
There was one photo, though, that hurt less to look at than the others. He had taken years ago when Cas had bought that ridiculous cat for Claire.
“What the hell, Sam? I only told you three days ago that I-- I may like
Hope you enjoy it, and stay tuned for the next one that's definitely going to be a bit more angsty ;-)
It took Dean roughly six hours to get to the ranch. It was located pretty much in the middle of nowhere, a bit up north from Santa Fe, where the landscape looked less rough and barren than further south. In fact, he could imagine how lush and green it must look in spring and summer, the vast stretch of land covered in high grass and wildflowers.
’ he wrote and then, to alleviate his guilt a little, show Alejandro that it absolutely wasn’t like he didn’t care, added,
Sam decided just not to ask.
“Not for another two hours. So you’re good to go. And the bathroom’s in the next building to the right.”
Alejandro shrugged and scratched the back of his head with one hand, brushing the thick, wavy strands back from his face afterward. “I’d like to be. I mean I do paint and draw, but it’s not exactly money-making. Sometimes I sell a little something on the side, but this bar is my main source of income.”
“I, uh… okay. I’m glad you told me.”
Again, in a totally realistic scenario where BOTH Dean and Sam weren't kinda super human when it comes to their alcohol consumption, this would not work out. But it's still SPN, so things aren't super realistic, and I chose to find a compromise here.
Cas coughed and winced a little, and, as Sam let him go, Dean immediately laid a hand on Cas’ shoulder. The worry he was feeling prevented any relief from fully surfacing.
Dean gave him a slight shrug. “Yeah, well, I never got around to teaching Jack how to cook, so you will have to keep thanking me.” There were many things Jack never got to do. He had never been allowed to have an actual childhood either, and Dean sometimes thought of that fact with a sense of regret. But this was not the right time for that either.
“Not who I was talking about,” Sam said. Of course, Dean knew that, though he also knew perfectly that Sam was just pulling his leg, trying to get him to embarrass himself. “Wow, Dean, you’ve already got a sunburn. Oh wait, you’re just blushing.”
Dean had to laugh at that. “Oh, don’t be so sure. The books have many fans too.”
Dean loved hearing that, pleased that his cooking had actually been memorable enough for Alejandro to demand seconds. For a very brief moment, a thought came to his mind, and he almost would have suggested that maybe Tampico still needed an American burger joint, but the idea had been too spontaneous, too far-fetched to say it out loud.
“Morning,” he said softly, bringing a hand up and cupping the side of Cas’ face, fingers raking through the dark brown hair.
“Nah, it’s nothing. Almost gone,” he answered, downplaying it just a little. As soon as he felt the warm hands on his back, he also thought he needed to keep talking. “I, uh, had a run in with a rabid raccoon. I’m in, err, pest control.”
now,” Dean said, remembering that it was one thing Charlie had talked about with Colin - one of the guys that had joined them over summer and who was almost as much of a tech nerd as her.
When he came back and checked his phone once more, there was a reply. Claire had sent a photo of herself, hugging the stuffed cat and smiling a little wistfully.
Sam just laughed at that.
’, Dean thought, wondering if Jack could hear him, or even had his ears on because he had also said he didn’t need people to pray to him to be part of them. ‘
’ Dean replied, feeling cheeky as well.
,’ Alejandro replied with a smiling emoji, and Dean felt a sudden ache in his chest. Something that definitely was a kind of longing, paired with regret. Despite only knowing him for not even four full weeks, Alejandro had understood Dean in ways he’d rarely felt with anyone.
“Good morning to you, too, sunshine,” Dean replied even after Sam was already half out of earshot. Furrowing his brow in confusion, he looked back at Cas. “What crawled up his ass and died there?”
The sounds of laughter, shouts, and general commotion echoed up the landing and into the crisp evening air.
It was in an abandoned farm outside the town. Armed with guns and machetes they marched into the barn to free the kids and get rid of the vamps. There were four of them, and they put up a good fight, attacking them with clubs and knives. The first one went down pretty quickly by Sam’s blade, the next followed only shortly after, its head severed clean off its shoulders by Dean.
Sam had gone to buy some groceries at one of the stores across the main road, and Dean dried himself off after his last dip in the ocean. He put on his t-shirt and decided to go get a beer. Now seemed like a good time to address the elephant in the room.
I've had a really stressful day at work today and my brain is kinda mush, so I'll leave it at that for now. Definitely gonna say more when I post the epilogue.
“And just so you know,” Sam continued when Dean still hadn’t said anything, “Bobby would have been absolutely okay with it. And he was more of a father to us than dad ever was.”
,’ Dean replied as he googled images of Dia de Muertos and sent one to Alejandro with a group of people in those typical costumes and elaborate skull-like makeup.
“Yeah?”
“Okay, I have to say something,” Sam started again after a while, when Dean had already thought - hoped - they’d continue the last few miles to the store in silence, just with the radio playing softly. And this time, even though Dean could read his brother pretty well most of the time, he had no clue what he was going to hear. The thumping of his heart in his chest told him it may not be something he’d like.
Despite how he had looked up to his dad as a child, and young man - despite all the things they
“Yeah. Well.” Dean didn’t know what else to reply.
Dean only acknowledged that with another low grunt and continued to put the sunscreen on him, getting up to do the back of the legs, then his chest, lower back and shoulders. The middle of his back, however, wasn’t that easy to reach, least of all with the mild pain that was still present when he went beyond a certain point and just felt it blocking the full range of movement.
“Time to?” Dean asked. “Got any plans for the morning again?”
That's why I made him human. So they could have this together and be, truly and completely, free of any supernatural elements and forces.
But eventually, long past three in the morning, Alejandro had told Dean that he needed some sleep. He had left the question open whether Dean wanted to stay. It had been more of a gut feeling than a conscious decision for Dean not to. Maybe he was thinking he wouldn’t be able to resist the other man and wanted to get some sleep himself, too. Maybe he simply didn’t want Sam to wake up in a few hours and find the second bed empty. Or maybe it was something else altogether. Something similar to the feeling he now felt spreading slowly, subtly in his chest.
“She’s fine. Exhausted, but fine. She did really well. And…” A faint, somewhat bashful chuckle. “Now don’t be mad. We did think about naming him after you, Dean,” Sam said, and Dean felt a tiny pang of disappointment. “But we decided we’d name him Jack. We owe him so much, so--”
interest in people in
Also, I have to make a note here to thank the Destiel fandom in general, because over the past few months since the show ended, clever people have come up with analysis and interpretation of so many interesting details and facts - such as the one I'm referencing in this chapter. You'll see when you get there. Anyway... without those people I'd have had a lot less material to write about. So thanks for all the inspiration!
Off the main house, there was an annex where Cesar and Jesse had furnished four guest rooms, each with a small ensuite and a compact communal kitchen towards the side entrance. Dean was the only guest here at the moment, with it being off-season now.
“I swear if this is gonna become some stupid inside joke between us, I’m never taking you shopping again,” Dean said as they both got back into the car.
It took no longer than half a minute for him to get a reply, and Dean had to chuckle at the fact that Claire proved that kids, these days, were, in fact, glued to their phones most of their time.
Sam let out a barely suppressed sigh and looked back at his phone. “Playa Serena.”
He focused on how Alejandro felt and tasted on his tongue, heavy and full, slightly salty and slick around the head when he let his tongue swirl around it. It definitely did help to know what this was like on the receiving end, and Dean was confident that he was probably doing a whole lot better than the very first time he’d gone down on a girl.
Maybe it all hadn’t been his dad’s fault after all, but his own for being such a coward.
Instead of getting anywhere near his dick with his mouth, Alejandro opened the condom packet and rolled it on Dean, and he had to inhale sharply, press his eyes shut, and focus on not getting ahead of himself. It really had been so damn long.
call me Dean.”
to do everything for Sam. With that, though, instantly came guilt that he even allowed that other thought to pass, and if Dean gave himself the time to examine where this guilt came from, he was sure to open up a whole other can of worms with it. All his life, he’d always been responsible for Sam, and if Sam actually left now, took his life in his own hands, who did Dean then have to be responsible for but himself?
The hills were rolling softly around them, covered in woods and bush land, still mostly green despite the late season. When Yolanda led them into the leaf tree forest, the air became a little cooler, more humid, and pleasant, and Dean just leaned back a little and breathed in the smells around him.
As Dean took a few bites of his burrito - which tasted delicious, cheesy and savory with just the right amount of freshness to it, too - he noticed that Sam kept looking at him, his curiosity battling with the ‘I don’t even want to know’ expression very obviously on his features.
I'm curious if it's still somewhat ambiguous what the "catch" here is or perfectly clear. Let me know!
“Come on, let’s get out of the water before we start growing webs,” Alejandro suggested, swimming closer to shore on his back and watching Dean follow him.
“Actually, they’re called charros,” Dean corrected Sam, a bit smug about beating Sam in random and specific knowledge, “gauchos are South American.”
Instantly, there was a warm and excited feeling in his chest that made Dean’s heart beat faster. It was almost a sense of shock - a moment in which his still drowsy mind needed a moment to catch on. Cas was here, alive, sleeping in Dean’s bed. Brushing a kiss to the crown of Cas’ head, Dean brought his hand around his middle and let it rest gently on his back, feeling the warmth of his body through the fabric of his t-shirt. He could not remember when he’d last felt like this - if ever - so happy, so filled with joy and love that it almost felt like his mind and body weren’t able to contain it.
allow himself to think about it, not then, not now. It was like all his control, all his ability to function, to live and at least try to enjoy life was held together by a thin thread, and he was afraid that it would break if he let himself truly think about or feel what he knew was lurking in his mind, just beneath the surface.
“Yeah. There is,” Dean said, voice low, almost raspy, and he could practically hear the sound of his own quickened heartbeat, felt the tingle in his spine pool in the pit of his stomach and shoot further down.
1. I read an eye-opening essay on gay sex on LJ a while ago. Sadly, the entry is gone now, but a guy on tumblr summarised it and added a few other details. https://leandra-winchester.tumblr.com/post/642390251870044160/gay-sex-is-all-wrong-in-fanfic
- through the trees and bushes, already seeing three small buildings. Their walls were painted a dirty yellow and the one nestled between two large palm trees and closest to the shore had a tropical looking, leafy roof on top of it. As they approached, they could see a big, glassless window on the side, blue shutters left and right, and the main entrance that was just a door-less, wide opening in the wall leading into the room that was no larger than a regular living room. There was a small bar with four stools and three additional tables in the area around. Despite being clearly open, there was nobody to be seen in the bar.
“No Led Zeppelin?” Cas asked with an understanding smile, and it took Dean by surprise a little that he obviously had listened to those songs attentively enough to be able to tell their level of difficulty.
He felt heavy and light, had to breathe deeply against a knot in his chest, or chuckle and shake his head at other memories, and when he felt like it was getting a little too much, he also allowed himself to let go of those thoughts for the moment. Allowed himself to just be, listen to music, and watch the lane markings flash by in the headlights as he drove.
The truth was, unlike Sam who, most of the time, allowed his emotions to surface, to live through them and deal with them, Dean didn’t have the strength for it. Maybe he had had it, once upon a time, but after so many losses, all the grief in his life, it was harder and harder to go through the next one. And this one… this one was final. Because Jack said he wouldn’t intervene any longer.
That Cas had given up his eternal life so willingly alleviated Dean’s guilt somewhat. His attachment to Earth was - at least, that much was heavily implied in the gaze, full of affection, that Cas shot him at the mention - Dean, and that knowledge moved him, even made him, in a strange, conflicting sense, proud.
’ and ‘
He spent the night at a small, quaint little bed and breakfast halfway up to San Francisco with the intention to actually do some touristy sightseeing the next day, but during the night, a storm had come in from the sea. Neither driving across the Golden Gate Bridge nor any of the other activities he could have done now seemed appealing, and so Dean took a turn further inland and away from the bad weather. Maybe he could come back here another time. Maybe Claire and Kaia would make it one of their stops when traveling around, as they’d planned, and he’d go and meet up with them.
“Mexico, huh? Nice,” Cesar replied, “and now what? You two are road tripping through the Southwest?”
“Man, Mexicans really know how to do breakfast,” Dean said, just swallowing a second mouthful, and Sam gave him a small, content smile.
Anyhow, I finally managed to edit the chapter this morning, and my beta promptly beta-read, so here it is. I hope you enjoy it and some of the little details I put into it (from funny place names over beverages I enjoy but haven't found in shops for ages to a really great book). And there's another original character you're gonna meet, well, two, but one a little more significant than the other.
They both slid down the bed, facing each other, and it took only a moment for Dean to lean above Cas and bring their lips together. The kiss was slow at first, soft and unhurried, but when a sign left Cas’ lips, Dean felt small shivers running down his back and pool in the pit of his stomach.
And have a great weekend!
“I’m glad you didn’t suggest Brokeback Mountain,” Dean said, trying for humor and finding it somewhat easier to succeed.
? Because it’s the most ridiculous shark movie ever made. I mean, if you’re even into shark movies.”
It was his phone then that disturbed them, vibrating noisily on his nightstand. As excited as Dean was to see if it was Sam who was calling, he couldn’t help the slightly frustrated sigh leave him. “Does he have to call
“It’s interesting because… my sister and her husband are in pest control, too,” Alejandro replied, and though Dean couldn’t see it he could hear the smile in his voice as he drew his hands from Dean’s back and patted his right shoulder lightly.
When Dean had gotten back into the Impala, he hadn’t been able to stop crying for ages.
This chapter is a bit shorter than some of the following ones will be, but I do hope you find it interesting. As always, please let me know, because reading what you thought of it is my greatest reward. :-)
“Gabi always just told me about ghosts, vampires, and werewolves, or the odd other creature here and there, which was all pretty scary and fascinating already. Oh, and they hunted a chupacabra once, and shapeshifters. She knew about demons and the Apocalypse, but she always just hinted at those things when she told me about them. But the stuff you’ve seen…”
It was impossible not to think of Cas this time, not to let the image of his face stir in his mind, his bright blue eyes and the occasionally dreamy, often perpetually confused and sometimes deep - too deep to describe with words - gaze in them. Dean had to swallow, and he reached over to the nightstand for the water glass, taking a few large swigs.
Dean breathed in, and when he turned over his shoulder to look at his brother, the small smile on his lips came easier than he would have thought.
“Dean, you’re my brother, and I love you, and nothing’s ever gonna change that. I hope you know that.” Sam’s tone had started gentle but was gaining more vehemence, the last bit coming out almost as an accusation. In the very least, he was exasperated, and Dean instinctively raised an eyebrow at his brother as he briefly looked over to him.
“Oh, yeah, absolutely,” Dean replied. The hilarity was replaced by a somewhat softer, warmer feeling in his chest, and it was a genuine smile he gave his brother as he lightly clapped him on the back, squeezing his shoulder briefly. “Thanks, man.”
Cas sighed softly as their lips parted, but there was still a smile on his features. He pushed himself up slowly, frowning a little and tilting his head as if he was trying to make sense of something. “I had forgotten how annoying some aspects of being human are. I have to use the bathroom.
“I’m not that freckled,” he said, mildly irritated, as he started applying the lotion to his arms. “You practically can’t see them when you’re not looking direct--” He stopped as he saw Sam raising his eyebrows and tilting his head slightly in a suggestive manner.
Though the opportunities had been rare, Dean had also always enjoyed fishing. Maybe he should do that more often again. Grab Miracle and drive down to Lake Waconda or to the Lovewell Reservoir and spend a day there. Perhaps he could take Claire and Kaia sometime, too, if they were up for it. Like that one time he’d taken Jack. He’d simply have to make time for it, prioritize things he actually
“Did you… hold out on purpose, or do we just have impeccable timing?”
After that night, Dean stayed another day at the ranch. He was grateful for Cesar and Jesse having invited him into their home, for all the things he’d experienced on their ranch, and the friendship they had offered. They promised each other to stay in touch, and Dean could see himself coming back here whenever he wanted to go horse riding or just needed some peace and quiet.
The next song Maria played after a short round of applause by everyone was another Spanish tune, a bit slower than the first and a hint more melancholy. It didn’t help with the strange mixed feelings in Dean’s chest that he found more and more difficult to push away. He tried to focus on the sounds of the waves, then the faces of the people who looked at Maria and listened in amazed reverie. He watched her fingers move over the strings, nimble and skilled, and he remembered briefly what it had felt like to hold a guitar in hands and produce notes himself, so many years ago. Maybe he should pick it up again sometime. These days, you could learn everything from online tutorials anyway, so nothing was stopping him.
“So, did you use protection?” Oh, that little shit.
And if that didn’t add to Dean’s feelings of guilt, of regret, then he didn’t know what would.
Alejandro had barely continued to chew as he listened to Dean talk, squinting slightly at him before his brows went up again, and he shook his head briefly, a disbelieving smile on his face. “When you say ‘was’...?”
“How old are you anyway? I never asked,” Dean wanted to know, still wondering. He was sure Alejandro was a few years younger, just not how many.
Thank you for all the comments to last chapter. I'm really glad you all are enjoying this part of Dean's journey as well and that you're so patiently waiting for Cas' return. ;-) Hope you like this one too.
“Yeah?” Alejandro asked, and Dean nodded as he leaned in for a kiss.
to reply, digging deep in his repertoire of jokes and jabs and downplaying comments he could use. What came out instead was, “You deserve this, Sammy,” and he meant it, “You and Eileen being together. Starting a life. It’s all I ever wanted for you.”
“I’m not sure my powers would be enough for such an effort,” he admitted truthfully.
The second text message was from Alejandro and had been sent about an hour ago.
Maybe it was the way this getup affected Dean’s attitude, made him walk with a different kind of stride, act and speak with an aura that exuded a both raw and sensual eroticism that Cas could not escape. It seemed like Dean was playing a role - one that he had created to embody bits and pieces of all his favourite Western heroes - and yet, that role did not seem artificial or dishonest on him, more like it was a side of him that was brought forth to the surface as soon as he’d put on that hat and slipped into those boots.
“Face-timing with his girlfriend. Something about a place she found for them,” Dean said. He sat up completely and reached for the water bottle that he’d parked under the chair in the shade.
“Hello Castiel,” the boy said, with his same slightly crooked smile radiating innocence and kindness as it always had.
You entertained me with your squeeing, your shouting, and you gave me so many great ideas though your theories and the hopes you expressed. I would have done quite a few things differently if it hadn't been for the one or other (definitely more) comment to point me towards something I hadn't considered, or come up with an idea of including a specific character. This fic became better than it would have been, had I written it without all of that input. So thank you all for that!!! <3
In the shower - their first one that night - neither Dean nor Alejandro had been willing to keep their hands off each other. Wasting more water than was probably sensible, they had been lucky that it only started getting cold when Alejandro came over Dean’s hand. They had laughed about it as they dried themselves off and got dressed, only in their underwear, before they sat down at Alejandro’s small, round dining table to drink some tequila and chat.
For this one, I'd really like your thoughts on the last few paragraphs ;-)
Dean could have played it down, could have said he just knew some general pop culture references to these kid’s movies, and in many cases, that was true since he hadn’t actually seen most of them in years. He didn’t do that, however. Instead, he just shrugged and gave Alejandro another grin before they finally waded out of the water and back to their towels.
about other people?”
“Just shut up,” Sam only ground out between gritted teeth and headed out towards the car.
his type, though.
“A card game?” Dean asked, intrigued but also a little surprised that Alejandro had suggested it. So far, they had not played any kinds of games yet.
Eileen shrugged lightly as she reached for a bottle of mayonnaise.
No. No, he had to stop. He could not think about that, could not give in, because if he did, Dean didn’t know how he’d be able to pick himself back up from that.
the power that Jack exuded. In every fiber of his being, Cas was aware of it, felt engulfed and cradled by it. And then he knew what it meant. Not when or how it had happened, but he
Cas looked at him briefly before he let his gaze trail off, a hint of concern and confusion visible on his features. "Your brother said he might be a bottom. I interpreted it as an attempt to tone down his profanity and-- Sam, are you alright?"
And Dean, fortunately, seemed to be perfectly fine with that. As he brought his lips back to Cas’, and Cas let his head rest comfortably on the pillow, closing his eyes, he thought that this was just perfect. More than he could ever have dreamed of. Anything that came after this? It could only get better.
“No,” Dean interrupted him, letting out a chuckle, “You’re not wearing me out. Just because I’m… what? - seven years older than you, doesn’t mean I can’t keep up.”
It made him grin against Alejandro’s shoulder, surprised at himself. In an odd, equally surprising sense, almost proud.
Of course, angel!Cas is awesome; his powers are badass and amazing, and there's a certain kind of quality to having an angel fall in love and be in love with a human. But that remains true even with him now being human. Cas
Dean chuckled at her somewhat cheeky reply and was already thinking of what to say next, when another message came through.
“Yeah, I keep forgetting...,” Alejandro chuckled and shook his head, but then he raised his beer and clanked it against Dean’s bottle. “Salud. And thank you for dinner.”
As Dean listened to Alejandro, it became clear to him that, yes, he should not burden the guy with his own stupid issues, and, thinking back to the evening they’d talked about their dads, Dean was worried that he’d already done too much of it. Especially when he added what he had revealed to Alejandro last night to the equation.
“Sorry, I…
“Ah, so you
“I, uh--” he made a waving motion with his hand as he turned back towards the counter, fighting the impulse to pour himself another large glass of liquor. “I lost someone, okay? Back in… when the whole business with Chuck went down.” It already took him all his strength not to give in to the impulse to cry again, just saying those words. Had Alejandro touched him, hugged him, Dean would not have been able to stop.
Some further notes at the end.
A small smile formed on Dean’s lips, and he nodded slowly, feeling both touched and a little bit awkward. “Alright. Thanks. That’s… uh… good to know.”
. Just Because, and it was fun and light to do this together, no plans and responsibilities - just living in the moment for once.
“Well, no arguing there,” Alejandro replied and sat back down on the bed, placing the bag of chips between them, the remote control in one hand. “Okay, ready for one of the worst movies ever made? Though… it might even be mildly educational from a hunter’s perspective.”
“No, man, it’s not. It’ll be good to catch up. When will you get here?”
He wished he’d just stayed in the cage with Lucifer all those years ago. Those had been easier times. He was definitely going to burn that thing though at the first chance he got. And once he found a pair of rubber gloves to touch it.
It was after the stable rounds, which Dean had used to settle into his room and send both Claire and Sam a photo of a particularly nice spot on his way here, that he and the two ranch owners sat together at their kitchen table over a drink and talked some more.
Dean sank back into the mattress, breathing hard as Alejandro slid off him. He lay down next to Dean to catch his breath before both of them turned their heads and looked at each other.
“Well, thanks for making me feel better,” Dean replied dryly, but grateful for this change of tone. “When’s your plane leave anyway?”
“Yeah. Definitely,” Sam said, and Dean could hear the mild confusion in his tone that told him he didn’t know where Dean was going with this.
“Oh yeah, traditional Mexican food with lots of beans, onions, and cheese? What could go wrong?” Sam chuckled and spread his towel on his chair to settle down comfortably.
leaving. Tomorrow morning. There’s a flight going from Tampico to Houston, and then a connecting one to Omaha. I’ll be there in six hours, and you don’t have to drive for over twenty just to get me there and cut your holiday short.”
For some reason, it felt like someone had punched Dean in the gut, though, and for the first time since he had come to terms with his feelings, with his
“About that night when you…” Dean made a waving motion with his hand. “When you said goodbye. W-what you said.”
people tell? If someone wasn’t stereotypically effeminate, which Alejandro definitely wasn’t, how did people ever-- Could people tell about
“As far back in the closet as Narnia?” Dean concluded and saw both men laugh softly at that.
“What? Saddle-sore already?” Dean teased with a grin, ignoring that he, too, felt the same slightly unpleasant sensation. “They ain’t gonna make a cowboy out of you after all.”
Now it was Cas who was confused. He had thought that much had always been obvious, that there was nothing to misunderstand from his words that night; that Dean must clearly know what they had meant. But here he was, needing a final confirmation, and Cas felt his palms becoming slightly sweaty.
“Oh, no. No, it wasn’t anything like that. She was always more close to my brother. Not that there was ever anything there either,” he quickly added, just so refraining from mentioning that,
And so, instead of actually doing something like relaxing at a spa, or being seen in public watching a chick-flick, or, god forbid, even just sticking his nose inside a gay bar, Dean had gone to roadhouses and strip clubs and surrounded himself with women who wanted to get in his pants and men who envied him for it.
Dean Winchester had been through a lot, through death and grief and trauma, but it felt almost like a past life now.
mental images in his head now, “I have no idea who came up with those words and why. They’re just words people use.”
much of a difference, at least not once you’ve reached your thirties. “I’m forty-one.”
Beyond that, some of your comments simply made my day and moved me in ways I hadn't actually expected to achieve with this fic. Many of you said you could relate to Dean's struggles, such as the internalised homophobia he was breaking through; or his issues with John and how they affected him even today. And many of you said that reading about Dean's struggles and his journey of self-discovery and acceptance has helped you realise things about yourself, too. That is just such a massive, massive compliment to a writer, that I cannot put into words how much it means to me to hear these things.
Just as he opened his lips to add something Dean would now never know, they both heard one of the two women calling in a thick, slavic accent: “Yoo-hoo! Alejandro, can you do my back, too, please?”
Sudden images appeared in his mind, behind his closed eyes, intrusive and uncontrolled, and for a moment, he simply let them happen. Allowed himself to imagine, to dream. Not Alejandro’s but Cas’ full lips around him, the shape of his nose and the characteristic lines on his face, deep blue eyes that looked up at him with a lustful expression, brow perpetually furrowed, but in concentration instead of confusion this time. For a moment, these thoughts did not hurt, did not make him feel grief or shame, any reflection drowned out by the pleasure that was building in his body as the rhythm increased.
to go there. He’d have to wait it out, let it slowly subside like everything else, until, someday, it would be alright to look at it with no more than a lingering sense of regret and melancholy - a pain that was manageable instead of overwhelming.
“And you aren’t?” Dean asked, evading the topic and seeing his brother’s features relax into an annoyed glare that preceded a low groan.
Another chapter, and I have a few things to say about this one, but I'll put the notes at the end because spoilers. I hope you enjoy it!
As Dean dried himself off, Alejandro reached out to ruffle his damp hair. “Speaking of your hair, it’s getting really blond from all the sun.”
Alejandro snorted softly. “That’s probably true. It wasn’t bad what she said or anything. So don’t worry. Just about some people who know you by two or three degrees of separation, and some of the stuff you already told me about, like averting the Apocalypse.” He shook his head a little, as if a part of him still couldn’t even believe it, and Dean could hardly blame him.
“Sorry, did I wake you?” Alejandro asked, a small smirk forming on his lips that was positively mischievous, “You know, if I wear you out or anything, you just have to--”
This was the pivotal moment then. Dean had not had much in-depth contact with gay men, but even he knew that some of them - or most? - had a preference when it came to which part to take. And so, despite knowing his own answer, he asked, “What do you usually prefer?”
The shock of it still rattled Dean so deeply that he couldn’t even bring himself to think about it. In all those years he’d known him, he had often wondered, even sometimes wished, especially when their differences became too vast, Cas could be more human. But now? Dean felt a sadness for his best friend that shook him to the core, and on top of it, he felt guilty because it was all his fault.
by an artist named Mika, Dean would not have known it.
those expectations, some of your comments have actually helped me with parts I was struggling with, or provided ideas for things I wouldn't have thought of. So thank you for that!!
Dean huffed out a chuckle. “Did you salt and burn the body? Wouldn’t want it to haunt you the next night.”
Dean didn’t know how to respond. The most straight-forward thing would have been to just acknowledge this fact, but then he’d also have to elaborate, and there were things he simply didn’t want to talk about.
Throughout all of his life, Dean had often believed in making choices for himself, but in the end, everything - at least the significant milestones - had been predetermined by Chuck. All that was gone now, and he realized with a pang of anxiety in his chest, that everything that lay ahead for him - all the good and bad that would come to pass in his future - was down to him and him alone. If he kept going elsewhere, he might damage whatever he had left in Kansas. If he went back, he might miss an amazing opportunity that would have presented itself elsewhere. If he stayed put, both could become true.
“So, when did you get back last night,” Sam asked casually.
I hope you find the chapter as interesting as I found writing it, because there are some things here Dean has never done before... and also some slightly 'steamy' stuff. ;-) Well, you'll see. Don't want to spoil before you read it.
“I have no idea. First-time labor can take rather long. At least that’s what I--”
“Uh, as sexy as the thought of you as some mythical merman is,” he said, coming to a halt in the now waist-deep water, hands reaching to place them on either side of Dean’s hips, “I’m not sure I’d like the anatomical limitations.”
Dean and Sam had stopped at a mall the night before and bought some more beach appropriate clothing - something they simply didn’t own -  and yes, Dean had insisted on summer-y Hawaiian shirts, though they didn’t get a matching pair and Sam had refused to put his on as they had left this morning. Instead, he was wearing a lighter pair of jeans and a simple t-shirt. Dean, on the other hand, was really grateful for having bought a grey pair of loose-fitting shorts and some canvas slippers, because, damn, it was really still quite hot down here even in late September.
It wasn’t long after that when he and Sam went on their first hunt after defeating Chuck. Everything pointed at vampires who broke into houses, killed or maimed the parents, and abducted the kids to either to keep them as a steady supply of blood or wait a few years and then turn them young to strengthen their nest. It was a pretty straight-forward case, a few witnesses and cops to interview, one vampire caught and interrogated, and then they were on their way to the lair.
“Okay,” he said, licking his lips again and briefly running a hand over his forehead. “Okay, yeah, I’m uncomfortable.” Dean finally looked Cas in the eyes again, and Cas almost wanted to look away because that was the last thing he had wanted Dean to feel.
3. I promise and I swear that Destiel is still endgame, though I and my beta reader have fallen in love with Alejandro a bit. I don't know if I mentioned this, but I imagine Alejandro to look like Santiago Cabrera (as he looked in Merlin, later seasons with the shorter hair).
It was truly amazing that Sam had found a loving, astoundingly witty partner and that Dean, too, had finally found a kind of love he hadn’t even dared hope for. If someone had told him, a couple of years ago, that this was what his life would look like, he’d not have believed them.
silly. And time-consuming because, for all he knew, the next one was probably hundreds of miles away.
Cas looked at him, exhaled softly, and a small smile formed on his lips. “No. I’m staying.”
“I had to make a call, and so I did,” Sam replied, “Because this,” he made a waving motion in the direction of the sea, “it’s good for you. I haven’t seen you so relaxed and in such a good mood in years. You need this, Dean, and you deserve it. So take a few more days, or a week or two, and just freaking enjoy your life for once. Come back when you want to, and not because you feel like you have to, or like you owe
“Mmh, admit it,” Dean said around a grin as he looked down at Cas, his voice low and with that particular brazen timbre to it, “You like me like that.”
“Yeah. My dad was a civil engineer and had a long-term engagement in Austin. So we moved there when I was sixteen. I finished high school in English and started college. Art school, to be exact.”
“Uh, Sam already went back home again. It’s a long story, but I… yeah. I’m road-tripping,” Dean replied, not quite knowing how to continue without outright inviting himself. And wondering whether he even wanted that.
“Yeah, better not,” Dean agreed and looked over to the beach where the four others made no move to come over and help them with the refreshments. He chuckled and rolled his eyes as he and Alejandro lifted the heavy tub on either side and carried it out.
Cas seemed a little reluctant, keeping the book to himself, and so Dean did the only thing he could do and quickly ripped the thing from Cas’ hands to skim the blurb on the cover. “A romantic western? Really?” he laughed, incredulous.
He allowed himself to sit there for a while, letting the tears come again until they slowly subsided, and he knew he had to pick himself up. Drying his eyes, Dean got up and went over to the kitchen. In the fridge, there were only two bottles of spring water. Dean would have liked something with flavor, not even necessarily beer, but there was nothing else. On the countertop, next to the electric kettle, there was a can with instant coffee and a selection of various teas. Dean had never been one to drink tea, but if he had any more coffee tonight, he might not sleep for the remainder of the night. He found something he’d never even heard of and decided to give it a go, and indeed, with a bit of sugar, the honeybush tea tasted fine.
“Hm, you sure you haven’t done this with a guy before?” Alejandro asked softly then, rolling onto his side and letting the fingertips of one hand roam along the side of Dean’s chest. It tickled slightly, and he flinched with a stuttered chuckle.
The two women ordered beers and two tequilas, continuing to chat to each other and Alejandro, and the bubbly one still exchanged a few looks with Dean, very obviously and despite the language barrier trying to determine whether she’d have any luck. When Alejandro sat down a glass of tequila in front of Dean, too, the young woman winked at him, and damn, he was flattered. He would have been utterly delighted, and an earlier version of him would have simply blissfully forgotten that there was a guy who was very likely expressing interest in him which he was definitely returning. But that was then, and - fair to Alejandro or not - it wasn’t what Dean wanted at this moment.
Dean rolled his eyes and barely kept in the frustrated sigh that made its way out of him. They had spent the entire previous day driving down from Lebanon to Brownsville, and Dean had somehow expected they’d get to a nice beach around midday so he could finally feel the sand beneath his feet and, for the first time in his entire life, take a dip in the ocean. Now, it was already past five, and they still had to find a place to stay, get changed and… yeah, it was probably not happening today.
