“Oh, so there are placement tests now? Where was the placement test three years ago when I showed up?” a girl Peter vaguely recognized as Jeanne Foucault, or the girl Kate most often referred to as “that bitch Jeanne Foucault”, demanded.
“Reasons,” was all 3490 Tony said before she flitted out of the kitchen abruptly. 3409 Steve looked at the avengers. The avengers looked back at 3490 Steve.
“Well? How could he? His wife’s dead. Dead, dead, dead. And so’s their baby. And their hopes and dreams and shit,” Tony said. He drained the bourbon. Steve gently took it out of his hands and put it on the bedside table.
—guaranteed to be Avengers, one day, because our parents are. The other kids? It’s not a guarantee. They’ll probably be on some B-list team someday, or maybe join the 50-State Initiative, but being on the Avengers based out of New York? It’s possible but unlikely. And they
“Right. Ok then,” Steve said. “I understand.” Tony had to look away from Steve. He was smiling, but Tony had seen Steve Rogers bear that particular smile before. It wasn’t a happy smile. “Feel better, then.”
“I can do that,” Peter volunteered instead, getting up. He was up and out the door before Steve could say anything else. Alone, he turned to James. James was studying the ceiling.
Only Option C did not involve James getting shot repeatedly by a sniper overhead, but unfortunately James also did not place much faith in Option C. SHIELD was impressive, but SHIELD was in disarray—not only was their fearless leader dead and gone, but if the world outside was anything like what Dad had reported, well, James knew they’d be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. James weighed his options, growing more and more tense. He didn’t like any of them, but if he waited too long the choice would be made for him. Damn, he never should have let that guy get the high ground. Hindsight.
a bit worried. It had started around five o’clock. Antonella had noticed Peter wasn’t back yet and said as much.
“If it perforated my stomach,” James said, still pushing at Peter’s hands with no force behind it, “then I’m dead soon anyway. Stomach acid will do that.
Stark mansion had beautiful gardens. The best part about the gardens, though, was that they were at the moment empty. There were no people whatsoever. There was no Tony chatting animatedly with Clint, no Thor and Jane speaking softly to one another on the couch, no Bruce or Pepper or Natasha reading, no Peter watching television whilst hanging upside down from the ceiling just because he could now, no Kate rushing about getting ready for ballet or archery or any one of the number of things that girl did in her free time. It was just Steve and nature and nothing else. Well, not
“Hm,” Torrun said. She took a bite of turkey, not answering him for a minute. “This could be your last Thanksgiving.” James grinned and raised his eyebrows.
going to stop at Midtown Science to drop off the form for Peter, though they had all agreed that the only ones who would be allowed to physically drop the form off in the school would be Tony and Jane, as neither of them were particularly recognizable.
“You can’t know that, Peter,” MCU Steve spoke gently. “With Tony’s armor? She might have made it. You’ve just got to have a little faith.”
his wife’s intentions slowly dawned, and he couldn’t be happier. His wife was, after all, a genius. She had, Steve guessed, kicked everyone out and told them without mincing words exactly why she wanted them gone. Still, Steve was so content with his day that he didn’t find himself in the least embarrassed by it. While he preferred a bit of discretion there wasn’t, after all, anything to be ashamed of. So even when Other Tony walked in to the kitchen, where Steve was making coffee and reading through classified documents on his tablet, simply to rib him, he could manage only a raised eyebrow, but no blush.
“Who do you think? Pepper,” Steve said. “She was telling me a while back about needing to organize Christmas presents—I thought she was a bit crazy, it was September after all—and she was going through a list and mentioned that you’d probably want to get Harley’s present together yourself. I asked who he was. She didn’t keep him from me.”
. I don’t know why, but what I do know is that 3490 decided, instead of just handing me over, to send us to this safe house so they wouldn’t find me. Why? Why would they do that if they wished any of us harm?”
“Good,” Commander Rogers replied. His dad looked exhausted, but his expression was still one of grim determination. “I meant what I said. I need you in the field. You start tomorrow—Avengers Team B.”
“Two,” Bruce replied carefully. “Brian and Lyra.” His double nodded, keeping his eyes trained on the computer screen.
“You would go to sleep at ten, too, if you had to get up at five every morning,” James pointed out. “Why do you feel the need to annoy me right now, Katie?”
“Actually, I do know that,” Peter replied. He felt hollow. “Whatever type of explosive went off on the 91
“Couldn’t sleep?” a soft voice asked. Tony was about to tell him why. Tony was about to spill all the beans, hearing that soft, sweet voice that she so loved. But when she looked up, it was Steve but it wasn’t. It was Other Steve, his young face looking at her in concern. It still shocked her, how young he was. At twenty-seven, he wasn’t much older than her Steve’s oldest son, James. He still had a bit of awkwardness left in him, awkwardness that Tony could vividly remember smashing out of Steve with a healthy dose of MIT parties in Cambridge and clubbing in NYC. She had enjoyed rubbing that layer away, to see the man beneath, but now she appreciated the awkwardness of youth that this Steve still carried. She smiled wryly at him.
“No,” Tony said, and Steve was grateful that the answer was a hundred percent honest—he had a niggling feeling that Commander Rogers would be able to suss out a lie in an instant. Commander Rogers still looked suspicious, but he didn’t disagree. Nor did he ask if
“Let’s just—move past this topic then, shall we?” he said. Dr. Pym then launched into a lecture about Latveria, Dr. Doom, and his various known weapons and tactics. Peter wasn’t really listening—he found, after a moment, that he already knew most of what Pym was talking about anyway.
to protect were more than capable of taking care of themselves. It was time for James to go back to his life. He had learned long ago that it was easiest if his real life was situated away from his father, from his brother and sister. He didn’t know why he’d forgotten that recently.

Kate had only partially been paying attention to Thor’s rather long winded tale, too stuck in her own worries and concerns over it, when Francis leaned over and muttered in her ear,
, I dare you,” Stark said, lazily putting his fists up.  “Come on, big guy, show me what you’ve got.”
just prevented potential civilian casualties and property damage and the like. So after the battle, Steve headed over to where the Other group had gathered.
, Tony thought. But it was more than that which had startled Tony. It was his whole face—the shape of his nose, the set of his eyes, the width of his brow. He looked remarkably like
“No, just—thinking,” Torrun said. She smiled at him. “It’s good to see you again.” James smiled back.
. So he did his best to stay away from her. But that didn’t change the fact that she was in his head, that soft black curls clouded his vision and he couldn’t stop drawing brown eyes. Steve had never felt so conflicted. She was
“I’m not going to torture the man, Banner,” Tony said. “I told you. Not that power mad just yet. Besides I have another, less painful way of getting exactly what I want.” Bruce stilled, then eyed Tony carefully.
, Pepper completely sympathized with the tone of her double’s voice. Double Pepper was well dressed, as Pepper expected her to be. Pepper was jealous of the heels she wore (Louboutin, no doubt), and impressed by the perfection of her chignon. There was only one real, marked difference Pepper could see between herself and her double—and that had to do with the diamond ring on her finger.
cool detachment. It was worry or concern. Or maybe that was just Kate’s wishful thinking—it was gone in a moment anyway, replaced by a hard expression. Kate crossed her arms.
you, Kate Rogers? What are you even worth, all on your own?” Kate dropped the duffel. Jeanne wanted a rematch? She would get it.
“Well, that’s not my problem now is it?” James replied. Kate pouted. James laughed and tousled her hair, which earned him a livid glare and a slap on his wrist. Nobody messed with her hair. “Say, when are Dad and Tony getting back from Japan, d’you know?”
“Just fine. Now—you mentioned you were thinking about some upgrades for the armor—mind if I take a look? I might have some suggestions,” he said.
The last two months had been horrible. Harrowing. Exhausting. But she’d been kept busy, in one way or another, the whole time. She was too tired to think. Too tired to really feel. The whole ordeal felt surreal, and while she desperately wanted to be done with it, she also didn’t want to go back to her usual life. If she went back to her usual life, if things slowly got back to some semblance of normal, she was going to have to face it all over again, and face it fully this time: her mother was dead, her father was a mess, and her life and her own person had been irrevocably altered by it all.
“You just don’t have all the information because you don’t need to,” the bald guy said. James was working on turning his shield on, but nothing was happening.
“So all this is about getting even?” Dad asked rhetorically. “If so, I guess you must feel pretty good about yourself right now, am I right? Am I right or wrong, Peter?” James could see his little brother avoiding eye contact, and looking all together annoyed that they were having this discussion. He shook his head, but it was less in the manner of ‘no’ and more in the manner of ‘you don’t get it’. James knew. He’d been there. And it was the wrong answer.
“Screwdriver,” he requested. Tony handed him the one he’d been using earlier from the toolkit on the bed. “It’s not silly string.”
“If he is, well, we have our own Thor. And if Thor isn’t around—well, we know how to neutralize Asgardians. But I’m not concerned. This one doesn’t seem to understand Midgard all that well, he’ll be taking his directives from Rogers and Fury. And we’re at an advantage over Fury. I don’t believe for a second that man was unaware of the multiverse. He
So, yes, Kate was having problems, and Peter was acting weird, and James was having his usual issues, and there were eight extra pairs of eyes in the house watching their every move, but Tony didn’t
“I can’t make up for any of the times, now, when I forgot to remind Tony of how incredible she was, how heroic, and how much we all loved and cherished her. But um, this is—this is a time when I can at least remind all of us here of all of those things. There are, um, there are little booklets and pens in front of you; I would ask that everyone here, if you have a favorite memory of Tony that you write it down and we’ll… we’ll gather all of those together.”
, Steve. Because then it’s going to be that much more painful when what we know is already confirmed,” Tony pointed out. “We need to look at reality in the face, not hope for something better that we can’t have.” He picked up the spoon and gulped down another bite of the awful concoction. He tried not to think how long this particular can of Campbell’s had been sitting in the cabinet. Tony felt tense and sick and awful, but he knew that he had to eat
“Kate’s overdosed. She’s in the hospital,” Bucky said. Despite having imbibed much more than Steve had, he was completely coherent, and very gravely serious. It took a moment for Bucky’s words to sink in, for Steve to comprehend what was happening, but eventually it sunk in as his phrases merged.
Peter dead lifted a full ton in the lab with no trouble—male Tony wanted to conduct additional field tests to see just
“Why?” Steve asked, arguing. “3490 has shown us pretty clearly that they’re only trying to protect us. Those AIM agents were after
his upper thigh, hoping to stem the bleeding. The man’s face was grey, and his eyes were rolling about. “You’ll be ok, yeah? Just listen to my voice, ok? Stay with me, man, stay with me.” He held the man firmly by his shoulder, keeping him in an upright position. But who knew how much blood he had lost before James had arrived? James knew that if it was the femoral artery he’d cut, he had only minutes left, if that. He popped his head up over the car. He saw only chaos. There were no ambulances. There were no doctors. The Avengers were busy.
Steve had not felt quite so content in a very long time. He supposed, as the Other Avengers slowly filtered back into the house in pairs or trios, that it was no mystery as to
“It was hardly idyllic,” he finally said dryly. His eyes narrowed at the screen. “Is that—are those the AIM uniforms?” Kate’s heart leapt into her throat as her own eyes snapped to the television. Yes—those
be regular if they were going to keep the secrecy of this location—the Commander and the various 3490 Avengers the joined him couldn’t keep coming and going unnoticed. Natasha suspected the Commander wanted desperately to see his children and no one had the heart to tell him no. “Now that we’re all here. We’ve finally gotten a little bit of information on the situation. It isn’t much, but it’s a starting point.”
“How did you manage this?” Tony asked, baffled. If the kid was right on the specs, he’d just invented a complex compound out of organic chemistry…in his bedroom. Granted, he had more access to tools and equipment than the average kid, but this was just ridiculous. Peter just shrugged.
not eating so why should I have to?’ Steve moved his thumb back and forth on Tony’s shoulder in a small gesture that was somehow immensely comforting.
“Already, I have the power over space itself. I require only the other stones. The difficulty, of course, was in knowing where they were—and you have so graciously provided all of them for me,” the Red Skull went on as Steve wondered where the hell any of their fliers were. He glanced furtively to where Thor was on the battlefield, the gauntlet covering his hand. The Red Skull tsked like a disappointed school teacher.
“—calling me immature?” Steve caught the tail end of whatever Other Tony had been saying. He could guess the contents.
“Does this have to do with the time you called me down here to measure my arm and take my fingerprints?” James asked, raising an eyebrow.
“He didn’t hurt anybody,” James said. “I heard you talking. Nobody got hurt. Maybe some kid got his massive ego bruised. Was it right of Peter? Maybe not. But you can’t punch somebody over and over again and not expect a little backlash someday. You want to talk about consequences? I think that other kid just learned a lesson in them.”
, James thought to himself, moving from his hiding spot. They hadn’t spotted him when he stupidly just walked outside, but they would come into the warehouse soon enough; he needed somewhere to hide or they’d realize they had the right spot. Because what else would they be doing at this very spot if it wasn’t to find the entrance to the bunker? James ducked behind a large steel machine that had probably once been used to process fish.
Bucky only nodded and led him away towards a SHIELD vehicle that had arrived. SHIELD—they hadn’t really even discussed it, who was heading it, who was dealing with it—at the moment, everyone was reporting in to Maria Hill. Steve supposed they were going to have to deal with it all without him, now. Bucky put him in the SHIELD vehicle, a standard black SUV driven by some junior SHIELD agent whose name Steve probably knew, because he made it a point to know as many of the agents as he could, but Steve couldn’t recall it just then. Bucky hesitated for a moment, shouted something over his shoulder, and then got into the car beside him. Steve wanted to tell his oldest friend that it wasn’t necessary, but he didn’t have the energy to argue. And hell, what did he know—maybe it was.

, Tony. I’ll take care of things.” 3490 Tony flicked her eyes to the Alts and then back to her Steve.
“You’ve got nothing to be sorry for, Cap,” 3490 Tony said. She looked apologetic. “I’m sorry too—I didn’t want to have to mention it. I know this must be embarrassing, even if you honestly don’t have anything to be embarrassed about. I just think it’s better if we don’t…get close.”
“We work in relatives. It’s what we do. I know,” Natasha said, taking a breath. “I just want to know their angle.”
“Are you as bored as I am?” Steve asked a good while later. He was getting dizzy just watching everyone dance.
“Copy that, Commander,” Tony said as she landed on the balcony and disappeared inside the building. “Ok, running down the stairs now…through the kitchen, through the dining hall…more stairs…ok, your old floor…”
“But what if it’s capable of opening portals throughout the multiverse,” Tony finished. Kate turned her gaze to him, a little startled. Perhaps it was bad of her, but she often forgot that the MCU Avengers were even remotely competent—although they’d handled the lead at Bryant Park admirably. She knew they didn’t have any prior knowledge of the multiverse and hadn’t expected any of them to say a word. But here was the alternate version, the male version, of her mother, walking closer to Thor and tapping the palm of one hand with his smartphone in thought. “The kind of energy from one space stone demands reciprocity. It would be like a, like a magnet to another space stone, two magnets with the same polarity. They’d have to swap. Swap places, right? You couldn’t have two in one universe.”
“Yeah, you too,” Steve replied. He didn’t know if he watched her walk away or not. Steve only knew that he woke up the next morning still seated on the couch.
“You’re so mean to me,” female Tony said, with no note of actual offense in her voice. “Coffee now?”
. She held in her hands a large stack of papers, and a Bluetooth was permanently glued in her ear (metaphorically speaking; though, the way that mature Tony integrated tech and the human body, Pepper would not have honestly been surprised if her double had a Bluetooth implant). Pepper sat in the living room with Tony and the rest of the Avengers, minus Jane and Thor. Pepper had initially taken their near-constant absence as a sign that they were off having some much deserved couple time, but had been proven wrong the other day—Jane was having far too much fun at one of mature Tony’s labs in Manhattan, studying the multiverse she had previously suspected existed but never before been able to pin down. Thor, desiring to be near her and himself moderately interested in Midgardian science, went with her whenever she left. In absence of anything else to do, the other Avengers of their universe had returned to Mario Kart. Steve and Clint were engaged in a head to head battle. When Kate and Peter arrived home from school, Peter sat down and joined them while Kate disappeared. Natasha read a book in Russian. Bruce was absent from the room, because video games tended to agitate him. Tony was busy disassembling a remote control because mature Tony had refused him access to her personal lab. That was not a conversation that had gone over well.
“Tony’s a brilliant woman but not even her Extremis system can suss out records that were never electronic,” Fury explained. “This place was never on the record, and all files relating to it are kept here, in hard copy. The only people who know about it are the people who lived it—and that’s a grand total of
“You—that’s—what?” Tony demanded without actually finishing a question. Peter screwed the back onto the shooter, then fit the thing over his wrist. He pressed down on a button in his palm with his middle and index fingers, and white webbing shot out of the device, grabbing onto the opposite wall.
Tony didn’t need to be able to tell the doubles apart from the 3490s to have her worst fears suddenly set in. That hadn’t been friendly fire. That hadn’t been an accident, Steve getting hit with that shield. She hadn’t been shot out of the sky by any ordinary EMP—she’d been shot out by something that 525 Tony, intimately familiar with her armor, had designed. Tony screamed in rage and tried to get up—but the armor was much, much heavier than her. Without power she could barely sit up, let alone walk, and her entire body was aching from the crash. Where were
as bad as what his parents had been. Or his father, anyway. Really they weren’t even on the same scale. It was obvious, at least, that they loved their children. But that didn’t change the fact that clearly neither of them had any clue what was going on with Peter at school—hell, what had maybe
“It wouldn’t be the first time Heimdall had a blindspot Loki managed to exploit,” Natasha pointed out.
“Nope—Francis is. He’s in the garage. I asked Peter to come with us but you know how he has an aversion to fun,” Kate said seriously. As they entered the garage, Francis cheerfully greeted him,
Cold ice froze her veins as she slowly looked up. The entrance had collapsed—and now the nearest ceiling to it was also crumbling. The wooden structure had caught fire, and was falling in places in hunks of burning debris.
“Of course he couldn’t be,” she said venomously. Richards was never around when he was needed. He was always working in his laboratory, making failed experiments that Tony would inevitably have to clean up after with her team of either SHIELD agents or Avengers. The Fantastic Four were, in her opinion, rather incompetent. To be fair to them, though, they had only been in operation for two years as opposed to the Avengers’ much more substantial twenty.
, young man. You need to go do your essay, Pete, I saw your report card. You’ve got a C+ in that class right now, you can’t afford to procrastinate. Go finish your essay,” Steve said.
For the rest, if you have anything you want to know, anything you are still curious about, please leave a comment with your questions. I may write an epilogue, or a separate collection of ficlets to address these things. No guarantees.
“Hi! Hello!” Tony waved delicately, unable to hide the irritation from her voice. Things were moving too slowly for her taste. “Yes,
“Toothbrushes and toothpaste are in the medicine cabinet,” was all he said before leaving. Peter breathed in slowly through his nose, his stomach still churning. He had no idea how his parents had done what they did for as long as the had—was this what it felt like, every time? Peter rarely thought about his parents having to take lives. He thought about them apprehending villains, about them thwarting supervillain plots and saving the day. He rarely gave thought to the people his mother blasted out of the sky or his father took down with a blow to the head from his shield. Now that he did, his stomach just turned even more. He ended up over the toilet again, this time dry-heaving, until he felt two big, warm hands on his shoulders.
to be right here, still swinging that shield while you’re flying that tin can, telling kids to get off my lawn,” Steve said.
“She’s young, she’s rebellious, she’s impressionable, hell maybe she’s trying to prove some kind of point,” Antonella said. 3490 Steve just shook his head.
And, in that moment, Kate realized where she was and what she was really doing. She had a girl pinned beneath her, twisting her already broken arm behind her back in what must have felt like a torturous position. The other girl’s face was beginning to swell. Jeanne did not have super strength or speed or healing. Kate dropped her arm like it was a hot iron and stumbled backward, letting her up. Jeanne stood, wobbling a bit, but her stare was impassive. Satisfied. Kate realized that Jeanne had never wanted a rematch at all. She had wanted this. Even in defeat, she had gotten what she wanted.
Avengers? All she could see was 525 Steve and 525 Natasha beating on Steve—what about everyone else? Why was no one helping him?
For fifteen minutes he drew a particularly stunning lily located at the front of the property. He spent another half an hour sketching a rosebush as he wandered further back. Finally he reached the wooded area and continued his walk, taking detours off the paths to look at specific trees. He was just getting ready to sketch an interesting birch tree with knots that made it appear to have a face, when there was a sharp gasp below him. He looked down, startled by the noise. Seated near his feet, leaning against the base of a tree, was Kate Rogers, smoking a joint, peering up at him with wide blue eyes. He was surprised he hadn’t noticed the smell beforehand—it was definitely not tobacco.
“I don’t,” Steve replied. When the bartender returned with Tony’s drink, Steve ordered one of his own. Tony took a sip of his brandy, watching Steve with dark eyes.
“Tell you what, I’ll swing by the restaurant and pick up some dessert and put it in the fridge and we can have our own—much more private—dinner whenever you get home,” Steve said, and his voice was deep and filled with suggestion. A chill ran all the way down to her toes—she

“Brilliant scientist. Scatterbrained though. And he has powers of elasticity which are—well, they’re useful but frankly a little disturbing to see sometimes. You get used to it, though. Sort of. He’s our go-to guy for time travel, alternate universes and the like. I’m sure you’ll meet him at some point,” Bruce said. “He’s also in the Fantastic Four, another superhero team around here.”
“Their children are highly trained. They’re very efficient killers. Did none of you see James in the field?” Natasha asked with a raised eyebrow. “I don’t think they have to worry about their kids.”
“Steve can you talk to me?” Natasha asked him. “The ambulance is on the way, Steve. You’re going to be fine.”
It was a relief when the Avengers of Earth 525 showed up. Their job would be done twice as quickly. Tony was eager to get home to little Peter and Kate, just three years old, as she hadn’t seen them at all that day. Tony was in the air, fighting off an insistent little doombot and keeping an eye on Steve who was on the ground, when something weird happened. Steve got hit with his shield.
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Commander Rogers spoke, then put the little device away. “I do apologize for the invasiveness of these measures. Now it’s your turn. Ask us what you want to know.”
“It’s—I hate to say it but it might be our best option, Tony,” Steve said. “It would be for his own good.”
“We were defending the base from a pretty large scale attack. It shouldn’t have been that difficult, honestly. We’d set up landmines all along the perimeter, and their weapons weren’t particularly long-range. They had to get up close to do any real damage, and getting up close involved getting blown to kingdom come by those landmines. So we were mostly just waiting them out, taking out enemy soldiers who came through the few gaps we had in our perimeter. Since we knew where the landmines were, we didn’t worry about soldiers coming from those directions. We knew they’d be taken care of.
Natasha wouldn’t say anything at all, she’d just send his coat to the cleaners, he was sure. She’d expect them to patch the hole, too, and they

comment that really irritated him: “I see you haven’t yet decided to stop re-enacting the part of ‘geek’ in every 80s movie ever. How’s the whole ‘virgin’ thing working out for you?” Peter felt his nerves alight, but he kept them fairly well in check.
“I’m just hoping they were from another earth, not our timeline, otherwise we might start seeing some ill effects from those fights,” Dad said. “At least they disappeared fairly quickly.”
“Huh,” Peter said. “Well that’s weird.” He looked directly at Tony. “But I guess it’s weirder that Mom has a beard.” Tony couldn’t help but laugh at that. 3490 Tony just rolled her eyes.
“Sorry, Tony,” spoke 525 Tony though the mask, the Iron voice sounding eery and emotionless. “It’s better this way.” 525 Tony flew away—and then, suddenly, her boots stopped working.
Tony pouted. Pepper sighed. Often it occurred to her that her boss was a very large child. She had, long ago, convinced herself that this was all that Tony Stark could ever be, that it was an intrinsic, immovable part of himself and was, admittedly, part of his charm. But as mature Steve clapped his son on the shoulder and invited him to the garage to continue work on a bike they were fixing up together, the son he’d had with
“Well what’s a hospital going to say anyway?” Peter challenged. “Probably ‘sorry, can’t help you’. So what does it matter?”

This Vision is…much more independent than mine, besides. He’s really—mine is his own personality, and he’s gaining more and more independence, but this one is his own
Steve turned to look at her. She was beautiful, as she always was. Whether covered in grease or dolled up and perfumed, talking with a mouthful of doughnut or singing very softly to herself when she thought no one was around, wearing baggy sweatpants or a low-back ball gown, Tony was singularly beautiful. At that moment on the beach, her dark curly hair fell about her head in gentle halo, the perfect frame. He would paint her, later, and then feel guilty for doing so. She turned her head then, meeting his blue eyes with her brown, an eyebrow quirked a little bit. “Can you, even? Get old?” Steve thought about it for a moment.
“Aaaaand point to Rogers,” Other Clint piped up. For his part, he was busy assembling and disassembling a set of arrows Tony had given him as soon as he’d returned. She’d prepared a little something for all of them—Other Clint received a bow and arrows, Other Natasha a set of stilettos (the blades, not the shoes), Other Bruce a pair of special ‘stretchy’ pants like their own Bruce had, Other Pepper a Louis Vuitton bag, and Other Tony a K’nex set and an admonition to stop taking apart household appliances and go to the downtown lab already. Jane and Thor had presents waiting as well, but Steve didn’t know what. In this particular case, Steve was unsure of his wife’s motivations. He didn’t know if she simply wanted to make their extended houseguests feel particularly welcome, or if it was a reward for leaving the house (and thus, a bribe towards further out of house adventures for the alts and perhaps more frequent in house adventures for them). He really wouldn’t mind if it was the second. Tony,
or whatever it is that’s gotten warped and set on a loop inside that incredibly dense brain of yours.” He put a friendly hand on the man’s shoulder, but as soon as Tony’s eyes met his, he withdrew like he’d been electrified.
“Awful things happen in war, Tony,” Steve said, his eyebrows knitting together in confusion. “Is Rhodey ok?”
“Shit, shit, shit,” Peter whispered as he dragged his bum leg out from beneath the shelving, still struggling to hold the thing up. Inch by painful inch, he moved it out, and when it was done, he dropped the shelving like it was made of molten lava. He bit his lip as the pain only grew. His spider healing could help with a lot, but he was still human.
, Nick Fury, have been running from HYDRA for over a year because of a single skirmish?” Steve asked, disbelieving.
“Well that’s a load of bull,” Steve said, rolling his eyes. Tony looked at him sharply. Steve just raised an eyebrow. “Oh, please, Tony. Does Harley ring any bells?” Tony looked so indignant and mad it was hilarious.
“Certainly, sir. Master James, these are alternate Avengers trapped in our world. They have been invited to stay here by your step-mother and father,” JARVIS helpfully supplied.
In the mean time, they discussed their plans in very low voices, well aware of Happy in the front seat, even if he was cut off from them. Natasha’s mission the previous morning had been somewhat successful. She had managed to obtain files on them but had been caught in the act.

“Yes,” Kate replied. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw 3490 Tony gently pull apart Kate’s eyelids to check her eyes more thoroughly.
“Fury’s basically a robot. He’s less sexual than JARVIS. And I’m sure Steve’ll be thrilled at the suggestion.”
“If I do, will you give me what I want?” 525 Steve asked. He was met with silence. James felt one big, broad, warm hand (a familiar hand, and it made his skin crawl) move from his shoulder to wrap around the back of his neck. It was a gentle pressure, but threatening. “Necks are such a weak point, aren’t they? Such a design flaw. No wonder Tony makes his suits practically without them. They’re too easy to snap.”
Bruce could tell him that. And now that he was actually thinking it, it wasn’t a half bad idea. But… he wasn’t sure if he
“I only remember the mirrors and the purple lipstick,” Kate admitted, the tiniest of smiles on her face.
just then, and then glanced over to her laptop, which presented surveillance trained on the other Avengers team. They were still processing the whole ‘thrown into another universe thing’, and from what she could hear they were still trying to figure out why in the hell one of their young agents went rogue and sent them to 3490. “All right, I could probably sit and talk to you on the phone all night but I’m going to hang up now because A) I think my job entails actually monitoring the situation at hand, B) I haven’t seen this season of
“No. No, you know what, Cap—it’s not,” Tony said. He took a step forward. “I can’t begin to detail how weird and confusing and bizarre the last few months have been—”
Kate had only sort of understood, in those moments. And shortly after that, her mother had joked about it being too early for philosophical conversations (though in the day, or in Kate’s life, Kate couldn’t say, looking back). But she thought, in the last few months, she’d gained a serious understanding of what it meant to
“That isn’t the point, James. There are other ways of dealing with your problems that don’t involve violence or humiliation,” Steve said.
“Just eyes? That Kate would probably find the exact wrong spot in your armor and stick a foam arrow in there that would make the whole thing explode,” Steve replied. Tony looked very indignant.
“Urgh. I take it back. I take back everything bad I ever said about Mom’s cooking, because this—“ Peter began, but then he stopped. Kate felt like she’d been slapped. Judging by how quickly the blood drained from Peter’s face, he had, too. He just put the plate down on the floor next to him and brought his knees up, resting his chin on top of them. Kate just squeezed her mug tighter. For a moment, he’d forgotten. Kate, on the other hand, never had. Kate hadn’t slept. Kate couldn’t eat. Kate couldn’t think about anything, except for the fact that her mother was dead and it was all her fault.
—” Kate was in the middle of raging when a loud alarm sounded through the building. It was almost deafening, like a fire alarm but somehow even more urgent. Francis, Torrun, and Kate all knew what it was at once.
“Yeah. Yeah,” Peter agreed, still feeling oddly dazed. MCU Steve didn’t leave the bathroom until Peter had found a toothbrush and toothpaste. Peter brushed, willing himself not to think of anything at all. Peter finished cleaning up, headed to one of the bedrooms, swiping a pillow and blanket that had been neatly folded on a chair. The younger Barton brothers and their sister slept on the bed. Billy, Teddy, and Tommy were also in the room, settling down for the night on the floor.
“Good,” 3490 Tony said. She finished off her coffee and stood, heading to the sink to put it away. 3490 Steve walked into the kitchen then, a cell phone in his hand and a confused expression on his face.
“Think Hulk can keep presence of mind to avoid any blue light?” Steve asked as he kicked an agent out of his way, scrambling to climb up one of the winter village huts to get a better vantage point.
flirted with this week, anyway?” James replied. Francis scowled. It didn’t take long before Kate was walking towards them, drinks in hand. Even if James hated that he was eyeing up his baby sister, he had to admit the guy was an excellent bartender. James had no idea what he was drinking, but it was dark and heavy and had a lot of burn going down. It was just what James needed. Kate’s drink, however, was Pepto-Bismol pink and probably horrifically sweet. Francis’ was blue, and he seemed to like it against his will. They all headed down to the basement together, but they were soon separated. James was quickly snatched up by a hot brunette with a forked tongue; he didn’t know where Francis had gone, but he could see his little sister dancing with a few guys at the same time. Well, that was just her style.
He trusted Tony. He understood Tony. He knew it was a mutual thing. And no matter what else happened, they’d gained that. They’d earned it.
“No,” he said. “No, I—someone strong has to do it, right? And you have to be careful about what you ask for. What you want in that moment. Because reality will bend to your will and I—Tony. I want. I want too much. I want the world to be better. I want all my friends to have made it out of the war. I want Bucky to be alive, and well, and have never had to be the Winter Soldier like he is here. I want this universe’s Tony back, so she can go home to her family. I—I would try. Not to make all of it reality. I’d try. But I don’t know if I’d succeed. But you—Tony. I watched you fly into space in New York. You laid down on that wire. I think—I think you should do it. I trust you to do it. More than I trust myself.”
“But,” Tony said, “that would be a lie.” Young Steve looked at her hard, and Tony laughed. “I’m not spying on you. JARVIS isn’t tracking your movements. It was a guess. Ease up, Cap.” Comprehension dawning, young Steve relaxed. Well, perhaps he wasn’t wholly like her Steve. Her Steve was, even at that point, more relaxed than this Steve, who seemed wary of surveillance and not all together trusting. Her Steve had been totally trusting—or, if he hadn’t been, he had never shown it to Tony. But then, her Steve had been an artist, and Tony couldn’t help but recall that this one was an immediate Avenger. She sympathized. He’d been tossed from one war straight into another with no time in between to grieve, no time to recuperate, no time to remember who
“Peter? On MGH?” Antonella asked, scandalized. “No, I don’t think so. Could it be—a belated second round of puberty? Maybe your genes finally kicking in…?”
The only other person who, like Peter, didn’t seem to be busy was his dad. Peter noticed him sitting at the counter on a bar stool, occasionally sipping at a cup of coffee that had probably long since gone cold and observing the proceedings. He looked a little—lost. There was something in how he stared at Kate and Francis picking through their arrows that seemed somehow distant, as if he didn’t really see them at all. Peter wondered what he was seeing instead, or if he wasn’t seeing anything at all.
“Food would be great,” Steve said, looking around at the group for affirmation. Steve had fashioned himself the spokesman for the group, and this instance Tony found he didn’t mind. He could use food, though what he could really use
“Don’t be ridiculous, I bother Azari, too,” Francis said, still cheerfully french braiding Kate’s hair. Peter didn’t even know how to do a french braid. He wondered, briefly, when and why Francis had learned that particular skill.
. We need more Avengers. And we already have some extras from another universe! We’re just—we’re overwhelmed, Francis. You know it, I know it, and the enemy has to know it too. Maybe this was all their plan—just keep us busy with other stuff while they do whatever evil shit they have planned,” Kate said, sighing.
Pieces. Everything was pieces. Light (dark, mostly dark, with the yellow and neon lights the only relief from the darkness—no more beacon, no more white-blue, the building was gone and nothing looked clean anymore), color (yellow, neon, black, red, white, and blue), sound (screaming)—fragments.
“All right. You just seem—anxious,” Steve spoke cautiously. Tony pinched the bridge of his nose with his good hand.
Steve Rogers had experienced a lot of awkward things in his (either relatively short or extraordinarily long) lifetime. He could recall countless “double dates” with Bucky, always blind. Some girls were out and out rude to a little guy like him. Others smiled politely and tried to make conversation—but their pained expressions were always pretty obvious. Stuttering with a sandwich next to Tony Stark of Earth 3490 was definitely up there on his list of Embarrassing and Awkward Moments. But Steve didn’t think that anything could really top the awkwardness of this moment, sitting on opposite ends of the couch as Tony Stark, watching the news play out the battle that was going on elsewhere in the city.
“It’s just—out there today—Tony, I need to trust that you can follow orders,” Steve said as they walked. “Especially given that our jobs are often highly
There were plenty of things Steve should have been thinking at that moment. He should have been wondering who could have done this, should have been wondering what Tony was going to say, should have been doing his best to help the other Avengers send warning to civilians in the other buildings and evacuate them in an orderly fashion, should have been holding his numb and horrified children, but there was, in fact, only one thing that Steven Grant Rogers was thinking that awful Christmas Eve.
Oh. No. Totally an evil robot falling from the sky. All right then. Kate ducked behind an abandoned car as a blue plasma bullet shot from the eye of the thing and straight at her. Francis happened to already be there. His hair was mussed and there was a crooked grin on his face. He was out of breath.
, at his worst, with his own son. She hadn’t wanted him to lose another child. And mightn’t he? As Steve stared at his sheet-white son, it was an all together too familiar situation—except when it had been Kate, she’d been happy to see him again. She’d given him a hug and he’d told her he loved her and all was forgiven even if he was upset. But with James? If he woke this instant would he be glad to see Steve? Or would he just groan and roll over and go back to sleep, wishing one of his friends was here instead?
which did not seem to be a concept that Stark completely understood. Oh sure, Stark worked all the time—he worked around the clock, really, but he never ceased to play, either. He drank while he came up with new inventions, played angry birds while he sat in meetings—he couldn’t sit still for more than two minutes. Being completely, 100% devoted to a task did not seem to be within his capabilities.
, though his mother seemed less inclined to punishing him when he said, honestly, that he’d just fallen asleep on the subway. Hence the lack of a phone signal. They had yelled at him, and Peter didn’t like that. He also didn’t like the suspicious looks they kept sending him. He didn’t like them being suspicious of anything, for he’d never had anything to hide before.
It wasn’t the gathering that made Kate hopeful or nervous, though—it was the gauntlet Thor held. She’d heard stories about it. It had been used once before in their universe, she knew. Her parents had spoken of it before, but never of what it was used for, or who had wielded it. It was such a quiet thing she sometimes wondered if anyone even remembered, or if the gauntlet had somehow wiped the experience largely from their minds.
The bunker was quiet. The kids were all in bed. The Avengers of Steve’s earth were all too exhausted to converse. Steve showered quickly, getting all the blood and dirt off of himself. He didn’t have a change of clothes, but all the SHIELD bunkers kept a few extra things in the linen closet, so he’d grabbed a fresh pair of sweats and a t-shirt. They were a bit small, but at least they weren’t covered in filth. He checked into one of the rooms in the bunker, peeking in to see his sleeping children. Well, Peter and Kate anyway; Steve didn’t know where James was, but he doubted his oldest boy was sleeping. Steve could hear the Avengers of 199999 speaking quietly in the kitchen, deliberating over the information Steve had dumped on them. There had probably been a better way to divulge that information, a more tactful way, but Steve was all out of tact. Steve was all out of energy. Steve was all out of everything. He was hollow.
“Wow, I am so sorry for your tragedy, Kate. It’s absolutely terrible that you snuck out of the house and got completely fucking trashed and now have to suffer actual
“I’m the fastest, I’ll be right back,” Tony assured him. It was true, she was the fastest. She could fly straight to the top. “Where is she, Peter?”
Thanks for reading, everyone. This is just a brief notice that this story will be taking a quick hiatus at the end of May following the conclusion of Part One of this story. This hiatus should be no more than a month, and hopefully less than that. This is to give me a bit of catch-up time with writing. After that, the chapters will be posted on Tuesdays and Fridays as normal once again. Thank you!
eating, and his vegetarian curry smelled delicious. Thor was dressed down in casual clothes which, even after all this time, discomfited Steve slightly. He could never get the image of Thor in his armor and red cape reconciled with this regular (if buff) guy in jeans with his hair pulled back in a ponytail. While the avengers had reverted to their street clothes, Fury, Hill, and Coulson were still very, very formal, to no one’s surprise. What
Steve had spent the last few months admiring the skills of this young girl (even if he did not understand her, really, even if he disapproved of some of her actions). But it struck him then, that he was staring down at a sixteen year old. She hadn’t even finished high school yet. Hell, even back in the war you had to be eighteen to join up—or you could be seventeen, if your parents consented, but you’d never see combat. But this girl, barely old enough to drive, had been fighting in live combat for the past two months, had been leading, and here they were again, about to go right into the heart of war.
Tony would know later, from the recordings, that the battle was actually quite quick once 199999 showed up. They had experience with these creatures. And they also had a guess as to where they were coming from—a cosmic cube, lodged in a metal device at the top of a building. They worked together with Commander Rogers to take the cube out, and the moment that they did, the signal was lost, and all the Chitauri collapsed to the ground, dead or unconscious or…something.
“If they’re treating us as enemies,” Steve said, “at least they’re quite hospitable about it.” Tony let out a laugh, but internally his heart had begun to race in panic. Steve was looking at him, all his attention focused on
“They’ve caused a hell of a lot of trouble this year, the MGH users,” James said. “Making a bad name for mutants—hitting up drugstores and doing small time muggings, shit like that. I’m not sure I’d put it past little brother if he got desperate enough with that jackwad—what’s his name again? Flash or some shit stupid name like that?—but that didn’t
,” Kate said, breathless. Jeanne just regarded her with that same calculating expression that she always did, and it sent shivers up her spine.
James was exceedingly grateful for his early Christmas present from Tony—he had no idea how it really worked, and Tony said it was a very early prototype, but it was an armband that could create a holographic shield capable of being just as corporeal as his father’s, just as bullet proof and great for throwing. He used it to take out a couple of enemy troops before managing to grab a gun from one.
“Hey Mom, I don’t think we have any eggs,” he said, but his mother was still engaged with the older Captain. Peter sighed with exasperation. He could see the faces of the astounded Alts, and he rolled his eyes in their direction. “Yeah, they do this all the time. It’s awful.” He cupped his hands over his mouth, forming a temporary megaphone. “MOM WE’RE OUT OF EGGS.” 3490 Tony broke from Steve Rogers’ embrace briefly.
“Oh, Stark, I think this is a poor time for you to be discussing sticks up asses,” he said, genuinely amused, but Stark only got more mad.
. Groaning, and then moaning—all entirely from the pain—Peter got up, grasping at a fallen shelf to help balance himself. He looked around, this time remembering what he was looking for and where. There, in one corner of the room was a simple air vent. It was high up—what Peter would usually be able to jump up to, he would have to drag himself up with his sticky hands. That is, if he could even make it over there. Breathing hard, Peter grit his teeth and made his way over.
“James? Why do you have a gun pointed at the alts?” Tony had never been more grateful to see a sixteen-year-old girl in his life, including after prom night. She came up behind him, still dressed in her school uniform.
“I—“ he had tried to kill her, but Tony found herself faltering. How could she kill this broken man? What had happened to him to make him this way? How could she kill someone who had dropped all defenses, who refused to fight back, who begged for death? 525 Tony seemed to sense her thoughts. Or perhaps he could just read her body language, could see the weakening of her stance and the lowering of her arm. He sighed.
“Well,” Steve said, though his voice still felt and sounded rough, “Now that the funeral isn’t needed anymore, I guess it’s time to get them all home.”
? James wondered about that. Had his brother finally come into the world of superhumans, manifesting latent super genes? It seemed so unlikely—but then, what did James really know about genetics.
he’d said all those years ago. And that was the end of it. They never brought up what had happened. And it had hung between them for years, the untouchable subject, the elephant in the room. But what could either of them say, really? Nothing could really cover it all.
Breakfast had become an event in the Stark-Rogers household. Perhaps it always had been—Tony had no idea. But it was
“All right then,” Steve replied, doing his best to mask the uncertainty there. He should never have pushed the issue, should never have flirted the way he had. He was the team leader—what had he been thinking, jeopardizing everything this way?
turns his phone off. I’ve told him time and again not to turn it off in case something happens! It’s not even off when he’s at school!” she said.
“Love you too, Dad,” Peter said, choking on a lump in his throat. Dad released him, put hands on Peter’s shoulders.
you’ve got moles,” Fury groused. Steve felt a pang go straight through his heart at the callous mention of Tony and her life’s work, all come crashing down in a single moment.
“Commander,” Steve’s double called out. He held up a shield that Steve recognized as his own. “I caught this after it took the head off a Chitauri. Didn’t realize it wasn’t mine, I just didn’t think.”
“I can’t hack the eyes in the ceiling,” Tony said. He sounded embarrassed, and maybe ashamed. “Their…uh…
“And as we sat there he told me—as he’d been telling me for the past two weeks—that he would support me in whatever decision I would make. He told me that he would happily be a father to any children we ever had, whenever we wanted to have any, if ever we wanted to have any. I mean, we weren’t even married but he—he was already planning a future for us. I kind of knew he had been from the moment we’d gotten together, but it was still kind of jarring. I was kind of just waiting for the moment when I screwed up big enough that he would leave,” she said. Tony snorted.
“I don’t want to argue, Tony. I think we can discuss these issues better if everyone is together and we’re not worried about James running off on his own—“
“You know as well as I do that Francis refuses to touch a hair on my head in a non-platonic manner,” Kate pointed out. It still annoyed her. Francis’ lack of reciprocation was a constant irritant to her. She
“No,” Peter answered. He picked a spot away from the others in the corner, dropped his pillow on the ground, and settled down, facing away from them. There was no point in lying. But there was no point in talking, either. He closed his eyes, exhausted, but knowing that he wouldn’t sleep. The images that danced in his mind’s eye—the windows of the 91
—we’re only ever a few steps away. You need something? We’ll try to help,” 3490 Tony said. She grinned. “You grew on us, too. Like mold.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said, adding in the signs for the words. “I’m distracted. Natasha’s in Albania with Bucky, I can’t send her. What’s the situation with the alts?”
“So,” the Commander spoke finally as the children gathered into the kitchen. They had been waiting on everyone to show up to begin their breakfast meeting, which was becoming a regular thing. Natasha knew that it
Kate thought she had never heard a sweeter sound than Peter’s voice in that moment. She wondered if she ever would, or if that would remain forever as the single best auditory input she’d ever experienced.
“Morning Steve,” Clint said over her shoulder. Kate pulled away from the hug and looked up at her dad, who was, bleary-eyed, pouring himself a cup of coffee.
“I’d like that, thanks,” Tony said. Peter wheeled his desk chair over to his bookcase, grabbed a few books off the shelf, then wheeled back and handed them to Tony.
3490 Tony’s hand on his arm, and he met her gaze. “Steve. Sometimes we just have to accept the things we cannot change. And I know for a fact Bucky wouldn’t want you wallowing over everything that has happened to him. He wouldn’t want you blaming yourself. When we get you back to your universe you can go hunt for him—but that’s the best you can hope for, right now. It’s not going to do you any good to dwell on it.” Tony rose, drawing her jacket around herself tighter. “Don’t freeze to death while you’re out here. I’m not sure the universe could take the irony.” She shot him a final, soft, sweet smile, and Steve felt his heart jerk. She exited the garden while Steve just sat there, staring at the flowers and swallowing the lump in his throat.
“It’s the shield, isn’t it?” Tony asked. “We can redesign it, James. I know you don’t want to just—just carry your father’s shield forever. I get that. I just—it was just a convenient template, so—”
“Hey. You ready for this?” Steve turned to look at Tony. He was in the suit, face plate raised up. Steve recognized that expression now; it was deep, serious concern disguised by light, flippant concern over top. He was surprised to realize that he’d probably understood Tony’s expressions for a lot longer than he wanted to admit. There were some things he might have been—deliberately misunderstanding. Because when he had risen in a new time he’d been hurt and angry and alone and he’d taken it out on the easiest target he could find. And Tony had usually let him.
“Well, stock’s about to take a dive, that’s for sure. Can we get some wine with this dinner? I think I need it,” Other Pepper said, resigned. Tony felt an enormous rush of relief and a tender love for Other Pepper. The others seemed to take their cue from her, and soon enough she and Steve had so many drinks orders it was a good thing Tony’d had a very short stint with a guy who was a bartender. She and Steve passed out drinks for everyone to go with their hardy dinner of steak and potatoes (Tony figured they could use the good food, after news like that). Tony even allowed Peter and Kate to have a glass of wine each—a luxury she never allowed for fear they’d develop a taste for it, but she did feel a bit grateful that her children hadn’t made a fuss when they’d informed them that their guests would be invading their personal home for an extended period of time (though Kate had rolled her eyes and sighed heavily). Tony, therefore, was the only one at the table without any alcohol. She was drinking carbonated water instead. Among her own Avengers, this never raised any eyebrows, so she wasn’t expecting it when Other Clint piped up:
“I left him passed out in bed. He’s still exhausted, poor man,” 3490 Tony said, a very suggestive grin on her face. She sipped her coffee. “And not actually a morning person.”
“Screw yourself on a long pole, fuck face,” Peter said casually. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Alt Steve choke on his coffee. Alt Tony, however—who was, Peter had decided, a version of his mother had she never grown out of her twenties and was therefore a degree cooler if vastly less responsible—was smirking. James just laughed.
Steve Rogers—awarded the Medal of Honor for single handedly rescuing two hundred men from captivity. Quite impressive, Captain,” Stark said, for once sounding respectful.
“I’ve done everything I can, but if she wants to she can take remote control of your armor,” Kate warned him.
“What do we say to the God of Death?” his mother had teased him just a few months before, when he was doing his homework and complaining of dying whilst doing it. She’d loved
“Dad?” this time, the question was a croak. Steve looked down, barely daring to hope that James was awake so soon. But there he was, peering up at him through half-lidded eyes.
“It’s a secret. Suffice it to say there’s a decent amount of everclear, so you’re not going to feel it until it hits you,” Tony explained. She finished by refilling Other Steve and Bucky’s shots, then her own.
Tony mumbled something. Steve wouldn’t remember what, though he was sure it was something to the effect of “ok”. He got up shortly after and left the room, and Steve returned to staring at the ceiling.
,” Bruce commanded. Billy didn’t argue. James and Billy—and Bruce, to his surprise—began to shimmer with a light blue magic.
prove to 3490 that MCU was as treacherous as they feared. Did they stay and die on the orders of a 22 year old? Or did they cut their losses and run, possibly to be executed or imprisoned on another day?
“I’m not handing you anything, really, you’re just passing something to yourself. Go on, take it,” she said. Puzzled, Tony did. He frowned at it.
“He doesn’t know his strength,” Steve had argued time and time again. “He doesn’t appreciate the power that comes along with it. If I don’t teach him, who will, Tony?”
Tony didn’t know whether to feel relieved, elated, or still terrified as he flew Steve out over the battlefield and dropped him in the thickest bit. Hydra agents, unfortunately, weren’t droids from
Now standing at the central console was Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, Maria Hill, Clint Barton, Natasha Romanov, Thor, Jane Foster, Pepper Potts, and one other. Were it not for the final person, Tony might have thought that she had done her calculations wrong, that the energy had pulled people from different corners of the world—but the last person made it a dead giveaway that her calculations were indeed correct. Standing next to Clint was Tony Stark—only Tony Stark was a man. Tony, still standing next to Matthews’ desk, drinking her coffee, raked her eyes over the man.
“You know how this goes, Captain. It’s very simple. You give me what I want—every safe house location and code, and every password to every electronics system (of course, Tony can crack them but it goes so much more smoothly with them). You do that, and the boy goes free. You don’t and—well. At least it will be quick. I could draw it out, but, frankly, I draw the line at torturing children. Have to have a line in the sand somewhere, don’t we? And you have two others, anyway,” 525 Steve said. “So, what’ll it be? The information or your little boy’s neck?” James knew that he was shaking like crazy now. He was surprised he was still standing. Tears flowed freely down his cheeks and he did his best to choke back his terrified sobs. Dad would save him. He would. But 525 Steve was met with silence. Prolonged silence.
, which is to be expected given his background. And he’s not as innocent and apple pie as he looks either.” Antonella threw in a smirk with that last comment. Tony just raised an eyebrow.
“He’d have meant you needed to be medicated, huh? Well, it’s not surprising. I didn’t get along with my Steve at first, either,” Tony admitted. Other Steve looked at her with an intensity that made Tony a bit uncomfortable. Had it been her Steve, she would have jumped him on the spot, but this wasn’t her Steve, and it was difficult to remember that.
But James knew that was wrong. Intellectually, he knew that was wrong. He wasn’t sure he’d feel bad about it, but he knew it was
late. I didn’t start really growing until my senior year,” Steve explained. He could see the disbelief on Tony’s face. He could only shrug. “Don’t ask me how it happened, I haven’t got a clue. So I didn’t play anything in high school, and in college…it seemed kind of late. It takes more than just muscle to play most sports, it takes technique, and I didn’t have any. I joined the intramural basketball team, though.”
when you came to visit us. It happens—sometimes people just fall through the cracks but this…” Dr. Richards went silent. He looked disturbed.
Tony sloshed the mix into shot glasses. Even if she couldn’t drink, hadn’t drunk for years, it didn’t mean she didn’t remember all the best recipes. In her own shot glass she had a modified recipe of the same drink—all syrups and flavorings with ginger ale. It wasn’t the same, but it would do. And if she started feeling itchy for the real deal later in the night, well, she knew Steve would keep an eye on her. He wouldn’t be drinking either—well, he’d be drinking, but the alcohol wouldn’t affect him. She took another bottle, filled with a blue liquid filled with ingredients she’d carefully crafted in the early nineties, and put it in two separate shot glasses. She handed one to Other Steve and one to Bucky. Bucky, of course, took it with a grin. Other Steve just looked confused.
“He took his board to school, so I’m guessing he’s at the skate park. Or just wandering around the city, who knows,” Kate said with a shrug. She wasn’t particularly happy with Peter. She might have overreacted this morning, but she didn’t understand why Peter couldn’t just mind his own business. “Why, did you come to talk him?”
the bedroom was amiss.) Usually, Steve found himself drawing Bucky. Over and over again he’d draw him, in every pose and with every conceivable expression. But lately he’d found himself drifting away from his favorite subject. It was because it was easy, Steve told himself—it was easy to draw Tony, because he was usually there to see. He drew Tony working in the lab, Tony playing basketball, Tony drinking coffee, Tony in a meeting (playing on his stark phone), Tony talking to Pepper—because that was what he could see, Steve insisted silently.
“Oh, I’m just on my way to the bathroom,” Tony said, before berating his choice. 3490 Steve raised an eyebrow.
“So what’s the damage, Doctor Banner?” Tony inquired, hours later. She had watched almost the entirety of season six of
know about this base?” Steve had to admit he had been ready to be angry at Fury—how could he disappear on them like that, when they needed him?
“Why did Mom go back inside the building?” Kate’s voice popped up behind Steve. He turned to look at her.
“Look, you know, you don’t need to do everything around here. I’d be happy to help out—if not with watching security feeds if you don’t trust us with that, we could at least take care of putting the kids to bed—” Steve offered, but he was cut off by an absolutely livid James who yelled,
she missed her husband. She turned her gaze to Other Tony instead and caught him staring at her chest. She flashed him a grin. “Yes, we make one sexy lady and one handsome man, don’t we?” Other Tony laughed.
“With all due respect Commander, she’s endangering the lives of civilians not to mention the property damage. Calm her down in the next sixty seconds or I’m firing the EMP,” 3490 Hawkeye said calmly. Looking murderous, 3490 Steve signed some things that were probably not very complimentary and threw out at least one sign that even Tony—and Steve—understood perfectly well. 3490 Clint seemed completely undeterred. 3490 Steve returned to conversing with his wife. Tony only caught a few words of the Italian (and why were they talking in Italian anyway? Did
“If you’re still alive this time next year,” she said, “I’ll be thankful to get to clobber you in battle once more.”
“Ok. Ok. It’s probably the broken bone. When help comes they’ll fix it,” Peter said. There was a loud
“I would say that’s perfect, but actually I can’t use you, Doctor Banner. The gamma radiation in your cells throws off our data,” Tony said apologetically. It could have been Tony’s imagination, but she thought Other Bruce looked a touch disappointed. Perhaps it was because getting stabbed in the arm in the name of science was just yet another thing that he could not do because of the Hulk.
Kate woke up still exhausted. Her whole body was drained and aching, though part of that was probably due to the fact that she was still sleeping on the floor. Most everyone was still asleep, but Kate, though she didn’t know how early it might be, didn’t feel like sleeping anymore. She moved around the sleeping bodies on the floor and left the room, heading into the kitchen. She passed her sleeping father, passed out on the couch, and then into the kitchen area. Clint was already up and making coffee. She knew it was 3490 Clint just by the way he moved around. Kate took a seat at the table. Clint glanced at her, then poured another cup of coffee. He set the second mug down in front of her and took a seat as well.
“Wh-what? No, I just—I get hungry. Early. Woke up early. It’s—I—fast metabolism?” Steve tried to explain, cursing his twisted tongue. He was flustered. That he could admit to. He was
“What if he would have been happier not knowing?” Tony asked, looking into Steve’s eyes. He looked so panicked, so guilty. “What if I shouldn’t have told him? He was—shit, I think he was crying.”
“Brought you something,” Torrun said. James moved the pillow off his head. He had deep circles under his eyes, which were red from lack of sleep. He took the plate Torrun offered.
“Steve!” she said, doing her best to keep her voice steady. “Perfect timing. The Captain here wanted to speak to the both of us. Have you got some time?”
By popular consensus that no one had spoken, the alternate Avengers met in the kitchen after breakfast for a meeting. 3490 Tony and Steve had both left for the Triskelion, and the kitchen seemed the most obvious meeting place. The other potential spot was the living room, but the potential for someone to turn on the television and therefore cause a derailment of the meeting was too high, so the kitchen it was. When they all sat, the Avengers looked to him.
was really the sum of it. She didn’t feel like having her heart repeatedly stomped on after everything that had already happened. But she’d never seen Francis look so miserable in her life, and if this
“Yeah, yeah, good plan, ok—Cap, where’s Cap?” Tony asked, but before anyone answered he spied him in the thickest crowd of Hydra agents, pummeling about twenty of them at once, somehow, which as far as Tony understood was really Steve’s M.O. He dove down and landed next to him, doing his part to take down like three whole guys before enough of them were unconscious that Tony could lift his face plate. They had discussed this before the battle—who would bear the gauntlet and set the universe back to rights. 3490 Steve had once wielded it—though he’d been a little tight-lipped about the experience—and everyone, 3490 and ‘MCU’ alike—agreed that 199999 Steve should do the honors this time around.
she was doing this? You heard the doctor, he said this is probably a repeat offense—how could we have missed this?” There was a long pause, and Tony could hear his own heartbeat, could feel his stomach sinking in horrible empathetic anticipation. He almost wanted to scream at his double,
“I—you—we haven’t seen you upstairs so, I just thought…I just thought, well, that you might not be eating. Or at least not well. So I figured I’d bring you something just in case,” Steve said, stumbling over himself just a bit. 3490 Tony continued to stare at him. “Not that—not that you aren’t perfectly capable of taking care of yourself. Because you are. Obviously—I just—”
“Yes, all good points,” Tony piped up, “but why, if they’re crazy evil schemers out to get us, would they
“Fine,” James said shortly. Clearly he didn’t want to talk. Steve wasn’t sure why he kept pushing, but he felt compelled to do it, compelled to help in some way.
“How could you keep this from me?” 3490 Steve asked. There was raw pain in that question, quieter now. Antonella looked so very lost.
, James thought again, and he laid flat on the ground and slid himself beneath the ancient, rusty machine so Johnson wouldn’t see him even from up high. James wrinkled his nose at the even stronger smell and tried not to think about why the machine was stained so red.
“Are you making up nicknames for your security detail? Tony, not everyone finds that endearing,” Pepper chastised him. Senator Stark just waved her off.
“Pain on a scale of one to ten is about eleven at the moment,” he said. “Pretty sure I burn through—“
.” Peter just shook his head, tears finally spilling out of his eyes and falling onto James’ clothes. If this were a Disney movie, Peter thought idly, his tears would heal his brother. James would get right back up and they would fight the AIM agents together. But this wasn’t a Disney movie.
“It’s not about right, Bruce. It’s about Universe Security. We won’t breach their privacy any more than we have to,” Tony said.
. He hardly heard the gasps and shrieks around him as he first shoved people and then drew attention to the armed woman. He had no choice but to take her down from her front, and she struggled as Steve pinned her arm to her own chest and began to wrench the gun from her grasp. But the woman was strong, stronger than Steve had anticipated, and for half a second she wrested her arm and the gun away from his grasp. He heard it go off, heard the crowd screaming, but his one and only focus was to disarm the woman, which he managed after a few more seconds, at which point Natasha showed up, a pair of handcuffs at the ready. Her face was white, which Steve didn’t understand. Natasha always kept a cooler head in a crisis than even he did—but that was when he noticed the blood. Natasha cuffed the woman, but there was blood on the floor. It took a minute for it to register with Steve, but he concluded that the only way there could be blood in that particular spot on the floor was if it came from
He didn’t know if he wanted to open it and take what he knew was inside. He had put it in a box for a reason, shoved it in a corner for a reason. But now he would be headed off to war. Maybe it was time to put some of the past behind him, to confront it and to move on. He took a breath and opened the box. He reached inside and pulled out the metal chain. The dog tags on the end clinked together.
next to them. He was older than their son, maybe by a decade or so. “Oh! And thanks, Tony—your jerry rigged portal in that gym was the only nearby portal in New York. Other one’s in Toronto. Really didn’t want to hoof it back here from Canada. You really didn’t have to do that in secret but your understandable paranoia sure came in handy for me.”
?” Kate asked. She stood, leaning her back on the kitchen counter, her arms crossed. “It’s like talking about my parents’ sex lives. Ugh.”
Conjuring his new super strength, Peter grasped the edge of the shelf on his leg. He took a breath and then lifted up, his back, shoulders, and abdomen all engaging, bringing it up. If he wasn’t so tired, it would be easy, but as it was, it was torture. And as he lifted, his leg only hurt more.

“Mmm,” Tony said. She was draped across his bare chest, happy to just snuggle against his warmth. Steve was always warm.
Gingerly, he shifted so that his good leg was beneath him. Slowly, he started to stand, but balancing on one leg was difficult; in a wobbly moment he balanced on his bad leg. He yelled in agony and fell back to the floor, hitting his tailbone on the concrete.
“Yeah,” he said, though it was barely audible. He followed the creature with his head and eyes for a moment as his parents (and, let’s be honest, everyone else in the room) watched him, baffled.
“Ready…” his mother’s voice sounded over the PA system. “Set…” Peter felt his heart in his throat as he stood across from Alt Natasha. This was, really, his first fight
There wasn’t much in the room, just a set of sofas, a coffee table, and a flat screen TV. James wasn’t sure it was a VIP room so much as the beginning of an apartment above the club. But all the background information left James as he noticed who was
“I’ve been promoted to Captain as well,” James continued, still standing. “I’ll be in charge of a fresh company going in.”
“James! Congratulations!” Tony said, smiling. “This calls for some bubbly, I think. Anyone want to help me get the champagne glasses? Oh thank you, Jane, Pepper—you too Kate, Peter, come on.”
“Can’t miss, Katie-Kate,” he said, pulling an arrow from his quiver. He nocked it and took aim as he spoke. “I’m on a team with super-humans. And one god, in case you’ve forgotten. I gave up a lot for this life. Bobbie and I could have had a good, simple life. But we wanted to play with the big boys. And if I miss, it means I’m just another dude with a bow. It means I’ve been fooling myself this whole time. And that’s why I never miss.” The arrow flew, splitting the one he’d let fly just before it as it hit the exact same mark. Kate looked down at her own little bow, shiny and black.
have been the obvious choice to fend off the Hulk. The difficult one was Alt Tony—no one used tech to fight at Avengers Academy. They all had powers. Aside from Francis, who was an odd exception. Well, except for Juston and Sentinel, but they were also weird exception. And except for Adam, who
“It’s not the first time she’s caused us a bit of trouble,” Tony said. She drummed her fingers on her desk. “Watch her. I want a full report and then your professional opinion on what should be done with her.”
“Thank you,” James said sincerely, then grabbed Francis, heading upstairs. Francis followed him, looking worried, more worried than James was. “Hey man, take it easy, we’ll find her. She’s probably just making out with that Tudo dude, no big deal—”
Katie. I really am. For everything.” He left, James’ eyes following him the whole way. When he was gone, Kate buried her head back in the pillow. She felt her brother sit down on the bed beside her. He put a hand on her shoulder blade. She was crying, but she didn’t want to stop.
did? You knew what it was like when you jumped out of an airplane in dance tights with a prop shield and six weeks of basic behind you?” James challenged. “I’d say I’m better prepared than that.” He’d dropped the sirs all together now. It didn’t escape Steve’s notice. But even if he intended it as an insult, Steve preferred it. They could speak as father and son, not as Commander and Captain. Steve sighed in resignation. He stood and put a hand on James’ shoulder. James looked surprised to see it there.
“I NEED MEDICAL!” James screamed, but he knew he might as well be screaming in space. No one could hear him. Anyone who could hear him couldn’t help. He turned his attention back to the man, horrified to find him slumped over, consciousness lost. He put his hands on his shoulders. “No, no, no, dude, c’mon, stay with me, man.” He moved his hands to the man’s thigh, squeezing down hard to try to stem the bleeding more than he could do with a tourniquet.
“DEAD!” Francis shouted from his place in the trees above, though Peter still couldn’t see him. Moments later though, he heard Francis groan.
He didn’t know how long he’d been down there. It felt like hours that he squatted behind that car, putting pressure on this man’s wound, but it was probably only a few, agonizing minutes. Eventually James realized the man wasn’t breathing anymore. Shocked, he pulled his red hands away. The man was young, with a scruffy brown beard, a skinny scarf and fashionable clothes. On any other day, James would have called him a hipster. But at that moment, he could think of nothing but the fact that he must have only been a few years older than himself, that he’d likely been enjoying a Christmas party at one of the businesses or apartments nearby, that he’d never expected to get shot in the leg and bleed out on Christmas Eve.
. But could Tony be sure? Could any of them be sure? Or would they fight alongside them only to turn on them at the end? Why had they shown up? Why hadn’t they stayed where Tony had left them? Why did they have to get involved, why did her heart have to beat like it was about to jump out of her chest or explode, why did they have to be such
(Tony might have been freaking out a little at that point) and out of the way as the lightbulbs in the street lamps above them exploded, sending shards of glass to the ground below.

leave him alone with not just the Red Skull but also a handful of Hydra goons. Fortunately, none of them seemed much inclined to shoot at him when he was in such close quarters with the Red Skull, but he did see them running towards him, ready to try and overwhelm his position. Or maybe just trying to avoid the collapsing hall. It was speeding up in its decay now, rushing towards them at the back of the hall at an alarming rate. Before Steve had to worry much, though, about the agents about to set upon him, Iron Man swooped back in through the window and hit them with is repulsers, taking them out one by one before landing next to him.
“I could have just knocked him over,” Peter said, tears stuck behind his eyes and a lump in his throat. “I could have just knocked him over and then stuck him to the ground with web. He didn’t have to die. But I killed him.” MCU Steve put a hand on his shoulder again.
“What do you mean, ‘why’? You’re my stepson, that’s why. You’re family, that’s why. You’re a good kid, and you’re about to go to war and get shot at, that’s why,” Tony said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “It’s Christmas, did you forget? Merry Christmas, Jamie.” James didn’t know what to do. He felt lost. He had nothing to say. So he just didn’t say anything. He threw his arms around his stepmother and gave her a hug instead.
Steve sat outside the door to Tony’s bedroom, drawing. (Wisely, Steve had put headphones on. The cheap earbuds he usually used had proved unsatisfactory and so he’d finally broken down and bought noise-canceling headphones, having been reassured by JARVIS that the AI would alert him if anything
“Had to give you a proper send off,” she said, stepping lightly out of his arms. “Closure and all that. Now go make friends and forget about this.”
“FALL BACK!” Kate heard her older brother scream. “GROUND CREW FALL BACK, AERIAL SUPPORT GET TO THE NORTH!” Kate started backing up, her eyes ascending upward—what could possibly happen to get her brother to tell them to back off. She squinted. Was that…was that the ball dropping? The New Years ball? It was big and shiny and in the right spot but—
“My political preferences have nothing to do with the way I conduct my job,” Steve said. Stark grinned.
Natasha Romanoff was thoroughly uncomfortable and had been so for months on end. She had never been so uncomfortable, however, as when they were all shoved in that godforsaken underground bunker. At least here they had more access to entrances and exits. Of course, that meant more places to guard, but it was a relief to the assassin to have multiple escape routes, especially given their situation. Natasha trusted 3490 about as far as she could throw them. It was pretty clear that they didn’t mean them any harm, but she had no doubt in her mind that if it came down to the safety of them and their families versus the safety of 199999, they would choose their own safety. She couldn’t blame them for that, but it didn’t exactly instill confidence. But at least, now, they were freely sharing information. Usually Natasha would assume they were holding something back, but she didn’t think the Commander had the energy to lie or withhold information without making it obvious that he was doing so. Steve had never been a good liar, and his grief only made him worse.
“Can’t,” Peter choked out. James stopped pushing at his hands and instead put his own over them, grabbing onto him with a gentle pressure.
It was Saturday of their first week when the 199999 had their first truly formal meeting. 3490 Tony was in her lab, 3490 Steve was spending the day with James, Peter, and Kate in the city, and so the house was empty aside from the 199999 Avengers and company. So they sat in the dining room, at the long wooden table, treating their meeting more like a conference than a haphazard get together.
“I guess,” Tony relented, but she didn’t sound pleased about it. “I’ll apologize to the alts later. None of them are hurt?”
“Then what was the point?” Bruce asked, frowning. “If they know we’d be after our files, they must have planted them there.”
They were getting overwhelmed. It was an attack from all sides, and it was big. The Sinister Six were nothing to sneeze at, and you add some doombots in from an unrelated mission in which they had somehow managed to piss off Doctor Doom, and it was a recipe for disaster. They would handle it. Tony knew that they would handle it. But it was still a struggle.

They arrived downtown pretty quickly, comparatively. Kate led them through the streets of Manhattan until they happened upon a single steel door with a bouncer stationed outside. There was no line. Kate pulled out three blue-and-purple laminated tickets. The bouncer just gave one nod and opened the door. The music of the club exploded outside. It had a strong beat, but it wasn’t any song James recognized. They wandered inside, standing on what appeared to be a catwalk above a basement level. The people in the basement were packed pretty tightly, dancing and grinding and all together making an interesting scene—one person was scaly, another kept changing her hair color, one kept lighting the air above him on fire. It was definitely a mutant club. There were stairs to the dance floor below, but also stairs to an upper level. James could see a bar and some more relaxed seating, but not many people appeared to be taking advantage of the plush leather seats. Nevertheless, that was where Kate headed first. James and Francis followed—might as well start with a drink or two. James wouldn’t feel the effects, but he could go for a beer anyway.

He could still remember the sound of the man’s neck snapping as he’d accidentally webbed him in the back of the head and pulled, intending to knock him over; could still see the shock on his face as he fell backwards and his helmet fell off. He could still see those eyes—hazel eyes—staring up at the sky, lifeless, still surprised. In fact, Peter felt

Hydra,” Steve let everyone know. “You get hit with one of those guns and you’re toast. Don’t let them catch you off guard.”
“Yeah, I know,” Francis said. “I just wish she wasn’t pissed at me over it. Whatever. Laters Cap.” Francis flipped him a peace sign and took off, but not after Kate. Steve figured letting her cool off was also a wise decision. Steve headed down the hall, still followed by echoes of ABBA, his mind wandering to a musical laugh and a scrub brush microphone.
“Do you know what it is, Director?” Agent Matthews inquired. Tony just sighed. She took another sip of coffee. She could see herself reflected in the glass of Matthews’ monitor. Her long, wavy hair was down, as it rarely was. Her last hair tie had fallen off and she had been too lazy to get a replacement. Or maybe she had been too busy. She couldn’t remember, but it didn’t really matter. The point was, she even
It was too much for her to process, and her brain could process a lot. But the possibilities reeled in her mind. Herself as a man? That was easy enough to imagine. But life without Steve? She could hardly bear the thought. He’d only been off the ice just two years and it was
“The swelling’s going to be a bitch on that if you don’t ice it,” Tony pointed out. Peter turned around and nearly stumbled backward in his surprise, almost tripping on a stack of books on the ground. His room was littered with books. Books, comics, and little gadgets probably of his own design. It was extraordinarily messy, the kind of messy Tony’s own mother would have boxed his ears for.
As if electrified, she practically climbed over an open-mouthed Jamie to sprint to Tony at the back of the church. Tony met her with open arms and Kate threw herself into them, flinging her own arms around her and Steve just stood there, frozen. He felt like time had stopped. Nothing made sense. Nothing made sense, and his sons both got up, more slowly, stumbling almost, rushing to her and adding to the group hug. More people were standing, but staying respectfully back. There were tears. There were cheers. And Steve wondered if he’d just lost his whole goddamn mind. Was this some kind of hallucination?
operate the suit very well like this. And considering she had a new team of Avengers who might or might not be hostile, that wasn’t a particularly great situation.
in my bathroom?” Kate asked. Peter ignored her and went back to throwing the ball at the ceiling. Kate bristled. She didn’t like being ignored.
“Swap out kids!” she said, and Blue Team retired to the viewing area. Peter took a seat as the fight began; he would go to the nurse after round two to fix his arm. He was surprised to find that some of the Avengers Academy kids who
One right, two lefts, another right and he was there—and ran straight into 3490 Steve, who was leaning casually against the wall next to the lock. He saw Tony and one side of his mouth curled upwards.
“It doesn’t matter. And anyway I have about a million and six things that I need to discuss with you—” Pepper said, launching into that very discussion. Natasha, who was assigned to the dayshift, took the elevator down. Steve waited politely next to the elevator, hands clasped behind his back. Neither Pepper nor Senator Stark paid him any mind, which was how Steve was used to things being. It was more comfortable that way. But about an hour later, Senator Stark looked over and stopped talking.

“Fine, news reel doppelganger goes on the long list of our possibilities,” Natasha’s double spoke. “It doesn’t change that we know nothing for certain in that area. However. We do think we’ve found someone who might. Nick Fury—he went underground after the incident with Latveria. We assumed it was due to the incident itself but one the agents we got to blab mentioned that a Nick Fury had been a pain in their ass in June—long before you all and your Nick showed up.”
a kicked puppy dog face.” Natasha just raised an eyebrow. Steve knew he was blushing, so he looked away, back out towards the party. He could see Tony slowly slipping away from the crowd, heading out onto the balcony. No one else seemed to notice. “I should go—” Steve made his way through the hoard, doing his best to ignore the reporters on the large screen televisions, all speculating and making predictions. He headed out onto the balcony. It was freezing cold outside, and every breath Steve exhaled came out in a cloud. Tony was the only one out there, with both forearms resting on the railing as he looked out at the skyline. Steve joined him there.
“Big genius brain,” Tony grumbled, still unhappy about the lack of progress. He wondered if he could convince Peter to steal some files from his mother for him. Surely,

a story we wanted to relive, not a story we wanted to even admit ever happened in the first place,” Dad said. He pulled up one of the kitchen chairs to sit on, and that’s when Peter knew they were in for a very long story.
“No. And this one’s going to be a tough one for you to swallow, Peter, so I want you to listen carefully:
“Hey. Take it easy. The kid’s going to be fine,” Steve reassured him. Peter had popped in earlier to let them know that James had woken up. Tony had been pretty horrified to see James in that tunnel in the state he was. He was almost surprised that he was alive.
“Too much detail about your sex life, Kate. I like to pretend you and your boyfriends just hold hands and look at each other with gooey expressions,” Peter said. Kate rolled her eyes.
“JARVIS monitor subjects SR, TS, JF, T, CB, NR, PP, MH, and PC dash 199999 for signs of deceit,” 3490 Steve said.
“Tasha,” Clint spoke softly. She was wound tight, and Clint had no idea how to unwind her. It had been bad from the start, but Clint knew that it had gotten worse after her mission to the Triskelion five days ago. Seeing her double had shaken her up, even if she wouldn’t tell him that. He couldn’t blame her—it was
It was a lucky break, finding Peter. Kate didn’t think she could take any more personal disasters. But as they made their way to one of the ambulances on the scene, Kate looked over to where her father was standing. Uncle Bucky had a hand on his shoulder, but her dad wasn’t paying any attention to him. He was still staring at nothing, expression far, far away.
,” he could hear her oddly muted shouting though the glass. It almost sounded like she was underwater. Thoroughly cowed by her anger, Peter crawled back to the balcony and hopped back over the sides. He walked back inside, only to find his outraged mother barreling towards him. “WHAT IN THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING? YOU COULD’VE FALLEN AND KILLED YOURSELF I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD EVER BE SO RECKLESS ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME AND YOUR FATHER A HEART ATTACK?”
“We’re working on a couple of solutions,” Dr. Richards said. “But it’s—it’s harder without Tony and—uh, no offense, uh,

fault, that much was clear. Even if it wasn’t something they’d done, even if it wasn’t something they’d knowingly been party to, it was obvious that the weird AIM agents had been after MCU Steve. Somebody wanted him, and they were willing to tear 3490 apart to get him. James stood in the doorway as they approached. Alts. It was
“So I keep thinking,” her double said abruptly, immediately doing away with any pretense that he was there to watch the news, “about that conversation we had.”
“I think you did.” They hadn’t talked, really, since Steve had taken off at the Triskelion. Steve had run away, red-faced and not believing that he’d really let slip what he had to “get coffee”. Of course, he really had gotten coffee, but he took his sweet time with it, and by the time he was finished the others had arrived in the conference room to discuss their new arrangements. Steve hadn’t
you and what have you done with Steve Rogers?” Tony demanded, rolling his eyes too as Steve got up from his seat and grabbed his bag.
The mansion was still the way that Tony had left it, architecturally, except with one exception—the door to his father’s old workshop now had a complicated lock on the door. Tony knew this from having passed by it on the way to the kitchen and having seen the clear tablet next to the door, much like the ones he had at home in Malibu.
been alone too long.” Steve Rogers noted somewhere in the back of his brain that staring so intensely at the man he was sworn to protect probably violated some ethical code somewhere, but he no longer cared. Something seemed to dawn on Tony then, and that look he’d had magically changed as something finally clicked into place.
“We had a situation with 525 Hulk. We still have a situation with 525 Hulk, but we just realized that our comms had gotten cut off and this wasn’t just an accidental hulk-out. Man am I glad I thought to check on you guys—“
love you, James. I love you more than you’ll ever understand. I’m so proud of you James. I’m so proud of everything you’ve accomplished, and you’ve done it all on your own. I just—I wanted you to know that. And thank you. For saving your brother’s life.”
“That wouldn’t be possible for us,” Other Tony explained. “I didn’t invent the suit until a few years ago. Bruce didn’t Hulk out until around then either, and Thor wasn’t Earth-bound until after all that. I guess Widow and Hawkeye have always been out doing their thing, but Cap was a Capsicle until recently. There was no team to put together.” None of them seemed disturbed by this, but the thought turned Tony’s stomach.
Tony, for one, loved spending time in the lab with the Other Tony. They tinkered with the armors together. 525 showed her the very basics of his armor, and she was horrified and fascinated to see it come up from his skin, stored in the hollows of his bones in carbon nanotubes.
Clint hoped so. He glanced at his double. His wife was laughing at something he’d said. 3490 him was obviously captivated by her. Four kids. Clint couldn’t believe that until he saw them together. He felt a gentle hand on his knee. He met Natasha’s eyes, grateful for the anchor. They would have to be each other’s anchors for the time being. With nothing else to guide them, they would have to do. It wouldn’t be the first time.
