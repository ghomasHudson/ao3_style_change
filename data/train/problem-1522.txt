His hoodie was almost sparkingly clean: well, Billy was a dab hand at chemistry. Unquestionably this more banal, literal sort of laundering was a ‘moral’, or at least legal, improvement upon his previous endeavours. A new, positive influence, then. To which end…
John was looking at him unguardedly, his mouth a small flat line, his eyebrows bowed upwards — almost sad. After a moment of staring at each other, John came back, leaned forward, gathering both of Sherlock’s hands flat to his own sternum before placing his other hand along Sherlock’s jaw. (John’s touch: always stable, sure, grounding.)

he been thinking. It was a miracle the man was able to dress himself at times).) Scenario B required one of them — namely, himself — to impersonate an expert in 16th-century etchings (he was sure Mycroft could find a spare Bruegel or, in a pinch, a Corot, to use as bait), who then either managed to take Gruener into his confidence — a long-con; undesirable, though more likely to yield the book if they could get the fool to
He rolled his eyes behind closed lids: she really ought to come up with something less transparently fake as an objection. (He found it difficult to continue holding hands with anyone who was not John. Nobody else’s hands fit properly.)
The dots disappeared. Then reappeared.
‘“Not your area” how?’
Again the aromatic tang of John’s sweat on his skin clobbered him like a plank to the head – a comparison both of them were qualified to draw – and without thinking, Sherlock bent nearly in half and licked John’s navel.
, but god, it was true. The way he’d survived all the shitty three-night-stands he’d called girlfriends had been because he’d had Sherlock to come home to. Paris with Mary had been a disaster not because of her driving or his rubbish French or even the fact that, as it turned out, she’d secretly been a casual-hours gun-for-hire. From day one, leaving his bedsit, even when he and Sherlock had fought or hurt each other or pretended it was anything but what it was… He made himself say it. ‘The only thing I need, not to be lonely for the rest of my mad, screwed up life – is you.’
He snorted. ‘Ten hours of Wagner? Bit of Philip Glass?’

With some reluctance, he settled back into his chair and closed his eyes. ‘The facts. In
‘I think she likes you,’ John said pleasantly, standing back to admire the view. He began patting his pockets exaggeratedly. ‘Now if only I had my camera…’
One more (short) chapter and then...
‘The collection of the three most recent conquests Baron Gruener committed to record, each with microfilm captions narrating relevant data and… testimony.’
But Harry didn’t need to know any of that, least of all about the row he and Sherlock had had about Mary (or the rest of it) only last night. ‘And she didn’t leave, we just… went separate our ways, is all.’ He cleared his throat and straightened his serviette. ‘It hadn’t been working out for a while.’
With a snort deep in his chest, Sherlock shifted dutifully onto his back. ‘Happy?’
He couldn’t – If they didn’t go home now, wrap themselves in the certainty of Baker Street and all it held, its strange and vital power… Sherlock refused to go to the hospital, its stringent separation: no. John was his doctor until such time as he renounced the role, and not a
To which end: yes, I've added a final chapter count. May change but... we're nearing the end. Hold your breath.
‘A reasonably clever deception,’ Mycroft was admitting, lowering the gruesome pornographic toy, so uninteresting that Sherlock considering storming away.
His phone buzzed, and he glowered.
Looking up at him, seated cross-legged on the floor like a boy, Sherlock was clearly trying to follow through on his earlier promise: to keep him in the loop.
, with that fractional margin reserved for the moment when he succeeded in saying it out loud to Sherlock’s face and thus caused it to be completely, whole-heartedly true.
, and so Sherlock opened it, the thick stiffness of new pages sticking together. It took him a moment to get to right page.
Bundled up, hair brush-dyed a further shade toward chestnut (and combed in a quiff over his right temple), absurd moustache on his upper lip, even more absurd (somehow) hat perched over his brows: John, beneath all these disguises, was still John. His eyes, even reversed in his reflection like a photographic negative, were still creased, still darkest blue and familiar, a tunnel with the faintest, surest pinprick of light shining through.
‘Yeah,’ panted Christopher. ‘I’m — in the dining room. Cabinet. Help yourself.’
Colonel Sir James Damery was the kind of man whom John would have met often in military training institutions and seldom on the field of battle. He was, obviously, a wealthy, high-ranking (semi-retired) bureaucrat — the eminently transposable kind that sat behind desks in government, armies, corporations, news conglomerates, and the better organised of the criminal world. (Not that the latter was at all mutually exclusive the any of the formers.) After a lifetime of service to queen and country, Damery was the intimate acquaintance of a number of peers, foreign diplomats, and evidently, private individuals of he sort that didn’t have to rent their diamonds: of great means and little actual importance to the world.
,’ sighed Sherlock with despair. Even Mycroft could admit the obvious carelessness of his entire staff of morons overlooking
‘Er… well…’ Bradstreet cleared his throat. John, still stunned, saw his own sense of bewilderment splashed across the inspector’s face. ‘I… suppose we should take you in for questioning.’
‘You…’ John sighed, then finished, lamely, ‘you might have cut yourself.’
Except then Sherlock snored again, and he realised, it probably wasn’t the thunder.
‘You are a monster,’ she repeated, ‘you’re
, underneath. And somehow they seem like they’re gonna swallow you up, like a black hole. And no matter how hard you try, it’s like when somebody’s holding both your hands, and you pull and you pull but you can’t get away — only it’s just in those ten seconds between the person asking you a question and those dark, flat eyes almost telling you you’ve got no choice at all but to give up?
He had almost asked, for the first time in his life, for them to turn the volume of the EKG monitor on.
Sherlock had explained, in his somehow simultaneously blunt and roundabout way, the basics of the plan, and John had mentioned (because, he felt, it was irresponsible not to) the probable toll this would have on her — and them all, to some extent — down the line.
Sherlock’s eyes fell on a miniature, in oils most likely, of a female figure reclining over the side of a bed, displayed for the beholder; in her bared breast was lodged an arrow (artistic license? In a real woman, that high in the chest, she would have seen the shot; almost certainly fatal), clinging to the arrow where it entered her body and lying across her abdomen was a — was he? — peculiarly smirking infant. Looming over them all, holding up one finger in admonishment while, with its other hand, either removing or (more probable) forcing the arrow deeper into the woman’s chest, was a skeleton encased in sinuous, transparent skin.
‘Swings and roundabouts with you,’ John murmured, voice heavy.
‘See?’ John agreed, looking back at Mrs. Hudson. ‘
But then Sherlock flips over, rolling to face John, and his mouth is a little less downturned, his eyes a little less defeated. John slides a hand to tug slightly at Sherlock’s mossy green shirtfront, his other arm going beneath Sherlock’s neck for him to rest on.
As he worked, he tried not to think about what was going to happen if Harry kept down this same road, a road she was apparently inhabiting at that very moment, hence her ignoring his many calls telling her she was running out of time to make her peace with the old man who’d made both their lives a mess since the beginning. He didn’t expect her to ring back, and wasn’t disappointed.
‘Dance, get down! Blame it on the boogie!’ Flint added, spreading her wings and flicking her shock-red tail in a surprisingly agile parody of a kick-line.
‘So, shall we get out our diaries or —‘
‘I find that my physical reactions towards you are seldom, in retrospect, what I would call “wise choices”…’
So he stayed, hating Neville St Clair for wedging into what he had been working tirelessly for four months (and before that, two years, and before that, a lifetime) to build between them.
Screw that,

He nodded. ‘That will show me to admit such a man to my shop again.’

‘I know.’
Somehow, the work of art — was it art, or a devotional service? a requirement of their nocturnal ritual? (were those mutually exclusive? His religious education felt several lifetimes old, and pretty comprehensively deleted) — hastened his resolution to leave. His presence here (his presence, he though morosely, anywhere) was a danger to them, even if their isolated and famously pacifist location provided some degree of protection. A few solid meals, perhaps a few medical supplies, and a few hours to arrange his thoughts into a proper plan (including how to get word to his brother via the deceptively well-connected head of the monastery) and he would be on his way.
Of course Sherlock had sprung to his feet, no doubt aching from doing so but too stubborn show it, and was glaring, backlit by the front window in its waning grey light. ‘We
Which John was fine with. Mostly. He hadn’t been

) was itself a misnomer. Sherlock was the least companionable person he knew: he was seldom willing to tag along, to listen disinterestedly, to give those little pre-packaged words of comfort and reassurance and inspiration which other people sought from their
‘Be fair, a four, at least.’ He examined in near-microscopic detail the bridge of John’s nose, the creases around his (wet) upturned mouth. ‘And I won’t be wearing a cape, for god’s sake.’
‘It’s… it’s early days, Haz,’ he deferred. ‘But the second it’s wrapped up, I’ll send you my draft. First peek. Promise.’
Sherlock was regarding at her as though she was blathering in tongues.
When finally John interrupted the tainted silence of the room, he tried to draw on every comforting experience and every ounce of faith in Sherlock and Mycroft, the whole bloody Met, his own Sig if necessary, to get through to her. ‘Suze. We are going to find this
,’ Sherlock purred, almost ravenous, and Christ if that wasn’t something that would always go straight to his cock.
Brows drawn, Sherlock stood up, looming as he oh-so-enjoyed doing. ‘I was always intending to come back.’
(What? That was a phrase, surely — such sentences were hardly the organic stuff of his own imagination. His Mind Palace occasionally housed proverbs: the associations common in regular social conversation. Where had this one originated? Connie Price? The ‘Bloody Guardsman’ case? (And what had nearly killed that damned guardsman? John had been checking on the man’s recovery, and his former Major’s: perhaps, when this Gruener business was wrapped up, they could take another pass at solving it. He did so
Which all suggested that, even if he did not formally accept the assignment of Lord Damery, perhaps it was time to turn his full attention to the Austrian baron.

(Patently false: too many examples to bear enumeration.)
The down-turn of finality at the end of his sentence seemed to get across: she flickered a fleeting look of disappointment, then nodded, deflating a bit. ‘Ah well, no worries. I don’t normally…’ She nodded again, just once, then took the pen back. ‘Anyway — have a good one.’
, dangerously plastered, sobbing out a whole year without Sherlock into his cardigan (the one with the burn hole Sherlock had made grabbing a pathologist’s cigarette and tossing it over his shoulder) on his bedsit kitchen floor. He’d told Mary yes.
‘We’ll get this right, y’know,’ John eventually reassured him, on the belief, if nothing else, that saying it out loud might help them get there faster.
Then:
, as close an approximation as you do; hammering, really — when I came in. You were laughing to yourself as you wrote but you were worried momentarily when you looked at the top of my head: writing up the case, then. — The bump, incidentally, is
‘I know,’ he nodded quickly, because that was certainly true. But equally, it was clearly going to drive them both mental to swing between extremes of celibacy (or close to) and desperate quickies in the kitchen. ‘I just reckon it might be a good idea to work out a compromise. Only if you want. It just seems like it might resolve some… tension.’
Previous evidence had indicated that John had never participated either in short- or longer-term romantic/sexual relations with other men, beyond perhaps some rather drunken semi-serious homosocial antics during various army and university holidays, none of which had ventured beyond fumbling and all of which could have (and had) been laughed off. Furthermore, John had almost explicitly wondered at Sherlock’s own non-platonic history, though it seemed he doubted various enemy insinuations of total ignorance. As usual, John respected Sherlock’s privacy. (He little needed to know either about Victor or Mycroft’s erstwhile aid Alec.) But John had, enthusiastically it seemed, thrown himself into proceedings; had groaned and grunted, and petted and encouraged and
Sherlock had been, gaining disgruntled looks from fellow pedestrians. After getting his hunched bad shoulder shoved for a third, teeth-rattling time, John stopped and looked up properly for the first time since leaving the flat. The rapidly darkening street was jam-packed with blokes in nice shoes and lightweight macs and heavily-made up women in short sequined dresses and polka-dotted brollies. It was, he realised with bitter hilarity, somehow
John lifted his arm to allow Sherlock up, still watching the screen as he added, ‘On the bed.’

Holmes’s left arm draped across the back of the sofa, coaxing me to relax into it. ‘You were distracted.’

‘Oh! You’ve read my books: how flattering. How quick you are, Mister Holmes,’ grinned Gruener with glinting eyes.
‘We are
He and Harry weren’t close, really, in exactly the opposite way to how Mycroft and Sherlock ‘weren’t close’: the Holmes brothers were, in many ways, made of the same fundamental building blocks — pride, for one; intellect, they would both stress; distaste for letting outsiders in on their special, warped view of the world; drama queens, the pair of them… But however differently those parts were arranged, however much they were genuinely very different in what they wanted from their lives, from other people, from themselves, they were mostly on the same page, speaking the same (almost certainly coded, or Scandinavian) language. Listening to Harry always made him feel more than a bit guilty, and a little at sea, for not being able to tell when they had drifted from a same page. Whether they had ever been on one in the first place — if they were made of the same stuff at all?
’We’re not busy,’ John informed him.
(His body felt just one degree out of his control— it was already doing it — his hormones were firing at danger-response levels, awakening him to the familiar, exhilarating sensory blitz that was John — John, up-close, heart-rate slightly elevated, golden-brown coarse facial hair faintly (enticingly) visible along his jaw and flattened upper lip (making him look a full five years younger). Always his unconscious tic, John’s tongue had darted out three times in the course of this conversation (the first words they’d exchanged since the argument, unless one counted the hushed frantic broken obscenities of the episode in question: Sherlock didn’t).)
,’ John stressed again, in his stoniest voice, because he was a bleeding heart, a knight errant, the soldier who had never come home from the war but who
Sherlock immediately cycled through the potential reasons, but could not proceed without more information (before the data). Did he wish Sherlock would deduce the issue? Or was this truly about the book, and Sherlock had been both more right and more wrong than he had expected?
Turning to John, he felt the familiar rush of the pursuit of an interesting case suffusing through his system, interlaced with the inextinguishable hormone response to John’s battle-ready glint of camaraderie.
‘Bed,’ Sherlock instructed, flipping off the light switch and looking down at him in the dark with all the looming silhouette of a massive heron glaring down at a fish.
He waits, patiently, watching his index finger carving tiny circles into the smooth canvas of Sherlock’s back. Eventually he sees, almost hears, Sherlock open his eyes, and looks into the slants of them over the sharp jut of his shoulder.
‘Where did you find it?’ Sherlock barked, shaking away her now useless apologies. (The tap was running – John was, what? Not brushing his teeth – no – ah – splashing his neck with water – his customary sobering technique.)
‘I had hoped to arrive ahead of him, in order to give you some due warning…’ He cast a glance over the stack of semi-clean dishes, the rumpled afghan in a pool on the sofa, their bowed shelves stuffed with potentially useful paperwork, the very faint stench (where was that — ah, his laundry hamper: his week-old sodden socks) of proliferating mould, Sherlock’s cufflinks glinting where they had bounced on either side of the doorway last night. ‘Should you wish to prepare.’

(The fittings were new, as was the overly-innocuous CCTV camera, which rather gave it away if you were not a moron.)
). Yet John was nervous and
‘Thank you,’ John murmured, after Sherlock shivered leaned to kiss the hollow of John’s throat (minimally responsive — or was it?).

‘Harry.’
There was no one there.
‘Sherrrlock!’ croaked a voice in their living room, and John stopped on the threshold.
John grinned back. ‘A spectacle? I’d be happy to give you the preview here, if you’d prefer. And then I can recommend the resident who does the cleanest stitches.’
The one good thing about post-operative stitches in a proper hospital was, at least, that they’d done a good job putting them in the first time. Took them seriously and used the good stuff, rather than the glorified fence wire he’d sometimes been forced to use on the battlefield.
‘New policy, sir,’ she told him, somewhat apologetically. ‘You have to bring in your license and sign your statement, within the hour.’
‘What,
For a fraction of a second John froze, then looked at him. The lightning flash of hurt on his face made Sherlock reel with confusion: was that crumpled look in relation to Sherlock’s question, or Harry herself? He had advised John not to go to such a hollow gesture of an occasion (— they were the inverse of proverbial siblings, whose blood-ties were thinner than water; Harriet was entirely selfish, small-minded, loud and careless, incompetent, deluded, mercurial, ordinary: everything John was not. The wonder of genetics!). But now it occurred to him that perhaps the lunch had exceeded even his own expectations for distress and residual, guilty self-questioning.
‘Here,’ John said simply, thrusting the spherical fob ‘watch’ and matches they (well, Sherlock had) nicked out of Gruener’s pockets towards Mycroft.
‘Let me do that,’ he offered immediately, and the woman — seemingly only a fear years younger than his dad, her hair wiry flyaway and untidily going grey — hopped up to greet him in a kind murmur, cup of ice cubes still in her hand.
there,’ he noted, faintly amused, without opening his eyes.
‘We’re not out of the woods yet,’ concluded the attending physician in the morning, clacking closed his chart and replacing it at the foot of the bed. He smiled. It was meant to be encouraging. ‘But I’d say, once he’s awake, the worst thing you have to worry about is him pulling those stitches before he can start physical therapy.’
‘If I may interrupt this little reunion of sorts,’ cut in Gruener, and Sherlock, ignoring the warning bells of allowing Mary’s – whoever she was’s – gun out of his sight, glanced back at the artefacts along the walls for anything like a weapon he could use when the suitable moment arose. ‘Morstan, if you wouldn’t mind, this
The pitch black of Sherlock’s room as the door closed softly behind him was split only by the small window, catching the tangerine streetlight from the alley. John climbed into bed, his side, leaving space on the one-in-a-million chance Sherlock did miraculously decide to sleep, or… well, John was confident he wouldn’t get a repeat of last night any time soon after the row they had, but, then again, you never knew.
quite so much, especially lately. Their actions, by contrast, allowed them to communicate nonverbally (a mode that, in most people, he found unreadable, but in his fledgling relationship with John was fast becoming far more successful than mere speech: for so many things, there simply didn’t seem to be appropriate vocabulary or syntax). John had been angry that Sherlock had withheld information: fair, he could admit, when one took into account John’s personal, familial, and professional experiences. (Sherlock counted the 797 days of his absence heavily among those experiences.) And yet John had known, with the peculiar power he possessed to know Sherlock better than anyone ever had, that Sherlock was telling the truth to say he knew no more about AGRA. More than this, John — with the resilience of the
— If I’m not coming, then you’re not going. End of story.’
Sherlock tried to regulate his breathing as he realised, somewhat numbly, he was losing control of it. He could not stay here, have Bradstreet walk back in on Sherlock Holmes, the prodigal detective, having a meltdown in a stinking West-Central London overnight cell like a common drunk or prostitute. With numb fingers, he picked up his Belstaff – reclaimed from Molly’s flat after his third day back (she had, miraculously, had it dry-cleaned since he had last seen it, a gift for which he was still unspeakably grateful) – and pushed his arms into it. The buttons felt smooth and familiar but his hands trembled slightly with the fastenings. It took him approximately twenty extra seconds to secure them all properly. Had he not been on the verge of a minor nervous collapse, he would not have needed to approximate.
A few relatives had the decency to phone, but as soon as John — temper frayed, defeated and terse sounding, and shorn of any pretense of politeness or patience — gave them the prognosis, they started sending bouquets and condolence cards instead. The man
Months afterward, in an asphalt car parked, seedy motel south of Miami, shivering with the come-down of a cheap but sufficiently potent batch of cocaine, Sherlock reflected on the monk’s logic. Everything was transience. This high, like all the highs that had come before — that feeling of being nineteen, unplagued by the demands of his body, assured with every glance that people saw him, knew the brilliance of his mind and admired it, wanted to be in his company because he was interesting and witty and fun and capable and liberated from the confines of behaving by the standards so briskly touted by the college dons — the soaring, sated glow slid steadily downwards as it wore off… Everything wore off. He’d never loved anyone for more than ten minutes. A perfect piece of music thrilled in the air until the only thing tethering it to reality was wishful remembrance. John had moved out of Baker Street. Moriarty, even! Moriarty was dead and yet his puny, deadly empire was eroding whatever qualities in Sherlock that people like Molly Hooper and Lestrade and John considered valuable beyond his intellect… Everything was transience, even — especially! — sentiment, so the cocaine didn’t matter, the cigarettes didn’t matter, Redbeard didn't matter, his sickeningly idyllic childhood didn't matter, the cases he would never solve didn’t matter, the body in the warehouse was already decomposing into mere matter that didn’t, and Sherlock shivered, chuckling at his own joke, thinking bitterly of painted sand.
‘Three weeks!’ Sherlock burst in, because good lord, was this Mycroft’s idea of an insulting practical joke? ‘My cases frequently take a matter of hours, Sir James, not the better part of a month. It’s not as though he’s difficult to find: his home address was listed in the Sunday Telegraph, for god’s sake! Whatever incompetent —’
He seldom kept his resolutions when it came to John.
‘Did you have a nice time at the petting zoo, love bug?’ he asks as he climbs.
‘You…’ Sherlock began, not raising his head. No matter if this was an anniversary offering, it seemed important to be clear that he hadn’t meant (in this instance) to make a dramatic exit. ‘You didn’t have to leave.’
Sherlock was already close, he could tell, his hips were out of rhythm with the rest of his body and his breath was shot, his eyes screwed tight as he bit his lip, and John didn’t stop, wanted to see it, applied every fibre of his being into pushing Sherlock over the edge.
‘Next customer,’ called the woman at the till.
Based on his movements (or lack thereof), John was standing one storey above, much as Sherlock was doing now (i.e., still), though presumably not in precisely a spot tested to be invisible from any exterior angle even in daylight. A moment later, John’s floorboard whined, his door creaked, and then John’s footsteps were trampling down the stairs, across the kitchen (past Sherlock’s room, past his open door) and into the bathroom. A quick echoing yelp: ah, John’s eyes – well, all human eyes, for that matter – took roughly ten to fifteen minutes to adjust from darkness to illumination, based on the completeness of either environment. A guttural belch from the pipes downstairs signalled two seconds before the water sprayed the tile basin of the shower; another seventeen seconds before John (presumably stripped bare) stepped in.
and not telling her, because I can guarantee your brother will have by now, and if he hasn’t, I will. Besides, if you do…’ He licked his lips, and leaned dangerously closer to Sherlock,
until they were deep and wrinkled and softer still. Instead he held his position, breath suddenly trapped in his chest, while Sherlock looked beyond him, then answered, in a voice frayed at the edges but so familiar,
‘Blood loss.’
‘Confirmed that he had sold a Congolese African Grey yesterday evening and gave you the surname but not the address of his client,’ Sherlock finished.
‘Mr. Holmes,’ Damery acknowledged gravely, in the unmistakable marble-mouthed rumble of most British peers over the age of 60. ‘And Dr. Watson. How do you do.’
love to put together a good story, and Harry — for all her faults and rough edges — did, in fact, make a good audience once the case got rolling. But today, when he had left Sherlock at home, when right now he was out with a woman probably snapping secretive photos of Gruener’s numerous dens of iniquity on some gadget the size of a pen, plotting some imperfect plan to go after him in the middle of the champagne toasts, John wasn’t sure he could plausibly make this story end any way other than
There was a poem he hadn’t known he knew — though the title, the author had become detached from it along the way somewhere. He didn’t even know when or how he’d come to absorb even this much, whether he was remembering it rightly, in the right order with all the original words — but his own thoughts drifted far away, replaced with two lines on something like an endless, toneless repeat: ‘
Bloody hell, it had only been yesterday morning they’d been here, talking about…
He shifted, propping himself on one elbow, a scoot down along Sherlock’s side trying not to overthink the small fidgeting Sherlock was probably unconscious of doing. Sherlock’s ears, on the other hand, pricked up, catlike, at the
The sudden
‘ Suze snarled. ‘
‘Ovid isn’t for us, John, he is for Henry Baker.’ Sherlock set the new cage down on the partner’s desk, and unveiled the second parrot of the day to its temporary residence. He let drop the training treats and other various items he had impulsively bought in order to make the sale and get back to the flat with some shred of his sanity.
After seventeen thuds, the creak of the sofa and a whisper of Saville Row wool as his brother rose.
On that, certainly, they were in complete agreement.
Nevertheless, in spite of the forms and formalities, a shiver prickled across the nape of his neck which had little to do with the truly ghastly architecture, and much more to do with the audacity of Gruener showing off, without fear or shame, his salacious choice of home décor. If the one ‘sensitive’ picture Sherlock had managed to examine in detail before Gruener entered the room was anything to go by, the entire room was essentially a boastful exhibition of depravity.

He groaned.
, that’s a brilliant idea, I’ll go find her,’ and without waiting hurried off to do so.
‘Well, that’s one way to tell people,’ John muttered to himself.
He saw an insulted flicker bounce across Sherlock’s face before John had him pulled down, body pressed firmly between his own and the moulding, by planting one hand against the wall but keeping his mouth
John’s instincts were carrying him, helping him through the strangely wonderfully easy motions as he found himself pressed chest to chest with Sherlock while the violinist’s long hands crept cautiously under his cotton t-shirt, while his own hands worked Sherlock’s jacket off and his midnight blue button-up (black in the evening half-light of the sitting room) all the way open. He ran his fingers self-indulgently along Sherlock’s ribs, and felt him moan into his mouth.
John had nothing interesting to reply so didn’t.
Her expression turned instantly to ice. ‘What I do with my friends of an evening is simply none of your business. And for your information, Heinrich has instructed me to stop seeing the friends who were the worst influence, with their horrid drug habits. Heinrich wants the best for me.’
So the Hurdle of Proximity was, and ever had been, the biggest one for Sherlock, because few people had proved the adage better than he: that familiarity bred contempt. A small cadre of exceptions – Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, even quiet, awkward, resilient, impressive Molly Hooper – understood that, despite his usual distaste for being held, Sherlock up-close was an amazing sight to behold.
Eventually Sherlock, almost crossly, growled, ‘Come on, kiss me, you want to and you’ve been wanting to for
The dip of the bed behind him nudged his focus back to the lamp-lit room. (Basil, peanut sauce, chicken (all consumed); generic dish soap; foot/sweat/faintly damp cotton odour.)
‘Don’t mind him, Mrs Hudson,’ John called, mounting their seventeen steps with two armfuls of Sainsbury’s biscuits (the good ones: excellent) and a full restock of his medical supplies (less tempting, but no doubt necessary). ‘He’s out of practice with someone who actually listens to him complain.’

Most of the time, though, John sat with him. Spoke to him (almost exclusively about inconsequential or impersonal subjects). This made proceedings on the plan to destroy Gruener congeal to a viscid crawl.
‘Gruener is more likely to relax if he believes I am no longer a liability. Otherwise, he might insist they move up the wedding, which logically speaking he ought to have done ages ago. Fortunately Miss De Merville has more backbone than her successor.’
John groaned again.
Remembering suddenly, he cleared his throat to tell her about the publishing contract — the meeting he supposed he’d find time for next week — when she sniffed,
‘Is this to do with —’ Sherlock began, and then, at the last second, he vacillated — if John wanted this to be a surprise for some reason, Sherlock would either wait to find out or deduce it — so half-choked instead, ‘your book?’
The storm continued, rolling with the same billowing
Before he could lose his nerve, John said, as evenly as he could, ‘Thanks, by the way, for… for getting my shirts.’
‘Thanks,’ John blurted out automatically, and left Mr Ramani standing confused in the shadows.

, for you — or, I suppose, any other reason, though your safety is quite obviously of critical importance to me, so it would realistically only be you for whom I would consider such unilateral action and regret it. Anyway, that — I will no longer allow that, without giving you some… point of entry into the situation.’
John, who had gathered enough breath for a rant, was almost comically pulled up by this. ‘Er. Right. Okay. Well, that’s…’
Several things happened in a blur: a grunt from behind John made him take his eyes off Mary for a fraction of a second – this was Sherlock’s moment –  he leapt –
With Mary, of course, he’d never been anything but her boyfriend. The only times they’d slept in their own beds had been before they’d gotten serious. Within a few weeks, he’d effectively moved into hers, spending no time at his oppressive tin box of a flat. She’d gamely cleared out a nightstand (the right one, for no reason he could quite remember agreeing to), and the room had been — more so than with any previous parter — a couple’s bedroom. A snug, mostly uncluttered, shared space that smelled like both of them and told anyone who come round for dinner that they were a ‘them’: one bedroom, theirs.
Considering the gaggle of medical personnel, 9-to-5 enervated office workers, and their respective, even more uncomfortable or undesirably outgoing partners (to say nothing of the crowd of pub-goers that would make such a large gathering possible without a reservation!) — it was indeed a foolish move.
A siren wheeled to life as the last but one of the black towncars rolled away, its police escort in tow, taking a dazed-looking Suze away from here. Sherlock drank him in, stowing every detail in reserve: face uncovered, John stared into the distance with the look of a man who hadn’t slept in a year, but also like he was reaching the tipping point after which he was on track to punch a vicar as readily as a villain.

He had almost asked, for the first time in his life, for them to turn the volume of the EKG monitor on.
To his mild surprise, Billy laughed once. ‘Yeah, well, that’s all right then, innit? All them kiddies and people, everyone looking the other way. But some princess gets a scratch on her wrist or her pony looked at the wrong way and suddenly…’ He shrugged, sniffed.
Sherlock felt like he was emerging after having been shoved into a gastropod shell.  ‘A deduction.’
A clatter (a bar of soap bouncing in the tub) broke him from this reverie. He drew open his dresser and absently picked out his pyjamas.
‘I…’ This was, for some reason I could not then yet fathom, of some important to him: a matter of confusion; a misapprehension he wished not merely to correct, but to forestall repeating. ‘I suppose I did find his account of the unruly book, breaking free to interrupt the absorbed reader like an infant wresting free of its nurse, rather comical — but as much truth as humour in that.

And at least a hundred more times, I have seen you draping all manner of things, pipettes and your favourite magnifying glass, your own scarves — all sorts of objects! — over the haphazard

John nodded, taking this in, nodded and nodded and convulsed his fists around nothing and Sherlock couldn’t tell what his anger pertained to, whether he was glad not to be involved with her now or if it was regret over having touched her (loved her? Had he?) at all, if he felt the blood smear onto his hands from hers —
‘No, no, up you get, you daft scarecrow,’ he insisted, shifting to sit up and poking at Sherlock’s sides. ‘I’m not having you wake me up with your stomach grumbling in an hour just because you’re too lazy to eat now.’
This plan was (much closer to) ideal.
the morphine (and opiates generally) and onto a long-term regimen of non-narcotic pain relievers as soon as it was safe to do so — John went to look out the window. Sure enough, several storeys down on the pavement, a gaggle of reporters and camerapeople were chatting and smoking merrily, lenses and booms fixed in his general direction.
John’s mouth was pressing into his from the side, lips surrounding his while John’s tongue glanced hotly across his; John’s left hand was holding firmly the clammy skin at the back of his neck, while John’s other hand was placed agonisingly lightly beneath his jaw; John’s knees were bumping his knees, ankles brushing his ankles as John pressed himself into Sherlock, heavily, deliberately…

.) ‘Difficult spot for you to see, granted. And it’s faint, too. I’m not surprised you haven’t noticed. But it is there.’
Now John snorted. (Beneath that, though, his leg was buzzing slightly, a (nervous? distracted? psychosomatic?) habit he seldom exhibited (not for years, not since the very beginning).)
He exhaled slowly, and tried to make his body stop shaking. Slowly, as he sat there, rationalising the panic away with the dewy breeze of the rain chilling his back, he remembered how to breathe.
From this position, with Sherlock’s head curled under his shoulders, back bowed, John couldn’t see his expression — whether it was shock-blank, or grimaced with pain, or biting his lip, eyes bright and eager and unfocussed —
His mouth was a pursed line, but his brow had unknotted somewhat, so allowed myself a moment of indulgence.
‘We’re only been on the case since ten o’clock last night,’ Bradstreet retorted. ‘We’ll find it today. And I’ve had instructions from my chief to keep this as quiet as possible. Consolidate our people.’
‘I have been approached by a would-be patron of yours, one who had hoped to discuss a pressing matter with you both in the… relative privacy of Baker Street. If it’s not too much trouble.’
About halfway through his lunch break, he saw a familiar shape walked past and, unresolved curiosity getting the better of him, called, ‘Beth!’

John frowned and sent him a quick, sharp glance.
At which point he had arrived at the Second Hurdle: why bother. Sherlock was not naturally self-pitying. Nevertheless, particularly during and since his absence, he was forced to admit (even if just to himself) that he presented virtually
In an instant they were both scrambling, a tangle of legs, as John was pressed back into his pillows, Sherlock ruthlessly tearing away his robe and shoving it to one side so he could run his palms maddeningly up John’s thighs to curl just above where his own knees were now straddling John’s hipbones, while John kissed and kissed and kissed him as deeply as he could possibly manage while he tried to pull Sherlock out of his clothes.
The words were out of his mouth — Molly giggled and went on with setting up her laptop, so he assumed she hadn’t really thought anything of it, or anything more than a sarcastic turn of phrase — but Sherlock’s cheeks had gone very, very faintly pink, as had the dip of his jugular notch.
‘Yes, we do,’ John rumbled mulishly, using the absence of Sherlock’s mouth to get his fingers under the elastic band of his pants and tugged down.
— he took a full step back, enough to remove himself from the places they were touching — he felt genuinely as though he’d been doused with freezing water. The intense, bitter taste of unfairness of that remark stole any words — touched a nerve he thought he’d stopped protecting. Because it had been Sherlock who had clearly flirted with him earlier, just as hungry for it as John was himself, like the razor-sharp energy during the final movement of the concert when the orchestra was moving towards a climax and Sherlock had brushed his thumb along the inside of John’s knee, making him stifle a groan. They (

Breathing into John’s skin, Sherlock didn’t immediately pull his mouth away, though his smooth hands that had been sculpting along John’s sides were balled tensely.
The soft warm liquid electric reverberation — John’s lips and hard palate tasted of peat, fire, malt. Like smoked cherries and stream water. The strangeness — two skulls clacking together; two fleshy, porous cases around rattling skeletons that sweated and stank and rippled and peeled back, curdled meat, when applied with fire or water or air or metal instruments, to reveal only skeletons that couldn’t hold themselves together once the tendons were gone — Sherlock shoved past it,
‘And he’s still getting married tomorrow?’ Molly repeated from their debrief this morning.
‘Fuck, no,’ breathed Christopher, cheeks pink, ‘God — that’s fine — just — let’s find somewhere.’
‘I believe we have a visitor,’ Sherlock drawled, looking at their guests.
John opened the door for Molly, then raised his eyebrows, watching the would-be comic get into the backseat of a purring second vehicle. ‘“Eurus”?’
He felt out of breath, dissociated from the strangely stable voice who spoke from his mouth.

Quirking an elegant eyebrow in dismissal (the man had an unusually mobile yet opaque face, revealing very little apart from the mask he deliberately put forward), he shrugged and shut the box with a muted thunk.
‘Because you are a wreck right now, but Rosie is fine, and she’s fine because your first thought was as her father. She’s your daughter, too. And she loves you, in case you’re getting that at all mixed up in your big head. She’s mostly just wondering how soon she can throw herself at some large livestock when the closest we’ve got here is, well… I dunno—’
‘I… I don’t,’ John stuttered. Sherlock crept low and continued, with renewed fear pumping along his veins, because it was one thing for erratic and therefore dangerous Suze to invade, gun or other weapon in her hand, and very much another for AGRA alias ‘Mary Morstan’ to be standing in the flesh, in the middle of what had just become a hostage situation in full hitman (hitwoman) gear, smirking at them all.
They were sitting on the floor, dishes messily opened across the coffee table and wafting mouth-watering scents all through the flat. Sherlock, naturally, had eaten two fried dumplings, wiped his hands on a cloth napkin he produced from nowhere, and then went on comparing something from the book open on his knee to the laptop settled on the floor in front of him.

As ever, John’s mind leapt into action. (He would have made an excellent pirate.) Sherlock would, of course, far rather have John beside him for this venture than anyone else, but, for a variety of reasons he’d calculated during the night (difference in likelihood of being recognised together versus separately: considerable; John’s request for Sherlock to desist narrating to John his own feelings about such things as his fragrance preferences, his craving for danger; their rendezvous scheduled for the nuptial preparatory reception), he put his preference aside.
, all those other people were better off, and John knew in his bones that if this thing with Sherlock broke that they’d both have to live with the fact that there were future cases, future
So: it wasn’t that the little moments were unromantic. Little moments of comfort and affection were all too easy between them. Always had been. But this morning John hadn’t kissed Sherlock goodbye, hadn’t even thought about it until he was taking his jacket off at the surgery and spotted one of the nurses who occasionally flirted with him. He and Sherlock had been in some warped version of a relationship for years. He just wasn’t used to thinking of it like any other relationship he’d had.

John, revolver in hand and a smile to calm a hurricane on his face, looks lovingly down at him. ‘Mycroft, if you wouldn’t mind leaving us alone for a moment. I think Sherlock’s finding you a tad… unhelpful.’
John shut off the tap, dried his hands. ‘You were outside, according to the plan, apparently prepared to
(The problem was, his deductive faculty insisted, that Gruener had built a near-seamless sham in his outward mask as ‘gentleman collector’, one which enabled him to drag Violet subtly under his power with pitiable excuses for his past. The Austrian had — Sherlock knew without having to hear confirmation from John — preyed upon Violet’s natural coldness, her vanity and privilege, her addictive nature, her isolation… Nor was he, Sherlock, unaware of the irony threaded through Violet’s story — how could he be, he was socially impaired, not stupid. And Gruener, dark, cunning, arrogant, provided the rest of the mirror image: it was as though Irene (not

‘Take her out,’ Sherlock suggested. ‘And go on.’ (He was in no hurry to be alone with John, who was evidently trying to find a gentle way to confront Sherlock about the previous night’s turn of events; nor had he yet figured out how Ryder, who Catherine Cusack thought ‘too awkward and too dull’ to have stolen the jewel, had indeed done just that.)
He put the bow through its paces, springing indiscriminately from Shostakovich to Paganini to Chopin without stopping to acknowledge rests, line-breaks, or key changes.
Rushing, the door slammed behind him in the air vacuum of the draught — he winced guiltily as he marched towards the station, hoping it hadn’t woken Mrs Hudson. The peevish hope nevertheless rose in his mind that maybe Sherlock (who, for all his muttering about never needing sleep, staying up all night doing god knew what researching Ming vases or ancient porn or Austrian horse racing, had fallen asleep on the sofa instead of

John stood up — releasing a few imprisoned inner-benchers who quickly made for the bar or the lavatories, leaving a sudden gap in the seating — and made to move past him, but instead stopped short, shoulder to shoulder, facing the rest of the room. ‘What are you drinking?’
After an uneventful moment, however, Sherlock opened his eyes. John was gazing at him: a flood of information washed over him, a complex ocular data stream of depth and light and colour that, when perceived in the mind, was flipped (contralateral processing: not affected by spikes in adrenaline or dopamine, thankfully) and redirected and interpreted as shapes, sizes and scales, weight,

Though he no longer worried he might be sick, he tried to ignore the uncomfortable newly-woken sensation of hyperawareness of his limbs, of the ticking of his watch in the silent room, of his elevated core body temperature. He swallowed again and went downstairs without his phone. His hands felt paper-thin on the smooth banister.

on John’s face entered with him. As though at any given moment, he could feel the thrill of John’s confidence, his stability, like a reassuring hand at the small of his back, or a huff of a shared joke across a crime scene. Once, with Alec certainly, with Victor less consciously, the notion of a perpetual sensation of someone else’s hand touching him, prodding him, invading not only his physical but also (more importantly) his mental space, would have made him scream, shudder, shut down. Dive for cover (or cocaine). Now, like a revolution, like nearly everything John brought into his life, this inexplicable difference was simply a fact, not something to resolve or deconstruct, but simply acknowledge.
Since living at Baker Street, John hadn’t known what went on in Sherlock’s room when he stormed off mid-case, though he’d hovered near Sherlock’s door wondering, listening, waiting, often enough. Last night, he’d finally caught a glimpse of what happened on the other side.
‘You think Cusack was lying?’
‘Yes,’ trills Mycroft, in that same voice he used when Sherlock couldn’t pick up chemistry quick enough, or mixed up a word puzzle and spelled something incorrectly… ‘You always were so stupid. Such a disappointment.’
‘Could’ve been worse,’ he suggests.
Eep, more of that ratings nonsense.

His mind erupted with fresh questions all clamouring for primacy.
. And you think it’s best to just, what? Pop over for a quick peek at his sock drawer?’
— electric screech overhead mingled with the
Behind him he heard the glide of fabric, which meant Sherlock had probably buttoned his shirt back up a bit. Good. At least he’d read that correctly. Half-in, half-out of his clothes, and — yes, John found, turning to look at him darkly — Sherlock was glaring irritatedly at John: waiting as though
John laughed openly. ‘God, I feel so old, when people say stuff like that. I mean, it’s fine — as long as they know what they’re talking about, it’s none of my business. But I just keep thinking, my sister being gay was the biggest shock for the family in… I dunno, decades. And that was the only kind of “alternative lifestyle” anybody seemed to know about then, really. Definitely for my parents.’
A bell tolled somewhere in the distance — seven o’clock — and, rather than wait for Sherlock to push him away, he drew slowly apart. Sherlock cringed.
Preparing with his hands behind his back to more or less argue his way in, he nearly jumped when instead the heavy chrome door swung open to reveal a silken blonde-haired woman regarding him with a combination of mischief and disdain.
, I’m close already, Sherlock —
A low blow. Sherlock opened his eyes with a scowl to read his brother up and down: irritated, obviously (eyebrows recently brushed smooth after having been raked with frustration, seat uneasy despite John’s especially comfortable chair); had spent the morning in at least two — no, three — meetings (the stain of fine quality Assam, taken for appearances’ sake rather than an actual desire to consume such a quantity in the allotted time); exercise and sleep regimes unaltered. Mycroft simply being his usual, tedious, hateful self.
John could have kicked him; would have, too, had the man not also been on painkillers and blood thinners and less than a full night’s sleep in about a fortnight. (That last very nearly applied to John too, but… who was counting?)
Between Yard sergeants, Mycrofts, and landladies, they were apparently never going to be alone again for the rest of time.
‘And teaching a parrot to ask where the Acropolis is is the way to do that, yeah?’
‘I’ll give Mike your best,’ John offered, a tad sarcastically.
‘I know,’ Sherlock sighed, deliberately missing the point. ‘I have a list. Mycroft has a file.’
Sherlock blinked.
‘Ah!’ Mrs. Hudson cried suddenly, ‘my cinnamon buns!’ And she dashed off, no doubt – judging from the clatter a moment later of baking tins and her frustrated moan – to attempt to salvage another very ‘well-done’ baking foray.
(He usually made an effort not to interrupt, but for some reason the image of two polar opposites, fire and ice, who could easily have bumped shoulders (or at least elbows) on the way to the loo in a nightclub without knowing it, was impossible to picture against the backdrop of Violet’s pristine, manicured, sterilised flat.)
‘You should have trusted your wife.’
Under his thumb, the dry skin of Sherlock’s hand now had none of the angry blisters he’d had that day. And yet it was — he was —

‘As if she wasn’t looking out for her own skinny arse the whole time,’ muttered Harry into her glass. ‘Anyway, I’m looking for other jobs. On the quiet, you know, sniffing out my options.’ (He highly doubted Harry could do anything ‘on the quiet’. He really did need a cup of coffee, even more than the booze. Black, preferably.) ‘‘Bout time I really get my own thing going, I think! Development this time, maybe — it’s just a fancy name for going to massive parties and getting a bunch of billionaires to write checks they won’t even remember in the morning. Brilliant. Or entertainment. You know me,’ she gave him a 100-watt smile, ‘always said I should’ve had my own chat show.

‘You’re upset about the
‘Oh,’ she looked away awkwardly, almost physically incapable of discussing such vulgar matters as
Sherlock blinked.
He browsed, finding and bookmarking some old lines and pieces he’d loved as a kid, others he’d remembered years later when heart-pounding he’d whispered the words like a prayer after losing another kid to a stupid, brutal explosion he hadn’t even known to cover from, or heart-sore over some girl he’d barely gotten to know…
It really hadn’t been expensive enough to be serious, and he’d been very uncomfortably aware, when the attendant asked about ‘the lady’s taste’ and what would go with her birthstone (he was nearly sure her birthday was November the fifth… or twenty-fifth?), of how little he knew her. Worse had been the realisation, walking home very late one night from Mary’s, that he had been wondering how many miles the ring would travel, and how big a splash it’d make, if he simply chucked it in the Thames. Or better yet, he’d imagined, losing it on the way to work, getting mugged, having it involved in a great international inheritance fraud case, all of which ended in it being taken out of his hands, plus a little excitement besides. After that night he’d returned the ring, told Mary he’d phone soon, and begun thinking of ways he could break it off gently.
‘Yoohoo!’ called a voice, and John’s warm quirk of a smile escalated into positive fit of giggles — he caught Sherlock’s eye — oh, yes — the exotic dancing — yes, that was diverting, from a certain bleak, farcical standpoint — ‘Boys! Can one of you come sign for these before they get soaked?’

The funeral, the arrangements for which ought to have taken the better part of a week, was sorted almost without John knowing he’d done it. He was back to his unit with an hour to spare of his leave. He’d never told anyone about any of it.
Fortunately, it was his second full day of consciousness, so he was able to perceive the minute twinge of — emotion: discomfort, reluctance:

Thus, Sherlock and John found themselves on a rocky outcropping, shrouded in fog, very nearly freezing, looking out over the variegated, somewhat frozen moor of the Isle of…  well, whichever Inner or Outer Hebridean one Bill lived on for half the year.

What he’d been fantasising about only minutes ago. What he was hoping to get up to when he got home.

John fully expected Sherlock to launch into a well-rehearsed tirade against ‘good luck’ charms and other illogical and in every way idiotic superstitions, but was surprised to hear him ask instead, ‘Is there any possibility your husband stole the jewel for the insurance?’
‘Well… Sorry to have disturbed you, anyway. Let us know if you have anything further to report, eh?’
(Their whole evening, his hindbrain reminded him, had included the ridges of Sherlock’s fingerpads teasing behind his ear… –
‘I think there is,’ John agreed amiably, while Sherlock moved about the room. In former days, he would have enjoyed the pleasant sensation of flirting with a beautiful woman, one whose stilettos put her head about three inches above his and her budget at a digit longer. Her smile was the plastic, all-purpose variety common to people in her line of work – the frontline against salesman, paparazzi, and uninvited guests – but she was also young (he guessed about thirty? not much more) and confident. And blonde.
John’s mouth pressed forward onto his with almost no warning, unhesitating except with a soft sighing exhale in his nose as his hand found the back of Sherlock’s neck to tip him forward and a bit to his left, into John’s mouth. (John’s jaw, a prickle of idiomatic stubble. And he was warm — overwarm, hadn’t ever taken off his damp, humid coat.)

A celebration of this feeling, the warm hand that steered him away from the elbows and odours of every other obnoxious human (many of whom no doubt had been those sun lotion-lacquered bathers on benches and lawns throughout the city again today, and were now both slightly burned and moderately dehydrated: a charming combination), and simply kept him.
‘He… I never saw it. I tried once, and. Like I said, it didn’t make one bit of difference. And now little miss dim-witted twat thinks she knows better, just because she’s sitting pretty in her million-pound druggie flat —’
‘I’ll try not to take that personally,’ said a mirage of John with a smirk.

In an old comic book, a cloud-shaped bubble would have appeared over Sherlock’s head, with a petulant, ‘DRAT!’ As it was, he just scowled and ducked behind his phone.
Until Sherlock took a surprise turn that startled John out of his own head and his anger altogether:
Chest heaving, Christopher was still caught in a grimace of pleasure as John rose and, stumbling, made the (happily) correct guess as to the washroom for a spit and rinse of his mouth. He didn’t fancy the stomachache on top of what already promised to be a walloping hangover. Which reminded him —
The man was made of ice, there was no other way about it. (Sherlock had once thought himself the same. The reality, he discovered, was proof of the difference.) But if he had noticed Sherlock’s inner distress, he had elected –
‘That’s my

John sought confirmation. ‘You’ll be able to hear everything from a good distance?’
They stood in silence for a moment.
, and her mud-caked leggings, and of course her stuffed Peppa, she babbles about pigs and goats and unicorns and tigers, and at some point as John is momentarily out of the room to get her a glass of water, she falls asleep. He sets the cup on the end table near her head, then carefully pulls aside the short caps of her sleeves and double-checks, but it’s as he thought. Nothing.
‘The police also took Mr Boone to the station, Mr Ramani?’  Sherlock remarked, less menacing now.
They blinked at each other.
Seventeen steps; or, an epilogue.
, I see! I do beg your pardon!’ He stuck out his hand again, and shook first John’s and then Sherlock’s heartily. ‘I was entirely distracted in the chaos of my ordeal, I hardly thought of your being involved!’ (Talked like an academic though.) ‘You are quite right, my wife is Dr. Susan Baker. She specialises in avian intelligence projects, you know, and she has recently been considering investing in a parrot for a long-term project in human-bird communication. Ovid, yes, I see! Hello Ovid!’
‘Of course,’ Sherlock responded automatically. ‘But… the dog?’
‘Yeah, but… sorry, I just wasn’t expecting to hear you say it. Like… like this. Here. ’
John shut his eyes, trying to block out this latest assault on his worldview. A moment ago this had been mere idle, if peevish, curiosity, a last remaining disclosure to be made before they could truly invest in this relationship, without lingering doubts or ghosts to be settled. (But John still cared about her — a woman who might, at any moment, have shot him in the head — and this
‘Oh — were you still hungry?’
But, now that they had the carbuncle, things seemed illuminated by a chink of hope. John had been about to kiss him again; they had rediscovered the scent of the thief and recovered the item, which meant another (so far nominal, but surely presently complete) success in his professional history and before long the triumphant release of the innocent John Horner back to his boring, lumbering life; Sgt. Challa, for her appalling timing, was established as a new ally; and everything would be
The sudden lurch off the kerb shocked him. The sudden heavy slosh as his socks and trouser-hems soaked by the splash of the puddle he had landed in — not so shocking, in retrospect.

He blinked bovinely at them. ‘The effects? No, except as proof of my strange, rather sodden tale. But with my new friend Ovid here, I think I can let the past remain in the past. And now, I believe, I shall take my leave of you, and surprise Susan with a bottle of wine and our new family member.
‘You’ve made a historical study of gun laws in European cities in previous decades, have you?’
,’ and restarted the universe all over again.
, and I might take you up on that this year. Though really Molly is the one who gives the best presents.’
Sherlock’s eardrums were possibly about to explode. Had he cared less about the precious instrument in his hands, he would have hurled it to the floor. ‘You know me, John. I can never have a “bad day” when I spend it among junkies and vagrants.’
of their previous encounter.
— the henchwoman took a step towards him, forcing him to step back as though in a waltz —
John really could have kissed the smug look of smugness off his smug stupid face, but was spared the pleasure by the lift doors springing open.
Excellent, exactly the window he’d hoped for. ‘Are they short-staffed? What about Mary?’
John grinned. ‘Yeah, well, not sure he’ll be remembering that, the night he’s having. He wanted to make sure I told you.’
John leaned over again, sorry for the whine of pain that this elicited from Sherlock, but he needed to kiss him.
Sitting at his desk, he found himself doodling on his prescription pad between patients, thinking about Sherlock’s slip — ‘soldier’ for ‘sailor’ — and whether, in fact, there might be an opportunity once this case was finished to dig out his uniform. He could easily imagine it: Sherlock’s eyes gone round as dishplates, John commanding him to splay across the bed and get himself ready with a ‘yes sir’ or else receive due punishment (the exact nature of which they’d have to agree upon, but John was, er, up for anything).
,’ Sherlock intoned, dragging it out. He had in fact selected just the person. It was more a matter now of making John see the wisdom of his choice. ‘Someone often underestimated in their work, but who is entirely capable of defending herself —’
‘You’re important to us,’ he told her fiercely. If there was one incredible thing about people, it was their ability to fight if they thought they had someone or something to fight
He closed his eyes. Retraced his steps back through his mental fortress to the quiet, peaceful sanctum of this room: the carpet, the wallpaper, the clock, the slipper hanging over the mantelpiece, the tower of medical journals and old case notes stacked by the door, John’s chair across from his, the sound of his violin.
‘See?’ Mr Ramani said angrily, watching the proceedings. ‘There is nothing there. The police already took their pictures and left.’
‘Did you decide to start begging before or after you lost your job, Mr St Clair?’ he fumed. He felt, despite his recent humid resurrection of the suspect, unreasonably cold.
She slammed the door behind him.
, his blood chugged with each heartbeat.
Apparently this gesture was insufficient for such a (supposedly momentous) proposition.
‘He’ll live,’ John added, as if to remind them of the ultimate victory: the balance of justice meted. ‘He’ll live, and with this he’ll see trial.’
Molly shrugged nervously, as though in self-defence, so John gave an eye roll in Sherlock’s direction, then went back to trying, for the fourth time, to figure out the difference between engraving and etching.

) last couple of days to keep them a while. Instead, John gradually tipped them back out of the kiss, fingers still curled between two of Sherlock’s white fine dress-shirt buttons.
Exhaling, John threaded his fingers through Sherlock’s, examining the tangle of bare limbs. ‘Sherlock –’
She didn’t laugh, though of course, it wasn’t really a joke. ‘Perhaps you shouldn’t say that to Dr Watson?’ Challa paused. ‘You weren’t incredibly kind to him today.’
.’ John’s voice had gone viciously, frighteningly quiet. His jaw would ache later from how hard he was clamping it. Eventually, he frowned at Sherlock rather than at the floor. ‘And you would never have told me, would you? I mean, you went five months without saying anything so I suppose there’s my answer…’
The rest of things went more quickly than John would have liked, but as usual, they got carried away. He knew he was murmuring an endless chorus of endearments and reassurances into his skin (‘you’re incredible, you have no idea, god do that again, you’re a bloody genius, fuck, ugh, you feel amazing, you, Sherlock, god, do you have any idea, you bastard, I love you, fuck, please, Jesus,
Staring ahead as he walked, he saw a school group assemble on the grass as they listened in wrapt attention to a tall gangly man in a navy jumper, gesticulating energetically with his clipboard. Two boys at the back, though, were visibly not listening. One, taller, chubbier, was smirking and directing with a composer’s sweeping grandeur his short, fair, curly-haired friend, who was bounding in great loops around him, his own arms flapping as he raced and spun, clearly (in the spirit of child’s play the world over) trying evade as many raindrops as possible.
