“I’ll write to you from the base.” It felt as if the moment was slowly slipping away from them.
“Alright, it’s a plan.” There was a pause. “So are you looking forward to Hawaii? The tropical climate?”
Castiel smiled and gave Dean a shove, pushing him down onto his back, taking a place on top of him. He moved a leg between Dean’s, making them open to make room for himself. In a bedroom deep voice, he said, “This works for me...”
The men in the group all introduced themselves, names being of little consequence up until the last man spoke in a quiet, deep voice from the back. He was dressed in a different style uniform than the other men, but Dean couldn’t place what it meant at first.
“Yes,” Castiel agreed. Though he also liked the music, he took greater joy in watching Dean listen to it. There was something about the younger man that held Castiel captivated. It wasn’t just his fine features, the color of his eyes or the build of his body. It was the way he smiled, the way his eyes lit up, the way he moved. Dean was handsome, that was a fact, but what made him stand out -- what made him attractive -- was his personality. A song was just notes and words on a page until the musician gave it life and emotion gave it meaning. Dean was like music and Castiel could listen all day.
“Okay, truce. Look, no one’s around, you can talk freely. Tell me about the boy.”
Castiel laughed in recognition of their now-repeated “until then” line. Before even reading the letter from Anna, he grabbed a pen and some paper to reply to Dean. He never had much to say, but just getting word from Dean made him want to write back quickly. He hoped they didn’t lose touch over the war, because there was something about Dean that stuck with Castiel. There was something about the man that he didn’t want to lose.
There was only a moment’s hesitation before Cas reached out and picked up the receiver. He pressed his lips together as he waited for the operator to answer.
“Okay, okay, slow down there,” Bal interrupted his eager spec detailing. “I’m sure we’ll hear about it in the briefing.”
“I think blue might be my favorite color...” Dean said quietly and Cas smiled.
“I just remembered something I meant to ask you. It’s probably silly, but I wondered. You wrote in a letter once that you were an ass, but you never explained what you meant.”
“It’s been years since I’ve done this, Dean...” They sat on benches to lace the skates up and Castiel shook his head.
“I think I’d pass on that,” Dean chuckled.
“Yes, it has...” He nodded. “One wouldn’t think riding a train could be so tiring. However, with the change of the time zones... My body still thinks it’s an hour later than it is.”
“Sure, let me know if you need more help.” She smiled, then went back over to the counter to flip through a magazine.
“Not what? Not special? Not worthy? You are, Dean. You are astonishing, brilliant, dedicated, caring, sexy, and if you don’t kiss me--”
When Cas and Gabe returned to the flight deck, they saw others pilots scouting and testing their planes or taking turns coming in for a landing. The two of them probably wouldn’t go back up for the rest of the day, so they instead they watched their friends in the air. As planes landed, they helped get them out of the way and sometimes chatted about how the new planes handled.
A smile turned Cas’s lips up and smoothed out the creases in his brow. He looked up at Dean, clasped his hand around the dogtags and leaned in to kiss Dean softly. It wasn’t an answer, but Dean wasn’t going to argue, so he wound an arm around Castiel and returned that kiss.
“Well, a train then!” Dean mocked being flustered, but he wasn’t, really.
Cas had to stifle a laugh at Jo referring to Dean as ‘Dean-o’. Luckily, he and Anna often played the game of trying to make one another laugh at inappropriate times and he was quite good at holding such things in. “That’s a crying shame.”
He longed for a day when they could share a bed again, and smiled at the thought of visiting for Sam’s wedding. Though Dean made it sound very casual in the letters, even mentioning a girl, he was confident now that Dean missed him as well. Cas had his doubts at times, especially being away for so long, but his faith in Dean had become stronger. He only had to think of their last time together to remember the passion they shared. Or think back on the call they shared at Christmas, or look at the bottom of every letter, where Dean still signed each one, “Yours.”
“I don’t know, it depends... we would both need the time for it. I would like to.”
He didn’t know when it happened, but in that one kiss, he knew it was true. Castiel held their faces close and put all of the emotions related to that revelation into the kiss. It fed into Dean’s quietly boiling passion and he rolled his hips against Castiel’s, making the pilot groan out and break the kiss. He threw his head back against the pillow and lifted his hips into Dean’s. The thin fabric of Cas’s underwear didn’t do much to hide the fact that they were both growing hard as Dean rubbed their shafts together with each rock of his hips.
Dean groaned, eyes falling shut. He’d be lying if he said that didn’t feel damn good. At this point, he had gone so long without sex that he didn’t care which way it went, as long as it felt good. So he nodded, “Yeah, okay...”
“Ya’ll were close.”
“So we’ll send each other letters. Just so we know...” He trailed off, then cleared his throat. “I mean, how else am I gonna find you in the summertime when I come back?”
“Yes, I would like to speak with a Miss Anna Novak, please?”
“So how long are you staying with us? It is good to have you home.”
Prior to posting this chapter, I wrote a ficlet as a gift because of how long it was taking to post this chapter. If you would like to read it, it's still
“Yes, a Lieutenant. It’s roughly the Naval equivalent to an Army Captain. All pilots in the Navy are officers. And, well, we don’t use the rank of Captain in the same way as the Army to avoid confusion with the ship’s Captain, who ranks significantly higher.”
Shifting his weight to one arm, Dean used his other to trail a hand slowly down Castiel’s chest. The pilot felt his body move without any permission granted, arching into that tender touch. Castiel sucked in a broken breath and let his eyes fall shut. How could Dean completely undo him this way? “Please,” he begged, not even knowing what he was begging for, exactly.
“She’s wrong.”
Cas first met Sam and Jess the evening he arrived in Lawrence. They had spent most of the day out and about, finalizing things for the wedding and didn’t return to the Winchesters’ house until just before supper. When they walked in, Cas was sitting in the front room with Dean. Both men stood upon seeing the couple and Sam glanced back and forth between Dean and Cas with a broad smile on his face.

"Does the first train back leave early enough?" Dean's closed his eyes and tipped his head to brush their noses together.
“Yup.” Dean nodded and opened another letter, from an old school friend in Kansas.
“Alright,” Castiel nodded. “Send letters to NS Great Lakes, attention Castiel Novak.”
Castiel blinked and considered his words before speaking, “Did it... go over well?”
It wasn’t uncommon for men to walk through town in uniform, especially Navy men, since the training base was nearby, and the sight would surely just become more and more common in the coming years. They were all being called in, made to train and keep on their toes in case they were sent out to hold locations on behalf of the UK. Even when the United States wasn’t officially in the war, they still had a presence in the form of back up.
Ash and Benny both laughed and teased him a little longer, but then they let the subject drop.
“John, please,” Mary chided. “Must we talk of war at the dinner table?”
“Especially now, or at any holiday, really. We have to visit people that neither Anna nor I could care any less about... Tell me about your visit home. I’m sure it’s preferable to mine.”
“Yeah...” Dean agreed, because he would pretty much agree to anything Cas said right now. He gasped quietly as one of Cas’s hands began stroking over the length of his dick, through the fabric of his boxers. Dean kept rocking his own hips as his method of bringing Cas to full hardness.
“Aww,” Gabe cooed. “He’s homesick for us.”
“Hmm?” Dean glanced over at him, confused.
“I’m home. It’s good to see you, Anna. Are Mother and Father here?” Their parents had never been around much, with their father always either keeping up business dealings or serving in the Navy. All the time he spent on shore leave during the last war was devoted to his business. Their mother maintained the upkeep of the house and their name in society.
“Well, then this is perfect! It’s been on the radio a lot, so she should have no trouble recognizing it if she listens a lot.”
“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” He assured her. It was likely that she hadn’t told their parents of her plan to come meet him. They would send a card with money and names impassively signed to the bottom.
“So about the candy,” Castiel pointedly changed the subject, stopping in front of a shop. Dean nearly missed the sudden action and took a few steps past Castiel. He had to stop on a heel and about-face. Castiel smiled at the blatantly military move.
The pair strolled through the grassy lawn just in front of the pier, taking in the sights before entering the large front doors. It was like walking into a great, long courtyard, with red brick walls that stretched the length of the pier out into the lake. Two towers stood above the walls flanking the entrance. Shops and restaurants lined the interior like some sort of western adaptation of a bazaar.
Dean’s eyes strayed over to Castiel, who sat back in his chair, relaxed as he watched the musician performing. He wore his usual neutral expression but Dean spotted the slight smile turning up the corners of his lips. Cas’s head bobbed in small nods along with the slow beat of the music. When Sonny Boy got towards the end of his song and played the harmonica, accompanied by someone else on the piano, Castiel closed his eyes. His expression shifted from carefully neutral to rather serene.
Jo returned her gaze to Cas. “Everything he said is a lie.”
“So...” Dean started, not knowing where he was going with his statement.
“Wait, when did I become a messenger here?” Dean piped up.
“Bal and Inias are in the cabin across from ours, they’re getting settled in now. You ought to do the same. Inias will probably be up here any second to check out the planes, he could barely contain himself.”
“Yeah, of course I am.” She looked back at Dean, “I’m just sad for myself.”
“Til then,” Dean added, watching him go until Novak turned after a couple of steps and walked away. The whole way back to the hotel, Dean couldn’t wipe the smile off his face. It wasn’t really anything to get too excited about, he was leaving Monday morning and in time this would all be a distant memory. Nonetheless, he couldn’t help feeling happy.
The dark haired pilot opened the bottle of lubricant and squeezed an ample amount onto his fingers before setting it aside. “Come here...”
The woman laughed, “Yes, I know. One moment please.” There was a brief pause, then she was back. “He should be here in a few minutes. Can you wait or would you like me to take a message?”
Dinner, for officers, was held in the wardroom, while the enlisted men had a larger room, more like a cafeteria. The Ranger had just over two hundred officers on board, most of whom were pilots. The number of enlisted men was two thousand more than that, and they did a wide range of jobs, from working in the engine to  doing laundry, from cooking to ammunitions. On board, there was a full medical wing, with doctors and a dentist; there was even a barber. Men on board carriers might be at sea for months on end, especially in times of war. Navy guys referred to aircraft carriers as floating cities or cities at sea, because they were so large and offered so many services. As big as it was, though, as soon as you were in the air trying to land on the flight deck, nothing made a carrier seem quite big enough.
“I don’t know. Too many thoughts in my head.”
At least this time Cas could gloat about his pleasant climate without being secretive about where he was going. Though the thought of returning to training was a drab one, after finally getting to go back to sea. Catching up with Gabe before heading to Lawrence, Cas discovered that the rest of the crew would be shipping out on the 31st, the same day as the wedding, but sailing on the
Dean kissed his way up to Castiel’s ear, kissed his ear, too, and whispered, “I got ya’, Cas.” He lifted himself up just enough to look down into Castiel’s face, saw the way Cas’s brows were drawn together, his mouth slack with want, eyes half-lidded, and simply smiled. “I got ya’.”
“Thanks, fellas, I think I’ve got it figured out now.”
“You know I’ll write you if I’m going to be sent to sea,” Castiel assured him. “Because I won’t be able to get letters until I return to shore.”
Dean chewed his lip and gave a small nod. They both fell silent after that. The silence was filled with all the unspoken words they both had for each other. The things they weren’t allowed to say or were too scared to say. In some ways, not being allowed to be open about their feelings for one another made avoiding difficult declarations easier. If Cas wasn’t allowed to say he loved Dean, he didn’t have to worry about whether Dean would say it back.
Intense blue eyes met his and Cas sat up, kissing Dean hard. Dean easily gave himself over to that kiss as Cas wrapped an arm around his waist. He began thrusting again, harder and faster this time until the kiss finally had to break. Cas pressed his face into the crook of Dean’s shoulder and groaned loudly as he finally came inside Dean a moment later.
“Ohhh, how romantic. So your cutie came up here again in July?” He nodded. “Are you ever going to go down there?”
Dean nodded, but said nothing; they were both thinking the same thing. When they parted ways tonight, the chances were high that they would never see one another again. They were military men, following orders wherever it took them. The past two nights were like a dream in a world where war was looming just on the outskirts of their vision.
“Well, if it isn’t little Joanna Beth,” He teased back. She cringed.
“Oh, yes. It’s a very good song.”
“Cars break down, get flats and all their parts will soon be rationed if we go to war.”
“Anna will find a way to do something, I’m sure of that.”
“Oh, he’s only just sat down, do you need to start with that, John?” Mary asked with a frown.
“Oh, enough war talk now,” Mary waved John off. “You can pick his brain later. I want to get to know you, Castiel.”
“Oh yeah, sure, right here.” He turned around and dug through papers on a desk beside him and pulled out the magazine. “We subscribed to it when they started their hit list back in July.”
Novak chuckled, “Chicago was a different place then, things have changed, a lot has happened.”
The fic is not over. There's more story to come. Please don't kill me. But please do comment with all your thoughts and emotions and hatred for me. Thank you, again, for reading and sticking with me. I really do love you all for it.
“Penny for your thoughts?” Dean asked, his voice quiet even to his own ears.
“Oh, yes! Dean’s told us you’re a pilot. That must be exciting.”
“You know I would never defend mother over you, right?”
“I will, I will, I know,” Dean gave her one more squeeze, then let her go. She went straight back to Sam’s side and he draped an arm around her small shoulders. “Goodnight everyone.”
After a sweep through the room for anything else of his, Castiel sighed. It was ridiculously early, the sun had yet to raise, but the first trains would be leaving very soon and he was already cutting it close to making it back to base in time to change into uniform and start training. Unpacking was going to have to wait until after training. The mental checklist Cas was going through vanished the moment he laid eyes on Dean’s sleeping figure once more. He sighed again and swallowed hard when he realized this was the last time he would see Dean for a long, long time. Stepping forward, he took a seat on the edge of the bed.
“No, not just yet. I just felt the need to kiss you.” He smiled and spread a hand over Dean’s chest.
“Am I going to have to punch you? You know, I’m stronger now than I was when I left. And you may be a giant but you’re still scrawny, so don’t make me beat you up.”
“That’s personal.” Cas said, managing to keep a straight face. “Thank you.” He turned to walk away.
“And apparently there are orders to shoot any ships in American waters. I guess since before the boat got hit.”
“When was this taken?”
“The only world mother has ever known was one where women couldn’t get ahead. Where men don’t listen to women or wouldn’t let them run a company. I think she’s afraid that without a man, no one will listen to you.”
“I guess we’ll see. I’m not moving up in rank any time soon, I don’t think,” Dean shrugged.
“I think what your father means is, are you making any friends?” Mary moved behind John, setting her hands on his shoulders and smiling sweetly at Dean.
“Take care of yourself out there. There’s a war on, you know.”
“Me too,” Castiel whispered back.
“Hello, uh, Merry Christmas. I would like to make a long distance call, please?”
“Ma’am. Would it be alright if I play this track?” He asked, pointing to the album.
Without much of a plan for what to get everyone, except for a new spatula and pot holders for his mother, Dean just decided he would wander in and out of each shop until something caught his eye. The only people he planned to buy gifts for were his mom and dad, Sam and Jess. The idea of getting something for Cas certainly crossed his mind. What he would get for Cas or how he would get it to him, however, Dean didn’t know. With his mind in a daze, thinking about Cas, he wound up staring absently at a shelf of decorative salt and pepper shakers and didn’t notice anyone around him.
“Kind of... I’m sure it will be very culturally interesting, being there. Weather is weather, when you grow up in Illinois, you just deal with whatever you get most of the time.” Cas shrugged, indifferent. “Are you looking forward to anything coming up in your training?”
Dean’s chest felt tight at the thought that Cas nearly came down to visit. He didn’t know what he would have done with himself had Cas shown up at his door. Or called from the bus stop up the road. He quickly shook his head out of his daydreams and remembered to respond, “Too bad. We will have to find some other excuse to get you out here. Maybe for the wedding.”
They rode the elevator car up to the top floor of the hotel and found the lounge half full of people. It was Friday, but still fairly early in the evening for folks to be out at clubs or lounges. Most people were likely waiting for the sun to go down and the city to cool off. The maitre-d showed them to a table not far from the stage where a pretty, young lady in a long gown was singing popular tunes of the day.
“You’re an independent woman, I thought you’d just introduce yourself.”
They walked on, occasionally stepping into shops to see what was for sale, but neither man bought anything. A little past ten, they stole a seat at a cafe to sip coffee and watch people go by. Castiel took his coffee with a dash of cream while Dean took his black. They sat quietly, as families walked past, children holding the hands of their parents, skipping between them. Bright, smiling faces were on all. Dean set his mug down and gestured to one such happy family across the way.
“Thank you.” Castiel smiled and while the young woman -- the only other person in the small shop -- wasn’t looking, he reached out and gave Dean’s hand a small squeeze. Dean squeezed his hand right back and flashed a smile that Castiel wanted to kiss. Just then the woman turned back around and they covertly dropped hands.
“You, you’ll always be little, even when you’re giant,” Dean back tossed at him, indignantly.
was doing were intended to keep Allied ships in that area safe from Axis attack. The Caribbean had been fairly uneventful while they were there, despite strategic locations like Cuba or Puerto Rico. However, this tour’s proximity to Greenland and Iceland proved more important now.
“Oh, girls, stop coddling him,” John rolled his eyes and nodded to Dean. “He’s a big boy with a good head on his shoulders, he’ll be alright.”
“You. The night we met.” And Cas will nudge Dean’s cheek, and they’d be swaying around, hands holding onto each other, bodies close.
Cas distracted himself by stopping the record and putting the needle back on its rest. He couldn’t get rid of the bashful smile, though. “It does.”
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. He wasn’t used to seeing Cas flustered and it was a great sight to behold. He wrapped both arms around Cas’s hips and pulled him into a loose hug. “You’re kinda cute when you blush.”
“Yeah, you said that. You’ll be fine. And anyway, I’m not going to let you fall. I taught Sammy how to skate, I can teach you how to again.” He stood and, of course, had no trouble doing so.
“Good food, as always.”  He nodded and Anna rolled her eyes.
“Aw, I love her. You would too, it’s impossible not to love Jess, and she’s perfect for Sammy.”
Anna kicked him in the shin. “Give me a straight answer.”
“Dean’s talking in riddles. This is one for you,” Benny said and leaned back on his bed again.
Inside they were alone, utterly closed off from the rest of the world and all the people who would sneer at their union. Words like “sick” and “pervert” and “wrong” were left out on the streets, far away from their ears. The only words they could hear now were their own.
Cas nodded, shoulder still firmly pressed against Dean’s. “Exactly.”
After dinner, the girls cleaned up while the John went into the den to listen to the evening radio programs. Sam hovered around, chatting with Jessica until she told him to make himself useful drying dishes. Dean leaned in the doorway to the kitchen, watching his family, his happy brother, loving mother and set-in-his-ways father. He had joined the army to follow in his father’s footsteps, but Dean knew that protecting these people, his family, and hundreds of thousands of families like his across the country, was the real reason he served. If the war ever came to their home, Dean wanted to know that his family was safe. He would do anything to keep them safe.
They both began grunting and groaning more as the pace of their coupling sped up. As Dean came down on Cas’s shaft, Cas pushed his hips upwards to meet him, then took over control. He pushed himself up on one elbow and wrapped his free hand Dean’s shaft. Pumping his hand up and down, he drove Dean on towards completion.
It was Thursday, just two days until the wedding and everything felt a little bit like the calm before the storm. Dean and Cas slept in that morning and were very lazy about getting out of bed. More aptly, they had trouble getting out of each other’s arms. Languid kisses were exchanged for long moments before the sound of Sam knocking on the door, urging them to get ready for breakfast, waylaid their plans for more. After a light breakfast of eggs and toast, everyone announced having plans for the day. Mary was meeting up with Jess and her mother, while John and Sam both had their own business to attend to in town.
With a laugh, Castiel nodded, “It is... It is, so.”
“Oh,” Dean stopped and laughed. “You’re too polite, man. Offering to help all the time.”
Returning on the 23rd of May meant that he could be in Lawrence by the 31st for the wedding. It was a very short tour, which was incredibly lucky in this instance. It could mean the turn around for the next tour would be brief, but he would have time before departing to ask for leave when they got back to port. This was excellent news, so he shuffled through his little bit of mail to find the letter from Dean and read it immediately.
“I wouldn’t want to put you out or anything, if it’s too much trouble. But if you’re up for it, that’d be great!”
Cas began looking through the records. He had no clue which album the song was on, so he had to check all the track listings. The very last album in the box had “Dream a Little Dream Of Me” on it. Picking it up, Cas held his breath, wondering if he wanted to play it in the store after all. He glanced around. There were two men on their own and a woman with a little girl in the shop, as well as the lady at the counter. If he bought the album and took it back to base to listen to, that would require a lot more explaining if anyone asked. This seemed easier.
“I’m certain I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Castiel shook his head and skated away from Dean towards the bench to remove the skates from his shoes. He heard Dean laugh behind him and then joined him to remove his own. They turned them in at the counter and left, making tracks back to the hotel. The night was nice and comfortably cool, so they took their time.
Cas turned his head towards Dean and leaned over just a little so he could speak softly. “I’ll miss you, too.”
“Goodnight, Mr. Winchester.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Dean saluted to his mom, like he was still in training, which made her giggle and shoo him away.
“Damn right it is, Lieutenant.” The biting and kisses continued, attention moving to Castiel’s nipples. He waited until Castiel was hissing at the bites and moaning at the flick of tongue before finally moving on. Lips trailed down his torso, teeth biting at his sides, hands pinning Cas to the bed. He was firm and certain, full of confidence in this and it made Castiel’s heart beat a little harder in his chest. Cas’s own lips were parted, his eyes closed as he took in each of Dean’s touches.
“Yeah?” Sam asked, curious and smiling.
It is almost your birthday.
There was a moment’s silence while Castiel moved into the bathroom and began drawing a bath, then the springs of the bed creaked and Dean padded his way over to the bathroom as well. He stood, leaning in the doorway, watching Castiel. The pilot ignored him, or pretended to, anyway, and pulled his razor and shaving cream from a small pouch he’d packed. He watched Dean watching him by way of mirror as he shaved the morning stubble from his chin and neck. It struck Castiel again just how gorgeous Dean was.
“Alright. See you in a couple hours.”
“You don’t say,” Novak shot back, something akin to mischief dancing in his eyes.
“You aren’t that old,” Dean scoffed. “You’re young enough to be immature, too.”
"I meant your rank," Dean clarified with a point to the bars on Novak's shoulder.
“You really enjoy music?” Castiel asked, quiet enough not to impose on anyone nearby, but loud enough to be heard.
“Your sister can fly, too?” Jess asked, interested in this fact.
“Is this where I give you an opening for more bondage jokes?” Cas rolled his eyes. “About how you would prefer a partner to do the strapping?”
“Oh, stay out with us for one night. It won’t kill you.”
“I like the way you think, Cas,” Dean pointed, then followed suit to roll up his own shirt sleeves. They both untucked their shirts, shrugged out of suspenders and toed off their shoes. While Castiel undid only the top few buttons on his shirt, Dean let his hang open, so only his undershirt covered his chest.
“She knows how to fly?” Jo asked.
Aaron took a deep breath, “I guess. Iceland is so far away...” He seemed at a loss for what to say exactly.
Novak was quiet for a moment. He swirled his drink around, the ice clinking against the glass. When he came to a decision, he gave a small nod, “I could show you.”
Castiel chuckled and it made Dean’s heart feel huge in his chest. No one had this kind of effect on Dean and he was glad that, of all people, Cas was the one who did. They finished dinner, each ate a small dessert with a nightcap drink to go with it, paid for their meal and wandered out of the restaurant. On the street, they caught a cab and made way to the blues house Castiel knew. The cab driver questioned them on the location, as it was in a known colored part of town. Though race relations in Chicago were better than in some other places in America, there was still prejudice. With a slight glare, Castiel confirmed where they were going and the driver pulled out into the street to take them there.
They went downstairs where they met Mary and John sitting at the breakfast table. John was reading a newspaper and Mary was writing something down that Dean assumed was a grocery list. Sam was still gone on his honeymoon with Jess. As they entered the kitchen, Mary looked up at them both and smiled.
When he walked into the house, it was no surprise to Castiel that the first people to greet him were the butler and Anna. The butler took his things up to his bedroom and Anna ran forward to throw her arms around his shoulders.
“Certainly, Mr. Winchester, you can use our courtesy telephone right there.” He gestured to a phone at the end of the desk.
Every so often one of the gals or guys he grew up with would send letters, Dean assumed it was more out of some concept of being the “right thing to do” for “those boys defending our borders,” than because they actually cared, so he wasn’t too surprised when the mail carrier handed him a small packet of letters. It had been his birthday recently, and surely that one or two of the letters were sent for that reason. He thumbed through them, looking for the one from Sammy or his mom as he walked away from the clamoring crowd behind him, only to stop dead in his tracks when he spotted the return address of a letter, the name “C. Novak” and the city, “Great Lakes, IL.”
“Yes, my god, Sam. That is his name.”
“Did your family regularly visit church?” Castiel asked Dean, drawing his attention.
Dean smiled when he received Cas’s letter, but that smile slowly faded as he read the words written in it.
serious?”
“What friend? You know all my friends here.”
“Yes, I mean sex. I miss having sex with you,” his voice dropped to a whisper.
His cadets were given the mornings off on Sundays, but on occasion they would come by for extra practice with more challenging maneuvers. Castiel checked his watch as the hangar came into view. It was quarter to 8, giving him enough time to visit with some of the other higher ranking flight instructors on base. Slowing to a walk, he turned his eyes towards the sky, then over to the West, looking in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. A strange sound caught his attention and seized his breath. There were planes all around the base, but none of them were flying or even taking off, but he heard engines moving in from the West. Soon, he saw them in the sky, heading directly for Ford Island, only they weren’t American fighters.
“Lieutenant Novak?” A voice broke Cas from his thoughts. He was sitting outside on his lunch break, without much of an appetite. He looked up to see one of his students standing above him.
“Anna!”
“Swell, just come up to the room and knock when you get here, then we can hit the town.”
“We will,” Dean nodded, sounding certain. “And it will be grand.”
“Yeah, I guess a lot of the speakeasies are closed now, right?”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded. “Gonna walk Cas to the busstop and probably hang around there until it comes.”
.  It is just a sweet, happy ficlet that involves Dean and Cas from this story. It's a look at a possible future for them, but to avoid spoilers, it can't be called "canon". If you read it, I hope you enjoy it! And I hope you enjoy the chapter below~ There are a few of songs referenced in it, so for your convenience, there are links to them all in the footnotes.
Castiel knew what etiquette dictated but wasn’t sure how formal he was expected to be here. He erred on the side of caution. “Hello, Mrs. Winchester. Yes, I’m Castiel, it is a pleasure to meet you.”
“Ash, they’re school girls...” Dean grabbed him by the shoulder and tugged him away. Benny let Dean move out from under his arm and tipped his hat to the girls.
“You don’t speak much of your parents.”
Cas laughed and rolled his eyes. “Yes, I’ll get right on it.”
Cas laughed, warmed by the thought of her building a model plane for him. He carefully lifted it and inspected her craftsmanship. All the little details were carefully painted on, each part was in just the right place. “It’s beautiful, Anna.”
Cas grew more and more concerned each day that the inevitability of war was drawing nearer. The moment he heard that the Naval Command’s orders to attack Axis ships, he knew it was practically here already. The United States may not have declared war yet, but it was anything but neutral anymore. The position the armed forces and government held on the matter made that clear as the water on Hawaii’s beaches. He could feel that it was coming soon. All it would take was something to push the country over the edge into aggressive battle, not just defensive.
“I have other pillows, you know.” She gestured to them.
They all resumed their conversation and Dean joined in after a few beats, picking up the topic at hand. He noticed that Novak didn’t say much, reserved and upright as he held his uniform cap under one arm. Dean kept finding his gaze drawn to the man, noticing little things about him, like his fine jaw line, soft looking hair, kind eyes that looked like they would sparkle if the man let himself smile. In short, really, Novak was gorgeous and Dean couldn’t help but appreciate the view.
They all chuckled and Dean glanced over at Benny for a moment before looking away. He had a picture of Cas that he could look at, but not right now. Not when it was a photograph of their first kiss, kept safely hidden away in the bottom of his dufflebag, shoved into the bottom of his footlocker. Dean had decided to keep it hidden in the pocket Bible his mother gave him before he enlisted. He figured it was the last place anyone would look for anything incriminating.
“Not a bad idea.” Dean looked over at Benny with a smile.
“You, too, sis.” Cas hung up the phone with a smile. Every year, Anna made a special effort for him on his birthday, as he did on hers. Growing up, all they had was each other, and so they would always look out for one another.
Aaron fidgeted, looking for words, “I worry about my mom.”
Cas chewed his lip as he waited and wished he had a glass of water. Suddenly, his mouth felt drier than a desert. Setting up the transfer for a long distance call was no easy task. The Operator had to contact other call centers and string together the connection, or that was as far as Cas understood what happened. He tapped his fingers on the desk and occasionally glanced at the closed door. No one would interrupt him, no one was going to move from their seats for hours, most likely.
“Really am gonna miss you,” He whispered against Castiel’s stomach.
“Lieutenant Castiel Novak,” He said, putting emphasis on the Lieutenant.
“He’s quite intelligent, though I don’t think he realizes it. He’s kind and seems to care very deeply about people. He cares a lot about his little brother, and protecting innocent lives is a priority to him, which is part of why he serves.”
“A lieutenant is never immature.”
“Dean!” The unmistakable voice of his little brother shouted from the kitchen moments before the giant that was Sam came bounding down the hall. Without a second thought, they both wound arms about each other in a firm hug.
“What is it?” Castiel stumbled over to see the poster, a lively picture of Errol Flynn brandishing a pirate sword against an unseen enemy. In the background, a man and woman embraced as if about to kiss. The text at the bottom read the actor’s name and the film’s title, The Sea Hawk.
Dean pushed off the doorframe and sauntered towards the sink. He wore an easy grin on his face that said he knew just how he had affected Castiel, despite the pilot’s attempt to be inconspicuous. Trying to ignore this, Castiel slid into the bathtub, relaxing back into it with closed eyes and a soft sigh. Meanwhile, Dean began lathering up to shave his own shadow of a beard.
A face he longed to touch now, the way he longed to touch the man just before they parted ways the last time. Summer was a short few months away. It had already been two and a half months since that day. He could wait. Until then, he had his thoughts and his memories. Castiel’s imagination wasn’t vivid, but his hand was strong and certain and though it was too familiar for his mind to pretend it was Dean’s, it got the job done. He rubbed his palm over himself until he was hard and breathing heavily. Then, after licking his palm, he began to pull, twisting his wrist, fingers coiling around his member.
He twisted his hand expertly around the shaft, stroking up and down in the perfect way. The rhythm of Dean’s rocking hips soon began matching the strokes of Cas’s hand. Dean could feel the hard length of Cas against his ass, and it felt good.
Castiel eyed him, but wore a sideways smirk of amusement at the same time. “I certainly enjoyed myself, though I wouldn’t attribute that entirely to the film.”
“You will simply have to visit Chicago again another time.”
Castiel chuckled through the phone, “Until then.”
She stared at him.
He could hear the faint sound of Gabe’s laugh, then a quiet, “Night, Cas.”
Dean hummed and frowned, looking away. He knew which subjects Cas was referring to without having to ask. “Yeah, I know those ones.”
Castiel stepped forward, hooking a finger under the chain of Dean’s dogtags and lifted it up. He inspected the metal tag, running his thumb over the raised letters and numbers. Dean couldn’t read the expression on Cas’s face; it was one of deep concentration and something undefinable.
“So you were cheating.” Dean looked at him with a smirk and Castiel looked down, bumping the backs of their hands together.
“Yeah,” Dean huffed a laugh, caught out in expecting to have some fun sharing a bed with Cas. The slightest tinge of color touched his cheeks. “Under the pillow.”
“Sure, just the smallest box size you have will do. And another of those dark chocolate mays, please?”
The last line, that last question, made Cas suck in a breath as he read it. He immediately wanted to write back, but that didn’t feel fast enough. Cas wished they both had private telephone lines, that he could just call Dean, wished they could hear each other’s voices for a moment. When stealing a plane and flying to North Carolina somehow felt like a good idea, Cas knew he needed to get ahold of himself. He set the letter down and scrubbed his hands over his face.
“Thanks, sis.” Cas gave a half-hearted smile at her.
Here’s another excerpt from my notes, apparently:
As they were leaving, Cas began yawning.
“Yeah,” Dean said, feeling his chest get tight as the bus neared. “I’m gonna miss you, too, Cas.”
“Darling, I never confuse anyone with myself.”
Castiel shook his head at Dean, “Some real talented fellas perform there.”
“You can thank my train for that,” Castiel walked towards Dean, closing the distance between them.
“Ain’t nobody wanna hear about you riding,” Benny chimed in, shaking his head.
So, instead, they danced around it. They showed each other how they felt as they had that morning, as they no doubt would when it was time to say goodbye, or in veiled words like their conversation now.
Dean nodded, putting his hands in his pockets. It never occurred to him that, after all this time, they wouldn’t know how to act around each other. Their first meeting was such a spur of the moment series of events that they never stopped to think about what they were doing. This time, it all felt very serious and deliberate.
Tuesday evening, Dean was sitting out in the back yard, stretched out on the grass, leaning back on his elbows. Sam came out to find him and took a seat, cross-legged on the grass beside Dean.
And just like that, he climbed onto the bus. Dean watched through the windows as he moved down the aisle and found a seat, on the side that faced the street, of course. Dean waved to him and Cas made a gesture that Dean swore was him blowing a kiss. It made Dean laugh, because it was so cheesy, but it was the best they could do in lieu of an actual kiss, he figured.
Sam gave him a hug and a handshake, “I’ll probably be asleep when you leave. But take care, and have some fun.” He met Dean’s eye with a meaningful stare and a warm smile.
“It may be cold and rainy here, we may have to share with twenty other guys, but at least there’s room to breathe. And no chance of our beds sinking in the night.” Ash said. “I’m sure your friend is used to it, but me? I’ll take dry land any day.”
“Years of being a smart ass.” Anna shrugged innocently and Cas nearly choked on his water.
“No, no.” He shook his head. “You’re right, we are.”
“I’m 25,” Dean admitted. “What about you, Lieutenant?”
Everyone ambled on outside of the church and made their way to a nearby reception hall. Cas found Dean outside but couldn’t talk to him, as he was surrounded by friends and relatives, answering questions and receiving compliments about what a great ceremony it was. When everyone left, Dean found Cas and they walked to the hall together. Thinking it was the only time they would have somewhat to themselves, Cas took advantage of it.
Mary came over to his side, set a hand on his shoulder and stood on her toes to kiss his temple, as she always did. “Goodnight, son, I’ll see you in the morning before you leave.”
Novak studied Dean for a moment, his eyes had an intense sort of stare, like he was trying to see right through a man. Dean licked his lips absently under that gaze and shifted. He didn’t question Dean any further, though, instead changing the subject. “I think I was always meant to be a soldier. It feels right, being up in the air.”
Dean laughed, tipping his head back as he did so. He squeezed Cas’s hand and tugged him closer. “So we’re special somehow?”
“Not really.” The man shook his head. “They don’t bother fully loading the cases with ammo during tests, just what they need for the tests. That way they don’t waste ammo.”
Then it happened. News of the attack spread through Hickam so quickly that everyone knew by nightfall. The
“Maybe not quite as tan as Mr. Flynn, but probably sexier.”
“As sappy as it sounds, how much I missed your voice.”
Bal and Inias started making rounds to come in for a landing. The elder, British pilot came down first, hooking the second arresting cable and stopping his plane with ease. He taxied quickly out of the way as Inias made his descent. Everything was going well at first, but he came in a little too quickly and when he caught the cable, there was too much tension. Cas saw it as it happened, the cable snapped and flailed wildly. He, and other witnesses, shouted as loud as they could, warning the men on deck of the loose wire.
Then, when all is said and done and they get to be together in the end:
“Tell me about it,” Dean said before biting at a nipple, reveling in the sharp intake of breath from Castiel.
Maybe one day. Maybe one day the world would be different, maybe one day they could hold hands in public or be the happy couple getting married. Maybe one day they didn’t have to fear for their jobs and careers and lives just to say three small words to each other.
“Because I’m the oldest.”
“Of course,” Castiel said and they stepped out of the booth, dropping hands when they were no longer in their safe haven. Out in the public eye again, they walked on as two ordinary servicemen, as if nothing was between them but friendship. Dean escorted Castiel the entire distance to the train station, stopping just outside it and glancing between the pilot and the other few stragglers that ran in to catch the last train.
Deploying 28 April 1941
“I do say,” Novak replied, glancing away as his smile grew slightly.
Once the tub was full, Dean turned off the tap and climbed in. He was thorough about bathing, but didn’t linger any longer than necessary. His hair was given a quick wash, as well; he wanted to look good for Cas. After the bath, he drained the tub, dried off and styled his hair. Dean liked to keep it neatly combed to the side, like the current fashion. He had some time to kill before Castiel showed up, so spent the time unpacking and ironing his clothes.
When the kiss met a natural end, Dean pressed one more brief kiss to Castiel’s lips, then traveled down his body. Worshipful kisses peppered across Castiel’s skin, not as a means to an end with the goal of getting to his dick, but with the intention of little affections. He kissed the nape of Cas’s neck, down along his collarbone, over his heart, nudged his dogtags aside and kissed the place beneath them. He kissed along the side of his ribs, the ridges of Castiel’s abs, the place just beside his belly button and along one hip bone. He hooked his fingers beneath the waistband of Castiel’s boxers and slowly pulled them off.
In the end, everything went off without a hitch. Everyone arrived on time and once they all found their seats, Sam made his way up to the altar, Dean beside him as his Best Man. Dean and Cas were, of course, dressed to the nines in their full military dress uniforms and Cas had noticed several of the older women had complimented Dean on how nice he looked in his. Cas couldn’t help but agree with them and told Dean as much before the ceremony was to start. Dean made sure to mention that he caught a few ladies, young and old, looking twice at Cas.
“What kind of shopping?” Cas narrowed his eyes.
“Purpose,” Dean supplied. “That’s the thing you’re interested in.”
“Not just yet, we’re going to the pier first.” With that, Castiel started them south, the wind off the lake ruffling their clothes and sending Cas’s tie fluttering over his right shoulder. Dean smiled again and jogged a couple steps to catch up. He kept his hands in his pockets, but occasionally bumped his shoulder into Castiel’s. Compared to the city streets, the trail was empty and they could walk alone for now.
“So, uh, did you want to get dinner? Or were you planning to stay in tonight?” Dean raised a brow and flashed a smirk at the pilot.
“That would explain why ours jammed and the others’ didn’t. We were maneuvering more than they were.” Cas said and Gabe turned to him, grinning.
Dean and Jo answered simultaneously that Ellen was Jo’s mother.
“You don’t believe I’ll come back?”
“Thank you.” Cas left the shop, still smiling and feeling lighthearted. When he got back to the base, he would write Dean’s letter and hopefully finish it before the mail left for the day.
“It did. I was young, 18 I think, and I was so glad to be on my own. Even if I was under the orders of a drill sergeant and commanding officers, at least they would recognize when I did well.”
Cas nodded solemnly. “It was a defensive strike. They were picking up men adrift after the u-boat sunk a Dutch cargo ship. The Germans were preparing to attack when we fired at them first.”
Dean was smiling and Castiel found himself mirroring the expression. It was easy to feel young and free around Dean, the man brought it out in him. He felt as though they were at a place where they were friends, good friends, in addition to being lovers. He laughed at the thought of such a word, “lovers.” Dean looked over at him curiously.
“Just come on, it’s hot and they have air conditioning.” Dean made his way to the box office to buy a couple of tickets. Still laughing, Castiel followed behind him.
He puts a hand to the side of Cas’s face. It’s a friendly gesture to anyone watching. But so much more to them. And Dean just has to feel him. To know he’s alive.
“What’s the matter?”
“Well, if that ain’t the biggest smile I seen on you in days,” Benny drawled as he looked at Dean. “What happened?”
“You’re a good teacher,” Cas said and gave him a conspiratorial smile.
From the corner of his eyes, Dean could see Castiel bow his head and he looked over to see the pilot frowning.
“What were you grinning at?” Cas asked as Dean pushed him back against the door.
“So I take it your dad was difficult to impress?”
“Aw, Cas. Maybe when the war is over we’ll settle down and adopt a few rugrats.”
She looked at him, aghast, and held a hand to her chest. “You don’t think he would be pleased to see you?”
“This week went by so fast,” Mary said, placing her hands on Dean’s shoulders and giving a squeeze. “I can’t believe you’re leaving tomorrow.”
“Damn...” Benny whistled. “Lucky bastard. I’d love to be out on sea in the tropics, floating on a boat, wind in your hair. Warm air, cool water...”
“This is the same man you were worried doesn’t feel the same way about you that you feel about him?” Anna sounded surprised.
“Getting by, you know. Missing my brother desperately, though.”
“Oh, they are. Definitely. I’m pretty sure that Sammy never did stop falling in love with her once he started. He looks at her the same way now as he did when before he asked her out.”
“Yes, they will.” Castiel knew very well what Dean was saying, but he was apparently going to play along anyway. “Lucky for them I’m a very good pilot. And lucky for me, so are they.”
Dean chuckled and shrugged, “Just watching... Gotta make the most of it, you know.”
And then Gabe will walk over and go, “so Cas. Wanna introduce us to your friend here?”
“Actually, I was wondering if maybe you still had the list from August 17th?”
“I do. I wouldn’t change it, given the option. Though, when you’re a pilot, a good one, anyway, you sometimes spend more of your time training young pilots than out at sea. I might change that part.” He grinned.
“I’m visiting a friend, okay? Now I’m hungry, can we leave the questioning for another time?”
“Yeah, well, you better be...” Dean was frowning now, Cas could see it on his face and hear it in his voice.
All eyes turned to Cas, who was, in fact, smiling at Inias, he gave a nod. “Anything is better than those bi-wing planes.”
“I’m a level headed, intelligent woman. I always have contingencies.”
“Then I hope one day I have the privilege of meeting her, and your brother.”
“Yes. Yes, I’m fine. I’m happy.”
“I made it home fine, didn’t I?” John gestured to himself and Mary sighed. Jessica and Sam shared a look with each other, smiling and Dean watched them. He knew one day the two of them would be married and fawning and worrying over each other. It made him happy.
"No, I'm a pilot," Novak looked at Dean with a confused expression that the army man was trying not to consider adorable.
“How do you mean?”
“Now he’ll make an honest woman of you, and I finally get to say you’re my sister-in-law!”
“Jess is going to come over for dinner tonight. She and Sam both wanted to see how you were, but they thought they would give you some time to relax first.”
His chest felt tight and Dean thought this is what love must feel like. Real love. Not a crush, not some romp in the hay. Actual love. The idea that he was truly in love with Cas was somehow even more daunting than the anxiety about Cas leaving today, and both of them fed into one another. He wanted to speak, but couldn’t find the words and wasn’t sure his voice would cooperate with him even if he knew what to say. They stayed that way for what felt like minutes, but could have been no time at all.
Castiel avoided it all, having no interest in the holiday and, on any other year, no sweetheart, but today he found his thoughts turning to Dean and wondered if his letter got to the infantryman alright. He decided to check the mail clerk’s office in the dormitory where he stayed, just in case. Surely Anna would have a letter for him, anyway.
“Great, thanks,” Dean nodded and grinned at Castiel, who could only shake his head and chuckle.
“I’ll help you with that...” Dean murmured into his ear and Castiel smiled. Rid of the jacket, which Dean tossed onto their unused bed, Cas leaned back against Dean’s chest. The taller man wound his arms around Castiel’s waist, untucked his shirt and began unfastening the buttons one by one.
They stretched out on the bed, touching and kissing each other, necking like teenagers up at lookout point. Their hands were everywhere, messing up each other’s hair, grabbing onto arms or pressing to chest or back. Their clothes were rumpled and sloppy, shirts half untucked, suspenders falling off their shoulders and socks half off. Half way through, Dean began laughing, a warm and beautiful sound to Castiel’s ears.
Cas could live like this every day and never tire of it. He returned the kiss, barely containing the broad smile that Dean had set upon his lips.
“Well, there is more than my heart at stake here.”
“Take care of yourself,” Dean said, voice hoarse.
“Years of practice,” Cas shrugged. “I’ve never crashed a plane before. I’ve had to eject once, outside of training, and it wasn’t so terrible. I told you, I’m an excellent swimmer.”
“Oh, I definitely understand that.”
Backing up just enough to give himself space, Dean tugged Cas’s suspenders down and took his shirt off, leaving him in just an undershirt. He stepped around so they were standing face to face and hands went to the fly of Castiel’s pants. Tired but determined, Castiel got his shoes off and lifted his hands to Dean’s chest. While the pilot had intended to undo the buttons, he got distracted and just slid his hands slowly up Dean’s chest, stopped there and leaned in, resting his head against Dean’s shoulder.
“I do insist.” Dean turned that grin on Castiel and the pilot felt himself return it.
“I have...” Cas sighed. “Most of them are quite boring and stuffy. This one was more like a celebration.”
“Yeah, just like Sam and Jess.” Dean felt somber at that thought. Though he did his best to avoid feeling jealous of his brother and soon to be sister-in-law, at the moment he didn’t feel any jealousy at all. Sure, Sam and Jess could be open about their love, they could hold hands in public and get married, but at the heart of it, what was really important was that they loved each other.
“Dean, what are you--?” Castiel stumbled, nearly yanking his hand away.
“Okay, look, I want to say something, right, but I can’t really just say it.”
“So what if it is?” Dean smirked, glad he could see Castiel get flustered by the compliment, if only in an understated way. “Now I thought you wanted to have your way with me.”
Now that the
Dean pulled back first, setting his hands on Cas’s shoulders and looking him over. “You look great, man. How was the trip?”
“See me? Yes. Meet my annoying kid sister for the first time without warning?” Cas narrowed his eyes back at her. “I don’t think so.”
“Glenn Miller was playing the night we met...” Cas mentioned, realizing too late what he had said.
“Is it weird being back?”
Then Cas began running his fingers through the hair at the back of Dean’s head. It was a slow, soothing motion that made Dean hum happily. The feeling of it helped wash away some of his worries, though he knew they would surface later when Cas wasn’t there to soothe his troubled heart. Dean drank it up now while he could.
managed to spot the oncoming attack before it happened and drove off the Germans with an attack of their own. It was significant event, because it was the first time during the course of the Second World War that the US had made a hostile attack against the Axis powers.
“It’s too bad this weekend can’t go on forever.” Dean lamented, looked down at his hand on Castiel’s stomach.
Dean had been bold, daring, warm and inviting. Cas had fallen for him all too easily. When they shared their first kiss, it was all over, he was completely enamoured. Even if Cas hadn’t seen Dean again, he wouldn’t have ever forgotten the man. Now it seemed like Dean would forever be a part of his life.
Cas played it off with a small laugh and shook his head, “Just realized I missed the sound of your quarreling.”
“It is! But have you eaten anything proper for dinner?” Mary held Dean at arm’s length, hands still firm on his shoulders. Her expression was stern.
Page hummed in thought, stroking his chin, “I thought he only made his break around ‘30 or so. Must have been an early one.”
Now it was her turn to glance around, then she mouthed at him, “Is it a man?”
“You’re already out on missions?
“Oh ha ha.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“Yes... Wow,” Cas repeated, tilting his head back to kiss Dean’s neck.
“I’m alright with that.” Dean kissed Cas once more, then pulled back to look at the man’s face. “You okay?”
“Can’t argue that.” Dean suddenly thought of Cas’s sister and wondered if maybe she and Jo might get along. The thought made him smile suddenly.
When their lips pulled apart again, Castiel blinked up at Dean, “I think I understand.”
“I respect that.” Dean nodded. He and Jo both knew a thing or two about parents’ expectations of following in their footsteps, but Jo had always been more rebellious, at least against her mother’s wishes. “Is it a good job?”
“Damn...” He frowned and spoke into the radio. “My guns are jamming.”
“So it would seem. I got your telegram.”
Dean glared at Sam, then pushed past him to get out of the bathroom.
Dean laughed again, “Uh-huh.”
“What a night!” Dean said as he slouched down in his seat. He had taken his uniform jacket off and hung it on the back of the chair. Cas remained in his full regalia.
“Yeah, well, you gotta appreciate a good song when you hear one.” Dean shrugged, glancing back to Castiel. “Don’t you?”
“I’m sorry?” He looked over at her and the record continued on to the next track.
As the others broke off in separate conversation, Dean moved to stand beside Novak, giving him a little nudge, “You’re Navy, right? What’s the distinction in your uniform? I don’t spend much time outside of army folks in dress blues.”
“You should have used it, then.”
But they’re in public.
“The Nearness Of You? Oh, it’s grand, actually kind of goes nicely with the one you just played. But it’s all about how being near to his sweetheart makes him feel so good.” She explained with an excited smile.
“July 21st, 1940! Lieutenant Castiel Novak was actually worn out by sex.”
They were brand new and beautiful. A fresh paint job and not a single scratch on them yet, they had grey bodies, yellow wings and a green tail. Grumman made, model F4F-3 planes. Cas walked right up to one and slid his hand along the cold, metal body of it. He touched the wing and grinned. Prior to this, the only planes his squadron had received were bi-planes, which did their job admirably, but monowing planes had more maneuverability. He had trained plenty of pilots on monos back at the base, but training wasn’t anything like combat, not really. That was all about formations and targeting, how to escape an enemy on your tail, the textbook stuff. Being out on patrol meant more leeway and being in the air with his squad in these new babies would be a real treat.
Castiel shrugged. “The point is, I think we’re waiting for a reason that hasn’t presented itself just yet.”
“Nothing, just this, you, us. It’s...” Dean couldn’t think of the words he wanted, apparently, because he began kissing Castiel again. He rolled Cas over onto his back and held himself up on an arm. He ran one hand down Castiel’s chest, stopping it on his stomach. It made Castiel arch his back, feeling his stomach flutter beneath Dean’s fingers.
“Where are you calling?”
“I know!” She said through giggles, waving a hand at Castiel. “I’m sorry, it’s just... it’s sweet, that you think he’s pretty.”
“That’s a film I would definitely watch,” Dean laughed, then wondered a bit about the idea of Fred Astaire and Cary Grant kissing in a romantic scene at the end of the movie. He shook his head. “No doubt about it.”
“Hello, sir, how may I help you?” The clerk at the desk smiled politely at Dean.
“Well now, that got you plumb tuckered out, huh?”
Cas opened his mouth, trying to find the words to respond, then closed it again when everything he thought to say just sounded foolish. Eventually he looked away. “It isn’t that I doubt Dean is fully capable of caring for someone. It seems clear that he enjoys being with me and I certainly enjoy being with him.”
“Maybe.” Castiel shrugged and gave him a challenging grin.
We should have lunch in Chicago.
Dean’s hands made short work of Cas’s uniform jacket, unfastening the buttons and slipping the jacket off his shoulders. It fell to the floor, forgotten, as Cas stepped forward, bringing them further into the room. He then started working off Dean’s clothes. He missed this, missed Dean, missed the other man’s body and his touch. So many lonely nights apart, craving each other’s affection, and unable to even say how much they longed for each other.
“They are, yeah. Have you heard from you sister lately?”
“Why do you say that?” Gabe asked.
The pace of Cas’s hand slowed to long strokes, gripping the base of his cock for a second each time. “Hold on.” After Dean’s breathing slowed down and his hips stopped rocking, Cas released his cock. “Take these off...” He said, giving a tug to the boxers.
“Sounds good.” He laced his shoes, pulled on his jacket and waited for Castiel to do the same. They both chose suits of soft brown today, though Castiel’s was darker than Dean’s. He couldn’t help but notice that Castiel looked as fine in a suit as he did in uniform and Dean drank up the sight. Remembering this weekend was important and Dean didn’t want to let any of the details pass him by. Castiel tucked in his shirt, buckled his belt, adjusted his suspenders and pulled his own coat on.
“Yeah, uh, do you have that magazine, Billboard?”
Cas was holed up in his new plane, doing flight checks and waiting for his turn to take off. It was their first time going up in the new F4F’s and even Cas couldn’t deny the thrill of excitement and anticipation. He knew Gabe and Bal would be just as giddy as Inias in their pilot seats, waiting for the Signal Officer to flag the go-ahead.
“Oh yeah? What can I help you with?”
“Wear the most casual thing you have, then. It won’t be as formal as the ballroom.” He glanced around, “If it weren’t so cold, I would suggest shirtsleeves.”
and lots of kissing
He remembered Dean asking if he had any friends and the fact that being with his own friends helped make the time pass by a little faster. Nodding to the fellow Lieutenant, he said, “I suppose it won’t.”
Castiel opened his eyes, not even caring about the way his cheeks flushed, because when he looked at Dean’s face, he saw the soldier’s eyes trained on his body. There was nothing but pure honesty in his expression. It was as if he hardly believed what he saw.
Castiel felt kisses trail down along his cheek and teeth graze over his shoulder. Dean grinned before he spoke, lips brushing against the crux of his neck, “Depends on what’s for breakfast, I guess.”
She stumbled away from the bed, laughing. “Jeeze, okay, you can have him. Just don’t let him go.”
Castiel reached out a hand and brushed some of Dean’s hair back from his face. Dean mumbled something incoherent in his sleep and nuzzled into Cas’s hand. The pilot couldn’t help but smile. He leaned down and pressed a kiss to Dean’s brow, then gently shook him awake.
Dean took a moment to think about it. “Gene Kelly is more attractive than Humphrey...”
Before Cas even realized what was happening, they were just laying in each other’s arms, foreheads pressed together, eyelids heavy as they held each other’s gaze.
“Guess we need to become war heroes or something for that to happen,” Dean scoffed.
Cas laughed, “I think you’re confusing me with yourself.”
“When?” He kissed across Cas’s cheek.
Dean chuckled. “Well, yeah, would be a nice vacation, but I don’t think he’s quite out for a pleasure cruise.”
“Fuck...”
“What does he look like?”
“Sam...” Her eyes were wide.
Finally, the girls came up to them, holding hands and looking shy, “Would you gentleman like to dance?” The first girl asked, both of them batting her lashes.
He was going to miss this.
“In the interest of modesty, I will say I’m not bad,” Cas said with a smile, and everyone chuckled. “But I was afforded the great opportunity to learn to fly from a younger age than most others in my ranks.”
“I’ll do that.” Dean nodded. “How is Anna doing?”
“Aren’t you sentimental, Cas.”
Love wasn’t something anyone could take away from them or make illegal. Things like feelings and emotions and anniversaries and daydreams were theirs to keep, no matter what. From that perspective, Dean didn’t have to be jealous of Sam, because with Cas he had all of those things. Hopefully, he always would. Dean knew love could last, because he knew in his heart that Sam and Jess would love each other forever. While he didn’t know what would be in his future or Cas’s, the past year had made a pretty strong argument for their future.
Here’s an excerpt from my fic notes:
“Somethin’ in that letter sure put you in a good mood.” Benny commented from his bunk. “Smiling like that.”
“There’s the heart of the one you care for, too.” Anna said.
“Shoulda known I’d find you here, fondling the new birds,” came a familiar voice from behind Castiel. He turned with a grin to see Gabriel standing there, arms crossed and grinning right back.
“Not bad, getting along well enough at training, got some good friends there. How about you? How are things here?”
When they stopped long enough to uncover the lube, Dean took his time preparing Castiel. There was unvoiced consent that Dean was taking the lead on this and Castiel was willing to give up the control just to feel this way. He found he enjoyed the feeling of being cared for, especially by Dean. The way Dean worked his fingers inside of him felt almost good enough that he could have gotten off on that alone. The process was slow, like everything else this morning, not tortuously so, but sensual. While one hand worked inside him, the other caressed his stomach and chest. Dean easily had Castiel moaning softly and wanting this feeling to go on forever.
The letter was so long and friendly, so full of the same emotion that all of Cas’s other letters had, that Dean’s guilt only amplified. Now he imagined Cas waiting with everyone else as the mail shipment came in, only to find that he hadn’t gotten any letters from Dean. Sometimes, Dean felt like such an ass. Maybe he would go ahead and write his reply right now. Dinner could wait.
“It is,” Cas agreed and Dean could feel the man’s eyes on him. He turned to look at the pilot.
“What are you implying?”
“Pilots jog too,” Castiel grumbled, even as he leaned close to Dean.
Dean tapped the phone’s receiver against his head for a moment, closing his eyes and thinking. “I’ll wait, I can wait.”
“Hmm?” Dean blinked, as if still waking up. He had been staring at Castiel, his head tilted a little smile on his face. “What? Dinner? Yeah, sounds good.”
“For example... the fact that our letters can’t say what we really want to say to each other.”
Castiel smiled and tipped his head. “You will survive, I’m certain.”
“Yeah, I know, I’m all yours, Cas.” It was the second time that night Dean had said it and it made him feel warm in a way he wasn’t used to. He tipped his head towards Castiel and placed a kiss on his forehead. Spent and happy for a brief moment in their lives, the men closed their eyes and let sleep do the rest of the work for the night.
“Yes, actually, I imagine so,” Cas agreed. “They already do in parts of Europe.”
“Sweet dreams, Gabe.” Cas chuckled, then after a moment added, “Of beautiful women tying you to the bed.”
“We’ll share ‘em,” Dean proclaimed, taking the pictures and gently tearing the top two from the bottom two. He took a moment to consider which set to give Castiel and which set to keep for himself. Saving him the decision, Castiel took the top two, with them looking ahead and smiling, leaving Dean with the pair where they were looking at one another and kissing.
After memorizing each other in for as long as they could, the men finally got out of bed. They couldn’t stop touching each other when they were getting dressed and ready, though. Everything was a bump on the shoulder or a pat on the ass or an arm about the waist. Dean would kiss Cas’s cheek or Cas would kiss the back of Dean’s shoulder. They were both being ridiculous, but Dean kind of loved it. He idly wondered if, maybe one day down the line, they lived together, this might be how they would act. Disgustingly domestic. Dean was surprised by how much he liked that idea.
She sat on the edge of his bed and looked closely at them. Finally, she said, “He is very handsome.”
John smiled, which was a good sign. “Well, now its your boys’ turn to serve and protect.”
Dean arrived at the Aragon Ballroom and received a warm welcome from the doorman, who let him in eagerly. Dean wouldn’t be the only uniformed man in the room tonight, but he might at least be the handsomest. He made his way up the grand staircase, giving pleasant nods to the people milling about who noticed him. He could hear the faint sound of swing music filtering through the building, accompanied by the hum of conversation, occasionally lit with laughter. Following the sounds, he stepped out into the ornately designed grand ballroom.
Cas chuckled, “Don’t discount the fact that their son is rather fond of me.”
Blue eyes searched Dean’s face before brows drew together in confusion, “What?”
Anna put Cas in a good mood and it stuck with him the rest of the day. It was only a few hours later that he realized he never told Dean it was almost his birthday. He resolved, that when he got his next letter from Dean, he would tell the man in his response. Though there was nothing Dean could really do for his birthday, nor did Cas expect anything from him, it was just a date he wanted the man to know.
Dean stood there, watching the serene expression on Castiel’s face as he undressed him. He pulled his arms free of the suspenders and shrugged off his shirt. The white undershirt fit tightly across Dean’s broad chest and left his muscular arms bared. Castiel ran his hands along those arms, his long fingers curling around Dean’s biceps and giving a little squeeze.
The one to Dean gets lost somewhere in the shuffle and never makes it to him. So he doesn’t know that Cas survived and all his attempts to find out never make it through.
“How do you say something without saying it?”
“It’s no bother.” He gathered up dishes and helped carry them to the kitchen sink, where Mary eventually shooed him off. Insisting that he not help wash up, but thanking him for offering all the same.
“That, or we’ll capsize and it won’t matter anyway.” Gabe yawned.
His sister was quiet for a moment, her lips pressed together and her eyes thoughtful. “I guess you don’t. That’s part of life and love, isn’t it? Being uncertain but trying anyway. When you take flight, do you know you won’t be shot down by an enemy fighter?”
A rustling of paper came from the bunk above, then Ash poked his head down. “Well, we kinda figured that we would. But what spurred this statement?”
“A technicality.” Castiel stooped to roll up his pants, then unlaced his shoes and pulled them off, along with his socks. Dean laughed, shook his head, and proceeded to do the same. “You’ll find we aren’t the only ones.”
“Yes. It isn’t easy... and I have my doubts, but for the time being, I am quite happy.”
“How was Kansas and spending time with your family?”
“I hope that’s alright. We don’t have any extra beds, but we’ve set it up with clean linens.” Mary explained.
Dean and Castiel finished washing up eventually and dressed for the day. As Dean was fixing his tie, he smiled over at Castiel, watching the man fastening the buttons of his shirt. "What have you got planned for us today, then?"
“Goodnight, boys. Don’t stay up too late.” John half waved at them and Dean and Cas made their exit, Dean leading the way and Cas close behind.
“Yeah. The sailors seem especially down in the dumps today. Some guys are real keyed up, though. I think they want to go to war.”
“I want you...” Fingers tightened in Dean’s hair, giving enough of a pull to get Dean to look up. Castiel’s eyes were dark and his expression was full of need. “I want you.”
He sees him from a distance and runs for him. Within earshot he calls out “Cas!!!” Frantic with excitement. His chest is tight. Then he sees Cas turn around.
“Very nice to meet you, as well, sir,” Cas said. “And thank you both for letting me stay in your home. I’ve felt very welcomed by your whole family.”
He was already growing hard from Dean’s attention. A warm mouth wrapped around his cock would be a welcome addition to the morning’s activities. Dean smirked against his hip and placed more teasing kisses all along the path to his dick before finally licking a long line from base to head. Castiel let out a long, low moan in appreciation and loosened his grip on Dean’s neck, letting the man take charge of pace.
“I wonder if Sam would invite me,” Cas chuckled. “I expect to be deployed sometime this year, though. I will probably be at sea the day they get married.”
But instead Dean stares in disbelief, blaming the heat and dust of the African afternoon for the way his eyes are watering. “Christ. I thought you were dead.”
“I ran into a friend the other day, her name’s Jo, and I think she and Anna would get along really well.”
“It isn’t right, we’re just as tough as boys. Tougher, in some ways.”
“I feel like I have so much to tell you,” Cas chuckled. “All the things I wasn’t allowed to say in the letters.”
“Yeah, definitely,” Sam laughed, releasing Cas’s hand and wrapping an arm around Jess’s shoulders. “This is my beautiful fiancee, Jessica.”
Cas raised a hand to comb through Dean’s hair, enjoying the weight of the other man against him. “We will meet again. We will do this again.”
“Hey, guys, mind if we go in here?”
Sam shook Cas’s hand, holding it between both of his own. He was a giant of a man, bigger than Dean, which was surprising, considering he was the younger brother. “Cas, it’s so nice to finally meet you! Dean’s told me so much about you.”
“Cas is probably right.” Ash said, sighing. “If they’re openly attacking our guys out there, they aren’t going to stop. Those boys are probably lucky that only eleven of them died.” The three of them sat quietly in the realization that Ash’s morbid statement was likely true. Ash broke the silence after a minute. “Question is, how many of ‘em are gonna die before we actively fight back, not just defensively, but offensively?”
“I’m sure you’ve got some good stories, Dean Winchester. You always do.” She laughed. “I’ll give you a ring sometime.”
Cas sighed, “Me too.”
But it’s going to be kissing and Dean just needing to feel Cas, touch him, know he’s there, that he’s alive.
“Not yet, there wasn’t any time to stop for food before the bus came in.”
“I’m more than pleased to be part of this family. I’ve felt like you all took me in from the very beginning and there’s truly no one else I would rather be with than Sam.” She hugged Sam’s and kissed him. “I love you, Sam.”
“I was free then, to make my own choices.”
“So does that mean you’re Fred and I’m Ginger?”
Officers began shouting orders and people began running. Putting emotions aside, Castiel took off sprinting the rest of the way towards the hangar. The explosions became more intense, the sound of gunfire filling the air, destroying the peace of the morning Cas had woken up to. There had to have been nearly a hundred Japanese planes attacking the base and he knew that the battleships and destroyers docked at Ford Island had probably been sunk. As Cas tried to find a calm center somewhere deep inside himself, he sent a prayer of thanks to Heaven that nearly all of the aircraft carriers were out at sea. If they had been sunk along with the rest of the fleet, it would have gravely crippled the Navy’s strongest force.
Hi, I know you'll probably never see this, but I read A&A months ago and it's been eating away at me that I never knew exactly how it ended. If you know how you wanted to end the story, I'd love to know. Thanks and hope hope you're doing well
“Sexier than Errol Flynn? Yes, I do.”
“Only a month?” Cas raised an eyebrow and Dean started coughing. Cas was always physically forward, but it was unexpected whenever he was verbally forward.
“Well, you come back any time you like, Cas. We would love to have you.” She gave him another hug and a kiss on the cheek. “I wish you safe travels and good students. And Dean,” She turned her sights on her son now. “You keep us informed of how Cas is doing. I’d like to know.”
Though Cas was also asked about marriage, there was a general understanding that he could still find a woman even if he was significantly older than her. With Anna, they expected her to marry while she was still in her early 20s, least no man would want her when she got older than 25 or 26. She made remarks about not wanting a man who wouldn’t want her after 25 and received a reprimand from their mother. Both Cas and Anna found the whole thing disgusting, a symptom of a broken system they both desperately wanted to fix or to leave.
“Yes, my little sister. If she could, she would probably join the Navy as well, but only if she could fly. She has no interest in being a secretary, really.”
“But first, breakfast. The edible kind.”
“I told you, I don’t feel like dancing.”
“Nonsense!” Mary chided. “It’s no trouble at all.”
“It is.” Castiel nodded. “I don’t know if you had any intention of shopping, but it can’t hurt to look.”
Benny looked over with his brows drawn together, “What?”
“Not since ‘33 or so,” Dean admitted. “It left an impression, though.”
“So are you glad to be done teaching cadets?” Anna asked first.
He spared a hand to begin stroking himself while Castiel’s hands were busy bruising his shoulder in a hard grip and pulling at Dean’s hair. He huffed and panted before clenching all his muscles and letting out a low groan as he came over Castiel’s chest. The pilot kept thrusting into him, hard and fast, all through Dean’s climax, his eyes shut tight and hands gripping even harder until he came a moment later.
“Yeah. She would drag me out to the club every night in the summer when we were in high school.” He laughed fondly at the memory. “The gal loves to swing.”
“I see.” Dean pressed his lips together and looked away. When Castiel didn’t say anything further, he took a deep breath and said, “Well, have your reasons changed at all over the years?”
“Don’t.”
They found some railing towards the back of the beach to lean against as they ate their ice cream. To his credit, Cas did a good job of appearing more than a little dirty as he licked the sweet treat, at least any time Dean looked his way. At one point when Dean groaned in frustration, he caught the grin the flitted across Cas’s lips to show he was doing it on purpose.
“What are you laughing at?” Castiel was surprised by how breathless he was.
“What kind of ideas?”
They finally reached the bus stop, which was just a bench on the side of the road near a signpost marking it as a stop. No one else was there, so Cas set his bag down and sat on the bench. Dean joined him, stretching out his legs and crossing them at the ankles. They both sighed, then looked at each other.
“Oh, I’m sorry.” Cas smiled, showing he wasn’t sorry at all. “Am I making you look bad?”
“Very nearly...”
“Like what you see?” He asked, copying Dean’s words, but his voice was full of lust.
“Is that so?”
Across the room, he spotted a small congregation of uniformed men. There were five among them, four of whom were in Navy uniforms. The fifth wore a uniform like Dean’s, though he could tell even from this distance that it held more regalia than his own. Without letting it bother him, Dean pushed off the bar, paid the tender and made his way over to the group.
“Like a pirate captain, eh Errol Flynn?” He tossed a cheeky grin in Cas’s direction.
Depositing room keys and wallets in their pockets, both men headed out of the sanctuary that was their shared hotel room. It was another hot summer day in Chicago, but it was still early, before the sun had a chance to do its worst. The hotel offered a quaint little breakfast on the first floor in the dining area, where overhead fans spun lazily to keep the air circulating. They dined quickly on eggs and toast with jam, then left to stroll the streets of Chicago.
Let me know what you think in the comments below! :D I love hearing from you guys and you keep me going when writer's block gets in the way. Thanks for reading. You rock! <3
“Can’t Sam be happy for his brother?” Sam reached out and shoved Dean’s shoulder, throwing him off balance.
“Yup. Uh, there are two beds... We don’t have to use them both, though, unless you want to.” Dean said, gesturing to the beds, then scratching the back of his head.
Dean looked down, smiling a little. He wanted to be more indignant at Sam’s insistent questioning, but the thought of going to Chicago compelled a smile. He was happy about going, excited even. Perhaps too excited, because he didn’t really know that everything would go the way he wanted it to, but the possibility of it was too much to ignore.
“Then you’re heading back?” Sam was fishing for something here and Dean turned off the water and dried his hands and face before answering.
He laughed and tore away the brown paper. When he opened the box, a small model plane was fully constructed inside. “Did you build this?”
Dean laughed. “Why? You think I’m immature?”
“What are you smiling at?” Jo pulled his attention back to her; she had a brow raised in question.
“To us, and to those who tolerate us,” Castiel said, looking right at Dean.
Cas shoved his sister off his bed. “Mitts off, I claimed him first.”
“Operator, how may I direct your call?”
Dinner that night was a casual affair. After some talk of the wedding preparations and an update on the schedule for the next few days, Mary and John both took interest in learning more about Castiel. John’s interest was mostly military related while Mary just wanted to know about his life and interests.
Minutes could have passed during that kiss for all Cas noticed. When they reluctantly pulled apart and blinked their eyes open to gaze at each other again, both men were smiling.
“If you ever change your mind, I’ll take you flying. I’ve never crashed.”
“There may be plans for several other countries, including Slovakia and Romania, to align themselves by signing the Tripartite Pact later this year. The President and Congress have not made any announcements as to whether the United States will join the war, but the signing of this pact is a clear sign from the Axis Powers, warning against our alliance with the Allies. More to come as we hear it, folks.”
Sam sighed, exasperated with Dean’s playing-dumb defense, “The friend you said you were going to visit in Chicago after you leave here and before you go back to North Carolina.”
“It’s conceivable.”
“What makes you think I’ll give it up?” Dean teased, sliding his hands down to Castiel’s shoulders and pushing him down onto the bed. He arched his back and began riding Castiel harder, causing the pilot to moan out.
“It’s someone you like, isn’t it?” Sam said in place of Dean’s silence.
They sat drinking and listening as the musician played on into the night. When the time of the last train drew near, Castiel paid their tab and the pair left the club. They wandered down the now empty streets, taking their time returning to the train station.
“Absolutely.” Cas smiled, lifting himself up on one arm so he could look down at Dean. He cupped a hand to Dean’s cheek. “We will see each other again.” Without giving Dean a chance to reply, Cas leaned down and kissed him. It was the kind of kiss that pushed him back into the bed, cut off all protests and seemed to make the words Cas just spoke into a promise. Sealed with a kiss.
“Good.” Cas nodded and kissed Dean. Then he paused and looked momentarily confused. “Dean...”
“At the moment you do,” the younger man smirked at Castiel in a way that said he was being completely conspicuous.
“Lovely as ever.” Benny, unfazed, said with a grin and plopped down on his bed. He reached back beneath his pillow and opened a small book to pull a photograph out from between the pages. “Actually, glad you mentioned her, brother. I figure lookin’ at her face is a mite nicer than either of your faces.”
“Yes, I live in the area.” Dean could feel the man’s eyes studying him. He turned back to Novak.
The words, “I have a gal” almost undid all the excitement Dean had at the prospect of Cas not only understanding his coded song message but responding in kind. That is, until he read the part about a little town in Kansas. He smiled dumbly as he read over the description of the “gal” and realized Cas meant him. When he read the last few sentences, Dean was shocked he could ever suspect the pilot of trying to hurt him.
“Go roller skating. There must be a rink somewhere around here, right?”
No one in the United States knew that 33 warships were already leaving Japan, heading straight for the Hawaiian Islands.
They stayed in that position for a long while before Castiel pulled back. He took Dean’s hands and pulled him to his feet, saying it was time to get dinner. The night remained a little somber as they found a nice restaurant and sat down to their meal. Conversation turned to what the coming months had in store for them. Dean would return to training, Cas to teaching unless he received orders soon. As Castiel put it, he had been in Chicago for longer than he expected and presumed he would be sent on missions soon. For the first time, the thought of Castiel on missions gave Dean pause and reason to worry.
“Interested in using that bed now?” Dean spoke against Castiel’s lips.
“I will do that. If you reply to my letters, don’t send them straight away. It will probably take me a long time to get to the base and I don’t know what their mail system is like. I’ll send you one from the base when I get there.”
“Happy Birthday, Dean. How’s about we take a twirl around the floor to get those guys off your back and I promise I won’t get the wrong impression.”
“Guys, come on,” Dean recovered and feigned annoyance. “I just want to enjoy the music. I don’t want to dance.
As they walked out of the theater, Dean excitedly spoke of his favorite parts in the film, torn between one of the duels and the grand escape at the end. Castiel laughed at him and just shook his head.
Cas chuckled, “A cot will be just fine, Mrs. Winchester. Anything is a step up from the metal slabs they call beds on my ship.”
“What is it, Sammy?”
was only damaged, not sunk, but it was a blow that hit every naval man across the country. Their brothers had fallen, and they were just the first. How many more would perish once war was officially declared?
“Fair enough.” John gave a lopsided grin at that. “What’s your rank? You’re an officer, I noticed.”
“The end of prohibition left little reason for them,” Novak nodded.
It seemed, though, that normal civilians just weren’t very interested in flying places to travel and only mail got where it was going by air. While Castiel was rather tempted to take a train to Illinois and borrow one of his father’s planes to fly to Lawrence, that would require more explaining than he was interested in providing. It would also, likely, look rude to flaunt a personal aircraft at a small town wedding. So it was, he bided his time, instead, waiting to reach his destination.
“Yes, I... suppose you’re right.” Castiel looked at Dean and there was a depth in those blue eyes that was missing a moment ago. A child giggled as her parents lifted her up between them, each holding one of her hands. They gave her a swing, as if she was taking one huge leap forward. It drew the attention of both men and when Dean turned back to Castiel he saw a smile where there was once a frown. “Perhaps I should think the way you do, Dean.”
“That’s it, I’m catching the next train to Chicago and tracking your sister down. She’s going to teach me to fly.” Jo set her fist down on the table in quite the decisive manner. “Then we’re going to walk straight into the Navy recruitment office and insist that they take us both.”
“Can anyone believe we’ll come back, with war looming overseas?” Castiel challenged.
“Hey now,” Page called after him. “You came out here just to ask a question and leave?”
“No, that won’t be necessary. Best if she doesn’t know who I am at all.”
Novak shook his head, “No, I grew up further south in Illinois, a city called Pontiac. I moved to Chicago when I joined the navy. Where are you from?”
“I’m sure you will if you come back to Lawrence again.”
“C’mon, Cas, this will be swell,” Dean tugged him towards a counter where they each rented a pair of metal skates to strap onto their shoes.
“If it worked for Marie Antoinette...” She said, dramatically spearing a chunk of cake and holding it up.
Late at night, Dean was usually tired enough from the day that he didn’t do too much thinking before sleep. The few days after his letter from Castiel, though, Dean found himself thinking more of the pilot than of home. He thought about the cold Chicago night, thought about being huddled in a photobooth, thought about the press of the other man’s lips. It left him warm inside and wishing they’d had time for more. When he did fall asleep, Dean dreamt of mythical summer nights in a hypothetical bed with a very real man who was too far away.
“I’m glad you did. Wow, it’s really good to hear from you. To hear you.”
“Neutrality patrol, mostly,” Novak shrugged. “Aboard the
“Kidding you, I am not. Now help me unload it all and I’ll give you some for free.” Bal patted Inias on the shoulder and any men around clammered to help him unload the cargo with the promise of free stockings. Of course, they had to stop long enough for Bal to explain himself to the commanding officer who eventually arrived to chew him out. Though he got away with a slap on the wrist and a promise to give a stash of stockings to said officer.
“I’ll write to you on the train.”
“Well, I--” Dean cleared his throat, wondering if she could somehow magically tell that he was interested in men. He seized up. “It’s not that I--” He didn’t want to insult her, either, but didn’t know how to explain.
“Are you cold?”
“No, my love life is completely lacking right now; this is why I need to live vicariously through you,” Anna scoffed a laugh.
“--Because you’re the oldest and a man, then I have to have some way of getting my share of the money out of you.”
“So, Jess, how’s the bank treating you?” Dean asked, changing the subject.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You should try not to think sometimes. Being dumb makes it easier.” He winked.
“How do you mean?” Castiel rested his head against the swing chain but kept his eyes on Dean.
“I get that way, when I’m on break from school.”
After bidding farewell to his friends, and a healthy dose of banter between them, Cas purchased his train ticket and set off for Kansas. By the time he got there, Dean would already be home for the wedding, and every mile closer Cas got, the more excited he became. He felt like a schoolboy again, the night before a big sports game or school dance.
“Yeah! What the hell? Are you okay?” Gabe chimed in.
“Think the maids took notice that we only used one bed?” Dean smirked.
Thanks so much to everyone for reading, for your support, your kind comments and words of encouragement. This story exists because of people who keep reading it. (Well, and because I love it so much, myself!) Anyway, a great big THANK YOU to all of you! With any luck, the next chapter won't take 7 months to come out. :P
“I don’t know. You’re a clever man. Figure it out.” Anna shrugged elegantly, wearing a grin that said she knew very well that it wasn’t that easy.
Or maybe “the best friend I have”
“How much what?”
“Because, it’s your birthday. We gotta hook you up with someone. Ya’ just might get lucky, too.”
Castiel sighed and turned his gaze to the sky. The sun was already starting to lower; there wasn’t much of the day left. “All good things must come to an end, as they say.”
“I’m somehow not surprised you’re a fan,” Castiel grinned and nudged Dean in the ribs.
“Thanks, Dean. That means a lot.” Sam hugged Dean again before Dean pushed him aside to give Jess a big hug.
Castiel woke the next morning with Dean curled around him. He was lying on his back and Dean was sprawled across his chest, head tucked up against Cas’s neck, arm draped over his torso. He was relatively trapped by the slumbering man and had to very carefully extricate himself without waking Dean. It was tricky work, but as Castiel stood from the bed, Dean shifted and nuzzled into the bed pillow and curled into the blankets. Moving quietly through the room, Castiel gathered up all his belongings. He washed up quickly in the bathroom and packed away those items. Everything else was packed the previous afternoon.
“Did he?” Castiel looked up from where he had been focused on washing his arms.
“Novak Residence,” her chipper young voice said and Cas smiled.
“That should be my line.”
Just then the timer buzzed and, still smiling that smile, Mary got up to turn the cookies around in the oven. Saved by the bell, Dean quickly changed the subject.
“I’m happy for you,” Sam finally said.
Dean’s tongue swirled around the head of Cas’s shaft before he began sucking, bringing him fully hard. Castiel was quiet by nature, but in this he wanted Dean to know he was appreciated. Soft sighs emanated from his throat with interspersed hitches of breath as Dean found a sensitive spot. The solder made pleased noises, akin to chuckles, whenever Castiel gasped. Heady though he was from the pleasure, it made Cas smile.
“I’ll figure something out. So what about you? Are you last minute shopping, too?”
“Planes, man. They crash way too often, I’d rather take a car any day.”
“Yeah, could be a nice night to walk,” Dean nodded.
“Though we would say something very nice in the eulogy, I’m sure. Here lies our dear, beloved mother. Done in by shock when she once, quite by chance, supported her strong-willed, feminist daughter. The horror of what she had dared to believe was possible was too much to bear, and she keeled over on the spot.”
“Guess we’re grounded for now, eh?” Gabe frowned at Cas.
“Alright, Mr. Winchester,” the man checked his files, made a few notations, then moved to the set of keys hanging on the wall. “You’ll be in room 205, will you be needing both keys?”
“Did you bring any KY?” Castiel asked, placing kisses along Dean’s shoulder now, brushing his nose against the crook of Dean’s neck.
Lifting himself up, Castiel looked down into Dean’s face, studying the look on it. He seemed bewildered, content, happy. Dean’s eyes, such a bright green in the mid-morning light, were beautiful and honest. Not having any words of his own, Castiel leaned in and pressed a soft, slow kiss to Dean’s lips. There was no tongue, no hunger, just pure adoration. The sound Dean made was close to a whimper and Castiel smiled. As he pulled away, he brushed his nose against Dean’s and laughed. “You bring something out in me.”
“Just my little brother. I told you he’s getting married, well, they set the date. May 31st.”
“A little, mostly kind of boring,” Dean chuckled. “I feel like I should be doing something.”
“I don’t know, it might just,” Cas deadpanned.
“They do!” Dean sniffled dramatically.
“You’re very handsome, Dean.” His voice sounded sleepy, even in his own ears.
Dean looked up at Ash, then over at Benny, who had been reading a book at the time. His book was held open against his chest as the big bear of a man looked back at Dean. “A US ship was attacked near Iceland. Eleven guys died.”
With a laugh at that comment, Cas let the subject drop, especially because Dean peeked one eye open and smiled when he laughed. Then Dean hugged his arms a little tighter around Cas, pulling him in. They were already all wound up in each other, but being a little bit closer was nice, all the same.
When the Colonel was done calling attention, in a grave voice he made an announcement. “At approximately 0800 this morning, Japanese bombers attacked the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii. The attack lasted until approximately 1000. 18 ships have been sunk or otherwise destroyed and the casualties number in the thousands, with hundreds more wounded. Hundreds of aircraft were destroyed or damaged, however the Navy’s aircraft carriers were at sea at the time of attack and were thus spared. Tomorrow, President Roosevelt will meet with a Joint Session of Congress. It is presumed that, at that time, The President will make a statement on the United States standpoint on entering the war. We will keep the families of those lost at Pearl Harbor in our thoughts and prayers and may God help us all.”
Dinner was a clatter of dishes and utensils and comments on how good all the food was. Everyone complimented Mary and she thanked the kids for all their help. They went around the table talking about the good things in life and the little joys they all experienced throughout the year. When everyone had their fill, Dean and Sam cleared the table, letting Mary and Jess take it easy. They came back with pumpkin pie and dessert plates. Pie was cut and served and everyone’s glasses were refilled, but before anyone could dig in, Sam interrupted them.
“I got your next round, Brother.” Benny patted him on the back and flashed one of his charming, southern boy smiles.
“Yeah, guess so.” Aaron looked out across the base again, then sighed and returned his attention to Cas. “Thanks Lieutenant.”
Her face softened into a bittersweet smile, “It’s a shame you have to go already.”
Castiel hitched a leg up, hooking it around Dean’s thigh, arched his back so their torsos met in a hard line and buried his hands in Dean’s hair. There was no rush in their kiss this time, but the passion was equal to the first time they had sex. It was a much deeper passion, not born of lust for each other, but something different. It made Castiel’s chest feel tight; it both thrilled and terrified him. At what point did Dean Winchester wake this long forgotten emotion in him? At what point did his whole world become a better place just because Dean was in it? And what did that mean?
“So our anniversary is January 18th, then. It’s settled. We are officially romantic saps.”
Sighing deeply, Castiel stood. He fished his wallet from his pocket and dropped some money on the table for their coffee. “Let’s go find that trail.”
“How could you not?”
“You don’t go?” Castiel asked without judgement in his voice.
“Would you like the boxes taped closed or will you be eating these now?”
“I missed you...” Cas breathed, then stroked his hand up and down Dean’s thigh.
“Not as much fun as watching you undress...” Dean shrugged, stepping forward to take Cas’s jacket in hand. He pulled the man closer and tipped his head down until their foreheads were touching.
“Peachy keen,” Anna flashed another smile and shrugged. “Maybe a little hungry.”
“I’m sorry, Dean...” He said quietly, nuzzling into the crook of Dean’s neck.
Dean was out on the training field doing the morning routines. The soldiers started the morning jogging at daybreak and a few hours later, they were running through reps of pushups, jumping jacks, and situps. Drill Sergeants shouted at their soldiers, counting and calling orders. It was cold and rainy, but the workout kept the men warm enough. By late morning, the loudspeaker mounted on the side of the building blared to life and the Sergeants called their men to stop and listen for the announcement. Dean caught his breath and glanced over at Benny with question in his eyes.
“Good! Good, everything has been really good.” Dean laughed again and Cas could imagine his smile. “Sam proposed to Jess last night. Finally.”
“I didn’t know you had such a sweet tooth.” Dean looked around the shop, inspecting the boxes of candies already packaged and the display window housing a variety of truffles.
Their eyes met and the corner of Dean’s lips turned up. “Fiesty, huh?”
Dean grinned and kissed his way up Castiel’s body, laying on top of him. He folded his hands over Castiel’s chest and rested his chin on them. “Best breakfast I know.”
They were interrupted when the small strip of photos dropped down into the slot, finished developing and slightly damp from chemicals. Castiel reached out and took the strip, looking at the four small photographs of them together; Dean peered over his shoulder. The photograph of them kissing made them both smile.
“Oh, is that it?” Castiel smirked, not missing the compliment. “How do I look, then?”
“Yes, NS Great Lakes, it’s about an hour north by train. I just got back from the Caribbean last month.”
Dean shrugged again. “Not anyone in North Carolina.”
He nodded and so did she, leaning back in her chair.
Dean walked over to where the girls were all listening to the music and a couple of them tittered and giggled when they saw him in uniform. This probably wasn’t the ideal way to listen to a song from Cas, but there wasn’t much choice in the matter. The song was mostly instrumental at the start, before Glenn Miller began to sing, three short verses and one couplet, all about how there was nothing he wanted but to be near to his lover. No pale moon, no conversation, no soft light nothing delighted him so much as the nearness of who he was singing to.
For the past two months, they had sent each other letters filled with hidden messages. They found ways around words to say that they missed one another and sent shockingly romantic songs back and forth. Lust was a thing Cas had been familiar with -- attraction, physical need -- but love was a whole new game. Actual, genuine love. It made his heart feel heavy and it made his stomach do the strangest things.
“It isn’t my birthday yet and I’m always allowed to give you gifts.” He pulled from his pocket a small box which contained two strawberry buttercream candies, Anna’s favorite.
“I prefer training to neutrality patrol. Preparing the new cadets is more important to me than watching the horizon for enemies that aren’t interested in where I’m patrolling.”
The other man chuckled quietly and slung an arm over Dean as he rolled onto his side. He placed a few kisses to Dean’s chest, then nuzzled into his shoulder. “Yes, it was.”
“Taking care of superior officers, very good behavior, soldier.”
“Yes, why would I be talking about anyone else?”
“Hey, I never turn down a sample!” He carefully plucked a brown cube from the tray and popped it into his mouth. As he chewed, Dean nodded and smiled, making a sound of appreciation. “Those are pretty good! They really do just melt, too, don’t they?”
“You didn’t have to buy me anything, Dean.” Castiel said quietly, standing by his side.
Once they got to the bedroom, Dean set the bags down, closed the door and turned to Cas. “Hey...”
“Dean, it’s Christmas time,” she turned around and brandished her pot holder at him. “The War itself has taken a break for the holiday, don’t you think we should too?”
“If the shoe fits!”
Dean laughed and then spooned some cereal into his mouth.
A cocky grin touched Dean’s lips and he rolled his hips carefully. Cas gasped, tipping his head back and closing his eyes completely.
“No, I’ve got the night off and nothing interesting planned otherwise.” The pilot downed the remainder of his drink and set it on the tray of a waiter passing by them.
“Spacers, I guess.” He shrugged. “We’ll have to fabricate something that will hold the belts in place so they don’t shift when you’re diving and dodging.”
“I know,” Cas repeated, leaning down to press a kiss to Dean’s forehead. They both closed their eyes and Dean wound his arms around Castiel’s waist, hugging him. Dean hoped Castiel felt the same way as he did. He thought surely this morning proved it, but he remained insecure, anyway. What would change when they were apart? Castiel was older, more mature, higher ranking; what if this weekend was more of a fling? What if he saw Dean as a child, and didn’t take it seriously? Too many of these what-ifs plagued Dean and he tightened his arms around Castiel a little more. He couldn’t bring himself to ask, to look so desperate, or to chance admitting he loved Cas if the pilot might not return the feelings.
Dean couldn’t quite meet his gaze. “All the same.”
“Shucks, I’m not so great at dancing,” Dean said, shrugging helplessly and frowning at them.
“It would seem so.”
“So why not take the risk and let yourself fall in love? Yeah, you might get shot down, but if you don’t, isn’t it worth the risk?”
They made their way inside and took the stairs to Dean’s floor and walked slowly through the hallway to the door. Castiel took Dean’s hand and held it tightly on the short walk, while they were alone. Back in the room, Dean closed the door and pulled Castiel to a stop before he could go too far into the room. He leaned back against the door and lifted Cas’s hands to rest on his shoulders. With a laugh, Cas obliged and stepped forward until their hips were touching.
“Winchester, sir.” Dean nodded formally, but remained at ease otherwise. “Dean Winchester. Always glad to add to our side of things.”
“Your mom will be safe,” Cas was confused by this.
The laugh Dean let out was gruff and throaty. “Because you’re so very much older than me... Now give me something more than your fingers.”
“Maybe next time,” Dean nodded. “When I come back in the summer.”
“Alright,” he folded the corner of the page in his book and set it aside, then pushed himself up out of his chair with a groan. “Your old man is getting old.”
“January 17th.” There was a pause. “I kept my ticket from the Aragon.”
“If you want a hint, I would say don’t give anyone a salt shaker.” Jo laughed and he glared at her.
“Oh, I know. I just miss you. My boys have grown up so fast.” She smiled at Sam and Jess, who sat leaning towards one another and smiling. Releasing Dean, she took her seat between John and Dean.
“Your anger keeps you fighting and we should keep fighting until people like mother and father see women as equals.”
The flight deck was dangerous and busy and no one ever stopped moving while they were on it. Once the plane was out of the way, Cas popped the cockpit hatch and jumped out, calling down to the service crew. “My guns started jamming. Gabe’s too and a few others. That’s a problem.”
“Well, he’s smart. Maybe he just saw you for who you are, when others don’t.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked quietly.
Dean mumbled something again and didn’t seem to want to wake up.
“Or something,” Cas leaned his head on Dean’s shoulder for the briefest moment before straightening up again. Dean had to resist the urge to wrap an arm around the man beside him.
“Tell me about him.”
“They had quite the stash of stockings. The plane is full of boxes.”
“Must be. But parachute wouldn’t do him too much good if the plane explodes.”
“Of course!” Said in a teasing echo. “I’ll see you then. Love you, brother.”
“It worked, though.”
“C’mon, Cas...” Dean closed his eyes and tipped his head down, as if to hide. “I think you were on that train for too long.”
“Ship,” Benny corrected, and Dean glared at him.
“Isn’t there some manner of dress code involved?” He studied the younger man’s face fondly, wanting to remember that serene look that calmed Dean’s features.
“Cas! You’re home!” She said happily, hugging him. He caught her and gave Anna a squeeze about the waist before setting her down.
At that time, Ash stopped reading and leaned down over the side of his bed to look at them, “What are you two bozos yammering about?”
“Kiss for the road?” Dean offered. Castiel didn’t answer, instead he leaned forward and pressed a long, hard kiss to Dean’s lips. To his credit, the half asleep man returned it in equal measure. They held onto each other like lifelines and even as the kiss broke apart, they kept their faces pressed together, eyes closed.
They wilted instantly and turned their eyes to Novak, “How about you, sailor?”
By the time they were alone on the street, far from the bus stop, Cas covertly took Dean’s hand in his and gave it a quick squeeze. He looked up at the other man. “I... I missed you.”
They didn’t need to rush; nothing was about to end. For now, they had all the time in the world to learn each other, the taste and scent and feel of each other’s bodies, and they were going to make the most of it. Castiel slid his hand up to Dean’s neck, his fingers catching on the chain of Dean’s dogtags, tugging it up a little. When Dean broke their slow kiss, he trailed his lips down Castiel’s jaw and to his neck, causing the pilot to tilt his head back, eyes still closed, and heave a broken sigh of want.
Everyone stopped and looked at Sam, but he turned to Jess and took her hands in his. “Jessica, you’ve been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I love you more than I know how to say.”
“What? Everyone likes him.” Dean waved it off. “We should see this film. Look, it’s about sailors. You’re a sailor, kind of.”
“Does this mean there will be two Christmas proposals in your family?”
“No, in North Carolina. We write letters.”
“Oh shit...” Dean gasped as well. He couldn’t handle it all anymore, the combined pleasure plus that command in Cas’s deep voice. Dean’s muscles clenched and he stilled for a moment, groaned and came as Cas stroked him. The pilot milked him for all he was worth and he came hard, for a long time. After Dean caught his breath again, still riding waves of pleasure, he looked into Cas’s face. “Now you...”
“Don’t I,” Dean laughed. “Take care of yourself, Jo. I’ll see you around.”
Castiel laughed into the kiss, but returned it just the same. They shared lazy kisses until Castiel had to pull out of Dean and they both moved to get cleaned up. Both men were a little wobbly on their feet and laughed more when Castiel nearly lost his balance on the trek to the bathroom. Standing before the mirror, Dean surveyed his shoulder and shook his head, “You’ve got quite a grip on you, you know that?”
“I may be back again while I’m still stationed here. What’s your name, miss?”
Dean caught sight of the girl Ash was pointing out and cleared his throat. One day while the trio was talking about girls, Dean blurted out that he liked dark hair; he was picturing Cas at the time, of course. “Yeah, uhm, guess I do.”
“Damn.” Dean shook his head. “Did you see any action the last time you were out?”
“I don’t have to tell you any more, you know.”
“Alright, well, let me give you a kiss before you go!” Jessica dried her hands and walked over to him, arms out.
Dinner was served, so they all began eating, murmuring compliments to Mary for her fine cooking. Conversation turned to idle chatter about what was going on around town and in the world. A few words were spoken on what was heard about German action in Europe and how astonishing it was that someone could be so apparently evil.
“You know how you said he’s very smart and doesn’t realize it? I think maybe you’re very dumb and don’t realize it.”
“Yes... I was looking for an Ozzie Nelson record. It wouldn’t be new, though.”
“You looking better in my hat than I do isn’t fair.”
“Thanks, Dad.” Dean had to smile, it wasn’t often he got compliments from his dad, but when he did, he knew the man meant what he said.
They all greeted him in return, welcoming. The man in the army uniform, more highly ranked than Dean, he now noticed, smiled the brightest, “Ah, evening out the odds for us a bit, soldier! What’s your name, man?”
“I do?” He reached out and took the small piece of paper and read over it with a smile.
“Of course.”
“You know any good places? Maybe a jazz club? I’ve still got another day here,” Dean gestured vaguely. Novak looked thoughtful, apparently contemplating the idea. “Just a suggestion would be fine.”
Her dress was beautiful, but it was nothing compared to the smile on her face. She looked straight ahead, eyes surely meeting Sam’s. As everyone watched her, Cas turned to look over at Sam and all of the nerves the man showed a moment ago were gone as he once again wore that love-struck gaze he always seemed to have for Jess.
If a military man didn’t have a girlfriend back home, he often found company in women around his base -- or in the case of Navy men, his port of call. These men gave women gifts and little was more coveted than a nice pair of stockings. It was equivalent to fine jewelry, for some women. Any men who did have a girlfriend would win her good graces with such a gift.
“I know.” Castiel toyed with Dean’s collar, straightening it though he had no need to. “We can continue to write letters. Keep in touch, so we can meet again.”
“Then why doubt that you love each other?”
“What? Oh, no. Just the thought of flying over the ocean. How do you do it?”
Cas wanted to make a remark about reading his messages, but bit his tongue. “Yes, a little later this month.” He gestured with the paper. “It’s from my sister.”
“Thank you,” Jo raised her shoulders and smiled broadly at Dean.
“Castiel,” the pilot corrected.
All the more reason Dean wanted to enjoy his stay in Chicago. He had plans to visit the famous Aragon Ballroom later that night. Glenn Miller was playing tonight and while Dean most appreciated the dive bars and jazz clubs, it would be a travesty to miss a trip to the Aragon. After Dean finished his leisure time wandering the blustering winter streets of the city, he returned to his small hotel to change into his dress uniform.
“No, not this time. Everyone was a little more on guard than usual, though.”
“I am... I think so.” Cas felt serious about Dean, he felt light hearted at just the thought of him, but saying it out loud seemed like a big commitment.
Now Castiel looked at him. “Last night?”
“It is my birthday, yes, but I -- I mean, those guys, they think I need a dance partner, but I--”
“You’re right, it is worth the risk. It’s just quite a large risk.”
“Mail call!” The clerk shouted as he walked through the barracks, canvas bag slung over his shoulder and wide open. “Haul in!” The men all gathered near to receive their letters from friends and loved ones, Dean amongst them. His little brother, Sam, always wrote him letters, letting him know how things were going back at home and with school. This would be the first one he received at his new station.
“Anyway,” Cas repeated. He leaned back on the bench until their shoulders were pressed together. It probably looked casual enough that they could get away with it. “Did you ever see that film
“Ohh,” he nodded as he remembered. “No, I was not laughing at you, as I said before, I was laughing at myself.”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Please feel free to comment -- it goes a long way in supporting the story and honestly helps me write faster. Knowing folks are interested in what's to come makes me excited about writing more. No comment is dumb, they're all lovely. All of you who have read this story as far as you have are lovely and I appreciate every one of you! <3 And if you don't comment, I still really appreciate you reading! So thank you, to all of you!
“Men like you meaning...?”
He walked over and set the record spinning, dropping the needle in the right place between the grooves. The song began with a somewhat old fashioned sounding little ditty, cute and bouncy. Cas smiled at thinking of a young Dean listening to this. It just didn’t seem his style. Then the lyrics began and Cas paid close attention.
It was fast and dirty and as he came, Castiel bit his lip, turned his head and muffled the sound of his groans with his pillow. Having the privacy of his own dormitory made masturbating to the picture of a man easier, but the walls were still thin enough that he didn’t want his neighbor to know what he was doing at all. He panted as his heart beat wild in his chest and tried to regain his wits. With a breathy chuckle and a furrowed brow, Castiel realized that Dean probably did not have the same luxury.
“Jiggidy jig,” Inias replied, with a grin at his friends.
"I would have to leave before the sun comes up."
During the attack, Dean’s unit is fighting on ground and Cas’s squad is supporting them from the air. Crazy battle ensues. The Allies win the fight. Afterwards, when medics are helping people and the battlefield clears, I think Benny gets injured and Dean is with him for a bit. I’m a bit fuzzy on those details.
“Big words, Novak.”
“Plus, it’s an excuse to get out and go drinking.” Ash flashed a grin, then took a drink of the beer he had ordered.
“I’ll have to try harder next time.”
“Do we both feel the same? Is it serious or just fun? Will the distance and ... being in the military cause too many problems for us?”
“I’d rather be drinking a beer while I do the crossword.” He saluted with his glass and the others laughed. “Now. Down to business. Dean, we gotta find you a gal to dance with.”
“Damn...” Benny shook his head.
He sighed and turned back to Cas and Dean. “It really is great to meet you, Cas. And don’t worry, I plan to get in as many embarrassing stories about Dean as I can before you leave.”
“Staying on shore had one added benefit, though, didn’t it?” The way Anna half-smirked at him gave Cas pause.
“She was only looking for a dance partner.” Dean shook his head and took a drink of his beer once it was set before him. “And I’m done letting you guys hook me up. Can’t we just have a guy’s night out? It’s my birthday, I should decide how I spend it.”
“I will.”
Anna lifted both hands to cover her mouth, but Cas could tell she was about to completely fail at holding back laughter. He glared at her, because that’s what big brothers were supposed to do when little sisters teased them.
“I...” Castiel hesitated.
“Dream a Little Dream of Me?” He asked Page’s friend. The friend looked at Cas.
Thank you all so much for sticking with this story. I know it's been a looong time since I updated and I hope to get back into the swing of regular updates. A lot of things have changed in my life over the last year or so and it kind of threw off my writing. I'm sorry you've all had to wait, but I can't tell you how much I appreciate those of you who've stuck with me. Thank you so very much!
“This about your folks? Getting away from them?” Dean looked over at Castiel with a raised brow. “‘Cause it can’t be about getting away from Anna.”
“After that, you’re on your own.” Ash grinned. “We’re your friends, but we’re just as broke as you are!”
“Your friend was there, wasn’t he?” Benny asked.
“That’s not exactly the way I would state it,” Castiel rolled his eyes and tugged Dean towards the bed. They settled there, both sitting with their backs to the headboard, legs stretched out.
“Nah, I can manage. Thanks, though. There is one thing, do you have a public telephone? Or can I send a telegram?”
“That’s what I thought.” Dean nodded.
“Right, yeah, same on base, from what I hear.” Dean nodded to the side, as if gesturing towards North Carolina.
“Is that what it was?” Dean asked, leading them out of the rink. It was getting late and the rink was going to close soon.
“You did fine.” Cas assured him. “We need to get your plane out of the way. You too. Bal, take him to the medical bay, make sure he’s fine. Gabe, help me get this thing moved.”
“I want to remember this. Remember you, just like this,” Dean said quietly, then shook his head and laughed. “You’re so damn gorgeous.”
“Hey,” he patted Dean on the back of the shoulder. “You don’t have to worry, I’ll be back to my boring training soon. Nothing happens there.” Cas chuckled, just for good measure and to try and lighten the mood that suddenly befell Dean. Maybe the man returned Cas’s feelings more than he knew.
“Turkey is out of the oven, mom says it will be ready to carve soon.”
Maybe all Cas can say is “I’m sorry, Dean, I’m sorry, I’m here, I’m here, it’s okay, I’m here.”
“Yeah, you’ve been looking all itchy lately. Fact...” Ash turned to Benny. “It’s always after mail call he gets so down.”
“Well, glad you agree,” Dean chuckled, dragging his hand down Castiel’s neck and over his chest.
“Do they at least know how to fly?” Anna asked around a smirk.
She laughed and it was a nice sound, like she understood what was going on. “Benny explained that it’s your birthday and you need a dance partner.”
“Shut up,” Anna finally laughed and smacked his arm.
Lifting himself off Cas, Dean made short work of the last article of clothing. Cas did the same with his own, then leaned over the edge of the bed to dig around in his bag. Dean sat up on his knees watching Cas and enjoying the view of his toned back muscles and arms. When he found what he was looking for, Cas laid back down and Dean reclaimed his spot, straddling Cas.
“No, of course not.” Cas shook his head.
Sam was the only one who knew about Dean’s preferred choice in partners and Dean was forever thankful for his acceptance. More than that, he could also trust Sam to be silent on the matter. Not even their parents knew, though maybe they suspected. They asked him about girls and, just like with everyone else, he shrugged and made excuses or played it off. People around town assumed that with his good looks and girls fawning on him that he was probably the kind of guy who just never committed to one girl.
“A technicality...” Cas waved him off. Then a young woman walked up to their table, pulled out a chair and plopped down in it unceremoniously. She took a similarly slouched position to Dean and looked over at him.
“I’m going to miss you,” Dean admitted quietly.
They’re both smiling and laughing and as Dean sets him down and holds him by the shoulders, putting a distance between them, all either of them wants to do is kiss the other.
USS Ranger
“Nice to meet you, Charlie. My name is Cas.” He tipped his hat to her politely. “Have a good day.”
It took Dean a moment to respond, too busy lavishing attention across Castiel’s skin. “I’ve got one weekend to last me God knows how long. I’m going to make the most of it.”
“Just... he’s quiet. He has a different way of talking.”
“Alright, alright, all’s well, lads.” He hopped down onto the deck and walked over to Inias. Setting a hand on the younger man’s shoulder, he looked earnestly down to him. “My fuel gauge went a bit bonkers and before I knew it, I was nearly empty. I tried to radio you, but I guess it didn’t work, either. I headed for an allied base and fueled up. On account of it getting late, they made arrangements for me to stay the night. So, today, I did a bunch of checks to see if I could find anything else buggy about the plane, then came back. It’s all fine.”
“It is so,” Dean joked and led them to the nearest ice cream stand. “What do you want? Chocolate, vanilla or strawberry?”
“Cas, I’m not--” Dean started, breaking eye contact, but Castiel cut him off. He placed a hand to Dean’s cheek and kept his attention.
Benny’s accented voice cut through it all, he was speaking to the drill sergeant, asking about the soldiers being excused from training, out of respect of anyone who might have friends or family in Hawaii. Dean didn’t hear the response, but he felt Benny’s hand on his back, urging him back towards the barracks. Someone, he didn’t know who, asked, “You okay, soldier?”
He didn’t have words for the moment, instead he smiled broadly and kissed Castiel for all he was worth. The pilot’s mouth opened for him, greedily taking that kiss. Whoever was in control after that didn’t even seem to matter, they both thrust and groped and kissed with more passion than either had felt in years. It was fun and fantastic and Dean loved every moment of it. The breathless kisses, the way they were both covered in sweat in the hot night of that Chicago summer, and the way his chest felt tight and a pit formed in his gut, as he felt that imminent climax, all of it was perfect. But nothing was more perfect than the man beneath him, with his long, dark, disheveled hair, his piercing blue eyes so full of emotion, his wry, cocky smile and great body. Both of their voices had gone gravel-deep as they grunted and moaned, moving ever closer to coming and Dean couldn’t handle the sound of that voice in his ear any longer.
“If I talk about Errol Flynn, I’m probably thinking about how great you look.”
Those were dangerous thoughts, though, sprouted from his traitorous heart and watered by the romance of a wedding. He may love Dean, truly, but what could their future together be? Those questions were too heavy to consider at a time like this. So, instead, Cas would put everything out of his mind and focus on simply helping Dean make this the best wedding for Sam and Jess that they could. That was just what they did, too.
“Okay, let’s try this...” Dean said after they made a slow circuit of the rink. He did a turn and came to face Castiel, skating backwards as he held Cas’s arms, just above the wrist. Castiel held Dean’s arms the same way, his eyes focused on their hands. The way he gripped Dean tight and kept looking down probably made him look nervous, but if Dean noticed the smile on his lips it would probably ruin the effect.
Anyway, that’s how the fic ends. I’m sorry I never managed to write it. :/ I hope this helps give you closure.
That brought a soft chuckle out of Dean. “You said that when she puts her mind to something, she usually accomplishes it, right?”
Tossing the two letters onto his desk, Castiel pulled out his chair and sat to read them. The clerk’s spontaneous story had distracted him and Castiel forgot entirely about why he checked the mail in the first place. One letter was, indeed, from Anna, the other was from a one Dean Winchester. With a muted smile, Castiel opened the infantryman’s letter first, eager to read it.
“My sister is sharp; you two would get along, but sadly, she lives in Illinois.”
Dean sighed and closed his eyes. He really missed Cas, too.
Dean’s hand, shaky now as he came, found Cas’s dick and stroked him through his own release. Cas cried out, his low voice pitching just a little higher, his mouth right beside Dean’s ear. It made Dean groan and his fist pumped around Cas until he was finished. They both laid there trembling against each other in the aftermath, bodies curled around each other, hands clenching where they were. Both men gasped for air, trying to control their ragged breathing and pounding hearts.
“Promise!” The young pilot said and they all laughed. Inias began trying to gush about the planes again and, once more, Bal groaned at him.
He closed his eyes and set the letter aside. Cas decided he would write his reply in the morning, knowing he would have just as much trouble as Dean in finding the right words.
“Tomorrow. So if you write any letters on the train, go ahead and send them there.” Dean clasped his hands together and rested them on his stomach. If he didn’t, he would end up touching Cas.
“Aww...” The girl fawned. “Would you like to buy it?”
“Yeah... Yeah, I think I get that.” Dean nodded. The first thought to come to his mind was the way Castiel looked in bed when they were having sex that morning. The way he flushed, expression open and wanting. The way Cas pulled him in, wanting everything Dean had to give him, that seemed about as close to baring one’s soul Dean had seen on another person.
“Alright.” Jo shrugged. “I’ve got a job at the bank now, working with Sam’s Jessica. Mama wants me to work at the cafe but I kind of want to get away, do my own thing for a while.”
And maybe Cas will cry.
“I’m checking in, name is Dean Winchester.”
“As a fighter pilot, I shoot down enemy aircraft,” Castiel began and Dean furrowed his brows, wondering where he was going with this. “On a large scale mission, my squadron might be sent to protect a battalion during a siege. I would shoot down the enemy strikers who would attack the soldiers on the ground.”
Cas squeezed Dean’s hand and looked into his eyes. He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t really need to. Then, all at once, it was over. Cas stood up and shouldered his bag. Dean followed and as the bus slowed to a stop, he wrapped his arms around the other man. Cas returned the hug and they patted each other’s backs in a fraternal manner. As they pulled apart, Dean shook Cas’s hand. “Take care of yourself, buddy.”
Cas rolled his eyes and gave Dean a playful shove.
“As I recall, you were assisting in the process.” Castiel tipped his head, brushed his lips across Dean’s smooth jaw line.
“Night, Dad.”
“Am I?” Castiel asked, unable to keep his eyes open, but smiling all the same.
“Cas.”
“Hey Dad, Mom.” Dean wound his arms around his mother’s waist, picking her up as he hugged her. “The trip was long, but not the worst. Is that cherry pie I smell?” He pressed a kiss to Mary’s cheek before setting her back down and releasing her.
“I feel like I’ve been sitting for two days. Walking will be a welcome change.”
“Evening Novak. Decided to join us for once?” The man, a Lieutenant Page, asked.
“As long as you don’t keep me up all night talking about it.” He warned, wagging a finger at Inias.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So when they make a film about our lives, it will star Fred Astaire and Cary Grant.”
“Cas,” Dean grunted into his ear. “Cas, I need you.”
Cas laughed, “No, I imagine it will be quite boring there.”
“Morning,” Dean murmured, his eyes still closed. He pressed his forehead against Castiel’s and sighed sleepily.
“Alright.” The woman said, followed by a quiet thud: the sound of the other telephone being set down on the desk. Dean turned around and leaned back against the counter as he waited again. It couldn’t have been more than a minute or two, but standing there doing nothing, it felt like forever. He nearly jumped when he heard Cas’s deep voice through the phone.
“No, just listening to a song.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“You be safe, Dean, take care of yourself and write often! Sam keeps me informed of all the letters you send him.”
“That was... just...” He couldn’t find the words to describe it.
“Well, you boys go on up to bed then,” Mary said. “You don’t need to stay with us. I know you’ll probably be up half the night talking, anyway.”
“He cares very deeply about people... he has been sending you letters for a year now. I assume he was eager to see you since he took his leave time away from home, away from his little brother.”
Finally, there was a click and a ring, another ring and another click.
Anna was taught to dance, sew, cross stitch, cook and bake, and was given horseback riding lessons. Meanwhile, Cas learned piano, read countless military strategy books, had private tutors for math and business and, of course, both children learned to fly as soon as they were old enough. The only time they acted as children was around each other, and the two of them were all the family either of them had sometimes.
“She’s going to university right now. Studying so that she can do just about anything besides being a housewife.”
Today was Castiel’s last day at the Naval base. Classes had finished and Cas had completed all the paperwork for his students. He was given the go-ahead to return home for the holidays. The few belongings he had were packed and ready to go: the small record collection he had amassed from many visits with Charlie at the record shop, his box full of letters from Dean and Anna, and all of his uniforms. The model plane Anna had built for him was once again returned to its box and carefully placed at the top of his duffle bag.
By morning, Castiel’s back was pressed to Dean’s chest and he could feel the light trail of breath on the back of his neck, tickling through his hair. Dean’s arms were wound around him, holding him surprisingly close despite the fact that he was presumably still asleep. Castiel didn’t want to move from this spot; he wasn’t certain he even wanted to be awake yet. The sun shining in through the window told him it was past sunrise, but that didn’t matter and he closed his eyes against the light.
he’s going to be with a lady then maybe he should consider...” Ash gestured with a hand to imply whatever Dean wanted to say. “Or, you could be metaphorical. Say, little bro, you oughta take your time learning to ride a bike, take it nice and slow.”
“Oh, we will!” Dean called over his shoulder. “See, it was meant to be, this close to the restaurant and all.”
“It’s been so long,” Castiel breathed out, his eyes falling closed again, mouth hanging open.
Dean read the letter quickly, smiling to see that Cas remembered his birthday, even though the letter wishing him a happy birthday couldn’t get to North Carolina in time for the actual day. He opened the next letter from Cas, to read what it said.
They walked on in silence, contemplating the end of their night and their time together. Castiel was lost in thought, letting his feet lead him along the familiar path. It wasn’t until Dean grabbed his hand and gave him a tug that Castiel woke from his revery.
“Because this entire weekend hasn’t been a series of dates?” Castiel lowered his voice.
“Has anything else been going on lately? Other than training subpar pilots?” It seemed as if she was getting at something specific.
By the time Cas got back to port in Virginia, he felt unsure about the state of the war and was eager to know when America would finally join the cause. It was seeming more and more difficult to remain neutral at this stage. It was only a matter of time before US ships would be forced into action during one of their neutrality patrols and, while the situation with the
Dean squeezed his hand in return and looked back at Cas. “Yeah.” They bumped shoulders and Dean smiled his warm, happy smile. Cas felt lighter than he had in months.
Castiel politely set down his fork and knife and wiped his mouth with a napkin. “Oh, well, I grew up outside Chicago with my mother, father and younger sister, Anna. I sort of joke that I’ve been training to be a pilot my whole life. My father was in the Navy and he took great interest in aviation. He insisted that I -- and my sister -- learned to fly, so we did.”
“Night, Cas...” Dean kissed the top of his head once more and squeezed his arms around Castiel. That was the last thought the pilot had before he fell into a deep, contented sleep.
Cas glared at him and gave him a punch on the shoulder, which made Dean laugh all the more. He wrapped his arms around Cas’s shoulders and hugged him tightly.
They eventually managed to get all their clothes off and climb into bed beneath the covers. Despite their hunger for each other, caution slowed their progress. Hands trailed and teased over any skin within reach. Kisses were traded, from lips to neck, from shoulders to chest. Fingers combed through hair, legs twined together. Their bodies fit so perfectly together, it seemed as if they were meant to be with one another.
“I missed you,” Cas whispered into Dean’s mouth.
“Yes.”
The ballroom was the kind of place where you dressed nice, a real upstanding place, and military uniforms always opened doors for you. As he pulled on the final touches and straightened his few decorations, Dean smiled at himself in the mirror, “You’re a fine looking gentleman, Dean Winchester.”
“I may have acquired an appreciation for them, myself.” Castiel admitted and Dean laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m really glad you called, Cas.”
Mary walked around the table to give Cas a hug, “Well, any good friend of Dean’s is a good friend of ours! I’m glad you were able to stay with us for so long.”
“I’ve wanted to do that for months.”
“You’re not dumb.” Cas furrowed his brows.
She sighed and pushed his shoulder. “What I’m saying is, you’re being given a good thing in a bad situation, why believe you don’t deserve it? Yes, Dean seems to be great and perhaps even loves you, but you’re in a terrible situation together. So it doesn’t really fall into the ‘too good to be true’ category. Do you see what I mean?”
“Hey Dean, when are you going to introduce me to this tall drink of water.”
“Mother is playing bridge or something of the like with the ladies and Father hasn’t come home from work yet. He should be back around 5:00, who knows when Mother will be back.”
Dean stood, staring out into the vastness of the lake and the orange rays of the morning sun glinting off the surface of the water. Though the pier was within sight just to the right of his view, beyond that was nothing but blue, all the way to Michigan, a full state away. “This is gorgeous.”
Cas could feel his resolve crumble. He leaned into Dean's hold, pressed their cheeks together. It was warm and safe here. He was comfortable in Dean's arms. There was no doubt this hotel room was a thousand times more welcoming than his lonely dormitory at the base. This hotel bed was a thousand times better than the empty one he called his own.
Dean smiled, it had been a while since they sent each other songs, since Cas couldn’t very well go down to the record store while he was on the ship. “I think I know that one, they played it on the radio a lot when it came out.”
“I bet you have a good head for tactics,” Cas smiled and bumped his shoulder. Cas’s confidence in his intelligence still took Dean aback, because he wasn’t used to it. He had a hard time convincing himself that he was anything but brawn over brains, but Cas seemed to think it without any hesitation. Maybe that was the sign of how much Cas liked him, they did say love is blind.
The girls smiled as best they could, nodded and went over to the others, who whisked them out onto the dance floor with ease. The two wallflowers watched them go but said nothing, remaining silent observers of everyone out on the floor. Dean took a chance then, letting his hand bump casually into the back of Novak’s.
“Not Jo,” He whispered.
“Oh, that’s very kind of you, Cas, but you’re our guest.” Mary shook her head.
“Yeah. I know. And I’ll fight too when I have to, but who wants to go fight?”
The only trouble was that he felt young around Dean because Dean was young. Only a handful of years younger, but at an age where men don't typically take matters of the heart all too seriously. Were Dean’s feelings long-lasting or just infatuation? It was an answer only time could tell and the distance between them would force an answer out one way or another.
“Iceland, Australia or right next door, it feels closer to home when you know your fellow men died out there. Sailors or pilots, we are all in this together.”
“In Chicago?”
“Have you got any plans to see friends while you’re home?”
“You too, Mrs. Winchester. Thank you again for everything.” Cas said the last part to both Mary and John.
“Why was I blessed with such a strange brother?”
“Well, okay, right, but they aren’t out there now, that was in the 1700s or something. Don’t they have pirate forts or something on the islands.”
“Good question. I’ve never been in a relationship this long before.” Dean’s voice lowered just a bit as he said that. No one was near enough to overhear and though they probably weren’t listening in anyway, he couldn’t help being cautious.
“Morning, sir. Anything I can help you find?”
“One moment, please. I’ll connect you.” The woman’s voice said through the receiver.
“Let’s make it last.” He said, sliding hands slowly up Dean’s thighs, tracing thumbs along the inner part.
Just then the ship lurched and rolled. Cas flung a hand up to press against the ceiling, so as not to fall right off his bunk, and sighed. Another storm. Hopefully this would be the last. The cabin door flew open and Cas glanced over to see Gabe, looking like he had lost his sea legs. Even a seasoned sailor couldn’t stand up straight in these conditions. Gabe held onto the bunk as he walked himself in, shaking his head.
“I taught Anna to skate,” Castiel finally said.
“How do you mean?” Dean asked, blinking his eyes open again.
“It is, rather.” Cas chuckled. “Though I don’t think Dean shares the sentiment.”
“No, sir, I won’t,” Dean shook his head. He quickly finished off his food and held up his empty plate to Mary. “All done, do I get pie now?”
“How have things been at the base?” Mary put a tray of cookies into the oven, set a timer, then joined Dean at the breakfast table.
“Guess it’s more like goodbye now, though.” Dean sat up and scooted over in the bed to be closer to Cas. “What time is it?”
“I’m a generous guy, what can I say?” He turned his head to kiss Castiel’s temple, then they fell silent. They kept the pace leisurely, in no rush to find their way back to civilization. The mid-morning sun over the lake and the easy breeze whisking cool air across their faces was all the company they needed. Both men were loath to give up the closeness they could maintain when a little over a half an hour later found them at the southernmost edge of the North Avenue beach. Though no people were in sight, they could hear the calls and laughter of families enjoying this warm Saturday.
Mary was standing at the counter, wearing a pretty floral dress, an apron tied around her waist and a towel resting over one shoulder. She turned around to look at them both with a bright smile on her face, and Cas knew immediately where Dean got his smile from. She brushed her hands on her apron and walked towards them.
A handprint was left at the top of Dean’s left arm and Castiel inspected it, then shrugged, “Just means you’re mine now.” He placed a kiss to the bruise before grabbing a washcloth to clean his chest.
“That was great.” Dean kissed Cas’s shoulder.
“Me too, Dean.” They fell silent and closed their eyes, eventually drifting off to sleep to the gentle sound of each other’s even breathing. This is what peace felt like, Cas decided before his mind fell to unconscious sleep.
“Aren’t you glad I suggested skating?”
“Just like you said, it will have to stop eventually.”
“Yeah... well, I’m happy seeing you wet and naked like that,” Dean joked and Castiel laughed, letting the moment pass. Finished shaving, Dean wiped his razor and set it near Cas’s then moved to sit on the edge of the tub. He reached one arm across the width of it, planting a hand on the wall for balance and leaned forward. Their lips met in a light brush against each other and both men smiled.
Castiel took Dean's face between his hands. "My leave ends tonight. I have to be on duty first thing in the morning."
“So sex,” Dean said, his way was much more succinct. It made Cas laugh.
“I aim to please, Lieutenant.” Dean’s voice made Castiel sigh.
Castiel paid for the meal and, deciding it was too hot now to walk through town, he also paid for a cab to take them back to the hotel. They probably could have managed, but they were on leave and had no cause to push themselves and drench their suits in sweat. Back in their room, Dean shrugged out of his jacket immediately, laying it on the bed they weren’t using and walked straight to the window, throwing it open. Their room had no fan, so the breeze through the curtains would have to suffice. He turned back to find Cas tugging his tie loose and pulling it over his head to toss onto the bed beside both their jackets.
“I’m glad I could see you before you left,” Jessica said, smiling at Dean. “I worry so much at the thought of you going overseas. Sam keeps me updated.”
“You could outmaneuver them, but they seem to have the basics down.”
“Yes, we can meet by the train station on Wilson and North Broadway.”
“Alright, alright. Fair enough.” Dean turned to the bartender. “I’ll have whiskey, neat, thanks.”
“He’s a fighter pilot in the navy and a lieutenant. He does training up there for the new pilots coming in when he’s not out on missions. He’s alright.”
“Plumb tuckered out, come on, Cas, don’t you watch Westerns?”
His mother did a little turn away from the stove, bringing hands to her mouth in a gasp, “Oh, come here.” She tugged Dean into a hug, standing up on her toes as she hugged him about the shoulders.
And he’s going to be kissing Cas and saying, “I thought I lost you, I thought you were gone, I never gave up hope, but damn, I worried, I was so scared, I love you, Cas, god, I love you.”
There was something wonderful about waking up beside a lover, feeling their body pressed close, the rise and fall of their chest and the comfortable weight of their arms. It was a rare sensation these days, for both of them, and Castiel didn’t want to disturb the moment until it became absolutely necessary. When he woke, he breathed deep and slow, taking in Dean’s scent. He smelled of musk and sweat in the hot Chicago morning, in a pleasant way, rather than odorous. If Dean was awake, he showed no sign of it, his breathing was still even, his head lolled to the side, facing Castiel.
“Since you’re the only way I can contact him, knucklehead. Come on, keep up, Winchester.” Jo threw a balled napkin at him, but he batted it away quite easily.
“Merry Christmas,” Sam patted him on the shoulder and went upstairs.
At the Winchester home, everyone was happy and relaxed. Music played on the radio and everyone sat in the living room together talking about the gifts they had received. Sam was just standing up to go get ready to visit Jess’s family when the telephone rang. “I got it!” He called to the others and picked up the telephone in the hallway.
Cas squeezed Mary in a hug and then leaned back to smile at her. “Me too! It’s been a very welcome break from ships and training. I couldn’t imagine a better way to spend my time. The wedding was lovely, your cooking is great, I’ve felt as if I was at home! Probably more so than at my actual home.” He chuckled.
