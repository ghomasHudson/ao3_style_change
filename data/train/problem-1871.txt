“God, you beautiful thing,” he declares, reverently cupping Sherlock's face with one palm. “Just look at you.”
It’s as though she’s flayed him open and laid bare all his deepest secrets, all within a glance. It reminds him not to a small degree of Sherlock; but with none of his delight, or oddly endearing lack of tact. It's then that he realizes, without any doubt, that she’s somehow
Sherlock is just moving on to the fastener of his trousers when John stops and says, “Wait. You’ve never done this before.”
“Oh, you're rather good,” he confesses. The praise, as rare as it is, seems to drip like honey from Sherlock's mouth. It's like that bloody voice of his was designed for it.
Time to strap in dear readers; this slow burn is about to get doused in gasoline. I think we’ve all suffered more than enough now. There’s going to be a whole lot of sexy times and fluff from here on out. If that is, in fact, not your jam, please proceed to the emergency exits now.
“After that, I was careful to heed the unspoken bounds of my station, and Father returned to his usual affable, indulgent self. Once I was old enough, I was sent away to school at Wycombe Abbey, with all the other daughters and Omega children of our circle, to rub elbows with the right sorts and be instructed on all the usual twaddle.

“No arguments against foreplay this time I see,” John chuckles, his breath a warm puff against Sherlock’s cheekbone.
Infinitely better; refocusing on the case is just what he needs to get his mind back on track. As he reads, the phone buzzes again. Then again, and again.
He angles his gaze upward as he hooks his fingers in the waistband, then tugs it over the jut of John’s erection and down his thighs. The moment there's nothing to restrain it, it springs forward, bobbing eagerly in the air in front of Sherlock’s face.
Clearly they’d just slipped off to somewhere a bit private

“Yes,” Eddie gives a mild cough of embarrassment, “of course.” He takes a few shambling steps backward, and runs a hand through his hair as he sinks down onto the sofa. “I- I forgot myself. After what happened to Phillip, getting Marie back safely is the utmost concern of my mother and I. Please, have a seat,” he waves distractedly to the second sofa, across the coffee table from himself. “I’ll ring for tea.”
He gives a pleased hum and wraps one long-fingered hand around the base of it, giving it a solitary stroke before leaning in. He keeps his eyes fixed on John's as he laves his tongue wetly up from his fingers to over the head before taking it into his mouth. John chokes and bows forward over Sherlock’s head slightly in surprised pleasure, his eyes falling shut with a hiss.
“I’m John,” the blonde man holds his hand out with a grin. The young man takes it, smiling back somewhat shyly.
Not for the first time, he wonders just what it is about Harry that inspires such patience in his sister-in-law. He isn’t sure what she did to win the unwavering devotion of someone like Clara, but she’s damned lucky she did.
“The testing will have to be fairly thorough though,” John adds with a frown. “Since the brothers have both the same carrier and sire, the lab needs to know to check a wider selection of markers than usual, or the test could prove inconclusive.”
“I dunno,” John murmurs. “That you’d laugh at me maybe? Ask me to move out?”
Once they’re gone, he’s left with only the blank walls of his bedsit for company. He sleeps fitfully; tossing and turning for hours, only to awake drenched in a cold sweat almost as soon as he finally falls asleep. Lingering inside only makes him restless, as if he might crawl out of his own skin.

Evidently he’d assumed this would be more of a monologue rather than a dialogue.
“Please, John,” Sherlock rolls his eyes dismissively. “Imbeciles have children all the time. In fact, I’d never thought of it before but, while the Philip Andersons of the world run about reproducing without thought, my own

She switches on the screen and immediately angles the phone
“God, I love you,” John pants against the skin of his shoulder, and Sherlock pushes back against him in a wordless plea. And then his teeth are there, bearing down hard, sinking into Sherlock’s neck as he simultaneously presses his knot home.
Sherlock rolls his eyes gratuitously when John gives him a pointed look as the Duke helps himself to another portion of honey cake.
Then her scent hit his nose as she preens and leans slightly into him, in what’s clearly meant to be a seductive manner, and it’s all he can do not to gag as his body reacts instinctively.
“Cheeky,” John chides, then presses two fingers into Sherlock’s mouth, groaning deeply when Sherlock takes them eagerly and rolls his tongue around them. “
Dealing with the Alpha himself is nothing short of gratifying.
,” John proclaims decisively.
“Suppose we should start thinking on who else to tell,” he announces offhandedly as sets his plate atop of Sherlock’s and wipes his mouth with a napkin. “Now that the hard bit’s over with.”
John levels a look at him, but continues on unperturbed.
. Who’s Clara? Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. When you put it in my hand, I was immediately assaulted by the overwhelming impression of a noisy row."
He looks up at Sherlock, who’s finished his meal and is sitting, silently sipping his tea while staring blandly at something just past John’s shoulder. Probably thinking about how best to explain to John and his simple mind that what they’d done was under no circumstance to happen again. Possibly contemplating how best to inform John he was to pack his things and vacate Baker Street, posthaste. Seized with a sudden, blind panic to preserve their friendship, and to salvage whatever might be left of Sherlock’s opinion of him, John speaks up.
“Yes, thank you John, I’m not an imbecile. I meant, have you ever... with an Omega. Shared a heat.” He listens to himself, his words clipped and suffused with an irritation he can’t explain, and wonders why on earth John’s answer to this matters so much.
With a brisk nod and rub of his palms down his thighs, the doctor visibly steels himself and finally rises from his chair to set off predictably toward the kitchen. Sherlock allows himself a brief moment of affectionate amusement as he watches through slitted eyes. England could fall, and John's first response would probably be to nip off to switch the kettle on.
“So, how would you like to, um…” John rubs the back of his neck as he gestures awkwardly with his right hand between them. “You know.”
“It is,” he acknowledges cautiously.
“Well, if John isn’t allowed to stay than I won’t either,” Sherlock huffs, attempting to lever himself up from the mattress.
There appears to be be something on offer for every conceivable fetish, kink or deviant interest. Which, well- he’ll admit it would all be terribly interesting to
He gives himself a hard inward shake as he realizes what he’s doing. The angry Alpha entitlement he’s allowing to simmer away below his surface. He’s no right to put any of this on Sherlock. He’d warned John, that very first night on Northumberland Street, that this sort of thing wasn’t his area. And the mystery of Irene Adler notwithstanding, he’s certainly never given John any reason to believe otherwise.
“I'm Molly!” She beams, gesturing at herself excitedly. “Molly Hooper?”
“I’m not,” he declares, quite definitely. He’s decidedly

mean?”
“There’s always something,” Sherlock reminds him ruefully, and there's a flash of something in his eyes before they shutter. “My apologies,” he offers crisply as he steps back. The only sign of emotion is the slight tremble of his hand as he buttons his suit jacket. “Please disregard my misstep.” And with that, he turns on his heel and starts up the stairs, ignoring John when he calls after him.
They don’t talk about it after that. Though Sherlock begins behaving oddly- for lack of a better word-

sensation, the last time they found themselves in bed together. He grimaces and nods, rubbing his fingers over the smarting nub. The unpleasant ache beneath his fingertips brings him crashing back to the reality of his changing body.
"Yes," Sherlock gives a frantic nod, arching his neck invitingly. "Yes, do it." The sight of it makes John weak, unable to resist the urge to bury his face against it, scenting him properly for the very first time. His hips resume their previous rhythm, snapping forward over and over, grinding deep to rub Sherlock’s swollen little cock between their bellies, until the omega’s thighs begin to tighten and quiver tellingly around him.

to have realized you wouldn’t be able to keep it a secret for very long.”
“No! Nothing so sordid as that, thankfully. It was only ever one person. And it started prior to the development of my… habit.” Sherlock grimaces at the thought of the potential scenarios implied. “I may have managed to somewhat evade Mycroft’s interference during that period, but
“I…” John flounders for a beat in panic, then closes his eyes and sighs in defeat, shoulders slumping as he scuffs his hand over his face. “Yes. For... well, for a long time now. But you needn’t worry. I can control myse—”

finally deigned to speak to him, it had been only to deliver a patronizing little pat to his knee while she assured him that his Alpha Familiae would surely be delighted by the “sturdy little chap” of an heir that Sherlock was providing him with, despite any potential delivery complications. He'd nearly bit his own tongue in half holding back the scathing dressing down he’d wanted to, but promised he wouldn't, deliver.
predilections? Fellow carriers perhaps?”
it had brought to light, Sherlock had quite forgotten about the holiday entirely, until Mrs. Hudson had brought them several packages of fairy lights and some garland the night before, insisting that the flat was in dire need of some festivity. While John had put on a show of resisting, he’d been all too quick to hang them throughout the sitting room.
While he cannot boast Sherlock's intellect, even he is well aware that the founding tenent of their friendship is one of equality. He's not oblivious to Sherlock's gender, certainly, but he's always maintained staunch control over his alpha instincts. Sherlock trusts John to see him as more than an object of lust.
“Mr. Holmes! I really must insist th— ”
And so John busies himself, stripping Sherlock's sheets and tidying the mess they'd made; no trace of their time together apparent by the time Sherlock returns, hours later.
hungry; metaphorically or otherwise. The one thing about pregnancy that he’s found to be drastically under-exaggerated is the nausea. Morning sickness? More like all-the-time sickness.
“Thank you,” John smiles at her softly, and ignores Mycroft entirely. He has a feeling that Sherlock would quite approve of that. He detaches a small white disc from the slim white remote in his hand, and affixes it to his temple. Beside him, Molly does the same for Sherlock, and once it’s ready, John presses the button on the remote to power the system on.
“Oh my god...” John’s voice trembles.
in this case,“ John belligerently shakes his head.
a baby,” John counters, “so I was assuming he’d never find out!”
“I'm gonna say something absolutely barmy,” John takes both Sherlock’s hands in his own.
Despite being little more than an over-developed cluster of cells, the embryo is already clearly exerting influence over his thought processes, via hormones, in order to ensure it’s survival. What an incredibly remarkable evolutionary trait. He cautiously acknowledges the astoundingly foreign, but entirely undeniable, desire coursing through him.
“He said you do that,” she divulges as her smile deepens. “What’s Coventry got to do with anything?”
“Well, that’s the whole point of these things, is it not? Pretending to be someone else for the evening; freed from the rules or restrictions of one’s true identity?”
He blinks rapidly, and John chuckles good-naturedly at his stunned expression, then leans up to press his face into his neck again and scents him. The proprietary gesture sets Sherlock positively aflame and squirms and he clasps a hand over John’s nape to encouragingly hold him in place.
What on
. He moans before he can stop himself, turning his face to nuzzle blissfully against John’s palm. He keeps his eyes shut, but he feels the tension snap into place beneath John’s skin.
“Oh. I- I- didn't know if I wanted to try it but…Well, without this place, I never would've met someone like you.”
John slips it back into his jacket without taking his eyes from Sherlock. He struggles to find his tongue; hard-pressed to recall a time he was more impressed.
“My thoughts exactly.”
“Hmm, what?” Sherlock looks up distractedly from his phone, thoroughly immersed in a rather fascinating case study of a Norwegian woman, born with Mulhauersons syndrome and assigned Beta male at birth due to ambiguous sex characteristics, who’d later identified as an Alpha female. He follows Lestrade’s gaze down to the newly noticeable swell of his abdomen beneath his worn t-shirt, and gives an annoyed eye-roll. “Oh. Yes, might as well have done.”
Much later, once he's done dealing with Lestrade, and the American brute has been carted off in satisfyingly damaged state, he rejoins Mrs. Hudson and John in the cozy warmth of her kitchen. His stomach grumbles demandingly as he wipes his shoes on the mat, and he immediately goes to raid the fridge, unable to ignore the gnawing hunger pangs for another moment.
you must know John, that, despite my wanting to keep the child, I truly hadn’t at all meant for this to happen. I’ve no desire to... trap you. I’m well aware that there are certain beliefs about we omegas in this regard, but I don’t expect anything of you

But his heart wouldn’t be in it. It’s not his to give away anymore.
“Hey you,” John murmurs, pushing up onto his toes to brush their lips together in a warm kiss hello. “And you,” he adds with a glance downward to where he's braced a gentle palm against Sherlock’s belly.
over being so caringly attended to by its alpha. Everytime John’s small, warm hand rubs along the knobs of his spine, or reaches out to steady his elbow as he rises on shaky legs from the floor, a warm rush of adoration races through Sherlock’s veins. It’s even worse when John gives a pleased little smile at the sight of Sherlock diligently tucking into a meal, or yawning and lying down for an afternoon kip on the sofa. A bubble of omega gratification instinctively swells inside his chest over having pleased his alpha, only to just as swiftly burst, leaving him prickling with embarrassment over being so hopelessly clichéd.
Sherlock is looking right back.
“Where’s the body?” Sherlock prompts hurriedly, casting a quick glance back over his shoulder. Perhaps if they can move things along before John finishes paying the cabbie, he’ll forget about his plans entirely.
“Yes Lestrade,” Sherlock drawls sardonically, “given that John is an alpha, I certainly wouldn’t expect
suddenly breathless. “Alright.”
“The same way that I know the victim was an excellent sportsman, recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs I’m looking for are in this room.”
As quickly as that train of thought begins leaving the station, Sherlock curbs his Omega before it can get carried away and make a scene. He does, however, grant it a small morsel of satisfaction; leaning in close to John and summarily deducing each of them in turn within an inch of their lives.
“Oh,” understanding blooms in John's voice. “Because of the…” He drops his gaze to Sherlock’s midsection.

so gentle that he almost isn’t sure it’s really there. “You’ll be fine in the morning. Just sleep.”
“That's all very well and good Sherlock,” he ventures anxiously, “but you
“Times two,” John insists firmly to the bartender, then leans on the bar and drags his eyes slowly up and down Sherlock’s form.
“Ah.” John blanches, the gears in his head almost audibly whirring, and his body goes suddenly stiff. “Was it- it wasn’t while you were… using, was it?”
“Sherlock?”
“Round back,” Lestrade tilts his head toward the small alleyway to the side of the building and begins leading the way as soon John joins them. “There’s a Christian ministry that runs out of one of the suites upstairs. One of the staff found it when she brought down the rubbish after a prayer meeting. All carved up, just like the two in Islington last month.”
. But he was weak and sloppy from the pills and the drink, and it was so easy to just climb on top of him and press the pillow to his face, until he stopped struggling.”
“Go ahead then, tell me that I’m wrong.”
“You okay?” John peers down at him with concern.
“Well, it’s hardly my fault you weren’t listening.” Sherlock pronounces decisively. If John wanted to ensure an optimal amount of say in their discussions, he really should take care not to gallivant off the way he does. It’s hardly as if he actually learned anything especially
“Do you know where to find him?” He asks, eyes lighting up hopefully.

would he ever consider growing a human being inside himself — with all its associated indignities and discomforts — a lark? Utterly exhausting, perhaps.
John bursts into the room like an avenging angel, just as she’s abandoned him to his helpless sprawl on the floor to head toward the bathroom window. While John rages at her, Sherlock applies his own attention to attempting to regain control of his limbs. He fails miserably, but forgets to be put out about it when John kneels down beside him, and cups his face between warm, calloused palms. It’s calming and centering, and so undeniably

Apropos of nothing, Sherlock excuses himself with the announcement that he needs to retrieve his riding crop from the mortuary, of all places. As they set off their separate ways, John can’t quite resist taking a quick glance back over his shoulder.
“I'm sorry?”
again, and thanks to this rediscovered confidence, the case wraps up at a breakneck speed from there on out.
For the first time that he can remember, a lull between cases is a boon rather than a curse. At every opportunity they spend hours in bed together, whiling away the days touching and tasting and exploring.
Sorry for the delay! I had a busy weekend with family, so I couldn't quite get around to posting. Also, apologies in advance for this...unexpectedly case-centric chapter? It's just sort of where the story naturally went. This is growing much longer and meatier than I originally intended, (and Irene hasn't even made her reappearence just yet!) though I'm surprised to find I'm enjoying it. I think I finally understand that old writers complaint about the characters and plot having a mind of their own!
Some time later, their bodies are slick with sweat and minds long past the point of doubt, or any other thoughts past those of base desire. Sherlock spreads his knees further apart on the bed sheets, moaning at the inexplicably arousing sensation of his hips straining at the angle as John takes him from behind.
“Yes you are.” She says dismissively as she types something into her mobile- as though it’s indisputable fact, and he’s just thick. “There,” she says, holding her phone up to face him. “I’m not dead. Let’s have dinner.” She presses the send button and he turns away, furious. He can't decide if he’s angrier at her for being alive, or himself; for pushing her toward Sherlock even though he’d like nothing better than to rip her apart. But he’ll do anything for Sherlock, even if it’s helping him be with someone else.
The murder of his first victim had been nothing more than another one-off gone spectacularly wrong. Once the initial panic had died away, and he’d realized he’d gotten away with it however… well, the escalation to deliberately seeking out further victims had been swift.
“Oh god John,
“Yes.” Sherlock confirms with a clipped nod, smoothing a hand down his front nervously, his trembling hand lingering ever so slightly over his navel as he adds, “Twelve weeks along, approximately. You’re as aware as I am of the window of conception.”
yesterday. I was in
The flat is dead silent, and the light is off in the bathroom; given that John’s never been a late riser, and it’s clearly early afternoon, it’s safe to say that he isn’t in. He shuts the door again softly, and stares consideringly at his coat hanging off the back of it. Yes, The Woman was definitely here last night. He hadn’t dreamt it after all.
if John’s only stipulations are to be the most basic of necessities for ensuring the optimal development of their child, far be it for him to complain.
Within the hour they find themselves waiting on a serial killer at a charming little italian restaurant of all places. The stout proprietor, Angelo, greets Sherlock like a prodigal son, regaling John with the detective’s incredible endeavour of having exonerated him of one crime, by helpfully cementing his incarceration for an entirely different— admittedly less horrific— offence. He claps Sherlock jubilantly on the shoulder and insists they order whatever it is they fancy; on the house.

“Do take Captain Watson to rest that leg of his, Darling,” she directs her husband. “I will scout out our quarry and formulate our strategy.”
“Yes, thank you. Doctor, remember?” John points at himself. Sherlock ignores him and continues on inattentively, rattling off the relevant data that comes to mind.
“Oh, no, it was fine,” John assures him. “She’s a lovely girl.”

“Expecting? Expecting what?” Lestrade cuts him off with a look of alarm. “Oh god, please tell me someone hasn’t threatened to sue again.”
“It’s uh, fairly certain that you're not actually releasing a viable ovum, given how long you've been repressing your cycle. So it should be perfectly safe for you to um... share your heat, with an Alpha. Without... any concerns.”
“Mary!” He admonishes mildly, instantly defensive in the way that everyone with an uncommon gift is of one another.
He arrives at the evening's agreed upon meeting place shortly thereafter, first for once.
Even more surprising is the strange sensation of relief that washes over him because of it.
With a push of his thumb, he switches it off and swiftly walks away.

“I’m sorry,” Sherlock offers plaintively, reluctantly lowering his hand back to his side. “I- I said I'm not much of a dancer.
“Okay, that was ridiculous,” John gasps for air when they finally retreat back to the safety of Baker Street. “That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.”

“You have to show me,” he murmurs against John’s mouth, gasping as John’s hand begins working his trousers open.
“I understand the mechanics of reproduction,” Sherlock interrupts his train of thought with a truly dramatic roll of the eyes. “But I’ve taken an infusion.”

Though, you’ll forgive me if I have my reservations as to whether you are deserving of that moniker.”
John’s just entering the cavernous control room as Sherlock stations himself behind a wall of pipes, and peers silently through a sliver of space between two of them. Whoever it is awaiting him, there nowhere to be seen just yet. It’s not Mycroft
How was it done?”

he hisses internally.
It was really quite an excellent arrangement actually.
“Yeah, I'm on it, yeah.” John coughs. He turns his attention to his laptop, desperately willing away his sudden erection and hoping that if either of him notice his embarrassed flush, they'll assume it's in reaction to her words. As he sets to it, Sherlock continues on, practically oblivious to John's very presence. He hasn't taken his attention from Irene for a moment; of

be true.”
“Well, after Fairfax bit me, Victor insisted on seeing me to the nearest Urgent Care centre. And then he wouldn’t leave until Mycroft arrived and ordered him off. He found out where I was residing and started showing up at my rooms the next day, constantly bringing me food and trying to usher me to my lectures. It was all horribly aggravating, and I tried rebuffing him, but he remained determined to befriend me. I discovered over the next several weeks that— despite his irritating persistence— he was actually remarkably intelligent, and-” He frowns as John cuts him off with a sharp bark of laughter.
Sherlock from buying cigarettes is easier said than done.
"Much less to worry about on an Alpha Familae’s part, in any case," he shrugs and redirects the topic away from his own misbehaviour, "and we both know how lazy Mycroft is,” he adds with a smirk, and John shakes his head in fond exasperation. “Of course, while the suppressants certainly raised a few eyebrows, the

Sherlock is absolutely certain that his heart momentarily stops before starting up again at a breakneck pace. A sound mortifyingly not unlike a squeak escapes him, and John pulls back to scan his face.

He grits his teeth and forces himself to remain still, despite the way his Omega insistently demands that they avoid the touch of any Alpha other than their baby’s sire.

to have realized you wouldn’t be able to keep it a secret for very long.”
Sherlock searches John’s face intently— he can still manage that thankfully— reading his expression as easily as writing on a page. What he finds there surprises him.
Ah! I meant to stick to a Sunday posting schedule, but alas, it was a long weekend and I was busy driving long-distances and enjoying a mini-break, and so it slipped my mind. Then, of course, I decided yesterday that I didn't like the last few paragraphs and
with The Woman, he's still feeling awful- worse actually. He was sick again in the morning, and even now that the nausea has abated he feels terribly drained.
It’s still oddly humiliating, to have it taken out of his hands like this.
As soon as they see themselves upstairs to their room to unload their luggage, he retreats to the shower and methodically scrubs every inch of himself down with his favoured scent-neutralizer. Once he’s finished, he digs through his toiletries satchel one-handed, whilst hurriedly towelling himself dry. He pulls out vial after incorrect vial, tossing them aside in irritation until finally he unearths precisely the one he's searching for. He holds it up to the light to examine the contents, then flips it back down into his palm with a grin.
“I’d have thought that after so many years of police work, you’d be well accustomed to the absolute absurdity of crimes of passion.” Sherlock arches an amused brow.
“Indeed you are love,” John presses a kiss to the crown of his head in passing on his way back to the kitchen. “In all your delightfully rounded glory.”
He scans the code rapidly, his synapses firing at breakneck speed. The answer comes to him within seconds, and he can’t help but be somewhat disappointed.
“Finally,” he complains with an aggrieved huff as he settles onto the leather bench seat across from his brother. “You’d think that three weeks in Germany would have improved your punctuality, not made it worse.”
“Well, we
“That's not what I mean,” Sherlock shakes his head in frustration. “Pass over; when it's your time.”
“Mmm?” He mumbles, before starting awake fully as his brain catches up and he remembers just where he is. He catches sight of the nurse unpacking a shaving kit on the bedside table and frowns. “What’s going on?”
“Ah, actually Mrs. Hudson,” John looks to him for assistance, but Sherlock offers nothing more than a sardonic lift of his brow while he crunches down on a biscuit.
After a beat, Sherlock’s words sink in, and John’s brain grinds to a complete and utter halt.
John cringes internally,
“I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that,” John objects. “It sounds a bit… well… sordid.”

As the pressure unbalances Sherlock and he drops back against the mattress with a surprised puff of air, John growls and takes a step forward.
Sherlock chokes mildly on his own drink at the unexpected change of subjects, and briefly considers lying.
He freezes in the doorway, the smile dropping from his face instantly when his eyes alight on Irene. His grip on the bottle of wine in his hand tenses visibly and then his face goes carefully blank before he swivels on his heel and walks away without a word.

- is typically the shortest in duration. Ten to… uh, fifteen minutes… on average.
For several long moments, Sherlock’s entirely certain that his heart has, in fact, stopped.
He drums his fingers on the arm of his chair as he thinks back to that time of momentous upheaval; to that sudden, overwhelming sense of freedom he’d experienced. The worst of it had been the confusion of grief warring against relief; the painful, undeniable truth that Father’s death had served to unshackle him from a miserable, subservient existence.
His entire body positively hums with it; the constant, shivery need to be taken and filled itching beneath his skin.

He tells himself that it’s a sort of inoculation against the dreaded eventuality of Sherlock bonding with another.
“Sherlock, this is my mate, John Watson. He's— “
Sherlock turns the small, sleek brick over in his hand, gazing down upon it with a thoughtful expression. “You’re brother’s a drinker, recently separated from his wife. You’re not close, but your trip earlier this month was to help settle him into a rehabilitation facility, and he wants to begin to mend your relationship."
“Sleep now,” John encourages, conscious of the short, exceptional heat that his bite will induce within the coming hours.
, Sherlock will be wrong.
“A former army doctor, works in the A&E, just back from a short trip…" he cocks his head consideringly. "North or south?”
“Can you hear me out? Please?” She pleads, pawing at the sleeve of his jean jacket. “Please.”
So when Lestrade shows up with the case of the dead Alpha and his missing Omega, John’s eager for the distraction.
He quiets then- for long enough that Sherlock thinks him finished- until suddenly he continues. “I was in love with her. I really

“I... I had hoped to keep things from Mycroft for a short while yet. At least until the second trimester.”

“Now,” the young man cuts in suddenly, “as I believe that John’s made it quite clear that he has no interest in a further dalliance with you, I need to speak with him.
“Okay, listen -” John starts, stepping up onto the gravel of the roof, moving closer with carefully measured steps.
“You're not the only one who knows how to snoop,” he replies cagily, pinning the sonogram printout to the refrigerator door with a magnet.
“I’m sorry?”

somewhere deep inside of him and he keens, squeezing his eyes shut against the overload of sensation. John takes the sound as an invitation to still his hips entirely, letting out a breathy chuckle when Sherlock whines in response, shifting restlessly in his lap in hopes of encouraging him to start moving again.
“It might be uncomfortable for you. A bit smothering.”
“Oh,” Sherlock blinks rapidly, staring down fixedly at John’s hand on his leg.
if the child is an alpha, it will automatically become his heir. With that in mind, he can pass off my pregnancy as a deliberate tactical move on his part.
“My apologies,” he offers automatically, but she grabs his arm to hold him in place.
“Well,” He laughs unabashedly, caught out. “I’ve never had much skill at pretending to be anything other than myself.”
“Mm, yes.” Sherlock agrees as he switches through the channels on the telly aimlessly. He finally settles upon what promises to be a passably diverting documentary about capital punishment on BBC One before picking up his spoon. “Though his immediate response to the happy announcement rather gave away the conclusion.”

Sherlock nods in assent. John was completely correct on both counts. He had, of course, deduced John’s lineage fairly easily within the first week of their acquaintance. And his statement regarding the frequency of Omega’s within the lower social stratas was relatively accurate.
“No, no- that’s not a bad thing! I

And for all intents and purposes it would appear John is right. Checking in at the front desk is a simple procedure, and none of the staff seem at all fussed by their arrival or any of the medical details that John cheerfully imparts. Their and John's air of calm competence is remarkably reassuring— despite the discomfort, he finds himself relaxing as they make their way upstairs to the ward. He doesn't even pitch much of a fit when they make him change into the offensive monstrosity they try to pass off as a gown.
“How did things go with Mycroft?” John asks as Sherlock installs himself next to Lestrade at the table, carefully levering himself down into the chair with the DI’s steadying hand at his elbow.
He’s never really thought of it. Not really. It isn’t terribly alpha-like of him but, while finding a bondmate and starting a family has always lingered

He loves it.
And then, just like that, they’re gone.
It would hardly be a sacrifice to repeat it.
“Oh.” Sherlock gapes up at him in surprise, finding
Little more than a week later, Sherlock even deigns to accompany him to Tesco’s to do the shopping- an event so rare that it was probably foretold by some long dead mystics- and when they return home, it’s to find a decidedly uninvited houseguest.
“Yeah.”
He quells the urge by pressing his mouth to it in a series of hot, sucking kisses. Sherlock pants, arching his head backward to provide better access, his pulse hammers beneath John’s tongue. The alpha’s control falters briefly, and he nuzzles against the scent gland in the junction of Sherlock’s neck before scraping his teeth over it— gently enough not to bruise, but hard enough to wring a sharp gasp from the omega.
“Spain,” John answers automatically, “I was injured at Vitoria.” He looks to Stamford in surprise. “Did you tell him about me?”
If Sherlock has found an Alpha- found

“John, I do not mean this to disparage you in any way, but you're hardly going to crush me.” Sherlock is unable to keep the hint of mirth from his voice.
“I didn’t know that you two were… You’ve always said that you’re not shagging!” Lestrade disregards him entirely to turn and grin at John, playfully punching him in the arm. “You sly fox! You bloody well pulled the wool over my eyes! I never even suspected! When is the little mite due?”

John’s eyes soften, and he reaches up a hand to stroke Sherlock’s face tenderly.

It’s easy; to fantasize about the simplest option. She’s the modern, open-minded sort, of course; alpha, beta, omega — it wouldn’t wouldn’t matter to her in the slightest what he is, so long as he wanted her back. He knows it's been cruel of him to string her along as he has, never confirming for her the one tiny detail that would have nipped her little crush on him in the bud once and for all. But his pride, vanity and selfishness had stopped him.
But thinking like that is entirely pointless.
why ever does he keep him around? John continues on obliviously. “Do you fancy a cuppa? I was just about to put the kettle on.”
“He’s had a scan and all the possible testing done. All of it. Everything looks good— fantastic actually. I checked it all over myself. He’ll need some feeding up, yeah, but that’s not a surprise to anyone, and I think I’m more than equipped to handle that. Especially if he has reason to cooperate for once.” His deep blue gaze is calm and unyielding as it meets Mycroft’s head on. “You can’t hold his mistakes over his head forever.”
“I see,” Mycroft says finally, turning to gaze thoughtfully into the grate. “Well. I suppose that
“Why wouldn't anyone take it?” Sherlock wonders, baffled.

seem more to your taste than usual.” Sherlock offers as dryly as he can manage, only to see John’s face light up with mirth; his laughter sounding out an encore as they reach the end of the hall. John presses Sherlock up against his bedroom door to kiss him again, running his hands down along Sherlock’s ribs to clutch at his hips. Once he’s snogged Sherlock well and truly breathless, he trails his lips down to mouth along the taller man’s jawline.
“He’s not my Alpha,” Sherlock answers nonchalantly, pleased with how well he manages to keep any note of longing or discontent from his voice. “But then, you knew that already.”
“Here we are,” he announces, waving an arm about to present the sitting room. It’s warm and cozy- if slightly eccentric- and seems as though it might be more suited to Central London, rather than this balmy seaside town. Two arm chairs face one another in front of a Victorian-looking mantlepiece: one rather rather frumpy and old-fashioned, with it’s faded red floral pattern, and a striped woollen throw draped over it’s sloping back; the other sleek and modern, all chrome and leather and right angles. “You like it?”

they, indeed, ‘best’ friends? Friends are generally defined as non-relations with whom one has a bond of mutual affection and enjoys engaging with socially. Inexplicable as it may be, he and John’s relationship has undeniably come to be describable as such. Supposing that the standard for ‘best’ lies in the cumulative amount of time spent in one another’s company, he could, plausibly, be termed as John’s best friend.

if the participants didn’t seem so intent on his joining in. He’s just making his way toward the exit, quite convinced that he’ll have no luck finding John once again, when he bumps into a half-dressed, particularly unwashed looking woman.
“Okay,” John’s head bobs one in a brisk, decisive nod. “So we're going to have a baby then.”
Charming.

Sherlock dithers for a moment, stepping from one foot to the other as he grimaces at the police car. John brings a hand of to the small of his back, and Sherlock forces himself to resist the urge to lean into the warm, reassuring pressure. “I’ll ride in the back,” John volunteers nonchalantly, and when Sherlock angles a tiny appreciative smile downward at him, John graciously pretends not to notice.
John hesitates a beat before answering, while Sherlock scrunches his nose in distaste. “I don’t know. Maybe.”
It's a week before he sees Sherlock Holmes again.
“‘Course,” Lestrade agrees amiably with another sip of his coffee, coming to a stop next to the carefully arranged array of body parts. Sherlock shoves his hands in his coat pockets and fidgets, well aware of what’s about to come next. His desire to start examining the evidence is outweighed only by his
“Can I get you another one?” He gestures at Sherlock’s now empty glass
The young man’s strange eyes fix on John, as Stamford begins to introduce him, giving him the uncanny feeling of being placed beneath a microscope.
When he pushes the door open and steps inside, John is waiting for him, washing his hands at the sink as he carefully studies his own reflection in the mirror.

“Sherlock, dear,” Irene calls out in the patronizing tone of someone asking their pet to perform a trick. Or an Alpha with an Omega firmly under their thumb. “Tell him what you found when you x-rayed my camera phone.”
“Don’t snivel, Mrs Hudson. It’ll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet,” he chides, meeting the Alpha’s eyes over her head. “What a tender world that would be.”
“Perhaps you too might consider making yourself more... presentable,” Mycroft suggests, nostrils twitching as he visibly struggles to keep his face impassive.
But now, with this man, nothing else even comes close to being

Once the paroxysms have passed, they manage to coordinate an awkward roll onto their sides; a more comfortable position to wait in until the knot tying them together subsides. John sets his mouth to the fresh bite immediately, carefully laving the wound with his alpha saliva— with it's opiorphin to relieve the pain, and enzymes to help prevent infection and ensure the smooth, distinctive scar of a bondbite. Sherlock's almost drifted off to sleep by the time John finally eaves off his careful tending of the bite and settles, hooking his chin over Sherlock's shoulder cosily.

“According to this maid, Marie Cavendish starting exhibiting some unusual behavior a few weeks ago.” He announces, waggling the page in Lestrade’s direction. “She’s spent a gratuitous amount of time in bed as of late, displayed a markedly decreased appetite and has been frequently sick.”

She’s playing directly into his hands. He’s perfectly amenable to explaining the case for her in detail in the meanwhile; she’s certainly bright enough that she’ll be able to keep up easily. Whatever keeps her focus on him, and not John. He’s vaguely aware that it’s a strangely irrational urge that’s suddenly gripped him, but he prefers John as far away from her lacquered claws as possible nonetheless. In fact
He isn’t sure whether he’ll find Sherlock in the library, or if he’s waited too long, but sure enough, he finds the omega sprawled lackadaisically on the divan, absorbed in a book that appears to be — he squints at the spine — in
"Mm," Sherlock's mouth quirks in amusement as he continues staring out the window. "That's the lazy way of looking at it I suppose. I see bits and pieces— impressions. From objects mostly, or direct physical contact with individuals, though I generally try to avoid that. The stronger the emotion involved the crisper the impression. The rest I piece together from visual clues, through a method that I refer to as deduction. It's a science."

wanton. I never would have known you had it in you. What a shame— we could have had such fun together. When you tire of this Watson chap and want a bit of fun, do come calling.” He brazenly lifts a hand and reaches out to stroke Sherlock’s cheek.
He ruminates on it, fingers contracting into a tight fist at his side to quell the growing tremor in his hand. It isn’t a matter of unfaithfulness, of course — he and Sherlock certainly haven't any sort of romantic arrangement between them. No, what he's done is a betrayal of
In apology for taking so damned long, here you go y'all: a longer chapter than usual, and the big reveal you've all been waiting for! (Well...one of them at least!) A thousand thank you's to everyone who's followed along, kudosed and subscribed! I hope you've all enjoyed this part, and I hope the next one won't disappoint either. Enjoy!
. I’m just going to find them, but you’re moderately clever and we’ve got a moment, so let’s pass the time.” He squats down before her and resumes piecing together the puzzle for her, eager to see if she’s quite as clever as she seems.
“So you could hang about drug dens without being sexually assaulted, you mean.” John pointedly rephrases with a scowl, and it’s Sherlock’s turn to wrinkle his nose in distaste.
“An herbal infusion, of my own devising, meant to suppress my oestrus. It’s efficacy is somewhat questionable, as I haven’t had the opportunity to test it until now, but I’m confident it will work. But in the event that it doesn’t take, it will hardly matter by the time the child arrives. At least half the guests in attendance this evening likely believe I'm already increasing. They think there’s no earthly reason Mycroft would have consented to the union otherwise. I imagine there are already being made as to how ‘early’ our first child will arrive.” Impatiently, Sherlock slips his hand down between them in an effort to ruck up John’s nightshirt. “Now that that’s been addressed, if you could just— “
suddenly, Marie’s custody would automatically be transferred to Philip’s eldest living Alpha or Beta relative. Philip’s father being dead, that would be his current heir: darling brother Edward. So they hatched a plan that would enable them to be together, her to carry their child to term, and for Eddie to inherit the entirety of the family wealth. Everyone wins! Well, except for Philip, obviously. One really must admire their efficiency. Of course, it would have been substantially
John’s always been exceptionally modest around the flat, especially for a military man and doctor. It’s obviously meant as a respectful gesture, in awareness of their differing gender class, but Sherlock’s found it inexplicably grating.
that much is definite
“I haven't seen him all night,” the bartender shakes his head, though at least he seems to know precisely who Sherlock is asking about. “You tried The Quagmire?”
“Oh,” Sherlock marvels as the nurse lifts the squalling infant over the surgical divider and onto his chest. Midnight blue eyes peer up at him from a wizened little scrunch of a face, unfocused and slightly cross-eyed, and instantly steal his breath away. His hands rise up instinctively to clasp the tiny body close to his own, and he chokes slightly on the sudden tears that spring up in his eyes and tighten his throat. “Hello.”
… Well, I
He hadn’t realized just how marvellous sex could be. It’s John all around him and
“My heart weeps for you,” John fires back dryly. “But take it from me— Hamish isn’t any better. You can’t even shorten it! And then you have this tiny baby with a name that makes him sound like he’s ninety. At the very least, if you’re going to insist on something so ridiculously old fashioned, you could choose something with a decent byname!”
He’d given in to the insidious fatigue that had begun plaguing him of late, and returned to bed for a further lie-in after John had left. He’d somewhat underestimated the extent of his exhaustion, however. When the chime of the incoming Skype call had finally roused him, he hadn’t the time to dress properly before scrambling to answer it.
To John it seems as if mere moments have passed when a footman appears at Sherlock’s shoulder, leaning down to whisper in the omega’s ear. John spares a glance at the mantle clock and is startled to find it gone midnight. Sherlock pouts slightly at the man’s words but obediently rises from his seat regardless. John and Stamford respectfully follow suit.
He’d been foolish. Taken what he’d had for granted, and never fully staked his claim. His brother had warned him, but he'd brushed it off— hadn't given the true thought to the potential risk or consequences of his decision.
Despite the dosage of his suppressants, which have always have tidily kept those sort of thoughts at bay, he finds himself quite helplessly aroused every time John so much as
They invite touch.
John smiles back at him, scrunching his face sleepily atop the pillow. It’s a small thing, warm and bright, and just for Sherlock. It makes something flutter inside of him.
The consulting detective in question barely represses a snort of laughter at that.

“Hamish,” he interjects, unable to resist the desperate desire to disrupt their focus on one another any longer. It’s successful, as they break their stare to turn to him in puzzlement instead.
“He’s writing sad music, doesn’t eat, barely talks
“Never?” John gapes at him. “As in, the whole time you've been alive, never?”
“Of course there was.” John sits up, pulling Sherlock's hips into his lap as he does, thrusting relentlessly into him all the while. Sherlock winds his legs about John instinctively to keep him seated inside, hands fisting the pillow on either side of his head. “There’s a good lad,” John pants appreciatively as he wraps one hand around Sherlock's copiously leaking erection. The words ripple like a shock through Sherlock. Something in his groin clenches wonderfully, and he whines plaintively at the sensation.
“I’m afraid it’s time for me to bid you goodnight Gentlemen.” Sherlock imparts with a touch of… regret? His impossible eyes fix themselves on John in particular. “It was lovely to make your acquaintance Captain Watson— I do hope our paths will cross again soon.”
Sherlock ignores him entirely, retreating to his bedroom to perch on his bed. Inside the box lies Irene’s camera phone, distinct and unmistakable. He feels a leaden weight settle into his stomach.
“He’s my friend,” John notifies her brusquely, “I haven’t seen him in a while, and he’s sick, Sarah. Like, ‘six months to live’ sick-”
“John and I are expecting a baby Molly,” he informs her as crisply as possible with a voice still tremulous from the strain of retching. He rests his head on his forearm and angles his head in her direction to observe her.

After only a few long, slow pulls of Sherlock’s mouth, John moans loudly, then reaches down to try and dislodge the omega. Sherlock protests with a moan, pushing his mouth further down onto John’s length and tightening his fingers on the alpha’s hips. “We’re not going to -

“Yes.”

“And if I did?” They ask. “What would happen then?” Their voice is unfamiliar to his ear, but odd, as if somewhat forced. Perhaps they’re just the bashful sort.
And so, to keep his mind from straying too often to the gun secreted away in his drawer, he walks.
He does indeed get his hands on it in the end, though the means rather outweighs the end. As the hours creep by, everything slowly devolves into a blur of pain and exhaustion. He’s subjected to examination after examination, and what begin as cheery check-ins slowly morph into tense affairs that leave their doctor and nurses frowning and concerned. He asks endless questions at the start, but by the next day, it becomes no different than anything else; just something to lie back and endure. He’s never felt so bone
Not in any detail at least, or we’ll be sat here all week.” He taps his fingertips thoughtfully against his lips. “Given the genesis of this trite little discourse, an overview on how an Alpha could acquire a nickname like ‘Three Continents Watson’ without ever having shared a heat with an Omega should suffice.”
has the kind of lifestyle or temperament conducive to raising a child. Perhaps you’ve forgotten your status as a persona alieni juris, brother dearest? As your Alpha Familiae, ultimately all decisions regarding your person fall to me.” He levels a withering glare in John’s direction. “Or did that small detail not occur to you, Dr. Watson, when you were availing yourself of another alpha’s property?”
could be incredibly useful.”
With a slow, measured thrust, he watches his cock disappear into Sherlock’s body.
She purrs with approval and presses in closer against his chest, sliding her mouth down to nip at his jawline. He catches her scent then; light, sweet and somewhat floral. Perfectly lovely.
It's simple enough to rewind a spilled drink or a bad blind date, to be sure, but being shot?
To make matters worse, he knows damn well that Irene's been texting Sherlock since she vanished. For all the Sherlock is so quick to imply the John is an idiot, he’s really not. With how often that distinct moan has been sounding out within the confines of 221B, it had only taken him a handful of texts to place the voice. And there's been forty of them.
“Mr. Watson!” She exclaims warmly as she extends a gloved hand in greeting. “Oh, but it’s
unintended.”
“And when I say ‘had’,” she elaborates with a lascivious smile, “I’m being indelicate.”
“God, now that I think about it, it’s a bit mad, isn’t it?” John gives his head a disbelieving shake. “You and I raising a child? We’re hardly the most qualified of the lot.”
Sherlock. Your hormones are probably skyrocketing.” John reaches out to smooth a hand comfortingly over Sherlock’s curls, and he just barely suppresses the gasp that threatens to escape him.
They look down at where Alfie is happily bashing his blocks together on the rug, completely oblivious to his omega father’s anxiety.
“No,” Sherlock concedes with a chuckle that quickly devolves into a grunt as pain narrows his vision once more. He clamps down on John's fingers again, in an effort to conceal the show of weakness as much as possible in front of his brother. “Thank you,” he adds, a touch breathlessly.

“I’ve secured the Trevors’ agreement to ensure the events which occurred in my library will not be made known. As far as anyone is aware, yours is simply a highly unexpected love match, but unextraordinary in any other way.” The Duke informs them over a cordial breakfast, saying the word love as another might say consumption. He stares Sherlock down firmly across the table. “It will be a proper engagement, with a full reading of the banns. I’ll not have the family name sullied.”
“Next week it is. I'm getting married,” he announces, apropos of nothing.
“God, now that I think about it, it’s a bit mad, isn’t it?” John questions with a disbelieving shake of his head. “You and I raising a child? We’re hardly the most qualified of the lot.”
for him. Also, the potential for data collection on sexual response was too compelling to resist. And so, in the usual progression of things, we began engaging in a number of progressively more intimate sexual acts on a regular basis.”
“Well, that's completely rubbish,” John shakes his head and looks down at his lap and running a hand through his hair. Sherlock hums in agreement and John turns his gaze upward to meet Sherlock's again, his eyes soft and questioning. “And that’s… obviously
Over the next week, Sherlock furtively commences in his campaign to luxuriate in John’s presence as much as possible, before his blogger’s inevitable departure. He takes care to be as subtle as possible, so as not to attract John’s notice to it, but relishes every touch to a degree he’s never allowed himself.
“Alright. You have five minutes,” Molly peers at him nervously, holding up five fingers in an adorably mild attempt at authoritativeness. Leaning on his umbrella behind her, Mycroft rolls his eyes.
“More,” he manages to force out on a gasp, arching his hips more sharply backward to provide John’s fingers greater access. “Please.”
Sometime later, he kneels in Irene Adler’s bedroom, her cruel eyes lit up in pleasure as she says, “You know, I was wrong about him. He

“Just the usual stuff.“ She replies offhandedly as she pulls out her phone.
He stops only when John returns home a few hours later, stomping up the stairs and coming to a stop in the sitting room doorway.
Finally, once the amusement has run it’s course, Sherlock rolls to his side, gasping in an effort to catch his breath. When John turns over and attempts the same, he graces him with a wild grin.
“I know,” John allows, “but can you?”
If his father were still alive, he’d be quick to point out how Sherlocks satisfaction happens to lie in finally fulfilling his 'natural' role as an Omega. But this is nothing like the small, stifling box that his father had wanted to enclose him in.
“There's been another one,” Sherlock announces mysteriously, excitement clear as crystal in his voice. “A fourth! Where?”
And so they return to Baker Street and life settles in to a new sort of normal.

"Generally some expression of surprise that my brother has allowed me out in polite company."
Good to know that he still has
“Got it in one,” Lestrade shares a resigned look with John, who snorts softly in amusement.
Head tilt forgotten entirely, Sherlock watches the exchange from behind his dishcloth, utterly agape and helplessly transfixed by the sight of John lathered into a fury in his defense; his traitorous inner Omega practically

know that your Alpha was already dead when his brother arrived at the house. Curious that. I also know he had abnormally high levels of zopiclone in his system, petechial hemorrhaging consistent with smothering and postmortem lividity along his back. Given the location of his body’s discovery, I’m sure that wasn’t the intended outcome. So what was it? Did Eddie slip Philip the pills while they were out, or was that you? I imagine the plan was for his death to look like an unfortunate accident. Rather inconvenient all this.”
The three men march out the flat and out of sight, and Sherlock lowers the now blood-soaked cloth from it’s place over his nose to allow John to begin carefully swiping at the half-dried trails of blood covering the lower half of his face.
As his inexplicable somnolence serves to attest to, he’s been feeling increasingly under the weather; a touch of flu most likely. It’s hardly a surprise really. He’s gone three years without so much as cold, and while it pains him to admit it, that streak was bound to end eventually. John taking over the physical legwork of the less interesting cases allows for Sherlock to conserve his diminished energies, and focus on fighting off whatever dratted virus has managed to gain a toehold over his immune system. All without missing out on anything that may potentially develop into something interesting.

“Oh?”
No; he wants to
“I know,” John steps close and reaches up to squeeze the back of Sherlock’s neck reassuringly. “Trust me, I know.”
John cuts off his rambling monologue with a gentle hand on his knee. “Sherlock,
“No,” John interrupts before he can protest further. “You can’t just—” He sighs heavily and sets aside his cutlery, then wipes his mouth lingeringly with a napkin as if buying time. “Look, Sherlock,” he finally continues, and a prickle anxiety makes its way up Sherlock’s spine. John looks up and meets his eyes with a determined expression. “Last night was... well, a bit of a whirlwind really. We didn’t really discuss things properly; like we should have done.”
“Probably never occurred to them to check and wipe the footage, since they assumed that it would be viewed as an accidental drowning. Right as always, you smug bastard,” Lestrade grins in return, accepting the folder back from Sherlock as they make their way to the front step. “Donovan just sent word on the NHS records; Marie’s mystery appointment three weeks ago was at the Hyacinth Lea Omega Clinic on Harley Street. Her doctor confirmed that she’s about eleven weeks along. We have clearance to proceed in performing a paternity test once she’s located, but we’ll need to get a sample from Edward as well.”
“You don't say.”
“But then the rest of your outfit is
“The most perfect infant in the whole of human history,” John agrees immediately, nodding without hesitation as wraps an arm around his little family and cuddles them close. “Scientific fact, that.”
John. Not for anything. And considering the surprising depth of sentiment he already feels toward the child, he can’t imagine it will be any different with them. For a short while, they sit just so; gazing silently at one another until, finally, Sherlock gives an awkward cough and continues.

the ones that are plenty occupied... with sucking sustenance through a straw for the next six weeks.”
What’s left of the daylight filtering in through the windows has grown dim, though it’s not yet dark enough for the streetlights. He’s warm and a tad sweaty, but the sheets feel blissfully cool and crisp beneath him. He listens to John bustle about the kitchen, putting away the shopping, and tries to identify the items based off where John puts them and the order in which he’s done so. He’s reasonably sure he’s succeeded with at least a 92% accuracy, but his mind is appallingly lethargic. It should alarm him— the very idea of it did, earlier— but he’s far too comfortable to find it in himself to be overly concerned at the moment.
you’ve made that really
John presses Sherlock down against the mattress, nipping at his plush lower lip and Sherlock spreads his thighs apart instinctually, to make room for John to press closer.
John laughs that full cheerful belly laugh that he only ever lets out in the privacy of 221B, precisely as Sherlock intended. The sound of it triggers a funny warm sensation low in Sherlock’s belly.
“So, ah, there’s this case,” Lestrade embarks in an overly casual manner, shifting a file folder back and forth between his hands. “Posh bloke, Philip Cavendish; his maid found him dead in the pool on Monday morning at about nine. He’d been out on the town with his brother the night before. Driver brought him home around eleven. Butler says he served him a nightcap in the lounge, and then was excused for the night. Figured it was the usual drunken dip gone wrong. Real cut and dried.”
is a particularly humorous story about her boss.
“Hours?!” Lestrade exclaims, jumping up from his seat. “Christ!”
He can picture them perfectly in his mind’s eye, as much as he'd prefer not to. Pale, lithe limbs tangled together, writhing about on sheets that cost more than John’s monthly salary. The alpha side of himself rattles the bars of its cage, gnashing its teeth and roaring with fury at the very thought of it. It wants nothing more than to hunt Irene Adler down and tear her apart.
Normally he'd just bluntly inform the mistaken party of their error with his usual refrain of “I’m not his Alpha”, but out here… Well, it isn’t exactly
“Yes,” Sherlock wobbles his head in a frantic approximation of a nod and sobs, completely overwhelmed by the dual sensations. He rocks his hips forward into John's hands before needily pushing back again onto his cock.
“No,” John argues mulishly, “Sherlock
, specifically, but… difficult, yes. Not always, of course. Father did dote on Mummy and I, allowing us both to partake in some unusual hobbies for our gender. Mummy enjoyed dabbling in theoretical mathematics, and I was allowed the same with my chemistry equipment and various experiments. That was… good. To be entirely honest, I never even understood there was anything different about my life until I was six. In a fit of pique over being denied an extension of my bedtime, I mistakenly divulged the deduction I’d made regarding the intimate nature of Father’s relationship with my Beta au pair over dinner.”
“Mr. Holmes!” The nurse brightens at his arrival. ”As I was just explaining to your Omega dependens, Mr. Watson isn’t permitted to stay. Only one non-professional support person is allowed in the delivery room, and now that you’ve arri— ”
,” Sally bares her teeth in a surly approximation of a smile.
Watching John crumple in on himself in front if him, Sherlock has a blinding moment of clarity: this is his only chance. Right now, this moment; if he lets it slip away, lets John explain it away — retreat back behind his impenetrable fortress of British stoicism — it will never come back again.
“Did you hear what they were saying,” John demands thunderously, stabbing an accusing finger in the men’s direction, “about Sherlock? It was disgusting.”
“We agreed it yesterday. Stop! Closer!”
“Yes,” Sherlock waves a hand dismissively, “well, it perhaps wasn’t the most
Keeping his focus on Lestrade with a deliberate air of harried irritation, he casually avoids John’s gaze as he tries to think of a way to ensure that he'll stay here with Lestrade for at least a short while. He can’t very well take care of what he needs to do with John trailing along after him.

Much later, he’s nursing a bruised cheekbone and failing spectacularly at not fixating on the recalled sensation of John’s body draped over his back again, for the first time since his heat five weeks ago. John’s hardly touched him since the incident, and it’s absurd how desperately Sherlock’s found himself craving any sort of contact. John had him in a
“Nine and a half days ago. I began feeling symptoms after about three days. But…it's too, ah…” Sherlock trails off, fighting against a creeping flush of mortification. He knows that it's foolish to feel embarrassed about this; he’s an adult and John is a medical professional. But he feels oddly exposed, discussing something so openly that he’s tried for so long to repress. “I shouldn't have gone into heat until next month at the earliest. Not according to my usual cycle.”

It preens delightedly when a pretty Beta woman sizes John up admiringly, only to frown in disappointment when she notices Sherlock. The disbelieving looks and head-shakes that two separate Alphas and one burly male Beta direct at John following their interested leers at Sherlock on the other hand, leave it puffed up with indignation.
“Sherlock, if you delay any longer the… the loss will become increasingly hazardous to your own health.”

It’s like a bloody soap opera,” He groans as a thought occurs to him. “God, the press’ll have an absolute
“Well, this is most definitely unsalvageable.”
“Fuck,” John starts beneath Sherlock as he registers their audience, clamouring to snatch the afghan from the arm of the sofa to cover them with. Sherlock remains unruffled; rising languidly from John’s lap with nothing more than a slight hiss as John’s semi-swollen knot tugs free of his body. He plucks his dressing gown from the floor and shrugs into it.
Clever enough he supposes. Fails to account for the rather convenient appearance of a corpse perfectly matching her own measurements however. A passable match would have been easy enough to acquire, but one specific enough to fool

She rubs against it, undeterred, but regardless of the pleasant, coaxing pressure, his body remains frustratingly unaroused. His mind keeps comparing her small, dainty hands to long-fingered, masculine ones. Which starts him thinking of long, pale limbs, spread out underneath him; sharp cheekbones and dark curls; deep, baritone moans spilling from plush lips in the dark.
“If I wanted to look at naked women I’d borrow John’s laptop.” Sherlock declares, wandering away toward the fireplace disinterestedly. The seeming detachment from his Omega soothes John’s Alpha ire, until he realizes he’s unthinkingly claimed Sherlock again, which only sets him off anew.
“Yeah, all right, Spock,” John holds his palms up in a pacifying gesture, “just...take it easy. You’ve been… pretty

going to have to tell him. Sooner rather than later, considering how far you are along.”
Sherlock levels an exasperated look at the Alpha, as though he’d just suggested going for a nude jog through the halls.
On a plane full of corpses parked on a tarmac at Heathrow, Sherlock is sideswiped entirely by the mortifying realization of just how thoroughly Irene has used him to betray his own brother. Though he’ll never openly admit it, Mycroft’s plan had been entirely ingenious, and it pains him to have ruined it. Somehow worse is his brother’s disappointment, and
“Small mercies.”
“And exactly what do you mean by that?” Sherlock sneers with a curl of his lip.
John can’t imagine what on earth he’s on about, but whatever it is… if
Wrong Alpha.
John closes his eyes, feeling his resolve crumbling away beneath those warm palms. He opens them again and looks to the door. In all these months that they’ve been meeting, not once have they been interrupted or intruded upon, and it seems even more unlikely here in Sherlock’s own home.
“Well it wasn't as though you did so on purpose John,
John watches Sherlock stiffly march up the steps, feels his own heart racing beneath his sternum.
It instinctively knows better than he precisely what they need, after all.
unwell and simply refusing to admit it, then John isn’t going to force the issue. A touch of flu is hardly life-threatening, and John isn’t his mother, or his Alpha.
They stare at one another for an instant, bright-eyed and breathless with adrenaline. Sherlock feels almost high on the relief of John being safe from harm, and a sudden rush of raw affection overwhelms him. He wants nothing more than to crowd John against the wall and kiss him, but he holds himself back by a thread, fist clenched tightly against his thigh with the effort.
he means he quit taking them as an experiment, and quite predictably went into rebound heat.” John interrupts to add, clearly past the initial embarrassment of his verbal blunder, and over his fear of Mycroft’s potential retribution. Well, he supposes that seeing Mycroft in person
And so they are formally betrothed. Over the course of the ensuing weeks, as the banns are read, there are countless stolen kisses and caresses, and John frequently comes to regret his decision to wait to consummate their union. But when the arrangements have been made, and their wedding day finally dawns, he knows it was the right one.
“I did,” Lestrade acknowledges flatly, leveling a dark look the two constables way. “And rest assured; I
“I’ve always wanted to try this,” Sherlock admits when he finally reaches his goal, and takes John’s erection in hand. John favours him with an encouraging groan in response as he proceeds to run his tongue enthusiastically around the tip and down the shaft. When he slips it into his mouth, John tangles a hand in his curls;
“The key code to my safe.”
“Well, he’s a bit on the big side apparently,” John gives his own nose a scratch. “Lord knows where he gets
Sherlock cries out, digging his fingers into the soft skin of John’s nape. He wraps his legs tightly about the alpha’s middle, as high as they'll go, desperately trying to tilt his hips up for a better angle. John wrestles Sherlock’s left leg up and drapes it over his elbow, planting his hand on the mattress next to Sherlock’s ribs for leverage as he picks up the speed of his thrusts. The stretch makes Sherlock’s breath judder out of him in short bursts with every snap of John's hips.

“Certainly not,” John protests in horror.
Apparently oblivious to the Alpha posturing in the room, Sherlock stands. “I don’t think John knows where to look.” he says, dismissively, as he offers his coat.
“When did you know...” Sherlock asks, settling on his side and tucking an arm under his head, “that you liked men?”
just sex.”
“Oh, just passing the time.” Sherlock rolls his head against the wallpaper to look over at him and his eyes flick downward to John's mouth.
His Omega mewls dejectedly inside of him, and he determinedly ignores it as he gathers any dignity he has left.
Halfway through dinner Harry’s water inevitably becomes Pinot Grigio, and she grows teary-eyed then drowsy in turn, leaving him and Clara to wrangle her back into the passenger seat of the Astra for the long drive home.
“I'm not going to jump,” Sherlock reassures him, meeting his eyes with a small, amused smile.
“You wouldn’t have,” Sherlock argues, making no move whatsoever to move out from beneath John’s thighs as expected. “Even asleep, you’d subconsciously recognize my scent.”
“You Holmes?” She asks, drumming the garishly manicured nails of her left hand on the wheel. When he nods sharply and tosses his unfinished cigarette to the pavement, she flicks the switch to unlock the doors. She smiles at him in the rearview mirror as he climbs into the back seat. “Sorry ‘bout the wait. Accident up Victoria Street. Where to then?”
“You mean... it’s
Except it’s possibly longer than he realizes, because when he comes back to himself John has grown uncomfortably stiff next to him. He tries to think of something to say that will bring back the hazy feeling of contentment, but as he’s searching for it John speaks up.
“Why waste time sitting here?” John asks, slipping his hand over onto Sherlock’s thigh and slowly sliding it upward. For a moment, Sherlock closes his eyes, breathing shakily. Then he jerks away, jumping from the bin to stand and face John anxiously.
"Look at you all happy,” Mrs. Hudson scolds as she pushes up the window sash to lean out over her flower box. “It's not decent." Despite her words, there’s an undeniable air of fondness in her voice, and in the tilt of her mouth as she attempts to put on her best disapproving frown.
“Tourist?” He queries, and Sherlock wobbles his head. “We'll go with tourist. So you're new here?”

It’s too soon;
Sherlock cries, jerking his hand away from his cock as if burned, very nearly climaxing at John’s whispered praise. He breathes hard, twisting one hand in the bedsheet and squeezing John’s thigh in the other as he wills himself back from the edge. “Now,” he demands, tugging insistently against John’s body. “I want you in me now.”
"God, I want you" he growls, tangling a hand in Sherlock's curls, using it to tug his head backward and expose the long arch of his neck. "I always want you so badly."
“It’s very… nice.” He says without thinking, and immediately cringes internally at the pitiful compliment.
. We haven't even
In any case, more importantly, he’s learned what he needed to know… Needed to hear aloud, once and for all. Despite his fanciful hopes, he knows with certainty now what will happen when he tells John about the baby.
“So, let me get this straight— ” John ventures warily, ”
John props himself up onto his elbows and beams in amusement while Sherlock flings the offending articles off the bed as though they’ve personally wronged him.
He waits expectantly for John to correct her, but the alpha merely offers her a chastened smile.
could have told you that was a terrible idea! What, did you delete basic biology along with the solar system?” Sherlock opens his mouth to retort, but John swiftly lifts his hand up between them in a motion to cut him off. “That was rhetorical! You’re definitely experiencing rebound estrus. It’s a kind of false heat, triggered by major hormonal fluctuations. Most common after a miscarriage, but also known to happen after sudden suppressant cessation.” He scrubs his hand over his face with a growl of aggravation. “It’s one thing to skip the odd heat here or there, but the whole
No, Molly’s been blind for an entirely different reason.
At the very least, his act seems to work on John.
He pulls the pillow that smells strongest of John to his face, breathing in the faint scent as deeply as possible. Unceremoniously, he shoves his free hand down the back of his pants and between his legs, reaching past his arsehole to find his slit already slick and wet.
had suddenly revised his stance on the merits of indulging in estrus, that didn’t mean that John would choose to cater to his desires. And Sherlock certainly wasn’t interested in engaging in it with anyone else.

getting sweaty.”
this,” John barks a short, sharp laugh. And before Sherlock has so much as a chance to take offense, there’s a warm, compact body pressing in close to his as John surges forward into his personal space. Warm, calloused palms come up to cradle his face as John leans up on tip-toe and presses his lips urgently against Sherlock’s own.
Unless, of course, that ceases to be the case.
Sherlock wordlessly turns back toward the flames, reaching out to pluck his glass from the nearby table. His eyes catch on the tremor of his hand, and he lets loose a bitter chuckle. “Look at me. I’m afraid, John.

“Still your usual charming self, I see,” Mycroft sneers, reaching into his breast pocket to retrieve his mobile and return his attention to whatever political crisis is currently brewing sight unseen. Sherlock pulls his own mobile from his coat to entertain himself with as they travel in silence. A text alert pops up and he sighs.
“I wasn’t even at
“It’s our wedding night,” Sherlock pouts adorably. “Aren’t you meant to ravish me again and again until dawn?”
“But it was a possibility! And it wasn’t an acceptable one.”

In hindsight, his reaction to John bringing home his newest girlfriend du jour two weeks ago should have made him realize it. While he’s never cared for any of John’s women, there had been something

they’re one of the omega’s own family members. Specifically, Mycroft himself in my case.” He pauses to chew thoughtfully on another forkful of egg while a look of horror dawns across John’s features. “Naturally, neither scenario would reflects very glowingly on him as an Alpha Familiae.”
“It will,” John assures him, feeling the slightest hint of shame over the strong spike of arousal in his groin that the question elicits. He skims his hand up along one milky thigh. “We’ll make sure that you’re body is ready for it before we try.” He hesitates as his hand nears it’s destination, fingers coming to rest on the smooth curve of Sherlock’s pert little bottom.

“Mm, yes.” Sherlock hums noncommittally and busies himself brushing some imaginary lint off the sleeve of his coat. It’s painfully evident that John’s incredibly curious about Sherlock’s background, and always has been. He has the advantage here over John, as in most things, having long deduced the general gist of his blogger's childhood.

I didn’t inform you sooner only because…” He fidgets in his chair briefly, scratching at the fabric of the arm in avoidance, well aware that his actions have been the very epitome of ‘not good’. Then, taking a deep, fortifying breath, he rambles onward. “I realize we agreed that it was an experiment and nothing more, but… I’ve found myself undeniably defensive of the… of
Sherlock steps back and willingly spreads his arms wide. “I’m unarmed.”

The results of that test had been unacceptable anyways, just like the previous four before it. And so, after carefully verifying John’s absence, Sherlock had opened the door in order to snatch the promised mug and set to work preparing for the sixth.

“Well, lucky for me then,” he grins back and gives up on the contents of the fridge, to examine the takeaway menus stuck to the front of it instead.

“About that,” John confirms. He steps close, tilting his head upward to look directly into Sherlock’s eyes. “I'm sorry.”

two Omegas grappling about, pulling each other's hair and the like? Like something out of a porno that was! Don’t tell me it didn’t make things a bit tight in your trousers.” Sherlock hears the Alpha PC guarding the front door of the flat comment lewdly to his Beta partner with a chuckle. He blanches, pressing the cloth tighter against his nose as if to hide behind it, and curls his shoulders forward defensively. Thanks to the angle of his head, he isn’t entirely sure if they’re just oblivious to the fact that he’s well within earshot, or if they just don’t give a damn.

Do you... do you actually want this?”

“You know exactly what I mean,” John contends. “Go sit and hold this to your nose. I’ll bring you your tea in a bit.”
the blood rush to his face. His heart flutters in his chest over the unintended slip, and his eyes shoot sidelong to John, anxiously gauging his reaction. Thankfully, neither John and Lestrade seem to think anything of it, apparently misinterpreting the comment entirely. John casts his gaze skyward, sighing dramatically.

He frowns at the large gas canister against the wall thoughtfully as his muscles begin cramp up again. Now, before he gets rid of her, surely
Much later though, once John is snoring peacefully and Sherlock’s regained his mental faculties, he turns the words over obsessively in his head.
“Come on.” John grabs hold of Sherlock’s coat sleeve and gently tugs him in the direction of the bar. He waves down the bartender and holds up two fingers. “Gin and tonic times two!’
That he’s almost certainly settled on Miss Mary Morstan, the charming omega daughter of a wealthy banker. One who will cheerfully pay a handsome sum for the privilege of his future grandchild to one day bear the title of Viscount Sondes.
"Scheduled to pass…” John chuckles and shakes his head. “Let's just call it dying.”
“Oh great. That’s great,” he grouses, “so I get to be the lucky sod to take the blame for that as well then.” He lifts his hastily discarded mug to take a deep, bracing swig, as if it contains something markedly stronger than coffee. “Well, never mind then; now I
person.” Mycroft amends almost without thought, and Sherlock smirks. Mycroft’s scowl deepens immediately as he realizes immediately how perfectly he’s played into their hands, but he answers Sherlock’s prompts about the photographs readily enough thereafter.
“If you’re going to keep being a complete pillock, trying to throw yourself — and
John joins in with a low chuckle, reaching discreetly with his free hand to gingerly make an adjustment in his own lap. He doesn’t mention it— doesn’t draw attention to it in the slightest— but Sherlock’s eyes flick unconsciously to the movement, and he finds himself pressing his teeth into his lower lip. Ever considerate John, carefully obscuring his own involuntary arousal, so as not to make Sherlock feel any more self-conscious than he already does. The thoughtfulness inexplicably causes that unnamed something inside his abdomen to throb again.
have an affair without being in love y’know.”
“And I'm dying,” John interrupts and Sherlock looks to him wide-eyed. “Whatever you are can't scare me. Let me come visit. I want to say hi.”
The thought has him drifting back to those two long, decadent days, wrapped up together in Sherlock's bed… and on, um, various other surfaces within the flat. Fingers grasping against sweat-slick skin, and Sherlock panting words into the curve of John's neck. No, he supposes he never did get Sherlock to beg for

Before they can so much as climb out from the back of the ambulance, Lestrade appears to insist on taking John’s statement. Sherlock stays silent the entire time, lips pressed together into a thin line, ignoring the concerned looks that the DI repeatedly shoots his way. The moment that they’re finally free to go, Sherlock is off without a word, trotting briskly off toward the main thoroughfare to summon a cab, without so much as a glimpse backward to ensure that John is following.
“He’s writing sad music, doesn’t eat, barely talks – only to correct the television.” He announces preemptively as he strolls into the room, turning about as he does, taking in the cavernous shell of the room. The sooner he gives the busybody Holmes Alpha what he wants, the sooner he can get on with his day, after all. “I’d say he was heartbroken but, uh, well, he’s Sherlock. He does all that anyw-” The person who emerges from between two massive control panels when he turns to face them, however, is decidedly
“Your what?” John hears himself asking dumbly, his limbs growing heavy and numb; the entire tableau taking on the surreal quality of an unpleasant dream.
“Well, if you’d been listening, you’d know she
“I’ll go slow.”
“My Dear,” Stamford smiles brightly. “Watson here is in search of a mate.” He casts an eye about and lowers his voice. “It seems that he has only his good name left to recommend himself. Harry’s squandered it all.”
“Okay,” john shrugs acceptingly, sliding off the bin to stand.
They continue on like so, gasping against one another’s mouths when they no longer have the coordination to kiss properly.
“Are you jealous?” She smirks; that same goddamn smirk as always, the one that says she’s better, smarter, more Alpha-like than him, and she knows it.
Mycroft and Sherlock sit in silence, listening to the comfortably domestic noise of running water and the clatter of dishes in the sink as John putters about. After a short while, Sherlock vaults himself back upright again, striding to the centre of the room and settling the violin back onto his shoulder. He’s just begun to coax a lilting tune from the strings when John emerges from the kitchen carrying his jacket, coming to a stop at Sherlock’s side.
No, Mycroft won't harm John.
“Mm,” Sherlock hums agreeably as he lifts his mug, smirking as he finishes the last dregs of his tea. “
The baby quiets as John’s hands join Sherlock’s, blanketing the expanse of his tiny back, and he snuffles down contentedly against Sherlock’s skin. John leans in close over Sherlock’s shoulder as they rub his little limbs gently, murmuring to him in calming tones and breathing in lungfuls of his delicate newborn scent. After a handful of minutes, John is invited to the other side of the divider to cut the cord, and the moment of quiet bonding passes. Hamish lets out an unholy screech of protest when the nurse bundles him away for a more thorough check-over and cleaning, and his fathers share an exhausted laugh over his indignant expression.
He feels a stir of arousal low in in belly at just the thought of it, and quickly moves to redirect his thoughts before his reaction becomes embarrassingly noticeable. The
“Okay,” John pants agreeably. “Okay. This once- but I’m nipping upstairs straight away afterward. I don’t fancy making that much mess, since we both know I’m the one who’ll end up dealing with it later.” Sherlock’s face pinches in an affronted frown.
Between the suppressants and a diligent use of scent neutralizers, he could conceivably conceal the pregnancy for as long as five months— well into the second trimester.
“Of course,” Edward smiles in assent, “though please, call me Eddie. ‘Mr. Cavendish’ makes me feel as if I should be in my dotage.” He steps forward to offer his hand to John first, then turns to Sherlock and freezes, nostrils flaring. “Is this your Omega Dr. Watson? Rather unconventional of you, bringing him along,” he inquires of John, tilting his head with curiosity. He pointedly doesn’t offer his hand, but instead runs his eyes appreciatively up and down Sherlock’s form. In response, Sherlock merely raises his brows in cool condescension, and makes no move to bring his own hands out from where they’re folded genteelly behind his back.
“Good God.”
“Not in a police car. I’ll be right behind.”
“My measurements.”
“Oh thank god.” John releases a puff of air with the words and the rigidity drains out of his body again. “I’d thought that maybe… well. As much as it pains me to say this, thank goodness for Mycroft’s interference.”
“Always been able to keep myself distant…” He pauses to sip at the now-flat ginger ale before rambling onward. “To divorce myself from...
“Though I’d hazard she’d have avoided the flat for several days of her own accord had you neglected to.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes gratuitously at that, but tosses his things over the arm of the small sofa and moves to the opposite side of the desk regardless. He arranges a number of the items before him into some semblance of order before starting off slowly, as if laboriously elaborating something to a primary schooler.
His stomach swoops in an entirely different manner than just moments before, and he goggles at Sherlock in total disbelief.
Sherlock doesn’t bother to protest again.
Hours later, back at John’s flat, after having run each other ragged with bout after bout of frenzied lovemaking, Sherlock sits out on the balcony wrapped in nothing but a dressing gown, smoking a cigarette and staring off into the distance. The sea breeze ruffles his curls, and cools the still drying sweat on his skin. He doesn’t even turn to look when John ventures out in a matching robe to sit next to him, pressing close on the padded bench.
“Oh! I
“As if I’d miss the opportunity to question one of the prime suspects,” Sherlock drawls as he comes to a stop practically toe-to-toe the DI, “John needed to be roused from his beauty sleep, which delayed our arrival somewhat.” John rolls his eyes at Sherlock’s little quip as he joins them belatedly.
had suddenly seemed all the more pathetically fanciful.
He seats himself into the chair opposite, sighing contentedly as he sinks in to it’s plush embrace. The rickety wooden chair by the hearth in his own rooms certainly doesn’t compare. Even if Sherlock’s wrapped up in his own mind all evening, there’s no harm in John hiding out in here all evening. Mary is most certainly not in attendance, so he needn’t spend time playing court, and it’s wildly unlikely anyone of this set will note his absence. He settles back comfortably and allows his eyes to drift shut.

“Ah.” John sheepishly hauls his laptop forward from the coffee table, single-mindedly fixing his eyes on the screen in order to better avoid Mycroft’s. “Please, um, forget you heard that.”
“I, um—” Sherlock hesitates, wetting his lips anxiously.
While John researches as instructed, Sherlock retreats to his chair to further consider

That would be passably acceptable.”
“So,” Sherlock queries Irene curiously as he turns the phone about in his hand. “What
Sherlock glances at the time-stamp in the bottom right corner of the image. “Half four in the morning is a rather unusual time to be making a visit to one’s sister-in-law, wouldn’t you say?” he asks, looking up from the photograph with a smug grin.
“Oh good. So unless you’re feeling especially eager to espouse yourself — which, if we’re being quite honest, is even more absurd to imagine than my own currently gestating state — I’m saving you a

the attention that it requires at the moment. With an immense effort, he shoves into a corner in his mind and refocuses himself with determination on the matter at hand.
Sherlock attempts to affect an imperious air but the giggle that bubbles up out of John in response is impossible to resist. He joins in, softly at first, but the giggles rapidly devolve into breathless howls. They clutch at their bellies helplessly while they fall about laughing. Whenever either attempts to stop, the merest glance at the other has them dissolving into frantic giggles anew.
The urge to reach out and place a soothing hand on John’s thigh is overwhelming, but he forces himself to reign it in. While Mycroft isn’t paying John any mind at the moment, if Sherlock so much as
When he starts awake from a drug-induced vision of Irene Adler in his own bedroom, his first consuming thought is of John.
“How many of them are dead?” Sherlock interrupts him abruptly. “Or should I say full-timers? I estimate approximately eighty to eighty-five percent, though it’s somewhat difficult to tell from up here, and I’m still narrowing down some of the corroborating criteria. I haven’t quite been applying myself to it as such.”
“If this is some sort of ill-conceived to save me from further discomfort,” Sherlock fists his hands in his blanket and sets his jaw. “I’m no wilting flower. I’m quite capable of seeing this through. I’m fine— it’s fine.”
“I've never begged for mercy in my life.” Sherlock announces haughtily.
She’s either entirely oblivious to or grossly miscalculating the depth of John's obstinance. Why
In the cafeteria, Molly carries the tray with two cardboard cups of tea while John seats himself at one of the small tables. She places the tray down and settle into the second chair across from him, passing one cup over to John before picking up the other for herself.
Neither of them mentions the night before the following morning, but there’s an easy, tacit truce between them. And that afternoon, for whatever reason, Sherlock surprises John and Mrs. Hudson both by inviting her up for tea, over which he imperiously announces his decision to quit smoking. John can’t imagine what brought on this sudden change, but he’s not about to look a gift-horse in the mouth.
“Aren’t I a lucky sod then,” John murmurs. “Nowhere else I’d rather be.”
When he finally he forces himself to return to Baker Street, the dramatic encounter with the Americans serves as a perfect distraction from any anticipated awkwardness. Sherlock clearly takes pleasure in dealing with them; part summary justice for the abominable treatment of Mrs. Hudson, and part obvious vent for his recent frustrations. John takes equal pleasure in fussing over Mrs. Hudson, pleased to have a vent of his own for all his pent-up need to tend to someone.
“Oh yes,” He surprises himself with how level he manages to keep his voice. He doesn’t break eye contact with John for so much as an instant as he coolly recounts the decision that catastrophically upended two years of his life. “He developed a proclivity for it during the course of our relationship, through the influence of some of his fellow upperclassmen. He surmised— quite correctly— that I too might enjoy it’s effects, and subsequently acquainted me with its use. An action that rather spectacularly backfired on him, I should think, given its incidental effect on my libido.”
well known amongst the elite set as somewhat of a playboy. He’s been staying at the Cavendish home since Philip's departure to the Gulf. The very picture of the devoted younger sibling; loyally attending to his brother’s home and bonded in his extended absence. Terribly quaint. Of course, going by her calendar, he’s practically spent every waking hour with her over the past several months. Which seems a bit excessive for simple fraternal duty, doesn't it?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, plowing on with a dismissive flick of his fingers.
Be that as it may, it’s undeniable that they’ve somehow slipped into an intimacy unlike any John’s ever shared with another. He may not have a hope in Hades of offering for Sherlock, but he’s grateful for the honour of his friendship nonetheless. For being able to sit and bask in the presence of that brilliant mind, and enjoy every precious moment that he can— even if his hands ache to touch.
“You’re serious.” The Duke leans back in his chair, visibly incredulous. His eyes narrow. “And if I were to do as you say, and draw up a contract this very moment, ensuring that not so much as a sixpence goes toward anything besides his keeping, you would not protest?”

too far, and a hair too literal, with the latter when he steals one John’s favourite woolen jumpers in a fit of impulse one afternoon.
To Sherlock.
He swallows against the sudden prickle in the back of his throat. Their time together was always bound to come to an end sooner rather than later.
They lapse into silence and, as Sherlock stares into the fire, a thought occurs to him regarding John’s potential objections to the the child. “You needn’t worry about providing for it,” he hurries to reassure John. “Being as I remain Mycroft’s Omega dependens, any child that I bear will legally carry the Holmes name. While Mycroft might have battened down and find himself a mate eventually, if only to pass on the family name, I can’t imagine he’d bother if I were to... do the dirty work for him, so to speak. It would demand far too much of his time, and he does so
"I'll get a candle!" He announces suddenly, beaming. "It's more romantic."
Sherlock’s eyes widen, and he jerks his head up and down in a frantic little nod, tightening his legs around John’s hips, in case his enthusiasm isn’t quite clear enough. John chuckles and sits up on his heels, stretching across the bed to reach into the beside table. He retrieves a small bottle from the drawer and pours a generous amount of lubricant out onto his hand. Sherlock spreads his legs eagerly in welcome, and John smiles as he settles back between them.

They marry in December; a Christmas wedding. It’s simple and tasteful, just a small civil ceremony and dinner with a handful of their colleagues from the hospital. They have little to no family to speak of between the two of them; Mary’s parents long dead, and her Aunt relocated to America, while John hasn’t spoken to his father in years. Harry’s invited of course, but she doesn’t make an appearance. Instead Clara arrives alone, looking pale and washed out, but determinedly happy them despite the lingering sadness behind her eyes.
“No,” Mycroft allows. “But surely you could find a more… appropriate pursuit to occupy yourself with. You'll hardly be able to keep dashing about after criminals once the child arrives, after all.”
“No one’s saying that you are,” Lestrade holds his hands up defensively. “It’s just a matter of safety. The higher ups would have my hide if they found out I let a pregnant Omega tromp off after a suspected, probably armed, serial killer!“
“Yeah, but- Sherlock condoms aren’t just for contraception!” He shakes his head disbelief. “I’ll just pop up to my room and-” As he moves as if to rise from the bed, Sherlock groans in irritation, and grabs his forearm to pull him back.
He refuses to stop or let himself look back.

— sharing conversation and a delicious meal in the warm glow of candlelight. He feels a twinge of melancholy as it inevitably draws to a close and they head home. But then, when they arrive, John insists he pick something to watch on the telly, promptly hauls Sherlock's feet into his lap as soon as they sprawl out on the sofa, and sets to liquefying the detective with an absolutely heavenly foot massage.
His and John's child; an endless, entirely
Obviously that touch of the flu has well and truly caught up with him.
“God no,” Sherlock scoffs disdainfully, “how incredibly tedious.”
“Well, that’s not surprising.” John remarks indignantly, his features having reordered themselves from confusion and set firmly into a scowl instead. Sherlock lifts his brows inquisitively and turns his head to face him on the pillow.
The swell of guilt is immediate and pervasive.
“Well, I didn’t think you’d have much use for what was left of it. I borrowed it for an experiment I was running testing the level of protection provided to human flesh by the natural fibers of wool against various acids.” Sherlock clucks his tongue disparagingly as he adjusts the focus of the microscope and notes something in the notebook on his right. “Not very much it turns out.”
“I saw it too.”
“Good,” he nods brusquely as relief floods through him, disguising his ferverence with a rough cough. “That’s good.”
Sherlock clears his throat, which suddenly seems dry and parched, and tries again. “I may have neglected to share some relevant news with you regarding my… current condition.”
“Despite your original disapproval of the situation, I hardly think that you would like to risk any harm coming to your future heir now that you’ve acclimatized to the idea. And that will be regrettably unavoidable if I am forced to depart from the vehicle whilst it’s still moving. So, in short;
His eyes involuntarily trail down to Sherlock’s innocuously flat abdomen as if drawn by a magnet. Though his logical mind knows it’s unchanged appearance is utterly meaningless at this stage, if the very thing he’s dreading is true, he clings desperately to that thin thread of hope regardless. Sherlock’s eyes fall shut, a hint of pink blooming along his cheekbones as he lets out two strangled syllables.
He realizes suddenly that it’s Sarah; from the night that he met John.
He’d choked down some toast for breakfast, but then the smell of John's bacon had turned his stomach so thoroughly that he hadn’t been able to keep it down. Fortunately, he’d managed to suppress the urge until he was safely ensconced in the bathroom, the shower running to disguise the sound.
Admittedly, paying off every seller in a two mile radius was an excellent idea. It’s certainly proved to be an effective fail-safe.
“Come on in Greg! I’m just finishing the washing up, but his Nibs hasn’t anything on.” Sherlock huffs with resentment and curls deeper into his chair.

And then promptly freezes again.
The third text comes in just as he's surfacing from the Baker Street tube station, and he feels himself settle into military posture as he reads it.
Entering the Baskerville Facility, and watching the soldier come out in John as he pulls rank is… an experience.
"I'm going to…"
“Sorry?” John blinks dazedly while Lestrade chokes on the water he's chosen an inopportune moment to sip.
It’s child’s play avoiding John’s touch after that. Whenever John reaches for him he only need pretend to suddenly remember an experiment he needs check on, or some other urgent task and whirl away. Every time John merely sighs or offers a tight smile, but tellingly doesn't push the matter in the slightest. Sherlock imagines he must be relieved by the reprieve, though perhaps unsure of any other pending consequences.
“Everyone assumes otherwise, but I
“Good,” John whispers roughly. “I like making you feel good.” He presses his lips to Sherlock’s temple. “Now, I want you to do something for me,” John murmurs. “Do you think you can manage that?” Sherlock turns his face up to blink at him with lust-addled eyes.
” John starts, then catches himself abruptly. It’s best that he consider his next words carefully, before something incriminating trips off his tongue. He feels the creep of heat across his cheeks as he fixes his gaze on nothing especially particular through the windscreen. “I mean, I suppose… I’m just used to you smelling like an om
"It was unforgivably gaudy anyways," Sherlock dismisses flippantly as he throws up the window sash to air the room. "The Lady Fitzgerald has both the taste and needlepoint skills of a common magpie. Really, I’ve done society a great service; ensuring that no poor soul need ever subject their eyes to that monstrosity again."
. It’s a bit weird, is all.”
“I did find it curiously arousing to perform the act on you here in the kitchen however,” Sherlock muses with a careless swipe of his hand across his mouth. “We’ll need to revisit it another time.”
“Tell him you’re alive.”
. But, in instances when I don’t require his assistance, yes, quite likely — I can hardly think of someone more suited to the job.”
“Are you asking me to…” John stares down at him, wide-eyed and breathless.
“Careful,” he cautions, “or you’ll ruin your disguise.”
Not fifteen minutes later, Sherlock’s fruitlessly struggling against the effect of whatever the hell Irene’s drugged him with and cursing the woman to damnation all over again. The small mercy of it is that the rather sound thrashing she delivers immediately thereafter with her riding crop doesn’t register nearly as much as the slap had. His mind seems to be quite rapidly distancing itself from his body, and as such, the bite of the crop is little more than a vague, indistinct sensation.

“I’m not,” John declares. And he honestly isn’t. It’s a simple matter, really. If he has a child, he’ll do whatever it takes to provide for them the best he possibly can; no question, no concern. His concerns are of a different nature entirely; insidiously brought to mind by the sudden reminder of Mycroft’s jurisdiction in their lives however.
He wanders into the bath and twists the taps to start up the shower. The old pipes groan over the task, and he leaves the water to run for a few minutes to heat up. As he waits he relieves himself, then moves to the sink to wash his hands and to retrieve his toothbrush. Leaning over the sink, he catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and scowls darkly at the sight of smudged lipstick mark to the left of his mouth.
“We don’t-” John raises his head to gape at him. ‘“Of course we need one Sherlock!”
"Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime." John squares his jaw, carefully adopting the stoic, regretful expression that he knows everyone expects from a veteran. "Far too much."

did you find out about that?”
“That’s not true,” Billy contends, turning back to saucily inform John that Gary is, in fact, a snorer. The alpha squawks in good-natured embarrassment and shushes his mate, who continues on blithely. “Is yours a snorer?” he cheekily prompts John.
“Well, ” Sherlocks hums thoughtfully, tugging the shirt free of John’s jeans before setting to work on it’s buttons. “You are rather delightfully compact.”
“Your current con-” John’s eyebrows jump together abruptly in confusion, and then rise up toward his hairline as a look of alarmed realization spreads across his face. “Sherlock, are you saying that you’re…you’re…” His eyes trail down Sherlock’s body and focus in on his abdomen. He looks quite as though he’s about to faint. Sherlock closes his eyes and replies, a touch hysterically.

Lestrade is waiting for them outside the Cavendish house when they arrive, leaned up against the hood of his panda, leafing through a folder in his hands. Sherlock leaps out of the cab as soon as it pulls to a stop, leaving John to pay the driver. Lestrade looks up and grins, relief washing clearing over his face. “Finally,” he calls, pushing off the car, “I was beginning to think you weren’t going to show.”
John Hamish Watson passes over on Tuesday, March 29th; two months to the day after meeting Sherlock Holmes.

“Old English surname; it means bright-haired,” Sherlock explains with a mild grimace. “My parents were scholars.”

John isn’t terribly pleased about being awoken so abruptly, muzzily squinting up at Sherlock from his pillow when the detective gently jostles his shoulder.
“You're especially bothered because you've just discovered that your Alpha husband is having an affair with a younger male Omega, and we put you in mind of them. You'd be fine with him working off some of his sexual needs on the side— particularly his more
“Not a word.” Stamford shakes his head and grins broadly.
With a gasp he buries two fingers inside himself, and opens a certain full-to-bursting room within John’s wing of his mind palace, letting the carefully stored memories within spill out.
He knows he's dithering, but he's not particularly enthused to incite John's anticipated reaction.
“That was,” John gasps between giggles,”the most ridiculous thing I've ever done. Six months to live! Sorry,
for having steered Sherlock into Irene Adler’s path to begin with.
mimicking the scent of a bond, and serving as a constant distraction. His Omega recoils from the smell in disgust, leaving him feeling territorial and on edge.

He finds himself standing.
As much as he’d like to deny it, it eats at him; the idea that it might very well be
“You always were an idiot.”
“Hello, Doctor Watson.” Irene Adler greets him, and he’s unable to hold himself back from growling, low and deep, in response.
“Mmm, though there’s hardly a wealth of good murders to solve when everyone is already dead,” he points out with a pout, nestling his face further into John’s shoulder. They lie together companionably like that for a short while, the lapping of waves and cry of gulls filling the silence. Finally Sherlock lifts his head, meeting John’s eyes solemnly. “Be with me.”

John blinks incredulously.
“Embarrassed for people to find out you shared your heat with me?”
“John,” Sherlock hisses excitedly, “We need to leave for the Cavendish house at once!”
he accuses the the wanton little omega fairly slavering away inside of himself,
“Have you any particular reason for that?” Mycroft questions primly. “She’ll be ever so surprised— and delighted, I'm sure. It's certainly nothing we ever expected
“His primary concerns were whether you had taken advantage of me and my health, while the potential blight upon the family name was thrown out as mere afterthought. For Mycroft, that was an absolutely unheard of display of sentiment.”
Despite having expected it, Sherlock squirms a bit in his seat with apprehension. He isn’t sure whether or not he actually wants to discuss this. One one hand, he
we have you two down for a twin instead of a double.” He clicks about furiously before offering an apologetic smile. “And we haven’t any doubles available until halfway through your stay, I’m afraid. We’ve been just swamped as of late.”
John gapes up at him in complete shock, blood draining from his face as the realization of what he’s just shouted dawn's on him. “That's— that’s not what I meant to say,” he rushes to explain. “I don't— well, I
“That was… amazing.”
like his drinking."
“Mhm,” Sherlock hums the affirmative. “She really is a lovely girl. I mean, my parent’s don't approve, but they can't stop us.” He stops to take a long drag of his cigarette before continuing. “I know she pities me,” he reveals, blowing out a long stream of smoke, “That pisses me off. Though that's hardly fair of me, considering that she's…” he trails off when his voice breaks slightly. “You said you don't know how much time there is,” he changes the subject abruptly, turning his head to regard John. “What exactly does that mean?

that puts him in mind of the mornings-after of his drug-addled years. He turns and buries his face against the sheets, snuffling against them muzzily. He catches the hint of John’s scent on them and burrows his nose deeper with a pleased purr.

And so the Little Season draws to a close and then Christmas comes and goes. By the time all the Marriage Mama’s and their children return to town, and the Season proper commences, a small tradition of sorts has established itself.

As they make their way down the sidewalk, alphas sniff the air and turn their heads to stare appreciatively at Sherlock as they pass. In the face of such disconcerting attention, he flips up his coat collar and burrows deeper down into it. Angelo, thankfully, has more tact that that.

The uneventfulness continues maddeningly unabated; the gradually snugger fit of his favourite tailored shirts the only real reminder of the inexorable creep of time. In the solace of his bedroom, Sherlock observes the slow changes of his body and marvels. His normally trim waist has gradually begun to thicken, and the twinging ache beneath his nipples is no longer deniable. While the changes are slight, and detectable only to himself as of yet, soon enough he won't be able to hide them any longer.

“God, yeah, okay,” he pants, nodding frantically as he licks his lips and strains upward again.
“Yeah, I didn’t think so. You
“Almack's?” Sherlock’s brows draw together in confused displeasure, as though John has just confessed that he was otherwise preoccupied visiting Bedlam. “Why on earth were you at Almack's?”
John’s look of confusion deepens.
“Perhaps I’m merely a gentleman farmer,” John finds his voice to wryly suggest.
sister-in-law.”
“I do,” John swallows and nods decisively.
Lestrade is in the midst of helping John stagger upright in the depths of an overflowing skip beneath the fire escape, while the third officer presides over a groaning lump whom Sherlock assumes is one Timothy Beckett. When Lestrade catches sight of Sherlock he lets out a sigh of relief.
“Looking?”
The week after that he starts in 1980; it seems best to start with the options closest to the time of their original meeting and then gradually work his way upward. When he has no luck there, he moves on to the nineties the following week.
“Well, we’re just

Before long the familiar itch for his seven percent solution cure for boredom inevitably begin to build beneath his skin. But, for the very first time since Victor introduced him to it all those years ago, he’s truly determined to deny it's call.
“John,” he calls down the hall, keeping his eyes trained on Irene Adler as he steps up to his bedside, where she's curled up asleep, covering the faint hint of John's scent left on his sheets with her own, content as you please. “We have a client.”
Those steady doctor’s fingers relentlessly stroking him, outside and in, until Sherlock’s mind had been emptied entirely of any thought besides the desperate, aching desire for
“Given that she’s pregnant and there’s no possible way for it to be her mate’s child; either she was spreading her legs for you, or for someone else. More likely you, considering that the pregnancy has remained viable despite her Alpha’s absence and death. Or...perhaps it was both? After all, what kind of bonded Omega doesn’t remain faithful to her Alpha Maritus? Certainly no paragon of virtue. No; an Omega like that is really no better than a wh
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John pants urgently after a short while, the frantic pace of his thrusts growing shaky and uneven. “It's been too long... I’m gonna—“ He grimaces, and bites his lip, a deep flush staining his face ruddy. Three more hard thrusts and his body tenses, hips stuttering to a jerky stop. He tucks his face into Sherlock’s neck with a sob, arms trembling as his hips make tiny involuntary twitches forward. Sherlock feels the accompanying gush of heat inside himself and moans brokenly, sinking his teeth into the curve of shoulder beneath his lips.
“Yes. I do believe we covered that. And neither have you. You know how much I abhor repetition.” Sherlock replies without even looking up at John. He feels a flush creeping up the back of his neck. He can’t recall undoing his own bloody trousers ever being this difficult. His fingers feel oddly thick and clumsy— as though finer motor control is quite beyond them.
Mike though, true to character, seems entirely unfazed.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose in mild distaste and moves away from her to sit across from John at the table. No need to feed into
“There you are,” he announces in a deep baritone as he plunks himself down next to the blonde man from outside. He lowers his voice significantly to ensure that only the man-
And so he'd left to go dismantle a spider's web; no bond in place to tie him and John together.
“What with the monster and that ruddy prison,” Billy shudders, “I don’t know how we sleep nights. Do you, Gary?”
“Henry’s right.”
“What then?”
Sherlock reason to trust him by shouting at him and making accusations, now is he?
He doesn’t know what he might have done, if he’d returned home to…
“I just thought maybe you didn’t want anyone to know.”
Suffice it to say, he’s a fan.
, or the like. Liam and I got into a punch-up, and our flatmates had to break us up, Tisha crying and carrying on the whole while.”
The night air is warm, carrying on it the salty tang of the sea breeze, and the upbeat strains of pop music blaring out from passing cars. A tall young man wanders down the covered street front alone, somewhat over-dressed for the weather in his long black coat, its collar turned up against his high cheekbones.
He stomps through his morning routine, disquiet steadily knotting itself up into a hot ball of agitation in the pit of his belly.
” John interjects with confusion.
John stares at the young omega, stunned, then blinks.
John stares back at him inscrutably for several moments, then finally blinks, nostrils flaring fleetingly before he turns to rest his elbows on his knees and fist his hands in his hair.
“Mm,” John placidly hums, his attention remaining otherwise fixed on his laptop screen. “Like, say… a sudden, intense heat, triggered by massive withdrawal?”
“Yes.” Sherlock wheezes slightly as he brings himself under control, just barely managing to keep his hips from rocking upward. “I just- I need-”
Much later, John and his nurse are making their way back to the front entrance, when a voice calls out suddenly in the hall behind them.
“Your scent is thoroughly agreeable,” Sherlock finds himself murmuring across the strikingly paltry distance between their faces. “I’m always aware of it, of course, but it seems especially pleasant in this state. Like tea and woodsmoke, and biscuits.
The young man fiddles with something on the worktop, and looks up again at Mike as he passes.
“Indeed,” Sherlock agrees with a shudder of revulsion. “An Alpha child would immediately become the next Holmes heir. And, of course, should the child present as an Omega instead, they’d still want for nothing. So in either case, you needn’t be concerned, financially speaking.”
“Right! Yeah,” Lestrade grins and fishes a thick folder out of the plastic carryall dangling from his arm. “We think we had fresh lead pop up on this cold case. Was thinking you could take a look.”

he reminds himself, suppressing the flutter in his chest as discreetly eases his hand free.
The otherwise minor collision is made spectacular by the unfortunate inclusion of Angelo's full water pitcher upending it's contents all over the poor girl.
“Wasn’t sure you really had any at all, to be honest.” John carelessly shrugs his shoulders; the very picture of impartiality.
“No,” he shakes his head, digging his heels in firmly as they clasp his forearms and try to tug him gently back into their sphere. “I’m afraid that I…" he hesitates. It is, perhaps, unwise to make grand confessions to masked strangers, in an open garden where others could happen upon them at any moment.
“I said,” Sherlock bites out, “
“Oh. I
“I will?” Lestrade fixes Sherlock with a wide-eyed look of tentative hope, and Sherlock huffs in amusement as he shrugs into the Belstaff.
“Yeah?” The corners of John's lips curl upward in a rakish smile and Sherlock stares, wondering if John's smile tastes any different. Utterly illogical —
“What's that?” The bartender shouts back, leaning in close to better hear him.
It's all that Sherlock can do to keep from snarling and baring his teeth at her.

If everything goes according to plan, by the time Mycroft finds out, he’ll be unable to take any sort of negative action. Not without drawing considerably more attention to the situation than he would desire. The thought leaves Sherlock positively
“It's not about who owes who,” he proclaims heatedly as he bursts into the men’s room. “It's about
Sherlock stares at him inscrutably for a moment, then nods tightly and springs from the table. The relief is like a tidal wave, crashing over John violently. He doesn’t even realize that he’s been holding his breath, until he’s gratefully rediscovering air. Meanwhile, Sherlock dons his coat and sweeps from the flat, tossing a brusque explanation about seeing Molly for some sort of specimen over his shoulder.
An instant later, a short blonde man sticks his head out the upstairs window with an thunderous expression. “For Christ sake’s Sherlock,” he hollers down, “how many times do I have to tell you that it’s completely unacceptable to disturb the entire neighbourhood, just because you’re too lazy to come up the stairs?”
She calls him every day, and never once mentions their aborted honeymoon.
“Any moment now, something’s gonna happen,” he questions her, once they’re both fully immersed in the image that he’s conjured with his words. “What?”
“I've never- well, you know I’ve never…

“I hardly think that— ” Sherlock baulks, drawing in his chin like a bashful turtle.
“Well, shockingly, it isn’t broken,” he declares, lifting the cloth to gently prod Sherlock’s throbbing nose with exploratory fingers. “Hold that in place while I run down the hall and get something to clean you up with,” he commands, tilting Sherlock’s head farther backward. In lieu of nodding, Sherlock grunts his acquiescence, lifting a hand and pressing it against the cloth in John’s stead. He fidgets as he waits, staring awkwardly up at the ceiling over the folded edge of the flannel and listening to the buzz of officers milling about the flat as they process the scene.
