John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's chest, crying quietly against his shoulder as he held him both against him and kept him forced down to try to make him breathe. This wasn't right, none of this was right, but what could they do? Nothing, they couldn't do anything. He could just hold Sherlock and try to ease his pain. "I know," he murmured placing his teeth over their bond mark, and he did know. He knew perfectly well what was going on and how bad it was.
John did. The first was from his commanding Major, telling him that he was being officially discharged from service with assurance from the Queen herself that he wouldn't have to return. A sigh of relief left him at that, and he closed his eyes for a moment, letting the news sink in before moving on to the second letter. It was from Mycroft. He read through it quickly--too quickly--and ended up missing things, so he had to read it thrice more. He pulled out his computer again and sent the elder Holmes brother an email, saying that he supported the idea, but that Sherlock needed to be told and assured that John was alive. He suggested giving Sherlock a computer so that they could skype. He knew how bad he looked, but he figured that it would be better than nothing.
John smiled, despite the situation. He kissed Sherlock's collarbone, nibbling his way gently up his neck to his jaw, nuzzling underneath it. "I'm glad we had that, too," he whispered, seeking out Sherlock's lips and holding them captive for a moment.
He heard a small noise then, seeing a tiny flailing fist as Katherine woke up. Probably having heard them talking. He sighed, sitting up a little and scooping her up, rolling onto his left side and holding her between the two of them. Kat swung her fist a little, having worked it free, again, from the bundle the nurse had wrapped her in, her arm exposed.
Sherlock
He turned back to the lab work bench and started cleaning up. He had to let the thumbs soak overnight anyway.
Sherlock smiled at the two of them, seeing Katherine's uncoordinated attempts to try and grab at John's fingers. "Soon enough," he murmured. "Holding up her head, then eventually sitting up. Though that's at about four months on average. Her vision apparently isn't so good right now also," he said, thinking about the book he'd read when he'd been bored.
To Sherlock’s surprise the human nodded, seemingly deep in thought. “And you… you were at that warehouse to put a stop to everything?”
"Oh, love," John murmured, leaning over against Sherlock and wrapping his arm around him.
most graceful person that I know. If I can make it through a dance, then so can you."
"Stomach hurt?" John asked quietly, setting the mug of tea down and moving closer to Sherlock. "Hopefully the painkillers will help."
"Sir!"
He and John both knew they would go back to work eventually. John needed time to heal more from his last tour, from everything with Mindy and the last encounter with the American. When Hamish was a bit older, or Sherlock could bear to be away and find a suitably trustable day care. His train of thoughts for the future was interrupted when Katherine started to speak, not ten minutes into the film.
John nearly started sobbing again, but thankfully he was fresh out of tears. He pulled Sherlock back into his arms, holding him close, his hands gripping the suit jacket and holding fiercely to it. "I love you," he whispered, nuzzling against Sherlock's neck and inhaling his scent, glad that he didn't have to memorise it.
John took Katherine, bouncing her gently and turning to nibble at her neck when she pulled at his hair. "I don't know why she's so fixated on me all of a sudden," he said, reaching out and squeezing Sherlock's hand. He stood on his tiptoes, kissing Sherlock's cheek and combing through his hair. "I'm working on it," he promised, yelping a little when Kat pulled his hair. "Hey now, that's mean. You're have to be gentle."
John's arm tightened around Sherlock when he collapsed, pulling him back up into his arms.
Sherlock looked down at John's hand, sighing a little. "For making me go... and for coming with me. And for everything else," he said softly. He looked up at John, and smiled a small bit. "Just... thank you," he said quietly.
Sherlock stammered a little, glancing at the door. Why was it taking so bloody long to make tea? He looked down, letting out a breath. "Like you said, perfectly normal to be afraid. That's all it is, nothing more," he said.
She didn't.
John chuckled, looking between the two of them and shaking his head. "My god, it's like you're clones," he teased, taking a longer sip of his tea before he pointed at Sherlock. "And you're going to start eating at least one meal a day. Isn't that right, Katty?"
“Jawn?” Sherlock shouted excitedly as he ran into the flat. He turned around 360 degrees in the living room, searching for his boyfriend or his daughter. When he didn’t see them, he barged into the bedroom. “John! You cannot imagine what the case was about! Guess! You have 3 tries! It was so interesting. So George called me about a suspected homicide that had to do with the old drug dens I know. When I arrived, it was obvious it had been a homicide so I asked the homeless network for help and went undercover  to talk to some people. None of them knew who it was but a new name had appeared on the street. no one knew the guy but everyone knew his name. So obviously I found this guy and solved the case! Is that not amazing? It was so much fun, he tried to shoot me and we ran across roofs and at one point I almost thought I had lost him but he was just hiding on top of a fire escape, right above me! Can you believe it?” Sherlock explained without stopping for a breath. Once he was done, he stared at John with glee in his eyes, breathing heavily to make up for all the lost air.
John stumbled right past the bench, not even noticing Rosie had guided him there. He needed to get home. To safety. It was all a blur. He found himself sitting in their flat, his back leaned against the flat door from the inside, Rosie bundled up in his arms. as he moved, the little blonde curls moved and blue eyes were looking at him. “Better, daddy?” Rosie asked innocently. Slowly, he nodded. His head felt so heavy and somehow he was wet all over. “Should I get ready for the ewww bath?” Rosie piped up again and John nodded again. A minute or so later, he heard
John was looking at Sherlock with a confused and wondering expression. "What was that?" he asked slightly angrily.
John gave an enthusiastic nod. "Yes. I do have feelings for you. I don't know if a relationship between us would work or if you even want that but I'd like to try."
The aunt went on to talk about how she knew excellent wedding planners and how it was a shame they weren't a couple because they were so sweet and so on. It was all just static for Sherlock. John seemed to notice the tension in Sherlock's body and moved on to talk to someone else soon.
I’m busy. JW
It was silent except for a few birds chirping and the shaking leaves above them for some time that seemed to stretch too long.
She sighed. Yes, her older son who she was usually more worried about had a very questionable opinion about emotions and relationships. "He is not right. Caring can be so great, just look at paps and me. John is just not the right man for you, bee. We'll find you another one, a better one, okay?" she offered, hoping it would cheer Sherlock up. When he was in his teenage years and had fought with Mycroft about the importance of emotions and relationships, his mother and he had often joked afterwards how they would find cute boy- or girlfriends for Mycroft and Sherlock and what they would be like.
The cab ride home was spent with sherlock explaining all the secrets he had deduced during the sport class. Apparently, 2 babies resulted from affairs and the father knew nothing, one woman had poked holes into her condoms since her husband didn’t want children and the others were relatively innocent. The baby had been kicking a little more after the sport and John was ridiculously happy to let Sherlock feel it. The man’s eyes always seemed to sparkle in a very specific loving way when he was allowed to touch John’s belly and feel their child. After they got home, John took a nap on the sofa while Sherlock continued with some experiments regarding baby food. He wanted to find the safest food for their little one already. An alarm would tell him when to put the experiment away and cook proper dinner.
Focus. Focus. For Rosie. He told himself as he got up stiffly. His left knee felt like jelly that was about to slibber slubber away while his right knee felt like the joint had solidified.
Sherlock couldn't hold back a soft sigh of relief and worry when he saw John's belly. For the 5th month, he still looked too thin and the bump was not big enough. At least it was only his pregnancy John was worried about though and this wasn’t actually about their fight. Then John's unfounded suspicion hit him like a brick. "John, you are pregnant. The tumour is a baby. Our baby, possibly." he spilt nervously. John looked up in shock and Sherlock couldn't tell if his friend would be angry or not, so he just quickly hugged John. "John, I'm sorry," he said before he ran away. Back in his own bed, with his door locked, he shivered once more.
The birthday party so far was terribly boring. Too many people, too many affairs, too many things Sherlock was not allowed to deduce. Mycroft had made him swear to either stay with him or to stay close to John to make sure Sherlock would behave. Obviously, he chose John.
Sherlock, of course, had woken up already and was shivering from fear. He didn't believe that John had eaten something wrong. He believed that this was the consequence of John's claim 'I am clean, so are you, no need for rubber.'. Technically, Sherlock knew John didn't remember but he wished the memory of that night would come back to John one day. For now, he could only try to go back to sleep because he would never dare to tell John about his suspicion.
Sherlock. I won’t bring our sick daughter to a crime scene. JW
- she shifted closer-
absolute utter arse tell people the entire day how
So he followed his flatmate around the entire day. It didn't take long until the first guest, a particularly annoying and overly cheery aunt of Sherlock’s assumed they were a couple, because of course she did, and asked if they had thought about marriage yet. John responded with something that Sherlock didn't quite understand because of the blood pounding in his ears which left a kind of static in his head. He only heard the "I am not gay." part.
I’ll even say please. SH
He talked to a few of Sherlock's cousins now who were asking John and Sherlock about their work. It all went well, Sherlock got to tell some good stories about deductions, such as the story where he saved John with a cake, and they all had fun until they asked if it was hard to be a couple when work was that dangerous.
“How are you? I picked some things out.” Sherlock whispered proudly into John’s ear; his heart melted. He encouraged Sherlock to show him what he had picked out and began crying halfway through. Sherlock had picked out the cutest baby clothes John had ever seen. There was:
“How do you want to make it up to me? You really don’t need to,” Sherlock whispered, his voice cracking already from the fear that John might be leaving again. Or- even worse- would want to make it up to him with material things or by being submissive or with sex. There were so many things Sherlock was not fond of.
His mother bowed her head, clearly embarrassed. "Well, mummy uhm...told him her opinion. Then he went to pack because she threw him out. I found him in your room, sitting by your bed. I suppose he was saying goodbye." Mycroft gave a short summary and under the table, Mr Holmes reached for the hand of his wife.
Lunchtime rolled around and there was a beautiful green-red picnic blanket laid out half under the shade of a big oak for Sherlock and John. His mother gave him a basket with lunch too and promised she would let John in, he should go and sit-down. Sherlock, now in cargo summer shorts and a dark blue polo shirt, something he only really wore on vacation, sat down obediently and waited. Once John arrived on the door, Mrs Holmes pulled him to the side and threatened him not to hurt her son ever again or he would face consequences.
It didn’t look much like Sherlock had a choice and he really couldn’t come up with a way out of this that would still lead to some kind of a relationship between him and John. So he hesitantly spoke. “In all the time we have known each other...since Barts… you have said that you are not gay precisely 1476 times, not counting the times you have implied it. Each time it was somewhere between an eight and a ten on your scale. Is that a satisfactory answer?”
Sherlock finally seemed to shake himself out of whatever weird shock state he was in. His beautiful green eyes met John’s and a lopsided smile appeared on the detective’s face. Subconsciously, John’s face mirrored the smile and he shifted a little closer. “Sherl? I like this. Being close to you.” John confessed, aware that Sherlock had made the first step nonverbally and now it was his turn.
His mother fussed over him, Mycroft scolded him for not eating and for 'ruining their mother's birthday again'. Sherlock didn't care. John was flirting with a neighbour's daughter, a girl who had been in Sherlock's class and had always teased him. She threw her head back and laughed-
"He won't be leaving." Mr Holmes answered, his wife sitting by his side with his arm around her shoulders.
“That’s great.” John nodded with a small, forced smile. He was still shaken and hadn’t closed a single eye but luckily Rosie had gotten some sleep.Just as he opened his mouth again to ask Sherlock about dinner, his boyfriend jumped up again, dancing around the room, announcing “I cannot wait for the next case, John! It’ll be so much better with you and if you lose your job, we can always solve cases together!”. John’s brows furrowed as he slowly sat up, curling Rosie up in the blanket. He opened his mouth again just as Sherlock continued rambling something. John wasn’t listening this time. Instead, he just stared at Sherlock angrily. When the other man didn’t react (despite his great deductive skills), John simply said “We need to talk. You need to let me talk.” as he got up and moved to the living room. Sherlock followed him like an obedient puppy, now finally quiet for once.
Throughout the next weeks, John told his friends about the happy news. He began eating more and nutritionally. He and Sherlock talked about that fateful night and concluded that Sherlock must be the father. Sherlock seemed excited and John was happy about it. The only thing that bothered John a tad was that Sherlock didn't really step in to help John. He was just as distant as always but Mrs Hudson started coming by for massages and to help John plan out the room for the baby. He had decided to give his room to the little worm since there wasn’t any space in the living room and he was not sure how involved Sherlock wanted to be. John would just sleep on a small mattress until the child gre big enough to be left alone. And then … John would most likely move into 221C, the basement.
And then, one day, Sherlock asked John if they wanted to go shopping instead of going to the park. John eagerly agreed and soon, he was strolling hand-in-hand with Sherlock who was actually walking at John’s pace for once. They passed multiple baby supply shops and Sherlock slowed down and glanced longingly through the windows each time, seemingly searching for something.
John agreed and was happy to be brought to the picnic blanket. He hesitantly sat down, not too close to Sherlock to give him some space and was still for a few minutes. he could hear Sherlock's breathing. And his friend smelled so good. He wanted to hear the beautiful baritone voice that always sent tingles down his spine too. Thus, he asked "How are you?" like a nervous teenager.
- they asked if they have ever thought about children- Rosie is in play care right now, actually- and went on to explain how important gardens were for children-
Still, she never forgot. She always found herself glancing up at his window, searching for his face peeking out between the curtains. Her husband even asked if he should go upstairs and check on their darling, seeing how worried his wife was. She just shook her head no and mumbled: "He fell asleep". Mr Holmes knew that meant his youngest son had cried himself to sleep. Poor thing.
Somehow this was weird. It was taking longer than usual. Maybe there was a long line. He sighed as another teenage boy shot out of the slide into the water. Somehow this felt off. Logically, he knew it was just a slide, and his family was probably just standing in line behind a larger group of teenagers but still, his belly began tingling uncomfortably and he felt cold. Another shadow appeared in the slide, roughly the size of Sherlock’s butt so John got ready. Out shot a man with blonde hair. Damnit. John moved back to his waiting spot as the man got out of the water. Breathing became harder. John stared at the tiled floor, looking at the plain white tiles. Focus. What are the measurements of that tile? He tried to calm himself but it didn’t work. His body felt all hot and tingly as if he was in a sand storm. His breathing picked up pace until he heard a light voice in the slide. Rosie.
Daddy always sat on the bench to watch her and he had taught her to holler when she wanted to play in a different area. The slide was boring so Rosie hollered and began swinging. And then this man came. He looked a bit like her daddy in old photos. In photos, Daddy had more and blonde hair but he also looked harder. Now her daddy looked much softer. This man looked hard. He offered to push her so she could get high enough to touch the clouds. She had never touched a cloud before. How would they feel? As the man pushed her, she got closer and closer to the clouds but she couldn’t reach. Maybe if daddy helped push, she could get high enough? Again, Rosie hollered but he didn’t react. He only looked at her. Usually, he waved or gave her a thumbs up. Weird. When she looked down the next time, she could see his daddy walking very slowly towards them. The last time he had walked this way, Papa had told her to help him to the armchair. Rosie put her feet on the ground, dragging her shoes through the sand to stop the swing so she could go help her daddy.
“Because I cannot see. My vision has been blurry for about 2 weeks. I cannot deduce finer details anymore.” Sherlock finally confessed. He saw John’S eyes widening, fear creeping into them, and he did the only reasonable thing. He moved over to John and pulled the smaller man into his arms, straddling him. “I’m still here, John. I am sorry for leaving you alone with this,” he promised. His shirt was wet, sticking to his skin in the spot where John’s face was nuzzled into the muscles and soft satin fabric. “We’ll figure it out.” John softly whispered, not sure his love had heard. Sherlock squeezed him tighter, a silent promise that they would.
Once his things were all stored in the car and he had gotten in, he wasn't surprised that no one was there to say goodbye. But maybe Sherlock would remember this night and he would be allowed to come back. He clung to that thought and let the driver drop him off at a cheap hotel close to the Holmes estate. John wasn't able to sleep that night.
Sherlock’s face cleared, his narrowed eyes normalized, his wrinkles slowly but surely smoothed out and the tip of his tongue that had been hanging out, finally returned to the inside of his mouth. Now he looked relaxed, without wrinkles and with a tiny smile on his lips. "Glad you're enjoying it. Can I touch your belly? Please? I haven't touched it yet. Everyone else has." he pleaded desperately. Secretly, his hands had been itching to touch John’s swollen baby belly, to touch what he and John had made together. And now he might even be able to do it. If John allowed him, that was.
Another month later, John stood in front of his mirror. When he had sat down in his office today, a button of his dress-shirt had popped off. Now that he had time, he looked at his curves. His hips had become a little wider. His belly was no longer just a little flat mount of a tad fat. The skin was pulled taut and it looked much rounder. He hadn't drunk beer in a while because the smell made him sick. Where was this coming from? Weird. He decided to work out more. And he bought a few new dress-shirts for work.
"I am not gay," John replied with a smile.
No. No, he was not okay. The neighbour's daughter rejoined them, snuggling up against John and asking with false innocence "Maybe
Daddy sounded angry but not angry angry. He sounded like he was tired but also somehow angry. This was a tone Rosie had never heard before but she knew better than to argue. Slowly, he took her daddy’s wet hand and walked with him to the nearest bench. Maybe he wanted to sit?
And then, finally Sherlock’s time had come. He carried his love to the bedroom, undressed him and had him lay on his back. With soft oily hands, he then began massaging John’s big baby belly in circular motions. The doctor groaned in pleasure underneath Sherlock and he could only smile. He was just massaging for now but it seemed to feel good. When John was all relaxed and as happy as could be and his skin was the softest Sherlock had ever felt, he finally asked his love “What do you think about some intimacy? I thought you might miss it.”
That night, John slept downstairs since his mattress was too soft and Sherlock had a firmer one. Well, and because he quite enjoyed how Sherlock spooned him and warmed his belly with his large hand. It was a night filled with deep sleep and good dreams for both of them.
Mycroft confirmed with a nod "Has always been. No idea what Sherlock likes about him."
The rest of the day was uneventful, there was dinner, some drinking, some dancing, some laughter, and Mr Holmes brother- known as the drunk uncle- was found unconscious in the bushes like every other time before. Around 10 pm, people were leaving and only the Holmeses and John were left behind. The Holmeses had sat down in the living room to calm down a bit before going to bed. John came in and Mycroft informed him that the car would be there in 20 minutes and that he should pack his things since he wouldn't sleep here. John and Sherlock were originally supposed to stay the night. "Okay. What about Sherlock?" John only asked, feeling the tension in the room.
― Suzanne Collins
Impulsively, John gently turned Sherlock around and hugged him tightly, whining “You are the best boyfriend and papa ever!”
During the next few weeks, John went on runs and lifted weights whenever he had time. He left in the evenings so Sherlock wouldn't be bothered. Sherlock thought he went on dates. Somehow the workouts didn't seem to work. His belly seemed to grow bigger instead of smaller and he had a seizable bump soon enough. He went 2 sizes up in his clothes and exclusively wore jumpers now to hide it. What if it was a tumour? What if it was cancer? He was too young, he couldn't leave Sherlock yet. Without John at his back, the detective would be dead within a month. At night, John cried himself to sleep. Then he ate smaller portions. Skipped meals. Anything to get rid of the strange, unexplainable bump.
John noticed and very gently let go of Sherlock’s face. “I promise you, I won’t be mad. I don’t expect you to forgive me. I don’t
No. No matter what you say, she needs me more. JW
"Oh, my lovely baby bee. It's okay. " Mrs Holmes cooed gently, instantly understanding. She had always wondered about the trust her youngest son had in this random John-bloke. This random John-bloke who still hadn't figured out how Sherlock was in love with him and who had just broken his heart.
"Hey," John pressed a kiss to Sherlock's lips, nipping sharply at his bottom one. "Stay awake for another three minutes, alright? Please?"
"Well when you can shave again, it goes or I'll do it in your sleep." he murmured, rocking Hamish as he sucked the bottle down quickly. "God yes, louder. Katherine was so quiet, hardly fussed over anything other than a nappie change or a bottle. This one, no...god, any little thing. Temperature needs to be just so, or he isn't positioned just right...and for the record I think that makes him more you. You said that you were a loud child, I wasn't." he murmured with a soft smile. "Guess they switched, because I'm the temperamental one now."
John laughed. "Yes, well, you made me do that plate thing too, which was basically therapy."
Sherlock nodded quietly, holding his glass of water as John left. He looked around the flat, which was completely quiet now.
Sherlock glanced up at John again, though not meeting his eyes as he took his hand back, not used to being touched. "My suppressants that I made. Side effect, pass as a Beta, though I smell nothing like one. Other people's scents also don't affect me much either. Which suits things fine. I stay out of their world, and they stay out of mine. Prefer it actually," he said.
"I know," John whispered, nuzzling against Sherlock's chest and licking off some of the sweat. He had missed it terribly, had missed Sherlock terribly, but now he had him back. Everything was right in the world.
John smiled, nuzzling against the back of Sherlock's neck. "I love you, too," he murmured. "Kat and I are going shopping tomorrow for your birthday present," he said, pressing his palm over Sherlock's heart. "So you'll have to preoccupy yourself for a couple hours by yourself."
It wasn't enough, Sherlock still had that horrible empty sensation that almost ached just below his belly button. He whined, squirming a little as John continued his movements. He felt even more sensitive now though, and moaned with each one, his fingers balled up into the bedding as he tugged. "John....I...please..." he begged.
John squeezed Sherlock's hand. "Okay with relinquishing her one last time?" he asked, looking over at his mother, who was waiting patiently in the background.
Sherlock jumped a little when he heard the beeping, realising that it was John's alarm. He didn't move from where he was, turning his head over to see John disappear into the bathroom.
"If we know...I don't have a test on me." he murmured. "Your mother would know just looking at me, probably would know before us." he said, sighing softly. "We just...should forget about it for now, not even worry about it and if it happens...we'll know." he said with a small nod, sneezing a bit again and settling more against John.
Katherine blinked a couple times, tilting her head up to look at her Papa. "Bed? But just had lunch...s'not naptime yet," she said, glancing over at where Sherlock was sitting, the cool breeze brushing against his hot skin.  His eyes were closed and he hummed again, rocking Hamish's seat a small bit.
Sherlock clung tightly onto his two children, and realized that Katherine was shaking a bit. "Katty? Baby, what is it?" he didn't get a reply. Harry looked over at them and stepped a bit closer.
John moaned, nipping at Sherlock's neck as he sped up his thrusts, rocking Sherlock through his orgasm. "Let's see if we can't get you to do that again. You're so beautiful, Sherlock," he purred, sucking a small bruise just above his mate's collarbone.
Sherlock nodded once, still smoothing their daughter's curls down gently. He eventually started to doze lightly, as he had been before they got the call about John's mother. He tried to stay awake, but the heat had taken it out of him and he fell asleep.
The episode was about halfway through, but John didn't mind. He had seen it before, relaxed in the familiarity of it. He could feel Sherlock loose against him, and when he looked down, he saw the Omega sleeping. He smiled fondly, stroking his fingers through Sherlock's hair, resting his chin on top of his head and watching the show.
John trotted along beside the gurney as Sherlock was wheeled from the lobby, knowing he wouldn't be able to stay with him the whole time.
Sherlock tried to evade John and they both hit the ground, the commotion made Katherine whimper a little, and a moment later when the pills scattered everywhere she started to wail.
And sometimes there were a few that he even liked.
----------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock's brows pulled together a little when John said he'd heard about his parents, then looked up quickly at the mention of Mycroft. "My brother?" he asked, his face pinched in confusion. He took his hand back, tangling his fingers together in his lap. "My brother's dead," he said. "They're all dead, the accident..." he said, shaking his head. That was impossible.
John glanced over at Sherlock, watching his profile, the way the sun reflected off his hair and cast his already pronounced cheekbones into sharper definition.
"They're letting me out today. Probably as soon as I get a stern talking to by the doctor and she gives me my painkillers and the prescription for more if I need them."
Sherlock looked at John's hand, then up at John with a nod. "Yes of course. Apart from my shoulder, I feel fine. Feel a bit out of sorts, but I probably just picked something up at the hospital. Possible of course, the nurses see so many people. Probably just a bug," he said with a small smile.
John reached into his pocket with a heavy sigh. When he read the message he looked up, back the way he had come from. The orange bottle of pills caught his attention immediately, and he walked over to them, dry swallowing two of them. He sighed, knowing that Sherlock was out now and that he wouldn't be going back home for a while. So that was where John went.
John groaned a bit, reaching up to flush the toilet and moving to lie down on the cool tile. "Dunno," he said, closing his eyes and scrubbing a hand through his hair. "Bad duck? Hospital germs?" His stomach rolled again, but he forced it down for the time being.
Sherlock grinned against John's mouth, grabbing John's hands and working the buttons off himself swiftly. "Yes," he murmured with a nod, quickly pulling at John's hand, stealing a glance at Katherine who was still asleep.
Katherine nodded, looking at the bow-tied clad man with a fez in her hand. "Yes." she said, "He helps." she said quietly, sitting down in front of her doll house and setting him inside. "Keeps everybody safe," she said, adjusting some of the furniture inside the house. John nodded, tucking his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around them, resting his chin on top so that he could watch Katherine.
Katherine hunkered down onto Sherlock's lap and he wrapped his arms around her as she avidly listened to John read, smiling. When it came to the end she sat up, saying the names of each reindeer as they came up. She smiled, taking the book in her arms. "Left out Rudolph," she pointed out. "Oh! Have go!" she said sliding off his lap and dashing down the hall to the bathroom, book clattering to the floor.
John watched Hamish for a little while, smiling as he tried reaching for the toys and became frustrated when he couldn't get to them. "How are you feeling?" he asked quietly, looking back up at Sherlock. When he got a questioning look in response, he nodded pointedly at Sherlock's stomach, then flicked his gaze back up to his mate. "Still okay about that?"
"I might have to have a talk with your brother about that," John murmured, half to himself. "You don't need a babysitter."
He let out a breath. "But yes... I am," he murmured. It wasn't as if he had a mother anymore.
Sherlock shifted a bit on the bed, seeing the change in John's expression. He let out a breath, too tired to want to argue with John about it. "Mm feel like my body's trying to push a squishy, kicking, pink thing out of it, and said squishy thing has something to say about it," he murmured, running his hand over his stomach again.
John eased the shirt over Sherlock's head and helped him thread his arms through the arm holes. "I wish you had some shoes, though," he murmured, looking down at the boy's bare feet. "We'll go shopping as soon as you have some strength in you," he promised, steadying Sherlock with a hand on his shoulder. "Are you okay to walk if I help you?"
Sherlock rubbed her back, letting out a breath; maybe he'd have to call Molly sooner, he did not feel well. "Hey little girl," he said, getting her attention. "You're going to be visiting Aunt Molly for a little bit today, maybe spend the night," he said quietly, knowing Katherine knew her.
John leant against the counter of the sink, holding Katherine protectively in his arms. Christ, he was exhausted, and he really wasn't sure how this day could get any more stressful. He really didn't want to challenge the universe and say that out loud, either. He held Katherine steady as she sicked up again, but it was mostly just dry heaves this time, and then she collapsed back against him, exhausted as well.
Sherlock winced a little, biting his lip when John squeezed him. Sherlock shook his head. "S'not him we need to worry about," he said, taking in a short breath, not able to take much of a deeper one with John's grip like it was. "Bit looser... be appreciated John," he said.
Twenty minutes, later, Hamish started to fuss, waking up. John picked him up and started bouncing him, bringing him into the bedroom for a change before he started really crying. "There you go, big boy," John said, picking Hamish up and smiling at him once he was clean again. "Shall we go visit Daddy before you fall asleep again?" he asked, already heading back towards the kitchen.
Sherlock whined, trembling. He wrapped both his arms around John's neck, trying to hold himself up. He was panting heavily. "T-take... take time... s'fine." he panted, letting out a slow breath, his eyes closing partially. "I...Hmmm....mm." he hummed, not able to string words together coherently.
Sherlock hummed a little, smiling softly. "’m perfect," he said quietly, raising his eyes to look at John. "What about you?" he asked. He leant up and pressed a kiss to John's cheek, wanting to show affection while it was still so easy for him.
He'd been given some at the auction house, and knew it would fix it.
John smiled, cupping Sherlock's cheek and kissing him again, more firmly this time. He stroked his thumb gently over his cheekbone, tilting his head to slant his lips slightly. He pulled back just to continue kissing along Sherlock’s jaw.
John squeezed Sherlock's hand back, smiling over at him. I know you will, he thought back. He wasn't sure about himself, but he was going to ensure the safety of Sherlock and Katherine, and the baby to come. "I'm sure we will. Maybe not Kat so much, seeing as it means actually having to go to school," he said, winning across the table at her.
Sherlock winced as he was moved up into a sitting position, leaning back against the headboard.
John sighed, rolling over and setting his hand on Hamish's back. "Just us again, hm?" he asked, rubbing his thumb between Hamish's shoulder blades. "You'd think that Daddy was purposefully trying to get me to spend more time with you." He sighed again, picking Misha up and rolling onto his back to set him on his stomach.
Sherlock smiled, leaning into John as they rocked. He sniffed, his hand resting his hand on his stomach. "Need to get the cocoa butter again...I avoided stretch marks the first time, going to avoid them again," he murmured, watching Katherine. He let out a breath, "Next week we need flowers...for my parent's grave." he murmured.
John lifted his head, bring his elbow up to support himself. "Don't think I'm ever going to get over the fact that you're actually eating now without me forcing you to," he said with a smile. He squirmed his feet under Sherlock's thigh, warming them up. "I love you," he reminded, lowering himself back down.
He was nearly done when he smelled it, and the scent threw him. Human, obviously. But it was different somehow.
"I ate the whole sandwich," Sherlock offered. "And all the milk... more than you did. Which, I might add, you need to finish. The skinny whelp is eating more than you," he said with a small smile, using one of the names from the auction house and kissing John's nose sweetly before he climbed out of the shower, wrapping himself up in a towel.
--------------------------------------------------------
Couldn't wait until Monday ^_^
"It's alright, Sherlock," John called ahead of him as he made his way into the flat, locking up behind him with the bottle of "morning after" pills in his hand.
As soon as the gun was dropped Sherlock lunged forward onto the bed, wrapping himself around John firmly and rocking him gently. "Shh... shh... John, it's okay, we're home... you're home now. Not there, never there, not again I promise," he said softly, peppering his face with kisses.
So so sorry for not updating yesterday. For a Sunday it was fairly busy since school will be out soon... here is a chapter for you lovelies to read though. <3
"God, fuck..." John gasped, tightening his hold on Sherlock as he came apart. After just a few more thrusts, John pushed his knot inside of Sherlock, burying his face in his shoulder and letting out a long moan as he came. He wrapped both of his hands around Sherlock's waist, pulling him as close as possible, giving his mind a sense of peace that Sherlock was here, right here, and he wasn't going anywhere ever again.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "If you think anything you say will make me take that pill, you're wrong. And don't try the gun. I know it's fake."
"Can't!" Sherlock said, looking at the watch, seeing the watchmakers name on it. It was a shop downtown. He licked his lips, leaping over the bed still in his pants and pulling out his phone, doing a search for it. Not a shop anymore... They'd gone out of business. "Whatever is there... something... is going to... to happen," he panted.
John nodded softly. "Surprised Mum doesn't know. If she does, she's keeping it quiet for the same reason." He sighed, rubbing his eyes.
Sherlock stayed there in the past, each memory almost preserved perfectly, a technique he supposed he'd perfected in that place, being the only way he could escape it, really.
Sherlock nodded, lifting Hamish's car seat up and then carrying him outside when they left, bidding Angelo farewell. He hailed a cab, climbing in and settling the infant next to him, cracking the window a bit and letting the cool air land on his face as he hummed.
"I'm not your babysitter. And I'm not going to tell him anything. I don't like people with a power complex, and your brother definitely has one." John reached out, combing his fingers through Sherlock's hair, just enough to get his attention. "You're fine. I'm home now."
John thought to himself for a moment, closing his eyes as he worked to find a solution. "Well, I could take suppressants while you're going through it," he suggested, petting Sherlock's hair gently. "I don't want you to have to go through that alone. No one should have to."
John rolled off of Sherlock, folding his legs underneath himself and putting his head in his hands, all of his anger gone. "I won't try to. You know I won't. But Sherlock, if, if I die, please, please don't... don't leave them."
Sherlock stood up and walked over to the fridge, pulling out the milk and pouring two glasses. He opened up the cupboard above the counter to pull out some tea. He gave a frustrated growl, looking at the box and pulling out another. "What is with all this decaffeinated tea!?" he snapped out of nowhere, finding the concept of it irritating. He huffed, looking at John. "Where's the stuff we normally have?" he asked.
John shook his head, moving his hands to cover Sherlock's. "Not today. I should change the ones on your wrists, though."
Sherlock blinked a few times. "Nothing on Moriarty yet but.... Moran. Sebastian Moran. He was the one in the flat," he said, swallowing thickly. He turned the phone slightly to show John the picture.
John shrugged, watching Hamish. “I suppose he’s going to be hungry soon,” he said quietly, knowing that he should probably wake Kat for lunch anyway.  “Want me to go make a bottle for him?” he asked, nuzzling into Sherlock’s hair and inhaling deeply.
"Stop, the caffeine won't make it easier. You know I can have something here in minutes, maybe not your pills, but something a bit stronger maybe, if you'd like," he said, wrapping his arms around John's waist and nuzzling against his neck. "I can have your pills tomorrow," he murmured.
John looked down at Katty – his perceptive little Katherine – and couldn't help his smile. "Nothing, Katty. I'm just tired, is all. And worried about you and your daddy," he admitted, scrubbing a hand through his hair. Sometimes he wondered why he told Katherine so much, why he treated her like she was so old. And then he remembered how mature she was, and that she had been his only family and really his only company for two years, having all but ignored Harry and his mum.
Sherlock blinked a couple times, then stood up, letting the sheet fall from around himself before he climbed into the shower. His arms were wrapped around himself and the water spray landed on him a little bit.
John rolled his eyes. "I can get the prescription at the front counter, and I could do without the stern talking to." He reached over for Sherlock's hand, lacing their fingers together. "I just want to go home and be with you for a while.
September 24
"That's just because she and I both have wrinkles," his mother said dismissively, making John chuckle.
"Yes, well... your Papa's a good doctor," he said quietly.
John looked outside, vaguely recognising the part of town they were in. "Almost there."
He raised his eyebrows. “Well, when he can talk I suppose. And when he knows how to use a toilet.” He hadn’t been expecting such a question from Katherine. She blinked in response.
Molly came by a little later before her shift ended (having been working upstairs for the day), and tagged a new body, which Sherlock looked at. Heart attack, but still interesting none the less.
You need to eat more than "most of the time." You need to eat all the time. Two meals a day, remember? Fifteen hundred calories, love. Boys grow slower than girls, but they grow muscle faster.
Maria nodded, looking over at Sherlock. He shifted a little, his arms wrapped around himself, circles dark under his eyes. She'd been sick, for how long exactly? And now she was hurting, and was just going to be hurt more, and if he'd seen something sooner they could have fixed it. "I... can't you do it another way?" he asked, still holding onto himself.
John shivered again, shaking his head before he got sick again. Honestly, what was he even throwing up anymore? "Give it another hour or until my temperature goes up. Whichever comes first," he said, flushing the toilet and banding his arm across it so that he could rest his head on something.
"And my stomach's fine. Stuffed full, but fine," John said, pulling away just enough to do so.
"Wait, you're his brother?" John could somehow believe it, though nothing except their profiles really proved it. "And you let them
Sherlock sank slowly down onto John with a moan; the stretching, burning sensation was amazing. Just the slight pain, but not too much. He nodded, rocking forward a small bit, lifting himself up a fraction then settling back down, getting used to it for a moment. "W-waited too long... Christ..." he breathed.
Katherine blinked, thinking a moment, then took only three biscuits off the plate, putting them back into the mostly empty tin. "There," she said with a nod, snapping the lid back on.
Katherine had heard Papa yell, edging down the steps and poking her head into the living room, sniffling a little. She toed into the room and nudged John a little on the shoulder to get his attention.
. He felt his face warm when John didn't say anything, and he was about to say something himself when John tilted Sherlock’s chin up. Sherlock met his gaze, humming a little when his mouth pressed against Sherlock's.
Sherlock sighed quietly a few minutes later. "We have to do the eating and drinking thing, don't we?" he asked, his mouth still dry. He couldn't remember eating since that sandwich.
John cocked his head but didn't comment. "What are you doing here, sir?" he asked, wincing when he shifted and moved his shoulder.
It hurt to see him like that, laying in a bed with little oxygen nubs in his nose, IV in his arm, and wires on his chest to monitor him. He walked over and gently stroked his face. "John," he whispered. They must have given him something for the fever, as he was cooler. Perhaps they could give it to Sherlock when he got sick. He already felt a bit not good. God... who would watch Katherine?
Of course, nothing snaps things into perspective like a hole being blown through your life. Even if it is only for a few seconds.
He was too warm, and he hated it. "I can't... I can't have this now, just... stop it. Make it stop," he said, shaking his head, not able to think. Fever from the flu, and then his heat bundled in one, he could hardly understand himself, let alone thing. "Please... please," he mumbled.
Sherlock swallowed. "Where... where did you get that? That what Mycroft left? How did he get that, no one knows where that went," he said quietly, not touching the watch.
He pushed it down, pausing at the top of the stairs and moving slowly to the room beyond, pausing outside of the threshold to look inside.
"Sherlock?" John called, politely knocking on the bathroom door before he stepped inside, lowering himself to the floor beside the pale boy.
Sherlock nodded once, "People like us...people who go places like that, see those things, do...what we had to do..." he let out a breath. "There is one of two outcomes. Either part of us stays there, or we carry a part of it with us," he said softly. "You've left John; you'll just always have a bit of sand in your blood,” he said. "Just as I have that place...with me always. That, and every place I went during my...absence," he murmured. He held out his hand and Hamish giggled a little, slapping his hand before gripping onto it with both hands.
John paused a beat. “Indeed I do,” he finally replied. “All of the people from that warehouse, they were gone, the ones that took us… and you’re like they are. Different in the same way that they were,” he said.
"I... let's go... can't miss your flight," Sherlock repeated quietly, standing up and rubbing his side a little bit.
John put a piece of toast between his teeth, walking over to the fridge and pulling out a bottle of milk for Katherine. He took a bite of the toast and set it down, kissing Katherine's forehead as he set the bottle in hot water and walked into the living room for her medicine.
“Died?” he asked. Sherlock exhaled calmly, one deduction too many. Of course he was talking about John dying in his previous life. The only explanation…he was the same. He looked the same, had the same stubbornness. The eyes…even his scent. Though he of course knew that John had died in this life, after his injury. Humans who have died, and even begun to cross over come back with a different smell. Like a scar, one that only someone like Sherlock could perceive.
John swore loudly, slamming up into Sherlock as his knot swelled and he released inside of him. His legs shook, his hand holding tightly to the back of Sherlock's thigh, his other fisted tightly in his hair. "Give me a moment," he whispered, leaning heavily against Sherlock, unable to move at the moment.
happened," he murmured, sinking down into the water.
John smiled to himself, staring at the wall opposite him, sharing Sherlock's warmth, until the bell rang downstairs. Sighing quietly, John slid out of bed again, careful not to disturb Sherlock, and slipped on the jeans again before padding from the room.
"If you're ready," Sherlock murmured, grateful to stand, he couldn't kneel for long these days. He rested his free hand on his stomach and let out a breath, the eggs and toast already well on their way to being gone. He gave John a small tug and led him from the cemetery. "We passed a café on our way here, why don't we go there?" he asked quietly.
Ella looked at him thoughtfully. “And the voice?”
John squeezed Sherlock's hand back, silently agreeing with him. "Yours too," he said, walking a little slower to push away a kink in his side. "We'll spend both of them at home, just the two of us."
John’s hand reached between them, and he slowly sank two fingers into Sherlock, stretching him open with his mouth hot on the Omega's back.
Sherlock let out a breath. "I know you wouldn't," he said softly, looking around them. "Just how exactly did you find this place?" he asked, looking back at John. "And should I close my eyes? It is a gift after all," he said with a small smile, trying to not think about London, or Katherine. If Mindy could handle John
Sherlock sighed, wanting to see Katherine. He slowly pushed himself up from the bed, looking around the room and just deciding to go down the hall shirtless. God knew where his clothes and things, let alone his dressing gown, had ended up. Probably gone; he wouldn't blame John.
"Fine. I think," Sherlock responded with a little smile. He was still looking at the edge of the blanket which he was fumbling with but John could see his little lopsided smile. "So, you said that last night was real? And that you mean it?" he asked determinedly because honestly, at this point it was no wonder if John would leave.
Sherlock looked down nervously, then up into John's stormy blue eyes and responded "Yes. I have feelings for you, John Watson and I'd like to be your boyfriend."
Need you to come. It’s urgent. SH
. Zoo and all- Sherlock stopped listening.
About halfway there! He thought to himself when his leg began aching close to a local bakery he and Rosie passed every day on their way to daycare. Perhaps having a little break here with one of their delicious scones would be nice? No. Without any time to contemplate the thought, his mind had already cut John off. Something felt wrong. He looked around but couldn’t spot anything out of the ordinary. There were two boys riding their bikes, a few people sitting in front of the bakery, munching away happily on their purchases and a couple more people in line, waiting to order. Weird. With another cautious look around and a little more attention towards his surroundings, John continued walking. For the rest of the way home, the feeling stuck to him like glue but when he entered their front door, it rolled off him like beads of water. Sherlock was dozing on the sofa with dishevelled curls and an arm covering his eyes from the sunlight. After taking a deep breath, John couldn’t help but smile and join his boyfriend for a little snuggle.
Dear people,
One uncle came over, the one that always got drunk far too fast, and supported himself on Sherlock's shoulder, shouting how John was a fine man and how he wouldn't mind finding such a man in his bed some day.
John noticed and gestured toward the door of the next one, asking “Mind if we go in?”. He had already ordered all the furniture for the baby’s room together with Sherlock but they needed some clothing and John thought it wouldn’t hurt to look. His love seemed very interested, after all.
John could only promise “It’s a good thing. Nothing bad. I feel like that about you too.” Maybe this was their version of ‘I love you’. Just maybe, Sherlock actually loved John.
John read over his new blog post for the 20th time, still doubting if he should tell people of the diagnosis and if this was too formal or fine. “Just post it, staring at it won’t make it better.” Sherlock smiled as he came up behind his love with Rosie on his hip. They had been communicating better since their fight. Now John filled Sherlock in on the details, particularly his feelings while Sherlock did his best to listen more attentively. Not solving cases anymore was helping too. “Daddy, look. I made a picture.” Rosie grinned as she handed John the photo. It was a small misshapen human-like being and a bigger one, both blonde. The bigger one was drawn as a rectangle. “Aww, who’s that? Is that daddy? Is he so strong?” Sherlock asked in his silly voice. “No, Papa. Daddy is soft. That’s Major. My friend.” Rosie explained with a grin. The picture dropped to the floor and before John could say anything, Rosie had been whisked away and dropped off with Mrs. Hudson for the time being. Sherlock returned swiftly and sat on the sofa, opening his arms wide so John could crawl in for a cuddle. As tight arms closed around him, John began feeling less antsy and he breathed more deeply, enjoying the scent of his love. “My dear brother is taking care of him. He won’t be back.” a deep baritone voice promised.
was not aware you’re not gay, John?". The old nickname threw Sherlock back into his childhood and teenage years where everyone had called him 'Sherly the girly'. Old classmates’ faces laughing showed up in Sherlock's mind, them screaming at him, throwing all sorts of objects at him, pushing him, tying him up so he would miss the bus. "No, he has always known I am not gay," John responded with a puzzled look.
“Oh. Sherl.” John began chuckling softly as he pulled his friend into a hug. “This is my hormones making me overreact. And I found it sad that you felt like you needed to ask. It reminded me of how we are not a couple. And you’ve been so distant.” he explained, knowing his love sometimes needed the extra explanation.
John shifted, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. “Oh yes, you are, your face is saying a lot.”
. . .
Sherlock tore his eyes away from the rapt attention he was giving John’s trousers and the very distinct outline drawn across his pelvis and hip for only a moment before lifting his long, elegant fingers to bring them to the zip at John’s waist. “I’ve always been curious,” he said with all the measured madness of a scientist dissecting a new specimen.
“Oh, good, Sherlock, were you going to play? That’s a lovely idea! It’s a perfect night for music. Even John was humming just now. You weren’t going back inside were you, after just coming out in the first place? Did you forget your rosin or something? Your bow doesn’t need it, does it? Just come and give us a little concert as a test if so, I’m sure you’ll be splendid.”
John studied him, his eyes wide with wonder and excitement. “You don’t have to, Sher--”
As always, thank you so much for reading. Part three will be a bit of a doozy (in length) but I'm looking forward to sharing it with y'all! Thanks for putting up with me and my flighty ways.
“You’ll spook. You’ll remember whatever it was that kept you from doing this months ago and if you attempt to shut me out again, so help me, I will--”
He was equal parts brilliant and arrogant. A rising talent so incendiary it was hard to go a week without seeing his name mentioned in the Times or his picture dashed across the blogs of online ballet aficionados or the social media pages of teenage girls. He was a beautiful idea in an untouchable skin - an unstoppable force wrapped in a delicate shell, and he only cared about
“Yes.”
He sprang from the floor in a fit of anxious energy, ignoring the tiny gasp of sound Molly gave at being in the path of the sweat flinging from his skin and walked to the windows along the back wall. They were old, double-hung, and wooden, painted many times over the decades and were a nightmare to open, but if they produced so much as a whisper of a breeze to cool Sherlock’s skin, he’d happily exert the extra effort. He heaved once, twice, and the pane flew open, filling the studio with a heavy push of warm air. Sherlock grimaced at the lack of relief but grinned as the satisfying sound of sheet music fluttering to the floor like so many autumn leaves echoed behind him. John wouldn’t be happy that his precious music was no longer in order and that satisfied Sherlock enough. The man had proven to be entirely too organized in Sherlock's view and needed a bit of sanding down along the edges. Sherlock was actually doing him a service, though he doubted that John would see it that way.
“Again!” Mr Baynes shouted, and the group of twelve dancers in rehearsal room 2B put themselves back into formation. They moved as one despite their bodies being unaccustomed to the loose, freeing movement of Jerome Robbins’ choreography. The fact that it needed to look loose didn’t mean it felt that way to Sherlock and his fellow dancers. He pushed and kicked and spun and skidded across the dance floor in his new, flat, white sneakers until he thought he’d rub the fresh rubber right off the soles.

“What?”
Sherlock grinned. "Hungry?"
at him or waving her hands in a dramatic swoon, she raised her glass in salute and winked. Martha Hudson actually winked at him. John didn’t know what to make of it, he simply shook his head and kissed the beloved old bat on the cheek before walking around the breakfast bar to start coffee. Mrs H was already two sips into her first gin and tonic of the day, but John couldn’t remain standing for one more minute without the aid of caffeine in his veins. He yawned as he filled up the kettle and added beans to the grinder installed in the pantry.
John Watson liked to improvise. He was very good at it. He saw his entire life as being one long improvised solo he was performing for the audience of the world around him. Whoever felt like paying him mind was welcome to, and whoever decided to look the other way was also accepted. John lived his life the way he wanted it, complete with the gypsy experience of never having settled down anywhere or really owning anything outside of his music and a handful of jumpers. He traveled too much to keep a flat anywhere or to bother with extra possessions and knew enough people in enough cities that finding a place to kip was not much of a hardship.
“You prefer women,” Sherlock slurred on the last word, his tongue darting out to lick his full bottom lip.
“Now you.”
Sherlock’s mind came back online after a moment and he pulled back as his curiosity took over. “You taste  . . . interesting.”
Sherlock ignored the interruption, “--leading a vagabond experience just because your father never approved of your lifestyle or your chosen profession.”
How dare Sherlock do this to him, the bastard.
. . .
“Sherlock.” John stared directly into his eyes, refusing to look elsewhere. “You were . . . you were never . . .” his voice failed him and he ran a hand over his haggard face, shoving his glasses into his hair. “I would stay for you.”
It was all Sherlock said by way of conversation. John’s fingers danced over the rough surface of the thrown-clay pottery in his hands, playing unnamed tunes to the beat of his erratic heart. He waited. He breathed. Sherlock remained silent.
Sherlock sprawled on the floor, his long limbs extending in every direction, each one reaching farther on the cool wood, seeking any relief possible from the unrelenting heat. A pool of sweat rested languid and still in the dip of his collarbones, the moisture of his exertion clinging to his skin like raindrops on the soft velvet of strawberry leaves. He ran a hand over his forehead, feeling the damp drag across his forearm, pulling at the downy hairs, and wishing so desperately for a flannel or a shirt or some form of cloth to sop up the puddle he’d turned himself into during the course of rehearsal. He internally dammed Mrs H for always refusing to utilize the air conditioning in the summer months, insisting that it was bad for her dancer's muscles. The fact that they would all eventually pass out from heat stroke didn't seem to enter into her reasoning.
Molly didn’t turn back from the window for the rest of the drive and John tried to relax his racing nerves by stroking Sherlock’s curls. Twenty minutes prior he’d been picturing a very different end to his evening. That version also ended with a Sherlock Holmes wrapped around him but not quite like this. John sighed and rested his head on the back of the car seat, his eyes falling closed as the car drove up to 123rd and Amsterdam where Molly lived. He’d have to take the subway back to Greenpoint and he’d be taking the long train ride alone.
“Yeah but--” John let the sentence trail off, any semblance of hope he’ been harboring for the day had long evaporated into thin air thanks to Sherlock’s searing gaze. John had clearly missed something. He felt crestfallen and small as he packed up his things and headed to the third-floor rehearsal rooms, and he hated feeling small. It angered him to know that one moment he’d been so close to having something profound and good with Sherlock, and the next, it was as if the entire evening had been nothing but a dream.
Between Mrs H's kindness and the addictive lure of being within Sherlock Holmes’ orbit, John found himself as settled as he ever had been, subletting a friend of a friend’s room in a crowded flat in Greenpoint and obtaining monthly Metrocards in order to financially streamline his daily commute. It was a ghastly realisation. John Watson had become rather normal, and the idea struck him as a bit of a novelty. When was the last time John had a bed to call his own for more than three weeks, or a place in a kitchen cupboard to put his favorite mug, or a corner of a sitting room to store his music? John had trouble finding an answer to those questions, so he stopped trying and made his tea each morning, poured it into his thermos, and commuted to his job in the city, just another cog in the great machine.
for this production. How exciting!” She smacked him lightly on the shoulder before going in for another hug. “We’ll need to update all that nasty paperwork and . . . whatever. Who cares. Where is the drinks trolley, we must have gin. This is a celebration!” She scanned the room, eyebrows creased, wondering why there wouldn’t be gin on every level of her home while also contemplating who to pay to remedy such a blatant oversight. John chuckled and rose from his seat to escort her back to the ground floor kitchen where gin, plenty of limes, and tonic were always on hand.
“I want you, John.”
as opposed to true Jazz, this ballet needed a new defining word, something transitional and fluid that evoked the singularity of the choreography. John would ask Sherlock if he could think of anything, knowing the brilliance of his mind, he’d certainly have a couple of appropriate words or terms floating around up there to call this moving piece of breathtaking art.
“You’re anxious.”
“I never cared to before, John. I was rather busy,” Sherlock shot back.
“You’ll never gain his approval, John.”
“You are, aren’t you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock wondered why he and his brother always insisted that friendship and adhering to social norms were below them. He’d always had Mycroft growing up as a confidant and that was enough for Sherlock. Though now, away at school and Mycroft elbows deep in his bootlicking on Downing Street, there was little time for brotherly affection to fill the void of friendship. Their conversations were no longer conspiratorial but contentious. Their comments to each other more biting than humorous, and Sherlock puzzled over what was happening to them to cause the rift.
We now interrupt our regularly scheduled Johnlock programming for a time jump into the past. Please note that the year this chapter takes place in starts in 2008. Sherlock is a young thing back at school in England.
“I repeat my earlier statement, Sherlock. Grow. Up.”
“People have told me that before,” he breathed, his voice uneven and faint.
I've given up pretending that this story has anything less than five parts to it - hence the deletion of the completed chapter number. I'm 99% sure that it's five but just in case it isn't, I left the final chapter tally open. I hope that doesn't upset the few of you who have been sweet and generous with your time and following along as I post, and I hope that the addition of more chapters makes you excited rather than disappointed at the lack of resolution posted in this chapter.
“You’ve tattled on me before.”
With another sigh, she stalked forward and grabbed the phone out of Sherlock’s hands with a scoff. “Honestly, you boys are idiots. No, I didn’t take any pictures. Yes, I was kidding earlier. There’s a difference between having a bit of fun, Junior, and just being cruel. I am not
Groaning at the runaway nature of his thoughts, Sherlock scrubbed at his face and downed the rest of his coffee. He tucked a twenty under the salt shaker on the table before making his way towards the park, needing to stretch his legs and burn off the excess energy of the coffee that was currently coursing through his veins. If he could stay away from the house, perhaps he could hold off the need to crawl under the sheets in John’s room and breath in the scent of his sweat like he so wanted to every time he saw John leave for the day. It was a pathetic fantasy, and Sherlock cursed at himself for being so weak, but part of him just wanted to give in and fold himself into a piece of beautiful, intricate, origami John would cherish and carry around with him in his pocket. Perhaps he would fiddle with it from time to time during the day, and that would be enough for Sherlock. The man was so touch-starved, he'd take anything John was willing to give and yet he knew that if he asked, John would give him everything. It was a staggering a terrifying thought.
“You hate jazz.”
Sherlock’s voice had risen in volume during his speech and at the final outburst, Mycroft’s eyes widened to a comic degree. He looked around him, at the tiny, quiet, quaint cafe with its grandmothers sipping tea and local hipsters eating pancakes with their parents and glared at Sherlock for causing such a scene. Sherlock scoffed at his brother’s reaction.
“Do you want to be my . . .  boyfriend?” John finally asked. His voice was muffled by the sheets, making the question seem all the more ridiculous.
Sherlock’s mind raced with the possibilities of having witnessed such a reaction. God, Sherlock wanted to learn this man. To know every scar and every freckle, to unearth every secret and exploit it, if only for their mutual enjoyment.
“Yes. Sometimes.”
“Thank you, sir.”
The bed was consuming him in a cocoon of consoling comfort he couldn't control. His fingers danced along the pattern of the quilt beneath him, playing imaginary keys as he focused on nothing and yet saw every bit of the past hour float across his vision, taunting and confusing him until he rubbed at his eyes to make the images stop. Above him, the ceiling swam into a swirl of dusky grey and before John knew it, the sweet delirium of unconsciousness was pulling him down into a  dream-filled haze of memories he had tried so hard to keep at bay.
“No.”
Sherlock scoffed and moved to turn back but John was faster, he surrounded him, arms circling his waist and shoving him back into the sofa cushions. Sherlock landed hard, his curls flying back off his forehead, eyes wide with shock. John leaned in, arms braced on either side of Sherlock’s shoulders, crowding him.
“Oh, you posh bastard,” John said. He crawled up Sherlock’s body and kissed him. The weight of him feeling heavy and perfect atop Sherlock’s chest. He sunk back into the warm sheets to soak up the attention, enjoying the slow movement of John’s tongue in his mouth.
“Oh, is that why you’re here? To tell me to grow up? Piss off, Mycroft. I’m doing what you asked. I’m keeping my distance.”
Molly shook her head and giggled. “Don’t worry.”
John sat straighter in his chair and hoped to god this conversation would soon be over. “You’re stoned.”
“That’s right.”
If you'd like to see some images of the dancers I've mentioned in this chapter I've created a tumblr post here:
“Live with you.”
Molly's small smile faltered and she turned her head to look out the window, her ponytail curving around her long neck. John felt like shit realising that Molly probably had a few herself and wasn’t exactly in a sober state of mind. He'd also just taken her away from her friends on their night off and was now asking her to play nurse and hostess to one very unconscious Sherlock Holmes. He rubbed at his face and reached the arm he’d rested along the seatback towards Molly’s ponytail, tugging gently.
Sherlock grimaced at the sight of Sarah tousling that ashy-blonde hair with what was assuredly an unnecessary amount of attention, making it more of a mess than normal and throwing his glasses askew. They laughed as John righted them, the sound trickling over the stage towards Sherlock like shards of shattered glass. He had to get out. He launched himself into the wings before he could allow himself to entertain the idea of tearing Sarah’s matte black fingernails off one by one a moment longer.
Infinite heart-filled hugs to Ledion25, who not only beta'd but was also a cheerleader, sprinting partner, and a great friend and supporter of this story throughout.  Thank you, boo. Thank you.
John’s hands stilled. He looked up and locked eyes with Sherlock, no longer facing the mirror but standing at the foot of his piano, his face open, accepting.
“The rehearsals,” John offered with a sly grin he couldn’t hide. He knew certainly well the reason Sherlock was still snoring away upstairs wasn’t only because of the week’s grueling rehearsal schedule, but because he hadn’t let the man rest till dawn broke across the sleeping sky and brought with it a dash of light to their new reality. A reality in which John Watson could hold Sherlock Holmes in his arms and not fear that the man would run away like some over-excitable racehorse at every footfall or chuckle of red-lipped laughter.
In the last few moments before their cue, Sherlock rolled his sleeves up to his shoulders, seeking some sense of relief from the backstage heat. His fingers itched at his sides and his toes wiggled in their shoes; he wanted to be onstage, he wanted to dance. He wanted to see John.
John grinned back at him, and the audience clapped on.
. . .
John colored pink and he didn’t try to hide it. He shifted in his seat and reluctantly broke his gaze away from Sherlock’s, refocusing on his hands beneath him. “Alright.”
The man across from Sherlock grimaced at his brother’s inhospitable response. “Do grow up, Sherlock.”
A beat passed. Then two. Three. A final measure; a coda.
. . .
“Sergei Polunin certainly seems to be,” Siobhan added.
Last but not least, Sergei Polunin: The Sherlock Fandom certainly knows this name, he is the dancer behind the GORGEOUS dance video directed by David LaChapelle entitled 'Take Me To Church' named after the Hozier song of the same name. I'm pretty sure everyone I know who has spoken to me about the 'balletlock' sub-genre of Johnlock, cites Sergei as being a Sherlock stand-in because he's beautiful, a bad boy, and an INCREDIBLE DANCER! I feel the need to reiterate how amazing this man actually is. . . I can't imagine how incredible he'd be if he hadn't let his rebellious nature run away him and focused his energies on dancing as opposed to partying and drugs. I'm sure most of you know, but in case you don't, there is a fascinating documentary about him called 'Dancer,' which I think you can rent it through Amazon if you'd like to see more of this beautiful human writhing on the floor with his shirt off. I mean, if you'd like to witness the gloriousness of ballet first hand. Of course.
“Really?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow, intentionally cruel.
“Hold up. What’s this? Who’s Mycroft?”
Sherlock's gaze fell to John’s hands fisted by his sides. His own fingers itched to reach out and touch John's, but all he could do was stare. He watched, transfixed, as John grabbed ahold of his bag and hoisted it higher on his shoulder. His knuckles were white with tension, his veins standing out in startling relief against his tanned skin. It was such a simple movement, an everyday, ordinary inevitability to adjust one’s bag on one’s shoulder and yet, seeing John portraying such a thing made Sherlock ache. He missed him.
“John. . .”
For shites and giggles, here's one of the most erotic (read: my favorite) parts of Howl, the Ginsberg poem mentioned in the chapter. Also, if you haven't read Howl in its entirety, wtf? It's legendary. Go read it. Now.
He waited.
He’d missed the last leg of rehearsal.
She kept her head held high and her eyes cutting as she started down her son, her thin fingers wrapping themselves around his palm in a fierce grip. “I love you."
“Quite.”
“You’re insane.”
Sherlock merely pointed at the wall to his left.
A few of the apprentices had put together an impromptu pub crawl of sorts to celebrate and the ladies of the group had pulled John along by his lapels, lamenting the ‘lack of cock’ amongst them. John had laughed at the joke, feeling perfectly fine with being objectified if it meant a good time with the good-looking people he’d worked so hard with over the past weeks.
“That’s it. I’ve had enough.”
At the sight of Sherlock’s reaction, all the anger in John slowly began to ebb. It seeped out of him in a self-loathing wave, leaving him feeling lost and unsteady on his feet, despite having the barre at his back to hold him. He looked up at Sherlock with sudden exhaustion in his eyes. He was so tired of this dance, so tired of this back and forth torture. Why were they doing this to each other?
“Bull. Shit. I've done nothing to you.”
Sherlock leaned back just enough to see a look of awe on John’s astonished face before he moved in to close his lips over John’s, sealing his wonder with a kiss.
Ten minutes later John found himself with a very strong and very good drink, that was definitely twice its normal liquid volume, but he wasn’t complaining. The night had cooled to a level just below tropical and there was a gentle breeze teasing his hair as he slumped in a hammock slung between two birch trees in Mrs H’s impressive back garden. The woman herself lounged on a small deck that led off the kitchen and boasted a table and set of four wooden chairs. She looked content, a little more so than usual, and John hid a smile wondering if the old bird was stoned.
Sherlock had news for him.
“That’s fine,” Sherlock agreed.
Just as Sherlock hadn’t been mentally prepared for the awakening of his sexuality, John had been nowhere near ready for the onslaught of glorious attention Sherlock gave him once he’d ducked his head full of riotous curls between his thighs. All John could do was lay back, hands fisted into the tangles of his own hair, and will himself not to fall apart at the seams.
“Hmm? Oh, yes. I wanted to speak with you, John.”
“It’s only been three days, John.”
“Improvising.”
John smiled as the twelve dancers all kicked out to the side with their right legs, arms swaying up into the air as one. The movement was so iconic, so perfectly ingrained in the pop culture psyche of anyone who’d seen
He played until his bones ached. It was the only katharsis he could grasp, and he held on like a dying man clinging to a liferaft in a raging sea. To John, music was always the way out, the safe passage to a calm shore.
Ugh, okay, I couldn't fiddle with this chapter anymore. It just it what it is at this point. There are limits to the number of times one can tweak a single sentence . . . and if not there should be.
If it had been, Sherlock certainly would have been better off. John was worried for him. Who had drugged him? Was it random or had Sherlock been a target? Was it some kind of bizarre rivalry with another dancer or merely a predator out to find a pretty victim?
Mycroft undid his tie from about his neck and dropped it on the table where Sherlock knew it would remain even after they’d departed.
Thank you to @nottoolateforthegame for being a wonderful beta, and a special thanks to @lediona25 for extra hand-holding and encouragement while I struggled to get this chapter out to you. I hope it was worth the wait. *bites nails*
“How did you--”
John nodded, his fingers absentmindedly fiddling with the tags lying on his chest. He’d been a disappointment to his father in more ways than not just continuing on the family legacy of ‘crying God for Harry, England and St. George’ in the military. For one, he was almost certain he would never add a branch to the family tree of continual J. H. Watsons, and the reason behind that very well may be lying before him on the bed in a pool of afternoon sunlight.
“Fuck you.”
Sherlock steered clear of John for the rest of that morning. Preferring instead to sulk in darkened corners and brood with his hands folded across his chest.
In the end, Sherlock realised that his reactions were more obvious than a flashing neon sign lighting the darkening sky above a sleazy casino in the American West. More obvious than Mycroft's expanding waistline or Mrs H's marijuana habit. He could play aloof, he could play arrogant, he could play indifferent all he wanted, but John knew that Sherlock ached for him and he had accepted his own feelings much sooner than Sherlock had. John was free, and open and, Sherlock hated to admit it, but so utterly intriuging the need to
John pressed a small kiss to the middle of Sherlock’s cheek as he cuddled himself close, curling in a little. Sherlock followed the movement so they both ended up curled around John’s baby belly. Sherlock wrapped his darling up in soft blankets and began stroking his short hair, mumbling “I missed you. This.”. A soft sound escaped Sherlock that almost sounded like a purr when John ran a hand through his wild curls and promised “Never have to be without this again. I am still searching for a bedshare, interested?”. “Of course. I’ll take the offer.” Sherlock grinned when he noticed how tired his love looked already.
Afterwards, when John sat normally for the question round before they could leave, Sherlock noticed a sizable bulge in his love’s intimate area. Apparently John was at least half-hard. Of course! Sherlock had entirely forgotten to take care of John’s sexual needs while taking care of everything else. How stupid he had been. He would take care of that issue tonight, he decided as he added that to his mental to-do list.
The worry in Sherlock's voice eased John's tension a little. His friend wasn't mad at him for screaming at the consulting detective how much he wished he’d never met Sherlock. Plus, Sherlock had remembered to apologize which was good. Still, he needed another moment before he quietly mumbled: "I don't want to leave you." He closed his eyes right after and suddenly the sound of his heartbeat and blood rushing through his ears became unbearably loud and almost made him miss his friend’s response.
John could feel anger welling up inside of him, he hated being screamed at but once his brain processed what had been screamed at him, he deflated and the anger was gone. "He...loves me?" he asked completely shocked and surprised. He had not expected that.
Sherlock nodded and a blush of faint strawberry-red colour appeared on his cheeks. “Me too. We can do this more often.” Was that wrong? Would it make John cry again? No, John smiled happily and cuddled into Sherlock, putting one of the detective’s large boney hands on his swollen belly. This was nice, indeed. A warm feeling spread through Sherlock’s chest and since he couldn’t explain it, he asked John.
Sherlock nodded. It had been real. John's visit had been real. "Thanks," he said shyly and gave his mummy a kiss on the cheek. He really was grateful for his protective mother. Under the table, he sent John a text.
"Oi! In such a bad mood today, are we? Be so kind and let me come back later, John had awful back pains today." she chimed as she left.
"I don't want her to touch you. I am the one who did all the research and knows everything about massages and baby bellies. Not her." Sherlock growled possessively.
“We have a little football player.” John smiled softly and Sherlock's mouth popped open. That finally made John break out in laughter. It filled the room and John couldn’t help but press a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. “Hey? Sherlock? You okay?” he asked with a hand resting on his belly again.
A deep oppressive worry filled Sherlock's chest. But there was a spark of light and tingling hope as well. Maybe John loved him back. He didn't seem too sure of his own feelings though. His family noticed the hopeful lopsided smile that had crept onto Sherlock's face. "Why are you smiling so... stupidly?" Mycroft asked and got a little kick from his mother under the table.
“I’ll tell you once you have given me your score,” John responded, now more pulled together again.
Sherlock, after a short pause for thinking, nodded softly and confirmed “I want it. We’ll go slow and be gentle.” Then he was pulled in for a kiss and suddenly, he didn’t know which way was up or down. He only knew he was passionately kissing John and pressing himself against his darling as well as he could. “Who tops?” he breathed out in between kisses and John breathed back “You.”
Since he received a shy nod for an answer, John led Sherlock into the shop with a  confident smile.
As John stepped closer, he could see the blotchy red face of his flatmate though. He looked younger. And overall more peaceful if one ignored all the signs of crying. He looked so lonely. There was something warm in John's chest as he looked at Sherlock's face, but it mixed with the heavy guilt in his stomach and made it even worse. He quietly kneeled down next to the bed so he could look better into Sherlock's face. Shit, he felt something for this man. He wanted nothing more than to hug him and to crawl into bed with him. John knew that wouldn't be appreciated though. If only he could prevent Sherlock from ever having to cry again. He just wanted his best friend to be happy. He gently let his fingers ghost over Sherlock's cheekbones, then stroked with his entire hand through soft ebony curls. The man on the bed shifted and began blinking sleepily.
He was looking up at her with all red and teary eyes now, claiming "It's not your fault. Mycie was right, caring is not an advantage."
Rosie was cheering as she and Sherlock went down the slide. Despite his shaky fingers feeling like pudding, John managed to take a few good shots as his daughter and boyfriend shot out of the green tube. He welcomed his angel with open arms and she hugged him, asking him “Do you want to go too? Let’s go!”. “No, Sweetheart. It looks like there is a long line now. How about we relax a little in the saltwater bath?” he proposed instead. Rosie nodded and began walking in the direction, making sure to look back to see her parents walking behind her, holding hands. “Was the slide scary?” John chuckled as he tried to hide his discomfort. It was better now that he was reunited with his family. He still felt a little wobbly and shaken but that was nothing a good hug from Sherlock couldn’t fix. “Oh yes, very scary.” Sherlock smiled sarcastically. Once they slid into the hot saltwater outside, John’s muscles relaxed and he wrapped his legs around his lover’s gorgeous waist, letting Sherlock guide his body. In the water, he was not heavy at all and he thoroughly enjoyed sitting on Sherlock’s lap and cuddling up against his love in the warm water. It was too good to be true.
Thank you for your support.
The next couple of days were spent with a lot of massages from Sherlock, a lot of great food and some small walks wrapped in a warm jacket for John. His belly grew, his baby kicked and he was happier than he’d ever been before. Especially because he often caught Sherlock watching him when he thought John couldn’t see him,  that small lopsided smile John loved so much on his lips. It was an amazing time.
Sherlock had to admit, the whole building-of-furniture that was apparently made by utter idiots was completely worth it. He got a small kiss and a hug from John afterwards and couldn’t stop blushing. “Do you want to do a pregnancy health class where you strengthen your muscles for natural birth?” he asked as he helped his best friend to stand up again. John found it an adorable and nice idea and soon, Sherlock had signed them up for a class for the next week.
John was awoken by the clattering of pots and pans and when he got to the kitchen, he saw Sherlock with an apron around his waist, cooking them dinner. John came up behind his love and hugged him, burying his face between Sherlock’s shoulder blades.
Soon, the baby furniture arrived and Sherlock was swearing and huffing about how dumb the instructions were and how nothing fit and was right and whatnot. John sat on a comfy pillow in the middle of his old bedroom, watching Sherlock put everything together. Of course, the detective did it in the end and John was amused by his love, cooing to his baby belly how Papa was very upset because everyone was so dumb. But the baby would not be dumb. Other people might have worried about Sherlock becoming a father when just putting together some furniture already provoked such outrage but John knew his love would be amazing with their child. If only he finally knew what kind of relationship they were in. Were they friends with a happy little accident? Or boyfriends? Lovers? Possibly more? He preferred boyfriends.
He got behind John and while kissing the man’s neck lovingly, slowly pushed in. Sherlock’s penis was not too girthy but it was long and soon it stretched parts of John that fingers couldn’t reach. As soon as Sherlock was in entirely, they both took some breaths and a few seconds for a loving kiss before John whined “Move. I need you. I missed you so much.” Sherlock complied and began thrusting in and out of John, picking up the pace when his darling ordered him to.
The bright smile in his face wasn't enough to express his happiness though and he jumped at John, knocking him over. John ended up on his back, in the garden, on a beautiful summer day and with his secret crush- now officially boyfriend- in his arms.
John’s jaw dropped. That number was far too high for his liking but he knew it would be the correct one because it came from Sherlock. “It’s far too high. I am so sorry. Sorry isn’t even the right word. Shit.” he sighed, now massaging his temples again to lessen the stress. “I wanted to make it up to you with kisses. That would be 13, 284 if you like the idea of kissing me at all, that is,” he added.
Right. Okay. He could work with that. John gave a nod and gestured to the stairs but the words got stuck in his throat so he just nodded another time and made his way towards and then up the stairs. He found Sherlock's door without a problem, thanks to the golden plate that clearly had his name on it. It would be polite to knock but what if Sherlock was sleeping? In that case, John didn't want to wake him. He stood in front of the closed door for another minute before entering without knocking. The room was pretty dark, there was barely enough light to see the long figure in the bed.
Come on. You can just bring her. SH
you to forgive me right away. But I want to make it up to you.” he explained and suddenly he was the one looking down at the blanket and being embarrassed and slightly sad. If was only fair, he supposed.
Boyfriend. Oh. So that’s what they were. Sherlock’s mind accepted it as a fact for now and he cuddled John close, humming “John, your hormones are taking over again, huh? You’re the best mother our child could have. Sit down for me?” as he guided his darling to sit on a chair right next to Sherlock. Then he quickly continued cooking and once the  gratin was in the oven, he was finally able to cuddle his love properly. Slowly, Sherlock let one of his large thin hands cup John’s cheek before he pressed a soft kiss to his boyfriend’s lips and asked “What do you think about some wellness tonight?”. He got a nod and a little grinding of John’s groin against his as a response. Plan confirmed.
When he woke up, John again had to run to the bathroom. He had been sick every morning for a few days now and suspected he ate something wrong. As he hung over the toilet and retched, he hoped that he wouldn't wake Sherlock who was sleeping in the next room.
Dinner ended up slightly overcooked since John couldn’t let go of Sherlock to take the gratin out of the oven. Neither of them minded. John finished half the bowl alone while Sherlock only ate one portion. Well, that was more than hunger for two. More like hunger for four. It was better to see John eating enough for 4 than to be worried about his eating though.
Once they had reached the park, John could barely hold her back. He still made her promise not to run around and to play very calmly. He watched his little girl climb up and slide down the playhouse multiple times until she waved to him and pointed towards the swing, always making sure her daddy knew where she was. John nodded and gave her thumbs up when his phone buzzed.
Sherlock didn't answer, he only asked his mother "Mummy? Can John come over for lunch? We want to talk. "
"Because he doesn't feel so..." Mycroft started but was interrupted by his mother who jumped up and stood right in front of John.
*[not est.] John and Sherlock have both been invited to Mrs Holmes' 65 th birthday. Everyone assumes they are a couple although they came as friends and were both invited.)
Run. Run. Run. Run. RUN! his mind screamed at him over and over again but John couldn’t. He was afraid if he stood up now, his legs would fail him. Or worse: they wouldn’t and he would run away from his daughter. The man waved at him but John could barely see him. The edges of his field of vision were blurry and tiny colourful dots danced across the darkness when he blinked, leaving a fading imprint for another second after opening his eyes.
One day when he came home from solving another case without John, he entered the room to find John getting a lower back massage from Mrs Hudson who was chatting with him.  "Mrs Hudson, out," he ordered and the lady scrambled to comply.
“Knowing it and seeing it are two different things.”
While John was as happy as could be, Sherlock became more and more frustrated.
“Let’s sleep. You need it.” he whispered as he finally let is head drop to the pillow so his mouth was pressing a never-ending kiss to John’s forehead. “I Love you.” John sighed as he fell asleep in his lover’s arms with Sherlock’s big hand on his baby belly, keeping the child safe. “I love you more.” Sherlock whispered back happily as his eyes fell shut as well.
“Bye Daddy! love you!” Rosie grinned as she waved her tiny little hand in John’s direction. John waved back with a smile and a slight nervousness tingling in his chest. He knew the mother of Rosie’s friend very well. She was very nice and Rosie had already been to a few playdates with this family. She always seemed perfectly fine and happy, albeit tired, when he picked her up. There was no reason to worry. Still, he stood for a moment longer after the door had closed, hoping Rosie would come and ask to go home while also hoping the door would stay closed and his little girl would have a great time. Eventually, he turned around and began walking back in the direction of Baker Street.
Sherlock buried his face deeper in his mother's jacket again, tears coming up again. "I only want Jo-o-o-o-hn." he sobbed and his entire body began shaking from the crying again.
"John? Hey. Uhm, I made you some food. I'm coming in." Sherlock announced when he had once more gotten John his favourite food. When he entered the room, there were clothes thrown everywhere. It looked like the closet exploded. John was laying in bed, in between his clothes which seemed to kind of form a nest around him, with his back turned to the door. Carefully, Sherlock made his way through all of the clothes and set the tray down on John's bedside table. He couldn't see his friend's face since it was hidden underneath the blanket. "John. I am sorry about what I said to you. About you not being the person I wanted to be friends with anymore. I'm sorry. Please eat." he asked but didn't get an answer. He could see the blanket shaking a tiny bit and then there was a tiny sniffing noise. When he tugged the blanket back and out of John’s grip forcefully, he spotted his best friend's face, red, blotchy and covered in wet streaks. "Oh, John." Sherlock sighed and wiped the man's face off with his own sleeve. "I’m sorry for what I said. I was angry. We were both angry. Please talk to me. I know that was a lot not good. John. You told me forgiving is important too. Talk to me." he begged worriedly.
When Sherlock saw the tears in John’s eyes, he yanked his hands back as if he had burnt himself. Alarms blared in his mind palace; he had done something wrong. Immediately, hypotheses of what he might have done and doubts swamped him. But then John took his hand and suddenly everything was still. He could only hear his heart and John’s voice. His secret love sounded so sad. For the first time ever, Sherlock could identify that emotion without thinking or doubting his conclusion and it was important to him. “Why are you sad?” he asked with a worried frown.
The blue-green speckled eyes darted away, now nervous and upset again.
“Daddy, you have to let me go so I can get ready.” and he relaxed all of his muscles.
"Sherlock? Are you okay? You’re looking a little sick," John asked with an innocent and slightly worried expression.
"John? Your car is here." Mycroft whispered from the door.
"Why would you need to leave me?" Sherlock croaked out quietly, with his vision becoming blurry from tears as well. It felt like he was far away from John, strangely separated like there was a wall between them, despite being right here, close enough to touch him. The wall seemed not to let anything through and Sherlock was about to repeat his question when John moved.
A few days later John had already forgotten all about that weird feeling. He had finally managed to convince Sherlock to come along to Rosie’s swimming class since he was tired of being the only guy there. Sherlock had promised not to make any deductions while the other parents were there. Surprisingly, he kept his promise. As soon as the class was done, Rosie asked if they could stay longer and if Papa would come on the big slide with her. “Well, but what if Papa is afraid?” Sherlock asked in one of his silly voices. His blonde daughter let out a little giggle as she promised “I’ll protect you from the slide monster, Papa. It’s fun. Pleaseeee????”. John didn’t need to look up to his love to know Sherlock was already smiling lopsidedly and had made up his mind. He promised to wait at the end of the slide with a camera to snap a picture of his boyfriend and daughter coming out. Oh, how many times he had gone down that slide with his little girl. A few pairs of swimming trunks had met an early demise due to the girl’s enthusiasm for slides. As he waited, John leaned against the wall, keeping an eye out for shadows in the slide so he could be ready to take the shot.
"I'm so sorry for inviting him, bee. I thought it would be good to have someone you like here. I'm sorry." she apologized before pressing a soft kiss to Sherlock's head.
Sherlock noticed the change in his best friend. It hurt him to see John eat less and he encouraged John to eat more. He used similar phrases to the ones John had used on him and made sure to leave out the approaches that hadn’t worked for him when he had struggled with food. They fought often about eating and food and what to cook now. More often than not, Sherlock was the only one eating. Which, admittedly, was a very strange feeling. He had always been the one not eating before and John had sat on the kitchen table alone with his food so often but now it was Sherlock sitting there. He was afraid, worried for the baby and felt utterly lonely during his meals. Despite all of that, he continued encouraging John and bringing him his favourite strange food.
That question. The mere question made John turn around with tears in his eyes. “Sherl…” he croaked with pain showing in his eyes. Very gently, to not scare Sherlock further, he took one of his friend’s large oily hands in his. “Sherl. Of course. It’s our baby. Yours. And mine. Honey.” he mumbled sadly.
Most onesies were too big but honestly, John had never seen anything this cute. As soon as his love spotted his tears, he found himself wrapped in a worried and loving warm embrace. “Sherl. These are wonderful. My tears are happy tears.” he soothed his darling. He could feel all the other women watching them jealously and he was so glad he had such a great (boy???-) friend. They left the shop with a big bag of beautiful baby clothes.
"I am not gay," John repeated.
Blog entry: break
There were a few women in there without their husbands. “You go and stroll around, Sherl. I need to look into things for mothers.” John smiled to give his darling a chance to search whatever he had been looking for. When he had gotten through the breastfeed section and was picking out little plain onesies for their baby, familiar hands snuck their way around his waist to stroke his belly.
John was still standing with his back against the wall, confused and without a clue what to do now. "Shit." he sighed and lifted a hand to his face, massaging his temples with middle finger and thumb. "I...I need to fix this, right? Can I fix this?" he asked into the room.
John was not having it though. He tipped Sherlock's head up and in his direction with one finger and asked, with a deep look into blue-green speckled eyes “Sherlock, on a scale of 1 to 10, how much did I hurt you by saying I was gay as long as we’ve known each other? Be honest.”
Heat welled up inside of him and he had to open his jacket to cool off. This bastard. Logically, John knew Sherlock loved Rosie to bits and pieces but how could he be this insensible? With all the frustration occupying his mind, he didn’t even notice how the heat of the anger concealed the cold sweat that was running down his back. Even after going through a breathing technique from his therapist, he somehow could not relax truly. And then Rosie shouted for him with glee. She waved to him from the swing. Behind her was a man pushing the swing. Muscular. Blonde. Dangerous.
"Well, it's just that you are not really stepping in to do that. You can take care of me, of course. And I think you'd be good at it. But you haven't shown any interest in that so far." John nodded as he patted the space next to him. Sherlock sat down with a huff and looked at his lap.
Suddenly, he felt the baby kick his belly a tiny bit. He breathed in harshly although it didn’t really hurt. His first instinct was to grab Sherlock’s hand and let him feel the next kick which is precisely what he did. His eyes found Sherlock’s and he mouthed ‘stay’ at his friend, not wanting him to pull away now. Sherlock seemed to relax a little again and a faint twitching of his lower lip told John all he needed to know. The longer Sherlock looked at John, the stronger the twitching appeared to be until his lips finally broke out into that beautiful lopsided smile which made John feel warm and giddy. John responded with a smile and a gentle nod, understanding Sherlock’s nonverbal confession. After those minutes of wordless communication had passed, there was another soft push against Sherlock’s hand. His eyes widened so much, John thought they might as well fall out of his eye sockets any moment.
Soon, John could feel large warm hands kneading his lower back. It was comforting and Sherlock was better at it than Mrs Hudson. Within minutes, the pain was gone and John was humming contently. "Mmh, you're good at this." he smiled softly.
That gave Sherlock the rest. He couldn't cry in front of all these people so he ran as he had always done as a child. He only regained a sense for where he was when his wet pillow obstructed his airways. He was in his old room, filled with all of his old belongings. He had cried in there so many times. So many times that the tears wouldn't stop coming now. So Sherlock did what he had always done, he cried until no tears would come anymore.
"Upstairs," Sherlock said, heading up to the spare bedroom. He kicked open the door gently, setting the box down on the bed and looking around the mostly empty room. It was a bit dusty, the hard-wood floor bare.
"I'm going to take a shower. Meet me in the bedroom when you're done, there's something I'd like to do." John ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair before grabbing his pyjamas from the bedroom and walking into the bathroom.
The ordeal with Mycroft and Greg, was exhausting. Sherlock couldn't remember his brother ever looking so…distressed, as much as Mycroft could be anyway. Everything had gone smoothly though, and Sherlock was there when Mycroft held his daughter for the first time, Elizabeth Victoria Lestrade-Holmes. She was beautiful. He also had never seen his brother look like he did when he held her, his gaze...warm. Still, Sherlock didn't like to be gone away from his family, so he left.
“She’s not going to die, John.” Sherlock’s voice was soft as he spoke. “She would have done so by now; she’s not going anywhere.” His fingers gently moved through the hair at the base of John’s neck and let out a soft breath.
John growled possessively, moving until he was pressed up against Sherlock. He pushed into him in one long thrust, snapping his hips a little towards the end.
Sherlock smiled, listening to Katherine babble more aimlessly about going to the park in the snow and making angels. He felt his ears warm as John mentioned the test, and he swallowed thickly and shrugging. "I...it might be too soon to tell," he murmured quietly in return, resting his head against John's.
John returned from his interview a little over two hours later, hanging up his coat and pulling off his tie. He noticed Sherlock –
John smiled softly, booping Katherine on the nose. "You're just a greedy little girl, aren't you?" he murmured, handing the food over to Sherlock and getting up to eat.
He hummed again, the corner of his mouth quirking up fractionally as he curled his knees up, bumping into John's and all but surrounding Katherine between the two of them.
"What is it you're studying?" Sherlock asked, watching John in the kitchen.
That week was perfect, just John and Sherlock in the silent woods, together. Sherlock's cold cleared up for the most part by New Year and they watched the fireworks from the clearing in the woods, the colours bouncing off of the snow. Sherlock was almost reluctant to go but that changed as soon as he saw how overjoyed and excited Katherine was to see them again. He scooped her up and pressed small kisses to her face as she rapidly told both of them everything she and her Gran had done, baking, colouring, visiting Aunt Harry and Clara when they came back. Sherlock smiled, resting his head on John's shoulder in the cab home. His birthday was in two days, but really he already felt he had everything, deciding not to bring it up. What else could he want?
Katherine wrapped her arms around her Papa's neck, holding onto himself. "But why going away?" she asked. "Where going? Going 'way like Daddy did a'fore?" she asked in a small voice, remembering how sad Papa was before Daddy came to the flat. She sniffed, looking down.
John wrapped his arm around Sherlock's shoulders, kissing the top of his head. "I love you. We're going to get no sleep tonight, but I love you." He smiled, nuzzling against Sherlock's temple.
Sherlock shrugged a little. "Depends on how many people decide to murder someone else. Though I've done some thefts and kidnappings," he said.
John let out a slightly irritable sigh, wrapping his arms around Sherlock and holding him close. He combed his fingers through those errant, dark curls, twirling one around his finger and humming softly to himself.
Sherlock winced as John yanked on his hair, glaring back at him. "Well it's not as if you'd be around to stop me," he muttered without thinking. He knew Katherine would still need him, and the pup...but his life without John, without John he wouldn't have life in the first place. "So I guess you'd better make sure you come back John," he said softly, leaning forward and crushing his mouth against the Alpha's so he didn't hear him complain.
Sherlock smiled as soon as John opened his eyes. "I'm fine... Katherine's fine... you're going to be fine too," he said quietly, touching John's hair lightly. He let out a breath, squeezing John's hand. "You were sick, the flu and... the vomiting ruptured a couple ulcers... and then they found more, and removed them," he said quietly, looking down at John's torso.
Sherlock felt himself set down on a bed, and tried to sit up a little.
John shrugged. "Not much to do for now. Should go to your favourite place in the world, though. They'll check your vitals and record them, make sure everything's on track, give an estimated due date and put you on record for having pups, which will basically just guarantee that they'll have a bed waiting around your due date so that we can get in." He chuckled softly to himself, tracing around
Sherlock let out a breath, a low whine in his chest. "I know...I know that I just...Katty sounded so upset when I....when I wasn't myself," he said quietly. He leaned into John's hand, humming slightly. "I love you...and I'm sorry I did that. God, I could have hurt him.”
Sherlock felt adrift, like he was at sea, so tired. He heard Mycroft’s voice, and felt the sense of security he’d felt when he was younger and he heard it. Thunder storms were the worst, but nights in general were always hard.
Sherlock wet his lips a little, looking at John steadily. "So... you're not... upset with me?" he asked quietly, not sure why he needed to hear it. He'd been feeling off for a while, and he supposed this was why. "You want this?" he asked.
"She is, I needed time to think. Work," he said quietly. "And I was thinking about it yes," he murmured. He stood up, getting a large glass of water and bringing it back to John. "Sit up real quick and drink this. All of it please, you'll thank me later when your head hurts less," he said quietly, holding it out.
"I told him to get back into bed, he wouldn't listen," Sherlock said quietly, still feeling sick.
Sherlock stood, nudging off his shoes and climbing into the hospital bed. He was on his left side, facing John, John curled on his right since his left shoulder was his bad one. "Wherever you need me." he said, not sure if John wanted to spoon or if he should just curl up into his chest, so he waited, going at John's pace.
"Don't worry about it," John murmured, scraping his teeth over one of Sherlock's nipples. "I've got you, baby," he promised, rising back up and looking down at Sherlock possessively. "On your front," he commanded, shifting back so that Sherlock could move.
“A wound, yes. Because I fixed that. You can continue lying to yourself but it will never sit properly with you because you know better. You know that I’m telling you the truth. Because I’d wager it’s the only thing that’s felt proper to you since you died.” John blinked a few times, looking at the other. How could have possibly known that?
"I have no intentions,” John said. “I was at that auction because my friend dragged me along, and I bought him because I'm a doctor and I wanted to save him. As soon as he's healthy he can do as he wishes." John stared at the other Alpha, trying to glean anything from his expression.
John smiled. "I just want to get home sooner. I'll be right back." He turned to go, then turned back and kissed Sherlock chastely. "Love you," he whispered, pulling away and walking quickly towards the refrigerated section of the store.
"I'll stop if you want me to. It's just... I don't know. I feel so helpless, like there's nothing I can do for you." John sighed, looking up at Sherlock and meeting his sharp gaze. "It just makes me feel like I'm doing something. And I enjoy it, so there's that." He shrugged, nuzzling against Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock let out a breath as soon as John was gone, letting how tired he felt show. He swallowed, then pulled out his phone, tapping away at it for a bit before tossing it onto the sofa, agitated. He sighed, willing himself not to be sick, though he knew he wouldn't be. It just felt like it, but he could always tell the difference.
Sherlock reached down under the water and took John's wrists, lifting them weakly and resting them around Sherlock's stomach, resting them there. He hummed again. "Water...will get cold." he mumbled, his head already rolling to the side a bit as he started to drift off, despite trying to say that wasn't a good idea.
Sherlock sighed a little, nodding. "I would have before... but they wouldn't let me past the gate security," he murmured quietly, thinking back to watching John walk away at the airport, not fully knowing if he'd come back. He did come back though, and that was the most important thing.
"I have to be in at the same time tomorrow," John whispered, "and every day after that. Otherwise I don't get to be with all of the doctors."
We love you all and happy reading! <3
Draping his arm over his face, John gave a weak noise, not really knowing what to do. For a small handful of seconds, he wished that he was back in the desert. At least there he knew what he was doing. He had had an agenda and a goal – get back home to Sherlock. Now that he was home, he was lost.
Sherlock looked down. "Yes, well... I suppose it's what we're suited for," he said. "Like I said, our family was never extremely affectionate. My brother and I were close at one time, but then everything sort of drifted when he left for uni, and then got recruited to the government. And then after everything else... it's enough, I suppose," he said, glancing at John. "It's why I find your family and your interactions so intriguing and... confusing. What your mother said..." That was confusing as well. She'd met Sherlock twice.
John chuckled, eating more of the pasta. He stood after a while, pouring himself and Sherlock a glass of water before retaking his seat. "Yeah, cooking is one thing I can do," he said with another small laugh, starting to eat again.
. "I hear you," he nodded, though he wasn't sure he was being a hundred percent honest.
"I want go to school Papa," she said, licking her lips.
Sherlock smiled, squeezing his hand a little as the car pulled away. "I agree...good name. Just long." He cleared his throat a little, "It's not that important really," he said shaking his head, reluctant almost. John's name was nice, concise to the point. Sherlock didn't understand him not liking his middle name. Still, John finally coming home, he wasn't in the mood to deny him anything. He sighed, "William...Sherlock...Scott...Holmes," he said, looking over at John.
Sherlock cried out when John pushed into him, moaning softly as he did so, not wanting to wake up Katherine. He bit down on his lip, and tried to roll up his hips for some friction. "A-almost anything," he panted, knowing that the one thing he really wanted from John, John couldn't give him.
About twenty minutes later an officer came into the room, youngish by the looks of things, though he was starting to grey prematurely. "Are you John Watson?" he asked. "Detective Inspector Lestrade; I'm here to take your statement regarding illicit Omega trade," he said. "I was told you had information."
Sherlock scooted down a fraction so he could rest his head on John's shoulder, passing over the small baggy and what was left of the chips. “I've had enough, and you haven't eaten," he said, knowing John. He reached over to the small table and grabbed the orange juice, drinking off of it with a sigh.
something.
John shuddered, blocking out the image of Stephen bursting into his tent with a huge cup of coffee and a chocolate bar that his family had sent him for his birthday, tossing it to John's bed and declaring it the breakfast of champions.
“I don’t see why this is of concern to you Walters-”
John nearly sobbed, clutching Sherlock close to him--maybe his nails were digging into his back, he wasn't sure. He didn't answer with words, instead pressing his teeth to the outline of the mark. That was his promise--that he would come back, that they would still get married.
Sherlock looked up at John, feeling him press against him. He nodded, wrapping his arms around John, clinging onto him. "Yes... please, I want you to. I... need it..." he breathed, pulling John's face up and looking at him. His pupils were blown wide, somewhat manic in his heat, but he looked intently at John before crushing his mouth against John's greedily.
John leant into Sherlock's touch, his jaw muscle moving under Sherlock's finger. He knew Sherlock was lying about drinking something, but he decided not to push the topic. "Is this somehow helping you think, or am I distracting you?" he asked quietly, looking softly down at Sherlock.
"I'm not hungry, Sherlock," John replied kindly, starting the pot of coffee and leaning against the counter. He ran his eyes from the top of Sherlock's sleep-mussed hair down to his bare feet and then back up again.
"It's a little cottage. Two bedrooms and one and a half bath. Just a bit larger than here," John explained, twisting his hands together. "It's in the country, back in the woods outside of Cardiff. I just... thought it might be nice to find a place to get away if we ever wanted to."
I'm glad you're healthy and keeping busy. Nothing could make me happier than to hear that.
Four days after sending his letter, it was Sherlock's birthday. He didn't want to do anything really, but Molly convinced him, and so he and Lestrade (Mycroft had work apparently, which was his gift to Sherlock, no doubt) went to a pub.
He quickly pushed a finger in beside his tongue, working Sherlock open as quickly as he could without actually rushing.
I love you so much, Sherlock.
“Well, then perhaps we could explore this topic further,” Sherlock said with a rare smile directed at his companion.
John just tightened his hold on Sherlock, pulling him back into his embrace and shaking his head slightly. "No you're not, and that's fine," he whispered, running his fingers up into Sherlock's hair. He pressed a quick kiss to his cheek and backed off a little, cupping Sherlock's face and looking at him intently. "You should go," he whispered, stroking his cheekbones with his thumbs. "I already told Harry that we're not going over there."
Pushing out of bed, John made his way into the living room, walking up behind Sherlock and wrapping his arms around his waist, even though he was playing his violin. "That's the best way to wake up," he murmured, his voice muffled from his lips brushing along Sherlock's bare shoulder.
"Papa? Daddy?" John leaned up, looking towards the door to see Katherine standing there, wiping at her cheeks. "Can I sleep with you?"
your brother."
John jumped awake will a small scream, quickly stuffing his fist into his mouth to muffle it. He was covered in a cold sweat, his body shaking like mad. Leaning over the edge of the bed, he closed his eyes, breathing deeply as he fought off what remained of his nightmare.
"Sherlock..." John looked down at his tea, unable to stop himself from thinking about the last time he and Sherlock had drank tea together. "Of course you're her daddy," he whispered, looking back up at Katherine and beckoning her forward until she was sitting between his legs. "So long as she's okay with it," he added, combing through Katherine's dark curls.
Sherlock felt John shift a small bit, and he pulled his eyes open just in time to see a nurse leave. He swallowed, blinking a few times as he turned his gaze to John. "Morning," he murmured drowsily, sitting up a small bit.
Sherlock nodded once, wetting his lips, running his fingers over Hamish's belly, still keeping his hand on him. He looked at John, tongue flicking over his lips once more. He didn't want them to get sent away, he didn't want them to get taken away. Not again, they were his...
John groaned, closing his eyes to try and pretend he hadn't just had another nightmare. He could feel that Sherlock was awake beside him, his breath not nearly slow enough for him to be sleeping. "Go to sleep, love," he murmured. "You need to sleep."
"Hey, whoa, easy, baby, easy," John whispered, picking Katherine up and holding her tightly against his chest. "You're alright, and so am I," he murmured, nodding across the room at Greg and smiling when he saw the infant in his arms. "She does look a bit like Mycroft, yeah," he said to Sherlock as he ran his hand over Kat's back. "Greg, has she said anything while we've been gone?" he asked, referring to Kat, who buried her face against his neck.
Sherlock sighed, sitting up a little and reaching up to the counter to get the thermometer. He stood up carefully, getting a flannel down and wetting it down with cool water, wringing it out. He sat back down carefully and waited for the device to beep before carefully draping the flannel over John's shoulders and around his neck.
John looked after Sherlock for a short moment and gave a small sigh. At least they were both going to be here to raise Hamish. Shaking his head, he walked out after his mate, tugging on his shoes and jacket. He helped Katherine into her coat and boots, kissing her nose before he stood back up. "Everyone ready, then?" he asked, his hand on the doorknob.
John met Sherlock's gaze, for the first time seeing a hit of a spark in the depths of his mercurial eyes. "You sound better today," John noted, rolling the shirt down to cover the Omega's side. "More alert, at least." He had noticed the way Sherlock had avoided the food question, and he sighed. "Why are you so against putting something in your stomach? Even a little broth?"
." she almost shouted and stabbed John's chest with her index finger. "Because
Rosie was now able to escape from her daddy’s arms so she kissed him on the cheek and got some fresh clothes and towels for them both. She put them in the bath where she found her daddy already under the shower.
Well, that made John tense up a little bit again. He reopened his eyes to look at his love and sat up (with a lot of help from Sherlock). “Sherlock. Love. Only if you really want to. Don’t do this for me, I want you to want it just as much.” he determined.
Mr Holmes only shrugged and Mycroft spoke for them all by saying "I suppose you can try but it is my brother's decision."
Sherlock and I will be taking a break from solving cases. We’re sorry to all the people trusting us to help but Sherlock needs to be treated for Hyphema. We will be back.
The nice and matronly lady was suddenly looking a lot stronger and a lot more frightening. "Because of
have feelings for you." John whispered gently, stroking Sherlock's curls. He knew the man wouldn't remember much of this the next day. With half-open eyes, Sherlock mumbled in the saddest voice John had ever heard "But you're not gay.". It broke him a little bit to hear Sherlock's voice like this, "I am not gay. I am bi, Sherlock. Bi." John mumbled back with the tiniest of sad smiles.
After a few more nights spent cuddling and with nice dreams, the day of the first training session had come. John had gotten some workout clothes to fit his, by now, positively huge belly and he excitedly took Sherlock’s hand as they went in. The training was quite exhausting and required a lot of intimacy, especially when the women and John had to squat while their partners stabilized them and were allowed to give a massage or two.
“We can go as slow as you like. Look at me?” he asked gently and cupped Sherlock’s cheeks to tilt his head up again. He was not going to kiss Sherlock since he knew that would not be welcomed right now. But he had an important question and honestly needed to look into the soothing eyes to ask it. Once his eyes had found Sherlock’s, he felt strong enough to finally ask: "Sherlock Holmes, do you have feelings for me and want to be my boyfriend?"
