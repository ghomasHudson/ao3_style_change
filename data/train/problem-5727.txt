Tony gave him a look.  “Not helping,” he sing-songed, and shut the door.  He was fairly certain he heard Jarvis chuckling on the other side of the panel.  Rolling his eyes, he headed back to the bed, twirling the stem of the blossom between his fingers.
“And that's the response that we've gotten from anyone competent, and anyone incompetent would just make the situations they get themselves into about twenty times worse,” Maria said with a faint smile.  “Luckily, for the most part, they are decent people.”
Tony rolled his shoulders.  “When did you gain insight into the human condition, Jay?  Was this, when was this allowed?  I disapprove.”  He pointed in the general direction of the nearest camera.  “Want to make that clear.  This is my disapproval face.”
“So, what’s your assignment?” Tony asked as the room cleared, people gathering their things and making their way to the door of the conference room.  He leaned back in his chair, one foot braced on the edge of the table, clearly in no hurry to get moving.
“That’s either really smart or really dumb,” Tony said, making DJ smile.  He bounced his phone against his leg.  “How’re you doing, kid?”
Laughing, Steve took a few stumbling, awkward steps, doing his best to match her movements.  “I’m pretty sure that’s my line, ma’am.”
“I'm sorry, but he's not available to go with you,” Hammer started.  His eyes were locked on DJ, something unstable bubbling there just beneath the surface.  “He can't be rewarded with a jaunt off to the country, not when he's been such a-”  He swallowed, a forced smile slipping across his face.  “Problem.”
Sue heaved a massive copper pot onto its hook, barely glancing in his direction.  “Why punch when you have access to so much weaponry?” she asked, a finger tracing the bottom of the pot.
Tony slowed to a stop, his head tipping to the side as Steve darted through the front doors, his sneakers squeaking on the marble floor.  “One sec!” he called, and before Tony could say anything, he ducked into the coffee shop.
“Good choice.”  She straightened up, flipping the tail of her hat over her shoulder, and continued around the page.  “Remember, we are still having a non-denominational holiday party, but Ben Grimm reminds us that his Hanukkah party at the Baxter Building is on for this weekend despite the recent…”  Her mouth pursed.  “Unpleasantness with the squid.”
“Good evening, Miss Van Dyne,” Jarvis said with a smile.  “So good to see you, you get more lovely by the day.”
“Uh-huh.” Steve slammed the last cabinet door.  “Because you missed me, or because I have a slim chance of controlling your boss?”
“Oui?” Clint paused, looked down at DJ, who fished a small brass nut from his pocket, holding it up with a broad smile.  Clint nodded.  “Oui.”
Still, he held the ring up to the light, rolling it between his fingers.  The gleaming white gold had been worked with exacting care, the pattern evoking the angularity and precision of the art deco period.  Up close, the artistry was obvious, the fine, precise lines the work of a craftman of exceptional skill.  "This is very well done," he said, his thumb smoothing over the pattern.  He could feel the rise and fall of the pattern, his fingertips honed for any small deviation in metal.  "In house?"
"No," Tony said, unimpressed.  She turned traumatized eyes on Steve, and Tony straightened up in his seat.  "Steve.  Do not fall for it.  Do not-"
Steve leaned in, his forehead almost brushing Tony’s.  “This is a choice we have to make,” he said, his voice quiet.  “If I’m your employee, then yes.  You can ignore everything I say.  You can just-” He shook his head.  “Do whatever you want, and I can’t stop you.
The portal slammed shut with a crackle of light, and Tony, left utterly alone, stumbled forward a step, and then two, his hand still reaching for something no longer there.
“And we did,” Clint said.  He caught Happy’s hand and spun him in a circle, the muscles of his shoulders tensing as he manipulated Happy’s greater bulk with quick, efficient movements.  “And we do.”
Sam sighed, hitching his gym bag higher on his shoulder.  “Man, it's not like you got him drunk and tattooed your name on his ass.”  He stopped, his hand catching Steve's elbow and dragging him to a halt as well.  “You gave him something.  He made the choice to wear it.  You did not pressure him, harass him or threaten him to make him wear it.  You aren't checking on him, to make sure he's wearing it.  You're not turning it into a way to control him, or force him to do anything he isn't inclined to do.”
That made her laugh.  “You really aren’t,” she said.  Her fingers squeezed his, holding on tight.  “So-”
“Ready?” Stark said, straightening his own jacket with a flick of his fingers.  He held out a hand.  “Want to come stand with me?”
He didn't want to think about how long he'd been in love with Steve Rogers.  If he allowed himself to dwell on that, he would lose what was left of his mind.
Tony stared down at his Twitter app.  “And the reply, ‘I meant twelve each,’” he said, his voice reverent.  He looked up.  “Right.  Right.  So.”  He nodded.  “I am so turned on right now I’m actually dizzy.”
Jess considered her, her fingers tented in front of her mouth, her eyebrows arched.  “Darling.  You’re from Boston.”
“Yeah, I know.”  Rhodey’s voice sounded amused.  “You’re in my phone, Steve.  Got your own contact and everything.”
Steve considered telling him, in no uncertain terms, what he could do with his very generous offer.  Instead, he took a deep breath.  "Mr. Stark, I don't think-"
As everyone got to their feet, Tony clung stubbornly to his seat.  “No.  I’m not moving until DJ opens at least one-”  There was a rattle, and something slipped over his head.  Tony looked down.  “Is this…  Pasta?” he asked.  “Is this spray painted ziti on a ribbon?”
“I can’t recommend the training program,” Wanda said to Darcy, her eyes dancing.  “The instructor is very abusive.”
Steve took a deep breath and it hurt, it ached in a way he didn’t really understand.  A phantom pain, almost forgotten, almost buried.  Something he should’ve long since outgrown.
Peter fumbled at the nightstand, nearly knocking over the lamp as he tried to find his glasses. The room was still dark, but light spilled in from the window, a strange, uneven light, that seemed to lick across the glass.  Too early for dawn, and the light was wrong, it was too thin and too red to be the sun.
"I think I'm having a stroke," Tony said. "I'd say heart attack, but I actually know what one of those feels like and this is way, way worse." He scraped his hands over his face. "So. Steve is." He braced his hands on the edge of the bench and leaned into them. "Is doing a live press conference. With the reporter that got us into this mess, a reporter who came out because a magazine threatened to reveal his relationship with another man, and an idiot who tried to imply that the recent spate of tornadoes in the midwest was because God was angry that Target did an ad campaign featuring a gay couple.”
Steve choked on a laugh. "I hear alcohol helps," he admitted. "Which is why we've sent Happy to a bar."
Steve shrugged again.  “I know you have questions,” he said, “And I know I have no answers for you.”
"Yes, that," Steve agreed.  "So, his way of convincing a young man that he's better off without girls-"
“Object from OVER THERE,” Darcy told him.  “Because DJ’s looking very tense and if you add to that-”
“Peter,” Tony said, his voice cutting through the nervous babble.  Peter’s head jerked in his direction.  Tony took a deep breath, trying to keep his voice level.  “Go to bed.  If he needs to talk to you, he can do it tomorrow.”
Tony paused.  “What-  Is there anything I can do to help?  You, I mean?”  He shifted in his chair.  “What does Sam usually do?  Is there a usually in this situation?  Please don't let there be a 'usually,' Steve, this isn't-”
Steve extended a hand to him.  “Well, if you don't want me reading into things, maybe you need to stop with the double talk.”
“But I had no idea what would become of either of us.  I had savings, more than most would’ve, and I’ve never shirked a day of work in my life.  But I found myself, alone but for a small boy, at the grave of my husband, and-” She met Steve’s eyes squarely.  “I had no concept of how I would survive, let alone how I would protect him.”
“Me, too, what?” Stark asked him, flipping the suitcase suit around and snagging the handle.  DJ took hold of it with both hands and tugged it away from him.  Amused, Stark let him take it.  “You want to be my valet?  Sure, we can work with that.”
“Did you go up the trellis again?” Jarvis asked DJ, who scrunched down, concentrating very hard on moving the marbles into the jar.  Jarvis smiled.  “It is very tempting, isn't it?”
“Right, and none of them blame you,” Tony pointed out with a grin.  He shifted forward, and his knees hit pew in front of him.  “Most of them pity you.”
“That’s,uh, that’s my general state of mind, so…”  Bruce rocked back on his stool, rubbing a hand over his eyes.  “Not sure I can help you with that.”
He was perhaps eleven or twelve years old, absurdly small against the backdrop of the decimated lobby.  His thin shoulders rose and fell in quick, sharp bursts, his face marked by blood at the temple and beneath his nose.  It had dripped down to his t-shirt, splattered across the front, and matting his dark hair to the side of his head.  He was pale, his eyes feverish bright beneath lowered brows, but his chin was up, his jaw a sharp, hard line.
Tony's fingers touched his, and Steve turned his palm up so that Tony could grasp his hand.  “Tell me-”  He stopped.  “Nothing.  I don't need anything.  This is fine.”
DJ dropped his pencil, taking the letter with both hands.  He grinned up at Jarvis.  “Thanks,” he said, turning the envelope over and over in his hands, inspecting it from every angle.
Steve did his best not to smile.  He wasn’t entirely successful, but DJ appreciated that he tried.  “Don’t like teleporting?”
Steve tipped his chin up, letting him do it.  “I didn't want to lose anything.  It's a rental.”  Tony stopped giving him an incredulous look, and Steve grinned at him.  “Ready?”
“You, your sleeves rolled up, your hands buried in bread dough,” Tony said, leaning into Steve's touch.  “Barefoot.  Singing along to a song no one remembers-”
DJ shifted, his sneakers digging into the sand.  His head was tipped back, his hands gripping the straps of his backpack.  He glanced at Rogers, who gave him a nod and a slight smile.  “It’s going to be just fine, Deej.”  He looked up, the clean lines of his profile catching the light of the headlights. “Just…  Fly.”
"We all have our specialties, it is true," Jarvis said.  He emerged from the bathroom.  "Will you be needing me to run your bath, sir?"
That won him a slight shrug, but DJ didn't look up again.  He just shifted his weight on his stool, tucking his upraised leg closer to his chest.
The words rose to a dangerous pitch, and everyone else was silent.  Iron Man took a deep breath, hissing through the speakers. “And when I finally picked up on his armor signature enough to pinpoint his location?  I find this.  So I am.  A little.  Stressed out right now, and I’m not interested in anyone’s opinions about it.”
“Yes, we have, and yes, we will again.”  Obie leaned back against the desk, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Until I feel that you’re taking the appropriate precautions.”
Tony nodded  “If you want.”  He scooped his paperwork back into a folder, and started in on the rest of the mess.  He held out a wrench to DJ.  “Will you put this away for m?”
Mackenzie gave him a chiding look, her marker flicking against the side of the cup.  "Don't worry, I've got your scone warming."
Tony scribbled a signature along the bottom of a contract, and passed it to Pepper, who replaced it with another.  He gave her a look.  “Not signing this.”
Tony didn’t know how to say this, and he didn’t know why he was trying.  “I’m sure they’re worried about you,” he pointed out.  “I;m sure they’d-”
“Then we’ll figure it out together.”  His father shifted forward, and DJ caught a glimpse of the arc reactor's glow beneath his shirt, clear and comforting.
“You’re being rude,” Al said.  “To Captain America.”  Ellen could hear the capitol letters implied in the words.
“Something like that, yes, good, you may stick around and do the verbal heavy lifting for us,” Tony told her.  He leaned over the workbench, his eyes narrowing on DJ's work.  “What are you up to?” he asked.
She glanced up at him.  “What?” She braced her hands on her thighs and straightened up.  “Oh! No. I meant Bruce. I’ve told Tony things will go badly, too, of course, but this, this is all Bruce.”  She ducked around him, snagging a silver bucket from a shelf and coming back around Steve’s other side. He tried to step back, out of the way, and she waved a hand in his direction.  “You’re fine.”
DJ slipped his fingers into Steve’s, clinging to his hand.  He leaned into Steve’s side.  “Ready?” Steve asked, and DJ squeezed his hand.  “Okay.”
Jesse looked around the edge of the picture, nodding and smiling.  “And that makes this one-” She tapped the brunette, and Ellen recognized that jawline at last.
Tony saw the streak of movement, the flash of pale skin and dark body armor, and he honestly did not understand what it was until Clint slammed into the girl, their limbs tangling together, locking them together just as the bus went flying, end over end, to smash into the pavement right on top of them.  There was a roar, or maybe a scream, a sound of denial lost to the sound of metal crashing into the pavement, into the scaffolding.
Steve sucked in a breath, and he ached, right down to his core. “I’ll try not to let it go to my head,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.  “I think it’s time to put him to bed.”
Jan ignored him.  “I've been looking into venues for my soiree,” she said.  She looked down at her tablet.  “It's difficult finding something large enough, with the extras that I want.”  Her nose wrinkled.  “The best places are booked, of course, but there's still some options.”
"Uh-huh." Tony stabbed the 'speaker' option on his phone and went back to squinting at the section of circuit board he was working on, wishing that he'd left just a tiny bit more buffer space in the design. Sure, it was cheap and efficient to produce, but it was a bear to repair. He straightened up with a groan. "Past Tony was an asshole, you know that?"
“Thanks for calling, have a good day, talk to you again soon,” Steve said, and stabbed the disconnect button over Bucky’s nearly coherent swearing.  Chuckling, Steve headed for the door.  Before he managed to make it there, it started vibrating under a fresh assault.  “Hey!  Stop trying to break down my door!”
“It depends.  Would you like to be a social climbing man dating above his station or an uppity career woman?” Jan asked him.  “Or a cat?”
“Right,” Tony said, and before he could manage anything else, Steve was there, his lips gentle against Tony's.  Tony grinned, warmth washing over him.  “Secretly shacking up.”
“If she chooses to lay waste to the scientific community, she will require no assistance,” Thor said.  He sounded
“I cannot imagine anyone would inquire as to what you chose to watch tonight,” Jarvis said.  “And I see no reason to offer the information.”
“Yeah, Peter's gettin' too mature for us,” Happy said, before the two of them crashed into the quilt.  Jarvis took the chicken away from them.  Neither of them seemed to notice.
"You're talking yourself in circles so much you're making Jarvis sad," Sam said to Steve.  "That's an accomplishment right there."
“I'll wash dishes if you'll give me one of those,” Tony said, because the citrus smell was intoxicating now, cutting through his stuffed sinuses and his foggy head.  He licked his lips, suddenly aware of just how empty his stomach was.
"I'm here, Tony.  I got here, right on time, and there's candles and this tablecloth probably cost more than a year's worth of my old Army salary, and-"
It took an embarrassingly long time for Steve to convince his arm to move, to reach out and select a piece.  It clicked against the board, and Steve slumped back in his chair, trying to ignore the feeling of arousal that now curled low in his belly.  “Your move.”
“Why are we standing in the hallway?” Jan asked from behind them, and Steve nearly jumped out of his skin.
“Welcome to the club,” he said.  “Hogan!  Watch the elbows, you damn-” He ducked around Happy.  “Not everything is a boxing match.”
“Hmm,” Jarvis said, which was somehow both noncommittal and disapproving at the same time.  Tony was impressed.  “Perhaps sir would like his own piece of paper so he can write his own letter to Officer Rogers.”
“So I have that to look forward to,” his Tony said, as Steve’s Tony signed the registry with a flick of his wrist, and held the pen out to Steve.
Jan leaned to the side, looking around him.  “Is that Tony's room?”  Her face melted into a bright grin.  “Oh, I have to see this.”
Tony stared up at him, his hair a tangled mess, his jaw rough with beard stubble, and so handsome it made Steve's chest ache.  “You realize if you don't tell me, I'm going to buy him with a plate of french fries and get the whole story, but it'll be from his point of view, so maybe it's better if you-”
His fingers closed around the grip, and for a moment, he paused, somehow reluctant to hand it over.  But he pulled it free and set it on the counter between them.  Miss Potts picked it up, and the way she handled it made it clear that it wasn't her first time with a gun in her hand.  Her head tipped to the side.  “My, this has seen action.”  She gave him a quick, gamine smile.  “You've taken good care of it, but this has been used.  And often.”
Steve Rogers had never believed in love at first sight.  For him, love wasn’t a thunderbolt, it wasn’t a life changing in a heartbeat, in a breath.  It wasn’t a single instant of knowing, it wasn’t souls meeting, it wasn’t fate or destiny, or anything the poets wrote about.
The words echoed through the workshop, vibrating against his eardrums.  Natasha set the bottle down in the sink.  “No.”
“The appropriate references have been forwarded to your phone’s browser,” Jarvis said.  “The Guggenheim pages are very informative.”
Laughing, Tony fished a napkin out of his pocket.  “You'd think as a native New Yorker, you'd be better at eating on the move,” he said, wiping Steve's chin.
"What nonsense are you reading him?" Stark asked, his arms full of thin wooden dowels and swathes of multicolored paper.  He shoved some empty plates out of the way, clearing a space to work on the table.
“And Parker left half a durian milkshake in the back of my car, and now everything smells like dead socks dipped in rotten dairy,” Tony said.
The thug made a grab for him and Happy tossed the stub of his cigar in the air.  “Pull,” he called, his voice bright and breezy.
Steve glanced back over his shoulder, his face splitting in a grin as Tony leaned out the kitchen door, a cup of water in one hand and his chef's jacket unbuttoned to the waist.  "Hey," Steve said, and he sounded lovesick, he knew he sounded lovesick.  "Good night?"
“I know you’re humoring me, and I’m going to accept it because I am a magnanimous Lord of the Manor,” Tony told him.
“I'm doing a dramatic reading of this,” Tony said.  “Dinner entertainment.  We're going to-” Steve snatched the book out of his hand, and Tony rocked back in his chair, laughing so hard that his stomach hurt.  “Oh my God, Steve!”
“Looking forward to it, Miss Van Dyne.”  With a salute that didn’t seem at all mocking, Steve slipped out of the workshop, pulling the door shut firmly behind him.  A moment later, the door opened again.  Steve leaned back in.  “Next time you’re going to propose?” he said.  “Lock the door first.”
“Your parents married yet?” Harris asked and the look Tony gave him was equal parts betrayed and traumatized.
“Yes.” She smiled at Steve, who resisted the urge to sigh.  He shoved a hand through his hair. “Why else would you?”
DJ nodded.  “The laws.  The laws governing magic use.  On this plane of existence.  All the magic users, anyone who can, who can independently work magic, they meet.  To figure out the laws,” he said.  He dragged one leg up wrapping his arms around it.  “If you abstain, or dissent, you are outside the laws.
Tony’s eyes fluttered shut, just for an instant, turning his face into Steve’s palm.  He pressed a kiss there, making Steve’s fingers twitch.  “Well, it’s difficult to blame you.”  His eyes opened, meeting Steve’s.  “You were going to keep him, weren’t you?”
“Okay, so we were in the bathroom and Parker was having a crisis of some sort, where the hell were the two of you?” Tony asked Jess.
Steve shook his head. “Stay here,” he said. Tony waved him off, and he took a deep breath. “Are you going to-”
“Sorry,” Sue called, her feet moving quickly over the polished marble.  “Johnny's got a thing, and Reed thought it was best if we didn't come alone, so...”
Steve moved, and Tony went tense, his whole body drawing up tight, clearly bracing himself for something, even if he didn’t know what it was.  But Steve brushed past him, calmly stepping around him and pivoting on his heel.  Putting himself between Tony and the window.  Blocking the shot for whoever might’ve been lurking outside.    Tony’s mouth feel open.  “What-”
Duck gave her a look.  Jesse stared at him, her face impassive.  After a long, silent moment, Duck reached for his phone.  Ellen's eyes darted towards Jesse.  “What?” she mouthed.
“Not mad,” DJ said, and paused to think about it.  What was he?  It was hard to put the complicated things in his head into words, but he could do it.  “Just...”  He smiled at Franklin.  “Want you not to fight.”
Tony gritted his teeth.  “They can stay for a few days,” he said.  Obie’s mouth opened, and Tony reached for his water glass.  “Take the deal, Obie.  It’s better than the one you’ll get if you keep pushing this.”  His eyes met Obie’s.  “Do we understand each other?”
O'Brien's eyes flicked towards the ceiling.  "Mother Mary, grant me patience," he said.   He collapsed back into his seat, his weight hitting with enough force to make the wood creak.  He tossed a leg onto the top of his desk, leaning back in his chair.  "So.  You're putting your job on the line for this.  Of all things."
“How are you like this?” Tony asked, his fingers steepled in front of his face.  “How are you-” He squinted at Bucky.  “You?”
Tony pointed at the tray, and followed the clerk back to the counter.  He produced a small polishing cloth and smoothed it over the surface of the ring before holding it out to Tony, still cradled within the hollow of the soft fabric.
“It has been a long time since I saw that symbol.” Her eyes narrowed into sharp slits.  “A very long time.”
In the function room, he tied off the garbage bag, leaving it by the door for easy pickup, and looked around.  The mistletoe alcove was going to have to come down, but he just the thought of it caused a strange sort of twinge in his chest.  It took him only a minute or two to pull the bells free, and the rest, he left where it stood.
“And yet, you may not quite understand the scope of the hell you’ve unleashed,” Strange said.  “Let’s go.”
She smiled. “I've regretted a lot of things in my life, Stark.” Her head dropped back to his shoulder. “That was never one of them.”
She pulled a bowl from the shelf beside the cookstove.  “And if there’s one thing that the old ones disliked, it was the things that we built, the way we pushed back the woods and leveled the hills, making roads and castles and towns and places they could not go.”
"Really."  Steve reached down, picking a shred of cheese out of Tony's hair.  A crumpled up bag with a familiar logo was on the coffee table, along with a couple of dirty plates and a tipped over soda can.  Steve eyed the mess, amused despite himself.  "'Cause it looks like you scammed a burrito off of Bucky and the two of you passed out in my couch."
Steve was laughing out loud now.  “Yeah.  And it was fun, so I'm probably going to do it again,” he said.  He leaned in, and Tony caught the scent of his skin, sweat and soap and sunshine, mingled with the damp, sweet smell of the roses.  This kiss was just as soft, just as gentle, but Steve's lips found his full on this time, and Tony's eyes slid shut.
“I know my gluten,” Tony said, his shoulders hunched as he worked the rolling pin across the span of the dough.  “Don’t even-”  He reached over to the bowl, scooping flour up in the cradle of his fingers, scattering it across the surface of the dough.  “I know my gluten.”
Steve’s arms tightened, an involuntary flex of his muscles, and Tony stroked the nape of his neck, rubbing the tense muscles there.  “Yes,” Steve said, and Tony nodded.
Stark crossed his arms over his chest, not seeming to notice how that wrinkled his pristine silk shirt.  “You like engines?” he asked.
“Right.”  He stacked up half a dozen of them in the butcher paper, and folded it up around them.  He handed the packet over.  “One for each of you, and an extra one for you.”
“That's part of the problem,” Steve said. “Living in Avengers tower is...” He paused. “Like living in a very affectionate frat house, honesty. For the most part, everyone's fully invested in everyone else's business. So you try to make a date and somehow it ends up being twelve people yelling at each other over bowls of popcorn and containers of takeout.” He shrugged. “Did you ever try to flirt with someone in front of a sibling? They are going to make sure you fail. It's not even malicious. It's just instinct.” He spread his hands. “It's a lost cause, honestly, it's not going to work.”
“So, what?” Steve parroted back at him, and his voice was so much steadier than he'd thought it would be.
“Try it, I dare you,” Nebula said.  She grasped the handle of the knife holding her page in place.  “I’ll find you.”  She wrenched the knife free with a smooth, vicious movement and handed the paper over to Tony.  “There.”
“You're both insane,” Tony said, pointing at them.  “I'm going to go-”  He didn't know how to finish that sentence.  He gave a firm nod.  “Right.  Going to go do that.  That thing.”
Shaking off the thought, he kept walking.  The crowded streets of the market gave way to the narrower, twisting streets of the old city.  The buildings here seemed unstable, unbalanced, new layers added to the old without any consideration for the foundations.  What had been small, single story buildings when he was a boy now held extra floors, built on piecemeal where they were needed.
“A group of girls, newly arrived from Poland, disappeared from the piers before they could be collected by their families.  They turned up a few days later, unharmed but terrified, in the care of the Sisters of Perpetual Mercy.  They’d been railroaded into the dubious care of men who had plans to sell them into prostitution, or to the brothels.  None of them were willing or able to talk about how they got free, but the Sisters say a single man escorted them to the gates of the convent in the middle of the night, before disappearing without leaving his name.”  She looked up.  “A stolen truck was found a block away.”
“Do you want curses?” Jess asked him, her foot braced on the edge of the table.  “Because that’s how you get curses.”
“If you are going to be Dummy, can I oil you joints?” Val asked.  She gave DJ a pleading look.  “Or if you don't want me to, I can just watch the movie.”
“Super funny, not my fault you can't appreciate it,” Sam said, wandering after Jan.  “Come on, Pandora's opened the box, might as well see if we can't find some hope under the bed.”
Sue stared at him, her eyes suddenly bright.  “I'm going to hug you now,” she said, and Steve laughed.
Steve flinched, and Tony wondered if he could get through this without putting his foot in his mouth again. “But I'm nobody's idea of a good long term bet, and the longer we-”
Bruce tapped his fingers against the open page.   “You, you can’t just SKIP the noble gases,” he said, sounding affronted by that thought.  “They’re-” He gestured with a piece of bacon.  “They’re very important, Peter.”
And when he glanced at them, his dark, gleaming eyes locking with Steve's, Steve's mouth went dry.  One of Stark's dark eyebrows arched, his lips curving up.  “And who's this?”
“That, I fear, happened before I was born,” T’Challa said.  “Phillips set you up.  As guard and guardian.  As the keeper of the peace.  And now, in all likelihood, you will be king.  The king your country needs, desperately.”
“Is that better or worse than your Commanding Officer?” Tony asked, watching his noodles cook with a suspicious glare.
Clea settled herself on one of the stools, shaking her skirts out over her legs.  The fabric immediately enveloped the legs of the stool.  “I owe you an apology.”
DJ rolled over, ducking from one table to the next, trying to put some distance between him and his crash site.  “Jarvis?”
“Jesus, stop before you sprain something,” Tony said, snatching the sweatshirt from Steve’s hand.  Steve smiled at him, and Tony muttered something that sounded a lot like a curse. “You are a pain in my ass, Rogers, you know that, right?”
Clint glanced at Phil, who was frowning at the ceiling.  “Want backup?” he asked, mostly to Clint, but with the full understanding that Jarvis could hear them.
“Hey, man, don't hate me because I'm practical,” Sam said.  “Hate me because I'm handsome, clever and suave.”
Steve nodded, stepping to one side of the road to let a cart rattle past, wooden crates bouncing with each rotation of the wheels.  “Leave the property disputes to the tenants, got it,” he said.  “And the shops?”
Pepper looked back at Tony with a shrug, and he waved her off.  “Kitchen is my problem,” he said with a smile.  “Good night, Potts.  Good work.”
(sips tea) I do not want to know how long this has been in progress, 2020 was a completely lost year where I...  Struggled a lot with mental health issues.  Everything slowed down, or came to a complete stop, because it didn't seem worth it to try, when putting words on paper (metaphorically speaking) was such an effort and it seemed like no one cared.
Steve took a seat at the table, finding the seam of the paper and sliding a finger under the colorful paper.  He worked the tape loose, pushing the paper back with deliberate motions.  Sam set a cup of coffee down next to him.  “Maybe you should start on your presents now,” Sam said, taking a seat across the table from him.  His fingers cradled the cup, huddling into the warmth for a moment before taking a sip.  “If it takes you this long, we’ll still be waiting for you to be done on New Year’s Day.”
Thor slid off the bed and offered Miss Van Dyne a hand.  She took it, stepping delicately down to the floor.  "He's out back in the greenhouse with Bruce and Bobbi," she said. Thor bent over her hand, brushing a kiss across her knuckles.  She laughed.  "Why, my Lord, such cheek!"
Fury nodded, but his dark eye was sharp.  “Okay,” he said.  “Now, you ended up here, and we’re happy to find a safe, comfortable place for you to rest and wait, but you can also go back to the Tower.”  His head tipped forward, his eye narrowing.  “Last time you were here, you seemed comfortable there.”
He set the spoon aside.  “And before you can ask, there used to be two.  And the apple was added later, too.”  The apple was half peeled already, the mottled red and yellow skin trailing around the three little sweets like a ribbon.  “It seemed right.”
“DJ’s missing, we think he’s been kidnapped,” Steve said.  “And if that’s the case, someone might try to cover their tracks, and remove any records Hammer might’ve left.”
“Got me in trouble with the boss, if I get fired, I’m holding you responsible,” Tony said, pointing a finger in Steve’s direction.  “You.  Personally responsible.”
“I don’t control the roombas,” Harris said, handing her a ten, and accepting his change.  “You guys know that, right, Neena?”
“I'm just curious if this is an 'armed response' threat sensor?” Tony mused.  “Or is it more of a 'oh no, the 90 pound child has a rock' threat sensor?”
Tony cupped both hands around DJ's head.  “I know.”  He leaned in, pressing his lips to DJ's forehead.  “I know you have, and I hate that, so-”  He straightened up.  “You're going to humor me and go read a book or work on something while we're gone, right?”
Steve considered the pot.  He poked at the water with his spoon.  Tony watched him, affection curling through him.  “I think we're almost ready to go,” Steve said, with his usual confidence.  Tony wondered how much of that was faked.
Tony threw his hands in the air and headed for the kitchen.  DJ, Darcy and Harris all watched him go, their heads swiveling in his wake like spectators at a tennis match.
Tony waited until they were gone, the door shut behind them.  Then he threw back the covers.  Ignoring Jarvis’ disapproving look, he shifted to the edge of the bed, bracing his hands on either side of his hips.  “I need to talk to Rhodey,” he said.  “We’re going to have to contact Hammer.”
“Don’t-”  He barely got the word out before Tony was through the door and out of site.  Biting back a curse, Steve set off after him, his feet eating up the distance.  Steve ducked around the panel, stepping out into the crisp night air.  “Tony!”
DJ nodded.  “When?”  His fingers latched onto the hem of his shirt, tugging hard at the fabric.  Sue sipped her smoothie, curious.
“Do you not want wine?” Tony said.  “Because that's a mistake.  I have an excellent wine collection.  Amazing.  World renowned.  I know you Irish sorts stick with a good beer, but still-”
Jarvis paused, his head tipped to the side.  “Are you inquiring as to what the current discussion pertains to, or what the actual argument is about?”
Tony stared across the room.  Peter was sitting on the edge of the table, his head tipped forward as Bruce ran gentle fingers along his face and neck.  He’d said almost nothing since he’d woken up.  He’d explained what had happened in a few short, halting sentences, then he’d lapsed into silence, his thin shoulders slumped, his arms tucked in close to his chest.  His aunt hovered nearby, her face expressionless, an ice pack at the ready.
Once upon a time, there was a prince, who was lost and forgotten.  Once upon a time, there was a prince who had forgotten.  Once upon a time, there was a prince, who was seeking his way back home.
“Right,” Tony said.  He stepped past the armor, snagging the portable comm unit as he passed by.  “I'll be right back, this isn't-”  He tucked the comm into his ear.  “It's non functional, what else do you want from me, Coulson?”
"I heard you're busy championing the environment and the minimum wage," Phil continues, smiling now. "When you get a free minute, I figured you might like to take on the US Military."
Today, he is marching with students demanding common sense gun laws. He is wearing a hoodie and carrying a sign. He looks about twenty two. It took several news channels an embarrassing amount of time to identify the loud-mouthed "college student" as Captain America.
"Good cause," Tony agrees, confused how the hell he managed to make enemies among the eco-spirited hippies. Hell, he IS one.
"Hey sweetheart," Steve stretches on their bed, limbs long and sinewy under the covers. Tony knows he is naked under there. Tony's got Captain America naked in his bed, and instead of being ecstatic, he's mad about the twenty missed calls SI's PR division left on his phone.
Colbert pulls out a chapstick and runs it over his lips. "And I am miffed that you kissed Jon, and not me -"
"This is the one where he talks about the family," Phil opens it to a particular page. "Traditional families."
"Is this why she shot you?" Tony asks Steve, lying on top of him, their skins sweaty and cooling in the late evening air. "Because you tend to ignore all reason and go flying in to correct injustice?"
"It's okay, darling," Tony kisses him on the lips. "You tried to defend my honor. This time. Let go now, I gotta go talk to the big, mean sheriff about the national icon he's got locked up in county jail."
"No, not simple Steve," Tony shakes his head. "I mean, yes, I agree with you one hundred percent, but - STEVE."
Anderson Cooper asks Steve on live television what he thought about the President's EO banning trans people from serving in the military.
He gives to the ACLU, to Veterans' Support funds, to LGBTQIA support groups, to teenage suicide hotlines, to planned parenthood, to Greenpeace.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony says nonchalant. "What did you do this time, Rogers? And where the hell is Romanoff?"
on live TV. Anderson Cooper is a rabble rouser, Tony's always said. Cooper asks the question, and then sits back in his chair, letting Steve do the rest.
"Ehh," Tony settles back against the couch. "Keeps him busy, keeps the nation entertained. Can't complain."
"I have two things to say to you," Phil says, pulling out the remaining comics and laying them out on the table, "One, kids are the number one demographic that purchase superhero comic books. Two, the military still owns the rights to Cap's image and is planning on a new line of editions around the Executive Order banning trans people from serving in the forces."
"We weren't stepping out together at the time!" Steve defends himself. "I thought Peg had a thing with - well, your dad, actually."
"Your boyfriend is on TV again," Rhodey tells Tony, coming into the living room with a bowl of popcorn.
"Listen," Colbert leans in, his elbows on the desk, his face in his palms, "I am the first person to acknowledge that Stewart is a beautiful man -"
Steve picks one up and turns the page. Tony presses at his temples, anticipating the stress headache and the inevitable PR meetings.
deems himself worthy of any qualification to dictate anyone else's right to serve. It is blatant bigotry. In less than a decade, we will ashamed of this national conversation. We will be ashamed that this was even a question. We will be ashamed that we let a fear-mongering demagogue set the national agenda."
"Be as it may, you are a representative of the US military, and taking sides in a civilian demonstration -"
"Sounds wonderful." He leans forward to kiss him, Barnes' skin warm and sunburned under his fingers.
When Bucky Barnes is declared a free man, his mind restored (as much as it possibly can), he walks around the tower in soft hoodies with his hair in a man bun.
"The best argument for pacifism is made by men who've fought in wars," Steve spits out. "Are you telling me that I don't qualify?"
"You - are - an - expensive - habit - to - keep," Tony pants, thrusting in and out of the clutch of Steve's tightness. He is warm and tight and glorious beneath Tony, panting with exertion. They have been at it for a while now.
Tony recognizes several of the editions, and feels a foreboding weight settle in the base of his stomach.
this body to punch Nazis. My job description was to punch Nazis. They paid me seventy years of backpay for having punched Nazis. I served with other men who punched Nazis. There are comic books of me punching Nazis. I liberated concentration camps in Poland in 1945. Do you really mean to tell me that between me and the neo-nazi, I am the one who's got the wrong end of the stick?"
"For a country founded on the very ideal of freedom," Steve says with finality, "we have a terrible history of letting one group of citizens feel like they are somehow
When they win the lawsuit, and the US Government is forced to release the rights to Cap's image, and pay millions in damages, Steve promises Tony, "A quiet life from here on out. I swear."
Steve flushes, looking pleased with himself. Stewart sits back in his chair, looks at the camera, and says point blank, "Yes, for you at home, yes, I can swear to you. Whatever it is you are imagining? That felt
"You're such a fake, Rogers," Tony laughs, but takes off his t-shirt because he is not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. He knees up the bed, getting his hands on Steve's glorious chest and leaning in for a kiss.
"That was nice," Steve says. "You can donate to the VA here. The website should be down here on your screen right now. Remember, Colbert's promised to match all donations today, and our veterans need your help."
"Don't you sweetheart me, Rogers," Tony points an angry finger at him from the doorway. "Did you or did you not call Mitch McConnell a greedy, capitalist polluter with delusions of grandeur?"
"I am grateful that you didn't," Steve smiles at him from his spot on the little cot. He gets to his feet and kisses Tony on the mouth, his hands on the waist of the armor.
Tony answers the kid. "It is glorious. It is amazing. It involves far more bail money and federal investigations than anyone would have believed possible, but his cooking more than makes up for it."
"That's a new one," Steve frowns. "And in my day, a person who holds my views would have been called a moderate. It says a lot about how far right this country's major conservative party has slid that expecting 9/11 firefighters to get their due would be considered socialist liberalism, but that's where we are as a country."
"Fox News," Rhodey laughs. "They sent a newbie to interview Captain America. TV gold, I tell you. In three minutes, Steve's going to get the kid to pick up a sign and march with
"What's all this?" Steve comes in to the room, a wet towel hanging off his shoulders. He's just got out of the shower.
"Believing that government spending is good for the economy versus bad is a disagreement," Steve crosses his arms over his chest. "Believing that Santa is real versus unreal is a disagreement. Believing that a group of people are somehow worth
"That's not what happened," Steve defends, standing by the bathroom door in his boxer briefs, toothbrush still in his mouth.
"From time to time," Phil nods, his expression unchanging. "These editions," he places a thick stack on the table, "were released during Vietnam and contain horrible, xenophobic, anti-Asian rhetoric that they will make any reasonable person cringe."
"Ugh why Steve," Barnes groans with more feeling, answering the phone. "Steve. I am going to kill you. Where are you?"
show," Colbert announces. "I said to him, 'if Cap kisses me, I will match all the proceeds to the VA tonight.'"
"You were supposed to watch him," Tony points a finger at her. "I told you! He can't be allowed to pick fights in back alleys again -"
"I am sure you'll find a reason to," Rhodey sits down. "Scoot over, I like this part. Oh they sent a newbie."
"Tones," Rhodey picks up the remote to raise the volume, "EVERYONE's been watching your boyfriend on the news."
"So did McConnell," Steve languidly kicks off the sheets, stretching his arms above his head in a lazy, drawn out motion.
"Let the record show," Tony says, traipsing in to the cell in the PD office of middle of nowhere, Tennessee, still in the Iron Man armor, "that I was tempted to let you rot in jail for another day."
"You can't punch people, Captain," a reporter tells him during a press conference. "Even if you disagree with their beliefs -"
Steve gets to his feet. A staff member helpfully puts a bough of holly above their heads, as the audience cheers.
"Jarvis, wake me up when there's breakfast," he smiles contentedly, turning over. Steve usually makes
It just seems less adorable when six feet of All-American earnestness calls you from jail at three am and asks for bail money.
Tony couldn’t ask for more. He doesn’t deserve that. Fuck his feelings, Steve was his friend now and wasn’t a tad bit embarrassed to sit next to him or talk to him. Hell, sometimes Steve even ditched his jock friends to hang out with Tony in the lab, which he really kept his promise to not tell Fury.
Tony closes his eyes, tries to remember what Steve looked like. Short. Golden hair. Long fringe, combed to the side. Skinny. Pale. Pink lips. Ridiculously long eyelashes. Slender wrists, long fingers. Tomorrow, they’ll meet each other again. Definitely not Tony stalking-- no way. Tony doesn’t stalk Tony observes.
Carefully, he sets the boxes in a corner before raising both palms in the air. “Just a favour for Mr. Coulson. He, uh. He told me to get this in the lab.” His voice was the same, deep and smooth just like it was last year.
Great so, there his luck went-- Tony was just dreaming of mustering enough feelings to go over and actually say hi to Steve this year and. Well. That wouldn’t work out well now.
“Right, and I’m going to do my community service and not tell him you called him that, because he will stick his cane into your wheel the next time he sees you.”
Steve looked at him, sensing a trap.  Tony arched his eyebrows.  Steve looked back down at the tablet, scrolling through the dates until the found the first.  He stopped.  Counted zeroes.  Recounted.  “Oh,” he said.
He stood up.  “I know I seem harsh.  I know, the world seems so unfair, sometimes.  But when I inherited your father’s estate, even though no mention was made of you in his will, even though no provision was made for you, I knew you would be part of our family, and I would do anything I could to keep you safe.
“I cannot tell you how relieved I am to hear that,” Tony said.  “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to find out if I have any coffee in this apartment.”
Furbro reached out with one paw, playing idly with a long blade of grass.  Steve straightened up.  "And now he's at the end of that journey," he said.  "Facing the dragon that's rampaged, unchecked, through his kingdom."  On the table, a few of the dowels had been abandoned, almost within reach.  Steve rolled to his feet, reaching for one.  "And it's not his job.  He's not really a knight, after all.  Just a boy on a horse."
Hammer's spine straightened, his chin coming up. “Glad to be of service, Mr. Hogan. Especially when I benefit.”
“You knew that when you followed me?”  Steve nodded again, and Strange’s breath huffed out in an aborted, sharp bark of laughter.  “Then you’re a fool.”
“I've never been funnier,” Tony agreed. He slipped a hand into his pocket, pulling out a pocket watch. “Ah. How unfortunate, it's almost time for the show to start.” He snapped the watch shut with a flick of his fingers. “If you'll excuse us?”
Wanda sank down to sit the edge of the table, her legs folded at the ankle.   She leaned forward, catching DJ’s arm in hers.  “Or, it’s just possible you’ve been tricked.”  She pushed DJ’s sleeve back, ignoring how his tea cup tipped.  “Or maybe just misled.”
“Yes,” Stephen said.  “He went…  Farther than I had intended, both in distance and in strength, but the spell did its job, and made sure that he was unharmed.”
“Judging by your Netflix queue, mostly bad 90's romantic comedies,” Jesse said.  “How many Bridget Jones movies did they even make?”
He looked up to find Stark studying him, a faint smile on his lips.  Steve smiled back.  "You want to pick the story?" he asked, his tone polite.
Tony reclaimed the nine with a slight smile.  “I need that, thank you, and yes.  It’s very-” He snapped his fingers.  “Pop.”
He wandered up the nearest aisle, studying the cases that lined the sparsely filled shelves.  “I thought we burned everything associated with this project,” he said, scowling at the names printed on the tags.  “I absolutely remember remember serving a burn notice on this.”  He yanked the nearest case off the shelf, and flipped it open.  “This looks distinctly unburnt.”
In the dim light of the bedroom, he realized that Tony was stumbling, his hands gripping the railing of the loft, towards the stairs.  “Hey!” He flung himself out of bed, nearly ending up on his face as his feet tangled in blankets.  “Tony!  No, no, no-”
“Three times this year,” Pepper said, stirring her tea as she frowned down at the ledger.  “And twice last year.”  Her eyes darted up.  “Is he…  Worried about violence?”
“What the fuck-” The thug swung around, his head darting from one side to the other.  “Where the fuck did that come from, what is-”  Someone made a noise, like a choked off scream, and the thug spun back around, the club coming up.  “Who are you?”
“Yes,” Tony agreed, as Darcy went sprinting back up the aisle, laughing manically and clutching a fake wedding bouquet in each hand.  Three SHIELD agents were right behind her.  Tony watched them go.  “You might want to do something about that.”
"A common reaction to the very special decorating aesthetic around these parts," Tony said, amused.  He scrubbed a hand over his face.  "Do you like your room?  It's...  Better."
“He, uh, he has a suit of armor,” Harris said, and Tony slammed on the brakes, hard enough to throw DJ forward against his seatbelt.
“He’s very fast.” Tony’s hands came up in front of him, his fingers flexing into fists before relaxing.  “He’s…  Very fast.”
“My dad says I’m stubborn,” DJ said.  “That’s…  That’s enough for me.”  He took a deep breath.  “Could everyone sit down?  Please?  Making me-”  He stopped, his mouth working.  “It is making me nervous.”
“It's the nature of things,” Obie told him.  He glanced over at DJ, who was still chewing, slow and careful, on a bread crust.  “Don't you want a few children of your own?”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest.  “Actually, I don’t, because whatever you end up doing here ends up on my rap sheet, so…”  He gave a slight shrug, leaning back against the car.  “I think I’ll stay right here.”
His eyes snapped open.  Pepper.  Pepper.  That was bad.  That was all bad.  Pepper shouldn’t see, couldn’t-  The words were jumbled in his head, but his body was already moving, his hands pushing against the stone, trying to get his legs under him.
“I’m pretty sure Tony would fund it,” Sam asked, and Steve had to slow down, he was laughing so hard  Sam grinned at him.  “Put in a good word for me?”
Steve felt his cheeks heat, and he focused on taking a sip of his coffee.  “Yeah.  I’m-”  He did his best not to think about the early morning sunlight playing across Tony’s back, golden and warm, and the way the tattoo, still new and a bit raw, looked less like a wound than he would’ve thought.
Curious, Tony lifted the lid, releasing a waft of steam and the tangy, salty smell of melted cheese.  “Oh, fuck me,” Tony said, grabbing a stool and dragging it over.
DJ smiled at him, quick and bright, and Tony’s shoulders relaxed.  “But this was her favorite place, in the whole house,” he said.  “She loved it here.  She loved the quiet, she loved the fountain, she loved the fact that it was all hers.”  He closed his eyes, and he could almost hear her, the soft way she laughed, the way she sang, old, old Italian folk songs and the occasional aria.  “I used to sit here, because if I did, I had her all to myself.”
“Walls are fine,” Steve said, reaching for the fireplace poker.  He pushed the logs back from the edge.  Better safe than sorry.
"Wait, if you disabled the code, or messed with it somehow, and good job, good job there, Tone, letting that happen-" Rhodey started, and Tony flipped him off.  It was half-hearted at best and just won him a grin.  "Why didn't you just-"  Rhodey spread his hands.  "Fix it?  So you didn't get stuck in corners?"
“Take an honest lie over a complete lack of self awareness,” Tony said.  “Pretty sure it’s better.  Though I’m not sure how.”
“I agree, but a man who feels he’s been stiffed of half or more of what he’s been promised may not make good choices,” Steve said.  “I think he came here, hoping to find the men who hired him or what they were looking for.”
Behind him, Jarvis cleared his throat.  "Officer Rogers brought you the file on the most recent attack," he said, his voice crisp, and Steve snapped back to reality with painful suddenness.
Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket, pulling up the file he’d been working on with a flick of his finger.  “Are you good at your job, Monique?”
“I’m not surprised, I’m just disappointed,” Tony said, utterly deadpan, and Steve choked on a laugh.   “I really should have a questionnaire or some way to weed out this kind of a thing before it becomes a problem.”  He threw a hand in the air.  “‘Do you turn into some sort of octopus with separation anxiety after sex or do you roll over and go to sleep on your side of the bed like a reasonable person?’”
Tony checked his watch.  Late.  Later than it should’ve been.  With a sigh, he stacked up his paperwork.  DJ dropped the nut, letting it bounce across the bench before picking it up again.  Tony smiled, warmth flooding over him.  “You like that?”
Tony blinked at him.  “Wanna explain that one to me?” he asked, trying to smile.  “Doesn't feel good at all.  Not to me.”
He dropped his hands just in time to see Rhodey and Pepper exchange a glance.  “I think he IS your husband,” Pepper said.
“How about a movie?” Peter said.  “Movies are great.”  He picked up another cookie.  “DJ, have you ever been to a movie?”
Hammer blinked.  And then subsided back into his chair.  “Now,” he said, his mouth stretching into a broad, unsavory smile, “we understand each other.”
“My hand to God, I shall be here when you return, whole and unharmed and surrounded by small, well sugared children,” Tony said. “You may go now.”
“I’m not sending him back,” Tony said, cutting him off, and Steve went still.  Tony took a step forward, his head tipping up.  “I’m not sending him back to-” His mouth worked for a second.  “I’m not sending him back, Steve.”
"Hrumph," Jarvis said, giving Steve a sharp look.  Steve struggled against a smile.  "It will do.  For tonight."
Steve waved a hand at the coffee table.  “Got 'em.  And napkins.”  He held out a hand, and Tony handed over the beer.  “Thanks.”  He studied the label, his lips twitching.  “'Imperial Stout Trooper?”
“Right,” Steve said.  “A spy.  A sniper.  A fighter.  An underworld contact.”  He nodded.  “Who’s the demolition expert?  Mrs. Parker?”
That was as far as he got before O'Brien cut him off.  "Mackey's filed another complaint about you, Rogers," he said, his florid face tired.  He shut the door after Steve and headed back to his desk.  "You wanna not hassle the man?"
“He is fine.  But it is unusual for Hulk to come check on him after an event of this nature,” Jarvis said.  “He's well aware that something may have prompted this change in behavior.”
“Know who isn’t going to be photographed wearing a miniskirt in Vegas when his boyfriend is back in New York?” Tony asked.
Steve caught it one handed, rolling it over to look at the label.  It had a certain overblown charm, someone having a lot of fun with graphic design and what they considered an ‘old timey’ soda bottle should look like.  He smiled.  “Know what I want?” he asked, looking up.  Tony met his eyes, his eyebrows arching in an unspoken question.  Steve smiled.  “Egg cream.”
Tony studied him, as if he doubted that.  “There’s munster.  If you want the swiss, I can have munster-”
He blinked hard, ignoring the spike of pain that came with it.  “Okay,” he said, staring up at the space above them.  A lot of space.  Shattered concrete and twisted metal littered the ground around them, huge chunks of stone and bits of machinery, broken loose in the collapse.  “I think we're in some sort of maintenance tunnel.”  Which was good, whatever had come down on top of them, or with them, the tunnel wasn't likely to give way.  The impact might've opened up a hole, then buried it, or ripped the whole section apart, he didn't know.  But despite the darkness, the empty silence of the space, it seemed stable.
“That would be the cat,” Jarvis explained.  “He is rather particular about his feeding rituals.  Dummy has the instructions.”
“Stop,” Tony agreed.  His fingers flexed, and he folded them together to keep them still.  “And figure out what’s wrong.”  His head tipped to the side, holding DJ’s gaze.  “I’ll ask you questions.”  DJ’s face went tense, and he rushed on.  “Easy questions.  Yes and no questions.  All you have to do is think about what I’m asking, and then nod, or shake your head.”  His eyebrows arched.  “Can you do that for me?”
Tony chuckled, and leaned over to retrieve a bottle for himself.  Steve jerked his gaze back to the bottle before he ended up staring at Tony’s ass.  “Could you be more of a Brooklyn hipster?” Tony asked, his voice muffled by the interior of the fridge.
One page became two, became ten, became twenty.  In the waning, golden light of the afternoon, things took on a magical quality.  Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw the others come and go, Rhodey and Stark grumbling at each other and Peter did all the work on their kite.  Jarvis and May collected the dishes, piling them high in Happy's arms as Clint and Natasha brought out pies and apple dumplings, plates of turkish delight and fudge, and jugs of cider.
Tony felt the bottom drop out from under him, and he ignored it, ignored the way his vision was going white at the edges, ignored the way his chest ached.  “No.  When we came in-”
Steve offered her an arm.  “Let's go make some coffee.  Jarvis'll let us know if they need anything, and I don't know about you, but I could desperately use some caffeine.”
Tony smiled down at him, folding his arms on the railing of the stairs.  "Tolerable," he said.  He looked tired, dark circles under his eyes and lines bracketing his mouth.  But when he smiled, it seemed to fade, his brown eyes warm.  "How was the curb traffic?"
A gentle hand touched his head, and he went still.  “Whatever small part I had in the man you have become,” Jarvis said, soft, so soft, “I am prouder of that, then anything else I have ever done in my life.”
Jan sucked in a breath.  “Right,” she said, and then, again, “Right.”  She reached up, scrubbing delicately at the corners of her eyes with the heel of her hand.  She blinked hard.  “We can handle this.”
She dusted her hands off on her hips, shifting her belt, as Bucky’s head appeared, hanging upside down from the ceiling.  He glared at the back of her head, his eyes narrowed into slits, which was hard to take seriously with his hair hanging on end.  Steve tried his best to turn a burst of laughter into a cough.  Danvers grinned at him.  “You’ll both be on the shift roster by the end of the week,” she said.  “See you tomorrow for training.”
“Ah, the one who brought DJ to us,” Mrs. Parker said, with a bright smile.  She was perhaps younger than her white hair would indicate, but every time she smiled, lines crinkled the corners of her eyes.  “I've heard quite a lot about you.”
Sam shook his head.  “You won’t be.  I just need to check in with the Captain, then we’ll be heading out.”  He held the reins with one hand, his head on a swivel, watching as people moved past them.  “There’s an old cottage just outside the walls of the city, down by the river.  Used to belong to the gatekeeper, back when that was a job that could be done by one man.  The King let the last gatekeeper keep it, after he retired.  He passed away about a year ago, it’s been empty since then.”
There was barely a beat of pause before his phone vibrated again. “Should've started clapping then.”
Stark's pencil stilled against the page.  "There's no fixing it," he said after a moment, going back to his calculations.
It took him a second to connect the dots.  Steve grinned at him, despite the way his body was in chaos.  “Sometimes you've got to double dare me,” he managed, and Tony was laughing, his forehead braced against Steve's chest, and Steve could smell his hair, could feel his breath through the thin fabric of his t-shirt.  His eyes drifted shut, warmth curling through him, part arousal, part affection, all trouble.
The door rattled, and Steve managed to get out of the way before it opened.  Bucky leaned in, his face a thundercloud.  “You-”
“Honestly,” Steve said, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck, “I find not much can shock me any more.”  It was a lie, but one he'd grown comfortable with.  “Still...  Let's not do this right now, okay?”
"Wonderful."  Steve reached out to ruffle his hair and felt the fabric of the jacket pull taut.  He straightened up before he could split a seam. “Ready for dinner?”
“I think I've got it.  Watch out.  Flamethrower,” Tony said, as a man in heavy gear came charging at them.
He looked at Obie.  “I know you loved my father.  Maybe more than I did, because, after all, you knew him better than I did,” he admitted.  “And you’ve always done your best to protect his memory, his legacy.  And I appreciate that, I do.”
Stark's head came up, those remarkable eyes sharp beneath the hard line of his black brows.  "If you're refusing my offer, my very generous offer, might I add, of a room, then what is your plan?"  His eyebrows arched.  "Will you be propping yourself up in my front hall?  Sleeping down at the trolley stop?  Setting up a bivouac on my front lawn?"
DJ considered his hands.  Then he held them up towards Tony.  "So that's what color your skin should be," Tony said.  "I never knew.  What with the paint and the grease and the filth."  Unconcerned, DJ grinned up at him, and Tony smiled back.  "What do you say, bratbot?"
“Yes,” Natasha said.  “And even if they could convince Jarvis to reduce the temperature in the room low enough to make it solidify, it would take forever, because of the heated pool.”
“We got a plan?” Clint asked, taking the platter of scrambled eggs from Darcy.  He sat down, dropping the platter directly on top of the plate and digging in.
Her teeth flashed in a grin.  “Being a man,” she corrected.  “Sometimes.  Some days, I’m happier like this, in a suit, or overalls, or a uniform.  Other days…”  She shrugged.  “I fit a sheath dress and pin curls just as well.”  She reached up, adjusting the brim of her hat.  “So things I should’ve questioned, things I should’ve known were wrong, were dangerous…”
“Gun,” Jarvis said, scrambling across the floor, the coffee pot still held in a death grip.  “Mrs. Parker, the-”
Rogers leaned in.  "I think," he said, and yes, that voice was going to haunt Tony's dreams in the best way possible, "you'll find that I'll dare quite a bit, Mr. Stark."  His eyes narrowed.  "Especially when I'm dealing with a high class fella doing his level best to throw his weight around."
Tony blinked.  “Oh, you want to put your head in my lap?”  He grinned.  “Sure, that's fine, just let me-”  He stroked his thumb over the back of Steve's clinging hand.  “Let me do this okay?”
“At least one of them is actively plotting.  And I must be getting old and soft, because by the time I realized it…”  He shook his head.  “I couldn’t manage to catch that particular tiger by the tail.  When I die, and I will, one way or the other, it’ll be war.”
“I do my utmost, sir,” Jarvis said, already striding away.  Tony made a face at his back.  “Very mature, sir.”
“No.”  Tony’s head came up, and his glasses were crooked on his nose now.  Steve slipped them off of his nose.  Tony arched an eyebrow at him. “Rude.”
Steve brought the kite up, tucking his body behind it, but the dowel hung down low at his side.  "Because he's come a long way, and he's never seen the dragon, has he?  All these things, all these probems, all blamed on the dragon, and he's seen the problems, but never the cause.  Until he does.  He finds the dragon, and it is monstrous and terrible and inhuman.  It's there, right in front of him."
Steve choked on a laugh, but when he looked at Tony, there was a dark gleam in his eye.  “And what if I’m looking for a different sort of payment?” he asked.  The last log hit the pile with a thump, and Tony arched an eyebrow at him.
“I honestly think they’re magically replenishing themselves,” Clint said.  “I’m going to label everything.”
DJ took the screwdriver out of his mouth.  “Didn't trust him,” he said, tapping the tip of the screwdriver against the metal plate.  His head tipped to the side, his eyes falling closed as he repeated the gesture, flicking the screwdriver against the plating, and Tony wondered what he was listening for.  “He was...”  His eyes opened, and he blinked at Tony.  “Made you sad.”
Harris shrugged.  “‘It’s his father’s fault that the the curse got placed and the place got cursed in the first place!’” he sing-songed, his voice light.  DJ blinked at him, confused, and Harris smiled.  “It’s a song about blame, and how sometimes, in the end, placing the blame doesn’t really do anything but make people feel better.  Because if there’s someone to blame, then everyone else can wash their hands of it.  And a lot of the time, there’s blame to go around.
Duck shut the door, his hand braced on the knob. “Ellen, I think you know Captain Steve Rogers. Captain Rogers? Ellen Ning.” He headed to his desk, his tread heavy. “Seems Captain Rogers thought it was the time of you met, Ning.” He dropped into his chair. “And so he came to visit us.”
“But it used to be that we didn't discuss things like this, these kind of-” She winced, her face drawing up in distaste. “Sexual arrangements.”
“Right this way,” Pepper said, gesturing at the grand staircase, and Rogers fell in behind her, as if Tony didn't even exist.
“Where would he go?”  Jarvis' voice made Tony jolt, his heart in his throat.  Surprised, he looked over his shoulder to find Jarvis standing in the doorway, his hands folded behind his back.  Tony hadn't even heard him approach.
“I’ll do my best,” he repeated back at her, just to make her laugh.  Because if she was laughing it couldn’t be that bad.  He held onto that, that warm and easy sound of her laughter.  “Just.”  He stopped.  “I’m fine.”
“If you design it properly,” Okoye mused, a piece of fruit impaled on the tip of her knife, “you could send them flying right past the windows of-”
“And that means that ruining a couple of perfectly good pillows is probably pointless,” Darcy said.  She shifted on the bed next to him, and then the edge of the pillowcase was tugged up.  Harris glared at her, and she let out a noise that sounded suspiciously like a giggle.  “Okay, so there’s two of them, and I know that’s not something that you’re really….  Prepared for, but-”
“It just might have,” Strange agreed.  With a heartfelt sigh, he lowered himself down to sit next to Steve, bracing his elbows on his knees and dropping his head into his hands.  For a long moment, he just sat there, his shoulders rising and falling as he breathed.  When he finally raised his head, he was pale, his dark hair flopping over his forehead more disordered than Steve had ever seen him.  “You realize you may have trapped yourself here, as well, don’t you?”
Rogers reached out, tapping gently on the front of the faceplate with one knuckle.  “Can I see your face?” he asked, and it was so soft, so gentle that Tony barely heard him.
“I can be inappropriately destructive if I want to be,” Jan said, and Steve realized he was laughing.
There was static, a burst, and then another, and when the feed stabilized again, the boy's lips were moving, the words barely audible over the whir of servos, the creak of metal.
Tony looked up as an unfamiliar man came cutting through the crowd.  His suit was well-tailored, his sunglasses polished to a mirror shine, his red hair cut in a crisp, unattractive crew cut.  Tony eyed him for a moment, then pointedly turned back to the schematics scrolling on the monitor in front of him.  “Sorry, I'm in a committed relationship at the moment, if you're looking for a wingman, you'll need to-”
Tony glanced up.  Rogers was still standing in front of the car, his hisp braced against the hood, his head one a perpetual swivel.  There was a painful tension to his shoulders, and Tony considered putting the driver’s seat into full recline.  Staring at the ceiling was probably healthier than watching the muscles of Rogers’ shoulders bunch under the fabric of his t-shirt.
Strange nodded.  “I…  Yes.”  He looked at DJ.  “You know I’ll get you home.”  He took a deep breath.  “I just need to do some research.  Find out why-”  He waved a hand through the portal, and it swirled around his fingers like a deep, dark pool of water.  “Why only you cannot pass.”
The thing that looked like Steve smiled back, just a little, a wry twist to his lips.  “We like to pretend,” he said, and it sounded almost apologetic.  “And I guess you do, too?”
“Needed a workout,” Steve said, his voice tight.  He yanked the hood of his sweatshirt over his head.  “Figured I could have a hard run and then come back and meet up with you.”
Natasha's hand caught his elbow, tugging him to a stop.  “You all right?” she asked, her gaze sharp.  Tony opened his mouth and her fingers tightened.  “Are you all right?” she repeated, and he subsided.
"Doesn't matter," she said.  Her head bounced to the side, her hair swinging in a perfect wave against her cheek.  "The lenses aren't prescription, they just have a little anti-glare tinting on them."
“You tried, Jarvis.”  Steve crouched down next to Tony, one hand coming up to rest lightly on Tony's shoulder.  “Hey.” Tony's arm twitched, and Steve's thumb swept over the fabric of his shirt, rubbing back and forth.  “Tony.  C'mon.  Time for bed.”
“I shall not yield,” Thor said, leaning back in his chair, his arms crossed over his chest.  “A race shall be fair, or be no race at all.”
DJ stood there, studying him, his face tight.  And then he turned, walking down the rest of the row.  Caught off guard again, Harris scrambled to catch up to him.  “Deej?”
Steve moved so fast that he barely had time to register it.  One second, he was halfway across the roof, moving towards Tony with a measured, deliberate pace, and then Tony blinked.  And just like that, Steve was right there, right in front of him, right on top of him, and he jerked backwards, his feet getting tangled up as his brain sent out a desperate, futile order to retreat.
DJ looked up at her.  His big dark eyes blinked slowly, his lashes sweeping down.  “Bye,” he said at last.
Steve braced his arm on his upthrust knee.  “I’ve lived with worse,” he said, and pushed himself upright.
"Still rich and brilliant?" Tony offered, tucking his hands in his pockets.  "Possibly less married.  Or more married.  My stunning good looks have likely intimated most people, so-"
Tony looked out the driver’s side window, but other than a few random passers by, there was nothing to see.  “How did you forgive him?”
“Dude, I've heard a lot about you, and you seem sketchy, honestly.” Eli dug a mug out of the cabinet next to the gleaming, massive fridge.  “'Sides, I don't trust any man around Steve's pastry.”
It was like breathing, it was like his heart beating, it was like taking a step or standing up, it was easy, it was necessary.  It was just embedded in his bones now.
“Right,” Steve said.  He rolled his shoulders, making DJ giggle.  “Sorry, monkey, I’ve got to put you down now.”
“I'll take responsibility with the press,” Steve said, and for an instant, Tony didn't think he was going to move.  And when he did move, it was to come closer, levering himself up so his lips were right there, right next to Tony's, so close that all either of them had to do was move an inch to close the distance.
“Yes,” DJ said, his voice firm, flipping the book open.  With the utmost care, he started turning the pages, studying each one in turn.
“Yeah, but you’re trying, good for you.”  Clint looked back over his shoulder.  “The staff did NOT look happy with us just now.”
Her fingers slipped away, letting the weight of it settle in his hands, and his stomach dropped.  His head snapped up.  “What is this-”
Tony pushed himself upright.  “Probably not going to happen,” he admitted.  Steve looked up at him, and he smiled.  “You going to stop asking me?”
“C'mon, man, wanna put the hardware away?” Clint asked, as Callie shifted against his side.  “She's had a day.  Maybe don't add to that?”
“You have no idea,” Steve said.  He started up the stairs again, his shoulders squared, his jaw at a dangerous angle.
Tony grinned at him, half hidden by the pillow and the sheets, and Steve loved him so much it hurt, so much that it made everything easier.  “That was perilously close to dirty talk, Cap.”
Steve handed over the envelope, and Strange took it, the watch disappearing from his hand.  He slipped the letter into his vest.  “I’ll make sure he gets it immediately,” he said.  “And I’ll be back in the morning, with another update.”
Tony signed.  “Steve?” he asked, grabbing hold of the hem of Steve’s shirt.  He pulled it off, and Steve let him, raising his arms so Tony could wrestle the shirt free.  He tossed it over his shoulder.  “This relationship is hanging by a thread,” he said, bracing his arms on Steve’s shoulders and crossing his wrists behind Steve’s head.  “So it would behoove you to show some appreciation for my ass right now.”
“I shall do my utmost,” she said.  “For the sake of my bonus.” With a quick nod, she slipped out of the library, pulling the door shut behind her.
“Well, I can't promise every night,” Steve said.  “But I get sick of take out.  And I do all right with simple stuff.”  He smiled at Tony, and Tony's stomach turned over.  “You okay with that?”
Everyone stilled.  “I wasn’t aware I had any openings,” Tony said, tossing the filthy rag back in the general direction of the workbench.
“Then what’s his problem?” Tony asked.  He looked at Peter, still immobile on his floor.  “What is your problem, Parker?”
Tony took it from him.  “Especially since her tastes changed with the season,” he said.  “And her mood.”
But the minutes ticked by, and the grounds remained deserted in all directions.  With one last glance over his shoulder, Steve headed across the lawn to the greenhouse.  Even as he reached for the doorknob, he was still waiting for someone to appear to stop him.
“Oh, wait, I think I've got video on my phone,” Jane said, pulling away from her dance partners.  “I can show you!”
“There’s secret paths all over, and handholds, if you look for them.”  Clint subsided back into the shadows, disappearing in an instant.  “Head on in.  The boss is in a mood.”
“Making yours,” DJ said, grinning back.  He had a cocoa mustache, and Tony reached out, swiping at it to make DJ giggle.
“Every woman in this room had Tony in the poll,” Natasha said, and she seemed to relish saying that aloud.
“I think your plan for total isolation may hit a snag,” Pepper said.  “In that you just asked Steve to move in with you.”
Caiera, the last artist of the Galactic Ink Collective, wandered out right behind him.  “My pleasure,” she said.  Her eyes flicked down towards Clint’s ass, and she smiled, one hip cocked.  “Come back anytime.”
“I think you’ve found the one thing in the house that neither of you could damage, even if you tried,” he said.  He braced his arm on the back of DJ’s chair, smiling down at him.  “Are you going to beat him?”  DJ nodded.  “Good. Confidence is good.”
There was a beat of silence.  “No,” DJ said, with a great deal of confidence, and Rhodes had a hand clasped over his mouth, his shoulders shaking with laughter.
The sudden memory of Steve, breathtakingly handsome in a perfectly tailored suit, sprang to mind, and Tony felt his face flush.  Not a date.  Not even close to a date.  And anyways, he suspected that Steve was probably as likely to attract bullets as he was.  “Any news from Happy about-”
Tony snatched his pillow and threw it in Peter’s direction.  It landed on his head.  “What are you doing, Parker?”
“You owe me ten pounds of gourmet Swiss chocolate and a couple of dozen roses,” Pepper said.  “In that I’m going to have to spend our day off tomorrow dealing with complaints from people who didn’t get tables tonight.”
The thing landed on Tony's desk with a thump, making Tony jump.  "Wonderful," he said, trying to figure out where its eyes were.  Or if it had eyes.  "What're the odds that it's infecting my office with fleas right this moment?"
“It's Christmas morning,” Steve said.  He turned the tablet around so Tony could see it.  “Look what Santa brought me.  It's our Christmas card for next year.”
Tony tried his best to stare him down.  He was not successful.  Heaving a sigh, he waved a languid hand at the room.  “Fine.  Truth.  Honesty.  All that jazz.”
