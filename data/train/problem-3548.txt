The thing was, Castiel had never actually seen Dean on a date with a single girl, ever. Not since the first day he’d come to Cas’s school.
“I love you, Cas. Always have. Always will. And Sam was right. I don’t think I can do this whole life thing without you. So what I need for you to do, if you can hear me, is I need you to wake the fuck up, all right?” His voice was thick with the still unshed tears. “They—the doctors and nurses—don’t know why you haven’t died. Or why you haven’t woken up, for that matter. But they told me this morning that there’s maybe a chance you’re still in there. You aren’t brain dead, so maybe you’ve been in there this whole time. I’m sorry if I haven’t been as... affectionate as I should’ve. I’ve tried.”
to something closer to resignation. He went from looking like he was gonna smite the population of the bar—which was pretty sparse, considering the weather—to looking like he needed a hug and maybe a kitten to pet.
"You're wearing too many clothes and I can't wish them away with my 'mojo' as you called it. Take them off."
Obviously, potentially having sex was one of the reasons too, but that was almost as scary as it was exciting, if he was honest about it. He’d never gotten farther with a guy than a few hurried handjobs and a couple of sloppy blowjobs. And while he wanted more—desperately—he was also afraid of screwing it up if he topped or getting hurt if he bottomed.
Dean almost didn’t hear it when Cas said, “I like these,” in a soft voice. He looked sad and Dean didn’t know what, but he forced himself to look at the coasters first.
Dean was doing his best imitation of a throw pillow when his phone buzzed. He figured it was Sam and almost ignored it, but he was feeling too bummed out to ignore human contact of any kinda right then. The television show wasn't holding his interest, so maybe a conversation would.
Castiel smiled back and gestured at the table as he stepped back. They moved to sit and Dean smiled even wider when he saw the generous slice of pie Castiel had cut for him. He took a large bite and smiled around it, making appreciative noises as he ate it. When he tried the cheese, his eyes went wide and Castiel worried for a moment that he did not like it.
Dean had changed shirts five times. He'd easily chosen the jeans to wear. He knew without a doubt which ones showed off his ass and package the best and were still nice enough for a decent restaurant. But shirts were another beast. Finally, he chose a thin sweater he'd never worn before, a gift from Sam from the previous Christmas. It was cashmere and looked almost as soft as it felt. He wanted to invite touch, right?
“More often than not, though, the monster hadn’t done anything. My dad would always say ‘Yet, son. They haven’t don’t anything
“I—sorry... sir.” Cas swallowed with enough force that Dean could hear it, kicking off his shoes and hurrying to rectify his mistake.
Oh so much plot in this one. Very little smut. A little of what some of you have asked for. A little something I put in as a response to someone yelling at me on another fic. A dash of humor, a touch of angst, eh voila!
So Dean had been secretly saving up so they could move into a place that they both picked. He'd done the math last night and he had enough. He was gonna tell Cas and he couldn't wait to see the look on his face.
“Cas, that’s...  thanks, man. Sam likes them, too. And you. A lot. Me, um...  me, too. I like them and, uh, and you.” He stood up from his chair and moved toward Castiel.
"Bastard," he said, shoving the paper away only to snatch it right back when he realized he hadn't found the— "
When Sam left, Dean was always sad. It wasn’t as bad as the first time, but it still made him vulnerable. And that’s how, when they were back in the dorm, having their standard evening snack together, Dean found himself standing too close to Cas when they stood up. He’d noticed some chocolate on Cas’ chin and had unthinkingly reached out to smudge it off with his thumb.
“Dean, I think... perhaps we should go to lunch before we try to work on this project.” At Dean’s confused look, Cas held up a hand. “I know you and I got off on the wrong foot. A couple of times. And I really think it would be best to start over and clear the air before we try to work together. Does that sound acceptable?” When Dean continued to sit there in stunned silence, Cas added, “We can tell Adler it was a working lunch, that we were ‘forming an action plan’ or similar nonsense.”
Dean nodded. “Saves lots of people from having to cook and everything, too. Do we have to pay for meals?”
Dean’s breath caught in his throat. Cas did it again. The third time, Dean rolled up to meet him, green eyes locked with Cas’ blue ones. He knew right away that it wasn’t going to take long, if Cas allowed them to keep going. Since Cas seemed to be in a receptive mood, Dean thought he may as well ask for a little more.
Dean pressed the magic button in the middle of Cas’s sentence, and his words turned into hoarse cry. Cas was really writhing around now. His skin was flushed and starting to bead with sweat. He looked even more gorgeous than he normally did. Maybe not quite as hot as when he was bossing Dean around, but it was close.
Dean suddenly felt tired of fighting everything he felt for this adorable idiot in front of him. His skin felt like a sheet of ice stretched over heated coils, but he decided to go for a little bit of honesty.
“Your arousal was very... stimulating. I couldn’t help myself, once I realized you were about to have an orgasm.”
As aroused as he was, Cas still couldn’t help the shocked laugh. Dean lifted his head and smiled, staring into Cas’s eyes, obviously pleased he’d amused Cas.
Finally, he hired a motorcycle and made way up the long road to the castle, thankful that he’d convinced Castiel to get running water and electricity a few years ago, so at least he could have a hot bath. One day perhaps the drive would be passable by car, but that would take more resources than Cas was likely to want to devote to modernization. Balthazar would be lucky to convince him to get a phone or internet.
“Dean, if you want to leave your shirt on, I won’t force you to take it off, but I wish you would reconsider. I would very much like to touch every part of you and there is so much I can’t do if there is clothing between us.”
“It’s a big day. I didn’t want you to be hungry,” Castiel told him softly, staring at his plate. He stopped to ask the blessing before picking up his fork.
“Um, so I was thinking maybe we should tell them all the truth. You know, about you. If you’re cool with it, obviously, but—”
“You... don’t care? If I told anyone else in the village, I would be judged harshly. Probably shunned, if they -” He stopped mid-sentence again.
Well. Maybe not that last one. He was pretty sure he was going to make it all right this time. Somewhere along the line, he’d stopped being angry. That was making all the difference. He no longer felt that burning need to lash out. He just wanted things to go well now. He wanted to do the best he could, make everyone—Sam, Cas, Bobby—proud of him.
They hadn’t done more than kiss since the day they’d gotten the tv, at Cas’ request. He had been too overwhelmed by what he felt during and after.
, the show was over and Dean held out a hand to Blue Eyes as the band walked off the stage for the final time.
“Uh, okay, I guess.” He backed away from the door and then closed it after Cas walked through. “What kind of bill? Something to do with the apartments? Man, don’t tell me they’re raising the rent.”
“Ugh, I’m gonna go to my room and read up on legal emancipation,” Sam said in a huff, flouncing out of the room with his hair streaming behind him.
"Tell me something, Cassie. If all the hormones were gone, how would you feel about Dean? Is he some ugly jerk? Because, I gotta say, having seen the guy and spoken to him during a pretty bad moment, pretty sure neither of those is remotely the case."
His voice was still deep, but also breathless, almost as if he were as scared as Dean—or possibly as turned on, though Dean was afraid to hope until that rumbling voice came again.
Dean’s eyes were suspiciously red, but he nodded. “Yeah. Okay. I get it. It’s hard not hating myself for kicking you out, though, man.”
“If you truly don’t mind, that would be very helpful. Just until tomorrow. The super is going to move me into one of the vacant apartments then.”
“We were not dating when I met all of you previously,” Cas said when Dean couldn’t continue. “The truth is, I put out an ad offering services and Dean responded and—” He locked eyes with Dean, mouth turning up just slightly at the corners. “—then we kind of fell for each other in the process.”
Cas leaned back and tugged Dean the rest of the way through the window. They landed with Dean sprawled on top of Cas, crotches perfectly aligned. Dean raised an eyebrow.
He put out the pot and hid it, then turned on the fan he kept for the purpose of removing smoke quickly. Then he took a deep breath and stepped through into the front part of the old house he worked and slept out of. Standing just inside the door are two very attractive men in suits.
It wasn’t that what he felt was purely physical—quite the opposite, despite Dean’s incomparable beauty—but now that he’d allowed himself to accept that they could have something, he wanted to show his affection in every way possible. Always assuming, of course, that Dean felt anything in return. Cas had no idea, but tonight it had seemed as if Dean might share his feelings.
Sam nodded, then smirked. “Plus at your apartment I can watch R rated movies without mom and dad finding out,” he teased, probably at least half-serious.
“This will close D’s third eye and force him to look inward. Think of this like a “reboot” of D’s chakra, flushing out all the unneeded processes and starting fresh.”
Cas saw relief on Dean’s face as he stood. He awkwardly pulled Dean in for a hug and was surprised how forcefully Dean hugged back. He tried to mimic Dean for force and duration, so the hug lasted what felt like a long time to Cas. When Dean pulled away, he made sure to keep his face well back from Cas’ own.
Dean huffed out a sigh, seeing no reason not to be honest. “No, not really. When I left before, it wasn’t pretty.” He scrubbed the back of his neck with his hand. “And I know I screw up a lot, but it wasn’t all my fault, what happened. They screwed up too, that time.”
Despite it being a thirty minute drive, Dean felt like he arrived at Cas’s almost instantly. It was way too soon. TO give up Truffles. To see Cas. For Sam to be grown up enough to live with his girlfriend. Everything would stop sucking eventually, right? Right?
Dean wasn’t sure Cas even realized he had spoken. His eyes were closed and his mouth was open and he looked like some pictures Dean had seen once of people blissed out on heroin. Ecstasy—the real kind, not the drug—had clearly taken hold.
“Oh. Wow, okay.” He chuckled lightly. “Man, Castiel, you have really changed since I saw you last, haven’t you?”
This was a great plan until there was a soft knock at the door and Cas called his name through it in that deep gravelly voice of his. Dean’s orgasm punched out of him and he had to ride it out before he could answer. Cas called his name again before he was done.
“I’m all the way at the back corner, but you’ll see why I chose it,” Cas said, taking Dean’s hand and grinning happily.
He hadn’t planned beyond kissing, but his body longed for more. He would not ask for more or try for more, but part of him hoped Dean would try to take it further between them. Dean did not and that was probably for the best. It made Dean rise even higher in Castiel’s esteem, of course. He would not do anything he thought Cas was unready for.
Deanna gently extricated her hand so that she could start the car. Her clit was throbbing and she was pretty sure her pussy was both drenched and on fire. There was an ache deep in her belly and between her legs. She glanced at Cass’s beautiful mouth again and couldn’t wait to feel that gorgeous tongue and those plush lips against her engorged sex. As they waited for traffic to clear so they could merge onto the road, Deanna let her gaze roam over Cass’s lovely breasts, dreaming of what they would feel like beneath her hands.
That was apparently just what Cas needed to find his own orgasm and his come mixed with Dean’s between their chests and on Dean’s hand. When it was over, he collapsed forward, uncaring of the mess they made as their chests pressed together wetly.
“Come on, brother, don’t pretend you don’t think it’s awesome as all hell!” Benny said, slapping him on the back.
I've written and rewritten these notes 4 times. I haven't gotten back to people on my other fic because I was insulted for Christmas via comment and it upset me a lot. I could say more (and I have, and deleted it), but I don't think I will. If you don't like my story or my characterizations, please allow me to direct your attention to the top right and the big X. Click that and do not bother with my comment box in future. That is all.
Deanna was a little worried about what had Cass so nervous, but whatever it was, they’d deal with it together. Unless of course Cass had done something shitty, in which case, that would suck. Didn’t really seem like Cass’s style, though. Deanna considered herself a pretty good judge of character.
“Yeah, because you did so well walking those first ten feet, two miles would be no big, right?” Dean said, voice dripping with sarcasm as he pulled through the intersection.
He was broken out of his reverie when Dean came out of the bathroom. The white shirt and dark pants were very different from the clothes Dean had been wearing. Dean looked strange in them and yet Castiel thought he liked the way Dean looked wearing the clothes of his people. He shook off the thoughts and smiled tentatively at Dean.
Slipping down so that her belly rested between Cass’s thighs, she reached out with her hands and took hold of Cass’s breasts. She cupped them and massaged them lightly, barely brushing over the nipples with the palms of her hands. Cass arched up into her, moaning. Deanna alternated between the massage and the nipple play until Cass was panting and Deanna could feel moisture against her stomach.
He kissed away Cas’s frown. Then Dean kept kissing Cas until he himself was able to forget that Cas was leaving in two more days. Dean wasn’t ready. And he didn’t know what to do. He wasn’t even sure what he was feeling yet. He just knew that Cas filled a hole in his life he hadn’t even known was there. But once Cas was gone, Dean understood that he would feel the emptiness of that hole then.
kind and funny and amazing and all those things they said." Cas was staring at the dirt he was scuffing with his boots, rather than at Dean.
It wasn’t all Cas wanted, but he knew that they didn’t need to take their time right now. This wasn’t going to be the last time. They could rush now and take it slow later. A hunter’s life was uncertain, but he was sure of that much. They’d have tonight, at least. Maybe even the next day, if Dean was willing to delay returning to the bunker.
Later, Cas had explained, "When people see our cars in the driveway, I want them to have to guess which of us is compensating for a tiny penis."
A polite smile immediately turned into a fierce scowl. A deep furrow appeared between the brows about those blue orbs Dean had once known well. Still, Dean put on a brave face.
“‘s a really good book, Sam. Cas let me read it. You’re gonna love it. I gotta do the milking and then I’m gonna make supper, I think. Unless you two wanna go down to the kitchens?” he asked.
“Dean, I know he’s been gone a long time, but I’m sure he’s got a good reason. He’s coming back, man. It’s Cas. He wouldn’t lie about that,” Sam said with conviction.
“Don’t, Sam. Please just don’t. The doctor told me I shouldn’t get my hopes up and I’m not going to. I fucking
He reached out and squeezed Dean’s hand where it was white-knuckling the steering wheel. “That doesn’t mean you aren’t still the reason I want to stay. Just that you’re no longer the only reason.”
Castiel grimaced. “No. She felt sorry for me and gave me her ticket.” He ran a hand through his hair.
Dean got back into the wagon in somewhat of a daze, not sure how to deal with the shock of what he’d just been offered. He had never expected that. They had tried him living there for a short time, but he’d overheard them saying he was too much of a strain financially—as well as complaining about his behavior and negative influence on Sam—so he’d skipped out before he got kicked out. Sam had not been happy at all.
Mortie lifted Cas’s right hand by the wrist, and Dean was starting to get a little annoyed, watching this guy put his mitts all over Dean’s angel. Not that he was
"I'm not doing that, so don't even ask," Gabriel said as he finally let go of his brother. "But you're welcome to come stay with me whenever you want to. Heck, you can come live with me, if you need to."
“Did you believe you were going to be sent back into foster care?” Cas asked slowly. “The same foster system that led to him being beaten?”
“Okay... I just... it doesn’t seem like something Cas would do. Send an unsolicited dick video. I mean, he’s kind of unclear on boundaries, but I know I’ve heard him talk about how consent is important.”
“Come on, guys, hurry up!” Charlie yelled as she ran through the kitchen on her way to the back yard.
Before he could think better of it or stop himself, Dean said, “Yeah? Well, next time you’re wearing a pair let me know and we’ll put it to the test again.”
Dean stared out at the sea of faces, easily finding Lisa, who was laughing at someone’s joke. He knew he should be looking at her with love in his heart, happy to see her so happy. Instead, he was struck by how rarely he had ever seen her laugh when they were alone. He couldn’t remember the last time he made her laugh for real and that more than anything drove the point home. They weren’t in love.
He couldn’t help it, though. He began to let himself hope for the time away from the village. He had previously feared it, but now…now he longed for the freedom it represented, no matter how fleeting. He wasn’t sure it would be fair to Dean, but he would ask him, once they were gone from here. Cas would explain it all to him and let Dean decide what he wanted.
Being this close to Cas was driving him insane. He’d never wanted another human being this much in his life. He didn’t generally work this hard for sex, or willingly do as he was told. Cas, though... Cas made him want to kneel and heel. “I want-I want you to fuck me.
He seemed unaware of what he’d said, continuing to kiss his way down Cas’s torso toward his crotch. Cas on the other hand, suddenly had a pounding heart. Sometimes it really seemed like Dean did want him to stay, as much as Cas wanted to stay himself. Cas wanted to still Dean’s head and ask him directly, admit how he himself felt and ask Dean’s feelings on the matter. But, though he’d overcome so many fears on this trip, in this he was still petrified.
Castiel smiled at him. “I am not in school anymore, no. What you read was correct, at least in our community. We believe that we continue to learn everyday of our lives, so we stop going to actual school when we complete the 8th grade.”
“So no one will be able to see what we get up to in here, huh?” Dean asked, stepping close to Cas again and coming in for a kiss.
Cas asked it so sincerely that all Dean’s anger deflated. “Yeah.” He said it softly, and only meant to say it to Cas.
“Castiel,” said a small blonde one who was near to them in line. “Are you looking forward to the beginning of your time in the city? I cannot wait until it is my turn.”
“What? No, Dean. Okay, so he’s been gone a while, but he probably had a lot of things to do there, right? A lot of people to talk to?” Sam theorized.
“All right. Same again?” Dean grabbed the glass and started walking sideways as he waited for a response.
“I’ll let him know, Bobby. Thanks. But, uh, I don’t think he’s gonna change his mind. Being Amish…it’s all he knows,” Dean said, hating every word that came out of his mouth, but knowing the truth of them.
“Well, it seems brash on the surface—naked woman, cowboy hat? But when you look, you realize the way you had her drawn, so that nothing is really exposed, the way she almost seems to have wings... well, considering what it is, it’s actually tasteful and respectful and shows a great deal of care for the person, in my estimation.”
Dean wasn’t looking forward to this get together. Charlie had been going on and on about him meeting her new girlfriend for weeks, though, so he’d had to agree. He had tried to get out of it by telling her it was a terrible idea for redheads to date each other, but she didn’t take the bait. He mostly only cared because he wanted company for his loneliness. As long as Charlie wasn’t getting serious, that meant he didn’t have to either. Now that she seemed to be settling down, it wasn’t going to be long before people shined a spot light on his love life and asked when he was going to find someone for himself.
“Well, you just looked so down, I thought it might cheer you up if I gave you my cherry,” Dean replied, winking and grinning.
Chuck was reasonably sure he’d heard a catch in Dean’s voice, a slight hesitation when he’d referred to Cas as his friend. Interesting. Now Chuck started typing for real, trying to document the mini-drama unfolding before him.
Dean confessed, “I wasn’t really sure you meant it, you know? I thought maybe you’d back out. I mean, I hoped not, but I didn’t know.”
Castiel smiled sheepishly, relieved. “Yes, of course, Dean. That seems the best solution.” They started walking again.
He wondered for a second whether he’d be able to settle down with a man any more easily than with a woman. He allowed himself to picture it for a moment, then shook his head. Regardless of gender or genitalia, the problem was the same. Dragging some poor soul down into their stupid, awful life. Wasn’t happening.
Pride swelled in his chest as Dean watched them walk to the next table. He saw Ed gesturing out of the corner of his eye and looked over in time to catch him giving them both a double thumbs-up. Dean grinned and gave him a pistol-wink in return.
“Go talk to Daphne, Cas. Come back when you’re done.” His voice was rough with want still, but he didn’t care. If Cas was going to be his at last, there wasn’t much that could faze him.
Cas was leaning forward now, as if he might jump down. “And?” he prompted. Then he licked his lips. “Do... do you love me as something else too?”
Dean took a deep breath. This wasn’t how he’d intended to start this conversation, but what the hell?
When Sam was done making appreciative noises and thanking him profusely, he threw his arms around Castiel’s neck and hugged him. Cas was surprised, but he closed his eyes and hugged back just as fiercely. He cared about Sam, and he would miss him. He opened his eyes to see that Dean was nearing the porch.
Dean’s hands slid out of Castiel’s shirt, leaving him cold, but Cas didn’t stop him. Only a few minutes later, Dean called a halt to everything and gently pressed Cas off of his lap. Castiel was reluctant to go, but he could tell that Dean was struggling to hold back his roaming hands and rolling hips at that point. Castiel was struggling himself.
Cas pulled his own phone from his pocket and looked, then held it out to Dean. His phone showed that he had sent the message to Dean about running an errand. Cas put his phone away, frown still firmly in place.
“I kinda thought you guys couldn’t really afford me?” he asked awkwardly, not really sure how to be tactful about it. There were other questions, but he figured that was the easiest to talk about.
“Um, I... yeah, I can, um, yeah, okay. I, um, gotta, class, you know?” Dean said. Then he practically ran for Charlie, without once looking back.
Dean smiled. “Good, Cas. You know, except for the whole no music thing, I kinda like it here so far. You’re different from anybody I know, but it’s a good different.”
When he was done cleaning up, he slipped on the fresh T-shirt and took the old one with him to carry down tot he laundry room. Ever since the candy apple incident, his mother had made Sam and Dean swear to always bring stained and especially sticky clothing down to the laundry room for pre-treatment. Who knew red food dye could cause such chaos?
“Thank you, Dean.” The very last thing that Castiel needed was to walk in on Dean half naked again, so he appreciated the gesture.
“It’s just down this way,” Cas told him, voice rumbling even deeper than before. They made quick work of the remaining few yards and then Cas was letting them inside the room.
Of course, Dean supposed that was a smart way to be and it had certainly served the Winchesters well—it didn’t make Cas any less adorable when he did it.
“Oh, right, sorry. The second reason is because he already knows you aren’t as straight as you’d like to be. He’s seen you checking out more than one male ass. He wishes you’d just tell him, but he’s scared to ask because he doesn’t want to force-out you.”
Dean waged an internal debate. He could do that, right? Let Cas massage him? It wouldn’t be a big deal, would it? Nah, it didn’t have to be. There were probably straight friends who massaged each other... right?
When the soft “Mmm” sound escaped him, he was too into the moment to even be embarrassed or worried that Dean would catch on. Dean, however, definitely noticed because he squeezed Cas even tighter, hands roaming up Cas’s back and into his hair. The kiss deepened then, becoming something more than just pretend practice for both of them. Dean couldn’t seem to keep his hands still, but Cas wasn’t complaining—not that he had any right, given the mobility and exploration of his own hands.
They were lying on the bed, sunlight streaming across their naked skin. Dean had been tracing his finger all over Cas’s skin, paying no particular attention to the scars. He paused, hand hovering for a moment before resuming it’s trajectory.
"How is it for you?" Sam groaned. "Ugh, is this where you say something cheesy about how 'Dean's happiness brings me happiness?' Because I
Jacob sat back down at the table and brushed his hands over the wood, as if seeking comfort. “When I told the boy what had happened, he was kind to me. He’d found a way to forgive me and he asked me to come and visit him. It rekindled our feelings—though in truth my own had never really dimmed. He and I kept a relationship for a while, but I still refused to leave and, in time, the distance proved too much.”
“Oh, yeah, sure, no problem, makes total sense. I was just being polite, you know, since we haven’t, um, but I gotta go, like I said, so—”
Dean would never in a million years admit it to Sammy, but a small, unkind part of him hoped for the worst because it meant Sam could stay with him permanently again. After he had the brief aberrant thought, he swam in guilt for the 10 additional minutes it took for Sam’s “parents” to finally show up. They arrived full of apologies and tales of a flat tire and a misplaced jack handle.
“Ah, ah, ah, Cas. You haven’t proven to me how much you want it,” Dean said, voice smug and authoritative.
He wasn’t exactly prepared for the full body scan Cas gave him with his laser blue gaze. He couldn’t even think straight enough to bring up thoughts of Sam again. All he could do was stand there as Cas’s gaze swept over him and Little Dean betrayed him by standing up like a puppy begging for a treat.
By the time Lisa got home the mess had been cleaned up, but Dean had not ended his kale-destruction with a single squashed bunch. He’d made his way through seven of the ten bunches. When he’d surveyed the damage, and realized he had to hide all the evidence—lest Lisa ask why—he’d never been more grateful for his garbage disposal.
Dean grinned as they handed their cards over. “You can just call me D. Everyone does, don’t they, honeypot?” He turned to Cas again, as always enjoying the look of utter bemusement that crossed his face.
He reflected that he would need the practice. Once his rumspringa was over, he’d do nothing but wait when it came to Dean. If Dean even wanted to continue to visit him or have Castiel visit, that was. Cas did not want to think about the time when Dean was no longer in his life everyday. It was a pain that did not bear thinking about. It was inevitable, so there was no use borrowing pain from the future.
. And at least moderately decent books, if I do say so myself. For less than the price of Venti Mocha Frappuccino with a double shot from Starbucks! (And one is actually free if you have KindleUnlimited)
“They were once. They were killed out with the great flood. I believe humans wrote a song about it.”
He wanted to lie there and bask in the afterglow of an amazing night, but thinking about bed times tripped the booby-trap wire in his head connected to worries about needing to find a job so he could help his mom out with the rent. That would mean getting up at the asscrack of dawn every morning, most likely. His mom had said Bobby might have something, but he wasn’t keen on taking charity. In any case, Rufus was a mean old cuss and he’d be Dean’s immediate boss, so that was a consideration too.
Dean beamed at her, green eyes crinkling at the corners. “Not as pretty as you, beautiful! Did you pretend to be sick just to get me and Castiel here to come and wait on you?” he asked, sitting on the edge of her bed. “I bet you did, you little princess.”
Still, Dean coaxed him on, making suggestions on speed and roughness that Cas sometimes took and sometimes chose to ignore. Within a few minutes, Dean was an incoherent, needy mess again. Dean was surprised at himself. He loved sex, but he never begged for it like this. He was certainly begging now. And whining. And generally feeling like a needy slut who couldn’t get enough.
“If you both place your hands on the box while I recite the incantation, that should be enough. Assuming there’s not another malfunction with my grace.” Cas looked only at Sam while he talked, refusing to look at Dean for even a second.
Four chapters and an hour and a half later, he grudgingly admitted there was not. The book held no value for him whatsoever. Someone out in the English world
When it was all over, the kiss was nearly forgotten in the aftermath of the night. But watching Nora talk to Cas on the porch gave Dean a pain in his stomach he couldn't ignore.
“Well, you got ‘em here! C’mon!” Sammy said, grabbing Castiel by the hand and dragging him toward the door.
“I know where you are, Dean. They treatin’ you okay down in Minnoniteville?” Bobby asked, sounding concerned.
He sighed and Cas could feel Dean’s heart rate pick up under the palm he had pressed to Dean’s chest.
Cas just smiled his enigmatic little half smile and said nothing. Dean could have kissed him for making him feel better. But of course he didn’t. Things had been less tense between them, though, since Cas had agreed to move in with him for rumspringa. Dean thought Cas himself seemed more relaxed, maybe even happier.
When Castiel turned to see if Dean was ready to move the mattress, he found the older Winchester leaning against the wall just inside the hallway, watching them. Cas saw gratitude on his face along with something else Castiel could not identify. He shrugged it off and offered his help with the mattress.
Dean was crying now and Castiel wanted to console him, but he was also hyper aware of Pamela’s presence. He forced his gaze away from Dean, though it literally hurt him to do so.
Cas nearly dropped the phone in his shock. Looking back the clues were there, but he'd been looking at everything through a completely different lens.
that Jones was holding, then turned to Cas with all the tongue-paralyzing power a pair of bright green eyes could possibly hold. “Right?”
“Seriously, Sam? You wanna bring some woman into this life? Because I sure don’t. Find out I have a soul mate only to see her destroyed the next time we break the world? No thanks.”
He’d only gotten to cosplay once before, when they were LARPing – although, he supposed he and Sam technically cosplayed all the time, as FBI agents and various other agents, but it was hardly the same.
I still haven't gone through and divided up the chapters, so I don't know exactly what is left, but we've got just over a third of the story left, about 37k of the original 90k.
He also needed a shave, he thought. His facial hair didn’t grow very fast, but he hadn’t shaved in over a week and he finally had a little stubble coming in. He grabbed his razor and shaving cream, too. Running a hand through his hair he wondered how to get a barber in this place. He’d have to ask Cas that, too.
Most of all I love this show and fandom and cast because they brought me to you people! And I love you people. I can't remember if I mentioned that you frequent flyers in my comments section should check the dedication of my book, which comes out for
“You have no idea. I thought you were straight, remember? I thought you’d be angry, or at least so uncomfortable you’d never be able to look at me again. I couldn’t bear that idea. That’s why I came over.”
“Isn’t that what you’re doing now?” Cas asked with a smile. “I will enjoy your visits as much in the city as here, Sam. Perhaps more,” he mused quietly.
Cas smiled slowly. “Hm, I think I might need several more kisses before I make any firm decisions on that.”
The next thing he knew, he had a lap full of Cas and a mouth full of tongue that wasn’t his. He couldn’t say he minded it. He wasn’t exactly able to hump Cas’s leg from this position, but Cas seemed to be finding ways to bring friction to his aching erection anyway.
“All right, well, I don’t know where we’re going, but if you change your mind, you can text me and I’ll tell you where we are.” He grabbed up his keys and wallet and headed for the door. “Don’t wait up!” he called over his shoulder.
The guy huffed an annoyed laugh, and shoved him away as he righted himself. “Thanks for saving me from cracking my head on the concrete.”
It had been a really good day already. Dean had taken Sam and Cas out to a small carnival he'd happened to see on the outskirts of town. They'd just run into Eileen, so Cas showed Sam a few quick ASL phrases and gave him some cash to try and win his crush a prize. After watching all this, Dean grinned at Cas and pulled him close in a one armed hug.
Cas, as Dean had known since they’d first met nearly two years ago, was not the most socially adroit person on the planet. He wasn’t the least either, but he was definitely a lot closer to that end of the list. What Dean never expected was for Cas to try making new friends via Craigslist.
When Dean got into the dorm, Sam and Cas were sitting on the couch together, talking excitedly about the pirate book Cas had just given Sam. Cas’ blue eyes were lit up and Sam’s were equally bright. Dean knew in that instant that Cas had become family. He was someone Dean cared about and wanted to protect. He wasn’t as close to him as Sammy, but he was probably a close second.
Cas knew what Dean had planned to do, if Cas hadn’t woken up, and he’d made Dean promise he’d never consider that route again. In exchange, Dean had made Cas agree to go to his lawyer’s office and have the NEM revoked, so that, in the unlikely even that this ever came up again, Dean would get to decide when it was time to let go.
Dean couldn’t stop himself from laughing. “What girls? Dude, the gaggle of gawking ladies who were hanging on your every word and motion from the time you got into line for supper. Those girls.”
“Go ahead and clock out, Castiel. I can take care of things until Maggie and Derek arrive,” Gavin said. “It will give you two plenty of time to get ready.”
It was beyond obvious to Dean that Cas had tried to “fix” his hair, and make it lie flat. Dean allowed himself a brief glimmer of hope that Cas had done it for him. Then realization dawned and he felt a little sick, more than in the mood for a shot or six.
Fuck that was hot. How did this guy keep getting hotter? How was that fair? Dean somehow found his voice. “Let me get up onto the bed,” he rasped.
“Is still going to be part of your life, so long as you both want him to be. I don’t want that to change. You and that kid love each other too much to separate you over something as stupid as a break up.” She sighed again. “Tell you what. Let’s wait until after the camping trip to tell Ben, huh? Give him a nice weekend first?”
“Dean. You didn’t make me homeless. That happened when I trusted Metatron and lost my grace. When Gadreel made you kick me out of here, that wasn’t your fault either. You did what you had to do to save your brother, as you have always done. I do not blame you for anything. Becoming Steve, the Gas-n-Sip clerk, is a memory that I treasure. I did honorable work. I could help people in little ways that sometimes make all the difference. I don’t regret any of those times. Being homeless taught me a lot about myself. It also,” he said, grabbing Dean by the arm and turning him around. “Taught me to appreciate my friends and the things they do to show me that they care. Like making breakfast when I could have made do with the cereal I know they have in abundance.”
"Yeah. Like you too," Dean told him, kissing his damp forehead. He'd be a mess when he woke up, but that's what showers were for. "Like you too," he repeated, then let sleep overtake him.
“They’re in the cafeteria, I think. Said they’d be back—” He checked his watch. “—in about twenty more minutes.” He let go of Cas and stood, stretching out his back until it cracked in several places.
Cas continued to frown in confusion for another few seconds before the truth finally dawned on him and he gaped.
curious as to how you got started, though.” Cas casually ate his burger, doing his best to convey that nothing hinged upon Dean’s answers.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, just sort of looking at each other. With anyone else, Dean probably would have thought it was weird, but with Cas, it just sort of seemed okay. It was almost like they were talking with their eyes. Dean’s stomach felt kinda funny when Cas looked at him, but not in a bad way.
“Yeah? Sweet.” Dean waited until she reached him and poured on the praise. “This was amazing, ma’am. Seriously. I’ve never eaten this good in my life. And thanks for the pie and the sandwich today too. It was all really good.” He blushed a little, but he held the smile on his face.
“She and her husband will arrive at the front gate tomorrow at 6pm with Sam. I will meet you at the dormitory at 15 minutes of and then we will go get him and bring him back here for supper.” He clapped Dean on the shoulder.
Dean’s smile was hopeful. “Everyone broke up with me because they could tell I was in love with you.”
He flipped over there only a few minutes into the show. He listened to stories not so very different from what Cas had gone through. Then came the horror stories of families finding out and shunning then. By the time it was over he had tears drying on his cheeks and he knew exactly why Cas had reacted the way he had the day before.
Mary opened the door and Ellen walked in, followed by a solemn-looking boy with unruly dark hair and large blue eyes that took in everything with an air of distrust. The too-blue gaze finally latched onto Dean and seemed unwilling to let go. Dean gave him a crooked smile, which the boy hesitated but finally returned.
“A little? I felt like he could’ve taken us, kept us out of the system.” Dean shook his head. “If I’d called him and told him what happened, told him where we were, I know now that he woulda taken us in. He wouldn’t have let us go back into care. Then, though, I was just running on fear and anger and a lot of other negative shit.” Dean was so lost in his story, he didn’t even realize he had sworn.
Castiel was not experienced enough in the world to know if Dean had the same interest toward Castiel, but knowing that it was even a
Cas responded by kissing him again. Now that they were naked and Cas was on top of him, their cocks were perfectly aligned for some decent frotting and they rutted against each other with mounting fervor. When Cas pulled back this time, he looked down toward their crotches, then back up at Dean.
buy my brother booze,” came an indignant voice from the back seat, muffled though it was from inside the book Sam held in front of his face so he didn’t have to look at them.
When the table was complete, Castiel felt an emotion to which he was unaccustomed. He felt a sense of pride in his work. He’d been taught that pride was a sin, but he was conflicted suddenly. Now that he’d started to question a few of the things he’d been taught – like whether or not it was wrong to lie with another man – he was questioning a lot of what he had been told.
Dean nodded again, more easily this time. “Yeah. Maybe you’re right. It’s what I thought at the time, anyway. I got busted a few more times, but Sam didn’t try to call Bobby until I got busted in the dead of winter. He couldn’t take care of himself in the cold like that and so he called Bobby again.”
, Dean! Then someone asked why I wasn’t in my bee keeper outfit because wasn’t I supposed to... well, they made references to collecting honey that were
Dean whipped around and saw Ed, hiding behind a plant like an idiot and motioning them forward. Dean was sure all Ed’s furtive looks around were really effective. He was afraid if he rolled his eyes the way he wanted, he’d do it too hard and they might fall out of his head.
“Dean, there is no need. Haven’t you just told me anyway?” Cas ended the sentence with a gentle peck to Dean’s lips. “Just being able to be with you is enough.”
The JoP did not look pleased, but he was being paid and he was still in the time frame he’d been booked for, so he couldn’t exactly complain. He cleared his throat loudly and started to read silently.
His words were lost in the press of Cas’s lips against his own. This time, there was no “allowing” himself to do anything. His body instinctively crushed Cas closer and kissed him harder. His lips were firmer than Dean had ever expected, but still plush and soft and awesome. When he felt Cas’s tongue—
Cas walked to a log and sat down heavily. “I’m getting rescued,” he said in a small wondering voice. “I can’t believe it.”
The seventh day was different. For one thing, Dr. Barnes was waiting in the room when Dean arrived at six in the morning. That in itself was highly unusual. He’d only seen her a handful of times since the initial plug-pulling night.
“Lisa, Ben is a great kid because you raised him right. This teenage rebellion thing is temporary and for now you should be glad I’m the scapegoat getting the brunt of it.” He pulled her in for a hug. “Now, come on. Don’t sweat this. We have a party to finish getting ready for!” This last he said with as much enthusiasm as he could muster.
The smile that broke across Cas’ face then made Dean’s heart almost stop beating. “Dean, that’s wonderful! I knew you would, though. You never give yourself credit for how smart—”
Benny snorted. “The one with the killer blue eyes who hasn’t stopped staring at you for a single second since we came out.”
“Charlie yelled at me all the way back to Anna’s for how I acted. She didn’t need to. I hated myself for it as soon as I was out the door.” When Dean continued to stare and say nothing, Cas said. “I’m sorry for storming out. Your answer took me by surprise. I never... in all the years of wondering why, I never suspected it might be that.”
Cas smiled again, this time with the sick glee he only got when he was going to say something Dean would regret hearing.
*hands out tissues* I know, sweetpeas, I know. That was a rough one. It made me tear up when I was editing it just now and I'm a terrible person with no redeeming qualities who is dead inside. I know it must have hurt you beautiful sweet loveys. ♥
Then Cas was sliding inside him and Dean knew he’d been right. It wasn’t like anything else. The unwavering stare, the large, hot hands on his hip and shoulder, the searing heat of that proportionally large cock against his hole - all of those were different. Still, that wasn’t what made this a new experience. It wasn’t even that Cas was an angel, though Dean couldn’t help but remember that, too. It was just that he’d never felt this level of attraction for anyone, male or female.
He waited, refusing to check his phone again yet. He got up to pace instead, knowing it couldn’t have been more than a minute or two. Cas would be here soon. If he got lost, he had the phone, so there shouldn’t be a problem.
The officer was all business and very efficient, if a little too thorough for Dean's liking. He'd only lost about twenty minutes by the time he was back in his Lube Mobile and on his way. There'd been no further interaction with Cassie or his brother. Dean balked at the name. It didn't suit the blue eyed man at all. He shook it off, since he would probably never see the guy again anyway. It didn't really matter what his name was, did it?
Dean smiled back, looking far less ashamed. “Guess we’ll have to see how dinner goes, huh?” He pulled Cas back to him for another hug. “Thanks, Cas,” he mumbled into Cas’s neck. “I needed this and I didn’t even know it.”
“Because I gotta tell ya, it’s totally working.” He waved a hand nonchalantly. “And don’t worry about the whole touching thing. Not a big fan of all the loving touching squeezing with strangers myself. Not that that has stopped me from having one night stands in the past, but that’s just because the sex part is easy. It’s all the huggy crap with people I don’t know that I don’t like.” His smile then was slow and wide. “Besides. Just looking at you is damn near as good as touching a lot of other people.”
Dean made himself smile back even wider. “Well, good. Because I’m happy and I wouldn’t trade it, either.” He brushed a stray lock of hair from Cas’ face, unable to keep from touching as often as he could get away with. “So what do you say we go back out there and hang out with Sam instead of you moping in here and pretending to sleep, huh?”
Dean made his way to the bar, holding his tears at bay. He didn’t do this. He didn’t fall for people and he didn’t do relationships that lasted longer than the average vacation. He didn’t. For Cas, though, he maybe would’ve made an exception. Not that Cas had ever given any indication that Dean’s unwanted feelings were returned.
“Hey!” he called to the stripper. “I’ll give you twice as much as the price of a lap dance if you get off his lap right now.”
“Cas didn’t have swings, but now he does, so we’re gonna show him how they work!” Sammy explained, chest puffed up with pride.
Cas was having a little trouble believing how well Sam’s plan was working so far. Dean had gone with everything Cas had asked of him, including kissing back like he’d been doing it for years. That hello kiss hadn’t been part of the plan, and it had taken all Cas’s reserves of courage, but he’d been rewarded by the sweetest few moments he’d known since his first years in Heaven.
“I, um... I shot—I shot him. My dad. He was gonna kill a little girl who hadn’t done anything, I had to—”
“Ha! Have you heard and seen yourself over the past half hour, Cas? You went into full on Dom mode and I was convinced you’d probably bedded hundreds of guys—”
“Yeah, Sammy, let go. ‘M awake, ‘m awake.” He shoved ineffectually at his younger brother. He didn’t have much strength in his arms and there was a tube lying on the ground that seemed to have been in his arm at some point. “Djinn?”
He was a little discouraged when he realized he hadn’t been grocery shopping in too long, but that was easily remedied. He scribbled a quick note on the door, letting Cas know where he was going, just in case he came back before Dean did and then he was off to the store.
I know. I'm a horrible tease. The worst. You like it, though. Because you know if you're good, I'll give you a reward.
The dark-haired man stepped on, saw the lobby button was already depressed and settled over on the far side of the elevator like a decent human being. They exchanged shy smiles and both stared at the number read out high up on the wall as though it were the most fascinating thing in the world.
To say Dean was a little stunned was like saying Cas’ eyes were kinda blue. He was struck speechless. He had not expected this, at all. He saw the hope on Sam’s face and the idea of living with Sam again was beyond awesome, but…he wasn’t sure he was ready to go back and play domestic family with people he barely knew, even for Sammy. Especially given his history with the Campbells. He finally swallowed hard and found his voice, but it took some effort.
“I realized I’ve let him dictate my life for far too long.” He held out his shot glass and waited until Dean filled it. “What he did to me was awful, but—” He downed his second shot. “—I’ve let him control my life and that’s just as awful.” He held out his glass again.
They had been taking their meals together for quite some time. It was one such ordinary seeming dinner, after far too many glasses of wine, when Cas—for Dean had long since caused him to think of himself as such—came to this startling revelation.
Castiel nodded in understanding, his curiosity satisfied. “Perhaps that is what I should do as well? Get a pay as you go phone?” He said it slowly, sounding out the words carefully to make sure he was saying it right.
Mairisi's prompt was Djinn/memory loss and Twist's was Wing!Kink. How'd I do, children?? I love you. ALL THE SCHMOOPS ♥
Their cocks rubbed against each other and it was as close to heaven as Dean thought he was ever likely to get. It felt like magic and joy and everything good. It felt like the best sex, ever—and they were just getting started.
Cas wiped a hand down his face and pushed at Dean until he got up. “Then we started to hear stories about men called hunters. They had learned of our kind and about werewolves and other creatures of the night and they were killing us wholesale.” He moved to the settee again and closed his eyes. Even centuries later, the memory was still painful. “They found us somehow. A team of them slaughtered my mother. Thankfully none of us had to watch it happen, but my father found her. Sick with grief, he fled.
—kissable mouth and—GRRRRRRR!!!” Each “stupid” was paired with a new stomp, but the growl was only accompanied by clenched fists and tightened shoulders.
So many of you asked for another, smutty chapter of this. And today, suddenly, the mojo was there. For all those other fics that I am neglecting, I'm sorry. I am also sorry that I tagged this E from the jump because I don't know why I thought it needed that. I mean, I tagged no smut, so... habit, perhaps? Anyway, this is not the smut. This is the lead up to the smut. Because this is already over 1000 words by itself. So I am splitting it. The second chapter will come (heh) soon, promise.
There was so much he wanted to say, but he couldn’t. Not if Cas wasn’t even speaking to him. He stroked the outside of the door with his fingertips, wishing it was Cas’ face he was touching. He pressed his forehead hard against the door and then pulled away. He turned to walk back across the hall to his room and the door behind him opened.
He couldn’t tell if Dean felt disappointment or relief when he changed his mind, but all he felt was the aching desire to be able to return home
The young woman he hadn’t known was behind him gave him a strange look as she walked around him and hurried down the aisle. He sighed and turned back to the penne and tagliatelle in front of him. He finally selected some angel hair and moved on to the next item on his list.
“Maybe not to you, but Alistair and his neanderthal friends make jabs at me all the time when you’re not around.”
“Mm, it was amazing,” Cas said sleepily, eyes closed and head lolling onto Dean’s shoulder. “Was I good, Dean?”
Dean stood up and pulled Cas to his feet as well. When they were halfway to the bathroom, Dean yelped as a hand swatted him on the ass.
Castiel himself felt a mixture of excitement and trepidation—which seemed to be his usual state of mind now that Dean had arrived in his life. He was anxious to meet Dean’s brother that Dean obviously cared a great deal for, but he was also worried that Sam and Castiel would not get along, since he knew that would diminish him in Dean’s eyes.
When the economy tanked, Dean had lost his corporate job. That’s why, at thirty, he was having to start over in the mail room of a new company. Too many people with his skill set had been put out of work, and the market was vicious. Getting a position when you didn’t know someone was virtually impossible—unless you were willing to take a serious pay cut. Even dropping down a level or two didn’t guarantee you’d be able to find anything.
!” Dean yelled as the tightening thread of his release snapped and sent him shivering and shaking into the most intense orgasm of his life.
Dean had to stop and stare for a moment, not sure whether to curse or bless the situation in which he had found himself. They had cuffed Cas to something further down the wall. There were boxes and heavy things stacked in such a way that the only way for Dean to reach the cuffs was going to be to practically lay on top of Cas.
“Works for me!” she called over her shoulder, already heading toward the scantily clad girl across the room.
“Well, hey, man, it’s getting late. Would you, I don’t know, wanna spend the night? I mean, could you call out of work tomorrow? I could drive you home.”
“Oh. Oh, Dean!” He grabbed Dean by the arms and pulled him forward into a hug. “I love you too. God, do I love you,” he whispered into the surfer’s ear.
He was just taking it out of the oven when Cas arrived back from town. He came immediately into the kitchen, confusion evident on his face.
They struggled with it for a while, Dean occasionally wondering what his mom and Cas were finding to talk about, but mostly he was too focused on trying to drag the fridge-loaded dolly up uncooperative steps. After about ten minutes, Cas strolled over.
teasing today. “I think they mean they wanna get another kid. Right?” He looked back and forth between his parents.
“You are beautiful, Dean. So beautiful…” Cas whispered as his own orgasm continued to build. It rung another shudder from Dean and he must have clenched down on Cas’ cock because suddenly the angel was coming, too. Deep gravelly groans were ripped from Cas’ throat as pleasure swept through him. Dean could feel the spasms deep inside and it woke something primal in him, made him want to drag Cas even deeper.
“Thank you,” Castiel told her sincerely. He hoped the pie would make up for his cruel words. He wanted Dean to like him. Jacob Davidson had been right. He could use a friend.
