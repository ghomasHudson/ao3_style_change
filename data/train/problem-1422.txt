Especially in the beginning he quickly forgot that this was an arrangement that wouldn’t last very long, and he craved Sherlock’s company far more than he had at first anticipated.
Even when Mycroft has expressed a sense of worry and concern in the past it has never been accompanied by anything more than a bland expression occasionally complemented by a furrowed brow or some eyebrows raised in slight disapproval.
If he did, he had never exposed anything the way he did with everything else he encountered, he had never dragged it out into the shameful light, revealed Mycroft’s biggest weakness and that fact alone spoke against Sherlock actually knowing anything.
“He is here because I asked for his help in tracking you down. As you had so unhelpfully left your phone behind when leaving, I could hardly call and ask you about your whereabouts. “
As luck would have it, Mycroft was spared a trip all the way to Appledore to meet with Charles Magnussen. The man was having his dinner at The Delauney and despite being initially stopped at the door by the maître’d, Mycroft’s card given to a waiter resulted in him being shown to the private dining room where the media mogul was sitting with a group of ten other people, enjoying a luxurious meal.
John’s frown deepened and for a second it looked like he was going to slam the door shut in Mycroft’s face and just wash his hands off the whole thing. A part of Mycroft wouldn’t blame if he made that decision.
Or so he thought.
As predicted, sentiment had the galling habit of raising its pathetic head when the other man, by the end of the call, had asked about Sherlock, how he was doing, despite most likely realising the stupidity of such a question as there was nothing truly wrong with Sherlock.
“Call it a hunch. What I’m really after is some answers. What the bloody hell happened to me. And to Sherlock and Magnussen? And what were you and your men doing there?”
He put as much disdain into that last word as he possibly could and John wondered if it was true or simply an act on his account, to prove that he did all this for his brother’s sake and not because of some hidden agenda. John wasn’t completely sure what to make of it.
John felt the accusation hit him hard and he knew Mycroft was right when he hinted that John had failed to do his job like he should have.
It was not a place he recognised and at first bewilderment had hit him, but his exhausted state prevented his mind to turn into action, tired limbs refusing to cooperate.
“I’ll look into that,” he had murmured and then made his excuses before Mycroft could come up with anything else that pointed out how neglectful John had become of his duties.
Despite the effort, Sherlock couldn’t resist answering back.
“Well, this version is not dying for many years yet.”
was it?”
As predicted, the Danish media man immediately seemed to realise who they were going to pick up, as Mycroft shrewdly had counted on, but to his immense disappointment Magnussen didn’t say anything to indicate that he wasn’t prepared to share a car with his supposed rival.
Even if Sherlock had agreed to explain something to him, he had no idea what that something was or if he really wanted to hear it. Because Sherlock had also made it clear that he was still going to marry Victor Trevor and for John to think anything else had been nothing but foolish.
“Mr Magnussen. Let me begin by offering my deepest apologies for disrupting your pleasantries for the evening like this. I should have checked in advance if you were alone or not. I assumed you were at liberty to speak with me as the waiter did not inform me of the situation properly. The fact that he told me to follow him after I had presented him with my card made me assume that you were available.”
“Impressive if that should prove to be the case, and you are certainly right regarding such an invitation improving our chances of success. But a very poignant question remains despite of these new developments...”
But Mycroft placed himself in front of John, all but reaching out to physically prevent him from doing what he so clearly wanted to do.
But then, as if changing his mind, he simply spun his head back to look at his guest and then turned on his heel to indicate that they should leave.
“Who alerted the ambulance?”
. May I remind you that you yourself were the one who said we needed to help Mycroft with his problems from the very beginning, against my wishes. And now you’re suddenly beginning to worry?”
“I’m heading over there now. Inform me of the destination of the car my brother took earlier and also if he is about to return while I’m still at Baker Street.”
He heard the sound of approaching steps on the stairs, as well as a familiar voice calling his name,  and he managed to scramble the photo as well as the note inside his pocket just as the door opened to reveal John walking in with a grocery bag in each hand.
He allowed himself a deep sigh because this was troubling news and not to his liking at all.
Was it really all good now or was he fooling himself?
“I’m sorry, but what is it that you want with me? I do indeed have a rather pressing schedule, as my employer would be able to tell you if he was here. So if you could please get to the point it would be much appreciated, Mr.....?
“But despite what wagging tongues of gossip might conjure up regarding the relationship between your brother and his flatmate, surely they are incorrect, no?”
Sherlock was right in saying that Mycroft didn’t like John.
But Mycroft was clearly fed up with the whole situation, stern lines etched across his forehead as well as the drained look in his eyes spoke volumes, and after a few seconds of hesitation, Magnussen begrudgingly pressed the number on his phone and then switched it to speaker.
Surprised he lowered his book to cast a curios look at her approaching figure while wondering why this place suddenly was invaded by people he had never seen here before and to his knowledge did not work here either.
“Not while having sex, Sherlock! I don’t want to think of my mother’s cinnamon rolls while simultaneously fucking someone!”
John juts his chin out in defiance.
Mycroft coldly pursed his lips.
As he allowed the pleasant vintage Sauvignon Blanc to satisfy his palate, a thought struck him.
If Victor noticed his hostility though, he ignored it completely. Instead he went on as if not having heard a word.
As they were exiting the restaurant, an idea hit him that might at least encourage the media mogul to take his own vehicle instead of sharing one, and thereby offering Mycroft a much needed break from his company.
Then he leaned forward until his face was mere inches away from Sherlock’s.
“It is indeed interesting information and I’m sure there is more to it than what you’ve told me tonight. But I get the gist of it and it could be worth something I suppose.”
Sherlock gave him a soft kiss but then entangled himself from John’s grip.
His own memory immediately jumps back to when he last saw his flatmate which was.....
It was too murky in the room and he was too tired to see any details properly but he immediately flinched in shock and then quickly began reaching for his service gun that he still, out of habit, kept nearby within reach.
John didn’t know him that well, they did not share the same sleeping accommodation, but he had seen him around and knew that he was good bloke. A good bloke who had helped him out just when he had needed it.
“Thank you, but I’ll stand, Mr Holmes,” he said curtly, making sure to include the name of the man in front of him to show that he wasn’t as clueless about who he was standing in front of as they probably assumed. He was certainly not going to allow himself to be intimidated by anyone who only by looking at him had made sure to make him feel very inferior.
“You and your snake certainly had nothing to do with it...,” Sherlock grumbled but Dr Roylott was already walking away again.
He had looked his usual impeccable self, a briefcase in one hand, an umbrella in the other, a herringbone patterned coat and his hair neatly combed without a single hair out of place. In his usual politely distant voice he had greeted John but his eyes had been narrowed and his features were particularly standoffish.
“Can you be absolutely sure? As you are so fond of constantly reminding everyone, no one deceives like an addict…..”
“So, you’re saying he had himself to blame for becoming the victim of a ruthless blackmailer, driving him to such utter despair that he rather chooses to end his life then having his secret exposed?”
Not exactly growing in intensity but still making itself known, poking at Mycroft’s senses whenever having anything to do with his brother, whether it was actually meeting him or merely thinking about him.
It was one of those left-over wreckages with a leaking roof, broken windows, standing more crooked than straight, hidden behind some trees in a small grove, abandoned a long time ago and apparently the perfect place for a clandestine meeting with your lover turned schemer, a good five kilometres from John’s workplace.
As Sherlock once again opened his mouth to protest John raised the riding crop while he tutted disapprovingly.
John sighed and finished what he was doing and then followed the man up the rackety stairs to the room where the two other men were waiting for him.
A flashback from a few weeks ago when they had lounged outside after a particularly strenuous sexual activity, John, still damp from sweating profusely during the act, had been reclining in a chair, half-naked in the garden and Sherlock, talking about some article he had read about in the latest issue of Guns & Ammo, had reached his hand out towards a table next to him and then stopped midsentence to turn his head to look at the table, exclaiming his surprise at the lack of ginger nuts next to his cup of tea.
Sherlock appreciated what they had and would never intentionally do anything to jeopardise their relationship.
“Victor calm down. There can be nothing constructive about blaming each other for Sherlock’s decisions. It was out of our hands all along.”
As he sat on the leather seat in his newly- ironed uniform, trying to feel at ease with wearing it again after such a long time, keeping himself occupied with watching the houses and streets pass by, glaring city lights and people crowding the sidewalks, broadcasting all the familiarities of a large city outside his car window, he thought of Sherlock and wondered how he was feeling tonight, if he was happy, what he looked like.
Magnussen’s eyes widened behind his glasses as realisation hit him.
************
Without actually looking at him properly, the delivery man simply shrugged his shoulders.
He was ready to put an end to things of the past right now and turn a new leaf.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes even further, a sharp response about to spill out of his mouth when he suddenly changed his mind and dramatically turned away from  Mycroft in a clearly dismissal gesture instead. As if to bring home that point he also draped himself deeper into his blanket.
Pemberton just snorted.
Sherlock did call him the most dangerous man John was likely to meet, on that first nigh together at Baker Street. And Sherlock should know what he’s talking about after all, considering circumstances.
“Fine, Dr Watson. I’ll allow you until eleven o’clock tonight. My car will take you back and wait for you until you’re ready to meet with me again. For your sake I hope you’re not wasting my time.”
“No. I just assumed...”
He would from now on try to focus on what he had in front of him instead of looking back at things that couldn’t be altered, start searching for a new job and let go off the past in an effort to move on. Sherlock would probably haunt his thoughts for a long time to come but by removing himself from any reminders of him it would eventually become easier.
They looked at each other and Sherlock felt a veritable tingle run along his spine when meeting those bottomless pools that Dr Roylott’s eyes resembled. It had been far too long since meeting an opponent who seemed to thrive on the theatrics as much as he did. And they had barely scratched the surface yet.
Magnussen took another bite of his food, clearly enjoying the flavour, washing it down with another sip from his glass. The ill temper when talking about Sherlock’s involvement with his flatmate was seemingly gone now.
people, Mycroft, you know that. I abhor them and they certainly can’t abide with me either.”
Then he stepped up to John and pointed it at him.
“You just accused me of being a criminal! This is
A second later a second shot roused him out of his shock and he ran towards the door, his heart hammering in his chest as panic was rising and a million horrible images flashed through his mind as he ran through the corridor to reach the place where he knew that the shots had been fired.
He can’t believe
“I'm not sure I want know how you pulled that off....,” John muttered, earning himself a dry look from Mycroft.
“Eager to do business? I like your determination, Dr Watson. But first, what is it that you hope to achieve by coming here tonight?”
He pulls out his phone and opens up the file he downloaded from Mycroft’s surveillance feed and then he plays it.
Soon enough John erupted, clenching his fists while glaring with fire in his eyes at the other man.
As he heard the approaching sound of sirens in the distance a medical kit was thrust under his nose and a quick ransack of its content rewarded him with an Epi-Pen he hoped would still be functioning and not be out of  date.
The threat of Mycroft’s menacing tone didn’t do any magic unfortunately as far as Sherlock was concerned.
A glimmer of hope ignited in the other man’s eyes and Mycroft made sure to quench it immediately by sticking to the reality as he saw it. No use letting anyone cling to any false pretences of hope when the situation spoke differently. So he continued before John had the opportunity to say anything.
John frowned, because out of all the people he had expected to hear from, this man was not among them. He knew what Sherlock had said about him likely trying to reach out, but now when it actually happened, John felt uncomfortably unprepared.
It said something about his own state of mind that the hint of sympathy he normally felt whenever Sherlock displayed obvious signs of discomfort and nerves, didn’t dictate him this evening. Perhaps he was nervous himself even if he would never admit to such a thing.
The only redeeming fact is that Sherlock most likely isn’t harmed in any way.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows in an enquiring gesture but said nothing, so John continued.
As they passed the room where Sherlock had taken him the previous time and instead headed down the stairs, John wondered where they were going exactly.
But for now, he needs to focus on what evidence he has managed to gather and unfortunately that means another visit to The Diogenes is in store.
He caught sight of Mike Stamford standing a little to the side, outside the circle of people closest to the car, and he made his way over to say hello as they seldom had the opportunity to meet like this.
John felt his fists tightening, itching to lash out, but trampled down any instinct he had of knocking his former employer. Instead he, as calmly as he possibly could manage it, said:
But he had no interest in who those people truly were, they were of no interest at all, whereas Sherlock liked to play his “deduction games”, probing so deep it was practically vivisection when he opened his mouth and tore peoples hidden secrets apart. He wanted to reveal, when Mycroft wanted to hide, he thrived in secrecy while Sherlock wanted to expose. They never managed to understand the other’s point of view.
His attention was brough back to their host as Dr Roylott closed the door behind him and crossed the room to join them.
Nothing but Sherlock could cause a reaction like this, John is sure of it.
“Did it work?”
“No need to be that polite about it. I have Mycroft Holmes as my soon-to-be brother in law who has a fondness for digging up everything there is to know about a person and the rest I take some particular pride in finding out on my own. Which brings me to the very reason for my nightly visit. I have some questions that I would like you to answer for me.”
Feeling a strange reluctance to being left alone, despite the unpleasant company, Sherlock grasped at straws to make the other man stay a little longer. He didn’t particularly look forward to being left with only his own thoughts to keep him occupied, just waiting for the inevitable.
But there was also another side of him now, the one that had perhaps spent the past couple of weeks considering a thing or two. The side of Sherlock who had had plenty of opportunity to think about actions and consequences, both while being tied up in a bed with a snake as his only companion, but also later, when safely bundled up under a hospital blanket with eons of time at his disposal to recount his recent decisions and the mistakes he had made.
This was like taking several steps back in time, to a more gauche era of interior design.  There was an even a cord hanging from the ceiling, used to call for the attention of servants. He wondered if the house harboured any of them or if Dr Roylott resided here alone like some desolate spectre.
If Victor was to be told of Magnussen’s deceit, it was bound to cause a disturbance between the two blackmailers. Surely a rift between Magnussen and Victor Trevor could only be a positive development?
“It doesn’t matter you, idiot!” Magnussen hissed, as if beginning to grow tired of the whole situation. His plans had not turned out to his liking and now he didn’t have anything left of Sherlock but a few measly photos and his own memories. It was frankly difficult to say what stung the most, the loss of Sherlock or the missed opportunity to humiliate Mycroft. To his surprise, it seemed to be Sherlock.
Instead he nodded and prepared himself to listen carefully to Sherlock’s instructions, realising the importance of succeeding, or this might actually be the last time they ever saw each other again.
He decides to forego the much-needed sleep and gets dressed once more before he heads out to hail a cab that will take him to the Diogenes.
“No, my sister’s bloke was blond and short, so clearly not the same one then. Goes to show you that this can happen to anyone though and you shouldn’t waste time mourning someone like that. My sister certainly didn’t. She has a steady companionship these days and seems very content with that.”
The feeling of just having tried to trick the devil made him feel rather uneasy.
So what is it that has been removed from between those two instances?
But John did none of those things. He was tired of this, the whole situation. How was he supposed to move forward when every damn idiot was determined to drag him straight back into it? Couldn’t they just leave him alone?
“No, you’re right. Of course, we won’t fail.”
“For various reasons he lives with me at the moment and will continue to do so until the wedding. What I expect of you, if you decide to except my proposition, is to come here twice a week to do a health check-up and then give me a written report afterwards. If anything happens to him beyond those two weekly instances that requires medical care you are naturally expected to come and perform your duties, but I suspect those occasions will not be too frequent. It’s more as a precautionary measure. The car will be at your disposal when your presence here is needed but otherwise you are to continue living in your current location and perform your normal duties until this assignment is finished. As I mentioned earlier, the pay will be significantly improved but that will also mean that your loyalties are with me and that your reports after each visit will be accurate and carefully written down before handed over to me. If I need to talk to you in person I expect you to be available and you are officially on duty 24 hours a day even if that will hardly be demanded of you, not even my brother manages to get up to something stupid at every single hour.”
John couldn’t help but revel in the sense of relief that things were finally going to back to normal now. Or whatever constituted as normal in their household.
John nodded as he made a mental note of that.
A pair of hands were held out in a placating gesture towards the agitated young man.
He held his breath while waiting for the impact of a gunshot to echo through the night, but instead, after a few seconds of silence, the voice simply resumed talking.
Fine, if Sherlock didn’t want to talk to him about it, he certainly wasn’t going to push the issue. But it did smart a bit that he was this easily dismissed after the pleasant time they had just enjoyed together, less than ten minutes earlier.
And he certainly didn’t mind having Sherlock spread out on a sofa, pressed against a bookcase or bent over a dinner table instead of doing it in a bed. It was unorthodox for sure, but so was everything else about the man.
“Thank you for including me to the evening’s celebration. You have a very.....
So what would be the point of staying here and force himself to look at the nauseating sight of Victor pawing all over Sherlock while Magnussen lurked at everyone in the background, giving Mycroft a run for his money as the creepiest man in the room.
But when he considered the fact that he was not going to meet Sherlock until next week and he would be left with his tortuous thoughts about their continuing relationship for several days, the opportunity to at least see Sherlock, was too tempting to turn down.
Sherlock had nothing underneath his dressing gown, Mycroft was well aware, despite the fact that it was too dark to truly see.
Because of course it had not been a dream.
But there was a reason why he preferred talking on the phone instead of texting.
Sherlock was the perfect model of course, all interesting angles, shadows and unusual features. Victor would never grow tired of looking at him and the photographer had been exited as well when seeing him, insisting that a portrait should be taken.
But this, right now, was nothing like John’s way of looking at him when feeling aroused. This was like being vivisected, put under a scalpel and metaphorically being cut open on display and Sherlock tried his best to tamper down the urge to squirm under the other man’s stare.
Or was it something Sherlock for some reason kept as a secret, even if that notion seemed quite unfathomable. His younger brother was notoriously famous for lacking the ability to feel shame and blackmailing was after all about failing to cope with embarrassment.
“If you’re only just now asking yourself that question, Dr Watson, I’m going to be terribly disappointed. But assumingly my brother’s silver tongue has managed to beguile yet another man to follow him down the path to destruction, so maybe it shouldn’t surprise me that you don’t know who you’re dealing with. A little late to turn back now, I should think, but of course there is still that option I guess.”
It reads:
Sherlock opened one eye to peer at him as if trying to suss out how upset Mycroft actually was and when realising that he apparently was very displeased he opened the other eye as well and sat up straighter in his bed.
“Ah, but it has your fingerprints all over it, and I took the precaution of wearing gloves. It is quite chilly tonight after all.”
“Are you out?” he said the second Mycroft picked up. He could hear noises in the background so at least that must mean that they had managed to put some distance between themselves and the house.
particular meeting?”
“And that is the very reason why I’m beginning to hesitate doing business with you, Mr Magnussen. I’m not sure why exactly you’re interested in what I have to offer but from your insinuations I assume you want to stick it to the Holmes brothers. And that’s is fine by me, I have no loyalties towards them. But there is a sentimental aspect to all of this, nonetheless. Sherlock Holmes broke my heart. It can be quite difficult to put a prize on feelings. And as you mentioned, if he, God forbid, should pass away, I’m not sure that I....”
That doesn’t necessarily mean that he was abducted straight away, it just means that no one was able to spot him.
John’s mouth clicked shut for a second as he contemplated how a situation that had seemed pretty terrible to begin with could possibly still turn out even worse. Changing the sheets or not, Mycroft would find out what had had happened in here and John would be out on his arse within the blink of an eye.
And there was no way in hell he wanted to include Magnussen in any sort of team effort to try and figure out where Sherlock was and if he was in any danger.
He never knew if Sherlock had expected another outcome. They had never discussed it afterwards.
It felt like all those intricate slots that needed to be slid into place were now fitting into the desired pattern and there could finally be something more than just a glimmer of hope.
He decided to focus on Mycroft instead, out of two evils, the one he knew how to attack was the easier choice.
If Mycroft had gone ahead with ridding himself of Victor, if only for the satisfaction of seeing his brother liberated from his fiancé’s smothering clutches, Magnussen would immediately have been able to discern Mycroft’s fingerprints all over that incident.
Trying to cut off the inevitable lecture that is surely about to spill out of the man’s lips, John interrupts that impulse by being quicker.
Not that Victor would be deterred from his amorous pursuits by any of this, he was far too stubborn to let something like drugs get in the way of achieving what he wanted.
Hopefully by evening he would have gotten a better view of the unexpected situation and perhaps even a new leverage to dangle over the Holmes brother’s heads now that the initial threat had soon run its course.
“Case,” was the short answer.
John swivelled to look at Mycroft, his eyes widened.
John whipped his had to stare at Mike. Then he quickly turned his head back and stretched his neck to get a better look.
“It is unfortunate that such filthy habits have this sort of side-effect on your appearance though. Not even I would choose to take advantage of you in this state. Too reminiscent of penetrating a living corpse.”
This was the first time John had witnessed the older Holmes brother bluntly dictate terms with Magnussen, otherwise always going for polite chilly smoothness to run its course even when disagreeing.
By now, Magnussen must have heard something about it and is most likely looking for the right opportunity to approach what he thinks is going to be a very nettled ex-lover.”
“We’re leaving in fifteen minutes. By then I expect you to be ready and prepared for the evening, not a word out of line and at your best behaviour. John, we’ll see you at the venue. Your car will be here any minute now so I suggest you head downstairs to wait and leave my brother to finish preparing.”
"Didn’t we already have this conversation not that long ago? With that exact riding crop.”
Maybe Sherlock opted to have a photo in his bedroom instead, or in his wallet or on his phone or any other place where people had things that reminded them of people they loved and cherished.
?” John asked incredulously, because a bloody bedroom with a half-naked Sherlock Holmes on top of a bed? Sherlock Holmes who was about to get married by the way and had the creepiest brother imaginable, and why did it feel like John’s mouth had suddenly gone very dry at the prospect of this?
“I don’t think I need to tell
“Luckily I know all about how to punish those in dire need of a well-deserved lesson.”
The urge to wipe it out by punching a fist straight into the other man’s taunting face was becoming overwhelming and he felt his hands tingling at the prospect.
Instead of focusing on John, wasn’t it better if Victor’s attention was turned towards the real culprit among them?
It was that woman working at the Holmes residence who provided him with useful information from time to time.
“Oh, I don’t doubt that Victor loves Sherlock in his own very peculiar kind of way, more like a possession than a human being if his speech was anything to go by. But what of Sherlock and
So, naturally it hurt, and it tormented him to think about any of it, but luckily work, as it usually did, offered him some well-needed reprieve and his focus could be on what he was doing at the moment, nothing else.
“So who’s the big wig then?” he asked instead.
And since the first time hearing it, John had been forced to listen to that same voice torment him with the most sickening topic imaginable, no less than a week ago, standing with a drink in hand facing a table full of anonymous guests while leering at the recipient of his flowery speech.
“What where you doing breaking into my property today? Wasp sting or not, you had no business being there, as I have told you on numerous occasions before.”
In that aspect John Watson was as predictable as most men who happened to find someone a little out of their league and who struggled with that notion just as strongly as they struggled to keep that person under close watch, so as not to lose them to someone more worthy. It was a weak trait to be so jealous, Sherlock would naturally not leave John for anyone else solely based on a comparison of status, especially not to someone like Magnussen. But the destructive combination of feeling like the underdog as well as an instinctive streak of protectiveness was unfortunately a part of John Watson’s personality, and if flaring up too often, it could turn problematic for his brother and his army doctor.
Because there was more to come.
And with those words Sherlock was out the door, leaving John to ponder about the impact of the man who had just interrupted their peace.
One rather significant detail was that his employee, the pilot of the helicopter, must have seen or at least heard his boss’s screams of terror but stubbornly claimed he had no knowledge of events and had not attempted to aid Magnussen in his plight.
with him, I think I know him far better than anyone else here!”
Chained to a bed in the middle of the room, naked and stretched out on his back against starch white sheets, dark curls splayed out against the fabric, staring back at him from his immobile position, was a very familiar figure.
“There is no point continuing this conversation as my mind is made up and yours seems to be as well, Mr Holmes. I’m terminating our agreement and will not return to tend to your brother anymore. I’m sure you and Mr Trevor, between the two of you, will find a suitable candidate to tend to him for the duration of time, someone who will hopefully find a way to put a  stop the drug abuse as well. All I know is that it’s not going to be me.”
“You misinterpret what I’m trying to tell you. We did all participate in the same game, I just made a few precautions, as life has a way of not arranging itself to the plotting of humans. Victor Trevor was always going to be a loose cannon for example, safety measures needed to be made in case of his meddling. After having spent a considerable amount of time in his presence yesterday I knew the state he was in, it was only a matter of time before he was going to interfere in some way. And considering that he had your gun in his possession…”
But then suddenly Victor’s face turned amiable once more and he put the medical bag down on the floor between them for John to pick up himself.
“He most certainly is. I want him out of here. And he can take his companion with him as well!” Dr Roylott had turned his head to nod in John’s direction. His fists were still clenched, and he looked ready to strike again at any second.
Why is Mycroft being so infuriatingly immobile and slow?
“Of course, I’ve read them, Dr Watson. Sherlock is my fiancé after all, and extremely important to me. Naturally I would want to know about his health, make sure that everything is as it should be.”
Patiently Mycroft waited.
As soon as they stopped in front of the house he got out of the car, not bothering to wait for her to catch up before he threw the front door open and rushed inside.
He positioned himself by the door without turning the light on, his back against the room and waited.
John felt how bile was beginning to rise in his throat just picturing that disgusting man with the dead eyes behind his spectacles, crawling under the covers to allow his repulsively sweaty hands to travel all over Sherlock’s naked body, inflicting him with harm as well as humiliation, while the younger man had no other option but to allow for it to happen.
He had been informed that Sherlock had gone straight to Baker Street after his visit to Mycroft, but then had left in a rather agitated state less than an hour later, the front door apparently slammed quite thoroughly in his wake, and in a state of being only half-dressed. Mycroft’s intel had then lost track of him soon after and had not been able to find him again.
“What is your assignment?” he asks, looking at the screen.
. I just think it’s an immature method of reaching results. It’s like something out of a teenage novel or a soap on the telly,” Sherlock complained.
But he found neither despite his fingers fervently searching everywhere, in panic trying to locate where the bullet might have penetrated the body while his brain simultaneously was trying to tell him that not so much as a drop of blood was evident anywhere, not on the body, not on the sheets.
Just as he was ready to get out of the car before Mycroft would try to persuade him with yet another offer, he paused for a second and then decided to say something that had been nagging on his mind ever since Saturday night.
held a part of the blame for this terrible situation, as if
It had taken him a significant amount of time to guess what Mycroft Holmes’s pressure point was, as he, very much like Magnussen himself, was one of those men who seemed like a blank piece of paper even upon a closer inspection. If not for Victor Trevor, it could have taken even longer before finding out was his weakness was.
“You see, John, I think you’re mistaken about the one in control here, just like Mycroft was. But it’s quite interesting how you both think it ought to be you. Glad to be able to point out the difference between fact and fantasy.”
“Hardly. What about that time you decided to join the invasion of Afghanistan?”
He asked even if he knew the answer. Because there wasn’t anything else left now.
Secretly he cursed his brother for the umptieth time this evening for putting him in this uncomfortable position, but his features said nothing about his inner feelings and when John returned a moment later he simply walked over to the car and opened the door, making sure that he was seated in the middle so he could put at least a little  distance between the two other men.
“Well off you go, Watson. Work started ten minutes ago and you need to change into your work uniform,” Mr Rudd said over by the door, the newspaper now discarded on the floor, the man clearly ready to get rid of him.
It’s quite a disturbing sight and John quickly lowers his razor to turn and face Mycroft to confirm that the image projected in his mirror isn’t some sort of illusion conjured up by a partly sleep-deprived mind that hasn’t yet been woken up properly by the aid of a cup of strong morning coffee.
“Well, that’s probably the reason he brought his own entertainment then, as no one else is that keen to talk to him,” Hawkes offered before turning the tap on to wash his hands.
“Aaah, John....” he heard Sherlock gasp above his head. “Please.....!”
“Well, don’t!” Magnussen hissed as he got to his feet. “You are agitating our host!”
It’s the whole segment, beginning with Mycroft entering the room, Sherlock being in a foul mood and John rather quickly making excuses to leave as the sniping is already threatening to become overbearing.
But now curiosity got the better of him and with some effort he hauled himself from the sofa, swaying a little bit as he rose, before he clumsily went down on all four to creep under the table to retrieve it.
Englishmen in general were such a naive group of people, relying on idiotic conventions like sportsmanship and respect for those in charge. In his own opinion, life was never about playing things fair, it was all about what could be taken from others to strengthen your own position. His more calculating way of looking at things had helped him over the years dealing with these British cretins.
On the other hand, neither Mycroft nor Magnussen, to his knowledge, had any weapons with them and this Dr Roylott was not the most amiable man apparently, so maybe it was good if one of them could fend for them if necessary.
As he, after a few additional steps reached the grove where he had felt Victor press the muzzle to his back, his eyes scoured his surroundings for a final time, looking for any sudden movements or lurking shadows, but he failed to see anyone.
Because, after all, it was Magnussen who came off as the true villain in this situation even if Victor certainly had accomplished his fair share of devilry as well.
“That’s the gist of it, I think. If you have other things you consider to be unclear, feel free to voice them.”
role to play? The phrasing also implies a more intimate relationship than what normally exists between an abductor and his victim. There is nothing caring about keeping another person captive in John's opinion!
“I’ll let you know what I decide to do about Magnussen. You’re officially not in charge anymore.”
It was never proven to be Sherlock who had been behind those so-called pranks, but on the other hand, who else could it be?
And with that Mycroft stepped away from his brother and headed for the door.
“...no need to stop....” Sherlock purred and with that approval John tore away the beige coverlet and pushed the younger man with some force down on the bed before he climbed up on top of him while fumbling with the zipper of his trousers.
“I wasn’t worried....” John began but was interrupted by an amused little laugh.
He took a few steps closer, his eyes roaming the body in front of him, lingering a few seconds longer on the wrists in the handcuffs, as well as the opened-up button that alluringly still held the trousers in place but was like an invitation to explore what was beneath.
A strong urge to rip that cigarette out of Sherlock’s hand as well as disrobing him from that silky dressing gown hit John forcefully and he had to actually control himself so his features didn’t give him away.
John tiredly drew a hand across his features and sighed.
He had stepped too close without looking and when noticing its presence mere inches from him, coiled up, ready to strike out, he had frozen to the spot at first and simply stared at it, waiting for it to attack. Even to have slowly removed his foot could have provoked a reaction.
“A plan is only as good as its ability to change depending on circumstances. Did you really think I would allow such an important opportunity as your admittance to Magnussen’s house to rely on only one course of action? We had 13 different scenarios prepared for last night and the one to play out happened to be number 7.”
“Erhm, media?” John ventured hesitantly. “Newspapers I believe, something like that.”
“You tell me,” Magnussen was heard in the background. “What were your intentions for coming here tonight? Did Sherlock promise you to be a really good boy if you played along with his little scheme, trying to gain access to my home?”
“Oh, it’s
***********
“Oh, yes. Dr Roylott did breach the subject with me just the other day. Said that someone fitting the description enough for me to realise who it was, had been making inquiries about him. He wasn’t particularly pleased by this, but I think I know enough about your charming little brother to realise that he hardly cares about the opinions of others if he is intrigued enough by someone.  He is so refreshingly recklessness in that regard, seems to be drawn to danger in a most irresponsible fashion.”
Crawled up against the window, very much like the imaginary cat of Mycroft’s imaginary family, if he had been born a different person with other dreams and aspirations, Sherlock presented a black silhouette, features not discernible, the riot of curls sticking up like a strange-looking crown on top of a thin creature draped in a silk robe and nothing else. The amber glow of a cigarette butt was the only telling sign that he was in fact awake. Knowing Sherlock the way he did, his brother could very well have been asleep sitting up, pressed up against the windowpane.
“I’m merely worried about you, that’s all. You are very important to me, whether you choose to believe it or not. And when I look at you, you don’t seem to be coping fine at all right now.”
It was habitual, that feeling had been with him since they were children and he doubted it would ever go away, even if a rational part of him argued that it was far too maudlin to be harbouring irrational sentiment like that.
Mycroft is pretty sure any first attempts would have been shot down.
He stepped up behind Magnussen’s back, annoyed by the other man’s overt sign of exclusion.
There is a reason for him having a moniker like “The Ice Man.”
“What?” He manages to exclaim while a million thoughts fight for dominance inside his head.
At the same time he was clear-headed enough to realise that no agreements should be accepted on such superficial grounds as him being slightly attracted to someone and here the disadvantages of the arrangement emerged.
“Don’t be ridiculous! I am not willing to endure another second standing here listening to two supposedly grown men argue like inane schoolboys. You need to calm down, Dr Watson, get a hold of yourself. These outbursts are completely pointless and serves no purpose to what we are here to do.”
But no. He was far too annoyed with Sherlock at the moment to resort to childishness. If he had run off to sulk somewhere, let him be then, John had far more important things to do.
Once he reached his destination it was afternoon and the wind slowly rustled in the leaves of the trees as he walked up the path to the house.
“Well, this was an exception.”
Weak in his obsession, irrational, needy, allowing his feelings to govern his judgement and generally a difficult man to tolerate even in very small doses. There was something a bit unhinged about him that probably hadn’t been there to begin with, but life must have treated him in a way that had caused the young man to lose his footing of reality a little bit.
There was a sharp click when the entrance button was pushed and then the finger pressing the intercom withdrew as well.
There was no use speculating without hearing from Sherlock himself what he had to say on the matter, John could continue to drive himself around the bend for hours on end if he kept this up, but to no avail as the person who held all of the answers wasn’t here to enlighten him of the state of the situation.
Without a second of hesitation he grabbed the infernal painting off the wall and tore it down, smashing it against a small coffee table and watched with a jolt of excitement how the canvas was ripped right across the shadowy figure’s ominous form.
They were never going to be anything beyond this.
John turned to look at Sherlock.
“So what I said before still stands true. You are not easily replaceable to me, John Watson and I’m sorry that I ever made you believe that you were. I’m also apologizing in advance for the trouble I’m about to drag you into, if you’re still willing to return to me that is. Because the reason why I’m here, is to ask if you would consider continuing what we started and come back to me again?”
John stared at Sherlock, his eyes narrowed now.
John turned his head to try and get a look at who this visitor might be but was unable to see anything on account of the crowd.
The detail that pulled him out of this assumption was the fact that the bell strap was actually moving out of its own accord and was distinctly progressing closer towards him.
Mycroft’s cold stare intensified even further and he opened his mouth to reply when there was a sharp knock on the door and the female assistant came in with the Narcan, interrupting the tension between the two men, leaving whatever Mycroft had been about to say unspoken.
Damn it! Personalizing a quote from the Godfather was hardly any better than quoting James Bond, but if Mycroft thought that he tried to make fun of the situation, he didn’t let it show, in fact he didn’t so much as bat an eyelid. Instead he just carried on as if John hadn’t said anything.
A twitch of concern crossed his mind as he contemplated how Sherlock was actually doing if Mycroft was keeping him away from Victor’s prying eyes this many days after the overdose. Had something else perhaps happened after he had left the house? Another relapse? Something worse?
“....I never....imagined…I mean, he came highly recommended and was vetted like all the others.....” he murmurs and John has to put all his efforts into not shaking him despite his earlier decision to remain calm. One of them has to keep a cool head and as surprising as that sounds, it seems like it’s going to be him.
Mycroft did not bat an eyelid at this request, merely fetched a vase from a nearby table and disposed of the flowers before handing it to John.
John didn’t reply, because what could he say without revealing that he and Sherlock had engaged in a far more intimate relationship than what usually existed between a doctor and his patient.
Indecision made John uncertain if accepting this invitation was such a good idea. Victor seemed too paranoid for his liking and there was a risk that he would manage to wind John up sufficiently for him to lash out with his fists if provoked thoroughly enough. There was also the very unappealing prospect of having to sit through a dinner party that celebrated Sherlock’s upcoming wedding and he could scarcely think of anything he would hate more than seeing Victor make gooey-eyes at his future husband all night. The very thought made him seethe with actual hatred.
Instead he cleared his throat and managed to tear his eyes away from the part where the robe was threatening to fall open and reveal even more than it already did.
“My driver will take you.”
In a surge of possessive passion John grabbed him around the waist and switched their positions so Sherlock ended up on his back against the carpet and John straddled his naked hips.
“Maybe they haven’t found the right incentive to do so yet.”
He was probably in his mid to late twenties even if he looked younger and he had very pale skin that was glistening from sweat which John noticed as he knelt down beside him to feel for his pulse. His body was very lean and lithe, as well as tall, which made him appear to be all limbs and angles. Dressed in a white shirt and a pair of dress pants, angular features with pronounced cheekbones and plush lips and at the top of his head a cascade of dark curls that splayed out on the pavement, gave the sight a dramatic touch beyond the actual severity of the scene.
But just like then he accepted the offered hand, shook it firmly before he drew Sherlock closer to himself and pressed a kiss to his knuckles while he searchingly looked into his eyes.
And John can actually relate, he knows the magnetic pull of Sherlock Holmes at first hand so he considers it fully plausible that a man in charge of watching Sherlock through a camera all day sooner or later will either lose his marbles completely or simply fall under the spell of the allure that is the mercurial personality of the consulting detective.
Trying to control himself and not to get ahead of things John kept his calm though and defiantly denied the other man the pleasure of seeing him take offence from his words.
“Without giving away too much, he came on to me and I was happy to oblige, even if I would never have made the first move myself. I’m a professional doctor after all, engaging sexually with a patient is not something I’ve ever done before and never would do under normal circumstances. I was naïve enough to fall for his seductive skills and I’m afraid that I was too smitten to end it when I should have. It happened pretty early into the arrangement and it didn’t stop until I resigned.”
“Why don’t you begin by telling me what exactly it is that has happened?”
“I’m not sure that I’m willing to succumb to any more arrangements, considering where the last one landed me...”
“I’m very well aware that I was the one to call you here, no need to get defensive. I was just curious about what you wee hoping to get out of this meeting. You have after all no idea what I have to propose and vice versa, I don’t know what you can offer me in return.”
Because never, not even once, had he felt any indication that Sherlock was still doing drugs. And yet, with the proof he had in front of him he suddenly realised that there had been signs all along that he had neglected to see.
“I just wanted to stick it to him, annoy him the way he annoyed me. But what I ended up stealing were high security missile plans that would have ended him in a lot of trouble if it had been discovered that they had been stolen from the safe in his office.”
A moment of silence followed while Mycroft waited for the other man to get to the point and be done with it. He was in no mood to explain his lack of manners or why he thought his greeting had actually been quite acceptable considering circumstances.
“What does
, Sherlock thought grimly.
John brough out a small torch and pried one of the eyes open, immediately struck by the size of the pupil, smaller than normal even considering that light was being aimed straight at it.
Mycroft is of the opinion that I should have included you in the plan from the start but I figured that with your poor acting skills it would be better if you believed there to be a real addiction.
When next seeing Sherlock, he was going to ask him about it.
He knew where Magnussen worked of course, as Mycroft had so kindly filled him in.
“I did what was manageable to achieve under the circumstances I was faced with. Not my fault your moronic plan was made to backfire. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. It was never going to succeed in the way that you had planned it.”
Sherlock wanted to reach out to placate the image of John and actually managed to raise his arm from it’s fallen position of his chest to grab on to John’s hand.
“I insist.”
He woke from the present sound of thunder rolling in through the slightly open window and opened his eyes slowly to navigate his surroundings and the source of the sound despite fully recognising it. He normally didn’t feel the presence of bad weather like he did when sleeping in the country house and any excuse for not immediately catching up to the familiar sound was valid as far as he was concerned.
Damn, another change of topic. This was likely going to be a long evening.
John could feel himself sucking in air as his lungs suddenly seemed too constricted to function, the uncomfortable feeling of something cold and hard unfurling inside his chest. Because as Sherlock hurled these words at him a realisation began to form inside his head and if the answer proved to be correct, he didn’t know what to do with himself. And yet, it needed to be asked.
But even if Sherlock was rather thin indeed, the hint of his ribcage actually visible when he stretched out, John could not find any cause for concern.
The issue of the photographic evidence Magnussen held over Sherlock’s head would have to be dealt with of course, but it would at least not be
“I wasn’t sure what to expect walking in here. I heard that something as insignificant as a wasp was almost able to kill you today. I always assumed you would be killed by pirates or from sticking your nose into the business of a gang of highway men. You always were a person suited to die from an utterly outlandish reason.”
He hadn’t bothered to look if the door to Sherlock’s bedroom had been open or shut after all.
And unfortunately, the only one with any information about the identity of this unknown individual, was Magnussen.
The use of the bathroom, the only place where a person can get any sort of privacy by locking the door without it seeming suspicious presents the perfect opportunity to remove something from there while John, as an additional advantage, was getting dressed upstairs.
“He does what he’s told, Mycroft, you can’t actually control what he chooses to write in them as well. If that were the case, you could just as well write them yourself.”
“So what happens now? You just sit here and watch me die?”
Not that he was looking forward to another meeting with Mycroft anytime soon, but if given an opportunity to see Sherlock before the scheduled appointment he would certainly not turn it down.
“Of course I’m not backing out of anything! I’m just baffled that there’s actually two of you who can do the deduction thing. Your family dinners must have been a laugh.”
Sherlock had showed him a secret pathway through a hedge in the furthest corner of the estate where he himself had sneaked out without Mycroft’s surveillance team noticing, thereby avoiding the hassle of going through the front gate where cameras were placed.
“Fine. But I’m not lying down on that filthy floor, and the table looks like it’s about to fall into pieces at any second. If we do this, I’m having you against the only wall in here that doesn’t look as if it is about to topple over.”
John opened his mouth to stop him, because had he really alluded to John’s own sister when he had said “your own family background”?
Unlikely as a friendship developing under these conditions sounded, it had in fact happened, and for a brief second they had stayed content in that phase, until John’s subconscious started yearning for something more and he developed feelings that in the beginning resembled nothing more than a silly crush he most of the time tried to ignore.
“Why does that matter?”
“I need Narcan to stave off the effect of an overdose. If we work from the very loosely based theory that it is morphine it could work,” he said instead. “We have no way of testing if it actually is morphine that he has taken but since you refuse to take him to a hospital that’s the best option we have right now. I don’t know how we are going to get our hands on any Narcan at this hour though.”
“I never guess. I
John stared at him for a second to see if he was perhaps having him on, but as Sherlock still looked at the bottle in John’s hand quite expectantly, he realised that this probably wasn’t a joke.
He wasn’t even that fond of taking cases that forced him to travel out of town. Local police enforcements were always so doggedly territorial and suspicious of input by someone from the outside, he always ended up in a foul mood when confronted with their attitude and unless the case was really intriguing he didn’t bother making the journey.
“Well, to begin with; there never was any issue with drugs. At least not to the extent that I made you believe. I never took anything on the night of Magnussen’s party.  It was all just a ruse created to trick him and subsequently you as well, as I needed for you to believe it, in an effort to fool Magnussen.
He really needed to get out and find the other two before they managed to find what he so carelessly had left in his wake, and fuelled by this thought, he delivered the next blow succesfully.
Next to the fireplace, tilted against the wall was a firepoker that looked a little out of shape, like someone had tried bending it for some reason.
“It has also struck me how remarkably without friction his visits have been conducted. Considering that I know how bad you can be when you put your mind to it and that you went through a whole string of doctors that barely lasted more than a few weeks, it is quite the feat to have undergone two months caring for you.”
When he came back to Baker Street it was well past midnight but despite the late hour John realised that he wouldn’t be able to sleep as long as he hadn’t heard anything from Sherlock,.So instead he made himself a cup of tea, hesitated between opting for the tv or reading a book, but then decided that the book at least would make him more susceptible to any sounds coming from the front door.
Victor had been right in that there had never been any love lost between them, but they had conducted their dislike of each other with far more effort previously, but just like everything else around him had suffered a tendency to crumble to pieces as of late, so was their willingness to keep up the pretence of cordiality.
“Your actions today showed signs of quick thinking and the ability to act accordingly in a stressful situation. Those traits are surprisingly hard to come by, more so than you would imagine considering how many people I encounter on a regular basis in my line of work.”
As he poured himself another helping of whiskey, he wondered how Victor would react when realising that Sherlock might have managed to slip his net.
There had been plenty of opportunities to experience that same scenario over the years and he always felt just as uncomfortable being put through it, because this was a place where someone like him with all the power he had at his disposal still had no impact over anything – he was helplessly in the hands of the medical staff just like everyone else, with no way of predicting the outcome.
A group of several men stormed in, all dressed in black suits with non-descript faces, anonymous yet sharp and determined. Unsurprised by anything presented to them in the now very crowded space they were occupying.
He had already previously suspected that the good doctor’s interest might have been piqued, but people in general were always fascinated with Sherlock one way or another, that didn’t necessarily mean that they wanted to sleep with him.
If this is the content he is going to be looking at, assumingly for the next couple of hours, he is going to be needing something stronger to prevent his thoughts from diverting to other, more pleasurable feelings.
But it had seemed like a good idea at the time.
He closed his eyes while bracing himself and then allowed his mouth to widen as a second finger was inserted between his glistening lips.
There were still some unknown variables that could topple their whole plan and if that happened, Sherlock would be tethered to Victor or worse within a couple of weeks and John Watson likely running for his life with a target on his back to get away from Magnussen and Victor’s need for vengeance and retaliation.
“I never asked for it....”
“The question not yet asked this evening, Mr Holmes, is where that delicious brother of yours actually is tonight? I sent him one of these as a little reminder of the appetizer he presented me, hoping for him to offer me a taste of the main course as well, but I have not heard a single word from him.”
There is also a probability that Sherlock for some reason went willingly with his abductor, most likely being fed a good lie as to why he should go with him.
Mentally grinding his teeth at Sherlock’s audacity to resort to such a mean trick to achieve his goals, John quickly glanced at the panel on the wall to see how many floors were left to reach their destination before replying.
There is a bond between the two flatmates, he saw it already on that first night, even if he tried to tamper down the uneasy feeling he got when seeing them walk away together into the night after having solved the case of  the cab driver turned serial killer.
And as Dr Roylott was staring at Mycroft instead of Magnussen, John realised that the intended victim had not been Magnussen at all but the older Holmes brother who must have moved out of reach, resulting in Dr Roylott accidentally tipping over the chair Magnussen had been lounging in.
Because even if Sherlock never spoke a word of his fiancé, there were occasionally small telling signs of his existence that made themselves known anyway.
Granted, those rules had been related to sexual activities and those were clearly not going to happen tonight, but it still annoyed him that Mycroft felt the need to be there when he would have wanted to talk to Sherlock alone.
He was fairly certain that there hadn’t been one on display, even if the room had been very cluttered and a photo could easily have been hiding amongst all the other items fighting for space in that room.
He could feel Sherlock’s fingers gripping frantically at his head, as if trying to stop himself from unravelling, holding on for dear life as John took one of the balls into his mouth, circled his tongue around it before plopping it out of his mouth and rub it between his fingers instead.
If that indeed was the case here.
John’s frantic “What have you done?” was met with no answer.
“You have a lot of nerve sneaking up on me like this! Do you really think I would be stupid enough to fall for your tricks again after everything that’s happened? Or was this a joint collaboration between you and that deranged fiancé of yours? Has the world actually gone completely mad or why is it that everyone is running around in the middle of the night, behaving like lunatics? Who’s next? Is your brother perhaps going to jump out of a bush with a rapier?”
“Well, I think your lungs would appreciate some fresh air nonetheless,” John decided and turned to face the large windows, looking for a way to open at least one of them.
Victor’s hand had travelled all the way from the shoulder over to the face while he talked and now a finger was put under Sherlock’s chin to tilt his face upwards so their eyes could meet, and John felt a stab of discomfort pierce him in the gut at the sight of it.
They immediately took care of Victor as well as the gun, one moment he was still sitting on the floor, then next both he and the weapon were gone, quietly disposed of.
He rose from his chair and untied the knot of the dressing gown, allowing it to fall in a heap on the floor before walking out of the room.
Mycroft resented the fact that he was so weak as to succumb to such childish feelings. Especially as he had no valid reason to feel that way.
He sneered as he said the words, face twisting with contempt.
John could just picture Mycroft’s face, the look of distaste at being approached with something as lowly as a threat of blackmail, and then the realisation that the situation most likely was far more serious than he had initially understood.
He realised that he needed for this meeting to wrap up quickly if he didn’t want to risk giving anything away under Magnussen’s analytical stare, the longer he stayed, the bigger chance that he would put his foot in his mouth somehow.
Mycroft’s mention of the weight loss, the way Sherlock had managed to divert John from performing any examinations over a very long period of time, the way he had seemed so energetically restless even after having had sex, his body always fidgety afterwards while John himself had felt completely spent.
He glanced over at Magnussen who had leaned back in his seat again, clearly pleased with his effort to rile the military doctor out of his stubborn rigidness. It was difficult to say who was the more childish one, and Mycroft still marvelled over how something as banal as jealousy so easily turned reasonable men into petty and spiteful beings. He felt certain his brother would have shared that view if he had been present.
“It was a gift from my father. I received it when I graduated from medical school. It used to belong to an uncle who worked as a doctor, so in a way it’s both an heirloom as well as a gift, so you got it right on both accounts.”
? Arriving in a car supposedly sent by
normally do with Dr Roylott?”
“And what a remarkable job he seems to be doing. No one’s lasted this long before. The question is if how good his medical skills really are or if his talents lie elsewhere.”
This immediately raised John’s hackles.
Without turning to look at him, Magnussen answered calmly.
“Well, I did tell you, Mycroft, that you missed putting that particular aspect into consideration when you planed this little scheme.”
John wondered how living a life where everything could be arranged with the snap of a finger would be like and how much it could shape a person if almost everything was so easily obtainable. But then he thought of Sherlock who certainly didn’t seem like a particularly happy person despite his seemingly privileged existence, if anything he seemed a bit lost, and John certainly didn’t envy him when he recalled that large soulless house and Mycroft’s cold glint in his eyes when addressing his brother.
Then, with a forceful blow with the briefcase and a silent prayer that the impact wasn’t going to cause more than a temporary knock-out, John watched the butler go down with a thud on the carpet, at the moment taken out, giving John the opportunity to execute what he had in mind.
Mycroft trusted that he had managed the right amount of condescension. It wouldn’t do to let the opportunity to show his displeasure at his little brother’s deplorable smoking habits slip by, and at the same time he didn’t want to come off as too stern when he knew very well that there were other, far more undesirable habits he brother could have chosen instead. In comparison, a cigarette or two was nothing.
“I’ll allow you your privacy, Mr Magnussen. When you are done, kindly show yourself out. I have other pressing matters to attend to and unfortunately not a lot of time to spare. Good evening.”
But John wasn’t willing to back down.
“Perhaps. But not one word, not even once? Even in private?” John objected, causing Mycroft to narrow his eyes in suspicion.
The impact hitting his body made his hand react out of instinct, his finger pulled the trigger and a shot went off.
John thought of the Victor he had been presented with, the unhinged tone to everything he said and did, and he couldn’t help but snort at the image of Victor dealing with a break-up.
This was really starting to get at his last nerve though.
“...it happened quickly. Just straight through the head. He never even felt any pain, so there is some comfort in that...”
He patted his protruding stomach sheepishly. While John had made the effort to remain more or less fit over the years, Mike Stamford had grown decidedly fat.
“As I thought,” Mycroft muttered, “Two peas in a pod, the pair of you. But I can hardly deny you to give it a try after having proved yourself so capable during all of this.”
He clasped his hands together in front of him but remained with his back against the doctor.
“He has managed to get my number apparently.”
It also stands to reason that the technical part of the surveillance is assigned to others, because even if Mycroft is more brain than human and surely could figure out how to set up equipment himself if necessary, he is also a man who like most men in his position, and very much unlike his younger brother, doesn’t like to get his hands dirty by doing things himself and John simply can’t see Mycroft installing the surveillance equipment on his own.
“I believe I told your driver that I had resigned. That was two days ago. I have not changed my mind since then,” he said, keeping as much distance between himself and Mycroft as he possibly could.
Maybe he had exaggerated a little bit. It had not completely been Sherlock’s fault if Magnussen had decided to put his filthy mind into wandering hands.
Sherlock immediately snapped back.
Being kept prisoner tied up to a bed in the reclusive house of a mad man, his only companion a snake who had just bitten him and thereby signed his own death warrant, no one knowing where he was, probably ending up being one of those mysteries that he himself was so fond of trying to solve. That certainly warranted some self-pity.
“It wasn’t as bad as it sounds. There was no copy of the plans, hence their huge importance. But my brother has been blessed with an eidetic memory, not to mention the fact that he had spent several hours studying these documents until I stole them, so naturally he knew what they looked like. So we decided that instead of coming clean to his superiors, we were going to produce a forgery of the plans and then replace the original version with our fake one. “
“We should switch vehicles. Taking the car to our destination is going to take some time and I have a much faster method of transportation at my disposal, “he said without turning away from the window he had been looking through during the whole journey. He was sitting as far away from Mycroft as possible, although if that was intentional was difficult to say. It felt like it should have been the other way around, with Mycroft shying away from his presence, but Magnussen had apparently beaten him to the punch.
But then he decided to relax and tell himself to stop being so suspicious. Assumingly Victor must have informed the host that he had invited John as a last-minute addition and as he was probably the only unknown guest here it wasn’t too difficult to guess his identity.
“Would seem like it, Mr Magnussen.”
“And what about willing?”
Feeling offended that these two were so determined to throw judgement on him when he had done nothing but improved the situation regarding Magnussen, and such news in reality should be a source of enjoyment, not something to be thrown in his face, Sherlock flailed with his arms in exasperation as he began to pace the room in front of them.
Getting himself home had been a troublesome affair involving taking the tube out to the suburbs to cut the costs of a taxi taking him all the way back to the barracks. But sitting on the tube on a Saturday night dressed in a formal army dress uniform with a bunch of teenagers out on a night of fun, the regular drunkards as well as the odd crazy person who was just out looking for trouble got him in more than one brawl along the way, one of them ending with him throwing a punch followed by the unfortunate sound of nose cartilage breaking and blood spurting all over his clothes.
He continued across the yard when the sound was heard once more, this time coming from his left and as he turned his head in that direction he froze in horror as he saw a hand sticking out between two dumpsters, lifelessly lying on the asphalt.
“But…you have no problem with that?” John asked in sheer disbelief. “Even if he is a terrible person now, he used to be your friend once. Your boyfriend even. It makes you sound so callous when you speak of him like a problem that needs to be disposed of in such a final manner.”
It's of him and Sherlock, standing slightly further apart then what they usually did when posing for pictures. Sherlock in a white crisp shirt, sleeves rolled up, the curls in slight disarray.
“Eidetic memory, John. Nothing of value should ever be kept on anyone’s phone, it’s too easily lost and forever gone even if you take all kinds of precautions to prevent it from happening. Theft, misplacing it, sheer usage, dropping it into the toilet, people tend to lose their phones under all kinds of unfortunate events, so a phone to me is simply a tool that I use when I need it, nothing that I depend on for anything truly important.”
But that was clearly the wrong thing to say, a tone of annoyance colouring Sherlock’s instant reply.
Getting John a position there as well had not been a possibility as the vetting process took years, but Stamford had helpfully told him to apply for other more manual assignments at the same facility in the meantime, just to get started. Mr Holmes was always looking for suitable recruitments and a week later John had found himself sitting across a balding man called Caruthers, repeating everything Stamford had told him to say, ending the meeting by signing the dotted line of his employment contract before he went back to the bedsit, packed his meagre belongings in a bag and moved into the barrack where he now lived.
“No, don’t worry. He’s in town.”
Being his boyfriend meant that I had to accompany him to things I had never before been a part of, like going out, dancing, drinking, socialising. I didn’t particularly like it and I never knew what was expected of me so in the beginning it was quite a struggle.
When Sherlock answered John already knew what he was going to say.
“What do you mean?”
“Did he actually ask for a reward?”
“That’s a bleak way to put it, but yeah, I suppose you’re right, life can be a struggle sometimes,” John agreed as he kept looking at the other man, not sure what to make of him yet.
“I...,” John began, feeling the flustering tone in his voice carry through to his bewildered features.
? That’s a rather loose term, especially coming from someone who prides himself with always being very precise. “
Well, if John was lucky and talented enough to know how to pry some information out of his patient, he might find out soon enough.
Mycroft put his phone back into the pocket of his dressing gown.
“Why the panic? I have a phone, we can call for back-up if we need it. Let them run amok in the house or leave, whatever suits their purpose. We might even use this to our advantage if we want to. Pretty sure Mycroft Holmes' career won’t exactly prosper if word reaches his colleagues that he locked two people up against their will in another man’s house and began to search it for his missing brother, like a raving lunatic. As soon as I found out he had a brother, and especially after meeting said brother myself, I knew Sherlock would prove to be at least someone’s pressure point. Luck really that it turned out he was Mycroft’s.”
And sure enough a loud inhale was soon heard, followed by a cascade of vomiting, not only into the outstretched vase but also all over Mycroft’s pristine slippers, a string of curses hissed out from the older brother’s mouth on account of it, causing John’s lips to twitch in amusement despite the severity of the situation.
And with those parting word he disconnected the call and left his office, heading for a well due conversation with Dr Watson regarding his brother.
“I have some mementos from our time together, also a few pictures on my phone. I’ve been meaning to dispose of them, but I haven’t....well there hasn’t really been any time....”
And as misery finally came, jealousy was not far behind.
He knew that by now Magnussen had been informed about his resignation, otherwise he wouldn’t have called, so he should try to play it cool, but he felt too astonished as well as giddy over how correctly Sherlock had predicted this scenario.
“Dr Watson’s talents are no more remarkable than what any other doctor could offer. For as long as Sherlock’s accepts his services it is all good and well, and if the day comes when those services are no longer in demand, we will simply have to find someone new.”
The woman was like a wall though, impenetrable and not accommodating one bit to his rising fear. Instead she actually looked at him as if she thought he was being a bit hysterical.
“I never asked for your approval, you know.”
“You were involved with that. Was it drugs that time as well?”
“What are
“Would you be able to kill him yourself?” he said in challenge.
The plan was for Mycroft to be so vague about the whole situation that Magnussen would do as Victor had done, minus the gun and the threats of course, and turn to John Watson for answers instead.
He was actually happy for once, happy in a way he hadn’t felt for years, if possibly ever and that feeling of elation he experienced whenever he laid eyes on Sherlock meant more to him than anything else.
“I thought you wanted to listen to my heart and lungs as you actually brought a stethoscope this time? I believe it’s better done without any clothes on” he could hear Sherlock say from the bed, and now he sounded all innocent and oblivious all of a sudden.
Despite his slight frame, Sherlock was considerably taller which made it more difficult for John to carry him. Added with the difficulty of a body gone limp, he wasn’t going to make it all the way to a waiting helicopter, but still he wasn’t prepared to let go.
He had found himself missing John during the day and his thoughts had kept returning to the former army doctor and his meeting with Magnussen.
What was that all about anyway? Was he coming down with something or was it simply a trick of the light? Or had Magnussen been right about him blushing on account of that special someone in the room that managed to put some colour on his cheeks?   The question was who that special someone was of course. Him or Victor?
“Oh God…” John groaned and drew a hand across his face in exasperation. Because only Sherlock would see the benefits of fixing a problem by complicating it even more.
He could se the shadow of his own reflection in the window, as well as the others behind his back. He noticed how Dr Roylott turned his head to look at him for a moment before facing Magnussen again and interrupted the flow of words that came out of the media mogul’s mouth.
His frame suggested that he would probably have done better as a bodyguard instead of sitting with a silly hat, cramped up in the driver’s seat, delivering people back and forth between this place and the house. But John also realised that Mycroft Holmes had a way of making people do things they normally wouldn’t consider and if he wanted this mountain of muscles to be in charge of driving another one of his employees to tend to his precious brother, so be it, no one was going to make a complaint about it.
The man was apparently still practising medicine to some degree in a nearby village, but more sporadically than anything else, and otherwise he seemed to conduct business in London, but what that business consisted of was still unclear.
It’s locked naturally, this is Mycroft’s domain after all, but just as he is about to turn and head back, the door is opened from the inside and a man peaks out.
As he still failed to see anyone, the tension gradually faded and for a second he contemplated the option that he had simply dreamt the whole thing.
As he came close enough he raised his head to look up at the large window where he expected to see Sherlock sitting, waiting for him as he usually did, like he had been doing so many times in the past. Different dressing gown every time, but always that look of anticipation in his eyes.
He realised that living with Sherlock must have rubbed off a little bit, because this was exactly the kind of detail Sherlock’s laser beam eyes would pick up on as well, details that were small and insignificant to most people but told the story of something at odds with how it should be.
“Glad to hear it. It’s just that I don’t really know what you’re talking about!”
His first attempt had been the well-known sexual diversion technique which had arguably been pleasant, and John had indeed seemed sleepy enough afterwards, as content and satisfied as a person thoroughly fucked could possible be. But apparently it had not been enough, and quite to the contrary it had resulted in John becoming even more clingy, insisting they should cuddle afterwards.
So far, the shoe bench seemed to hold up against the onslaught of physical force against the door, most likely from Dr Roylott. John couldn’t really imagine Magnussen doing much physical work to help him out.
“You knew I was going to do it though. You
Mycroft then intently listened to the retelling of the evenings events without saying much, not even when the subject of summoning Sherlock at such a short notice was brought forward.
“What will you tell Magnussen?” he said, in an effort of delaying the doctor in his departure.
When dressed and suitably groomed, he took a cup of strong coffee to steel himself for the veritable onslaught Sherlock might hurl at him when and if they made contact later that day.
“There are other ways to pass the time, more suitable than what you have chosen to do this time. Remember who you belong to, Sherlock. That body is not yours to do whatever you want with.”
“There is nothing more to tell. I have no new results regarding the vault but I’m confident that once I gain access to Appledore, that will change... “
He never threatened me with his knowledge of what I had done because he probably realised that no one would believe him anyway. Nine people out of ten would distrust such a ridiculous story, but when brought to the attention of that tenth individual who actually knows how to deal with that kind of information, it can change everything. And in my case, that person was Charles Magnussen.”
But somehow she had managed to convince herself that John Watson wasn’t a threat to her in the love department, because any day now Sherlock would see her for the person she truly was and reciprocate those delicate feelings she felt for him, like a precious little baby bird she held with quivering hands close to her chest, for everyone to see and pity her for.
Mycroft had always tried to stress the lesson of keeping your emotional distance to others, never get entangled in people’s messy affairs and never bother with forming liaisons based on love or friendship. The cost of getting involved, caring so to speak, was never worth the cost of vulnerability that such a commitment inevitably caused.
“Oh, it most certainly does! Having sex with a patient who I only met once before and who is also, very inconveniently getting married within a few months, that’s all kinds of bad.....I didn’t even complete the examination before we ended up in bed. What would your brother say if he knew about this?”
As the car came to a halt, the woman nimbly got out and left John alone in the backseat for a minute, just taking in the exterior of his surroundings while trying to gather his thoughts around what the hell he was doing here and who it was that had summoned him. He was fairly sure by now that it wasn’t Carruthers.
“And yet I think sleep is just what you need, Doctor,” Mycroft’s voice was heard from somewhere in the background, the man himself no longer fully visible for John to focus on, as if fading into obscurity despite a lamp shining quite strongly in the room.
“But I....” John cut himself off immediately because what he had been about to say could never be expressed in front of Mycroft. Instead he backtracked and tried again. “The track marks on his arms are old.”
“Sherlock never discussed it during one of your visits?” Magnussen almost looked disappointed.
Not that he felt insecure exactly, this was far more his element that Magnussen’s flat and that owner’s doings, but nevertheless, Dr Roylott hade the advantage of being an unknown variable so far. What exactly was it that he wanted?
“I thought it was forbidden for civilians to be given tours of the lab? Red-tape projects and so on, very hush hush, as far as I recall you telling me before I ended up working here.”
, Magnussen dryly noted and then dismissed her by ending the call.
Outside, the storm was increasing in force, and lightning was now crossing the night sky in an intricate pattern while it rumbled ominously in the background. Mycroft felt the familiar uneasiness unfurl inside of him and he felt a strong wish to follow his brother through the library door to wherever he was heading.
“I’m hardly on “his back” as you so eloquently put it. In fact, I think I’m being surprisingly lenient towards him considering the fact that he gets paid to do a job that he can hardly bother to do properly.”
With a last lingering look at the door of the bedroom where Magnussen was by now most likely doing the most vile things imaginable to Sherlock, John opened a door to his right and pushed the unconscious butler inside, then slammed the door shut and turned on his heel and ran straight back to the room where the offensive painting was hanging, tauntingly on display for everyone to see.
Then he turned his back and left, Sherlock standing where he was in the middle of his chaotic room, abandoned to his own devices once more and John couldn’t help but feel for him, stuck in this house like some locked-up pet, seemingly under his brother’s control, waiting to be married off to a man John knew nothing about but who, if Mycroft was to be believed, would continue to keep his future husband under as much scrutiny as Mycroft did right now.
“You’re being paranoid, dear brother....” he began but Sherlock was clearly having none of it, his previously bright expression replaced by a sulky glare and John couldn’t help but wonder about their dynamic. They acted like children in front of him, with no care how that made them look and if he had imagined himself getting some sort of initial positive contact with his patient on their first official meeting, he had clearly miscalculated. Sherlock did not seem like a man who bothered too much with polite interaction.
Sherlock shook his head.
That was one very strong aspect of this situation and if it actually came to that, he didn't know how to survive it.
Naturally Victor had been in touch with Mycroft again, the very next morning, this time phoning instead of showing up at the house, but the result had been more or less the same.
So instead of going to Magnussen’s office where the man was probably busy looming over his staff as these controlling men tended to do, Sherlock decided to take a cab to the address where they had last been together.
Imaginary-John came closer to his face and this time he could sense his own name being called out, but strangely subdued, as if being spoken under water.
And it began to chip away on the happiness he had initially felt and he had to try really hard to not let any of these feelings show when he met Sherlock the next time, not give him any cause to believe that he felt more than what they had agreed upon.
“He became erratic and difficult; we had an argument and he stormed up to his room and locked the door. As he is prone to throwing antics, I decided to leave him to his own devices, thinking that he didn’t seem that affected by dizziness and nausea as he had earlier claimed. Instead I went to my own bedroom and prepared myself for going to bed but no more than 20 minutes went by before a loud crash was heard. I immediately rushed upstairs and there he was, splayed out unconscious on the floor, parts of his chemistry set in pieces around him. He was lucky that nothing was currently cooking in one of the vials or that the Bunsen burner wasn’t turned on. I carried him downstairs and laid him down on the sofa, told my assistant to go get you and here we are, two concerned parties and a drug addict suffering an overdose.”
his fault, but John Watson doesn’t know that and should not be showing up agitated to confront him about anything, the ungrateful little worm.
Sherlock’s nostrils flared but he remained quiet. What he had been about to say remained unspoken, so Mycroft continued instead.
“Cat caught you tongue?” his antagonist purred, his hand straightening his spectacles while looking at John, the satisfaction of victory evident in his features. “Suffice to say, you’ve been caught in a situation far above your meagre level of intelligence and as I mentioned earlier, you and I will have a discussion about actions and consequences soon enough. But as you might realise, my other guest is in dire need of a lesson as well, and he is a rather more pressing matter.... He is so delectably presented for my benefit, it would be rude of me to not favour him above you. Surely you understand my order of priorities....”
And that was the most interesting part.
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes for a second to supress the rising annoyance before he uttered the next words through gritted teeth.
He could feel Mycroft’s penetrating stare and reached for his glass to ask for a refill when his eyes caught Magnussen looking at him as well.
He wasn’t sure he could take a second round of this, to feel his jealousy and resentment tear into him again, make him stay awake at night fretting about what Sherlock was doing with Victor, how the time was ticking away, closing in on the upcoming wedding, and how the situation would change after that. Would Sherlock perhaps try to deceive him again? And would Victor actually put a bullet through his body one of these days?
As he turned to look at them more closely he noticed that they all looked surprisingly generic, as if having taken advice from Mycroft on how to not make too much of an impression, the most remarkable person around the table was without a doubt Sherlock and  the rest made it look like they were trying to blend in with the background.
“I’m sorry but I have made my mind up, I have no intention of returning to care for your brother anymore.”
“I see you met Nagaina. I brought her from India a few years ago, named her after the protagonist in Riki Tiki Tavi. She is just as vicious as her namesake, so no regrets about bringing her here and introducing her to those in need of making her acquaintance.”
He stubbornly ignored Mycroft’s disappointed look.
Knowing that Sherlock had no interest in art, and even less so in dramatic literature from the Elizabethan era, it was a sure sign that Sherlock must have succumbed to playing the part according to Mycroft’s directions. If Magnussen had a wish to walk the gallery with his newfound companion, Sherlock must have agreed to do so. He would most likely complain about it to Mycroft later.
But there was actually some comfort in the knowledge that no one would ever again look at that despicable picture. And the hiding place behind it, surely one of these men would realise the significance of that discovery and be able to open up that secret passage now that he had revealed its location?
John pointed at the cameras situated on each side of the gate.
Secondly, for you to even mention Mycroft while trying to seduce me, let me tell you, it is the biggest turn-off I’ve ever experienced.
“True. But considering that Purcell’s suicide has officially been written off as a cardiac arrest and no move from us has been made towards Magnussen since it happened, he has no reason to suspect that I feel anything beyond my usual politeness for him. We are hardly well-acquainted, we know of each other and meet occasionally, that is all. There is no reason for him to think that anything has changed in that regard.”
“....Yes?” he said, not able to hide his surprise.
At first he couldn’t fathom what it was that his eyes were seeing.
John sighed and pinched his nose in exasperation. He sometimes wondered how Mycroft had survived a childhood that consisted of this, 24 hours a day. Then he pictured what Mycroft must actually have been as a child and realised that it was difficult to say who had suffered the most.
Sherlock let out a tired sight.
Sherlock gave him a weak smile.
The hands Dr Roylott had been keeping hidden behind his back now came forth, holding a small burlap sack as well as stick with a noose at the end of it.
And thankfully he didn’t get a reply, no meaningless words of comfort, no looks of commiseration.  There was nothing to be said.
Hell, what he had been through for the past couple of years, chasing the adrenaline high of a life of danger and peril as if his life depended on it. Because hadn’t there always been that element of adventure that tickled his senses, made him rush head first into action? So why stop now when things were truly turning dark and twisted?
That was only with you. It seems I’m not explaining myself very well. What I meant to say was that I had a plan for every doctor that Mycroft hired to look out for me, different plans for different individuals, and before you do decide to give me one of those forceful slaps you seem to hand out so easily, let me emphasize once again that you were the only one I ever slept with.”
He was taken on a ride through the countryside, a ride which soon lulled him back to sleep. It had ended when he woke the next time, the car parked on a deserted parking lot in front of a tall grey office building that housed no other occupants, merely empty rooms and endless corridors.
Magnussen wanted Sherlock badly, but he wasn’t stupid enough to think that it might happen without a little incentive. The question was really how far he could take it?
“She seldom disappoints when it comes to doing what is required of her, and most victims, like yourself, Mr Holmes, so helpfully provide me with evidence in the form of a scream to let me know when the deed had been done.”
“Look, Sherlock. I have a conference call with Charles Magnussen and his lackeys in less than an hour, I need to prepare myself for that. The prime minister is expecting results by the end of the week and that despicable man just doesn’t know how to compromise, so I need to be at my best game.”
Sherlock had seen glimpses of his temper on that first occasion back at Magnussen’s flat, but now there was a tension in him that was tangible and should have made Sherlock weary of stepping inside this monstrosity of a house, the waft of Victoriana all over it, the creepy old manor long forgotten in the middle of nowhere.
schedule to tend to your other duties. Stark contrast indeed, being a doctor one day, working a factory floor the next.”
Mycroft frowned at this reaction and walked over to the table where he had a water bottle and a larger towel waiting for him. Normally he would have been on his way to the shower by now, but he was hardly going to undress while his brother was leaning against the door frame nonchalantly, hands in his pockets of the same suit he had been dressed in last night. He must have opted to go straight here after finishing with Magnussen, without stopping by Baker Street first.  Unfortunately, as so often was the case with his brother, Sherlock was trying to act coy, as he always tended to do when he possessed information he knew that Mycroft wanted.
How Sherlock had ever managed to stomach the company of this whiny idiot was beyond him, it said something about his brother’s adaptable patience, a part of Sherlock’s personality that Mycroft normally considered to be non-existent.
He was alone and he was slightly exhausted from the lack of sleep last night, as well as the tension from earlier today. There was no harm in indulging in some innocent fantasies, as long as he knew what boundaries to uphold during the times he actually met with Sherlock and remembered that he was hired to do a job, nothing else.
So what was taking Sherlock this long?
“The omnipotent Mycroft Holmes clueless for once? If the general public just knew of your existence and were capable of realising the significance of such news, I would be tempted put it as a headline in one of my papers.”’
Their eyes locked, Mycroft trying to figure out if his brother was having him on or if he had actually gone against his very firm instructions and taken the drug instead of playacting like they had agreed upon.
“I’m pretty sure you’re not missing his presence either.”
As he languidly stroked himself to the memory of Sherlock’s tight trousers clinging to his pert behind as he had walked up the stairs, John hoped that he would be able to keep that promise and avoid getting himself involved too much.
The doctor was predictably easy to read and would be very upset by such images as well as the deceit they implied.
There was also the telling, if slightly unpleasant sign that while in the men’s room, he had overheard two men talking about his brother in a rather lewd way and mentioned that he had been seen in Magnussen’s company in the gallery, watching the Shakespearean motifs that adorned the ceiling.
Speaking of bedrooms...
“No you wouldn’t as you constantly make sure that they resign before being able to prove their worth. And don’t think I won’t replace this one with a name from my own personal list of appropriate candidates to baby sit you until you walk down that aisle and take your vows, if you manage to drive him away.”
“Well, it is a complicated affair....”
Behind him, in a far more dignified pace, nowhere near as swiftly and energetically as his brother, came Mycroft, confident in his steps but certainly in no hurry.
In one of the larger rooms a strange rotating device consisting of four men playing instruments within a glass casing caught his eye and in another one he noticed a whole wall covered with a painting what depicted the very disturbing image of a naked man being eaten by horses while two other men in red and white robes looked on with condemning faces and John couldn’t help but wonder, with every passing room he made it through, what sort of person this home could possibly belong to. There was a fine line between luxurious and straight out bizarre with every step he took.
John interrupted his fervent search by quite firmly ordering him to obey.
Unable to figure out what could have disturbed his sleep, he let it go while his eyes adjusted to the soft light in of the room that came from the lamp on Sherlock’s desk that he had left on.
And with those words he whipped his phone out and dialled as he walked towards the window.
Less than five minutes after his arrival, the sound of steps approaching was heard outside and then the door silently opened to reveal the figure of Magnussen in the doorway, his spectacles gleaming in the dim light, his tall figure throwing a large shadow across the floor, making him seem even more menacing than normally.
He is sitting in a chair in the back of one of the surveillance rooms that Mycroft has at his disposal and watches five mean go through endless footage from every angle of every possible location available and yet coming up with nothing so far.
“Oh so there is actually some truth to the rumour then?"
John ventured to shake his head at that.
If he was going to do this, he was in a dire need of something invigorating from one of the decanters on his drinks trolley despite the early hour.
“If you would be so kind as to allow Mr Magnussen to make the call, Dr Watson, it would be much appreciated. We are wasting precious time standing out here arguing when we could be inside talking to the man of the house instead.”
“Keep your phone ready, however finds him first or ends up in trouble needs to reach out. I have my gun but...”
“You’re forgetting that he has to keep in mind that you are
John stared at Mycroft, at the neatly set table, the teacups and the delectable Victoria sponge cake with strawberry jam in a jar on the side.
No wonder Jeremy Marcus became spell-bound if this is what he was forced to look at day in and day out.
I ransacked the whole apartment to no avail and feared that I might have taken them with me while out arranging for my next fix. The problem was that I had no recollection of where I had been and I was unable to backtrack my steps from the previous night. I didn’t even remember the theft itself or how I got from London back to Cambridge. So by evening I had to accept defeat and realise that I had no idea of how to retrieve the stolen plans and there was no other choice but to come clean to Mycroft.”
“What has his doctor to say about it?” he asked and actually turned his head to take a closer look at Mycroft now.
This was probably where Magnussen fit in and considering the media man’s scruples, what Sherlock had told Mycroft about Dr Roylott when meeting him for the first time, as well as being very difficult to pinpoint to any obvious trade, it seemed likely that he made a living from something on the shadier side of the law. And that was naturally enough of an incentive to wet Sherlock’s appetite and Mycroft could easily see how his brother would have been tempted to take a closer look at the affairs of this strange man.
As far as it went case-wise, it was a pretty straight forward affair. In fact, calling it a case would actually be stretching the truth a little bit, it was more like a ruse, an under-cover operation that would not require much work at all from any of them.
