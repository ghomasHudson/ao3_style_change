No. None of that nonsense. Mourning would do no good in the next steps that faced him. He needed to jump into action; he would need to ensure that the news would impact Sherlock as little as possible. He needed to control the situation.
Finally, I'm still laughing at the fact that John couldn't "think straight" when Sherlock was pressed against him lol.
- that he was repressing a smile. “Very funny. But that third one does not qualify and I would argue the first was also unsatisfactory. After all, I deduced your competitiveness ages ago.”
“Hey, can I cut your sleeve off?” he asked, looking anywhere but his eyes. They were the deepest oceans and John was ready to be crushed under their pressure.
“Here you go,” John said, extending the paper to Sherlock enthusiastically. “All the information you need is on there. But listen, I gotta hit the road.”
“Right, guys? What do we think? We want to invite Sherlock for our next gig? We’ll get better tips for sure.”
“Not now,” he screamed back before joining the jukebox for a rousing three performances of Dancing Queen. Lestrade joined in, singing off-key and gesturing passionately toward Sherlock while he danced around the mostly-abandoned pub.
He said it with a nonchalant finality, as though he’d simply relayed the score of a game John had missed the night before. John’s stomach dropped into a tight ball deep within him, his smirk instantly fading to give way to regret. He shouldn’t have challenged him. Greg remained unconcerned but John swore he saw the slightest tightening of his lips before he brought the glass to his lips.
There was no way around it, no way to continue in silence. He was spiralling, spiralling, spiralling.
John, panting from shock against the cubicle’s edge, didn’t notice Sherlock’s own pacing. When he had held Moriarty captive to allow Sherlock the chance to run, that was the first time it truly struck Sherlock that he didn’t have an accurate read on John.
“He’s exaggerating, of course,” Sherlock chimed in. “Unless, of course, 11% is now a ‘super successful’ rate.”
“It’s your turn,” Sherlock mumbled in a nearly indiscernible way. He made one feeble attempt to sit up but seemed to have lost control over his limbs.
“You didn’t hurt me.” His eyes were knives into John, unwavering, unblinking. John had been expecting an elaboration, but none came.
A series of tremors flooded his body. This wasn’t real. Only an hour ago, he was taking in every minuscule detail of John’s resting face after a perfect night. Only an hour ago, he was committing to memory what John looked like sleeping after a night of desperate fucking. Only an hour ago, everything was exactly what Sherlock had always dreamed.
Sherlock huffed, a fierce denial settling over him. Mrs. Hudson's upturned lip, raised eyebrows, and cheery demeanour screamed her thoughts and he wished to be deaf to them.
It could have been seconds or hours before they broke apart, but it did not matter in the slightest. When their lips parted, their foreheads were pressed together, a gleam of sweat slipping along another and their breath entwining between them.
On the stage was a grand piano as nice as John had ever seen, a beautiful, shining microphone, a shining drum set for Wiggins, and clear places for the rest to settle into.
“You dangerous, clever man,” John said through a tight smirk. Sherlock was leaning back in his chair, his legs extending for miles to the floor while John’s own legs needed to rest on the tall chair’s wooden bar. And in Sherlock’s hooded, mischievous eyes, John found the deserved shame he should have felt from the beginning of their evening.
God, John would rather be anywhere in the world than this damned room. Beige walls were illuminated with dreary fluorescents, the isolated silence vibrating with the raucous crowd around him. The contrast of the excited energy outside and lifeless despair inside was startling.
But the more people disliked him for being so brilliant, the more he needed to control their dislike. He tried holding it in, but it oozed from him without control. He couldn’t stop it- the deductions. They were part of him, arriving to betray him because he sincerely couldn’t tell what was common sense and what was a “deduction.”
that John liked what he saw. He felt ashamed of his open staring and desperately wanted to avoid contact with him.
Greg was a blur of motion on his bass, his tempo immaculate as his dark beat stirred the rich undertones of their music.
He smiled slyly, an ambiguous look that lent him a cool air of mystery. Then, so easily it felt foreign to him, he said: “Only if you’ll join me to drink it.”
“Er- Jazz,” he said when Sherlock didn't meet his eyes. “For a contest. If we win, we'll get to be in the movies.”
See, Private Lestrade- or, “Greg”, as he’d insisted Philip call him in private- was not just gorgeous, charming, and hilarious, but also damned flirty to a dangerous extent. Brutal nights on the frozen ground, covered with nothing but a thin, patched, military-issued blanket were made marginally better when Greg would offer up his own blanket to sooth Philip’s shaking body.
Sherlock was silent, words visibly churning. He drummed his fingers for a moment before reaching for another shot and drinking the amber whiskey to fuel his thought. John, relieved, followed suit.
At first, their friendship had been nearly as good as actually being with John. This was not the case in those rooms which took place after Sherlock’s return from the dead. Their relationship was strained, complicated, and desperately falling apart over time.
With three minutes to spare, the lot was gathered around in a familiar formation, instruments either in hand or beneath awaiting fingers. They warmed up to the notes of John’s grand piano, his fingers flexing and curling in between notes to prepare for limber motion. They tuned in unison, the horns blaring and Greg’s bass reverberating around the hollow rehearsal space.
It was always the silence that broke Sherlock most. In John’s silence, there was the incessant, foolish hope. In the silence, he could imagine he felt John’s body fight itself from entering an embrace that would knock down the wall between them once and for all. In the silence, the world would move in slow motion as John’s eyes flicked to his lips and, in that sole moment, in the silence, there was yearning for his touch more than he could bear it.
“It was ‘43, actually,” corrected Philip with something that almost resembled a smile. “This is John Watson, the man I was telling you about. John, this is Gregory Lestrade.”
Mycroft, the Iceman, hates Christmas. He hates "family time." He hates how insufferable Sherlock and John are since they got together.
They looked at one another for a long moment, John unable to resist fidgeting with his lips with his teeth. Sherlock appeared to be internally struggling, his eyes moving rapidly between John’s two.
John called for the visitor to “come in” with his inflexion bending up at the end to turn his instruction into a question.
He walked toward the dusty grand piano that took up the better half of his living room. It’d gone unplayed for so long, he felt a pang of guilt when he slid onto the smooth, glossy bench. A warmth filled him, glowing from his fingertips that were ghosting across abandoned keys to his toes as they teased the edges of the metallic petals.
“I know, I know,” groaned Philip. “Trust me, I know. You can blame Greg for that, he distracted me.”
It felt ages before his friend returned. Sherlock finished his drink, the buzz in his head leaning away from tipsy and traveling closer to drunk. He slouched against the booth, his body refusing to maintain any notion of formality.
Jackson rolled his eyes and put his hand up to stop John’s pleading. “Watson, we just got a new headliner. The gals just love him, they call him “Babyface.” See, he’s eighteen and draws in the crowd- and what a crowd it is!”
The two were sharing the seat, a mess of limbs entwined in this small, intimate space. Sherlock tightened his embrace around John’s chest, his face nuzzling violently into the wool of his jumper.
“John,” muttered Sherlock. Panic rose within him because the word was not one of ecstasy, but one of hesitation.
John was across the room with the steadiness he associated with the soldier and leaned over the edge of Sherlock’s seat to connect their lips with a glorious burst of colour. It was blinding in its intensity and he was filled with a white-hot passion, a pure white clarity, and he wove a white flag of surrender to succumb to his deepest desires.
A huddled mass curling in on itself, cowering from the physically dominant John. Two pairs of hands grabbing him to forcibly pull him away.
One more! But we're out of band members! Who will it be the featured POV for our last day? You're all bright, I'm sure you have a hunch.
Sherlock put every effort into not letting the words impact him. However, try as he might, it was no use. The words sunk deep within him, compassion and joy growing in his heart at the words.
The green room was vibrating with the band before them while the young man gave them their instructions for how and when to walk on stage. When they were left alone at last, Sholto removed his trombone with care.
The few seconds that passed between them in silence were millennia to John. The realization was a slap of bitter truth and it spread mortification through his entire being.
He turned to her, keeping his face completely neutral, perhaps a bit perplexed and waiting the smallest of seconds before pretending that realization was dawning on him.
” with two haphazardly boxes beneath the question. He had been able to successfully (and truthfully) check the box that said “no.”
729 hours without John. 43,742 seconds without him. Roughly 30 days without the warmth and constancy of his friendship.
Through his furious disbelief at Sherlock, he saw something fade in Mary’s eyes. Whether it was the fact that this strange man had ruined the mood or that the frozen surprise had sobered her up a bit as it had John, she looked distinctly cold.
“So to make a living, he’s been forced to the street as a middle-man to deliver drugs to addicts in need of a fix. It’s as much of an honest living as he can get and he must look the part, so he wears what he wears. He, himself, is sober- not even a drop of alcohol in him.”
“I’m sorry,” floated his brother’s voice to his unreceptive ears before he heard to knob turn, footsteps retreat, and the door click closed behind him.
The words were a bullet to his unexpecting ears. They were precious syllables he'd waited lifetimes to hear. John’s eyes flew to Sherlock’s, an enormous love filling his heart until he was more than certain that he would explode from it.
“A romantic mood?” John stared blankly at the man, shy and timid before him. His feet were shuffling half-mindedly, his mouth forming a tight line, his hands moving in peculiar ways, and John was reaching the conclusion slowly. The idea started as a pin-point, growing like a rolling snowball with every piece of evidence John supplied to it.
Instead, he stared blankly across the table, a nervous laugh bubbling from him without a smile. “Can I ask you s-something?”
“And which adventures would those be? The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes? Don’t be so saccharine, Mrs. Hudson.”
- he wanted to talk about Victor. Of course that’s what he wanted to talk about. Of course that’s the reason he was drawn to spending time with John at all. Of course.
It wasn’t possible for John’s smile to widen, though it certainly was trying. “I’d love that. You free now?”
It was so much easier to lean into it. Be “that asshole” who makes deductions. That “freak” who nobody likes. That way, he controlled it. That way, he would never be disappointed by the fact that he couldn’t obtain a friend for the life of him.
Philip had been seventeen years old when it first occurred to him that he didn’t like girls. He recalled the moment in vivid detail, the moment his entire world was shattered beneath him in a kaleidoscope of scintillating colour:
The band finished playing then, a lull of uncomfortable quiet shuffling as they made way for the next and final band who would, hopefully, be better than their predecessors.
The simultaneous glance that John and Greg gave one another accompanied by John’s stuttering excuse to walk away left a pit of guilt in Sherlock’s stomach. The two joined the others and Sherlock was alone, guilty, and uncomfortable. He’d never been one for groups of people.
He possessed all the qualities of a person who should have been damned unbearable and yet the man drew affection with an ease that was frankly infuriating.
“Oh, you mean of the night I confided in you?” He said it with a raised eyebrow, his voice still dripping with defensive sarcasm.
“And our local band that will be heading to London to perform their tunes for the chance to appear in movies and so much more is…
Surprise! This chapter is based on two songs from Bandstand. The first being, obviously, Love Will Come And Find Me Again, which you can find on Spotify
She froze for the slightest of seconds before her motions resumed slower than before. Her eyes darted briefly to him, though her voice remained steady when she said, “You know, that’s the first time you’ve said his name without flinching since... Well, you know...”
And he felt a proper idiot to have thought anything resembling a friendship could have been blooming outside of their common connection in Victor.
She shrugged, eyes sweeping around the bar before landing upon John’s. “I try not to think about it. But I have to say, I am mighty pleased to see you here.”
Their eyes were still on one another, their hands placed on their bodies, their physical proximity entwined and about to be so in one additional way.
“He’s correct,” whispered Sherlock, his eyes remaining on John, though he addressed everyone. “Winning is why we’re here. It’s not why we stayed. There is not one person here whose life has not improved because of this band.”
Sherlock had never been happier nor more in pain. For what on this damned Earth was he to do? Profess his love? Ask him on a date? Discuss their situation? How would any of that work? Sherlock, with his inability to share any truth and John with his?
Humiliation flooded through him. He shuffled on his feet and looked down at the rug beneath his feet just to have something to focus on that wasn’t Sherlock’s indifferent form dancing around the kitchen.
he reached his conclusions. But he wanted to make this boy- this kind boy- even happier so he attempted to reach through his racing thoughts and grab the one that reasoned why it was a brother.
Sherlock’s eyes were narrowed in his direction and his silence grew uncomfortable as he seemed to be deciding whether or not to answer that. When John was convinced they were doomed to spend the rest of the evening in silence, Sherlock swept his drink into his hand and drank the remaining liquid- more than half the glass- with an impressive chug.
John’s heart was threatening to flip its way out of his body. “That was astonishing. Bloody impossible. You can’t have known all that and yet… You did. Holy shit. Who- How did you do that?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at the man. He was clearly upset that Sherlock was refusing. But why? He knew why Lestrade was upset about his personal life- could read it in his shaving pattern and the state of his cufflinks. But why would he be upset about his refusal to join him in a drink? It had never bothered him before.
“Er- yeah, come on in,” John muttered, closing the door behind him and panicking about the state of the place. Stray books littered every visible seating option, his throw blanket in an array over its chair, the singular light source now seeming small and lacklustre in the presence of such a shining personality. It wasn’t messy- he was an army man, after all- but it was a bit cluttered, a bit demonstrative of his way of life. He found himself embarrassed by it, wishing he could boast a more impressive living arrangement. “What are you doing here-”
He wanted to scream. He wanted to wail and pound his fists against the wall. He wanted to suppress the truth so far deep inside of himself that it would never desire to see the light of day. He wanted to be the person he pretended to be.
The primary source of light, however, was not from any of these. The room was lit with what must have been hundreds of flames, each connected to the wick of different sized candle. They cast dancing shadows around the room, their heat washing over them both in fierce waves.
John, the sun and Sherlock, the moon, desperately reflecting whatever amount of light he could manage.
“The band. Our band. It’s good,” he said simply, and that was the end of that. “Who’s your friend over there?”
“Just go with it,” he said, words coming out as though they were long-time friends and they were discussing the attributes of something especially mundane. His eyes remained glued to the menu, his lanky fingers flipping the thing over with a casual air.
He was correct. The whole body beneath him was shifting with desire. When his tongue dragged slowly along the head for good effect, Sherlock’s legs tensed and he whimpered-
“And seeing the other men suffer? Greg’s necessity to drink to simply make it through the way? Philip’s obsession with control? Wiggins’ debilitating brain damage? These reminders of the war and its impact don’t haunt you?”
“I am honoured to be in the presence of such a noble man. Though you should know… I couldn’t bear your loss, John. I’d rather die myself.”
He’d known it from the moment he’d met John that they were two birds of a feather. He’d never been able to confide in anyone, never thought he’d be so lucky as to stumble across someone like himself, someone bound by the cruel vines of fate to never be capable of sharing what lay in his heart.
It was the sort of place where nasty secrets lay beneath a moss-laden log, the innocent cover giving way to vile, swarming vermin. Naturally distrustful of outsiders, the too-polite behaviour displayed toward Sherlock was proving a challenging obstacle to overcome. How could he infiltrate the minds of these locals if they would not permit a glance into their way of life?
John fixed him with a stare that he hoped would do all the talking for him. It was a look that said “you know I need more than that.” Several seconds were spent like this, each challenging the other to concede.
John’s furious eyes met his tear-rimmed eyes for a long moment before softening significantly. “The second part, you dick.” A sobbing laugh left Sherlock, though John broke his gaze away from him and continued speaking before he could respond. “The throes of losing you were nearly more than I was capable of handling, Sherlock. Don’t you ever say that you might as well be- Don’t say that you should-” his words cut off with an untold emotion, his clenching hands revealing his internal struggle.
At a total loss of words, John busied himself with drinking the beer before him. This man. This madman-
“It can wait a bit. Sherlock, you and I- in this moment- are just one second. But we have a million more seconds, a million days, a million years, and a million miles to go.”
Somewhere, deep within himself, he thought John loved him. Sherlock now hated this part of himself for raising his hopes so thoroughly.
Instead, he pulled himself up, heaved a breath of frozen city air, and forced himself onward through the onslaught of pain. Ever the soldier, ever the war-induced clarity of action.
His phone buzzed in his hand, the cursed device bringing no information of importance to him in several days. The phone displayed 7:03 A.M. and one unread message from the clueless Detective Inspector.
It was possibly the longest John could ever hope for this group to remain quiet. The thought would have put a smile on his face under any other circumstances.
He drew himself a bath and bothered with no luxuries- bubbles, salts, and the ilk. He sank in the water, closing his eyes and feeling the pressure on every inch of his skin. It was warm, welcoming. The still water left him feeling suspended in the air, it lifted him away.
“And- and- you didn’t work with- Victor?” His name was fire in his throat, a painful but necessary question ripping his heart even as he asked.
She shrugged, picking up a few old newspapers off of the sitting room table. “You just deserve a break from staying home with me every day. It’s good to see you so excited about something.”
“I told you, John." His words were cold and distant. Mechanical. “There was mistletoe. We were undercover, it needed to look convincing.”
How could he possibly honour his friend’s dying wish? How could he bring himself to face his wife, to relay his message of undying love, to offer support for her when he couldn’t even support the weight of his own memories? Somewhere in Cardiff, his widow mourned without the knowledge that her hatred for John should run fiery in her veins.
Thank you all for reading and thank you to everyone who left a comment and inspired me to write this sequel. If you are reading this, know that I appreciate you immensely.
“What else?” he croaked because his voice was uselessly out of his control. He desperately needed the subject to change. Immediately. “What else are you scared of?”
“She said ‘he’s no longer around.’ That terminology, John. It’s something divorced or widowed people say. It implies he’s gone permanently. Now tell me, why would a woman whose husband has been missing less than a month and has, in no capacity, been presumed or declared dead use that verbiage? Especially someone who clearly craves attention so badly: what could garner more attention than a missing husband? A dead husband would accumulate sympathy, certainly. But it also calls for distance from those around you. A missing husband? It’s drama and attention that could be dragged on for months, years even.”
Turning off the lights and grabbing the remote, John walked over to the couch and saw, in the dim light of opening sequence, that Sherlock was limiting his seating options. He sat criss-cross applesauce on the centre cushion, his knees spilling over the seam of the other two cushions.
Please let me know if there is an element of this chapter that is confusing. I believe it makes sense, but I know everything about this universe so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
In his entire life, Mycroft had never seen such raw, feral, unabashed humanity. Never before had he seen loss wrack a body until there was no reason, no thought, no glimpse of joy at all, his body and mind instead succumbing to unrestrained sorrow.
” he shouted, voice cracking with emotion. He swung his closed fist furiously against the wood of his headboard. He cradled his hand against his chest and leaned his forehead against that cold, hard wood. It spread a grateful shiver along his spine and he closed his eyes, fight back a wave of an emotion worse than anger.
Yes, John was definitely sitting up straighter- and smiling. Smiling from ear to ear. Smiling in an unnatural manner and God, he needed to reel in the smiling. He forced his cheeks to relax, the very short seconds of silence felt like years and years and why wasn’t he saying
John would have moved on. Then again, it wasn’t that Sherlock had never considered the possibility. It was that Sherlock had never thought John would move on so wholly. Never did the thought occur to him that he would move on with another whom would be so important, John would be unwilling to leave them when Sherlock returned.
“Well you know,” he said with a shrug. “What with John and your newfound attitude, I thought you’d maybe at least consider the proposal.”
“Brilliant,” he said in a low undertone. “See? Now I’m forced to attack some other way.” With long fingers, he moved his knight to a position that didn’t immediately make sense to John. Though to be fair, his mind wasn’t properly functioning.
Sherlock smiled with only half-forced sincerity and answered, “You were there, Gregory. John invited me.”
“What’s her name?” John asked, imagining what the Trevor household must be like outside the tragedy of war.
This was the darkest room of the wing, a room he fled to when his heart was so miserable with the weight of love that it threatened to drag him down to his depths, to drown him.
Greg drank the rest of his whiskey in one quick gulp. John provided him with a sideways glance but said nothing. Then he picked up another, fresh drink and downed that one the same way.
When he reached the head with his tongue, a long, low moan came out of Sherlock and his hands rose to run through John’s hair. He flicked his tongue one- two- three times along the head in a way he
Recalling Victor was as painful now as it had been the night he died. John lost many friends in that war and but Victor was no friend. He had been his best friend- his brother. Through it all- the endless days in battle, the painful treks through the tropics, the neverending heat- Victor had been a beacon toward life and perseverance. When he died, John had no hope to hold onto and only survived the remainder of the conflict because he’d made a vow to Victor that he would deliver his letter to Sherlock, who John had incorrectly assumed was his wife.
“I will never venture away from your love, Sherlock. You are my sun and I am planet revolving around you. I depend on your pull, your warmth, your shining brilliance.”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide with surprise and the faintest of colours rose to those angular cheeks. “Thank you.”
He had it all wrong, it seemed. John’s habits and activities could be read as clearly as a poem, though his heart was a mystery to him. John was a fossil whos lines could provide information scientifically yet provide no information on the sort of love it held.
He heaved a sigh, clicking shut his case. “He’s a bass player. He was in the Army with me and he’s a better bassist than anybody when he’s not drunk- or high.”
White is the colour of light, innocence, and safety. White is a complete reflection, the inability to absorb colour at all. It is a mirror of brilliance, symbolic of fresh beginnings, goodness, and purity. The colour white is unable to be used for cover because it is blinding in its brilliance.
“Wow, indeed,” Sherlock said, punctuated with a smooth, flinch-free consumption of his fifth and final shot that John mirrored with a goofy grin he couldn’t fight away. “Now I can ask you a question, yeah?”
And between those seven wildly different men, after a day where they’d experienced the full range of human emotion, they felt not the anxiety of waiting, not the high of performing, not the joy of winning, and not the sorrow of dreams crushed, but something more powerful than anything: they felt hope.
“Deductions,” he said finally, seeming to judge John worthy of knowing him in return. “That’s all they are. I see you and see a musician and insomniac. I can know you are haunted by the war, your childhood was less than perfect, your brother isn’t talking to you, and you’re overdue for a dental appointment.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed, and in his name there was a horror beyond recognition, his eyes gleaming with a hint of understanding.
John’s tears were always hard-earned. They were not easy to draw out and he could count on one hand the times they flowed freely in recent memory. It seemed that Sherlock was involved in all the instances. Yet now- fresh from an unstoppable wave, they threatened him again at the injustice of the story Sherlock and John shared.
Perhaps this is what he should have said. Perhaps that is even what he should say now. Perhaps he should explain that while John thought him dead for two years, Sherlock had endured torture and sorrow beyond capacity but had survived it all by recalling John’s existence. He continually reminded himself to survive for John, stay alive to see John, return to London to reunite with John.
For a long moment, Sherlock stared at the small bundle of fabric in his hands. The socks were ordained with smiling penguins, one tobogganing happily across a frozen lake. “And you,” Sherlock said softly, “think these are cute?”
“Slight tan lines around his ring finger, John, but upheld. The ring is on during the day but not at night. He keeps it on his person as evidenced by the slight bump in his chest pocket in the event he needs to put it on with a moment’s notice. The discolouration of his face could be a genetic result, but the tan smudge on his collar suggests makeup is the source. Finally, his clothes are too big for him while he remains otherwise effortlessly groomed. He is stylish yet his clothes are big- recent weight loss.”
, exactly,” he managed to stammer out. When he received nothing more than a politely curious rotation of his head in response, he continued, “I don’t
Yet the teacher said nothing in regards to the new boy’s entrance nor in response to the open mockery that was occurring. Typical.
Their evenings together were nothing short of domestic perfection since they'd grown used to one another's routines and behaviours. John, so frequently prone to outbursts of anger, seemed generally calmer in these hours. In the dim twilight's illumination, his muscles would relax, his guard fall down. These were the moments of innocent touches- brushings of his hand along a small expanse of Sherlock’s shoulder blades as he slipped behind him in the kitchen or gentle brushes of their knees as they sat in silence together on the couch. These touches were electricity in his heart, fire in his blood. It took nearly everything in him not to tense up at the contact, though he couldn’t always help it. He gazed on John as though he were the sun- which, of course, Sherlock thought he was.
His heart was thumping out of his chest, the pressure settling with discomfort over his chest. He placed one foot in front of the other in his distant motion forward, a bit too aware of four bewildered stares as he crossed into their circle of familiarity.
Blinding rage. White-hot fury. Conscious thought wiped out in favor of allowing misdirected violence long bred into his instincts.
It was a contradiction with no end. On one hand, Sherlock was cold and cruel, vicious and unmistakably flippant with the emotions of others. On the other hand, Sherlock was wounded and secretive, his actions seemingly at odds with whatever emotions (if any) he experienced.
“That’s what we deserve, isn’t it?” John choked out, looking up for only a second to see Tobias’ lip harden and Greg’s eyes heartbreakingly crestfallen. “I don’t know about you, but I have seen too much of hell. After bunks on cargo ships? After trenches in the rain? After personal injuries? After watching my brother die? After running for cover and dodging death? After fighting for four goddamn years and losing my faith in any God?”
John laughed, imagining the screeching that would incur if he attempted to sing this particular piece. “Yeah, of course it’ll be Sherlock.”
“That, er- thing that you... er- that you did… that, um…” he stumbled out the words like they were the first to ever fall from his mouth. He cleared his throat to start over. “I mean to say, you offering your life to save mine?”
Sholto’s attention suddenly honed in on John with an intensity that floored him, even shaking his sturdy confidence. “You must promise me,” he said sternly, “that this band will be what you told Gregson it will be. You are right, we all need this. It would be unscrupulous to obtain my trombone with the promises of brotherhood and purpose if you cannot keep said promises.”
“Your eyes opened to stare into my eyes under thick eyelashes. That moment lasted for so long- the two of us connected in the snowfall.”
Sholto ushered John into his home and offered him a cup of freshly brewed tea. Politely declining, he took in the state of the house he was in. Primarily white with accent colours of blue and grey, every single last item in the house was in its place. Every book on the massive shelves was organized and labelled like it was its own small library. Every utensil in the kitchen was placed in order of purpose and size. Every blanket was folded, every pillow fluffed and placed in rigid position. There was not a trace of dust in the whole place, the sinks even remaining clear of any build up.
He waited until their first break and counted slowly to ten before rising and crossing over to the boy’s desk where he remained seated as their classmates shuffled off to enjoy the intermission.
It was better than he ever could have hoped. John noticed when no one else ever had. Could it be because John, unlike everyone else, had reason to suspect?
Yet here he was: in a gay bar, skin vibrating with the bass of the music, and wearing far too much leather. His two measly drinks were warm in his stomach but not powerful enough to elevate his eagerness to converse with these young, energetic strangers. There was nothing wrong with the crowd. It just didn't feel like he'd imagined.
“He could be mean, he could run away, or he could be untrustworthy. That would be unfortunate. But what if he is kind? What if he makes me laugh and makes me come out of the shell I’ve carefully orchestrated? I wouldn’t even know what to do with that.”
It wasn’t that Sherlock was wrong about John’s feelings- it was that he waited too long. He was gone too long, the expanse of time allowing John to move on.
“Did you-” his voice broke just slightly and he cleared his throat to try again. “Did you tell all these people that I liked fuzzy socks?”
He was shrouded in mystery, this Sherlock. He was unpredictable and gorgeous and absolutely insane and John wanted to know everything about him from his family to his favourite food to deepest workings of his mind. John could not recall ever being so intrigued in his life. It was like a magnetic pull that John couldn’t struggle against.
“Hey, hey,” he said, gently rubbing his back in circles but not breaking apart from the embrace. “What’s going on, my dear?”
The night Sherlock had just endured had been a proper disaster. He’d been overjoyed when John’s eyes had done exactly what he’d anticipated: slid over Sherlock initially before recognition passed over his face. Everything after…
Silence. Months and years of silence. Sherlock’s eyes left John, falling upon his own hands on the table.
“Thank you,” Sherlock whispered, still so close to John yet so far from where he should be. “I love them.”
“You keep horrible experiments in the fridge without labelling them.” This time, it was John who took another step forward, his bag sliding seamlessly off of his shoulder without a sound.
The words died on their way out, getting lost somewhere along their path as John took in, quite literally, the most handsome man he’d ever seen in his life. Irridesent, wide eyes that shared the same colour scheme as the ocean stared at him through unblinking lids that were host to a brush of lashes that were impossibly long. His face was a beautiful portrait and his cheekbones were an expensive frame. They jutted out at sharp angles that lent his cheeks a long but surprisingly soft appearance. It was an ethereal beauty that was unlike any other he’d seen on a man.
By popular demand, that "deleted scene" that I mentioned from Greg's chapter is now canon but featured from Sherlock's POV instead. :) I also get "Danny Boy" stuck in my head
Sherlock must have read his mind because no sooner could he speak when Sherlock pulled out two glasses from inside his jacket and gave him a challenging look.
Though he hadn’t deduced “killer,” he’d certainly deduced that this man was hiding something. He was afraid that Sherlock would expose him. It was with a pang that he knew he’d caught his killer.
(I am taking a road trip to Portland tomorrow. I will do my best to post but I can't guarantee the time or internet access to do so. Please be patient with me.)
“Right,” said the soldier to the woman, eyes now adamantly avoiding Sherlock’s. “Just the 16 oz black, then.”
But the stranger apparently felt no such kinship because he looked away with a flash of red across his cheeks and motionlessly stood in front of his picture.
“I can’t think of anybody looking for one in London, mate. But tell you what; I’ll keep my eyes out.”
“You don't care for it?” Sherlock asked suddenly, John's hands starting as the words broke through his concentration. His head snapped up violently and saw Sherlock cringe from the motion but nothing more. His gaze was intoxicating.
He fixed the man with disbelieving eyes and then went to work on cleaning the wound. “You mean to tell me that you challenged somebody to stab you and they actually did it?” He was quickly realizing he wouldn't be able to properly fix this wound with the shirt fabric in the way.
When the cab pulled graciously up to Sherlock’s well-known doorstep, he fumbled with the handle for too long before looping his fingers around it and pushing the door open. He fell out in a tumble of clothes and limbs in the almost-darkness and his drunken-haze. After pulling himself back up and staring blindly into the cab as he struggled to lay eyes on Lestrade, he said seriously in his direction, “One more thing, George?”
John repressed a sickened look when Sherlock approached with a tray holding ten more shots on it. He ignored the rising panic in the back of his mind since the tab would now be exceeding 9.70 pounds- nearly more than he carried in his pocket- from the current total of 20 ordered shots.
Sherlock’s ears pounded with rushing blood. His voice was hoarse, terrified as he asked again, “But?”
“John made it through Solomon Islands,” Philip said when their hands finally fell apart. His eyes snapped suspiciously to the prolonged contact but said nothing beyond the narrowing of his lids.
Sherlock closed his eyes, the sensation burning from tears that had thankfully subsided for the time being. He knew they were likely to return, and he vowed to keep this paper, this letter, pristine.
“John,” he gasped, eyes locking on him with the desperation of a blind man granted only one more sight.
Greg believes it's because John is embarrassed to have been stood up but we know the truth, don't we? ;)
He had demanded that Sherlock put the star on that evening, insisting it was an important rite of passage. He had fallen into the job next year and the next, and now seven Christmases had passed with Sherlock placing the star on top with John beaming to his right.
“What sort of band?” asked Wiggins, his gaze sliding from Sherlock to John. He sounded as though he was stating rather than asking.
“Sherlock!” he bellowed, desperation for understanding mixing with indignation at being treated as such. He chased him down the stairs and caught him standing still once more, hand frozen to the doorknob and eyes still refusing to meet John’s.
“Ah, hello John. Didn’t expect to see you here” he said with all the calm he could muster. He was barely aware of his words, John’s face, or anything else in the world. He was only aware of his drug-addled mind as it took in the sight of John and his heart as it beat with the pain of knife wound. “Did you come for me too?”
“Wow.” It was an unsatisfactory response, yet the only one John could muster. He was brilliant. Really, truly, astonishingly brilliant.
back away from the gesture but shifted his weight slightly toward Sherlock to receive it. Emboldened by the sign, the motion was swift: he placed his hands gingerly on either side of the man’s beautiful face and held the world in his hands as he beheld the universe in his eyes. John’s mouth was hanging open slightly and Sherlock’s heart performed dangerous stunts at the perfect puckering of his lips.
In John’s eyes, Sherlock found sincerity, understanding, longing, and- much to his surprise- a glistening that betrayed John’s emotions.
Tobias entered silently behind them, face expressionless and his trumpet secure in its case. Not one soul save Wiggins acknowledged his entrance and Sherlock’s heart constricted with the group’s indifference. Philip worked sourly with glances up toward John, Sholto continued to polish an already spotless portion of his trombone, John and Greg were deep in a teasing exchange, and Wiggins stared blankly at a spot on the wall opposite him.
His large, inquisitive eyes drooped slightly but their intent remained laser-focused. “Hmm,” he hummed in response, raising his glass to take yet another drink.
John could not bear to move his hand away from his eyes that were betraying him so thoroughly. The tears came excessively, unforgiving in their progress.
“Right,” he said softly. His eyes fell to the liquid in the saucer and he cleared his throat. “First, I need Tuesdays off. It’s the one night my family- It’s… our night.”
John’s hands clenched at his sides, his head shaking several times to clear thoughts Sherlock could not read. After taking several silent steps toward the door, he stopped. The physical manifestation of the conflict within himself was resulting in dangerous stunts performed by Sherlock’s insides.
In the meantime, Sherlock presumed it was a safe practice to assume the opposite of every word that came from John’s mouth. So far, it seemed to be working.
, Blimey Sherlock what the hell?” he asked ask Sherlock moved closer- too close- and nearly gripped John’s arm from across the table.
“I- Thank- Thank you,” stammered Sherlock between smiling teeth and suddenly, Greg wasn’t the only one embracing. Philip’s bubbling laughter came out purely happy, his arm extending around Sherlock’s shoulders for but a moment.
“What the hell just happened?” John asked, his own voice sounding like a shout after his prolonged silence.
And because there is good left in the world, Sherlock nodded stiffly, his eyes falling to release John from their hold and John could feel the tension lift from the pair of them.
The second hand moved with the faintest of melodies that fell unheard upon John’s ears. The only audience for its tune was the furniture- an unappreciative audience. Rather than register the passage of time, John’s mind blocked the sound behind a thick door of thought.
“I don’t know that you’re talking about,” Tobias said, tone as dry as barren land. “I’m nothing if not lively.”
Slowly, Sherlock’s hands fell from below his nose to rest on his knees, his knuckles white with the tension of gripping them.
Sherlock could have keeled over that very second and died a happy soul. It was, in fact, the very first nice thing that anybody besides his family had said to him.
In truth, he contained all the beauty of the rainbow within him, though it was suppressed beyond recognition. He had no idea, truly, how to allow himself to be the man he was inside.
I know this end note is an ungodly length already but I want to mention that this week's chapters won't have the number 97 in them for reasons that I will explain later.
John suppressed the urge to roll his eyes and instead, closed his eyes and prayed for the patience to make it through this debacle without yelling at anybody. “Fine, Philip. We’ll give him the title of ‘
He was coming down, now. The worst part passed, the world’s edges returning to their sharp corners. He thought of John, laying comfortable in his bed- his marriage bed. He couldn’t believe the loss of such a profound love. He couldn’t believe that the love that sustained his life was now over- had never begun.
That is how he came to storm in without knocking to see his friend standing strangely in the centre of his room, arms behind his back, chin jutted out expectantly in his nightgown. Hand still on the doorknob and eyes manically attempting to adjust to the sudden light of the room, his words scrambled out as though they were desperate for life.
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows for a moment, clearly racking his brain for the right words. “I don’t always know,” he admitted. “I see what I see and the conclusions come to me rather naturally. Can you tell me why water is wet?”
“Have a good night, John,” he said with a bow of his head before turning on his heels and striding down the street in the opposite direction.
He laughed, certain his companion was making a joke. A joke he didn’t really understand, but a joke nevertheless. When he didn’t laugh, however, Philip’s laugh got caught in his throat and fell silent. “You’re serious?”
“Thank you.” It was whispered so softly, John wasn’t positive he had heard it at all after the raucous jazz of the past couple hours. He looked up at the man and waited a moment, the two small words delicately floating around his mind. “Thank you for… inviting me tonight. I couldn’t possibly express to you how desperately I needed this evening out. How much I needed… a laugh.”
Bullets of perspiration slid without caution down his forehead as he flew down the corridor, his bookbag flinging wildly around him. He couldn’t be late, he had to just make it-
It was a frequent occurrence that Sherlock and John needed to pretend to be a couple. John always told himself that it was okay because it was always “for a case.” But the things they did “for a case” left a glorious feeling in the pit of John’s stomach.
“Of course they’re cute,” muttered John, embarrassed to say it any louder. “Look at them. They’re adorable.”
Shoot. How long had he stood there, silently staring with a stupid grin on his face? Rapidly, words stumbling with the speed he was trying to get them out, “Where are my manners? This is Sherlock Holmes," he said addressing the four men before him. "Sherlock, this is the band- minus Greg, who’s-”
John wanted to rip his own hair out in frustration. “Ugly?!” he shouted. “God, Sherlock! I’m not horrified because they’re
When the first rays of morning snuck through the thin curtains of the flat, Sherlock’s joints were awoken. Perhaps, even if John could not be the source of his orbit, he could fake it. His legs carried him numbly over the hardwood, the slapping sound of his feet like an echo of whips in his mind.
They broke out in a rhythm of song, mostly perfect in their execution with his experienced ears perking up at the slightest mistake. He took a seat in an uncomfortable, wooden chair and watched from the side as the lot of them practised, only the occasional glance of curiosity wound with animosity directed toward him from Philip or Tobias.
The pretence of rebellion fell away between them. It was a tangible difference, the universe between them dropping down hostile and demanding barriers to make way for something that almost resembled truth. It was closer to Sherlock now than it’d ever been before.
,” he groaned, watching with panic as the chessmen rolled from their places to new squares. He had only an idea of where they were before and no way to replace them in their exact locations without guessing. He would appear a cheater in the face of his imminent loss. He turned with fury to the source of the voice that had caused so much destruction to his game- the best thing in his life this past month. “Look what you made me-”
“The game is on, Sherlock,” he responded mischievously. “Let’s see if you can deduce which pair is from me.”
“To her home? Don’t be peculiar, John, we can’t just follow a woman around town,” he said with a wink and John had to laugh at the irony. “No, this case is bigger than I suspected. We’ll need to get the police involved now. After tonight, I have enough information to provide them with an easy path of prosecution.”
“John,” he tore John’s strong hands from his chest and clasped them tightly between his own delicate ones. He stared deep into the man’s eyes until he felt an intensity he had never experienced before. “For the first time in my life, it’s as though a channel has opened and you’re the one who let it all flow freely. There is absolutely nothing to contain my love, nothing to contain
His mind wandered freely, wildly running through his deductions to search for something meaningful. The outside world fell away until he was next in line. He only registered the vaguest form of the scene around him yet still guessed the drink order from the man before he said it aloud. Then:
“What division?” said a voice two seat to his right. John’s head turned to see a gentleman with short, cropped blond hair. He was staring at his own glass as bone dry as John’s.
“We could have ignored what we were feeling,” said John through a strained voice such as Sherlock had never heard. “I could have prayed to God that my longing for you went away. I could have refused you and never known love like ours existed in this world.”
“Right,” he said quickly, a flush colouring his perfect cheeks. “Well, what if I date someone- fall in love- and they’re really just a criminal mastermind who has formulated that plan to get me to trust them?”
Silence followed, the dust swirling in the dingy rehearsal space as Sholto’s words settled into each person’s mind with varying intensity. There was a blanket of discomfort over them, the pressure weighing them down.
“Er- yeah,” he said, uncertain of how to convert the particular sort of not okay he was. What was he supposed to say? “
The town is overflowing with bands seeking a performance opportunity and the options for clubs to perform in are limited. Al is just one owner of one club, but he won't let that stop him from helping The John Watson Band.
He started in on the drink before him as his mind churned for an appropriate response. If they weren’t on a date, then he had nothing to fear for honesty. Though, if he was too honest, perhaps he would ruin any potential shot he could have. God, he hoped he had a shot. Then again, he supposedly had no shot at all.
The letters were out of order, then. John would not have taken the care to keep track of which letter was written when. After all, the letters were a therapy and nothing more. There would have been no reason to.
“I’d like to- I mean to say… I wouldn’t mind meeting again. We have some things in common so it could be… good…”
First of all, please be aware there is just a bit more info to this case that John doesn't know yet. It will be covered in the next (very short) chapter. This is not a casefic so the explanation is really quite simple but it will be explained. :) Therefore, if something seems off or you have questions, I would love to answer them AFTER the clarification is given.
“My life,” gasped John, face flushed red with the rush of their embrace, “has been completely divided in half.”
John had been a Captain in the Army during the world’s greatest war but this- this required a whole different sort of bravery.
She forced a smile while John put an immense amount of effort into hiding his. “Great, I’ll have it out as soon as I can,” she said through tight teeth.
Because who would have thought that John would turn away from Philip almost entirely to place another man on a pedestal high enough that Philip couldn’t even reach?
They had both been hurt more than any two people should. Both been through more than either ever should have. John felt the blame of it all, the full weight of the loss he’d caused them. With one trembling step forward, his legs gave way and he was on his knees less than a meter away from where Sherlock sat. His body was wracking itself with silent sobs, his body trembling from the anxiety of being so emotionally exposed.
“Whatever it is you’re not telling me.” Sherlock’s shoulders were squared, his eyes wide to reflect the last few struggling rays of sunlight outside. His apartment was dim, the air stagnant, the atmosphere tense and unsure.
“How do you know something’s wrong?” In way of response, Sherlock rolled his eyes and arched one eyebrow as high as he could. The result was an exuberant laugh from Victor that reverberated through his soul. “Oh, right. Stupid question.”
Oh, right. That might have only been obvious to him. Sherlock reprimanded himself internally, fending off a wince that wanted to occur in response to his careless choice to make such observations of the boy. So much for forging any sort of friendship.
He dropped his arm without a word and Watson fell over the unmoving body, back arching repeatedly with silent, encasing sobs.
Slowly, Death’s head shakes, his chilled hand removing itself from the gloved-hand of Sherlock. “No,” its solemn voice says and the vision begins to fade away. “You live for-”
The words came out in a blur, the eye contact he maintained as he spoke was entrancing, impossible to look away from. John’s head spun from information, still reeling from when the man said-
John took one steadying breath. “If we win- which we will- then we’ll be in the movies.” Philip simply grunted in response so he continued, “So you know anybody?”
can't say them. I try to say one and accidentally say the other. Or it comes out as simple nonsense. I just can't seem to get my mouth around them. Hooray for author commentary!)
In order to win the competition, John must assemble a band of veterans. Luckily, John knows a guy (who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy).
“We’re here to tell you about your next steps,” said Nicholas, clearly bored. His hair was wispy, his skin nearly translucent in the horrible lighting offered by the room. “This is a paper that outlines the date and time of your expected arrival.” Philip, who was both nearest to them and passionate about reading fine print, grabbed the paper and began to immediately ignore the men before them.
, yes. Please, Captain, please, please, please…” the words fell into nothing more than passionate moans as John consumed him once more.
If John hadn’t been plagued by insomnia for the entirety of the past two months since he returned to this ruddy flat, he would have either slept through the boisterous pounding his wooden door was receiving or otherwise been royally pissed off that someone had woken him up in the middle of the night with their incessant pounding on his door.
Wow. This was a very exhausting but rewarding challenge. I am going to take a (much needed) break from writing for at least a week and then I will be setting off on my biggest fic yet titled Welcome Home. I can't wait to spend more than an hour on a fic! I miss planning and subtext and metaphors and intricate details. I'll get to that in a moment.
John was definitely going to need a chair. Or possibly a drink of water. Or perhaps he simply needed to be nearer this man. They were near enough to hear one another but three meters was too far for the thoughts racing through John’s mind.
Thank you all for reading and thank you to everyone who left a comment and inspired me to write this sequel. If you are reading this, know that I appreciate you immensely.
(P.S. the phrase "the shoulders of the soldier" is an inside joke with myself. Growing up, I was never able to say those two words. Actually, that's a lie... I
,” he growled between his teeth. His eyes shut close to block out the overwhelming visual stimulus. Mycroft remained stubbornly silent and his silence was worse than a defence. “
John’s skin itched everywhere. He wanted to claw at every inch of himself until he bore the painful scars that he deserved. He longed to tear apart his skin until the pain inside him was free.
“So are you going to tell me the truth?” he asked with unfelt confidence. “About what you did during the war?”
“Are you s-” “Yes.” His words were clipped. He did not have the time to repeat himself nor listen to stupid questions.
John’s stomach dropped but kept his face neutral. “Yes, Tobias. I know this song is good enough to win.”
He was wearing a robe of plush green material and John’s astonishment turned into a state of confusion. Who was he? What was he doing here? Today wasn’t- was it? But long fingers worked at the string of the robe and John realised that today
(Also, yes, that is light Mystrade you see at the end there. Mycroft did show up because he's not used to people talking to him like that and he is intrigued."
Their shared life experience was nothing. John had been so desperate, so instantly smitten… so foolish.
They walked in electric silence for a few blocks until the man silently slid into an unmarked door. John followed without question.
“No.” The word was chopped and John continued fiddling with papers without purpose. “Just going to head to a pub.”
In response, John stretched himself to reach Sherlock and, although he was expecting it, his heart skipped multiple beats when John’s mouth met his own. Sherlock’s eyes fell slowly, the sensation of John on his tongue filling him with a dizzying delight. His mouth was warm, firm, and beautifully commanding. Sherlock allowed his lips to succumb to every subtle movement of John’s own. There was a gentle quality to it that hadn’t been there last night when their motions had been desperate, frenzied, and rushed.
“John,” he said with a scrunched face, eyes centimetres away from a pair of exceedingly fluffy socks. “What are these monstrosities?”
Mads_Ansley is a wonderful author who is always SO supportive of my endeavours on Dreamwidth so this chapter is dedicated to her. Go read her stuff! She's also doing this advent calendar ficlet challenge.
Without even thinking about it, he began to grind his hips against Sherlock’s, pleased to find as he did so that he could feel the other man’s hard form around his movements. He could hear Sherlock’s breath hitch at the motion, and the ability to impact him in such a way gave indescribable satisfaction. He continued to move, reveling in how it caused Sherlock’s kisses to grow more frantic, small moans leaving him every time John rolled himself over Sherlock’s erection.
But instead, he allowed it, even fostered the growth of it. Who was he harming, after all, besides himself? There would come a point, eventually, when Victor found a nice girl and settled down without Sherlock. The thought sent a stab of pain into his heart and he pushed away the image. Instead, he simply stared at Victor and imagined, for just the shortest of milliseconds, that Victor would turn to see Sherlock staring, realize what emotion was held deep within him, and embrace Sherlock.
“You left behind traces of acrylic paint on the gun you used to kill them. Your belongings were torn apart in the struggle, including portions of your notebooks and even your bag. So why did you do it?”
Those days left John with an emptiness he felt pathetic for experiencing. It was as though this game- and this game alone- was the reason for him to wake up in the morning. When he needed to rationalize it, he reminded himself that the game offered him mystery and something to look forward to. It was more than he could say about any other aspect of his life.
He placed the rest of the letters several feet from where he had settled himself on the mattress. Gingerly, he took the letter he was convinced would hold precious confessions from the rest and stared at its unassuming envelope. Taking several deep breaths, his hands worked slowly to peel open the envelope and extract several pages of paper.
“We can’t say- for certain,” Mycroft said, with a note of uncertainty that was rarely found in his tone. Sherlock should have been more intrigued but couldn’t find a single reason to care. “He was in battle. We are fairly certain it was a grenade from the Japanese-”
Everything lay next to him now, blond hair an untidy tumble of exquisite beauty, facial features lax in sleep, the gentle signs of aging indenting themselves along the curves of skin. John was everything. From the smallest joys on Earth to the greatest sorrows, from the color red to the birds that flew in the sky, John was everything. None of it meant absolutely anything without him.
It was no surprise to him that Sherlock did not stir one iota when John walked in and sat down across from him. He never seemed to notice John’s actions when he was like this.
Love is a dangerous disadvantage. He couldn’t believe he got sucked in, his heart so thoroughly full of love. He needed to forget, needed to get high. He needed to get higher and higher until it consumed him and the pain was tolerable.
But he said none of this. Instead, he watched mutely as John put on his shirt, grasped clumsily at his other belongings, and strode toward the door. Sherlock, the man who John believed to be “Mr. Punchline” was at a complete loss of words. He had no idea what the missing ingredient was that would get John to stay.
“Stupid,” he muttered in response. Then, more clearly, “David said he would stab me if I didn’t shut up, I told him he wouldn’t have the guts, and he proved me wrong.”
So he had crumbled, his strength diminished. He had left his haunted flat that moment, travelled into the pits of the city’s civilization and located one gentleman who had refused Mycroft’s bribe. In less than half an hour, he was floating away on dense clouds of black unconsciousness.
Over the years, with practice and dedication, he became quite good at finding loopholes: he could nod and shake his head if the question was yes or no, though his neck would get sore for up to days afterwards if he did so. He was additionally capable of answering yes and no questions on paper, though he couldn’t force his hand to write the full truth without the prompting. He’d learned that when a girl in 6th grade had passed him a note that said:
And before he knew it, the words were out of him, flowing perfectly with the music around him, his mind rebelling violently against it all. His voice was shaking, sliding into his falsetto even when it wasn’t necessary and he was completely unsure why he’d agreed to this at all. But he’d done it- sang the first verse.
(He set him up. On purpose. Because he saw the guy staring and knew Philip needed an excuse to go initiate contact.)
“Alright, we've got it narrowed down to these two,” John sighed with resignation. He loved these movie nights but absolutely despised the selection process. “Miracle on 34th Street or Love Actually.”
His face fell instantly, forming a mask of impenetrable distrust. “What?” he asked flatly, clearly wary.
He knew he only had three measures to begin singing and he was wholly unaware of why he was here at all. He wasn’t a singer. Sure, he sang and he understood it all, but a singer? They would laugh at him.
“He’s terrific, folks!” called John, fingers simply dancing along the familiar keys beneath him. Sherlock flushed and pushed forward with confidence:
His winding train of thought was interrupted by the gentlest of upheavals when a soft rapping sounded at the door. He jumped at the sound, then furrowed his eyebrows tightly. Who on Earth
I'm sure some of you were expecting Sherlock to remain furious for a long time. While I understand why you would think that (many stories rely on long-lasting anger for The Drama or character development and I completely get it), lack of empathy and holding grudges really isn't the point of this story. John and Sherlock have some work to do, certainly, but I've tried to paint a realistic, heartfelt picture of recovery and understanding for our boys.
liked. John couldn't explain it, but he wanted so desperately to impress him. Maybe he should say he liked Rap. That's what the other boys his age listened to. But then he thought of all the things he
Unfortunately, Sherlock was quite talented in the art of doing things and had never been skilled when it came to not doing things. His heart continuing its dangerous pace and his breath trembling in futile attempts to provide his body with enough oxygen, he reached into the pile of letters and extracted another one at random- a smaller one- and read it with the impetuous passion of a man drinking water after being parched for many days.
As it turned out, the paint would stain the sheets with John’s art. His love for every portion of Sherlock Holmes would prove eternal.
Sherlock could only use logic up to a point, he thought, to find any sort of order in the letters based on their exterior. His first letter surely would have been addressed more carefully. John always paid extra attention and care to projects that were new to him. Additionally, the writing would be controlled in an effort to maintain the integrity of the project. However, the first letter would likely have been more challenging a task compared to the others. After all, it was the first step of his own therapy. The task would have been trying on John. Therefore, the writing would have to be wobbly, but still with an air of effort.
“Oh,” said Zane, the syllable loaded with disappointment. Sherlock wouldn’t allow himself to look up and deduce whether or not he was.
“Whoa,” he breathed again, eyes looking down at himself and then back to Sherlock. “Let me guess, then: you noticed my clothing was too big.”
Despite the face that endeavored so ardently to remain stoic, the corners of John’s mouth trembled, his eyes tightening in an effort to hold in his emotion.
Desperation rang in his voice, the full weight of meaning supported by the sincerity he could not fake. Sherlock’s head turned to his, those beautiful eyes staring at him with uncensored terror.
.” The word was an unabashed beg and John fought back a smile when he remembered a time when Sherlock has asserted he’d never begged for anything in his life.
If you share this ficlet collection on Tumblr and tag me (@itsalwaysyou-jw) to help get this work exposure, I will:
Despite Sherlock's pleas to stay with him, John decides to walk away. The years that follow offer unendurable pain as he attempts to continue his life with the regret that haunts him.
“My heart was icy, cold, and closed before you,” continued John as though he had not spoken. “Since you’ve entered my life, it’s been an entirely different existence. I’m happier, life is fuller. I’m not quite as sour toward it all. I eat now, my memories hold less horror than they used to.”
John loved these moments: Sherlock was unable to deduce the meaning of John’s staring because he, in fact, was paying no attention at all to his external surroundings. So he drank him in, the hollow of his collar, the buttons on his shirt pulling from the strain, his too-short pyjama shorts, and his-
The sudden sound was such a surprise, the pawn fell from John’s grip and landed with a clatter on the board, knocking over several other fragile pieces with it.
“Sherlock-” he started, and the note of regret in his tone threw Sherlock’s heart into a flurry of panicked activity that was completely unparalleled by any other that has ever been uttered.
And sure enough, Mary was leaning into a well-dressed gentleman, her fingers trailing along his wrist in dancing motions. It was the brazen display of affection that made John realize just how close Sherlock was. So close, in fact, that John could smell the rum on his breath. His eyes were wide and imploring, his pupils wide with exhilaration and John was certain he would fall into them.
“I’ll lead the way!” proclaimed Sherlock with a skip in his step, striding out the door with long legs that left John half-running to keep up. He didn’t mind, of course. His heart was light, flying far above London in erratic patterns.
None of these stories fabricating in his mind satisfied the evidence, however. His theories would only explain a couple months’ difference in accumulation. It was clear that someone had been in this room tampering with those areas for up to a year- perhaps longer- after Sherlock was believed to be dead.
“It's complicated,” he said quickly, waving his hand as though he could physically push away John's curiosity. “So tell me, John: What sort of music
He could see it as though a physical manifestation of his vision truly stood before him. He could write a song detailing the appreciation and adaptation of returned soldiers with both hands tied behind his back. He lived through the war. That was the difference between himself and the other contestants- his personal connection to it all. Somehow, someway, he needed to put together a band- saxophone, drums, bass, trumpet, and trombone- that also served in the war. That would be the key.
The path beneath him was so familiar, there surely must be an indent in the rug from the continued, unending pressure of his feet along this path. Doors stretched along either side of the corridors he journeyed past, thousands of possibilities available to him and each door offering a unique option. Of course, despite the volume, he’d been inside every room of this wing of his Mind Palace multiple times; it held every memory he’d ever stored away pertaining to John.
“Oh,” he said, taken aback but grateful for the change in subject. Oh, how he wanted another shot. Oh, how he knew Sherlock shouldn’t have a third so quickly. “It’s a competition for bands in Britain to write a song to honour the returned men in uniform.”
They made small talk for the shortest of times, exchanging their branches and ranks. John was wholly unsurprised to find that his guess had been correct: Sholto was a Marine. However, he was also a Major. A picture on the mantle displayed a fairly pretty woman with two children beside her. Sholto confessed they were his children and John wondered why he sounded so distant about the fact. His words were not impolite, his body language not standoffish, yet John could read him as well as a novel written in a foreign language he didn’t speak. There was an undercurrent of Sholto’s withholding, but every soldier seemed to be hiding the depth of their suffering.
It was a cold, dreary day when Sherlock awoke, determined to survive one day of his life without being ridiculed. Today, he vowed to himself, he would go the whole day without speaking. He would not answer the teacher’s questions no matter how easy they were, he would not make observations about his classmates, he would not attempt to engage in “small talk,” he wouldn’t even greet those around him with a cheery “good morning” in a futile attempt to obtain their good graces.
The third scotch grew warm in his stomach when it happened. Mind swirling, senses dulled, the words slipped out unbidden:
“I can’t tell you what the answer will be,” said Sherlock, staring where John’s eyes were despite their coverage. He wanted John, whenever he looked up, to see his emotional sincerity in every word. “That’s impossible.” A deep breath steadied his next words. “But this thing between us- John, it’s bigger than what we can see.”
“Thank you,” John called when Sherlock pulled himself into the other seat across from him at their table and slid a drink over to John.
Am embarrassed smile fought for territory on the man’s face. He was deliriously adorable with the effort of looking humble. “You think so?”
The waitress returned then, her hands baring their scampi di gamberi. She placed both gently down before them, steam rolling off the food in a fashion the filled John’s mouth with saliva.
The paper bore patterns where ink was subtly warped from the liquid of tears. Though there were certainly a fair amount when Sherlock began the letter, there were a few extra fresh ones by the time he finished. Try as he might, the tears flowed from his eyes liberally. He hated the tarnished effect they had on the letter, though they fell outside of his ability to prevent them.
“I love him,” he choked out. His eyes were burning with want of tears, his world crumbling apart beneath him as the confession fell out.
“Well, there is only one more band left to change your mind. Once again, this is Janine and Archie, your hosts for tonight's broadcast, brought to you by Bayer Aspirin, just in time for the holidays. Our last contestants are six of our boys just home from the war and a young man who lost his wife and best friend in the war efforts with a song called
“Eh,” he said letting the vowel drag out. “Doesn’t matter. Obviously, I gave up on the ordeal shortly after. Dedicated my life to resisting attachments in the effort to focus on science. I’d always been more than comfortable with it, the science thing, but… I wanted to be better than anybody else. I could deduce perfectly well, but lacked the breadth of scientific knowledge I have now.”
A more perfect opportunity couldn’t have presented himself even if he planned it. “I think you need me up there on keys, Al.” He forced a smile that was like a foreign virus on his face. Yet his charm was the only weapon he had in this war called civilian life.
John wiggled his glass as he caught the eye of the bartender to wordlessly request a refill. “Something like that, yeah.”
Greg howled with laughter and John wondered how long the two had known one another to have this sort of relationships. Wiggins, laughing along, said in a nearly sarcastic tone, “I prefer this sort.”
“I already know what you drew,” he said with a roll of his eyes. “And I know I’ll never forget. I know you’ll remember and I know the gesture meant more than the art did, which would have washed off in my shower anyway.”
It was days before John was able to procure time alone with Sherlock once again. The case, it seemed, must have been an interesting one for his friend- if he could call him that still- did not return home but for brief flashes of time when John could not talk to him.
His mouth was suddenly too dry to form the words he wanted to. He stumbled out the words, “I- Can we talk?”
“So that’s it? We just- can’t accept?" Tobias’ voice came entirely too soon after the door closed, though an eternity had elapsed.
The flat was empty in more ways than one. It was home, he should have been overwhelmed with joy and comfort to return to the location of the happiest moments of his life. Without John, however, the flat was nothing more than an accumulation of dust and painful reminders of his previous life.
John rather figured he knew what he was looking for now: not just what she was wearing, but the state of what she was wearing. His eyes flew to her pearls, shining in the dim light. Yet-
“For me,” John shrugged, attempting to match the cool indifference being directed toward him. “Unless you want one.”
“I think that’s brilliant,” John said, resisting the urge to praise this revelation until the sun dawned upon them both. “I bet you’re brilliant at it, too.”
John took in a large breath after some time, alerting Sherlock’s heart to the fact that he was about to speak. “Why do you say my name so much? Much more often than anybody else says it, even more than you say anybody else’s, you say it. Why?”
John was at war with himself regarding how high to get his hopes up with this man. He’d said point-blank it wasn’t a date. But it felt like a date. He said he didn’t want to open up with anyone. But it felt like he was opening up.
