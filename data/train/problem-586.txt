“No,” says he.
Some days he takes out the Sig Sauer. He’ll strip it down and clean it thoroughly and reassemble it with ease, his hands swift and sure with muscle memory while his mind drifts away. He'll think about his Hippocratic oath and how natural the gun feels in his hand. He'll lose a bit of time just considering the weight of the metal and comparing it to the weight in his mind. Thinking. But that always gets tucked back away, too. Sometimes with more reluctance than he’s willing to admit.
“Mr Holmes is too generous,” the woman says, a hand to her chest. “He brought my sister’s murderer to justice, and now he has opened his home to me. I knew he was a clever man; I hadn’t known him to be a kind one. I am truly overwhelmed.” Sherlock can only gape at her.
John takes a deep breath. He has often been told that he has something of a temper. He doesn’t like to think of himself as an angry bloke; he know for a fact he is an entirely even-tempered man who simply is far too often pushed beyond the limits of reason.
Sherlock, himself, is on his back on the floor, eyes closed, in loungewear and his dressing gown. He holds his Stradivarius in one hand, the instrument loose under his chin, and his bow in the other, now and then playing a string of notes as he replays his latest case in his mind and mourns the subsequent lack of the slightest matter of interest since.
home,” Sherlock growls. “And you are sorely mistaken if you believe—”
time; and now that the reality of this time has sunk in, he's lost the courage to make a more deliberate move, and it seems doubtful that Sherlock will.
John takes several shuddering breaths. Then he gasps out, “Do you promise?”
“Shouldn’t that be my warning to you? After all, I’ve already got the best of you once, if you’ll kindly recall.”
“Nor interfere with my work.”
As he does, with no further regard for his presence, she takes the newspaper from the table beside her, shakes it open, settles herself further in the chair, and begins reading. He tracks her eyes and notes it is no ruse; she is genuinely focused on the paper. She pauses a moment to ring the bell for Mrs Hudson.
The woman.
, they seem to say. A hollow man who can’t fill up his own mind, let alone have enough left over to write down. He’ll return the journal, as blank as ever, and slam the drawer shut. He’ll think briefly about making an angry call to Ella, telling her that her advice is shite, but he won’t actually bother to. She’ll just be infinitely calm and reasonable and try to persuade him to make another appointment, and he’s had quite enough of that, thanks.
She’ll tell.
But someone arranged all of this. Someone went to patently absurd lengths to dump him in a room perfectly suited for Victorian London with a man calling himself Sherlock Holmes and a woman calling herself Irving Adler. And if this isn’t just a joke in remarkably poor taste arranged by someone close to John, then—well.
“Notes?”
“Maybe it's a new fashion?”
So he says again, even shorter, perhaps a little snappish, “Yeah.”
John snorts and without thinking gives the other man a light shove. He quickly withdraws his hand and means to apologise, but Sherlock just appears delighted by John's unthinking familiarity.
“Doctor,” the man begins again.
He just listens to the music. To its crispness and liveliness. The promise of adventure and excitement and happiness and everything John has ever wanted. His heartbeat calms, his shoulders lose their omnipresent tension, and he nearly smiles.
, despite the embarrassing circumstances of their initial meeting. Not long after she begins joining him on cases.
“I was being polite,” Sherlock sniffs.
“Do you need one?” the man asks.
, too real. John stumbles a bit on the uneven cobblestones and scrapes his palm steadying himself against the building. The pain is slight but unmistakable. Not a dream.
“You know. The one you were always going on about. Reading at Bart’s whenever you had half a second to yourself. Some historical account, I think.”
“Mrs Hudson is to be treated with the utmost respect.”
And so: Sherlock gains both a flatmate and a biographer in a single morning.

and Sherlock Holmes was sitting across from him. But no one had been allowed to touch anything, let alone sit on the furniture, of course, and there were too many other visitors around to pretend it could've been just John and Sherlock. And the whole setup had just been an exhibit, really, since Sherlock Holmes had moved out well before his retirement and taken with him or else disposed of his personal affects, all of which were lost following his death. So it was all just guesses and replicas and framed passages of the books or newspaper clippings. This, though. This is what he'd imagined. No—
When John was at his best, the world was always brighter for that extra presence in his life. And when John was at his lowest, lonely and contemplating the bottle and hating himself for it, well, he never felt truly alone.
The nightmare fades and John is home. He knows it with more surety than he has ever known anything before. He is home, and for once he sleeps soundly, deeply—dreamlessly, but for the violin notes playing in the peripherals of his mind, an impenetrable shield against the shadows that might otherwise creep back in.
“Mendicant society,” Sherlock finishes, his gaze briefly flicking towards the man on the corner and then back. “

, though he perhaps attempted to tone down his obvious affection when his parents started demanding to know when he meant to grow out of his childish obsession. Lots of people admire historical figures, even relatively obscure ones, and know every little detail of their lives. It is and was a perfectly fine pastime. Except right at this moment it doesn't feel like a harmless pastime. It feels like the only thing John has
own interest. The police will solve the matter. Eventually.”
“'Eventually' is not sufficient. Ms Adler counted some of the most powerful and influential individuals in the world among her most ardent admirers. I would consider it a personal favour if you popped over and wrapped this little matter up.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer. His excursion to Bart’s was insufficient to ward off his black mood and he has no interest in engaging in conversation. Particularly this one—the publishers and Adler will fight over the title for weeks and Sherlock has never wanted any part of that nonsense.
“And this here is my unfortunate—”
They’re a few steps from the door when John can’t hold back anymore—he bursts out laughing, and the sound must set Sherlock off, who starts laughing just as deeply, and they’re both laughing and holding onto each other for support like a couple of drunken fools.
John stomps towards what appears to be the way to the front door but pauses at the top of the stairs. He huffs, his left hand clenching and unclenching, and turns back towards the lunatics, both of them still watching him. “Where in the hell is my cane?” he demands.
Adler comes and goes as she sees fit, but John stays, helping Sherlock to cases and writing copious notes that turn into narratives to which both Sherlock and Adler turn their noses up because they're too
But most days he reaches for the book and chooses a story at random and loses himself in the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes.
“Here's what I know: You're not
That probably isn't a fair assessment. After all, Adler wrote in all those details that led John to his conclusion. That led to John's childhood infatuation, which he may still be harbouring three decades later. Maybe Adler meant for people to see the side of Sherlock Holmes that John sees.
From when he was a boy with skinned knees and a perpetually sunburned nose, forgetful drunkards for parents and an older sister already fast following their footsteps, to a harried student hurrying through the halls of St Bart’s under a pile of heavy, dense medical textbooks, to a weary captain barking orders under the Afghanistan sun right up until the pain hits and he’s spinning and can’t pinpoint when or how he went from standing to sprawled on the ground spitting sand and blood, or from there to the cold, sterile hospital room.
“You see, Holmes?” Adler says. “He can speak for himself.”
“Sherlock Hol—”
Within a day Sherlock conclusively proves the murderer to be one of the house’s regular patrons. The local police arrest the man, finding copious evidence at his residence, the day after.
Some days he reaches for the journal. He’ll open to a random page and tap his pen against it and feel the mounting frustration and despair as he comes to the same inescapable conclusion: What has he to write about? Nothing. Not like anything ever happens to him. He’ll lose an hour or four staring at the crisp white pages mocking him.
The scene around him is right out one of those documentaries of Victorian England that Harry liked to sigh over, like the backwards technology and morals were romantic. Gas lamps and horse-drawn carriages and every last man, woman, and child in period clothing. Not
John says. “The amateur—it’s mentioned in Adler’s stories. The last one, in fact. But only in passing. No real details about the case. The amateur—”
? Follow Sherlock Holmes around like a lost puppy? He knows a bit about the period but hardly enough to get by.
“I have absolutely no idea,” Sherlock says. He smiles then, a wild, feral, blindingly joyful smile, and John cannot help the answering grin that stretches across his face even as Sherlock asks, “Do you want to find out?”
Even now, back home with nothing to show for it but a limp and an ache in his shoulder and a foul disposition, wallowing away his days and his money in his depressing little flat, there is a spark in John’s heart when he thinks of his lifelong companion.
“Indeed,” the man says. “You think people are staring at your limp—you exaggerate the lameness and glare at anyone who looks at you overlong and as they pass by you mouth an angry retort to the comment not one person has yet made. They are not staring at your cane but the hand holding it. More specifically, your wrist, and more specifically still, the device strapped around it. I’ve a thorough knowledge of timepieces—quite useful in my line of work, as I’m sure you can understand, they tell you so much about the individual wearing it—and I’ve never seen its like before. I daresay if I traveled the world this afternoon I would not see its like anywhere. I confess that I would require a much closer study to guess as to how you managed its construction, and I’d be tempted to say it’s not a watch at all. Except,” he once more takes out his pocket-watch and this time turns the face towards John, “For how precisely and admirably it has kept time with mine. I won’t find such a technology anywhere today, and certainly not anytime in the past thirty years. We’re looking for a timeframe, dear doctor. We can with some confidence eliminate the present and the past from consideration. So: Forwards, not backwards. Thus, the question at hand must be: What year was it yesterday?”
Sherlock smiles softly at the floor. Then he closes his eyes and raises his instrument and begins to play.
Later, before parting ways with Sherlock and John, Inspector Lestrade scratches his head and says, “It’s just as well, I don’t know

As if the moment were not already perfect enough, Sherlock asks, “What do you think of the violin?”

Eliminating the matters Sherlock personally deems trivial but others might consider a scandal still leaves an unfortunate 10, of which eight the woman could’ve gained knowledge of via her apparently fast rapport with the thoroughly charmed Mrs Hudson. Four of these matters would see him imprisoned, and one would have Sherlock hanged by the neck so quickly that not even Mycroft could intervene in time; and round and sedentary his brother may be, near nothing in London travels faster than a message penned by that hand.
“I should sincerely hope so.” When Sherlock offers no further terms, she sets aside the paper and leans forwards, something calculated in her expression. “Well,” she says. “Now that that’s settled—I’m most curious about the resolution of this Musgrave Ritual.”

present forever from his mind—dismiss that as a mad, drawn-out fantasy world and this as the normal reality—except that certain differences keep creeping in, inescapable, and John cannot help but recognise and comment on them and then be momentarily thrown from this dream that is more lifelike than life.
A light goes on in the window above them. Adler, peeking at them from behind a drawn curtain, her eyebrows raised. John waves to her; if anything, she looks even less impressed.
“Bloody
first) and returns her wave good-bye by rote as the hansom pulls away.
The first time Sherlock encounters the woman is in January of 1881, when he is asked to solve her murder. An all-around unexceptional case at first glance, truth be told, and one to which he turns his attention only at Mycroft’s persistent behest. The preliminary details he’s given point to an unremarkable murder, probably a spurned former lover or a jealous colleague or something equally trite, and a case even the police should be quite capable of solving. Certainly Sherlock hadn’t any interest in traveling to Warsaw for such an affair.
John's initial motivation to pursue his doctorate may have been based on the thought that if there are indeed men like Sherlock Holmes still around, and if he should ever have the good fortune to meet one, what they really need by their side is a man with a solid head on his shoulders who knows how to patch a wound as well as to create one. Not some useless, sarcastic, perpetually unimpressed bystander like Adler, who seemed to spend more time despairing of and disparaging Sherlock Holmes than being of any assistance.
London. Another few blocks here and random turns there, and if John doesn’t see a mobile soon he’ll—he’ll—he will cross that bloody bridge when he comes to it, is what he’ll do.
“What the—” he gasps, jerking violently but unable to move further.
When he thinks of the opera house case, he thinks to himself: How infuriating. How
John hadn't actually registered how closely they were standing until he is able to feel Sherlock still. “Is discretion no longer a virtue in the future?”
John turns onto another street and doesn’t spot a single seam in this absurd facade. Two more blocks, and he demands, “What’s your name?”
Adler always thought it was her skin in which she was uncomfortable. But then Watson arrived, and she wondered: What if the problem were, in fact, instead the time?
John looks around, trying to spot—oh, who knows? A camera? Someone peeking around a corner and laughing? But there’s only the man, looking fascinated, and the woman, looking torn between astonishment and amusement.
John doesn't think about it. Nothing good would come of thinking about it. He says, “I don't know.”
“—biographer and accidental housemate, Adler.”
, pray?” the woman asks, at the same time the man, sounding sincerely concerned, begins, “Doctor—”
,” John says. He has had enough of this and he is leaving before he can be either murdered or persuaded into doing something ridiculous. And if the man or woman attempt to stop him, well, that would be damned stupid of them. John may not be good for much these days but he can break every bone in a man’s body while naming them, thank you very much.
John may have once been embarrassed about how much Sherlock Holmes meant to him, back when he was younger and stupider and didn’t know just how insignificant a thing like that rated when compared against all the ways the world can break a man down.
He can feel the man hovering in the doorway behind him. There aren’t many photos of the real Sherlock Holmes around, but the bloke is a dead ringer. So, well done whoever-the-hell. John spent a not inconsiderable amount of his formative years considering those few photos of Sherlock Holmes. And he instinctively—absurdly—wants to hear the man out, just because his face is even better in real life and does funny things to John’s stomach. John wants to do a lot of other things to the man involving wine and a bed, but that part of John has been dead and silent for so long now that it damned well isn't getting the reins now. Especially since this man could be a murderer for all John knows.
John’s spiralling thoughts grind to a halt. He blinks once, twice. John lowers his arm and turns to the man, who appears expectant.
John should tell this man to go bugger himself, but reflex takes over again. “Half past nine,” he says.
“Christ,” John says. “Did you rob an antique shop?” But he takes the cane all the same. It’s just as heavy as it looks. He manages a grudging, “Thanks, mate,” without bothering to overthink whether he should be sparing any pleasantries for his maybe-kidnappers who may intend to be his murderers, before turning around and trudging down the stairs.
Before John can react to that astonishing statement, she leaves (she never, in fact, returns). She believes him. She believes that John isn't from this time—if for no reason than that John doesn't have the imagination for anything else to be true. And, frankly, she's absolutely right.
In his old life, John would already be half in love. But John isn’t that person anymore, and his eyes dart between the ceiling and her face and absolutely no lower and he’s almost relieved she’s got his arms pinned because otherwise he honestly doesn’t know what he’d do with his hands.
“I said no such thing.”
“Behind you, the man in the grey overcoat begging on the corner. A younger gentlemen. He’s clean shaven, his hair uncombed, his fingernails trimmed. He’s wearing only one shoe. There’s a turquoise ribbon peeking out of his pocket. Do you see him? Look, but be casual. Do not draw his attention.”
Following her conversation with Watson, she'd found Holmes, who took one look at her and must have seen a hundred pieces of data pointing towards the fact that she did not mean to return. Adler's throat had suddenly tightened, and she'd thought that if he said one word she would punch him in the jaw. But he had simply held out his hand for her to shake. Then she had gone to St Bart's, and next she knew...here she was.
Or maybe Adler was a cock and fuck him.
Sherlock goes on with his life and his work. He had managed to avoid having his picture taken by the press during the opera house affair, but his name is in the papers for weeks. His clientele does experience a notable upswing, thank you brother dear. Never enough work, though. Always too many stretches of nothing in between.
“What a funny little man,” he hears the woman say just as he flings open the front door.
“Do you make a habit of stating the obvious and then endlessly repeating it?”
This is a dream, isn’t it? Has to be, except everything is too
It's the first time he's called John by his first name instead of Watson or Doctor, and the surprise more than anything is enough to shock John into gulping in a lungful of air. But the shaking and aches and terror persist. Sherlock has the prettiest eyes, John thinks, somewhat hysterically.
—and it's a helluva if—he has traveled back in time, is it permanent? How long will he be here? What is he going to
“It’s the last true mystery, my dear John,” Sherlock assures him.
“A victory few have claimed,” Holmes acknowledges. “And, I assure you, one that no one has claimed twice. What do you want?”
, John thinks, his breath coming faster and his mind just repeating that refrain:
“I know,” John says, and also knows that it is not his imagination that Sherlock relaxes when John steps further into the room rather than turning away. He takes a cuppa and settles into a seat with a contented sigh, only too happy to have both; he is suddenly exhausted, the events of the day finally catching up. He takes a sip and lets out a happy hum.
them. She corners him, while Sherlock is out, and asks, “How did you manage it?”
Determined to escape this madness, John picks a direction and sets a fast, angry pace. He hasn’t even reached the end of the first street before the man has caught up with him and fallen into easy step besides him. John refuses to acknowledge him and feels his anger burn whiter with each step that passes during which the man apparently takes no issue with being ignored.
And though John inwardly groans, maybe it’s for the best that the front door opens and Adler, with a huff, ushers them both inside while grumbling under her breath about idiots who would be lost without her.
in the corner, and an oil lamp and candles on the desk and nightstand.
If it’s not a dream, and if it cannot possibly be real life, where does that leave him? He’s never felt so sober in his life and in his experience hallucinations are neither so logical nor so historically accurate. He could simply be going insane.
John stills.
John turns from one to the other during their rapid back-and-forth, gaping. Then the man turns to him. “You’re not a client, are you?” he asks, before swiftly answering himself, “No, no. Of course you’re not. But you
in the corner.
John startles at her approach, always a little on edge around her. “Manage...?”
“You are never to touch any of my experiments,” he says.
“And that’s...” John licks his lips and takes a stab in the dark. “Irene Adler. She was never murdered.”
Or...well.
John doesn’t remember when he started walking. He knows where to go even though he doesn’t know where he’s going. He barely notices when the sand under his heavy boots becomes pavement becomes cobblestone becomes hardwood flooring becomes soft rug under his suddenly bare feet. When the heavy heat becomes heavy fog becomes the warmth of a crackling fireplace. When the pain fades from his leg and his shoulder and his heart.
She just looks at him.
“Why here?”
Later, after breaking into numerous landmarks associated with Holmes, Adler will find the box of manuscripts. There will be a note on top, in Holmes' handwriting, addressed to her.
John thinks the person who understood that the least was his own biographer.
The war moves around him, with men and women in ragged camo continuing to shout and aim and fall. But they’re muted, the sounds muffled and the vibrant details rapidly washing out.
John knows the man's official history, of course, or what little is known of it for such a notable man (John may be slightly biased as regards to the extent of Holmes' notoriety). Holmes was by all accounts a private man who kept few if any confidants outside of his biographer Adler, about whom even less is known. Holmes famously solved the murder of the man's sister, but anything more of the circumstances of their acquaintance is unclear. Contemporary accounts even disagree on whether Holmes and Adler were the closest of companions or the greatest of enemies (though do seem to agree that it was definitely one or the other, with nothing in between). His clients praised him and cursed him in equal measure but were almost universally reticent about disclosing the details of the affairs with which Holmes had assisted them, which made sense to John; no one had called upon Holmes because they were having a good day. Historians who specialise in the life of Holmes think it was by the influence of his brother Mycroft, himself a reclusive figure, that Holmes' personal life was kept out of the public eye and history, both. All of which meant that if Adler had not come along and written his stories, Sherlock Holmes may have not even been a footnote in history. Especially as, once Alder abruptly stopped writing in eighteen-ninety-seven, the only further account is that Holmes retired 10 years later to a little cottage in Sussex, where he lived in reclusion until his death in the late nineteen-twenties. No one knows what became of Adler.
John moves to inspect the pictures. The room itself and everything in it has a strange weight, a solidness to the construction that is foreign and yet somehow comforting. He strongly feels that everything he's looking at should be dim and buried in a solid inch of dust, but there’s sunlight through the window and—he runs a finger down the nearest frame—not a speck of dust to be found.
He continues to consider her. She has a tension to her that wasn’t there previously and which worsens the longer Sherlock draws out the silence. Her gaze has become fixed on the paper. He considers the extreme lengths to which she has gone to hide herself. To protect herself. She would tell in a heartbeat to save herself but would take no pleasure in it, of that Sherlock is certain.
The one part of John's time that Sherlock truly appears to detest is it's view on smoking and recreational drug use. On one memorable day, John systemically finds and throws away Sherlock's cigarettes and pipes and drugs and launches a campaign to convince him to stop those terrible habits and prevent him from replenishing his supplies. John doesn’t make much progress until the day after, when he's stalked by three frightening men in dark suits, who manage to catch him off guard and stuff him in the back of a hansom (not before he knocks one of them out cold, thanks much) and bring him to a large, cold manor and seat him before a large, cold man with thinning hair and a sour expression. John's mouth goes dry when he recognises him. Mycroft Holmes offers John a large sum of money to leave and never return (to which John replies, “No thanks”) and then an even larger sum of money to keep him abreast of Sherlock's every move (to which John replies, “Well, you can go right to hell.”). And when John refuses to budge, Mycroft summarily dismisses him and John is dragged back into a hansom and kicked out a few blocks from Baker Street. John would have a lot to say about Mycroft Holmes, except later that day he's suddenly got the Irregulars and Scotland Yard and Sherlock's own suppliers on his side in his effort to keep Sherlock clean. “Your brother's an interesting fellow,” is all he'll say when Sherlock asks.
knew. I could tell straight away, and Mr Holmes has tried but he cannot convince me of anything different. And I cannot express how it warms my heart that someone else has seen it as well.”
“Sherlock Holmes,” John repeats.
While Adler became a constant presence in his life, she sometimes disappears for weeks at a time—sometimes in a three-piece suit, other times in a flowery dress and wig. The latter seems an unreasonable risk to Sherlock, but she assured him, “You’re the only one who would notice, and you already know,” and has yet to be proven wrong.
He shoves past the man, out of the bedroom and into a—drawing room, just as elaborately arranged as the other room. There are outdated scientific posters covering the walls and outdated reference books on the shelves. There’s a pipe rack, and an ivory box on the mantelpiece, and a bearskin hearthrug in front of the fireplace, and glass laboratory equipment holding liquids of various colour and consistency on every remaining available surface, and more candles and gas lighting. For Christ’s sake, he can see a
Adler emerges not long after in a floral dress with a high neck and flared skirt, as well as a long blonde wig. As she bustles around the room, gathering her things, she instructs, “Take lots of notes of everything you see and hear, even if you don't think it's important. If you forget something Holmes will have remembered it, but then I'll have to catch him in a talkative mood, and why torture us both? Keep Holmes busy but do try not to let him get too sure of himself. If his head gets any larger he won't fit through the front door. You may lodge in my room, if you'll be needing two rooms.” John hears a strangled noise and genuinely isn't sure whether it came from him or Sherlock. She continues as if she heard nothing, “But if upon my return my room is in any sort of disarray, any of my things missing, or my personal affects rummaged through, I'll flog you myself and quite enjoy doing so. When Billy or any of the other boys come by, you're to make sure they take their shoes off at the door and offer them a bite to eat. Make sure they wash their hands and faces before leaving—they're moan about it, but you ignore them and their wide eyes. They're brats, the lot of them. Any questions?”
“I adore it,” John says. “At any hour of the day.”
Maybe she was right about this high-brow stuff after all.
“Well, aren’t you showing all kinds of interest towards matters for which you'd previously displayed none.” While Sherlock hunches further into his armchair, she turns to John and says, “Good heavens, are you daft? Why are you just standing there? Go dress!”
. But also: How magnificent. He keeps a newspaper clipping of Irene Adler's obituary among his case files, and he thinks: Well, that is that. He will not see her—or her like—again.
The first note he almost misses, the sound pure and striking and utterly incongruous. The second is louder and quickly followed by a rapid succession of notes.
“A doctor,” the man breathes. “Better yet, an
One hour later, Billy the Irregular shows up with the cane John had borrowed from Sherlock. John gives him one of the biscuits left by Mrs Hudson and makes him wash his hands.
“Because Irving Adler does not wear whatever nonsense you're currently wearing, and if you are to stay here and be my alibi, you must dress the part.” Adler pushes him towards her bedroom while explaining, “I have business out of the country that is preferably completed discreetly. At absolute best completed in complete secrecy. Though the why and how of your sudden appearance remains a mystery—one to which I believe not even you have an answer—I am not one to let a fortuitous advantage slip by. If you play the part of 'Irving Adler,' then no one need know or suspect me to have been out of the country. And even if you did not so clearly wish to stay, you even more clearly have no where else to go. Stay here until I return at the least, and more ideally, for as long as our arrangement remains advantageous to us both.”
“Yeah—”
“Not the most observant man, Inspector Lestrade,” Sherlock muses. “And yet, sadly, one of the best Scotland Yard has to offer.” John can only shake his head and following Sherlock back to 221b Baker Street, the both of them grinning at one another the whole way.
“...You,” John blinks rapidly. He actually takes a step back. “You actually believe that I traveled here from the future?”
,” he says, with feeling.
~*~*~*~*~*~
And as the years pass, and their uneasy companionship continues, and Sherlock feels a coldness seep into his bones even as his devotion to his work borders on the fanatical, Sherlock is never certain whether he sets out to emanate the man in the stories or whether Adler was able to see something about Sherlock before he saw it in himself.
Business had picked up since the opera house affair, true, but not nearly to the degree necessary to keep a mind like Sherlock’s sufficiently occupied. The resulting paycheque has kept him housed and fed, even allowed him to leave his disastrous flat on Montague Street. But the resulting calls for his services have been tiresome at best. Lords and dukes and sheikhs and other notables whose problems are petty and obvious. He does not have any interest in
Mycroft takes a deep breath, his expression clearly smoothing through sheer force of will. One who does not know him would think he is moments from conceding. Sherlock is not such a person, and so he waits for Mycroft's next move. Mycroft studies the view outside his study window and allows the silence to drag far past the threshold of Sherlock's tolerance, and then he says, “You haven’t had a case in some time, I believe.” Sherlock’s fingers still, hearing every last word that Mycroft does not say about the burgeoning (and heretofore largely unsuccessful) career to which Sherlock has stubbornly dedicated himself. And then the fatal blow: “I worry, you know.”
When John returns inside, his thoughts jumbled, Sherlock is standing by the window with his violin. An older woman is setting out a tray of tea. “That will be all, Mrs Hudson, thank you,” Sherlock says. The woman—Mrs Hudson!—smiles fondly at John, without seeming at all bothered or surprised by John's presence, and then takes her leave.
As if Sherlock doesn't know who Irene Adler is. He never saw her perform but one can hardly be an aficionado of the opera as he is and not at the least know her name.
At his resentful silence, she continues, “The man following Sherlock Holmes is Irving Adler. No one need actually look at that man to know it is him. That is a simple fact. The only one who would notice is Sherlock Holmes himself, and he already knows. Trust me, Doctor, people see what they want to see.”
“Ah. Are you secretly among her admirers, then? Or perhaps not so secretly at all?” At Mycroft's sour frown, Sherlock shakes his head. “No, brother, I beseech you to beseech someone else.”
“Right,” John says. And then his mind catches up with what Sherlock just said. And he says, “
Sherlock grudgingly leaves for Warsaw the following morning.
“I can't—this is too—it can't be real,” John babbles, his breath hitching, overcome with shame at his own cowardice. “I couldn't face—and it's everything I've ever wanted and I don't
The man appears both pleased and startled. “Do you think so?”
“If I tell you, will you leave me be?” John asks. At her stiff nod, he quickly recounts everything he can recall from that last day. When he's finished, she smiles and says, completely sincere, “Thank you,” as if he's actually handed her an answer.
Life is more perfect than John could've ever imagined possible, if he ignores the lingering dread undercutting every single moment that every day since he arrived has been too good to be true.
“So people will talk,” she says. Sure enough, they get more than a few considering glances, particularly when they stop before the hansom and she leans forwards to kiss his cheek. Before pulling away, she hisses in his ear, “If you damage him in any way, I'll have you killed.” Then she pulls away with a wide smile plastered on her face and holds out her hand for him to help her into the hansom. He's too dazed by a sudden realisation to react to her threat (absurdly unnecessary threat that it was, he would
“What the bloody hell is going on?” he manages, the words still sleep-rough. He swallows, feeling the press of the penknife against his jugular.
“Quite all right,” Sherlock answers. Perhaps not as sincerely as he’d intended, given how Stamford frowns. “I’d be better if you had anything of interest for me.”
Right.
“I don’t know how I got here,” John says quietly and then admits, like the cowardly thief he is, “But I don't want to go back.”
Later, Adler will discover that no stories of Holmes past her own were ever published and become preoccupied with finding Watson's manuscripts. Knowing she cannot truly move on until she has laid this matter to rest.
“Um,” the woman says.
“So is that what this is, you think? Some sort of society of people playing at being beggars?”
“Hello,” Adler says, knowing it's best to be impeccably polite when threatened—even when being unconfidently threatened. It usually confounds the person enough to create room to manoeuvre. And, indeed, the woman blinks rapidly and her grip on the bat becomes unsure.
“Then I shall disregard my momentary impulse to reevaluate the esteem with which I hold you.”
“How long?” Sherlock asks, after they've followed Adler up the seventeen stairs. John hadn't counted them on his angry way out—and how can it only be hours ago that John was here for the first time when it feels like coming home?—and experiences a thrill at doing so now. Almost as large a thrill as he's getting from the very fact of Sherlock's very existence.
“Like it will be a hardship for either of you,” she scoffs.
Sherlock will never understand what compelled her to transform one of his cases into a written narrative, nor what compelled the
“Absolutely.” John shakes his head. And it's insane, everything about this is insane, but there's only so much proof a bloke can ignore. “You’re Sherlock Holmes.” He spreads his arms. “This is—my god, this is real. This is—You’re
“Doctor Watson,” Sherlock says. “
He listlessly plays a few notes, and he sighs.
“What do you think of ‘The Matter of the Missing Bride’?” Adler asks.
There are two other items of note in his desk drawer: a journal, every page blank, and his Sig Sauer.

John wants nothing more than to make her sign a
Later he is returned to Baker Street, on his back on the drawing room floor and his violin loose under his chin. There is still assorted gore under his fingernails from his unsatisfying experiment.
“Of course.”
“Aren’t you curious,” the woman says. She smiles, sharper than the penknife. “If you hadn’t gathered, that is the precise question whose answer I am awaiting with baited breath from
A beat of silence.
He instantly recognises the shoes that halt one step from Sherlock’s face, as they are in fact his own. Sherlock studies the shoes a moment, before drawing his attention upwards and noting equally familiar trousers, waistcoat, winged collar shirt, cufflinks, and hat.
“Hardly,” the man says with a dismissive wave of his hand. “But I think that
Glancing sharply at Mike, whose countenance is as blandly congenial as always, John says, “Excuse me?”
“I read them, once, you know,” Mike says, somehow completely oblivious to the fact that he's waltzing across an active minefield. “Long time ago. Always thought he was a great fellow. Well-meaning, you know. It never surprised me you'd take a liking to him.” He takes another leisurely sip of his latte, like he means to do nothing else all day but sit here holding John hostage. Then, “It was really great catching up, John. Truly.”
hero of yours. While we appear to be roughly of an age—though I'm likely a few years younger—and I flatter myself to think of myself as a competent detective even at a tender age, the odds of your having knowledge of my childhood exploits is near nonexistent and you specifically cited Adler’s stories, which have only been in publications for ten years. I hardly think childhood heroes are acquired by men in their twenties.” The man finally takes a breath, and John gasps in a breath, too, unaware he'd been holding it while the man talked, faster and faster. “Then, obviously, there is the matter of your watch.”
This is insane. Even
“...My apologies, Doctor,” Sherlock says, sounding so genuinely contrite that any irritation John may have felt vanishes and he gives Sherlock an encouraging smile. Clearly bolstered, Sherlock steps back and throws himself into an armchair, allowing John to face Adler, who uses the distraction to push the clothing on John. Which leaves John with an armful of clothing and no explanation.
Most accounts say that such a lonely end was fitting and unsurprising for such an aloof man. Adler often characterised him as a machine—an unfeeling man who craved and loved nothing but his work.
Detective Lestrade!—tips his hat at Sherlock with a, “Mr Holmes,” and then at John with a, “Mr Adler. I look forward to reading about this one.” And then he is on his way.
,” she interjects.
That’s a violin, isn’t it? John isn’t a classical music type of guy, so he can’t place the song. “You’re so unsophisticated, Johnny,” Harry would laugh when John was ignorant about whatever high-brow topic he knew for a fact she’d only read up on the night before to impress Claire. Back when Harry was still trying to make it work. Back when she cared. It feels like a lifetime ago. The thought of Harry deep in the bottle stings less than usual, cushioned as he is by the steady rise and fall of the music.
But again John cuts him off. “Who arranged this, damn you both? Was it—was it...” But then John stops, because there is no end to that sentence.
He pulls open the drawer of his little rickety desk in his rickety little flat and takes out a well-loved book, faded and dog-eared near to death and the spine so creased the book could fall apart any day, but it wouldn’t be the first time he’s had to repair it. The book originally belonged to his parents. They’d read it to him when he was still in the crib, and though he couldn’t have understood a word of it, they told him that when he got fussy reading to him that book was the only thing under the sun that would make him stop crying and be quiet, for god’s sake. Would tease a smile and a giggle out of him, even. When John was old enough they’d simply handed him the book, and it became John’s most treasured possession.
Some nights John can’t sleep and the old nightmares threaten to drag him back—and, like clockwork the violin serenade starts up, and John can take a deep breath and follow the music back home.
John’s mouth had slowly dropped open during this relentless onslaught of observations. It takes too long to realise he’s lightheaded because he was holding his breath again.
“Possible, though I've yet to hear of it and I take it upon myself to keep abreast of such trends. Very useful knowledge. In addition, there is the fact that two weeks past I was written by a man named Gerhard Stone who professed to be an absolute wreck due to his younger brother, whom he suspected of being in some sort of society of questionable repute. He feared the society’s activities veered into the illegal, given his brother's guarded attitude whenever Mr Stone attempted to question him. After following his brother one afternoon and watching him appear, for all intents and purposes, to be begging on a street corner, Mr Stone seemed to fear more for whether his brother’s behaviour could tarnish his own reputation than whether his brother was in any danger, and frankly the case hadn’t intrigued me and I declined to take it. There had, however, been a single point of interest which stayed with me: Mr Stone had most distinctly noted his brother’s sudden penchant for ribbons of unusual colour.”
. He barely cares about money. If 221b Baker Street ever stretches his finances over-far, he’ll seek out someone interested in a flat-share, or else, more likely, hold his nose and call upon Mycroft, for who would want to share a flat with him?
“Indeed,” the man says, beaming.
“Knock, knock!” Mrs Hudson calls cheerfully before coming into the room, a tray in her hands. “Oh, Mr Holmes! How good to see you are back with us. And Mr Adler, a good morning to you as well. Let me just set all this out.” As she busies herself setting out the tea and various assortment of breakfast foods—Holmes’ preferences but also some notable differences, likely the woman’s own requests—she chats away. “I really do think it is wonderful of you to have taken in a boarder. It will be good for you, having someone to talk to instead of that dreadful skull.”
The man studies him again, a strange glint in his eyes, with the same kind of intensity that kind of makes John want to punch him in the face, but mostly makes him back to back the other man into a wall and kiss him until neither of them can breathe. “One moment,” the man says, swiftly heading into another room and just as quickly returning with a handsome, mahogany cane with an elaborate silver figure on top. He holds it out to John. “Take mine, if you require one,” he says.
They find Gerhard Stone’s younger brother, George Stone, who falls to his knees before Sherlock and the inspector and swears it was all just a bit of fun, no harm meant, and promises to disband the society if they will let them go without pressing any charges.
A black mood rapidly descends upon Sherlock, which only blackens further as he stands and quickly stalks around the flat, observing several key, alarming details—most notably that what should be his empty spare room has been suddenly furnished. He returns to the drawing room and takes a seat across from the woman, brows furrowed and fingers steepled under his chin.
When he was a lovesick fool doting on his latest girlfriend or boyfriend, when he was pissing about with the rugby lads, when he got that Dr before his name and knew he was going to make the world a better place.
“So...?” John trails off, not following.
“Oh, please,” Adler says dismissively. “Don't give yourself too much credit, Doctor. In fact, give yourself none until you’ve earned it. Did you take notes?” She attempts to push the clothing onto John, but Sherlock immediately intercepts her.
One day, during one of the loathsome times when he is without work, he decides to alleviate his boredom by repurposing a few corpses at Bart’s for an experiment he has been meaning to pursue. On his way to the morgue, he passes the chief of medicine, Michael Stamford, who asks, “Everything all right there, Holmes?”
“Adler,” he says, warning in his voice. “Do not presume he has any interest in your little games.”
“My...watch?”
, as chronicled by Doctor John H. Watson.
The third time John sees, from the corner of his eye, the man reach into his pocket, retrieve a pocket-watch that must’ve been stolen from the same museum as the cane, study the face while humming to himself, and then re-pocket it, John has had quite enough.
promising he can have this, but at the same time the bloody presumptuous
“Bees,” Sherlock confirms.
And so begins John's strange and wonder new life—a surreal whirlwind of thrilling or puzzling or intrigue-filled cases punctuated by quiet moments of achingly lovely domesticity, the likes of which John has never before known or experienced. Hadn't known
“John? John Watson?” a vaguely familiar voice calls out one day, perhaps six months after John’s return; the days all blur together and it's not like he's got a schedule to mind. “It’s me. Stamford! Mike Stamford. From Bart's?”
“On the contrary. I am quite enthralled,” the man says. “Just concerned my time is off. What time do you have, if I may ask?”
“A place to stay. No more and no less.”
“This is Mycroft's doing,” Sherlock says, certain of it.
And he thinks: Well. Perhaps the skull
“You're never polite to me.”
“Perhaps because this is your reaction to my taking an interest,” Sherlock says.
He makes it one step.
The woman.
When he's made his way back to the suffocating safety of his little flat, he eats a quick meal that’s dust in his mouth, washes up, and then opens his desk drawer and considers:
“If I may ask, how many times today did someone mistake you for me?”
John stares, his mouth working silently for a moment. He looks around—at the

The opera house manager swears it was Ms Adler’s brute of an ex-lover. Ms Adler's fellow contraltos blame one another. The conductor swears suicide. And to the man, every last opera staff member tells him, pale and breathless, that it was the opera house ghost, they swear it.
“Boring you, am I?”
John won’t give the man that satisfaction of asking just why a perfectly functioning watch is interesting. He just keeps his angry pace and tries to quell his rising panic as street after street passes and modern London—

attempts to talk about his cases. But soon enough Sherlock’s name becomes known far and wide and he has more clients ringing the doorbell than with which he knows what to do, so he has no inclination to complain.
. Which is rubbish, as far as John's concerned; the stories have the exact correct amount of sentiment and Sherlock and Adler would admit the same if they weren't such arses. Adler stops writing her own stories; in fact stops accompanying Sherlock on his cases altogether, which would've made John sick with guilt if not for the fact that both she and Sherlock appear happier that way. Adler offered to take John's stories to her publisher, but John declines. These stories are for him—no, they're for Sherlock, whom he sometimes catches sitting cross-legged on the sitting room floor, the box in which John keeps his manuscripts in front of him, and sifts through the pages with a soft smile on his face.
—he is, but sure enough there's a man precisely as Sherlock described. “Yeah, I see him. What about him?”
He may worry, during the sleepless nights, when he’s staring at the ceiling and everything aches, that it’s not always going to be enough to fill the hollowness inside him.
John looks at the suit in his hands. And then to Sherlock, who is apparently too busy suddenly sulking to offer any help. “Why, exactly, am I doing this?”
“I am loathe to disappoint you, my good, strange doctor, but the answer remains the same, I assure you.”
Then he snaps, “Why don’t you start by explaining to me what in the
John sighs, “Right, then. Bees in Sussex it is.”
John has really had enough of being ordered about by her, but, well, he has agreed to her arrangement. Which only entails his dearest fantasy coming true. There is that. So he does as she instructed but can't help but ask, more to himself than to her, “Why am I doing this?” as he opens the front door for her.
speculating that you’re both gay and spent the time between cases hate fucking each other. I’ve always wondered if they were right, and, well, this is my big chance, isn’t it? Any comments?”
The nights John manages to sleep, he dreams of gunfire, constant and deafening. He dreams of heat, oppressive and suffocating and so heavy it's a physical force pressing him into the ground. He dreams of sand, irritating and rough, of blood, and of biting, blinding pain. His heartbeat echoes in his ears. He can feel the metal barrel of his gun in his hand and smell death and violence in the air. He is so fucking tired. He’d give anything for just one night of peace—to escape the war for just one night.
whatever twist of fates tries to take him away. “I'm staying right bloody here,” John growls, and Sherlock says, “Who am I to doubt my doctor's word?” And then they don't speak for quite some time.
Journal, gun, or Sherlock Holmes?
“I act of my own volition,” she says, which is not a denial.
. Right. Right. Good.”
“Did you not?” she asks.
John Watson has always had Sherlock Holmes.
Certainly no one who both knows him well enough to know his preoccupation with Sherlock Holmes and would go to this trouble for—what? A laugh?
The man has not even blinked at the woman’s nudity but he examines John with an intensity that makes John’s ears burn. Up to this point John had been fairly certain that he was not the naked person in this room, but even he is having doubts and actually glances down at himself to double check.
John does his best to subtly glance over his shoulder, though, as has suddenly occurred to him, it’s difficult to see how John in his jeans and jumper and smartwatch in Victorian England wouldn't draw the eye. Not to mention Sherlock’s hand is still holding his wrist with his arm half-raised in the air. Though it could just be John who’s having difficulty dragging his attention away from that point of contact.
Adler may not have initially believed Doctor Watson to be from another time, but when the evidence piled up, she was ready to believe it.
“If you’d been in any condition for a civilised conversation four days ago, there may have been a discussion.” She licks her finger and casually turns a page. “But you were not, and so there was not, and as the only person whose mind was capable of rational thought I made a decision on both our behalves. Besides, it would be far too much of a bother to move my affects at this point.”
Everything about the woman is sharp and dangerous. Her eyes are unkind and her thighs against his sides are unyielding and her hand holding the penknife is steady. He’s fairly certain he could throw her off without undue injury to himself (and he’d be completely confident in his ability to do so if not for his bum leg). But, well, she’s also—
With Sherlock's obligation completed, he calls for a hansom to begin his journey home. He is settled and about to signal the driver to move when there's a knock on the window. He pulls aside the curtain and sees a woman in a veiled hat. She lifts the veil and Sherlock is faced with—
. What are his priorities, here? Even if he hadn't, he's just met the man. What did he think was going to happen? “So—you are, then.”
Well, she’s also
Though for the life of him he couldn’t say why, despite the immediate threat and the fact that he’s in a wholly unfamiliar bedroom, he finds himself calming. Perhaps it’s the relief of finally having a tangible enemy after months of having only his own mind to fight.
Eyes closed, in his mind’s eye he reads over her first story of him, the words as clear as if he were reading them on paper. His first true glance of himself through someone else's eyes. He finds himself returning to it, again and again.
“Yeah, you can keep on waiting. I'll take an explanation, first, thanks,” John says. “Let's start with: Just how did I get here?”
. There is nothing else worth caring about.
His fingers spasm against the bridge wall and it’s two aborted attempts before he can bring his hand, trembling even more than usual, to gingerly press against the base of his skull.
“I swear it. I swear to you. I am real, and so are you. And you know I do not tell untruths. I swear it, you understand. Breath in and out, John. Focus.” When his shaking has finally subsided, Sherlock repeats, “I swear it on my life,” and John—
For a moment, John doesn't think she'll respond. Then: “This time suits me ill. From what I've heard, your time sounds...more accommodating.”
Well. He can bloody well count to 10, can’t he?
It's not
When Adler next wakes, there is a woman standing over her clutching a baseball bat. She is rather short and thick, with a shock of dirty blonde curls and wide brown eyes and an unsteadiness that suggests she's been drinking.
Sometimes Sherlock and John stand too close. Sometimes their eyes meet and lock for a moment too long and sometimes their touches linger. Sometimes John draws out his explanations when Sherlock's gaze seems fixed on his mouth, and sometimes John strongly suspects that Sherlock does the same when regaling John about one of his past cases—John himself is endlessly captivated by the cases only referenced in passing in Adler's books, or not mentioned at all. The only thing John truly hates about living in this time is that it is
When Watson took over the role like he was born to it, it became only too clear how ill-suited to the role Adler had been.
His guest reaches his floor and walks towards Sherlock, steps muffled by the thick rug covered in cigarette ashes and various chemical residues despite Mrs Hudson’s heroic attempts at cleaning. He listlessly turns his head to examine his guest.
“Oh, you know how it is,” Adler says. She briefly ducks out of the room and returns with a bundle of clothing. “Perhaps one week. Perhaps seven months. Though I imagine it could be five years and you wouldn't notice. You realise you've never asked before?”
An almost boyishly delighted grin slowly lights the man’s face. It turns his untouchable beauty into the sort of beauty that John’s fingers itch to touch. The argument being posed by his libido instantly increases in insistence (and appeal).

been on his mind. And it really is quite a fascinating matter. And if she believes the way into Sherlock's good graces is through his work—well, she is not wrong. So Sherlock tells her, and she listens intently. She asks quite intelligent questions and makes insightful observations. Something inside him blossoms at her attention and sincere if grudging admiration. Something else inside him shrivels at the nature of her focus, of the feeling of being on the wrong side of a microscope, but he pushes that uncomfortable thought aside. Halfway through his account, she politely asks him to pause, briefly leaves, and returns with pen and paper with which to take notes.
He notes, aghast, that Mrs Hudson appears close to tears. “I tell you, my good sir,

sex talking, it is taking an inordinate amount of willpower to not simply say to hell with whatever is going on and make a valiant attempt to climb this man like a tree. The man who has probably kidnapped him, or at least helped to kidnap him, for reasons John can’t fathom. But it’s difficult to give that knowledge proper weight given the unexpected and sudden reignition of John’s libido.
He brushes his thumb over the title.
Adler had long been ready to move on. Accompanying Holmes on cases had always just been a way to pass the time; to solidify her presence in his Baker Street, as Mycroft Holmes had asked of her, until she found a true purpose. She was not meant to be a stepping stone for someone else's. The arrangement suited them both, she believes, and the guilt of abandoning Holmes made the arrangement stretch for far longer than Adler had ever intended.

“There is no Irving Adler.”
John feels his lips stretch into a mad grin, and feels Sherlock grinning, too, and fuck if John knows what twist of fate landed him here but
Sherlock finds himself unable to muster sufficient interest in his guest to stand, so he remains on the floor.
That Irene Adler was not in fact killed, and Sherlock not only knew but is living with her. He would be utterly discredited. He would never work again.
The man has slicked-back midnight hair, a sharp nose and sharper cheekbones, and is dressed in loose lounge pants and a dressing gown tied tightly around his narrow waist. A violin dangles carelessly from one hand. He is an achingly classic beauty. While this could just be the fact that John's adrenalin is running high and it’s been so long that John doesn’t even
John hasn’t half a clue what’s going on, so he holds tight to his anger because he’d rather that burn whiter and hotter than deal with the growing fear and humiliation creeping over him.
Then Lestrade—Detective Lestrade!
John doesn’t
After 10 minutes of irritatingly polite conversation, John glances at his watch—some fancy smartphone affair Harry had pushed at him; probably half guilt and half so she didn’t have to look at the inscription on the back anymore—and is about to make his excuses when Mike says, “Do you still read those stories? In that one book?”
John crumbles and ends up being the dressing screen and emerges in a three-piece suit and a bowler hat. He can't remember the last time he felt so—formal. Even though it's what half the men on the street had been wearing. He tugs on the waistcoat and adjusts his shirtsleeves and feels—put together. Sharp. Actually quite all right. He thinks he could get used to this kind of clothing, especially when he emerges from the bedroom and Sherlock's eyes immediately darken at the first sight of him.
John says, “I answered your question, so tell me: Why does it matter to you, anyhow?”
. That would be just great, thanks.” When neither immediately answers, he continues, “Is this a joke, then? Is this supposed to be
and couldn’t mask her relief when lunch was over and they were both free to part ways. Not good old Mike Stamford, fat and happy and so good-natured and well-adjusted it set John’s teeth on edge. Most of his buddies from Afghanistan were still posted overseas or else didn’t make it home, and those that did were in no better shape than John. His parents have been dead since he was at university. He’d be hard pressed to even name a member of his extended family. The rugby lads, the girlfriends, the boyfriends, the fellow residents and doctors and nurses—they were from somebody else’s life.
John Watson will always have Sherlock Holmes, and for as long as he wants him, Sherlock Holmes will always have John Watson in return. And if it doesn't matter
Fine.
“Much too late for objections,” she returns, not even lifting her gaze from the paper.
, but that doesn't even scratch the surface of the emotions welling up inside him.
His guest is tall and slim, with hair shorn unfashionably short and face clean of makeup.
The woman straddling his chest, her thighs pinning his arms securely to his side and her hand holding a penknife to his throat, clicks her tongue and shakes her head. “I would be still, darling, or you are liable to do yourself grave injury.”
John gets to three.
“Before you think me inexcusably rude, allow me to introduce myself, though I would venture that if you are here you are well aware of who I am,” the man says.
“What year was it yesterday?” the man asks.
“Quite,” the woman says.
Adler takes the opportunity to sit up and take in the strange bedroom in which she's found herself.
He doesn't know how long he sits there until there's a clatter and hurried steps and then Sherlock is there, kneeling before him, warm and close. He frames John's face with his long-fingered hands and presses their foreheads together. “Breathe, John,” he commands.
~*~*~*~*~*~
John doesn’t hesitate. “Oh, god yes.”
Correctly interpreting his silence, she says, “You’ve been regaling the ceiling about it the past few days. But you never reached the end.”
John feels himself tensing. It's not like his preoccupation with Sherlock Holmes was ever a
“And…” John turns to the woman. “Mr Irving Adler.”
,” John snaps. “And I certainly don't see what it matters after all this time.”
“Notes,” she repeats, slowly like one would to a child. “Of whatever occupied you both today?”
He may thank god he has this one, good untarnished thing in his life every time he opens his desk drawer and considers: Journal, gun, or book?
“It matters to me,” she insists. “You must know something. What is the last thing you recall before coming here?”
Irving Adler was by most accounts a promiscuous scoundrel, but towards the late eighteen nineties he appeared to become taken with and faithful to a mysterious and unidentified blonde-haired woman. Is
He looks up; the woman is studying him through the upstairs window. He doesn’t see the man, but he hears hurried footsteps.
, you enjoy the cases as much as Sherlock. And your titles are shite, try to have some creativity, huh? Oh! Here’s a good one: historians have written
John believes him.
“Your notes...?” Adler prompts, as if the prior interruption had not occurred.
He is not positive how long he has been there, time made unreliable by opium and boredom.
John isn’t in any capacity to entertain human interaction, had in fact only intended to run a few errands he could no longer put off before escaping back to the flat. But Mike is all inoffensive smiles and gentle but persistent nudges and before he can put a stop to it John finds himself sitting on a park bench beside the man, sipping an overpriced coffee he didn't want and can't really afford.
Fine. Okay. Even if they were in his London, he would have to concede that one. “How am I supposed to pass as you? We look and sound nothing alike!”
“In Sussex.”
“Can’t say that I do. And I’d say I wish I did, except that would mean wishing something awful on someone else, wouldn’t it?”
The woman, meanwhile, has had time to gather herself and snaps, voice rising as she talks, “Listen, if you're a hallucination—well, you're a good one, cheers to me, we should absolutely make out for as long as this lasts. If you're real you'd better tell me who you are and what you're bloody doing in my bloody bedroom right this bloody instance or else get the bloody fuck out of my house before I crack your bloody skull open, you hear?”
Sherlock assures him again that there is no need for concern and brushes off Stamford's attempts to invite him for a meal. He continues on his way, but before he turns the corner Stamford calls, “You’re a good man, Holmes. I've always thought so.”
“You continue to ask questions that I believe would make infinitely more sense coming from myself or Holmes,” the woman says.
Sherlocks turns back towards him, surprised and unclear from where such a sentiment could’ve derived, but Stamford has himself already turned and begun walking away. The matter being ultimately inconsequential, Sherlock puts it from his mind and continues on his way.
Who arranged this?
Clearly on reflex, the woman says, “Harry.”
“Oh, good!” she says, casually stepping over him and seating herself on the nearby settee. “You’re returned. I confess when Mrs Hudson said these spells of yours can last for days I thought her to be exaggerating.”
As one of Sherlock’s oldest acquaintances and one of the few souls on whom Sherlock would waste pleasantries, Sherlock says, “Ha, I suppose it would. Then let us say you made no such wish and keep your conscience clean.” Stamford laughs and thanks him but continues to look concerned over Sherlock's well-being.
