"She definitely sounds pretty," Steve said as he squinted up at the nest, creating a mental picture. "You must have pretty good eyes to be able to see it so clearly."
love him that damn much, so much that it caused him physical pain every single time Steve started in on one of his self-deprecating rants.
"And so, what's the endpoint here?" the student had asked, confused. "If he's still deteriorating on his current treatments, then what are his goals of therapy?"
"You can't do anything," Tony said, completely devoid of emotion. "It's—it's too—Bruce and I are the only ones who can figure this out, and once we do, I'm gonna talk to Fury about trying to reopen a diplomatic dialogue with Wakanda, 'cause—"
Dad was trying to fix Uncle Thor's ship so he could remove the Tesseract from Earth, hopefully once and for all, and that was a mission that Peter was not at liberty to share with anyone, not even Gwen. Dad and Papa had decided while Peter was still in his coma that they needed to keep the theory regarding the infinity stones a secret for as long as possible, both to avoid a public panic and to prevent the U.S. government from trying to take over from the Avengers when they had no business doing so. At the moment, to the outside eye it appeared that Tony Stark was just lending his mechanical abilities to a member of his team, who just happened to be the god of thunder, and nothing more.
"It did?" Peter asked as he scanned the address label, his belly swooping when noticed that the return address was the dorm Gwen would be staying in at Oxford. "Um… what—?"
Peter sniffed, nodding against Tony’s chest.  “Yeah, it was.  You know I don't care about how much money we have.”
Steve gasped as he jerked awake, chest heaving and covered in a cold sweat as his eyes flitted around the room, trying to get his bearings. His surroundings didn't look the HYDRA prison where he'd been kept, it looked more like—
"Looks like another successful patrol, Tony," he said. "Congratulations. Seems like your plan is on track."
Peter's lower lip shook as he tried to turn away, held fast by Gwen's hand. He knew she was right, but since it wasn't at all what he'd wanted to hear, he also didn't want to admit it in front of her.
"Yep, hence why I said, 'right by your hand'," Tony said. "Now, point your phone at it so JARVIS can send me a hologram."
Steve’s heart skips at least three beats as he scans down the results again.  And then again, hoping that somehow he’s just misread them.
Steve smiled, that soft smile that only Tony ever saw, his arms tightening around Tony's waist. "Thank you, sweetheart."
After confirming the information on his phone, Peter groped around for his glasses and slid them back on, his heart skipping a beat when the building completely disappeared.
Steve's chest was so rigid and tight that he could barely draw in air, pulling memories of his severe childhood asthma attacks from deep within the recesses of his mind and slamming them to the surface. The sensation of being unable to breathe had never failed to cause Steve to panic, but this time he couldn't blame the lung disease he had suffered with for the first twenty-four years of his life, or the fact that he was drowning.
"Just… feeling pretty lucky, on this New Year's Eve," Tony murmured. "And hoping it's not just a passing fancy."
"My dad's a compassionate and loyal person too," he said. "And he loves my papa so much. I've never seen him so happy."
"Are you sure that you're comfortable, little guy?" Steve asked as Bruce finished attaching the various leads to Peter's head and chest that would allow him to monitor his vital signs from the anteroom. "We can get you another heating pad, or another blanket, or—"
"And you?" Steve asked in a small voice. He curled his arms around Tony's waist and pulled him close, and Tony practically melted against him. Maybe that meeting with Beck had been more stressful that he'd originally thought. "You've been running yourself ragged trying to take care of us, sweetheart, especially lately, so I'm not gonna let you forget about you."
"Of course," JARVIS said, filling Peter's vast bedroom with the soothing sound of gently falling rain. "Is there anything else that you require?"
"I'm not surprised," said Steve. "Did you see that he tried to convince the government to try and open scientific diplomatic channels a few times when he was with SHIELD?"
"It's all right, Pete," Dad said quickly as Gamora stepped closer to Thanos, a rather triumphant smile on her face. "Just keep going!"
Peter was so focused on his papa, both the image version and the live flesh and blood, that when the rifle shot suddenly appeared, the very sound that haunted Papa the most, he immediately dropped to the floor, absolutely convinced that it was real.
"Don't think you have to worry about that, honey," Tony murmured. He came up next to Steve, who curled his arms around both his and Peter's shoulders, hugging them to his sides as they all gazed across the lake, and the water rippling lightly in the breeze.
of his armoured feet is oddly comforting, and Steve figures that as long as he can still hear them, it should mean that Tony’s okay.
I'm just not strong, honey, not like you, and I can't—I can barely even think about it, much less wanna actually hear it, so—"
"Tony Stark," Dad said shortly. "Look, did Thor happen to say when he might be done with this new hammer of his? 'Cause we could sure use his help."
Steve's words, meant to offer comfort to his distressed friend, still hit Tony as hard as a sledgehammer.
"Yeah, you do though," Bucky said firmly. "You always have a choice, Стиви. If you wanted to, you could go up to that cockpit right now and order Сэм to land this thing somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and then disappear. You could choose to walk away from all of this and become some kind of wandering nomad for the rest of your life. You could choose to do that, Стив, but you won't. And you know why?"
But aside from that brief passing glance, Tony's entire focus was on his husband and son, sitting against the far wall surrounded by the rest of their family.
“Oh!  Well, now I really can’t wait.”  Obie waved his hand towards the door, sending ashes sprinkling across the top of his desk.  “Now, get on outta here.  I’ve got work to do.”
"Following the battle with the Dark Elves, I entrusted my Warriors Three with finding a hiding place for the Aether," said Thor. "They then left it under the guardianship of a being known as the Collector."
"Good," said Sam as he raised his arms over his head, trying to stifle a yawn as he stretched. "'Cause I gotta say, it hasn't been easy on me to watch you like this either, and I don't even like you as much as Tony does, so…"
"He killed Loki first," Bruce choked out. "Strangled him with one hand. I—or should I say, the other guy—was barely conscious at the time."
“What?” Peter cut in, a bit more frantic now.  “Dad, what's wrong?  Has something happened to Papa?”
"Nah, I can understand that. When I was a kid I thought it was the coolest thing ever to be a pilot. Little did I know that I'd have no chance in hell of ever being considered."
He found Peter in the kitchen working through his third bowl of soup, with the makings for an entire fresh pot already arranged on the stove and countertops.
"And by normal operations we mean no dings, dents, or scratches on any of these aircraft, is that understood?" Phillips piped up. "In fact, I have half a mind to put together a goddamn wash and wax rotation if it would help hammer home just how privileged you people are to even get to touch these babies, much less think about flying 'em."
"There," Papa said as he stepped back. He blinked, his blue eyes shiny as he placed his hands on Peter's shoulders. "You look so much like your dad, little guy. Almost too handsome for words."
"Yeah, maybe," Tony replied, even as he highly doubted it. He gave Happy a begrudged nod. "Let's just get it over with, yeah?"
After posing for several pictures graciously taken by Sam, Tony and Peter headed down to the garage. The plan was for Tony to drive Gwen and Peter to their restaurant for dinner, then have them escorted the two blocks to the school by Stacy and his partner, who were both on duty that evening. Stacy had also volunteered to drive Peter home after the dance ended at midnight, which Tony had uneasily accepted after being encouraged by Sam to do so, but at the moment he still wasn't quite sure if he'd be able to go through with it.
"Absolutely no harm in doing that," said Tony. "But even so, I'm sure Pepper's mentioned something to you about my modern art collection that's just sitting in storage, hasn't she? It's worth millions, but both of our homes are completely decked out in Steve Rogers originals because I like 'em better."
"Ooh! Nice one, Pete!" Tony called from his perch on the back porch of their Irish cottage, laughing as Peter landed another snowball directly in the middle of Steve's chest. He had declined their offer to join them, preferring to watch from his spot by the fire pit where it was nice and warm rather than be out there slogging through the ankle-deep snow. The snow had started the day before, a rarity in December for this part of Ireland, but very much welcomed by Peter and Steve, who for some reason both loved the white, fluffy stuff. Tony had personally seen enough snow growing up in New York to last three lifetimes, one of the main reasons why he'd originally moved so much of Stark Industries out to California after taking it over. But as much as he hated to admit it, both Steve and Peter were New Yorkers to the bone, and Tony had a strong feeling that there was nothing he could do about it.
To Steve’s delight, Tony blushed, for at least the third time that evening.  Apparently Peter hadn't been exaggerating too much when he’d told him that Tony found him attractive.
"Yeah, okay, but that still doesn't solve our problem here," said James. "How's Thor supposed to get the tesseract off of Earth without a flyable ship?"
"Hardly," said JARVIS. "Oh, and Captain Rogers reports that he and Mr Thor have retrieved Master Peter and are en route back to the Tower."
"I think it would help if you talk to Tony about it, though," Sam said gently. "I know you think he's under too much stress to want to deal with your problems, but, Steve, I can tell you that it's more stressful for him to know that you're hurting, but not know why. 'Cause then all he can do is guess until you tell him, and his guesses are always gonna be worse than reality."
"Lech Walesa," Peter said proudly. He and Uncle Bucky had just finished a really good book the other day on Poland's recovery from WWII, one that had discussed the Solidarity Movement at great length. Like Papa, Uncle Bucky was fascinated with history, and Peter really enjoyed working on all of his Decathlon topics with the two of them.
"Steve, I honestly don't know," said Sam. "The stones, that goofy HYDRA drug you guys all got, who knows? Probably some combination of all of it."
Tony said gently as the reporter launched into yet another monologue about the mysteries of the Wakandan nation, complete with brightly-coloured cringey slideshow graphics. "I know you're tired, and this isn't helping anything. No one knows enough about Wakanda to even make a semi-educated guess about what happened, so this is really just a waste of our time."
And it was working. Uncle Sam's broken seatbelts aside, so far all of Peter's mishaps had happened in the privacy of his own home, and not on a crowded street surrounded by people.
"Try not to worry too much," Ma said as she walked Steve and Tony to the door. "The boy will be just fine."
“Well, aren’t the two of you guys lookin’ all snazzy,” Sam said as he and Bucky stepped forward.  He shook both Steve and Tony’s hands, adding, “There’s no way in hell this isn’t gonna go down.”
"We just have to make sure that he knows there's still hope," Tony said. "Mr Jarvis used to tell me that hope was always stronger than fear, and… while I never believed him back then… as long as Pete knows there's still a chance, then—"
“Um…”  Tony’s fingers tighten around Steve’s shoulder as he burrows impossibly closer.  “I know this probably isn't the best time to be asking this, but—”
To Peter's surprise, it was Uncle Sam and Auntie Nat waiting for him once school was over instead of his dads. Peter's heart leapt into his throat at the sight of them, partially because he still wasn't used to seeing Auntie Nat with her platinum blonde hair.
You guys, I am so thrilled with how much you’re enjoying this fic!  Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments! ♥️
Peter frowned, holding out his hands. "It's a bit hard to explain. I know I don't exactly look it, but I'm—I'm really, really strong. And sticky. I can climb walls and stuff, so—"
"She can't babe, 'cause it's right here," said Tony. He pointed to one of the lines on the screen with a shaking hand, with Steve's blood turning to ice as he saw it.
Peter shuddered as another bolt shot down his spine, the electronic wobble increasing. "Dad, please! This isn't good! You've gotta—!"
And yet, Tony needed to leave a legacy for his son, as Obie often pointed out.  Just like Howard had for him.
“Hey there, girl,” Steve said as he picked her up, rubbing the top of her head as he hurried over to his window.  He’d managed to avoid looking up at Stark Tower all weekend, and the contrast between now and last Friday, when he’d been filled with nothing but disdain and anguish as he’d studied the tall building, was not lost on him.
—Tony attempted to turn his attention back to his workstation, where JARVIS' blinking cursor sat patiently waiting. There was only about an hour or so left in the patrol and he was hoping to get Phillips to sign off on the simulator protocols so he could start implementing them ASAP.
He trailed off as Anthony suddenly burst through the door, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose and clutching his usual mess of papers.
" He leaned back, cupping Tony's face in his hands. "But even so, after everything we've seen and been through over the years, can you honestly say that there's no possible chance you could make this work?"
"Yes. Yes, it does, thank you, Tony, I really appreciate it. And I'll be sure the Board doesn't disturb your team retreat. To a private, luxury villa in Italy. Yeah."
Papa shifted the truck into park and turned towards Peter, placing a hand on his shoulder, his knuckles covered in scrapes and bruises from his boxing workout the previous day.
Especially since Tony was going to be stuck on the ground trying to coordinate the mission pretty much by himself. Even with Colonel Phillips there with him, Steve did not want Tony in any more danger than was absolutely necessary. Once he and Carol made it through the atmospheric barrier and out into space they would be relatively safe, their only concern being to ensure that the tesseract and the satellites were deployed correctly. The real battles would be taking place in Langaran airspace and on Langaran soil, making proper support and protection a necessity. Aside from Tony and Peter's safety, there were potentially going to be a lot of frightened civilians once everything began, and Steve absolutely did not want to cause a panic.
And that was just Peter. Add in everything that had happened to Steve since he'd been pulled from the ice, and… well… it was no wonder that no one ever got a decent night's sleep in the penthouse.
"I don't think we've ever stopped, sweetheart," Steve said with a laugh. He leaned down, pecking Tony quickly on the lips. "Which is just fine with me, by the way."
“Yes, sir,” Pepper said as she began matching his strides down the hallway, the mug cradled in his hands.  “However, I do need to inform you that you have—”
"I'm gonna give you back to your dad now, kiddo, okay?" Rhodey said. "Promise me that you'll take it easy?"
"Pete? Buddy, you stay with me!" Tony called over the comm as Steve snuck a glance up, pride flaring in his chest as he watched Peter execute a perfect landing onto Tony's back. A wide open, fairly treeless plain didn't exactly play to Peter's strengths as Spider-Man, but Steve knew that his boy would be okay as long as he stuck close to one of their team members.
They found George and Gwen Stacy in Peter's room, just where Steve had left them. As soon as they stepped inside, George Stacy shot to his feet, explaining that Peter's vital signs hadn't wavered in the slightest while they were gone.
Ever since he and Natasha discovered the old SHIELD bunker deep beneath the ground at Camp LeHigh, and he realised that the enemy he fought so hard to eliminate from the Earth was not only alive, but
“My math’s never off, and you know it,” Tony stated.  He twisted out of Obie’s grasp, rubbing at the tingling spot on his shoulder.  “And in case you’ve forgotten,
"To counteract transmission blockers," Tony said. "Yeah, I know what you're talking about. That thing's ancient."
"And what if it is?" Sam asked. "Could that help explain the weird space thing that happened a few days ago?"
"Definitely wouldn't put it past 'em," Tony answered bitterly. "It's very, very unlikely that someone would find out about it, but still…"
, and it had been so long since Steve had met anyone who wasn't wearing some kind of invisible mask that he'd almost forgotten what it was like.
Tony frowned. "That's a bit weird, isn't it? I mean, it's not like I'm gonna complain that you were only shot at once during a six-hour patrol, but that doesn't happen very often, does it?"
Following the crowd off the ferry, Peter shuffled towards a row of novelty shops, ducking down behind the largest one and heading for the rocky shoreline. There he stripped out of his clothes, quickly downing the last of his Powerade before pulling out his web shooters and the repulsors. Then he buried the backpack underneath a couple of heavy rocks and pulled on his mask, allowing the adjustable eye frames to widen so he could get a visual on the prison.
Tony playfully rolled his eyes, ruffling Peter's hair as Happy stepped onto the plane looking concerned.
"Mmm. And you're sure that you wanna go?" Tony asked. He was already mentally calculating the range of the defence drones, making sure they could cover the distance between the Tower and the museum.
Exactly half an hour later, the Stark duo descended from their floors and walked towards the hall. Bucky and Steve looked at their respective better half and literally drooled. Tasha was wearing a
Her breathing became labored again, hitching and cracking at the end and her whole body started shaking. Her vision clouding again and faces of the doctors resurfaced back. The voice laced back into her mind. Tony and Bucky were no longer by her side and the pain shot through her again. The whirring of the machine came back, her mind muffled again. The boy and the man disappeared and it became blank, the pieces that came back dusted off again, Tasha's knees buckled and she fell to the ground, her eyes in tears.
Ya izuchal tebya s teh por, kak poyavilis' novosti o tvoyem dugovom reaktore. - I have been studying you since news of your arc reactor appeared.
Tony clutched the end of Jarvis's pants, smothering his face into the soft cotton fabric hiding his tears effectively. Jarvis's sighed and held Tony at arms length before crouching down and trying to look at Tony's eyes. "Anthony, please look up.." Jarvis asked softly but Tony immediately shook his head and still bowed his head, looking at the grass, at his shoes, at Jarvis's polished shoes, anywhere but at Jarvis's face. Jarvis sighed again and brought his index finger and thumb and prompted Tony to lift his head, and after a few cajoling, Tony looked up. His eyes were red rimmed, snot was flowing from his nose and Tony hiccuped the remains of his outburst.
” “Resulting in several suicide bombers, Pepper and the President…but what has it got to do with HYDRA?” “
As months went by, the four of them became even closer, taking turns to sleepover at ones house, finishing their homework and then sprawled together to watch a movie or just simply gossip. Steve and Tony got closer too, going to each others house when Scar or Bucky was out of town, ultimately both of them developing crushes on each other. "Scar, is it normal to like a guy?" Tony asked one day as they were hanging out in Scar's backyard. The quad just finished doing their homework and Steve and Bucky had to go back since they had a family issue to settle. Scar turned towards him with an amused smile "Of course it is, why're you asking?" she asked and Tony fidgeted with the hem of his shirt "I meant like...crush..on a boy, is it normal? Am I weird?" he asked her softly and Scar crawled over to him and used her fingers to lift his face "Hey, it's absolutely normal. And even if you like guys, I'll never treat you any different, you're still my best friend, Tones" she said supporting him and Tony's eyes watered and he all but flew into her arms and breathed in her calming strawberry scent whispering 'thank you' into her warm skin.
Tony internally apologized to Steve and then got out of the car and ran to the black handbag. He took the bag and went bag to his car and drove back to Stark Towers. Reaching Stark Towers, Tony quietly crept to the back entrance which connects to the private elevator that goes to two places, one being his penthouse and one is his lab. Tony didn’t build a lab back in the compound so that he could have more time to spend with his family.
Okruzhayushchaya territoriya okhranyayetsya. Derzhat' ogon' - The surrounding area is guarded. Hold fire.
"Tony, you are the most generous person I have ever met. The amount of love and care you give to this team, always amazes me. You've been there for everyone, helped them to get back in their lives. You helped me get used to the 21st century, even after the fights and the heartbreak, you still came by my side, you've been in my corner ever since. You're my partner, my best friend, my home and most importantly, my soulmate."
" "What the hell....." The hologram was filled with mission reports, medical files and tones of victim profiling but all were in Russian. "J, translate" "
"Even though you can never get rid of the ups and downs completely, you’ve been my cushion to help smooth out the hard times..."
3.Tsel' priobretena. Oruzhiye zadeystvovano. Potentsial'naya ugroza ustranena. - Target acquired. Weapons involved. Potential threat eliminated.
The bomb went off even before Tony finished his sentence. Where once the scenery was a nice quiet diner, now it was destroyed. Broken windows, pieces of the diner walls pilled onto each other, damaged ceilings and lights and burning paintings filled Tony's vision. A faint stench of blood entered his nostrils making him look down, under those damages, bodies, dead and injure bodies stuck under the tones and thousands of concrete. With a still ringing ear, Tony helped himself up and made his way through the damage and helped up a few of the customers. He turned around and saw Steve helping the other half of the customers from under the concrete wedged between two seats. Sam and Bucky carried dead bodies and their waitress, Lynn was one of the bodies.
" "Thanks, J" Tony dragged the suit behind him and reached the rental store. "Hey, is it possible to get a rental car at this hour?" Tony asked the girl at the desk and only got a jerk of a thumb at a general direction and a pop sound of a bubble gum. "Umm, thanks I suppose" and only got a grunt as a reply to that " So much for a friendly town..." he muttered. Tony walked to the general direction pointed and finally chose a newly refurbished Audi Q2, swiped his card at the machine, packed his suit into the trunk and drive off to the motel. On the way, Tony stopped at a electronic shop and bought a second hand phone and laptop and continued to the motel. Reaching the motel, he swiped his card to pay for the room he booked and tipped the hotel staff to carry the suitcase with his armor inside to his room. "Earlier today, a terrorist bombing is seen at upstate New York. Several building has been collapsed with its occupants still inside. Death tolls are increasing by minute. The cause and the reason behind the bombing is still unknown. After the last two attacks at New York Marble Cemetery and Stark Towers, Pentagon and U.S military are at high look out." Tony stopped in his tracks and looked at the news gaping
"It's time I come clean to you..." Tony started and the rest of his family started joining in the conversation, even Dodger and Figaro walked towards him and curled up near his feet."I...I'm not the only child..." Tony continued and Steve asked "But-" and Tony immediately cut him off "But it was not in any of my SHIELD file. I know. Howard made sure that only I was his child. His only child to inherit his company and...other things. In a way, I'm happy because that meant my sister did not get his alcoholism and attitude." Tony said with a sad smile. Steve gently squeezed his shoulder to continue. "So yeah, I'm not the only one. I had a sister, my twin sister, Natasha Maria Stark or as I call her Tasha. Both of us were...very close. We did almost everything together, from having the same interest in Engineering to the same PJ's at night...that close. She...she was my savior, my guardian angel, my
Steve kneeled there like a statue holding Tony's dead body, tears streaming through his cheeks and dripping on top of Tony's pale face as if his drop of tear will be enough to replenish Tony's sun-kissed tanned skin color back, it didn't. Shouts of his teammates to get back and leave the medics to do their jobs left unheard by his ears, the voices far too distant. It was until a warm metallic hand landed on his shoulder, Steve jerked back to reality and the comforting weight of Tony's body has disappeared from his arms. Reflex kicked into his body, and he jerked his shoulder in a sharp movement but the grip was strong, Steve squirmed and retaliated to get loose, but his efforts were at vain. "-eve! Knock it off! Let the medics do their job!" Bucky ordered in a harsh tone. Steve whipped his head at the voice and confronted steely grey eyes "Knock it of Steve, Tony's gonna be alright, Bruce brought his back up arc reactor that he kept for situations like this." Bucky tried to explain. It took a long time for the words to settle in Steve's mind but once he did, he blinked a few times and exhaled a deep breath that he did not know he was keeping. Wrong move. Dark spots danced infront of his eyes and the voices became slurred, exhaustion and pain rippling through his body like a tidal wave, and without a warning, Steve passed out in Bucky's arms. Nat ran towards Steve and barked at the nearest medic to bring another stretcher. "Nat-" Bucky started but she cut him off "Not now, Barnes." she told with a hard voice. Steve was brought to the MedBay in the Avenjet while Tony was immediately rushed to the nearest medical center. Hooking Steve up to the HRM monitor and inducing Odensetron drips into Steve's blood system, the rest of the of the team gathered at the meeting cabin in the jet. Seats were taken but the atmosphere was thick in tension. Each and every one of the member seething in anger and worry for their leaders. Nat, who was quiet since treating Steve at the MedBay, suddenly slammed her fist hard enough, that if she was a super soldier, the tabled would have cracked into two "Wilson. Barnes. Talk." she stared at them with murderous glare. Seeing so much resentment in her eyes, in the love of his life's eyes, directed at him for the very first time, shuddered him and he remained silent the whole long Sam took to explain. "-and she just left. Leaving Tony to die." Sam finished explaining. The silence blanketed the room again. "So, we have two missions to finish. One, destroy the new HYDRA technological weapons and two, take Yelena out." At that Bucky jerked his head up with a shocked face "What do you mean take her out?" Bucky asked "I mean kill her" "You can't do-" "And why can't we kill her?!" "She is Tony's sister-" "Who left him to die!" "She was mind controll-" "Bullshit! Don't tell me that they mind washed her until she has no humanity in her?!" "You don't know the feelin-" "Mind washed and being sterilized is the same damn thing!" "She is still a human under that!" "SHE. KILLED. STEVE. AND. TONY! ISN'T THAT PROVE ENOUGH?!" "SHE IS STILL HIS SISTER!" "I DON'T CARE!" "And I thought you wanted to clear your ledger." Bucky taunted her. "Killing another innocent girl isn't gonna prove that!" Bucky screamed. "Innocent? She is innocent?! She killed more than 50 people in one day!" "She is mind controlled! Don't you understand the term mind washed at all, Romanoff?!" Bucky counterattacked with a hard glare. Nat stared back but her eyes softened "Why...why do you care...?" "Because..because...I owe her...atleast...this.." "Why?" "I...she...we.." Bucky gave up with a sigh but Nat continued "Tell me why, and I'll reconsider" she went back to all business talk and Bucky slumped onto a chair like a puppet whose string got cut off "She..and I...we..we were dating..back when we...were at the facility..she..she was the only...source of sanity...I could go to...when they erased...my mind..she..she was the only person I could remember..no matter how many..times they erased my memories.." Bucky was sobbing and tears fell against his cheeks, Nat remained silent "Why lie?" Nat asked with a voice so soft "I..I didn't wanna lose you..so.." "Well you just did. Goodbye, Barnes." and Nat stormed off of the room. Bucky hunched over himself and cried.
"Hey" someone greeted as Scar was busy arranging her books in her locker. Scar took a deep breath, closed her eyes and opened them again. She purposely slammed the locker door and looked at him with a raised eyebrow 'What do you want?" she asked harshly and Steve winced "Just wanted to ask, where is Tony?" and Scar looked at him in a weird expression "Seriously? No, like seriously? Now you care? After like what four years of being M.I.A now you wanna know about Tony?" she asked crossing her arms. Steve shuffled his feet and fidgeted in his place "I mean...he isn't at school for more than two weeks, and that's not him at all-" Scar cut him "Oh. So you think you know him better now? You went missing for four years, you idiot! Maybe he changed! Maybe he changed and didn't want to come to school! Maybe he has issues in his house that he doesn't wanna come to school! Maybe
, Steve smiled fondly at the thought before he got pulled to a routine workout by Bucky at the gym, a few floors below.
"It's still ten years-" "Your bestfriend came out okay and alive, why can't my brother?" "Bucky came back but he isn't the same!" "So, it's okay for you to get your Bucky back changed or not and it's not for me to get my brother back?! Are you crazy?! Or just plain selfish?!" "He won't even remember you-" "Bucky barely knew your name! He still calls you Steve instead of Stevie for God sake!" "Don't!" "Why? It hurts doesn't it?! To call out?! You called me out on the whole operation shit show when you would have done the same thing, without thinking twice! Don't bullshit me, Rogers!" and both Ahana and Steve are up and breathing at each other's face, red with anger, both with their fist clenched. "Why do you even care? You called it off-" "BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS DEAD! I KNEW BECAUSE J WAS READING ME THE VITALS AND THE VITALS STOPPED! I KNEW MY BROTHER WAS DEAD THE MINUTE THE SUIT WAS CRUSHED LIKE A FUCKING TIN CAN!-" "AND YOU STILL CALLED IT OFF!" "WHY DO YOU CARE?!" "BECAUSE I LOVED HIM!" Steve bellows and the whole kitchen now silent, the wolf also startled awake and looking at them with concern. "Yeah?" Ahana huffs with no mirth at all "Cause maybe love isn't all that is needed to save a loved one" and she silently walks to her room, the wolf quietly padding behind her.
Letting Tasha go, Bucky wrapped his metal arm around her waist while Tony wrapped his arm around the other side of her waist. "Tasha, meet our family, the Avengers" the rest of the team smiled welcomingly as Steve came forward and hugged her. Tasha stiffened before melting into his arms "Welcome back, Tasha" Steve whispered into her ears and pulled away after giving her a light kiss on her forehead. Tasha smiled, and Tony lost his breath, that was the Tasha smile, the real and genuine one. One by one the members of the team, introduced themselves and soon enough Tasha warmed up to them. Her mind was still hazy but she was okay, she had her brother and the love of her life back by her side.
" JARVIS answered and Peter snickered at how he addressed his Pops. When Dad eventually created his very first A.I, he programmed it to be Captain Rogers, since Pops was a football captain back when he was in high school. "Okay" Peter agreed and sprinted towards his bedroom to finish his latest project, the brand new Web Shooters. After a few hours, there was a light knock on his door, and Peter looked up at the clock to see that 3 hours has already gone and he scrambled off to open the door and saw that his Dad was waiting outside "What are you doing there, Pete? We've been calling you for the past half an hour" Tony looked at him with a raised eyebrow "Sorry, Dad, I was doing the Web Shooters for our upcoming science fair, sorry" Peter sheepishly told while rubbing the back of his head. His Dad laughed and then tugged him to his side and the duo walked down the stairs to the kitchen "How, about we eat finish and both of us finish those web shooters at my lab. Whatcha say?" Tony cajoled and Peter looked at him and nodded.
Buckling his mask over his face, Steve glanced down at his drawing, sucking in as deep of a breath as he could.
Before he can ask Tony to clarify, Tony starts to laugh.  “Wow, I just realised how completely weird that must’ve sounded,” he says.  “Happy and Pepper are friends of mine.  They’ve known Pete almost his entire life, and he thinks of ‘em as like an honorary uncle and aunt.  They used to go to all of his soccer games and stuff, and they work only a few blocks away from Pete’s school, so if worse comes to worse, they said they could pick him up and bring him here for me.”
"Yeah, well, that's different," Ned insisted as he ate another chip. "You and I don't usually hang out once practise is done, so—"
"I guess it does make sense," he finally admitted. "I'd already been thinking that the reason why HYDRA hasn't tried to nail any of the rest of us yet is 'cause we've been so off-track with our searches."
"Oh," Peter got out just before she kissed him again, lingering as long as Peter dared to right in front of her house.
"'It is your duty to obey!'" Natasha said. "Steve, that guy sounds pretty shocked, I doubt this has ever happened before."
Heaving a heavy sigh, Tony tipped his head back against the couch, closing his eyes and kneading his temples. "It was the same night as that whole mess at the theatre, which is the main reason why I didn't say anything at the time. That day was already bad enough without adding something else to the mix."
"Well, I'm sitting here, aren't I? And the job is finished, so it seems as though I was a pretty decent choice."
Tony cut off as he came, spilling over Steve's hand as he thrust up into Tony's body once, twice, three times before his climax slammed into him like a freight train, and he cried out his release into Tony's shoulder as Tony collapsed against him. With the last vestiges of his strength, Steve carefully eased them back against his pillows, tucking Tony's head under his chin.
"No, Papa, it's okay. I don't mind sitting here with Dad for a while if you wanna go eat," Peter said. "Uncle Sam had just gotten back from running when I left to come over here, so he'll probably be ready to eat too."
"That's fine with me." Steve stepped forward, curling his arms around Tony's waist as he pressed a firm kiss to his lips. "Do you wanna try and go back to sleep now?"
Tears stung Tony's eyes, and he quickly swiped them away. Why the hell would he even think that the military would care at all about what he was going through?
Which is just silly, because the scar on his chest isn’t even that noticeable.  Certainly not the gross thing that Dad makes it out to be.
if his deep, sexy-as-hell Captain's voice wasn't making it nearly impossible for Tony to maintain some semblance of cool. "The Avengers do not take kindly to being attacked, Mr Lang, which is exactly what Mr Pym coerced you into doing. It is only by our good graces that we're not pressing formal charges against you both."
And, dare Steve say, more than a bit smitten with a certain other teammate, despite his repeated assurances back before the war that he was only interested in the gals.
It’s not unheard of for swimmers to try to get into each other’s heads before a race.  Steve’s experienced it probably a hundred times over the course of his career, and he’s always been able to shut them right back out again.
Papa's haunted blue eyes stared up at Peter for several heartbeats as he tried to swallow, no doubt trying to reconcile the garbage HYDRA had been feeding him all this time with the reality that Peter was there, right in front of him.
"Which is absolutely true, bud," said Dad. "And since Pete and I have a ton of experience working together, I'm afraid it's you who's going to have to fall into line, doc."
"My dads taught me to respect authority that deserves respect. And that Nazis are the lowest form of evil imaginable," Peter retorted, noticing that the red-haired girl gave a very obvious flinch at the word Nazi, almost like it physically pained her. "I guess we should've figured it out sooner that it'd be you who would choose to sink that low."
Peter pursed his lips, a sad look marring his sweet, boyish face.  “‘Cause I think Steve might be sick, and I wanted to see if we could help him.”
"This part didn't hurt, sweetheart," Steve said, biting down on his bottom lip. That wasn't exactly the truth, but… "And Peter can't feel anything right now, remember?"
"Yeah, but Erskine wasn't looking for the biggest or the strongest," Tony said with a dismissive shrug. "Or at least that's what Howard always said whenever he talked about it."
“Well, we’ve been known to play a round of golf or two on occasion, Colonel,” Obie said, giving Rhodey such a fake chuckle that Tony felt his blood pressure spike.  “But I’m not sure you can call us
"Good grief, Pete!" Dad exclaimed, rolling his eyes. "You know damn well that I'm never too busy for you! Especially for something as important as that!"
“Oh yeah, I’m sure,” Peter said.  He reached into his pocket for his wallet, pulling out his credit card and handing it to Steve.  “Like I said, my dad doesn't mind when I buy books.”
He supposed he shouldn't have been as surprised as he was, given who his dads were. But in the two weeks since he woke up from his coma—
But despite the cold—and the accompanying lack of a warm, sandy beach—Tony had to admit that the trip had been one of Steve's better ideas. December had been a busy month, filled with local and regional Decathlon competitions, a holiday dance at school—which Steve had been thrilled about, since he'd missed the last one thanks to HYDRA—more weekend training sessions, and Christmas, which the team had all spent up at the Compound, just as they had for Thanksgiving. Memories of the fiasco that had been the team's Christmas morning gift-giving still made Tony both smile and shake his head. It was amazing to him how a group of adults—and three teenagers—could instantly transform into a bunch of over-excited schoolchildren at the mere sight of a massive Christmas tree piled high with brightly-wrapped gifts.
"Hello, Peter!" Mr Stacy called as he poked his head out the window to wave in their direction, with Gwen heaving a sigh. "Nice to see you!"
"Yeah, I just saw him yesterday when I brought Riley's stuff out to Erin. I think he's six months now? Something like that. Looks just like Riley too, poor kid."
"What the hell's the matter with you this morning?" Ned asked as they arrived in the classroom. "You're so jumpy you're acting like you've never been to school before!"
Ned let out a chuckle. "Yeah, I guess that's one way to look at it. Even though the Soviet Union was made up of a bunch of different countries, and we were just one."
the Chitauri!" stated Uncle Clint. "But I thought Tony blew 'em all to hell, so where the hell'd they come from?"
It was long, tedious work, made even worse by the fact that Peter couldn't seem to keep his tired eyes open for longer than about fifteen minutes at a time. It wasn't until after he'd eaten dinner and taken yet another short nap that he managed to finally stumble upon a coding line that didn't seem to fit with his usual methodology. Dad had always told Peter that every person who wrote code had their own rather unique "coding language", kind of like how each person's handwriting was just a bit different from everyone else's, and there was one line inserted about thirty lines from the bottom that on second glance, just didn't seem to fit.
"Oh, don't worry, Captain Rogers," Ned said eagerly. "I'll make sure Peter's out here waiting with me, just in case he forgets or something."
"I could do it," Tony said quickly, causing Steve's head to snap up in surprise. He opened his mouth to protest, and was immediately greeted with Tony's don't-argue-with-me-babe frown. "I've still got a few favours saved up, let me see what I can do."
"Okay, so maybe destruction's not the direction we try and take," said Bruce. "Like Tony implied with his testimonial about the arc reactor, maybe the way to go is to try and somehow repel the effects of the stones."
"Tony," Steve said as he reached for Tony's hand, planting a quick kiss on his forehead. "Is Peter all right?"
"Now, I know what you're gonna say," Peter said as his nanotech helmet disappeared, revealing his messy mop of curls. "But I just—"
"As long as it works," Peter reminded him. "But if it doesn't work JARVIS should be able to tell you as soon as you test it out."
"We're at forty percent," Howard said, his eyes glued on the dials in front of him. "Fifty… sixty… seventy… that's eighty percent…"
Then came Tony and Peter's extended hospital stays after the battle against Stane and Killin, and their Aminacin-enhanced army down in Miami. That horrible time when Steve feared that he might lose them both in one fell swoop.
Unfortunately, most of the answers he'd ended up getting had only led into more questions, and with how exhausted Sarah had sounded on the phone Steve hadn't wanted to press her too much. Her arthritic pain had been bothering her a lot more than she'd wanted to admit, but being the proud, fiery lady that she was, Steve was loath to push her to get more help out of fear of alienating her. The last thing he needed in his suddenly upside-down life was for his ma to be angry with him.
"Oh, but Captain America has such dreamy eyes!" piped up another girl, one of Cindy's friends. "And that dimple when he smiles? I mean, God! Iron Man is so lucky, it's really not fair!"
Where would he and Peter be, if it weren't for Steve? How would they have survived out there in the middle of that desert? Or in the Malibu house as it was being bombed? Or down in mad Killian's bunker?
“No, I’m fine,” Papa said, his voice laced with the fear he was trying so hard to hide.  He had agreed to volunteer for this test way back when Dad first told them about it, and hadn’t wavered at all in that conviction during the months of research and development that Dad had poured into the project.  One he had named Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing.
"Well, from the sounds of it, he tried to do the same thing he did to Barton here," said Tony, way too nonchalantly for Steve's taste. "Only it didn't work, so then he got all pissed off and threw me out the window."
“Shh, baby, it’s okay,” Tony whispered as he kissed the top of Steve’s spine, right below his neck.  “I promise I’ll go slow.”
"Actually, I believe it's due more to my learning processor, sir," said JARVIS. "But yes, I am indeed grateful."
"You may regret that," said Dr Strange, laced with arrogance. "Your technomage brought you face-to-face with a Master of the Mystic Arts."
Steve thought as he added a banana and a bottle of water to the plate of three sandwiches. But even as he thought it, he knew it was unlikely. Tony had been keeping pretty close tabs on Scott ever since they had paid off his back child support over a year ago, and from everything they had seen, he, his daughter, his wife, and her new husband seemed to all get along well. Scott had even had a new lady friend himself, a woman named Hope, who had also been reported missing by the former Mrs Lang.
"I'm still not okay with just sitting here until he turns the thing on though," Tony said firmly. "We need—"
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t hesitate to hit that kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Yes we did, but I also said that no pressure is too much when it comes to you and Peter," Steve said with a frown. He planted a quick kiss on Tony's head before returning his attention to the screen, hoping Tony would get the hint and drop the subject. He really wasn't in the mood to rehash their entire argument, especially since he knew they would just end up going round and round again and wouldn't actually get anywhere.
Steve let out a chuckle as he curled his arm around Tony's shoulders, planting a quick kiss on his temple. "Yeah, it has. And I have to admit, it was kinda nice seeing that kid panic a bit when Thor got into his face. He hasn't been very nice to Peter."
With a soft groan of frustration, Steve digs into his pocket for his keys and quietly unlocks the bottom drawer of his desk.  Reaching inside to the very back, he pulls out a polished wooden box and places it on his lap.  After turning so his back is facing his dividing wall, Steve unlocks the box and raises the lid, his heart skipping a beat as his eyes land on the three gleaming gold medals resting inside, each carefully nestled in its own velvet-lined compartment.
"I dunno, maybe he thought it wasn't that big a deal?" said Peter. "I mean, Mr Stacy is just a regular cop, and Liz was Gwen's friend too, so maybe the FBI agent just thought he was doing Mr Stacy a favour."
"That's 'cause a cheap copy is never as good as the original," Tony said with a sneer as he turned on a dime, huffing with satisfaction as yet another Hammer suit crashed into the side of the bunker.
"You are correct, sir," answered JARVIS. "Master Peter is currently sleeping comfortably, and his vital signs are within his normal parameters."
"So you decided to lie to me instead?" Tony said, scowling. "And force my own son to lie to me for you? Did you even stop to think about what you were doing to Pete?"
caused them both to jump, with Wanda clapping her hands over her ears. "I can't. I just… I'm sorry, but I can't," she murmured, shaking her head. "If they catch me helping someone again then they'll hurt my brother, and I can't let that happen. He's already been through so much trying to protect me. My father—my father made him promise that he would, before—"
"I hope it's okay that I told her she could get some rest," he said as he gestured towards Gwen, who was curled up on Steve's chair, sound asleep with her hand still clutching Peter's. "She's pretty wiped out from everything."
And Papa… Peter always could tell when he was trying to hide how scared he was, even though he knew that Dad and Peter could both see right through him. And he was
"Yeah, but you just said it yourself!" exclaimed Sam. "We're talking hitherto undreamt of destruction here!"
"Uh huh." Peter didn't even look up as she exited the room, his tongue poking out between his teeth as he studied the code he'd just written.
persona, Tony knew that Steve could be damn convincing when he wanted to be, and especially about something that he believed in with every fibre of his being.
"All right, Captain?" Colonel Phillips said as soon as Steve arrived in the hangar. He could see Tony up in the observation room, his beautiful face etched in worry. With the trial space mission behind them there was no more need for Tony to conduct his daily simulator rotations, so he had told Steve that Colonel Phillips had requested him to remain in the hangar during the patrols to ensure that there would be no further problems with the X-302 aircraft.
"Shh, baby, it's okay. I've got you," Tony murmured as he stroked him almost agonisingly slow. He crawled back up Steve's body, pressing their mouths together in a deep kiss. "I'm gonna suck you off now, yeah?" he whispered against Steve's lips. "That sound okay?"
"Why didn't you tell me that Howard Stark was involved with Project Rebirth?" he blurted out, immediately clenching his fists at his sides. Leeway or not, Phillips was still Steve's commanding officer, and lower ranking officers weren't exactly supposed to demand things from their superiors.
"We're just about ready here, babe," Tony said as Peter zipped up his backpack. "Am I driving, or are you?"
“Oh, nah, it should be fine,” Tony says.  “Happy and Pepper said they can always drop Pete off if I get into a jam at work or something, so I don't think it’ll be a problem.”
Not the least of which were Director Fury’s resignation, which had been demanded by the President, and also the complete separation of the Avengers from SHIELD.  Steve was now recognised as the official leader of the Avengers by the U.S. Government, and as such, had been asked by the President to ensure that any and all traces of HYDRA were eliminated from Earth.
Steve shook his head, his tears dripping down to wet Tony's shirt. He attempted to curl his hands into fists, letting out a sharp hiss of pain when he couldn't. "That beam… it would've killed us. It would've killed Bucky and me, and—Tony, I couldn't—I couldn't
“Understood, Captain,” says Thor.  “And I will make sure Banner gets the message as well, once he is no longer big, green, and ugly.”
the wizard had said, right before he'd broken apart like a dead leaf. His eyes, which Tony hadn't much cared to notice at the time, had been filled with sorrow.
Slowly, Steve pushed himself up to his feet, using the headboard as leverage as he placed all of his weight on his right foot. The cast on his left foot was massive, weighing at least ten kilograms with how much hardware was poking out of it. The surgeon had explained that he'd been required to use several of what he called medical pins in order to hold Steve's bones in place while they healed, which were now sticking out of the bright blue plaster in such a way that it made Steve feel sick to his stomach to even look at it. And not to mention the constant prickly feeling he'd had in the foot ever since the surgery from the bones knitting themselves back together. Steve had always hated that tingly, pins-and-needles feeling.
"We broke up after high school" he said, even though the break up was mutual but it still pinched his heart "Oh. What happened?" Tony asked "She wanted to move back to England but I refused to give up my dream so we split." "Where are you going?" "Pratt Institute, you?" "I think my hoodie is kinda obvious, MIT" both of them sat in silence before Tony finished his pie and coffee and stood up "Well, it was nice to meet you, Steve. Hope we'll see each other soon" Tony extended his hands and Steve shook it. Watching Tony walk out of the cafe was like losing him for the second time after elementary school. He was walking towards the back kitchen when Tony called his name "Steve!" and he looked up "Yeah, Tony?" "You...wanna come join me to visit Scar?" Steve's heart fluttered "Of course, Tony" and he dashed out of the cafe, Tony giggling behind him.
" Tony said with a dreadful cold voice. "It was just like any other night, Tasha was up telling me her latest story and we heard a loud bang from the hall downstairs and automatically I scrambled to her side and she tugged me closer and hummed an unknown song, rocking me gently. Heavy footsteps were heard from outside of our room and in mere minutes, Howard slammed the door opened and looked at us with pure rage. His eyes were bloodshot red and he reeked in alcohol stench. He was holding a half filled beer bottle in his right hand and he stood there swaying. He strode his way to the bed, grabbed my arms and flung me to the floor and Tasha fell with me since I was still clinging to her nightgown. He sneered at me saying how useless both of us were. He wanted one alpha like boy but instead he got two weak ones and how I was a Stark and Starks were not supposed to be faggots and all that bullshit. Then he turned to Tasha and said 'I don't know what the fuck you're gonna be but be useful atleast.' and Tasha got pissed of and stood right in front of Howard and sneered back at him in Italian saying that Maria should be more useful when she kept sleeping with Howard's male employees. That was the final straw for Howard and he immediately smashed the beer bottle against the nearest wall and....and....stabbed right at her chest. Blood pooled at her feet and Howard's face was covered in streaks of her blood. Everything happened in slow motion and the last thing I saw before Howard knocked me out was Tasha falling to the ground dead. I woke up the next day to a bed full of my clothes stuffed in it. Jarvis was pacing back and forth packing my clothes. I asked him where were we going and Jarvis stopped and crouched down and told me that Howard was sending me to a boarding school. I asked if Tasha is in hospital if she is when will she be discharged and when can she follow me and to that Jarvis only shook his head and tears flowed out his eyes. That's when I knew that she was gone....forever and that bastard didn't even have a funeral for her. She deserved so much more than just a burial so that night, Jarvis and I creeped out to the nearby mortuary and saw that..he...he burned Tasha's body and kept it in a jar and Jarvis took the jar and drove to the nearest graveyard and gave Tasha the proper burial and said goodbye to her. That was the last I saw her, when we were 12, that's it. That night after the burial, I went to Jarvis's room and asked for a drawing of Tasha, since Howard refused to our family picture. Jarvis was a talented man, and within 1 hour, he gave me a very realistic sketching of Tasha when she was 4 years old. I took it and it was framed and I always hung it nearby my study desk which made it look like she was still watching over me, my guardian angel..." Tony finished with red rimmed eyes.
Once Bucky's gone, Ahana turns to Steve "Hey, about what you said that day..." "Yeah..?" "I'm sorry, I was so worked up on it that I felt so bad I said it" "Nah, it's okay" "And...you have my blessings you know" she says and Steve blushes, rubbing the back of his neck "Thanks, Ahana, it means alot to me" he says and Ahana chuckles "God knows he's been pinning after you for so long, you both deserve each other" she huffs and Steve chuckles "Just...take care of him. I know you won't break his heart, just take care of it an him" she says and Steve hugs her "Thank you, Ahana.... We really love you, sis" he says and pecks her forehead before Ahana shoos him off to the ward.
play. I don't want my father to think that I was lying, anyways, what about yours?" she asked quietly and Tony shrugged "Done that when Tanner was yappin' about the homework just a few minutes ago" Scar shook her head and rolled her eyes fondly as she focused on the current subject.
” JARVIS answered Tony. Tony managed to clear the table somewhat clean and dumped the handbag on the table. “
Harley and Peter stood in front of the three tombstones of auntie Scar, their Dad and their Pops, all peacefully gone from this world, Peter hefted his daughter Carla as he and Harley said their final goodbyes before going on their seperate ways. After Steve died, the condominium and the money were equally distributed to each of their sons and since no one lived in their condominium, the boys decided to auction them and go in their seperate ways, Peter marrying MJ with his two daughters moving to England and Harley and his fiance, Ned moving back to Singapore.
new things and teach them what you know! Plus, having a couple of new friends is an extra benefit!" Jarvis told with a cheery voice and Tony's posture wavered before he softly said "I have you and Ana as my friends..." and Jarvis's eyes softened "Yes, Anthony but here you get to have friends of your age! Maybe you guys can have a sleepover, build robots and whatnot together!" Jarvis said and Tony's eyes brightened in interest and he looked sideways.
"One caramel macchiato with skimmed milk for Ahana!" the Starbucks barista hollers her name and Ahana closes her laptop and ambles her way to the pick-up counter and grabs her coffee and sends a small smile at the barista. Ahana lifts her cup to her lips when she notices a number with a heart at the end, just below the check-box with
And that, that Tony believed and from a far distance felt Tasha's blinding smile and a dust of her blessings.
"Stark!" a Russian voice barks from behind and Ahana boosts up her thrusters and speeds up to the vault, her wolf safely cradled in her arms. "Give me back my dog!" "Fuck you! This is my brother!" she counters and prays hard to get to the vault. The vault is near her when a bomb goes ricocheting off the wall and blasts near her face. Ahana instinctively curls around the wolf and her back takes the hit, sending her careening into the vault by the blast force. "J! Lock the vault!" Ahana screeches and JARVIS immediately bolts up the vault, the bullet proof shielding activated. Ahana breathes a sigh of relieve and slumps to the floor, bullet shots and the Hulk's roar a distant noise. Ahana checks her reflection on the vault's opposite wall and winces when she sees blood trickling out of her head and her back aches like fuck. She slides her eyes to her wolf and sees it panting in the corner, scooting forward and placing a gentle hand on it's fur.
Steve looks at Bucky as he and Natasha carry Ahana away and sighs. His attention then turn to the Iron Man suit, if Ahana wasn't in it, then there must be someone else, and the wolf is gone. Steve slowly pads towards the half bent Iron Man suit and crouches in front of it. "J? Disassemble the suit." he orders and immediately hears a distinct whimper, as the suit opens and reveals a man inside. Steve is momentarily shocked before he gently touches the man and the man's head shoots up, fear in his eyes. Steve inhales sharply and distinctively hears a curse behind him "Tony...?" he asks and the man nods "Who..you?" and Steve cries, hugging the man. The man stiffens before relaxing into his hold, burying his face into Steve's neck. Steve tightens his hold around the man and mutters into his hair. Steve lets go a while later, but keeps his arms loosely around the man "Tones..? I'm Steve, your...your friend, and they" he says as he shows the rest of them "are your family...okay?" he slowly says and Tony nods slowly "St've...?" Tony asks pointing at him and Steve nods, smiling.
I know the Bucky/Natasha Stark relationship is kinda complicated so let me summarize it. Bucky was already at the HYDRA facility when some of the HYDRA soldier brought her in. She grew up with Bucky while Bucky never aged. They became good friends and Bucky will always come looking for Tasha when they mind washed him to keep him sane. Friendship turned to love. Unfortunately, Zemo took over the HYDRA facility from Red Skull and casted Zola, Red Skull's right hand. Zemo trained Natasha and she became loyal to him and Zola, who knew about their relationship mind washed Bucky but implanted the thought of Tasha being the target. When he was following her to kill her, SHEILD found him but he let Tasha go with a bullet to her forhead.
That's how Steve found all the Avengers at different places in the communal floor. The whole mood in the hall was scary and sad. Tony was nowhere to be seen and Steve missed him like a limb. It was wrong for him to charge without listening, heck, giving Tony a chance to placate Tasha but he had so much of adrenaline from the fear Tony is going to get hurt, he kinda fought her of pure rage. Bucky, however, was at the loveseat staring at the view of New York plunging into darkness. Steve took a deep breath and sat beside Bucky. "You okay?" Steve asked "She was right...it's my fault she got stuck with Hydra" Bucky answered him still looking at the view. Steve eyes went wide "Buck, what do you mean?" Steve asked "Because he knew her before. During Hydra" Natasha answered. Bucky remained silent. "How did you know her Buck?" Steve asked him and Bucky took a deep breath looked at Natasha and told Steve "It was a week or two after they brainwashed me when they brought her. She was a kid at that moment and she was bleeding profusely. The doctors at the facility tried to get rid of the glass pieces out from her chest but it didn't work cause there was still a few tiny ones inside her so they had to cut open her chest and add a barrier to avoid the glass pieces to pierce into her heart. They inserted a metal chestpiece that is thick enough to prevent that and stitched back her chest and for months they did the same process they did to me to her....but...but...she was just a kid....and until now her screams still haunt me....they'd beat her up if she slipped her words and starved her to death if she did a mission wrongly. Yeah, she started going for missions the moment they brainwashed her. Then we were introduced to each other for a mission and that's when we got close. She'd tell bits and pieces of her memory and I use to tell mine...she grew up I never did and the friendship we had....kinda bloomed into love...we didn't kiss or had sex but it was a mutual feeling both of us had. And then it happened, you guys came to rescue me and she grabbed my hands and pleaded to not leave her alone and I promised her that I won't and left her....in the cell...and ran after you. And I tried and tried to tell you that there is another person inside but you all refused to listen to me before....you knocked me out...and I left her alone" Bucky finished. Natasha took a sharp breath and exited the compound without telling and Steve covered his head in his hands and cried.
It might've been easier for Tony to ask for the moon. Or for the military leaders to overlook their massive prejudice against his family and allow Peter to have his surgery.
"At least come and sit down then, yeah?" he said. "You've been pacing back and forth so much I'm surprised there's not already a path worn into the floor."
"That's 'cause you're stronger than they are, bud," Tony murmured. "You're way stronger than any of those assholes."
This attack brought the total to three which was scary enough, especially since this one had almost triggered Uncle Bucky as well. But now they also had to deal with the fact that Peter had very likely revealed his identity to Gwen's father, who as far as they knew still had orders to arrest the vigilante known as Spider-Man on sight.
"Have a nice day, Mr Lang," Tony said, effectively ending the conversation. As soon as Lang disappeared with the guard, Tony slumped against Steve's side, closing his eyes as Steve's arm wrapped around his shoulders.
"I'll go and grab 'em!" Peter exclaimed before Tony could even look in his direction, and then was racing out of the lab a second later. Tony stood back, still holding the air canister as Bucky looked up at him again, a tentative curiosity in his eyes.
His gaze locked on the shield, Steve clenched his jaw, slowly curling his fingers in towards his palms. Then he readied his stance, huffing out three short, sharp breaths before slamming his right fist directly into the white centre star. The pain in his hands and fingers, which had dulled down a bit during his break, immediately skyrocketed to stratospheric levels, nearly causing Steve to keel over as he quickly drove his left fist into the star, the audible
"Okay, Scott, just run through it for us again, yeah?" Tony asked, indicating Scott's so-called Quantum Tunnel that was shoved into the cab of his ugly-ass brown van. The van was currently parked directly underneath the huge A embossed on the Compound's outside wall, almost the same exact place where Tony and Steve conducted Peter's first ever driving lesson. "What exactly did old man Pym tell you about this thing?"
Not exactly what Peter would call inconspicuous, but at least they knew better than to try and talk to him.  Especially when he was grumpy.
"Holy shit!" he exclaimed, fighting to keep his eyes open as he raced along what could only be described as parallel warp trails, arriving at his pre-calculated coordinates before he'd even had time to take another breath. As soon as he stopped, Tony blinked, then blinked again, not quite believing what he was seeing.
"I'm on it, Captain," Carol replied as she aimed directly for the top of the ship, barrelling through it three times like it was made of nothing but clay. The guns instantly ceased their firing, drooping back against the hull of the ship like a bunch of thick, wet noodles as the whole thing tilted sideways, finally crashing against the distant Wakandan mountains.
Steve smiled, that gorgeous, eye-crinkling, dimple-inducing smile that had been so rare lately that the sight of it almost brought tears to Tony's eyes. Why the hell hadn't
She had also told Steve that O'Brien didn't hesitate at all to "reluctantly take control" of the government when the massive explosion that took Joseph Rogers's life, along with thousands of others, also took the life of both the civilian Langaran president and his top military general, General Hammond.
decided to play God for him and stopped talking to him! MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANNA SEE YOUR FACE!" Scar all but screamed at his face and Steve flinched at her tone. Scar was heaving with heavy breath, arms crossed and posture rigid and then she sighed and slumped "Leave us alone Rogers, just..just go away" Scar told him off silently and brushed past him to class. Steve stayed there, head hung, tears streaming down his cheeks, dropping on the floor, drop by drop. "What's wrong, darling?" Peggy asked and Steve looked up at her with red rimmed eyes and just rested his forehead on her shoulder and cried his heart out. Later, Steve got to know that both Scar's and Tony's parents were killed in a car crash when the four of them were attending a company gala.
Kakim-to obrazom mne prishlos' sygrat', kak eto sdelal Obi, ya govoril po-angliyski, zamenil Obi na menya! - Somehow I had to play, as Obi so, I spoke English, replaced Obi with me
Ahana chuckles "I'll take that as a yes, then" and scratches the wolf's ears and it rumbles like a train. "You're like a big puppy, baby boy" she teases and switches her phone on and scrolls through her contacts until she reaches
At Stark Towers, Steve made his way through the rubble with a heavy heart. The other Avengers came down and helped him look for Tony. Bucky walked by his side and placed his arms on his shoulder in an attempt to give some comfort. After a few hours, there was no sign of Tony's body or of his armor and Steve sat down on a piece of stray rubble and curled into himself with tears flowing down his cheeks.
Steve beams and claps loudly. It's almost five years since they got married but Steve will never ever get bored with his husband's achievement. Colonel Rhodey then steps up onto the stage with a glass trophy "As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark." and Tony saunters onto the stage with a sense of pride and an aura of life around him. He shook Rhodey's hands and hugged the girl behind him before stepping in front to deliver his thank you speech. His eyes roamed and settled on his husband, sitting at the VIP table smiling at him and Tony beamed back at him. "Yeah, yeah, yeah, umm.. thanks Rhodes and Irine for this award, uhh this is perfect for me because I love my job and I love protecting people and I'm crazy about inventing stuff, and..uh, I prefer people who love what I do. So, thanks to all that voted me and thanks to all that supported my work and most importantly, thanks to my lovely, beautiful husband. Thanks babe for being there with me through everything and supporting me and encouraging me and loving me. This is for you" Tony raised his trophy towards Steve as he ended his speech and walked down the stairs. Tony took the seat beside Steve and kissed his cheeks before Steve turned his head for a proper kiss. "I'm proud of you, you know?" Steve whispered and Tony nodded but then tapped his watch, indicating they will be late for the next event. Bidding their goodbyes, the couple headed towards Macy's Hospital to visit new mother Pepper Potts-Hogan.
Instinctively Steve smiled, already running through possibilities through his head of how he might ask Anthony out when a thought suddenly occurred to him.
because of you and your treasonous cronies!  Good, honest people who were serving in one of the most dangerous places on Earth because they believed in something better, and you and your General West literally took a shit on ‘em!  And finally, fuck you for dragging all of these men standing here with me down with you, and all of their families!  ‘Cause you know what?  PTSD doesn't just affect the soldiers themselves, it affects everyone around them!  Their lives are forever altered because
"Assuming no issues with the render and construction, I'm estimating that it can be delivered to Dr Banner in approximately ten hours."
Sam laughed as he made the turn onto the older, country road that led to the lake. "Mmm, cake. Yeah, that definitely sounds good."
It’s still better than drowning himself in Scotch, though, which is how Tony justifies it.  He figures that since he hasn’t had a single drop of the hard stuff since the night the nursery doctor called to tell him about Peter, he can indulge in his coffee as much as he wants.
"Then… you believe that this green veld might have something to do with the Soul Stone?" Sam asked carefully.
"Hey!" Peter said as his heart gave a joyous leap, his smile threatening to split his face. "You—you guys really came! Together!"
"Holy shit, you didn't just say that," Tony rasped against his throat, sucking into the tender flesh just above his Adam's apple. "You're such a naughty boy. God, I have managed to completely corrupt Captain America himself. Who would've thought?"
"And even less so if the so-called enemy turns out to have been their very own government the whole time," said Sam. He shot Colonel Rhodes—
"Captain Barnes," the pilot said with a rather impatient hand wave. "So you're telling us that this aircraft—"
Steve tipped his head, briefly closing his eyes as Anthony continued on, listening carefully to the sound of his voice as he instructed them on the proper takeoff procedures for a space launch. His voice was so unique, low and melodic, with a slightly raspy quality that Steve had noticed in Peter as well. He had also noticed that both Peter and Anthony tended to speak faster the more excited or passionate they were about something.
"Pete, is that you? What the hell are you doing?" Dad yelled as he flew by, aiming blast after blast at the suit he was tailing. Dad's armour was dented and covered with dings and bullet holes, and looked to be on the verge of completely losing power. From Peter's perspective, he definitely needed the help.
Steve gave a nod. "I agree. I know he's strong and smart as a whip, but he's still far too young to be an official Avenger." He broke off, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth. "And I honestly don't know if I'll ever think he's old enough to become an official Avenger."
"Yeah, I actually saw Стиви a few times when he was sick in the hospital back then," said Uncle Bucky. "When he'd let me see him, at least. Стиви never liked too many people seeing him when he was sick, so most of the time he would refuse visitors."
"Mmm, I don't think Gwen likes roses all that much though," said Peter, wrinkling his nose. "Maybe I should just stick with tulips or daisies or something, and then get one of those little teddy bears to go with it? Do you guys think that sounds okay?"
"Well, as long as the girls don't make too big of a mess, it should be okay," Sam said, yelping as Natasha elbowed him in the side. "Damn, Nat! You've got some sharp elbows!"
"Slow," answered Bruce, not even looking up as his fingers flew across the keyboard. "Whoever encrypted this stuff definitely knew what they were doing."
Tony's throat tightened, his eyes burning with tears. "Okay, but still. Steve, we're pretty much talking about a full-on coup here. It wouldn't be just you and Carol, we would need air support to keep you two from getting shot down before you could make it out of the atmosphere, we would need ground support to secure the general and his goonies and to keep Phillips from getting arrested—"
"All right," he said, clearing his throat. "But do we know where this guy is right now? 'Cause Peter is out there at the movies with only Bucky and a few guards as backup, so—"
"Yeah, I know," Peter said, sniffing. He tugged her over behind their classroom door, leaning down to give her a quick kiss. Blatant public displays of affection were not condoned at Midtown, and the last thing Peter needed was some nosy teacher or student ratting him out to his dads, but with how quickly weird things tended to happen to him and his loved ones, Peter didn't want to waste any chances to show his girl how much he cared for her.
"Ah, yes," O'Brien said with a nod. "The Battle of the Continents. The day that will live in infamy, so people say."
"Pete!" he cried, cursing the damned blanket that wouldn't unlatch from his right ankle. "Steve, I need—I need to get to Pete! I need to make sure that—"
"Okay, looks like there's a few here," Bruce began, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "Donald Gill, Morris… um, Nat, what's that say?"
And smirking against Steve's skin when he got the desired response, a long, low moan that rumbled up from Steve's chest.
But given everything that was stacked against them, Tony knew those were pretty much the best odds he could hope for.
"Oh, yeah," Peter said, glowering down at the zipper that had somehow forgotten to zip itself. He drew it up to his neck, ducking down inside the collar of the down parka as Papa opened the doors and a blast of arctic air hit Peter right in the face.
"Ah huh," Steve managed as he tried to climb down from his cockpit on his shaking legs, grabbing the ladder when his knees threatened to give way. He'd been so upset after Tony left that morning that he hadn't eaten any breakfast, and with his overactive metabolism his blood sugar was now in danger of bottoming out.
They had returned from Italy three days before, just in time to celebrate Peter's seventeenth birthday with the rest of the team. As usual, everyone had spoiled him rotten, showering him with gifts of Lego sets, more geeky t-shirts from Bruce, an authentic set of Asgardian armour from Thor, and, probably his most favourite gift of them all, a wooden and crystal chess set made by Noj Dubrovnik, one that Natasha ordered custom-made from Russia just for her precious милая ошибка.
"All right, good. Tell Happy that as soon as he's gone I'd like him to pack up Beck's office and bring all his stuff up here."
"I know," Steve said, sounding so tortured that Tony nearly came right then and there. Steve's body was so sensitive, and he had such a short refractory period that whenever they made love, Tony would often start him off with a handjob or blowjob, to help him take the edge off a bit.
Steve ended up taking three more trips over the course of the next eight days as Tony continued to fine-tune the coordinates. It was slow, difficult work, continuously trying both of their patience levels as it was much like searching for a needle in an infinitely-large haystack.
"No, Dad, I didn't mean it like that." Peter must've been more tired than he realised to bring up Grandpa when Dad was in such a good mood. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't've mentioned him."
He’s honestly never given it a single moment of thought until now, so where in the hell did this kid get the idea that Steve might want to coach him?
"Steve!" he exclaimed a few moments later, tugging sharply on Steve's hair as the pleasure suddenly ramped up, almost pulling him over the edge. He huffed out a sharp breath as Steve released him, kissing back up his abdomen and chest to his lips, the kiss languid and lazy but still with a sense of underlying urgency as Steve worked his pants and underwear down his legs.
Tony shifted in his seat, careful to avoid jostling a sleeping Peter as the jet began its early-morning descent into New York, heading for its usual runway at LaGuardia. Steve had suggested that they depart Italy in the evening, hoping that Peter would then sleep most of the flight home and avoid as much jet lag as possible, which turned out to have been a pretty brilliant idea when Peter conked out almost as soon as the plane took off. He had spent almost their entire last day on the beach building a massive sandcastle with Bucky and Thor and playing frisbee with Clint, allowing Tony and Steve a bit more of the alone time they had so enjoyed over the course of the week. The trip had turned out to be everything that he and Steve had wanted it to be, and while he had missed tinkering in the lab, he had definite mixed feelings about returning back to the intense grind that was their current mission.
And if he did, well, it was likely going to be one of the strongest tests of Steve's will that he had ever had in his life. Even now as he sat next to his son, trying to project an image of calmness and support, Steve could already feel his blood start to boil at the thought of laying eyes on even a holographic version of Obadiah Stane, the only man that Steve could say with absolute certainty that he hated more than Johann Schmidt.
As Papa liked to say sometimes, he needed to get his head out of the clouds and be aware of his surroundings.
" Tony said as Steve started trailing soft kisses across his cheek and down to his neck, latching onto his pulse point. "Please, just—"
"Damn right we will," agreed Tony. He drew in a deep breath as the light turned green, deliberately loosening his death grip on the wheel. He wanted to make a good impression on Steve's ma, and getting all upset about stuff that he couldn't change was only amplifying his nervousness. "Tell me the first thing that you're gonna do with Pete once he's better, yeah? I'm sure you've thought about it."
Tony's shoulders dropped, and he let out a heavy sigh. "Yeah. Honey, I'm—I'm… well… I guess I'm not sure—"
"Nope, no buts," Tony repeated, shaking his head as Redwing swooped down from the sky and disappeared inside the Quinjet. "So, what's the plan?"
"Oh, ha, ha, ha," Tony said with what he hoped was a playful frown. "I'm just—we don't happen to know the security clearance of any of these people, do we?"
Tony paused, glancing at Steve as he drew in a deep breath. They had anticipated getting a question like this.
Peter’s face fell so fast Steve was surprised he didn't disappear into the couch cushions.  “Aww, already?  But it’s the weekend!  You always let me stay up later on the weekends!”
"You are so damn pretty when you come," Tony murmured once he'd regained some minimal use of his senses. "I can't believe I'm the only one who's ever gotten to see you like this."
As much as he hated to admit it, if the bolt of electricity that shot up his arm when Steve shook his hand the night before was any indication, Tony was already starting to fall for the tall, blond-haired, gorgeous-as-hell pilot.
Steve could certainly understand misery, even if he couldn’t understand how someone with Tony’s immense wealth and resources, and not to mention an absolutely precious son, could be so.
Peter glowered as they arrived at Gwen's locker, watching as she unlocked it and began tossing books and papers around. He was starting to get the impression that this was a bigger deal than he'd originally thought.
"Yeah, that sounds nice. Thanks," Steve said as he slotted the idea into its appropriate mental compartment. Based on what he'd observed it didn't seem like Anthony got to go to his home very much, not too surprising since Peter wasn't there anymore, so an after-dark picnic might just be up Anthony's alley.
And while Peter didn't really think he'd be engaging in any hand-to-hand combat anytime soon, especially since he considered himself more of a flyer like Dad instead of a foot soldier like Papa, he had noticed a definite decrease in his headaches since he'd started paying attention to his shoulder positioning, so it hadn't just been empty advice.
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. "Yeah, okay, but you get what I mean, right? Papa asked you to marry him because he loves you and he wants to be your husband. It's really not anymore complicated than that."
Steve's heart began to thud as soon as they turned down the hallway that led to Tony's office. He very badly wanted to kiss Tony goodnight, but he didn't want to seem too pushy or forward and possibly scare him.
"An attack!" Peter cried. He scrambled to his feet, practically yanking Gwen's arm from its socket as he pulled her up next to him. "We're under attack, so we've gotta get out of—"
"Pardon me, sir," said JARVIS. "But Ms Hill reports that FBI agents have indeed arrested Spencer Smythe at his apartment. According to her FBI liaison, Smythe will be transferred to the same holding facility where Adrian Toomes is currently residing."
Peter tapped his chin as he studied the drawing. "I'll have to ask Dad how much vibranium we'll have to work with," he said. "If there's not enough then we'll still have to go with the original idea, but if there is, then—"
"Two large peppermint teas and a chocolate croissant, please," Tony said to the young lady at the counter, who immediately started gushing as she recognised them. Tony smiled as she fumbled with his change, giving her a twenty dollar tip as she handed them their drinks, the clean, pungent smell of the peppermint already working to soothe Steve's frayed nerves. Peppermint had been banned from the Tower and Compound because of how dangerous it was for Peter, so Steve took full advantage of any opportunity that he had to enjoy a cup of his favourite tea without it posing a threat to their son.
"I'll be waiting for your call, Mr Wilson," Stacy said, nodding in Sam's direction. "And I'll be ready."
Steve shook his head as he drew back, quickly removing Tony's glasses and gliding his t-shirt over his head before lifting him into his arms and placing him gently on the bed. Steve crawled up over him, gently tracing his index finger down the faint scar on his chest, Tony's beautiful brown eyes shining in the near-darkness as he curled his arms around Steve’s shoulders.
“Yeah, I do,” Steve says.  Because he definitely knows what that’s like.  He’s been living it for the past sixteen months.
Phillips frowned as the datapad in his hand beeped with an incoming message. "I just did," he said, scowling as he read. "Seems like the ground squadron I sent past the former DMZ made it to the main Meridian aircraft hangar."
"Uncle Sam took Uncle Bucky back to the Tower as soon as he got here, little guy," Papa said. "He's gonna take care of him, so you don't need to worry."
Very few people had ever offered anything to Tony without an ulterior motive, and despite the reassurance from Peter's Spider Sense, George Stacy was not yet on the list of people that Tony could trust without reservation.
"Yes, yes, ready to jump right back into things, that's what I like to hear," O'Brien said. "And the skies over our beloved country are much safer with you up there, of that I have no doubt. I just have a few quick questions before I dismiss you, Captain, if you don't mind."
"Didn't you guys hear me?" Gwen's youngest brother demanded, a deep frown on his face. "Mom's got dinner ready!"
"Maybe, maybe not, but I'm still gonna keep a close eye on him," answered Dad. "That damn Senator Davis has his fingers in an awful lot of pots for just a junior senator, and the timing of Stacy's transfer is pretty convenient, if you ask me. Plus his kid is now in Pete's class? With the presidential election only two months away, I'm not taking anything at face value anymore."
“There!” he said as he pulled up a freshly decrypted page, which just happened to be some kind of generic-looking shipping manifest.  He quickly skimmed it over, noting that it appeared to reference several separate shipments, all of which were being sent to—
"Okay, but help us do what, exactly?" Steve asked. "If Fury was trying to contact someone at the exact moment he was fading into ashes, then it's a bit late now, don't you think? I mean, how do we even know that whoever this is actually got the message?"
“All right, honey, just get yourself comfy there,” Dad said as Papa settled in on the squashy white chair in the lab.  The chair, one that Dad had designed specifically for this test, was supposed to resemble a real-world version of the ONI immersion booth from
"Okay, but you can fix it, right?" Steve asked, his panic already spiking again. "Because we need to know who did this, and why, and—"
"Uh huh," Peter answered, patting his backpack. "I've got one pair of each in here and one in my locker."
"Missing the go/no-go point would mean the aircraft would be in danger of skipping off the atmosphere," said Steve. "Which means—"
"Pardon me, Captain," JARVIS cut in. "But Master Peter is awake, and requesting information regarding Mr Stark's current status."
"We were able to find out who the first two names are," said Natasha. "Or, were, I guess. From what we can tell they're both dead now."
Instinctively, Peter grinned, even as he shook his head. "I don't know, dude. I don't exactly understand all the rules for that stuff yet. Especially since they seem to change a lot, and without warning."
“I love you too, Papa,” answered Peter.  He raised his head, smiling widely as he swiped a tear from his cheek.  “This is the best thing ever.”
Natasha looked up then, catching Tony's eyes and jerking her head towards Steve in silent question. Tony frowned and shook his head, pursing his lips when Natasha's shoulders dropped.
"No, she's not, Peter, but you and Gwen are still very young," said Papa. "There's still plenty of time to be going all over the world alone. Sixteen is pretty young to be so far away from your family."
"They're probably too afraid of retaliation," Steve said. "Whether they intended to or not, they did end up killing King T'Chaka, and if even a fraction of the rumours about Wakanda are true, then I'm guessing whoever it is is going to be in hiding for quite a while."
Which was something that both Tony and Steve had agreed would never happen, and especially not with the current government. Steve was already drawing far too many comparisons between President Cole and Hitler for Tony's comfort, and he was afraid that they had only scratched the surface so far.
Natasha smirked, leaning towards the monitor. "Um… Марк Ракстон, that's Mark Raxton, and Уильям Бейкер is William Baker. That along with Steven Rogers, James Barnes, Bruce Banner, and Peter Stark-Rogers are all that we've managed to uncover."
Opening the doors, Peter found Papa leaning against the cab of his truck in his usual spot in the parking lot, talking with Chief Stacy, Gwen's father, who was standing outside of his unmarked police car. As soon as Gwen saw them she tugged on Peter's arm, reaching to plant a quick kiss on his cheek.
"Shh, sweetheart," Steve whispered, brushing his fingers across Tony's lips. "Don't worry about it now, okay? Try and get some rest, I know you haven't been sleeping well lately."
“Wait!” Tony says, startling both Steve and Thor.  Then he cups Steve’s face in his hand, his eyes flicking from Steve’s lips to his eyes, and back to his lips.  “Honey, can I—?”
And not only did the set he was currently holding in his very own hands contain an actual first-edition printing of
"I know," Steve rasped, the hot stream of water only exacerbating the burn in his cheeks that he very much hoped Bucky couldn't see.
"Yeah, baby, that's me," Tony said as he kissed his way back up to Steve's glorious mouth. He groaned as Steve's tongue slipped between his lips, stroking against his own. It still amazed Tony that even now, after the millions of kisses that he and Steve had shared, Steve still took his time to explore Tony's mouth as though it was his very first time.
Colonel Phillips had personally promised Steve numerous times that both Tony and Peter would be kept as safe as possible during the Phoenix mission, but Steve was still worried for them. He was supposed to be their protector, but how in the hell could he possibly do that while he was millions of kilometres away in space?
"You sure you don't need anything else, honey?" Tony asked, now pressing soft kisses all along Steve's temple and cheek. "Maybe I can help take your mind off the pain a bit, hmm?"
“Yeah?  So?” Tony said, ignoring Obie’s whiny tone.  “It’s not like we need any more of ‘em at the moment.  JARVIS told me we’ve got over eighteen thousand units just sitting up there in the warehouse!”
"Oh my sweet boy," he whispered as he pressed kisses all along Peter's hand and wrist. He let out a sort of morbid chuckle as Steve settled into the second chair. "You'd think that I'd be used to seeing him like this with how sick was all the time, but—"
The type of heart defect Peter has is an atrial septal defect (ASD) with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. It is a congenital defect that while not automatically lethal, does require repair for the patient to live beyond their childhood years.
Peter patted his right jacket pocket, the ring he'd helped Dad make for Papa sitting right where he'd put it.
"Amazing," Peter said with wide eyes. "Like, you're probably gonna stop short when you see him. Make that silly ga-ga face of yours and everything."
"He's right, Steve," Sam said firmly. "The doctors told me that they weren't sure if he was even breathing when his aircraft landed, so if you hadn't gotten him out when you did there's no telling what could've happened. He could've been left with brain damage, or—or—" Sam broke off, swiping at his nose. "He's still alive, and that's all that matters."
"Aw, yeah!" Steve yelled triumphantly, his heart slowly creeping back down from where it had jammed in his throat. "Take that you sons of bitches!"
"I highly doubt that anyone could understand it better than myself, sir," Steve said, forcing Tony to fake a cough to hide his snort.
Thor shoots Tony a confused look.  “What is this ‘icebox’ you mentioned?” he asks, indicating the vast mountainous terrain stretched out in front of them.  “As I can see, this place hardly resembles anything close to a box, and while there is plenty of snow, I do not believe that is what you are referring to.”
“Well,” Tony says a few moments later, his sharp exhales perfectly in time with Steve’s ragged pants.  “I know this probably isn’t the best time to mention this particular tidbit, but—”
“Well, believe it or not, I've actually heard that before.  I suppose being a spy would work pretty well with my Krav Maga training too,” Natasha says.  She rests her chin on the top of the wall, smiling conspiratorially.  “So… what was all that with Lorriane?”
Steve collapsed beside Tony while Tony, using the strength left in him rolled to the side and attached himself to Steve's side. "Ugh..Tonees..come..." "I..just did..." "No,..its..uncomfortable...need..to-" "Shhh....sleep..first...wash..later.." "Atleast let me bring a wash cloth" Tony whined but reluctantly let Steve go. Steve brought the wash cloth and carefully cleaned himself and Tony, threw it near the laundry bag, rearranged the covers, set the alarm and joined Tony in the bed.
"What was the owner's name?" and JARVIS starts finding through his database when FRIDAY interrupts them "I'm sorry, Miss Stark but Sargent Barnes insisted to talk to you and it's urgent" FRIDAY says and Ahana frowns at the worried tone "Yeah, connect him in, babygirl" and the speaker crackles with her husbands voice "Ahana!" "Babe, what's wrong?" "It's HYDRA and...and" "And what?!" "The wolf...they are after your wolf!" "Why?" "They said... it's Tony, Ahana, it's Tony! You have Tony right on your lap!" Bucky breathes and Ahana's heart stutters and looks down at the wolf on her lap :and cries when Bucky shouts "No!" "Babe! Babe! What's wrong?!" "Ahana, go to the basement! HYDRA are coming there!" "And I'm not letting them put their grubby hands on my brother again" she says sternly and cuts the call off before she commands the Iron Man suit. THe flies toward her and assembles itself around her and it fits like a glove. She wastes no time and carries the wolf, the walls of her bedroom crumbling around her "Shit! J, give me the quickest pathway to the interrogation vault and make it quick!" she orders and JARVIS immediately conjures up a way and screens it in her HUD.
"Tasha, since I met you, the roller coaster I've been ridding doesn't struggle anymore to make it up those hills..."
Tony was reading one of mission report when the familiar weird feeling crept up him. He looked up from the paper and scanned around until his eyes narrowed down on a woman figure in all black staring at the diner. Everything clicked to its place and his eyes widened just the exact moment a bomb came crashing through the diner window "EVERYONE GET DOWN-"
"For your next assignment, I want everyone to interpret the data on page twenty and form a frequency and the cumulative frequency tables and compare the data and come up with a conclusion" Mr. Tanner said as the bell rang, indicating the end of his fourth grade Maths class. The classroom groaned but nodded nonetheless as Mr. Tanner walked out and Mrs. Sylvia entered for their Science class. "Pssst." someone hissed at Scar's left ear but she ignored it as she was busy jotting down the homework for today. "Psst. Hey, Scar" Tony hissed again and Scar turned to look at him with an unimpressed look "What?" Tony then inched closer "Wanna sleepover tonight?" he asked and Scar sighed "Not today, Tones. I already have tones of homework and if I don't get them finished, my dad will literally skin me" she said with a shudder. Tony stared at her for a while as he thought again "How about...I come by and help you with your homework and
is what he thinks and he opens his eyes and meets another set of chocolate-brown eyes, staring down at him, gaze full of love.
Back at the Avengers compound, “Earlier this evening, there has been a devastating terrorist attack at the iconic New York landmark, Stark Towers. Almost all of the SI employees are safe and the number of causalities are at a low rate of 13 people and zero fatality. Stark Industries, CEO Riri Williams was interviewed regarding the matter and it seems she has no idea about a terrorist warning. It was also said that the former CEO and the owner of Stark Industries, Tony Stark was seen to be entering the back entrance of the tower which leads to his private penthouse. Since the missile is speculated to be planted at his penthouse level, its still a mystery that the body of Tony Stark is unidentified.” The Avengers stood stunned around the TV. Steve was on the sofa with his eyes closed. Steve woke up from the sofa and rushed to his bike at the garage ignoring his teammates calling after him.
Yelena, eto ya .... Dzheyms, otpusti yego, vernis -Yelena, it's me .... James, let him go, come back
Ahana enters into their room and sees her husband in nothing but a tight black boxer, lazing around in bed. He turns to look at her as she locks the door and starts undressing herself, the scars on her back barely seen. Ahana could feel her husbands eyes on her and she smirks "Like what you see?" she taunts and her husbands hums "Very" he growls and Ahana chuckles. Half naked in only in her bra and panties, Ahana crawls to the bed and immediately snuggles into her husband, sighing in pleasure. Bucky then starts kissing down her neck while his hands roam all over her body. His right hand travels to the base of her skull and gently tugs her hair, exposing more of her neck for him to work on, while his left travels along the valley between her breasts as he circles her nipples with his forefinger. Ahana moans and whimpers as Bucky bites her neck, sucking on the skin until its red and then continues to down the neck. His left hand dips into her bra and rolls her nipples between his thumb and forefinger and Ahana arches beautifully. "Beautiful..." Bucky whispers into her skin as she pleads for him "Please..Bucky..Baby...More" she whispers and moans.
, within a minute soft crooning music played from the ceiling, startling the team at the living room, Tasha and Tony's eyes widened in shock and suprise.
Plan provalilsya, vmesto togo, chtoby byt' vsegda lyubyashchim tebya, ty privel vsyu svoyu chertovu sem'yu. - The plan failed, instead of always you alone, you brought all your damn family.
Nam nuzhna byla tekhnologiya dlya nashego oruzhiya, i tol'ko u vas ona byla. U tebya byl tol'ko odin - We needed technology for our weapons, and only you had it. You only had one
Tony slumped against the chair he has been sitting. Adrenaline subsiding in his body and joy rippling through. He got his sister back. Everything was gonna be alright...right?
" " Then why here? Why couldn't you fly us to Washington?" "Seeing as the current bombing at New York and Miss Stark's latest location, this area is the safest for you to investigate." "Who is the smartest one here, J?" "
"That's the spot huh kitten? Do you feel me, kitten? Fuck, you take my cock like a cockslut, made just for my cock!" Bucky whispers against the shell of her ears and Ahana trembles. Ahana whimpers and moans, her words shredded into two words "Bucky...more" as Bucky hits her G-spot in each of his thrust. "Close baby?" he asks as he sees her face and Ahana nods and whimpers "Come baby, come from my cock, mine" Bucky whispers and Ahana screams his name as she comes, her body shaking in aftershocks. Bucky keeps his lines of praises as he tips and comes, his come sliding hotly in her pussy. Bucky braces his arms, caging her in as he catches his breath and moves to pull out but Ahana's hand stops him. Bucky looks up at her and his breath hitches at her serene face, pliant and happy "Don't...wanna...keep...you inside.." she whispers and Bucky groans but compiles. He carefully maneuvres the both of them until they are pressed side to side, Ahana's back against Bucky's chest.
"Tell me if I read it wrong" Steve whispered as he leaned into Tony slowly, giving him a chance to back off but Tony was having none of it and closed the gap between them. Steve tangled one of his palm into Tony's soft hair as his other palm stayed at the low back of Tony's back to keep him close. Tony wrapped both of his arms around Steve's neck and they kissed. Kissing Tony was everything he expected at the same time not expected all in one. Soft moans were coaxed out of Tony's mouth and Steve savored every ounce of it. Steve then got braver and wiped his tongue at Tony's bottom lips, opening Tony's mouth. Poking and prodding around Tony's mouth was heaven as Tony whimpered against his body. His hard on pressing against Steve's thigh. Oxygen was needed and the pair broke apart, panting but still smiling at each other. "Come with me" Tony said after few moments, Steve's arms wrapped around his waist as he rested his forehead against Steve's "Follow me back to Malibu, it's only 2 hours way from your campus and I'm almost gonna finish my studies and the we ca-" "Tony, relax...I'll come, I'll follow you to the end of the world, sweetheart" Steve said with an earnest answer and Tony beamed and pecked Steve's lips one more time before dragging Steve to their future.
"Tony, I don't regret going under the sea, I don't regret missing almost 70 years of my life, if it brings me to you..."
Stepping out of the car, the team leisurely strolled towards the tombstone. They were fondly bickering, teasing each other until Tony turned to his right and saw a woman dressed in all black standing in front of Tasha's tombstone staring at it. Tony slowed down his steps and lightly tapped Steve's forearm to get his attention. Steve turned and asked Tony with a jerk of his chin and Tony pointed his thumb to were the woman was standing. "The past 30 years I've been coming here, only I visited her. Like I said, I lost her when we were 12 so she couldn't have had many friends...." Tony said while slowly approaching the woman. The woman stood with her back facing Tony, but she had long straight black hair which changed into a light brown color at the end, wearing a black long sleeve blouse with black skin tight jeans. She was also holding a large black handbag and was wearing a 6-inch stiletto heel. Tony slowly approached the woman and lightly touched the woman's arm "Hey, may I he-" Tony's words stuck in his throat as the woman whipped her head and stared at him. Tony's complexion morphed into pale white and his knees buckled. He staggered his steps and took one step front but the woman took her gun out from her back pocket and pointed directly at his head. "Tasha?" and the woman eyes went wide "
Ty dumayesh', chto smozhesh' ubit' menya ?! Metakhuman ?! Super soldat ?!" -  Do you think you can kill me ?! Metahuman ?! Super soldier ?!
Ahana is busily talking with Steve when a weight settles on her lap, and she looks down and huffs when he sees her wolf dozing off on her lap. "He really loves you" Steve's voice startles Ahana and she looks back at him with a pleased smile "Yeah, he's like this big baby in an adult's body. He looks damn scary but still wants cuddles and will purr like a train on your lap. He's special or a very tactile guy, I'm lucky" she says and smirks at Bucky's affronted look "You said marrying me made you lucky!" "Babe, there can be two things that make someone lucky, and just because I said that doesn't mean what I said about our marriage isn't true" she placates and smooches him on the lips. "Ew, Mom and Dad are kissing!" Clint squaks and splutters when Ahana and Bucky flips him off. Ahana is distractedly chewing her food when she sees the tiniest scar on top of the wolf's right eye. She frowns and bends down to check it and there it was, a small but prominent brown scar, stark contrast with her wolf's white fur. She keeps running her thumb over the scar repeatedly when Bucky's voice brings her back to reality "Babe! you okay? I called you so many times" her husband looks at her worriedly and slides his arm across her shoulder, pulling her against her.
The whole dining table was silent before Natasha broke it "She sounds badass to me" and Tony unintentionally barked out laughing and soon enough everyone followed him. "Please, if Tasha was still alive, both of you would have killed me. And with Steve here" Tony pointed at his husband "The mother henning would have been unbearable! Just imagine, I'll never be allowed back in the lab until I was 100% recovered." Tony laughed "Seems okay with me, atleast I'll have some backup when you use your puppy dog eyes at me." Steve said with a mock annoyance. "Hey, did your puppy dog eyes work on Tasha?" Clint asked across the table. "Oh god no, even the saddest puppy dog eyes never broke her, she loved me, yes but sometimes she can be a little....stubborn." Tony shuddered at the memory. "Oh! I just remembered, I think I still have the drawing, gimme a second" and Tony sprinted to his room in the penthouse and rummaged a little box that was at the far corner of his room. After afew minutes, he pulled out the drawing that he has kept since he was 12. Tony held the picture close to himself and walked towards the kitchen again. "Ladies and gentlemen, presenting to you...Natasha Maria Stark!" The drawing was mostly made from pencil and a light touch of charcoal. The muse, however, was gorgeous, even as a kid. Steve ran a finger through the drawing as light as possible. The girl was between 3 to 4 years old with her head tilting slightly to the right. She had her hair in a double dutch braid with the bangs neatly styled in front. Even in black and white, Steve could feel her piercing eyes, the blue eyes and she had the softest smile, not too big and not too small, just perfect enough. She was wearing a lace Victorian style gown but only her upper body was drawn. "She...she is beautiful..." Pepper whispered softly beside Tony. "I bet if she's still alive, so many guys would have fallen in love with her..." Bucky said and the others agreed. "We should hang her in our room..." Tony whipped his head at Steve and looked at him in horror "Babe, I love you and that's a great idea but I love Tasha too much for her eyes to be bleached seeing us making love in our room. Pity her, atleast." Tony said and barked another round of laughter when Steve's cheeks was covered in a rosy blush. Steve lightly smacked Tony behind his head "I meant hang her picture there" pointing at the wall of fame covered in their family pictures "cause now she's family too." Tony hugged him and pecked him in the lips and went to the wall while Steve tried hanging her picture. After several tries, Tasha's picture was hung among the various photos of their family. Tony slumped back against Steve's chest with Steve's arms around him and his family surrounding him, he looked at the picture. "We're one big family" Steve whispered in his ears.
"Tony!" someone from behind shrieked his name and he turned to his back colliding with the person. Tony fell back onto the ground with a small 'oomph' before he opened his eyes and saw his childhood friend sprawled on top of him with a big goofy smile. "Scar!" Tony immediately scrambled off the ground with her help and hugged her tight, bag and all. He shoved his face into her neck and took a deep breath, her usual strawberry body wash scent calming him instantly. They then pulled away and Tony looked up and saw Mrs. Maximoff standing behind Scarlett with a black and red schoolbag and a brown paper bag, smiling at him. "Morning, Mrs. Maximoff" Tony greeted and she ruffled his hair before handing the paper bag towards him and Tony looked at Scarlett for help. Scarlett giggled "It's our favorite blueberry pie from the bakery two blocks down our preschool" she explained with a glee. Tony's eyes widened and took the bag, wishing Scarlett's mother thank you, and peered into it, there sat, two slice of the delicious blueberry pie, still hot from the oven.
A chorus of murmured assent erupted from the team members, followed by the loud scraping of chairs against the polished linoleum floor. Steve and Tony hung back until everyone else had exited the room, with Steve turning to Tony as soon as they were alone.
The only scientist aside from Howard and Anthony Stark who seemed to still be alive was Hank Pym, and yet unlike the others there was absolutely nothing about him listed in the database aside from the fact that he had once worked for the Air Corps. In fact, his name wasn't even clickable.
"Me too, bud," Tony said as he kissed his son's forehead. "But try and have some fun anyway, yeah? You know Papa would want that."
As soon as they left the room Peter grabbed for his phone, trying to decide whether or not to text Gwen. He doubted that she'd be asleep as she had told him before that she tended to be a night owl on the weekends, but he didn't want her to get in trouble with her parents either.
"No, I know you didn't," Steve said, attempting a smile. "And I didn't mean to imply that. I'm just… I just feel like I'm being pulled in all these different directions, when all I really want to do is curl up in bed with you and Peter and just sleep for the next week or so."
Steve gulped at the boy's suspicious tone, the way his brown eyes swept across his uniform in only partially-concealed disgust. It was definitely not something that Steve was used to experiencing.
"Please don't," Steve murmured against Tony's skin as he added some more lube, reveling in the way Tony was writhing beneath him, chanting his name. "Then we'll never get to the best part."
As usual, Steve had been absolutely right. This vacation, the almost three glorious weeks they had spent in Italy with Peter so far, had been just what the three of them had needed to help recover from the pure hell of the last year. The estate was private enough to keep them hidden from reporters and any other overly-curious people, and yet, thanks to the fully-stocked kitchen and regular grocery deliveries, Steve and Peter could still cook and bake to their hearts' content, all while completely spoiling Tony rotten in the process.
"No, I don't think it's a good idea!" Tony snapped. "But I also don't think that we have a choice! That asshole tried to break into our
"Huh? No, that's not because something didn't work," Tony insisted, rolling his eyes. "That was because I couldn't tell Rhodey what was going on with the suits, and—did you really have to bring that up
It wasn’t until he had taken out the tenth such tree that he realised that the sun had dipped completely beyond the horizon, leaving him alone in the dark with only the soft light from a crescent moon and his enhanced eyesight to guide him.
A week later, Bucky and Steve had their custom made rings in their small velvet box, each of them wearing a million-dollar smile. Bucky took out the ring and showed it to Steve, it was a simple wedding band, a small band, titanium lines at each ends and as a border to the line which had a Russian engraving "It means 'Home is in your arms' " Bucky explained, in between the titanium line, two striking blue lines ran along the sides "That's sapphire" Bucky pointed at those lines "Those reminds me of Tasha's blue eyes. Now, come on! Show me yours!" Bucky closed his ring box while Steve opened his "Wow..." Bucky gasped, the ring was titanium with gaps of resin inlay, with stones in each on of them, an Italian engraving was at the back of the ring "It means 'you gave a home' " Steve smiled while keeping his box back into his pocket, taking a deep breath, the duo stepped into the common room, where most of their teammates where lounging and watching some mindless comedy show. Steve looked up, silently asking FRIDAY to play
Later, the whole team were gathered at the kitchen eating their respective breakfasts. "Tash, we need to hurry, those assholes aren't gonna wait to eat us alive during the conference" Tony announced finishing his breakfast "Ugh! Those bald headed scumbags, just because I'm a lady they play with my ideas!" Tasha dropped her fork and facepalmed herself. "Why? What happened?" Steve asked "Remember the new division I wanted to form, the Genetic Engineering team? It seems that it won't make the cut since the idea was to childish, and it could have came from anyone" Tasha grumbled "That's outrageous! You're fucking smart, they don't deserve your brain." Bucky replied gruffly "I know, it's just..I have the experience first hand, with Hydra and all so I..I wanna help the rest of the soldiers who was a victim of that project" Tasha said with a visible shiver. Bucky rubbed her back soothingly "That's why I'm bringing in Tones, with his input, maybe I'l make it through." Tasha said while waking up from her seat and dumping her dishes on the sink and walking towards her room to bring her documents. Once Tony and Tasha left for their conference, the rest of the team scurried off to do their jobs, which left Bucky and Steve alone in the kitchen. The two sat in silence before Bucky took a deep breath and turned to Steve "Steve-" at the same time Steve said "Bucky-" and both of them stared at each other before bursting out laughing. "You first, Buck" "I..I'm going to propose Tasha.." Steve's eyes widened before pulling Bucky into a tight embrace, pulling away "That's great, Buck! I..I'm happy for you, really am" "Yeah, I think it's time to settle down, have kids and enjoy our lives, ya know, after Tasha's whole Hydra debacle and mine..we deserve it" Steve smiled and nodded before fidgeting in his seat, looking at his state Bucky's grin turned into a full smirk "What's going in your mind, punk?" "Its just...Tony and I were thinkin' about renewing our vows, and since he proposed me the first time, so this time I wanna do it" Bucky patted his shoulder before snapping his finger as an idea popped into his mind "Why don't we do it together? I mean, the Brooklyn brothers proposing the Stark twins! Woah! That's an awesome title!" Bucky exclaimed while Steve shook his head in amusement. "I..I was actually gonna ask Tones to make the ring, it'll be better than buying it from some random shop" Steve nodded but his mind was somewhere else,
Tony whimpers and pads over to his human and nudges her face and arms but his human is not moving, he whines but there is no movement then he starts licking and huffing on top of his human but no luck, his human is still unconscious. Tony mulls over his option and comes with an idea, if he wants to get help for his human, then he has to shift. So, he shifts, and it's hell! It's been almost 10 years since his first shift and he winces as he hears his bones cracking and twisting, elongating to a normal human bone. His muscle is stretched and his whole world gets turned upside down as he curls onto himself and focuses on shifting himself. The next he knows, his on the floor kneeling, his two human legs folded under him and his arms on his head, covering his ears. Tony then stretches and stands on both feet, a little dizzy at first but slowly getting the hang of it, walking towards his human. He shakes her "Hey, hey, you okay? Uhh, human you okay?" he asks but his human is still not opening her eyes but then he taps the metal helmet and the voice from inside speaks.
Reaching the room Tony was admitted, Steve slowly opened the door to see Tony resting against the headboard fiddling in his tablet. "You sure your not some kind of a cat?" Steve teased as he entered the room. Tony looked up from his tablet and a fond smile found its way to his face "Hey, sweetheart.." Tony said with  soft voice "Hey, babe..how are you?" "Good, better actually, the back up arc reactor is much better than the previous one" "Good..god Tony, you scared the hell outta me. I..I thought I lost you, once and for all." "Hey, hey...I'm fine Steve, like you said I'm a cat, a fierce wildcat" Steve raised an eyebrow "Like a wildcat? Nah, you're more like a house cat" "A very big-" "A tiny house cat, the one people melt seeing it in Youtube videos" Tony gasped and pouted "Who are you? And where is my husband?" "I'm right here babe-" "No, you're not. My husband would pepper me in kisses all over my face-" "You hate it when I do that" Steve said deadpanned "Point. But still he wo-ULD! STEVIE!" Steve launched himself at Tony and started to pepper kisses all over his face, Tony batted his face and shrieked in laughter. "Okay, okay break it off you saps" Clint teased as the whole team filled into the room. Tony's laughter subsided into soft giggled by the time the whole team was in the room. One by one the members sat by Tony and talked, joked and teased with him but Tony sensed tension between Bucky and Nat. He silently asked Steve with one raised eyebrow, and Steve nudged Bucky's shoulder. Bucky cleared his throat and everyone in the room turned their attention at Bucky, all except Nat. "I just wanna apologize to Nat. Nat, I'm so sorry I..I just.." Bucky took a deep breath and told her everything that he told Steve "-I still love you Nat but.." Nat finally turned to him and her gaze softened "Its..its okay..I guess..it's just I need some time to get over you.." she huffed a laughter but closed the distance between them and enveloped Bucky in a tight embrace. Bucky returned the embrace with an equal force. While everyone looked at them with a fond look, Tony sat there dumbfounded and he cleared his throat "Uhh, am I missing a memo here?" Steve ushered Bucky towards Tony's side "Tony...introducing your future brother-in-law." Tony's mouth hung open and Bucky glared at Steve. "Wh..wh..what?!" Steve sat beside him and explained the whole accord between Bucky and Tasha. Tony closed his mouth and closed his eyes and pondered, and then took a deep breath and looked at Bucky with a fond smile and a mischievous smirk "Well then Bucky, welcome to the family! I mean, the Stark family that is." Bucky groaned while the rest of the teammates laughed and the whole atmosphere was beautiful. The laughter soon died down and Tony sobered "So..how are we gonna bring her back?" "You mean us" Steve replied deadpanned "But-" "Don't fight with me on this Tony, you're still injured and not in any condition to come for a mission." "Steve...she's my sister" "I know Tony but-" "Please Steve...I'm begging you, I really want to see her..please" Tony gave his best puppy eyes and Steve groaned but agreed to him "But as soon as you're hurt, stay back. That's an order" Steve said with a hard voice and Tony nodded enthusiastically. After a few days, Tony was deemed healthy and was discharged. As soon as he reached the Avenjet, the team gathered at the meeting room to discuss their strategy. "According to Bucky, we have a very rough sketch of the HYDRA facility base. Bruce and Nat your on comms, Sam and Tony take the south entrance, Thor and Rhodey air control shoot down any HYDRA flights, Clint at the west side and Carol at the east side, Bucky and me, we save Tasha." all the others nodded in affirmation and scrambled to suit up.
Tony is on his third piece of bacon, when the brunette human, that slept with his human, comes to the kitchen and immediately ruffles his fur. Tony snarls a little- he slept with HIS human! HIS! -but remains seated near his breakfast. The brunette human rolls hie eyes and steals a piece of bacon from the blond human. "Buck!" the blond human hits his hands with the spoon? large spoon? in his hand and someone laughs at the back.Tony lifts his head and sees his human and she comes near him and kneels infront of him, strokes his fur and kisses the top of his head "Morning, baby boy" she whispers before she goes back to the two humans near the stove. The brunette human scoffs "Hmph, know the big lug gets all the kisses. And what I get? Dog saliva kisses" he pouts and his human snorts "You want me to give those to someone else?" she asks with a raised eyebrow and Bucky whines before settling with a pout but his human kisses the pout away and the brunette smiles again.
, I'm gonna go meet Pep, she planned a date" "Have fun, babe" Ahana replies and Natasha walks out. Two strong arms envelop her waist and Bucky shoves his head into her neck, planting a kiss on her collarbone "Hey, you ready?" he asks and Ahana hums, glancing at her brother one last time before exiting the room. She bumps intot Steve on her way to their room "Hey, you okay?" she asks "Yeah, just gonna go company Tony, brought my things there" he replies, lifting his sketchbook and Ahana laughs and turns to Bucky "Babe, can you go first, I'll catch up with you in a minute" and Bucky hums, kisses her cheeck and walks to their room.
After another round in the shower -Steve's puppy dog eyes worked-, the pair went down the kitchen for breakfast. All the avengers were lounging in the hall with their own breakfasts and watching the latest season of Game of Thrones. "Morning, guys!" the pair greeted the team but only got a few hums and grunts in return. "Look at them, I pay for their food, electricity bill and water bills and this is the respect I get. See if I upgrade all of you're weapons and armour next time." Tony grumbled and padded to the kitchen. He started the coffee machine and stood there waiting for it while Steve went and grabbed the eggs and bacon and started on the omelet. The smell  of bacon and omelet was enough for the rest of the avengers to shut off the TV and race to the dining table. "Now you come finding us" Tony muttered and took his coffee and sat beside Bruce. Steve came with the omelets and bacons and set them on the table and joined Tony. Pretty soon, the table was packed and covered with voices of each Avenger. Tony and Bruce were discussing about their next experiment, Nat and Coulson were exchanging SHIELD files -probably about the new recruits at SHIELD-, Sam, Bucky, Peter and Harley were excitedly talking about the newest video game, Pepper and May were at the end of the table, feeding each other and gossiping among themselves, Thor and Clint were having an eating competition. Steve shook his head fondly and although this is a band of misfits but it's his band of misfits. Dodger trotted to his feet and Figaro graciously jumped on Tony's lap and Tony started stroking his head without a second thought. Steve ruffled Dodger's head and fed him small pieces of bacon and eggs. After a few hours, Tony cleared his throat to get everyone's attention. "Morning, guys. Actually, Steve and I have came up with a plan to go and visit my sisters grave. Together. And I mean all of us." around him, his family stared at him "Yeah. I think it's time my sister met my family" Tony said and mere minutes he's pulled into the biggest group hug in his whole life. Tears and compliments lter, the Avengers were dressed up in all black to go visit Tasha's grave.
"Don't, Mr Stark, you'll only make this worse," he said, so smugly that Tony had to fight the urge to punch his lights out. "I strongly suggest that you go home now."
And Tony was just too tired and too frazzled to try and even render a guess as to what the hell he was up to.
It was why Howard couldn't even bring himself to attend Tony's graduation from MIT. Tony's mother had told him that Howard had gotten called away on urgent business the night before, and Tony had accepted that flimsy-ass excuse for her sake, but he had always known the truth.
He had even given in the night before and showed it to Steve, who believed even less in coincidences than Tony, and while Steve ultimately said it was Tony's area of expertise and therefore his decision, his uneasiness with it was only making Tony's worse.
"This is more of a diplomatic meet-up than a real mission, Pete," Tony added. "Papa probably won't even have to get his new uniform dirty. And with the new locator chips, you and I will be able to listen in and keep tabs on him anytime we want."
There was also an eerie, almost unnatural-looking fog rising from the surface, which didn't appear to be part of the lake itself, or a result of the broken ice.
And now yet another had joined those ranks, the cold, empty chair at their table a sharp reminder at just how fleeting life could be.
"Okay," Steve said, wincing as Bruce stuck Peter's arm with the IV needle, his heart skipping when Peter didn't even flinch. "But when will he wake up? Because he's acting just like he did—" he broke off then, rubbing at his nose as a single tear escaped down his cheek. "I think something happened under the water, something like what happened down in Miami, 'cause he—he hates needles, and he didn't even move just now when Bruce—I mean, he's just not waking up, and—"
But since there was no way Steve was going to make Tony face Stane alone when he had been the catalyst for the whole thing in the first place, that point was moot.  Sam had told Steve that he’d made a lot of progress over the course of the week, complimenting him several times on his work ethic while still reminding him that things weren’t going to completely improve overnight.
"Way to go, kiddo!" Sam called from Tony's right as Peter retook his seat with the rest of his team. He leaned in, giving Tony a gentle nudge with his elbow. "That kid of yours is pretty incredible, Tony."
"Yes, I understand," Lang said, nodding like a bobble-head doll. He held out his hand, awkwardly glancing between Tony and Steve. Steve took it first, squeezing it just hard enough for Lang to gulp. "Ah, I can't tell you both how grateful I am. I mean it. This… you have no idea what this means to me."
Tony stared at him for a long time, his lower lip quivering. "The data accessed from the server turned out to be the design schematics of my Iron Legion suits," he said. "Which means that whoever it was—"
“Okay, Cap, what’re we looking at here,” Tony asks, glancing over Steve’s elbow at the tablet he’s holding.  “Think we’ll be making it home in time for dinner?  I’m sure Pete would appreciate it, it’s s’posed to be pizza night.”
"Everything's fine with your dads, милая ошибка," Auntie Nat said as soon as Peter opened the door. "No need to worry."
"I'm afraid this one's going to need to be on an O2 mask soon," she had whispered to her medical student afterwards, once again completely disregarding the fact that Peter could hear every word she was saying. "And once that happens he'll need a feeding tube, which'll cost his father even more credits, and—"
Which to Peter didn't make any sense at all. In order for the Meridians to fire a beam of that intensity at the precise moment that Captain Barnes's aircraft emerged back inside the planet's atmosphere, someone over there would've had to have known first that Langara had sent aircraft into space, and second, the exact time and location of Captain Barnes's reentry.
"Yeah," Tony murmured, but Steve wasn't convinced. His body was still rigid with tension, his fingertips digging into Steve's shoulder blades like he was afraid to let go.
Then again, Steve was a soldier, not a scientist, so what did he know? There were probably very good reasons why the government did what they did, especially since Steve knew without a doubt that not a single Langaran citizen wanted to experience something as horrible as the Battle of the Continents ever again.
"That's 'cause you put me to sleep," Steve answered, practically slurring the words as his head lolled to the side, groaning again at the feel of Tony's glorious fingers digging into his flesh. "Your fingers are magical or something."
"Well, there they are," said Chief Stacy as they arrived at the two parked vehicles. "Captain Rogers and I were just talking about the two of you."
"Whoa, now hold on a second there, kiddo," said Uncle Bucky. "I wasn't even supposed to tell you any of this, and now you're talking about trying to fix it?"
"You're kidding, right?" Peter asked, making a beeline for the refrigerator, and the huge bottle of orange juice that they replaced every two days or so. Twisting off the cap, Peter was just raising it up to his mouth when he caught Steve's eye. "Um… yeah. I'll, uh, get a glass."
"Babe, how many times do I have to tell you that you don't need to apologise?" Tony said, kissing the top of his head. "And especially not to me. Believe me, I understand."
"Yep. Can't have any pilots up there defending our skies that are in anything less than perfect health," answered Tony, rolling his eyes. "And especially not one who's the son of the infamous national traitor. Although, he wasn't quite yet at the time, I guess."
"Yes, all signs are pointing in that direction," Natasha said. "But if the Chitauri were trying to launch an invasion of Earth from this point, why only stop at two attacks? And why attack what amounts to an office building during the night, when there were basically no people inside it?"
"But, honey, she'd—" He broke off, clearing his throat. "We'd need to get her all the supplies, and the monitors, and—"
"But then why can't they just do another conference call?" he asked. "And why would they need me when I'm not officially associated with Damage Control?"
"Ah, yeah," answered Tony. "The Toomes girl, her old man is one of our salvage contractors." He paused as he took note of Steve's shaking lower lip and twitching fingers, both signs of his anxiety starting to take hold. "You're not thinking that she invited Pete to the party because her dad's been stealing from Damage Control, are you? 'Cause even if he is, that'd be a pretty gutsy move."
“I’m positive,” answered Peter.  He was already thinking of where he could display the set in his room.  At the moment his collectible
