Dean couldn’t tell if there was a wry smile on Castiel’s face as he nodded, but Dean still helped him out of the tub. Cas swayed a little and stumbled as he got out, falling into Dean’s arms. Their eyes met as they looked at each other through the goggles, and Cas’s hands tightened on Dean’s arms more than they needed to. Then the moment was gone as Cas got used to his feet a touch more and let go.
Garth exhaled and gave Dean a grateful smile. “That’s what I thought. Just wanted to be sure, Dean.”
Jack went through the near closed ballroom doors and Dean opened them to follow. As he stepped into the space, his vision was filled up with the sight of Castiel—only he was his dragon self and not looking at all like a human.
“C’mon, you have got to see the coffee machine in this place,” Dean said, changing the subject, hopefully.
Dean jumped a little, but his shock was short-lived as he blinked away the water from his eyes and turned to look at Cas through the steamed up glass of the shower. “Hey, Cas.”
Cas stopped stirring. “Hm, now that you say it like that, that would likely be insufficient. I assume you only read English?”
Charlie did what Dean had done the first time. She fainted and Dean only just caught her in his arms. Dean was just about ready to join her himself, considering that seeing Cas’s shadow was many steps beyond seeing his actual dragon form.
It wasn’t Dean’s place to probe why the guy couldn’t leave, there was no GPS tracking anklet in sight. Instead he took a tentative step closer and said, “Hey, how about I check the place out and then we can discuss whether you want me as a tenant? Huh? How’s that sound?”
“Books. Fine furniture. Good coffee.” Cas licked his lips. “Treasure too. That one’s kind of universal with my kind.”
Castiel’s angel outfit included a halo fashioned from a coat hanger and spray painted gold, black and gold wings that looked a lot like his own, a tunic and a small harp. Meanwhile, Dean had used Bobby’s workshop to mold a pair of horns for the demon costume using resin. His clothes were just a nice, charcoal suit he had. A purple tail poked out the back, attached to a belt loop, covered by the back of his suit jacket. Their costumes were holding pretty well together, three hours into the party.
Cas stood up and let his arms fall to his sides. He gave Dean a long suffering look and shrugged. “Nothing happened. You fainted and I carried you to your bed.”
“Looking for these?” Cas asked, holding the keys out to Dean we he patted down his pockets for the millionth time.
Once they were seated with food, conversation didn’t move beyond passing each other things as they plated up and ate. Trying not to focus on the kiss, Dean tried to pull his thoughts back to the conversation they had been having before the garlic bread. Having someone to read and analyze all the books Cas had would take time and mean bringing other people into their circle. Somehow, Dean didn’t think that would go down well.
“And whenever have I said no?” Dean pointed out. He picked up a cleaning cloth and wiped down around the espresso machine.
“Cas, please,” Dean begged. Begged for Cas’s mouth to return, to be touched, to be fucked—anything to relieve the need that was slowly burning him from the inside out.
“Who ordered the Chicken Alfredo Supreme?” Dean asked his Dungeons and Dragons group as Charlie got set up at the head of her dining table, and laid a dungeon map in the center. On the map she set little miniatures that represented each of the players’ characters. The map was hand drawn on vinyl and right in front of the Dungeon Master screen that Charlie had made for herself. On the sides of the red screen, written in gold marker, were the names of player characters she had sent to the hereafter. Beside the screen was a pile of rule books and guides for Dungeons and Dragons 3.5—Charlie had made it very clear to Dean when he had initially joined the group that they did not play 4th edition under her roof. (Though she was excited by the release of 5th edition and was looking forward to seeing soon how she could move the game over to the newer rules.)
The Bunker tried to cater to all tastes and coffee habits, with free Wi-Fi, power outlets, kids toys and water bowls for dogs (there were snacks at the counter too). A wall near the front of the shop, just inside one window, had a huge cork noticeboard that heaved with events, notices and requests from in and around their local community. Done with the pot looking fine, Dean went back over to the front of The Bunker and checked over the notice board. A few things were out of date (a sign for an open mic night at a local bar, a community theatre production of
“Can you at least drive me over to have a look this weekend? Bobby said it’s a pain in the ass to find.”
Dean had showered and changed since his series of minor heart attacks. He’d even gotten some more sleep and then called Sam, asking if he wanted to come over. Dean had almost expected Sam to invite Eileen, but apparently she was teaching a Saturday art class. So Dean had headed on over to Sam’s, feeling a small twinge of regret mixed with frustration when he’d seen the place and then dampened down the moment Sam had gotten in the car.
Dean stayed by the door, leaning against the wall there. “Yep. Gonna take me a while to get some furniture together, but I’m alright for now.”
Dean sat on his stool, mouth hanging open, eyes unable to shift away from the text. He had never read anything so bizarre, so
“I wanted to drop off a care package for you. You’re like never sick, y’know. I was really worried,” Dean continued. “I heard some noises coming from the basement. So, I went to investigate and, and…”
Garth had been somewhat moodier than usual since the start of the week and that had surprised Dean, because Garth was never moody. He figured something was going on with the secret someone he hadn’t told anyone about, but Dean didn’t want to pry.
Dean opened his mouth to object to such brazenly unsympathetic treatment, but nothing came out as he tried to speak.
Dean prided himself on always being on good terms with Garth. But after finding out his boss was a werewolf? Garth coming in for his first shift since Dean had last seen him, a quiet run-of-the-mill Sunday by any other measure? Dean had the worst poker face. Which was difficult for him, because normally he had the best of poker faces.
Dean knew he was looking at the time there. “Yeah, man, it’s past work time. C’mon, time to have a beer and binge some TV.”
“Dean,” Cas reached out and touched Dean’s arm lightly, “You’re tired. I’m tired. Perhaps it’s time we call it a night, hm?” Without waiting for Dean, Cas bustled away and started leaving things in order for when anyone next started to scan.
Stack of pancakes beside him, freshly made blueberry syrup dripping from the top, Dean flicked through the auction listings he was looking at on his tablet. Charlie had set him up with a Tor browser, because what they were looking for was not available on normal, every day websites and more likely to be found in a corner of the dark net—a corner that happened to cater to practitioners of magic.
“And… I found a room on the third floor that was empty, overlooking the fountain outside. Would that be my room?”
Dean opened the door and felt his wide as he looked upon the splendor that Cas had surrounded himself with. From the tops of the walls, nearly all the way to the floors, hung richly detailed tapestries depicting all manner of bizarre and beautiful beasts. There were couches, lounges, floor pouffes in a dazzling array of styles and levels of comfort scattered about the living room. Along one wall was set a deep white marble fireplace. Here and there were sculptures ranging from classical design of people to abstract that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a modern art gallery. Then there were bookcases and bookcases stuffed full of all manner of books. The original black lacquered floorboards were covered in a series of rich rugs ranging from Persian to slightly more gaudy 60’s numbers.
Dean wasn’t panicking because he didn’t want to be out about their relationship, but the idea of a creature as impossible and immense as Cas being grateful to have Dean in his life? It made Dean feel like he could never deserve such affection.
There was no hello or any other greeting, a buzzer sounded and the front door to the apartment opened. Dean headed inside and was greeted by a foyer covered in black and white floor tiles, and walls covered in small versions of what was on the floor. It was a little dizzying. Dean tried to ignore the patterns surrounding him and concentrated on making his way to the stairwell. He headed on up and found himself wondering if he would be able to make it all the way up the stairs after a long night out and with company in tow. Coming up to the third floor, he had to admit that he was glad he wasn’t looking at somewhere on the fifth floor of the building, as he really couldn’t see him making it up to an apartment that far after a good night out. The pristine tiles might end up being less pristine.
And then there was a whoosh as Cas moved from where he had stood and to the doors out of the library, almost as if he had teleported there or moved with unimaginable speed. His true shadow continued to linger on the walls and shelves.
“Another?” Ash asked, holding out a beer to Dean, but Dean shook his head, feeling the slight wobble of his curling, purple demon horns. After what had happened, and the fact that Dean didn’t trust himself to drink too much these days, Dean had opted to stop at three bottles of beer and switch to club sodas for the rest of the night.
“I understand.” The smile didn’t leave Cas’s face. It was a level of calm happiness that Dean hadn’t expected.
“What took you both so long!” Bobby grumped, eagerly taking his bottle of beer from Sam. But neither Sam or Cas said why.
Dean just nodded to that and continued eating. They finished their meal in silence and didn’t say much to each other as they cleared their dishes away. Back in the kitchen, Dean got a beer from the fridge and offered one to Cas, who took it with a “thank you” and then led Dean back through the hotel. They started towards the foyer, but then Cas stopped in front of a doorway that Dean hadn’t really noticed before. It was closed and Cas drew out a key on a chain from around his neck and unlocked the heavy set dark lacquered doors. He pushed them open and Dean followed Cas inside.
A fresh frown creased Cas’s brow and then comprehension. He blinked hard and stepped forward, each step leaving him shaking as he got to the invisible line that marked the end of The Ddraig and the beginning of the regular street beyond. He took a deep breath and then stepped across the threshold and stood right beside Dean for a second, before taking another step onto the sidewalk. Cas looked around, astonishment clear on his face.
The Ddraig loomed in the darkness, ethereal in the moonlight, no real external lighting to speak of. Dean hadn’t come back this late since he’d moved in. Heading for the front door, he let himself in, locking the doors back up behind him. Somewhere, a clock ticked over and started ringing midnight, the chimes echoing through the immense space. There were no lights left on, which was fine, because Dean had the light of his cell phone to guide him.
Hello. I am looking for a roommate to live in my home with me. It is a former hotel and you would have one of the penthouse suites as your room, with access to the wider hotel and communal spaces. Yes, the rent is free in terms of monetary payment from you. See, my toenails have reached such an extraordinary length that it is physically impossible for me to walk now. This is where you come in: I need you, the applicant, to trim my toenails for me. And I know what you’re thinking: “Oh, that’s not that bad,” but I can assure you—it IS that bad. Using standard nail clippers on these babies will not suffice. You will need to use scissors—maybe even garden shears on them. Adequately doing so will equate to three months worth of rent. After which my toenails will have grown back to their current length, and you can trim them again for another three months of rent. They are going to keep growing. There is nothing I can do to stop it anymore. I have accepted defeat.
Sat on the bed beside Dean, Cas stayed still as he continued to speak. “Before you came, I thought I would be trapped here for eternity, which when you’ve had a near eternity of freedom, is a cruel thing indeed. So, thank you, for all of your help.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean called as he saw a tuft of Cas’s hair on the other side of his favorite chair. “Alright if Sam and I come in?”
What had been over a thousand books to begin with, Cas had managed to sort through, with help, to the ones mostly likely and likely to have information around what they were after, getting the total down to 400. But a lot of the books weren’t short and it could take some time to scan pages and verify they were okay, before handing them over to the database and translation program that Charlie had set up for the project. The three of them had put a lot of work into the project since Cas’s big reveal, with much of their free time dedicated to shifting through dusty tomes.
“Don’t be,” she said, settling. “We’ve had…plenty of time to adjust.” She looked over at her daughter; Jo’s jaw clenched.
“Yeah?” Dean asked. “What’s that?” Because, yeah Dean was a badass, but no human could top an archangel, or even Cas at the height of his powers.
“I don’t just mean physically,” Castiel sulked. He shut his eyes, looking exhausted. “You and your brother were equals.” So that was his problem. Cas had been an angel so long he’d never learned the simple basics of how humans got by. Given that Dean wasn’t the best teacher, Cas was feeling like a load Dean had to carry now.
“We will,” he said, firm, but there was an undercurrent to his words. Castiel wanted to believe him. Dean’s eyes flickered to the ground. “Listen, man, will you be alright tonight?” he asked.
Cas had picked up a trench coat the last time he and Dean had stopped over for clothes – it had been an expensive investment, but then, they hadn’t exactly paid for it either.
“I’m not your brother,” Cas said, running his thumb idly against Dean’s cheek. “And, with that in mind, I think there’s room for two.” It would be a tight fit, Dean was above six-foot-tall, and Cas wasn’t much shorter, but Cas thought it could work.
Sam suddenly seemed irritated. “No offense, Cas, but I don’t need your expert opinion here,” he said. “I need your help.” Castiel bristled. Between him and Dean, Sam gave the impression that he was the polite, well-mannered brother. Perhaps, left to his own devices, there was no one for him to contrast himself against, and Sam appeared relatively rude.
“Yeah?” Adam challenged, but his voice had none of its usual sharpness. He’d dulled around the edges, especially up here, where he should rightfully be. He was almost mild, and in his own way politer though Sam might not know it. It didn’t matter, Sam didn’t seem to take Adam’s attitude personally.
“Well, angels are terrific at delegating,” Cas muttered, sounding depressed. He frowned. “I’m sorry I can’t more helpful.”
After that, all his brain can do is pick apart an old and fuzzy memory, bloody and light-headed in Ohio, but at least he’d been with his brother then. So low and hopeless, he hadn’t even bothered praying to Jack – not believing Jack would answer and not wanting him to.
should,” Cas’s throat closed up. “It never appealed to me. As much as I wanted it to.” The thoughtful look in Dean’s eyes made him feel understood, somehow.
Cas busied himself with the bartender, and he and Dean found a table upstairs where the noise was somewhat muffled.
– can help this world so that no one ever loses their lives to hunting or hunters ever again? It’s a better idea than Dean’s ever had.
“It’s a work in progress,” he admitted. “But I’ll keep you in the loop.” There was no way Jo and Ellen knew more on the subject than Cas, and there was no sense to putting that burden on them. He’d come here to apologize, not assign homework.
It is a good night. Dean’s arms are strong and warm. Cas is not that intoxicated; he doesn’t need Dean’s help to find the bedroom, but he thinks this once he can accept Dean’s offer of assistance.
The devil was in Kansas, according to various sources, no doubt savouring the irony of dwelling where Dean had been born, or perhaps expecting some sentimentality from him. The Men of Letters had finally proved themselves useful, providing a weapon at last, and agreeing to send a team to fight alongside Dean and his people, for Dean had people. Castiel wasn’t convinced that the weapons the Men of Letters had would be useful, but they were at least
Dean had asked to stay for the next few nights and Cas was not one to deny him. They didn’t kiss again, but in bed Cas held Dean in a position Dean derisively informed him was called ‘spooning’ and it was wonderful. Cas still had no idea where he was going to live now that he wasn’t marrying Daphne, and he knew better than to burden Dean with this worry. The simple act of waking up next to Dean, unafraid, was all he could hope for.
,” Dean repeated. John scoffed and leaned back in his chair, angry and petulant – like a little kid that resented being managed. “
Cas sparks the cars alive with some remnants of his Grace, saving Dean the trouble of hotwiring them – shit that gets harder to do with each resurrection. The two of them send the civilians off without so much as a pat on the ass.
“If what you said is true, my life is about to undergo an enormous change,” he said. “You know something about that.” That landed like a punch to the gut.
“She bit me!” the bartender yelled, staggering back out into the room. He cast a horrified look of disgust behind him. “What the
“Awesome,” he said. “So, yeah. Here I am.” He held out his hands to demonstrate. Castiel was happy to see Dean, as surprised as he was, but he wasn’t really sure what to say. “So, Cas,” Dean went on, grinning lecherously over the counter. “When do you get off?”
“But, evidently you love me back, so ... the adage of not always getting what you want, or need, doesn’t always apply.” Cas is sort of rambling now, awkward and deep-voiced. Probably nervous. God knows why.
They worked diligently, in silence, just the gentle chop-chop-chop of knife on wood. He let her cut them up finer than she needed to.
“Me and my mom almost died back there,” Jo’s voice raised, not willing to capitulate. “Do you really think we can afford not to have another hunter in our corner?” Pain started whistling low in Castiel’s skull. Something was happening. He got to his feet, doing his best not to stumble as the pain built.
One regret Dean had was that he’d never been the most encouraging for Sam and school. Because he, rightly, saw school as nothing but an escape for Sam, an escape from hunting, their father, the life. And every accolade and A that Sam got was just another nail in Dean’s coffin, Dean who’d never get out. And Dean had been secretly proud, of course,
“Where are you headed, Cas?” Jo asked idly, unoffended, picking a gun off the counter and checking its safety. Her mind was still on the mission, Dean was already distracted.
“I’m a coward, Dean,” Castiel admitted. “I watched my family mistreat my sister and I did nothing to help her.” Dean frowned.
At dinner, Dean is boisterous. Jody has offered them a place to stay for the night, so they won’t have to drive to find a motel.
“We can order in,” Cas said, trying not to become too emotional, and trying his best not to leave this place, glancing at the phone behind Dean’s head.
“Castiel,” Cas concluded, sitting up and looking over at the strange man. He had a number of years on Dean, but they looked similar. Ah. “You’re Dean’s father.”
Dean scoffed, taking another swig of his beer. “I’m fine, man. A lone wolf.” He made a small howling noise to prove his point. Cas nodded slowly. Dean coughed and glanced down, as though uncomfortable. Then, roughly, he reached over to tug the beer from Cas’s grasp. “Not to pressure you, Cas.”
“Jesus,” Dean said aloud at the sight of fish bobbing in the water. Pale as death, their gray scales reflecting light like someone had dumped a bunch of knives on the ground. “The hell happened here?”
“I’m not asking you for anything, I’m just telling you the truth,” Cas snapped. “At least pay me the respect of believing me.”
Nothing was meant by it, though the ease and interest with which Dean pursued this, whatever it was, did make Cas wonder. Once, Cas shifted over to make more room for Dean and Dean, drinking, seemed to unconsciously move in to claim the space left behind. Cas resolved not to think about it too much.
“Right,” Dean sighed. Wasn’t that hungry anyway. “Can I get a whiskey? Leave the bottle.” The bartender smirked.
the logistics of Heaven. Castiel would not be hard-pressed to make the assumption that it was truly the future he had shown Dean, but, still, it tracked.
Claire has been quiet for awhile, still like a windless day, and Dean remembers who he’s talking to.
Cas got close to the back of Dean’s head, planting a kiss where his hairline met his neck, then against his neck, underneath his jaw, feeling Dean’s throat bob as he gulped.
“Yeah?” Dean coaxed. He ran a hand across the lake, fingers combing through the water. The temperature wasn’t exactly making all this pleasant and knowing what a wimp Cas could get about being sick Dean didn’t want a repeat. “That’s what we’re going with?”
looked at Dean like he believed in him, even at their worst moments. And now he loves him. It’s been a long time coming to believe any of that, but Dean does. He almost believes he deserves it because Cas kisses him like he does. Dean wants to be that man Cas thinks he sees. It’s not so much that Dean believes he can be, but that he knows he’s going to try.
Dean doesn’t want to think about it, about all the other people they might have to tell. At least Sam will tell Eileen. She’ll be nice about it, Dean knows, but he still doesn’t feel totally ready for whatever she’s going to say, not even if it’s total support. It’s just a lot.
“It’s fine, Cas,” Dean muttered, voice hoarse with whiskey and mourning, refusing to let Castiel take any of the blame. “You tried. We all tried.” He took in a deep, bitter breath, gripping the bottle in his hand tightly in his grasp. “Sam made his bed.” Dean had done his best to keep Sam out of the apocalypse, but it turned out Dean was the one taking the backseat.
Dean folded up the sopping material and set it down in the trunk. As he was there, he pulled out some spare clothes from the back, pants for himself and a shirt for Cas. The only other pants left over were…not Dean’s, and they were tall on Cas but Cas’d just have to sleep in the bed he’d made in that regard.
They spent the rest of their dinner in relative silence. The waitress tried to split their cheques but Castiel stubbornly paid for both. Shucking his coat back on, Cas noticed Dean’s eyes catch on someone behind him. Curious, Cas turned.
Cas hands Miracle’s reins over to Dean. He sticks his hands in his pockets and turns over Dean’s confession in his mind as they walk.
“What was the message?” Castiel spoke up. They had to keep the conversation relevant. Ellen turned to look at him, and then back to her daughter.
. I could die never touching another tit, and I’d die happy. I wanna go steady, baby. I wanna wear your class ring and letterman jacket.”
“Damn it, okay, we’ll figure it out,” he said. “We’ll fix this.” Castiel nodded. He believed him. He let Dean drive them home.
“Dean,” Cas snapped. “It was the right thing to do, and I helped.” Dean opened his mouth to argue, but there wasn’t a good argument to what Cas had said and he knew it. Castiel
been thinking about on his own time anyhow. That maybe they should look and see if there’s a way that their son – who is literally
“Yeah, sure,” Dean said, unconvinced. Cas kissed his neck again and again felt Dean relax in his arms, a perfect call and response.
“I should be,” Castiel said, not sure what the alternative would be. He certainly wasn’t going to go out drinking again. He’d had enough for now. “Dean I…” Castiel glanced away. “I don’t know what to do. Who to follow. I’ve been—chasing God—my entire existence. And now…now I know that He’s running, and I don’t—”
Instead of giving them the information they wanted, the demon talked. About how he had met Sam in Stanford, in the years when Dean was gone from his life, how he’d introduced Sam to the woman he had loved and lost. How she and Sam had both thought they were friends. How he’d been the one to kill her.
“Take a chance on me?” Dean suggested, giving her a little grin, the kind that showed off his teeth in a way he knew women liked. She looked him over, chewing on a smile. “I’m Dean,” he introduced himself, feeling a little cocky. “Dean Winchester.”
“It’s possible the monster could be doing either,” Cas said. “Though, personally I hope for the former. I can help victims that are in the process of being turned; I can’t bring people back from the dead.”
gave you any indication?” Dean challenged, leaning forward. Dean found himself in Cas’s space, just a few inches away from his face, and felt the air around them singe.
“Yeah, he found me,” Sam sighed. “He told me I had to ‘play my role’ in the Apocalypse and get possessed by Lucifer.” It was bizarre, the way Sam worded it, as though Lucifer was a common demon and not an angel, not unlike Castiel, who required consent. Sam glanced over at Castiel. “You guys will be happy to know I’m not—I’m not champing at the bit.”
“Alright Cas,” he said. “You think emotions are superpowers. Now you’re human, more or less. Still feel like that?” Cas retracted himself from Dean’s space, frowning a little. Dean regretted being so harsh on him. Leaning over a little into Cas’s space he muttered, “You’re trying your best, Cas, alright?”
“Don’t all standard decks have fifty-two?” Castiel asked, narrowing his eyes. Dean laughed out loud and decided he could afford to let Cas steal a sip from his shake.
Dean scrubbed some more, wondering who had told him. Sam, maybe. But then, angelic hearing and all, Cas might’ve heard it through the walls.
“Morning Cas!” Nora greeted. Fortunately, she looked more relieved than annoyed to see him. Castiel had woken up after his alarm. He’d stayed up late the night before working on a paper and, waking up, he’d fumbled around for his work shirt by the door and barely caught his bus in time.
Mostly, Cas healing Dean felt strange, like Cas had Dean’s body speeding through the hot flush of swelling and bruising in a matter of seconds. But, there was also a part of being healed that always felt nice too, relieving. It was hard to say if it was the absence of pain, or the presence of Cas’s hand, careful and caring. He was an angel, after all, and getting a little taste of Heaven and Grace was sweet enough at times to be dangerous to folks like Dean.
“Doesn’t matter,” he said. “We’re here.” Cas turned his head to follow Dean’s gaze to the map clenched in his fist. Dean caught Cas’s eye. After years of feeling so much less aware about the world than Cas, it felt strange. He took out the map and rolled it open across the hood of the Impala and he traced the lines with his finger till he found what he was after.
“Jeez, Cas,” Dean said, leaning back to Cas’s regret. “Beer isn’t going to make you see little green men. It’s natural, but it ain’t shrooms.”
“Definitely not Kumar,” Claire pipes up. Cas is pleased that she’s old enough to understand his own reference.
“Dunno,” Dean admitted. “Something with the engine, I think. Maybe the battery.” He was trying really hard not to lose his shit. Of all the places to break down, while it wasn’t the best, it wasn’t the worst. Place wasn’t hot with Croats, for one. But Dean would need a lot more than what he had to check out what the issue was, and the sun was starting to climb down in the sky.
But Cas’s mouth on Dean’s throat. He’d handed Dean a whole new can of worms and a can opener to boot. Because Dean’s times with men, and there’d just been the few, hadn’t mattered. There’d been some almosts, too, now that he thought about it. That detective back in Arkansas, a bartender, a soldier on leave, here and there, never hunters. The ones where they’d look at each other and see each other were probably worse than the midnight fucks, because there had been some sort of weird potential.
“I know,” he said after a moment. For all his flaws, he didn’t seem to be as needlessly pigheaded as Dean. But then Sam pressed, “I know I should stay out of this. I know. I just—how can I, Cas? How can you ask that of me?” Just like Dean, Sam was righteous.
“Take off your shoes,” Jesse ordered and Cas reached down slowly to comply, as did Dean. He kicked over his set of shoes to the woman who picked them up, running her hands along the inside.
He reached out, running a hand down Dean’s back, before leaning down against him, pressing him into the mattress.
Dean came in the room with a ten minute or so lag behind Castiel. He might have been working with the car, he might have been talking to the receptionist. “Getting set up?” he asked, shrugging off his leather jacket. Cas’s throat felt too tight to answer. Instead, he got a change of clothes together—a crumpled shirt, clean underwear, socks, a pair of comfortable pants.
“I’m sorry,” she said. “I don’t know how to channel him. Are you certain you don’t have something he’s touched?” Castiel frowned. But Dean remembered, Donnie Finnerman.
“Oh, we got comebacks now,” Dean praised, hoping Cas wasn’t too drunk to miss the sarcasm. Cas rolled his eyes, no doubt feeling rebellious. “How much did you drink?”
And Dean and Cas had no choice but to travel countercurrent, where even in Nebraska it had started to be an issue. They had nabbed a couple room in what once had been a four-star hotel but nowadays the service was nonexistent. Cas was passed out on a king-sized mattress in one of the adjacent rooms while Dean had claimed the presidential suite. He’d tried to enjoy it, but the grandness just succeeded in making him feel alone—like a buoy bobbing forgotten in the middle of an ocean.
The move, embarrassingly, makes Dean gasp out loud, but screw it, who is he saving face for? Cas’s fingers hook around his underwear, and Dean just shudders. Cas angles his wrist and suddenly he’s sinking down past Dean’s stomach, crossing into Dean’s underwear. It takes all Dean’s willpower not to sigh or moan. He holds his breath.
Dean had heard Cas approach, the creak of his shoes soft on the floor. Dean could appreciate him not sneaking anymore, he was getting too old for the jump scares. He glanced over at Cas, acknowledging him with a short nod.
“Dean, we don’t have to,” Cas insisted, though he was surprised to hear Dean admit that he’d tried touching himself. It was a topic he wanted to circle back to, but, given that Dean had said his exploits had yet been uneventful, “I like it when you penetrate me, but if you don’t want to do the same, then we don’t need to –”
“I’m meeting Claire tomorrow,” Cas explained, softer now. “She’s been seeing signs relating to Kaia, and she’s worried. I was just passing through.”
Castiel understood. Physics, and indeed most upper-level science, built upon pre-established principles. Cas grabbed a pen and some printer paper, just in case Dean needed him to draw some diagrams. Dean looked faintly embarrassed, but Cas nodded encouragingly. “So, I didn’t take physics in high school,” Dean explained. It clearly wasn’t easy for Dean to ask Castiel questions, but he wanted to understand.
“I thought you were a warrior of God,” Dean shot back, unimpressed. “Little head cold gonna take you out?” Castiel glared fitfully at Dean beneath the sheets, flipping over onto his side. Dean reached over, willing to baby the baby, pressing his fingers to Cas’s forehead. The skin burned to the touch. Dean must’ve pulled a face because Cas noticed.
“Screw that,” Dean started up again. “What if they trap you or something?” Castiel turned his eye on Dean. He expected the Men of Letters would have precautions against angels, but currently he didn’t much care.
In the beginning, it took two hours for neutrons and protons to pool together, like little dancers whipping into shape. As the universe cooled further—electrons began to join the dance, and from that came hydrogen, and—stunningly—hints of helium. And Castiel had watched, like a child beneath fireworks on the fourth of July, he had gaped in awe.
He couldn’t believe it, when he’d read it. Skewered on a makeshift hook in a barn in Ohio, bleeding out in his brother’s arms. Half-vindicated, half-endlessly depressed, to see it written.
“Right,” he agreed, voice splintering in his throat. He swallowed. But the way Cas looked over at Dean, eyes wide, panicked like he was begging Dean to not change his mind about him based on this revelation. So, Dean put a pin in it.
Dean had to consider Cas’s question. “You miss any of them?” he asked after a long moment. And Cas didn’t speak for awhile either. Apparently, he needed a moment too.
This other Charlie could probably pony up some decent advice, too, everyone knows this stuff better than Dean does, but Dean can’t imagine baring his underbelly to her. Especially since all the while he’d probably be thinking about how Jack sent her back to the land of the living but still kept
“I thought my lack of attraction to women was simply a—manifestation of my loyalty to God.” It sounded funny to say out loud but the reality of it still stung, an old ache. “But while I appreciated God’s design, to marry a woman—to live with one as a man should, as
And maybe those were just hollow words, but Dean could see it brought some of the weight off of Sam’s shoulders.
“Maybe,” Dean said. He sounded exhausted. “Sounds like a hell of a longshot and like a guy called Death maybe, just
He took a breath. “When Sam left, Dad told him not to come back,” he said. “And I just…let Sam walk. I was mad, because he got to leave and go to school, and I had to stay and hunt. And I mean, I love hunting, and I know it’s the right thing to do. But me and Sam, we haven’t spoken in…man, we’ve barely spoken since.”
In all his travels with the Winchesters, the only time Castiel has really gone to the coast was by himself. Dean’s talk of it had made him curious of it, but once he had gone there all he had really done was miss Dean.
Castiel felt like he was walking into another world as he stepped into Bobby’s home. It seemed both cluttered and empty somehow – full of books, but not much else. Bobby had clearly lived here for a long time, but there were no picture frames, or anything that Cas had come to expect from normal households. Then again, given Bobby’s apparent familiarity with the world of hunting, this likely wasn’t a normal household.
Cas snapped his fingers and the lights in the kitchen came on. Dean winced. “Thanks,” he muttered, finding the cutlery drawer and grabbing a fork. “Sure you should be wasting your juice like that?” Truth be told, Dean wasn’t completely well-versed on the logistics of Grace, but he figured it’d be like saving water. Castiel didn’t reply and Dean grumbled to himself and finished his pie before heading to the bathroom to clean up.
Anna cracked a smile. “I don’t have a degree, if it makes you feel any better,” she offered. It was different. No one in their church had ever been encouraged to seek secondary education, Castiel had managed to weasel his way in under the guise of receiving more religious education, and then working his way into appreciating God’s mathematical design.
Loving your parents could be like attending church. They had to get you young. It didn’t always stick. And the instinct to question what was preached had you questioning yourself before anything else.
He bought Cas some taquitos and a pizza box, grabbing a ginger ale to expand the food groups of Cas’s first real meal. He raced back to the Impala, nearly getting run over by some dick driving too fast for gas station lot anyhow. The dude even had the gall to
Cas. “I used to be able to control my hair growth. Even my sweat.” Dean pulled a face at the TMI, but Cas went on. “Now I’m just…filthy all the time,” he muttered. He ran a hand across his jaw. “This helped, somewhat.” Dean nodded.
“Dean told me he was a researcher of the paranormal,” he offered. “That the two of you were writing a book.” John raised an eyebrow.
“Dean,” Cas said again, reaching over and touching Dean’s face. And Dean couldn’t help but turn his face into Cas’s hand, his warm palm, tears bleeding onto Cas’s skin.
It was strange for Dean to see his mom and dad try to fit the pieces back together again. They had pumped the brakes slightly, a move Dean could respect, but he also didn’t want to look too closely. He didn’t need or want to see them feeling things out again; they were still his parents for Christ’s sake.
“No,” Cas said. Dean had become jittery in Cas’s silence. “Maybe that speaks to my lack of imagination. But I’m not . . .” if Cas had any sense he would take the opportunity to be spiteful, but he didn’t. He couldn’t.
Being out on the docks was even worse than being in the water thanks to the windchill. They wandered back to the Impala and opened the trunk. Dean had fished Cas’s coat out of the lake, completely drenched. “Guess that’s one way to give this thing a wash,” he mused conversationally. Cas’s face fell. Something was eating him.
“Wendy,” he nodded. “You can show Cas the other rooms, I’ll catch up.” Jesus Christ. He definitely hadn’t told the realtor he and Cas were—involved, but here they were, already married in Massachusetts as far as she knew. Kind of funny, if it wasn’t so annoying.
“Sorry guys,” Dean said to Sam and Eileen, taking Cas towards the dance floor that had been set up, with spooky disco lights flashing over the space. Cas deposited his harp beside the floor and followed.
“Dean, you cannot be serious!” Sam howled down the phone. Or at least that’s what it sounded like to him. He suspected Charlie must have said something to Sam since that morning, but Dean didn’t feel that betrayed. It wasn’t like Sam could stop him, and if he hadn’t wanted him out of the house so soon, Dean wouldn’t have even considered it.
Dean gulped and opened up the moisturizer, the argan oil in it offering a light citrus smell and squirted a small amount onto the top of Cas’s right foot. Raising his hands, Dean gripped either side, sliding his thumbs through the white glob of moisturizer and started to push it around the lightly damp skin of Cas’s foot. Spread and push, spread and push. Thumbs circling and then his other fingers joining in as he worked the moisturizer to the sole of Cas’s foot and down to his heel and up to his toes. Then he started in on the joints around Castiel’s toes and a moan escaped Cas as he noticeably relaxed back into the cushions of his high backed chair. The rumbling moan traveled through Dean, vibrating through his core and dick.
Dean took his time, sat in the car, brain churning more than it had when he’d seen the whole of Cas for the first time. Cas he’d known for only just over a month, but Garth? He thought he knew Garth. Thought Garth was awesome and had a secret beau he didn’t want anyone to know about. But all of a sudden, the monthly trips started to make sense, because if Dean accepted that the creature in the basement had indeed been Garth, then he also needed to accept that those trips were Garth becoming that… whatever it was, and hunkering down in the basement.
Closing the ballroom doors behind him, Dean set down the lamp and began setting out what he needed for the spell. He was halfway through drawing a series of complex diagrams on the tiles and walls in chalk when Sam opened the doors and slipped inside.
Not that Dean was there at The Bunker on Monday, because Cas had encouraged Dean to move in from the start of the week after a quick visit to drop off the lease. And Dean couldn’t blame him—he was still having difficulties with his nails. Dean had offered to cut them there and then, but Cas was insistent Dean moved in first so that Cas could show he would keep up his end of things. Dean had also been watching videos on pedicures and amateur podiatry in order to figure out how to deal with Cas’s nails and make sure his feet stayed healthy, in among packing his life into boxes.
A low, muffled growl. Like a dog waiting menacingly behind a front door. Dean was pretty sure Garth didn’t have a dog.
Dean turned and walked away from the kitchen. When he’d first heard them talking, he’d expected Sam to give Cas just the usual talk, adapted for a dragon of course (not eating him being high on the list) but he didn’t expect Sam to feel that protective of him. At least not after asking Dean to finally move out. He had two people in his life now that wanted what was best for Dean, not for themselves, and Dean found he struggled to understand or accept that.
“Yeah. I don’t know how big of a but, but Charlie would need to come here to help with it. And… to make it easier she would need to know what we’re up to. Because then she’ll have an idea of how to help us frame searches when everything is scanned.” Dean looked hopefully at Jack and Cas. “Well, what do you think?”
A cool fall breeze blew for a moment and Dean felt himself sighing in relief as Bobby secured the doors of the van.
The five of them debated out of character for several minutes what their likely course of action would be and then they got into character. Between bites of pizza and rolling D20s (twenty sided dice), the five of them went to Ger and tried to break him out as discreetly as possible. Dean let everyone’s enjoyment of the game fill him as he played, allowing himself to just sink into the fictional world that they had made together with Charlie over the past year. Not having to think about himself for a while and just his character was always a welcome relief and something that had been touched on in his sessions with Dr. McLeod a few times.
Above him, Cas sighed and then sat down next to Dean. He scooted over to him and dimly, Dean was aware of arms wrapping around him from the side, of the heat of another body joining his own, the heat bleeding through his shirt and jeans. It was like sitting beside a radiator and that was what Dean needed after what had happened downstairs. Cas breathed with purpose and soon Dean found the rapid breaths he’d been taking slowly leveled out and he was breathing something approaching normal, his heart rate slowed back down to a more typical pace.
Normally Dean could get more conversation out of Cas, but since the whole mess had become more real for everyone, it had been tough to talk. He’d asked the usual questions he’d asked any of his friends, like Charlie—
Glancing up from the obscure pentagram design he had just finished on one wall, Dean gave Sam a nervous grin. “It’s the final spell, Sam.”
“Okay.” Sam faced Dean and gave him a sad smile. “Eileen’s, uh, looking to start moving in next Saturday.”
Scrambling out of the front door, unable to hit the exit button fast enough, Dean raced outside and reached the side of the Impala. The air was warm and there was no wind, not even a breeze. Bent over, Dean sucked in big lungfuls of air and tried to get himself composed. The street was pretty much empty, bar him and so there was no one to see his freakout. It took a while, but slowly his heart slowed from a heart attack to a gentle jog and Dean straightened up to look back at the converted warehouse-cum-apartment building.
Glancing back down to the impossible nails, Dean could understand that maybe the medical profession might take advantage of Castiel’s situation or decide to treat him like some kind of freak. He met Castiel’s eyes again and there was a sincere look there, begging for Dean to help.
Remembering something from one of the videos he’d watched, Dean asked, “Do you have a bath you might be able to soak your feet and nails in?”
And with no gym or golf for the foreseeable future, working out from home was something that Dean was taking the time to get use to. He’d found an online instructor who had some good videos for core workouts and HIT with minimal kit in the home. It helped that Benny and his assistant Pamela were pretty sweet looking, but Dean was genuinely getting a good long work out each morning.
Dean got to his feet and stretched, spine and shoulders popping as he did. “Yeah, I think so. Unless you don’t need me to move out?”
“I’ve trawled my personal library many times before, but perhaps there is something I’ve missed? Perhaps with a fresh pair of eyes on things we might find some hint somewhere that will lead us to a previously hidden footnote.”
an iron stomach. Garth’s silver earring in the right ear phase—concern and best poker face. But that silver stud took on a whole lot more meaning in hindsight, when Dean considered it, because what had been passed off as it getting infected and healing over meant something else now.
Without any further warning, Dean started to cut Castiel’s nails back down again and while doing it he wondered why Cas’s nails grew the way that they did. Working carefully at every single nail in turn, Dean slowly came to the conclusion that it was a little like how nails on pet dogs or cats worked. If nails don’t get worn down enough from everyday use and movement then the nails normally needed to be clipped.
Dean suppressed a growl at the thought of Cas’s scent attracting others. Especially while he was homeless and vulnerable. It was no secret how much danger omegas living on the street faced. Castiel could have wound up in a really dangerous situation. It was no wonder he’d hidden his omega status.
“-Oh, Sam is gonna want some of that Neutru spray. We probably will too, honestly. The smell of another alpha might be uncomfortable for you, and I’m sure Sam won’t wanna smell us.”
“Hell if I know! The ideal thing to do would be to bring that feathery bastard back, but we have no way to do that. I don't know what to do, but we can't just sit here with our thumbs up our asses waiting for Dean to snap. There has to be something we can do, or someone that can help.”
Dean sighed, he didn't know if he could talk about this with Sam, but his brother wasn't giving him much of a choice. He continued to stare Dean down, unrelenting, waiting for him to start talking. Dean stopped slouching and sat up a little, he just wanted to get this over with so he could try to stop thinking about it. He wouldn't have to say much, just something to sate his brother's curiosity.
Sam, thankfully much quicker at realizing what was going on, held his hands up in surrender, titled his head to expose his neck, and allowed himself to be moved down the hall. Even as his brother, Dean’s alpha still saw Sam as a threat. It was a base instinct, nothing Dean could control. So Sam submitted. It was quicker than reasoning with Dean and would calm him and probably Castiel much faster.
Now all the pieces clicked. Castiel was Emanuel. Somehow, the angel had survived the leviathans, but didn't remember any of his past life, or who he was. That explained why he was a genuine healer. He was still an angel. Sam shook Emanuel's outstretched hand, his own shaking a little as he did his best to act like he didn't know the man in front of him.
Sam spun around at the new voice. Emanuel was standing just inside the door, wide eyed and... He almost looked scared.
The kettle whistled, and Dean moved it off the burner. He could smell Sam getting impatient as he ignored the question in favour of getting out Cas’s favourite mug. It was something cheesy Dean had seen at the store and bought for him on a whim. It was white, with a green aloe plant on one side, and the words “
Castiel stopped and looked down the path leading through the heavily treed park. It was only about fifty yards to the other side and the car, but still, he couldn't seen anything through the trees, it was so dark in there.
The man in the camouflage vest swallow nervously. He wasn't totally sure the giant in front of him wouldn't take another swing, and his nose was already causing him great pain. He squeezed past Sam, who still didn't move, or stop glaring. His fists were still clenched. Sheepishly, Gary walked over to Dean and Cas. He couldn't meet the glares he got from either of them, not to mention the looks he was getting from the other people in the bar. He deciding instead to stare at the floor or the walls.
The angel went back upstairs to the room the older Winchester had been staying in. Up the stairs and the first and only door on the left. Castiel entered the room and looked around.
Cas pushed the purple flannel off Dean’s shoulders and helped him pull it off. His fingertips brush lightly against the exposed skin of Dean’s arms, leaving goosebumps in their wake.
It was the same bar Dean had stumbled into weeks ago at ten in the morning, asking for a drink because his boyfriend had just come back from the dead.
His angel hadn't changed much, at least, his vessel hadn't. Put on a few more pounds, maybe, but that was about it. He looked good. Well cared for. From what Dean could tell, Castiel had been eating and sleeping at least once in a while. And showering. The angel didn't smell like the Winchesters after a hunt anymore, he smelled clean and fresh, and looked it too.
“What's going on over there?” he asked, motioning to where the van had just been, and where the box still lay. He didn't sound anything more than curious and maybe a tad concerned at that point. Sam hoped he could get the gun away from his brother before that changed.
And how Sam, looking rumpled in his shirt and slacks after work, could just be on point but just remarking about Dean’s apparent paleness—Dean didn’t know, but he cringed inwardly. “Yeah. I uh… um… think I might be coming down with something?” Because no way in hell was he about to tell Sam that he thought he’d encountered a ghost that afternoon.
Snaking his right hand down his chest and towards his pelvis, Dean cupped his growing hardon through his jeans and squeezed, making himself gasp and buck up into his own hand. He was like a horny teenager again, the way he couldn’t get Cas out of his thoughts as he unbuttoned his jeans and pushed them down along with his boxers. Gripping himself, pre-come already beading at the tip, Dean could smell his own arousal as he took an experimental stroke, pumping his cock as it filled further. With a moan, Dean scooted off the bed, quickly undressing himself and finding his bottle of lube tucked into his night stand. Pumping a few dollops of the sticky white liquid onto himself, Dean took himself in hand again, and scooted up against his head board, resting against the pillows as he stroked.
“Thanks,” Dean said as the tray was set down on his bedside table. He sat with his back against the headboard and took the Tylenol. The cold water felt good against his throat.
“It still doesn’t make any sense. Look, lemme check in with my contact down at the police department. I didn’t even know there was a hotel there in that part of town.” Sam finished his beer and then turned to the dirty dishes that needed to be sorted. Dean rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything, though he was secretly glad that Sam wanted him to be safe when he moved. It wasn’t like Dean had been in a good head space when he’d moved in just over a year prior, or the year before that when he’d lived on his own.
“Supposedly it’s a thing. Or at least cockatrices were. The shit is really rare these days,” Dean explained. As if gathering magic spell ingredients was an everyday occurrence for him—which it pretty much was at that moment.
“At least they’re not getting married yet,” Dean pointed out. “I never understood people getting married before living together for a spell—you have no idea if they’re someone you can even live with and you’re signing a legally binding contract with them, essentially.”
And before Sam said anything, Dean could guess what was up for discussion. The timing—a year since Dean moved in. The weekend trip to Wichita with Eileen two weeks prior. The sudden interest in Ikea furniture.
Cas gave a thoughtful, calculating look, eyes darting towards the roof of the Impala and then focused back on Dean. “It’s a blood moon tomorrow,” he said, like that explained everything Dean had seen.
“He’s not going to hurt you!” Dean yelled over her. “If he wanted to eat anyone, he could have done it to me when I first stepped foot here. And he hasn’t touched a hair on my head!”
Dean stepped up beside Cas and placed a reassuring hand on the small of Cas’s back. “I’m sure, together, we can think of something.”
It didn’t matter how many times their younger son, Sam, an ER doctor, told John to stay the hell at home and why (in detail), John had still been trying to sneak off for drinks with the boys. Their mom, Mary, was a saint for handling it all and had been taking Sam’s advice very seriously.
“Here,” Cas said, handing the brown envelope to Dean, “is a contract. I suggest you read this over carefully. Call me when you have and let me know for sure that you wish to live here.”
Beneath Dean’s hands, the top of the side board he’d picked up from Goodwill, slowly lost its terrible orange paint job and revealed the original turn of the century oak beneath. It was nothing special, but Dean thought it would be a good place to store board games and tabletop gaming supplies, in case he wanted Charlie and the gang over. It was Dean’s Saturday off again and it was feeling like the days were flying by since he’d moved into The Ddraig just two weeks ago.
Getting off the couch, Dean took his tablet and went to the stove. Turning the oven on to a low temperature, he expected the lasagna to be just right after about twenty minutes. He sat down at their breakfast bar and returned to looking through listings.
Dean pulled off his gloves and pushed the goggles back. “Do you mind if I head over to Bobby’s? Then I’ll have access to all manner of tools.” He hoped Bobby wouldn’t mind the early evening intrusion.
, Dean thought and sighed, trying to think of anything other than the mystery of what his roommate spent his life doing.
Unasked, Sam pressed the back of his hand to Dean’s forehead, which was surprisingly warm. “Uh, you’re clammy, that’s for sure. I’ll make some soup for dinner. Head back to bed and I’ll get you some Tylenol, okay?”
Switching to his browser, he searched for news around the street he was on. It took some unique terms, but he eventually found an old newspaper archive that talked of an accident that had happened when it had been a warehouse and not an apartment complex. It was over a century ago, when Sioux Falls was still growing, and the railroad first came to the city. An accident involving a volatile substance of some description. Checking a local history website, Dean still couldn’t find out what exactly, but he confirmed that two people died in the accident.
Dean may have not been running off to Sammy, but he still wasn’t comfortable staying at The Ddraig. “Must be lonely, but look—why is there a ghost here?”
“You’re welcome to come here or I can come to you if you’d rather?” Unsaid was the insinuation that Dean wouldn’t necessarily want to be near Jack.
“Look, it says right here, I get all that, so long as I cut his toenails every few months. I just need to buy my own food and cook it. I have to keep my own room clean and tidy, I even get a free parking spot, but figure it’s a pretty sweet deal overall.”
if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person. Hell, I don’t even tell my therapist I can see ghosts. And if I say the truth to Sam… I could never lie to him and say something like, it turned out you played Celine Dion all night or whatever—Sam’s going to see through that eventually. And then I’ll crack, say the wrong thing and, yeah. Goodbye life. Hello, three square meals with a side of pills and all the pudding I want.” Dean slumped over the counter top.
Looking away from Cas, Dean decided he didn’t know what to do with himself. His cell had once been a source of pleasant distraction, but in the past few weeks it had increasingly become a source of rising blood pressure and headaches. Picking up his coffee, Dean tried to figure out what to do with himself if he wasn’t working for the rest of the day. With the two of them locked down, they’ been taking it in turns to cook dinner and sometimes lunch—it wasn’t Dean’s turn to cook, but he was bored.
“Uh-huh, well I’m heading to the shop,” Dean called over to his shoulder as he opened the front door. “I’m fine. See you this evening.”
“Cas what are you going on about? Are you about to tell me you’re some kind of uber ghost? Because if you are, you’re the exact opposite of every ghost I’ve encountered. You have a pulse and body heat for one.”
Sam closed his mouth, and nodded firmly. The two of them trailed downstairs and argued over what they were going to watch. They were still working their way through Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, but Dean was in more of a film mood now that he was downstairs. Heading into the kitchen he asked Sam to create a shortlist while Dean popped some corn on the stove.
Dean didn’t respond and was dimly aware of Cas walking around the car and getting in on the passenger side. Cas closed the door and the
Sam, Eileen, Cas, Jack and John were all in a den that Cas had set up in what must normally be a private reception room. So far, no one had killed each other, despite helping to put Christmas decorations up. It was Christmas Eve, and there was already a real Christmas tree in the hotel with presents underneath it. Stockings. A fireplace. Dean couldn’t quite get over how far they were pushing the Christmas thing, but with Cas and Jack having a lot of catching up to do with celebrating cheer and good will to all sentient beings, Dean had figured they should go for it. Everyone was staying at the hotel.
It wasn’t curiosity that made Dean’s feet walk him towards the open door. No. It was a sense of foreboding as the temperature started to drop, the closer he got to the wing, phone light illuminating a small sphere in front of him. A part of him knew he should just turn away, maybe just give up on living anywhere and run all the way back to his car and drive back to Sam’s.
“Dude, you seem pretty okay with me being able to see ghosts and think that a ghost lives in this place, so I think we’re pretty well past that.”
Heading into the ensuite, Dean took in the partially drunk glass of water and the bookmark between the pages of Cas’s book, which had shown he’d made significant progress through the novel. Dean for a moment wondered what Cas’s secret was to reading that fast, but then pushed the thought away as he hurried over to the tub and started pulling things out of the bag. He handed Cas a pair of goggles and a respirator, and helped him put them on. Then Dean put a matching pair of goggles and respirator on himself. Then, from out of the bag he pulled out an extension cord and ran it out to an outlet in Castiel’s room and then plugged a Dremel into it. A selection of Dremel attachments were set side in a box beside it. Then Dean pulled out bolt cutters of various sizes, huge metal files that were usually used in woodwork and a Japanese wood saw: he set them all down neatly on the tiles beside the tub.
“Toenails, Dean. Toenails!” Charlie passed Dean’s cell back. “What if they have a fungal infection? And how does anyone’s toenails grow that much, that fast?! They just don’t, Dean. They just don’t.”
Garth looked to the door, saw no one and smiled warmly at Dean. “Look, something has been up with you all day and I really can’t put my finger on it. Is everything okay? You settled in alright at your new place?”
Frowning, Cas left his door open as he went in and did as Dean asked. A few minutes later he was bundled up, thick jacket and boats, a knitted beanie on his head. He thrust a spare beanie, in red yarn, at Dean and made him put it on.
Charlie closed her eyes and took a deep breath before opening them again. She cradled her latte between her hands. “At least wait until Sam’s found out if there’s any history with this guy or that place, huh?”
“So, Wisconsin?” Dean guessed, thinking of the trip that had led Dean in charge of the store with Aaron for a few weeks, rather than days.
The Ddraig slowly revealed itself to Sioux Falls, as they wound down the spell that had kept it shrouded from the world. But Cas’s status as a dragon remained known only to Dean, Charlie, Sam, Eileen and Jack.
“Roommate must be able to geek out about the show Paranormal!” Dean muttered to himself. “What the hell kind of show is that?!” Dean then moved into a new tab and hit up search. After ten minutes he was suddenly wondering if maybe the show was available on Netflix or something, because it sounded pretty cool. Shifting back to his apartment listings, he scrolled some more, mood deflating with each one he read until one in particular caught his eye:
“Already have a viewing for tomorrow afternoon.” And he did. Dean wasn’t stupid, he’d already started looking for somewhere new to rent, heading out to have a look at places several times a week between shifts at the coffee shop and his
Before the situation could get any more awkward, Dean strode off back to the main foyer and proceeded to the main desk to get his bearings. There were dual sweeping staircases that swept around the desk area on either side, carrying on up to the next floor and the floor above that. He looked to his right from the desk, and saw an immense pair of double doors that had a construction warning sign stuck to the wood there and all kinds of bright hazard tape.
“Because I am looking forward to the Halloween party!” Garth grinned and then his face went serious. “So, what’s up?”
When Dean had needed help, Sam had come for him in Michigan and brought him all the way home to Sioux Falls. Driving a rental there and driving the Impala back with his few things. But a year was a long time, and Dean knew Sam had likely found “the one”—what Sam and Eileen had was something he didn’t want to get in the way of, in spite of the envy that was starting to creep up on him. But whether he moved to The Ddraig hotel or somewhere else, it was going to be a change. And Dean wasn’t historically great with change, though there was no way he’d move back to Lawrence, Kansas to live with their parents again.
With Cas’s right foot in his lap again, Dean wondered what he had been thinking as he finished sorting Cas’s cuticles. Because the next course of action was to moisturize Cas’s feet and there was no way he could do it without it being some type of foot massage. It had seemed like such a thoughtful thing to do and necessary for the guy who was letting him rent for the mere inconvenience of cutting impossible toenails. But Dean could remember all the times he’d massaged the feet of Cassie and Lisa, and what that had led to. They were in the guy’s bedroom, for god’s sake!
playing and all his mind wanted to focus on was the deliciousness of Cas and just everything about him. The door to his rooms were locked and Dean had to give up fighting his imagination and hormones.
Dean whistled and stepped over to the counter by Cas, leaning against it. As he stood there for a moment, feeling Cas’s warmth. “I mean, I didn’t even know magic was real until today and you’re saying that’s a possibility?”
He locked himself in his rooms, food forgotten for the moment, as he dumped everything and jogged into his bathroom, locking the door behind him. He’d at least set out towels for himself ahead of time, but Dean got the shower going in its cubicle near his own huge bathtub, and got in. The water was cold and he kept it that way.
“But Ger might know where that cave is!” Dorothy piped up. Her character was a wheeling-and-dealing dwarf rogue who liked to find ways to fill her pockets with gold and jewels as often as possible.
Now, Dean would have just offered to carry Cas to a seat and get his tools, but at that moment Sam had decided that he and Eileen should take advantage of the key that Dean had given him at the start of the month. The doors to the kitchen slapped open and shut and footsteps approached from the far side of the room.
“Stop it! If you have Eileen living with you, you can’t go hiding your face like that.” Dean grinned.
“Dean?” Cas asked curiously as Dean leaned into his space and kissed him. Then kissed him again, opening Cas’s mouth with his own, pushing into Cas’s mouth the whiskey he’d just sipped. Cas moaned low in the back of his throat as Dean chased the whiskey and then pulled Dean onto his lap so that he was balanced on the same stool as him. Dean had his arms wrapped around Cas as he sat on him sideways, exchanging kisses until Dean started to find the day catching up with.
Dean thought about it. “Maybe, but it’s a long time to spend sitting down on the floor. Maybe Cas would let me use the main dining room? Place is huge. Big tables. Plenty of chairs. I could, like, cook us all up something. Maybe make some homemade gumbo or something? Benny shared his recipe with me a few weeks back.”
came and Dean had had some lovely rehearsing sessions with a transfer student who liked to run his lines with Dean. Not that anyone in Dean’s family or the wider school knew this. And Charlie only knew it, because, well, Dean felt safe talking to her about that sort of thing.
