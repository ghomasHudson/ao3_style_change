“He regenerates, right?” Tony had remembered reading something about that on Wade’s file.
Morgan appreciated her parents playing nice. She could probably thank her grandma’s presence for that, but she’d take what she could get. Peter limited his interactions with his mom and Steve noticed. When he inquired about it, Tony glanced over at Peter asking him if he wanted to tell his father or should he?
Pepper, Bucky and Sam talked among themselves once the man had left. Steve could feel himself sinking into a corner but Pepper assured him, she’d get him the best lawyer and they would win the case. Tony would pay for all the pain he’d caused Steve and they would get little Nicky back.
“Where are you getting your news from mother?” Tony wondered out loud.
Steve didn’t know why he even bothered. They were like the same person now after years of being together. That use to be him and Tony. “I know.” He acknowledged. “I just couldn’t bring myself to sleep with another man that wasn’t Tony.” It was a good notion but it still didn’t change the fact that he was sleeping with someone that wasn’t Tony, even if it wasn’t a man.
"It's not your fault. People are so evil." Steve informed him. Tony was a good man. Kind, honest, caring. Just a good person and Steve wanted to make him happy.
“They’re about to have a total of 4 kids in a couple weeks.”
- that was wonderful to say again - would ever warm up to Wade who was hellbent on staying with Peter for the rest of their lives and who had unknowingly to them, moved into Stark Mansion. When they found out, however, it was too late and Wade had grown on them, well on Tony.
“It's an honor to meet you. I'm a big fan.” Wade gushed but Peter wasn’t sure sucking up was the best way to start this. Wade had his hand held out for a handshake, but Tony stayed seated looking from his scarred hand back to his scarred face.
“Hela tells me your mother and father both, decided together.”
Tony smiled down at the text as he got out of his car. Lunch with Steve would be nice, but he was currently crossing the parking lot to enter the doctor’s office. It was only two days after Harley’s wedding, June 12, and though it had brought more drama to his life, Tony discovered he’d neglected reminders for a doctor’s appointment he made weeks in advance. Weeks ago, when he was still with Stephen. He would have cancelled had he recalled for he no longer had the desire to find out if he had any eggs left at this age. He never wanted anymore kids and he only did it for Stephen.
“I know you don’t like me.” Harley understood that Torunn merely tolerated him. There were no romantic feelings there. “But I think if we got to spend more time together before the wedding.” That was drawing so close, less than three months away. “Then you might see that I’m not so bad, Princess.”
Sharon came in not long after and Tony took that moment to leave. He didn’t need to be breathing the same air as the person who was keeping his ex-husband’s dick warm at night. Tony excused himself giving Sharon the once over as she hugged his mother and was a foot out the door when Peggy called out to him.
Steve couldn't agree more. “Yeah very childish.”
“Better than da Vinci then?” Stephen mocked.
“So, does anyone else want to share anything else?” Steve asked staring pointedly at Morgan, who began talking when her eyes met his.
“You’re terrible, Rems. That’s some heavy blackmail material.” She was grinning.
“So please don’t mention this to my mother. I want it to be a surprise.” Anna continued. She stared at Torunn waiting to hear her response.
“Did he...?” He left his question unfinished. His mind was too pure for him to utter the words.
“Actually, I think it might be closer than that. Like family.” Carol insisted.
“I told you to stay away from her.”
Tony felt nauseous. He was still sleeping with Stephen by early May. He hadn’t been with Steve until mid-May. There was like a two-week difference there and Tony felt horrible for sleeping with Steve so soon after Stephen. He was disgusted with himself, sick to his stomach and he could feel his breakfast actually coming back up.
“Look.” Steve began, interrupting anything else Morgan may had hoped to add. “We have some news.” He paused. “Your mother’s pregnant.” Silence returned to the air.
she thought.
“Really well. Already healing nicely.” The woman responded. She let Peggy take a look at her notes. She was pleased with them. Then she introduced Tony who was busying himself by observing the machines in the room.
“Really?” Tony asked. He let out a hard laugh, turning his back to them. Hoping to calm himself down. “Are you going to tell me you two were drunk or something?”
Tony looked away. He felt guilty for hurting him. He knew Steve had felt like they were on the verge of rekindling their relationship, but Stephen was still in the picture and he still had feelings for him. He was happy with Stephen. Really. He sighed, whispering his name. “Steve –” He was interrupted.
Steve responded instantly.
Tony tried to push his disappointment aside and went to take Morgan from Steve’s arms. Her face was red and puffy at this point. He kissed her forehead. “Honey, what I’m saying is that I’m too young to be a grandparent.” He was
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve volunteered for he no longer wished to be that poor sickly, scrawny kid from Brooklyn that was always bullied. For years he did what he was told; a puppet on strings doing what was asked of him by Peggy and everyone else in the program. He resented Peggy most of all in the end; she took advantage of him. He felt like a joke until he met Howard’s only son, Tony and the realization hit him. Steve didn’t want be Peggy’s monkey being parade around anymore. He wanted to be with Tony, so he did just that. Tony had gotten pregnant quickly and they settled down.
“I promise you this one is yours.” He teased, trying to lighten the mood and although he made a joke of it, he really did hope they were getting their daughter back.
Steve found himself playing with his fingers awkwardly as Tony circled his living room some more before settling down on his sofa. He noticed the baby book Steve was reading prior to him arriving. Tony patted the spot beside him and Steve all too willing obliged, moving to sit with him.
“Good?” Sam asked, hearing a moan pass Bucky’s lips with his eyes still closed. It was clear he was enjoying this, and it made Sam chuckle.
“Don’t be mean, Nertha.” Hela scolded her. She rolled her eyes. “Torunn is the best thing Thor has ever done. She will be Queen.” She had promised Thor that she would make sure of it. A woman could rule. A woman would rule. She placed a gentle finger under her niece’s chin, tilting it up so their eyes met. They shared a smile.
Steve was staring at him. He had gotten out of bed minutes ago so he could finally get things done but Tony could feel his favourite pair of blue eyes raking over his naked form because Steve was staring at him.
“I love you too.”
“Very good.” Was his response, before a hand journeyed up to his inner thighs that were barely concealed by his robe. From where Sam sat, he could see just how
“You’re the damn doctor, Strange! Do something!” Steve shouted.
“Why are you even in New York?” he took his hand back from Wade.
They pulled out of Carmelita’s driveway and Wade asked Ellie what she wanted to do today.
Now he had to find the rat that was Justin Hammer.
“The day before Hammer died, she asked me if Aunt Nat and I ever snuck into SHIELD liked we planned to –” Morgan was interrupted.
“I wanted to see my son. I’m allowed to see my son,” Tony’s voice raised a few octaves at the last sentence, catching himself when Nicky stirred in his arms. He was admiring him. He was admiring what he and Steve had made. “He’s so beautiful…You did so good.”
At this point, Loki had already greeted everyone and was taking an empty seat at the dining table. Maria helped him prepare a plate. “Oh, thank you Maria. And I must say you look as radiant as ever.” He commented.
Tony’s legs wrapped around his waist and his arms around Steve’s neck.
“So, your Mom and I got you something…” Steve explained, leading her to the elevator to get to the floor above.
“They have been keeping all that information private and away from us.” Peter reminded them. “She’s probably scared.” He empathized.
want to do?” Steve countered. The decision had to be his.
. “Than I. Sooner than I think...” he corrected, because Tony must have thought, he meant we – as in he and himself.
Tony focused on his breakfast though. Eating one of Steve’s homemade and from scratch, pancakes. He sighed with delight. Oh, how he missed Steve’s cooking.
And Steve gave Strange one hard punch in the face that sent him flying through the glass doors behind him which led to the balcony and landed on one of the buffet tables and essentially disrupting the party. All eyes were on him as he stood up and realized the entire room of Avengers were only a second away from attacking him if needs be.
Thank you for reading! Reviews, Comments and Kudos are always welcome! 💛✨💙✨❤✨
“Very.” Morgan snarked, smirking at Harley. She couldn’t even be mad at her brother and one of her best friends. She just wished one of them would have mentioned it before it got out in the open like this.
“He wasn’t there for Steve, I mean Mr. Rogers. He even tried more than once to kill Steve.”
“You just have an answer for everything, don’t you?” Morgan spat and Anna’s face harden like porcelain before she made after her again and Steve yanked her back, once more.
“How about you Michelle?” Lila wondered.
“He was unfaithful to me during our marriage. Nicholas Rogers was actually conceived during our marriage.”
They pulled apart and Morgan was there to hug him next. “Morning mom,” she began. He was just missing one kid; Harley, who was following in his footsteps, off at MIT and studying engineering.
“It’s not necessary. We don’t need a piece of paper to show our love. We don’t need society telling us how to live.”
“I was about to say I haven’t had any symptoms,” He chuckled to lighten the mood – his mood, really. “But there goes that...”
Rhodey had finally gotten around to sharing his recent sex-capades with Tony by the end of August. Had it been about 20 years ago, Tony would be laughing with him about being in a polygamous relationship. Now he thought it was so out of character for Rhodey and anyone getting closer to 50.
“I had a conversation with Remy.” She began after swallowing a fork-full of her own salad. “It made me realize he’s not as bad as I thought him to be.” Pepper provided. “He really isn’t such a bad guy.”
“Ah-ah. No. I don't want to hear it. I moved out so I could avoid lectures like this,” Harley rebutted as he grabbed a soda from his mini fridge.
“You think so?” Torunn questioned. “I’m starting to think this was mother’s idea.”
“But it works Tony. It works. And now I understand why you were sleeping around so much when you were younger.” Rhodey carried on, trying to justify it all. Tony was only half-listening when a buzzing sound caught his attention.
Tony brought Peter, Morgan and Harley along to Peggy’s funeral. Maria Stark’s attendance was a given. Despite the kids’ state of limbo with their father, they knew Steve would be in attendance and they wanted to be there for him. Family always came first, come what may. Peggy’s family – her children and grandchildren sat up front; Maria joined them. Steve was in the second row of seats and Sharon stayed glued to his side. Tony however, sat closer to the back with Harley, Morgan and Peter, as far away as possible.
“Hi. You’re daddy’s boyfriend.” She stated, slipping her hand out of Wade’s and into Peter’s. “You’re so pretty.”
“What’s going on?” Stephen advanced towards him, leaning on a nearby wall as he finished with his shoes. It was clear he was heading out and Stephen was curious after Tony had been home and mostly in bed for the last 48 hours.
“We can’t be. Not now or ever. I can only be a father to our daughter.” He started to walk away, mumbling a ‘sorry’ as he did.
Tony rolled his eyes as she stepped down from the podium. Her bump was far more noticeable than the last time he’d seen her which was to be expected. That was 5 months ago. He’d managed to not encounter Sharon Carter for five whole months, and he was proud of that. Tony smiled to himself.
with my son.” He started and Wade’s smile disappeared. “And no, I don’t have to
Stephen had access to his home. He could come and go as he pleased so it wasn’t a surprise that he was exiting the elevator now onto the 3
Jacob didn’t miss a beat in his response. “Are you going to tell me you guys fell out of love?” He’d heard that cliché line before. He watched one too many rom-coms with Amelia. It was the same thing in every movie; just different characters.
“No. They’re just co-parenting.”
Tony tried not to tear up or allow his emotions to get the best of him. “Believe me, we’re so happy to have you back.” Then they sat, facing each other.
“You’ll always be my baby.” Tony squeezed his son again. “Enjoy my love. You’ll miss it when I’m gone one day.”
(See the end of the chapter for
His words put Tony in a state of serenity. He could feel Steve kissing his forehead and it made his heart flutter. He was always a sucker for forehead kisses and Steve knew it. He wished he never messed up. He wanted Tony back. He missed what they had. Steve didn’t know if that could ever happen in this lifetime but one thing, he knew for sure was he’d always love Tony whether it be this life or the next. But for right now, when he couldn’t have him, he’d just be there for him. He’d be his support system; he’d care for him while they cared for Morgan.
“Well, I’d been watching Peter…” Wade started. Tony’s eyes widened. Peter wanted to curl up into a ball and die. Wade wasn’t helping at all. Did he know how to lie?
Morgan raised an eyebrow while she used a hand to support her tilted head. She was unimpressed. Harley said the meeting was urgent and she left setting up her house with Nathan to be here. She didn’t know setting up would be taking her weeks to do and she wanted to get back to it. “She’s our long-lost sister.” She began. “How much could we possibly know?” Morgan sassed. Harley and Peter could both see how cranky she was today.
“Where are you going?” Tony questioned, watching the father of his children get out of bed and journey to their en suite.
“All I’m saying is I would never do that to you Tony. I love you.” They’d been dating for little over 3 months and it was the first time he’d said it. Was it too soon? He was looking at him expectantly. He didn’t want to be pressured into saying it if he didn’t feel it. He didn’t think he could ever love again. Not since Steve took that love and stumped all over it.
“You’re not still telling people we dated, right?” Tony carried on. Tony had given Hammer a chance after his non-stop harassment and it took less than half a date for Tony to realize he didn’t want anything to do with him, romantically or otherwise. A couple months later and he had met Steve and Justin couldn’t stand seeing them together. He tried to win him over. That didn’t work and so he aimed to destroy Stark Industries instead. They’d fought only once before this and Tony spared his life allowing him to be held in prison. He’d served his time. He’d been released recently, and Justin was claiming to be a better, changed man. Clearly those words held no weight. Tony wouldn’t hesitate to kill him this time around if it came to that.
“Mom. Hey. I just sent you the model,” came Harley’s voice as his face appeared on a holographic monitor in Tony’s lab. It was clear he was using his phone to project an equally similar monitor before himself in his dorm room. “Took me a few days but I finally figured it out.”
After Steve got patched up again, the doctor informed him that everything was perfectly fine. He was good and Nicky was good. They could go home in three days’ time, as per regular hospital procedures. Sam and Bucky stayed by his side as much as they could. Pepper and Morgan came by and even members of the team did too. Everyone loved Nicky, with his baby blue eyes, and little patch of blonde hair and that new baby scent. He was a mini-Steve, Sam’s new name for Nicky.
“It was hard getting her to sleep and then she woke in the middle of the night crying and it woke Harley.” He finished.
“You okay, Mom?” Peter spoke again and each time, it brought Tony out of the mood and each time, Steve thrust into him and brought him back.
Jacob’s eyes widened at the mention of Nertha. “I am not sleeping with the daughter of the Goddess of Death. I value my life. And I love Amelia.”
“I’ve already decided.”
“Why were you sneaking into SHIELD?” Harley rose an eyebrow, concern etched on his face.
“You’ll never find your daughter if you do.” Justin murmured.
Tony stared at them for a moment, playing back everything in his head. This wasn’t going to work. What type of parent would he be if he let Peter continue with this? He’s just a kid.
About 4 weeks later, Steve and Tony had gathered their children. Steve was ecstatic. They’d created a life together from their love and neither of them wanted to hide anymore once Tony had finally entered his second trimester. He was also starting to show a bit. If he wore tight-fitted clothes, anyone could definitely spot the outline of a small baby bump. So, they wanted their children to be the first to know, after telling Maria Stark she would be having another grandchild soon.
“I was only doing what I thought was best.” Nertha spat back. She didn’t know a marriage would come from it.
Minutes later and Stephen was walking out onto the back lawn and towards the group of tents. Tony blushed at the sight of him. He even had a gift in hand. Once he got closer to Tony, he put his gift on a nearby table and enveloped Tony in a hug, capturing his lips with his own in the process. No hello? Okay. Fine. He didn’t mind being greeted like this.
Wade:
“And you didn’t kill Hammer, right?”
“Good night,” Tony whispered. He took himself to Morgan’s room next. Her door was unlocked, and Tony scanned the room but saw no sign of her until he noticed the door of her en suite bathroom was closed. Morgan had looked a bit sickly at dinner.
Minutes later he was called into Dr McIntosh’s office. Kayla McIntosh was a long-time friend at this point. They first met when Tony was carrying Harley and though he only had three pregnancies, a friendship and mutual respect grew from that and they spent plenty of time together as any pair of friends would. She was now rising from her chair to hug Tony. She looked the same, since the last time he’d seen her – still brunette and short – well a few inches shorter than Tony at least.
Steve almost walked in on Tony on the phone. He’d been staying at the Stark Mansion in a guestroom of course since that god-foresaken night. He had to be there for his daughter. Tony questioned him about it one day. Didn’t he have a pregnant girlfriend he needed to be with? Steve told Tony, he hadn’t plan this. He didn’t want a kid with Sharon so the further he got away from her the better. But of course, Tony scolded him for it. He couldn’t just neglect his responsibility like that. Regardless of how he felt about Sharon, there was baby involved now. He needed to put the kid first. Steve knew he had to
Sam watched as he hovered over his erection for a second, lining up his hole with it. Bucky sat down slowly feeling himself being impaled by his cock. Sam held his hips to keep him in place, savouring the warmth around him as his husband rode him to completion.
“Your new place?” Steve asked. Morgan nodded. “You need help with anything you let me know.” Tony would be there too if she needed help. The only thing he’d want to change if he could, was the fact that Morgan wasn’t going to college. She was going to start as the new COO of Stark Industries very soon as far as he knew, and then eventually co-CEO. That was pretty good for just being 19 years old and Tony wouldn’t let anyone call it nepotism. S.I. was simply her birth right and she was more than capable of running it.
William was the 1-year-old baby boy Wanda and Vision adopted. William Maximoff. Wanda and Vision had not envisioned parenthood to be so challenging, but the dark-haired, fair-skinned, blue-eyed baby had made it quite entertaining. It was a joy to raise him and William especially enjoyed being levitated and floating in the air by the use of Wanda’s or Vision’s powers.
Right now, her hands were glowing and Rhodey could hear and see her and Sif shouting at each other from where he stood but he wasn’t able to make out the words. Jacob and Amelia noticed the ruckus too.
I got the idea for this story as early as September 2018. I remember pitching it to a writer and they never used it. Fast forward, May 2019, after months of planning it out in my head, I said "fuck it, I'll write it myself. I've written original stories before. I can write some fanfic, no biggie!"
got me pregnant.”
“Sounds like you know everything then.”
“We should have saw this coming.” Carol told her. “She spends so much time with Steve. We never see her with anyone else.”
“Oh, I just kept running my hands through it,” he lied too easily and tried smoothing it down afterwards. He changed the subject quickly. “And Tony was just here making martinis before he headed to his room,” Steve gesture to the glasses still at the bar to validate his story.
“Seventeen,” Lila assured him kissing his cheek.
Sam knew he was at fault. Bucky was good to him. Never gave him a reason to doubt before. The one time he had asked about Winter’s paternity, Bucky had answered him truthfully. It should have been enough; his husband’s words should have been enough. He let his paranoia get to him and he did something that hurt the man he loved, the man who gave him a child. Something they both wanted for so long. He should have trusted Bucky.
Something, anything that might appeal to his sense of humanity because this is an innocent baby; a brand new life. How can he ask him to get rid of the baby they made TOGETHER out of love. “I – I –” he stammers and Tony is watching him carefully, awaiting his rebuttal. “I can’t afford that. I’m 4 months.” Tony isn’t wavering; not even for a second. His mind is clearly made up and nothing’s going to change that. Steve isn’t supposed to be pregnant. This wasn’t the plan. “It’s a boy…” Steve finishes. They were having a boy.
he thought. “It’s okay.”
“I know and I was wrong. I was wrong for sleeping with her, leading her on, letting her think we were in a relationship and getting angry at her for getting pregnant when we were sleeping together.” Steve ignored the fact that Sharon hadn’t even been carrying his child because he was lacking that information at the time.
Peter waited for his response. “That’s good.” Wade chimed in.
At Harley’s 21st birthday celebration on Asgard, Thor finally addressed the issue of Torunn wanting to give up her crown. He wouldn’t have it. Sif agreed with her husband and Nertha was all for it if anyone asked her opinion. It would make her
✨❤✨💙✨💛
“Tony. You’re rambling.” Pepper stopped him. “We’re doing this project together like every other project. Your kids are 16, 17 and 19. Your baby-days are long gone and you have Steve and me and everyone else. We’re always here to help.”
That was probably Peter’s 10
Sam’s eyes wandered back over to Bucky who was still among the group of mutants and Wakandians. Bucky smiled and waved at him when their eyes met. Sam beckoned him with his eyes and Bucky excused himself from the group.
“No blindfold this time,” Tony explained. Steve parted his lips to speak but Tony put a finger to his lips to silence him.
Tony threw up for the second time that morning. He flushed the toilet, washed his hands and brushed his teeth before he was left staring at his reflection in the mirrors of his en suite. He wondered why Steve hadn’t woken up yet and more importantly, why Steve hadn’t realized he was pregnant yet. He was way past the 7-week mark at which he’d normally figure it out. Tony wondered if it was because he was pregnant with Stephen’s child.
Steve was miserable. He’d lost Tony. Since Christmas, his life had been a complete mess. He stopped caring about a lot of things. He stopped doing a lot of things. He couldn’t eat. He couldn’t sleep. Only sketching and painting helped. He was just living – being – day after day, and anyone could see that Steve Rogers was depressed. He knew his children and his friends were probably thinking how ridiculous his reaction was, but he lost the love of his life. He couldn't help how he was reacting
Harley was in complete awe of everything about Asgard. It really was a stunning place, that shimmered in gold when the rays of light hit it just right. Loki was the first member of the royal family waiting on the steps of the palace to greet Torunn and Harley. Torunn greeted her Aunt and cousin next. Loki hugged Harley, Hela said a brief hello and Nertha smirked at him. Harley sucked on one of his teeth to keep from saying anything degrading before the King and Queen. Nertha was now one of his least favourite persons in the world but maybe he should thank her for what she’d done. He probably would have never turned his life around had she not subjected him to mind control.
He got home by catching a cab. Apparently, he had left his car still parked at the bar. He’d have to figure out a way to get it later. He rode the elevator of his and Tony’s home until he got to the main floor. The whole time he was running his hands through his hair trying to figure out or comprehend what could have caused him and Nat to do what they did. They didn’t like each other like that, and they weren’t drunk so maybe they just got caught up in a horrible moment and…it just happened? He couldn’t tell Tony that. He just couldn’t. He didn’t need to know when it meant nothing. It didn’t matter.
“Stephen. We’re old. I turned 45 in May, remember? We’d be crazy to have kids at our age. I don’t even know if I can still get pregnant.”
“You too…” He was trying to remember his name.
“Do that again,” he begged. Peter groaned in frustration and walked away from him.
Bucky instinctively ran his fingers through her curls with his other hand as she only had a headband holding back her mane. It always surprised him, at how much hair she had. Sam, on the other hand, wasn’t. He would just point at Bucky who hadn’t had a proper hair cut in months and was currently sporting armpit-length hair. Sam loved it though. He loved to yank at it during sex.
They talked some more until Steve’s phone went off. A few texts from Sharon but he didn’t waste his time reading them. He didn’t want to deal with her right now. It was at least 10 minutes later when his phone rang. It was Sharon. He answered, no sympathy in his voice.
“I turn 18 in less than 2 months Morgan.” She reminded her with so much impudence, Morgan was surprised to hear her next words be so entreating. “So please don’t tell Mom and Dad.” She begged. Morgan was starting to realize how two-faced her
. You’re pregnant and since when do u officiate weddings?” Tony said, completely astonished.
Now he felt guilty for not realizing sooner. He never wanted his daughter to have to “come out”. It should have been as obvious as heterosexual relationships. It shouldn’t have been hidden.
“Nope. I told you I’d see you around” and he started drumming his fingers against the concrete. “Your turn, Webs. How’d you know my name?”
“Stephen!” He screamed. Stephen’s eyes fixed on him as if he was trying to communicate but all Tony got was Stephen foaming at the mouth. “Friday! I need an ambulance.” He was panicking.
“By lying to your other kids.” Harley added, making his presence known from the left of the group.
“Did you just assume our daughter’s sexuality?” He laughed.
A pink flame appeared in the palm of her right hand. Morgan grinned at her. “I’d say it’s going pretty good.”
“That’s good to hear.” Sif responded, before her mind wondered off to other things. “Do you think it will be a good ceremony?” She kept her eyes on the people at work below her. “This will be the first wedding in Asgard’s history that welcomes outsiders.”
Nathan completely forgot the bottle of water he was going for initially when he got downstairs. He saw Morgan’s black cat, Binx before anything else when he reached his room. Or rather his and Morgan’s as they liked to tell everyone. Binx was their baby. The kitten had helped them both heal when they lost their actual baby.
“She said that even though the Winter Soldier Serum is completely out of my system, I don’t have that many eggs left. And being in my 40s, chances aren’t that high anymore.” Bucky informed him. He paused, looking away as his eyes saddened. Steve knew he really wanted another baby. He always talked about wanting plenty of kids if he ever got the chance.
She and Nathan were in his bed some time later cuddling and going through his photo albums together. They looked at his baby pictures, kid pictures, family pictures over the years. Family pictures with his mother’s side of the family; family pictures with Nat’s side of the family too. Nathan pointed everyone out as they went along. Morgan knew most of Nathan’s immediate family – the Rosses but there were also a few faces she didn’t recognize. Nathan didn’t hesitate to fill her in.
“We talked about having a baby.” Stephen inched closer. “We were trying for a baby.” A step closer. “That was only a few weeks ago, Tony.” And then they were inches away from each other’s face. “We were happy. We were so happy.”
“And to think I asked Payton,” Her assistant. “To send out so many reminders because I knew you would forget, and you still did.” Tony gave her an apologetic smile.
Anna grinned at Peter. “Mhm…I don’t know. Would be pretty cool though.” And she resumed her eating. Maria had cooked with the help of some staff and it wasn’t a surprise that the food was delicious.
“You were watching me?”
A blissful moan escaped from Tony and he could feel himself getting aroused. Steve’s hands then settled on his waist and Tony breathed his name. He wanted Steve to touch him more. He wanted Steve’s fingers to touch his skin – his bare skin.
Laura had to agree. “Lila took such a long time to get over Harley.” She added, remembering her daughter’s fit after last year’s Christmas party.
“Right. It’s none of
Amelia butt in. “Please don’t answer that if you’ve been with Calvin. I don’t want to picture that.”
Further notice meant a couple years at Carter’s and Tony would be a free man again. There he was, getting away with everything again. Steve would rather see him rot in jail or hell for all his crimes and sins but the time in the mental health facility would just have to do. And as much as he hated it all, at least Morgan and Nicky got to see their father from time to time.
His joy turned to ash in his mouth and was replaced by a sadness, some regret, hurt and...and pain. There was a pain in his side. A pain in his chest. No. A pain below. A sharp pain right below his heart.
“So…” Kayla started, “You’re just a little over 9 weeks.” She looked over at the pair. “Not 11 weeks. I am so sorry. I made a mistake. Conception would be mid-May.” She finished.
“Well, since we are airing things out. Anymore secrets we should know about?” Peter put in, not affected as much by the revelation as his siblings but had his fair share of revelations in the past from lies his parents had told him.
Loki was genuinely appalled. His eyes widened at the news. “Oh dear.” He began. “I never would have guessed Natasha could do such a thing.”
“What? Why? I’m not a creep.” Wade said, comically offended.
Peter was stunned. He stopped opening the smaller box and stared at Wade completely frozen until he repeated himself.
“Can I take you on a date?” Jacob asked again.
“Hey Ellie-Bellie.” Wade greeted her, taking one of her hands into his. She adjusted her backpack a little with the other.
“Why do you always do that?” Tony continued, touching his arm so he’d finally look at him.
“Yeah. I can appreciate beauty.”
“She was never like this.” Steve glanced at Bucky and then Sam before carrying on again. “I told her it was just gonna be sex but I think she wants it to be more than that.”
Morgan managed a laugh between her tears. Her mom always knew how to lighten the mood. “I’m sorry mommy.” She’d take it back if she could. “I’m so sorry.”
birthday, Harley only had one; the one Tony planned.
Wanda valued any advice these women could offer. She was still young at 25 and new to motherhood. They were far more experienced in that department than she ever could be after merely two months of caring for William. She thought of her son who was with his father today. She missed him and wondered how they were both doing.
Forgive my errors. And only a few chapters left ✨✨✨
“Papa? Daddy?” Winter entered the room and Sam quickly removed the hand that was between Bucky’s thighs.
Thor and Bruce were off by the Christmas tree, drink in their hands. He had only a moment ago announced that he and Sif were having another child. Asgard would gain a Prince from their King and Queen and to say Thor was excited was an understatement. He loved his first born. He loved his daughter more than he had ever loved anyone but the joy that came with having a son for a man was undeniable. And while deep in his thoughts, spotted his wife and daughter across the room. Valkyrie was close by. Thor knew he was the luckiest man alive.
and she didn't want to be stuck in a loveless marriage forever. Her face showed pure embarrassment as she realized that her Uncle, the God of Mischief had just baited her into a confession. Torunn groaned. “Fine!” dropping the façade. “I just always figured,” her Asgardian accent slipped. “I would be able to date my future husband before we wed.”
He stared, dumbfoundedly at his son. He could have asked Karen or Friday for that. “Really?”
“Oh Steve. I’m so sorry.” Bucky sympathized, glancing at him and back at the road several times. “You’re going to be okay though.”
“I do not!” she shot back. She glared at Amelia for a second before she caught on. She wanted her to mention the suitors then. “Father is having me meet potential suitors upon my next visit.”
“Yeah. I’m okay, mom.”
I know there are errors somewhere.
“Absolutely not!” Tony shouted. “You’re 16 Peter!” He paused. “Is he forcing you?” He said the last part in a whisper.
Nat tried again but Tony had had enough of their apologies and lies. He couldn’t deal with it anymore. “Get the hell out!” he shouted because being kind wasn’t getting him anywhere. “Both of you!” And Steve got up, whispering how sorry he was.
He got replies from both his texts.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then why’d you cheat on me repeatedly?” Tony smacked his hand away. He looked ashamed of himself. Tony would never let this go.
Steve nodded to let him know he was listening. Harley's father was a 18 year old guy named John, 10 years younger than Tony's 28 years at the time. They only dated for 6 months before he got pregnant.
Anna was satisfied as she nodded and decided to change the topic. Anything besides talk of their mother was more welcoming. “Did you ever visit SHIELD with Aunt Nat?” Morgan had mentioned the planned outing, but it never came to fruition.
Everyone left except Pepper, Carol and Rhodey. They sighed because just like that the wound had been reopened and they'd have to pick up the pieces like they did 17 years ago.
Don’t know why he’d say that though. I think it’s wonderful that you guys got back together. You guys have three babies together. It will be good for them, having their parents under the same roof again.” She went on and Tony smiled sadly.
“Funny you should ask.” Someone said. Tony knew that voice. The person joined them at the wedding arch, sporting a very large baby bump. Tony wasn’t expecting that from him. “Yours truly of course.”
“And I assume he does too.” Sif responded.
Soon her husband joined her on the balcony. “It looks good.” Thor commented, standing by her with an arm around her waist.
Steve watched Tony wipe his nose. “I feel like a part of me knew that while another part kept reminding me, you’d cheated before and…” Tony sniffled. “…once a cheater, always a cheater.” Steve nodded. He believed that too. He couldn’t blame Tony for thinking he’d cheated again. He only wished to clear things up.
. So, they knew how to kill. They knew how to execute their plans; they knew how to get away with it and they knew
“Really. He’s a bit older so it would never work.”
“Fury is working the investigation.” Tony went on. Steve didn’t see the need for such nor did he understand Tony’s fascination with it but he let Tony continue talking. “He has reason to believe Hammer was working with someone else besides Sharon and that person might just be his killer.”
Tony decided it was time to change the subject. “The doctors say you were poisoned.” Stephen hummed. “They say it couldn’t have been ingested more than an hour before.” Stephen’s eyes were surveying his surroundings – he was in a hospital. “Was there anyone suspicious at the bar?” Tony asked, turning Stephen’s face so he would only look at him.
He saw his sister take a deep breath. “Better. Better than before…” she trailed off and Harley knew she was probably flashing back to the incident.
Amelia initiated the conversation regarding Pietro, and Cassie spared no details about her dates and the coitus that followed on multiple occasions. Lila was the most raved up by descriptions asking, “Did he use his powers?”
Steve found Tony sleeping in the living room on one of the sofas. Morgan was curled up on top of him with a blanket draped over them and Harley was sprawled out on another sofa sound asleep.
They had become good friends long before their kids started dating and often made lunch dates so they could hang out more given their busy lives. Carol hadn’t let avenging go so easily though. There were so many other planets out there that still needed help. She was constantly going back and forth from planet to planet. It put a little strain on her relationship with Rhodey but she had to remind him, that she had this amazing power and it would be selfish of her not to use it to help others.
Pepper hadn’t been seeing him at all. She came by to see Steve as she always did with Morgan and she let him know that Tony had gone missing for a while now. No one could find him.
“How old are you again?” Harley wondered after a moment.
Anna had only nodded. She wanted that so much. It was all she ever wanted.
Steve drew closer to his family, clasping his hands together as he looked down at his tapping feet, hoping to build up enough courage to speak. “When I was 16,” he started, staring at Harley then Morgan then Peter, who were all waiting for him to proceed. Then at Tony, who was encouraging him with his eyes. “I was raped.” Steve let the words hang in the room for a minute; letting the kids process it.
“I could take him.” Tony teased before he was knocked down by a blast. He could hear Rhodey, agreeing with him sarcastically before he too was knocked down.
Once showered and fully clothed, he raised his shirt to admire his growing bump in one of their full length mirrors. He pressed slightly where his son's foot was resting against his skin and he felt him shift around. Tony smiled, tracing his faint stretch marks when Friday informed him it was time to meet Steve in the backyard.
Tony had completely forgotten about his date tonight with Stephen. Work was hectic these days. He and Pepper’s latest project was being launched next month so he was forever buried in his work. And he was also trying to plan a surprise party for Morgan’s 18
“No. They’re not.” So much of his body had changed following his pregnancies - his breasts, his belly, his thighs. They were never the same, but Steve loved to tell him how much he loved them all.
Finally, he answered. “Then whose is it?” His eyes sparkled, daring him to humour him.
Steve rose from his seat, getting equally agitated. “What is it?”
“Hi, Aunt Peggy.” He came back into the room, rushing to her side, cupping her small hand in both of his. She used the other to caress his face.
Lila narrowly missed the pillow, laughing as she did. “Did I lie though?”
“Steve sketched a million and one portraits of me during all 3 of my pregnancies. And took too many pics. Want me to go get a photo album?” Tony asked, poking fun at him.
Steve asked for an ultrasound picture as he did upon every doctor visit. He liked to keep the progress of his baby’s growth in a scrapbook because other mothers in his pregnant mothers group did. He also thought it was cute idea and he’d loved to show the baby one day when he’s all grown up. His pregnant mothers group was a relief most of the time. The other mothers didn’t judge, being a pregnant man and all. Everyone was welcoming. Most of them had children already and it gave Steve a sense of comfort knowing all these women had done it before and done so well. So well, that they were having more kids and Steve would like that one day; more kids. He just had to focus on little SJ for now. Steve Junior – the name was Sam’s idea. He hadn’t thought about names yet.
“Maybe they forgot,” Harley suggested. He was distracted. Jacob couldn’t tell.
Peter turned a little red in the face. “Thank you, Ellie. You’re so pretty too.”
T’challa didn’t seem the least bit bothered by his tone. It was a good question. “I am visiting for business and your wonderful husband has allowed me to stop by for a meal and conversation.”
“Why?”
They came together, Wade deep inside him and Peter between their naked torso as Wade edged him on with a helping hand. When Wade tried to pull out, Peter wouldn’t let him. He wanted to stay like this, joined for as long as possible and who was Wade to object. Being inside Peter was nothing he could have ever imagined, and he started to hate himself for waiting this long.
Steve decided he wouldn’t let Strange spoil his mood. He’d just grab something to eat, see Peter and see how Morgan was doing then leave. He didn’t need any problems. But he was also a bit irritated. Following Morgan’s mishap, those weeks ago in which he and Tony had had a moment, he really thought they were making progress considering how he left things with Strange. Wishful thinking, he supposed.
“It was gradual actually.” She said, gently. “And only just for mom.” She emphasized. She glanced to Tony, as her siblings and Tony nodded for confirmation.
“Yes, you can babe.” Steve gave a harder thrust, and bit Tony’s left ear while the bed banged the wall a final time. Tony screamed out, another orgasm rocking through him. His orgasm spurred Steve’s, his hole clenching around his member, forcing him to let go inside Tony. They kissed as Steve stifled the moans that tried to leave his mouth. He collapsed on Tony, their foreheads touching and both breathing heavily.
Steve, on the other hand, would not falter from the things he’d said before. He wasn’t happy about the situation and he never would be.
Two days later Peter celebrated his 17
When Harley pulled his fingers out, she winced as he started to properly undress. He was completely naked when Torunn gathered herself. She bit her lip at the sight of him and without a second thought, she took control again, flipping him over. She hovered, using his shoulders for support while she sunk down slowly onto his erection and tore her hymen in the process. Torunn cried out in pain. Harley could see a hint of blood on his cock when he looked down at where their bodies joined.
In all this, Wade hadn’t budged, not even an inch and after some time Peter, unconsciously pressed himself back into the hug, closing his eyes and welcoming the embrace.
Honestly, Wade just needed Peter to be 18. He couldn't bring himself to do it before that but somehow, kissing was okay? While Peter just wanted to do it for the first time and move on.
The coronation took place later that evening and Harley had to admit he enjoyed his time there. Asgardians really knew how to throw a party. After the celebrations everyone but Torunn and Harley retreated to their rooms for the night. She had to take him to her favourite spot in the palace. It was also the most delightful view.
Bucky took in the sight of Steve. He had a large bandage around his neck. He would be able to take that off soon. He had dark circles under his eyes. He hadn’t slept well in days. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Tony standing over him, choking him. He was losing his mind because Tony was haunting him. His skin was pale. His lips were dry and cracked. He was scared shitless. Bucky and Sam knew it. So they couldn’t…they couldn’t let Steve stay in his apartment by himself. His mind would play trick on him, putting him and SJ in danger or Tony might show up again and try to finish the job. They couldn’t let him be alone. And Bucky hated himself for not being there sooner. Because yes, Steve had survived this, but he wish he could have prevented it in the first place. If only he had drove a little faster or walked a little quicker to Steve’s apartment that night, they wouldn’t be in this situation.
“Just wanted to say you look great.” Jacob stated innocently.
. They ended up in his room and Peter made certain the door was locked before jumping into Wade’s arms. Their mouths joined in a heated kiss and Wade sat on the edge of the bed with Peter straddling him.
“She’s still a kid.” Steve justified. What was he supposed to do if he saw his little girl hurting like that?
Steve whispers a no. He’d never joke about a baby. “I didn’t even know you could get pregnant…” Tony sighs, running a hand through his hair in frustration. He has the other hand on his hip and he turns away from Steve to think.
“You’re right. Congratulations.” He tried to sound sincere, but Tony wasn’t fooled. He also decided that he didn’t care much as he joined the checkout line, but Stephen was still close by. “How far along are you?” He questioned.
Harley was stuffing his face, Morgan was chatting with Torunn and Peter was hanging out with Michelle. Harley was dressed in a white dress shirt and black dress pants to match. His sleeves were rolled up a bit and his first two buttons were undone. Morgan wore a simple red off-the shoulder-dress and Peter was in a suit. He wore his glasses tonight when he didn’t want to use his contact lens. Tony motioned them towards him and the trio left their friends at the snack table to meet Stephen.
She knew Peter was better off not discussing Wade so she carried on with the conversation as well. “Well…I didn’t say that. But Calvin is nice and it’s only fair I give the person that actually likes me a chance.” Peter thought of Wade. He thought Wade liked him; wasn’t that why he was giving him a chance. He asked him to wait for him. He wished he could but how long should he wait for someone who disappeared without even saying goodbye.
I'll understand if you don't like this chapter. It wasn't my best work but thank you so much for reading! Reviews, Comments & Kudos are always welcome! 💛💙❤
“Nothing.” Peter lied, dropping the “W” and stuffed it into his shirt.
“No!” she countered, stepping out of the bathroom, her hair now in a ponytail. “This is me and Valkyrie hanging out. Being friends.” She paused, narrowing her eyes at him. “James, I can have friends.”
“I’m good, Mom. No more flashes.” Harley provided, truthfully. He felt like himself again and even better than before.
The message was from Stephen fucking Strange and Tony knew he had to respond or his lack of, would indicate a confirmation.
Natasha, Bruce and Bruce’s son Nathan made their way through the elevator and onto the 3
Morgan then dragged the Instagram tab so Torunn could see it. Torunn was pleasantly surprised. Pietro’s post was a shirtless mirror selfie, all chiselled abs and toned muscles on display.
The day he was to go home, Bucky couldn’t make it because of work so it was just he, Sam and Nicky that would be journeying home together. Sam had called, telling him he had to turn back home and get the car seat because of course he would forget that. Steve didn’t mind, part of him was dreading going back home. He had dozed off a little once he got Nicky to fall asleep following his breastfeeding and he planned to get dress soon so Sam wouldn’t have to wait.
“He’s claimed your innocence, Torunn.” His voice was firm and Torunn’s eyes grew large. It was embarrassing. Even more so when she heard gasps and murmurs behind her, coming from the table. “Something that was to be saved for your husband.” Thor continued, making her feel small.
Sam cut him off. “Never. Never again Buck.”
“Were you and Dad in the room when she did?” Harley questioned.
“Haven’t seen you in a while,” Natasha started. “Sharon keeping you locked up?” She and Steve had always been close. Almost as close as him and Bucky and Sam but as of late, they had been seeing less of each other and Steve knew he was to blame.
“I just don’t think I know how to date anymore.” Tony confessed.
“Divorces are expensive.” Nat settled with that for a response. She made herself think about that in more detail. People spent so much money to get divorces these days. Not that she and Bruce were struggling financially. After they retired from being Avengers, they realized they had to start earning money to sustain their living arrangements. They weren’t living at the Avengers compound for free anymore. Now Bruce was working as a full-time private doctor and she dabbled in her own line of work so they were pretty stable financially.
He left, sparing a glance at an angry Morgan, a shocked Peter and a sympathetic Tony. It was like nothing to him now.
“Hey.” Steve whispered, angling Tony’s face so he could see him. “You want me to get you another slice of cake?” Food always cheered Tony up. He nodded, pecking Steve’s lips. “I’ll be right back.”
“I love you too.” Tony responded. Steve had even gotten his mind off the night prior until Nat texted him. She wanted to talk.
Anna smiled at him shyly, a hint of embarrassment in her expression. “Yeah.” She confirmed.
“That’s good.” He remarked him. “I’m happy to know she’s feeling better. I –”
Sam greeted the pair. Clint pulled away from the bar with two drinks, one for himself and the other for Laura. He left Sam and Nat in pursuit of locating his wife while they chatted.
“And you didn’t want to bring a suit.” Rhodey remarked as his voice echoed in Tony’s helmet.
On Asgard, Thor had just finished listening to his people’s complaints. The throne room was empty currently except for Asgard’s royals. Thor sat on the throne and Sif was seated on his left while the seat on his right remained empty for Asgard’s crowned princess. Hela and Nertha stood close by.
“You think she’s lying?” Tony met her eyes on the screen. The cooking video paused each time he looked away.
“You know, Tony doesn’t need all this negativity around him.” Stephen explained.
“Torunn knows.” He informed him. He’d been nothing but an open book with her so of course she knew he still held on to some things from his life before her.
Thoughts? Comments?
Steve, Tony, Bruce and Nat were seated in the living room. They were completely in the dark about the need for such a gathering. Steve thought Morgan was inviting him over so they could discuss Sharon being pregnant, but he saw that wasn’t the case when he found Bruce and Nat waiting with Tony. Bruce and Nat couldn’t begin to imagine what this was about, and Tony was getting a little worried. Morgan didn’t even want to talk about the night before, when he mentioned it. He was starting to think this gathering and that little bathroom incident were linked somehow.
“You’re not your father, Tony and you never will be.” Steve reassured him staring into his eyes. He could see the sadness in them. “Our baby will be so lucky to have you as their father.”
Wanda nodded in agreement. “Does Fury suspect anyone?” she questioned.
“Husband.” She breathed.
Peter:
“We’re going to therapy.” Carol made a face.
Tony had gathered everyone in the living room so they could surprise Morgan and Steve had gone to retrieve her from her room.
Dinner was almost finished being prepared when Sam got home. Winter was upstairs in her room watching TV. Her homework for the day was completely with her Papa’s help and she was waiting to have dinner before doing anything else.
He managed to make it outside the room this time. His phone went off signaling a new message. It was Steve.
Amelia’s sleepover was actually Morgan’s idea. She wanted a chance for all her friends to hang out and catch up on things, so they picked a weekend in October and set it all up. It was a much-needed break from the pressure 4/6 of the girls were under which came with their final year in high school. College would be here quicker than they thought although Morgan had decided not to apply for such. Michelle was the other exception; she was only in her junior year with Peter, Ned and Calvin.
Pepper could feel the tension all around. She glanced at Carol and Rhodey before trying to get everyone’s attention. “I suppose we all should head home.” No one moved, still in shock that Nat and Steve could have ever been a thing, had a thing?
“I was going to tell you and Peter once we figured it out…I…” Steve was struggling to find the right words. He wanted to sort everything out with Sharon before he told them. He wasn’t aware Tony knew. Sharon must have said something.
When Wade did show up, Steve watched the man carefully as he handed Peter a gift after which Peter got on his toes to give him a proper hug. Steve saw him return the hug reluctantly. He didn’t know what he expected upon meeting Wade, but it most certainly was not this. Tony approached the couple first.
So, it turned out that Tony’s last-minute Mother’s Day Brunch was just a small gathering for “mothers”. He invited all the mothers he knew but unfortunately, some of their children and the fathers also tagged along. Tony wasn’t annoyed at first until fathers like Sam Wilson came along.
“She belongs to someone else.” Valkyrie explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve and Tony had had a talk. They decided it was time they had one of those family meetings and if Tony could recall correctly, he would have to pinpoint the last one to be about 5 years ago when he and Steve told their kids the divorce was going to happen. Steve agreed that this talk would give everyone the opportunity to say what was on their minds. Tony was hoping this would resolve the kids’ issues with their father. Harley and Peter were almost past Steve’s scandalous cheating revelation while Morgan on the other hand still held a personal vendetta against her father. It upset both Steve and Tony because why was Morgan of all their kids still loathing her father for what took place 17 years ago; when she was just a toddler.
Wade was going to leave but Peter’s sweet face crossed his mind and he remembered how torn up he was when he left and returned the last time. “I’m sorry Mr. Rogers.” Wade began and Steve believed for a second that he had gotten through to him. “But I can’t do that. I can’t abandon Peter again. I love him too much to let him ever hurt like that again.”
“The spider-ling, spider-child, spider-boy?” Tony snapped his fingers at every guess, when he swore, he got it right.
Tony excused himself from the conversation he was having with Bruce. Pepper had reminded him that it was getting closer to midnight. It was Christmas Eve and he liked to make his speeches at a quarter to midnight – 15 minutes before Christmas. As host he liked to welcome everyone collectively; most times with Pepper by his side. She opted out this time around, however and Tony decided not to question it.
“Prince Harley.” Morgan shouted, teasingly from behind Anna. Harley scoffed. “I hope you’re not expecting special treatment.”
“Yes Wade.” Peter remarked, rolling his eyes again. “I told you I was a virgin.” He knew this. Wade hummed, pretending to recall that being said on numerous occasions and finally letting out a laugh. Peter silenced him with a kiss. They’d figure it out together, eventually. There was no pressure or hurry. Slow was good for that type of thing and they both had to be ready for it.
“It’s just a hunch.” Peter provided, after listening quietly and Morgan shot daggers at her little brother.
“I thought she liked boys.”
Peter stared at him. He didn’t find that funny. Wade hadn’t cracked a smile either. He liked to make remarks like this and then laugh about them but not this time, apparently. “Then how’d you get Ellie?” He challenged.
- Features a slumber party, a family dinner and more revelations✨
“How –” He stuttered in confusion. “How far along am I?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve tried one more time to talk to Morgan, but she pulled away from her father and stood by her mother’s side. It didn’t seem she’d ever be on his side again. He’d lost his daughter and son and no doubt Harley too, once he found out. He hadn’t meant to say it. It just slipped out in the heat of his anger and frustration. But it seemed more hate was directed towards Nat than Steve.
“Hey Pep.” Tony sounded tired, like he hadn’t slept in a long time so maybe he was throwing himself into finishing the model for their project.
“But the kids – our kids – deserved to know. I know.” Steve finished and Tony was smiling at him. “Sorry about dinner.” Because he hadn’t apologized for that yet. “Good night Tony.” And there was way too much compassion in those words.
Next Chapter: Forgive Me
“We had a deal.” He reminded her. She paused for a second before resuming the task at hand. “I helped you with your baby situation. Time for you to pay up.”
“I don’t ever want to stop.” Peter moaned, already moving his hips again to start up a rhythm.
Morgan’s head shot up the moment Steve was standing directly over them. It was like she could feel whenever her dad was near. She called out for her father. Her voice and movements as Steve picked her up, woke Tony. Harley still slept peacefully.
“Dad?” Peter came around the corner. Tony pulled away from Steve and watched Peter hug him. “I’m so sorry.”
Maybe everyone was right. Look at them now. But in the moment, when you knew, you just knew.
Tonight, all three of them were at a bar, conversing, laughing, drinking way too much and having a good time. Not that alcohol had any impact on any of them. They were all immune to it.
The caramel–coloured-skin girl grinned, her dark curly hair in two little puffs as her father caught up with her, “How about you go play in your room with your dolls, while papa and daddy talk with Uncle Steve, okay?” as he brushed a little fuzz of her hair out of her face.
“What do we really know about Anna?”
Nertha joined the rest of the Asgardian royal family for dinner. Thor sat at the head of the table with Sif by his side. Her belly was hard to miss now, under her royal robes being 7 months along. Hela was across from her and Nertha sat next to her. Loki was missing per usual and more recently, Valkyrie.
Thank You!
He should have known that. Who would defy him? “What does it matter now? You’re happy with him, right?”
That got Steve Rogers mad.
“Was she identical to Peter?” Morgan asked.
“That’s a shame. It sounded like it would be fun.” Her voice was playful now.
Tony eventually glanced up and made eye contact with him. A large smile spread across his face. “Uncle Steve.” He exclaimed putting his drink to the side and running to throw his arms around him as best he could. Tony pulled away a moment later. “I was just making a martini. Want one?” and he was back behind the bar in no time, pouring two glasses.
Wade took a seat by Peter, drawing him into a half hug before he spoke again, ignoring the mention of Ned. “Your mother threatened me.” Wade explained.
Then Ned got to chattering again, trying to justify his point. Peter was about to rebut when he sensed something – or rather, someone – behind him. He got pulled into a hug before he could register what was happening, his feet completely off the ground.
“It might be important.” Tony assured in and Stephen sighed; frustration written all over his face. He sat up once he had his phone and began typing away in response to the message he had received. Steve had discovered some new information about Hammer’s case.
“T’challa?” Bucky laughed. “He’s the King, Sam. He’s married. I’m married.” He went on.
Leave it to Wade Wilson to sneak his way into his mom’s Christmas party at their home and casually hang out in Peter’s room like it was nothing.
Next he was fondling his balls with his other hand and he peered up at Tony gauging his reaction. He saw his eyes widen with arousal and his checks turning slightly red. He took the opportunity to slide one of his balls into his mouth and suckled it. Tony audibly gasped and it wasn’t long before he gave his clenching hole some much needed attention. He kissed the rim and Tony moaned out his name. He slid his tongue into him and he saw him squirming around hoping Steve would get on with the sex already. His legs were already quaking from sitting in the same position for so long. Steve noticed his discomfort and opted to place another pillow behind his head and one under his butt. He went back to feasting on his wet hole when Tony told him to continue. Steve wanted him to enjoy this and he knew Tony would tell him if he didn’t like something and he would stop right away.
As expected, she wasn’t wearing any panties and Remy’s cock slipped inside her wet folds. “You’re terrible.” He whispered and their conversation ended with sounds of fevered lovemaking.
A smile spread across Anna’s face. It would mean the world to her if she got to see her friends again so soon. “That’s so sweet of Mom.” The word sounded foreign on her tongue. She was better off sticking to calling her parents by their first names for a while longer – until she grew used to it.
but she allowed him to continue. “And I did. We did and you did a great job with Amelia. You’re a good mother.”
Harley stuttered for a second before he mustered up some confidence. “She’s seventeen, Dad. That’s a 2-year difference. Totally legal.”
Professor Xavier wished them the best of luck and Anna was grateful for the home he’d given her when she was all alone. Now their family was complete, and the DNA test results that were presented in the next few days only further solidified everyone’s assumptions. Anna Marie, now officially Anna Stark Rogers, after some paperwork was in fact Steve and Tony’s long-lost child.
“I know Peter likes you a lot and I’m trying to understand why but…” Steve paused, shaking his head. “No.” he said again. “You need to leave. You need to stay away from my son for good this time.”
The moment his butt hit the chair he had to ask, “Why didn’t you tell me Strange was here?” Sam skimmed over the guests until he spotted Strange by a table across the lawn sitting with Tony. They were holding hands and Strange was whispering in Tony’s ear from time to time.
Mother’s Day came and on the day of, Morgan, Peter and Morgan’s kitten, Binx woke up to find Tony busying himself on the back lawn. There was a crew of people setting large tents up on the lawn, chairs and tables and containers of food being displayed among other things. Peter and Morgan had been woken by the commotion even though their rooms were a few floors up. They shared a look upon discovering their mother’s whereabouts before Morgan had to ask, what was happening.
“Shut up.” Tony snarked.
“I really don’t see why he thinks this is any of his business,” he groaned, typing out an angry text to Steve.
“I’m happy for you Thor.” Bruce spoke with his tempered voice. “There is something special about having a son.” He knew. Nathan was the best thing that happened to him and he was forever grateful to Betty for giving him the chance to be a father. Seeing your child for the first time was an electrifying experience. Holding them in your arms, knowing this little human is a part of you and watching them grow was the most heartwarming feeling. It was by no means easy but it was worth everything. Bruce looked around at his friends. Most of them had kids. They knew the feeling and his eyes landed on Natasha. Laughing and chatting with guests.
the murder.”
“I don’t like secrets between us Rems.” Anna breathed when they pulled away, she cradled the back of his bare neck and he groaned as she wilfully intensified his pain. She could see the prominent outline of the veins in his neck and a fire lighting in his eyes. He was aroused. Anna chuckled, removing her hand as Remy swallowed, hard.
She was happy with herself for exposing Harley and Torunn. Though, she didn’t care for Harley anymore, she hadn’t fully moved pass the incident and her family rivalry with her cousin could go on for centuries and she wouldn’t mind. In her mind, Nertha believed she had hit two birds with one stone.
“Yeah.” Tony answered. Steve’s mind was now conjuring up images of Wade. Wade with Peter and he sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. “At least he’s being safe.” Tony tried but Steve wasn’t convinced. This would plague him for the rest of his life. His baby boy was growing up, way too fast.
Tony joined them in that moment and Steve pulled him in closer with an arm around his waist. “How was your shower?” He questioned him.
“How can you be sure?” Stephen questioned, looking over Steve’s shoulder at Tony before speaking his next words with pure venom. “He was spreading his legs for you days after we broke up,” He paused, watching Steve’s eyes light up with a blue fire of rage, knowing his next words would set the ever-calm Steve Rogers off. “Like a fucking whore.”
, he always told her.
Tony:
That was Steve’s most recent text to Tony. They had been discussing their plans to find Paige. It was only two days after the Hammer incident, but Tony did not want to waste any time when it pertained to possibly reuniting with his long-lost daughter. Steve felt the same. Tony had eventually caught Stephen up with everything Hammer had done, everything Stephen claimed Rhodey had omitted but Tony knew better. Stephen was acting oblivious.
Steve was happy to hear that. He and Tony had learnt the extend of her powers and they feared for her safety and anyone else if she became involved in crime-fighting. Charles Xavier had told them; Anna was far more powerful than she realized. They didn’t know what they’d do if that day ever came.
“For sex?” She tilted her head to the side, looking at him knowingly.
I was peer pressured into writing this. So here's chapter 2.
They had devised a plan to make Anna the sole heir of S.I. by any means possible as compensation for the abandonment of Steve and Tony so she and Remy would always be financially stable. Steve and Tony caught on sooner, rather than later, thankfully and stopped them from ever putting their plans into effect. The couple had intended to kill anyone who got in their way as they did with Justin Hammer.
“17 years. We were all walking on eggshells around each other for 17 years.” Nat sighed. Tears formed in her eyes as she thought about the awkward situation Justin Hammer left them in.
She scanned the room again, taking it all in. “It is quite mediocre for Uncle Tony's style.” Torunn had to admit. She meant no disrespect. She just told it as she saw it. This wasn’t Tony’s usual style of party planning.
(See the end of the chapter for
“This is incredible.” Tony said, to everyone and then to Steve specifically.
“Oh yeah? Conspiracy, right?” She taunted him, taking the drink from his hands. The drinks were clearly catching up with him. “Trust your husband.”
He opened the door without looking through the peephole because he was convinced it was Bucky. It wasn’t Bucky. Tony stood at his door, his back turned to him. He turned around, his arms folded over his chest when he heard the door open.
“Not so bad yourself.” Tony reciprocated, dragging him over to where the kids were hanging out. “Come. I want you to meet the kids.” Morgan, Harley and Peter were standing by one of the food tables eating and conversing with their friends and each other. They had made an effort to stay together upon Tony’s request so he could introduce them to Stephen and vice versa.
"It's a promise." Harley assured him. His father didn't deserve anymore heartache. He wouldn't let it happen.
Steve brought up school next, asking Anna if she’d had any plans for college after she’d finished at Xavier’s school. She expressed her dreams to join the X-men; to do some good in the world, and she still wanted to. Steve had regretted asking. Harley, Peter and Morgan had all expressed their interest in being superheroes in the past, long before they knew they had the Super Soldier Serum in their DNA. They knew what their parents did, and they wanted to be a part of it. Steve nor Tony entertained the idea. Peter had only ‘gotten away with it’ because he was older now, the world was a lot safer and Tony kept tabs on him.
“Don’t,” He warned. “Hold it.” He took his hand away from his clit and focused on his thrusts; each one going deeper and deeper into his warm, wet cunt. Tony was frantic. Steve was about to explode. Literally.
“I’m not looking to try for a baby anymore…” Tony confessed because though it wasn’t the main reason. It sure was part of it. His baby-making days were long gone. He just wanted to be happy with Steve and grow old together. He would settle with grandkids coming for a visit one day and Tony knew that might be sooner rather than later with all his children partner-up.
Thank you for all the "get well" comments. I'm feeling like myself again.
“Hold that thought Friday.” And Tony went in search of Pepper who was busying herself conversing with other guests.
They’d talk later of course so Bucky decided to have his breakfast for now. He ate his fill and was about to toss his garbage in the kitchen trash can when he saw a suspicious sheet of paper crumpled up on top. He reached in and grabbed it, straighten out the paper. It was from a DNA centre, more specifically DNA results. Results that stated that Sam and Winter were a 99.9% match as expected. Bucky already knew that, but Sam hadn’t trusted him and had gone behind his back and got their daughter tested.
“Oh no. Cassie and Christie are enough.” Hope had enjoyed helping Scott with raising Cassie. She considered Cassie her own; a good kid, surrounded by so much love from 4 parents.
“Unless something happened with the baby, I don’t know why you’re calling.”
“It’s all legal babe.” Steve assured him. “I promise.”
Pepper had actually reached out to him. She apparently had a long conversation with Tony about what was going on now and what happened in the past. She had even come over a few times, bringing stuff for the baby. She brought Morgan and she got to unofficially meet her baby brother. Pepper didn’t. She knew this must be so awkward and she gave Steve his space.
“Really?” Morgan didn’t expect an acceptance of her apology so quickly. She was disrespectfully towards her and no matter the situation, she should have never intruded in her parents’ business. It wasn’t her place. It had nothing to do with her. Now finding out the truth, she realized how much she had overstepped.
“We’re having a meeting without Anna?” Peter pointed out once he entered his brother’s room and didn’t see his twin.
Then there was Sam, Bucky, Winter and a 2 month old baby boy feeding at Bucky’s nipple. Yet another miracle baby for them. Sam and Bucky had given up on trying for a baby and Bucky was so convinced he couldn’t get pregnant that he didn’t notice until he was 3 months along. Their son, Fallon Wilson-Barnes was a beautiful baby who favored his older sister when she was a baby with Sam’s dark skin, his nose, ears and Bucky’s gray eyes, eye shape and his big chocolate curls.
“Uncle Bucky,” Bucky corrected. He took great pride in calling himself that. Steve didn’t mind and the doctor always humored him.
Tony sighed, glancing over at Steve. “Alright so what did you have in mind? A spring wedding or summer?” Harley had gotten himself into this mess. No point in trying to fight Thor’s decision. That was an Asgardian matter now.
- Two people got into SHIELD the night of the murder
“You don’t think they’re still ‘seeing’ each other?”
On the other side of Tony’s bedroom door, Steve was rejoining Tony also wearing a robe. His brows were knitted together. “Birth control?” He asked, because maybe he didn’t hear it right as his eyes darted
“Are you okay?” He had to ask. He couldn't see anything physically wrong with Tony.
“No. We still love each other.” Carol stressed, truthfully. They didn’t fall out of love. She just happened to develop feelings for someone else, as well.
Where do they go after the revelation of Justin’s hand in the downfall of their relationship? After Tony had moved on? After Steve found out the baby, he was growing to love wasn’t his? After they’d discovered there might be a chance their other daughter was out there?
“You should meet her.” He implied, once dinner was done and Peter helped him wash the dishes.
“Definitely.” Torunn handed her a tissue.
“Hey man.” He pulled up the chair next to him so Steve could sit.
“I will. Love you too mom. Bye,” he hung up and sat with Bruce and Nat.
“Whatever you decide, I’ll be fine with.” Nathan responded, adjusting his glasses and smiling at her. “You’re going be the one carrying him or her. It’s your body. I would never ask you to do something you don’t want to.” And that was gratifying. He wasn’t going to force her to do anything.
Loki greeted Nertha and then Torunn. “My dear nieces.” Loki never failed to let his brother and sister know how much he preferred their children over them. He and Nertha shared a hug and bowed before Torunn after which she pulled him to his feet and hugged him tightly. She definitely inherited Thor’s strength.
“Why are you here?”
“Always Jake.” Amelia answered. Harley kept his attention on the suit before him while a chuckle escaped his lips. Jacob chose to ignore it.
“If you didn’t want me anymore all you had to do was tell me.”
“Thanks.” He smiled. “Help yourself to some food I guess.”
“You don’t have to do this,” he begged. Steve couldn’t believe what he was hearing. SJ was going to be here in less than 3 months and Tony still wanted him to terminate his pregnancy. “Pepper and I are getting a divorce,” he continued. He didn’t know that. Pepper had been over a couple times now and she’d never mentioned a divorce. Steve didn’t know what to think. Tony took one of Steve’s hands in his own and Steve looked down at it in confusion. “We can be together Steve.”
“Rhodey came by a few days ago. Said you were dating
“Okay. Just making sure you weren’t under mind control or chipped or something.” She quipped.
Thanks for reading!
“I missed you too.” Anna said, observing his face and staring into his red orbs as she pressed him against a wall, while standing between his legs.
“Remember I told you, me and most of my family found out who my dad had the affair with all those years ago.” Wade could recall it.
“Yes. I know what you’re thinking right now.” Wade remarked and Peter’s eyes widened. He did it again. “I’m kidding,” he confessed sitting by the ledge of the building. Peter followed suit, keeping a safe distance between them. “I followed you home a few times.”
Steve was embarrassed and feeling guilty. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair what he’d left Tony to deal with. A 2-year-old, a 10-month-old and pregnant with twins while he was out having fun with his friends and ended up sleeping with one of them.
He hit send and a message popped up indicating that his message could not be sent because he had been blocked. Steve put his phone down and started sobbing. Bucky glanced over at Steve, reaching a hand out to comfort him.
“I can’t believe you kept this from me.” Steve complained, sitting up to line his leaking cock up with Tony’s clenching pussy.
Anna stayed at Stark Mansion. It was her home now, no matter the circumstances and Peter was still there too. She couldn’t abandon her twin who she’d developed a close bond with. Anna formed a good relationship with Morgan as well so meeting up and spending time together was common.
Wade nodded. “I would never hurt him.” He pulled Tony in a hug.
“That’s usually every former Avenger and their families. We might have some Guardians this year, Aunt Gamora and Uncle Quill.” Peter decided to take her a few floors down into the home theatre where all his and Morgan’s friends were. “And Mom also mentioned that he extended the invitation to the X-men.”
“Down, girl.” Cassie snarked. “Tell us about your love life.”
“Torunn basically found her snooping around Mom’s lab. Said she was working on an invention.” Harley said in a mouthful.
“That’s a shame.” Amelia noted.
T’challa had invited Bucky and his family to join him in Wakanda for the summer holidays. Winter was indifferent about the entire thing; she’d never been to another country before. Sam was ecstatic. He’d been to Wakanda once before and he loved everything about it. He was also anticipating the royal treatment he was confident they would be receiving on account of Winter being betrothed to Prince Azari, Wakanda’s future King.
“I care for you. I have so much love for you, Stephen.” And with each word, he approached the bed and finally sat by him.
“Tony.” Steve was teasing, stopping his nibbling and placing chaste kisses on the area. “What do you want, Tony?”
“No.” Steve explained. “You haven’t. To be completely honest, I can hardly remember what took place that night but I know I’ve never felt anything for Nat; she’s never felt anything for me. And as for Tony, my feelings for him have never changed.”
“Geez!” Steve shot up, walking in circles with one hand on his hip and the other brushing his hair back. “Did he force himself on you?” He stared at Peter who looked completely mortified. “Tones, did you call the cops?”
“Just don’t leave me again.”
Peter opened his door slightly, peering out at his mother. “It’s okay mom. We’re used to it.” He explained. And that wasn’t a very comforting thought. He hated to think his kids were going to turn out like him; a product of dysfunctional home. “Good night, mom,” Peter finished, closing his door before Tony could reply.
Sif fixed her gaze upon her. “That was almost a month ago. Why wait this long to say something?”
He didn’t want a relationship with his birth father and he needed time to forgive his birth mother for he already had a family and he had no intention to come back to the U.S. after this visit. His family wasn't there and Lila Barton was eager to move back with him to his home country.
“Don’t call me that.” Steve had lectured, sternly and Peter and Tony begged him to lighten up. Wade was going to be family.
“He was going to give up his accomplice in a statement the next day.” Bruce explained. Natasha knew that too, but she didn’t appreciate the allegations being tossed at her like that.
“I can’t.” Tony pleaded into the crook of his neck. He couldn’t cum again and not that soon. He couldn’t.
Stephen was finishing up with his toiletries while Tony discussed the new information. He didn’t mind hearing about the investigation because he worried for Tony’s safety, but he did not want to hear Steve’s name being mentioned in
Jacob stopped his story to address the use of the nickname. “Since when do you call Amelia that?” He raised an eyebrow, looking from his girlfriend to Harley.
“Yes.” Tony repeated, loud enough for the room to hear. Everyone applauded and cheered while Stephen slid the ring onto Tony’s finger and got up to finally pull his new fiancée into a hug. They kissed briefly and the first thing Tony saw when he pulled away was the back of Steve walking out of the room.
"No need baby. I was still able to give Harley a happy life, even though he had one parent." Tony then reached over to his bedside table to get some tissues for him.
And then Tony was smiling at him and the last thing he heard was “He’s so perfect. Thank you” before, everything went black for him.
“She knows something.” Morgan concluded. “What if she’s the killer?” She whispered. Another very serious allegation.
“You think this is a joke, huh?” Steve said through gritted teeth.
Nat couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She never had any intentions to hurt Steve and Tony. Never. “No.” Her voice didn’t falter and if she was lying, no one could sense it.
“Spiderman.” He was terribly close to him and he could somehow feel this guy’s eyes staring into his through their masks.
She was so lost in her thoughts that she didn’t realize she was crying until Nathan kissed her wet cheek. He wrapped his arms around her, and she smiled through her tears. Nathan was the only person she ever let see her this vulnerable. She had to be strong for everyone else; for her brothers, for her friends and for her parents.
“Something on your mind Jakey?” she hooted. Jacob responded instantly.
“It’s dangerous.” Steve concluded.
“I promise you they do Tones. They’re just not kids anymore.” He whispered by his ear, but that only made Tony sadder.
“Not even Thor.” She emphasized and Pepper realized this must be serious. “But Valkyrie?” Carol paused. Only Valkyrie could come this close. Her eyes started to glow beyond her control. “She makes me feel the way I felt when I first met James.”
Steve sighed and held his arms open for Anna to slide into the embrace. “I tried.” He whispered. It was so unfortunate his two youngest had such horrendous taste in men. What he wouldn’t do to get rid of Wade Wilson and Remy LeBeau. He would be civil though, but he would never fully accept them.
“I want you to suffer. I want you to watch as your family suffers, and your life falls apart before you...” His eyes darkened behind his glasses and a grin spread across his face when Tony realized what he was referring to.
Harley thought about it. She was probably right. “I just can’t imagine Aunt Nat and my father being a thing, betraying my mother like that. And no one knew.”
Tony had been staying at Carter’s Mental Health facility for the past 2 years. Steve knows Tony isn’t mentally ill in any way but it was either this or jail. When Lance Tate had shown up dead only a day after the custody battle was lost, the evidence all pointed to Tony. Tony had choked the man to death, his fingerprints where around his neck. But Tony was always too calculated to wind up in jail. A few bribes here and there, and a couple sexual encounters with the right people and Tony’s case was ruled as a mental health issue rather than murder.
“Yeah. We’re together.” Harley said it like it was obvious. Jacob almost choked.
“What business?” Peter wondered.
Bucky was sad. He didn’t have a short temper like some people. His anger always diminished into sadness. After finding the DNA test papers, Bucky had cried, wounded by the distrust his husband had in him. He went about his daily routine, but the revelation weighed heavy on his heart. It hurt. He had never loved anyone else. He had never been with anyone else, but Sam thought otherwise.
“Wow,” was all Tony could say. He was getting tired of this conversation. His point still stood. Peter tried thereafter to plead his case.
“Guys, I think I’m going to head home now before my dad realizes I’m not in my room and calls my mom.” Peter responded, swinging off to his father’s house. Ned and Michelle said their goodbyes and Peter hung up. On his way home he spoke to Karen. She was now built into his suit all thanks to himself and he asked her to get all the information there was on Deadpool.
Morgan’s stomach growled at the sight of it. She hadn’t had an appetite lately, but she couldn’t pass up on this. She scarfed the sandwich down in no time. Nathan was glad to see this and then he was leaving the room again, saying he’d be right back. He returned with a box.
close to the throne in the line of succession. No one asked her opinion though.
“No!” Peter countered. “He refuses to touch me and we’re just friends.”
Harley handed Peter a box of tissues that was close by. He wiped his eyes and settled his breathing. Everyone left the floor open for him.
“Same ole, same ole.” He was disappearing into the en suite. “Actually, I met a weird guy at the bar today.”
Stephen retreated with his advances. “Can you just think about it?” He was getting frustrated.
Tony saw Steve’s face change from happiness to concern. He could guess what was on his mind. Tony shot him a comforting smile from across the table. Steve returned it. He believed Anna would be okay even when she accessed her full potential.
“I wish I could stay in you forever.” He caught his breath. His cock still nested in his hole, beads of cum slipping out.
“You better let me go before I change my mind, Wade.” Tony remarked.
“Do we know that for sure?” Harley questioned. “Is she really our sister?” All three of them shared a look. They’d never considered that. They never had reason to doubt that. Anna was DNA tested. How wrong could that test be?
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.” He reached out to remove his shirt but his finger, brushed up against the spot where he’d been shot. Tony didn’t react, however. It didn’t hurt anymore. He had healed but a scar was left behind to remind him, even though he wouldn’t forget; like every bad thing that happened in his life so far. Tony just wanted to be happy for once.
“And I’m telling you. It’s okay. Morgan just needs family around her right now.” And Stephen isn’t family, he almost added that part. Stephen is just the boyfriend. Not the father of his children. Tony realized after a moment that Stephen had gone quiet on the other end.
“That’s understandable. I don’t have any kids of my own but I get it. Tell me about them,” Stephen tried making conversation. He was doing a lot better at this first-date-in-a-long-time-thing than him.
Once Amelia had heard from her mother about Morgan’s misfortune, she made it a priority to see her best friend. Amelia wasn’t the least bit upset that Morgan’s parents had tried to keep this a secret. She knew it was too sensitive a matter to be going around sharing with everyone all willy-nilly.
At this point, everyone, from their extended family to their close friends knew Tony was pregnant. He’d announced it only days ago and within a day everyone in the world knew that former Superheroes, Tony Stark-Rogers and Steve Rogers were expecting their 5th child together – the news outlets were all over it. Plenty of whom were begging for interviews but neither Tony nor Steve were ready to speak publicly on their baby yet. They worked with Pepper instead to do an interview later down the line but not anytime soon.
“Pretty good way to die if you ask me,” Tony smirked, hopping of the counter and getting back into his clothes. Steve followed suit. He watched Tony walk away, all messy hair and glossy eyed; a massive hickey on his neck. He was perfectly, beautifully and effortlessly pulling of his just-fucked look. His cock twitched.
He sighed, looking down at Stephen. “Can you blame me for being worried?”
“I can’t believe you made me wait so long.” Peter stated, a hint of anger laced in his tone.
“Right now?” he questioned, in disbelief and she grinned innocently at him, like she wasn’t in the process of removing the rest of her clothes. And a lot of thoughts came flooding into his mind; like his parents –all 3 for that matter – were a few doors down from them and he didn’t have a condom.
Steve’s shirt was clinging to his body and any one could clearly make out a bump. Pepper wasn’t blind and knew this had something to do with Tony. She wanted to go back in the house and get Steve a towel or something to dry off but her feet wouldn’t move. She was looking at a very pregnant man. A very pregnant man who spent so much time with Tony Stark it was unhealthy. A very pregnant man who happened to be Steve Rogers. Pepper watched the scene unfold. Steve shivering in the cold as he made his way to his car, shooting Pepper a smile before driving away. And Pepper didn’t bring herself to move until she could no longer see Steve’s car.
Bucky couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “No way! I’ve never been with T’challa.” Sam wasn’t sure if he should believe it. “If Winter was his, why would I agree to her marrying Azari one day.”
“I was afraid. I’m still afraid.” And Tony didn’t know he was crying until a sob broke from his throat. Steve rose from his seat and approached him. Tony took several steps back before Steve was an inch away from him.
Once inside, he noticed a new necklace around her neck. He concluded it must have been the one she had been telling him about for the past few weeks. Tony had been successful in creating a device to neutralize her powers while wearing it and embedded it into a necklace coated in Ironman-red. Remy had forgotten to correlate the two – the accessory and its purpose – and based on instinct reached out for her face with gloved hands. Anna pulled back. “Do it without.” She whispered before pointing at her necklace to remind him of its purpose.
Steve sucked so hard, his skin was a pinkish hue. He was sure he hated pussy unless it was Tony. Tony’s legs wrapped around his shoulders and Steve lift one slightly to get better access. Then Tony’s hands were grabbing clumps of his hair, yanking at it for dear life. He’d never been eaten out before but damn was Steve doing a freaking good job. He tried pushing Steve away but with no avail. Steve held him in place firmly. Then he just let everything go, letting all of his sexual tension flow right through him and into his boyfriend’s, willing mouth. Steve gladly swallowed every bit of his cum.
“Meet me in the backyard in 20 minutes.” It was a request that peaked his curiousity. “Pajamas would be fine.” Steve finished and Tony finally took in his own appearance.
Everyone was always left to believe that the woman in question was a stranger; a one-night stand. Not someone they knew. Not someone they called family. Not Aunt Nat.
“A little.” He admitted. “I thought I might lose you.” Tony reached out and took one of Stephen’s hands in his.
“But I didn’t.” She tried to clear things up before, he got carried away.
“Hi Torunn.” Anna began. “What’s going on?”
“Maybe this makes me a bad person Tony.” He was staring into his eyes, “but I feel like a weight has been lifted off me.” He paused. “For the first time in my life I don’t feel like the 16-year-old kid she took advantage of, that she used for sex, all those years ago.”
Tony moaned, feeling Steve’s last pump of cum flowing into him and hearing Steve’s almost silent groan. Opening his eyes finally, he saw Steve, inches away from his face watching him curiously as they lay on their sides in bed and Tony couldn’t prevent himself from blushing.
His red eyes peered into hers and Amelia started to question the things her mother had told her on account of Remy’s inconspicuous powers of persuasion.
“Sounds like you’re on board.” Pepper responded.
Anna followed Morgan for some time until they were a good distance away from the party. “I know about you and Remy.” Morgan began, careful not to mention that Peter had been the informant. She saw the visible shock on Anna’s face which turned nonchalant in seconds. There was no doubt in Anna’s mind that Peter had talked. Only a very close select few knew about her relationship with Remy.
“Why are you looking at me like I’m a ghost?” He noted the horrid state the apartment was in and Tony grew sympathetic.
“No.”
“Where was she the night of?” Harley put out after listening quietly on the conversation.
He got to his room without being spotted by anyone. He couldn’t imagine what might happen if anyone found out what they’d done. Especially Thor, in his own home, nonetheless but Harley failed to realize that Nertha was always somewhere lurking about.
Harley and Peter learned alot about Steve Rogers after he moved into their family home. The guy seemed genuine but the two Stark men weren't going to let up that easily. Even if he had a disability. Besides, he had managed to win over their father so who knew what else he was capable of.
“Okay.” Wade scooped up his daughter and got her seated in one of the back-passenger seats and secured her with a seatbelt. He handed her his phone to distract her while he talked with Peter for a second.
“No.” Stephen lectured, placing one hand on his hip. “I love when
And Pepper was helping to run Stark Industries. If that wasn’t enough, she had been Tony’s support system for a while now and she was thankful that he was doing much better as of late.
“So, that’s it?” He wondered, pushing the lock of white hair out of her face and finally resting the hand on her cheek again as he thought of their recent phone conversations. She knew what he was referring to. They had had a plan.
This pregnancy was a perilous one, at Tony’s age, their baby boy was at some risk and he wouldn’t let anything happen to them. Then Tony would roll his eyes because Kayla had been very clear, a little
Steve’s name was called next and he and Bucky went in. The doctor greeted them as Steve lay down on the bed – he knew the routine – and Bucky sat in one of the empty chairs in the office. “Steve and Bucky.” He smiled at them.
“Oh. Is you-know-who on the list?” Carol tilted her head to the side a bit and gave her a knowing look.
The door slid open and Anna walked in. “What are you doing with Natasha Romanov?” Remy smirked at her as she plopped down beside him, the white of her hair falling forward. She pushed the section of hair out of her face, peering up at him with those gorgeous brown eyes, waiting for an answer.
“Yes, well.” He said nonchalantly. “It’s not for you. But for the baby.” Thor had a smug grin on his face and Torunn stopped them in their tracks.
“Oh dad.” And Morgan got up from her seat so she could be by her father’s side. They shared a heartfelt embrace and she couldn’t prevent herself from getting a little teary-eyed in the process.
“Yeah but that’s two months away.” Amelia half-whined but she looked forward to it anyway. The group soon made their way to their respective classes.
“Yes.” Her hand was casually resting on her mid-section.
Reviews, Comments and Kudos are greatly appreciated! ✨
“Of course,
“Your honor. If I may speak freely,” he began interrupting both lawyers. Judge Brooks allows it. Tate and Caffery pause and allow him to speak as well.
He heard Peter whimper. “More please.”
“That’s why you’re never getting married Harley.” Amelia teased. Harley could care less. Marriage wasn’t for him. Nor were relationships.
“You’re a smart woman Virginia Potts.” He snarked, giving her the once over. “That much is true.” She watched his eyes return to their original state and shift over to the left of her as their daughter entered the room.
“I mean…” Michelle trailed off. Amelia was surprised to hear her even talk again. She scanned the room noting all her friends’ reactions. Even Torunn couldn’t deny what Lila had said. Morgan was the only one that looked away when her eyes reached her.
He started off by stressing his appreciation of everyone present, reminding them of how grateful he was to have them. He always craved to have a big family, after growing up as an only child. He rambled on about all the things that happened that year, keeping personal matters mostly vague.
Justin Hammer sat at the bar. The same one Stephen Strange liked to visit, every day after work for a drink or two around 10 pm like clockwork. Justin already had a drink in hand when Strange walked in and sat two barstools away from him. He ordered a whiskey and Justin started to put his plan into effect. He retrieved his phone from within his jacket and pretended to read a message that got him a little ticked off.
“Why?”
Steve ignored those words. “Do you have another appointment scheduled with Kayla?”
“I’ll think about it.”
“And just how long were you planning to keep Harley under mind control?”
Not only have I been busy in real life. I also have another story that I have to update every week.
Steve gasped as more tears sprouted from his eyes. Tony had had a painful love life. It was heartbreaking.
“Hi Uncle Steve,” came Lila’s voice. She sounded ashamed. “I’ll just get dressed and leave.” She bolted to the bathroom without a response and was out within two minutes, dressed and out the door in a second.
Tragic.
“It doesn’t make our minds immune Harley.” Morgan teased. Harley knew that.
“We met at the library,” Peter lied. Tony sighed. This was getting ridiculous, really.
“I wish my parents could be as happy as yours. And you have 3 parents.”
“Are you two actually fucking?” He shook his head. “Well why are you two still sneaking around?” She didn’t understand why, when everyone had moved pass the entire Hammer situation and her parents had sorted out everything for them.
and with that thought, Tony remembered his birthday was coming up too. He hated his birthdays. Didn’t like to celebrate himself; not anymore; not like he use to when he was younger. But for Morgan, any of his other kids or any of his friends or family, he’d go all out for them. He’d throw the biggest most extravagant parties. Morgan’s was no exception because little miss perfect was turning 18 and that was a big deal.
“Of course. I never said we shouldn’t support her.” Tony said. “But what happened to reprimanding her?” Steve was quiet again, thinking. He refused to believe he put Morgan above his parenting. Did he? Then Tony spoke again. “What if it was Peter who had gotten pregnant?”
She thought about it for a second. “Somewhere around the end of April, early May.” She answered.
“I’m going to miss you.” Tony responded as Steve entered the room, got around to greeting everyone and finally taking the empty seat by Anna. His hair was almost fully blonde again after a few weeks of growing out the brown and Tony noticed his beard was gone. He missed a beard on Steve. It made him 10 times more attractive. Tony almost bit his lip, in arousal. Almost.
“I don’t know Harley. What was the age of the last girl you had sex with? Done any drugs? Drank any alcohol at your birthday party?” Steve went on and with each question, came a new state of shock, horror and embarrassment on Harley’s face. He could hear both Morgan and Peter trying but failing to stifle their laughter.
“But I can’t. I don’t think you’re even legal yet,” Wade’s hand still holding Peter’s at his wrist. No. He wasn’t legal at all and Peter knew Wade wasn’t in his particular age group. But why would that ever matter to Wade. He killed people for a living. Surely kissing an underage kid wouldn’t be the worst thing ever. And as much as he wanted to say all that and beg Wade to kiss him, he composed himself and changed the subject.
“Ah. It’s good to see you again daughter. You’ve grown so much.”
“Stay with me Tony.” He whispered so only Tony could hear. Steve could see his eyes, opening and closing from time to time. He had to assume Tony was going in and out of consciousness.
Tony decided to end the conversation right then and there. “I have to go.”
“Yeah. I'm not the smartest person but I know I like Peter and I want to be with him. One day. When he’s older of course. I'll wait for him.” Wade chimed in, subconsciously reaching out for Peter’s hand and squeezing it for comfort. Peter took it willingly.
Steve then pulled out his phone and texted Tony to ask how Peggy was doing. He also had plenty of missed calls and texts from Sharon, but he wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction of acknowledgement. He tried to break things off with her a few days ago and then she dropped a bombshell on him. She was pregnant and Steve didn’t know what to do anymore. Sam had laughed at him and Bucky had yet to say anything about it. His words were clearly lost on Steve.
“Oh yeah. I can’t blame you for wanting Tony back though. He’s got the best hole I’ve ever had…”
Morgan and Peter gave her a similar look and Anna soon joined them in laughter. For the longest time it was just them, the three Stark-Rogers, then she came along and now a new sibling was on the way. And they weren’t greedy, money-hungry, self-entitled individuals. It was just what was always promised to them from birth - written in Tony’s will long before Harley was born.
“But you love when people suck up to you.” Tony teased, scratching his salt and pepper coloured beard. He’d shaved recently per Tony’s request. His facial hair tended to irritate his thighs whenever he was between them. He never had this problem with Steve. He stayed mostly beardless and when he didn’t, it was never a bother because Steve’s hair was so soft. It tickled instead. Tony knew he wasn’t supposed to compare the two, but he couldn’t help it. Now Stephen’s beard was growing back but he did enjoy playing with the stubble.
“Both are still asleep Sir.” Jay provided. Tony was grateful. He didn’t want his kids to see him in this horrid state.
“Why would you say she isn’t our daughter, your sister?” He asked. That’s all Tony could focus on. Was she really not their daughter? If not, who had they let into their home, their lives and their hearts? Tears threaten to fall. He was scared. He couldn’t lose his daughter again.
Chapter 27: Long-lost Sister
“Why is that?”
Anyways, all that talk about Pietro and Remy being hot is me letting y'all know I find fictional characters attractive. Lol. How weird...
TAGS, WARNINGS and RELATIONSHIP TAGS may be refering to the Past, Present or Both! They might be only mentioned, done in real time OR both.
And for the entirety of the affair, that was all Steve ever wanted to hear. Tony had told him time and time again that he would never leave Pepper for him. He loved what he had with her. He loved his perfect family and he let Steve know he would always choose his family, come what may. But now. Now? Now, Tony was telling him he wanted him, that it was over with Pepper and they could be together. It was all he ever wanted. But what about SJ? Where does SJ fit in all this?
“I think Morgan would like the red, white and blue one,” Peter suggested. Tony shot up and turned in the direction of Peter’s voice. Tony looked over the banners again.
Stephen’s happiness didn’t falter. He accepted; just glad they were starting this journey. Tony’s phone went off and by instinct he reached over to grab it. Stephen stopped him. “Leave it.” He pleaded, his grip on his waist tightening and his lips found Tony’s. He reciprocated, allowing Stephen to grope his ass and succumbing to the affection.
Tony glanced over his reflection in the mirror one more time before he went to the living room and asked his kids how he looked.
And Rogue (Anna Marie) is one of my top 5 favourite X-men. I just had to make her Paige✨
Nebula spent most of her time with the Stark-Rogers kids. Tony was always good to her and in turn she had nothing but appreciation and adoration for his children. Quill was ever the social butterfly and conversing with everyone while Gamora held a few conversations with other women in the room, namely Hope Van Dyne and Asgard’s Queen, Sif. She’d met both women before and shared her plans with them of making more frequent trips to earth in the near future.
“And welcome to ours.” Sif chimed in, joining the group from the right. Thor was close behind and they all turned to greet each other. Torunn had to remark, how lucky she had become. She knew she had a good husband by her side and incredible in-laws in the family she’d been living with for the past 6 years. Everything was going to be great. She could feel it.
“Yes. She said she was working on an invention. She swore me to secrecy so I wouldn’t tell Uncle Tony.” Torunn provided. Anna hadn't said anything about not telling Harley.
“Johnathan. Johnathan Doeran.” Justin provided, smiling proudly at him.
The judge asked for order and Tate took the opportunity to close his opening argument. “As you can see,” he addressed the court room. “Mr. Rogers is clearly unstable. That is all your honor.” He straightens his tie and takes his seat by Tony again. Steve finds Tony smirking at him. Tony was positive he had this case in the bag. And Steve could guess from their interactions that they were sleeping together.
Harley knocked by the open door to get her attention. Morgan glanced up at her brother and even gave him a half smile. “Hey.” He began, joining her on her bed. He soon noticed a little black ball of fluff on her bed as well. She'd mentioned the kitten over text. He scooped the cat up, setting it down on his lap. “How are you feeling?”
“Nathan saw Remy with Aunt Nat.” Morgan supplied. It was time to put her theory out there. That Aunt Nat was involved with the murder and so was Remy LeBeau.
“You and Tony did exceptionally well with your three.” Vision reminded him. “We think we’ll be capable enough to care for a baby.”
“Dr Stephen Strange”, the older guy introduced himself, getting up to pull out Tony’s seat at the restaurant Pepper and Christine had made reservations for them.
“Stephen and I broke up.” Tony began. It was only three days ago but he figured he’d get the burning issue out in the open and out of the way. He wasn’t going to go into details about the incident, but his family did need to know they broke up and that any plans of a wedding were off now. The only wedding happening anytime soon was Harley and Torunn’s.
Steve was left pondering on his marriage with Tony that fell apart after 15 years and ended legally after 18. Sharon knew it. She’d chosen this date intentionally.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “You’re overreacting.”
“Never.” He only ever had eyes for her even when Harley tried to pressure him into his lifestyle. He wouldn’t put her through the heartbreak his mother went through and hadn’t recovered from. He kissed her to validate his point.
Amelia was in her kitchen getting a bottle of water and Morgan used her phone to project Torunn’s screen when a notification popped up. She only then remembered she had something to share with Torunn that she and Amelia had discovered. She had gotten a post notification on Instagram from @pietromaximoff. Morgan opened the app on another screen before her.
But Loki already knew Harley amd Torunn were very much interested in each other. He'd never tell the other though.
I hope you did too.
“Hey. It’s okay. I know how much you care for your parents, as you should. But just know that all is forgiven. We’re okay.”
“You don’t think I’ve tried?!” Stephen shouted back, rising from his chair. “He’s
“I just happen to know her dirty little secret.”
“Get your hands off my son.” Steve and Tony shouted at the same time. They glanced at each other and Peter grinned smugly at her.
Peter was a little offended. Wade looked equally apologetic.
Tony was startled out of his sleep when he heard a scream. He shot up. He could feel himself shaking all over. He spoke into the darkness. “Fri, what’s happening?”
He knew he repeatedly hurt Tony but he never cheated after the first time. He knew Tony deserved better. He deserved better than him and most of all, he deserved happiness. Nothing else had ever been easy in his life. Why should he add to his pain? Steve finally opted for, “We never…never again.” It was just that one time, that one stupid mistake that cost him everything.
So Tony got up, pulling out a pair of his own pajamas to wear after he took a shower. A pair of matching red pajama pants to Steve’s and the white long-sleeved shirt it came with.
“How on earth did you guess that?”
Stephen stopped his sucking and looked down at him. “Your kids are teenagers, Tony. They’re all probably having sex.”
She could put that off for only so long. Now she was pregnant. She knew this was a possibility. She knew there was a chance. She just wasn't expecting it but she really should have.
Also Remy & Anna are married in the comics and are literally the hottest couple 💕 (this version just happens to have a horribly large age difference. Yikes!)
“I didn’t know you were into women,” was all Rhodey could say.
While the party went on and Peter finally got what he always wanted, Anna had gone in search of her boyfriend. She thought Remy might be waiting close by to wish her a happy birthday but somehow, she found him walking away from her Aunt Natasha. It angered her, which left her to ask, once he was in earshot,
He found Jacob in his own dorm, smiling stupidly at his phone. He wondered how anyone could be that smitten with one single girl. “Don’t you get tired of sleeping with the same person, over and over again?” His words drew Jacob’s attention to him.
Tony sighed, removing the vibrator and placing it in the drawer where it belonged. He then sat up and awaited his kids’ arrival. Peter came in first, still in his pajamas, tray of food in hand and his sister close behind. They were almost identical. Peter’s hair was just a bit lighter and Morgan had Steve’s eyes but everything else from the way they smiled to the bridge of their nose was all the same. Harley, on the other hand, his first born son, was all Steve with his hair so light he almost looked blonde.
“I’m starting to think Nathan isn’t thinking for himself anymore.” Bruce chimed in. Following the revelation, Nathan had had a hard time being around Natasha. He felt like he was fraternizing with the enemy because Morgan was his girlfriend and she wasn’t on good terms with Nat. For the duration of his summer vacation in Russia, which he couldn’t back out of, he’d spent most of his time with Nat’s nephews Jaime and Levi instead.
Harley felt a sharp pain in his head and Jacob went to his aid, sitting him on the bed. He asked what happened again and Jacob finally answered. “Long story short. You’ve been under mind control for the last couple of weeks.”
Torunn was staring at her father, a silent gasp leaving her lips. She blinked a few times before refocusing. “Father.” She breathed, her tone mimicking a plea. “Why would you suggest such a thing?”
Peter:
“We did a DNA test.” Tony reminded them.
“Thank you for covering for me, Pep.” She thanked her.
Steve had found out first and told Tony the night he and Stephen had broken up. He’d sent him a simple text, hoping they’d get a chance to discuss it in person, soon after. Once they had that conversation, it was Tony who sought Anna out and spoke with her one-on-one, the day they had a recent family dinner. The day, he and Tony decided to rekindle their relationship, officially. Morgan and Peter had cut that conversation short, however and Tony made up an excuse,
“Wow. That obvious and I missed it.” Stephen sighed, closing his eyes. “Maybe it was Steve. Maybe Steve poisoned me…”
“Will you go with me Mj? As friends of course.” Peter asked. He didn’t mind going with one of his best friends. He liked guys. Everyone knew that and his mom and dad knew that long before he realized it. So he never really came out, like everyone else. It was just an unspoken thing. There weren’t really any guys at his school that he liked anyways.
And Tony had read every single one. Steve scrolled back to the most recent text. Tony had seen the picture of SJ. Steve typed out another message.
“Lila? Lila Barton?” Stood before him was Clint and Laura’s eldest child, waving at him. He hadn’t seen her since they were little kids but he vaguely remembered her being around Morgan’s age. She’d definitely grown up a lot. She looked good. Lila strolled towards him.
“And Mom and Dad. You knew.” Peter put in while staring at them with narrowes eyes.
Morgan and Amelia were hanging out at Amelia’s place. Her mother was at work and Calvin was out with Michelle Jones. Things had been going great between those two. The two girls had Torunn on a video call while she whined and murmured about having to meet suitors. Her brother’s birth only paused her crisis and resumed days afterwards. It took little to no time for the focus to be on her again, being Asgard’s crowned princess. Regardless of what Nertha believed, her position as future Queen still stood.
They were a gay couple and his husband thought their daughter’s attraction to girls was a phase.
Steve is shocked; Tony has only ever been this rough during sex. “Tony, stop. That’s hurting,” he pleads.
“Yes.”
“I thought that was a joke.” Peter stated. Tony had laughed it off the first and only time he mentioned him having a twin.
“Didn’t expect to see you here.” He spoke but his slight change of tone made Steve 100% sure that he was trying to berate him.
Steve turned to Bucky to hear what he had to say but he got the same thing from him. “Super gay,” he put in.
“Steve.” He moaned in response.
Tony unfolded his arms. “You don’t owe me an apology. We’ve both moved on.” They needed to keep reminding each other. “You’re free to be with whoever you want, date whoever you want. As am I.” Tony added that last part in for good measure. Steve could sense there was a but coming and he finished Tony’s train of thought.
“I apologize, Stark.” He responded, sincerely. “But this matter is of utmost importance.” Thor looked down at his daughter when she stood before him; her expression an unsettling one.
Anna chuckled as Remy took back his hand and was actively nursing it back to its original state by clenching and unclenching his fist. “Dad, please.” She tilted her head to the side, smiling cheekily at him. “He’s here to stay.”
Thoughts???
Tony adjusted his suit jacket as he and Pepper walked out of their 3-hour meeting. They had successfully launched their new project idea and if things went smoothly, it would be effective within 6 months. He greeted his workers as he and Pepper made it to his office. He smiled thinking of what Stark Industries had become. It was better and he was happy to know that his and Pepper’s kids would uphold the new reputation of the company long after they were gone. Well, Morgan more than the others. Peter, Harley, Amelia and Calvin weren’t that interested in running the company. Not as much as Morgan wanted to.
“And how long has mom been up?” Peter finished for Morgan, following her & Binx to the kitchen.
Michelle smiled at her. “No. Still a virgin. I’m just waiting for the right guy or girl.” She wasn’t sure if that was Calvin Potts.
A spark flashed across her eyes and Sif could see her fists visibly glow. Carol was an inch away from her face now. “Wanna say something else?” she hissed.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “How do you know about Hammer?”
Thoughts???
“Because of you Nertha, a mortal will sit on the Asgardian throne one day.” Her mother had lectured. Although Torunn and Harley’s children would only be half-human, the human side would always outweigh the God side in every Asgardian’s eyes.
“You know, each pregnancy is different.” She added while he sat on the exam bed this time.
“Why would he help her?” Peter continued.
Stephen sighed, took a deep breath and kneeled before him. He said his next words, carefully, lovingly. “But it did happen and because of it we found each other.” He took both of Tony’s hands in his.
They had walked in on party preparations on the 4
“If you see any change in her,” He began. “It’s by her own accord.” Though he did try to manipulate Amelia, her own free will was stronger. Remy had told himself he should have known that. This was his daughter after all, and she had his powers and more. She was stronger than him; he knew but he’d never admit it.
“No. We didn’t.” Morgan confessed but she wasn’t sure if Aunt Nat had gone on her own. She did seem extremely hell-bent on going.
“Hey!” Carol answered. Her voice was vibrant, loud and perky. Everything seemed good on her end. Maybe he should have called his dad first. Unlike his mom, his dad wasn’t very good at hiding his emotions.
Upon returning from Wakanda, Sam and Bucky spent more time together making love and reassuring each other that they only belonged to each other than ever before. They couldn’t get enough of each other, really. So much so that Sam’s unsettling confession about his jealously and his audacity to accuse Bucky of giving him another man’s child was never brought up again.
Maria took his hand and spoke in a sympathetic voice. “Are you okay honey?”
he thought but “Maybe we should hear Peter out.” He gestured to Peter who was now crying silently on one end of the sofa.
“Steve.” He responded, plainly.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Take up for Morgan. Pretend like our daughter can do no wrong. I know she’s your favorite. But come on…what she did…what they did is not okay.” Tony knew Steve loved Morgan so much that if she killed someone, Captain America and his righteousness be damned, he’d help her hide the body.
“Jealous ex syndrome.” Ned figured and Peter was starting to think that really was a thing. He'd heard more than enough cases about jealous exs. Some even as close as within his extended family.
“Maybe this makes me a bad person but I feel like a weight has been lifted off me.”
Nat finally found her voice. It was full of regret and shame. “Nothing’s going on Tony. It was a mistake. We had no idea what we were doing –” Tony cut her off because if this was her way of apologizing, she was doing at shit job at it.
“We love you mom,” Morgan chimed in, rising off Tony’s bed as well.
“Peter is just a kid.” Steve continued. “And Tony says you have a kid. Do you have any idea how disgusting and inappropriate that is? I would call the cops but how well could a cell hold an enhanced human?”
“Who had sex.” Tony reminded her. That had Steve quiet for a second before he fired back.
Pepper thought about it. Amelia was going to be 18 soon, there wouldn’t be need for a custody battle if he wanted his daughter in his life. Turning 18 also meant Amelia didn’t have to listen to her anymore. But having powers, being a superhero was so dangerous. She’d be attracting unwanted attention; attracting villains. She could recall clearly Tony’s early years of being Ironman and all the baggage that came with it and how it deteriorated his health. This was no walk in the park but what could she do for Amelia? Offer a piece of advice and hope she’d at least take it into consideration.
And he could vaguely remember, someone standing off to the side, further back. A blonde woman. Tony knew her. It was Sharon Carter, still pointing a gun at him as his eyes closed and he completely blacked out.
“It’s just me.” Anna said nonchalantly. “I was working on an invention.”
“I can kill for myself.” She whispered.
“I’m sure.” Tony stated and Anna released Stephen who held onto his bleeding neck as he walked away. Tony and Anna watched with satisfaction. Steve wasn’t oblivious to their expressions of joy, but they weren’t killers. Strange didn’t deserve to die.
And he yanked them down. Eyes now shut tightly because he wouldn’t dare look at Steve now. His legs were wobbling a bit and he felt like he was turning to jelly. He imagined Steve was staring at the part between his legs, absolutely horrified.
“Just how exactly did you meet my son, Wade?” Tony questioned, speaking Wade’s name with so much disgust. Tony kept his eyes on Wade as did Peter, wondering what he was going to come up with. He couldn’t possibly say they met up on a roof one night when they were “superhero-ing”.
“Tony.” He whispered into the shell of his ear.
“Sorry I asked.” Stephen finished and Tony disappeared out the door. Once he got in his car, he broke down, tears staining his face.
sweetie.” He almost screamed out when Steve clasped a hand over his mouth. Their eyes met and Tony’s cum spurted onto Steve’s torso and chest, and Steve released inside his warmth.
He was snacking on grapes while he watched Wade prep ingredients to add to the soup he was making.
“Yeah.” Carol responded, stepping into the bathroom. He heard the bathroom sink running. “She’s such a great person. She has a good heart. She –”
“Just a sec.” Tony shouted at him. He kept his moans quiet as he rode Steve. He figured they might as well finish up. He was almost there, and he could feel Steve getting closer too.
“Really?” he teased.
The duration of the summer brought Bucky absolute joy, Winter, time to gain some knowledge of the Wakandian traditions and customs – which she enjoyed and brought Sam anxiety.
“If you think so Harls. Suit yourself.”
“Truly. Those are remarkable powers.” Torunn pitched in. Harley kept her eyes on her as she spoke and Morgan who sat between the two found it very hard to miss. She was beginning to wonder if there was something going on between them.
Lila couldn’t say no. She liked meeting new guys, especially foreigners.
“Do my parents know you’re here?” He asked, cautiously after greeting Maria, who just so happened to answer for Wade.
Reviews, Comments and Kudos are always welcome! 💛✨💙✨❤✨
“Did you just jump 3 floors?”
But his doctor was still going. “Your urine test came back positive for pregnancy.”
Stephen understood that but he didn’t like all this time he’d be spending with Steve and even more so if Paige was really Paige. The news that Steve’s affair with Natasha wasn’t by their own free will gave room for a possible reconciliation - reconnection.
Then Friday was announcing that Stephen was in the elevator on the way up and Peter couldn’t be happier. He’d gladly trade out talk of his relationship with Wade for any drama that would likely ensue when Stephen and his dad were in the same room. But why was Stephen here, on tonight of all nights; on family dinner night? He wasn’t family. Steve had asked out loud and both Morgan and Peter shrugged when Tony had left to go meet Stephen.
Morgan had told Nathan exactly what Amelia had learned from her father; what Remy and Nat had was
Harley almost choked on his own spit when he processed Thor’s words.
Once in the adjoining room, Tony lay on the exam bed as his doctor set up the equipment. Tony lifted his shirt; the gel was added to his mid region and Dr McIntosh used the wand to search for the baby. They found the baby in seconds and Tony looked over at the monitor where the little blimp was projected. Tony sighed in defeat. He really was pregnant. He had a life growing inside him.
“I can never forget that. You always come first. All of you.”
Nathan had been spending his days at the Stark Mansion to comfort Morgan which left the Banner household rather quiet. Nat didn’t mind though, neither did Bruce. They’d stopped by a few times to check in on Morgan, but they know it was probably so overwhelming after losing a child. She probably needed space. She needed the comfort of her boyfriend and her parents.
He straightened up his room a bit, before a figure – all tall, pale-skinned, long jet-black hair and light green eyes – stood in his doorway. A simple green dress draped over her body. Nertha. She was a friend and one of the many girls that warmed his bed from time to time, whenever she visited him on campus. Sex with her was always great. There was literally something magical about it and Harley often jokingly called her the Goddess of Sex.
Steve:
Stephen was about to answer when Steve’s arrival caught both his and Tony’s attention. He too brought a gift for Tony, no doubt. Tony escaped Stephen’s hold and went to meet Steve.
There was a look of resentment written all over Steve’s face. Bucky had taken the water from his hands so he could be free to write but Steve never did. Bucky was a little frustrated. He wished Steve would just let Tony go. He wouldn’t have to worry about anything else. He and Sam would gladly take care of him. “You still love him, don’t you?”
“I’m such a big fan.” Justin lied and he saw Stephen’s interest grow in his eyes and his smile. “Yeah. I work over at the Margot Robbie building at the hospital. We love you over there.” Then Stephen was turning his entire body to face him, and Justin used that opportunity to sit one bar stool closer to him.
“Please marry me.” He finished, retrieving a box from his jacket’s pocket. Inside, as expected, was a ring. It made Tony think back to the day Steve proposed. It made him think of his rings from Steve. They were buried in a box somewhere. It made him think of Steve.
“She looks exactly like you.” Wade provided, reaching out to touch the streak of white in her hair. Anna stepped back not appreciating Wade being so forward.
Anyways, thank you to everyone that left kind words of encouragement. I really appreciate it.
“I intended to take this secret to my grave, but Remy LeBeau found out and he –” Natasha explained, sighing.
“When we were younger – before you moved in, Amelia had the world’s largest crush on Peter Quill. It was insatiable.” Torunn glanced at her and then back at Morgan as she continued. “I thought she’d finally gotten over that. I mean we were 10.”
Steve was surprised to see him. He managed a “hi” before Tony spoke again.
I'm always afraid I give things away but glad to know my subtly is still subtle. I've actually given away alot of plot points so far ✨
“Mom, how could you forgive Nat?” Morgan ceased her eating, her eyes fixed on his. She sounded just like Steve. Tony sighed.
I failed to mention:
As life went on at Stark Mansion, Anna quickly realized, she had a favourite parent. Steve. But it didn’t mean she didn’t enjoy time spent with her mother as well. In fact, she liked to joined Tony in his lab on days like today. They would converse as she watched him work, but she never took part. Technology wasn’t her forte. Tony was so used to bonding with his other three children over his work that it took him some time to refrain from always asking her if she wanted to take part.
(See the end of the chapter for
She picked up on the second ring and Harley appeared on a projected screen before her. Her
“I wanted to ask you for Dr McIntosh’s number.” Peter explained. Dr Kayla McIntosh was Tony’s primary doctor.
So Steve helped Tony back into his clothes, and he kissed him, letting Tony taste himself. “I missed you.” He whispered against his lips and Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. He was picked up bridal style and Steve walked them to the elevator. “I missed being inside you.” Steve said by his ear as they stepped into the elevator. Tony’s cock twitched and his hole clenched at his words. He missed having Steve inside him as well.
“Tony and Steve’s kids seem to have that effect on everyone.” Clint gestured to Lila in the yard who was now walking and talking with Nathan.
"What? He's Tony Stark. He owns a billion dollar company." Harley answered. "How do you not know that?"
Some of you WILL hate how this chapter ended and how IronStrange ended (my first draft of that scene actually ended violently but I decided against it. No need for violence...yet!) but this a STONY fic ladies & gents. Steve and Tony are ending up together ☺ one way or another. You knew this was coming.
“I’m keeping my name.” Tony informed him. “Well, I’m dropping Rogers.” He had to clarify. It had taken him over two years since the official divorce to even consider changing his name back. It was taking him getting married again to change it, otherwise, he’d be staying a Rogers. He’d be Tony Stark again. Not Tony Stark-Rogers anymore.
She stuttered for a moment. “Um. Yeah. Sure.” And he could see a hint of red, gracing her usually pale cheeks. She was blushing. Nertha Heladottir was blushing.
“Morgan –” Steve tried. Morgan cut him off, shaking her head in disbelief, turning away from him. Peter came to her comfort. He stared at his father in disgust. This was so unexpected. Aunt Nat was their favourite Aunt. She was family. How could she do this? How could
“Hey baby.” Tony called out, glancing at Stephen for only a second. “How was your day?”
“We’re supposed to be a family, Steve.”
Eventually she left the basement and found Harley in the kitchen having breakfast. He kissed her cheek when he saw her. “Hey. Where were you?” Harley asked, brushing her hair back and kissing her cheek again.
Natasha had brought him a little cupcake with a lit candle as soon as the sun was up that Saturday morning. She adored Nathan so much it was suffocating. It was understandable though. He was the closest thing in her life to a son and in the 3 and a half years she and Bruce had been together, Nathan had actually slipped up a few times and called her ‘Mom’.
“It’s for Bucky. I swear.” Sam lied as he stuffed some food in his mouth while walking away.
“Happy Anniversary.” He added. Had it really been a year since they made it official? Morgan found herself crying again. He sat the box down on her bed and she joined him there.
Lost in thought, the pot of spaghetti sauce started burning and sticking to the pot. Pepper caught on to it before Tony did and gestured to the pot. She then offered to come by with dinner since Amelia was going to be heading over there anyways to see Morgan. Tony accepted wholeheartedly, groaning that he’d need to toss out another pot. He was just always going to be a horrible cook.
Tony and Steve managed to patch things back up following the loss of their daughter. They consoled each other as they grieved. Tony had never fully forgiven Steve for his infidelity, but they needed each other more than ever after their loss.
“I know. I’m sorry Morguna. Think you want to...maybe...move back in?” He tried. He would love to keep his children close, together and where he could see them.
“Hey.” He began.
Steve always had a weakness for babies. His heart melted at all the pictures he took with William and he decided to send a few to Tony. Steve knew he would enjoy seeing them and he loved to make Tony happy.
“Why’d you leave me?” Peter questioned, rising his head up in hopes of seeing his face. He still had his mask on. Peter reached up and pulled it off revealing his scarred face. The mask fell from his hand and he cupped Wade’s face with both hands. His eyes met Peter’s and then closed as he pressed his lips to Wade’s. He didn’t react. He didn’t move. Peter struck his left cheek, smacking him easily. Wade cried out. His eyes flew open and he found Peter glaring at him. Wade was pleasantly turned on.
To say Tony was shocked would be an understatement.
“What?” It came out playful and extremely nonchalant. He didn’t believe that for a second. Tony thought it was a joke. It was a funny thing to say while at the appointment which was initially for an egg count test. Oh, the irony.
Maria brushed Morgan’s hair soothingly. Morgan seemed to visibly relax. “All this beautiful hair.” Morgan’s hair was always the darkest among her siblings. It tended to get darker as she got older. Almost like Tony’s, Maria realized. She had Morgan sit by her vanity as she attempted to beautify her granddaughter’s appearance. Looking good always helps in making one feel good. Tony let her try anything, anything to get the old Morgan back.
“Hey Morgan.” She greeted her kindly although very astounded to see Morgan in her home again when they hadn’t left things on good terms. “Nathan’s out with Levi.” Nat explained, because why else would she be here? Her other nephew, Jaime and niece, Ana had yet to arrive in New York and today Nathan was showing 14-year-old Levi around.
Kayla noticed and pointed in the direction of the adjoining bathroom as a reminder. Tony got up, ran towards it and hurriedly closed the door behind him once inside. He barely managed to keep the contents of his throw up in the toilet bowl. Afterwards he washed up at the sink and took a moment to stare at his reflection.
“Torunn found her snooping in your lab mom.” Harley supplied, wishing he was spending time with her instead of whatever this was.
Tony was fixing himself a plate when Morgan and Peter entered the kitchen, that Saturday morning. “Morning guys.”
It was painfully awkward when Tony retreated to the kitchen to get Stephen a plate. Steve spoke up first, merely grumbling under his breath. “I thought this was a family dinner.”
“Spider man, Mom...” Peter whined.
“I was wrong and I’m sorry Tony. Sorry for letting someone else in when I should have been focusing all my energy on trying to win you back. I should have never given up on us when I knew I was innocent. I’m still so sorry.”
“No. Tony I swear to you.” Steve whispered, turning him around so he could see him. He had tears in his eyes. “I don’t know what happened or what I was thinking.” Tony shook his head. How many times were they going to say this lie? “I never wanted to bring this up because it meant nothing.” He glared at Natasha.
“Gosh. I love you so much.” He stated, punctuating each word with an upwards thrust and he flipped Tony over, so he was on top. Tony whimpered and Steve attacked his neck, his hands gripping his ivory skin so hard, Tony could feel marks forming. Moments later and Steve flipped them over again, so Tony was under him, with his legs open and seductively inviting. He was now better able to slam into Tony and cherish the deepness and warmth of the man around his erection. More groans and moans followed, and Steve finished inside Tony as they shared another kiss.
Carol Danvers-Rhodes arrived on the 4th floor of the Avengers Compound’s main building; except it wasn’t called the Avengers Compound anymore. It was Tony’s and once upon a time, Steve’s family home. The entire compound was remodeled into a large home with a large lawn for Tony and the kids. The only thing that stayed the same from the good old Avengers days was all the suits of the now retired avengers sitting in showcases in the basement. Risking their lives every day to save the world wasn’t easy and after all was said and done, everyone decided to settle down with their families and for once, just lived for themselves. Avenging put their kids in danger every day.
“I’m your boyfriend?” Peter wondered; his face was red again. “Thought we weren’t labelling it…”
Steve kissed him after and let Tony taste himself for the second time that night. Tony’s face turned red, sobs now leaving his mouth when Steve sped up his pace and his cock rubbed against his sensitive spot again
It was too graphic of an image and Tony didn’t want to imagine it. It made him shiver. “Oh god.” He mumbled and then he took a deep breath and walked away from Harley and Steve before joining Wade and Peter. Wade needed to be at arms-length. The thoughts of him being with Peter frightened him. He was regretting trusting.

It’s a comforting thought. She could live with that and Morgan was surprised to know that she felt a bit better after her grandmother’s comforting words. Maria finished styling her hair by adding a white lily. It was Morgan’s favourite flower. “See,” she turned the chair to face the mirror again. “My beautiful granddaughter, Morgan Marie Stark Rogers.”
Wade:
“Sounds kind of shallow.” Jaime noted, watching her create a username for him.
Peter screamed, jumping out of the way and unto the ceiling as the door and its surrounding walls exploded. He had walked in without looking up from his phone, hoping to hang out with his twin. He was startled out of his mind by the blast but more so by the sight of Remy LeBeau pulling away from his sister, dressing himself quickly and leaving the room even faster.
“And you always bring him up.” Stephen interrupted him. Tony got a little perplexed at his statement until he realized Stephen’s intoxicated mind must be muddling things, having him interpret his name as Steve’s.
“You said, you’d get rid of it.” Tony said in hushed tones; Anna and Peter's party still going on nearby.
“I know Morgan. But I also know that you’re going to get pass this.” Harley provided. Morgan looked up into the same blue eyes she saw looking back at her in the mirror every day.
“I didn’t know.” He hesitated. “Congratulations.” He mumbled before walking away from her.
On the other side of the bathroom door, Morgan sat on the toilet, her shorts and underwear pooling at her feet as she stared at the plastic stick in her hand.
Just then, Wade burst out into laughter. “I’m kidding.”
birthday. Steve watched his son enjoy his birthday party with his friends. This Wade Wilson guy hadn’t showed up yet and Steve was okay with that. He was enjoying his son’s party until Stephen Strange made an appearance. Lucky for Stephen – because Steve wasn’t opposed to breaking his nose again – all Stephen had done was hand Tony a gift which he presumed was for Peter at the glass doors then he was on his way until his eyes met Steve’s. So, he put on a show of making out with Tony inappropriately and groping his ass. He smirked at Steve before leaving and he found a blushing Tony when he headed back into the party. Steve scoffed.
Pepper seemed okay as were Nicky and Morgan. Morgan was sitting by Tony’s side on the bench. Nicky was sitting comfortably on Pepper’s lap. Steve approached them and Nicky spotted him before making grabby-hands towards him. “Mommy!”
After a moment, he got up and helped her with the bags. “You scared me half to death!” Justin took the bags to the kitchen and Sharon followed with what she had left. She began putting things away and Justin leant on her kitchen counter watching her do so.
They were having dinner together, Nathan and Morgan out of the house, when Natasha spoke up. “I got the cutest text from Jaime today.” Her nephew was going to be spending his entire summer with them and he was clearly very excited about it. Bruce and Natasha didn’t have a problem with it. With Nathan moving out by the end of the month, they welcomed the idea of having another teenager under their roof that they could care for. Tanya Romanov-Kozlov knew her children were always welcome in her sister’s home and they loved the Aunt Natasha just as much.
“It’s whatever. I’m just going to go.” Morgan pulled out her chair, rushing to her room; her hand covering her mouth. Steve called out to her and was ready to go after her when Tony asked him and Stephen to leave.
Outside on the balcony, Steve initiated their conversation. “I don’t like you. I don’t like you
“Right.”
Sharon had surprise and embarrassment written all over her face. “Please don’t be so hostile.” Both her hands were cradling her bump at this point. “It’s not good for the baby.” Tony scoffed. She was using this baby like a shield. “We’re all going to be a family soon. We should at least try to get along for the baby’s sake.”
“But this is still a mediocre party.” She teased him. Harley chuckled, humming in agreement. “My first coronation is in the following month, for my 18th name day – birthday.” She corrected herself, remembering she wasn’t on Asgard. “You must come.” It was the first of many coronations that came with being future ruler of Asgard. No outsiders had ever been in attendance in the past, but this was another thing Thor had changed when he became King.
Peter mindlessly reached for his phone, struggling to find his dad’s number.
“Bucky is a good person. He loves you and he’d never cheat on you unless he was tricked into it.” And Sam understand her blatant reference to Justin Hammer’s cruelty.
Until then, Tony and Steve were more than happy to have them stay in one of the guest houses on their property.
“It takes time that’s for sure but don’t hinder the process any longer. Talk to your father, let him know how you feel and try to move on.”
“Days?” he asked in disbelief, “Harls, Bruce and I’ve been scratching our heads about this for weeks.” Harley was far smarter than people gave him credit for as people thought the only thing, he got from Tony was his old playboy behaviour with his constant change of sexual partners.
“I brought condoms.” She responded as if she’d read his mind. “Just consider this a second birthday present,” she finished, leaning back down to kiss him. And Nathan was gone too. Of course, she’d plan this; like everything else in her life.
. Plural.”
“Fury is getting dead end, after dead end and it’s been two months. Whoever did this, is really good.” Carol informed her.
. No one wanted to address the fact that their family was scattered, broken into fragments.
“They don’t like me.” Stephen concluded after a while. Tony stayed silent. “Neither does your mother.” Maria still hadn’t warmed up to him even after being properly introduced by Tony. So, yes; everything he said was all very true but Tony wasn’t going to say that to him. “She said several times that you don’t date doctors. Can I ask what that’s about?” Stephen added.
“Careful or you’re going to burn a hole through Strange’s head,” Natasha remarked sneaking up on him, like the spy she was. Steve didn’t realize he was glaring.
Steve sighed, scrolling up to look at all the messages he had sent to Tony in the past few weeks since the incident at the lake that were never answered.
“I don’t know…” Sam sighed. “But what about that M’Baku guy?” he interrogated further. “I see the way
“You need to put an end to this Nertha.” He sneered.
“Harls.” Jacob called out. Harley was raiding his mini fridge.
Tony would beg to differ. He had a file on Remy LeBeau. One he never cared to compile until he learned from Steve, how actively involved he was with their daughter. Tony gagged at the thought and reached for his glass of water before he started choking. He absolutely hated Remy LeBeau. He was another older man trying to get in the pants of one of his underage kids. Except that he had succeeded, long before he and Steve even knew Anna was still out there in the world and this was a killer with hundreds of kills on his resume.
Then he turned back to Tony. "I'll sign a prenup if it makes everyone feel better." He assured him.
“Oh yeah.” The bartender, his name tag said Gary responded as rehearsed. “The Mrs. is pregnant again.”
, Peter had suggested.
Tony got up and began walking away from them.
Back at her place, Pepper turned to Carol who was wrapped in a blanket on her couch. Carol was grateful to her for not ratting her out to Rhodey.
“Just the fight and that he’s the one who poisoned me.” They made it to his bedroom, sat Tony on the bed and started the removal of his clothes. Tony stopped his hands, letting him know he could handle it himself. Stephen complied, giving him some space. Tony let out a whimper every now and then.
Chapter 28: Flesh and Blood
Sam tried to justify his actions by firing his acquisitions at him. “You went to Wakanda and came back pregnant and I knew you and T’challa were – are close.” He corrected himself, recalling the last time he had seen them together; the Christmas party – closer than ever and enjoying each other’s company a little too much for his liking. “I just needed to be sure.” Sam explained because he believed that was more than enough reason for him to doubt paternity. Winter came out of nowhere.
Sharon held her voice for a second, before whispering. “My Aunt Peggy passed away…” he could hear her quiet sobs.
“Hey.” She hugged her brother. “Where’s everybody?” She asked. She only knew that Torunn was visiting Harley at MIT but nothing about anyone else.
He turned off the water, searching almost blindly for a towel when Tony caught his face in his hands and flicked the water on his eyelids away. “I chose you Stephen.” He iterated. Tony’s eyes stayed on his.
Tony ignored that. “I don't want you seeing Wade anymore. And Wade, you need to stay away from my son. Or I will take matters into my own hands.” He headed towards the bar in the living room and got himself a drink.
Maria was surprised. She pulled her hand away. “Oh no. You must be mistaken. My Tony doesn’t date doctors. Pleased to meet you though. Excuse us.” She turned her attention back to Steve and started speaking in softer tones. Steve led her away after a moment, smirking back at Stephen. This was one Stark he wouldn’t be winning over anytime soon. He wasn’t family and Maria knew it. Now if he could keep the kids on his side maybe there was still some hope left.
Tony was joined by Steve on one of their home’s back balconies. The air was warm but bearable and Tony was enjoying it. Steve held him at the waist from behind, rubbing circles on Tony’s bump. He then reached around to press kisses to his cheeks as Tony complained about something. Typical for the start of the 2nd trimester.
Steve remembered the words clearly. He had attended the trial. “Mr. Stark is mentally ill. He’ll be put in a mental health facility until further notice.”
“Really.” Tony provided, grinning at his younger son. Then he and Steve looked around the room gauging the other three’s reactions.
. Luckily the name wasn’t taken.
“I didn’t.” She sighed. “Like I said, Fury had me go on a mission. You can ask him yourself Bruce.” She swore and he hugged her because he
business.” He punctuated his words with a slight raise of his voice. “You lost that right the day you decided to stick your dick in someone that wasn’t me.”
He pulled down the shirt quickly, seeing a hint of his belly still peeking out from underneath despite it being a larger size. He was really swelling up. He wondered if Steve still found him atractive.
It’s just that he and Peter had always had a good relationship being his last baby and he needed someone to tell him he was right. And it couldn’t be Steve because he hadn’t mentioned any of this to him. It wouldn’t go over well with Steve and besides, he had handled it already. The situation was non-existent at this point.
more than his husband, at the time in any case. Tony took a moment, to compose himself. This always made him emotional. No matter how much he swore he was over it. “It just wouldn’t do me any good to hold on to that hatred.”
Tony stopped him, before he walked off to his side of the walk-in closet. “I told you, Stephen. I’m going with Steve.” Stephen’s face hardened and Tony gave a half smile. “If it’s really her, she just needs her parents right now.”
“Well.” Morgan spoke up. “No one said
"Dad." Peter finally spoke up, the younger of his two sons. "Are you sure about this? Harley said you said the same thing about my pops." Harley was only 6 at the time but he remembered meeting Peter's pops when he was already pregnant with him.
Tony cleared his throat and lied. Easily. “I was just flying around.” He took the nanotech arc reactor off his chest to punctuate his point. He placed it on the nightstand by his bed. “I hadn’t done that in years and I wanted to clear my head.” And he sank back onto his pillow, pulling the covers up to his naked shoulders.
Nertha initially assumed he was mocking or teasing her but one look at his face and she could see his genuineness. She almost thanked him but that would be a little too out of character for her. Instead she settled with something else, aiming to mess with his head.
He pulled out a moment later, feeling Tony’s hole leaking with his cum and soaking the bed. Tony curled up into his side and Steve pulled him closer. They remained silent for some time, listening to each other’s breaths settle. “Tony.” Steve whispered.
“I won’t. I can’t take watching you from a far anymore. Not again.”
“Our kids.” Tony popped the bubble whilst releasing his hand. Steve eyes opened and they both stared at the sliver of morning light that slipped under the many layers of sheet. “I feel like we rarely, if ever, see them.” He squirmed a bit, getting more and more comfortable in Steve’s embrace. Steve was budding an erection with Tony’s bare ass rubbing against his cock.
“More than made up.” Amelia confirmed, running her fingers throw her boyfriend’s head of brown curls. Jacob groaned.
– Bucky’s son with his brown hair, ivory skin and Steve’s blue eyes.
“You know. You’re right. Very Captain America-esque. Should have guessed.” Tony agreed, sending a pic of the banner to Pepper. She oversaw all this fun stuff. Peter was quiet. Tony spoke up. “So you’re talking to me again?” He stared at his son; arms folded over his chest.
“So where is my favorite nephew?” Loki began and soon remembered the child in Sif’s womb. He stooped down and spoke to Sif’s belly. “No offense. You’re not born yet.” The nephew he was in pursuit of had actually been missing from the party for some time now. Tony and Steve had unwillingly allowed Loki to babysit Peter, Morgan and Harley several times in the past and Peter had quickly become his favorite.
“Your sister doesn’t want to go to college. Wonder where she got that idea.” Tony said, before exiting the room to finish setting up the dining table with his mother. He asked Peter to join him solely so Anna and Morgan could talk.
“Well I guess we’re having martinis," and she poured four glasses. Maria carried two of the glasses to the living room where Peggy and Howard were and Steve followed close behind with the other two.
Torunn thought it was strange, she couldn't get in; Harley wouldn’t keep her locked out. She tried the code again and it failed once again. There was no way she could get in without one of the Stark-Rogers present, instead she questioned Friday about who was inside.
Harley, Torunn realized. Wherever he was, Nertha was somewhere close by. “And Uncle Loki?” Torunn continued noticing her favorite and only Uncle was nowhere in sight.
Morgan could feel the hint of a smile forming on her lips. Maria loved Tony so much. There wasn’t a doubt. After all her pain and sorrow, she had got her baby in the end.
Anna glared at him, opening her mouth to counter his words but her grandmother Maria appeared from her left, guiding her back to the party. She glanced back at him and Remy smirked, finally leaving the party.
“February. That night we went out with Buck…I didn’t mean for any of this to happen Tony. I’m so so sorry,” Steve supplied, reaching out for him. He looked apologetic. He sounded apologetic but if he hadn’t meant for any of it to happen, why they hell did he do it in the first place? Steve could see more tears welling up in his eyes.
month. It was getting harder to do everything by himself. Bucky noticed that and started to spend more time at Steve’s house so he could help out. He intends to move in with Steve once he gets closer to his due date. And Sam, who has grown attached to Bucky wants to tag along like a lost puppy. Steve was against the idea when Bucky first brought it up because he didn’t want his friends, to uproot their lives just to move into his tiny apartment with him. Bucky said it would only be for a few months. Just long enough for him to figure out this parenting thing and Steve couldn’t complain.
“Can I come in?” Tony gestured to the dark interior of his apartment.
Nathan and Morgan sat on the other sofa across from them. Morgan was biting her lip and pleading with her eyes for Nathan to come out and say it. The silence was going to eat them up. Tony had to know, what was going on.
“He asked me if I still loved you.” Tony paused. “I couldn’t lie.” He informed him and Steve let out a half-smile. He already knew that, but he also knew that couldn’t be a good thing to hear on Stephen’s part. Still, Tony continued. “So, I decided to end it. I wasn’t happy.”
“I just don’t want to see her like that,” he confessed.
“I’m sorry for doubting you.” Tony sniffled. He’d been silently crying with each revelation he made.
“We’ve been together for almost 4 years. We haven’t failed yet.” Bruce reminded her. It wouldn’t be the worst thing if they got married. He just didn’t understand why Nat would associate marriage with divorce.
floor where the large Christmas tree was surrounded by gifts, in a separate room from when the party was kept last night. Tony’s hired cleaning crew was already busying cleaning. Everyone exchanged gifts. Loki gloated about having the best gifts for everyone. Peter agreed. Harley found Torunn and handed her a gift. “Here you go, Princess.”
“Mom.” Peter’s voice poured into the room though the overhead speakers. “Do you have a minute to talk?” Tony halted his movements and stared in the direction of the door. Steve decided to take over, jolting up and bringing Tony’s attention back to him.
Sam had grabbed one too many plates and Tony had caught wind of it. “Sam that’s for the mothers.” He lectured.
Steve sighed. He was avoiding Tony because he couldn’t stand to see him with Stephen Strange and he fell into depression. “I knew you were okay, the kids told me.” He said it nonchalantly, trying to put on a brave face. “And I figured you were happy with your new fiancée. Tony Strange.” Steve spat, staring at the ring on Tony’s finger.
Nertha knew if they told Thor, it would nip Hela in the butt.
“I know you’re not my sister.” Morgan fired at her, not faltering in her quest for answers.
Tony stepped out of the way so Steve could get to the elevator. “Good night Steve.”
“I forgot that Stephen and I had a date tonight. Just been so busy…” Tony was rambling, “Anyways. Thought I’d kill two birds with one stone.”
Steve shook his head at that. Harley had the tendency to “date” outside of his age group quite often; sometimes younger and sometimes older. Tony didn’t like. Steve hated it the most. But he wasn’t a kid anymore. He’d do whatever he wanted to, like he usually did. Harley was always the wild child. “That’s not the point. You just ruined that girl’s innocence.”
“Fury says two people got into SHIELD the night Hammer was killed.” Tony explained, peering down at his phone as he sat in bed, waiting for Stephen to join him. Fury had been keeping him and Steve informed about the investigation. They were still at risk - in danger. It was hard for him to sleep at nights knowing someone else was out there trying to hurt him and there was nothing he could do about. “That’s one more person than I thought a month ago that still has it out for me and Steve.” He shouted in the direction of the bathroom.
“Too formal?” Stephen thought out loud, taking his own seat opposite Tony. There was already a bottle of wine on the table and Stephen was pouring them each a glass.
She wanted her siblings' 18
Deep in thought, Steve came back downstairs, blindfold in hand and completely topless. Steve’s body was just a work of art and Tony didn’t know how he managed to get him in his bed. He stayed quiet, watching him sit on the sofa with him again and putting the blindfold on.
Steve walked in, through the clearly unlocked door and successfully interrupted their conversation. The couple pulled apart quickly, wishing one of them had at least bothered to ensure the door was actually locked, before divulging into their previous plans. Steve must have heard it all, but Anna only panicked for a minute and gracefully, composed herself as she watched her father manually locked her room door, without Friday’s assistance.
Wasn't too fond of this chapter but thank you so much to all who read and comment. Comments are always nice to read 💛💙❤
“Who else knows?”
Thank you for reading. If you liked it, what was your favourite part?
Torunn stood on the front lawn of the Stark Mansion, with two of Tony’s hired housekeepers standing close behind her. Tony didn’t believe in having
So a couple of things happened. A couple of things are being foreshadowed 😉
Stephen drew him closer once again, enveloping him in another hug. “We could go right now,” he breathed. It wouldn’t be a problem if they did. He just needed a few minutes.
Harley’s door was unlocked, which was odd but he let that slide. “Harls,” Steve began before he got an eyeful of a half-naked Lila Barton. She was struggling to wrap the sheet around her leaving a still sleeping Harley completely naked. The commotion woke him up and he grabbed a pillow to cover himself when he saw his father. He realized that someone hadn’t locked the door behind them last night.
Jacob sighed. “Whatever.” Amelia was laughing uncontrollably at this point. “What’s got you so distracted anyways?”
It had been 3 weeks since anyone had last seen Tony or Nicky. Steve was facing deep depression. He had only 3 days with his son. His nipples ached because they were so full of milk and Nicky wasn't there to suckle from them. Bucky helped him pump as often as he could. Pepper almost never left Steve’s side and she had people out there looking for Nicky. It was another deadend in finding Tony or Nicky when a stranger popped up at Steve's house. A guy in a suit.
Steve got down to his level, trying to help him up and calm him. He shot daggers at Nat. He had asked her not to mention anything to Tony. They could have avoided this. He didn’t want to be held responsible if anything happened to the twins. Now wasn’t the right time. This couldn’t be good for the twins.
“I’ll stop by his place after we’re done here.” Morgan promised. Steve would be happy to see his favourite child. Anna figured that out in record time.
“Tony.” He said, a frown marring his face as he stooped down and grabbed the vitamins. He examined the bottle and his frown deepened with obvious sadness. “You wasted no time.”
“Bye Petey,” he offered before he made his way to the elevator, smiling sadly at Peter before the doors closed. Peter wanted to cry. He wanted to shout. He wanted to defy his mother. He wanted to make him angry because why couldn’t he just trust and believe him. Trust him and believe that nothing was going on.
“The boy is out.” The doctor shouted, placing the baby on Tony’s chest. Peter. Steve cut the umbilical cord while Peter screamed and flayed around looking for warmth and comfort. Tony kept him wrapped in the blanket, moving some of the gunk out of his face and brown hair. His little eyes weren’t open yet. Not long after the doctors took Peter and weighed, measured and cleaned him off among other things before placing him in a transparent hospital bassinet. Steve only left Tony’s side momentarily to be with Peter, talking to him.
