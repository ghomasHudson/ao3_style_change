“I appreciate that.” Satisfied with the rather outrageous hickey he’d created on Dean’s neck, Cas pressed it with one last kiss. “How’d you know I was behind you?” he asked, pressing their foreheads together and slowly grinding their hips together lazily, just breathing Dean in.
"Daddy!" Dean wept.
"Wait, what?" Sam asked, looking confused.
“Then why suggest my leaving at all? I understand,” Cas said softly, as if realizing something, “if my being here is too much.” He paused for a moment, then continued on, saying: “If you don’t want me here, I’ll go.”
And that’s true. Dean knows that whatever his ending was- heroic, pointless, depressing, ridiculous- it was too soon. But what’s done is done.
As the skin merged into a puckered, raw-looking pink scar, Cas dropped his hand away from the wound and found himself utterly breathless, gasping for air and drained.
As he finished pulling the blankets up around his chin, how he liked them, Cas sat on the edge of the bed next to him, making the mattress dip down towards him with his weight.
"Just. I don't know, take your shoes off, yeah?" Dean instructed with an uncomfortable smile, trying to mask his nervousness. "I know you're all next-to-godliness clean or whatever but I gotta draw a line somewhere, and shoes in bed? Pshhh. Big no-no."
"Sounds good to me," Sam said, rising and walking over to the sink with his now-empty salad bowl. "I'm happy for you guys, I am, and I'd love to talk more over the next couple weeks, but I'm exhausted." He yawned and stretched, punctuating the statement. "I'm going to bed. I'll call Charlie in the morning to set something up."
Third, it reaches an arm of the same oily substance that swallowed Billie out at Cas.
And so on.
"Buddy," Dean said, basking in the heat of chocolate-and-whiskey-induced bliss, "you got more than lucky. This is
"I wish I could say it was because of a perfect ending,” Cas begins softly. “I know humans wish for that, that sort of an absolution, or resolution, tying up loose ends, everyone getting what they deserve. I wish I was happy to see you, I do. But I’m not, Dean-
“Jack?”
"What do you mean why?" Dean asked. "That's just how it is."
“No, don’t,” Jack says. He’s gone as white as a sheet. “I know what it is. I think.”
"You what?" he asks, horrified.
i hate the henry winchester storyline sooooo i gave millie a second husband it doesn't change canon that much and it's spicy. tw for past child abuse and depictions of alcohol abuse/discussions of alcoholism in this chapter. this chapter got absurdly long, so i've broken it up into two parts to make it easier to read. the first part is what was posted today, and the second half will go up on sunday
Dean cleared his throat "Ok, yeah, Cas. Whatever you want." He looked back at Kelly-Ann. "Where do we sign? Let's get this show on the road."
"You keep making that face, Sam, it'll stick that way," Dean pointed out.
"You do that," Dean said. "Wait, and the bathtub, yeah?"
But Cas didn't even turn to look at him, didn't question it, just kept looking out the window and looking at the wildflowers they flew past. The last notes of "The Rain Song" faded out, and Cas sighed happily, pushing off the window and leaning back into his seat. "It's such a beautiful song," he said musingly. "Spring, love- both persevere through winter and hard times. Love and spring are inevitable, in every universe. Sadness, grief, winter, rain- they make love stronger, and the seasons more beautiful. It's an apt metaphor, if a bit overused."
Sam gave in to the moment, unable to keep silent any longer. "Dude. Was that what I think it was?"
"Millie, what happened?" he asked, unstrapping Sam and hoisting him onto his hip. "Shit, his bib-" He set Sammy back in the seat for a moment and tossed the dirty green dinosaur bib onto the table before picking him up again.
He lifted his head to meet Castiel’s eyes in a pose of supplication, his knees aching, his eyes burning with tears as the situation started to overwhelm him. “I want to be forgiven,” he gasped out. “Cas, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please forgive us.”
Sam proceeded to lose his mind laughing. "Yeah, Dean," he sniped. "Don't be rude on my
They drove another fourteen miles, past two exits, and saw just three other cars- two junker trucks, and a sleek little blue Prius. Cas would probably love a little eco-friendly car like that. Sure, they were hideous, but they were basically everything Cas stood for, and they did save a lot on gas. Maybe, once they moved, it would be a good thing to have two cars- Baby for special occasions and for the very rare hunts they might pitch in on, someday, and a car like the one they just saw for everyday things. It seemed inordinately extravagant, but damn if it wasn't kind of appealing as ideas went. A little car they could beat the hell out of and drive into the ground, and not have to worry about the special maintenance Baby needed.
Anyway, it wasn’t like they had much of a choice about anything these days. Once Michael had taken Adam, they lost their only trump card. Heaven didn’t need Dean anymore, but Hell desperately needed Sam. It was a shame, it really was, that Sam’s gamble hadn’t paid off.
Dean didn't respond. He'd fallen unconscious.
“Sounds easy enough.”
I'm making up a new ending here- I hope you enjoyed this little offering! The first real plot chapter will be up soon.  Expect around 8-9 chapters after this. Thanks for reading!
“Cas, I swore my obedience to Heaven, once. To God, and his angels. To you,” his voice cracked as he risked a glance at the former angel. His eyes were like fire. Glowing.
Cas squinted at him for a moment. "Yes, I think I will," he declared. "But we will not be able to plant them until next weekend when we move in, so you'll have to dig the UV lights out of storage."
But here he was, forty-two years old, and getting ready to play house with a bona-fide capital-A Angel.
"It wouldn't be a waste, Dean. You need help, I want to help you. It's that simple," Cas said. "Unless this is you worrying about
Cas kisses his forehead, his temples, his jawline. “No,” he says, with that voice like a purring engine.
the eerie part, I’d say.”
He’s horizontal, laid out like a corpse in his own bed (he’d know that memory foam anywhere)
“Stop.”
The assembled heads -- large, small, high, low, fleshy, hairy, all sorts -- have already turned to regard the commotion with interest, and from what Cas can make out of the expressions behind their masks, no one is particularly
He aims it back at where he’d seen the shadow and confirms the shape of a bottle – and not one of those gross jar-like sample containers either, almost definitely the kind of bottle you’d use for a beverage. Maybe an alcoholic one. Perhaps even an expensive, aged alcoholic one? He can't help getting his hopes up as he approaches. If the bunker were to surrender something like that (just in time for Christmas, no less) he might feel a little more forgiving about the maintenance.
The timeless night feels as if it’s
Dean’s nose crinkles as a wave of something powdery and sour hits it. “The hell’s that smell?”
Eventually, the night reaches its zenith. At the end of the countdown, on the stroke of midnight, surrounded by cheers of
Cas looked up from his phone with a pleased expression when Dean walked in. "Teams mini golf?" he queried, sounding incredibly amused.
"Cas-"
"Happy birthday, Sam," Cas said solemnly, drawing his legs in closer to himself and watching as he shredded the wrapping paper.
Cas touched his shoulder and he leapt to the side, startled, and knocked one of the dirty yellow bowls to the floor, shattering it.
his mental voice trailed off for a second into indistinct sounds, colors, and waves of pain.
even knows. The question sticks in Dean’s throat and leaves a lump in its wake. He thinks he might be crying soon, too.
"I don't want to take advantage, Dean-"
Could he- could he have this?
"Doing what?" Dean asked sarcastically. "Cataloguing?"
“And?” Sam asks, his heart sinking.
Okay, that's new.
"Oh, my god, Dean," Sam said, exasperated. "Cas. Coming out of your room at 7;00 am and telling me he spent the night in here. That doesn't seem like something we should, I don't know,
Dean slid his hand forward, let his thumb rest teasingly at the corner of his lips, and holy

cook like this."
a nasty little voice asked in Dean's head, conjuring up every time he so much as looked at a man when it was of his own accord, when he wasn't cruising for a john or trying to hustle somebody, every time he noticed a smile, a jaw, broad shoulders, narrow hips and thickly muscled thighs without so much as a drink in him to smooth the way and ease the guilt that was bound to follow when he couldn't tear his eyes away from a
"Does this look right to you?" Jack thrust the phone in Dean's face, a drawing of a fish that admittedly greatly resembled theirs already loaded on the screen.
"Wait, Daddy-" Dean said, running down the stairs and reaching for his Dad as he walked past him. He was brushed off roughly without so much as a glance and landed heavily on the hardwood.
"I don't think you'll need to worry about the dog, Sam. Dean and I are going to purchase a house nearby soon as well," Cas said, and drained his mug. "We're going to raise some bees."
“Angels?” Sam asks.
John froze. "Better?" he said softly, dangerously. "Better? I'm his fucking father. I'm all he's going to get."
"This discussion is pointless," Cas said tonelessly. "I respect your concerns, and they are not without merit, but you will not change my mind. Listen, I-" his voice broke, the emotionless façade cracking open again. "I
." He stopped for a second, emotion stopping up the words. "I never thought I could be this happy. I never thought I could have this- this real, weird,
Cas merely nodded.
"Holden used to remind me of you," Cas said. "Much of his better qualities- his bond with his sister, his particular sense of humor, his resilience- he shares with you, still. Once I saw a great deal of his anger, his hopeless nihilism, his innate need to rebel and carve out his own space in you too. Not so much anymore, though. You've changed, in the years I've known you. Holden still lives in your past, but I prefer the man you are now, and the man you will be, to who you were in the 'then'."
"You did a good job, Cas. With this fabric splint from your coat-"
Cas took pity on Dean's rambling semi-apology and smoothly interjected, holding his phone out: "Here, Sam, I made an album with the pictures Dean and I took so we could plan for furniture, wall-painting and the like."
"Cas," Dean wheezed, lifting his head laboriously to meet his eyes, blood bubbling up between his lips and staining them. "Cas, I'm so sorry-"
No thunder accompanied their exit as it had their entrance. They were simply there one second, and gone the next, with no trace of having been there at all, except for-
He tried to pull his leg up along the mattress closer to his body and his back twinged, so he rolled over and stretched, arching his back and pulling on his arms with a little breathy grunting noise. He felt the muscles and sinew start to loosen out from their sleep-stiff setting and give way so he let go of the stretch, falling back against the pillow gratefully.
"Coffee?" came Sam's voice, at least two octaves too high to be even remotely close to the realm of normal. "I- Cas? Did you just come out of Dean's room?"
And Dean thinks he knows, now. "Why does this sound like a goodbye?" he asks, dreading Cas's answer because they are on some precipice now that there is no coming back from once they jump, and he can't take it anymore.
He leaned up against the door, his head propped up against his arm so he could look out the window as Cas set them on the way home. The sun had started set, and it was golden hour in the spring. That is to say, entirely too beautiful- ethereal and ecstatic, melancholy and mysterious by turns. On and on the horizon stretched before them, an endless smattering of puffy white and peachy clouds set into bluest-blue.
Besides, no matter what mess the world is in, they still have the burning to do. It's taken this long just to get a moment that Sam can be dragged away from the monitors long enough to accomplish the task. Even Rowena stops short when she follows Dean into the-room-that-was-Cas', all her jokes and protestations silenced beneath the weight of two gigantic, dead, angel wings. Later, Dean will think about the look on her face, standing in the doorway, and he’ll pinpoint this moment as the one where it all sinks in for her, when she internally commits to being an honorary Winchester, to doing what little she can, here at the end of everything.
around here these days.
Early on, Dean made a couple of abortive attempts to coax Sam into the car, to do
That is essentially what Sam means to do for himself when he switches over from researching Abaddon (dismal) to researching the thing in Wishek (hopefully less so.)
ready for a regular, normal alcoholic beverage.” He turns to Cas, then, and softly asks, “How about you?”
Dean rolls his eyes, a green movement through the holes in the mask. “‘Course you do.”
It was a voice. A decidedly human-sounding voice, moderately deep - a man's voice, certainly. It was far away at first, but singing very clearly, so that even at a distance Castiel could make out the words to the song.
spirit
for the sake of drama too?
“Dude, you’re practically in the backyard. Why don’t you just bring Cas home? We can take him along on something together, after he gets settled in.”
“Sunset hasn’t quite finished,” Castiel points out. “Maybe something happens then.”
In the quiet of the concrete walls, all they hear is their breath, and the distant sound of the water pumps linked to the pipes.
in his room, so they’ll be drinking right from the bottle, but he’s confident that won’t be a problem.
would be the understatement of the century,” he says, before his hand wanders further inward.
“So, why?” Castiel trailed off.
Castiel uses it. It matches his prior brushes with Greek gods, especially the minor ones -- in his minimal experience he’s found they love nothing more than themselves. “Notus, the wind of autumn, and Boreas, the wind of winter.” He squints in the spillover gusts. “You aren’t… usually in the same place at the same time, are you?”
With significant effort, he gets to his feet and turns.
“Sam,” Dean warns.
etcetera. For some reason, he didn’t want the man – Dean – to see him that way. “The Goblins I’d heard of, but never seen. The… pets, though…” Castiel glanced backward with a shudder.
“Sam, look there—” Dean points back the way they came. “Do you see my footprints?”
at all, but glass, or maybe crystal. The moonlight off the branches is mesmerizing.
One tall metal locker down, six to go.
That was the last thing Dean saw without the veil of dirty green-gray water in front of his eyes. He took a deep breath.
He’s got
The water rippled in a growing wind. Dean had just a second this time before he was submerged again.
The men who stand on either side of Dean (clearly the attackers) seem to be twins, identical in their height (tall) and build (wiry) and wearing masks that reveal enough of their fair faces to show that those are the same too.
Dean lifted himself experimentally into a sitting position, and caught Naomi doing the same a little ways away. Cas must have fixed her too, somehow.
“But if, for some reason, there
Dean’s response doesn’t entirely reveal whether he knew what they were, but Castiel thinks he probably didn’t.
the foul thing.
Today, he surreptitiously replaces his own face with a field of lavender.
A god approaches Pomona, his skin striped with shades of tea and maroon. His posture is kind, and he offers her a clay cup, which she takes with gratitude. A sense of
sleep. No nightmares, no monsters, no grief could follow him into a sleep like that. And he craved that sort of sleep with every bone in his body, engrained there by habit and fear for the things he knew still lived in his mind in spite of the years and distance that separated them from the 'now'. Nothing was stopping him, technically. He was an adult, after all, and he could make his own choices. But still, a strange sense of shame followed in the mornings he gave in to the siren song of the bottle, as if the others looked at him and knew. Not only knew about this ridiculous need, this weakness in his being, but judged him for it. Or pitied him.
Cas stripped with efficiency and redressed in much the same manner, tugging on an old, faded Doors t-shirt. He held up a pair of sweatpants, a question plain on his face but Dean shook his head.
Cas looked at him, a strange, discerning look in his eyes, and Dean was suddenly acutely aware of the fact that he was an angel, and he was definitely looking at his soul. Somehow, Dean didn't mind. It felt right, even if it was all scary-tingly-intense. Then Cas smiled softly, and the feeling went away, mostly. Everything still felt right- except for one thing.
Dean's sudden prayer hit him like a sledgehammer to the gut.
“We need to be prepared for the worst,” Sam says, tense and rubbing his hands through his hair. “The people in town, on the road- they’re all gone. You saw it too. We have to be ready-” he pauses, working around the sudden lump in his throat. “Dean, and Cas… they’re probably gone too.”
Dean was still laughing to himself all the way back to his room. Sam was so easy to rile up, sometimes. Especially when it came to women. Dean flipped on the lights in his room and made an executive decision: sweatpants and robe, stat.
"What, honey?"
The whiskey in his hand held the same appeal now as it did a few moments ago when he had poured their glasses, ready to settle in for another long night of nothing much at all, but something had changed. The vaults and storage rooms had all been catalogued, the bunker was clean, dinner was ready and waiting for them- a pot of soup he’d thrown together from what remained in the kitchen before their planned grocery run tomorrow, simmering at the ‘low’ setting on the stove. He realized it was because this was routine.
As he waited for the water to heat up (it wouldn't take long) he hummed under his breath- Taylor Swift, but he'd swear up and down it wasn't if anyone asked. He had an image to maintain: Winchesters did not listen to Taylor Swift.
, just carried on? How many more times could Dean drive him away before he simply stopped coming back? Could Cas love him, still, after everything? It seemed suddenly, terrifyingly clear that the void that kept cracking open between them was his own doing, and yet he couldn’t even begin to understand how it formed in the first place. Looking at Cas, the set of his shoulders and the sad downward turn of his mouth, he knew that he needed to do something to stop it, now.
It wasn't on purpose, but he just happened to be on his way out when they got back to the bunker the night they saw the house, en route to Clarkston, Michigan. Eileen had caught wind of a potential case, there, with four bodies already dropped and a dearth of nonsensical evidence that pointed to no monster in particular but definitely seemed supernatural. Locked door, nothing stolen, etc. She thought that between the two of them it would go much faster, and naturally, Sam was thrilled to see her. Of course the moment they arrived up north, the case complicated further when the chief of police was taken out too, so everyone at the station became incredibly suspicious and unwilling to incorporate 'Agents Mitchell and DiFranco' fully into the investigation.
But Dean did, sometimes. Florence + The Machine, too, even the
And then Sam was there, behind Castiel, and he just stabbed him with an
That was his lowest moment. He sat on his knees until they went numb and then, between one breath and the next, he was screaming. There were no words for the way that he felt, no way to let the pain out of his chest and get away from it, and so he screamed and sobbed until his voice gave out and he couldn't breathe through his nose or see through his tears. He picked himself up and curled up in Sammy's bed and let his brother tell him, not so convincingly, that it would be okay. That he'd be okay, that he should sleep and he'll feel better when he woke up. It was a lie, Dean knew it was a lie, but he was too tired to argue. Too tired to fight off the crumbs of hope Sammy was trying to give him. He passed out in Sam's room like they used to when they were younger, and tried to believe that this wouldn't kill him. That losing his family wouldn't be the thing that finally broke him. That he didn't want to be dead, too.
on after you knock me out- voyeurism is creepy, dude."
“Well if you
"Yeah, that is what's important," Dean echoed. "We really are better together, Cas." Cas's phone buzzed.
"But I think I know... I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having. It's in just being... it's in just saying it." And it's not making sense, the sad smile and the electricity and
"Where's Dad?"
"Honestly, I took pictures for you," Dean said sheepishly. "It just slipped my mind, sending them to you, with everything that came after. I mean, we got home, and then you were gone on that case-"
"East of Eden'. Do you mind?"
with Rowena. She told Sam, too, but I'm not sure when."
"Oh no, no,
just so, so good.
. Not since he was human, at least, he was pretty certain. And he wouldn't be fucking Dean, that's for sure. Neither of them were gay!
You're the worst."
Silence.
Dean says it anyway. "I've never seen the sea. Not in real life, I mean. I've seen it in movies, of course, and the Great Lakes a couple times, but..." he trailed off.
"Hey, man, I didn't say that," Dean soothed. "We can go look at the place. Make a day of it."
A beat.
Dean kissed him. Just a simple press of lips, nothing more, but he lingered there, playing with the short hair at the back of Cas's neck, twisting it between his fingertips.
“Don’t start with that fearless leader shit,” Dean said tightly, rolling his eyes away from Castiel’s face and fixing on a point somewhere over Cas’s shoulder. “Who’s driving?”
“Couldn’t sleep,” Dean whispered, letting his head fall back against the truck window, baring his throat further, and closed his eyes. He seemed almost happy, today. He seemed to light up in the lead-up to their more dangerous missions, and Cas didn’t want to think about that right now. Didn’t want to ruin the moment. “Didn’t want to wake you up,” Dean elaborated.
How long
Piano filtered out of the Impala's speakers, simple and low. It fell and rose, then fell and rose again, like soft waves on a shore, then- stopped.
"I have to go to Heaven," Jack said abruptly, putting his hand back down. "There's work that needs doing. Without more angels, it's going to collapse. Then I'll restore the other universes. It's not right what Chuck did- unmaking them all like that, just because he wanted to hurt us. Amara wants-" he shimmered, blurring at the edges, before appearing to split in two.
"I love you too," he whispered, then pulled back, collecting himself. He held Jack's face and just looked for a moment at his son. "You be good for Amara," he said with a levity that was only half-forced.
"Oh, shut up," Dean grumbled, giving up on his shame and dropping his hands. "I'm not old. And you're like, a bazillion years old, so you can't exactly talk."
"Fortunately I don't think that should be much of an issue. As long as the two of you have lived here, Dean has managed to accumulate surprisingly few possessions beyond clothing, records, and things in his 'Dean Cave'. And I don't really own anything," Cas reminded them.
"I'm sure whatever he's got going on, he's fine, Cas," Sam said gently, sliding something onto the plates he had lined up. "I mean, he is God. And we're all still standing, and earth seems to be doing alright, yeah? He'll be back. We just need to give him some time."
"I think we should listen to the Zeppelin tape you made me a couple years ago," Cas interjected. "I haven't had a working sound system in a car I could listen to it on for over a year. Of course, I know all of the songs, but the experience of listening to it as a whole is... different, than just having the knowledge of it. I used to listen to it quite often," he said, matter-of-fact. "I had begun to wear out the tape but I repaired it with my Grace shortly before Jack defeated Michael."
"Goodnight, Dean."
A whine forced its way out of Dean's throat.
But he was Dean Winchester. He beat God, he could do this.
"Well, we kinda struck gold on the very first one we saw," Dean said proudly. "I don't know how Cas did it, but it's perfect, dude. You're gonna love it. I can't wait for you and Eileen and the others to visit. It's not like here. It's a real home."
“Cas!” Jack shouts, bursting into the room only to find... nothing. “No, no!” he pleads with the air as he skids to a stop and Sam bumps into him, making him stumble over the chair sitting in the middle of the room. Sam steadies them with a hand on Jack’s upper back before clapping him with it apologetically and stepping away.
"It's not important," Jack mumbled, not meeting Dean's eyes.
Dean leaned in a bit, aligning them more closely together, and watched as Cas's eyes dropped to his mouth. "Do you want to kiss me?" he asked softly, dropping his hand from Cas's face to his chest. "I think you do."
"Dean," Cas said lowly, deliberately, cutting through the roaring in Dean's ears. "I don't know what brought this on. But surely you must know- I'm
. I just care."
He paused. "As long as you actually get up," he added. "Otherwise I may be forced to let slip your- ah- coffee indiscretions."
His soul. Still indescribable, after all this time. Perfect. Flawed. Beloved.
"No kidding."
"What's up, Sammy?" Dean yelled out from under the Impala's hood. He knew she was in excellent shape, with all his dedication to her, but she was going to have a big day tomorrow. "You better have a good excuse for fucking with my flow, man. I'm in Jefferson Airplane mode, if you didn't catch that, you modernist heathen."
"I can't stop him from loving another- I wouldn't. And I will never love anyone but him. Please try to understand that despite any... difficulties we may encounter in the future, I have made peace with my life, Sam. My choices are my own, just as my love is, to give to Dean. I do not see any chance of that changing any time soon."
"You bruised your tailbone when you fell," Cas said briskly, "and you-"
“Move them?” Cas asked, furrowing his brow. “Where would I need to move them to?”
, and then Cas says the worst thing of all.
Panic started to set in and Dean's heart began to race as it seemed like Cas might reject the peace offering he'd impulsively extended to him.
Actually, yeah, no. Fuck his life. Was it possible to melt into the floor and disappear? Sam could probably figure it out with one of his witchy books, courtesy of Rowena. She was scary. Impressive as fuck and super hot, but scary. Great hair. Wait, did he answer Cas yet? He was still looking really worried and really, really close to Dean, so maybe not.
"I heard that, Dean," Cas said quietly, cutting into his train of thought. "Do you really think my opinion of you could be so easily marred?"
“Yeah, at 8,” Dean said, sliding into his unshakeable militaristic persona with a firm nod. “Should be fairly straightforward in and out supply grab. Intel says the Croats cleared out of Roanoke a couple days ago, left major infrastructure and commerce sites relatively untouched. It’s a good thing too,” he added, “we were getting spread a little thin with most goods.”
"Hey, Dean, I thought I'd find you out here."
"I just don't want this day to end," he admitted in a wistful little tone. "This really is the best day ever, Dean. I mean it."
Cas squatted down next to him and laid a hand on his shoulder again. "Hey. Don't do this to yourself."
But Castiel snapped up a hand, palm out, and Bobby’s mouth moved, but no sound came out. “You will be silent,” Castiel ordered, his eyes never leaving Dean. He looked intrigued by Dean’s sudden compliance and admission. “I’d like to hear what you have to say, Dean. What can you possibly say to justify your lack of faith in me up until now? I could have cast you back into the pit, and Sam, too, had I not done this, all of it, for you.”
Standing impatiently among their motley caravan of vehicles in the sickly yellow light of a midwestern April morning sun, his back to Cas, Dean’s silhouette and the flashing imprint of his soul- the only one Cas could still see clearly- caramelized into a sweet union of tangible and not that pulled at his stomach and swept him into the siren song of Dean’s being and woke up the hungry creature that lived in his heart and craved
He isn’t sure if that bodes well or poorly.
All this time Dean thought it was his own fears and failings, a blame he carried on his own, but a different truth is making itself known, now.
question. No one could throw like that unaided.
Castiel accidentally wanders into anger, because how
“I think… we have to do this together,” Dean says. He points in a direction along the wall that separates them. “We gotta get out of here, and I don’t think there’s any way out but through.”
Dean thinks to go one way, Cas thinks to go the other, and they’re both paralyzed again.
“It’s fine.” Tension shot through Castiel’s shoulders. He set his fork down a little more harshly than he intended, making himself flinch. Naomi, though, was as steady as the stone of the vaulted ceiling above.
Some of the light-bees hover a bit closer, twinkling distractingly.
Dean doesn’t make any bald jokes.

sees things. Dean looks back along the path, and now that he wants to, he sees them too: spaces where trees should be, and little piles of glitter on the ground. He hadn’t even noticed them before. If he squints, he can see them: in each empty space, above each shattered mound of powder, a gently quivering pillar of soft light.
As if Cas didn’t have enough grief already, they fail utterly to reach any other angel, by phone or by magic. The summoning spell nearly works, but ultimately sputters like a match in a room without enough oxygen. It brings them back to the library sooner than maybe Sam had anticipated.
“They’re not real gods,” Sam explains. “At least, not… I mean, Crowley said they’re impressions, or
When the diner’s finally ready for full function, they get a wonderfully greasy breakfast. Jack discovers a deep and true love for hash browns, and Rowena sighs, making a sidelong comment about how she’s going to have to watch her figure the old fashioned way, but she tries to steal some of Cas’ bacon regardless.
The following night, the five of them land at a bed and breakfast in Boulder. The place is meticulously adorable to the point of being saccharine, and is empty aside from themselves, which allows them to take it over like it's briefly theirs. Sam must hear the call of his moose-y kin, Dean supposes, because for whatever reason, he seems absolutely
In reality, he sits frozen on the edge of his own bed while the scene plays out in his head, and then when it’s done, he flips on the light in the room and then flips it off again, and when Cas startles awake, he says, “Whoops, sorry, forgot you were there.”
If this is distressing to folks already accustomed to the occasional apocalypse, he can only imagine what it’s like for the rest of the world. The last few times the world had a near-miss, there was a certain plausible deniability: climate change, eclipses, that kind of thing.

weird to say goodbye.
The whole time, Sam’s had one eye on the news. It’s largely good, as near as they can tell: the few things that were broken are being rebuilt, people are going back to work, overall a startlingly little amount of harm seems to have been done, at least compared to what anyone would expect. The news anchors have psychologists and scientists on the air, trying to explain the “mass hallucination” possibly caused by “unusual frequencies from outer space.”
inside-out.
They’re only separated for a moment, just long enough for each to wiggle out of what they’re wearing from the waist down. Dean doesn’t even try to be cute about it, he just wants to feel that pressure and weight of Cas on him again without delay, now that he’s had it he’s bereft without it.

Still, he thinks he’d have liked the raven better. He wonders what it would look like not only on

“I said, can it,” Jody repeats, face set in cement. “I talked to Sam. And Jack, for that matter." She nods into the house. "You know, that kid’s probably the most well-adjusted of the lot of you.

“Just ‘cause he knows there are… were… monsters…” Dean realizes what this really is, and doesn’t bother to finish his original sentence. “I’m guessing this isn’t a polite suggestion.”
“What

What was left of the structure was mainly a crater full of crap, surrounded by partial broken castle walls, and filling with churning water where the flood was coming up the passageway that Crowley and Lucifer had come out of. They’d all been in that deep room that was now close to the bottom of the dip, which explained the water soaking Dean’s clothes.
Sam’s voice is too low for Dean to make out his whole response, but he catches the words
Beautiful is an understatement.
They gave Dean a hunters’ funeral, of course, but there was a distinct sense that something special should be done with the ashes the remained. Sam did some research, and they joked about the result --
Something rustled behind him. He noticed, but didn't pay it any special attention - he didn't dare take his eyes off of Turnip. She was digging slightly in the dirt with the tip of her beak.
“It wasn’t clear.”
Sam snorts. He feigns a scandalized tone. “Aw, Dean! You never said! I could have snored
“--Ssh--” Dean interrupts, one hand in the air commanding Castiel to halt.

Passing through a copse of trees, Dean was the first to catch sight of something sitting on a rock. It was shaped like a woman with long hair, but the clothes were ragged and there was something bent and gnarled about the shape of her. The position she sat in was almost animalistic. When Castiel opened his mouth, Dean clapped one hand to his face and pulled him close, so they could hide behind the same wide tree.
there, which is way, way hotter than it has any right to be. It makes this particular little rebellion feel much less toothless than it really is.
When they reach Maine, they go whale watching and, greatly to Cas’ disappointment, don’t see a single damn whale the entire time. Dean argues with the whale-guaranteeing tour operator until everyone’s uncomfortable, but he gets half a refund.
He glanced at Sam, who was breathless, the little dots of light reflected in his eyes as they fell on the mountain like snow, or confetti.
His puppet body does the same.
when Cas tipsily began to ramble about, of all things,
“So what those other people do?” Dean’s voice cracks, desperation leaking through. He wants to believe. He really, really wants to believe. “The ones who get better?”
“Veles,” Dean says, getting to his feet after being knocked over for a third time, refusing to stay on the ground.
The prayer stops cold, goes silent for a long, frozen moment. Then it returns,
That's a trap. He
Even Rowena relaxes eventually, finding the cleanest spot on the blanket to stretch out like a lazy cat.
Should he have felt good about this? That his brother, and… whatever Cas was to him now, were so concerned about his well-being? He didn’t, which added a layer of guilt to the irritation that scratched at his brain.
“Dean I--thank you, really--” Cas swallows a little of the feelings down, so he can speak clearly. “I don’t know if this makes any sense, but being here like this, it feels like… I’m allowed to exist.”
“Seems to be the last of it,” Cas declares, voice heavy with exhaustion. “At least, what’s coming out that way, rather than…” he gestures weakly to the wings. They’ve stopped shaking and twitching, now, but that’s almost worse, makes them seem like they’re hardly connected to him at all. An onlooker would be forgiven for imagining them some kind of elaborate, badly damaged costume.
“Wish I could just take you with me,” Dean said through a sigh. “‘Specially now you don’t have to do king stuff. It’d be perfect. Just you and me and Sam, on the road, under the sky…”
Dean remembers Cas said in his explanation. He mouths the word silently to himself.
but rather amused, or intrigued.
“Sam!” He hollers down the hall.
Around the world, in motels and cabins and safehouses, drinks are had, hugs are exchanged, and parties (of varying raucousness) begin to assemble. The messages in the chat grow sparse, lighthearted, and increasingly badly typed. Despite the surrounding conditions, this is something hunters, as a class, feel an
Cas goes on: “The only other angel I’ve met so far was certainly adversely impacted by the fall, but to go from that to a coward who doesn’t want to see me at all seems--”
Sam’s footsteps change from tile to cement to wood as he comes back through the kitchen into the library. Dean doesn’t leap away, or scoot back. For the first time, the scrabbling desperation to make excuses just fails him.
There’s a line between Sam’s eyebrows as he comes up behind Cas’ chair. He’s cradling one arm with the other, but his movements are still gentle and tightly controlled. Adrenaline, Dean suspects, still blocking some of the pain. Sam asks Cas, “What is it?”
The room’s been so quiet – words whispered or murmured, gasps and breaths, but hardly any sound above these things. That is, until, Cas takes Dean into his mouth, all at once, until his lips and nose are buried in dark, musky curls. At that point, Dean cries out.
"What did you say his name was?" Sam asked Dean, without taking his eyes off Castiel.
Castiel furrowed his brow, and looked off to one side. “If any kind of music works, including bad music, how do they know the difference between music and other sound?”
Oh. Boreas. Then the other one… Castiel knows them, at least a bit.
“Yeah, I do, and this is one of ‘em. I think what you’re trying to say is
“Helps you sleep whether you want to or not.”

it is, the better.
Cas sits up, eyes red-rimmed and puffy (as if he had been crying, which is why Dean tactically pretends not to notice. Not like he doesn't have about a thousand good excuses, if so.) He pulls himself to his feet, not acknowledging either of them but rather wandering down the hall to the bathroom in silence.
that punctuates his greeting
pathetic.”
Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t, Cas doesn’t seem swayed either way. He quirks an eyebrow and looks down at his own belly as he slides the t-shirt against his skin, more fastidious than Dean by far, like someone with new glasses meticulously clearing away a fingerprint.
“It doesn’t feel that different. Though, it’s a relief to relate to my body closer to the way I used to. I don’t feel quite as handcuffed to myself as I usually do.”
“I may not be as useful as I was, but I am able to read and identify numbers.” Castiel scowls, but the mask probably obscures it, blunting the conveyance of his irritation.
largely on his own shoulders, the way he figures it.

The land is so flat, a person can see for miles. Dean squints into the distance where the world curls up toward them like the ribbon on a gift, like an old rolled-up parchment. He’ll never get used to this, he thinks, before remembering that in all likelihood, he won’t have to.
He’s… almost positive.

uses stabbing as a coping mechanism?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says with great trepidation, schooling his expression into neutrality as he feels suddenly like something’s fallen out from beneath him and he might cry. He’d much rather not.
At some point, he stopped fighting. Time stretched and dilated until it seemed that years had passed.
Now he regrets not just going for it, even as he tells himself how unimportant it is. It’s a tool for getting him into a place he needs to be, so that he can do what they’re here to do, an object with a purpose.
for the future. Even now, it’s still a hard idea for him to wrestle with at times – wanting and choosing for himself, focusing on anything other than putting out the next fire. When he considers it, he turns to look at Dean without even realizing he’s doing it.

One of the chairs in the library has been replaced with a wheeled war-room chair, and Sam’s laptop is on the far table, closest to the entrance. A cord runs from the HDMI port to a little adapter box, to which he’s linked two more monitors, one on each side of the computer itself. Dean’s not even sure where he got them, but they look relatively new -- not original Men of Letters gear, to be sure.
He thinks about that one a lot, these days.
Sam makes a sound through his nose. Not a scoff, but scoff-adjacent. “What happened to
comes the whispered reply.
He’d been exhausted, Cas went on, burning the details into Dean’s brain, but to turn her down would have been awkward and who knows how she could have reacted? He didn't want to sleep on the street again, and there were much worse ways to secure a bed and a shower and a meal, but he’d have chosen additional sleep instead, if he’d felt he could safely choose.
Dean and Cas, then, take up an entirely different kind of hunting. Gloved and dust-masked (to lower the odds of bumping into something cursed or otherwise problematic) they dive into the bunker storerooms, unearthing every weak-point weapon available. No sense in hoarding, anymore. At some point, they do, in fact, bring Rowena some coffee.
It was hilarious.
There are wildflowers and seeds scattered on the ground, honeybees and wild birds and all manner of life positively humming around them. It’s beautiful.
He's retired. He's getting a giant tub.
Castiel, the former self-hating Angel of Thursday, is no more.
"Yeah, well, still," Dean said lamely, waving the hand not holding the rumpled towel awkwardly in front of his groin around to try and make his point. "Can you- can you turn around and let me get dressed?"
"From here in the bunker?" Sam asked, surprised.
If you asked him, in the moment or years on, Dean couldn’t have said where the idea came from, only that, against his better (worse) judgement, it came, and then he was asking:
and pushed Grandma back. She nearly fell into the glass shards but managed to keep her feet beneath her, looking shocked. Grandpa grabbed onto John in a bearhug from behind, pulling him back and away from Grandma. John thrashed in his grip, spitting and shouting obscenities. "John, please," Grandma said. "Be reasonable-"
"Dude, that's like a four hour drive," he complained.
"It's as real as it can get," Cas replied, handing Dean his ID too for comparison.
played through, no problem at all.
"Okay, clearly I didn't have to tell you. You and Cas apparently had a bet going, for Christ's sake!" Sam said. "I had no idea you'd do something as impulsively half-cocked as this, and not even think about the consequences."
Cas shifted in his seat. "I did attempt to avoid this level of fraud, at first, but I soon realized it would be impossible for us to pursue homeownership without a lot of less-than legal assistance. I'm just grateful she was willing to help us."
"I'll look after them," Cas said soberly. "You know I always will."
He cupped the water in his hand and leaned down over the sink, splashing it up into his face, then again, eyes closed, and again. He took off the towel he'd wrapped around his waist and patted his face dry- pat, don't rub- and several things happened at once.
story went too (
"Nothing bad!" Cas said quickly. "I found a house. Obviously, we don't have to go see it, if you don't want to, but I really think we should at least consider it. It's got a decent amount of land that I could turn into bee-friendly wildflower fields for the hive to use, and the house itself meets our requirements. Right down to your bathtub."
a strange, willing sacrifice, and closes the portal as it goes, leaving behind a bare room and Dean's buzzing other, other cellphone.
"Literally nothing," Dean snapped. "That's exactly what happened, and that's all that happened. It seemed like a decent idea at the time, I was sleep deprived, and Cas has seemed so lonely, lately. I

this song. I really do. I'm totally good to listen to it with you."
"Medical insurance? Dental?" Dean asked, his voice two octaves too high.
"I know you're grieving, John, but this isn't fair to the boys. It was Dean's birthday today, and he missed you so much he cried!" Millie said passionately. "You have to give up this ridiculous crusade you're on, honey, you're losing your sons-"
"Yeah. It's a set, with the little coffee table that goes between them. They just look cozy, you know? I like them. They have a good- what would Claire call it? A-"
Castiel wakes up, and he knows that those
"I just wish he'd been more clear with his timetable, then," Cas snarked back, looking exasperated. "After he brought me back from the Empty, he didn't tell me..." he trailed off, before shaking his head. "He didn't tell me anything much at all, really," he finished sadly.
"I had to do it. I couldn't leave you there," Jack said plaintively.
Sam sat down, his own plate loaded up in front of him. "Just because I usually eat pretty healthy doesn't mean I don't like food," he said shiftily.
The curve of his shoulder, well muscled, the line of his hip and his narrow waist beneath the blankets, the softness of stomach and thighs, the arm holding Cas close even in sleep.
He pulls the Impala off the road and shuts it off. He’d turned off the music a little ways back, content to have just the sound of the wind whistle-roaring in his ears as he and Baby raced down the winding open road, but now his hands are shaking.
"We need to make sure there aren't any clumps," he murmured, directing Dean's hand towards the pot, holding it closed around the whisk, his chest pressed against Dean's side and his left hand bracing lightly on Dean's back. "Stir slowly, like this, or it might splash up and curdle on the sides of the pot."
But still no Dean.
He drained his mug and rinsed it out by hand, soaping it up and rinsing again. He toweled it off and put it in the cupboard, but just as he reached for the pot on the stove, Cas stopped him.
There were a surprising number of crates and boxes remaining in the storage and unloading zones, either empty or nearly so, and he quickly ascertained the area was, apart from himself, devoid of life or anything of interest to the camp.
"Sure," Dean said uneasily, handing it over. "Hey, man, if I made you uncomfortable..." He trailed off, unsure how to continue. Grabbing Cas's tie and turning on the bedroom eyes was one thing when he thought they were both in on the joke, but if Cas really hadn't meant it that way at all, then what the fuck did he just do besides fuck up an otherwise awesome night over a little game of gay chicken? "Nevermind. I did, didn't I?" He sighed heavily. "I'm sorry. It won't happen again."
Then again, he'd had some pretty surreal times with Cas, and apparently God couldn't write Cas for shit, so...
Grandpa sighed and patted Dean on the shoulder as he walked past them to take Sam upstairs. "I love you, kiddo."
He finds Cas in a green field just beyond where the edge of the forest breaks and turns to prairie. He’s just standing there, leaning his right shoulder up against a sprawling, gnarled old oak tree.
"Oh," Dean hedged, looking to Cas uncomfortably for help answering. "I guess whenever we want? After the 7th, I mean."
"So what does Charlie have to do with you two just up and buying a house?" Sam nudged, trying to eek out some more information.
"Oh my fucking god," Dean said. "Try youtube. Spotify can be a bitch, I don't know what else you can do, man."
He woke up the next morning at eight to the smell of coffee drifting down the hall, which seemed as good a reason as any to get up. Maybe if he took his time getting out to the kitchen, there would be breakfast waiting for him there too.
Cas smiled, so wide and bright it made something in Dean’s chest ache with it.
"Maybe someday," Dean said, "I'll get there." Now that he had a someday, it didn't feel quite as impossible, anymore.
"This room doesn't have a microwave or a stove." He paused. "I don't have to eat, but Sam-"
“Mmm, morning,” Cas murmured between kisses. “You’re out here early.” Dean’s neck was uncharacteristically bare above the neck of his rough brown sweater, creamy and invitingly unmarked. Cas indulged in the impulse to change that, working his way over the tender skin, sucking and biting until a bruise began to bloom below the junction of Dean’s jaw and neck, worrying it with his teeth until it was a deep reddish-purple.
Dean shook his head. No. "Go for it."
"You think I haven't done the same?" Cas asked sharply. "Look at me. I know it's hard for you to- to let yourself believe me, but please." There was some desperate note in his voice that scared Dean to death. His eyes were fixed on the floor somewhere to the left of Cas's ribs, the tile blurring and disappearing.
was pushing you. I started thinking-" he swallowed the end of the thought.
The walk back to his room seemed less lonely and long than usual with Cas's arm brushing his as they moved.
"Yeah, you're probably right," Dean said dejectedly. "Maybe later."
“I’m sorry,” he whispers. It’s not enough, not by a long shot, but it’s all he has. What else is there to say? They’re dead already. It’s just a matter of moments, now.
It’s kind of awesome how well the kid is keeping it together, all things considered. Jack glances sideways at Sam from time to time, trying to gauge his plan (or lack thereof) with a sweet concern for his emotions. Blessedly, he doesn’t say anything during the drive other than asking for directions to the nearest gas station when their tank is nearly empty about two hours out of Lebanon. Sam wants to scream and cry and curse at Chuck and beg for his help, but he swallows the urge because he knows it can’t possibly help him. Besides, he has a terrible feeling that that’s exactly what Chuck wants. Chuck wants him to follow his stupid script. But he won’t, so he tries to distract himself with research- though what could possibly fix this he doesn’t know. He just wants to do something, anything, to make the ache in his heart where Eileen was hurt less.
"Because we didn't tell them that we're moving out of the bunker, I assume," Cas said, a bit sheepishly. "I didn't want to jinx it. I guess Sam told her."
"Okay," Jack said, his face suddenly crestfallen.
He’d dreamed of
"Yeah," Dean said, laying his sandwich in the skillet. He pulled out his key ring and showed off the new addition. "Already got this old key on the ring. Just until we get new ones."
Cas huffed a little laugh out his nose, hardly even a puff of air, really, but it tickled Dean's neck all the same. "Worst case scenario we'd have to start over, and it's getting late." His chin rested on Dean's shoulder for a long, syrup-y moment before he retreated, extricating himself back to his post nearby and relinquishing the whisk to Dean's control and taking all of his warmth and breath with him. His side felt strangely naked after having the weight of him so close. "Don't worry, though. You're doing fine. It looks smooth enough to me- put the whisk to the side and let that rest for a minute. You need to chop the chocolate."
The words rang in Dean’s ears, banging about his brain and battering it into despair. It felt like a small death, his heart pulling on his ribs as he floundered for a new angle to pursue.
"When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever."
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cas extending the tape towards him and so he reached back to take it- maneuvering deftly around a large pothole as he did so- and something went awry. Cas inserted the mixtape into the tapedeck in a single smooth, practiced motion, and Dean's hand went fully rogue as it failed to intercept the tape, landing, instead, palm-down, about midway up Cas's thigh. What he should have done was just take his hand back, and apologize, and laugh it off. Eat a gummy bear, like it was no big deal. Cause it wasn't. That's not what he did.
accepting, here."
"Couldn't sleep," Dean said shortly. "Decided to take a walk and maybe grab a book, try and read myself to sleep or something. I don't know," he said. "It sounded like a better idea in my head."
Sam got back from visiting Eileen at her place all week very late on Sunday night, laughing off Dean's ribbing and teasing, and promptly went to sleep, Dean turning in as well shortly after his brother. As he drifted off to sleep, cozily wrapped up in blankets and his best fuzzy socks, full of the most incredible pot roast and veritably high on terrible 1960's sci-fi, he found himself wondering how he'd ever gotten so lucky.
He tried not to drink himself to sleep anymore, not since Cas came back. After all, he wasn't getting any younger, and the hangover the next morning reminded him of that every time. But it was hard- so, so hard- to resist sometimes when he knew that the sweet embrace of a bottle like the ones waiting patiently for him in the kitchen could solve all his problems and plunge him into a deep, dark,
"I'm going to miss you so much," Cas said, choking up. "Come back. Come back as soon as you can."
"Yes, Dean," he said, positively glowing, "it would be nice. I think I'd like that very much."
," Dean panted out, extracting his hands, grabbing and pulling at Cas's hair until he deigned to come back to his mouth, exchanging long, lingering kisses.
Except that Jack was gone. Sam was getting married, and Cas was a little softer and a little sadder than he was before, and Dean got out-out.
"It's not like that, and you know it," Cas said, rolling his eyes and standing up, "but I will leave immediately after you fall asleep, if that's what you want."
"Washing the dishes when you can't even see them properly isn't going to make this better. Cleaning when you're distracted enough to hurt yourself isn't going to make it better either. You're using them to avoid the problem here, because you feel like you've been judged and found wanting," Cas said with infuriatingly calm logic, holding Dean captive to it with inhuman force.
making that noise as he clenched his hands on Cas's back.
It hurts.
you should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how.
“Um. There’s blood on the door?” Jack replies, voice going a little weird on the word ‘blood’. He walks away from the door and deeper into the room, going around the chair.
"Oops, right," Sam chuckled, returning to the table to retrieve it. He paused for a second, looking at the camera in his hands. Quite shyly, he said: "You know, you're right, Cas. About Rowena, and Eileen. And Eileen..." He steeled himself with a breath, and continued. "Eileen knows. She gets it. God, she's the best person I've ever met. Maybe that's part of why I love her so much," he said, painfully sincere. "I haven't been able to really talk about it much, yet. It's still so hard. But I will. We will."
He squinted out the window at the next mile marker. "We're really close," Cas said, pulling his phone back out and pulling up the realtor's instructions for their visit. "She says that once we're getting off the highway, we turn right and then take the third left. Then-"
this chapter got away from me a bit- it's long, but a lot happens that desperately needed to happen. I sliced it in half just for the sake of readability. the second half will go up monday. I hope you all enjoy it!
Dean averts his eyes, looking back at the book on the table for a second. He just doesn't want Cas to think he's weak. Pathetic, needy. No one liked people like that. Burdens.
"Three months," Dean interrupted him, the words catching in his throat. "It's been three months, and no one has needed me. No one has asked me to put my ass on the line, again. I'm-" his voice broke. "I'm out, dude. Sue me for wanting a life where I actually see the sky on a daily basis, rather than living like some kind of underground prisoner."
"Dude, 7:00 am therapy, really?" Dean asked dubiously. "Leave that shit to Sam."
His eyes shot open, and he gripped the fishing rod more tightly almost on autopilot. As he started to reel it in, he caught a flash of blonde hair in the corner of his eye.
Cas reached down into the footwell and then straightened up abruptly, handing Dean the bottle. "She's coming up the driveway now." He got out of the car.
"I could never hate you, Dean," Cas said, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth as he looked down at Dean in amusement before he wiped his face blank again. "But you really do need to get up."
The moment he presses his lips to Cas’, he hears a sharp intake of breath and there’s a return of pressure that practically bowls him over completely. He has to fumble behind himself to brace against the low headboard and it pulls an embarrassingly high-pitched noise of surprise out of him.
Getting into Big Otis’s truck is a terrifying leap of faith -- Castiel has to believe that this man is not possessed by a demon, not a vessel for an angel, not in the employ of any of the above, and, on top of
“So what does that mean for us?” Dean frowns. “We’ve both been… I mean, can

they both think at once.
“And you’re sure you’re gonna lose them?” Sam asks, and Dean winces at how direct it is, but it’s relevant, and he wants to know the answer just as much.
“Gone the way of the dodo, I’m afraid,” she says through a resigned sigh. “Couldn’t even muster a bit of light to see by. Embarrassing, is what it is.”
So Rowena drinks deep of the mug in front of her. She mixed the drink herself, in the kitchen. Dean can smell the rum, what else he can smell, he’s not sure.

“That’s what I was trying to--” Castiel takes a steadying breath. He bristles a little at the hypocrisy, but knows better than to point out the frequency with which Dean fails to follow his own rules. “When I wanted to help Hael, the angel I told you about, I thought--”
The snow’s supposed to stop soon. In the morning, Dean will layer up and go dig out the car, and once the plow comes through, he’ll go downtown at five miles an hour and buy enough NyQuil and ibuprofen and sudafed to start his own pharmacy.
Even as the tunnel of his vision constricted and his world was reduced to almost nothing but the

It’s fortunate an angel like Ezekiel found Dean first. His own failure will sting a little less, then.
“Fine, fine, but if anything gets hinky, and I mean
Now, other people do those things.
“They didn’t tell me, because they didn’t want me to tell you.”
Ezekiel doesn’t react, or at least he doesn’t appear to. It’s hard to know what’s really going on in there, since he hasn’t entirely gotten the hang of facial expressions, instead leaving Sam’s face coldly flat, or tensed in configurations that could be in the dictionary next to
Did she bother with them, when she was here? Suddenly he can’t remember. Maybe it’s his own voice, after all.
Finally, he catches sight of it: smoke, rising in the distance, then a chimney, and then at last the little obsidian cabin (cabin is a generous word given the size of the thing, Dean thinks) beneath the crystal branches.
and the entire rest of the party follows his lead. Someone, possibly Eileen, whistles through two fingers.
The moon and the oil lamp cast competing shadows on his brow and the stubble of his cheek. Barring faint lines on his forehead, his face was smooth – he couldn’t be more than thirty-five by Castiel’s reckoning, but his eyes were wary enough to belong to someone older. In the dark, the man’s pupils were so big Castiel couldn’t even make out the color of his eyes, but they were active and appraising, tracing quick paths all over Castiel’s face so openly he could almost feel their movement on his skin.
here needs it, it always has. To be honest, it never should have been ours to begin with. I put it back, where it belongs.”
He pulls back.
“I don’t know.” Jack shrugs. “I learned everything I could about djinns, at least, about what they were before, trying to find something that would prove it to you. Sam even reached out to see if there were any former djinns online, who’d gone human now but might have something helpful to say. We did find someone, a woman in Dubai who said she was a leader of a group in Syria, before -- she knows Castiel, isn't that funny?”
The big soul-ball in the sky brightens and dims at intervals no one can quite work out. There is day, and there is something vaguely resembling night in summer at the North Pole, but in the bunker, they’re insulated from it. They do what they have to, when it has to be done. They make their own hours.
A pained expression crosses Sam’s face, and he looks down at his screen. From the liminal space between library and kitchen, Dean can see several windows on the far-right monitor. One he recognizes as a twitter feed, another is facebook, and another he doesn’t know, it looks like a darker, sleeker version of an old Prodigy chat-room, and by the line-by-line flicker, the conversation looks to be moving quickly.
They make an appointment -- a normal one, not an all-day one -- three days away. Stan gives Dean some instructions in case of an urgent situation, and leaves ("No, you don't need to be hospitalized. You can keep it together for a couple days.") Dean feels like he’s made of spun glass, about to shatter if someone so much as breathes on him. Aren’t people supposed to feel better after therapy? He’s pretty sure he feels worse.
“Cas,” Dean grumbles, “You wanna stop flirting with your old pals and get me outta here?”
“Clock’s back,” Sam says, then adds: “Sort of.”
To acknowledge it, though, would be complicated, it would be awkward, it would be risky beyond belief, and for all his joking about
He lives.
came out of the darkness at either side of them - spindly, slumping things like whatever had just taken a shot at the pair; small, waxy-looking fanged creatures in the trees; quick, webbed things with too many eyes that slithered along the ground - things like no animal Castiel had ever seen in life or even heard of in stories. He could sense their malice in the air like a fog.
He’d had
It’s Dean’s turn at the computer when he realizes what’s happening. By an odd coincidence of energy levels, he’s the only one awake. While he and Sam (and Wren, to some extent) have been sleeping in semi-coordinated shifts, they’re doing it discreetly, bothering neither Rowena nor Cas to sign onto the schedule.
“They’re
“He’s concerned about my digestion,” Cas says, words mildly slurred by drowsiness.
“Look at you,
He recalls moments when it’s been a drumbeat in his head:
of being secretly dead, and I wasn’t offended by that.”
From behind him, Cas says, “I’ll try it.”
“I think it came to collect.”
He'll laugh about it much later, sure.
"Father, please, if you're still here, if you're listening, if you care at all," he begged, "
Cas settled at that, acknowledging Dean with a silent nod. The song played out, and with the end-
Yeah, he could do this anytime, and he could do
"Mmkay," Dean mumbled doubtfully through another mouthful of hot chocolate. He swallowed, cupping his hands around the hot mug. "I gotta ask, though-" He pointed at the drink. "How did you do this? Like, there's a secret ingredient, and there's witchcraft involved, right? No hot chocolate has the right to be this good."
His hand stayed put, and every single rational brain cell he had ever possessed went silent as he was left completely at a loss as to what he should do next. His thoughts spiraled and devolved into invisible panic, and still his hand lingered as the first track, "Immigrant Song" started up, bold and irrepressible.
“I- okay,” Dean said shakily, the breath punched out of him by the unadorned
He had never felt so weak. Groveling to his dad was different. He was his dad’s son, sure, but there was no love there. It was all survival, clinical, even his rage and his fists when Dean didn’t do enough to earn his mercy were detached. Duty and discipline and disappointment. This was different. It was hot with near-tears, messy and filled with grief for a man who wasn’t even dead. He wasn’t lying earlier when he told Cas he was like a brother to him. It was the closest comparison he had for what the angel was to his heart. He had never needed anyone like he needed Castiel- because he wasn’t Sammy, or Bobby, or Lisa, or Ben, or Cassie, or any other category of need. He was just Cas. And Dean
. You’re not my family, Dean,” he said, closing the remaining distance between them until he stood less than an arm’s reach away, positively radiating power, the air vibrating with it. “You’re just… human.”
He always did smell like summer.
Cas shoved through the access door into the freezers, and out into the store with a recklessness he would have been ashamed of had he been so terrified.
Sammy was strung out and swaying on his feet behind Cas, his eyes darting and rolling over the room as he rode out the hellish things that tormented him in his head, seemingly incapable of reacting to the gravity of the situation as what Cas had done put him out of his mind with fear.
) soul and knew.
"Okay, speed-racer," Dean interrupted with a tight little grin, still trying to make his stupid brain shut up, trying to make his heart stop doing the stupid squeeze-thing. It didn't work, completely, but he tried. "Just tell me what exit to take and we'll go from there, okay?"

“Thank you.”
this question before.
as Sam gasped for air behind him, clearly distressed and stumbling backwards.
your past is just your story. once you realize that, it loses its power over you, and you can begin to create your future.
Christ, if Cas's words don't cut Dean straight down to white bone, laying bare every thought Dean has had in his darkest moments, the pain and blood and useless destruction he lives on repeat in his mind every day wishing he was
“Hey, hey,” Dean said quickly, bristling, “no one’s making anyone leave. I just figured, what with the world finally being free, and everyone making new choices and all that, you might want to take advantage of that freedom Jack gave us. Someday. That’s all. I’m not- I’m not kicking you out.”
Dean looked at him, really looked, and still felt like he was missing something, like there was a piece of the puzzle left but he couldn't find its spot. Still, warmth bubbled up in him at the sight, Cas's face and hair cast in bronze, like some sort of Greek God. Cas felt him looking, Dean knew he did, because after a moment he turned and  flashed him a slightly gummy smile, pride clear in the set of his face.
"Damn it," he cursed, crouching down on his knees to pick up the pieces, his shaking hands dripping soapy water everywhere.
“No. Not really. It looked like one of the angels, Duma, but it wasn’t her,” Jack says. “It was this…
Dean had forgotten about the whole house thing. Okay, not forgotten, just gone a bit... complacent. He'd thought he'd get around to looking, eventually, and now here they were and whoa, ooooookay, this was all happening kinda fast.
Fuck.
"This isn't real," Dean said, not sure if it was a question or a statement. "This stuff isn't real."
“Cas, I love you. Of
It didn't make sense, but Dean felt wide awake now.
“Do you think it was-”
"I understand," Cas said. "This is challenging. And I know you're not an idiot. You're incredibly smart-"
"What?"
"You don't have to say that," Dean muttered under his breath.
“I- when I was dead. When I was in Heaven,” Jack says hesitantly. “When I was in heaven, and Cas came to bring me back, we were attacked.”
He hid his face in his hands, trying and failing to steady his breathing.
. He peeked over at Cas, again, and immediately slammed his eyes back to front. There was a certain
Just as Dean made up his mind to go, Cas looked up from his book and directly at him, instead. His eyes lit up. "Dean," he said in greeting, before a look of concern crossed his face as he realized just how late it was. "Are you alright?" he asked, taking his feet down from the table and setting the book aside.
Almost six months on, now, and he was next to the prettiest lonely little river in all of Kansas wishing he was home with his family instead of fishing alone and watching the sunset.
, he thought, hysterically, before stomping that into oblivion and turning around. Can't force someone to be your friend. They are, or they aren't. "Just- good night, I guess," he said haltingly. "And, Cas.
I love you,” Dean rushes out, his heart racing, his voice wrecked. “You can have it- you can have
He was through the service doors of the building before the Croat hoard could even begin to respond to his escape, and their noises were quickly muffled by the service door as it locked automatically behind him, leaving him in relative quiet.
, he gathered him in his arms, and carried him back to the truck on numb feet, leaving the scraps of Jimmy's coat behind in aisle seven.
John laughed bitterly, throwing a bottle past Grandma's head. It hit the wall and shattered, and she barely muffled a squeak of fear. She steeled herself in the face of her son's blind fury and tried again. "I don't think you've spent more than a week with Sam in the last year. He wouldn't know you if he saw you. But Dean loves you, John, he does, and you're breaking his heart. I won't let you see him like this. And I won't let you see him only to leave him again. He deserves better than you right now."
There was a crude metal stake wedged just an inch to the left of his second and third thoracic vertebrae, rusted, twisted and cruel-looking.
"No, just leave it. It'll get too hot if you wear those. You should grab some fuzzy socks though. Cold feet are the worst."
Cas stood up, setting
"This one," Sam muttered, resuming his chopping.
Dean didn’t know what to say to that. The disappointment radiating from Cas was actually bordering on tangible, the tension in his shoulders clear as he directed his gaze anywhere but at Dean. So he sat there instead, stewing in quiet disgust at his own inability to make it right, to say what he really wanted to say, to say
In the last five months, before settling into whatever this was, they fought God, nearly lost Jack, killed Death, killed God. He lost Cas, and had gotten him back, again (
He was mortified. Standing there like a dumbass, with tear tracks on his face and a red, splotchy nose, getting told off for a tantrum. "I'm not a fucking child, Cas," he hissed. "Don't baby me." He tried to push away from him, to turn back to the sink and avoid whatever this was, but he couldn't break Cas's grip on his hands. Instead of letting him go, like any normal fucking person, Cas just held on. "You didn't need to heal me," Dean snarled, yanking on his arms ineffectually. "Just let me do the fucking dishes."
Cas squeezed his eyes shut. "I didn't expect to be saved."
He pushed himself into a more upright position with one hand on the pillow between them, then turned to face him and held his cheek in his left hand. Cas's hair was fucked up from changing. It suited him. Dean slid his thumb over Cas' cheekbone, down to the corner of his jaw. Cas leaned into it, looking at him with intense curiosity, his hand slung low around Dean's hip that couldn't be described as anything but possessive, even if he didn't know it. It was pretty hot, actually.
. I- no, I would not change a thing, other than perhaps to make your life, or your brother's, or Jack's, or Claire's, have had less pain in them than they have had, because none of you deserved the hands Chuck dealt you. I want Jack back, of course, but I don't wish for anything else. What we have is- it's
since his vessel is different and his grace is gone, because he also knows that most of them absolutely despise angels.

Dean leans over, takes one look at it, and splutters with laughter. When Cas narrows his eyes in a glare, Dean says, “Re
The map on one screen is minimized, and so is the graph of sightings-by-hour, all shunted aside in favor of a large grid of videos -- helmet-cams and dash-cams and body-cams worn by hunters willing to share what they’re seeing with Sam and, sometimes, the world. With that narrow view, though, Dean can’t see the forest for the trees, and that’s probably why he didn’t catch on the way Wren has.
“Speaking of sleep, I uh…” Dean lets the air out of lungs. He doesn’t have any idea how to finish this sentence without sounding like a little kid scared to go to bed after a horror movie, so he just acknowledges it. “There’s no way this isn’t a weird thing to say, but what do you think about all… staying together, tonight, to sleep?”
“I thought it was heaven too,” Dean says. “I don’t, anymore. I don’t think we’re dead. That Gauri lady specifically said not to kill us, right?”
If anyone is home, they aren’t exactly making their presence known. This isn’t entirely bad – he’d hoped he might have a chance to do the more tedious bits of the process on his own. He wrestles the tree as lovingly as he can into a tree stand filled with water and surrounded by a lush red tree skirt.
This is Castiel’s problem.
the motels. Wake up from a nightmare, look over, you’re snoring, that’s how I’d know everything was normal.”
Cas sat down beside a large piece of debris off to one side, up the wall of the pit in the thickest part of the magical mist, and Hannah followed. Dean couldn’t see much -- the mist was too dense from his angle, and it obscured his view.
They recovered the recoverable and stored it all at the bunker, but aside from that, they were too busy with the unreasonable responsibilities the world heaped upon their shoulders to spend much time thinking about what to do with the land, and it was isolated enough that no one bothered them about its decay.
“Spaced out, yeah, I could tell,” Dean grumbles. “If you can’t pay attention to me, at least pay attention to the dead guy.”
A huge buffet table in the shape of a crescent moon butts against one curved edge of the clearing, and
“But she said not for a while yet.”
He then artfully concealed his utter
“Sam!!” Dean calls over the ending of the song. He catches sight of the plastic shell in Sam’s hands. “Hey! You got Rowena’s birthday cake!”
fast, they have a nerdy sense of humor darker than an oil slick, and they’ve only been hunting a few months. Apparently they went after a crocotta less than three days before the world ended. In the process, they jumped out a window and wound up with a compound leg fracture. Being laid up gives them little else to do but coordinate.
“Do you think they know we’re here?” Castiel asks. If it were angels, for example, they would almost certainly know immediately if a perimeter had been breached, so the question seems relevant.
“That’s...” Cas is breathing like there’s not enough air in the room.
"Okay... Cas, then." Dean nicknamed him all over again, and the sheer audacity of someone shortening his
“--Drank some poor liquor store outta business, yeah, hard to forget.” Dean laughs, caught up in the odd memory, alarming at the time, but funny looking back.
“Better now, certainly.” Castiel said softly, with no shortage of awe. Turnip took off from Castiel’s shoulder, scratching his skin by accident as he began the slow, inelegant climb up the slant. Turnip herself found a tree branch well above the man, and regarded him with suspicion. Castiel appreciated her concern.
half a century ago, and while this particular genre of car maintained a following among certain oddball humans for quite some time, it was around twenty years ago or so that the well of parts (even those cobbled together from scratch by the few remaining hobbyists) truly began to dry up.
Dean’s memory
The sounds of home.
Dean complains about the angle of it, how it blinds him, and insists on a pit stop at the rest area up ahead where he can wait half an hour or so until it’s less annoying.
And on the seventh day, they rested, Dean thinks. He keeps the thought to himself, Cas seems to be in good spirits and he’s not sure if that sort of crack might threaten the mood, given the earlier outburst.
They’re the last to arrive at Eileen’s place and Sam greets them at the door. Somehow – with his usual tunnel-vision, Cas supposes – he’d failed to notice the start of that relationship, though he's fairly sure it's not been overly long. It was Christmas when it became obvious, and Sam packed up and went to stay with her for a few days after that.
He and Hannah had played in these woods as children, but that was a long time ago now, and the landscape had clearly moved on, renewed itself, and become something entirely different. She was always the one with the better sense of direction anyway - Castiel recalled a lot of very specific bugs, leaves, and flowers, but not quite so many landmarks.
“Jody, no, I’m not gonna--Maybe church didn’t work out so this is your new hobby, but a
Rowena frowns, all quizzical. She gestures to the outfit. “You don’t like all this?”
Grace suffuses the wandering walls and rolling floors. There isn’t a ninety degree angle in the entire thing. Modestly-sized photos of Winchesters (Sam, Dean, Jack, Mary, though John is notably absent) line the cluttered entryway, a thing Sam would never have tolerated when he was alive, but upon which Rowena and Sonja firmly insist now.
! Leaving a woman standing on your dirty stoop all the live-long day--Ah, now you’re noticing, are you?”
He wonders if she’s thinking about Crowley, about everything that he did, about his choices, his internal calculus, and the answers he found.

“Then do it for me. Indulge my need to stab,” Dean insists. What he
“Dean?” Cas asks.
If he let go with either hand, the thing would surely take her below-ground, he was sure of that, so reaching for any sort of weapon would be impossible. He did the only thing he could think of:
Chapter 2 & 3 originally were together but I split them up for length... but I still felt they should get posted together anyway. :-)
As quickly as Turnip tried to launch away, it caught her quicker.
What happened to Thursday? He groans and lets his head fall back. The edge of the tub is closer than he’d realized, so there’s a painful
Day by day, Rowena starts to adapt to a more practical existence -- this too, does not go unnoticed.
“I gotta leave. Me and Sam,” Dean blurted, and from there the rest of the words escaped as if of their own accord, Dean fidgeted and paced and babbled like he couldn’t stop even if he wanted to. “I didn’t know how to tell you. I still -- This doesn’t change anything, okay? It’s not forever, maybe. I’ll visit. I swear. I’ll visit
It’s not as if Dean doesn’t like a little peace and quiet away from people, but every spot Sam points to just seems a bit sanitized. If
It took so long to get here, to find a safe place that he can rest. He hadn’t expected so many visitors.
Cas grumbles under his breath, and grabs Dean’s hand so that their fingers are clasped, as if they were a couple on a stroll in the park rather than fighting for their lives against an insubstantial horde.
Castiel looks down at Dean’s phone screen. The little dot that signifies where they are is on top of the little dot that signifies where they’re meant to be: in the middle of a withered field full of overgrown-but-yellowed grass and little else. He says nothing, and just turns the screen so that Dean can see it.
“Keep them open, okay?” Dean insists evenly, not breaking eye contact as his hands wander upward.
“Did you start out here, or…”
about it was Charlie, but that didn’t mean that the rest of them haven’t been stricken by the same rudderless, existential loss so clear on Sam’s face.
In between stops at points of interest, they unload artifacts: they’ll deal with museums, antique stores, pawn shops, rich weirdos, whoever bids highest. There’s a lot they can carry now, having reclaimed so much of Baby’s prodigious trunk space. Some of it is genuinely worth what they get, but some things need a little assistance.
hated gin. Same as you. I’d forgotten completely until you asked.”
How did they know what to do? Was it some kind of Thaumaturge instinct? Did Hannah tell him, when she was whispering, or maybe without speaking at all? It was a reminder of everything Dean didn’t grasp about Cas. The pull of his curiosity was so strong it was like a physical clenching in his chest. He wanted to get closer, to understand as much as he could, but there wasn’t much chance of that, now.
“In case they don’t come again,” Dean nods his understanding. “You ever write about anything more… recent?”
“You uh... feeling okay?” Sam asks Dean, when he wanders in and realizes what’s been prepared. If the banana-usage bothers him, he doesn’t say.
He looks up, and there’s Sam: one hand on his keyboard, the other reaching up to his head, slow and trance-like. His fingers sift over a halo of flyaways, like they’re looking for exactly the right hair, and when they find it, they separate it from the rest, slip down it once, twice, double-and-triple-checking, and then the strand is pulled free.
He considers Ezekiel, and how
In better weather, the sunset would paint the pale stone of the squared-off stronghold in pinks and oranges. Now, it only grows gray and dark as the light fades. The edifice towers over the hillside, and Dean can see Sam at one of the narrow windows. He raises one leather-gloved arm in a wave, but Sam doesn’t respond – he must be deeply distracted by some view not to notice his lord’s hail, and Dean means to find out what has him so preoccupied.
all of a sudden -- the soft weight of the worn cotton shirt he’d borrowed, the movement of the processed air from the coughing, hissing vent behind him, it’s like he’s accidentally cranked some sensory input setting all the way to ten.
(Dean’s sudden groan goes straight to Cas’ dick) for unfettered access to his neck, and the attention Cas pays there with lips and tongue slows Dean’s button progress considerably.
It is finally, finally, finally, like the release of a held breath.
They talk, after that, a conversation that probably should have happened years ago, maybe sometime after purgatory. It’s waited too long, like everything.
It’s not a big surprise that there is a meandering sort of road trip.
"I should be back before dawn," Castiel said by way of answer.
It is a lost art, like the manufacture of buggy-whips, or handwriting in cuneiform, and at this point, while he still calls her Baby to her face, he also privately calls her
“What, you want to have a picnic?” Dean says, glancing in the rear view mirror for a flicker of eye contact.
“When we would fight as children,” Boreas says, his words leaden with nostalgia. “Yes.”

Turnip appeared to consider this for a moment, before leaping silently into the nook of an embrasure in the wall, and then, after a brief calibration, up onto the merlon next to it – her answer.
The mist disappeared into Hannah little by little, and Dean got a better view. Light could be seen, just a bit, from between their interlocked fingers.
On risk-benefit analysis, the latter assumption seems safer, so he holds up a handful of bloodied leaves and calls them what they are, out loud. He feels like himself again for a moment, right down to realizing too late that Dean was trying to make a joke.
“Stay with me,” Dean says, when his hand starts to move and Cas’ eyes start to flutter closed again.
“That was my first worry, too, that the sightings fell off because we were losing people, but no -- I got real quick responses when I checked in online. Almost all the editors were active less than thirty minutes ago, and there’s been no new deaths reported on the chat -- well, a few civilians, but no new hunters.”
There’s enough left over that Sam’s got some plan allowing, as he’d put it,
“Dean?!” There’s a note of concern in Sam’s voice when the silence lingers too long after the cough.
“He’s just, uh--” Dean knows that if he makes up stupid excuses long enough, Sam will figure out that he’s being stubborn and give in whether he believes a word of it or not, so he tosses out a half-lie without putting that much effort into it. “He’s really wigged out right now. I think if we did something useful, he might feel better. Like he’s part of the team still.”
“I’m as surprised as you,” she admits.
Sweet. There’s an idea. He doesn’t tell her, but he sends a text message to Sam that only says
Wren’s name pops up in the color Dean now thinks of as admin-yellow. Next to it, the message:
Still, every time she says
“Yeah, well, I’m glad he didn’t now, if someone has to get their shit wrecked by some creepy wind gods it might as well be me.”
“You are the worst salesman in the universe, I already said I’ll take it.” What is it, eight hours there? Another nine back to Kansas? He could drag that out to a couple days each way, if he really has to. Plenty of time to hatch a plan. He thinks clearer behind the wheel anyway.
“That bad?” Castiel’s mouth twitches up at the corner. He hasn’t been spending a lot of time in front of mirrors.
They peer around the tree to get another look at the open space ahead. The shape and structure of it recalls fractals, or crop circles, with one main circular clearing, linked in loose tangents with other, smaller clearings surrounded tightly by trees and bushes.
There isn’t really anything to fight.
Naomi read the confusion on his face, and elaborated simply: “You would understand, because
Yes, Dean thinks, that
"No one's ever said that to me before," Castiel muttered. Despite his earlier self-flagellation, he took a long, deep drink, draining the pewter tankard.
Castiel looks down at the pattern of the tabletop.
Cas nodded. “Human.”
“Like flashbacks? I thought those were from… fireworks, or cars backfiring, that kind of thing.”
in some fundamental way, but the longer he went not addressing it, the more difficult it seemed to be, and then Dean died and woke up with black eyes and the prayers, unintentional or otherwise, stopped.
Sam makes a gesture that Cas interprets correctly, and the box gets passed momentarily across the table so that Sam can add the loose feathers to it. Once it’s back in Cas’ hands, Sam shucks the gloves and takes his own seat, across the table.
“When’s Rowena get in?” Dean asks. He wants to know, and he wants to take the attention off Cas, and this accomplishes both goals.
They helped one another up the side of one tree-covered slope, and going down the pebbly opposite side, Dean slipped and stumbled. It was pure luck that Castiel was in a position that allowed him to catch Dean without falling over himself.
“Hey--” Sam’s quite rightfully disoriented for a moment, but gets his bearings fast. “Dean. What is it?”
a damn thing, thank-you-very-much, it’s just not his usual style. His more typical discreet-hand-holding, shoulder-touching, back-tracing, close-standing manner of affection generally seems to suit Cas just fine. Then again, Cas doesn’t seem to mind
The last thing he sees as the autumnal world around him splinters into shadows is Dean, collapsing next to him. He tries to shout, but the sound is choked in his throat, the way it was in his nightmares.
In a quiet moment, Dean has a chance to chat briefly with someone who calls themselves Wren, and who turns out to be Sam’s co-administrator on the hunting group chat that’s been so instrumental.

He blows up at Sam for going away for a couple of days and taking too long to answer a check-in text (and Sam dredges up some really expert shots in return, fending him off until he storms out.)
Dean clutches the chunk of fence in his hands, a rusted and flaking security blanket. He knows that’s all it is, that it’s no match for what’s converging on them. Sam knows it too, Dean can feel this like he can feel his own heartbeat. A heavy hand lands hard on his shoulder.
the other one back to reality
"It's almost our birthday," Castiel admitted into his drink, and then froze, realizing that in those four words, there was more than enough information to completely reveal him. He closed his eyes and huffed out a long breath through his nose. He could just kick himself for letting the drink (whatever it was - it was stronger than beer by a mile and tasted different from anything Castiel had ever had before) loosen his tongue to that extent.

At first it was a matter of shame and self-deprecation, creaking beneath the weight of his burdens, but even when he broke past the worst of that, he kept doing it until it became an amusing tradition, a shared joke, where they keep putting the pictures up anyway.
and I tracked you all the way here and found you before any of those flapping assholes got a piece of you? Face it.” Dean spreads his arms wide, palms to the sky. “I’m the world’s greatest detective. I’m Batman.”
The water sloshed with the wind. Sam put a knee on one side of Dean, bracing him so he wasn’t on his own holding the position that kept him out of the flood.
“Bits and pieces,” Cas says. “Not everything, I don’t think. You were thinking about… last night, but that wasn’t… I was asking about Ezekiel. The loudest thing I heard was… you
The cluster parts, creating a path for the approach of a deeply regal goddess. She herself is the color of gold or turmeric, shot through with whorls of burgundy freckles, and more gold is draped about her, across her body and woven into the black and red cascade of her hair. Rings and bracelets adorn all four of her hands, and her ankles and toes as well. Her mask is huge and elaborate, calling to mind both a parrot and a crown, and her clothes jangle with every graceful step.

He doesn’t tell Cas that it lights him up like an old painting of an angel, halo and all.
The seed they planted grew into an olive tree that was extremely odd for the location. It was isolated enough, and the firs and pines around it were large enough to give it cover, even though the influence of Grace caused it to grew much larger than an ordinary tree of its type.
“Is everybody okay?” Sam frets.
Late at night, when the humans have all gone to sleep, Cas listens.
He reaches down and touches his own chest, confused, trying to establish if he has a body at all.
“No middle name,” Dean points out.
A memory floats past, of when he was eight years old and his father gave him five bucks and sent him into a dollar store to buy toys for Sam. He was allowed to pick out exactly
He holds his breath when Dean hits his shoulders because he knows what’s coming next if he keeps going in that direction.
They’re both saying the same thing, proportionally, which is impressive. Three hours will have to be enough sleep for Sam for now.
“Cas, what--” Dean’s speech cuts off the moment his eyes actually process the scene in front of him -- the rain of feathers and scraps of cloth.
“The guy’s from ATVA,” Jody just keeps going. She’s a woman on a mission, ignoring the nonsense falling out Dean’s mouth, making him feel like he’s being read his rights. “Most of his patients are like you. SWAT guys who walk into buildings full of armed skinheads, teachers who live through school shootings, victims of natural disasters. It’s not what you think.”
“Well, praise the lord for that, Rob says, to which Dean smiles and nods despite his total lack of intention to do anything of the sort. After Rob turns on the television, he disappears into the back of the diner.
The next cup Cas chooses is the gin. Dean holds his breath for this drink (the most meager of the three as far as his own cups are concerned) but it doesn’t help. He’s never been a fan, and now his taste buds helpfully inform him that he isn’t about to start anytime soon. Cas, on the other hand, has gone all bright-eyed.
(When is a door not a door?)
out, I suppose? Locked in your fortress of solitude?”
It’s almost impossible to focus, with carbon dioxide setting every nerve on fire, but goddammit this would be the absolute
“After you,” Dean half-whispers, clearly conscious that perhaps being audible could go both ways, and they set off toward the noise. The crunching of dried leaves is undeniably satisfying, but makes it challenging to be very stealthy.
They instinctively maneuver back to back as the things pour out of the woods around them -- not vampires or werewolves or leviathan, but hazy scratching, clawing shapes made of wind, shown to be humanoid by the dust they kick up.
A little pinpoint of light appeared at the lowest point of the crater, with his eyes open he could see it faintly below the surface of the water. It swelled until it was an undulating ball that stretched well above the surface, it had to be at least the height of a man.
put them.”
“Yes, to all of those things,” Jack says, which is a good sign.
“I make no promises, hunters, and no deals, but I understand your position and appreciate that trust. The… side-effects… of your contact with the winds’ power will last until sunrise. For that time, you may safely partake of our food and drink.” Gauri’s voice is warm and musical, but she sounds tired.
“I don’t remember,” is his answer to almost everything. He remembers being in the Empty, and then he remembers standing outside the bunker in the sun. There is a certain hazy feeling, he reports, of something weighty and serious occurring in the deep, dark nothing of the Empty, but there are no specifics.
With a wave of misery, Dean realizes the real reason Sam doesn’t want to talk to him. In his djinn dream all those years ago, he’d had to kill himself to escape, against the urgings of everyone around him, Dream-Sam most of all. If it was just about Dean being an asshole, surely it would be
Not this time.

Still, they work.

“Want to go decorate a tree?”
He knew the answers were there, though, printed upside-down at the bottom of the page. So Dean worked a little harder at learning to read. He pretended like he was worse at it than he really was, both so his mom would keep reading aloud to him, and so that during their riddle-sessions, he could climb into her arms between her body and the book and catch just enough of the answer (a keyword, maybe) to act like he’d come up with it himself.
IT WILL BE HARDER.
It does, apparently, matter to them, because an unpleasant-sounding murmur passes among the gathered group, and then everyone stops talking altogether.
But now, with Cas like this, the part of him that decided it was for the best to not go down this path is getting the absolute
“Fine, maybe you’re right,” Castiel admits to Dean, suddenly less than confident that they’d stand up to much scrutiny, spell or no spell.

“I don’t… own anything that requires a password,” Castiel says quietly, unsure of how else to respond.
is speculating.
of the few living angels, they realize there’s only one way to know, and that’s to find another angel and ask.
It doesn’t happen. Dean gets out of the car, setting foot on the new carpet of old leaves, and closes the door behind him.
that isn’t awful, about all of this.”
feels like he’s seeing in his peripheral vision pulls up out front of the diner, he closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose. His elbows prop him up on the table as he presses the heels of his hands into his eyes.
When he was Emmanuel, it happened, and that had been especially awkward. Without his memories, he didn’t understand it very well. All the people crying out to angels, to heaven, but every time that
Rob nods. “Sure does -- that’s not a half bad idea, see how things are going everywhere else. You folks seem like you came out alright at least.”
“It’s like how you put the magic back in the mountain, ‘cause it belonged there, ‘cause people need it there. You were right, and I just can’t stop thinking... We did good, but people need us,
The scope of the project was just too much for a few humans on a low budget, but there are few things more motivating to angels than the kind of duty-debt that they incurred when Jack’s will and Dean’s sacrifice were the only reasons they were alive and had a heaven to go home to.
Castiel frowns. “Have you got the room for that?”
Dean googles it. He doesn’t really get it, but if it’s helping, it’s helping, and he’s not going to talk shit.
And it got to be too much. Seeing Dean in the eyes of every brash, headstrong kid growing up too fast drained him. He learned the term
At Jody’s favorite bar, they make scribbles on napkins. Sam imagines a wall with built-in bookshelves, and a quiet place to read or work. After years in the bunker, Dean wants
Castiel cannot know what he
Of course Castiel had to lie about where he’s gone, to maintain the surprise. If either of them suspected anything, they didn’t let on. It’s impossible to know whether they’d believed him, or just decided to give him his privacy. Freed from the needs of sleep and food, it’s taken him about two days to find it: a stunning Balsam Fir, perfectly conical, full and dark and lovely, just the right height for the War Room.
Cas doesn’t jump in to help him out. He just stands there and watches, brow slightly quirked, as Dean flounders.
They fall asleep sticky and soothed and in the morning, are forgiven for the room rearrangement with a minimum of teasing -- largely due to Dean’s moment of thoughtfulness in leaving Sam his bag. Boulder’s not so bad, Dean thinks once they’re back on the road with the odd little town in the rear view mirror.
He’s famous for justice and arbitration. Perhaps his presence is a good thing. If it’s
Dean let out a breath that shook a little.
Eventually the room is dark except for the little lights blinking green and blue and red from Sam’s gadgets, The three of them bed down together under an overlapping assortment of covers. Positioned between Sam and Cas, Dean butts one of his heels against Sam’s ankle like a low-tech motion sensor, and one hand is clasped together with Cas’.
“How do I believe that?” Dean laments. “No monsters, Cas loves me… or he
That laser gaze turns away from Dean, back out the window.
She saved the world, and she mattered to Dean, and that’s been enough for Castiel to not mind the inconveniences.
“Can we really call ourselves
It’s a convincing argument, and the iron authority with which it’s delivered stops Dean’s brain working for a second, and is that a

“What if
A little crease appears on Sam’s forehead. “What?”
Dean had to pull away then, because of the laugh that overtook him. “Cas…” he couldn’t even talk, he had to catch his breath. “Cas, when I first saw you I thought you were some kind of weirdo lost traveling salesman or something, and I was
“Dean! We both know how this ends. Stop pretending. I don’t want that to be my last--” Sam stopped there, half because he couldn’t go on and half because he was being interrupted.
Everything is whisked away, as if the entire landscape was the illusion of a stage magician.
The… worst thing that’s ever happened to me, and you
He isn’t sure how long he was in there.
busy he was, always found time to tease him about it.
Still, Dean spits out, “Nope, too many cooks yadda yadda, we got this, just send over the mask spell, it’ll be fine” and hangs up.
There’s a kitchen knife in the dusty crevice between the toilet and the tub, and he’s not sure he
Lucifer clambered closer.
“Okay, how ‘bout we all refuel and get a little shuteye?” Dean suggests.
Dean picks up the pace, now. His feet beat against the snowy path, and all he can hear is the crunch beneath them and the steady rhythm of his own breath.
as fast as Cas can produce them. Were he a snake, he would unhinge his jaw and swallow the stories whole. He doesn't even care how self-centered he looks doing it. The writing is a thousand times more engaging than anything Chuck ever put to paper, with words used like watchmaker’s tools. It’s as cruelly blunt and precise and intricate and beautiful as Cas himself.
The glassy tablet device that displays the words is itself becoming an anachronism. Almost every human has long since switched to internal systems, nanoid swarms that live happily alongside neurons and erythrocytes and keratinocytes.
Dean hears. He tries not to think about anything at all, because there’s no way this thought-catching thing doesn’t go both ways, but it’s the old don’t-think-of-an-elephant problem and all of the sudden he’s remembering their kiss and feeling like he was an idiot and realizing that this whole situation is
Thank you for coming on this happy little stroll with me through the woods of my feelings, and sitting with me in this treehouse I built to sit in when the real show is stressing me out.
“Well, here y’are.” Dean gestured, a little gruffly. He rubbed the back of his neck. “All the sudden lookin’ at it, I get the urge to call you something a little more royal than ‘Cas.’”
