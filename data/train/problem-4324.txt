He can feel it all around him, wrapping itself around him, tight against his skin. So he stands there in the embrace of Cas’s love as he searches the being in front of him with his eyes. Searching. When he finds what he’s looking for, Dean smiles as his eyes lock with the two bright blue eyes hidden somewhere in the light of the being.
that one can’t really compare it. I believe the term often used is “soulmates”, but not even that is enough of a word for what you are to each other. It wasn’t really hard to see. I might not have really understood you two, I never knew one without the other, but when you told me how he was taken, I saw it all perfectly clear, like a bright star on a dark and empty night sky.»
A young Dean Winchester sits by the lake behind their house, quietly watching, waiting, as for the sun to rise, painting the horizon in beautiful colors. Smiling at the silence, he waits.
«We´ll make up for them.» With a last quick kiss, Cas takes Dean's hand again leading them down the hall to the kitchen.
«We´re all ready.» Charlie and Eileen come through the door, both beaming with joy. «Are you ready, Dean? Cas is waiting for you.»
“Hm? Yeah. Yeah, sure.” Still distracted, Cas picks up a book and pretends to show interest in what story the pages are telling.
Their bodies moving against each other, as their lips keep exploring their bodies while their touches burn hot against the other's skin.
just screws you up and makes everything so much harder. The last thing he wanted to do was go hunting. Dean just felt done with hunting. He felt ready to just... stop. He said he wouldn’t go anywhere hunting now, but deep down he knew he meant he didn’t want to anywhere hunting after he’d gotten Cas back either. He had been thinking about his future for a while now, and what he wanted to do, now that the big-bad-God was gone.
At the sound of his name, Cas fully opens his eyes as he sits up. Confused and wild, the blue eyes searches the void around them, before they finally lands on him. Locking their gazes, Deans face breaks into a bright smile, as tears start streaming down his face.
«I know it's not Dean. And you know I know that.» At that, the figure starts to change. A black emptiness takes hold of Dean's body, and then the Shadow is standing in front of Cas.
«I just... just promise me. Don’t go on a hunt while I’m gone.» He finally meets Deans eyes, and Dean is almost shocked by the fear he can see in them.
Happy New Year everyone! 2020 has been a shitshow I never thought could exist, but we got canon Destiel (and two new ts albums - where one clearly confirms heller!Taylor) - something I never thought I would live to see.
Cas doesn’t know why he would wake, because sometimes he woke up alone in the quiet darkness. But other times the Shadow would come to wake him.
“What?” Cas isn’t sure if Dean heard him, but judging by the small smile he gives Cas, he probably did.
Dean closes his eyes, shutting out the world and retrieving into the shell he has become. He can still hear his voice in times like this. In the quiet. In the dark.
“Okay, come on angel. Let's get you some rest.” Dean says as he leads him down the hall towards the bedroom he’s been assigned, but never really used. But then Dean passes Cas’s room, leading him into his own.
“Morning, boys.” She smiles brightly, her hand gently running through his hair as she sits beside him.
He remembers the year in purgatory, how he spent a whole year fighting monsters and whatever else he faced there. The memory of longing for his best friend, having to find him and keep him safe. He was an angel, and still, Dean was determined to protect him with his life. It was sometime during that year in purgatory, that Dean started to really think about what his feelings for the angel meant. He spent a year looking for the angel, but also for an answer that had always been right in front of him.
Dean never really believed he’d get to experience any of this. He might have dreamed of it, wanted it for so long, but he’d never dared to hope for it. And now… now he had everything he’d ever dreamed of.
“Morning, little sis.” Dean smiles at her before once again stealing Cas’s fork to fill his mouth with too much food. Sam can’t help but smile at his brother. It’s even in the way they eat their breakfast.
«You know Dean, I will always be here, and you don’t have to say anything until you feel ready to talk to me. And if you don’t want to say anything at all, that’s okay too. I know you and Cas have each other, and that’s all I need to know. That you are happy. So take your time. I know how it is, me and Eileen, we took our time too. So, find each other, learn each other. I’m here, always.»
«You know, Dean. We could just let him sleep in here with us.» Cas smiles down at the dog on his lap.
But as Dean enters the room, Cas close by him, he curses his brother at the sight of the empty bed in front of him, Sam snoring on the one beside it. Because, behind the wall to his left Dean can see a third, empty bed. His stupid brother had, without doubt, asked for a room with three queen-sized beds, just to annoy him.
Exhausted, they sit there in silence, taking in the sight of each other, the dog sitting between the two of them clearly enjoying being cuddled by them both until they hear footsteps approaching them.
“Send us back. I won’t ever return here. I promise. If you send us back.” In his lap, Cas stirs. Awakening, slowly, as the Shadow no longer holds any power over him. “I’m human. And without his grace, so is Cas.”
Dean lay awake for a long time before he finally fell asleep. Cas had fallen asleep almost right away, his face turned towards Dean, breathing softly. They lay close, but not touching, although Dean wouldn't have minded if they did. He looked at Cas for a long time, memorizing every inch of his face, tempted to move closer, but not brave enough to actually close the small distance between them. He finally fell asleep to the sound of the man beside him, breathing softly, warmth radiating from his body.
The world didn’t matter to Dean that night, and it still doesn’t. The world was literally dying in front of them. But that didn’t matter to Dean, because his whole world had already died that night. Dean lost his big win. Lost his best friend. Lost his happiness, a happiness he didn’t even know he could have. He watched his greatest love get taken from him right in front of his eyes, and he could do nothing about it. He had lost his angel.
being able to see it on the others.» He laughs at the pretend annoyed look Dean gives him. «I don't care about who you are with. But I’m glad it's Cas because he’s like a brother to me. I only care that you are happy. Loved. And if it's one thing I know, it is that
Cas moves to follow the others from the room, but as he starts moving, the exhaustion takes over and he sways on his feet, falling into Dean who was walking behind him.
Somewhere in the universe, a figure in the shape of a grown man with light blue eyes stops the world around them. For just a second, the blue eyes shift color, as the irises shine gold. Closing their eyes, they let out a long and heavy breath, hand lifted to rest above their heart. As they open their eyes again, after a long moment, the blue eyes are glassy, a sad smile lingering on their lips. No one around the figure of a man notices how their world stopped for a moment, everyone just going on with their lives. The man is gone. No one notice.
«You’re kinda scaring me, Sammy.» Dean can feel the fear creeping up his spine, a wierd feeling takes hold, as if he knows what his brother means. A hunt that could go wrong. A hunt that will go wrong, if he goes. Dean can’t explain it either, but it’s written in Sam’s eyes. It feels so real that Dean promises his brother, «I won’t go hunting while you’re away, I promise.»
Dean is about to move closer to Cas, but the Shadow moves quicker. Suddenly the other `Dean’ is standing behind Cas. And as he places his hand on top of Cas’s head, the angel collapses at their feet.
The words are written in an old-fashioned beautiful handwriting, the kind only old people use these days. The sight of those two words makes him freeze, and when the turns to the next page after a long moment the two words there makes him drop the book:
Sam runs across the library, Eileen following closely. Sam calls for his brother, but there are no answers. The kitchen is dark and empty as he bursts through the door. He only takes a second to look around, before he’s running again. The huge room they’ve been talking about turning into a living room hasn’t been touched since they left. Sam´s heart is beating faster for each step he takes.
Dean´s prayers searching, always finding Cas, no matter how far apart they were. Even when Dean was praying to him, to Cas. Not the angel Castiel, but
But at least, we have lots of fanfiction to get lost in, and that helps a little. It has really helped me to write this story, and it might not be perfect or how things should have happened, but for me, it's the happy ending I wanted... They got everything they ever wished for, the lives they deserved. Dean doesn’t die on a hunt, he dies of old age. Cas isn’t killed off because of his feelings, he lives a long life of love, able to express his feelings every single day of his life. Sam isn’t left alone, unhappy, and sad for the rest of his life, he lives a long and happy life, as he deserves. (And no, he doesn’t have a son named Dean, because the real Dean never died an awful death...) Eileen doesn’t just disappear and is forgotten, she lives a long and happy life filled with love, as she deserves.
Oh my… Even the way they say that phrase sounds like him. Jack is so much like Cas that one wouldn’t believe anyone claiming him to not being his kid. Although Cas isn’t the one who sired Jack, he is more of a father to Jack than anyone else. Cas is, and always has been, more of a father to Jack than John ever was a father to Dean.
«It’s adorable.» He smiles into the kiss, raising his hands to run it through his beautiful black hair. «It's part of you. It will always be a part of who you are, even if you’d remove it all. But it’s part of you, and…» he gently kisses him again, pulling them even closer.
«No, it doesn’t seem like I am.» Nervously rambling, he looks up at the lamp hanging from the ceiling, now dark and empty. «If you’re bothered by it, I can just remove it all. It’s such a small part that, yes I am fully human, but there's still is a little grace left, like the size of a grain of sand. If you don’t…» Cas doesn’t finish as Dean closes the distance between them to silence him.
As soon as they move from their place, removing the warm jackets, the cold November morning sneaks in. Their bodies stiff from their night spent in the back seat, and probably partly because of last night's activities. They dress as fast they can’t so the cold won’t take too much of a hold on them. Dean moves over to the front seat, getting comfortable in the passenger seat. At the questioning look Cas gives him, he smiles brightly as he pulls his jacket close across his chest.
That’s all he had wanted to do since he got him back. Hold him close. Never letting go. He’d finally said the words that had been eating him up the past months, but it all still felt so new and raw. This thing between them. They had to learn each other all over again, figure out what this was.
«I could leave if you want me to.» Dean teases as he pushes Cas towards the bed, his arms holding him tight against his own body.
“Look at me, Cas!” This time he does. He takes to study Deans eyes, his blue ones searching for something.
I´ve been obsessed with the idea of Cas not being able to control his grace when kissing Dean so I just had to write a short chapter with it. Thank you so much for reading!!<3
Cas was watching some movie on the tv, but his eyelids got heavier and heavier. Studying his beautiful face, Dean smiled as he just sat there and observed how the angel was slowly falling asleep. He didn’t know anyone could get this much happiness from watching another slowly falling asleep. But he did. And he couldn't stop smiling, feeling his own eyelids slowly wandering downwards.
The empty bed is a welcomed sight as Dean and Cas enter their motel room, hand in hand. Dean smiles at him as he leans in for a quick kiss, pulling him towards the bed as they remove their pants and shirts, leaving only their boxers. Crawling under the covers they settle as close together as they can get, leaving no space between them.
After long moments of silence, as Sam was about to say something to him, Dean's phone started ringing. Pulling it from his pocket, the name on the screen made him stop breathing.
“Yeah you, stupid. I’ve spent all day in the car trying to find the courage to tell you. And then you come in and steals my moment.”
Slowly, Cas’s eyes becomes clearer as he becomes more aware. Turning his body so that it’s facing Dean, their eyes are leveled and Cas seem to actually see Dean for the first time.
When Dean wakes again some time later, almost fully rested, and finds that his hand had some time during his sleep, reached out and taken Cas’s hand.
«They do say that love blinds. And you two are proof of that.» At the look Dean gives them, Jack only smiles at him. «Everyone who knows you, everyone who has seen you together, have read your feelings for each other as if they were written on your face. But not you. You two blind yourself with the fear of rejection. The fear of being abandoned by the one thing that is keeping you afloat on a dark and stormy sea, when really it´s nothing to fear at all. There is no storm. The sun is shining brighter than ever. The sea is calm.»
When they went into town yesterday, he and Cas had eaten lunch at a diner, sitting close to each other, their hands knitted together on the table. Smiles as bright as the sun, if not brighter, when they looked at each other. No one knew them there, so when Dean leaned over and kissed Cas, no one even spared them a second look.
«Jerk.» Although the word sounds rough as Sam changes his shirt and lays down on the other bed, Dean can see the smile that is playing on his lips, so without another word, he turns back to Cas, pulling him closer as he throws the blanket over them both. «Please spare me the noises, I really want to sleep tonight.»
Now, by a look in Dean´s eyes, and the way he said his name, Cas knew this was, once again, the Shadow who had come back to torture Cas.
The nickname still made Dean chuckle, even sometimes painting his face red as he smiles at the ground. Turning around in his arms, Cas face him, pulling him closer. Dean locking him in an embrace, reaching his hands up Cas’s back, trailing their way underneath his white and black plaid winter jacket, and then finding their way under his dark green hoodie. Or, Dean's hoodie really. After becoming human, Cas had been living in them, almost refusing to wear anything else. He loved Dean´s soft and slightly oversized hoodies, especially when they smelled like Dean. So, he´d sometimes make Dean wear them first, and Dean seemed to really like Cas´s T-shirt, so it was a fair trade.
Then, from the nothing, comes a ripple, a shift in the not-air, something physical despite nothing changing.
Dean nuzzles at the line of Cas’ stubble, enjoying the catch and rub of it against his own skin. Cas pets the back of Dean’s neck, fingers warm and comforting.
It’s not exactly unusual. And Dean has spent his own fair share of time staring at Cas’ lips. He’d spent a year in Purgatory thinking about this, about Cas, about what he wanted from Cas. He’d fallen asleep with his head in Cas’ lap, on his chest, with Cas’ hands wrapped around him protectively. He’d thought about kissing Cas, about what Cas’ lips would feel like against his. He’d wanted to do it. Had planned on it, once they’d gotten out. But Cas hadn’t come with him. Hadn’t wanted to.
Cas gasps, pushing his hips into the touch. His back arches, and his wings spread out with it, all six of them rising, separating. They’re fucking glowing from within, the blinding blue-white of grace curling around each feather, in between them.
“Oh,” Dean says, unsure how to respond, but still too relaxed to worry so much about it. “C’mere,” he says, grabbing Cas at the ribs and clumsily trying to pull him up even more.
Cas kisses back to Dean’s mouth and Dean murmurs happily into it. He never wants to stop kissing Cas. Every time he pulls away he sees Cas’ face, tearstained, feels him pushing Dean away, remembers the feeling, the words, crawling up his throat choking him, rendering him helpless as Cas disappeared in front of him. Dean had thought it was too late. That he wasn’t going to get the chance to ever kiss Cas at all. So he fits his lips to Cas’ again, quickly becoming familiar, but not boring, no, Cas is a good kisser, enthusiastic and sweet, mouth open for Dean, letting Dean sweep his tongue in and taste the happy noises that Cas is making too.
Cas presses his mouth into Dean’s skin a little harder, presses his thumbs in harder too. “I would like that very much, Dean,” he says. He goes back to kissing Dean’s skin, peppering kisses along the base of his spine and across his ass. There’s a soft rustling sound and the sheets shift a little and then Cas takes one of his hands away.
Benny looks at him curiously, but he doesn’t say anything further. Eventually Dean is able to get his breathing back under some semblance of control. He’s anxious, waiting for Benny to try and talk about it, but he never does, and eventually Dean is able to relax into some semblance of sleep.
“It’s just a little blood,” Dean says. “I’ll be fine.” And then he cuts. He cuts deep enough, precise enough that the blood starts pouring from the veins in his arm, thick and red, iron and earth and human. He steps closer to Cas and smears his arm across Cas’, making sure to get it on the bared skin of Cas’ hand. He wraps his bleeding arm around Cas’ neck and doesn’t let go.
“Dean,” Sam says, “those…I thought those times were all jokes. I didn’t know you really were…if I’d known that you were actually into dudes I wouldn’t have-”
The sight always takes Dean’s breath away, as beautiful as it is inconceivable. In the back of his mind Dean can feel Cas, calling his attention back to their physical bodies. Dean does, but he’s immediately distracted again.
Gradually, things start to change. It’s as if the air, or lack of it, that Dean is moving through has started to thicken. Each step feels heavier, more difficult. Abruptly, Dean is exhausted. His very soul feels like it’s been drained. The urge to lie down is strong, too strong.
Cas comes without warning, just a cry and a rush of air around them, a physical force that rattles the bed and all the things Dean has up in his room.
. It’s a lot to take in. “I, uh, took some liberties with your form too,” he admits, hoping it will make the guilty expression on Cas’ face go away.
“What would you think,” Cas asks, licking the shell of Dean’s ear and making him shiver, “if I got a piercing?”
“Human terms are so limited,” Cas says. He sounds so pouty that Dean snorts. “The scale of them is the same,” Cas continues. “My true form is quite a bit larger than this one. So are my wings.”
Cas kisses Dean’s skin again. “I know,” he says. There’s the quick, cool press of teeth as he smiles.
“Dean-” Sam starts, probably to tell him how stupid that lack of a plan is, but Dean talks over him.
Cas has the gall to continue to smile at him. “I had just held your soul against my very being,” he says. “We had just been entwined. I was attuned to you, by that point. It was very hard not to.”
He can’t quite get enough air to make a noise, which is good, because he’s pretty sure it would have been a kind of wailing noise that he would have never been able to live down.
Cas’ fingers are pressing deep bruises into the skin of Dean’s ass where he’s holding him open, and he’s making all sorts of noises, grunts and groans, wet and muffled.
Dean lets himself freak out for a few seconds before rallying himself. There’s still a case to work.
Dean’s had his fair share of sex, most of it good, but nothing compares to fucking Cas. The heat of it, the intensity, the way Cas responds to Dean’s body.
Cas growls in response and slips the fingers of his other hand under the band of Dean’s jeans. It’s a tease, nowhere near enough contact.
He treats Cas’ fingers like he would his cock, alternating soft sucks with long ones, hollowing his cheeks for suction, flicking his tongue at the bottom of Cas’ fingers, wrapping it around the sides.
Cas makes a pleased noise, muffled of course by Dean’s ass, and Dean’s next breath is stuttery, broken.
Cas accepts the kiss happily enough, opening his mouth, yielding to Dean’s tongue, draping his hands over Dean’s shoulders and sliding his fingers beneath the stretched collar of Dean’s worn t-shirt, stroking the skin beneath it.
“There are some perks to being an angel,” Cas says, pouring the lube into his hand. He coats his fingers with it and then slides them back. Dean can’t see, not from this angle, but he can tell by Cas’ gasp and the way his spine goes straight when he’s started fingering himself.
“Well, w-what broke the connection?” Dean asks, because something had to have worked. Cas had hesitated, with his blade ready to deliver a killing blow. He’d stopped, and healed Dean instead.
It makes Dean blsh, he can feel it, warmth spreading across his cheeks and the tips of his ears. “Sweet talker,” he says. It’s not as easy for him to say sweet things as it is for Cas, but he tries to make the effort. “Cas, I-ah!” He trails off as Cas hits his prostate, watching Cas grin, teeth white in the darkness.
“Dean, this is stupid,” Cas says, voice low and mean. Which is why Dean hadn’t told Sam or Jack about it. Coming from Cas though, Dean knows now that it means he’s worried, and it makes him smile a bit. “You told
Dean groans. The stretch feels good this time, and Cas loosens his hand a little, letting Dean fuck himself on his fingers. “Oh, fuck, yes, Cas,” Dean gasps.
Dean pulls back to look at Cas’ face. Cas doesn’t look as blissed out as he expected, he instead looks…shy almost, uncertain.
Cas trails down to Dean’s navel, sucking and tonguing at Dean’s bellybutton, which makes Dean snort a little and squirm a bit. He can feel Cas smile against the soft skin of his stomach. Cupping his hands around Dean’s hips, Cas noses at the hair at the base of Dean’s cock again, and, what do you know, Dean
“Hey,” he says, relaxing back into Cas’ hold. “You know if you really wanted to you could use your mojo to heal it up so you can bite my ear like you so obviously want to.”
Dean looks at Sam, who is staring, open-mouthed. “Don’t, Sam, not now,” he says. “We gotta go, yeah?”
So he keeps shoving his ass back, trying to get more, more of Cas’ tongue, more of Cas’ spit, more of Cas’ pretty little noises. It’s so much, Dean’s entire body feels stretched, flushed, sensitive and hot. The skin around his ass is burning, the exquisite, painful prick of beard burn on such sensitive skin. It’s proof, proof that Cas is there, that he wants Dean this badly. Dean feels strung out from it all, too much sensation and yet not enough, all of it focused on his ass, his arousal curling low in his hips, hot heavy, like his cock, still dripping, jerking with every pass of Cas’ tongue.
“Mm,” Dean says, feeling fucked out and stupid. “Fuck me, Cas, come in me, I want you in me, want you to come in me, stay in me, please, Cas.” He’s not entirely sure where the words come from, he’s had a lot of practice at dirty talk but it’s never been like this, instinctual, raw, and honest.
The rush is familiar and exciting all at once, leaving Dean overwhelmed and exhausted, unable to do more than just collapse on top of Cas.
“Fine!” Dean says. “Fine! I never told you because I learned real quick to shut up about it. You ever heard of a gay hunter? You wonder why?”
Benny doesn’t bring it up again when he and Dean are picking themselves up to keep going once more, or when they set off, so Dean figures he’s in the clear.
Dean works him gently through the aftershocks, kissing the skin under his lips until Cas’ hips stop twitching and his hands relax in Dean’s hair.
There’s a burst of light, so strong that Dean could swears he feels the waves of it. He closes his eyes instinctively, and throws his arm over them as the light pierces through his eyelids. It’s golden, and warm, and makes Dean’s heart pound and his breath catch in his chest. The air feels heavy with it, charged, powerful, but not scary.
The sudden lack of pain leaves Dean dizzy, breathless, shocked. His left eye opens and his right hand obeys when he tries to move it. Still on his knees, he stares up at Cas, no longer stiff and blank. Instead, Cas looks miserable now as he looks down at Dean.
The ritual of getting a beer after a good hunt is a comforting one, and even if it doesn’t make him drunk, the beer does make Dean feel loose and warm and flirty.
Before Dean can think about it too much, there’s another shift of the air, and the touch against his fingers disappears. The air settles, the energy dissipating, the pressure returning.
Jack nods. “There are things I have to take care of,” he says. “But I’ll be back. I have to ask you something, Castiel.”
Cas flexes his wings a bit, separating the three of them, letting Dean slip his fingers over the feathers, through them, in between the wings themselves. They’re thick, and
Cas’ mouth is warm and wet and open and Dean, content to let his eye shut again and be kissed by Cas, clutches at him, hands fisted in his coat. Cas’ stupid, ugly, unfashionable trench coat, the coat Dean had plucked from the water and kept safe in his Baby, the one Cas had draped over them both, a thin barrier against the harsh nights of Purgatory. Dean uses it to pull Cas impossibly closer, Cas’ leg sliding between his.
Then Cas gets his mouth around Dean’s right nipple and Dean arches hard, a cry escaping him. Maybe he
Dean’s next breath is too wet. “Fuck, Cas,” he mumbles. “I…you…I’ve wanted you so bad, for so long, man, I can’t…”
Cas does, and then his warm breath and his tongue are gone, but his hands remain, thumbs rubbing small circles into the meat of Dean’s ass. Dean can tell from the touch, soft as it is, that he’s definitely bruised, deep, throbbing bruises in the shape of Cas’ hands.
, and Dean wants this. There’s no reason it should be so overwhelming, why it should bring tears to his eyes.
“Why’re you in my dreams, Cas?” Dean asks, softly. He doesn’t dare speak too loud, give too much voice to the thoughts in his head. He’s afraid of sending Cas running again.
Everything is heightened when they’re connected like this. Dean can feel the weave of his pants, the blazing heat coming from Cas’ body, the humidity building in the air around them. He can hear the rain outside, plinking against Baby’s roof, splashing into puddles, striking the asphalt.
"All done," Jessica says, stepping away with a smile. She switches her gloves again and grabs a cotton ball, dabbing gently. “Now, the aftercare fairly straight forward.”
Dean exhales shakily to match. “Cas,” he sounds, his voice breaking again. He buries his face into Cas’ hair and tries to hang on.
Heat leaps in Dean’s stomach, reaching up to his chest, through his lungs and his heart. He reaches out, feeling up Cas’ thigh, the soft, warm skin, the skritch of his body hair, the firmness of the muscle underneath. “What were they?” he asks. “Your fantasies. What did you think about when you thought about me?”
Dean feels like his mind stops, except it can’t have, because Cas is still in it, inspecting the stupid trees it’s conjured up. “You...what?"
“Jerk,” Sam says affectionately. Then he sighs. “You know, you’re right. I really should have figured it out. Cas is the only one who can put up with you.”
“Cas,” Dean says back, and his own voice is lackluster in comparison, nothing beautiful or breathtaking, but Cas still smiles at him.
, despite the dangers lurking, despite the monsters hunting them. Maybe Benny has a point. Maybe there’s a reason Dean feels safer with Cas around, maybe there’s a reason he starts to feel like he could do anything, take on anything. Benny certainly seems to think so, because the look on his face is not only significant, but smug as well.
. Every. Single. Time!” Dean explodes, anger overtaking him. “Every time that something happens…or someone says something, you…you say I’m overcompensating. Or you fuckin’…give me shit about the fairies. You fuckin’ teased me about shit face Dick Roman! Fuck, Sam, I tried! You brushed me off when that golem guy…when I thought he was hitting on me.
Then Cas’ fingers open and his blade falls to the floor with a clatter. Cas blinks and lets go of Dean’s arm.
Nighttimes with Cas have their own ritual. Like the mornings, Cas will take care of any business he has to, but mostly he just bumps Dean playfully with his hips and gets in the way. He’s so sweet about it that Dean can’t even get mad at him. When he’s feeling especially horny he’s not shy about groping Dean and trying to usher him into bed.
Cas shifts, pressing a kiss to the tip of Dean’s dick, before he sits up and crawls over Dean’s body again. He sticks his hand out and suddenly there’s a bottle of lube in it, and Dean has to huff a laugh.
Cas was the first one Dean ever prayed to, the only being he’d ever had enough faith in. And Cas had believed in him in return. He’d believed that Dean deserved to be saved, always, from the first time they’d met, to his final sacrifice.
“Just in case,” Dean says. “Throw off anyone behind us.” That the move had jostled Sam about in his seat was just an accident, really.
“Go slow,” Dean says, running his own hands up and down Cas’ sides, mimicking what Cas had done to him earlier, slow, broad, sweeping touches.
Dean's so used to driving for days at a time that this drive, even the three hours that it was, seems short. He parks Baby on the street in front of an eclectic collection of storefronts. There's a second-hand clothes store, a tea shop, and an office supply store between them and the unassuming facade of the piercing parlor.
Dean opens his mouth and sucks his finger in, letting his eyes drift close. Cas’ finger takes like his skin, warm and salty, almost tingly with power.
Cas’ lips twitch. “This is a form you can understand. You may not…like what the rest of an angelic being entails.”
Jessica was right. Dean feels the pressure build at the top of his ear, and he feels it when it breaks through.
It does nothing to help steady Dean’s breathing. His heart is beating a wild rhythm in his chest and his lungs are just trying to keep pace with the blood rushing through his body. He can hear his heartbeat in his ears. He can hear the soft sounds of Cas’ breath and the slick sounds of his mouth moving across Dean’s cheek.
Cas nuzzles at the crook of Dean’s knee again and then rests his head against it. “May I touch you?” he asks.
Dean mouths at Cas’ neck again so he can hide his face there. Cas has said that before. Has promised Dean not to die, not to sacrifice himself. It’s always been a lie.
Dean had scoffed grumpily at him, but he is thinking that it might be nice to take Cas out after, maybe to some place better than a diner or a bar. Not that it would matter to Cas. Maybe they'll just find a nice deserted place to fuck in the Impala.
“Yeah, it's a human thing," Dean says with a shrug. "I gotta say, though, never really thought I'd live long enough to have one. Always figured something would gank me first."
Dean and Cas are still on the floor, Cas practically in Dean’s lap. Dean wants desperately to hold him close like this forever, still not quite believing that it worked, that Cas is back here, with him.
Dean comes with a cry that Cas swallows, tightening around Cas’ cock, leg trembling in his hold as he paints his stomachs.
Cas nods. “Your feelings for me right now. The longing, the desire, the love, it’s calling to me, pulling me close.”
Dean growls a little and drags his teeth up the column of Cas’ throat. Still, the only thing they’ve gotten off is Cas’ coat and his tie and this is already likely the hottest experience of Dean’s life.
Dean doesn’t know if it’s a conscious choice on Cas’ part, to have his body react like a human’s, like
Dean is dripping, Cas’ spit running down his ass, his own spit coming from his open mouth, panting desperately into a pillow, and his precome falling from his cock, puddling on the sheets below, making them sticky. It’s messy and so, so hot.
This close he’s treated to the up close and personal view of Cas’ throat working as he swallows, as he talks to the bartender.
Cas flaps them again in response, a little bit harder this time. It ruffles their hair, the sheets, the weapons on the wall.
“You sayin’ I shouldn’t distract you?” Dean says, teasing, as he runs the pads of his fingers up Cas’ hardening cock.
Dean tries to spread his legs wider, wants to sink down and let Cas fill him up. “You know,” he pants, “I do too, Cas. I-oh,
Dean’s nipple feels swollen and hot by the time Cas lets it go, sitting back and smoothing his palms over Dean’s pecs. Part of Dean’s mind grasps around desperately for some joke about boobs, but he can’t come up with anything.
Then Cas is back, again, and it’s not like Dean thought it would be, again. He doesn’t know exactly what he pictured for their reunion, definitely not hugs, he learned that the last time, but Cas simply obliterates a few demons and then ties one to a chair.
“Then what?” Cas prompts. He runs his big warm hands up Dean’s torso, his touch curious, all wandering palms and undefined patterns. “I would know if you had been injured.”
“It was you,” Cas says. “You broke the connection. Naomi couldn’t make me kill you because you love me.”
Cas pulls back, eyes dark and glittering. His wings shift behind him, fluttering, restless. “Dean,” he says.
But then he takes another breath, and the crypt is dark again. He blinks his eyes to refocus, sees Cas standing above him again, holding the tablet and looking down at Dean.
“I lost control,” Cas continues. “I could have hurt you,” he murmurs, gently running a finger over the lines at the corner of Dean’s eye.
“I love you,” Cas says, and it should be incongruous, with his finger up Dean’s ass, should sound insincere, something blurted in the heat of the moment. But it’s
Dean chokes on his own spit as he gasps. It’s overwhelming, too hot, too much, too good. He throws his head back and clenches his fists, drumming his heels against Cas’ back.
Dean grits his teeth and breathes in harshly, gripping tightly at the knife in his pocket. That, at least, is real. He’s real. It doesn’t feel like he’s taking in real air, but Dean can feel his lungs expand, can feel his chest rise and fall with the motions of breathing. He puts his left hand over his heart, curling it over the edge of his jacket. His heart beats beneath his palm.
Dean would know it was a dream even without having been told. The forest surrounding them is impossible; trees too tall to have leaves within grabbing height, too large to be so close together, yet Cas and Dean are surrounded by it all, the trees around them thankfully full of color and life, green moss underfoot and equally green leaves above, in touching distance even though they shouldn’t be.  The trees crowded together to create a comforting shelter of bark.
Carefully, Dean picked the headset up from the table, clearing the cords to one side and placing it over Castiel’s head like a crown. The spidering connectors slid along Castiel’s scalp, painless and small, cooled by the room. Dean leaned forward and the room filled with nothing but the sound of their breathing as he arranged the wires to fall in line around Castiel’s temples and forehead. He combed his fingers through Castiel’s hair, parting it to set the tips into place. “I’m checking for a good connection,” he murmured, his mouth close to Castiel’s forehead.
“Come on,” Dean reached clumsily for the beggar’s slumped form, praying he was conscious enough to haul himself out of the palace grounds. “You gotta get out of here before someone sees us.” The man moaned, low and aching, but he responded to the urgency in Dean’s tone. He took Dean’s proffered hand and gripped him with surprising strength, hauling himself upright and allowing Dean to sling his his arm over his shoulder. Chest tight and body singing with adrenaline, Dean dragged the vagabond to the forest edge.
Later, he would lay in bed, sleepless, and worry about that statement. If he’d “lost” his ability to speak in childhood, he wouldn’t have ever heard his own adult speech, in theory. How terrifyingly easy it was for lies to unravel with a single mistake. But Dean didn’t seem to question it.
“This chick cursed you when you were a kid, Cas. What makes you think it’s gonna go any better when you’re an adult? Cas!” Dean said, tightening his grip when Castiel tried to stand up. “Look, I’m sorry about everything. All my fear of magic and shouting at you and making you feel like shit— I’m better now, though.
As Castiel let himself into his apartment, their last kiss still warming his body with electrical charge, he finally slumped. If only letting go of his own past was that easy for him. He’d spent the evening reining himself in, letting himself enjoy Dean’s kiss - but not too much, lest Dean suddenly taste chocolate or raspberry when none was consumed and discover the truth.
On the third day, Castiel took the day off. He left his truck parked at the Comm and canceled his scheduled appearance for the lunch crowd at Bagly Park. He hauled himself out of bed early, unable to sleep, and spent the day trying to distract himself by cleaning out cupboards, emptying and scrubbing them. Several times, he’d end up staring into space, a sponge half-drying in his hand.
“Oh, I haven’t had a boyfriend in-- I’m not dating anyone.” Flustered, Castiel mustered up the facsimile of casual confidence and winked heavily. “If I accepted every proposal I ever got over my pies…” Castiel pretended to calculate an excessive number on his fingers.
Castiel watched him closely. He could no longer reach into a man’s mind and pull out intention, but there was something wide-eyed and earnest about this man. He held out his hand through the small window. Davies grabbed it with surprising strength, pulling Castiel closer to the door so his arm was completely out of the cell. Castiel started to pull away out of instinct when Davies said, “You’ll need a sigil to kill the tracking spell. Do you want it or not?”
He unlocked the awning and lifted it high, the pneumatic pistons gasping as he drew it open and propped it up. Inside, his display case held an array of his most attractive products, cookies neatly arranged and pies gracing little plinths behind the plexiglass.
Castiel ran his fingers in meditative strokes through Dean’s hair, reveling in the stillness of the evening. After four grueling months, they’d finally gotten a solid lead on Lucifer’s whereabouts. They were ready to go after him, having infiltrated the heart of Chicago and holed up in a long-abandoned condo near one of the demons’ supply drops. Tomorrow, they’d sneak onto a delivery truck scheduled for Lucifer’s compound.
Castiel’s answering smile was warm and sly, and his hands traveled cleverly down. “Oh, I do like to dance,” he said, and welcomed Dean home.
Dean slumped down through the bedding as though the effort of holding himself above the covers was too much. “I shouldn’t have done that. Lost control. I don’t know what came over me.” He laid a translucent hand over his face and flickered. “Dunno what happened.”
“Blood?” Dean was nearly inaudible. “Blood.” His already translucent body faded until he was barely more than an outline against the curtains. Wind picked up in Castiel’s bedroom.
Cas must get tired of his squirming because he pushes Dean to lie back on the bed, making eye contact the whole time, as he takes off the socks and the pants still clinging to Dean’s ankles. Dean lies there, propped up on his elbows, unable to break Cas’ gaze.
“Shh,” Cas says, soothing, but he starts stroking Dean’s cock to make up for it. Cas’ hands always feel so good, long fingers and big palms. His grip is loose, but his other hand is opening the tube of lube, and, okay, Dean reevaluates his opinion on the interruption.
"Great,” Dean says, shaking her hand. "I'm Dean and this is Cas, he's my..." Dean trails off. He's introduced Cas as his friend before, as his associate. But neither are good enough anymore. But "boyfriend" sounds silly, like they're in the eighth grade. "Partner" feels wrong too. Cas is his partner, but so is Sam.
“Love you, Cas,” Dean says, looking into Cas’ blue, blue eyes as Cas gasps and shudders, thrusting minutely into Dean’s fist.
Dean kisses him. He can’t not. He wants to taste Cas’ smile, he wants to know everything about how Cas tastes, not just his mouth, but his skin, his sweat, if Cas does something so human, and god, his come. Jus the thought of it makes Dean dizzy.
“I love you,” he murmurs in Cas’ mess of dark hair. He falls back asleep to Cas’s fingers tapping out the rhythm of his heart.
it, both his vocalization, pressed together as they are, but also the feeling of his grace, sweeping out across him. Beside them, the lamps repair themselves and click on again, glowing softly.
“What will it do to me?” Dean asks. Part of it is because he’s supposed to. It’s hard to care overmuch about what might happen to him. He doubts there’s any kind of eternal celestial torment that could be worse that the hole Cas ripped open in his chest.
Dean’s too angry to care. “You keep whinin’ about how I never told you, but…other people figured it out, man. S’not my fault you thought they were all just jokes. Dunno why you thought it was funny, neither.”
Dean’s never been touched like this before, but it’s not unpleasant, so he lets Cas do as he likes, tasting the sweat on Dean’s skin, exploring the textures of it, Dean thinks. Cas’ hand rubs around the ball of Dean’s ankle, gently soothing, as he bites experimentally into the meat of Dean’s calf.
He looks ridiculously sexy in his rumpled shirt and Dean has to kiss him again, pressing back into Cas’ space, their hands still entwined.
Cas pulls back, just a bit, shifts his weight on his knees. His hand disappears between their legs and Dean’s breath catches in his chest, his heart hammering. This is it. Cas is going to fuck him. Cas is going to put his dick into Dean’s ass. Dean’s mind is buzzing with it. It’s been years. And never like this, face to face, never with his skin hot and tight, with his cock painful with arousal against his stomach, with his lips full and throbbing from kisses, with a big, warm, steadying palm petting his right hip. “Cas,” he gasps, voice tight with emotion.
Arousal curls hot and deep in Dean’s gut. “Yeah,” he says, reaching up, tracing Cas’ jaw in one hand, running the other through his wings again.
, humming again, swallowing, until Dean can’t take it anymore, until his legs are shaking and his chest is heaving and his cock has softened.
He’s never come without a hand on his cock, never even thought about it, but he’s pretty sure this is how it feels. “Oh, fuck, Cas, stop, stop, you gotta, ungh,” he pants desperately.
It takes several moments of the stillness afterwards for Dean to feel like he can move. Slowly, he unclenches his hands, flexing his fingers. He threads them through Cas’ mess of hair, stroking, petting.
“Dean,” Cas gasps. It drives Dean crazy, the way Cas is always saying his name during sex, his voice breathless and reverent. It never fails to make Dean burn hot with a combination of pride and belonging. Cas is a worshipful, holy being, and though Dean is just a man, he’s the man Cas has chosen to devote himself too. It’s overwhelming, to be the focus of such angelic intent, but Dean loves it, basks in the feeling of being loved by Cas, even when it makes his heart pound.
Cas groans and cups his left hand around Dean’s left hip, holding him steady. His right hand returns, tell-tale slick. His first finger slides easily into Dean’s ass, already loose and wet from Cas’ tongue.
Dean snorts, but it’s not amused, it’s harsh and ugly. “What-the-fuck-ever,” he grumbles. “Thought you were supposed to be smart.”
Dean groans into Cas’ mouth. It feels so right to finally be kissing Cas, tasting him, breathing him in.
“Why?” Cas asks. He must have put the tablet somewhere, the pockets of his coat, or a pocket in the dimensions or whatever, because his hands are suddenly free, his left spread out across the center of Dean’s chest, his right coming up to cup Dean’s face.
Cas slips his finger across Dean’s tongue, runs it over his teeth, catches his lower lip, pulling it down before leeing it pop back up, Cas’ finger continuing its way over Dean’s chin, down his throat, leaving a warm trail of Dean’s own spit.
Cas smirks at him. "If you preferred a different label you should have said something," he says easily.
“You let me in,” Cas confirms. He reaches out, two fingers, hovering just above Dean’s head. “I could remind you.”
“There’s a lot of work to do,” Jack says, turning to Cas. “I could use some help.” He extends his hands, fingers overing in the air between him and Cas. “Will you help me?” he asks.
“Yeah?” Dean asks. He’s looking at Cas’ cheeks, which are red now with arousal. He wants to see if Cas’ skin is hot under his flush.
“That one is good,” Dean says, pointing to a rod that’s silvery and shiny. It reminds him a bit of Cas’ angel blade, but that thought he keeps to himself. “And uh, this stud here. That matches.”
Dean nods. “Fuck yeah," he saygs. It's weird, to be so happy, so thrilled, with a decision of his. To not be calculating the consequences.
"I'm going to clean your ears, then make a mark in pen where the piercing will go. You can take a look and tell me if you like it. Once you're satisfied I'll go ahead and put the jewelry in, alright?"
Cas leans in this time, mouth soft and sweet on Dean’s lips before his tongue sweeps out, hot and wet.
Then there are gentle hands on him, helping him sit, and the library of the bunker swims into view around him. “Oh, thank fuck, it worked,” he says.
is something that had lodged itself in Dean’s head the moment he’d heard it, the first time he’d heard Cas’ low gravel of a voice. At the moment, he’d tried very hard not to think about what that meant. That Cas had seen him in Hell, had seen what he had become. That Cas had touched his rotten, ruined soul.
“We’ll start with the easier one," Jessica says, crossing to Dean's right. "You're going to feel a little pinch. Now breathe in."
Dean catches himself with both hands on Cas’ abs, grunting as Cas fucks up to meet him halfway on every stroke down.
He thinks about Cas. Terrifying and imposing in a barn, taking fire and bullets and a knife like it didn’t even matter. He thinks about how Cas had understood him immediately. He thinks about Cas tilts his head when he’s thinking, the way he squints when Dean was particularly perplexing in his humanity or his pop culture references. Thinks about how Cas had always let Dean touch him, move him around, like he wasn’t a massive being of celestial power. Thinks about all the moments when they stood a little too close together, those little moments when Dean had thought
“Fuck,” Dean agrees. Because Cas is hot, his hair clumped and sticking up with sweat, his skin flushed, all the way down his chest. His lips are red, like he’s been biting at them. His eyes are glowing, the bright blue of his grace shining through. “Kiss me, Cas,” Dean demands.
His ears are red in the mirror, standing out. But glinting in the light is the metal. It's subtle, but they're there. Dean is changed, marked, and it was his choice this time. "It's great," he tells Jessica fully meaning it. "Thank you."
checking,” Sam points out. “There’s no one following us. And you’re not getting out of this conversation.”
They should all get up, probably, the four of them kneeling in a mess of papers scattered from the rush of the portal, spattered with Dean’s blood, but before anyone can move Jack is pressing against Dean’s chest, arms spread in an awkward kind of four way hug, and Dean finally, finally, exhales.
“Why?” Dean snaps again. “You’re always fucking complaining that you know too much about my sex life.” He can’t tell Sam about the john’s he’s sucked and touched, desperate for cash. He can’t tell Sam about how Robin had sat with him on her bed and talked about how she’d also liked kissing girls, how gentle and nice she’d been when she asked Dean if he had ever thought about boys. He can’t tell Sam about Charlie, how she’d pulled Dean aside and said, “What men like, huh?” and winked, patting him on his arm. Sam finding out about Benny had already gone bad. And Cas…the thing with Cas makes Dean chest feel tight and his heart beat harder.
He doesn’t sleep well. It’s not a surprise; he’s never slept well. Not here in Purgatory, there’s something about it that makes him much too alert, as if he were on a hunt. Even though he’s the one being hunted. But Purgatory isn’t special. He didn’t sleep much topside, but even so, he’d slept more than he does down here.
“I need you,” Dean says again. “I love you.” Because that’s the truth of it, the truth of why Dean needs Cas, why he needs to find Cas, save Cas, keep Cas.
Dean opens his mouth for Cas, easily. Cas keeps it slow, languid, and Dean feels it in his head, in his heart, his blood rushing, pounding, unable to handle it.
“Yeah, just-” Dean pants some more, trying to get his body and his cock back under control. “I was about to come.”
him, that’s what it means, he loves Dean with his hair sticking up weirdly, and it’s all really starting to hit Dean again, that this impossible being has chosen him.
He still doesn't sleep (or eat, or shit) as much as Dean, so he's always awake when Dean falls asleep against him, and awake when Dean wakes up. And he follows Dean into the bathroom after, the two of them bumping and jostling. It's stupid and domestic and sickly sweet, but Dean kinds of loves it.
It’s good, but not enough. Cas’ touch is too light, his fingers not wide enough. Dean lifts himself higher, until Cas’ fingers are only just inside him. He hovers there, waiting, but Cas catches on quick, licking his lips and taking his fingers out. He smacks Dean’s ass as he passes it, all fucking casual, like it doesn’t make Dean dribble precome onto his belly.
Dean shrugs, unaccountably embarrassed. “I was thinking about you,” he says, reaching up to scratch at the back of his neck on instinct.
Cas sits up in bed, gently taking Dean with him. Dean props himself up on one elbow while Cas rolls onto his knees, facing Jack. Dean has the sense that there’s something more to their communication right now, something he’s too sleep-slow or too human to understand.
“Cas, c’mon,” Dean murmurs, pulling back just enough to speak. “I love you, we just went through this. I’ll find a way to kiss you even when you’re all firey energy.”
Dean is helpless against the urge to smile, though he tries to bury it in the pillow. “It’s, uh, not that,” he says.
“Fuck your deal!” Dean says. “Come on, Cas, what’s wrong? Do you not…you don’t want to come with me?”
Dean rolls his shoulders, shaking off the thoughts, squaring them. “It doesn’t have to be,” he points out.
Dean's stupid brain pauses again, confused over the sudden hostility. Then it clicks. She doesn't know. This girl has never met him before. She doesn’t know that Dean is brushing his fingertips against the back of Cas' hand deliberately, and she doesn't know that he's spent his life as a plaything of a god, that this is his first toddling step of freedom. "No, fuck, no,” he says quickly. "I don't mean, wait, no, I do mean." he stops and starts over. "I mean that I'm, uh...” He trails off again. The word feels weird in his mouth. He takes Cas' hand in his and lifts them so the girl can see. "I want the gay ear," he says, which is, frankly, nonsense. But the girl's demeanor relaxes immediately.
"No," Cas says softly, kissing his skin again. "I know how you love Baby. You'd never be unfaithful to her."
Cas’ eyes seem glued to Dean’s hand on his thigh. He licks his lips and Dean’s stomach swoops. “I imagined your cock,” Cas says. “I have never taken a cock. I would like to take yours.” He meets Dean’s eyes again, dark and intense.
Cas moves his head so he can nose aside the stretched fabric of Dean's shirt and press a kiss to his skin. "What are you thinking about?"
Cas chuckles and gives Dean a small smile that Dean is slowly realizing is one Cas gives when he thinks Dean is being cute. He’s been doing it for years.
Dean frowns at him. “Why...why would I forget something?” he demands, voice going harsher than he intends in a sudden rush of adrenaline. “Who...what...did something to my mind?”
Cas is stiff against him, and it’s awkward, and not at all what Dean imagined hugging Cas would be like. (He doesn’t let himself wonder about why he’d thought about it before.)
“Yeah,” Dean says. “Just thinkin’.” Maybe now that everything is over he and Sam could clean up their identities.
“Unless you deserve it.” Castiel’s deep sigh hissed into the phone felt like a fitting response, and Balthazar laughed. “Go on. Lay it on me. Oh, not you darling. Not yet.”
The office in the back room had been ransacked by an animal - or swarm of animals, Castiel observed after unseating another tangled nest of shredded papers from stacks of boxed files in the back. When he found what he was looking for, he let out a shout of triumph.
“And you’re not going there alone,” she said, her tone brooking no argument. “I can take care of myself, Cas. Trust me.” She prodded his knee. “And don’t you even think about going there without me. I’m already working on lining up a contact. Someone who knows about stuff that goes down at the bar.”
“Surely so.” Dean scrubbed at his chin. “Listen. There’s a footpath not far from here. You can follow that out and it’ll take you past the village. Me and my brother live out that way. Ask for Winchester, tell him I sent you, and he’ll give you a place to stay tonight and something to eat.”
“In the cage. I, uh, woke up just in time to see the floor close up behind him.” Sam gestured around them. “Thanks for saving me. I thought I could beat him and--”
Maltese was a magical city, after all, even if few dared to acknowledge it. By virtue of its charm, or a spell, or perhaps a collective will to both suffer magic and deny its existence at the same time, Maltese was a refuge from the wider world for the magically inclined.
The chill in the air that always accompanied Dean’s manifestation should have helped control his body’s reaction, but apparently Castiel’s signals had gotten thoroughly crossed. Cold meant warmth to him now. Familiarity and friendship and desire. Maybe this is why he confessed with a rough murmur, “You were in it.”
The side of the ship was remarkably smooth with shining bolts holding the ladder rungs in place. Detritus tumbled past them, falling from the top of the ship and smoldering even in the drizzle.
A long, slow frustrated exhalation was his only outlet. He lay there for a moment, holding the incriminating pie, before he got out of bed.
“You know it.” Dean’s gaze moved along Castiel like he was drinking him in. “I’m ready. Cas, I’m ready now.”
Laughing, Castiel pulled up the movie and as it played, started to eat. Dean sat next to him on the couch, the cold coming off of him like he was an ice carving. If…ice carvings had warm green eyes, an animated smile, and an unfair zest for the smallest trappings of life.
The kitchen dimmed as energy leached from the lightbulbs. In the sudden dark, the burner gleamed like a baleful eye, winking around the pan. Castiel dropped the spatula and backed away from the stove. “I’m sure Sam’s okay,” he said, fear spiking in his gut for the first time in weeks. Months.
Castiel squinted at his door, then to the window. Nobody ever used the buzzer, except for delivery orders, or drunk visitors confused by the street’s row of identical entries into the condo-style apartment complex.
“She made it again just before she-- Anyway, she was a terrible cook,” Dean said fondly. “But when Sam says the copycat pie I made was awful, you have no idea just how bad it was.”
Castiel gives in at last to the tug around his heart and lets it pull him the way it always has, back to Dean.
Castiel’s hands flew up. “Don’t. Whatever you’re going to say, just wait.” He pulled one of Dean’s hands into his, a move so immediately distracting that Dean was rendered speechless. “Dean, you shouldn’t be dead.”
They stayed until visiting hours were nearly over. Castiel held Charlie’s mother’s hand for nearly all of it, desperate to reach some sort of epiphany that might prepare him for the next day. When a nurse poked his head in to announce that visiting hours were nearly over, Charlie declared them done for the day.
“Dude, there were two sheep. That’s not a herd.” Dean sighed. “And yeah, that’s that only sheep I’ve seen this whole time. You sure this spell needs a fresh sheep heart? Plenty of ducks around. Maybe a seagull?”
When Dean finally reappeared two days later, it was late at night. Castiel lay in bed, failing to sleep. Dean flickered into view with that same gorgeously tragic half smile that knit Castiel into disastrous knots.
There in the barn, ready to kill Anna as quickly and dispassionately as possible, she’d managed to set him off balance with a simple kiss. A simple touch. It was as if she’d been reminding Castiel that he could never have that. A touch, a kiss. Those were human things. Weren't they?
Once he made sure Dean’s vision had cleared, Castiel turned back to the wheel. His knuckles burned white with tension. “You ready now?” he asked shortly.
Charlie nodded. “That biker bar with all the ‘book clubs.’ Yeah. Total front for covens. So did you guys end up discussing
He looked at his reflection in the window. His hair was unkempt and even in the poor image, Castiel could tell that deep shadows undercut his eyes. He looked terrible.
a later. Of course, Dean might follow through on his sleepy threat to just have them eat leftover pie for breakfast, in which case he might bring three empty pie plates home after all.
Castiel’s entire body felt like a vibrating guitar string on the verge of snapping and his skin prickled, expecting Lucifer to reappear at any moment and pull his spine out through his abdomen. He crossed the lawn into the wooded cover without dying. If Castiel believe in signs from God anymore, that would be a powerful one. Instead, Castiel recognized it as sheer, dumb luck.
: Also Sam’s only like an hour away. You can get back in plenty of time. Don’t even need to stay the night if you don’t want to?
Again, Dean’s gaze zeroed in on Castiel during their brief conversation and Castiel realized that he was watching his hand move over the keypad on his tablet. Apparently his pies were far less captivating than his assistive device. Castiel very carefully refrained from balling his hands into fists and hiding them behind the counter, forcing his fingers to appear relaxed. His palms began to sweat from the scrutiny.
Lucifer ambled over then, a look of delight in his eyes as he surveyed the imbalanced standoff. “Do you like it?” he asked them.
Mag grinned steadily now, a full Cheshire grin. “It’ll cost ya, handsome.” She glanced towards the table, to where their bags lay between them. “I hear you got some interesting goods you could stand to part with.”
Further from Detroit, Castiel was pleased to see that the shoreline of the lakes, while fenced in by trees and overgrown raspberries, was free of the tangled planks and metal that had barricaded the water near the city. Here it was almost pleasant in the half sunlight, as they crept down carefully under the lip of the trees to scan for ships that might belong to the mysterious Men of Letters.
As the spell flared a brilliant purple, they launched themselves from the rocking boat into the cold waters of Lake Ontario. Castiel managed a short dive, disappearing under the water and hoping it would cushion the blast for him. Above the surface, the spell flared like lightning and an explosion shoved at him like an invisible hand, propelling him helplessly into the black waters.
That hits, something deep and dark and painful in Dean’s chest. It burns, it hurts. He slams on the breaks, satisfied when Sam flies forward in his seat, the seatbelt catching him in his chest.
He stops walking and clenches his left hand around the edge of his jacket. He doesn’t deserve Cas’ love or his devotion. He knows that. Has known that.
knew that I…that I liked…and Charlie! You laughed your way through that one too.” Dean pants when he’s done speaking chest heaving and heavy.
Dean blushes, and is immediately embarrassed by the blush. His hands twitch on Cas’ shoulders, fighting the urge to cover his face.
There’s always a case to work. It’s been true Dean’s whole life, one case after another. Lock it up, move on. So he does. There’s always cases, and the bunker to explore, and Sam, Sam to look after, Sam to take care of, Sam who’s going to have to go through trials that Dean can’t take from him.
Dean takes his hands away from his face, and Sam looks so earnest, eyes big and open, his whole body open towards Dean, and fuck, he hates how hard it is to stay mad at Sam. His Sammy. “Whatever,” he says. “Just stop being weird about it.
Cas’ eyes move from Dean’s, looking down at the tablet in his hands, and then back up to Dean. “You,” he admits. “I did not want to hurt you.” He looks down again, and Dean realizes that this time he’s not looking at the tablet, but at Dean’s blood, still smeared across his knuckles.
“Suck,” he says, though he doesn’t have to. Dean’s mouth had dropped open from the first press of Cas’ fingers to his lips.
Cas lets Dean lead this time, lets Dean stick his tongue in his mouth, tasting more of him, glorying in the fact that he gets to kiss Cas now, that he hadn’t lost the change. That all those could-have-beens, those maybes, are in the past.
into Cas. He wants what Aaron was offering with Cas, he wants to take him out for drinks and kiss him over the table, wants to make out against the wall of a bar with him until they’re kicked out, wants to lay Cas out against the backseat of the Impala and undo his shirt buttons with his teeth.
Dean laughs a little and then he stares. Because Cas’ eyes are staring into his, earnest and dark. “Oh,” is all he can say, stupidly.
He even sleeps decently, when they stop to rest. He wakes up to find himself propped up on Cas’ arm, and is immediately embarrassed by both the position and the small circle of drool on Cas’ dirtied sleeve.
Dean thumbs at the head of his cock, just to see Cas’ hips flex, the muscles in his thighs bunch. “So fuckin’ pretty,” he drawls.
Cas, seemingly determined not to be outdone, scratches his way down Dean’s back again, until he hits the waistband of his jeans, where he just goes for it, shoving both his hands down Dean’s pants to grab at his ass.
Dean tilts his head around to look, and sure enough, the lamp that’s usually on his bedside table, that had been on, is now a mess of glass. So is the lamp on the dresser, and, Dean suspects, the floor lamp on the other side of the room. “Uh, yeah,” he says. “You did.”
“Dean!” Cas cries out, and the world glows blue-white, Baby shaking around them, the air crackling and popping with power.
and oh. Dean stops in the middle of the road, Baby humming beneath him, struck dumb by his own realization.
, doesn’t want to have to explain to Cas that he’s too old to get it up again. The humiliation of it burns in his mind, unpleasant and prickly, nothing like the warmth in his chest or the heat in his belly. But Cas is still looking at him, clearly confused. Dean swallows. “I’m human,” he tries.
humming deep in his chest as he runs his big, warm hands up Dean’s stomach. Dean’s abs aren’t as cut, as defined as the used to be, softened by time and beer and a steady supply of food, but Cas doesn’t seem to mind, switching to leading with his nails, scraping them down through the light hair on Dean’s stomach, leaving red lines in their wake.
“Sure, sure,” Sam says. He fiddles with the radio, switching it over to the tape deck. The volume is low, but Dean’s personal favorite Zeppelin mix is still in, soft familiar strains that relax Dean even further.
It's weird. Dean isn't nervous. He feels...excited. It hits him then, that getting his ear pierced isn't something that the Dean Winchester who Chuck wrote about would do. It's not something John Winchester would have ever raised him to do. It's unexpected. It's freeing. He looks over at Cas and grins.
Dean would retaliate, but it did get Sam to pretend to vomit, so he takes Sam's misery as a win. "Might wanna put on headphones, Sammy," he calls, already dragging Cas away.
Cas looks back over at him then, down his nose, imperious, looking for all the world like the other pompous, sticks-up-their-asses angels Dean’s met.
Dean wants to smirk, wants to be smug, but he’s pretty sure the smile he hides against Cas’ neck is fond and pleased. “Yeah?” he says. “I can make it feel even better.”
“No, sweetheart, I’m gonna ride you so hard you forget your own fuckin’ name,” Dean says, his voice more of a growl than even he expected.
wrapped around Dean’s. They stumble together down the hallway, both trying to lead and follow, bumping into each other. Each time their hips bump Cas looks over at Dean and smiles and Dean is helpless to smile back.
Dean’s cock jerks in his lap at the idea. He doesn’t quite moan, but only because his voice has died somewhere in his throat. He swallows a few times, and then clears his throat, feeling silly even as he does. “Yeah,” he finally manages. “O-of course you can,” he stammers. “Do that. Um. I like it.”
Dean averts his eyes again. It hadn’t been that bad, not really. The guy had used enough lube and had worn a condom, and he’d paid Dean well, and that had been all Dean had been looking for. He hadn’t even bled after. “It wasn’t,” he says.
Dean looks back at him, looks at the line of him, of Cas’ body, flushed but not sweating, human and not, at the same time. He’s riding his fingers in earnest now, hips rocking, wrist flicking, eyelids fluttering. Dean can’t bear to not be a part of it anymore. “Let me,” he says, putting his own fingers on Cas’ wrist.
Dean catches his smile in the mirror and laughs. "Nah, don't think I'm that desperate." He tilts his head a bit, considering. It's another cliché but..."Maybe I should pierce my ear,” he says out loud.
Dean blinks up at Cas, who is currently yanking his shirt off, and throwing it aside. “I want you naked,” he says, shoving his own pants and underwear down.
“I’ll come back,” Cas promises. He seals it with a kiss, a hard, quick press of his mouth to Dean’s, before there’s the rush of air and the sound of wings and Cas is gone.
Holy shit. Is Cas being…self-conscious? Dean doesn’t think that even once, in their entire acquaintance, Cas has worried about his appearance.
By the time Cas is back to Dean’s hips, kneading at the muscles of his ass, nibbling at the base of his spine, Dean is arching for it, panting into the pillow, too turned on to think too hard about Cas’ gentleness, at his attentions on Dean’s ass.
But that was…something else completely, something utterly different than the way Cas is looking at him, like Dean is some deep, unfathomable thing worthy of an angel’s attention.
Cas though, Cas obviously experiences the rain for itself. Dean wants that. He wants to see the world the way Cas does, delight in rain and honeybees and the miracle of the world spinning around them. So he shuts his eyes and tries. Focuses on the paths the raindrops make down his face. Takes in a deep breath and fills his lungs with petrichor.
“Cas!” Dean repeats louder. He steps closer to him, reaching his hand out. His heart pounds wildly. “Castiel! You turn around, and you fucking look at me!”
It’s Benny who pushes Cas, prods him into admitting that he’d fled on purpose, out of a misguided attempt to protect Dean. Dean overrides both their objections to his plan. So what if Cas is some kind of leviathan beacon? It all feels so much easier now that Cas is back at his side. Dean feels confident, sure, and he dismisses both Benny’s and Cas’ doubts easily.
When he looks at Cas, Cas is glowing, like Dean can see his grace, spilling out and surrounding him. But the light isn’t just the blue-white of grace that Dean has seen before, but a full rainbow of colors. The colors swirl and shift together, making the aura of light around Cas look like it’s moving, growing, changing, like it’s alive. Dean supposes it
Cas’ hands are everywhere, clutching at Dean, pulling him closer, even though they’re already pressed together from chest to foot. Cas grabs a fistful of Dean’s flannel at his waist and tugs on it.
“I’m glad,” Cas says. He fucks Dean easy and slow with his fingers, long thrusts in and out, until there’s barely any resistance. The third finger is thicker than Dean is used to and it makes him gasp.
Jessica’s touch is swift and professional, and soon enough she's poking at his ears with a marker. "There,” she announces. "Take a look and tell me what you think.”
Cas seems to instinctively understand when Dean has crossed the line into oversensitive, because he lets Dean’s spent cock fall from his mouth and crawls up Dean’s body, hovering over him.
“Thank you,” Cas says, and then his hands are lower, pulling Dean’s ass cheeks apart. He licks once, soft, a gentle pass of tongue.
, so it doesn’t. Cas uses sex as an opportunity, Dean’s noticed, to be romantic. He’d call it sappy if anyone else was around, but like this, the two of them wrapped up in each other, tucked away from the rest of the world, he can admit that maybe he likes that Cas just looks at him, and loves him, and wants to say so.
He gets it, and he rewards Cas by slipping his hands under Cas’ waistbands. Cas lifts his hips helpfully, so Dean can tug his pants down under his ass and free his cock.
Cas traces Dean’s face gently with one finger, his cheekbone, down into the lines of his stubble. “Beautiful,” he murmurs.
Cas wants this, biting his lips red, throwing his head back. “Dean,” he says, rapturously. “Oh, Dean.”
Dean exhales and lets his body relax to Cas. This is different, at least for sex, for Dean. Time had always been an issue with and Dad and Sam around, with another case to work, with a monster on the loose. Dean’s partners had by and large gone straight for it, for his mouth, his cock, his ass, with the occasional detours to places like his nipples, his hips, his balls. But Cas…Cas is simply pressing kisses up the line of Dean’s spine, from his midback all the way up to the spot between his shoulder blades, where he presses his teeth gently against the skin.
“Okay,” Cas says agreeably, and then his hands are between them too, tangling with Dean’s as he opens Dean’s jeans. Cas shoves Dean’s pants and underwear to his ankles with one firm push, and then he’s grabbing handfuls of Dean’s bare ass again.
He's saved from unpacking it when she pulls out a little tray. “This is our starter jewelry,” she says. “These,” she points, “are the industrials, and these,” she points again, “are the studs. They vary slightly in price.”
But Cas is pecking at his lips, ridiculous just a little bit, short sweet presses and Dean doesn’t want to remember anyone else, only wants to think about Cas’ stubble, only wants to think about the way Cas tastes, deep and bright all at the same time. Like liquor with lemon in it, or…something. Dean’s never been so poetic, even in his head with anyone else, but Cas is making his mind buzz, his blood thrum and sing.
Dean groans into the kiss and yields to it, to Cas’ questing tongue, to the fingertips likely leaving bruises over his ribs, to the arms pushing him back to lay on the bed.
Dean kisses him, sloppy, and only getting the corner of Cas’ mouth, but he’s too tired for much else.
Cas obliges, dipping down to kiss Dean, pushing his legs back up to his chest. The stretch burns, but it’s not bad, it adds to everything. Dean wraps his legs around Cas’ waist and digs his heels into his ass, trying to get Cas closer to him. Their cocks rub together and it’s so fucking good. Dean groans into Cas’ mouth and thrusts, bucking his hips hard.
“Fuck,” Dean says, because that’s nearly as overwhelming as hearing “I love you”. “You do, Cas, you do.” He kisses Cas again, before he can say anything else that his stupid little hindbrain screams is embarrassing, is weak and vulnerable.
“Nice to meet you Dean,” Jessica says, holding her hand out to shake. "I'm going to be piercing you today.”
Dean smiles into the pillow and his heart makes his chest thump with affection. With…love. It’s love. He loves that Cas is polite enough to ask first, and he loves that Cas, despite all his years amongst humans, still has his awkward, stilted, charming, sweet, weird fucking speech patterns.
“Alright then, sit back down," Jessica says. She's switching out her gloves and cleaning the jewelry.
Dean’s breath leaves him in an “oof”, but he doesn’t mind. Cas is warm and solid, even if he’s fucking heavy. Dean just keeps petting his hair.
“Uh, right, okay,” Dean says stupidly, because now Cas’ cock is there, long and red, standing up against his stomach, leaking already. He’s tried so hard, so fucking hard not to imagine Cas’ cock before, has failed as often as he’d succeeded. He wants it, badly. He wants
“Right,” Dean says. It’s simple, easy, his mind, just like him. Just a nice calming forest. Nothing interesting there.
“Yes,” Cas says, and Dean knows him so well, loves him so much, he can picture the small half smile Cas probably has.
,” Dean says. “And I like him, okay?” He’s seriously starting to consider jumping out of the moving car.
“Can’t wait to have your fat cock in my tight ass,” Dean continues. He plucks the lube from where it’s rolled to rest against Cas’ throat. With his other hand he opens his own pants and shoves them down his thighs. It’s tight, with his legs spread wide over Cas’ hips, but it just makes his arousal spark higher. He loves this. He likes all kinds of sex, especially with Cas, and as much as he loves being fucked thorough and slow and lovingly, there’s something
Cas pulls his hand back, but Dean’s fingers are still wrapped around his wrist, just like Cas’ are wrapped around Dean’s no longer broken one.
His third finger pulls out and Cas goes back to fucking Dean with just two. He fucks him deeper with them, up to his last knuckle, and crooks them.
Cas fluffs them up for him and Dean smiles, wrapping his pointer finger and his thumb gently around one of Cas’ feathers.
Cas continues to kiss down Dean’s arm, lifting his right arm as he does, until he gets to Dean’s hand, where he drops a kiss on the center of his palm, and then moves onto each fingertip.
Dean groans again. It’s almost too much, he can’t remember the last time he got hard twice in one night, especially not after such a good first orgasm, but Cas’ touch is doing it for him, his cock hot and heavy. Cas seems content to just stroke him, trying different grips, speeds, touches, trying to discover what Dean likes. They all make Dean gasp and thrust, so he’s not sure if Cas is actually discovering much. Apparently, Dean likes anything as long as it’s from Cas’ hand.
Cas opens his mouth on a gasp and sways forward, pressing his body up against Dean’s, the tablet crushed between them. Dean wraps his hand around Cas’ elbow and pulls him in closer.
. Cas had meant it when he said he wanted to experience Dean’s body. His fingers stroke up Dean’s underarms, dipping into the bend of his elbows, stroking at the soft skin there, while his mouth finds the spot behind Dean’s ear that makes it hard for Dean to catch his breath.
“No one,” Cas assures him, taking a few steps closer, his hands out. It’s such a human gesture, Cas must have taken it from one of them, and Dean relaxes, just a bit. “It was a dream.”
out of the moving vehicle instead. Dean clenches his jaw and his knuckles are white on Baby’s wheel. He can feel his temper bubbling, just under the surface, the instinct to
Dean flops back on the bed, not sure what to make of it. So few of his lovers have ever wanted to take their time with him, to go slow. He’s not sure how to respond. Except that the warmth spreading out from his stupid, pounding heart is expanding with the idea. “Okay,” he says. He wants to give Cas what he wants.
They don’t break apart until the burning in Dean’s lungs becomes hard to ignore. He’s going to have to work on breathing through his nose, because stopping to breathe when he’s busy kissing Cas is unacceptable. He tilts his head back and moans at the feeling of Cas’ lips on his jawline. Cas presses closer, flat chest and a bulge in his pants to match the one in Dean’s, the scrape of stubble against Dean’s skin where he noses at it.
Dean’s heart pounds. He knows when they’re close to Cas, he just knows. And then he breaks through the tree line, sees the river in the distance, and his heart is in his throat when he sees him.
He kisses Dean again, and Dean thinks he understands, just a little, what Cas is saying, because he feels loved when Cas kisses him like this, when Cas puts his hand back over Dean’s fluttering heart. Cas pulls back to continue down Dean’s body, mouth soft, worshipful as he kisses his way across Dean’s skin. And that’s what it is, Dean understands now. Worship. Cas is worshipping
“Cas,” Dean says, taking Cas’ face in his hands, again, kissing him, again. He couldn’t care less about his stupid human need to breathe, but apparently Cas does, because he pulls his lips off of Dean’s again, as though he could hear Dean’s lungs protesting.
Dean goes, listens, and even through his closed eyelids he can see the flash of light, feel the buzz of power, the hum of sound that explodes around them as Cas comes into Dean’s palm, across his wrist, up his arm, onto his chest.
, and not just because he’s a guy. He doesn’t have cheekbones that make Dean want to trace them with his fingers, his lips, his tongue, he doesn’t have eyes that Dean can get lost in the intensity of, or lips that are always chapped and soft pink, he’s not
Dean feels his cheek flush under the attention. He desperately wants Cas to keep touching him, to never stop. He’s never felt like this with
“Dean,” he moans, like he’s helpless to do anything else. His hands come up too, roving restlessly, petting through Dean’s hair, tracing across the tips of his ears, his brow. There’s no reason for it, but the gentle sweep of Cas’ thumb across Dean’s eyebrow makes his heart clench in a fit of emotion.
Cas runs his fingers through the strands of hair it leaves fluffed up, smiling something small and gentle.
The feeling starts to disappear around the edges. “No, Cas, wait, I’m coming,” Dean says, hurrying forward.
Cas makes another breathy sound and kisses Dean again, mimicking him, sliding his hands under Dean’s t-shirt and dragging them up his spine.
But there’s no room to deal with it now. There are still Leviathans on their trail, and they need to get out of Purgatory as soon as possible. When they’re safely on the other side, Dean will think about it.
“Ngh,” Dean says because he feels like he should say something, but can’t for the life of him remember how to form words.
“Don’t wanna,” Dean grumbles nonsensically, dipping his head to bury his face in Cas’ neck, mark his skin up with his stubble. He gets his mouth around the hinge of Cas’ jaw and sucks on it.
“You probably will not have much time,” Jack says, looking at Dean, a bit worried, serious lines around his young face. “The Empty isn’t meant to hold humans.”
It eats at him the way very few things have ever done. The feeling of Cas’ hand leaving his...it sticks with him.
“Why not?” Dean says, but he’s smiling. Cas is right. He deserves a bed, and Dean’s slow attention. He deserves to feel
– but he goes, laying himself out along the Impala’s back seat. He’s learned a trick or two, knows how to stretch his limbs out and highlight his muscles, even through all his layers. Knows to hitch his hips up and tease Dean with the sight of his erection, pressing at his zipper. Knows to tip his hand back and swallow, making it impossible for Dean to not crawl along his body and suck at his Adam’s apple.
, when he had pictured tilting his head, just a little, to be kissing Cas. Thinks about how Cas would have let him.
“No, I thought you were-” Dean starts, but then he sees Cas try to reign in his smile and he knows. “You fucking asshole, you were reading my mind then!”
Cas is dropping kisses wherever he can reach, Dean’s knees, his thighs, contorting himself to drop kisses across Dean’s chest.
He drags his fingers down, slowly, and Dean outright moans when he drags them against his prostate. “Oh, fuck, Cas,” he says.
And he'd had those thoughts, but he shoved them away under mountains of denial and excuses. Of "but he's an angel" and "he's my bestfriend" and "he's family". He'd admired Cas' face, his strong jaw, his check bones, the blue of his eyes the same way he had the width of his shoulders, the charm of his messy hair. He had put it aside to place he had filed away the way Cas looked at him sometimes, and the way he had looked at Cas in return. Buried it beneath years of practice at denying himself his happiness. Buried it beneath the denial. Cas was a man, or at least, he inhabited one, and Dean couldn't afford that. The tricks he used to turn had been for money, money for Sammy, and the few boys his own age that he had kissed, they had been practice, curiosity. Benny had been desperate companionship at the edge of the world, they had needed each other, needed the connection to stay sane. There were no excuses for his feelings about Cas, so he had pretended.
Jessica gives him a sheet of paper with the aftercare instructions on it and sends them of with a smile.
Dean gasps again, feeling wildly vulnerable, exposed. It feels much more like Cas is seeing straight through him, touching something so much deeper than Dean’s skin. It’s terrifying.
Benny kissing him in Purgatory catches Dean by surprise. He pulls back and gapes at Benny before blurting out, “I’m not into guys.”
He feels Cas’ free hand stroke up the back of his neck before threading through the short hairs at the back of Dean’s head. Cas presses gently, a request for Dean to tip his head down.
Dean is used to lying. John taught him how to before he even taught Dean to hunt. He’s been lying his whole life. About his job, his name, where he lives, where his dad was. It’s never bothered him before. But now, looking at this simple, innocuous form, he feels like a fake person. He lives in an underground bunker with no real address, shops with hacked credit cards that are under a fake name, even drives his baby with a fake license. It’s part of the life and it’s never bothered him before. It shouldn’t now.
She smiles back. “I know that this is your first piercing, so I’ll tell you what I’m doing. But you let me know if you have any questions," she says.
“Yeah,” Dean says. “I mean, you know.” He tries shrugging, anything to make him feel less exposed and raw. “I was into you. I, uh, am. Into you. So I thought about you when I was…you know.”
Dean gasps and pants as Cas’ expression slowly morphs. He looks upset now, frowning, eyes widening. “Cas?” he asks, swaying towards him.
They’re not one continuous color either. Every inch, every feather seems to shimmer and change in front of Dean’s eyes. Dean reaches out a hand, slow, giving Cas plenty of time to see it coming.
“Of course," Dean says, fishing out one of his fakes. He really needs an identity that isn't dead or wanted for murder. Maybe if Sam ever nuts up and gets Eileen a ring they can all become Leahys.
Cas, fully naked and glorious, steps between Dean’s legs. He cocks his head, confused. “Dean?” he asks, voice a soft rumble. “Are you alright?” He puts his fingertips on Dean’s cheekbone again.
“Good boy,” Cas says quietly and Dean shivers all over. Cas kisses his back again and fucks him mercilessly, dragging his fingers out slowly before shoving them in again, aim dead on to Dean’s prostate.
“It’s human blood. The Empty can’t hold humans; it should reject us if we’re saturated with too much human.”
“But it’s okay that it did,” Dean says. “Right? I mean, it didn’t like, hurt you, or anythin’, right?”
Cas groans, and Dean can feel the vibrations of it. He presses his face forward, just a little, impossible bit closer to meet the roll of Dean’s hips.
Neither Cas nor Jack are actually glowing in any way other than figurative, although they probably both could now, if they felt like it.
, a broken, fucked up man, with blood staining his hands and his arms and his whole being, somehow, because he finds Dean to be worthy of it.
Instantly Dean’s brain is a riot of thought. Dean has done this before, has sucked cocks, always in seedy bars with seedier bathrooms, in the outside chill with gravel and bits of glass beneath his knees. Always a stranger’s cock in his mouth as his brain prickled with the humiliation and taboo of it, the shame of actually liking the weight of a cock on his tongue.
Dean takes him by the hand and leads him across the parking lot. He can feel Cas’ eyes on him, watching him, intense, possessive, pleased, and it makes Dean’s heart pound harder. He doesn’t dare look behind him, because if he does, then they’ll be fucking on the asphalt, in the rain, and the Impala at least has a roof and cushions.
Dean’s never been so aware of his asshole, not even those times he was being fucked. Every nerve seems to be ready, anticipating, over-sensitive. The soft puff of Cas’ breath feels like wind, and his tongue, his tongue when it flicks out of his mouth, still testing, curious, feels impossibly wet.
When Dean throws a punch at Cas, it’s half-hearted. He knows Cas is stronger than him, faster. But he has to try. Go down swinging.
“You’ve never told me what you look like,” Dean murmurs. He digs his nails in a little bit at the base of some of the feathers, and gets them to fluff up again. It seems like Cas likes that. “Bet you’re hot.” He drags his gaze back to Cas’ face to wink at him.
“Come on, Cas, I know you’re in here,” Dean says. “Don’t-don’t ignore me, okay, just ‘cause…just ‘cause I couldn’t…” His throat feels thick, closing on the emotions, on the regret, that Dean couldn’t say more in the moment, that what he did say had sealed Cas’ fate. “Cas, please.”
“Cas,” he murmurs, trailing his fingers through what he can imagine as feathers, eyes still shut behind Cas’ palm, warm and big, contrastingly earth-bound and human. He would say it feels like he’s trailing his fingers through liquid, except there’s nothing wet about it, it’s warm, and smooth.
“Holy fuck, Cas,” Dean says, trying not to laugh. It’s not funny, it’s not, it’s just…Cas, and the way he makes Dean feel, all bubbly and excited inside, even as his aggressiveness is brain-searingly hot.
Dean remembers every single second of that night. Every single word Cas had spoken to him. Every single regret had flashed before him in the dark room, as he sat crying on the floor the whole night. The world was ending outside the bunker, another apocalypse that the Winchesters had to save the world from.
«I love you, Cas.» He says against his neck before his lips begin finding their way to his, Dean's soft nose leading them on their way up, up, up.
“You’re probably right, I’m just worried. I haven’t been able to reach him since yesterday morning.” Sam looks away, putting his phone back in his pocket. Sam and Eileen had been driving all day and although they were only a couple of hours away from home, they decided to stay the night at a cozy inn. «Let´s get some sleep, and then drive back home».
«I sometimes used to count these,» Cas cups his face as he gently strokes his thumb lightly underneath Dean's eye. «But I never did find out the exact number of freckles on your beautiful face. Still, each time I sat by your bed, I tried counting them.»
And Dean still won’t let him ride shotgun which seems to annoy him even more. When he tried to get in the passenger seat yesterday, Dean gave him an unimpressed and slightly dark look until he rolled his eyes and moved to the back seat.
Sam had smiled so wide when Jack showed it to them in the morning, that the smile would have reached all the way around his head if possible.
«Shit…» Dean pulled his phone from his jacked, seeing a missed call from his brother. When Dean hadn’t picked up, he’d sent him a text instead.
They don’t talk, but as Dean looks back to see his brother sleeping in the backseat, he smiles to himself, and without meeting his eyes, Dean reaches his hand over to grab Cas´s.
All these memories were taken from them as they slept. As they slept peacefully and safe, Dean in Cas´s arms, and Eileen in Sam´s arm. They were all safe, happy, and loved, and that’s when their mind raced through these happy memories. Jack just happened to be standing outside their rooms, harvesting the loved and treasured memories of feelings, and feelings of memories.
«This is my last case, at least for a while. I’m getting my... I’m getting Cas back. And after that... I don’t know what he wants to do, hell I don’t even know if he’ll stay. But if he wants me to, I’ll follow him anywhere. But the hunting? I think I’m done. I wanna live. I wanna love... I wanna start loving my life» Dean almost can’t believe how honest he is. How he pours his heart out as if his feelings were a water escaping from a dam that just broke. «Of course I’ll stay here, this is our home. But I wanna get a job, maybe some time in the future when this place is crawling with hunters, I might get my own place. Maybe I’ll join you on a ghost hunt, a god old fashioned salt-and-burn. But you are the hunter, you are the one who wants to grow this community, and I’ll stay beside you and Eileen for as long as you need me, but the hunting? I’m gonna leave that to you.»
When he’s fully dressed, Dean looks over his shoulder to see the door still closed and walks back to the bed. Leaning down and placing his arms on each side of Cas he gently strokes his neck with his nose, earning a smile and humming noise from his man.
“They are always touching or standing close to each other. It’s like they’re two magnets drawn to each other, no force keeping them apart.” Alex was just as confused as Zane looked.
“I didn’t mean to, I’m sorry. But it’s okay Dean, I understand you’ve found someone you’ve developed feelings for? That’s great.”
“Cas... are you hurt?” Dean pulls away quickly to look the angel over. He didn’t see the blood on his clothes before, or how he holds his arm in a weird way. The sight of blood on Cas makes Dean almost panic a little. “Is that your blood?”
«No, Cas. Let me say it.» The next words are like a punch in his gut. A pain so severe Cas wants to let it break him. «I love you, Castiel. I love you too. I have since the moment I met you. I love you.»
«I´ll kill you though if anything happens to her…» he says, and getting a warm and sweet laugh in return.
Time passes without them noticing. Too caught up in each other. In their kisses. In their embraces. In their words.
«I love you, Eileen» he whispers, nearly moving his lips, but she sees as reaches over to hold his hand. Smiling as he watches the world go by outside the window, Sam realizes he’s finally happy. Finally living. They’d made a home, together. They defeated Chuck, free to write their own story. He’s
But, Cas knows Dean never loved him like that. He knows he didn’t feel the same way. And all the while the empty is yelling at him, Cas has his eyes locked at Dean´s green ones. To remind him that this isn’t
«The break pads, yes. It's no trouble as long as I have the right parts, which can be hard to get a hold of when I need original parts. I don’t want no fake crap for my girl.»
Since Christmas is right around the corner, I probably won´t have the time to update in a few days... I got one more chapter in my drafts, but I´m not happy with it atm, but I´ll try to update this weekend.
As Cas walks into the kitchen the next morning, the brothers go silent as they watch him sit down at the table.
Three others showed Dean and Cas, on the brightest one they were sitting together at a cafe. Dean was eating a burger, smiling and watching Cas, while Cas was seated beside him, watching him with a longing look. Jack wasn’t sure which of the two had held the memory, but Jack remembers that the memory was made of longing for something neither thought they could have, and yet it was filled with love. As was every moment between the two. Even the awful memories, or the memories where they were fighting. There was always love woven into them. Not that he had been looking for it, but they knew that if they’d searched them both, deep, they would not find a single memory where their love did not shine or did not appear. The other one showed them walking together along a dark street, Dean's arm slung across Cas´s shoulders, and both looking at the other with love bleeding from their eyes. The third was the most recent memory that they had held on to. It was simple. Joyful. Happy. It was a picture of one of their first kisses. Sometime after Dean had gotten Cas out. Cas was dressed in Dean's clothes, leaning heavily against the other man, arms locked around his neck. It was a sweet and loving kiss, and they were both smiling into it. It had been the one memory of all that Jack had held, that radiated the most love. It was one of Jack's favorites.
through the small gestures. How they showed their feelings in something as simple as a touch on the shoulder, a touch at the elbow, a hand on the other back. How instead of standing in front of everyone, kissing, they would sit in a room full of people and only have eyes for each other. How they always were drawn to each other. If placed in a dark room full of people, they would know at once where the other was, finding each other right away.
«Shut up.» But Dean smiles as he kisses him gently on his forehead. Cas turns his face to Dean so that Dean only has to lean in slightly for their lips to touch.
in the small gestures with them. Now that he has seen it once, he can’t help but see it in everything they do. No one lives with such love in the smallest thing as they do. Sam is convinced that even their every breath is a declaration of love to the other man.
«I´m full after that huge burger, but thanks. Maybe tomorrow.» Dean can see how tired Cas is, his eyes sleepy as they smile at him. Dean hurry to finish his pie, dragging the former angel with him back to the motel, only stopping shorty by the store.
The blue eyes figure stands by the edge of the forest, outside a cozy looking house, a garden and backyard lit up by the moonlight. Jack's fathers had chosen to settle a little bit outside town, their house in the middle of a small forest, down by the edge of a small beautiful lake. The lights are off, but the blue eyes linger on the window on the second floor, the one on the right side. A black, very very old, 1967 Chevy Impala is parked in the driveway, beside a jubilee gold 1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V. With quiet steps, Jack moves to look around the corner of the house.
“Cas...?” Dean whispers his name carefully, his eyes shining bright as Cas half turns to look at him. A glowing glass ball hangs in a chain around his neck. But it is Dean's eyes that Cas takes to study. His stare is met with a sad but bright and loving smile. Dean takes his hand in his, holding on tight to support Cas.
He didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but when Cas was on his way past one of the storage rooms in the bunker, looking for Dean he could hear him talking inside the room. Cas knows one shouldn’t overhear other’s conversations, but something about the way was talking made Cas stop and listen.
He tasted them on every breath he let out, wanted to scream them out loud for every beat of his heart. The words were written on every kiss. Every touch. Every look. And yet, he felt he could not say them enough.
If anyone has been noticing and wondering about the chapter titles; yes, a lot of them are lyrics from (mostly) taylor swift songs (especially the Destiel album "evermore")...
So, he drowned himself in alcohol. Drinking, drinking, drinking. Until he couldn’t feel a damn thing. Until he didn’t know a damn thing. Until he didn’t remember how to do anything, except pray. He spent the nights passed out on the floor somewhere in the bunker. Spent his mornings trying to find
“For years, I’ve known that I’ve wanted you. And for years I’ve believed you didn’t experience feelings the same way I do, not wanting me like that. Cas, I’ve been in love with you for years.” He smiles as he closes his eyes, resting their foreheads together. “The moment you told me you loved me was the best moment in my entire miserable life. The moment you said you wanted me the way I’ve wanted you for so long, I’ve never been happier. But losing you, again, is the worst moment in existence, I don't ever want to lose you again. I’ve spent the two longest months of my life looking for a way to get you back. And now that I’ve finally got you here with me, I need you to know this. I might have been too much of a coward to never voice my feelings for you, but they have always been there.”
The largest of the pictures, the one on the left, showed them all gathered around the kitchen table in the bunker. It was a simple moment, nothing special really. But it was a memory that for all three of them, and even Eileen, represented true happiness and peace. Jack had seen the memory within all of them, and Jack himself remembers the happiness they had felt that night when all five of them were gathered, so they had framed it and sat it there.
When he reaches him, Dean kisses him lightly on the cheek before taking his hand, pulling him close as they follow Sam down the hall.
«Good. Okay. Thanks.» Sam is about to turn after having studied Deans eyes for a moment, when he stops at Deans next words.
There are many other beautiful cars left over from when before the Winchesters made the bunker their own. They aren’t enough to fill the entire garage, but they are still an impressive collection. He hasn’t driven any of them yet, except the Lincoln, and he once took out a blue 1955 Chevy Bell Air. But that was only because his girl needed an oil change, and he couldn’t find the right type of oil in the bunker. No way did that blueberry even compare to his 67´ Impala. No way.
,» Eileen whispers as she slides from the hood of the car and moves towards him, pulling her arms around his waist, resting in his arm hook, her back against the car.
«Cas…» Dean doesn’t even know what to respond to that. He’s been dreaming about words like this, touches like this, for so many years, but never daring to
I feel like I´m kinda finished with this story now, it already turned out waaaay longer than I had planned, but I really enjoyed writing it and I really needed to forget about the finale and just write my own... But, I have this really sad but happy (ending) epilogue idea, where Dean and Cas have lived a happy life together and dies of old age (because that is what they deserved!!), so I might write that...
At one point, Dean is so tired from walking that he just wants to lay down and sleep. Or at least sit down and rest for a while. But he don’t. He keeps walking. Keeps searching the quiet.
Without thinking, without waiting for another second, Dean threw himself at the angel. His arms locking around his neck, pulling the bloodied angel close.
Their days are always spent together, and often together with the other residents of the bunker. Sam has just started digitalizing the library and Dean and Cas have helped where they can. But Dean suspected they weren’t much help as neither of the two really knew anything about technology.
As Dean watched one of his favorite movies, Cas was reading a book, his hand played with Dean's hair. Still not saying a word to each other.
«I love you, too.» The words are just as quiet from his lips as they were from Dean´s, but they're the only thing Dean can hear. The words take his breath away and he has to remind himself to breathe, remind his heart to beat.
Sam prepares four avocado-toasts, displaying them on two plates, then he pours one cup of coffee, and one cup of tea. When he sits back down, Eileen walks into the kitchen, smiling as she joins them at the table. S
That all up to us. To take care of each other. To be there when needed. To be a home for each other. We live on the road, but the road don’t care. So we have to.»
, Jack, he was certain that the Empty could ever come for him. Since the one thing that would make Cas happy, the one thing that would make Cas that happy was Dean. Dean loving him.
“I should hold on tight to you then.” As to emphasize his words, Cas pulls him even closer, brushing his nose against Dean’s. “So you don’t fall.”
With a sad smile playing on their lips, Jack gives their home one last look before turning, disappearing in between the trees. Across town, Jack stands in the middle of a street, outside another sweet looking home. This time Jack heads to the backyard, sitting down on the porch swing close to the door leading into the kitchen. They sit there for the rest of the night, watching the faint glow of the stars still visible above. The blue eyes following the journey of the moon across the sky.
“I don’t want anything to change betwe...” he doesn’t get to finish as Dean interrupts him, finally finding the courage to speak.
«I don't really care. I just want you.» Dean takes a hold of his shirt, Cas´s arms reaching up for him to pull it all the way off.
into something else. «Eileen found a case that she wanted to look into, and I was wondering if it were okay with you if I joined her?»
“I love you.” The words will never stop Dean's heart from skipping a beat. These three words. The only words he’s ever wanted to hear. The only words he ever wants to hear for the rest of their lives.
«I’m not really hungry, so I think I’m gonna go to bed. But you go get yourself something to eat. I’ll text you the room number when I’ve checked in.» Sam says to his brother and Cas, as he smiles at them over the roof of the impala.
«No.» Cupping his face, Cas pulls him back into the kiss. «You know I don’t want to sleep alone either. But you have to leave before the other wakes.»
«Talk to me, Sam. I’m worried about Dean too, and I hope he finds a way, soon, to bring him back. But I hate seeing you worried, so if it would help to maybe talk about it? Then talk to me, love.» This woman is way too good for this world, Sam thinks, wondering how he got so lucky to get to know her.
But, his absolute favorite place to be kissed, Dean had learned, was on the little, now almost invisible, scar on his neck. The faint line of raised skin, on the middle of his neck, where Dean had cut him with an angel blade to extract his grace. That had also become Dean's favorite place to kiss him, the slightest chill that went through Cas whenever Dean kissed him there. The little moan that would escape his lips, the way his hands always raised to the top of Dean's head, gripping his hair tightly. The way the angel seemed to freeze up, not able to function for a couple of seconds after Dean placed a gentle kiss there.
«I know you will. I don’t know how, but I know you will bring him back to you.» Jack doesn’t look up from Miracle, still smiling at the dog as they continue, «you’ve never given up on him before, and you won’t do that this time either. Now that you are free from Chuck, there is nothing stopping you from having him. Having your happiness. And I wish for nothing else, you know, then for my two dads to live a life of free will and free love.»
“Believe me, I wish they’d just get their shit together. I might have to lock them in a room together, refusing to let them out before they have.”
“What makes think I can’t just have that if I want to? I can just throw you out, lock the door, never to hear from you again.”
Eileen and Jack greet them with huge smiles, and everyone gives Cas a hug after he raises from the floor. Jack´s hug lasting longer than the others. Jack melts into the embrace as Cas holds his son tight. Dean keeps close to him all the time.
«Hey, sunshine.» Leaning against the doorframe, Dean reaches out to pull his angel towards him, his lips brushing gently against Cas´s.
to him. But he took a step back. «It’s better if you just let me sleep for an eternity. That way we could both have peace.»
But, they were still careful around the others. They acted the way they always had, but now Dean could see what the others probably had seen all along. The feelings. Dean was very protective about him and Cas, at least now that this thing was so fresh. He also found it unnatural to show such emotions in front of his people, his family. Dean had always hidden his feelings, to appear tough and strong, and that still lingered with him. He shouldn’t show emotion, shouldn’t make himself vulnerable in front of others. But with this, he felt even more protective, not daring to be too vulnerable with them. With this thing between them. Dean had lost so much in his life, but this, this he could not lose. Not this, not
“I haven’t said anything about it to anyone else. Because, you know I’m not good with feelings and all of that, although I’m trying my best to get better. I just... lately all I’ve wanted to do is tell them and... but whenever I try to tell them I like them, maybe even love them... it just seems like my brain shuts off completely and I never manage to say anything.”
«Mir is cute. I’m not. Cute is not a word one uses to describe Dean Winchester.» He can’t help but smile.
“If you don’t mind me asking, Sam. How long have Dean and Cas been married?” Surprise clear on his face, Sam started laughing at Alex, who shared confused looks with Taylor, Aiko, and Zane.
«Should have thought about that before.» Dean smiles wickedly to Cas, kissing him loudly just to annoy his brother. The frustrated murmurs from Sam across the room make Cas laugh and Dean has to pull away to look at the angel.
After a long moment where he only stares at Cas, Dean crashes their lips together. No one has ever called him beautiful before. And for it to be Cas who speaks those words to him, makes it feel like he’s flying.
“Leo suggests I should get out on a hunt once in a while, to get a break from all the work here, so we found a case, some ghost haunting a school. It’s not far so we should be back by tonight. You could join us if you’d like to?”
«Hey, love. What’s bothering you?» She asks as she sits on the hood of her car, eating a chicken burrito, her favorite, for dinner.
The demon is holding Dean down, his hands closing around his throat, stopping air from reaching his lungs. He can hear Cas screaming his name somewhere to his left in the abandoned warehouse bathed in darkness. Dean can’t see anything, yet his eyes instinctively search for Cas in the dark, but he’s nowhere to be seen.
“I never thought you would be able to see that, least of all survive it. You should’ve turned away, Dean.”
Learning each other, again. There was so much to learn, so much to learn differently. Kisses to learn. Bodies to learn. Feelings to learn. Slowly, they were figuring it out. Slowly they
«Cas...» looking up at the starry night sky, Dean is speechless. So they just stand there, for a long moment, looking at the stars. Cas sits against the car as he leans against Dean's side, head on his shoulder. Dean turns slightly towards him to place his arm around Cas’s shoulder, holding him close. At that moment it’s just the two of them. The two of them all alone in the world, the only ones left. «It’s beautiful, Cas.»
«It is true, Miracle is very cute, indeed.» At the sound of his name, Mir comes running down the hall. He stops in front of them, but when he sees that the bedroom door is open, he sneaks into the room, jumping to the bed. «But, you are very cute too. Cute. Just like your freckles. Adorable like your smile. Gorgeous like your eyes. Beautiful. Beautiful, Dean Winchester.»
Without opening his eyes, Dean guides Cas´s head back down when he stops kissing him for a moment, to catch his breath. If Cas is going to continue leaving Dean this breathless, he sure as hell won’t let him breathe either. Moving his hand to tangle it in his hair, the other moving back under his hoodie, pressing at the small of Cas´s back. At the touch, Cas melts into him, his lips soft, his mouth warm against Dean´s. At the lack of air, they both slow the kisses, turning them even softer, panting against each other's mouths.
Cas kisses Dean's knuckles before letting go of his hand, exiting the car. Dean follows and as they meet in front of the impala, Cas is smiling brightly.
Dean shifts again, shuffling backwards on his knees, until he can bend down closer to Cas’ crotch. It costs him the feeling of Cas’ hands on him, but he gets Cas’ stuttery moan in exchange when he brushes his cheek against the bulge of Cas’ cock, nuzzling.
Dean can’t help himself; he starts sniggering. It had been hot as fuck to see Cas lose control like that, flattering that it had been Dean’s hands on him that had caused it. In the warm afterglow, Dean feels
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, his voice all gravel. He’s staring at Dean again, but this time, with the nice easy haze of an orgasm still hanging around him, it’s easier to accept. He meets Cas’ gaze easily. “Thank you,” Cas says.
Dean’s automatically on the defensive , whacking harder than is strictly necessary. “I’m not in love with Cas,” he says, focusing on cutting through the dense bush so he doesn’t have to think about their conversation.
Cas leans down and presses his forehead against Dean’s. “I cannot take your pain,” he says. “But I will replace it. With me. With pleasure.”
Dean grins at him. “Then I’ll kiss all of them,” he says, before taking this head of Cas’ and kissing it.
He’s off again, clipped and short and snide in a way Dean hasn’t seen from him since the early days. But he came, he’s here, and that must count for something, right?
He gasps into Cas’ mouth, opening his mouth to Cas’ tongue, which sweeps in, flicking against Dean’s, running across Dean’s teeth, the roof of his mouth, everywhere, like Cas can’t get enough of Dean’s mouth.
It’s such a silly little thing. Making out with his boyfriend in the rain. Dean’s never done anything like it before. The rain is cool and sweet on Dean’s hot checks, warmed from both Cas’ own cheeks and his attention. Cas’ mouth, however, is warm and sweet against his, familiar and wet. Cas is an intense kisser; he dedicates himself fully to the act of kissing Dean, like it’s the only worthwhile way for an ancient celestial being to spend his time. It never fails to make Dean flush hot, embarrassed by his own reaction, because he
“Yeah,” Dean admits gruffly, flicking his eyes away, overwhelmed. It’s all too much, the way Cas’ gaze makes him feel, flayed open and bare, too raw to accept the overwhelming force of his love.
The black nothingness that makes up the surface of the Empty is bubbling shifting, quite literally nipping at their heels. Cas ignores it so Dean does too, as long as he can. Eventually the bubbles grow, more like waves, undulating, large enough that Dean has to leap over them.
Dean knows that. He tightens his grip on Baby’s steering wheel. “He was bein’ controlled,” Dean tells Sam. “Some angel bitch got ‘im out of Purgatory and fucked with his head. They’re after the tablet too.”
Dean hums happily. His brain has gone quiet for once, relaxed by the orgasm, his third one is only hours, goddamn, and Cas’ weight.
Cas wraps a palm around Dean’s hip and Dean lets Cas shift him, guide him. When Cas presses Dean follows, sinking down slowly onto Cas’ cock.
Dean doesn’t know what to make of that. He’s unworthy of it, he knows, but he can’t help but be selfishly glad that Cas had chosen him anyways.
Dean stands in the library of the bunker, because he can’t bring himself to go back down to the basement. He can’t. So Sam and he had pushed a bunch of tables to the side to clear a space for Jack to open a portal.
Mornings with Cas have become their own sort of routine. Cas sleeps now, just like he eats and shits (and hadn't that been something of a shock to all of them, even Cas, who had shot up out of his chair and disappeared into the bathroom, fast as if he'd found another apocalypse in there. Dean had just been grateful that Cas had already done a stint as a human and hadn't been completely unprepared.)
“You are beautiful,” Cas says, simple, earnest, the way he’s been the whole time. “It is a privilege to see you so.”
There’s a rushing filling his senses, not unlike the rushing that he used to associate with Cas’ sudden appearances. It blows past Dean, and he can feel it ruffle his hair, the ends of his jacket.
Then there’s a warm wave, and the come disappears from Dean’s chest and stomach, and his legs uncramp, the muscles going lax and loose.
Dean catches himself on his own knees, curling his hands into the worn denim. “Cas?” he calls back. It had sounded like Cas,
Dean bites his lip. “I can’t…I might not be able to, y’know, go again,” he mumbles, trying very hard not to blush.
It’s raining outside. Not the kind of downpour that would have them running for the shelter of the Impala, but a steady rainfall, the kind that feels like it hasn’t made up its mind about growing into a storm yet or not. Cas stops once they’re free of the bar’s awning and tilts his head back to meet the rain. He does it a lot, Dean’s noticed, just stands outsides and feels the weather, whatever it may be. Dean wonders if there’s something different in it for him, if being an angel gives Cas some kind of knowledge of every raindrop, of each gust of wind. He tilts his own head back too, trying to feel what Cas must.
Then Cas, with his usual directness, flicks his tongue into Dean’s ass. Not all the way even yet, just the tip of it licking just past the rim.
The girl's friendly expression shutters. "We are an inclusive shop, sir," she says firmly. “Bigoted attitudes will not be tolerated.”
In the mirror, Dean can see his new piercings catch the soft bathroom light. He doesn’t look that different from the morning, just a day’s worth of scruff on his face and the little glints in his ears. He’s exactly who he was all those hours ago, technically. Dean’s been through more self-altering experiences than anyone should have to, not the least of which involved being remade completely by the angel currently draped over his back like a cape. By all rights today was simple. But, Dean realizes with a shock, it had been for him. He’d wanted it, so he’d done it, and not for the world, or for Sam, or Cas, but just for him.
“Good, Dean,” Cas says. “Taking it so well.” He sounds nothing but earnest and pleased, and Dean feels a warm glow of satisfaction.
Dean gasps and crumples the sheets further in his hands. Cas’ tongue is just licking, tasting the skin around Dean’s asshole, the skin below it, his chin and his stubble scraping against the underside of Dean’s balls when he angles his face a certain way. It’s already almost too much, and Cas’ tongue isn’t even in his ass yet. Dean really, really hopes that Cas likes how he tastes. Oh, god, when’s the last time he showered?
Dean hits something solid and gasps, wind knocked out of him by the fall and Cas’ weight on top of him.
Dean shivers. He’s still not sure if it’s his brain, or Cas’ grace, or some kind of static electricity, but it feels like the touch sparks across his skin.
Dean takes a few steps over to the mirror. He's not sure really what he's looking for. He looks much the same as he had this morning, except for three little purple dots. One on his right earlobe, and two on the left, on the top and the bottom of the diagonal. "It looks good,” he says, because it does.
His own hands have stayed at Cas’ hips, grasping almost desperately, finally, finally touching Cas. Dean moves them a little, so he can dip his thumbs under the waistband of Cas’ pants, rubbing along his hipbones.
“It was all worth it,” Cas says, his voice low and wonderous. “I would do it again, all of it, everything, for you, Dean Winchester.”
Cas seems to know that without being told. He moves his hands, one coming up to cradle the back of Dean’s head, the other wrapping under Dean’s left knee, Cas’ arm taking Dean’s weight as Cas pulls him down and forward, spreading Dean wider.
When Cas’ fist connects with Dean’s face, his eyes are cold, face void of any kind of emotion. Cas has never looked like that, not even when he was God, demanding Dean’s supplication, not even when he was unknown, untouchable, pulling the demon knife out of his heart like it was nothing.
“Cas is an angel,” Dean says. He’s…thought about it. If being in love with Cas is anything like being in love with another man. If it’s better that Cas isn’t really a man…or if it’s worse. But it doesn’t matter…because when it comes down to it Dean doesn’t have a problem with either one.
He must forget to breathe again, because when they break apart he finds himself gasping and Cas chuckling against his cheek.
He feels his orgasm coming again and he throws a hand back to grip at Cas’ wrist where he’s holding onto his hip. “Oh fuck, Cas, I’m gonna-”
He has, Dean realizes. Cas had chosen Dean when he’d tried to warn him about the angels’ plot, Cas had chosen him when he’d broken Dean out and given him a chance to go after Sam, Cas had chosen him when he dropped the angel blade in the crypt.
“I’m gonna find ya, Cas,” he says. He lets go of his knife and instead reaches across himself, placing his hand over the blood Cas had left behind.
“Shh,” Cas says. His hand comes back quickly, slick and cool with even more lube, and then three fingers are sliding into Dean’s ass.
