For the first few days following Chuck’s defeat, Dean found this question rolling around his head more often than he’d like. He
“Where did it get you?” Dean asked with a bit more urgency, panic seeping into his voice.
Sam and Eileen were safe, Jack was safe,
He was driving Baby, or heaven’s approximation of Baby, cruising down an open road like he had every day since he got there. Bobby teased him about it, something about old habits dying hard, which Dean thinks was supposed to be a pun. What Bobby doesn’t know is that he isn’t just cruising for the sake of burning rubber. Dean’s been looking for a certain angel.
“I’m sorry I don’t say it often,” She chuckled, “or ever, but I haven’t been a Novak in more than name for some time now. As much as I’m a Mills, I’m a Winchester.”
been starving, he’d realized, but that hunger ran so deep that it had become part of him, like a barnacle under a whale’s belly.
“We’re leaving now,” Dean swung off the side of the bed and Cas crawled out after him.
But those words died on his lips. They still hadn’t really talked about the day the Empty came. There was never a moment to really do it, what with Dean mostly unconscious up until very recently, and then Sam fussing over him once they got back to the bunker, never really letting Dean out of his sight until, well, now.
“It’s okay for you to love them too!”
Jack looked at him with an amused understanding but said nothing. Castiel was proud of him for defeating Chuck and all, but having an omniscient God for a son could be frustrating in moment’s like these, moment’s where he’d like to hide from the world. He couldn’t hide from Jack because he
“Daddy!” Jack had squealed, reaching for Cas from Dean’s hold.
Claire’s mouth twitched, “He called me his sister. Said because we shared dads we were family. He misses and loves you both by the way.”
Claire swiped her thumb over his knuckles. “Listen, later I will blame this on the exhaustion and whatever’s in that IV drip, but you're here for me when it counts.” She turned to Dean, “You both are.” then back to Cas, “You’re my family.”
“Tell Sam I said ‘hi’ and ‘I love you’ too!” Jack shouted after her.
, Dean breathes, or doesn’t.
“What?!” She called back.
For the first time in a long time, the word
to me alright?”
Cas swiped at his eyes, “We miss and love him too.”
“And I know you see them that way too.” Jack said pointedly.
Claire nodded as she absorbed the information.
. Did his sacrifice to the Empty mean nothing? Dean had barely even tasted free will before he, what? Died on a stupid hunt? Castiel seethed at the thought.
So far, feeling with the safety off had been thrilling. Cas had basked in the raw sensitivity of the joy of his love and blossoming romantic relationship. He’d always loved Dean with an intensity, but now he could pick up on all the nuances of human expression.
Cas hated hospitals, possibly more than Dean did. Now that he was human, the sounds and smells made him nauseous. For a place that was meant to be sterile, the sensory overload was overwhelming. Though, part of his uneasiness probably stemmed from the state they’d found Claire in.
Claire turned around and came face to face with a boy. He was taller than her, with short sandy hair and familiar blue eyes. He wore a white denim jacket and a crooked smile.
Somehow that was the wrong thing to say, because Cas’ face droops.
“Why?” Claire asked.
“Claire where are you?” Cas asked over Dean’s shoulder.
“You mean when you sacrificed yourself for me? That time?” and now Dean was angry again, “You do all that and you don’t think I want to see you?”
Cas just laughs to himself at the absurdity of it all.
The next emotion tumbled after the first as smooth as an ocean’s wave: anger. Vaguely the angel remembered a moment on earth, pinning Dean to a wall with fury and power in his voice.
Dean thought, and let himself feel strength in it.
Sam answered the look with a soft grin.
“I love you.” Dean whispers, a smile twisting on his lips.
“I didn’t
Claire, who was much less embarrassed at the display of affection than she felt she ought to be, laughed.  She pulled away and gave him a light punch to the forearm, “I’ll try not to lil bro.” she teased.
Claire blushed, “So,” she kicked at the leaves under her feet, “they asked you to save me?”
Claire sniffed, “It shouldn’t have, but it caught me off guard and it stuck me with one of its claws.” She tried to take another deep breath. “I killed it.” She repeated, sounding like she wanted to reassure herself more than them.
“I didn’t- I wasn’t sure-“ Cas looks at his feet, “I didn’t know if you’d want to see me.”
“I know.” He huffs and then leans in to kiss Dean again, just because he can.
Claire flushed, “No not that I’m not grateful I’m just-“
And the frustrating thing is mommy and daddy aren’t even fighting yet, because Dean can’t get his hands on Cas. He’s angry, he realizes, that Cas is so clearly avoiding him, but more than that he’s scared.
.” Dean says it like nothing has ever been so true. Cas’s face crumbles for a different reason. “You said I taught you how to love, but you taught me how to have faith, Cas. When I lost you I lost that.”
“What?” Cas breathed.
not to get killed, for a hunter that’s as good as you’ll get.”
. Dean thought of his body. What had a few years ago been all hard edges and blunt muscle now gave way easily to the press of fingers. At first Dean was sensitive to the change, worried Cas would no longer find him desirable if his body was not what it had always been.
“It turned into Jimmy.” She sobbed.
“Will you do me a favor?” Jack asked.
Claire knew she should be freaking out about all of this information, but she wasn’t. She felt almost sedated, like she was riding a really good high.
Claire closed her eyes and took a deep breath through her nose. She smelled campfire and maple.
house and ate the food that
the last time we saw one another. That I—” he stops himself, “I thought I was going to be gone forever and I didn’t know how to face you with it now that that’s not the case.”
Dean almost calls on Jack once, but then decides better of it. He doesn’t want to get the kid involved in their little domestic. He doesn’t need to know why mommy and daddy are fighting, although if Dean thinks too hard he guesses Jack probably already knows, the kid being God and all that.
Dean woke belly-down in a hospital bed, his right cheek pressed flushed against a pillow. The first thing he saw was Sam, asleep in a chair beside him.
The two continued down the path, beams of light escaping through the trees overhead. A soft breeze that smelled like campfire and maple passed through them.
Dean knew it would never truly go away, but it would always leave just as quick as it came.
“Claire,” Cas’s sword-of-heaven voice began to rumble, “you know what I-“
, Dean thought as he stood and watched them embrace.
“We’ll be there soon.” Dean added as he pressed harder on the gas. The road was empty and dark, and baby barreled down it like a bullet. The rough scratch of Claire’s hard breathing against the speaker was the only sound that filled the air and the surrounding silence was thick, heavy, and near paralyzing.
Most days though, Dean was good. This particular day especially so.
“No Cas, just- just
He shares it.
Dean glanced up at Sam, a shy smile on his lips.
“pressure. But I can’t.” She panted and repeated “I can’t-“
Unconscious and covered in her own blood, Cas had thought Claire was dead at first. The severity of his emotional reaction had shocked the ex-angel. This was another thing about being human he was still getting the hang of. Though he would come to learn emotions deeply, even as an angel, his grace had acted as emotional padding. As it dwindled over the years, the enduring feelings like love and loss became more pronounced, but as a human without even a hint of his former angelic safeguard, everything was heightened, more acute, and felt with startling immediacy.
Dean leans forward and kisses Cas. It’s chaste and quick but when he pulls away Cas’s lips follow his and then they’re kissing in earnest.
Suddenly, Cas was shaken from his spiraling thoughts by the sound of a low groan. His eyes flew up to the bed and met Claire’s own as they blinked open.
“Oh, and Claire!” Jack called again.
Jack blushed and his smile grew. They kept walking until they were only a few feet from the portal.
“No, not that.” Jack huffed, “Will you tell Cas and Dean I miss them and that I love them too?”
, Dean has spent every day scouring the place for where the bastard has been hiding. Part of him is starting to expect that Cas isn’t even in his neck of the woods, so to speak, that maybe the angel is off in some other part of heaven completely out of reach. But there’s something that tugs at Dean’s chest that tells him he’s wrong, that urges him forward, out onto the road every day.
the world, but he could hide from someone else.
“Only a minute?” Claire deadpanned back, and Dean chuckled. She turned to where Cas was standing and held out her hand. The ex-angel walked forward and hesitantly gripped the offered palm. He pulled his chair closer so that he could sit, but did not let her go.
On the second Jack gave his god-juice
“Sam kept saying that we’d won, but it never felt like it because you were gone.” Dean shrugs his shoulders, kicks the dirt under his boot, “I fell into old habits, got sloppy on hunts and hey, now I’m here.” he has the good sense to wince at that.
Claire smirked, “What like you’re my brother?”
“Mmhmm.” Cas cleared his throat, “you can pull your shirt down now, I’m done.” He said, and then sadly under his breath “I wish I could do more.”
“So..” Claire said as she stepped over a fallen branch.
“Not quite.” He explained, “At least, not yet.”
Hell, maybe Bobby does know that, if the pointed way he talked about Cas upon his arrival was anything to go by. Ever since he’d said the words
Jack’s smirk returned, “Precisely.”
“This is happy weight, Dean.” Cas had pressed on, planting a kiss to his freckled shoulder, “It means you are, perhaps for the first time, truly settled.”
Claire closed her eyes, “I told you that I loved you,” she said to them both, “and I called you dad.” She exhaled and took hold of Dean’s hand with her other one. She placed both of them in her lap and squeezed, “I wasn’t seeing Jimmy, although I might have been delirious from blood loss if my tongue was loose enough to say it, but Jack was right. I see you both as father figures.”
He must have dozed off.  When he opened his eyes, the shower had fallen silent and the room full of humid coconut-scented warmth, and Dean was very studiously examining the contents of his bag. He tossed something to Cas, barely peeking over his shoulder. "Here."
He guessed that she was holding one up to the microphone and tapping it with her long witchy fingernails.
Sam searched a minute.  “Yeah, got those, too.”
“Are you drunk?
“Right.  That. I wondered if you could give me further insight into … what that might mean.”
“No shit.  No wonder they-”
“You made it to class.”  Cas had watched him slip into the classroom just as the professor turned off the lights to begin the lecture.
“Yeah.”
The elevator doors slid smoothly open when Dean jabbed the UP button.  “Shall we?  Here take these.”  Cas took all three drinks and settled cross-legged against the back wall as they started their ascent.  He sipped at his Big Gulp.
And Dean’s frozen to the spot, pinned down by those goddamn eyes.
“Dude yes.  Sorry, Cas, I was aiming for the blanket, not your-”  He made a noise of frustration before he completely gave up and let the coat flop back down over his face.
“I know.  I need you, too.”
“Okay, uh, who’s there?”  Jess smiled.
For a long, awkward moment, Sam said nothing, just stared at the side of his brother’s face.
“What porn?  It’s not mine,” a bleary voice called from the backseat.
He piled as many suits into the garment bag as he could manage, minus the one he intended to wear tomorrow.  He hung the tan trenchcoat on the same hanger, and the blue silk tie. Maybe leaving home and going to university was adventure enough for Castiel.  After all, his relationship with Meg had been quite interesting, but she did have a tendency to upset things badly.

“Yes, as I recall, he was not well suited to the position.”
“Thanks. I’m Dean, by the way.”
Dean melts.  How could he not?  Their free hands intertwine, and Dean brings them to rest on his chest as he and Cas kiss under the stars.
“Yes, that’s true.  Thing is, I let slip, um, something they hadn’t known.  About my new roommate.”
Cas shook his head.  “It’s stupid, and you won’t believe me.”
“Brother? You are not well!”
“Time to get going?” Dean asked.  He drained his own mug and grimaced.  “Yeah, that’s the stuff.” But he seemed happy about it.  “My car is at the bottom of the hill. Assuming you still want a ride?”
So Cas was concerned when Dean’s hands left his hair.  He waited a moment, listening for movement. He heard Velcro.  Dean was removing the microphone gloves. If Dean needed to edit out whatever-was-happening, Cas didn’t want to wreck the continuity by opening his eyes, so he stayed perfectly still.  Soon he heard, “Ahem.” Dean clearing his throat. But the noise came from a foot or two from where Cas sat. He opened his eyes, and his eyes tracked downward. There knelt Dean, his downstage hand behind his back.  Castiel sucked in a breath, eyes wide. “Dean?”
“Okay.  Hey Dena?”
“I’d love if you’d introduce me.”
“Thank you, Malika,” he murmured.
Cas glanced at Dean quizzically.
Dean gave her his best innocent grin as she walked off.  He turned it on Cas next and saw it reflected back tenfold.  It scared him how easy it was to sit and stare at Cas for minutes at a time, with nothing to say and no hope of looking away.  “Where were we?” he asked.
“Yes.  And grits.”
“Oof.  Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.”
And Dean?  Dean hid behind his sasquatch of a brother and barely felt a drop.  He held his hand out and gazed up into the sky.  “Gee, is it raining?  I thought I felt a few raindrops!”  He had enough time to laugh at his own hilariousness before Sam scooped him up and deposited him in the pool alongside Cas.
“Yeah well, not fun.  Figure of speech.  Don’t ever tell anyone I told you this, but I guess it feels good to have someone to talk to.”
Cas kissed her then, long and slow.  Pulling back, they grinned.  "I love you, too."
“You noticed.”
“This is impossible.”
An unseasonably cold breeze ruffled Castiel’s papers.  It gave him an idea. “It’s too windy out here. We should go inside.  I’ve got all one hundred in one form or another- your choice.”
“He will not be prepared to see visitors.”
Dean blinked. "Okay." He sounded confused.
Cas relaxed.  By the time the chorus kicked in, he had the pleasure of watching Dean lip-syncing along, and he outright laughed when Dean began to sing softly.
Dean sniffled.  He wasn’t done crying, nor was he actively trying to stop, but the sobs abated as he lay on the kitchen floor, clutching Cas like a life raft.  “I need a tissue.”
“Dean? I am come.” He takes Dean’s hand in his and strokes his thumb across the smooth skin at his wrist. “Your Cas is at your side.”
“Yup.  You have, uh, grits in here, too.”
, though, so he starred the video, resolving to come back and listen to it tomorrow while he finished packing.  He clicked through to her channel. He found more titles in the Bedtime Stories for Grown-Ups series, as well as the usual roleplay videos: “Tending to Your Battle Wounds,” “Best Friend Does Your Cosplay Makeup,” “Hermione Helps You With Your Homework.”  She also had some interactive Choose Your Own Adventure videos. He wondered how that worked. This video was only 30 minutes, and it wasn’t so late yet.
And he kept scrolling.
As they walk the barely three miles to Garrison House, Dean asks Jo what she knows of their brother’s attachment to Miss Morningstar.
“And those thumbs-up?” Cas dropped his voice deeper.  “‘Dean, ACES,’” and gave the camera two thumbs up.
Adeiu
"It wasn't the Queen who made that deal!  It was-"
As Dean can only assume his brother to be of her party, his mind leaps to fear the worst. “Sam!”
“Yeah, that’s what I thought, too.  I have them in the center of the camp,” pointing at the bedrolls.  “Neither has watch tonight, either.  You, Jo, me?”
Dean covers Castiel’s lips with his. He finds that he is still too far from Castiel, and he presses closer. Closer still. “Castiel, I want-”
They shook their head.  “It’s nothing, just.  I’m not certain that I wasn’t followed.”
isn’t stupid.”
They have just sat down upon the settee to discuss the happy conclusion to the problem of Miss Morningstar, when they are called to attend the ladies in the sitting room. They arrive to find Jo in a state of agitation. She is pacing the room and rushes to her brother’s side the moment he appears. “We were wrong. She does leave soon for La Cage, but her father has invited half the neighbourhood, certainly all the young people, for a visit.”
“Thank you, Dean,” equally overwhelmed.
Dean blinked.  “Okay then. There’s a cafe downstairs.”  He led the way out of the classroom, but as the hallway widened, they walked abreast.  “Look, you don’t have to sit down, either. You can just get your coffee and go if that’s-”
He counted to twenty in his head.  “When.”
Dean glanced at Cas, did a double-take.  “What?”
He untied the bow and found a seam.  He pulled, and the paper fell away, revealing an ordinary cardboard box.  Just a reused shipping container. Nothing mysterious at all. He noticed that The Eastwind Witch had scratched out her own address with a Sharpie.
Dean scratched at the back of his neck, before peeking back at Cas in the rearview mirror.  He was frowning.  “What?  You’re staring again.”
“Cas, I’m sorry.”
“What?”
“They’ll serve us here, same as any other table, and it’ll be faster.”
“Lucifer Morningstar! That son of a-”
Cas bristled slightly.  “
Picking a Halloween costume
“Yes, Dean?”
Then Castiel issued a proclamation through the land, he summoned them all, the coppersmiths, the goldsmiths, the stone-workers, and commanded them, ‘Make a statue of my friend.' The statue was fashioned with a great weight of lapis lazuli for the breast and of gold for the body. A table of hard-wood was set out, and on it a bowl of carnelian filled with honey, and a bowl of lapis lazuli filled with butter. These he exposed and offered to the Sun; and weeping he went away.
Dean’s eyes widen in a comical manner and he is rendered completely speechless. “You?” he stammers at last.
“We’re going east.”
“And why do you think I shall bestow it now?” Dean roars, suddenly furious.
Cas smiles. “It wasn’t difficult. I could sense the air as it-”
Tessa said to him, ‘Castiel, your own hands have prevented you from crossing the Ocean; when you destroyed the tackle of the boat you destroyed its safety.' Then the two of them talked it over and Castiel said, ‘Why are you so angry with me, Tessa, for you yourself cross the sea by day and night, at all seasons you cross it.' ‘Castiel, those things you destroyed, their property is to carry me over the water, to prevent the waters of death from touching me. It was for this reason that I preserved them, but you have destroyed them, and the
Chuckling, he grabbed a pancake from his plate with his fingers.  It sagged, and he shook it to make it jiggle.  “For what it’s worth, there are plenty of pancakes for the morning.  And I’ll make a fresh pot of coffee.”
Duma --- DUMUZI / TAMMUZ: The Sumerian form of Tammuz; a god of vegetation and fertility, and so of the underworld, also called ’the Shepherd and ’lord of the sheepfolds’. As the companion of Ningizzida 'to all eternity’ he stands at the gate of heaven. In the Sumerian ’Descent of Inanna’ he is the husband of the goddess Inanna, the Sumerian counterpart of Ishtar.  Tammuz: Sumerian Dumuzi; the dying god of vegetation, bewailed by Ishtar, the subject of laments and litanies. In an Akkadian poem Ishtar descends to the underworld in search of her young husband Tammuz; but in the Sumerian poem on which this is based it is Inanna herself who is responsible for sending Dumuzi to the underworld because of his pride and as a hostage for her own safe return. According to the Sumerian King-List Gilgamesh was descended from ’Dumuzi a shepherd’.
“Josephine!” Sam is shocked by his sister’s poor manners, though not as shocked as he should be, had she been raised by a better model than Dean Winchester.
Dean marveled at the kitchen.  It occupied almost as much space as the sunken living room, with its heavy yet somehow elegant stone fireplace.  And this was a professional kitchen if ever Dean had seen one, with all stainless steel appliances, four gas burners and a griddle/grill component on the stove top, a massive hood.  It had two separate ovens plus an oversize microwave and a toaster oven half-hidden behind an impossibly complicated espresso machine.  “I guess I know where we’re having Thanksgiving this year, huh, Sam?”
Castiel nods, “Perhaps you are correct. Or perhaps,” he muses, his eyes flashing back and forth as he deliberates, “I can appeal to Mr Morningstar.”
“Yeah?”  He blinked a few times and appeared to be back to normal.  “What of it?”
Crowley turned to find Kevan flushed, properly roiled.  "Dena of Winchester is a fool.  A fool and a cheat.  She thought she could flake out on her debts.  Let me tell you something," she nearly shouted, "I brokered that deal.  I'm on the hook for that, that manipulative scag, and her escape is on MY head!"  She composed herself with some difficulty, eventually managing a breezy, "What do you care anyway?"
Cas meant to take notes; he really did.  Instead, he spent the movie watching Dean.
She wipes at her eyes with her little lace handkerchief. “I am quite well,” says she, just as the coachman opens the door.
Cas wrapped the doughnut in a napkin and handed it over to Sam.  He ate one apple fritter without speaking, staring out the window as he chewed.  He reached for the other fritter, thought better of it.  Instead, he took it and tore it in half, his bandaged hand making him clumsy.  The smaller chunk disappeared in three methodical bites; the larger piece he left in the box for Dean.  The highway being relatively empty, Cas popped out of his seatbelt momentarily.
“What?”
“Oh my god. Yes. Yes. I’m ready. I’m gonna... OH! Godddd...”
All long-tailed creatures that nourished you
She rubbed her face, waking up the skin, freshening her thoughts after the dark reverie.  A kiss from Cas cleared the rest of the smoke from her vision and she breathed deeply.  "I am now."
“If he was in Hell, every demon would know it.  He’s in Hell.  The problem is, he doesn’t want to be found.”
“What’s that?”  Cas asked.  They were both on the couch, barely.  Dean was practically hugging his armrest.
“Me too.”  Dean pushed off the ground and held out a hand to Cas.  “Come on, Crazy Town, let’s find some food in this shithole.”
"I could do that.  But then what?  She tosses aside her crown and the two of you walk back home, happily ever after?"
“Yeah, Sammy?”  He wrenched his eyes to the driver.

“He will see me.”
This accomplished, Cas sat and draped their arms around Dena.  “You seem troubled.”
“Either.”  Cas hesitated until Sam sighed and muttered, “Cake doughnut, please.”
22:00 - bed
The mania passed, and they parted, panting and strung out with longing.  Cas buckled, still gripping Dean’s shirt; Dean stood over him, solid as marble, hands tangled in Cas’ hair.  They looked like a painting.
He sat hunched over the table as he wrote out a list of everything they’d need.  After a time, Sam peeked over his shoulder.  In one column, he gave the ingredients for the spell.  The usual bones, blood, and dust, but also “rose petals” and “mementos of D / S / C.”  The second column was a list of names.  Their own at the top in typical Cas fashion, followed by Krissy and her gang, then a bunch of people that Sam wouldn’t have expected him to know or consider: Charlie, Mrs. Tran, Garth, Jody, Annie for crying out loud!  He had started a third, but he’d only gotten as far as “PIE” and “beer?  Or whiskey,” with a neat line through “Or whiskey.”  Sam wondered aloud what he was doing.
She squinted her eyes at him and pursed her lips.  “Hmm. But who are you
Dean does not follow, but makes his way back to the house to alert the staff. Just as His Lordship’s men rush outside, however, Castiel can be seen striding across the long lawn, the maid in his arms collapsed against his shoulder. She looks quite unwell indeed. That is, until she catches the eye of Mr Winchester. Her coy smile informs him of her intentions. He scowls, even as he leads the way to a convenient sitting room.
"No."
“Dean.”  He jumped as Cas crept out of nowhere and laid a hand on his shoulder.
"Check out that shower!"
“Cas.”
“It looks like rain today,” Dean remarks.
Jo hesitates. “Is it not possible that the rumors will prove strong enough to frighten away … respectable families?”
“It’s too much.  I know, sorry, I shouldn’t have-”
Lord Novak approaches, with his sister, The Honourable Anna Novak, on his arm. Dean and Jo both stare in admiration at her auburn tresses, barely restrained by a fine net snood and charmingly adorned with silver ornaments. “It is a delight to see you again so soon,” Miss Novak greets the young woman before them. Her voice betrays no emotion and her penetrating eyes linger upon Mr Winchester. “Brother, I beleive you are a little acquainted with Miss Winchester.”
The sound has died away and still Castiel holds tight to Dean. The latter nods once, and Castiel removes his hand, yet he does not free Dean from his embrace. “Forgive me.”
“Was it on Tutube or Patronus?”
Dean pauses, slowly turns to face the Ravenclaw at his right.  “Gesundheit.”
Cas shrugs and spreads his arms wide. “Back when I was a captain, when I was young and foolish and susceptible to the suggestion of younger, more foolish men.” He smiles wryly and adds, “When a handsome redcoat bids you follow him into a den of iniquity, resistance becomes quite impossible.”
His face was altered like that of one who has made a long journey. With awe in his heart he spoke to John his father: ‘Father, there is a man, unlike any other, who comes down from the hills. He is the strongest in the world, he is like an immortal from heaven. He ranges over the hills with wild beasts and eats grass; he ranges through your land and comes down to the wells. I am afraid and dare not go near him. He fills in the pits which I dig and tears up my traps set for the game; he helps the beasts to escape and now they slip through my fingers.'
“Cas?”
woke him up,” Sam said.  “Good morning, Dean.”
“No,” Cas answered quickly, shifting in his seat.  “I made it.  For me.”
Dean’s phone chimes. A text from Sam. What time is it there? Isn’t he at work now?  He reads it, reads it again. What?
He checked off the invitees as they arrived, and when his list was complete, he went inside to assist Sam.  He found the library quite full.  Krissy and Josephine draped over the comfy chair opposite Aiden and Melissa.  They were chatting with Jody’s daughter about hunting, probably trying to recruit her, if Sam’s prediction could be trusted, and Cas could just make out Josephine mentioning to Annie that Melissa had also been obligated to take the cure.
Dean agrees.
The Queen nodded.  “Good.”
Cas was at first disappointed by the Strip.  They rolled into town under afternoon sunlight; he had expected neon and instead saw only a pallid tacky tourist town in various shades of brown and glaring white.  He asked Sam to pull in at the Luxor.  Though monochromatic, it was at least distinctive at any time of day.  It felt right.  It felt lucky.
Awful, salacious ones, dearest. I have several very scandalous ideas about Lord Novak and Mr Winchester.
Without looking up to judge for himself, Cas asks, “Did you want to watch the meteor shower?”
“They’re digging in the wrong place!”  Dean cried, along with Sallah. He looked up to see if Cas had also recited the words.  Cas had not, and was rather startled, in fact- he hadn’t been paying attention to the dialogue.  But he grinned back at Dean. His enthusiasm was contagious. Cas slunk down to the floor to sit beside him, and Dean bumped him playfully with his shoulder before turning back to the movie.
ETANA: Legendary king of KISH who reigned after the flood; in the epic which bears his name he was carried to heaven on the back of an eagle.
Castiel just nods. “I am not proud of my actions, Dean. The girl- One look confirmed that she was chastity personified. I should have been ashamed to so much as speak to her, a girl so young- Had she been one of us (a gentleman’s daughter, that is) I wonder, would she have been out.” He kneels before Dean to complete the confession, and Dean allows him to take his hand. “Her name was Amelia. We talked, we spoke of her history, of her father, of how she had come to such a place, and I found that I had such compassion for this poor freindless creature. I found myself in her cramped quarters night after night, if not for her … company, then to prevent others from defiling her.”
“La, I don’t care a whit if he does hear me, he-”
“Pretzels, please.  And grab yourself a drink from the cooler.”
“I’m a little hungry, though,” Cas remarked, shoving the coat over his shoulder into the back.
His father opened his mouth and said to the trapper, ‘My son Adam, in URUK lives Castiel; no one has ever prevailed against him, he is strong as a star from heaven. Go to URUK, find Castiel, extol the strength of this wild man. Ask him to give you a harlot, a wanton from the temple of love; return with her, and let her woman's power overpower this man. When next he comes down to drink at the wells she will be there, stripped naked; and when he sees her beckoning he will embrace her, and then the wild beasts will reject him.'
The Queen spoke soothingly.  "I know very well, and I won't have you agitating yourself.  I will handle this; you will sleep.  Next march will come soon, and you must rest.  Go to your angel and let them comfort you."
“Damn right,” Faith confirmed.
“Hello Sam!” Gabriel answered cheerfully, “Castiel is not available right now, but your favourite Archangel is here to take a message. Are you missing me already?”
“I understand,” Castiel regarded the Archangel thoughtfully, “And I do appreciate you being honest with us. I know it doesn’t come naturally.”
“He is genuine,” Jane explained, “Whereas you wouldn’t know how to be a decent person if your life depended on it.”
“Go,” Charlie urged.
“If I don’t host Lucifer, someone I love will end up with him as a passenger,” Sam said bluntly, “What did Michael and Lucifer do to me and Adam?”
“Hi; what can I get for you?” Jane asked happily.
Castiel had not only found his soulmate, he had rescued him from Hell, so they were deeply connected before they were even introduced.
Faith patted Dean on the knee, “Are you sure? I could make a diary and share all my symptoms.”
“I wonder why he manifested his wings,” Castiel had never done so on Earth.
Instead, Gabriel surged to his feet and sprinted to the kitchen.
Dean slammed his fist into the wall, “Is this it?” he demanded, “We fight tooth and nail for years, then just give up when Chuck tells us to go away? No!”
Dean ate dinner casually while he fed the stream of memories into the box. Feeling the rising agitation in response was oddly satisfying.
“Keys,” Sam said urgently, “I’ll search upstairs.”
“Should I sit down or something?” Sam wondered aloud.
Sam had experienced a range of overwhelming emotions toward Lucifer. For the first time, he was speechless with something which could only be described as honour.
“I collected all the non-perishable food left on the planet, planted fruit trees beyond the pool and planted vegetables in your front yard,” Gabriel replied easily, “You’re welcome.”
Sam glanced down the hall, clearly considering breaking down a section of wall.
“Cheers,” Castiel muttered.
Sam managed to catch Faith when she tried to spin around and back away at the same time. Her involuntary yelp ended when she crashed into Sam.
Sam and Dean were the only two remaining at the table. Adam had voiced his awe of how much food his brothers could consume before he followed Samandriel to the lounge.
Lucifer winked at the Hunter, as though they were sharing a secret joke.
else. I’d take him myself before letting him even ask Sam.”
Castiel trailed along behind the angry woman out of curiosity. Problems he did not feel responsible for were a good distraction.
Castiel perched next to Gabriel on the hood of the Impala. Her movements were awkward as she tried to mimic the relaxed position of the Archangel.
“Dean’s still getting into trouble, I see,” Benny drawled, the strain in his voice belying his shock.
“Not into threesomes?” Gabriel teased.
Gabriel beamed, “Excellent. Castiel is as stubborn as God himself. Frankly, he and Dean are perfectly suited in that respect.”
“Kiss him, Castiel!” Gabriel teased, “I want to know if Michael can burst a blood vessel from in there.”
Sam had avoided thinking of Lucifer quite deliberately. As he enjoyed a hot shower, thoughts of the pain-in-the-ass Archangel crept into his thoughts.
Faith offered some advice and promised to help if he needed her.
“The cleansing has started,” Sam said casually, “Gabriel is fascinated by the whole process.”
“Any emotions I displayed prior to that were ripped out of my head,” Castiel explained, “So, yes, an emotionless ass could describe my demeanour at the time.”
Faith retrieved the book on Dhampirs and retreated to her room to read. She didn’t want to risk running into Dean if he expected her to be still handcuffed to the bed.
“Humans do get cranky when they get interrupted,” Chuck agreed.
The tingle of warm Grace was so comforting, Lucifer leaned into the contact. Gabriel let his hand slip down to rest on his brother’s shoulder once he had analysed the internal conflict.
Faith giggled, “Dean, I can see you are torn between outrage and a fantasy involving sleeping with four women at once.”
Gabriel figured that since he wasn’t getting any, Dean should suffer through a drought, too. The tricky part was humiliating Dean in a way that did not reflect suspicion back onto himself.
Lucifer fought down the instinctual anger, remembering the advice Gabriel had imparted earlier. As a wave of calm settled over him, he smiled innocently at his brother, “Don’t embarrass the boy; he can’t help it if he’s imagining me wet.”
Through Faith’s eyes, Castiel observed the tension in Dean’s posture. He was also aware of the increased intensity of the bond between them. He suspected that even the carvings on the ribs of the Hunter would not hide the awareness the Angel was feeling.
“Not as effective against Dhampirs,” Dean mused, “I wonder if that’s already in the book she was reading.”
“I’ve been very full of shit in the past; right now, I’m rather shit-free,” Dean protested.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Gabriel attached the glowing contained to a cord and slipped it around his brothers’ neck. Both Hunters found the mournful expression on the Trickster to be quite disturbing.
Sam realized that Faith was staring at his neck with predatory intensity. He also saw Dean level the muzzle of his gun to aim at Faith’s head.
“And something shiny will distract Dean for a while,” Gabriel concluded as Dean led Chuck toward the garage. Castiel trailed after them curiously.
Gabriel had to shove Castiel out of the Nest room and promise that Dean was deeply asleep. She re-joined the Angels watching the movie and monitoring Dean via their telepathic link.
Dean nodded, having anticipated the request since Adam had been brought to the bunker.
“Was that little fact in the missing pages you took?” Faith asked pointedly.
The ball of Grace seemed to collapse in on itself, extinguishing the painful glow in favour of a human shape.
“Not exactly,” Gabriel admitted, “He has given up on Dean, and is lost to guilt.”
“It sounds tempting,” Dean huffed, “I don’t fancy watching the world fall apart.”
Dean held up his hands defensively, “Cas is here, but healing.”
“I wouldn’t believe you, even if you said the sky was blue,” Dean replied, sounding bored, “You fully awake, Sammy? This chick is annoying.”
“Nope,” Gabriel replied easily.
Gabriel held out his hand, “Your power is impressive. If you hold my hand, I should be able to transport you to the bunker.”
Faith remained slumped against the arm of the three-seater couch Gabriel had conjured out of thin air. It was extremely comfortable and perfectly positioned to view the huge television screen which had also been provided by Gabriel.
Dean loved the way he could still see Castiel in the female version of her vessel. Every time he looked at those blue eyes, he was amazed that an Angel could watch him with such devotion.
Dean shrugged, “If she hits an artery, you’ll die, and I’ll have to decapitate her.”
“I wish I had found a way to bear the Mark myself, or reason with my sister in the first place. I didn’t, and you suffered for it,” Chuck sighed, “I regret your fate so much, Samael.”
“Well, no shit, Sherlock,” Dean replied sarcastically, “By who?”
“Why do you want his wings out, then?” Dean challenged.
“Chocolate and alcohol are my favourite reasons for keeping humans alive,” Gabriel mused.
Gabriel appeared in front of the television. Sam flinched but did not make any noise. He hated when Gabriel popped in; it was weird enough when Cas did it.
“Perhaps. He can also see the bond between us and knows that being apart causes us pain.”
Gabriel resumed his position on the recliner before he began his explanation, “An Angel who was killed was just brought back to life; I heard him on Angel radio. It appears Jane wished for her soulmate, and he is alive again.”
“I don’t care,” Faith cut off the Archangel, “Ten minutes privacy and your survival remains a secret.”
“We’re both fine, and you’re avoiding questions like a lawyer,” Dean pointed out, “Can you explain the wings thing?”
“Spot on, Castiel,” Meg agreed, “If the sex-change doesn’t work, I’ll gladly keep you warm at night.”
Dean suppressed a snarky comment about training to get a pet parrot. Castiel flicked him on the ear.
“What?” Sam scoffed.
Gabriel touched two fingers to Castiel’s’ forehead. His caught his Grace-less sibling as his legs gave out from under him.
Balthazar stretched out on the lounge where Sam had been. Jane sat next to him.
“It’s good to see you enjoying each other’s company and Grace,” Chuck noted with a smile.
“The Romans,” Castiel explained dismissively, “Modestly did not occur to humanity until much later.”
Sam rolled his eyes, “No; Dean is too stubborn to be coerced into it.”
Raising Dean from Hell had been the ultimate turning point in his existence. Even finding out he had been duped into helping the Angels who supported Lucifer, he had made a huge impact on Dean and Sam by taking that trip to Hell.
Faith was relieved when Gabriel assured her that Sam would recover fully, with rest.
“I figured.”
Michael sorted through the knowledge he had gained regarding Dean’s upbringing.
“Does the sibling thing not equal incest in Heaven?” Faith asked cluelessly.
Faith could see the resemblance easily enough; the dark hair and blue eyes were obvious. The shape of Castiel’s new face was also reminiscent of her own.
“Touch is an important part of human bonding,” Castiel explained quickly while she held onto Dean.
The chains had disappeared, freeing Sam and Dean at the same time. Faith and the woman who had to be Jane raced toward them as they regained their balance.
Castiel waited until Faith was back in her room before he headed to the bathroom to wash his face. The pale man in the mirror stared at him with bloodshot eyes.
“Are we good?” Sam inquired. He was not worried, as Dean would listen to Cas when nothing else would get through to him.
“Holy Oil would make a great trap for investigating Angels,” Balthazar realized.
“Knowing my luck, he’ll end up in the Cage with Uriel and Zachariah.”
Sam sighed and his shoulders slumped. He hated the way the Archangel could make his stomach turn just by speaking.
“Probably.”
“I believe my regard for you conflicts with your low self-esteem,” Castiel mused.
Sam looked around Stull cemetery with a sinking heart. His stomach was knotted up so tightly, he was glad dinner had been postponed in favour of their field trip.
“Cas, can you feel anything different since you left my body?” Dean asked hesitantly. The words sounded so wrong.
“But most humans are
“I’m an Angel,” Gabriel said simply, “most of us are arrogant pricks, so I’ve lived on Earth for thousands of years. Now, shut-up and bite the only idiot offering his blood on a silver platter.”
Castiel glanced up, recognising the tone of voice as one the Hunter used when he was planning something.
“We’re Angels; we were made perfect,” Lucifer muttered.
“I get that now,” Sam acknowledged quietly, “He wanted me to torture him rather than be left in solitary confinement.”
“I’m Faith; nice to meet you,” she replied cheerily, “Why do you want Gabriel? I don’t think he likes Demons.”
Gabriel appeared a few steps away from the worried Hunter, “My ears are burning,” he said with a smile.
Sam regarded him with worried eyes, “It could force them into something?”
Gabriel held out a hand with two fingers extended toward her forehead, “May I check?”
Chuck regarded him thoughtfully, “What if you had a couple more classic cars to fix up?”
“He saw an image of Lucifer’s previous vessel, Nick,” Castiel recalled, “It would be easy for an Archangel to appear different to a single human in the Cage.”
Dean jerked away from the warm body he was cuddled up to, only to be stopped by arms which could have been made of steel.
Balthazar shrugged, “Holding a grudge against such a close friend doesn’t feel right. Can I play the protective older brother and accuse Dean of trying to sully her virtue, though?”
Dean raised his middle finger at the nosey Archangel.
Dean wasn’t convinced that Faith was a harmless victim of nasty men. A growing craving for human blood could lead to deaths in the future. Sam was clearly falling for the helpless damsel routine, but he was not so easily convinced.
“Stop that right now!” Gabriel ordered as he pulled himself into a sitting position to tower over Sam, “You did
Castiel was blushing and Dean could hear the uncertainty in her voice. He expected her to speak of orgies, or something equally taboo.
Gabriel watched the glowing form of Castiel rise from the bed, leaving his vessel behind. The Archangel touched the motionless body with one hand to preserve him.
Sam recognised the features of Lucifer’s previous vessel Nick strengthen, though the shifting form remained unsettling.
“Did Father tell you anything when he resurrected you?” Gabriel asked quietly.
“Down in the dirt with the hairless apes,” Dean teased, “Try not to muss up your clothes.”
“Where’d you send them?” Sam asked, sounding bored by the antics of the Archangel.
“Moodiness aside, she and Faith seem to like each other,” Gabriel continued, “I expect Castiel to be badgered into submission well before we return.”
“He can but claims I would not cope without a female mind to learn from,” Castiel decided to leave out the rest of the prattle Gabriel had included with the explanation.
“Gabriel,” Sam prompted.
“Dean and I would like to join your Flock,” she said firmly to Gabriel.
“He’ll be fine; he just needs rest.”
Gabriel checked on Sam, who was still unconscious. The Archangel used his powers to seal his Flock-mate into a deep, healing coma.
“Looks like a case,” Dean said cheerfully. He turned his laptop screen to face Sam.
A small surge of energy sparked from the place where their skin touched. Dean smiled instinctively.
“Good. The memories gave me an overview of what Sam and Dean have been through, but I’m sure I’ll need more information to get to know Sam like I want to.”
“What is wrong with you?”
Rowena was compiling all the books in the Witchcraft section while Meg poured over books on Demons.
“You won’t want past-me as a vessel, right?”
“All people are rather complicated,” Cas agreed, “I’ve never met one I would describe as ‘simple’.”
“Sam is going to die,” Lucifer whispered.
Faith dropped the subject in favour of pointing out how long he spent staring at his phone.
“I plan to always answer your direct prayers,” Gabriel revealed, “At least until you get over this penance crap and put your Grace back in.”
Faith threw off the demon with the looser grip and lunged forward at Asmodeus, dragging the second one forward abruptly.
“Did you drown in there?” Dean called through the door.
Dean pointed out snidely.
The coldness in her chest prevented Castiel from answering. Chuck had known of his disloyalty all along; was that why he refused to be found?
Faith kept the book on Dhampirs close by; she had read it cover to cover and had at least one question still to ask. She waited until Sam and Dean were packing the car to silently ask for Gabriel to come speak to her.
“Sam is a good man who has suffered too much,” Castiel agreed.
“Remain in physical contact for at least an hour,” Gabriel instructed, “Who wants to play poker?”
Sam rolled his eyes, “Even if everyone had to share the third bathroom, you’d be fine. It’s not my fault you think soap and shampoo are interchangeable.”
Castiel heard Dean’s voice break with emotion. He ran the pad of his thumb along Dean’s hand, knowing words were inadequate.
“Or something,” Sam agreed evasively.
A small table appeared next to the wall where the door should have been. A paper bag with a fast-food logo sat on the table.
“Does anyone else know how dark your wings are, Castiel? Wings are very personal to Angels,” Matthias continued, addressing the humans, “We rarely even show them to each other in Heaven.”
“Free will,” Chuck replied easily, “They don’t have to rape and molest; they choose to commit such acts.”
“I have him,” Sam said aloud, in an echo of a similar statement uttered in the same place years ago.
He had been impressed when the door to her room was outlined with sigils to deny any Angel access.
Gabriel took a quick picture before Sam shoved his brother off him.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“Hello, Winchesters!” Gabriel greeted smugly, “I hope you don’t mind; your pet Angel led me here.”
“He’s had to live with crappy decisions, too,” Gabriel pointed out, “If anyone can understand having minimal emotions, then being swamped by them, it’s him. He has all the memories of being soulless.”
“Thank-you for answering my call, Crowley,” Gabriel greeted politely.
“Go away.”
“You’d enjoy that; you kinky shit,” Dean complained, “Charlie is welcome anytime, but why is Rowena here?”
“It’s getting steamy in here,” Gabriel joked from across the room, “I’d tell you two to get a room, but here we are.”
Sam gritted his teeth against the pain of the knife slicing into his chest.
“You should,” Castiel muttered.
Faith couldn’t suppress the silly smile which spread across her face, “Don’t tell Dean that; he’ll stash Sam somewhere and I’ll never see him again.”
“You didn’t give him anything!” Jane spat, “You forced it on him!”
“Bare minimum,” Faith assured him, “If you didn’t share it with Dean, it wasn’t given to me. There was nothing too explicit, I promise.”
Dean flinched at the fury in his tone and dropped his gaze back to Cas.
“That doesn’t sound pleasant,” Lucifer admitted reluctantly.
Gabriel checked in with the Winchester troublemakers; they were winding up the case in St. Louis on schedule. The Archangel deliberately ignored the silent pleas from Sam; he had no intention of flying the taller Hunter back to the bunker to feed Faith.
“I suspect the process will cause its own death toll,” Gabriel agreed.
“Beyond sharing Grace with you?” Castiel asked seriously.
Dean decided there was no chance he had been stupid enough to go home with a stranger. He peered around the room and recognised it as the place Faith had been using.
Faith shuffled her weight from one foot to the other, “I bit him,” she admitted, “I didn’t know what else to do.”
“Though, Castiel was in Dean for a short while,” Gabriel added.
Castiel wanted to join them, but the pull toward Dean was stronger.
Gabriel halted immediately, “Already?”
Gabriel found Castiel in the storeroom, as expected. His brother liked to be useful, and he enjoyed the tedious work. Gabriel understood many things, but not that.
“Not even Sam?” Meg asked, “I’ve seen that mark on his neck.”
Lucifer’s expression remained forlorn, “Why not, when they both cause the same level of suffering?”
“That’s not what I meant!” Sam protested through a cough to clear his airway.
Sam wanted to argue, but the stubborn tilt of Dean’s jaw convinced him not to bother, “Keep it out of sight.”
After dinner, Dean stretched out on the distended lounge which was sinfully comfortable.
“If we can get Crowley to agree to leave Linda alone, she can return to her life,” Gabriel added, “Unless you want to stay?”
Sam felt a knot of dread forming in his stomach, “I assume I need to know?”
Meg took Charlie on the short version of the guided tour of the bunker while the brothers turned their attention to the other newcomer.
“Why bother creating Hell if Heaven serves a similar purpose?” Lucifer scoffed.
“Can I speak to Dean alone, please?” Castiel asked tightly.
Though most of the occupants of the bunker spent the day outside helping to set up the growing compound, Lucifer remained inside like a hermit. Gabriel tolerated this anti-social behaviour at first, but the offer Lucifer had made to Sam prompted a new approach.
“Castiel!” Faith caught his hand between her own to release him from the nightmare.
Faith glanced up and frowned at Gabriel. Jane had filled her in on the Archangel’s plans and knew that Castiel had not yet been informed.
“Dean?” Sam hissed.
“Western Australia,” Chuck replied proudly, “Some of the best beaches in the world are in this country, and so remote they rarely get visitors.”
Castiel made a noise which almost sounded like a laugh, “You’re one to talk.”
With a flap of wings and a flash of colour, the scene changed.
“Gabriel, do you think I’m an Abomination?” Jane asked quietly. She analysed his aura closely to make sure he was being truthful.
“But that would be worse?” Cas guessed.
Dean shrugged, “Maybe.”
“It took a whole liquor store to get you drunk last time,” Sam recalled unhelpfully.
He sounded as though he was being blackmailed into doing something revolting.
“I have a mission,” Samandriel admitted softly, “May I return here afterward? I don’t want to return to Heaven any time soon.”
Chuck reached out to lay a hand on the shoulder of his second son, “I’m proud of you.”
“Movies,” Castiel realized, “Ok. Anyway, I spent a few hours on Earth, so this memory should satisfy your curiosity. We have to follow the glow of my true form.”
A few minutes later, the group stood across the road, watching the whole building burn.
Gabriel explained,
“Demons,” Sam croaked.
Sam rolled his eyes, “That’s Dean’s version of the ‘don’t hurt my little brother’ speech.”
“Or I would have been rendered powerless eons ago,” Lucifer added.
Dean complained to his Archangel hitchhiker.
After thousands of years of being hated, or worshipped by the psychotic, he felt like there was hope that he could change how he was perceived.
“You’re an ass,” Sam decided aloud.
Castiel knew he was mostly recovered, yet he stayed with Faith when she invited him to remain. He suspected that her time as a captive left her with an aversion to remaining alone. She had considered the idea and agreed with the assessment.
As Sam moved forward, she raised her wrists to present the cuffs and the chain which connected them to the floor.
“Vodka,” Dean said with a grin.
The stunned silence made Castiel brace himself for the impending explosion.
Castiel slowly turned his head to face her, “What is the emotion which makes me want to pull up the blanket and hide here forever?”
After lunch, Faith was introduced to the Shooting range before she ended up in the gym. Her thoughts regarding what she wanted to do with Sam were not helped by his description of ‘workout clothes’.
Gabriel ignored the movie, as he had seen it before. He watched the way Castiel and Dean were wrapped around each other and wondered if they were each afraid that the other would disappear.
“Will you get off my damn bed?”
“We were hunting with others from our community,” Sam said abruptly, “Do you know what happened to them?”
“Other supernatural creatures will be drawn to the raw power of your incomplete bond,” Chuck warned, “You don’t want to know how many creatures want to taste-test the mate of an Angel.”
Sam was not keen on the idea of experimenting with alcohol while Lucifer was riding shotgun in his head.
Balthazar was fascinated and horrified at the same time. Learning to enjoy taste and touch was a difficult process; he did not envy Castiel for having it thrust upon her.
Sam cleared his throat, “I agree with him, Dean. We have to do this properly to get Bobby out of Hell.”
“Your shoulder,” Castiel said worriedly, “Is it burning?”
Dean smirked, approving of her confidence, “She can say it,” he said snidely to Sam.
Faith wanted to smile at the stunned expression the man wore, “Castiel believes your soul was trying to deepen the bond to save his life.”
“Any indications of who set the trap?” Sam asked, “Smell of sulphur, or anything?”
“Yeah, to help Cas heal,” Dean explained, blushing slightly.
“I can, and I have,” Castiel said flatly, “Only the truly evil will be killed and Angels will look after the rest.”
4 – If you hate it, close the window and find something else.
Gabriel, Balthazar and Jane huddled together, as though they could remain safe through sheer proximity.
Dean ignored the sarcasm, as he usually did, “Well, then, it wasn’t a waste of time after all. Let’s grab dinner and get going.”
“Is it different without other people sitting on the same couch?”
Jane liked being alone, in small doses. Knowing Faith and Castiel were nearby was comforting, in a way she hadn’t expected. She was engrossed in book of warding sigils when the sound of footsteps alerted her to the presence of someone nearby. She glanced up to greet Faith or Castiel. The words died on her lips as Gabriel sauntered into view.
“Who wouldn’t prefer Alan Rickman?” Jane asked rhetorically.
Sam left to seek out Faith, which prompted Gabriel to make kissing noises in his wake.
“Cas keeps getting dragged into my memories,” Dean explained with a frown, “I keep having to pull him out.”
“Luci, come outside for a while,” Gabriel suggested, “There’s a whole town growing up there.”
Gabriel clicked his fingers, transporting himself and both brothers to the Interrogation room.
“I’ve warded the heck out of the perimeter,” Gabriel assured him, “Unless an Angel flies here directly, they won’t notice.”
“Would you two just hug, already?” Gabriel prompted.
Meg giggled at the horrified expression on Sam’s face and added, “Castiel is a good kisser.”
“You’re not allowed to disturb them until after dawn,” Gabriel added, “I might still win the non-bet with Sam.”
“Your brother is a douche,” Dean declared when he gave up on the assault of the wall.
“Just enjoy the slumber party, Deano,” Balthazar suggested, “It will become a daily routine.”
Faith shifted her weight off him and rolled to one side. She stretched out next to him with her head propped up by her bent arm.
As he resettled, Dean locked his eyes on his brother to search for signs of injuries. He ignored the way the Angel held him close, and the black wings enveloped him again.
Gabriel kept his expression neutral, though he was very tempted to make fun of the way Dean was staring at the newly female Castiel. He was aware of the moment the Angel realized that Dean was quite interested in her appearance.
“I’m Sam, and this is my brother Dean. We’re Hunters, and we inherited this place from our Grandfather last week. We had no idea you were down there.”
Faith was working on the books while Castiel was sorting every other item not yet recorded. He would wander over to tell her about interesting pieces regularly.
Dean didn’t reply, but the way he was staring at Castiel assured the Archangel that the plan would work.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
“Well, that’s nice. When I’m there permanently will it seem less fake?” Dean wondered.
“You were bigger in the movies,” Dean said to the velociraptor, “And those feathers don’t suit you. That obnoxious kid was right; you look like a big, half-naked turkey.”
Faith pulled Castiel’s limp form away from the Archangel. Jane stretched her hand out palm-first while her eyes glowed.
“How do I taste?” Sam asked in a whisper.
Gabriel watched Faith slowly relax. The human instinct to ignore knowledge which was dangerous should be considered a talent. He couldn’t resist the urge to point out the obvious conclusion;
He didn’t want to imagine how Dean would react to that.
“Geez,” Dean complained as he shifted to stand up, “Hold hands once and you’re bossing me around.”
Lucifer snorted, “That pathetic butt-kisser? How did you put up with him for so long?”
“So, it’s not an Angels-only cuddle-pile?” Sam clarified.
Chuck sat at the table in the library with his feet elevated. A laptop was open in front of him, showing a cat video and playing cheerful music.
“Very well,” Gabriel laughed, “Maybe too well, is all that moaning is to be believed.”
Kevin shrugged, “Maybe.”
The metal bar disappeared and Castiel pitched forward into Gabriel.
Faith held out her arms to look at the restraints closely. They were carved with symbols she recognised yet never knew their meaning.
“This Angel thing can be annoying,” Gabriel mused aloud, “This is the first prayer I’ve answered since I left Heaven; you should be honoured I showed up at all.”
Gabriel was tempted to keep Castiel and Dean trapped until they completed the bond. He could feel the Angels carrying out their orders; marking select humans and rendering the rest incapable of reproducing.
“Castiel should know about self-love, after his time with Dean,” the Archangel sighed.
“But where does it end?” Sam asked worriedly, “Humans have explored Eugenics and it led to the rise of the Nazis. The concern is not where it starts, but where it could lead.”
Dean glared at his brother, “Chuck can bloody well wait.”
“I owe him for Ellen and Jo,” Dean muttered.
“No, well, not really,” Sam tried to assure her, “But I think I know what makes my blood so attractive to you.”
“There are a few Angels worthy of conversation; Hannah and Inias, for example,” Castiel offered.
“Adam, if I’m not here when you wake up, I want you to know that I’m sorry you were dragged into this,” Sam said sadly, “You deserved better.”
Chuck regarded Castiel sternly, “Actually, it’s my job to judge you, Castiel, and I’m already sick of the pity party.”
Neither Chuck nor Samandriel had returned from their errand.
Sam listened as Dean launched into a description of a variety of television shows. Faith listened attentively, though she clearly didn’t understand most of it.
“I miss my wings,” Lucifer muttered.
“I can see the stupid questions forming in your brain,” Gabriel informed the Hunter, “Yes, Castiel has agreed; as if he cares if his vessel has internal or external sex organs. I think I can give his vessel a sex change, but I’ve never tried it before.”
Castiel heard Dean’s response, and his assertion that ‘Gabby’ could look after himself and one human. Her focus remained on the insistent voice in her head giving interesting advice.
Sam gaped at the Archangel, his mind struggling to avoid picturing that mess.
Balthazar and Jane ripped at the hole until it was wide enough for Faith to slip through comfortably.
Castiel knew he had developed emotional ties to other Angels, but the memories had been ripped out of his mind so thoroughly, there was no loyalty to Heaven left to keep him there.
Gabriel dropped in whenever he was bored, or he needed to leave Dean and Sam to ‘keep the timeline stable’. Castiel suspected the Archangel had taken a strange interest in Mrs Tran.
Dean heard the faint whisper in the back of his mind, an echo of words which hadn’t been spoken aloud.
“Are you, uh, craving blood?”
“Father wants me to lead an Earth-based Flock,” Gabriel explained.
Faith glanced down at her body, “I need a shower and some fresh clothes. They kept a box of stuff in the storeroom and let me change clothes and wash every few days.”
A gust of wind heralded the arrival of the Angel who had grabbed the humans.
Castiel could tolerate Balthazar. The blonde vessel melded to his Grace suited his friend and somehow expressed the casual confidence and endless curiosity which defined him.
“Having a creepy copy is better than being a permanent vessel,” Sam muttered.
“No,” Gabriel replied cheerfully, “I’ve taken care of the other pressing issues.”
“What’s wrong with you?” Dean barked.
Sam picked up a handful of sand and let the grains trickly between his fingers. Chuck sat down next to the Hunter and waited patiently.
Sam was back in control a moment later. Lucifer sulked in his mind, replaying Faith’s words to himself. He hated being parted from his Grace; everything felt more intense, and not in a good way.
“Dean! Stop!” he pleaded.
“Hold still, Castiel.”
Dean snatched up the pillow, pressed it over his face and screamed into the soft surface.
Castiel let his forehead press against Dean’s shoulder again. He gently dismantled the barrier he had put in place to keep his Grace from overwhelming Dean’s free will. He was sure he was so weak that he would be nothing except a shadow in the back of the Hunter’s thoughts.
“Only the relevant highlights of all six years,” Gabriel replied.
“Good,” Faith pulled away from him gently, “I just need a minute with Sam.”
“No closer, Sam!” Faith cried; her voice distorted by the fangs which slipped down from her top gums.
“Linda has also returned home,” Crowley added, “No Demon will bother her. There are a few posted close enough to make sure no-one else tries to hurt her.”
“You resent him.”
“And you?” Sam asked curiously.
Faith was tall for a woman, and her head still barely reached his shoulder.
11:00 - CLSX 105, WES 4037 - Near East
“What?” Dean demanded.
“Okay, we’ll just have to find something else to do.”  She pulled him backwards by his hair so they both splashed down.  She wriggled to the surface and wound her arm around his and led him back towards the deep end.  “Come along, sweetie.”
Dean rolled his eyes but didn’t respond.
Cas stared, open-mouthed.  His own cock twitched, and he shut the laptop with too much force.  His mouth felt dry. He didn’t dare move for a long moment. This was his friend, his neighbor, his classmate!  He had seen too much!
“Go ahead.”
There was the garden of the gods; all round him stood bushes bearing gems. Seeing it he went down at once, for there was fruit of carnelian with the vine hanging from it, beautiful to look at; lapis lazuli leaves hung thick with fruit, sweet to see. For thorns and thistles there were haematite and rare stones, agate, and pearls from out of the sea. While Castiel walked in the garden by the edge of the sea Chuck saw him, and he saw that he was dressed in the skins of animals and ate their flesh. He was distressed, and he spoke and said, ‘No mortal man has gone this way before, nor will, as long as the winds drive over the sea.’ And to Castiel he said, ‘You will never find the life for which you are searching.' Castiel said to glorious Chuck, ‘Now that I have toiled and strayed so far over the wilderness, am I to sleep, and let the earth cover my head for ever? Let my eyes see the sun until they are dazzled with looking. Although I am no better than a dead man, still let me see the light of the sun.'
Cas looks at him askance.
Sam cleared his throat, interrupting as gently as he could.  “What, uh, what kind of snacks did she pack?”
“Right.”  Dean latched on to Cas’ other side and helped him to the car.  “Cas, are you okay?”
“No, Dean.  Maybe there’s more to not being miserable than hoping that you can fix your life with medication.”
Dean rolled his eyes.  “You’re so literal.”
“I know,” he mumbled.  “It’s just me, just a habit, I guess.”
“Just removing temptation,” he replied, wedging the box atop and between two of the bags, where Dean would see it when he awoke but not accidentally squash it.
“The kitchen is all brand-new,” Cas explained, “at least since Gabe acquired the house.  He had it all redone as a favor for his ‘personal chef.’”
He finds here a number of pretty partners. Some, you will note, accept his offer to dance because he is new and handsome and so very tall, and at least one young lady has harboured secret hopes that another Winchester would ask her to dance and finds his brother an acceptable substitute. A few are advised by sturdy mothers and cautious chaperones that they may only say yes to a Winchester to prevent the necessity of sitting out the rest of the evening; who knows when Lord Novak may decide to take a turn at last, and hadn’t it better be with the young lady in question?
“But they’re not together anymore.”
“When did you watch it?”
‘In the first light of dawn all my household gathered round me, the children brought pitch and the men whatever was necessary. On the fifth day I laid the keel and the ribs, then I made fast the planking. The ground-space was one acre, each side of the deck measured one hundred and twenty cubits, making a square. I built six decks below, seven in all. I divided them into nine sections with bulkheads between. I drove in wedges where needed, I saw to the punt poles, and laid in supplies. The carriers brought oil in baskets, I poured pitch into the furnace and asphalt and oil; more oil was consumed in caulking, and more again the master of the boat took into his stores. I slaughtered bullocks for the people and every day I killed sheep. I gave the shipwrights wine to drink as though it were river water, raw wine and red wine and oil and white wine. There was feasting then as -there is at the time of the New Year's festival; I myself anointed my head. On the seventh day the boat was complete.
“Take it. Take what you wish, Dean.”
“You’re doing that on purpose.”
"I'm okay," she volunteered.
When Cas pulled away, Dean stared at him for a long moment.  At length, he asked, “Is this real?”
“Bitch.”
Towards the end of the page, he found more options.  For $1000, a Patron could make suggestions for Patronus-only videos, ones that would never reach Tutube.  The implication being that these weren’t limited to puritanical broadcast standards. Cas clicked on the thumbnail next to this tier and received a pop-up message:
“Yeah, looks like.”
“Hey, cut the telepathic crap, okay.  I wrote the fucking book on telepathic crap, you got it?  Now.  Is there any
“You’re not intimidated, are you, Cas?” Dean asks with a bold teasing eye.
The house was in chaos on the day of departure.  Even with Jody and Alex a day’s march ahead, the din of so many women clamoring to pack, eat, be gone made the very beams ring.  Donna thanked her lucky stars that Claire had the command of this lot; she had her hands full just ensuring that everyone had a cloak covering her armor and not the other way around.  How they’d gotten stuck with all the young folk was beyond her, with Jody so much better skilled at whipping the chatty ones into shape.
They make it official
“Oh.  Okay.”  Now Cas looked troubled.  “Dean?  It’s, um, it’s just a beer, though, right?  I mean, we couldn’t-” he pointed at Sam, asleep in the front seat.
Dean threw an arm around Castiel’s shoulders and steered him towards the cafe.
No sooner are the words spoken but the pair reappear, eyes bright with joy and lips perhaps a shade pinker, and they are all smiles. “Go tell them,” whispers Castiel. “I see my omniscient sister knows,” with a nod towards the ladies of the house.
Back on the highway, Sam asked about the snacks.
Would that pestilence had wasted mankind
“Castiel!”
Dean and Sam share a glance. “Attacked her, how, Jo?” Dean asks.

Where once we drew water for the water-skins.
From across the clearing, Kevan watched unbelieving as the house on stilts- not stilts. Chicken legs!  The house walked, on chicken legs, out of the trees and stood with an air of offended arrogance before its summoner.
“Yes, he’s the reason Gabe took an interest in the law in the first place.”
But Cas didn’t see Dean for almost two weeks after that grocery trip, and Cas worried.  Worried about Dean, mostly, but also worried that Dean was avoiding him. Dean was entirely responsible for Castiel instructing his profs to call him “Cas.”  He would be heartbroken to answer to the nickname if the bestower had decided he wanted nothing to do with him, after all. His handwritten notes for film class session #4 included a list of reasons Dean didn’t want to see him.
“There’s another on the left.  Just ahead.”
started it.  I think.  Anyway, point is, she can be stopped, but the real threat here is Sam.  He learned from the best.”
“PS- Practicing magic without a witch present can be dangerous, blah blah, I’m not responsible for your inexpertise, blah blah blah, don’t burn down your house.  No refunds.”
She just smiled.  “Now where does our jumper come in?”  She showed him the card. “Look at this derring-do!  The Knight of Swords is an impulsive lad, assertive, bit of a rebel.  Where our Knight of Cups is chivalrous and caring, the Knight of Swords will throw himself bodily into harm’s way to protect his loved ones.  Bit of a perfectionist, too, am I right?”
As Sam disappeared into the twilight, Cas cornered Dean, pressed him up against the granite countertop and smoothed his hands along his sides and his chest, ostensibly straightening his shirt.  He kissed him once, sweetly, without much heat.
“Today.  For the first time?”
Cas leaned forward, knuckles white against the tabletop, his eyes bright for the first time in, well, in a long time.  “What if we could make him want to be found?”
Was it mercy or cunning that prevented the witch's daughter from dealing with Dena that night in the crossroads?  A promise was made to meet again at the new moon.  At the sound of a search party advancing, the woman pressed a red carnation into Dena's hand and vanished.
Dean snorted, then broke, his head thrown back in laughter.  “Oh my god, Cas.” He stumbled away and braced his hands on his knees.  “Whoo!”
Her mother stepped into the clearing.
“He needs to know he’s needed.  We have to give him a reason to come home. And I believe the phrase is, ‘The more, the merrier.’”
“Not about Sam.”  Cas cleared his throat.  “About me.  About how I, um,
She is interrupted by the entrance of Mr Smith. He is unalarmed by the appearance of the visitors, Miss Novak looking quite blowsy and Lord Novak rather pale. He proceeds to tell Miss Winchester that her brother is “much as he was; if he does not improve soon, I should rather expect a very sudden decline.”
Abaddon --- ADAD: Storm-, rain-, and weather-god.
“Yes.”  It was the first thing Cas had said in a while, and it shook Dean out of his trance.
“In a minute,” Cas said, snagging Dean around the waist and pulling him close.
“Of course, I would know everything about you!”
Without taking his eyes off Dean's, Cas shifted until he had Dean right where he wanted him. Dean shivered as Cas blindly grabbed a fistful of ice and crammed it into his mouth.  Then he slurped in Dean's cock.
forest stretches for ten thousand leagues in every direction; who would willingly go down to explore its depths? As for Lucifer, when he roars it is like the torrent of the storm, his breath is like fire and his jaws are death itself. Why do you crave to do this thing, Castiel? It is no equal struggle when one fights with Lucifer, that battering-ram.’
“What?”

PROLOGUE : CASTIEL KING IN URUK
“We’re ready to order,” Cas replied.  “He’ll have a Moons Over My Hammy with a side of bacon, and I’ll have the Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity with blueberry and eggs overeasy.”  He handed the server their menus, and she scooted away.
“Nonsense! How could you be?” Castiel replies.
“Oh.  Sam let me know you were here, and it was worth the drive from Cali to see him a little early,” she laughed, wrapping herself around Sam’s arm and smiling up at him.  He smiled back like she was the only person in the room, hell, in the building, maybe the state.

“I’m confused.”
The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven cried to the Lord of URUK, to ANU the god of URUK: ‘A goddess made him, strong as a savage bull, none can withstand his arms. No son is left with his father, for Castiel takes them all; and is this the king, the shepherd of his people? His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble. When ANU had heard their lamentation the gods cried to Lilith, the goddess of creation, ‘You made him, O Lilith; now create his equal; let it be as like him as his own reflection, his second self; stormy heart for stormy heart. Let them contend together and leave URUK in quiet.'
“I don’t sound like that.”
The screen door slammed shut behind Dean.
“Spell-making is really not so arcane as books would have us believe.  I probably write a new spell every month or so.  And I’m just learning.”  He glances at Dean, then flinches.  “What?”
“You don’t like root beer?”
"Even if I could, surely the Queen wouldn't send her warriors to grovel at the feet of some ragged old ... witch's daughter."  She tilted her head.  "She doesn't know you’re here."
“You wanted a boyfriend.”
Then Amara, who is well-beloved and wise, said to Castiel, ‘This star of heaven which descended like a meteor from the sky; which you tried to lift," but found too heavy, when you tried to move it it would not budge, and so you brought it to my feet; I made it for you, a goad and spur, and you were drawn as though to a woman. This is the strong comrade, the one who brings help to his friend in his need. He is the strongest of wild creatures, the stuff of ANU; born in the grass-lands and the wild hills reared him; when you see him you will be glad; you will love him as a woman and he will never forsake you. This is the meaning of the dream.'
physics exam kicked my ass.  Heading home now. Appt @ 6- dinner at yours?
Cas tried.  “Ow!  Yes but no.”
“Yeah, Kevan?”
Dean smiled.  “No, you don’t.”  He thumped the steering wheel.  “Tell you what, find a few songs we’ll both like, and when we swap out drivers at Castiel’s place, you can listen to whatever Lilith Fair crap flips your skirt.”
He heard stirring downstairs.  He was not prepared to eat any breakfast; packing the car might buy him some time before his mother insisted on him sitting down at the table.  He put in his Airpods and grabbed his coat, a lamp, and the garment bag.
“Works for me,” Dean said, collecting his things and shuffling his chair backwards.  It made an awful scraping noise on the concrete. Cas winced, but Dean didn’t notice.  He was already waiting by the twin front doors, his back to his own.
Sam nodded.  “He likes you.”
Snap decisions weren’t his specialty.  “Y-yes,” he mumbled. “It’s not in the schedule, but yes.  I’d like that.”
While Dean lay alone in his sickness he cursed the gate as though it was living flesh, ‘You there, wood of the gate, dull and insensible, witless, I searched for you over twenty leagues until I saw the towering cedar. There is no wood like you in our land. Seventy-two cubits high and twenty-four wide, the pivot and the ferrule and the jambs are perfect. A master craftsman from NIPPUR has made you; but O, if I had known the conclusion! If I had known that this was all the good that would come of it, I would have raised the axe and split you into little pieces and set up here a gate of wattle instead. Ah, if only some future king had brought you here, or some god had fashioned you. Let him obliterate my name and write his own, and the curse fall on him instead of on Dean.'
Pamela --- NINHURSAG / NINKI: Sumerian mother-goddess; one of the four principal Sumerian gods with An, Enlil, and Ea; sometimes the wife of Ea, she created all vegetation. The name means 'the Mother'; she is also called 'Nintu', lady of birth, and KI, the earth. NINKI: 'mother' of Enlil, probably a form of NINHURSAG.
“Anna!” The two women embrace in sympathy.
"Mom.  Leave it."
Dean apologized for not having much food on hand.  He stuck his head in the fridge.  “There’s not much here that’s edible.  Haven’t been shopping this week because of leaving town.  But we still got a little bit of Friday’s Chinese food, Sam, and (what is that, half a can?) of Spaghetti-O’s.  Oh, and a few frozen burritos, too.”  He turned around to catch their wary glances.  He looked again.  “We still have milk and eggs to use up, and a shitload of bacon.  Sam, check the cabinet for pancake mix.”
“Too tired to eat?”
“No, I’m fine.  Wait.  Do they have peanuts?”
Although when it came to hyper-organization, Dean was just as bad, if not worse. Suffice to say that Sam had never thought to color-code the kitchen cabinets. And then there was the time Dean had blown his top over the DVDs: "It's simple alphabetizing, Sam;
“This evening.”
“I don’t know.  It feels like a hundred years since I got- since you broke-”  He shook his head in frustration.  “Dammit, I can’t talk about this.”
MEG AND CASTIEL, AND THE DEATH OF DEAN
Dean cannot sing and does not care
He heard a slight chuckle and felt a hand cupping the base of his skull. Dean pulling him close.  Their mouths met. Dean’s lips tasted red, salty; Cas wondered if a kiss could be
"It does look spacious."
"What's going on, Cas?"
“He will,” Cas assured him.  “This isn’t his first rodeo.”
“Is that bad?”
“I don’t get why my plant is dying.  I should ask Professor Sprout if there’s a spell or a charm to-”
And of course, Dean, who had spent such a long time negotiating with Sam for the privilege of driving him to school for the start of his last year, balked at sharing the trip with a guy who lived a whole day out of the way. Somewhat reluctantly, he had agreed to call the dude and hammer out the details, and somewhat reluctantly, he had hung up after almost two hours.
“Right, yeah.”
“Perhaps it is,” Dean allows. He pulls his husband close and kisses him breathless. “Congratulations, Castiel: you shall have not one but two daughters to grace your sad bachelor’s home!”
Dean paused.  “Cas, I can’t let you do that.”
His smile swiftly fades. The note is short: “Dean, it pains me to leave your side so suddenly and knowing you to be again struck ill. Though I am beside myself with greif for your fragile state, I am afraid we must away at once. You will become acquainted with the situation soon enough, and I do not wish to recount it here. If this letter should reach you before Friday, I beg that you and Miss Winchester will contrive to dine with my sister and me at the Elk and Marmot, as we depart for Derbyshire immediately thereafter. Judging by your state at my leaving, I rather despair of your coming. I am half agony, half hope. I bid you will write to me when you are recovered, for I shall not enjoy another moment of comfort until I know that you are quite out of danger. Beleive me to be ever - Yours most sincerely, Cas. Novak”

is how he makes a living,” Cas hissed through his teeth.  He was torn between a prudish distaste for what was clearly some sort of prostitution, and relief that Dean would not go hungry.
“Krispy Kreme,” he rasped with all the enthusiasm he could muster.  Which was not much.  He inhaled the scented air escaping the vent and sighed, if not happily at least contentedly.  “Thank you, Dean.”

“Yes, Dean. Lead on.”
There was a longer pause, a heavy sigh, and then the sound of heeled boots on wooden floorboards.  The face that appeared in the doorway surprised Kevan: the voice was gruff and coarse, but the face remarkably younger than she had expected.  Also she had a lovely beard, trim and neat.  She squinted down at the visitors.  "No, you can't.  But I'll let you in anyway.  You've got spunk."  The hut sank to its knees and allowed the two women to cross the threshold.
“Please.”
Sam startled awake to the sound of men shouting outside the vehicle.  His mind slowly coupled the idea
“No Latin, no goofy rhymes, no-”
“Whatever it was,” Dean breathed, “it was fucking awesome.”
“Um, that’s fine.  I can change it now.”
Dean raises his chin as firmly as he dares. ”It meant nothing.”
was a woman of low birth, the natural daughter of someone. They became acquainted during the summer the Winchesters spent in Lyme. The year his sister eloped. Had he stayed near Alex that night, as he had promised Father so faithfully to do, instead of allowing himself to be charmed away by a pretty face and eager hands, none of this would have happened! To this day, of course, he blames himself for everything: for Alex’s unhappy marriage, for Emma’s ignoble station (and her mother’s), for allowing the family to fall apart under such circumstances.
The bluest eyes, the bluest blue to blue:
“Why not?”
“It’s getting dark,” Cas observed, glancing west at the clouds fading from pink to purple.
“-the gambling, yes, the clubs-”
“No, she’s not a prisoner.”  Dena gazed to the fireside where the women in question sat crouched, deep in their own conversation.  “Charlie!”  She snagged her hem as she passed, arresting her movement.  She stood and positioned herself between Charlie and the fire.  “What do you see over there?”
So Dean lay stretched out before Castiel; his tears ran down in streams and he said to Castiel, ' O my brother, so dear as you are to me, brother, yet they will take me from you.' Again he said, ‘I must sit down on the threshold of the dead and never again will I see my dear brother with my eyes.'
He went to the forge and said, 'I will give orders to the armourers; they shall cast us our weapons while we watch them.' So they gave orders to the armourers and the craftsmen sat down in conference. They went into the groves of the plain and cut willow and boxwood; they cast for them axes of nine score pounds, and great swords they cast with blades of six score pounds each one, with pommels and hilts of thirty pounds. They cast for Castiel the axe ‘Might of Heroes' and the bow of ANSHAN; and Castiel was armed and Dean; and the weight of the arms they carried was thirty score pounds.

Dean snorted. "Please."

Dean nodded, willing to let it slide.  For now.  “Prozac, mostly.”
He didn’t bother to respond, just walked out.  Where?  There must have been an acre of marble.
You know, of course, that the Winchesters left the party quite abruptly. You know Mr Winchester’s feelings upon quitting the Vessel Hill picnic, but I have barely spoke of the sister and the brother. You do not know how Jo, safely ensconced in the carriage, immediately weeps her apologies to her brothers.
When he had cursed the Trapper to his heart's content he turned on the harlot. He was roused to curse her also. ‘As for you, woman, with a great curse I curse you! I will promise you a destiny to all eternity. My curse shall come on you soon and sudden. You shall be without a roof for your commerce, for you shall not keep house with other girls in the

“Not really.”

Dean shrugged.
“What?”
“I hope that’s one of the ones he washed.  You don’t want to get spiders in your hair.  Or worse.”
“Dean.”  He pulled Dean’s hand into his own and petted his knuckles.

Kevan couldn’t sleep.  She recognized the sleeping arrangements as a preventive measure.  Her heart ached.  She couldn’t leave Charlie, couldn’t abandon camp a second time, not without extreme repercussions.  Assuming their plan worked and she saved Sam and everything returned to the way it had been, would she be allowed to return?  Would she be branded a deserter?
“Um.  What, what?”
The sweetness of her countenance glows just a bit brighter. “I will,” she whispers.

But even now, with Claire out of danger of immanent death, Cas could not let go of the pain. He was supposed to protect Claire, he was meant to keep her from harm, and he failed. Cas hung his head and wrung his fists.
“So what, my soul’s in Heaven while my body’s on ‘pause?’” Claire gestured with air-quotes.
Another pregnant pause and then a voice responded, “I was on my way to Des Moines, passing through town when I heard of some trouble down by Hastings.” Claire took as deep a breath as she could, “It sounded like a run of the mill salt and burn, so I thought I might as well take care of it.” She coughed, “I wouldn’t- I wouldn’t’ve gone alone if I knew.”
Claire didn’t say anything back as she walked into the light.
“Claire?” Worry strained Cas’s voice.
“I know.” Jack laughed, “but they’re my dads.”
And then the line went dead.

Two years later Dean found himself washing dishes after dinner. Sam and Eileen had come over to celebrate Jack’s first day of kindergarten. They still lived in the bunker, while Dean, Cas, and Jack moved into a house a few hours away, on the edge of a town with good schools and a zoo (Dean had insisted on the former, Cas on the latter).
was Cas. His hair was a mess, like he’d been running his fingers through it (or a yard rake). Underneath his eyes were puffy and red, like he’d been crying. But he smiled. Through tears he seemed to practically sing, “Hello Dean.”

revolve around trying to stay alive for once. It wasn’t a lie, he loved spending time with his son, but it also wasn’t the full truth. Being with Jack, working on heaven like it was an old car in need of a tune up, it was a good opportunity to bide his time. He knew he’d have to face Dean one way or another, but he didn’t expect it to be so soon.
Cas goes quiet.
“Hello Claire.”
“Jack saved me.” She tried to shrug but couldn’t.
Claire laughed before turning toward the portal.
Claire gasped, “A shapeshifter. It was taking the form of dead loved one’s to lure prey. I tracked it to its nest. I killed it, but not without a fight.” She fell silent once more.
, he wanted to say,
“I-“ Claire breathed.
. Or maybe
When Dean pulls back he looks bewildered, “Did you just Han Solo me?”
“He heard your prayers.” Claire responded and Dean sucked in a sharp breath. “I was bleeding out too fast for you to make it in time, so he put my bodily functions on pause, at least until I was healed, and my soul went to chill with him in Heaven in the meantime. It felt like we spoke for maybe fifteen minutes tops, but I guess hours passed.” She flashed a glance at Cas, “You always said time worked differently there.”
“Hey kid.” Dean lightly stroked her cheek with his thumb, “You had us scared for a minute.”
The static-y crackle of silence continued.
Dean nodded and, true to his word, Cas screwed to top back onto the antiseptic cream and set it back on the counter by the bowl of the sink. He picked up the roll of medical tape and began tearing four strips, which he set aside. He worked carefully and quietly, leaving Dean exposed, cold, and a little embarrassed. Silently Cas picked up a large piece of clean gauze and tenderly put it in place over the freshly treated wound. Cas let his hand linger for a moment—a warm, stable presence.
They pull away and Dean has tears in his eyes.
“Face me?”
“Claire,” Cas tried again, “Can you tell us what happened? How are you injured?”
“Nebraska,” her heavy breathing crackled against the speaker, “I’m in a- a barn off the 281 just outside H- Hastings.”
“We- we love you too kid. Just-” Dean tried to clear the lump in his throat, “Just stay awake, okay? Claire, you need to stay awake.”
“Wait, Cas—”
Cas inhaled sharply and tears sprang to his eyes but did not fall.
“I love you, dad.” She echoed.
“You’re right.” Jack sighed, “I am breaking my own code as we speak, although this seemed to be slightly less interference than just using my mojo to heal you good as new. I’m only giving you a better chance at survival.”
. Dean lets that feeling propel him forward. For a moment, Cas looks scared, like Dean is winding up for a punch, but the minute the hunter has him in his arms, the angel melts.
Dean could feel the words like pearls forming on his tongue, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he would string them together.
Dean left the tension at the bathroom sink as he hurried after the other man, and let his doubt swirl down the drain like bloody water.
made for them. They’d filled up on roast chicken, rosemary potatoes, and laughter.
Dean’s eyes crinkle, “What?”
Cas smiles, “Yes, Dean.” and kisses the hunter again for good measure, “I’d like that very much.”
When he pulls Baby to a stop and gets out of the car, he and the angel are standing opposite one another on either side of the road. For a moment, they just look at each other. Cas’s face is just as pinched and unreadable as Dean feels. There’re several feelings that pass through the hunter. The first is anger. That was always the one closest to the surface, and it’s easy to feel now. It’s easy to question where the hell Cas has been hiding, and why. To be angry that Cas
Claire looked out over the edge of a bridge onto a creek.
Jack laughed, “You’re welcome.” he teased.
Jack looked down at the ground. It was strange to see God look so sheepish and childlike. Then again, he was only four years old.
Dean tried not to snap about the stack of clean, wet dishes piling up, only raised a brow at his brother as he set another plate in front of him.
“Let’s take a walk.” he suggested and began heading off the bridge and down a path. Claire followed suite and the two went further into the woods.
The grin on Jack’s face shifted but his expression didn’t dim.
His family had sat around
“You aren’t dead Claire, but if I hadn’t intervened you would be.” Jack explained. “You were beginning to lose too much blood.”
Dean quickly but still gingerly re-dressed. He remained standing where he was as Cas moved to wash his hands, shaking the water off the tips of his fingers before turning to wipe them on a towel.
“Dean.” Cas says, and it comes out like a whimper.
“Jack.” She greeted, eyes wide. She glanced around at her surroundings and suddenly it occurred to her, “Does this mean I’m dead?”
“But if I’m not dead, why am I here?” she gestured vaguely around her.
“Your phone died while they were on the road talking with you.” Jack explained, “They tried to call you back a few times, and when you didn’t pick up they started to really panic. Cas thought you might have…” he gave Claire a sympathetic glance before continuing, “So, they prayed to me on your behalf and now,” Jack spread out his arms, “here we are.”

The third emotion, and the one he decides to stick with, is relief. Cas is here. He found him. Cas is
Dean had just given his goodbye speech to Sammy and could feel the cold end coming. He had plenty practice in dying and knew the feeling well, when it was his time. Just before his eyes could slip shut, the sound of wings caught his ear, and then a familiar face appeared before him. At first, Dean thought that those blue eyes were his personal white light that he would follow into the great beyond and all that crap. Then, even in his fuzzy half-consciousness, a creeping fear washed over him that a reaper was wearing Cas’ face to taunt him. Though he didn’t have the strength to do anything about it, his heart seized at the thought that his memory of the angel would be perverted by Hell. He couldn’t let that happen. He wouldn’t—
“Kiddo, I think you should probably get some more rest.” Dean offered, brushing back her hair from her forehead.
“Dean I don’t understand what you’re trying to say.” Cas says, desperation creeping on the edges of his voice.
like the still baby-soft skin under Jack’s feet that he presses against Dean’s stomach on those nights he has a bad dream and can only sleep if he’s sandwiched between his dad and daddy.
Later, Cas would explain that Jack had retrieved him from the Empty, but had remained firm that no angels would again walk the Earth. When they realized what would happen to Dean, Cas asked to intervene. To maintain Jack’s new order, he would be sent with only enough juice to stop Dean from dying, but then would remain human and powerless. The now former angel had gotten to the barn with just enough time to save Dean, but it wasn’t enough to prevent a stay at the hospital or even accelerate the healing process.
But that was the thing wasn’t it? The one true thing that had been proven over and over again—that time was never a guarantee.
“Do you want to take a ride with me?” Dean asks after a while.
breathing.
“Cas?” his brother had whispered, voice wrecked and desperate. Dean could not wait for the answer and lost consciousness with Sam’s voice in his ears, with that name washing over him.
“Jack.” was all Cas had replied, bewildered as he gathered his son into his arms.
Dean picked up on the third ring.
“Claire, I know I’ll never replace your father-“ Cas began to say.
“Sorry,” she sucked in a breath, “to wake you,”

On the first day Chuck was defeated, and the world returned.
The sleep faded from his green eyes as his gaze fell onto the bed.
A pained whine came from Dean’s throat, like he was trying to stifle a cry.
Dean glanced over in shock to Cas.
to face you.” Cas replies, so plainly Dean almost chokes on it.
. But he didn’t say any of that. He didn’t need to either.
Dean stilled at that. He’d heard those words before from a different mouth. John would bark them out like a slap. But the tone in Sam’s voice made Dean pause.
“I love you.” She exhaled sharply.
“Has the bleeding stopped?” Dean asked, his gentle coaxing tone wavering.
“Heaven?” Jack filled in, “No, it is.”
The jab fell flat as Dean’s slowly waking brain registered the way her breath rattled over the line, “Claire are you hurt?”
“What you said,” Dean begins again, “it opened up pandora’s box, man. I’d been operating under some wrong assumptions for so long that having them contradicted, and then not being able to get any clarity after… I thought I knew how painful losing you could be, I thought I’d been down that road before, but this time was different.
table in
So, when the wins began to pile up in rapid succession, Dean didn’t know how to deal.
Dean sits with this, worries it like his lip between his teeth.
Claire looked up at Castiel. He had the same face as Jimmy, but there was no mistaking it was Cas. He’d gotten older, worn by the trials of the past decade, and that showed on his face. But so did the laugh-lines and creases by his eyes, all of which Cas owned, not Jimmy. Claire looked at Cas like she was seeing him for the first time, and even then it felt familiar.
Dean tries to find more words, but the well comes up empty. Instead of saying anything, he takes a hand and cups Cas’s face. For a moment he just looks. He sees the tears building in the angel’s eyes, and he thinks back to that day. Cas crying out his confession one moment and then being gone the next. He thinks about what he wished he could do then, when it was too late. But, this is heaven, and it’s never too late.
On the flip side, this situation with Claire was his first real brush with human sorrow. The harrowing depths of despair Cas’d experienced at seeing Claire so broken and the putrid mix of shock and pain still lingered, leaving the ex-angel near dizzy with it.
“Dammit Cas,” Dean takes a deep breath and sighs, “just- just tell me what’s going on.”
Claire raised a single brow, “So this is not…” she trailed off.
“Claire are you with us?” Dean tried.
On those days he’d retreat into himself. He’d be quiet. He’d feel a magnetic tug try and pull him to the bar down the block, even though it had been a long while since he’d picked up so much as a beer.
“D-Dean.” Claire gasped.
“Dean, I can’t-” Claire had not sounded so baldly distraught since her mother died, and it made both men ache.
“You do have me.” Jack said as he pulled away, “I’m everywhere.”
“Claire, it’s going to be alright,” Cas tried to soothe, “you just need to stay awake.”
“You think this is a punishment for your past.” Cas had said with his usual unnerving baldness, “But in fact it is a sign of your current blessing.”
“Claire!” he exclaimed as he rushed to her other side opposite Cas. He leaned over her and lightly cupped her jaw.
Cas seemed to fully wake at that, sitting up and placing a hand on Dean’s back. Dean glanced over his shoulder at his sleep-rumpled ex-angel and put the phone on speaker.
Castiel was suddenly reminded of another hospital bed. Of Claire’s anger and blame and hurt towards him. Of the desire to do right by her even if she wanted nothing to do with him.
“He knows,” she grinned. Another silence fell, a more comfortable one this time.
“Cas,” She cut him off, “Don’t go there.”
“Have you called anyone?” Cas asked as he slipped on shoes, not bothering changing his sleep clothes. Dean did the same and grabbed for his keys.
“Hey Castiel.” She squeezed his hand. He looked down at where their hands met on the bed.
I felt the way I did. That last time though, it was different because of what you said. I knew you wouldn’t—” Dean cleared his throat, “You wouldn’t say all that if you thought you were coming back. And then on top of the knowledge that this was really,
“Cas and Dean both prayed to me asking for help.” Jack shrugged.
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face.
There was no verbal response, just ragged breathing crashing against the speaker.
Jack gave her a toothy grin, “Yeah, sort of. I mean I wish we could have met under better circumstances, but the way Cas and Dean talked about you, I’ve considered you family for a long while.”
Practically born with a gun in his hand, for the longest time Dean was certain he’d die that way, empty and starving and hard as stone.
“Sorry,” Cas mumbled apologetically, “I’m almost done.”
Like it always does, the anger ebbs almost as quickly as it comes, and Dean is left feeling despair, like someone shook a soda can up and let the pressure build only for it to be empty when it finally pops. Flashbacks of the last time Dean saw Cas roll through his mind and all he can think is
Cas grins, a cocksure look he picked up over the years, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Next to Sam, awake and
“So,” she asked, “what happens next?”
Cas and Dean shared a heartbroken glance.
“Cas and Dean were-“
He had not touched a gun in over a year.
“Like I got stabbed.” Claire tried to deadpan, but when neither man laughed she kept talking, “Like I saw the ghost of my dead dad who left me. Like I’m high on morphine probably. Like I met God.”
In the distance, Dean can see a person in the field, standing stalk still like an extra in
“Claire I-“ he sniffed. Unable to find the words he squeezed her hand back.
, and the world was free. Dean didn’t know how to trust it, even though it was all he wanted. If he allowed himself to indulge in hope, he knew he wouldn’t survive having it taken away. If he filled himself up with it all, he’d risk feeling a hunger he couldn’t turn away from.
Castiel experienced many emotions when Jack first informed him that Dean Winchester was in heaven. At first there was a great cloud of sadness. Hs grief was so strong it made the seraph woozy. Dean had died too young. It wasn’t fair and it wasn’t right. He’d seen Dean’s soul and he knew that this was how the hunter always expected it would happen, but that didn’t stop Castiel from wanting more for him. Knowing that Chuck was defeated gave him hope, but some things are inevitable. Dean was always going to die.
Claire rolled her eyes, “I promised I would
“I had wished you and Jack would one day meet.” Cas admitted.
She’d never met him before, but there was a pull, like a gut instinct, that told her who he was.
Claire smiled at the picture of all the people she loved most being together. Warmth washed over her at the thought before a wave of fatigue hit her especially hard. As she began to fall back into unconsciousness she could still feel both hands in hers, like two anchors allowing her the safety to drift.
“Claire, before on the phone, you said something,” Cas took a deep breath, “and I thought it might have been the shapeshifter or a delusion. But-“ he sighed, “Do you know what you said?”
Dean took on a few hours here and there at a local garage and Cas occasionally set up a stall at the Saturday farmer’s market when his garden was doing particularly well or when the bees he kept were especially busy, but in all manners that really counted they were retired. Sam and Eileen kept things held down on the hunting front, and Dean surprised himself to find he was more than fine to walk away.
The ache in Dean’s back was like a firm hand guiding him forward.
“Cas?” Dean asked as the other man began to walk out of the bathroom. The ex-angel stopped in the doorway and turned to face him. “Thank you.” Dean breathed, a hot flush rushing high on his cheeks.
“It’s ok,” Jack nodded, “I know it’s difficult to express it, but you love them the same way I do. And, they love you right back. You’re their family, and in some way we are too.”
) to Amara for safe keeping until he was ready to assume that power and join her in a balance of light and darkness. This transference resulted in Jack assuming a form that reflected his human age, allowing him to be the child he’d never got the chance to be. It was an opportunity Dean never had, and one he didn’t know how badly he wanted for Jack until he had an armful of toddler pressed into his hip—until the sweet smell of his son’s hair tucked itself under his nose.
like the mid-morning sun that filters in through their kitchen window and stirs the dust-bunnies into a dance. Those mornings when Dean is cocooned in warmth, a cup of coffee in his hand, Jack pressed up against his back, and Cas flush with his side, holding his face in big hands, leaning down for a soft kiss—
“We’ll be here when you wake up again.” Cas assured, “Jody and Kaia will likely be here by then, and Sam and Eileen are on their way too.”
, “sleeping beauty.”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas croaked.
“Well, the way I’d left things—”
echoed in his head, “Yeah, I guess so.”
, Dean thought with a plate in his hand, like the sheets on the bed that he shares.
“There’s too many bodies” the young hunter bit out. “to explain to the EMTs.” Claire gasped sharply, panic started to seep into her voice, “there were so many.”
“How are you feeling?” Dean asked.
Dean laughs with his belly, and Cas laughs too. They’re both laughing and kissing and suddenly, Dean thinks, it feels like paradise.
“Every time you died before, it hurt like hell. I mean I‘d spend weeks doing stupid crap like drinking my liver sore and getting reckless on hunts. But, then you’d be back before I could do anything too stupid and before I could even think about
“What you said.” Dean begins.
After a moment of hesitation Claire exhaled, “yeah.” She breathed, quiet and ashamed, and maybe a little bit desperate. For the first time since Dean knew her, she sounded as young as she was.
Claire’s eyes began to droop. She blinked to try to keep them open.
Before he could self-destruct or leave his body long enough that it could do itself harm, he’d feel Cas at his side or Jack’s weight on his chest. He’d go to bed early and when he’d wake the next morning the pit would be gone.
“Well,” Jack pointed a few yards ahead where a particularly large sunbeam, like a skylight, fell onto the ground, “Up ahead I’ve created a portal. When that light touches you, your soul will be returned to your body and it will officially unfreeze, although you should be completely out of the danger of dying from blood loss. If I’ve timed this right, you will wake a day later in the hospital.” Jack grimaced, “Sorry about that.”
“You’ve gone soft.” Sam replied.
“After what I—” Cas sighs, “
On the third day Cas was human, for good this time. Amara had given him a human soul, which kept him out of the Empty’s reach. He’d stood in the middle of the bunker’s library, flustered and confused, coat and tie disheveled, and Dean had stopped breathing.
“Is the claw still in you?” Cas asked as calmly as he could.
“I called you.” Claire huffed, and even through the phone, Dean could feel her eyes roll.
Jack grinned in a way that was almost unsettling; in a way that Claire knew was the all-knowing, all-powerful deity shining through his teenage body like a sunbeam through a cloud.
him in the first place, left him so that Dean had to die in order to see him again, and then didn’t even come to the welcome party.
Claire’s face warmed into a smile, “yeah sure thing.” She pulled him into a hug, “I wish we could have had more time to get to know each other on Earth. It would’ve been nice to have a brother.”
be on edge, but it was almost like that part of her brain was blocked off. In its place was an eerie calm that did not belong to her.
Dean kept shooting Cas cursory glances over the past few hours waiting in the hospital, and when they were both sat next to each other, would squeeze his hand reassuringly. ‘It will all be ok,’ he seemed to say with each touch, although Cas suspected this was for Dean’s sake as much as his own. When Dean fell asleep and his head came to rest on Cas’s shoulder, the added weight was grounding and welcome.
daughter.”
Castiel could hear the audio ripple from one headphone to the other, tickling his scalp.
“Okay.  Cas, you hungry, bud?”
“Betrayal!” Dean exclaims, then falls silent. His reticence only grows as his sister’s story continues.
Dean took a step backwards.  “I’m fine, Cas. What’s, uh, what’s going on?”
Cas sighed.
5  thinks I’m boring
He nodded.  “Good.  Yes.  Perfect.  So, I guess that’s it.  Make yourselves at home.  But don’t get too comfortable.  Stay alert, okay?”  He waited as everyone nodded and muttered various affirmations.  He exhaled sharply and turned to Cas.  “You ready?”
Claire’s mouth turned down. “Why can’t I go, too? It’s just a little vamp nest!”
She smiles too, shaking her head. “You are both of you gentlemen, and he has a fortune and-”
He made his bed and crawled in, filthy as he was.  He put on a white-noise video and fell asleep.
"Me neither," he returned, "but I sure want to find out with you."
“As soon as it may be contrived. Tomorrow, if possible.”
Movie Night in the Bunker
“You can just say it.  Not a trace of irony, you just say it.”
“Good morning, Castiel.  How did you sleep?” Naomi asked.
“Hey sorry, didn’t know you were awake.”
“I once counted a hundred apologies in one day.”  He leaned back and took in Dean’s soft expression.  “I’m not uneducable, you see.  And neither are you.  It’s just a matter of learning new habits and unlearning the bad ones.”
She had one opening left for the month, and it was at 7 that evening.  Cas checked the clock. 6:54. He decided it was kismet and requested the consultation.
“Dean,” Sam admonished.
The last two tiers appeared to be based on a bidding system.  The highest monthly bidder in the first of the auction options got to select which Patronus-only video Dean would make for his top-tier Patrons, from all $1000-subscriber suggestions.  But the highest monthly bidder in the second auction received an exclusive video chat. One one-on-one video per month, to the highest bidder. Cas couldn’t understand why this should be the last tier, when every other option had seemed to escalate in value.  How much was anyone really willing to pay to chat with a Tutuber?
“Michael
Michael has appointed Lucifer to guard it and armed him in sevenfold terrors, terrible to all flesh is Lucifer. When he roars it is like the torrent of the storm, his breath is like fire, and his jaws are death itself. He guards the cedars so well that when the wild heifer stirs in the forest, though she is sixty leagues distant, he hears her. What man would willingly walk into that country and explore its depths? I tell you, weakness overpowers whoever goes near it; it is not an equal struggle when one fights with Lucifer; he is a great warrior, a battering-ram. Castiel, the watchman of the forest never sleeps.'
Dean turned his head.  “You did this for me?”
“At least our Castiel hasn’t been corrupted,” she said with a sickly sweet smile towards her youngest.  “Eat your eggs, dear, and then you can see about the car. I’ll discuss the change in plans with your father.”  She then turned the conversation to less urgent matters.
had an idea for a video you could help me w/. Remind me to tell you @ dinner.  CU soon
At this, Crowley outright laughed.  "Don't be stupid: fae don't have souls."  Her mirth died when she looked again at her visitor.  She leaned forward, peering intently.  "You're a changeling.  Fuck me, you're a BLOODY CHANGELING!"
