“Thabz hard attacks,” said Clint thickly, around a swelling nose. “Seriuzzly, Dony, what’s our blay?”
“While I watched,” said Peter.
shit. People are saying you were in a real no-shit coma.”
“I’m pretty convincing,” said Sam.
“India,” said the boy.
“Rogers, what are you doing out?”
Sam shrugged. “I guess I figured you’d get the whole, he’ll-punch-you-in-the-face subtext, from that story I just told you. No?”
"Oh, thank God. I was wondering where I was going to change into my bathing suit."
“So I hear Banner had a case of the Mondays in History today,” Tony said casually, as Steve tried to focus on
“We’re in what?”
“Has anyone actually checked if Barton’s got a liscence?” Tony said sourly.
“I know, that’s their beauty. Lightweight, tempered aluminum, look like nothing at all, but these puppies can take five hundred pounds of pressure per square centimeter before they buckle. You get hit in the face with one, it’s gonna leave a mark. But they feel and wear just like rings—sleepable, comfortable. They’re rust-proof, so she can take ‘em in the shower if she wants to, feel less vulnerable there. They’re slightly articulated—basically, she could play piano in ‘em without compromising dexterity. Or, you know. Just knock seven bells out of anyone who bothered her. I think your girlfriend will like them.”
“Who does Clint have a crush on?”
Carol’s nose wrinkled. “Still wanna claim the high ground on advice-giving?”
From the distance, Ned comes up to him with a smile on his lips in which he returns with a grin.
From the distance, Peter continued his song. He glances to the right, seeing a hologram of them in a Winter's Ball when they first met. He looks at it as his grips on those letters tightens.

is living a better life without him.” Natasha accidentally voices her words in Russian. Little Spider.
—!” Drax yells loudly.
“I think it’s because Peter wants to burn it in front of him, just like he said.” Wanda replies a little too happy.
Despite that, Peter still thinks that they’re the best of friends.
Their position from earlier has been flipped 180°, now Flash’s back is facing the fireplace while Peter’s back is facing the Avengers. They can finally see Flash’s expression, figure and face—and agrees simultaneously that they despise him and he’s worth the kill.
The Avengers watch Ned fled the scene in panic, slightly annoyed that they didn’t received answers.
? I was not aware of what you’re planning?” Bruce fix his glasses up, staring at Tony for his answer.
!” Ned protests in alarm, holding the Pad with shivering hands.
He doesn’t really know what his costumes are called but they felt comfortable to wear. He did however, noticed the more elegant and graceful look on his costume if they were compared with Flash’s clothing.
“Perhaps, he was too embarrassed and shy to reveal it?” Wanda deducts in wonder.
“MJ! You’re done with the cast's costume?” Ned glance to MJ—Michelle—curiously, slightly glad that she stopped Peter from continuing his rant.
! Yeah, try not to create a ruckus—we'll catch up in a bit. Please follow me, Mr. Stark and Mr. Banner.” Ned swiftly led the two geniuses from the group. Tony took this chance to circle his hand on Bruce's shoulder.
“What exactly did Peter tell her? To make him have such a breakdown afterwards?” Stephen remarks in uncertainty.
“Stop treating me like a dog, I got a job to
The Avengers once again quiet down abruptly, silence fills the scene.

“He's more a baby Spider if you ask me.” Natasha chuckles softly.
, man.” Clint murmurs with a dark expression.
“We’re currently heading into the Center Balconies in level three. With the Proscenium style stage this Theater has, it should be the best place to watch the play.” Ned explained steadily. He considered putting the Avengers in the Grand Circle in level one so that they can see Peter closely, but he didn’t doubt that he would notice them immediately. With all of the story Peter told Ned, the Avengers create a huge mess and ruckus when they’re not out saving the world.

“I assure you that staying away from that person is the best solution.” Vision states.
“Oh, well then in that case yeah, of course I did, you’re just now figuring tha—,” said Tony, cut off mid-sentence by Steve’s kiss. Behind them, the door swung shut, and Tony moaned into Steve’s mouth, bringing his hands to Steve’s jawline and walking them both backwards to the beds, where Steve’s knees buckled and they tumbled over each other into the lower bunk.
“I heard Rogers was hitchhiking towards Alaska,” Scott Lang said around a mouthful of scalloped potatoes. “Gonna live off the land like what’s his name, you know.”
Tony tossed aside a screwdriver. “Whatever, wanna make out?”
"Oh no," said Pepper. "I know better than to insert myself into this romance. Go, enjoy yourself. I have eyes on another prize this weekend, anyway."
nice.” Okoye wriggled her shoulders against a jet of the deep Jacuzzi that already contained Natasha, Hope Van Dyne, Aunt May, and Shuri. Once she was comfortable, she accepted a pour of the pinot noir that they were passing around.
Tony closed his eyes over the “Asshole, did we not just have this conversation?” from Clint and the “Seriously?” from Sam and the “Nice,” from Bruce.
Scott, Peter, Thor, Bruce and Sam all crowded around her shoulders.
“You’re telling me,” said Tony.
“I think it’s a spider bite,” said Peter Parker. “Guys, can spider bites look really weird?”
Tony looked sideways at Steve. “Are you sassing me right now? Cause I gotta say, it kinda feels like you’re sassing me right now.”
“Duly noted,” Scott Lang said around a grimace. “Ow! Ow! Making it worse!”
“What?”
Clint undid the drawstrings and upturned the sack over his palm. Out slid two blue-black sets of knuckles shaped like honeycomb. Clint hefted them. “They’re kinda… light.”’
“The fuck??”
“Ooh, we’re not—it’s not,” said Scott, hopelessly attempting to draw an “it’s complicated” relationship in the air before being rescued by the descent of yet another aircraft—this time, a Royal Talon Fighter of the Wakandan airforce.
A disgusted chorus rose from the back of the van, and Tony looked over his shoulder: “The
Tony’s grin was undeniably filthy. He leaned forward and murmured into Steve’s ear, “The part where you like being
“I don’t,” Steve protested. “I was a cadet, not a—”
“Yesh! That’s the one!” said Scott, still shoveling in potatoes.
“Friday, belay my last and keep me in the loop about anything juicy, okay?” Tony was saying when Steve came up behind him. “
“I hot-wired it,” Scott Lang added.
Steve didn’t look over at Tony, but his grin grew just a little bit. “Yeah,” he said, looking out over the glowing pools full of drunken Avengers, the sparkling ocean beyond. “That’s so.”
“Uhhh, Steve, I don’t think that’s gonna be necessary,” Bruce said, lifting a folder high. “I found him.”
“They should really get after that,” said Sam. “They’ll get mold.”
“If you don’t talk about it with me, at least talk about it with somebody,” said Sam sagely. “It’s not good to bottle feelings up. It makes white people climb clock towers and start shooting people.”
“Shut up,” said Steve affectionately, rubbing circles over the sensitive spot at the underside of Tony’s cockhead.
“Great, then let’s get moving. Natasha, you’re probably the lightest, would you do the honors?”
“Yup,” said Steve, not looking back. “See you Wednesday.”

“Friend, not ex, who said anything about an ex,” said Tony, glancing in the door at the old guy. “Too old for high school, let’s move on.”
“Stark! Stark, no.”
“Ballet.”
Steve looked at Tony oddly. “Yeah.”
“Rogers.”
May mouthed incredulously, and Shuri nodded. “She works on humanitarian and border issues. Six months out of the year she’s in the field, and the other six she’s working on her doctorate. We hardly ever see her. I had to bribe

“Well, I’ll be damned,” Tony said, pushing the door open. “Nifty gimmick, Lang.”
“He died in a bus of malnutrition,” Bruce pointed out. “And possible wild rice toxicity.”
“Stole a van, technically,” Tony said. “Though I prefer to go with ‘borrowed’.”
“I’d never dream of it,” said Steve.
“Just once,” said Steve, “but it worked.”
“Okay,” said Steve a bit sheepishly, and followed Carol and her towering stack of hair inside the rest stop, where a trucker-style diner had been jammed sideways into a Sbarro’s, with the rest of the space given over to a jarring hodgepoge of arcade games, 18-wheeler parts, pay-by-the-minute showers, and racks of cheap pornography. Carol made a beeline to the pastry case; Steve stood bewildered in front of a refrigerated case of pre-made sandwiches until she came back and grabbed him by the hand.
Natasha cracked her knuckles and nodded at Steve.
“That appeal really should not have worked as well as it does,” complained Bruce Banner, rising and reaching for his milk carton.
“No. No. No! My blood pressure can’t take this shit, Stark, are you trying to make me have a heart attack?”
“Holy shit there’s a THING living in there!”
through me, so I gotta go back in and use the can before this jumpsuit turns brown.”
“That’s not a thing, Barton.”
Tony exploded.
Everyone except Steve looked at the ceiling.
“Was it? Yeah, I guess? I guess it was? Anyway. Uh. I got some… some work I gotta… get back to,” said Tony, sitting down at his desk and tapping his laptop’s keyboard to wake it, shutting Steve out as firmly and smoothly as if he’d closed a door to an office. Steve waited for a second, but Tony’s back was a wall, and so he let himself quietly out of the room. It was only when the door closed behind him that he realized he had no idea where he intended to go. All his homework and his sketchbook were in the room behind him, and the idea of slinking back in to retrieve them was less than appealing. So Steve did what he always did when he felt at loose ends; he went out for a run.
Scott Lang sang out behind him.
“Oh God, now there’s two of you.”
“Third day, huh,” said Steve. “Where did you come from?”
“Well, lookit that,” said Clint conversationally, picking the remains of a half-chewed inchworm grub out of the mashed berry sprayed over his shirt. “You got the prize.”
“My room is Tony Stark’s weapons lab,” Steve said into his arms.
exes? How does that happen?”
“It’s all right,” said Steve. “Just because it’s grim doesn’t make it wrong. Now, how do we get in?”
“Who, Barton? Who knows. Shoelaces, banana peels, I tripped over a nun. I just patch ‘em up, man, I don’t ask questions,” Sitwell said lightly. “Time for you to go back to class, anyway.”
“Is that it? I thought Belorussian. Russian, Belorussian, potato, potahto, right? Anyway, you hear about her?”
Steve blushed. “You looked.”
“Thank you,” said Scott, sounding genuinely touched. “Hey, Tony, does Thor have any allergies, like to bees or something? Could he have gotten bitten by the same thing Peter did and like collapsed of anyphalactic shock?”
,” Shuri said. “And heat and cooling settings too. I’ve never encountered that outside of Wakanda.” Okoye shot her a stifling glance, but as she was nose-deep in bubbles with a wineglass in her hand, the censorious effect was somewhat lost.
“Oh, no,” said Steve. “That wasn’t it, see, he set off the fire alarm, and he had this deal with Hill that if he did that he’d have to pick a sport.”
“It’s military? Cool!”
Tony managed to close his mouth—barely—as Aunt May padded in from the bathroom, wrapped in a white towel and wearing an identical grin to Pepper’s. He blinked. Opened his mouth. Closed it again. “Well, I’ll be damned,” he finally said. “Good vacation.”
“What is hickey?” Natasha said, and everyone noted how Bruce turned bright red as he answered.
“To the thigh bone,” Lang said, rolling back out from under the van. “All done,” he informed Tony, tossing him the screwdriver. “You can tell me I’m fucking sexy any time now.”
“A van full of unsupervised teenagers, I don’t see why not,” said Tony. “What is it, three in the morning.”
“Come on, it’s all over school. You were like in Navy SEAL school or something—”
Thor shook his head. “No. It ceased when I left the well.” He looked around the van at the others. “I owe you all a debt for retreiving me. While it was beautiful to dream of such things, I do not think such visions are healthy.”
“Dude, is that a

spectacular. Have you given any thought to how you want to approach him?"
“So, is this like a private island?” Scott asked.
“Charming,” said Sitwell. “Useless,” he said, pointing to Steve. “Go on, get your boyfriend out of here and see if you can keep him out for at least another month.”

“Even the subtlest ones, any evident would help us.” Rhodey pushes the argument.
Peter’s hand?” Scott sounds offended.
“Hey, I take offense to that!” Tony frowns at Quill’s statement. He remembers that bittersweet memories of them discussing a plan to stop Thanos once and for all. They created a mess.
” Sam grits his teeth tightly.
?” Tony purrs at Steve as he gives him a wink, dragging Bruce with him who only deadpanned at the situation.
In the back of the room, the Co – Director stood tensely, scanning the situation in front of him seriously. He was so focus on the Play that he did not notice a cold bottle of water that was pressed against his cheek.
, what the heck did we just hear?” Scott mutters in dazed, still not believing what he just heard.
, just this time.” Peter whispers in desperation. He didn’t know why, but he needs to do his best. And so is Flash.
, that little squirt is actu—” Sam cursed in shocked but was cut off by Steve.
“It’s no problem, really. Besides, Mr. Stark was the one who specifically reserved all the seats in the Theater—therefore making all of you our only guests for tonight. Mr. Stark also got all of you the Golden ticket for the play. Which means all your needs will be prioritize as you all are our only VIP guests.” Ned continues to explain. The same way Tony's smile continues to widen. The Avengers gaped in silence.
!” Peter squeaked as he blushed.
! We’re running out of time here!” Peter can only sweat dropped as he witnesses their Co – Director in distress while the Director himself was calm and collected when he enters the stage for a re – check. Unlike him, the Director gave all of the participant a reassuring smile and informs them calmly.
He sang in a pained and hurt expression so real–like that the Avengers jerks and twitches in response, not liking his damaged expression.
“That

smart but
“Yeah, does he not tell what he’s called at school? Heh, figures.” MJ smirks in satisfaction. Peter was sure shy and embarrassed as hell when he mentions him being the baby of the family. So, it’s only natural that he would absolutely hide those adorable and sweet nicknames from the Avengers.
“Yeah we promise that we won’t, but first you got to tell us about Lil’ Pete’s secret crush!” Rocket screams in defense, glaring at Ned.
He took another step backwards, still eyeing Flash who’s currently shivering in reflex. The drums are in sync with his lines as the beats was played along with the song.
Silence fills the air in the VIP spot. The guys of the team seem confused. But the girls? They kept their silent façade until Gamora screams in outrage.
—fretting over a teen’s secret crush. I mean, it’s a once in a lifetime chance, who can pass
“I can’t help being nervous at tonight’s play. What will happen if I messed up the act and song?” Peter asks worriedly. The duo sigh at Peter’s antics.
He glances to the letters.
“I’ll make sure that he won’t even have a mouth to talk his way with you.” Bucky threatens sharply.
“What do you mean, Tony?” Steve asks carefully.
“Who is this ‘

“Does he mean the person behind him, brother?” Thor questions.
“Agreed. By the looks of it you seemed particularly in a delightful mood.” Stephen nods his head in agreement.

“Of course you are, since I’m going to tell you right now. We need to put up the fake crowds’ hologram and sound manipulator in every corner of the stage—which was done by the crew. And, all we got to do now is check everything and confirm the set up. You follow?” Tony explains as they all walk in a fast pace. Bruce was about to respond when Ned suddenly spoke.
did Peter still have those letters from that
“So, young one, where exactly are you taking us? Son of Stark had only given us little information.” Thor questioned curiously. Ned had to hold himself back from fan boy – ing when the Norse God asks him personally. He had to be professional in front of Peter’s family after all. Even if they’re the Avengers.
He throws those half – burn letters to Flash’s direction as his tears falls from his cheeks beautifully.
Tony chuckled. “No, but it makes sense.”
“Thor!”
Clint’s grin disclosed a mouthful of blood. “Fell into a coffee table.”
“Yeah, but where would the fun be in that?” Tony asked, to general approbation, just as the nut gave way with a sharp crack. “Awesome, let’s get that spare on there and get moving.”
“Good,” Pepper said muzzily, blinking from behind a haze of frazzled hair. “What time is it?”
Steve swallowed, mouth suddenly dry. “Uh, what are we talking about, exactly?”
“Thor, buddy, where are you?”
“Story of my life,” said Tony. “So, this is all very disarming, but where’s the part where you convince me that I shouldn’t track him down?”
“Jesus, he’s soaked,” said Peter. “How cold was that water, buddy?”
before he got a faceful of sweatshirt.
Steve walked through the small crowd of rousted-out, grumpy-looking SHIELD Academy students to where Tony stood with Maria Hill, who was brandishing a clipboard. A group of girls with wet hair and facial masks gave Steve dirty looks as he passed, as if he—just by being Tony Stark’s roommate—had been responsible for the fire evacuation. “Yeah?”
“Who’s Rhodey,” Steve started to say, before giving up. “Nevermind. No, Stark’s tasers do not make you piss yourself. They make you pass out.”
“I can’t take you seriously when you’re wearing that thing on your head,” Tony complained.
“What is fuckup?”
“I’m told I’m a good listener.”
“I suppose not,” the boy readily agreed, and they continued ambling at a more leisurely pace, heading through the laundry room into a corridor marked with mid-century radiation shelter placards.
“Come on. ‘Fess up. What has a handsome young fella like yourself so terminally freaked that he’s on a Greyhound in the middle of the night with nought but a homemade taser? They didn’t try to send you to one of those gay deprogram camps, did they?”
“I failed pretty much completely to stop them from doing it,” Sam said.
“Yeah, well, they can also kidnap you and feed you to the hill people,” said Tony, peering out the windshield with an expression of deep misgiving. “Let’s make this a short pit stop, shall we?”
“Yeah, well,” Tony said, standing up and quickly gathering the scattered trash from their lunch. “Don’t go spreading it around, I kind of enjoy my, genius playboy billionaire philanthropist reputation.”
You didn’t tell you me had a
“Really? What brought you here?”
“Yeah, how’s that?” said Steve.
“Maybe,” Tony said, giving him an unreadable look, and Steve flushed even though he was pretty sure he hadn’t actually said anything dirty. “Come on, if we head down the east stairs during freshman curfew they won’t even notice we’re gone.”
Tony’s eyes darkened. “You really shouldn’t have said that.” Then he grabbed Steve by the hips, sat up, and with one swift motion flipped Steve over and pressed him into the mattress. His hands came up to grip Steve’s, fitting them to the supports of the bunk bed as his lips brushed Steve’s ear. “Hold on tight.” The cool air of the room rushed in to chill Steve’s back as Tony hopped off the bed to root around in a drawer—Steve heard an unfurling strip of condoms, then the noisy crack of the lube bottle’s cap. Tony came back into the bed, and the warmth of his body as he leaned back over Steve, working him open with two fingers and a thumb, was like a benediction. “Now, I wanna see you hanging on tight there. Don’t let me see you let go of those slats.”
“Yes?” the nurse said tetchily, by now tweezer-deep in Bruce’s arm.
Sam shook his head very slowly at Tony. Across the room, Steve was shaking his head at Tony in exactly the same way, at identical speed. It was disconcerting.
“Yeah, from dumb and dumber—Rogers! Come over here!”
“Actually, he is,” came a voice from behind them, and the whole group swiveled to goggle at Coulson, wearing shorts and a charcoal-grey hoodie and holding a largish duffle. “Is this where we’re assembling?”
“….I brought a taser,” he said.
“Jesus, can we can it with the doomsaying?” said Tony. “Thor, buddy, how many fingers am I holding up?”
“Too bad,” said Mr. Coulson, and smacked Clint gently on the shoulder. “Come on. Dinner. They’re gonna eat up all the chicken stirfry, leave us with the tofu.”
“What do you mean, Bruce? Is… is it something bad?” Steve asks carefully, wincing at how stunned he looks.
Peter hugs himself as he lowers his head in distress, frustration fills him all the way up.
“Guess he’s been learning from the best, huh.” Clint chuckles.
“If he actually said what I
stupid at the same time, you know that?” He deadpanned at his reasoning. The Director gives a nod.
“Indeed. But, there is a saying about geniuses being ignorant towards their own well–being.” Loki answers him in interest.
“We arrived at the right time, right? Didn’t you say the play starts at nine? It’s already eight thirty.” Scott looks at his watch and around the area.
The atmosphere was suffocating and deadly. The guys, finally understood what Peter meant earlier was in the verge of causing a havoc. The girls, already knowing the incident—the Play decides to go ahead and make more chaos to their feelings.
“I see… I’m glad that you’re only looking after our juniors. But besides that, you should take a break. I’m more worried about you then our talented juniors, you know?” He pats the Co – Director’s back softly, smiling cheekily at his tired best friend.
The guys looked at one another in confusion, some trying to held their respective girl teammates from attacking the ‘
Apologies for the abrupt ending.
. How did that happen?” He phrases in a strained voice.
“Don’t worry, the hologram and sound manipulator are easy to set up. If needed, Brucie here will help me with it.” He informed calmly, as he also gave Bruce a wink in which he returns confusedly.

“I have to agree. However, I’m also glad that Peter decides to burn those letters.” T'Challa said with a grateful look.
“You and I
, he actually had the nerves! It’s not just bad—it’s a completely and utterly horrendous thing to happen to Peter!” Scott frowns in displeased, being the second to understand his sentence.
“Yeah, even his plans suck.” Quill mutters, loud enough for Tony to hear.
“Alright, we’re here. Mr. Stark and Mr. Banner please take your seats immediately—the play will start very soon.” Ned explains quickly, remembering the limited amount of time they had left. And, he and MJ had to check on Peter too. They don’t get paid enough for all the trouble they had to deal with.
“Indeed, shall we also cut his tongue? A

them quickly, eager to burn them. His face looked a bit cynical. He knows how sweet and daring he was towards her in these letters. And, he also knows how betrayed she felt when she found out about his affairs while re – reading his letters. Peter is eager and desperate to act her role in his current era.
“Yes sir. It’s no problem at all. But, this means that Mr. Stark has to put up the hologram around the stage faster since our time is running out.” Ned glance back to Tony who only wink in assurance.
“Yeah, I’m done for today. But I do hope Flash won’t mess up the play for tonight. I mean, I know all he gotta do is standing there looking guilty and scared during the act, but what if he trips? That would surely ruin the play!” Peter rants in annoyance, irritated at Flash’s act today of skipping practice. Ned seemed to be overwhelmed by his continuous ranting.

“And that would be the dad of this vacation,” Tony said. “Sorry.”
“None,” said the boy. “This is only my third day.”
"I want him to be that, too," said Tony. "Have you seen that ass?"
“Hey, Scott, can you actually crawl through buildings in the ceiling tiles?” asked Peter.
“Here,” said Tony quickly, handing the attendant a twenty. “Please don’t tell anyone we came through.”
Natasha made an annoyed noise. “Stop being a child and look at the bright light!”
“You alright, man?” Sam said, straightening up as his teammates cheered. “Normally I wouldn’t even get close to that.”

“Ugh, he just frustrates me. Why was he chosen to be my partner again? We’re even playing the role of a couple—and neither of us is playing the girl part!” Peter sighed in exhaustion. Ned stood there in silence, letting Peter blow his steam out.

, drowning each other with so much delight. Peter’s glare is locked on Flash as his expression turns furious. The same can be said about the Avengers.
?” Loki asks suspiciously, arching an eyebrow at said smirking Tony.
The others did not argue as they too, enters the building. Halfway to the center of the Theater, Thor speaks up.
! Move all of you!” The Co – Director shouts out loud, running across the back stage in a hurry. His eyes narrowed drastically at the participant in the room as he claps his hands loudly.
“Who cares, whoever it is we’ll be interrogating him when this Play is over.” Clint grits his teeth, an annoyed smirk formed on his lips. In which Natasha, Bucky, and Gamora nodded too eagerly.
“Indeed, I’m rather curious about this person young Peter is interested with.” Loki narrows his eyes slightly.
“Yeah, everything is under control—except maybe for your mental condition, Peter.” MJ replies calmly, smirking when her sight lands on Peter.
“I’m not so sure about that, remember when you prank Quill with Clint?” Steve counters his protest while cooking pancakes for everyone along with Mantis and Loki. He needed their help preparing for 20+ breakfast after all.
, is a ticket to entertainment.” He replies coolly. The others looked at him with a confused faces.
“Don’t worry about Sam being an asshole to Peter—that’s just his dark and twisted way of showing his affection and love for Peter.” Bucky reasons, sensing the tension that risen at the mention of Sam bullying Peter; the girls in the room dotes on Peter a lot and cares for him so much that they tend to be overprotective. The same can be said about the guys in the room.
“Good. Now, why don’t you suck it a little more?” Tony canted his hips forward, an invitation, and Steve moaned as he took in more of Tony’s cock, the shaft so much thicker than his own, the head leaking precome as tangy and sharp as licking a leather saddle. It was awkward, sucking cock with his arms pinned above his head—without his hands to control the depth of the invasion, Tony’s cock routinely probed his soft palate, bumping up against the back of his throat and making Steve gag, his eyes water. After a particularly deep thrust, Tony pulled back and let Steve catch his breath, a thin dewline of spit connecting his cock to Steve’s upper lip.
Steve looked sheepish. “I guess my sense for these things is still kinda stuck in the 30’s.”
“Let’s have a look at that, shall we?” he said mildly, and turned the boy’s arm over. Deep in the scrape, tiny bits of the shattered blue glass still sparkled. Steve watched the boy’s eyes. They never left his teacher’s face.
Coulson popped open a beer.
At that moment, one of the boy’s wild, blind punches connected—with the security guard’s ear. Even Steve flinched at the hollow thud.
“Summerslam.”
Later that night, as the SHIELD students huddled close in the van around an upturned flashlight, Thor told them about his accident.
"You're growing up," Pepper said, reemerging from the closet and coming to take the glass from Tony's hand and to smooth his hair behind his ear. "And you like Steve. You don't want him to be just a conquest."
“I wish it would stop,” said Steve.
“There is map,” said Natasha. “Everyone now shut up, please.”
“Nietzschean! I like it!” said Scott, panting right behind Clint. “Hey guys, what are the odds there’s gonna be like a big drinks machine on the top of this building?
Clint shrugged. “I hear he made a security guard at his last school lose bladder control.”
“Yeah, Tony? What kind of guy do I seem like?” said Steve, and just as Tony was about to open his mouth to say—well, he didn’t know what he was going to say—a sharp crunching sound came from the lock Lang was working on. The door swung open.
. And Tony did taste good—he might’ve smelled like solder and grease, but he tasted like coffee and clove, dark and rich and sweet, like the kind of spice that people used to carry back from India. And before Steve could say something like,
“I believe you,” said Steve, slowly turning to take in the whitewashed curves and vaulted ceiling of the foyer. “This place is beautiful, Tony.”
“Dude. Dude look. Tell me this doesn’t look like a hickey to you.”
“Ooh, she’s gorgeous,” May whispered, sneaking a peek as she swapped out the empty bottle for a fresh one.
“Yes.”
Clint mouthed at him, and Parker sat back in his chair, mouthing a wide
“—and he reports nothing to be seen in any direction,” finished Thor. “We are as alone as if we were in the Well of Wyrd, near my father’s summer home in Nor—”
“Need any help?” he offered.
Tony blinked. Chewed. Blinked again. “Son of a bitch.” He finished chewing, reached into the bramble, pulled out another fistful of berries and jammed them in his mouth.
“On second thought, I think it was just a regular spider,” said Peter.
“Scott Lang?”
“I’ll let her know,” said Clint. “Thanks, man.”
“Honey, I live my life in public,” Tony told him, and then they were making out again, and someone walked by in the hallway and said, “Gross, get a room,” and Tony laughed his ass off as he closed the door.
school.”
Tony wobbled his hand, unconvinced. “I dunno, I still don’t think a taser’s what you’re looking for. Here, have her try these on for size.” He went to a drawer, pulled out a small black velvet pouch, and tossed it to Clint, who wrinkled his nose.
“You’re a sneaky little shit, you know that, Rogers?”
Steve looked to Bruce for help.
“You heard me. NOW,” said Steve. “Untie me, get this shit off of me, MOVE.”
“Hey, any of you kids know who got sent home on America’s Next Top Model last night?” the attendant asked, yanking on the tire jack to loosen the lug nuts. “We had a thunderstorm in the middle of it and lost DishNetwork completely.”
“Better,” Steve said. “But we should still pack it and tape it.”
They all watched Thor struggling with the last frozen nut on the tire.
Tony chuckled a little, his body coming to rest on Steve’s back as his forearms braced himself on either side of Steve’s head, the weight as delicious as the warmth. “Hold on tight, Daddy’s gotcha.”
The splash, when it came, almost spattered into the deep Japanese soaking tub in which Bruce, Rhodey, Coulson, and Sam were luxuriating. Almost.
“Ahh, you’re tiptoeing,” said Tony, his eyes closed, his head tilted back against the gently swaying side of the van. “You need to strut, big guy. You might enjoy it.”
are,” Sitwell informed him, then returned his sharp gaze to Tony’s grin. “What’s gonna happen is you’re gonna die and my Domo ass is gonna go to jail for fuckin’ failure to keep you from doing it.”
“Tomato, tomahto,” he said. “I don’t know about all of you, but I’ve had enough nature for one night. What say we all turn in, get some rack time?”
“Mister Rogers,” Mr. Coulson said from the front of the room, and Steve came back to himself.
Three days later, the note arrived.
“In Norway—”
“His first love,” Shuri informed her.
“What, Bucky?”
“You hear about that new Natasha chick?” Stark said to Steve that afternoon in their room.
“He what?”
Natasha? As in, Romanov?” Tony mouthed a ‘wow’ at Steve. “I mean, what are the odds, we were just discussing her and her terrifying Commie athletic training. Couldn’t she just kick someone to death if they pissed her off?”
. Steve had never realized how intense a hookup could get while still remaining, technically, a hookup: Tony and he didn’t hold hands down the hallways, or send each other lots of texts, or do anything particularly romantic at all, and yet every time he stepped in the room at the end of the day Tony would come at him with that
“Will you all,” said Natasha, panting, “Please, shut up.”
“Hey,” said Steve. “I’m awake.”
“What
“You can’t look and pee at the same time? Aren’t you supposed to be like, excellent at staring at shit? Here, use a YooHoo bottle.”
“Apparently she’s like an actual no-shit Communist and went to like some hardcore ballet academy. You know, like where they start them out at seven and work them dawn to midnight. Like, Olympic-level shit, tiny little ectomorphic gymnasts with no periods, in Soviet Russia, pas de deux does
“Here,” said Steve, and Mr. Coulson smiled over his glasses at him. Steve didn’t think he was very special, at least not in a school with Tony Stark in it, but in Mr. Coulson’s room he got treated… differently. Not in a bad way. Just in a way that made him forget being “that weird military kid.” “That coma kid.” “That kid whose friend is
Tony shrugged. “I’m amazing at lots of things. Speaking of which…” He stopped, looked around, then grabbed Steve by the shirt and tugged him into an empty custodial closet, backing up until he was sitting on the rim of the tiny, rusting sink. “C’mon, close the door.”
By mile eight, Tony was ready to murder them all.
Then, of course, Tony went and turned out to be a goddamned Ultimate Frisbee
“I still need to see him. Uh. My friend,” Steve volunteered carefully.
“Yeah, I guess? Except it’s really complicated, because he’s not gonna know I’m there.”
“Oh, that’s okay,” said Pepper. “I got it.”
“No.”
“All right, all right,” said Tony, ignoring Bruce’s quiet moan of distress. “Do what you gotta do, just hurry up, wouldja?”
“Thought you might enjoy the view,” Tony said.
“Ah,” said Sam. “You want me as bait.”
“You taste good,” Tony broke off the kiss to inform him, “Like… America.” Then went right back to kissing Steve before he could say anything like,
“Look at that muscle tone,” said Clint. “He has some, still. None of these other people do. He must have started out with a lot of it.”
“No,” said Natasha.
“Ahh, see, that would be the kind of prediction I actively try to avoid making,” said Bruce. “Never worked out too well for me.”
"And, in answer to your question, I don't know what's changed," said Tony. "I didn't used to take this long to make up my mind about someone. I used to know by the time they had my pants unzipped. So like, fifteen minutes? I'm slowing."
“I don’t know how I ever thought you had a language barrier,” Steve told her.
“Is it true?”
“This tire has not been well maintained,” said Thor, straining against the next nut. “Truly, if we were in Norway—”
“I don’t know,” said Bruce, “But the concussion would probably accelerate any brain damage.”
Steve slowed down as the penny dropped. “No.”
floor”. He pushed on it. Locked. Next to the hinge, a card reader showed one glowing red LED.Clattering down the stairs behind him, Scott and Clint jostled him to peer at it.
“Is it true that Stark’s tasers actually makes you piss yourself?”
“Thank Christ,” said Barton. “I was not looking forward to going back through those woods.”
“Wait, is he even gonna be
“Only a problem if you don’t hear me out,” said Sam evenly.
“You guys got anything over there?”
The music coming from the dance studio got louder as he approached the door, loud enough to muffle the heavy fire door as he pressed it open. Inside, Natasha Romanov stood at the barre, one leg describing half-moon circles on the floor, hair up in a severe bun and posture so elongated she gave the impression of trying to see over a very high ledge. Her eyes caught his in the mirror and her extended foot snapped back into fifth position.
said Tony, at the same time that Steve said, “Be quiet, Buck.” When violence did not immediately break out, Steve turned and began steering Bucky down the corridor towards the fire exit.
“You know where I come from?”
“THIS IS WHAT WE’RE DOING,” said Tony.
“Nothing, on the house,” said Tony. “Just ask her to tell me how they work out for her? Or, she can write a note, whatever. Pigeons. Just. Feedback. My inventions would never get better without it.”
“Knock yourself out, I guess. What’s it gonna do, make me more handsome?”
“Soooo, you gonna convince me, or what?” Tony said several minutes later, regarding Sam over a mound of heavily jalapeno’d nachos. Behind them, at another of the bright red picnic tables, Thor was entertaining Natasha by chugging a bright blue Slurpee at speed, while Bruce was soothing his sorrows with a mound of cheese-soaked fries.
“And Tony got stabbed in the
,” said Tony, a hint of incredulity creeping into his voice. “You knew, and you didn’t fucking tell me.”
“Fuck Steve Jobs right in the asshole,” said Tony.
“Whatever, Captain, we’ll explore that later when I’m totally not gonna call you that in bed. Meanwhile, Barton, shall I assume you need my weapons expertise? What is it this time? Knives? Throwing stars? More of those weird exploding arrowheads I made you promise never to tell me how they worked out? How
“Bucky Barnes,” he said tonelessly.
“Shteve,” said Tony, and spat out a glob of toothpaste. “Uh. Surprise?”
The group applauded.
“You’re sure he’s not hypothermic?” Sam muttered to Bruce.
“I don’t know yet, that’s why you should only do it to people who really piss you off.”
“Huh, that’s weird,” said Mr. Coulson. “We’re supposed to have a new student named,” and here he peered at the attendance folder. “Natasha Romanoff. From Russia. Barton, go out and see if you can find Miss Romanoff? She’s probably lost on her first day.”
true?” Steve asked, bracing himself. He hadn’t
“Are teenagers not trusted to travel in America?” Thor asked. “In Norway, many youths have apprentice jobs that they drive to in the evenings—”
Limping back to campus took a while. By the time he got back, it was past curfew and the security lights were on. Maria Hill, crossing the courtyard from the swimming pool, looked surprised to see him.
“Not at all. What’d you expect, a rubber band snap?”
semester, Stark. No less. That was our deal.”
“Yeah, you’re lucky you didn’t drown,” said Bruce. “We were all the way back to the van before we realized you weren’t there.”
“It’s not really a SHIELD problem.”
“That’s
“Whom I have never
“Uhh, are you talking to me?”
“You know it,” said Tony, watching Pepper go and lower herself into the same tub. “Explain this to me, Strange. How come all the pretty women are over there and it’s a total sausage fest over here? Are we not geniuses? Is Clint rubbing off on us?”
“Actually, this all seems kinda familiar,” said Steve, as outside, beyond the muffling carpets and brick, a chanting unit of cadets jogged past, the faint “Fweet” of a whistle signaling their commander’s presence.
“I saw truth,” said Thor. “And it was a rainbow, composed of many colors.”
“Oh no? Is the noise of my Ultimate Frisbee domination just too loud?” Tony said, shooting a three-pointer into a nearby trashcan with the wadded-up lunch trash.
“Yeah well, it wasn’t your choice,” said Tony lightly. “I followed you. They’re following me. Ergo, not your responsibility. No muss, no fuss. Hey, someone save me a seat!” He climbed into the van, leaving Steve to wonder why he still felt guilty.
“Eh,” said Sam. “I think everyone felt sorry for him.”
Steve blinked. “OK.”
“Jesus, you’re going to give yourself a hernia,” said Tony. “Let Thor take a whack at it, man.”
“Ehh, close enough.”
me into submission?”
“Pardon?”
“Tony?” Steve was saying, and Tony looked down and Steve was sitting on the edge of the bed, hands on Tony’s hips, looking up at him, and
“…of the heavily guarded and vaguely paramilitary school full of heavily armed Republican teenagers?” said Bruce Banner.
“Oh yeah, tough guy? What is it, then?”
Steve found his feet and moved. When he returned with two Dixie cups of icy cold water and a roll of brown paper towels, the injured boy was sitting up, looking embarrassed. “Thanks,” he said quietly as Steve handed him the water.
“Worth it,” Tony said hungrily, and yanked Steve’s fly open.
“О, ради Бога,” muttered Natasha, stepping between the two boys and lifting the map out of their hands. Climbing to the front of the van, she squatted between driver’s and passenger’s seat and spread the map out, pointing to a spot a bit before the Junior Military Reserve Academy. “There. This is place we go into the school.”
“Weird,” said Sam. “How far away is it?”
“Looks like Cap’s got that covered,” said Barton, and Tony shot a sly look over his shoulder at Steve.
“What, in New Haven? Yeah, I’m sure the Yalies will take
, Tony. You can’t
“Ugh,” said Barton, but obediently tilted his head back so Steve could finish the job. By the time he was finished, Barton seemed to have forgotten about his earlier line of questioning. “Hey, thanks. Sitwell, am I good to go?”
,” corrected Peter Parker. “What? He was!”
Steve winced at the phrasing—thankfully, Tony was listening to Bruce’s muttered counsel, and didn’t seem to hear. Hoisting Bucky to his feet, Steve looked at the group. “Listen, you can leave and go back to SHIELD without me. But I’m taking him out of here. This isn’t the right place for him.”
“Jesus, you are awful at this moral support gig, you know that?” said Tony.
“Uh, Tony, gonna need more’n a YooHoo bottle—yep, yep, there’s gonna be some overflow here. Little help, little help?”
Tony, looking utterly relaxed about his blowjob’s interruption, gave a tiny shrug from where he lay, one arm tucked behind his head. His other hand, draped loosely over his chest, lightly guarded his pacemaker’s scar—Steve guessed Tony wasn’t even aware he did that. “They never vacation, so. Is a vacation home a vacation home if you never use it? Anyway. It’s ours, and it’s private, so we could be naked all the time if we wanted.” His fingers fluttered, drummed on his chest, a tiny signal of some interior stress, coming out.
“Which is why they always have the security guard wandering around the courtyard and a camera on the pool,” Tony continued. “It’s bad liability, an unlit pool at night in a school with a lot of horny teenagers. They should really scrap it but it looks nice in the brochures.”
.” Sitwell’s tone was half amused and half-terrified, like he thought if he couldn’t talk Tony out of his newest obsession, that Tony might try it on himself. He aimed a beseeching look at Steve.
the realization,” said Clint.
“It’s okay if it does,” Steve said, and something in Tony’s chest loosened, not a heart thing exactly, but heart-adjacent. “Come here and lie down next to me. We don’t have to do anything.”
“I could try,” Scott said as the gangplank opened, and then, as Shuri, Okoye, Nakia, and finally T’Challa appeared and descended the plank, “Nevermind.”
Tony didn’t. “How’s she gonna keep from tasering herself if she wakes up disoriented?”
Letting himself back into the room that night, Steve decided not to let words get in the way of what he had to say. He crossed the room swiftly, not bothering to close the door behind him, and met Tony’s opening mouth with a kiss that stole all Tony’s speech. When he finally pulled back for air, Tony’s eyes were dark, his lips swollen.
“How do you know?” asked Bruce.
transporting
Natasha pointed upwards. “Look.”
“You’re right,” said Tony, like Fury was suddenly an afterthought, an annoyance. “You’re completely ancillary, I don’t even know why I thought you needed to be in on this. Good talk.” He swept off towards the tray return, leaving Fury looking murderous in the center of the cafeteria, where everyone was doing a very poor job of concealing their interest in the confrontation. Fury glared at them all in general for a moment before stalking off, the cafeteria filling with a dull roar of speculation in his wake.
“Oh, are you
“Shut up, Clint,” Steve grumbled, trying to conceal his smile. It was nice, having friends. And right on cue, there came the rush of guilt—like he’d somehow betrayed Bucky in some complex way by making friends here at SHIELD. Like he should’ve stayed there, where Bucky was. Like he never should’ve woken up, or should still be waiting there for Buck to do the same. Steve would’ve, is the thing—he wanted to stay. But there’s only so long you can spend out of school before you have to be enrolled
“Have care how you speak about Steven’s friend,” came a voice from the end of the table. Thor had apparently pulled himself away from the tiny brunette he’d been nuzzling and joined the conversation. “Tony Stark’s mind may be far afield, but his heart is obviously cleaved to Rogers.”
“What were you doing in the woods?” said Steve.
“This is a thirty, Tony.”
“Who was that who made goal on you twice last week?” said Tony. “Oh, that’s right, still me.”
“Shoot me.”
“You got it,” said Clint, already on his way out the door.
“Wow,” said Tony. “That is a school attendance office.”
The door swung shut, and Tony scrubbed the back of his neck a bit.
“Everyone, we’re going to Norway after this,” Scott Lang hollered. “It sounds nice! I like IKEA. Loganberries are good.”
“Tony—”
get to go on double dates.”
“Yes. I read your file. I was in the room when we admitted you, in fact,” said Mr. Coulson.
As he walked off, he heard Tony’s voice behind him. “Wait, are you on the team too?”
Natasha pointed. “Look.”
Steve snorted. “Where’d you pick that up?”
“I’m curious,” said Peter.
A few moments later, Clint spoke: “I want it on record that we’ve now been through this forest three times.
“Yeah well,” Bruce said quietly. “You might not.”
“First moment of peace in eighty miles,
,” said Carol, hoisting her red plastic handbag a little higher on her shoulder and patting Steve on the hand in a motherly fashion. “On your feet, soldier.”
“Just here for some ice,” said Steve.
“Twenty percent of the fuel costs, was that not common knowledge?” Tony asked, and when Scott turned pale, added, “Kidding, kidding. Jesus. It’s on me. Thanks for coming. Didn’t bring the squirt with you?”
"I would never," said Tony. "You know I only want success for my best girl, right?"
“A pacemaker?” Steve repeated dumbly, and Tony’s mouth torqued around wryly.
“See, that’s what I thought,” Tony said, quietly. “There’s a part of you that matches up to a part of me. And I’m pretty sure you’ve never actually explored that part. Am I right?”
at him, Lang pulled a face, and the grimacing rapidly escalated into a full scale slap-fight.
“Yes.”
, his blood type?” Bruce said.
“Mister Stark,” interrupted Headmaster Fury, looking about as aggravated as Fury ever got, “I don’t care if Cadet Rogers has gone to the
They were standing in a long hallway, the only light coming from a window at the other end of the building. To each side, identical doors in rows, each with a small, dimly lit, greenish window. Tony looked in the first one. Empty. Ditto, the next. In the eerie hallway, the air seemed fetid and stale. Steve, unhelpfully, had stopped making crashing noises the second they got into the hallway, so there was no telling where he was in the building. Tony peeked in the next window. Nothing.
“What am I, made of money?” said Tony, and held up a hand. “No—don’t answer that. The answer is no, I didn’t bring any of that stuff. Who else has an idea?”
“Subtle,” said Tony. “We
?” said Sitwell, and Barton shrugged.
Tony leaned in. “I didn’t hear that.”
“Uh,” said Steve sheepishly. “I kinda threw my phone in a river.”
“Nice,” commented the attendant from behind all of them. “Your tire’s done.”
Steve’s breath caught in his throat, audibly, giving the game away as Tony, triumphant, unfurled over him, slotting their dicks against each other. “See, the thing is, Captain Rogers—”
“I haven’t—“ Steve started, and Tony lay a finger across his lips.
Tony leaned in further. “I said, I
“Ooo, I want a Slurpee,” said Barton as they piled out of the van.
“Oh boy,” said Tony. “Who gave Thor the good drugs and stop holding out on the group, please.”
“I say this with all due love and respect, Tony” said Scott Lang, who was bent over and breathing hard, “but your boyfriend is a pain in the ass.”
“LET GO, Tony!”
“Not a soul, Tony Stark,” said Thor from the door of the maintenance garage, where he was keeping a watch. “Barton is on the roof—”
the StarkPhone, this should not be happening.
“Are we worried they’ll notice?” Steve said, but Tony was already at the end of the hallway.
“I wish I could,” said Steve. “He’s in a… sort of a coma? Uh. He was in a car accident.”
“So here’s what we’re doing,” Carol informed Steve as she dug her rhinestone-encrusted cell phone out of her bag. “I am going to give you my phone number, and in exchange, you are going to give me yours. And if I don’t hear from you in another three days, I will assume that you have fallen down a well and need some help, OK?”
“Yeah, what’s his problem?’
“Fat lot of moderating influence
“Heeeyy,” said Steve slowly, stepping inside the nurse’s office. “What happened?”
“There he is,” said Natasha. Everyone turned to look. Steve, silhouetted in the light of the large windows at the end of the hall, was limping towards them. And he wasn’t alone. Clinging to Steve’s shoulder, half-stumbling and half dragging, was a gaunt boy with a ragged mop of hair concealing half his face and an even inkier set of circles under his eyes. “Everyone, meet Bucky Barnes.”
, you just have to wait for the police to come arrest us all—”
“No no no, I’m just kidding,” Tony said, clambering to his feet and grabbing his hoodie. “Yes. Fun, let’s do it.”
That settled, they continued wandering in companionable silence, into a hallway lined with photography darkrooms. Steve stopped to look in at the finished pictures hanging up in the framing room; apparently, the photography students were working on still-lifes. Lots of close-ups of feathers and leaves. Bruce stopped too. “You like art?”
“Seriously? You had a half an hour to screw around on the roof while Lang was under the van.”
“What, Thor, no, we aren’t gonna find shawarma this late a…” Tony said, climbing out of the car and looking up at the sign for the pizza place. The sign read “Moore’s House Of Pizza And Shawarma.”
Steve figured that was as good an answer as he was going to get.
“You look so pretty when you beg,” murmured Tony, dropping his mouth to Steve’s ear. “Did you beg for him?”
“A vacation,” Bruce repeated.
“What is batting eye-”
“How does someone so big just disappear?” complained Scott Lang, inspecting the tree branches above himself with his iPhone’s light.
"You're very wise," said Tony, and Pepper smiled into her drink. "So, what's your verdict. Do you want in on this ride?"
“What, this?” Clint said, and gave a long, obnoxious stretch, pulling the shirt up another three inches and stroking his stomach lewdly. “I’m also the god of not shrinking my laundry.”
“Service entrance, right over there,” said Scott Lang. “Did anyone think to bring a variety of carpet cleaner’s uniforms, maybe some equipment and ID badges?”
“And you need to focus!” said Steve, sitting up on both elbows. “What are you
“She’s bluffing,” said Tony, but his voice cracked, and he darted around Steve to the hallway, where he scooped up his tr—components—in a scattered armful, dropping a lot of it as he shoveled it back into the very small dorm room that Steve was (allegedly) supposed to be moving into. It didn’t look like there would be enough room for Steve. Every horizontal surface was covered with… stuff. Steve wasn’t exactly sure what to call it. Lots of it had wires, and some of it was humming, but nothing was a recognizable
“I wish I’d brought my plasma cutter,” Tony said fifteen minutes later, as the group huddled around a locked door in the administrative office. Scott Lang, ear pressed to the lock assembly, was gently jiggling two long metal shims in the lock. “Are you sure you can’t just jolt it open?”
“Yes,” said Natasha.
“I guess?”
Steve winced. “Yeah. Uh. I dream a lot about before the accident.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah, less talking more changing,” said Tony, noticing a state highway patrol car cresting the ridge behind them. “Psst. Lang.” He gestured Scott behind him so he was concealed by the van, and watched as the patrol car sped past, never even tapping its brakes at the sight of the broken-down van and the many teenagers huddled around its rear wheel. When the car disappeared, Scott let out a sigh of relief.
“Yeah, well, that only works if you haven’t had your nose set before,” griped Barton, before letting his hand drop so Steve could take a look. “How’s it looking?”
, kid,” crowed Carol. “Easy! Please oh please don’t ever go to Los Angeles, you’ll be taking three dicks on video in a van before your first sunset, my God.”
“I, too, do not wish to return to SHIELD without you, brother.”
“All right, spread out,” said Tony, dropping his sunglasses on the table just inside the door of the mansion. “There’s twenty-five bedrooms in this place and nobody’s looking, throw your shit wherever you want. Friday is on a strictly don’t ask, don’t tell policy, so…” he caught Aunt May’s climbing eyebrows, “…try not to do anything catastrophically, you know, seventeen? Other than that, mi casa is su casa, talk to Friday for anything you need, kitchen’s right through there and I’ll see you all in the pool.” His guests filtered out to the wings of the mansion, which spread like a manta ray in a graceful curve along the entire rocky length of a small inlet, a cluster of jewel-like infinity pools and soaking tubs nestled between its arms.
“Thor?”
“A, shut up, B, it makes sense I know his run times, I’m on the team too, and C, I was the last person to see him at SHIELD so D, shut up again, this is just a faster way of finding him than waiting for Fury to get off his ass,” Tony said.
want to do anything with a group of furious – overprotective super humans interrogating him like some criminals.
“He won’t leave this place unscathed.” Wanda’s eyes were blank, seemingly planning something absurd in her mind.
“I’m Michelle, people usually call me MJ. Ned and I are classmates and he trusts all of you with me, so don’t worry about it. Shall we go?” MJ replies as she began to lead them to their seats.
Flash appearance was in distress. The cause came from several directions and the impact is crushing him so much that he has trouble breathing properly and cold sweats running down his cheeks.
“Got it,” said Peter Parker, looking over Scott Lang’s shoulder at the map. The two promptly got in a hissing argument.
“Yep, ‘s me,” Tony continued, half-distracted, seemingly nonplussed by the table’s collective gawp. This was, after all, the first time he’d deigned to speak to anyone at the table except Barton. “Listen, I’m thinking about getting in some trouble and you all have the requisite amount of sublimated sexual tension and latent criminality. So, come help.”
said Clint, pointing elaborately at his own chest. “I saw
Steve, eyes closed, nodded.
Steve carefully pincered the iron and set it back in its holder, but not before it had seared an inch-long divot into the cheap synthetic carpet. The plasticy fibers, melted into a black, gluey mass, emitted a noxious stench—Tony and Steve looked at each other in dismay for one moment, and then the fire alarms went off.
“You know what, IKEA, I don’t go over to your lingonberry bog and call it backwards,” started Clint, and Bruce held up his hands: “Woah, woah, woah, let’s all calm down a little—Natasha, where are you going?”
After that, things got
“Don’t imagine that made him too popular,” Steve said.
“Love you too, Tony,” Maria Hill called back, her tone dry ice. “Pick up your trash out of the hall.”
And to see Bucky.
Tony looked around at the circle of blank faces. “See, the looks you’re looking at me with tell me that I’m right. You all need a vacation. Everyone, in this room, needs to get away for a while. Ideally, to a private island. Luckily,” he said, uncorking a bottle with his teeth and talking around the cork, “I have one of those. Actually, I have two or three of those—Friday, how many private islands do I have?”
