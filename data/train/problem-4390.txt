Cas looked at Dean and smiled slightly, "Dean, I would love to, but I'm moving to Europe, I won't be able to be there for him. I'm sorry." Cas smile disappeared "Sorry" he repeated himself, looking down slightly, he gave a Dean a small nod and headed home. Dean was stuck there, watching Cas leave, unsure of what to say. It felt like Dean was watching Cas leave for hours, but in reality, it was only for a minute, time slowed down when Dean was around Cas. As Dean began to bring himself back a Doctor came out and told Dean that Lisa was awake, Dean went back into Lisa's room and stayed there until Lisa and Ben were released from the hospital.
Time began to pass relatively fast after they finished bowling, before Dean knew it he was back at home. "Enjoy it?" Dean asked Lisa, he was sure her answer was yes but thought it'd be nice to ask. Lisa nodded "What about you? Did you enjoy it?" Dean smiled, he didn't want to give a real answer, he knew if he answered he would have to lie, and he didn't feel like lying. Lisa smiled and hugged Dean, Lisa fell asleep as soon as she closed her eyes, Dean stayed up for a little longer, looking at the ceiling thinking about what this day was, thinking how it could've been Cas wrapped around him.
Lisa hugged Dean but all Dean could do was sit there, it was like he was paralysed. He knew what this meant, his parent were super religious, he couldn't tell them that he got Lisa pregnant out of marriage, they wouldn't speak to him, they'd disown him. He had to marry Lisa. That night Dean went out and bought a ring, he had to marry the person he didn't loved, had to marry someone who wasn't Cas.
Over the next few years Cas continued to date Balthazar and Dean continued to date Lisa. Dean and Cas were beginning to get on speaking terms again and although they both loved each other Cas didn't want to risk Dean cheating on him again, risk having Dean break his heart again, so he decided he wouldn't be stupid and act on his feelings. Dean moved in with Lisa and Cas moved in with Balthazar. Dean didn't have feelings for Lisa, he just wanted to show Cas that he was moving on even though the truth was he wasn't. He had spent countless nights trying to figure out a way to show Cas how sorry he was, try to show Cas how he was better than Balthazar. Sam had been to visit Dean a few times in the years, he slowly began to forgive Dean, he knew how much Dean regretted hurting Cas, that Dean would do anything to change what he did.
"Hello Dean, you enjoying yourself?" Lisa's voice was soft and sweet, she placed her hand on Dean's shoulder and Dean smiled at it. "Yeah, this- this is a sick party" Dean shouted a little louder than he needed causing Lisa to laugh. "Let's go somewhere quieter" Lisa  whispered as she began to drag Dean upstairs, Dean followed happily. When they reached Lisa's room she closed the door, she turned to face Dean and pulled him in. In a matter of seconds she was kissing Dean. Dean pushed her off in disbelief, Cas was right, he shouldn't have come here. Lisa pulled him close again and began to kiss him, this time however, Dean did not push her away, he deepened the kiss and lifted her onto his waist and walked to the bed. Lisa smiled and took off her top and Dean done the same, their lips only parting for a second as their tops went over their heads, they lips touched again as the kiss continued to deepen. In a matter of second Dean and Lisa were naked, Dean was kissing down her chest, she moaned slightly and Dean smiled. Lisa then reached into a draw and handed Dean a condom, matters escalated quickly. Dean put the condom on, kissed Lisa again as he began to thrust into her. Dean could feel Lisa's mouth opening as she moaned his name. Dean let a moan out of his own, he stopped kissing her for a short moment so he pushed himself deeper in her, he lent back down and kissed her, both moaning into each other's mouths. This is when the door flew open.
Dean first met Castiel when he was walking to class, Castiel had been his usual clumsy self and walked straight into Dean. When Dean turned around he was met with the bluest eyes he had ever seen; that's how the 'perfect' couple had met. It had been a year since Dean finally got the confidence to ask Castiel out, a year since they both realised that they couldn't live without the other in their life.
Cas woke up moments later, trying to get air back into his lungs. Lucifer was still on top of him, but now he was putting his dick back into his trousers. Cas laid his head back, breathing never felt so good. Lucifer removed the ball gag and Cas started to gasp at the air. Lucifer's hands made their way down Cas' torso, Cas could feel nails digging in at his side making him yelp in pain. This only made Lucifer press harder, Lucifer grabbed a handful of Cas' hair once again, he pushed Cas' face to the side exposing Cas' neck. Lucifer then lent down, he kissed Cas' neck before sinking his teeth into the skin. Cas screamed in pain, he felt the blood rolling down his skin onto the white duvet. Lucifer didn't stop, he bit harder making Cas scream even louder. Cas' tears now streaming fast and his cries of pain getting louder he began to beg for Lucifer to stop. Lucifer loosened his teeth and sat back up, his lips stained red from Cas' blood.
“Breathe … please, God, just breathe” tears were spilling from Dean’s eyes as he heard Castiel take a deep breathe.
"I can't even look at you Dean, how could you do that to Cas? Cas?" Sam loved Dean but he loved Cas too, he walked away from the door, away from Dean. He couldn't believe Dean, what made him think he could ever fix this, Dean fucked up bad. Sam decided to go back to Dean, he opened the door and saw his brothers broken face. "Dean, I'm sorry, but I can't help you. You have to fix this on your own".
Dean knew that Cas was running out of time, he needed to tell his angel everything before it was too late!
Cas never made it there.
The first year with Ben was the best year of Dean's life, Ben had green eyes like Dean's, but definitely had Lisa's facial features. Somehow, his hair- his hair was just like Cas'. Dean loved Ben, but having Ben's hair look like Cas' was just hurting, the ebony black colour and the neat mess was breaking Dean's heart, reminding him of his one true love.. Lisa was trying her best to ignore the pain in Dean's eyes but she could tell he missed Cas so much. It was Dean's birthday when Lisa gave him an amazing surprise, he opened his card and out fell a ticket to go to England. The last time Dean had spoken to Cas he said how he was living in England. Dean looked at the ticket wide-eyed and his eyes began to water. "Dean, we said we'll stay together for Ben, but I believe that we'll be better as friends for Ben, we will argue less and he won't grow up around whatever this is and think it's love, if he see's you with Cas, he will at least know what truth love is like." Dean pulled Lisa into a tight hug, he couldn't believe what he was hearing, Lisa was allowing him to go after Cas, allowing him to be with the man he loved.
Dean packed his bag and left the house, he had to fight the smile that was trying to appear on his face. When he left Cas went to sit down on the sofa, Lucifer sat next to Cas and put his arm around him. "You think you can leave me?" Lucifer sounded calm but annoyed at the same time, Cas looked at him shocked, wondering how he knew "If you're going to plan to run away, make sure you speak quieter" Cas felt sick. He quickly got up to try and run after Dean but instantly felt arms around him, holding him in place. He started screaming, screaming for Dean to come help. Lucifer placed his hand over his mouth trying to muffle the screams, he heard the serious tone from Lucifer telling him to stop, but he didn't, he tried to scream louder. The next thing Cas felt was a punch to his stomach, making him arch over in pain. Another punch made it hard to catch his breath. The third was when he started to cry. Lucifer dragged him up the stairs, holding him a tight as possible. Cas managed to break free for a moment before Lucifer smashed his head into the wall knocking him out cold.
"Deal" Dean gave Cas a peck on his lips, thinking about how lucky he was to have Cas.
"Cas, wait please" Cas stopped in his tracks and turned to face Dean. "I still love you and I know you still love me ... just stay, we can start again, please" Dean was begging, his voice was cracking and tears were forming in his eyes, he couldn't believe he was actually saying this, he always thought of saying it but never did, he was always scared what Cas' response would be. "You're wrong" Cas whispered turning to walk away, his worst nightmare had come true, Cas didn't love him anymore. What Dean didn't know was saying those words broke Cas' heart, because they were far from the truth, he loved Dean, wanted to be with Dean but knew he couldn't be with Dean again, not after how badly Dean hurt him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was so lost in the moment that he didn't even notice Lisa watching from their bedroom window, she heard everything Dean had said. Envy filled up inside her, she refused to let Dean leave her, Dean was her's and no one else's. To stop Dean leaving she created a plan, something she knew would make Dean stay with her forever.
“Cas?” finally Dean was able to get control of himself, he watched as Cas relaxed his tense body, the cries were more audible now, Dean walked towards the bed noticing more details as he got closer, the cum dried around him and on him, the blood stain on the pillow coming from Cas’ head, Cas at this point turned to face Dean, his eyes were red and puffy from the tears. Dean could see the desperation in his eyes, the relief that he was no longer alone and at Lucifers torment. Cas started crying more trying to pull himself out of the restraints not caring if it hurt, he just wanted to hug Dean and be in safe arms. Dean watched as Cas’ wrists began to scratch against the restraints, drawing blood. Dean rushed over trying to stop Cas hurting himself, hoping he could calm Cas down.
Dean’s funeral wasn’t anything special.
“Cas?”
After Lucifer finished talking they all went into the restaurant, they were quickly led to their table and seated. It was quite a fancy restaurant, Dean felt really under dressed, he looked around and saw everyone wearing suits or dresses. Dean looked down at his own clothes, noticing how his jeans looked dirty and ripped, his top was just a plain t-shirt nothing fancy. He felt like he really didn't belong there. His thoughts were cut off by Lucifer asking him a question "so, Dean, what do you do?" there was a judgemental tone behind the question, like Lucifer knew it wasn't the best paying job in the world. Dean smiled, still trying his best to be polite, "I work in a mechanics, hoping to open up my own one soon. What about you, what do you do?". Dean was looking Lucifer in the eyes, he saw a small smile appear on Lucifer's face. "I'm a criminal defence solicitor. It's a decent wage and I have to admit, the people I defend tell good stories, even if most of them result in murder." Lucifer laughed like it was the funniest joke he's ever heard, making Dean feel very uncomfortable.
Cas smiled back and looked into Dean’s eyes “You’re so … handsome” Cas whispered placing his hand against Dean’s cheek, Dean grabbed his hand and kissed it softly. He knew he had to keep Cas talking to keep him awake, and knew exactly what to talk about …
It took a moment, but Cas eventually told Dean, "He hit me, only once and it only left a small bruise, he felt terrible after but we both agreed that we didn't love each other" Dean felt sick, Balthazar shouldn't have touched Cas, even if it was just once. Dean was full with anger but when he looked at Cas he calmed down. "Cas, I never knew, I'm sorry" Dean's anger quickly disappeared and was replace with a gentle loving tone. "and what you said about me not loving you anymore, that's not true. I told you that I couldn't be with you because you're with Lisa. Dean you have to stay with Lisa, she's having your child." Cas smiled sadly at Dean, "Cas ... I don't love her, I love you. I have always loved you" Dean took a step forward trying to get closer to Cas, but Cas took a step back. "Dean, I know what it's like to be cheated on, I'm not going to make someone else feel like that." The moment the words left Cas' mouth he wished he could take them back, not because he didn't mean it, but because of Dean's reaction, the hurt and pain on Dean's face. "Dean, I'm sorry." Cas placed a hand on Dean's shoulder before turning around, he began to walk home leaving Dean standing alone in the middle of the street alone.
, he used to think -- in his old language, the one of stars a million light years from earth and of the profound blue a thousand miles under the ocean and of the chirping of a lone cricket in the countryside as the sky lit up with fireflies --
but he had gasped because Dean put his hand in his head. He had never felt more powerful in his life, but Cas was still kissing Dean in the same measured way, still just practicing, treading the making out waters, and Dean wanted him to lose it even more, wanted him to moan and bite and get wet and sloppy, wanted to hear that gravel-road voice say his name.
"If you would be inclined to, uh, do that again, well. I wouldn't be opposed to you having a few more experiences that were more than fine."

"It was fine."

had been the one to teach him so many saying and would be the one to teach him so many more. And Dean's mouth was dry and his cheeks were hot and he wanted to laugh and smile and joke back at Cas, so overwhelmed with affection it nearly rivaled his desire to make Cas's eyes flutter shut, to make him let out one of those little surprised, pleased moans he had heard back in the Impala.

"It was adequate. I understand the human need for physical contact as something to be fulfilled, and it seemed a passable way of fulfilling that need." The last thing Cas had called a passable way of fulfilling a human need was the chicken Caesar salad Sam made him try. Sex, in Dean's opinion, was a hell of a lot better than a chicken Caesar salad.

all of it had been Dean's doing. He lowered his mouth to the head of Cas's leaking dick, eyes not leaving his, wanting to see exactly how Cas's face changed when he felt a tongue on his cock for the first time. He flicked out his tongue to taste Cas's precome, to drag it slow over the head of his dick and see Cas's eyes flutter closed and his mouth open further in shock, too caught up in the sensation to do anything else. Then Dean was lost.
So when the past Dean was angry at his future self for torturing again, Cas laughed, a small vindication after all these years. The Dean of now glared at him.
Of course he disapproved. Cas was a shitty little soldier after all. Couldn’t stay an angel, couldn't heal himself, could hardly keep his
"I'll teach you anything you wanna know, Cas."
And that could have been that.
, let alone how to express it. He couldn't even properly articulate his newfound worthlessness in his own mind (but oh, how he tried; a single snowflake in a blizzard, a speck of dark matter in a black hole, a drop of warm water in the Arctic ocean), how could he possibly tell the rest of the camp, tell
"You'd be good at hustling pool, if you were any better at lyin' to people about being good at stuff."
A week before Cas was off bed rest, Dean came into Cas's cabin. Cas, in his half hung-over, half still high state, barely noticed the clenching of his jaw and the tightness in Dean shoulders when he saw Aaron and Cas tangled together. He had come to bring Aaron on a mission, his first one out. Cas heard the gunshot when they got back, knew Dean had shot an infected Aaron in the head even before Chuck softly knocked on his door to break it to him. Cas barely heard him he was flying so high.
Dean nearly lost his balance with how fast his hands went to his own belt, shoving his pants and underwear just far enough down his hips to take himself in hand, too dry until he pulled off Cas's spit-slick cock, groaning at the sight, and spit into his palm to ease his way, diving back down to his task.
"I mean, you've kissed people before though, yeah? I wouldn't think there's all that much of a difference, maybe some beard involved, but--"
was didn't want to do it again? This was Cas, he would just say so if he wanted to stop or continue, right? Would he want to have a whole conversation about it or would he just go for it?  Should Dean just go for it? But he didn't want to freak Cas out, the whole point was a slow introduction to the whole kissing dudes thing, maybe that would be too fast for him.
? Didn't panic the instant you thought something was wrong with him? Don't think I don't know every little thing that goes on in that little camp of yours. He was all you had left and all he wanted to do was forget about you. Don’t think I don’t know you would have given the world for him to have meant that kiss, for him to not have been gone from the world because of some hallucinogenic plant or another. Don't think I don't know you wanted to murder the girls who slept with him. Or that boy. The big-eyed one, I would describe him better, but I can't keep as close tabs on the little cockroaches that aren't infected with my little masterpiece of a disease."
Dean didn't know how to bring it up. How were you supposed ask an angel of the lord if he likes dick? Dean wasn't even sure (he was pretty sure) Cas was checking that guy out. How many times are you supposed to watch your friend maybe check out guys before you brought it up? Or was Cas supposed to bring it up? Would Cas even realize? He had
" Cas gasped, and it was Dean's favorite way anyone had said his name, wanted to make Cas say it like that a million times more, but before he could tell Cas to say it again, his hands were tightening in his hair, holding his head in place. Cas wasn't quite fucking his face--and if Dean's mouth were free, he would tell him that he could, that he should--but his hips were thrusting forward in tiny, desperate movements as Cas let out choked out little gasps, higher and higher and higher until he shuddered forward, coming in Dean's mouth. Dean felt him pulse against his tongue as he swallowed him down, wanting to keep Cas's dick in his mouth for as long as possible, feeling satisfied and safe under Cas's hands, between Cas's legs. Eventually, Cas softens and Dean lets him slip out of his mouth, still in a daze as Cas pulls him to his feet.
set off a trip wire in Dean's brain, making him alert enough to remember that Cas, despite his inching closer to human norms, was not the sort of person to return questions to the asker in a standard conversational volley. He was trying to change the subject.
Eventually the one woman every night turned into two or three, sometimes more. He didn't even keep track nowadays. It didn't matter. Clinging to the last vestiges of the old tongue for the sole purpose of describing Dean like it was a religion didn't require him to know how many holes he had fucked, how many pills he had popped, or how many bottles he had drunk. He just needed
and his mouth relaxed and Dean darted his tongue out to just skim across Cas's upper lip and then Cas's tongue was brushing up against his as he went to mirror Dean and the contact shot straight to Dean's embarrassingly, achingly hard dick.
Dean how to tell if he was attracted to someone. But Dean had told him and he had checked that guy out, so maybe he was figuring it out now? Dean thought he should maybe give him some space, not at all influenced by the fact that he had
Then Cas's expression changed minutely, and his usual stare suddenly becoming a physical weight pressing down on Dean's chest, making his cheeks heat up and his tongue dry. He had said some form of
"It's different." Cas interrupted. "It's not just a task, or just being close to another person" Dean flashed back to sleeping with the girl at the motel, wondering how Cas would have felt touching her. Apparently he hadn't been far off. "It's. . . It has broader implications." He was still looking at the wall. Dean thought he didn't like talking about these more human aspects of his life, he had millennia following orders, being a soldier, doing what he was told and what he was good at, and suddenly he was trying to navigate a world he didn't understand, groping around in the dark trying to figure out what he wanted without someone telling him, not knowing if he would succeed at what he wanted most.
to someone who had only had--apparently--mediocre sex. "Look, say. . . Is there someone in this bar who you look at and wanna
Dean had gotten him his own cabin, Cas knew he was being exiled, hardly even worthy of Dean's notice, much less his sleeping quarters. Chuck was waiting for him there when he arrived, friendly in his stumbling sort of way. He offered him a small orange bottle, stammering something out about painkillers, should he ever get hurt. Cas let him finish and hurry out, off to fill his role.
"Human," Cas finished for him, disgust for himself welling up. He couldn't even hear Dean say the word that made him redundant. "Yes."
It was different from the motel, from the car, because Cas was
. Just gentle kisses, no depth or heat, lips sliding against each other with little pressure behind them, like a lingering goodbye after an afternoon coffee date, no intention of taking things further or heated memories behind it. It had been a long time since Dean had kissed anyone like this. It had been a long time since he'd kissed anyone he'd known longer than a week. He wasn't sure if he'd ever kissed anyone he'd known more than a year (maybe you could count Lisa, if the nine year gap between meetings still counted). He would have thought it would be weirder, kissing Cas, kissing a friend. But it was nice. He loved a good panty-dropping, we-just-met-but-we're-gonna-know-each-other-a-whole-lot-better-soon sorta kiss, but this was nice. He felt settled, feeling the feathers he had felt ruffle in himself over the course of their conversation, over the last few weeks watching Cas watch guys, not knowing how to nudge him in the right direction, smooth back into place. His nervous thoughts slowed and quieted until he wasn't thinking at all any  more, just kissing Cas slow and steady.
"Oh? So you didn't drop half of your responsibilities to give Castiel his own cabin? Or his own clothes? Didn't want him to be waltzing around in your clothes like he was
"I would appreciate your assistance in that matter."
how to ask a celestial entity in the body of a radio ad salesman if he might like to take it up the ass (or stick it up someone's ass?).
"What? I like past you." Cas snarked at Dean. Past Dean, the one Cas had fallen for -- in every sense of the word.
Now they were in yet another bar in yet another town and Cas kept glancing over at some guy playing pool instead of listening to Dean recount the tale of the bloody Mary case way back when while Sam half-successfully flirted with some girl. Dean wouldn't be so bothered by it if Cas had decent taste in men, but this guy--like the others--set off his douchedar. He didn't even know how to hustle properly, was playing strangers but was too cocky about it, his self-satisfied smirk every time he made a shot keeping bets low and casual.
"Why would I want that with someone who I do not know will provide a satisfactory experience?"
"You know, like, guys. Guys who are open to guys. Guys who are
what Cas was doing to him, what he was doing to Cas, drive him over the edge, moaning around Cas's cock as he spilled onto the ground.
"Yeah, I mean. It won't be exactly the same as going for it with someone you're attracted to, but maybe that would take some of the pressure off?" Dean wondered if he sounded like he was trying to fuck Cas. "I mean, only if you think that would be helpful it's not like. . ."
Wonder and shock and awe and a million other confused feelings flitted through his mind in an instant. He barely registered the conversation with Dean, but 2009 and Zachariah were the only things he really needed to know. So it shouldn't have been a surprise when Dean asked for him to "strap on his angel wings" because, to Dean, he still had them, he was still
When he slipped his fingers inside her and put his mouth to her clit he thought,
attracted to her? Don't matter if she's hot to most people."
It was definitely a guy Cas had been looking at. Square jaw, short, curly hair, and an open posture, his beer bottle dangling from his fingers between sips. He looked around the room with a lazy confidence that set Dean's teeth on edge. He ordered a beer for himself and one for Cas--Sam had barely started on his with his monologuing about the curse's tragic backstory--trying not to glance over at the guy too much. He was handsome, Dean guessed. Could probably throw a decent punch but couldn't take one, which shouldn't have been important, but felt like it was. He seemed, Dean thought as he handed over cash in exchange for their drinks, like he was used to things going his way, being able to charm his way through life. It was a little more psychoanalysis than Dean usually bothered with off of first impressions of strangers in bars, but Cas didn't look at most strangers in bars, so Dean felt he had a right to be a bit more curious than normal.
That, he thought with a spark of satisfaction, brought Cas's attention fully back to Dean. Then Cas, just like the last time, took a measuring scan of the room, his gaze resting on the pool-playing man for a hair longer than the rest, before turning back to him. "There aren't any women here I find to be attractive. To me. Is there anyone you are interested in seeing more of? I assume in more than just the one implication of the phrase."
Cas broke his foot that mission. Great start. Dean carried his weight with Cas's arm over his shoulder to Cas's cabin to bandage him up. The pain lancing hot through his body, worse than his wrist had been, worse than the gash on his arm. The instant Dean laid him down on the bed Cas was grabbing for the pill bottles on his nightstand, anything to drown out the hurt. Dean looked on disapprovingly as he wrapped Cas's foot up.
"Are you coming?"
Before Dean could tell Cas to let him know if he saw someone and he could wingman for him--which would certainly lead to an explanation of the term "wingman" and Dean making a joke about it applying to Cas more than Dean, which would lead to Cas explaining that his wings aren't
"You're offering to kiss me." Dean couldn't tell how Cas felt about his offer. Hell, he wasn't sure if
Instead, Dean found his way into the bed of a woman staying in the motel room next to theirs, and when he heard her first moan, elicited by a kiss at the base of her neck, his first thought was

The pills weren't the end for Cas. Of course not, he had learned how to cope with inadequacy and grief from

time, Sam. At least I don't make out in the back of mini vans with girls with purity rings like a teenager." Which, admittedly, also happened just the one time), but agreed. When they were settled in to their motel, Sam broke off to go to a gym (apparently sitting in the passenger seat for 8 hours and the driver's seat for 7 most days was messing with his fitness). Dean cracked some jokes, but had been counting on his little brother peeling off for the night to do something or other (whether the gym was a cover story for "other," and Sam just was trying to lose Dean for the night to pick up women, Dean didn't need to know until there was a walk of shame he could make fun of). When Sam was gone, he turned to Cas and clapped his hands. "So, I was thinking we could hit some bars? Maybe some more, ah,
Dean first noticed weeks after Cas, weeks that Cas had spent horrified at the idea that he couldn't fly, couldn't heal, couldn't help anymore. His old language -- the one of northern auroras and dewdrops in the morning and the birth of stars -- was fading fast and he could barely even wrap his head around what a dust storm swirling through the desert was supposed to
“Hey.”  He said softly as he closed the door.  He knew Cas would be able to hear them if he wanted to, but better to have the illusion of privacy than not.
“You’re a dork, but I’ll put up with you anyway.”  He said when he pulled back.  Dean laughs despite himself and holds Cas tighter gently bumping their heads together.
Anyway Cas
“Maybe.” Cas kissed the crown of the dick then, just a touch of his tongue flicking out.  “but I can’t remember wanting something as much as I want you before.” Dean tried to imagine how Cas could go millennia not want something this bad. He couldn’t fathom it. “I don’t know…I’ve never…” He gave the head of Dean’s cock a questioning lick.
“Yeah, and Cas is…our…angel.”  He finished lamely.
“Something like that.”  Dean nodded proudly, Sam was surprised at how easily he not only believed, but continued to follow a man he was slowly starting to forget.  Maybe there was something instinctual in there that made Dean know Sam wouldn’t harm him.  Maybe it was just because Sam was the only one around.  “There’s Cas too.”
Dean tossed the covers off realizing he was never going to get to sleep.  Stupid Sam getting him all worked up over nothing. He stalked into the kitchen hoping a midnight snack might help.  When he flicked on the lights he came face to face with Cas sitting at the kitchen table.
“I thought you couldn’t remember any of that!”
“Hey I could sign that for you!” Dean kicked himself at how utterly stupid that sounded.
“Dean, why did you come to get me?”
“I thought you might be with Cas.”
“Werewolves are real too?”
Takes place right after 12x12
“I have realized that your…preferences don’t include,” He gestured toward himself, “but it is just a vessel.”  Cas paused and Dean was trying so hard to find the right words, but they were all stuck in his throat. “Though even without it I have always been referred to as he.  Castiel is a male name, though I suppose you wouldn’t know that.”  Cas was rambling and Dean couldn’t get his brain to quiet.
“I thought you didn't want displays of sentimentality.”  Cas cracked one eye open to peer at Dean skeptically. Dean finished off by pressing a kiss to Cas’ forehead.
“This is…this is stupid Sam.”  Sam hoped it was a good sign that he wasn't out right denying it. “Is this about when I lost my memory?”  That threw Sam. It must have shown on his face since Dean looked less and less wrong-footed with each passing second.
“The point is that we both come.” He punctuated with a thrust of his hips.  A part of him thought he was like a teenager. The were just making out and rubbing against each other instead of having sex, but right now he wasn’t ready to wrap his head around full on gay sex.  Plus it’s not like Cas was complaining.  He was devouring Dean’s mouth as Dean kept rutting against him, snaking a hand down to wrap around both of them.  He was glad to find Cas leaking pre-come like a faucet since it meant he didn’t have to stop to grab for some lube.  Cas let out another growl that Dean was already developing a thing for, and in a show of his inhuman strength lifted Dean and flipped him onto his back as if he weighed nothing. “Yes!”  Dean hissed as Cas settled between his thighs.  He tried not to examine too closely the implication of being on his back with his legs wrapped tightly around Cas’ hips.  Instead he just enjoyed how this new angle allowed Cas to thrust down better, and how he fucked Dean’s fist now, cock dragging against the other man’s in a way that made Dean’s toe’s curl.  Cas was babbling something that Dean couldn’t understand, but he had a suspicion it was enochian.  “Fuck Cas! I’m so close, come for me baby.”  Dean watched Cas’ face as his orgasm hit.  It seemed to take him by surprise, mouth open in a wordless shout.  His blue eyes lit up…literally.  It was that little blue glow that was Cas’ grace, and it washed over Dean making him feel So. Fucking.
“Dean, I don’t sleep.”  Dean was lying in bed with Cas still standing awkwardly to the side.
“What, why?”
“And I think you feel the same.”  Sam continued on as if Dean hadn’t interrupted. Dean was silent for a moment, just huffing in aggravation.  “Tell me I’m wrong.”  Dean let his arms fall out at his sides looking a Sam like he was being ridiculous. He ran a hand over his face and it seemed to harden his resolve.
“Because you thought you were dying.”
Dean frowned and said, “No,” almost before he could finish his sentence. “I don’t. I don’t think of you the same way as I do Sam.”  Cas’ face fell.
Sam was maybe putting off having the difficult conversation.  It was going to be like pulling teeth getting Dean to admit these big emotions.  Then Cas almost died.  Sam wasn’t surprised to see his brother go immediately to the angel’s side.  He was surprised by how well Dean was holding it together; maybe he was too deep in denial about the situation.
“Will you lay with me?” He was already moving toward the middle of the bed.  Dean knew he wasn’t talking about anything sexual, he wanted to cuddle.  Dean thought about all the pain he saw in Cas today and the hurt he was feeling at being kicked out of the bunker.  He thought he should be the last person Cas turned to for comfort, but at the same time was glad that his angel still wanted him close.  He didn’t answer, just crawled under the covers and slotted himself against Cas, to which the angel made himself comfortable.
“Yeah it’s great.”  Dean smiled and took Cas’ hand. “Come on.”  He turned and led the way to his bedroom, Cas close behind.  Once Dean closed the door his hands set to work divesting Cas of his coat and jacket, and shirt, and tie.
“Yeah, physically he’s fine, but we almost lost him…you almost lost him.”  Sam knew he was hedging.
“Yeah! My brother and I are heroes, our mom is apparently a stone cold badass, and I’m dating a literal angel! Don’t really see a down side there!”  Sam rolled his eyes.  As nice as it would be to keep Dean in his little rose-colored world, he needed his real brother back.  Time to find that witch.
“Yeah, I mean you fight sometimes, but you always forgive each other, you’ve been together for years now.” Then Dean smiled again, a small dreamy thing that had Sam mentally smacking his forehead.
“I told you because…”
“He does, it’s just that humans can’t see them unless he wants them to.” Dean nodded, holding Sam’s phone and still staring at the picture.
“Why would you want to sign my bandages?  Do people do that often?”
“Is…is that alright?”
“Dean, the fate of the world often hinges on how well you and your brother are getting along.  If you could…indulge me.”  Dean scowled at him, but couldn’t really disagree.
“Because you’re my friend, and you’re hurt.”
“Ok, I trust you.” Dean couldn’t help the little voice in the head that whispered, you shouldn’t. “It won’t be forever.”  He imitated in a voice quieter than Dean even thought he was capable of. “Will you…”
Dean was really starting to get on his nerves.  He had already forgotten once that witches existed and that they were hunting one.  To be fair Dean was taking everything better than the average civilian.
“Like a guardian angel?”  Again that trusting innocent face turned to Sam and he got the most devious idea.  Dean would believe whatever Sam told him.
“Can’t sleep.”
Dean comes to a stop in front of number 9 at the Sleepy Inn after a very interesting trip to the ER. He wasn’t prepared for just how difficult it was to fill out paper work for someone who has only been human for a couple of months.  It made him wonder just what Cas put on his job application, he didn’t even have a made up last name for Christ sake.
“Hey, you’re not useless!  You’re still the guy who wasted all those sorry bastards in hell!  You saved my ass more than a few times.”  This gave him an idea; he pushed Cas back a little so he could strip off his coat and flannel.  Cas’ eyes were red-rimmed and confused.  “Look, you pulled me from the pit.  See right here.”  He rolled up his t-shirt sleeve to reveal the handprint.  The proof that Cas had once been an angel, maybe the only tangible proof there is left.  Cas fitted his hand (his good one luckily enough) over the spot, Dean almost immediately felt warmth spread from the touch.
“Dean, you’re perfect.”
“I do, Dean.”  Cas wasn’t laughing, or tilting his head.  Instead he was staring at Dean like he did when he had to tell him something serious.  No, not serious, important. He didn’t really know how to respond, every argument he had come up with in his head when he was staring at Sam vanished when leveled with Cas’ sincere blue eyes.
“Come on, Cas.”
...Nope.
“Why you cast me out.”  It’s then that Dean notices the pain in his hand where the cast is digging in, because Cas is trying to hold his hand tighter.  Hearing him say that Dean ‘cast’ him out, made him hate the decision even more, which he didn’t think was possible.  He was cast out of heaven, was Dean’s betrayal just as bad? “Dean, please, I don’t understand” Cas was crying, so Dean does the only thing he can, He wrapped his arms around him and rubbed his back, trying to say something soothing.  “I don’t know what I am anymore, I try to be human, but it always goes wrong somehow.  I once led an army of angels into hell, and we won!  I can’t…I’m useless now.”  Dean held tight through his short rant, but couldn’t hear more.
“Why?”  The desperate breath against his lips had him pulling Cas in for one more taste.  He could spend all night trying to get just one more.
“Sounds like everything’s great!” Dean exclaimed happily.
“It’s when you say sweet things to each other after sex.”  Dean started kissing Cas, but he made no effort to kiss back so Dean moved to his cheek. “You say how good they made you feel.”  A kiss on his nose. “You talk about how devastatingly handsome they are.”  He kissed the corner of Cas’ mouth where it curled up in a poorly concealed smile. “You say how fucking lucky you are to have them”
“He said he loves all of us, we’re family!”
He brushes his hand against Cas’ as they pass and it’s the most natural thing in the world.
“Perish the thought, Dean.”
And worth it.  Cas wasn’t shy or unsure as Dean would have thought.  After a moment of tenderness, that might have been Dean’s doing, he dove in like a dying man finally quenching his thirst.  It wasn’t long before their tongues were battling for space in the other’s mouth.  It was like a dam broke inside Dean’s chest, he reveled in the slide of Cas’ lips against his.  It wasn’t until Cas was pulling away, no don’t stop, to finish pulling Dean’s t-shirt off, that he realized he was undoing the buttons on Cas’ shirt.
"That was, uh . . ." Dean starts and immediately trails off, unsure if he'll be able to put together a coherent sentence at the moment.
Halfway to completely stoned already, Cas began to lay every ounce of false flattery he had on the girls for Dean to hear. It was just masochism on his part, really. Dean didn't care who he fucked, the blank look on his face every time Cas walked out of his cabin smelling of sweet smoke and sex said as much. But Cas still flaunted it, still glanced back at Dean and winked before sending the women off to shower.
A week later, they're in a dive bar waiting to meet up with Sam, who must be nearing last call at the local library, when Dean brings it up.
Dean just gritted his teeth and pulled the Colt out and aimed it right at his little brother's head as Lucifer made Sam's face twist into a smile. "Die you dumb son of a bitch."
weird and low pressure and--"
He kept running over their conversation in his head. Had it been implied it was a one-time thing? Or that they'd do it again? He didn't know if he was supposed to look at Cas or not. How much was normal for him to look as Cas If he paid enough attention, could he tell what Cas wanted? Or would he freak him out staring? Could anyone could freak Cas out by staring? Sammy would notice if he was staring. Especially when it was hard to keep a straight face looking at Cas, he had kissed him intense and studious, exactly the way Cas would kiss someone. It was too normal, too much like Cas, to separate it from the Cas who explained monster lore to them. It hadn't changed anything that they had kissed. Hadn't changed Cas, or their friendship, or the way he acted. Everything continued on as it had before.
And if Cas had said that a week ago, it would have slipped Dean by. He would have taken a look around the room himself, settled on some girl, and taken off with a grin and a wink. But now, Cas specifying
He learned how to remember quickly though. Exactly how high to get when sleeping with the women who began coming through his doorway with some form of drugs or another. One brought in something in a needle once, Cas had sent her away. He didn't need anything poking out of his skin, a tangible reminder of his mortality; that's why he did the drugs in the first place.
trenchcoat trapped between them as Dean ground himself against Cas. He wanted to tug his hair more, make the mess of his hair because of
"That may be a problem…" Cas stumbled over the words, reluctant to let Dean know how inconsequential Cas was now.
When she rolled her hips wildly as he thrust into her from behind he thought,
Instead, a dog barked near them and Dean was brought back into awareness of the fact that they were in a suburban street in the middle of the day waiting for his little brother to come meet them and if he continued on the path he wanted to continue down, wanted to pull Cas down, he would almost certainly get them arrested for public indecency. Which should have been a concerning thought to have about his best friend, but as they pulled apart Cas's gaze lingered on Dean's mouth, distracted in a way Dean had never seen him distracted before and Dean knew that even if they stopped here, he would never stop thinking about this.
It wasn't as different as Dean would have thought. Cas was careful and gentle in his movements, purposefully mimicking the way Dean moved his mouth against his. He thought he would be distracted by the fact this was Cas, this was his friend, this was a man, but instead all he could think about was how awkward the hand that wasn't on the back of Cas's neck was resting on his knee. Should he move it? Should he rest it on Cas's knee? Touch his arm, his shoulder, his back? Was the hand on the neck too much? Too intimate, or possessive? Would it be weird if he moved it away, to rest on his other knee? He was overthinking this, he should be focused on Cas, on the fact that they were kissing.
that Dean wanted to scream.
Dean's hands were in Cas's hair, fingers threaded through the mess that at least one person in that bar had side-eyed when he stood just a little too close to Dean, and finally got to make sure that it was messy for the
been a guy, right? He suddenly doubted himself. Not just a flat-chested woman with short hair? Maybe that was his type? The woman he had sent Cas home with before had been on the bustier side, maybe that was the issue? He nodded along to Sam's plan until he was finished and starting to ask about any intel they had gathered from witness that help might them figure out what object the curse was tied to, then tapped his empty bottle on the table and announced that he was going to get another round.
"Of course."
Dean almost laughed. "Man, I don't know what she did with you but sex--
He tasted better than he had any right to, musky and salty and a little bitter, but it was
But Cas wasn't high enough, wasn't drunk enough, wasn't detached enough to just take this in to let it wind through his thoughts like a lazy river. So Cas kissed him hot and desperate for any grain of truth in Dean's speech, reaching for anything that would let him believe Dean was still
"What? You mean you're-"
The werewolf was back, teeth snapping an inch from Dean's neck as his heart took off again. "Uh, yeah. Yeah sure." His palms were sweaty. He looked away, and looked back, and looked away again, and laughed. It felt strange to go from having a normal (well, kind of normal) talk with Cas to making out, even if he had just
The next time was not the self-sacrificing male nurse who nearly died trying to save one of his patients (though Dean swore Cas's fingers lingered on his forehead after he healed him), nor was it the fry cook who sent over a full plate of breakfast with extra bacon for Cas after they saved him from a particularly nasty poltergeist (Cas hadn't even ordered anything, so it was a little presumptuous to assume Cas wanted so much food, but he ate every bite, only letting Dean steal a single strip of bacon off his plate). Dean didn't suggest Cas pursue them, and Cas didn't try.
About halfway through the second month, Cas had discovered a lovely combination of booze, pills, weed, and some hallucinogenic mushroom Chuck had found in the woods that made it oh so easy to pretend Aaron's huge brown eyes were green, his lithe body was well-muscled yet lean and his round jaw wide and square. He made sure Aaron stayed every day after that, made sure he stayed nights too.
And Dean should have said
"'Cause--" Dean couldn't exactly say
Dean couldn't come like this, wasn't seventeen anymore, wasn't sure if he'd want to, wanted to keep moving against Cas like this for as long as he could, filled up with fire and warmth as he was. But he wanted, wanted more than anything, to make Cas come, to feel his supernaturally-strong grip tighten on Dean, to have another one of his handprints emblazoned on his body in the form of a well-earned bruise from a good memory. So he dragged Cas's face back to his own, pressing a kiss to his desperate mouth as he mumbled, "Stop me if this is too much, okay?" and brought his hands to undo Cas's belt, rolled his tongue into Cas's mouth as he pushed his pants and boxers down, felt the bare skin of Cas's hips. He was on his knees a second later, a twinge going through him from the impact, but he was too focused on Cas, on feeling more skin under his hands, unimpeded by fabric, the evidence of his arousal, of Dean's effect on him, right in front of his face, to notice.
Cas smiled an impossibly soft smile, one Dean had never seen before, and turned to walk out of the door closest to them, one that was probably meant for fire alarms and smokers, not for best friends sneaking out to make out in an alleyway, but one that served their purpose just as well. Dean took one last pull of his beer before abandoning the pool table and following Cas. He nearly lost his nerve walking through the door, tried to think if it would be weird if he just went for it, or if they should try for cursory small talk, if he should point out to Cas that he totally would have won their game if he had kept at it, if he should make fun of him for quitting while he was ahead, when Cas was suddenly in his space. The door had barely clicked close by the time Cas's hands were on his shoulders, pressing him against the wall, and his mouth was on Dean's.
Dean laughed for real this time, it was nice to see Cas shift away from his normal celestial-being-funneled-towards-a-single-goal seriousness to these little sparks of bitchiness--much better than his earlier shift to someone embarrassed and unsure. "Yeah, um, about Sammy. . ."
Cas looked at him for a moment, seeming to run the suggestion through his normal-person-to-uptight-angel translator before responding. "I don't think sexual intercourse is worth leaving you and Sam without backup."
"Anyone here you're into? I bet this gig could be a two-man job if you were trying to get up close and personal with any of the locals."
Cas had lost track of the days by the time Dean reappeared in his life, furious and cold. The night before had been Cas's first time with a guy. Aaron, he thought his name was. Big-eyed and relaxed, he had come for the women, really. But by the time the orgy was in full swing he and Cas were too wrapped up in each other to notice much else. He doubted they would have gotten along as well had they met sober, such was the joy of being stoned -- people were much easier to get along with. That didn't seem to make Dean any happier.
"I would be . . . amenable to continuing this exploration of physical intimacy." Cas said, seeming to choose his words more carefully than usual. Which should have been a turn-off,
"Come with me," Dean commanded, turning on his heel and striding towards his cabin.
There was a bump outside the door, and they jolt apart, Dean's entire body tensing at the thought of someone finding them like that. A curse and stumbled steps away suggested some drunk guy just wobbled a little too far off his path and had found his shoulder suddenly assaulted by the rough outside wall. Dean laughed, more a sound of sudden tension dissipated than genuine amusement--he felt like a teenager again, almost caught by his dad, risking wrath for indulging in such a distraction. He couldn't imagine his dad would have reacted well to this.
Dean didn't know what to say to help. He understood--he thought, he had started kissing girls when kissing was all he had to figure out, had never kissed anyone he wasn't attracted to, never had to catch up to what was supposed to feel right. He didn't know what to say to help, but wanted to help, wanted to do something to make Cas feel better, to make his eyes to leave the spot on the wall they had been glued to for the past 10 minutes. He would later blame that for what he said next. "I could help with that."
-- he was here and Cas was still detached. Didn't feel for him as he had thought he would, if he could do it all over again. Because the Dean of 2014, the one that tortured and killed and hurt, he was Cas's. It didn't matter who Dean became because somewhere, he would always be Dean. The green-eyed protector of the earth. And Cas would follow him off the edge of the earth.
"She was perfectly attractive, according to my understanding of human beauty standards."
it wasn't the aftereffects of the drugs making him think that Dean was kissing him back. If Cas could fix Dean by tearing himself apart with this kiss, he would have. And even though he knew he couldn't, he tried; tried until his eyes began to fill with salt water and his mind began to fill with the broken pieces of Dean. But they were all sucked back into him the instant Risa called outside of the cabin for Dean. His jaw tightened as he pulled away from Cas. Observing him with some unknown look that Cas wanted so badly to be desire in his eye before his expression hardened and he jerked his head for Cas to come.
reason they must have thought. He wondered for a split second if Cas's hair was that soft because of something Jimmy Novak had done, genetically or shampoo-wise, or if that had been angelic intervention, before deciding that it was not worth giving up Cas's mouth against his to hear the answer. Instead, he tugged on his hair just as he had tugged on it in the car, and Cas made the same turned-on noise except it was better because Dean could feel the rumble of it against his own chest, could pull Cas closer against his body, make him press Dean even harder into the rough brick behind him.
"Hopefully that wasn't Sam missing the room after overexerting himself at the gym." Cas said, apparently on the same page as Dean regarding Sam's interest in going to the gym for any reason other than ditching them for the night--though he probably knew Sam's actual intentions though his angelic intel, instead of Dean's good old-fashioned knowing his baby brother.
Dean wished Cas's angel powers let him be in three places at once, let him be kissing Dean while Dean sucked him off while Dean ground his hips against Cas's thigh. Instead, Cas did the next best thing, something Dean wouldn't have thought him to do in a million years, not on his last night on earth, not in this dirty alleyway next to a bar on an April Tuesday. Cas, between gasps and moans and little jerks of his hips, said, "I want you to touch yourself," his voice even more fucked up than normal, rattling under Dean's skin. And pushing his hips against Cas's leg like a horny teenager might not have been enough to get him off, but his voice, the voice that had told him he was saved, that he was worthy of saving, again, and again, and again, might be enough to do it.
It made him remember how once, in the very beginnings of the world, when winds had yet to begin blowing across the world; trees would grow and grow, with no troubles placed upon them. No air to push and push until they reached their breaking point, just water and sun and life. But the instant the winds were released, the moment the first light breeze began to rustle through their branches, the tall, tall trees collapsed under their own weight, their lost invincibility crushing them faster than any storm could have.
"Fine?" Cas supplies. And Dean had nearly forgotten what this whole thing was about, nearly recoils thinking
” Cas didn't know how to respond. Dean must be lying, he had to be.  He was scraping it out in that gruff voice because someone had made him. Chuck, maybe, it must have been Chuck "You're my friend and I need you, so you can't tune out, you can't stay in here all day getting high off patchouli or whatever it is you do. If I need you on a mission, I need you and you are coming with me, angel or not."
sex at least--is a whole lot better than 'fine.'"
Cas squinted at him. Dean was pretty sure angels didn't need glasses, but he was considering taking Cas to get his eyes checked, just in case Jimmy had a prescription Cas was stuck with even after he had been rebuilt with an empty vessel. "How does one know if they find another attractive?"
Soon Dean wasn't Dean anymore. Not the one Cas had fallen for. He was stony-faced and determined, unwilling to let anything get in the way of killing Lucifer. Cas didn't know if that made it hurt more or less as he began to help run the show again, began to regain some of his past fighting skills. With his Dean-substitute gone, he might as well confine his fucking hours to night time. By the time Zachariah brought past Dean to him, he and his own time's Dean couldn't even get along if they tried, no matter how many orders Cas followed, no matter how he resigned himself to their "fearless leaders" ways; the hostility was always just under the surface.
He had tried to be casual, but Cas tensed, eyes skittering away from Dean the same way they had when Dean had first found out he was a virgin, terribly conscious of his lack of experience. Then, defiant, Cas looked back at Dean and said, "Perhaps."
Cas had lost his
When he woke up the next morning naked beside her, he couldn't remember how her limbs had gotten wrapped up in his, though he had a vague notion of what they had done together. Unfortunately, all he remembered of the night before were some half-clear ideas of how to describe the softened curve of Dean's jaw as he slept in the old language, older than Ennochian, older than Death.
"Cas, I don't need you because of some angel mojo, or because you can hop 'round the globe in a second, we can get by without that. I need you 'cause you're

looking at? Wanna see more of what they've got on offer?"
Later, when the camp knew what had happened to Cas, they didn't talk about it. They quieted when they passed him in Dean's clothes, just a bit too big for him. Cas wanted to fly away, off to the Andromeda galaxy, to explore Orion's belt until he could forget the accusations on their faces, the disappointment. But he couldn't do that anymore could he? He couldn't even ease his own mind. He didn't even know how to be human, how could he possibly help run the camp?
Dean sat down next to him on the bed, not sure if he wanted to provide comfort or to break Cas out of staring off, if he just wanted his attention back on him. "It's important to you. You don't want to mess it up." He didn't know if talking about his first kiss--he had been 13, palms sweaty and leaving town the next day, but still desperate for it to be good, for him and the girl, Amelia Hutchins, even if he wouldn't ever see her again--would come off as condescending or not.
It's Cas who seals the deal, Cas who takes Dean's too-long stare and turns it into action with a wry smile. "Would you like to, I believe the correct saying is 'Get some air?'" And Dean had taught him better than using air quotes a long time ago, but that didn't stop them from coming through in his voice, teasing, laden with the knowledge that
Cas himself first noticed when they were shimmying under barbed wire to escape an ambush from Croats. A gash on his arm, bright red against his pale, still clean skin that wouldn't heal-- that
in guys, I mean, you probably don't want to go with anyone who doesn't have any experience with other guys, if you're looking to do anything that might, uh, be better with experience."
uhh they start getting into it here that's the main thing
The next two months Cas spent as he had spent his time before, except with more drugs and somehow, more sex. Dean visited at first, if only to check up on his foot, until Aaron started to come by often, growing bolder in his visits as time progressed.
He didn't look at that bottle for months, just kept it tucked in the bottom drawer of his bedside table, a reminder of his newfound weakness. But one night, a demon snuck its way into one of the fresh recruits, a survivor yet to be inscribed with the sigil to ward of demonic possession. Cas found out first, found the demon and struck it's forehead with his open palm, forgetting for a brief moment that he could no longer exorcise demons so easily. The demon had laughed and bent his wrist back until it popped. Cas knew how to fight, he knew how to bring the demon to its knees even without banishing it through Grace, but he couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't feel past the pain in his wrist. It would have killed him if half the camp hadn't heard his screams and come armed, shouting the exorcism chant just in time to see Castiel, their guardian angel, curled up on the ground, howling over his injured wrist.
. If he allowed himself one second of freedom to be free of conflict, he wouldn't be able to bring himself back to Dean.
Dean would say he had forgotten what Sammy looked like, but that would be a lie. His brother was in an impossibly white suit and wearing a smile that was so
"What do you mean it was fine?" Cas had called cheeseburgers a
Dean decided against telling Cas that bars usually stayed open a lot later in cities than they did in small towns and they could probably still get a couple hours in before last call. "Oh, they're always playing them this time of night. Try channel 8, I'll catch you up."
because he knew him and trusted him, that
A bolt of arousal shot through him, spine to dick to knees on the craggy ground, wondering how he must look, hands in his hair and dick in his mouth, hand moving furiously over his cock. He hadn't even checked if the alleyway was visible from the street, hadn't checked to see if anyone walking by could see him so turned on by Cas's dick so, so hard in his mouth he couldn't stand not touching himself. The thought of someone walking by, of
Then there was a waitress who told Dean her shift ended at 10, who had looked up at him as her lips closed around the tip of his dick and made him think
, Cas thought as the three different pills he had just swallowed began to set in.
"Dean, did we stop in Chicago so you could take me to bars frequented by gay men?"
to countless girls at countless bars in countless towns over the years. He wasn't out of practice, but suddenly it seemed momentous to ask. Anyone else, everyone else, it hadn't mattered. He would find the next girl, maybe in the next bar in the next town, maybe in the same one. But even with Cas looking at him like that, even with Cas saying earlier that day he was down, the prospect pumped Dean full of the same adrenaline he felt swinging a machete towards a vamp's neck, or saying the last words of an exorcism.
Cas didn't notice at first, no one did. He had always spent the nights in Dean's cabin, pretending to read lore and study maps until Dean fell asleep and Cas could watch over him to try and keep nightmares from his mind, even if only for the few hours Dean actually slept. So when the first tendrils of exhaustion began creeping into the corners of his mind and Cas drifted off for 15 minutes, no one was there -- or conscious enough -- to notice.
gasping above him, hands resting on Dean's shoulders like he doesn't know quite where to put them until Dean grabbed one with his free hand to put on his head and the other one followed. Cas's fingers snaking through Dean's hair, little involuntary presses of his fingers whenever Dean hits a spot with his tongue Cas particularly likes, make it even hotter when it was already better than it had any right to be.
It started when Cas had sex. Cas had sex and when Dean asked how it was he shrugged
When Cas got back to camp, everyone stayed their distance. They could tell something was wrong. Cas hoped they'd give him at least an hour until they wanted questions answered.
"No, no, I'm not feeling it tonight." Dean brushed him off, figuring that if Cas had figured it out enough to avoid the subject, Dean had waited long enough. "You say no women, anyone else?"
Cas's mouth fell to Dean's neck, and Dean nearly gave up his quest of chasing the feeling of Cas's leg hitched up against his dick to wonder where the
in the midst of a life of sleeping on hard motel mattresses and getting his ass kicked by monsters, with the only physical pleasures available being beer, coffee, and burgers, Cas had shrugged.
Risa and the grunts had died quickly and Cas was surrounded by demons and Croats when he heard a gunshot. The first real smile he had cracked in five years crept up onto his face. Dean had done it. But then the demons began to smile too, and the Croats began laughing. They all were gone the next moment. Disappearing into the crevices of the old building, a burnt-out angel not important enough for them to bother killing the only living thing left.
It would have been generous to say that was Cas asking a question, but Dean responded anyways, feeling oddly defensive. "Yeah, you're my friend, I want you to get laid, and if going to cities with actual gay bars is what you need to do for that well. . ." Dean tried to gesture in a way that indicated
he learned to do that, because Dean certainly had not been involved in any neck-kissing of any kind with him, before Cas pressed a simple kiss to just below his ear. He must have seen someone else do it, a particularly PDA couple or on one of the Dr. Sexy episodes Dean had made him watch, slightly unsure of the actual mechanics of it. It didn't matter to Dean. The press of his lips against such a vulnerable spot had Dean groaning, head falling forward to latch his own lips onto Cas's neck, running his tongue on the underside of Cas's jaw, sucking bruises he knew Cas could easily heal, running his teeth down the side of his neck, feeling Cas mimic his actions on Dean himself, making him shudder. He moved the hand not on Cas's waist to tug urgently at Cas's tie, getting it loosened enough that he could open up the top buttons of his shirt, drag his collars--three of them, god damn it--open to expose more neck for Dean to get his mouth on.
Dean fell asleep before Balthazar arrived, he woke up and realised he had slept for twelve hours. Dean jumped up and quickly got ready or else he would be late to class, he couldn't be lat again otherwise he'd fail this term, he ran to his class and just made it on time; he was out of breath panting when Lisa walked over to him laughing. "Hello Dean" her voice was higher towards the end, but Dean didn't pay any notice and he smiled back, "Heya" Dean said finally getting his breath back and turned to face Lisa properly. "Dean, there's a party tonight at my place" She smiled slightly but the only response Dean gave was a nod "and, well I was hoping you'll come" She stroked his arm flirtatiously "I really want you to be there"
know how Dean feels about him.  Cas is family, he’s said as much before.  He said it tonight.
Eventually Cas lifted his head and rolled onto his back next to Dean.  “Wow, that was…fuck that was great.” Cas hummed his assent to that and they lay next to each other until Dean remembered he had drying come all over his stomach.  He grabbed some tissues to wipe up the mess.  When he was done he grabbed his discarded shorts, and maybe he was just copying Dean, Cas too found his boxers and put them on.  All the while neither of them said a thing.
“But our mom is alive,”  Now anyway, “her name’s Mary.”
“I was dying.”
“Well what do you want me to do? Sit together holding hands and watching rom-coms?”  Typical overcompensating, Sam took a deep breath because he wasn’t here to get into it with Dean.  “And what do you mean ‘I’ almost lost him?”
“No, I very much want to.”  Cas moved one of his hands so that it was holding the base of his dick.
“Fuck Cas.” Dean breathed against his lips when they pulled apart.  Cas hummed contentedly all the while running his hand up Dean’s back, over his t-shirt.  One of Dean’s hands was still grasping Cas’ lapel the other hand settled around his waist.  He felt good.  He couldn’t describe it, like a bright light was shinning out of him.  He suddenly remembered what Meg had said years ago after kissing Cas,
“You what, Cas?”
It obviously made him happy and all this without remembering who Can even was. “Yeah, he’s…” In for a penny in for a pound Sam thought, “he’s actually pretty handsome.”  Dean’s smile turned uncomfortably devious at that.
“No problem, we’ll get a few hours of shut eye, and I’ll give you a ride.”  Before Cas could say anything else, Dean was out of the car.
“I was, but…he’s fine, says he feels normal.  Whatever normal is for him.”  Dean huffs out a laugh eyes cast on the floor.  Sam decided to sit on the bed next to him.
“I don’t know that I do Sam.  You came in here with something to say, so why don’t you say it?”
Before he could finish unbuttoning, Cas distracted him with another kiss his hands pushing the edge of Dean’s shirt up to feel the skin underneath.  Dean lifted his arms allowing Cas to pull it off him before continuing his own task of undressing Cas.  He pushed him down on his bed when he finally got the last button undone.  He took a moment to drink in the sight before him. Dean’s gaze fell onto the space where he had seen the curse eating Cas away, he trailed his fingers along where the cracks had been.
“Yes I can see that.”
“Well…”  Maybe just stay to the basics for now. “Our dad, John, is dead.”
Then there was Cas’ confession.  If Sam were still wondering if the feeling between Dean and Cas were in any way one-sided, that killed it.
“Sam thinks you said it because you’re in love with me.”  Cas looked away then, that fidget of his when he knows he’s been caught lying.  “I mean, you know there’s a difference right?”
“I think you know what I mean Dean.”  Sam kept his tone as even as possible but it didn't help. Dean stood and crossed his arms defensively, while he stayed seated and tried to stay non-confrontational.
“I meant taking it easy.  Resting in your room maybe.”
“Isn’t that the point?”  Dean knelt on the bed again this time straddling Cas.  He adjusted himself until his cock was dragging against Cas’ causing the angel to groan and tip his head back.  Dean captured his lips again before explaining.
“So…if I wasn’t hurt you would have driven me back to the store?”
“Cas, stop.  Just stop for a second, ok?”
“What you told me when you were trying to get me to remember stuff.”  Now he was starting to look vaguely angry.
“What?” Cas’ hand was on his jaw now.  He dipped in towards Dean’s face, but stopped just short of his lips.  Dean thought it should have been harder to cross that millimeter of space, but in the end it was easy.
“He almost died Sammy,” Dean deadpanned, “yeah absolutely no danger there.”
When Dean’s memories returned to him he didn’t remember what had happened during the curse.  So Sam didn’t have to face Dean’s anger at being led to believe he and Cas were dating, but it sat uncomfortably in the back of Sam’s mind.  He could only remember how ok Dean was with the fantasy.  Not just ok, he had been happy to be in a relationship with the angel.  He knew it would go over about as well as keying the Impala, but Sam knew that he and Dean needed to have a talk, a real talk, about this.  If it was something that would make two of the three most important people in the world to him happy, it would be worth it to try.
“Keep fighting Bluebird, we are nearly there” Dean whispered rubbing circles with his thumb on Cas’ hand.
Lucifer continued thrusting into Cas' mouth, not letting Cas catch his breath. Cas felt his body shaking in fear, he felt the thrusts became stronger and heard Lucifer's moans became louder, Lucifer was close and Cas knew it. He felt a small bit of relief, knowing this all was about to come to an end. When Lucifer finally came he shoved his dick as far back into Cas' throat as he could. He kept one hand one Cas' head making sure it stayed in place. With his other hand he pinched Cas' nose blocking all of Cas' airways. Cas struggled more, trying to breathe. He felt his heart pounding and his lungs begging for oxygen. He felt Lucifer's cum was making it's way down the back of his throat. Even after Lucifer had finished cumming he continued to block Cas' airways. Cas would be crying if he could, instead it was just tears occasionally making their way down his cheeks. After a minute Cas felt himself going weak, black spots appearing in his vision. He looked up at Lucifer's face, seeing the pleasure Lucifer was getting, he was sure, he was sure he was going to die.
When Dean returned home to Lisa he instantly asked Lisa to marry him, she said yes as quickly as she could. She began to plan everything instantly and all Dean could think about was the broken look on Cas' face when he picked up the ring, Cas' face when he found out Lisa was pregnant. Him telling Dean to use the name Ben, Dean knew how much that must have hurt to say, it was a name they decided together and now it was going to be used for Dean and Lisa. Dean began to contemplate whether or not he should tell Lisa the truth, he knew that he had to marry her either way so he didn't see a point, so he was stuck with his stupid plan of marrying Lisa and wishing it was Cas. Dean and Lisa's wedding two months later, it was rushed but everyone kept saying it was a 'perfect' wedding.  Everyone but Dean, for Dean it wasn't, the one person he wanted to marry was at the back of the church.
Dean quickly threw on his pants and began to run after Cas, he felt terrible. Cas had warned him not to come, Cas told him what would happen but Dean didn't listen. Dean ran out the front door just in time to see Cas driving down the road at full speed, Dean fell to his knees with his face in his hands and began to cry, why was he so stupid? He loves Cas with all his heart, he would do anything for Cas. He knew he made the biggest mistake, knew Cas wouldn't be able to forgive him, knew Cas hated him.
Ben is born, Dean still loves Cas but is married to Lisa, Cas is moving away- so basically so much angst.
The doctor looked at Cas, sighing before he met Dean’s gaze. “We don’t know at the moment, but if I was to take a guess, I would say it’s most likely PTSD”. Dean felt chills spread across his body. He didn’t know how to react, so he just stared blankly, once again just nodding his head to what the doctor was saying. Occasionally catching a few words. “A plan ... he needs to feel safe ... takes time ...”. All Dean could focus on was Cas sleeping, wondering how he can help Cas and what he should.
When Cas woke he looked around the room, confused. He looked down at himself and saw he was naked on the bed, what had happened? He then turned his head as he felt something on his wrists, he had been restrained. For a moment he thought he must've fell asleep after a kinky session with Lucifer, then it all came back to him. Him agreeing to go with Dean, kissing Dean, watching Dean leave knowing later that night they would be in each other's arms. Lucifer finding out, Lucifer punching him and dragging him upstairs. Getting free of Lucifer's grip and then the feeling of his head hitting the wall. Darkness.
- 20 minutes earlier-
Cas couldn't take it anymore, he opened the door to find Dean kissing Lisa and thrusting into her. Dean looked up and saw Cas standing at the door with a broken expression on his face. Cas couldn't deny what he was seeing, that was definitely Dean, there was no way could say it wasn't. Cas felt his heart break and began to think he was going to be sick, tears were forming in his eyes, he couldn't look at Dean a moment longer, trying to understand what was happening. Cas shook his head slightly to bring him back to reality, he turned so he could begin to walk away. This was the moment his phone went off, Cas had set an alarm earlier so he could call Dean as soon as it hit 12 to wish him a happy anniversary. Cas looked at his phone, then back at Dean with tears falling down his cheek. "Happy anniversary, asshole". Cas turned around and began to walk away, tears were streaming down his face. Cas took a deep breath, whispering to himself with a broken, almost silent voice "Happy anniversary"
Dean’s sadness was clear in his voice, it laced every word.
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand squeezing it slightly, he felt Cas squeeze back, causing his to once again let out a breath of relief.
- One Year Later-

After they finished packing everything away it was 4:30, so Cas ran upstairs had a quick shower and they left for the dinner, Dean offered to drive but Cas was quick to point out that Dean didn't know where they were going and hadn't driven in another country before. They got into the car and drove to the restaurant, still occasionally laughing about the memories they had together, the amount of times Cas would tease him about his Dr Sexy addiction. The time Dean came home to Cas dressed as Dr Sexy waving around a stethoscope which ended up hitting him in the head. It was just like it was when they were together, the laughs, the jokes, the teasing, Dean felt like they were back together, felt like they never broke up, felt like they were still a happy couple.
"Cas, what Dean did, you can't forgive him, ever. Once a cheater always a cheater" Gabe said whilst moving to sit next to Cas. Cas nodded and lent on Gabe's shoulder. "I know, I never will" Cas whispered.
But they didn’t know that he was already with Cas in their shared Heaven.
Dean had resulted to sleeping on the couch, he didn't want to sleep next to Lisa after what she told him, he couldn't bare to look at her anymore. It was a cold winters night when Dean heard Lisa yell from upstairs, he opened his eyes slowly, unsure what was happening when he heard the yell again. "Dean! The baby's coming!" Dean shot up the stairs and ran to Lisa's room. Lisa was holding the side of the bed taking deep breaths, Dean grabbed the bags which they packed months ago, he helped Lisa into the car and then got in himself. Dean drove as quickly as he could to the hospital, he parked the car, ran in and got a wheelchair for Lisa, he helped her into it and then rolled her into the hospital, shouting for help. Nurses quickly took over and led Lisa to the delivery room. Lisa was in labour for four hours before Ben was born, he weighed 6lbs 7oz. The moment Dean saw Ben he had the biggest smile he could create, he rocked the crying Ben and hushed him, loving the feeling of having his son in his arms. Dean began to hum 'Hey Jude' like his mother did to him when he was younger, Ben slowly stopped crying, which warmed Dean's heart. "We need to stay together for him, Lisa" Dean whispered.
"Yeah, we met at a play, neither of us liked it, so we decided to go out for a few drinks, ended up back at his. Been together ever since" Their was a small smile of Cas' face which made Dean's heart hurt. "What's his name?" Dean asked halfheartedly not wanting to hear anymore, knowing it'd become too real otherwise. "Lucifer" Cas replied another smile appearing on his face.  Dean nodded and looked at the floor, trying to accept that Cas was happy with someone else, knowing he was too late to get with Cas, knowing that he might not be able to get back what they had in University.
The next thing Dean heard was footsteps.
“I’m coming to you Bluebird”
Cas closed his eyes as Lucifer began pulling his hips back so he could thrust further into him. Every thrust Lucifer took hit his prostate making him moan. He felt like his body was betraying him, he felt his hard dick rubbing against his skin, making him moan more. Lucifer grabbed Cas' dick and gave it two hard strokes, making Cas cum as he hit his prostate at the same time. Lucifer came moments later, filling Cas with his sperm. Lucifer pulled out and began to do this trousers up, making himself presentable for work. He looked at Cas smiling, the bruises, the blood, the sperm, to him Cas looked perfect like this.
