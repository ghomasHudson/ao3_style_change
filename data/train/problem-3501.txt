“Interested in little miss mascara and hair-dye over there?” She taunted, and even though I felt a small amount of pride for knowing that the lady’s hair had, in fact, been dyed, I shook my head no quickly, as if the speed would further imply my answer.
“You don’t think the lady and her husband’s eyes ever locked?” I inquired further, breaking the laugh Charlie found herself in the middle of that was causing her hair to fall into her face and set her blue eyes alight with a spurt of joy.
Perhaps it would’ve helped my case more if I hadn’t been able to identify Dean Winchester through Charlie’s horribly blunt nickname, but I could immediately pinpoint the very features in which she was speaking of-and yes, Dean Winchester had a fantastically stern jawline-but I was bound and determined to fight her implications and giggling jokes.
I went rigid, the glass held firm in my fingers until their tips ached with my grip’s strength, and I could feel her eyes like bullets aimed for the back of my head. My ears tuned in on her voice as she thanked a few customers sitting at a booth to my left when they got up to leave, the only noise interrupting her speech was the sound of their legs practically tearing from the seats’ surface, and I knew she’d seen me. I knew she could see Dean, sitting pretty and heartbroken and mysterious a few paces away from me, and I knew she could see the drink shining brightly in my clenched fist. And I myself knew that whatever chances I had left at proving her spot-on theory wrong had fluttered away, as delicate as the wings on a butterfly, and I cursed the butterfly effect theory as I walked back to my customer.
I drummed my fingers on the bar’s surface, considering what to say, what cards I should play next. It seemed as though he was just about done talking about his younger brother, so I decided that it couldn’t hurt to try to draw the conversation full circle and loop it back to him.
I shook my head the moment she ceased speaking, desperate to let her know that it was okay, fine, great, even, because even though her constant murmurings and sly smirks about Dean had made me want to rip my hair out piece by piece and strand by strand, they’d really helped me realize something. And, regardless of how ridiculous the something was, it meant a lot to me.
There was surely a snide edge to his words, sharp and sarcastic, a trait that he’d picked upon only recently and while I knew I was the sole suspect to blame, it still drove me crazy, and in a rush of muttered curse words and flushed faces and extremities, I snatched the blinds in both hands and pulled them tightly closed. My urgency and out of character embarrassment did little to stop Cas’s laughter of course, and he proceeded to mock me and my idiocy all while I threw on clean boxers and my usual uniform when traveling off to work: my “company-issued” pale blue button down, dark jeans, and the socks I found at the bottom of my drawer. I made an effort to ignore the deep, ocean eyes I knew were staring me down at that very moment, pretend as though their owner wasn’t in the same state of bareness I’d been in as I revealed myself to the world outside, but was failing miserably.
Throughout our discussion, Charlie’s blue eyes never left my own, and she seemed to thrive on the effect the gaze was having on my poise and stature. Internally it was crumbling to pieces, threatening to collapse in full at any moment if the awkwardness she’d flung into the air didn’t dissipate soon, but I managed to mask the destruction with a clenched jaw, trembling fingers, and a peculiarly level sound of voice. The drawbacks of being so close to Charlie were slim, but one was being enacted in that moment: she knew every quirk I possessed like it was written in black ink across my reddening forehead.
Cas faces sunk just as my spirits lifted even higher than they’d been all that morning, the horror and defeat in his expression oddly rewarding,
“It looks like something has upset you,” I announced. It was said more matter-of-factly than intended, but it got the point across. Everything about Dean’s outward appearance screamed inner turmoil; I was merely pointing out and observing what was obvious.
“Two: maybe I would be able to disregard number one, but just the other day we had an entire discussion about this same little predicament you got yourself mixed up in, all this Dean Winchester business, so now I know you’re full of it. You got feelings for the guy.”
I guess, in the end, my shirt-tucking job didn’t mean much, since I would have to redo it anyways momentarily, and my mind was very far from its state as a few shameful sighs were pushed from somewhere deep within my throat, a place that wasn’t supposed to make noise in the first place, as familiar fingers snaked their way underneath my button down’s fabric. They latched onto whatever skin they could find, sending goosebumps up my chest and back down my arms, and Cas’s breath still was reminiscent of the alcohol from the previous night, sharp and overwhelming to not only the taste but to the touch, and I wondered if it was still affecting his train of thought and logic.
It felt like I’d blinked and was now bent over, face next to the driver’s side window where Dean was, cheeks pink with the cold he was just now recovering from and eyes wide with astonishment, as he was probably wondering ‘why the hell that insane bartender guy was so keen on talking to me.’ But then I heard Charlie inside my head and watched my breath fog up Dean’s window until he got the message and rolled it down. With it came the last of my coherent thoughts. I was in unknown territory now, no longer in the safe, confining walls of the pub.
The tail end of Charlie’s retaliation sent me spinning, made me dazed, smacked me hard in the face and didn’t bother assisting me in getting up. Despite my minute form of admittance, the kind that I’d to mask with closure the night before, and despite the fact that I was aware, somewhere, that I did think of Dean differently than the other strangers I’d come to be acquainted with, I never thought others would notice so acutely, much less confront me about it.
“Uh, I think someone’s trying to get your attention, Cas,” Dean whispered to me, still staring at what was now a someone stationed out of my direct line of vision. In that moment, I would’ve bet a million bucks that this someone had red hair, tied in a bun, and was gawking at both Dean and I. But, just to make sure, I turned around slowly on my heels, like an elderly machine creaking to life, to get a look for myself.
“You two were reckless,” he interjects, a familiar venom on his tongue. “You wandered into a vampiric
Dean Winchester had been taught to lie for the greater good, the greater good that was his brother and those who existed in his kindred orbit. John made that clear and made the consequences even clearer. Sammy was not to be troubled if the trouble could be avoided. And there was a route out of this. Dean could see it splayed in the same shades of grey he’d swam through in years’ past.
“Anytime, dude,” Charlie replied and then quickly continued on her journey to the point of the conversation, a journey that was typically long and a little tiring on the listener’s part, but in that moment I wished that she would take all the time in the world.
But the ignorance Sam, and even myself had, was better than the fighting that ensued afterwards, better than the fighting taking place around me. I thought it all would fade away once Sam grew up, once he got past the fact that Dad was never truly going to be the father figure he deserved, but I realized that doing so was a tall order, one that Sam didn’t need to fill on his own, and that I was too weak to help him in. That’s why I’d kept feeding him that ignorance because it meant I could keep believing the lies too. It meant that I could keep lying to Sam because Dad had told me too, it meant that doing so was okay. It meant that Dad really was at work. It meant that Dad wasn’t wasted by six in the evening. And it meant that I could keep doing my job as Sam’s brother.
I would learn the story behind the rumble of his voice, the flecks in his eyes, the freckles along his cheeks, the silence in his bones, and the secrecy etched into his very programming no matter how long it took. The time limit I was usually confined to, one singular night, would not apply to this round of the game , which relieved the deal of stress losing would usually inspire and replaced it with fascination, excitement, and a fiery determination.
Of course it was. He was wearing a heavy leather jacket and a flannel shirt, and I’d come into work wearing my trench coat. Inside me, my mind winced and felt the red hot burn of embarrassment. It was an inexcusably stupid question, one that would most definitely cost me the night, if not my victory over Dean Winchester. I would be met with silence, cold and impenetrable silence, the lack of noise, the absence of sound, painful quiet-
Sam shouldn’t be there right now, he shouldn’t know that our dad was a drunk, he shouldn’t know about how shitty my life had been, or how I’d tried so hard to make sure his turned out better. He should be at Stanford and have the blurry faces of his brother and father in the back of his mind, taking up no more room than a distant, clouded memory, but instead he was there running his hands through his hair that I missed cutting and stressing out over all the things that I’d struggled to keep exclusively on my shoulders and my shoulders only.
“He just needed someone to listen to him, unbiasedly. That’s all, and that’s all I am to him. A listener. Nothing more.”
It appeared as though Dean spent a long time contemplating my statement, and perhaps he was wondering whether I was worth his breath or not. Of course, I was appalled when he simply acknowledged my existence and I expected next to nothing in return, but the curiosity had worn down my logic and sanity until nothing but dust remained, and I had to know. I couldn’t hold back the obnoxiously loud sound of my voice that was startling the singular person it was directed towards.
Sam left two days after Dad dropped out, saying he wasn’t in the mood to be trapped in another episode of “Family Feud: Drunk Edition,” and while I couldn’t blame him, it felt as though he was tearing open a wound that had just begun to heal upon his arrival. He promised me to stay in better touch nowadays though, and he delivered, after giving me his younger brother advice. According to Sammy, Dad did nothing for me, and if he was still at home he would physically force me away from his very entity. I didn’t doubt his ability to achieve this, because even though Sam was a bit lanky, he had a good two and a half inches of height on me, but I pushed his suggestion away as far as I could once he was gone on the jetplane, into the sky, and into his future success.
Even slurred and hardly distinguishable, his words sent rolls of fear up and down my spine and cemented my feet further into the hardwood underneath my shoes. Talking or explaining myself seemed out of the question at that point, and I realized this upon noting the dryness of my tongue and palette, so I left it up to Dean to continue the exchange. He’d started it, of course, and before long he delivered once more.
She was right...in her implications, at least. Judging by the sound of her voice, and the presence of those same undertones I’d spent the entire night replaying in my memory, there was more to her final argument than an outside eavesdropper could detect, but I understood. She knew there was more to my story and reasoning than I would ever let on, and suddenly I felt as though I was under the gaze of an X-ray machine, my insides lit up and open for the public to see, and she was reading me like a book. (I hoped to God that this wasn’t what those I spoke to at the bar felt like.) It was as if she’d been sitting feet away from me during my late night crisis, watching each of my layers peel back until we stumbled upon the false closure I’d held like a security blanket, and there was just no stopping her from seeing straight through that, as well.
Thirty-one minutes past eleven, my eyes snapped open from their unintentional and sleepy droop at a sound that threw me into sharp consciousness and attention. My fingers rubbed the excess tiredness from my eyes as they struggled to focus through the dimly lit scene around me, filled still with those moon beams and vacant of any other members of the usual, unpredictable human company, except for the towering figure that had just entered with footsteps creaking loudly on the hardwood and breathing stiff, complete with long strides and shoulders moving back and forth to each step.
Kevin looked at the keys for a long while, contemplating the awfully easy yes-or-no question, before nodding his head yes unsurely. I wished he’s just acted on that uncertainty, for with his choice to ignore it came one of the most embarrassing conversations I’d ever had until that point. And besides, Charlie had taken in the crates of pretzels upon her arrival approximately twenty three minutes ago, and seeing her struggle with them had been my only source of happiness for the entirety of that day.
Dean Winchester didn’t change or shift his line of vision until he’d reached his destination, perched himself heavily onto a barstool at the very far right corner of the bar, away from all other life forms, the motion earning a great, hefty creak from the chair’s structure, placed his hands on the counter, loosely folded, and let out the most minute yet poorly concealed sighs of what I hoped wasn’t despair that I’d heard pass his lips. I tried my hardest to reassure myself that everything was okay, feeling the quakes of a nervous terror bloom somewhere in that part of e that had accepted Charlie’s incessant theories, and would’ve been successful in doing so, had Dean’s head remained cast down and had I not dared to approach him in the way I was so obligated to do.
“I care about you, and I want to make sure you’re alright and well because it doesn’t seem as though you have many other people in your life that do.”
“Oh, Charlie told me to tell you she’s gonna be late today. She’s visiting family downtown I guess, but she’ll close up today. Said you’ve been doing it too much lately.”
I’d even failed Sammy then by leaving him to fend for himself in that hellhole of a home, a home that would be vacated by its current dweller in the next four weeks or so, and then this entire process would be repeated again, eventually, the difference being the fact that my younger brother may just have to do it alone. I couldn’t pinpoint what exactly it was that had made Dad’s words sting so much or what had made Sam’s defense of me so hard to listen to, but there was no way I was capable of putting myself through it again. There wasn’t much point. Obviously it was clear that I was a failure in my father’s eyes, I was letting my brother down once again at that very second, and the only other friend I thought I had had sat in almost full silence as I’d been torn apart.
“Aw, that’s a shame. Lemme me know if you’re ever interested in learnin’...cuz like I said I got one hell of a ride out there.”
“Guys!” I shouted, suddenly, using my last bit of courage on a single outburst to gain their attention. In an instant, Bobby, Sam, and my dad’s eyes all fell onto my figure, which had now risen fully out of my seat and was standing with both feet planted firmly on the floor below. To those who lacked an inside look at the workings of my quickly failing mind, one might think that I was about to resolve the situation, or perhaps ease the tension, reveal something of great worth and stature that could help everyone come to a consensus. But such an assumption couldn’t have been more wrong, and judging by the way Sammy was staring at me with eyes sadder than I’d seen in years, even sadder than the day he’d said goodbye to me and flown to the West Coast, he was not under any such impression. He just knew me too well.
And then she sent me on my way. She patted my shoulder, dipped her head in a way far too discreet and casual for the magnitude of the situation, and followed the path of the busboy that passed earlier without so much as a glance backwards in my direction. No reassurance, no encouragement, no support, nothing. I was a sole survivor trying to make it on an island, the last of a troop of soldiers, the last human alive in the apocalypse my previous customer had ranted so passionately about, and there was no other living soul in sight for miles and miles.
I nodded and stuffed the hopefully-clean-rag-now-soiled in the dirty laundry bin underneath bar and it landed with a resounding, damp and squishy thud.
“I’m glad you give me haircuts though, Dean. I don’t think Dad would be really good at them. Not like you are.”
Snip-snip. I decided to block out his complaints and his interview-like inquiries for the time being so I could concentrate. I didn’t need anyone remarking about my poor haircut job because the subject had been talking my ear off the whole time, but I could feel Sam’s searing hazel eyes stare at the top of my head in the mirror as I worked, probably searching for the answer he was looking for in my mere body language, in the way I stood, or the way I spoke. I’d long since concluded that he was one of the most observant people I’d ever known.
“Of course I’m not interest-” I retorted, temporarily oblivious to her intentions and the meaning behind her words.
I liked the smiling faces that Charlie typed out, usually to signal departure, and couldn’t get over the novelty of that colon and singular parenthesis. Kevin had once tried to explain to me that it was something usually done out of irony, or that sarcasm he was so fluent in, but when Charlie used it, it seemed genuine, so Kevin’s lesson went unused. I turned off my phone and slid it into the back pocket of my pants, feeling its weight pull down on my waistline.
No, I still don’t like the cold, chilly weather and I don’t particularly like going outside. The bland and bare trees outside aren’t magical to me, nor are they any kind of beautiful, and I still went just about mad hearing the same damn three Christmas songs play over and over again on every radio station the moment Thanksgiving had passed, but there had been additions to my life that made the treacherous season exponentially more enjoyable, and now there wasn’t a day throughout the entire year that I didn’t appreciate them. It was hard not to, if I’d ever bothered to try otherwise, since I saw them each and every day without fail.
My memory jumped back to the previous nights where I’d learned all there was to know about Sam Winchester and his relationship to his older and extremely different, in every sense of the word, brother, Dean. It had been made very clear to me that Sam had no intentions of keeping up with the few members of his family that he had, and Dean was very hurt by that (though that tidbit was one that I had to infer on my own.), so this latest revelation of news came as quite the surprise to me, especially since it seemed to have developed all in the twenty four hours we’d been apart.
“Don’t you guys close up ‘round 1 o’clock ‘er somethin’?” he reminded me, slurring slightly over his words.
Dean’s outlook on the task ahead, the task of meeting his brother once more with his estranged father for the first time in two years, had increased in positivity, at least somewhat. Otherwise he wouldn’t have been so open with the worries and his nerves, regardless of whatever sort of mundane poison was running its course through his system. The relief of having let go of those pent up feelings could be seen in every crease of his skin, in every rise and fall of his chest, and in every quick, yet meaningful glance the two of us often caught ourselves in the middle of. It was an accomplishment that I allowed myself to feel pride in.
It stung some out of practice nerve to hear her relay her story to me, choked breath and all, and I found myself bent over the bar to hear her whispers. She certainly did not look the type to have such a broken spirit (when she arrived in the pub, I didn’t expect her to say much to me at all. Her attire made her look very intimidating.), but there was a lot of pain hidden under her heavy hair and her several layers of clothing and cosmetics. The pain was so fierce that I couldn’t help but feel it too. And when she’d reprimanded herself for spending her money on cheap drinks and cigarettes, I couldn’t help but do her a favor.
“There’s a whole helluva lot of people out there in the great wide world and we’re lucky enough to meet them all in here, when they’re at their lowest. If you’re even luckier, you get to meet someone here that is more special than the rest, that means something to you even where they’re in such a shitty state. You should keep an eye on that someone...maybe even slip ‘em your number on a napkin, if you know what I mean…”
“Dean seems...alone. He doesn’t tell people much about his life or what he’s going through at all, so I believe he’s simply confiding me to get a lot of his emotions and anger off of his chest, and not without the help of a couple drinks.”
“Thanks Dean,” Bobby said, and while I would’ve been far more reluctant to agree to his slightly painful request, the things Bobby had done for me over the years far outweighed four extra hours of work, so I held my tongue, much like Cas was holding my hips loosely in both of his hands, staring blankly at the very uninteresting ceiling.
“So many different kinds of people come through people with a lot of stories that are all their own. Sad stories mostly, but stories nonetheless,” I began, feeling meaningful words dance around on the edge of my tongue as some sort of send-off. “I’ve found that the best way to feel more at ease about those stories is to share them with an outside source, free of judgement or bias. It helps get things off of your chest.”
I liked Amelia the best. Gabriel had a girlfriend when he was eighteen named Amelia, who had long blonde hair and a smile you would find on a toothpaste commercial, with a laugh to match. Once Gabriel and her had ended over what he told me was “a silly, dumb as shit misunderstanding that someone created to get back at me from some fuckin’ thing that I didn’t do,” he left. He called me a few times a month to make sure I was staying in school, not doing drugs or drinking too much, but he also kept me posted on his risky attempts to make it in Boston, and I guess someone found his voice iconic enough to stick it on a radio wave for mass amounts of people to hear. When he forgot to call, I found the radio station, listened through the static and the strained connection, and pretended like he was speaking to me directly. Apart from the poor signal, it was just as good as his used-to-be routine phone conversations. He was just as funny.
So, was he to hold his own teeth responsible, given their current state? How could they keep back the lies when gurgles of ichor bubbled in his throat and stained their whitish enamel rubicund?
“I just...wanted to say that I’m sorry for the other day. I unloaded a lotta shit on you, and that sure as hell wasn’t fair. Hell, I hardly know you and now you’ve got all my problems swimming around in your head…”
The heat erupting along my face stung, such that it restricted my ability to speak, and all I could croak out was a weak yet overwhelmingly sincere and meaningful
“Ah yes, Castiel. Sorry about that, sometimes when some good ol’ liquor gets in my system, I can get pretty weak in the memory department!”
. Never have. I don’t think I ever will. I don’t get how you’re everywhere you’re supposed to be and everywhere you’re not. I don’t get how you’re never gone. I don’t get the way you see the world, even though I want to. I don’t get how much you care. I’m jealous of it, actually. And I really don’t get why it’s me for you. I never, not even…
“And when he started talkin’ about goin’ all the way out to Stanford, I tried to level with him, explain to him how god-damn impossible it is to get into a lawyer-and-doctor mine field like that, but he still wanted to try. Hell, he clung to the idea of gettin’ in there and moving away.”
Now, in the present time, I had found myself rather attached and interested in a girl of twenty two who had long, dark dreadlocks in her hair and who smelled fiercely of cigarettes and tears. The scent was fitting: she had a cigarette near its end in her left hand and her right hand was busy drying her eyes, smearing her deep purple makeup in the process, and I couldn’t help but feel my stomach lurch with sympathy at the sight of her. After merely one drink she’d had no trouble telling me the source behind her trembling lip and drippy eyes. She’d just been fired from her job as a secretary and it was the only source of income she had to support her younger sibling, for their father had abandoned them after their mother died tragically in a car accident.
I shot up from my slouched position, my own elbows leaned up against the bar in a fashion similar to Dean’s though I doubted I carried the same charisma, and waddled over to his own and otherwise vacant area to supply him with more of his drink that he seemed to so desperately need.
“I counted on you. I relied on you. Yeah, I’m sorry if moving around was hard, if you guys wanted to eat more than fuckin’ cereal every day, but I tried so hard-”
I chalked up my passiveness and lack of will to the exhaustion I was feeling, like a weight tied to my ankles that slowed me down with every step I trudged through, and the burning of my eyelids told me I’d certainly overworked myself. Even my head, which was more often than not buzzing at an unhealthy rate of seventeen miles anyway, seemed bogged down, sleepy, and drained, throbbing with the excess information it had been stuffed with that night. But no matter how helpful it would’ve been to expel some of it, I didn’t. I just couldn’t. Especially not when the newly acquired anecdotes and stories had been told to me through the words of Dean Winchester.
“Are there more of them? Usually vampires congregate in immense numbers. You know this, of course. I counted seven in the barn alone. We should check out the premises before –”
Two lips, the shade of not-yet-bloomed tulips, turn to Dean. If he looks down, he sees a loose collar and an even looser tie, royal blue and twisted, framed by khaki lapels and undone enamel buttons. Beside the pair of lips are two sagging cheeks, signs of age inexplicable, dotted with brown stubble; atop the cheeks and to the right and left are ears that twitch upon impact, and Dean notices a slice running down one lobe. He remembers thumbing it and inquiring about its origin. The dam of tension swelling in Dean’s throat breaks.
Every so often, between my gazes at Dean, which he returned by shooting me a similar, sympathetic look that mixed rather unsuccessfully with his poor mood, I glanced briefly at the clock and watched as the eleven o’ clock hour dwindled away, as well as the swell of people. Soon the bar was far less crowded, and those who still remained by fifteen minutes past midnight were on their last few drinks of the night, the limit drawn by myself, because despite my thorough observation of them, I still could tell when they needed to be cut off. The last thing I needed was someone coming down with alcohol poisoning and completely ruining the night for good.
I locked my knees in place as to stop them from moving before answering, trying to regain whatever casual edge I’d possessed earlier, before Dean had become so uncharacteristically talkative and involved.
“But...shit, I couldn’t keep him back forever. He knew you were full of it from the day he turned, what, eight years old? How was I supposed to keep him in the dark about you? About Mom?” I pleaded. There wasn’t a shift in my dad’s eyes, and I nearly marveled at the way even his wasted self could maintain such a fatherly glare. Eventually, I simply took it as a sign to continue and not stop until I’d finished my entire piece.
“Oh...heh, thanks…” He murmured once the newly replenished beverage had been returned to him. And I suppose I was still a little high off the conversation, off of the memories that were just beginning to forcefully fade away, or off the discreet but nonetheless present complement my companion had handed me with impeccable ease and casualness, because I couldn’t bother giving Dean the trouble of paying.
“We are closing,” I admitted, motioning towards the wall clock above both of our heads with a wave of my head. Dean’s eyes followed lazily.
“Oh, is that so?” he taunted, but I could see him unbuckle his seatbelt with a dull click before continuing,
She must’ve seen him. Judging by the way her eyes fell still and her face contorted into that of a smirk, one that left me painfully nervous, she had a head full of assumptions and wonders that I could surely do without. But that didn’t mean that I wouldn’t be subject to them anyways.
Dean chuckled weakly, the sound very dissatisfying in comparison to what one of his true laughs must sound like, and shook his head no in that damned kind of denial that sent chills of frustration and worry coursing through me. He was never this casual and this defeated in his troubles; he was supposed to be angry and fired up, but this was something else entirely.
She gave me one last smile, one that I imagined should be in sample photographs for picture frames it was so bright and plainly cheerful, before I was pulled forcefully from the peaceful reality of conversation by a ring from the opposite end of the pub. It was an iconic ring, one that sent more chills up and down my bare arms, but these chills weren’t out of worry. They were out of knowledge, of the sure feeling that someone of import had entered the bar.
I cleared my throat to alert him that I was there and ready to engage in conversation with him, but the action earned me no acknowledgment or reciprocation, so I merely carried on with my usual procedure.
But maybe Charlie was right. Maybe they had happily slid into that stage a long time ago. That stage that involved that four letter L word that…
"I love you too Dean," Cas says, with the biggest smile on his face. With their true feelings finally said, Dean feels the nervous thoughts of doubt cut loose from his mind forever. At this new feeling of freedom and love, Dean simply grins and kisses the heck out of Cas.
Fortunately, Cas was getting better at recognizing when Dean’s mind started racing faster than he could keep up. He goes back to meet Dean half way and gives his hand a squeeze, which instantly brings Dean back to a familiar feeling of safety and calm. It's the same sort of feeling Dean gets when he's hanging out with Charlie, or when his mom would sing to comfort him. Cas didn't usually sing, but he didn't have to for Dean to feel it.
“Charlie’s gay. I'm…”  It wasn't that Dean was ashamed of his sexuality anymore. But it had only crossed his mind at this point that Cas could very well be straight and might feel weird about it. His jealousy caused him to assume there was a relationship happening between Gabriel and Cas, but now he felt that he was being delusional.
Dean had two options at this point. He could go home after school and have what he would call a typical “chick flick” moment. Eat a whole tub of Rocky Road and cry about how his pitiful crush refused to see him. Or he could say “fuck it” and wait outside of Cas’ office, like the lame love-sick puppy that he was, to finally talk to him.
It still made him feel incredibly nervous and shy when complete strangers came up to compliment his talent. But it also did wonders in stroking his ego. Sam, who basically came to every performance, always said with a smile and a playful eye roll, “Great, now you’ll
His hopes continue upward by the time they reach the tomato farm. Forty minutes surely was enough time for Cas to come to his senses and be in a better mood. It would have been a real bummer if they went on this hour-long tour without talking at all... But as soon as Cas stepped off of the bus, he brushed past Dean without a second glance. Dean's jaw clenches a bit as Charlie hops off shortly after.
“Please excuse my husband,” Kali sighs. “He gets quite excited when Castiel shows signs of having a social life.” Castiel appears at the top of the stairs, wearing blue plaid pajama bottoms and a gray and red AC/DC shirt. This outfit made Cas look like a completely different person. Less put together and maybe a little more disorganized then he presented himself to be. A warm feeling grows in Dean’s chest as Cas quickly trots down the stairs.
“GoodnightDean!” Cas sputters quickly and all but runs away. Dean stares at the empty space and blinks a couple more times. Then… it hits him… He sprints after Cas.
“Would you ever do acting stuff again?” Dean asks Cas on their drive home. He was still thinking about the show and the question had crossed his own mind once or twice. Honestly, he wasn’t quite sure how he’d feel about being on stage again. But maybe if Cas was there with him again...
"Yes.”  The silence falls heavy between them. “After I was informed that I was being transferred from my first school, it was Gabriel who told me that Mrs. Butters was retiring and that I should request to come here. It’s thanks to him that I received the position in the first place."
teacher. And she was on the hunt for a leading man to play the antagonist for the all school musical.
"Nice," is all he can say, with a genuine grin. When Cas smiles back at him, Dean has to fight the urge to grab his face and kiss him at that moment. He compromises with a thumbs up.
“Very hands on,” Cas comments before Charlie and the students cheer at finally succeeding. “Perhaps that’s the different approach I need to--oh God.” Dean is confused at the response until he looks to the front. While some students were covering their eyes and screaming, other students joined Charlie’s uncontrollable laughter at the sight before them. Gabriel strutted around the front of the stage in his designated police costume. Aviator glasses, a tan button-up shirt with a badge pinned on… and extremely short shorts. Dean snorts in laughter.
“Got it. So you’re just going to have them grow a bunch of daisies for their final project or something?”
Dean can hear the cast begin to sing the chorus that leads into Dean’s first solo, but his eyes stayed on Cas. The other man’s smile never falters and he mouths another “breathe” for good measure.
“Alright,” he finally says with a small smile. “I… I would really appreciate your help again.” With his brain now
“Sounds good,” Dean smiles, which grows even wider when Mr. Novak smiles back at him. After about the third flip his stomach makes, Dean coughs and glances up at the classroom’s clock. “I still have fifteen minutes before I’ll need to head back. But I can come help again after school is out.”
“Easter huh?” Dean chuckles and turns the wheel with one palm. “Sounds like this might have been an upgrade then.”
“In some cases,” Cas interjects. “If a plant is receiving too much sun, it can cause the leaves to burn. But then the leaves would turn brown and crisp.”
"Scared that I'm going to fail again. Scared that I'm just kidding myself and not actually going to be good at this. Scared that I won't actually make a difference to these kids. Still scared… that I'm not good enough…" Cas moves his hand away from Dean's arm and covers his face with it. A moment later, he hears a small sniffle.
“I think so?” Dean shields his eyes from the lights suddenly changing colors. “I mean… I told you I had started singing around Cas more so that’s a start.”
“Thank you,” Cas mumbles with a slight blush. “I could always… attempt to make one for you as well, if you’d like.”
“I got this Dean-o,” Gabriel, the mythology/English teacher, swooped in to the rescue and Dean watched in envy as Mr. Novak followed Gabriel for the tour.
“No! I mean… maybe I’m mad at myself because I…”  His smile falls into a frown as the words get stuck in his throat again. Cas waits but nothing comes out of Dean’s mouth. “Words... don’t freaking work when I’m around you, ok?” He slides his hands down from Cas’ shoulders to his hands. “It drives me friggin nuts but...yeah…”
“It’s called artistic liberties,” Charlie says in a pompous tone. Dean chuckles at that and then looks at the script rolled up in his jacket. He reaches over to retrieve it. A smile of fondness grows on his face as he thumbs through the pages and reads the notes written for himself in pencil. The smile grows even wider at a particular page where he and Cas had a mini doodle war. Cas had won by drawing a chubby cow shouting “QUACK!”
Unfortunately, Winchester sickness protocol is only helpful when used at the correct stage of the sickness. Cas’ body had already dived into the “chicken soup and lemon tea” zone of sickness during his teacher-parent meeting. Just like Sam after his law school finals week, Cas had strained his body so much that he had to call in a substitute to properly recover. And Dean missed him terribly.
“He didn’t say,” Dean sighs. “But if you want to try to talk to him, go right ahead.” He suddenly remembers something. “You know when a good chance to talk to him would be? During the field trip on Tuesday.” Charlie grimaces. “Oh come on, I thought you liked nerd stuff.”
Yesterday was grade check day for the students playing lead roles. After a few other loud complaints from a certain Biology 1010 student, Dean had a pretty good guess now as to who this student was.
sang in front of a large audience and the thought alone terrifies him. Yet his stupid crush is convincing his mind that it won’t actually be so bad. Just a few hundred people staring at him for a couple of hours in exchange for the chance to
“H-Hey Cas,” he tries to keep his tone even and not guilty sounding at all. He takes note that Cas seemed to have hastily thrown on some bright yellow crocs on his feet and a tan oversized trench coat. “D-Did I forget something?”
“Yep,” Dean lies and tosses the papers into the trash. “Exactly that.” Cas nods thoughtfully and soon they go back to their seats and pick up their grading material again.
“Especially if they do things that make you uncomfortable. Like… I don’t know, wear booty shorts even though you told them not to.”
“Yeah,” Dean swallows as he gets ready to burst his bubble. “Yeah they’ll figure it out and just take pictures to use as cheat references for later.” The other teacher groans again and buries his face in his hands. Dean clicks his pen slowly as he tries to work through the answer key for grading.
“Do you regret it?” Cas asks. Dean looks at him with a slight head tilt. “You sounded amazing of course--” Dean mutters a bashful “thanks” at the compliment. “--but I know it was still a struggle for you. So… Do you regret doing the show?” Dean puts a finger to his chin in thought.
It was near impossible for Dean to pretend to be asleep after that. A few students came up to ask what was going on, but were quickly sent back to their seats by the bus driver’s yelling. Dean then had to assure the students that everything was fine, but he could tell they didn’t believe him. Fortunately, Garth didn’t go into more dental stories, but the conversation wasn’t necessarily helping to ease Dean’s worry.
crash into the other teacher. “My friend Dean here has a free period so he should be able to take my place!”
“I knew Charlie wasn’t going to let me anyways,” Gabriel shrugs. “But it was still fun! Come on! Feel, feel, feel!” Gabriel doesn’t wait for Cas to answer. He simply takes Cas’ hand and rubs it up and down his own leg. Dean bristles at the gesture.
“So, anyways,” Dean clears his throat and makes his way to the trash bin. “Nothing’s ever gonna happen between me and Charlie. And before you go off and guess I have a crush on Lisa or Mr. Donatello or some other teacher--” The risk of Cas guessing his pointless crush correctly was still there. “--I don’t actually hate singing. I just don’t like singing in front of big groups. It makes me nervous as hell. But Charlie needed some help.”
“I doubt many of you had to transfer from your very first school due to excessive complaints however.”  Dean looks on with sympathy at his crush. “Gabriel had assured me that this school could be my fresh new start but it’s becoming apparent that history is about to repeat itself.” Admittedly, Dean feels himself click his pen a little
"Just give it some time," Charlie whispers as they get closer to some students. "And don't worry, I'm still working through the layers."
Dean had almost forgotten just how big the school was. Or maybe it was the fact that his legs felt like jello that made him think the school was so big. He hums some Metallica to himself and clicks his trusty red grading pen as he walks down the now empty hallways. While his classroom was located near the front of the school and near the main entrance, the agricultural classroom was on the other side of the school and then some.
To get to the bus loading zone they have to drive half way through the parking lot, and that’s time that Dean could be using to get to his car. He almost asks the bus driver to just stop right there, but he wasn’t sure if they were in a friendly mood after shouting at kids to sit down. That, and he might have come off as a bit desperate. He did also have 40 students on the bus that he needed to keep calm and pretend things were fine after all. Nevertheless, he couldn’t help himself from looking around and trying to plan out the quickest route to his car. Half way through the parking lot and after narrowing his route options, Dean suddenly sees a familiar face. Just sitting in the back of a pick-up truck like she hadn’t suddenly vanished into thin air.
It was a condition that Charlie always followed through with during her shows. Students who were casted were required to have a minimum 3.0 GPA through the duration of rehearsals. If they were unable to keep that GPA minimum, they would be out of the show. She told them it was a sort of practice for when these kids went out into the real world and would have to learn how to keep the theater and other responsibilities balanced. In all actuality, she had admitted to Dean that it was to reduce the angry parent phone calls. In her own words, “the arts and myself aren’t paid enough to deal with the constant blame game.”
“I allowed the students to leave a few minutes early,” Mr. Novak explains as he joins him shortly. “So I got a bit of a head start. This is a copy of the answer key. Do you need a pen?”
Dean opens his mouth to agree, but something in his mind panics and he blurts out instead, “Or with Charlie. She likes space stuff too.”
“I… I suppose I’ll grade them on a curve,” he mutters. “Take the lowest and highest scores and grade them from there.”
would be the perfect time to kiss. He knows it. A part of him wants to argue that it was still rather unclear if Cas felt the same way or not, but they were (kind of) holding hands for Pete’s sake! And Dean just worked through his insecurities and fears of singing in front of complete strangers. He could handle the anxiety of the unknown of how Cas felt. And what better way to let things known than with--
Dean let out a loud “FUCK!” before whipping his head towards his driver’s window. A stern looking Cas stood on the other side, pointing a finger downward to the ground. Dean gulps and opens the door. The shocked look on Cas’ face made Dean realize that he was probably motioning for the window to be rolled down instead of wanting Dean to come out of the car...
“Hold your horses,” Dean says, pulling out his phone. “Let’s see what Cas has to say about that.” He notices that Claire and Jack share a look, but decides to ignore it as he texts out their current situation to Cas. Cas sends a small list of instructions, mainly to lock up the greenhouse with the keys he had left him and take the cashbox to the administrative office. Dean frowns as Cas suggests that he’ll just head home.
"Thank you," Cas smiles a bit. "But I have been told that I have a bad habit of rambling when I become nervous. Which seems to be a continual problem when I give my slideshow presentations. It has left students completely confused at times, like today when I begin explaining a plant's decomposition process."
“It’s not that hard to say it,” he growls to himself. Then with each bump to the steering wheel, he grumbles, “I love you. I love you. I love--”
After a full week, Cas returns. Due to his own teaching schedule Dean wouldn’t be able to go see Cas until after school. But hey, good things come to those who wait anyway. Twenty minutes after school was over, since his schedule was like that, Dean was making his way down the hall and to the familiar classroom. Goodbye crusty old sub, hello sweet beautiful Cas!
Rehearsal wasn’t quite what Dean expected. Though, if he were being honest, he had no idea what to expect anyways. As soon as they did a quick roll call, Charlie sent the students in the ensemble off to learn musical parts while she had the main cast read through the script. Fortunately, there was no singing yet. Unfortunately, Dean was becoming more and more overwhelmed with each page and song that they got through. As soon as they get to the intermission and Charlie calls for a break, Dean jumps up and thrusts the script into her face.
“Yeah well it’s not fun for us teachers either,” Dean grumbles. “We’re supposed to be the ones in charge.”
that sounded. Days before they went on their planetarium date, Dean practiced asking the question any chance he got. Cas hadn’t even said hello before Dean just blurted it out. To Dean’s joy, Cas agreed. They still hadn't quite dropped the "I love yous," yet, but Cas continued to assure Dean that his actions let him know.
“My brother picked me up,” she says, motioning towards her brother who had previously been searching for something in the truck. “Family emergency.”
“Yep!” Dean says and quickly stands. “Anything for my lovely wife.” Fake wife actually, seeing as Charlie had casted the history teacher to play Dean’s wife. He winks and offers his arm to her.
No… no, Dean can say it now. He can say it because he can feel it. Looking at Cas, he knows it without a doubt left in his mind.
“Really?! You mean it?!” Charlie’s eyes become the size of dinner plates and they sparkle with excitement when Cas nods. “Oh my God that would be awesome! Thank you! I promise now that I totally won’t complain during the field trip. Even if it is going to be an hour full of stinky chickens…”
“What?” he would ask. Dean would reply with a quick, “nothing” or a random pop culture reference which never failed to make Cas roll his eyes and keep going.
It takes Dean a total of three seconds to realize that Cas was kissing him. Cas had smashed his lips against Dean’s open mouth so he could feel dried lips on his teeth very well. Just as Dean’s about to lift his hands to do… something… the lips are gone, along with the two hands on the side of his face. Dean stares up at an incredibly tensed up Cas. The once determined tiger now looked like a terrified wet kitten.
thinking about the kids Charlie,” Dean huffs and continues making his way down the hall and to his classroom. “Don’t you think it’s weird to be including adults in the show?”
“I don’t really blame you,” Dean says with a shrug, which causes another gentle hand bump. “A lot of teachers think that I have it easier since there’s another professor doing the heavy lifting. I’m more like the Longbottom when it comes to which teacher matters more.”
you!” Charlie drops to her knees and clasps her hands together in a praying motion. “I know you can act! You go larping with me every summer at Fantasy Fest! And now I find out you can sing? And sing
“...yeah but Sammy might be,” Dean sighs and closes the script. “I should have known better than to tell him so soon.” He scratches at a weird brown stain that had been on the cover of the script since he first got it. “And anyways… it feels a little hypocritical if I’ve been telling Cas not to quit something he’s good at and then turn around and do the exact same thing.”
“Well, don’t be afraid to use some of this frustration with Cas too,” she adds. Dean blinks up at her as she walks out of the room. “Just push play whenever you’re ready!”
“I’m so proud of you Cassie,” Gabe sniffles and wipes a fake tear away from his eye. “I knew you had it in you.” Cas buries his face into Dean’s chest. Kali comes to the rescue by grabbing Gabe by the shirt collar and dragging him away.
“Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!” Charlie squeezes him a little tighter with each “thank you.” When Dean lets out a soft gagging sound is when she finally lets go. “Ok, so rehearsals start next week. We’ll read the script and then basically split the rehearsals between the students and the adults. Anytime the ensemble goes off to learn music or dance choreography, we’ll do the blocking and scene work for the adults with some of the leads. When the kids are working on scenes, you guys can work on the music and stuff.”
“I didn’t. My counselor signed me up because she said it would be an easy class.”  Dean bites back a groan by taking a sip from his mug. It’s an all too common story. Counselors sort of liked to guess what classes sounded the easiest just so a student had a full schedule. “But whatever. At least Mr. Novak offers a buttload of extra credit. I can easily get a B in the class without having to pay attention for the rest of the semester.”
“May I ask you something Dean?”  Dean looks up from the current quiz he was grading, a bit surprised that Cas had initiated conversation. The agriculture teacher faced the grueling task of reading about a hundred student essays by midterms. Not wanting to cancel their little meetups, Dean had promised to keep his chatterbox closed for the day so Cas could focus. It was difficult at first, but it was either bite his tongue or not get to spend more time with his pointless crush. And while his mug full of Coca-Cola provided useful for these trying times, Dean welcomed the break with a sigh of relief.
He paused and finished off his drink in one foul swoop, and maybe I would’ve watched the way his long, scruff-dotted throat contract as he swallowed the liquid, but I was too busy gazing miserably at the flush of color in his cheeks, not brought on by the alcohol, and the crestfallen look of pure dejection in his eyes, and I imagined an old slideshow playing back in his mind of those shout-fests. I needed to stop asking, I needed to close up the conversation for his sake, but that thought didn’t occur to me fast enough and didn’t arrive in time to prevent me from uttering something I deemed immediately afterwards as completely unforgivable.
“I should’ve touched on the familiarity” I thought as I scrambled to find the supplies for his drink, and even its simplicity was not enough to dull my nerves and stop my eyes from flying back and forth. The bottle shook within the grasp of my right hand and I struggled to hold the glass still with my less dominant hand, probably earning yet another judgmental stare and another clenching of jaw. Eventually though the liquid had been poured, the drink had been served, and I was busy contemplating my next move and analyzing the very way in which Dean breathed.
Charlie had arrived, cheeks red with an excess of drink, and her arm was flung loosely around Kevin’s shoulders as she made her arrival known. Kevin smiled, a small version of the expression, before continuing his furious sweeping and taking a few steps backwards. Charlie’s bright eyes then proceeded to scan the pub until their gaze touched down on me and the man whom I was in dangerous proximity to, and I saw the light of recognition dawn in her pupils.
Dean’s expression changed, the corners of his mouth drawing upward into a sad sort of halfway-there grin, but instead of the small indication of happiness inspiring the same sort of emotion within me, it brought a secondhand kind of nostalgia, and I knew Dean was imagining Sam explaining to him just what he was interested in doing with his life. I imagined that his older brother was one of few people that Sam was able to confide in.
“This one’s on the house,” I added passively. If humor didn’t work, maybe common decency would spark an interest?
Which is why I made the next move, as usual, and prompted Dean to speak once more. I believe one could compare the situation to an unsure animal being lured slowly outside, into an unrecognizable environment, except Dean was no such thing, and there was pain within him instead of simple fear of the unknown.
I had to get through that day though, and upon reaching my favorite method of transportation, her surface shining and freshly cleaned after I’d given her the usual hand-cleaning at Bobby’s, I concluded that it wasn’t so bad. Driving to Bobby’s to work on cars all day wasn’t too bad, eating lunch with the best father figure I’d ever had wasn’t too bad, and driving no more than fifteen miles to Castiel’s place of work as often as possible wasn’t too bad either. In fact, when I thought about it, as I drived out of the parking garage, waving to a few familiar faces as I went, probably halfway recognizing their features from the pub, this life was exponentially not as bad as it had been just over a year ago, and that was a thought that could get me through the next twenty five years, let alone the upcoming few hours.
But that was the Friday night shift, one that I found dry and rather boring. Thursday night I reserved for the excitement it brought and so I could take note of each and every newcomer I saw. I had something of a mental notebook swirling within my head with the pictures and names and sentences of those I’d been lucky enough to come in contact with, their statements, uttered in their most intoxicated forms, all written in my scrawled lettering, and I loved getting the chance to update it. I thought of those Thursday night lurkers as those who were truly troubled in life, such that they couldn't hold out just one more rendition of twenty-four hours to burst into the bar and drink away their problems, and in turn ended up being the most quirky of characters.
“Well then what is it? You’re not gonna get off that easily, Castiel!” She exclaimed, suddenly jumping up and down on her feet, but not before we both heard a third party enter the room from the kitchen whilst tying a spotless apron around his waist. He, being Kevin, had obviously taken it home to be washed for the fifth time that week.
“A guy I met at the bar…”I stated, quite matter-of-factly, and then instantly played my sentence back in my head and grimaced. My dad, not understanding nor attempting to understand the magnitude of the conversation, threw his head back and laughed a laugh that used to drive me crazy.
But, the feeling of being rude and hurtful towards one of my closest friends trumped the sense of betrayal, if only for a short while, and I found myself shaking my head no in reply.
Again, I made note of the humor in his tone and I let it fill me up with a warmth that I knew for a fact that it shouldn’t be feeling, but I was in the middle of a conversation about not suppressing things and I wasn’t about to be hypocritical.
“It’s just that...he doesn’t get it. He ruined our lives, really. We never lived in one place. We never stopped. We never took a breather.”
I was confused by that statement, the emotion made visible by my habitual turn of my head to the left. Charlie caught the action and grinned yet again, amused by my lack of understanding but she explained her reasoning, thankfully.
There was no space in my head to even consider any other attributes of Dean other than his troubles and the reasons behind his broken mind. I couldn’t enjoy the starkness of his cheekbones, the fire in his eyes, hot like the burn of whiskey that I struggled to down, his lean middle, or strong, fit legs because I was too busy imagining how heated the exchanges between him and his father were, imagining how it must’ve felt to be called useless by the one man who’s supposed to love you unconditionally, imagining what it’s really like to have beer bottles shatter at the walls around you, the walls that are supposed to make up your home.
I thought my reply was perfectly acceptable, perfectly understandable and okay. I was doing Dean Winchester a favor while attempting to win that game that I was still obsessing over, and I couldn’t see a single thing wrong with that, but Charlie’s look made me feel like I was the odd one out, like I was committing some irreparable social sin that was too scandalous to speak aloud.
I highly doubted my father had met someone quite like Castiel Novak. There was no way in hell he’d gotten onto good terms with the socially awkward, fantastically observant, and just plain old gentle blue-eyed, dark haired bartender who appeared to have some inexplicable interest in listening to my problems. I couldn’t imagine my own dad confessing more about his life to this stranger-become-circumstantial friend than he ever had to anyone who wasn’t there to experience it firsthand along with him, and I couldn’t imagine this someone could’ve taken it as well as Castiel Novak did with me. It was impossible that my own father had felt the same way I had when Cas had spoken such heartfelt words to me, the way my own blood-pumper had increased its speed tenfold, or that my dad could’ve thought about his eyes or the funny, forever curious expression that appeared on his face every waking hour.
“Damn it, Cas, what am I supposed to say to that?” He exclaimed, nudging his glass dangerously towards the edge of the bar and instinctively both of our hands shot forward to save it, and we brushed more than just knuckles, and we lingered just a little longer than before, and I’d studied enough awkward exchanges in my time to know the significance of the one I was currently caught voluntarily in the middle of.
“Where...where did that room go, then?” I said, voice shaking and eyes barely able to make feasible contact.
Before I could even process the magnitude of what I’d just heard and before it really made it past the front of my very eardrums, Sam had run to the line of fire. His words were hot and molten as they spewed from his mouth and flew forward at such a rate that I had to abandon my analysis of Dad’s words. I didn’t have the time to understand what he’d meant, how he apparently thought I influenced Sam for the worse, and tried my best to keep up with the continued exchange as it grew increasingly more heated.
There was one last “act of intimacy” before I started his car, marveling in the appearance of Dean’s car and the fact that I was inside it under such circumstances as I did so, and we were driving to wherever it was he dwelled, my companion spewing haphazard directions as we went and I struggled to follow them accurately, but he didn’t seem to mind, so neither did I. The sound of snow touching down lightly against the windshield, Dean’s gentle breathing, and a startlingly familiar REO Speedwagon song playing from the radio was enough to keep me joyously occupied for hours upon hours, and I didn’t care if we ever reached Dean’s house.
I believe that, at some point and after much too long of a silence, I opened my mouth again to speak, sew together some weak thread of a response upon impulse, but the sound of the back door creaking noisily open startled the both of us out of our words and my head turned sharply to the right. I wasn’t sure whether to be relieved of the pretzel-hunter’s arrival or to dread it, because the rest of the night would be spent in an awkward, hanging sort of position with the rest of the conversation between Charlie and I dangling just above our heads while Kevin, ever the clueless one, would be kept out of the loop. Quickly my attempts to refrain from becoming irate had vanished; the already boring Friday night was shaping out to be the worst I’d had in a long time.
“Why is it so damn hard to get close to you? To be enough for you? To please you? To be the ‘son you always wanted?’ Have any idea?”
He moved first, like an old engine roaring to life, but this life seemed far worse than the previous one. Instead of the anger lighting up his freckled face red and blotched, instead of the crease in his eyebrows that cast wrinkles down on his cheeks that far surpassed his age, or instead of his passive kind of sadness, there was something new lying in his features that I didn’t know how to handle, contrary to the belief I had that I tried to soothe myself with.
“Cas, I don’t…” Sam chokes. The two rock back and forth together, one bewildered, the other the most religious he has been and ever will be. “I don’t know what to…how did you…”
I approached Dean with shocking ease, probably driven by the long interval of time I’d been forced to properly carry out my job, but upon reaching his hunched form, shoulders low and weighted down by the load of his signature jacket, my throat decided to cease working, and enabled me only to stare in wait before Dean noticed my presence, and I knew one of those days my odd way of just watching was going to get to him.
I wanted to feel his hands brush against my arms, and I wanted to see his eyes so close to mine, and I wanted to hear his laugh, and I wanted him to care about me in the way I did him. So what had gone wrong, and what was I supposed to do now?
I chuckled, ruffling his freshly cut hair until it stuck up in frayed bunches at the sides of his head.
The young woman, whom I’d been so intently listening to, hung her full head of midnight hair in shame, embarrassment maybe, as her grip on her wine glass faltered and her fingers fell. I paused in my cleaning of shot glasses to give her a long, sad,  yet supportive gaze in hopes it was what she was in need of at the time. I found that, occasionally, my responses to people’s despair or inner turmoil were considered blunt, slightly insensitive, when I truly was just unaware as to what the correct reply was. A knack for observation did not always imply a similar knack for sociability.
“No, not today. I just don’t think you’re in any condition to drive in such weather,” I admitted. I wasn’t lying in the least, and Dean knew this, but he also knew the significance lying in wait under such polite and friendly words. I had no intention of being friendly.
“Probably thinks Jesus Christ himself is coming down in the morning to save us all, in a fiery storm of hell and sin…” she muttered with a smirk, rolling her eyes in the back of her head.
I grimaced and bit my lower lip, a way much less sensual than what had been done in the minutes earlier, and immediately my eyes flicked down to Cas. Predictably, he’d heard the proposed favor and while he didn’t look entirely happy about it, he nodded his head as an “okay,” and I mouthed a silent,
“If...if you’re referring to what Kevin said earlier, I can assure that it’s nothing. I was just being sociable, that’s all, since no one else was at the bar…”
“Well, that’s good then!” I answered. There was no blatantly toneless voice there. I was enthusiastic and engaging. “It never gets very nice around here anyways. A shame, really…”
The source of my faltering was sipping leisurely, yet gratefully, at his drink without a care in the world gracing any section of his features. If anything, the slight buzz in his system that was dilating his pupils made him seem even more bright, more captivating, and I wanted to know how he was doing that, how he’d taken control of that conversation, what in the world he was trying to accomplish, and just what the warm, excited feeling in my stomach and lower abdomen was. It was like grasping at straws, but with three blindfolds on and with a clock chiming midnight in the background, and it took me ages to find any sort of reason or answer.
“My brother, Sam, called me a few hours ago to tell me that he’s stopping in for the weekend to visit my dad and I.”
Dean watches until his knees buckle, which earns everyone’s attention. Sam’s palms are splayed atop Dean’s knees and he squeezes with urgency. Cas’s hands, meanwhile, find the small of Dean’s neck and stroke. The tingling resumes.
“You could start by telling me what’s on your mind, or whatever will make you feel better about what happened this weekend,” I retorted, priding myself in the speed at which the reply had appeared in my mind and at how flawless it had been executed. Dean seemed to feel the same way and it nearly rendered him speechless. Perhaps it would’ve, actually, had I not passively urged him to let loose even further. I knew it was for his benefit, and so did he.
“Well then I at least suggest drawing the blinds. While the light is nice, I highly doubt you want the outside seeing you in such a state.”
My answer spelled out relief across his features, and I even watched as his hands unfolded and untangled, fraying out slightly and daring my forearms that were still perched against the bar, and I tried my best to act like his shifting had meant little to me, that I hadn’t noticed the shift of his position, but whatever reaction I had was too obvious and had alerted Dean. He smirked to himself, not daring to look up at who he was silently making fun of, and soon continued on his stories.
Charlie sighed deeply, the breath blowing a few strands of her hair that had fallen in front of her face during her speech into the air before they fluttered back down to their original, inconvenient post. Eventually she shook her head no, but there wasn’t any sadness in her expression, just hope. Hope that it would happen one of these days.
“Heh, I guess you could say that…” he replied. I blinked at the sound and out of my studying, back into reality, and into my panic over what to say. My plans for a relaxing, void-of-excitement Friday night were certainly out the window at that point.
“It’s not gonna be natural. Hopefully he won’t be too pissed at me for stickin’ with my dad, not leaving him at some point, but even if we’re on okay terms, my dad ‘n him hate each other’s guts,” he explained, pausing to take a deep breath inwards. “There’s no way in hell that’s it’s gonna end up good.”
