. I happen to know his sons. I know where they are – it’s not any of your business or his for that matter, but there was nothing -.” Steve stops. “You know what? You don’t deserve an explanation. I can talk to whoever I want to, when I want to.” He struggles with the bag but manages to shove past Tony to leave the quarters. He leaves the purse with the applicators on the bed, he leaves the beautiful uniforms.
In that moment, he saw all the things he knew he could not do become possible. The soul bond pulsed before him, alive and healthy and a living thing. More than just a hope or wish, it tethered him to Steve – more than an anchor and more like a link to life itself. As it flourished between them his heightened sense of self, of the bond Tony opened his eyes to see the gleaming display of stars projected around them, but it paled in comparison to the living bond.
The wood toxin in his system dulled his senses, but the sun’s brightening rays shot through him as sure as an arrow to the heart. He thrashed then, mustering enough energy to lurch away from his captors and totter and fall to his knees in the middle of the roof top. The glare from the daylight hitting the cityscape scorched his retinas and he whined at the feel of it, like hot pokers in his eyeballs. He shielded his eyes with his arm and tried again to get to his feet. The hot roof seared the soles on his feet and he tumbled to his knees, then hit his chin against the roof tile.
Tony raised a shoulder in a shrug. “That’s your buddy, Barnes, and that other cluster far off is the Maximoff twins. They are really unknowns and only connected to the rest of the group by the common parameter of you.”
With that tiny admission, Steve dives into the next kiss as a starving man – someone who has denied himself pleasure and happiness for so long in consideration of the mission. Tony discovers that Steve is the kind of person who kisses with his whole being. His arms encompass Tony, his mouth dances over his lips, his chin, his neck. His hands search over Tony, feeling, exploring, and teasing. In response, Tony moans and hisses; he sways a little with desire. Steve bends and then abruptly Tony’s in his arms and they’re on the bed.
“I thought he was just sickly,” Tony says. He knows he should have put two and two together. Alphas are rarely ill.
Bruce agrees. It’s the only way to find out if the disentanglement has worked. They could do some more complex tests. But this is simple and easy – and will give them the answer in only minutes.
He shoved his hand away, his body still pulsating with orgasm. Trembling, the tears streamed down his face as he lie there cold and alone in his bedroom. Tony had never been there; it had all been his foolish, immoral fantasy. Steve sat up in the bed, shivered, and then crawled out of it. He staggered, still reeling from the intensity of his climax. Going to the bathroom he cleaned up, washing as quickly as possible and only clinically touching himself. After he went back to bed and stared at the shadowed images on the ceiling. The painted silhouettes of the street below wavered in the insubstantial moonlight.  He let the motion of the flickering lights bring him back to his Soul Mantra, closing himself off, shutting down so as not to face the reality of how the future had corrupted him.
“That, something like that would happen to you, if you did this with me?” Tony says and swallows visibly.
“I can’t imagine how you did all of this,” Steve glances around the room but he’s too late, Tony steers him a door notched in the corner of the laboratory.
When Steve gets to his feet, and holds onto the chair in the room to stand, Tony nods with satisfaction. “Listen, I can pay another local for their silence to help you out, now. You don’t really need me. The ocean, the water seems to be miraculous as far as curing you.”
God, Jarvis really does hate him. Steve closes his eyes because he can’t stomach it. His headache morphs into a full-blown nuclear explosion in his head. He swears he can feel the beat of his blood in his temples.
“Yeah,” Steve says, and a blossom of color reaches his too pale cheeks. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
In the bed, struggling to get free, Clint ignored Steve. He thrashed and arched up, drool dripping from his mouth. This was one of the reasons Steve needed to get the pack under control, needed to know more than just what the books and wise men told him. He needed practical experience. He recalled as a new Captain America how awkward and unrefined his fighting style and strategic plans were, but now he had years of experience on his side. As a souler, as a leader of a soul pack, he was that young naïve Captain again, but he reached down deep into his fears and swept them away.
Steve leaves it in the box. “It’s beautiful, Tony, but it isn’t mine. We’re not bonded.” His free hand automatically goes to the bandage on his neck. “Not anymore.”
He nodded. He knew that. Logically, he understood it. But his blood was still the blood that Pierce and Ross hungered after even if they were dead. There would be others, others who would seek him out, hunt him down, drain him again and again. He’d offered his blood to Tony – a long time ago – in a Blood Den. “When I went to the Blood Den -.” He started. “When I went to that first Blood Den all those years ago and I met Tony, I had no intention of leaving alive. I wanted to die. I don’t fit in here. I never did. Not then, not now. Tony saved me then.” He sighed, and no relief of tension would help him. He didn’t mention that Tony had saved him again.
“Please, Tony, he didn’t. It’s not his fault. He’s a victim,” Steve cried out but all Tony heard through the noise was the discord of the Brother bond. It crackled in his head, deafening him. “I bonded to him before I bonded to you. He’s a victim. He’s my friend.”
Steve warded off Strange. “I don’t know what you’re planning on doing, but I asked you here for guidance. Nothing more.”
“Okay, so I built it with you as the core. It made sense that way. Resolving each equation to you as the solution. It actually ends up making sense because character traits cancel out or become additive to create the center or you.” Tony smiled and popped on the balls of his feet and then back down. “I’m the shell around you. It worked out that way. I didn’t manipulate the data if you think that. Each cluster around us-.”
“Steven!” Thor jumps to his feet and clamps Steve in an embrace. He beats him on the back and then separates but grips his shoulders. “We haven’t seen you since before the launch. It was spectacular! The reviews are raving about the story and the art. How modern and very driven it is. Stripped from today’s headlines. You must come back.” He shakes Steve a little.
Steven frowns and furrows his brow. There’s something disarming about the way he looks, the way he studies Tony. “I’m not exactly sure how I’m supposed to respond, my lord. As you’ve said repeatedly, we are not friends. Nor are we lovers. We are companions by design. I understand my biology as well as your biology.”
“You don’t want to leave Bucky,” Natasha retorts and she’s fire and rage more so than any of the preachers with their tales of brimstone he’d seen on the trail leading out West.
Tony sank down, defeated. To save his children, Clint had acted as any father would. Maybe there could have been another way, but should Tony blame him? Could he? Tony only shook his head. “Just leave, Barton. Make sure they don’t kill him. Okay?” They might take away Tony’s glands, but at least Steve might survive.
Clint, with arms crossed, frowned and said, “Lots of chatter. Media reports are linking Steve up with probable vampires. You’re one of them. They’ve been hounding Pepper Potts and your friend in the Air Force.”
Steve shakes his head. “No, I just want to start. I don’t mean to be rude, but I want to – I’m close.” She doesn’t need to know all the pain behind his words. “I don’t want to know his name. He’s only to call me omega and I’ll call him alpha. If that’s okay.”
Little Tony squealed and started to wildly spread the sauce onto the dough, although not doing a great job at the ‘spreading’ part. Once it looked like the boy was happy with the spreading he took the spatula and started smacking it into the sauce, spraying the boy with the red sauce.
“Tony! Oh darling, please don’t cry! You are the most beautiful creature we have ever seen. We love what you did with your makeup.”
Steve was staring down at him, hair mussed and eyebrow raised with an unimpressed look upon his face. Next to him Bucky was struggling hard not to laugh.
Tony was overwhelmed. He could barely look them in the eyes with how much the older men were starting at him. He didn’t know what to choose, all he knew was that he needed.
Well?????? CLIFF HANGER!! I swear Tiny Tony won't suffer for too long! And big Tony should be making an appearance really soon!
“BABY TONY, STEVE! FOR THE LOVE OF ODIN BABY TONY!” Clint shouted over Steve, he wasn’t above playing a little dirty and it was the right card to play. It was almost comical with how fast Steve’s face melted from firm, responsible team leader, to besotted fool, to that of a torn man.
“Now, now Antonio. Now darling, please settle down, and play me your pretty little song.” cooed Maria
“Needy, desperate little thing,” with that Bucky shot down and latched his mouth once again on Tony’s nipple, the other being pulled and squeezed by Bucky’s free hand. The other overlapping Steve’s along Tony’s cock. As if they had planned it the soldiers squeezed and stroked him perfectly in sync, Steve placing hot open mouth kisses all along his jaw. That was it. Tony couldn’t take anymore. All he had to do was let go, so he did.
“If you’re faithful to your daily prac-ti-cing! You will find your progress is en-cour-a-ging. Do mi so me do mi so me fa la so it goes! When you do your scales and your arpe-gios.”
Bucky went slow so he wouldn’t shock Tony’s system too much. He new his lover was going to absolutely hate this. The water itself wasn’t even that cold, lukewarm really, but to Tony it would probably feel completely unpleasant. Bucky grimaced at the thought, scowled outright when his predictions were verified when as soon as Tony’s legs were submerged Tony began to whimper in earnest and weakly kick his legs, rolling his head against Bucky’s shoulder. Bucky shushed him.
All Tony could muster was a nod which worked for the soldiers as Steve dove for Tony’s soft lips and Bucky to Tony’s neck leaving sweet kitten kisses up and down his neck and moving to his jaw. Tony was overwhelmed. He couldn’t believe that Steve and Bucky were kissing him. It felt like a dream. Each man was treating him so gently as if they thought he would break or disappear. Steve’s lips were warm and soft against his. He gasped when he felt a cold metal hand reach under his shirt to run across his stomach, giving Steve a chance to slip his tongue into Tony’s mouth, deepening the kiss. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut. He was surrounded, he felt warm and safe between his supersoldiers. Tony could call them his.
“They’re probably down there getting frisky, gross.” Clint said with a shudder. “Ow!” he yelled as a pillow was whacked against the back of his head by Natasha.
Tony shot up, eyes bulging as he took in the sight of his two boyfriends still in full combat gear. They had at least put away their weapons, Bucky’s guns and Steve’s shield. The two soldiers were smirking at him, something Tony had never seen before, it made his pulse quicken.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I, I don’t really know where to start,” he mumbled the blush returning to his cheeks. The soldiers moaned, sharing a look.
The last response got a glare from Steve and Bucky. No one better try flirting with Tony. He was theirs...once they got his consent first of course. The avengers turned quickly back to the screen when they saw Peggy come into view to quickly reassure the boy.
“Then it is up to the great Captain America to rescue his friend. Where did your shield go? Captain America needs his shield if he is going to be going on a daring mission.”
“It may be too late for ‘should have’ but we still have time for doin.” Bucky said “Steve, let’s go down and talk to him. We can’t leave him down there alone. I know he’s a capable adult, but...I’m worried he’s gonna do somethin stupid.”
“If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a hundred times, stay away from my work boy! If nothing is going to get through to you then we’ll have to do something else!” Howard bellowed. Little Tony was in tears at this point and his whimpers were quickly growing louder and louder. During this whole exchange the camera began to droop lower and lower as Jarvis seemed to forget he had the camera going.
“Aye, the young Anthony was truly a force of cuteness, I am as what the midgardians say, can’t even right now.”
After a few moments Steve picked up the body wash and began lathering over whatever parts Steve could reach of Tony’s body, wiping away all the sweat and grime. Bucky copying Steve, reached over to grab the shampoo and began working up a thick lather. Tilting Tony’s head back Bucky began to massage his scalp, making sure to drag his nails across his crown the way he knew that Tony liked.
Tony squealed in his embarrassment. A fact he would take to his grave. His face by now was as red as his suit and he had to hide his face away in his hands.
“No. I-I like watching the videos. I really do. Honest. I’m just nervous for another Howard appearance.”
“Bucky’s right Steve” replied Bruce “Tony tends to over think, he’s obviously upset. It’s best you two go down instead of all of us for now and try to make this right. We’re all worried.”
“That’s right. Since you are the chef and I your loyal assistant you tell me what ingredients you need.” With that Jarvis moved off screen and let the focus stay on Tony.
“Clint didn’t just find the movies by himself, I was there too. I coulda told him to put them back.” Bucky mumbled.
Tony was silent. Deep down he knew that what JARVIS said was true. His team was his family, they never would have used the evidence in the movies to hurt him, tease him for sure, but that’s what families did. The movie with Howard was an unexpected blow. He didn’t want things with the Avengers to change. He didn’t want to be viewed with pity. He was still the same Tony he has always been. Tony learned quickly to hide from Howard if he wanted to stay safe. Sometimes there wasn’t always someone there to save him. He realized early on that he had to save himself. The less contact he had with his father as he grew up the safer he’d be.
“Stevie,” and oh, his voice sounded choked up as well, “That was the cutest fuckin thing I have ever seen! Did ya see the way he ran around attacking all the bad guys? He was tryin to use his shield just like you do! And Bucky Bear? Are ya serious? They fuckin made those? Do ya think he slept with it all the time? Kill me now Steve! I can’t continue to live now that I know this exists in life! I need him like a fuckin fish needs water! I want to hide him away and never let anything happen to him again! Fuck! I-” Bucky was really working himself up. Steve cupped his hands on both sides of Bucky’s face and placed a chaste kiss on his lips to stop his ranting.
“You both came to me and I tried to say no, but even I went against your consent Tony, we should have asked. We’re sorry Tony, I’m...sorry.” Steve apologized
Warm. It was warm. Tony hummed his approval. He felt warm and safe. A soft comforting weight was at his back and another at his front. He felt loose and sated. He had the best dream. His lovers showed him what it was like to feel pleasure. Steve’s lips on his neck, Bucky’s on his chest. Their skin rubbing slick together from the warm bath water. Their hands together on his cock.
“Sweetheart,” cooed Steve, “It’s alright, we want you to feel good. Remember? We said we would help you.”
Tony sighed sliding further down into his bath. It had been a long day filled with board meetings and putting on the act that he knew what he was doing. He had only just a few short months ago, come of age to take over his father’s company. Not to mention the whole debacle with Ob-with Stane. Then having to go through different lawyers and board members to let Pepper run the company instead until he came of age. The stress was-a lot- so much so that he had been kept so busy and stressed he never got to see his boyfriends as much as he wanted.
“Might I say Captain, yours and Sergeant Barnes’ efforts are paying off. Sirs temperature is currently at 101.1 and declining.”
“Pep’ronni pease!” Baby Tony reached in his sauce covered hands into the cheese bowl and shoved it into his mouth, chewing noisily. Tony then put his hand into his newest bowl and started dropping pepperoni circles onto the pizza, “sneakily” eating a few pieces. More going into his mouth than the pizza.
Tony screamed when he felt a hard suck on his nipples. The scratchy feeling of Bucky’s stubble. The hot mouth, the pressure! Tony’s hands shot up quickly to twine his fingers in the long strands of Bucky’s hair. Bucky chuckled and gave a long lick to the teased puckered bud.
Heyyyyyy everybody! It has been a while! School is out for the summer and my first official year as a teacher is a success! Hopefully I will have more time to update. I have read your comments and it makes me feel all warm inside! Not sure how I feel about this chapter, but...meh.
“Oh hell no!” Everyone jumped and looked over to Natasha who looked absolutely offended for Tony. Natasha stared everyone else down. “What? He’s a beautiful little baby and he deserves all the praise. Don’t fucknig judge me or I will end you.”
Tony only grunted in response making his lovers chuckle. He felt too sleepy and wrung out from what they had just done and he felt too warm and safe wrapped up in his lovers embrace. Sleep was too tempting.
“That literally does not clear up any of my past questions Buck, could you be more specific?” Steve deadpanned
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Come on sweetcheeks, open that pretty mouth and be a good boy for us and take your medicine. We promise you’ll feel better. Please? For us?” Bucky continued with his slow rubbing. Tony shifted, whimpered, and to their amazement opened his mouth. Steve took his opportunity and plopped the pills into his mouth and helping Tony to drink from the cup, watching patiently as he swallowed them with a grimace.
“Don’t worry baby boy, I’m not going anywhere. We made you a right mess and we need to clean ya up before we go to bed,” cooed Bucky
Steve quickly looked back at the screen when he heard the woman speak to baby Tony and just in time as the baby raised his arms and shrieked and giggled with the biggest toothless smile on his chubby face. Bucky reached out to grab Steve’s arm for support, his other arm grabbing his chest and a pinched look on his face. Bucky moved his lips and Steve vaguely heard another whispered obscenity. Tony was so little, an absolute angel Steve just wanted to bundle the small baby on screen and hold him tight and never let him go.
“Oh he liked that Stevie,” Bucky said as he kissed down Tony’s chest. “Is Steve makin ya feel good sweet thing? Feel’s good to have someone touchin your cock?” Tony sobbed out a breath. He couldn’t take a whole lot more. He never knew it could feel so good with someone. Their kisses, their words, their touches. It was enough to make him delirious with want.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another pause, “Well you were wearing your mother’s dress, jewelry, and makeup. You looked quite lovely Sir.”
“Perfect Captain. I suggest you look a little closer in the room and I am sure Bucky Bear will be found.” As if waiting for his cue the boy took of running at full speed around the room periodically stopping to make dramatic battle poses and to thrust his shield at assumedly pretend bad guys.
Silence. All three men were staring at each other with wide eyes. Steve and Bucky were sharing quick, panicked looks with each other and staring at Tony. Tony was too shocked to say anything. He kept staring at the pair, waiting for someone to say something. Steve and Bucky shared one more look and seemed to have come to a decision.
The rest of the Avengers were still sitting in the communal room, none of them having the energy to get up as they all still felt awful for betraying their friend the way they did.
Tony sighed. Seeing his mother on camera always brought nostalgia and just a little bit of heart break. As if sensing his feelings, Bucky and Steve leaned down and placed sweet kisses on his cheeks, making Tony smile.
Tony pouted and pretended to think about it. “I’m still a little mad. However, I can think of a few ways you can make it up to me” he smirked
“Tony!” the Avengers called. However their calls seemed to land on deaf ears. Tony ran from them as if his backside was on fire. The doors to the elevator closed with a sense of cold finality.
Steve was about to have a stroke when the boy’s face creased in concentration, obviously trying to complete the task given to him. After another moment the boy ran off camera and came back holding a tiny plastic replica of his shield. Steve put his head in his hands, completely overcome with cuteness. He felt a weight against his shoulder and knew it was Bucky.
“Yes sir,” Steve gave a mock salute and began to maneuver himself into position. Laying on his back and tucking his face between Tony’s legs. Once Steve was settled, Bucky swung his leg over Steve to straddle his hips.
With an ear splitting wail Tony came. His whole body seized up, back and legs taught, moaning out his lovers names over and over like a prayer. He could distantly feel Bucky and Steve moving against him, moving against each other, until they too stilled, twin moans falling from their mouths.
Steve pulled back to give Tony some air. ‘My turn, my turn Stevie, I wanna taste.” Wordlessly the two larger men spun the smaller around so now he was facing Bucky and Bucky was kissing his lips while Steve kissed the opposite side of his neck, sucking gently. Bucky kissed harder than Steve, still gentle, but with a little more insistence. His tongue ran along the seam of Tony’s lips asking for entrance which Tony quickly gave, moaning into the kiss,
“Buck, I, fuck, I know, I know-that was like pure sugar and I’m 99.9% sure I have developed several cavities that I will be calling my dentist about-but calm down, if it makes you feel better lets talk to him, tonight. I don’t wanna wait anymore either.
“Friend Anthony, you are truly a gifted soul. Who knew one at such a small age could be so masterful.” said Thor
“Stop worrying Stevie,” Bucky murmured, “His temp is goin down, and JARVIS will let us know if it gets worse again. Otherwise I say we get some sleep. I have a feelin that the next few days are gonna be one hell of a time. His throat looked like it was bothering him, so he’s probably getting a cold.”
Sweet giggling could be heard as the pair walked down the hallway, Maria still filming the two and chuckling to herself. The two vanished around the corner and the picture turned to black.
“Fuck,” Steve whispered. This time everyone shared the same matching looks. Everyone had gathered on the common floor (it had the biggest TV) as soon as the word had spread, Clint worked fast it seemed. Clint and Natasha were sharing the love seat closest to the shared kitchen while Bruce was snuggled up like a burrito on the opposite couch. The towers Norse deity was sprawling on the other half of said couch next to Bruce, his feet in his lap. Steve and Bucky took the other love seat and were pressed closely together.
Little Tony put down his slice and started stomping in place, a huge saucy grin on his face. He stuck up both tiny fists with his thumbs up and screamed.
“Oh my god!” Bucky yelled, “Tony! Sweetheart! Love of my life!” Bucky broke down into giggles again. Exasperated, Tony turned to Steve for an answer, beginning to become self conscious.
“You two remind me of my brother and I when we were young. What’s a little tussle between friends?” asked Thor
Tony wasn’t sure if he was blushing before but he was definitely blushing now. Steve and Bucky were staring at him. While he was in the tub. While he was NAKED in the tub. Tony subconsciously sank a little further into the water, trying to inconspicuously cover his sex with his hands. He was thankful for the copious amounts of bubbles he put into his bath.
Like a tree ability will bloom and grow. If you’re smart you’ll learn by heart what every artist knows! You must sing your scales. And your ar-pe-e-e-giooooos!” Little Tony’s finger flew over the keys in one last beautiful flourish as the song came to an end.
“The Avengers watched only four movies thus far and they were as follows. You as a newborn swinging and your mother talking to you, you dressing up in a Captain America onesie searching for your Bucky Bear-”
“Stevie” Bucky whined and oh no, those were puppy dog eyes. Who would have thought such a look on a man like Bucky who usually sauntered around with the air of “look at me and I’ll fucking rip your dick off” and “yes, that is a gun in my pocket, and no I am not happy to see you” could look so incredibly endearing.
Everyone got back into place once the next movie was picked. There had been a short argument between Clint and Thor about which one they should watch next, but Thor quickly shot it down with one hard stare and a flex of his arms.
Bucky laughed, “Alright, alright. We’ve talked long enough our poor boy has been waiting so long. Let’s get to work soldier.”
“Oh, my god. Stevie. I’m dead. My heart has stopped. It couldn’t handle this straight up sugar sweet.” bemoaned Bucky
They smirked when Tony let out a startled ‘meep!’ when they dropped their pants. They chuckled as well when Tony quickly covered his eyes. Their boy was so sweet.
“Sh! I want to hear!” hissed Natasha. The team settled back down and turned their attention back to the TV.
The women couldn’t take it any longer and burst into laughter, it was just too cute. As soon as they did though, they almost immediately regretted as the tiny Tony’s face on screen began to crumble and tears began to well in his eyes.
“So what does he taste like?” asked Steve while rubbing soothing circles on a panting Tony’s stomach.
Everyone jumped and quickly looked back at the screen. During their conversation the Avengers had missed the beginning of a new movie. On screen it appeared to be Tony talking to Jarvis as he excitedly showed the older man something he had made, it looked like some kind of blueprint drawn onto a piece of paper.
“Bucky,” Tony whined. With one last suck Bucky lifted up letting Tony’s cock slip out from between his lips. Bucky hummed, licking the taste from his lips.
Tony could only whimper in response which only seemed to anger Howard more. Turing on his heel with Tony’s arm still in his grasp and began to walk quickly from the room.
“What?” Steve looked down to get a better look at Tony’s now exposed face. He inhaled sharply and quickly placed the back of his hand across Tony’s forehead, becoming even more worried when he didn’t try and bat Steve’s hand away. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut as Steve got a good feel of his temperature.
Bucky grabbed onto Tony gently and urged him to turn over, lifting up his hips. Exposing Tony to Bucky’s greedy eyes. Bucky moaned at the sight. His lover was so adorable and yet so unbelievably sexy.
Tony hummed in acknowledgement and let himself be washed by his lovers. He mewled when Steve washed his hair, it felt so could and he felt more than he heard Steve chuckle. Bucky had warmed a cloth and was tenderly wiping the mess from Tony’s thighs and stomach.
“Don’t worry sweet thing. No matter what happens we’ll be here. We can stop whenever you give the word.”
The playing came to a peak and slowly went back to a slow easy tempo as everyone in the room began to sing.
Bruce cleared his throat looking bemused and pointing to Clint and Thor rummaging through the movies. “If you two lovebirds don’t mind, there are more home videos to watch.”
With that, it was like a flip had switched, both soldiers seemed to move in unison. One second they were lying comfortably within their blanket cocoon and the next the covers were thrown off and Tony found himself on his back staring up into the eyes of two very hungry looking and very naked super soldiers. Tony swallowed hard.
“Steve, don’t even think of acting all Captain America on us, we know what kind of man you really are and we know that you along with the rest of us are just dying to see these.” Clint waggled his eyebrows at Steve.
“Did you just see the eyebrow wiggle? Did you see! Ah! What four year old knows how to do that!” yelled Natasha desperately trying to keep her calm persona and failing miserably.
CLIFF HANGERSSSSSSSSS I've always reading them but doing them as a writer warms a dark part of my hears I didn't know I had? Also! If you want to check out my Tumblr you can? I don't have really anything too interesting and not really any original content. Perhaps if I continue to write fic I'll make a separate account just for those. Check it out! (If you want)
“and his gang of Howling Commandos.” Tony gasped, all sadness from earlier leaving and being replaced by sheer giddiness.
“Marie-” Before little Tony could finish his sentence Marie jumped up and pushed his head onto the piano making a loud chord of notes. Jumping down herself she quickly ran out of the room, little Tony quick to follow.
They both looked down at their sick lover and their hearts broke. Poor Tony had his eyes barely open looking blearily up at them, pain in his eyes.
“Oh, Stevie, we found the greatest thing since colored TV, in fact we need a TV to experience the greatness!” Bucky giggled as he grabbed Steve by the waist to help him down.
However, Tony was too embarrassed to tell his boyfriends, afraid they would leave him for a more experienced partner. He was too selfish to let them go. He would miss the cuddles, the kisses, and the sweet words too much.
“How do you wanna do it honey? I don’t think you’re ready for our cocks, what do you want? Our hands our our mouths?” asked Steve
“Hush now darlin, you’re beautiful, every bit. One day we’re going to prove it,” cooed Bucky, “Now, Steve, you can go have a taste of Tony and I can skip the meal and go straight to dessert.”
“Sweetheart,” Steve whispered in his ear, “I can feel your nervousness from here. Do you want us to stop watching the videos?”
“Mhm,” Bucky hummed, placing a kiss against his chest, making Tony swallow hard. “I think. You’ll taste. Absolutely. Sweet,” Bucky punctuated each word with a kiss, slowly making his way down Tony’s body until Tony could feel his breath on the tip of his cock. Tony looked down, eyes locking with his longer haired lover. Bucky smirked devilishly, paused for only a moment, then without warning, sucked the head of Tony’s cock into his mouth. Tony screamed.
“Down boy, Tony is too tired for anything else, we can always try something tomorrow if he’s up to it. He’s already passed out, the precious thing.”
“Do you wish for me to continue Sir?” Tony groaned in response “Very well Sir. The third video was your mother and Agent Carter surprising you with a visit.”
Tony whined pitifully and tried to hide behind his hands again, Bucky sensing this took a gentle hold of the younger boys hands, bringing the backs to his mouth and leaving sweet kisses to the back. Tony gave a small smile a the gesture.
“Boy, I know you have been in my workshop, your grubby little fingerprints are all over my work! What have I told you about going into my lab?”
Both men looked at each other curiously. It was far too early for Tony to be done. They had seen the damage to the suit and knew it would take their lover a good long while to fix. That was why they were incredibly surprised when the doors opened to reveal Tony. The men on the couch shared another look this time of hopeful surprise. They watched Tony carefully to see if perhaps he had only come up because he had run out of coffee, but to their surprise Tony lurched forward towards them, head down, and proceeded to crawl onto both of their laps. Most of Tony’s body on Steve’s lap and his feet propped up in Bucky’s. Tony grabbed onto Steve’s shirt and buried his face in his neck and whimpered putting his two lovers on alert immediately.
Bucky popped his head back up with a look of absolute betrayal on his face. Steve laughed even harder.
“Looks like he’s not the only one awake,” murmured the warmth at his front while rocking his hips against Tony’s, making Tony squeak in mortification. It all came back to him, how his lover’s had surprised him during his bath, how they had stripped off their uniforms to join him, how they had taken their hands and-
“Steve! Quick you have to come upstairs with us! You’ll never believe what we found!” Clint yelled for some reason out of breath. At a closer look at the both of them they looked absolutely giddy. Again Steve looked warily over at the two people staring at him expectantly.
“Ok sweet thing, all clean, you did so well, so beautiful when you let go, just letting yourself feel good,” Bucky praised
Tony was cut off my the hot press of lips against his own. Bucky tangled the fingers of his left hand into his hair and held on gently. The kiss, was anything but. Tony gasped at the feel of Steve’s lips against his neck, giving Bucky the perfect opportunity to let his tongue inside.
On screen, baby Tony was swinging his body back and forth on top of his stool as Jarvis began cutting into the pizza. The pizza, now cooled was placed on a plate in front of the tiny chef. Baby Tony eagerly snagged his piece and took a big bite, chewing thoughtfully.
“Well,” said Tony, “Mama trained me in piano as soon as I could hold a screwdriver and that was pretty early on. She wante-”
“Anthony, my dear boy, wave hi to the camera,” a masculine voice with an English accent came from the TV. The little boy looked up at the man behind the camera and waved enthusiastically.
Tony shuddered. He-he wasn’t sure what he wanted. Yes he was incredibly attracted to the all american beef cakes standing in the doorway, he had eyes! But, but them seeing him? It made him incredibly nervous. Tony knew he was attractive, but, they were super soldiers, the perfect specimen of man. He had also never gotten naked with someone before. It made him shiver.
Tony squinted his eyes in concentration trying to remember what could possibly be on the tape. “Yeah,” he replied slowly, “I think that one’s ok.”
“Oh sweet thing you have no idea how long I have waited to get a taste of you. Steve and I have a bet going on about what you’ll taste like. Stevie thinks you’ll taste more tangy, like sweat and metal, since you spend so much time in your workshop, but I disagree.”
The slight pulse from Bucky reminded Tony how alone and desperate he must be – Tony considered Steve – thrust into the 21st century, told to fight aliens, joined up with an agency that ended up being his darkest enemy, and then forced to finally face his own orientation. How fucking messed up would that make anyone? On top of all of that he ended up the leader of a band of misfits in a soul pack.
The silence weighs on them, then. There are no other words to say because it’s true. Whatever happened to Steve is a science Tony doesn’t understand. He can’t even figure out where to begin to try and discern how it happened or why. Tony puzzles over it, listening until Steve falls asleep, thinking he would leave, but by that time, the heaviness of inertia settles over him and he stays until he too slumbers.
If he hadn’t been on the very edge of panic, he would have taken out a sketch pad and tried to capture the sight on paper. Instead, he stared at the arc reactor (he knew Tony called it something else, but to Steve it would always be the arc reactor, the very heart of Tony) sitting on his bedside table. He was terrified to touch the thing when he was this close to losing control, but it helped to see the light still shining from it, bright and unwavering.
Tony’s eyes immediately darted around the room, reflexively seeking out the exits. His posture, though, actually loosened in response to Steve’s words. He sat back in his seat, and released a long, slow exhalation too controlled to be a sigh. The tension those gestures contained, the contradiction of seeking reassurance through punishment while also trying to escape it, was so perfectly Tony that Steve found himself oddly reassured. This, he could do. This, he was practically made for. He could already feel the calm sense of righteousness that came with punishing a submissive who needed it, needed him, settling into his bones.
Steve said what he did next because he had to. Because Bucky had to understand that little Stevie Rogers, the one who could do this all day, get up as many times as he’d been hit, no matter how brutally, had died right alongside their submissive. He didn’t know yet who had taken his place, but if he was to be stripped utterly of the right to hope, he wouldn’t permit the team to imagine he was capable of making it out of this with his soul remotely intact.
Dummy, who had been circling the island, sped over to Steve and began beeping furiously. Steve was not nearly as skilled as Bucky had become with translating the robot’s noises, but they were too low in pitch and slow to sound like his usual happy greetings. There was some kind of distress woven in there, and a few seconds later they were accompanied by Tony muttering,
see it so easily, that Tony was appreciated here in the ways Steve knew had been lacking in his previous universe.
“Everything is alright, okay? This was coming, we all knew it was. I think we had just hoped it would be…well, with us.”
So why, then, couldn’t Tony sit still? He shifted and fidgeted and twitched all the way through the first cartoon and into the second, which featured the two mice on his pajamas. The chair was obscenely comfortable, it wasn't that, nor was it the company making him uncomfortable, something just…wasn’t right. It was like the physical equivalent of the niggling sensation of knowing you’d forgotten something. He cast his eyes about the room, searching for some kind of visual trigger as to what the hell was the matter with him. When his gaze found its way to the floor at Coulson’s feet for the third time, he groaned in quiet realization. (He was
In short, you’re absolutely correct that the decline and eventual elimination of subtonin was a possibility, it was simply one that posed severe enough risks that placing emphasis on it seemed unwise.
Bruce stared at the words ‘Infinity War’ and ‘Submission’ for several long moments. Then he gestured to the first, a jerky, imprecise movement that suggested perhaps the Hulk was closer to the forefront than Coulson had realized.
“Natasha, this isn’t just relevant to me as an Avenger. You know SHIELD wants him.” She nodded. “But you’re not going to tell me. You’re not usually the type to mutiny without cause, and you had no issue with trying to bring him in before so something has changed. Something personal.”
“Do you people even need me down here?” Tony wondered, realizing several seconds too late that he’d spoken aloud.
“No, you’re right. Tony’s got this all figured out, sounds like, and since he doesn’t seem to think the future of our relationship, or SHIELD or SI for that matter, is something that any of us deserve to be consulted on, it’s probably best if I just—”
Tony also wanted it known that he overcame a lot of temptation when he’d finally managed to break in. Howard’s notes on his contributions to the super-solider project were there, for fuck’s sake. Tony could have finally figured out what the hell Vita-Rays were, or whether St—Rogers had been pulling his leg about that portion of the experiments all along. And Tony had walked by them, determined to stay focused and avoid any of the catastrophes that tended to be the result of allowing his curiosity free reign.
“I’m afraid I do not fully understand what has happened,” Thor said. Contrary to the times when he played at ignorance for fun, the demigod despised the moments when he felt like he was letting down his team by not fully grasping something about Midgarian society. Natasha leaned just slightly into him, which from her was as much a show of affection as a bear hug or a kiss from any other member of the team.
“I like it better this way.” Bucky frowned. “No, it’s not—I don’t just mean because I’m pissed at the guy, although he does seem to have ended up going down a substantially worse road than…you know. But Howard was always so much about appearances; it didn’t matter how ugly something was in reality as long as it looked good from the outside. I’m weirdly glad to finally have somewhere to go to remember him that reflects how complicated and weird and shitty and brilliant he was. And it’s okay if today means more than one thing to you, too. I’m sorry they died the way they did, and I’m sorry you were and are traumatized by the act of being forced to kill them. But you also have my permission now and forever to not be all that sorry that they’re gone. Especially him.”
Tony down into headspace so quickly his vision felt like it actually swam a little. “Clint, I think Tony could use some help here. His technique is fine, but his eagerness distracts him.”
“Good. Bruce, don’t bother about information-gathering tonight, you hear me? There are things you’ll need to know from Tony eventually, but don’t let that get in the way of providing adequate care for him now.” Bruce was on his feet before Steve finished speaking, slamming his whole palm against the call button for the elevator even as JARVIS was already opening the doors. With Bruce, and therefore Tony, attended to, Steve focused his attention on the rest of the team. “And it looks like it’s about time the rest of you have a conversation about what it is you’re looking for from Tony, sub or not. If…if he is a sub, though, I’d suggest maybe building on what Bruce did today. Continue to teach him the things he needs to know, but also make that a space to let him experiment, figure out what he wants. And for the love of God do
“Is the whole…being good at talking about fuzzy emotions and stuff, is that—does the orientation thing make that happen somehow?”
No warnings I can think of for this set of responses. I do have a nagging feeling, though, that I'm missing a question someone submitted over the past week. I do keep a running list, but I think one may have gotten lost in the shuffle somehow. If that's your question, please do feel free to resubmit it.
They were just words. Pretty words, words Tony was familiar enough with the aftermath of subspace to have expected to have
Pepper followed after the suit with what could only be described as a stomp, glaring and huffing as the suit threw one of its arms out to the side when she went to pass it. The helmet slowly craned from one direction to the other in a gesture that, though more stiff and mechanical than when Tony himself was the suit, was still familiar to Steve: it was scanning the room, assessing its occupants and the other contents of the room for potential threats.
When this was all over, Steve vowed to himself as he fell in step with Tony, he would tell him. He’d explain how sorry he was for everything, for the War, for refusing to hear Tony’s concerns about Thanos, all of it. With Pepper seeming to be truly out of the picture, maybe Steve could even finally tell Tony about the many sleepless nights he had lost during their separation, regretting the fact that they’d missed their chance. Steve would tell Tony that he’d had so much more than his share of regret and missed chances in his life already, that he wasn’t going to risk it again if there was even a ghost of a chance that the hints of potential he’d sensed between them before hadn’t been one-sided. (When this was all over. When Thanos was behind them and the world restored to normal…he’d tell him then.)
His head was still spinning from that nearly an hour later when a young woman sprinted toward them. She was both short and lithe, but projected the same sense of carefully-contained power that Tony associated with Natasha. Her long curly hair was tied with a band made of colourful, brightly woven fabrics he recognized to be Wakandan, and she wore a black collar around her neck that his gaze kept  falling on without his permission.
“I don’t know. I’m…I’m trying. And I won’t, I promise I’d never make any of you choose or somethin’. But please don’t ask more than that of me for right now.”
“So, um, Phil’s punishment is finishing the homework and other writing stuff under his supervision. What’s yours, Bruce? I don’t  do so well with anticipation.” Bruce smiled and knelt down, too, so that Tony was bracketed on both sides.
“I kind of think it was mostly fate’s fault, really. It’s not unreasonable to have adjusting to your dead partner’s alter-ego from a different universe showing up and then pitching a metaphorical tent in your house. I mean, I guess I could make it an actual tent if you want the penthouse back, though I warn you that since I’m more of a glamping guy the tent may end up taking up more overall square footage—”
His stomach was in his throat as he raced to the roof where the quinjet was already landing. Most of the team was still getting suited up, but Coulson had beaten him there. He stood, arms crossed and expression grave, and did not seem remotely surprised to see Tony.
Tony didn’t know exactly what it was he was begging for, but Steve apparently did, because in seconds he had slid his own pants down, then bent at the waist and hoisted Tony up and into his lap. Steve jabbed his hips upward, sending their cocks rubbing gloriously against one another. Tony’s eyes shut reflexively, lost to the pleasure of all of it, but Steve’s hand was instantly in his hair, tugging hard enough to be just this side of painful.
“How long will it be before you get the results back?” Rhodey asked as Chimva capped the vials and gently shook the ones that had serums in them.
“We can always try to help him sort that out after Tony and his aunt take care of the bigger stuff,” Clint suggested with a shrug. Natasha shook her head decisively.
I have the next chapter mostly written already, so I'm hoping to get back to a semi-regular schedule, but I also make no promises until the end of the semester. Thank you so very much to those of you reading, commenting, kudos-ing, and asking questions of myself and/or the Doctor. I absolutely love writing this verse in large part because of all of you! *blows germy kisses*
He got there just in time to see, or rather not really see, a blur of motion.And a generic kind of New York dude gone slightly to seed, standing on the sidewalk and yelling. His hair had once been a stylish undercut but looked to have grown out awkwardly in recent weeks, and he wore a suit that bagged at the arms and thighs, suggesting a sudden loss of muscle mass. The guy still wasn’t making a huge amount of noise, but Peter guessed that had far more to do with fear than anything else, because his eyes were wide and he was visibly trembling. Every few seconds, he emitted a fearful kind of groan as the air around him blurred and shifted. A couple seconds afterward, a new wound would appear somewhere on his body. A shoe about thirty feet from where he stood indicated he had probably tried to escape his near-invisible attacker, but now he stood frozen in place, anticipating the next attack with an acceptance that couldn’t be called grim or stoic, but rather borne from an utter lack of comprehension. The crowd that was gathering around the man seemed to mirror his reaction, dozens of people stopped and stared with an eerie and weighty silence. It was far, far worse than the kinds of screaming Peter was used to, and his Spidey-senses were going absolutely haywire. They hadn’t been this intense since the day when he’d landed himself half-dead in hospital, and in the path of Tony Stark.
Steve was still here? Was anyone else? Tony mentally weighed the cost and benefits of opening his eyes to try to get himself slightly more oriented, but there was a piece of fabric draping over his eyes before he could make a call one way or the other. He muttered a half-formed and probably incoherent complaint, and reached up to tug halfheartedly at the eye-covering.
In many ways, it felt exactly like the loving chaos he remembered from the little time he’d spent with the Avengers. Clint was running across the bar, dodging peanuts being thrown at him with impressive accuracy by Natasha and yells directed at him by Phil Coulson. Steve was in the kitchen and had his back to all of them, though his shoulders were shaking suspiciously with what Peter was sure was laughter. Next to him, Bruce was leaning against the counter and stirring something in a pot with one hand while he used his chin to turn the page of a book he was reading in the other. Thor was in the living room, where he appeared to be experimenting with attaching various objects to his hammer and then summoning it. Judging by the spilled pile of sour patch kids and broken pop tarts on the floor, many of them had been unsuccessful trials. Tony, who Peter would have expected to be right in the middle of the action, sat smiling but quiet on one of the big lounge chairs. He looked even more worn down than the last time Peter had seen him, though he definitely perked up when he looked Peter’s way. He hugged May, which appeared to be a regular thing between the two of them, and after only a brief moment of hesitation, he brought his hand down on Peter’s shoulder.
SHIELD buzzed with a familiar, quiet intensity. There were three active ops in varying levels of completion, and Steve checked in on all of them first thing, unsurprised to see them all running smoothly in his absence. He was proud of a lot of what he’d accomplished in his time at SHIELD, but gutting and rebuilding the supervisory and handler programs was definitely right there at the top. Every one of them had been hand-picked and trained primarily by Phil and (grudgingly, because she still didn’t quite think of herself as anything but an agent) Natasha, and their final test before their promotions had been to handle the Avengers on a short-term op. Steve had quite literally trusted them all enough to put his and his team’s life in their hands, so something as comparatively minor as leaving them without his direct supervision while he was away hadn’t even been something he’d hesitated over.
There was something eerily beautiful about it, but it wasn’t enough. The struggle between Tony’s mind and body was at a fever pitch; his ass, hot and sore and tender, begged to be released from Natasha’s attentions, but he couldn’t fucking say it, couldn’t make the words come out because then everything would be different, she would know how profoundly Tony had failed her.
“Alright, here’s a real doozy. I want to Dom you, Stark, I’ve been thinkin’ about it pretty much non-stop for weeks, but I
“He wanted to talk to me about an upcoming mission. It’s absolutely fine for me to ask him to wait, I need you to know that. But what you said earlier…I don’t mind if he’s here, Tony. He’s our partner and I’d let him see anything you want him to see. You don’t have to listen to what we’re saying, you don’t have to care at all. If it’s something you want, you can just be seen. Would you like that?”
denotes switches (the higher the numbers go, the more inclined towards domination that switch is, and vice versa with submission)
It was a new tie for Steve, and he was plainly delighted and proud to have mastered it so well. He assured Tony he wouldn’t keep him in the pose for long, conscious as always of putting much of any pressure on Tony’s chest with the arc reactor already exerting its painful presence, but his gaze was unrepentantly hungry as he surveyed his submissive helpless at his feet.
Bucky didn’t call Steve on his bullshit, too focused on guiding him from the room as quickly as possible. The door clicked shut with a terrible finality, and before Steve could bother asking, JARVIS offered his usual assurance that he wouldn’t permit entry to anyone without proper access codes.
“You alright?” At some point, Coulson had made his way around the conference table to stand next to Tony; his hand rested heavy and firm against Tony’s shoulder.
“24 hours, buddy. He has some goodbyes he wanted to make, and then we’ll fly War Machine and Iron Man out to meet y’all in Malibu.”
The Doctor already has some queries he'll be dealing with tomorrow. I'll also aim for another Ask Strange live event around 7:30 MST tomorrow, so feel free to pop by my Tumblr then with more questions (or get them in in advance if you won't be available then!)
"And I don’t think you’ve fixed your suit yet,” Steve continued as if Tony hadn’t interjected at all, “which…I’m not asking you to explain before you’re ready, because I promised you rest and you’ll have every form of it I can give you. But I don’t, I can’t sleep, not like this. Not while it’s your life on the line.”
There was, in short, no reason he could think of for Everhart to burst into his office with a frantic air about her. The woman’s usually flawless hair was tied back in a perilously loose knot that threatened to fall apart any second; she was wearing make up that was smudged and was likely several days old, and instead of her carefully tailored suits she was in a pair of ripped jeans and a t-shirt that looked slightly too big to be her own. He might not have even recognized her if JARVIS hadn’t provided her name when she’d requested access to his personal floor. Before he could even muster a snarky greeting, she was rambling.
“No, you’re fine. I just didn’t get much of a break this morning; the team that was in Italy just got back and pretty much all of them needed some immediate care.” The last Steve had heard the mission in Turin had been going along swimmingly; what had happened to change that drastically enough that everyone involved needed psychological support as part of their debrief? “Put your SHIELD hat away, Director Rogers. Agent Romanov is handling it. I shouldn’t have brought it up at all and I apologize.” She finished the last bite of her bar (the high-protein, high-energy ones that SHIELD bought by the case and kept available throughout the building), wiped her hands on her pants to dislodge crumbs, and then began to rifle through the dark green briefcase next to her. “I assume you did your homework?”
“Well, that was probably the best possible news,” Rhodey said once she’d gone. He had guided Tony over to the workshop couch and he had his arm open wide, clearly ready for Tony to curl against him like a cat. He wanted that, would never get entirely over the easy way that everyone in this universe offered touch so freely and frequently. Today, though, Tony sat down at the other end of the couch, body closing in on itself. Rhodey frowned a little, but continued his cheery monologue. “I mean the cortisol is an issue, obviously, but this way it sounds like your body will have a lot of time to adjust instead of it being like just flipping a switch.”
“Well given that I have no idea what the hell’s going on right now, it probably makes more sense for me to leave. I’m hungover as shit anyway, maybe now Dummy will let me make a smoothie in peace.” Another series of beeps sounded from the bots, but the lower tone and slower intervals between the noises made them come across less indignant and more…defeated. Like they’d expected Tony to let them down. (Goddammit.)
Tony had never been one for lingering in bed in the mornings. Even in the most hedonistic days of his youth, when his nights had been filled with models and expensive liquor instead of panic attacks and alien invasions, he’d always preferred to be sucking down coffee and halfway to the labs before the last fuzzy edges of sleep departed his consciousness.
Where I see Rhodes being most useful on this front, however, is in considering some of the daily ways in which this dynamic impacts Stark. He’s an imminently practical person, so I suspect it will be he who will realize that Stark may not wish to continue sleeping in sheets that did not originally belong to him. Rhodes also excels at not making assumptions, however, so I see him as equally capable of recognizing the moments where the continuity between the two might bring Stark comfort (such as with both versions of Stark each having the same favourite coffee mugs or t-shirts.)
Tony tapped the arc reactor with the tips of three fingers. Instantly, the armour was bleeding out of it, spreading smoothly across Tony’s limbs and encompassing him totally in a matter of seconds. It was
“You told me you need to rest. That’s all I want for you, Tony. That’s all I’ve ever wanted for every version of you I have ever known. I couldn’t give him that in the end, I couldn’t protect him or save him from so many kinds of hurts. And I know you’re not him. It’s not about trying to get a do-over or…I don’t know, trying to fix him through you or something. I just, I think I…we could really give you the things you need if you let us, I think we could be so good for each other, Tony, and I want, I, fuck I’m making a mess of this.” Steve ran a frustrated hand through his hair, and when he exhaled his breath smelled like toothpaste and faintly like stomach acid. It should have been the least romantic attempt at winning someone over in history.
“How did you and I meet? In your world?” Being interrupted was getting kind of old, but it was Rhodey, and he had followed up the question by strolling over to steal the remainder of Tony’s drink for himself, and fuck but he’d missed this. Missed the easy camaraderie and the way this Rhodey wasn’t quite so jaded and broken on so many levels.
Tony came almost embarrassingly quickly. The orgasm helped, he could at least feel some of his higher brain functions starting to slowly come back online. But when he fell asleep shortly thereafter, it was with a lingering sense of vague unease.
It didn’t even hurt, not now, the memory of another Steve and Bucky attacking Tony, leaving him stranded and hurt in Siberia. Maybe it was the last remnants off sub-high, but he liked to think it was more than that, like maybe when his recent goodbyes hadn’t just been to the people he missed and loved most in his own world, but to the worst of the pain he’d suffered there too.
Peter held Steve there and screamed until he was hoarse. He shouted accusations and curses and pleas, jumping from one of Steve’s faults to the next with little in the way of logical transition. None of it was anything Steve hadn’t thought of himself in the last several days, but there was still something particularly horrifying about hearing it all laid out by a desperate, broken teenager. (
The ID of Tony's killer might also be an issue for some of you. (This is an even more spoilery note than usual, so skip it if you want to be surprised.) I want to be clear that I don't see Wanda as a one-dimensional villain, and that while I have major problems with her characterization in the MCU, I consider that a fundamental problem with the writing, not with the character herself. My depiction of her here is based on a kind of blend between the intense desire for revenge on Tony that we see in the movies, and the comics' rather more compassionate and nuanced depiction of her as someone who desperately wants to be a good person, but whose powers and mental state are also deeply unstable.
“Alive, barely. He’s careful never to kill, though he’s made promises to everyone he’s gone after about coming back if they don’t give him what he wants.”
Tony should have been grateful to stretch out in his luxurious California King. Not only was it far kinder to his spine to be off the couch, but he was officially relieved of all Cap-watching related duties. Keeping watch over someone whose condition he barely understood had been fucking terrifying even without the added level of it being Rogers’ health and sanity in his hands.
Ah Rhodes. He does, in this universe as in all others, carry most of the Avengers’ collective brain cells. It is a pleasure to deal with his thoughts rather than Rogers’ or Stark’s for a while.
This was about the point where Tony started to feel like a real, Grade-A asshole. All this time he’d been imagining himself in some kind of competition with his alternate self, always being measured and coming up short. And here Steve was, drawing comfort and strength from imagining his current and former partners working together as a team. Tony groaned and covered his face with his hands.
Tony couldn’t stop looking at her collar, and every time an unwelcome feeling of jealousy simmered low in his belly. He’d seen collars on plenty of people out on the street and on television; some of the Switches in the Tower wore them when they were subbing, too. Tony had never felt anything but curiosity (especially when he’d first arrived) and then admiration and respect. He had no idea where the reaction came from. Tony certainly didn’t feel romantically or sexually threatened by Talia; none of the team were the cheating kind, and from the way she was looking at her partner, he very much doubted Talia would have been interested anyway.
“Well, you’d have to help me build it. And get the word out to anyone who might need it.” He didn’t tell her outright that he knew Kamala was in contact with at least three other powered kids. No need to freak her out this early, especially since he had no intentions of making the offer conditional on her bringing all of those people in with her. Instead, he let the thumb of his left hand reach across his palm and seek out the band on his ring finger. (It really had taken zero time for that to become a soothing habit. Being married was awesome.)
No content notes I can think of here, beyond very broad allusions to both Natasha and Bucky's past traumas.
When Clint had returned without Natasha and they’d seen the hollow, shattered look on his face, Steve had welcomed grief like an old friend. He hadn’t tried to convince the team her sacrifice had been worth it, or that now more than ever they needed to commit to this fight to honour her memory. Natasha had been young and smart and vital and strong and now they didn’t even have a body to bury with dignity. Steve didn’t want to find any comfort in that no matter how courageous her actions had been. He was sick of seeking comfort in the cold, empty arms of loss.
“Not around in your universe, I take it? He’s a trained assassin with what he calls photographic reflexes; he can memorize and replicate the movements and traits of anyone he’s fighting. He’s…well, honestly he’s a big pain in the ass. But Tony, I have to ask you again not to go with them.”
“I think there are a lot of things about how all of this happened that many of us would likely change if given the chance,” Phil cut in. He sounded as smooth and even as ever, and Tony had maybe never been more grateful for the idea of having a handler than he was right now. “Certainly several people, myself included, owe Steve an apology for not hearing his concerns sooner. Those conversations are important, and should be prioritized. But in the interest of sorting out some of the most immediate and pressing concerns, I would like to turn our attention to how we might move forward from all of this. Tony, is it still your intention to leave following the press conference?”
was Steve’s idea of a warm up. His Dominant didn’t repeat the question, and the calm authority of that silence was way more affecting than if he’d started screaming or whaling on Tony.
“We shall send another team out at nightfall, then. The King has made it our upmost priority to ensure the safety of the Princess is secured prior to the exhibition.” Okoye was just as fierce and focused as Steve had remembered, though he suspected she was smiling just slightly when she added, “He does not wish to have to refuse her plan outright. He muttered something about incriminating weapons testing footage.” None of the highly disciplined women in the room laughed, but their amusement at the King’s fear of his sister’s reprisal was still plain. The only one who wasn’t smiling, he realized when he finally found her near the front, was Talia.
It took Tony 37 minutes to make it through the first ten levels of SI’s New York headquarters. First, he’d needed to meet Pepper at the entrance, forgoing the private parkade and elevator in favour of a public photo-op cementing return to ‘his’ professional life. After that Pepper had insisted on making the rounds on every floor; Tony was in no way against acknowledging the hundreds of people who made Stark Industries everything it was (hell, he likes most of them way more than the few members of the company he’s usually forced to spend the majority of his time with.) But every floor came with a lengthy round of applause, followed by hugs and handshakes and sobbing from more than one person, and they’re all so goddamn glad to have ‘Tony’ back that before it was even half over the guilt was a piercing, gnawing thing that ate away larger and larger pieces of Tony. Fooling people en masse was comparably easy to the intimacy of lying to those whose livelihoods depended on him. And he couldn’t even reach out to ground himself by occasionally brushing against Pepper, not without risking all of their carefully-laid plans. His only real saving grace was his watch. Today he had selected one with a relatively plain but heavy blue face, and a thick brown leather strap with cream stitching; he wasn’t sure which member of the team this particular piece had come from, but Tony liked the way the width and weight of it made him constantly aware of its presence. It grounded him, the same way that tapping on the arc reactor had once done, reminding him that he was alive and (relatively, at least) safe and not alone.
Tony began to whimper until it choked off into a moan. Bucky was rubbing his hands up and down his chest, rubbing his thumbs in small circles as he went.
Just then the small lump between them began to squirm and a low groan met their ears. They looked down in worry watching to see if Tony was ok. Slowly Tony’s eyes began to flutter open and for the first time in what seemed like too long, a little recognition and a bit of what was pure Tony came back to his chocolatey eyes. Bucky and Steve both smiled down at him when Tony looked at them confusedly.
“But I’m ok!” Steve reassured, “Just caught me off guard is all. Everything you did was perfect baby, absolutely perfect. Thank you for letting us make you feel good.”
It seemed Tony’s face was going to permanently stay this shade of red forever, especially if the dynamic duo kept saying sweet things and invading his personal space. Not that Tony minded, especially if they really meant it.
Tony couldn’t respond, he was watching, mouth agape as Bucky began stripping while Steve was talking. He gulped audibly when Steve quickly followed suit. Tony kept staring as all of those large muscles were put on display. From the quick touches, and creating their uniforms, Tony knew his boyfriends were muscular, he had EYES ok? Seeing their bare chests made him blush harder, but was unable to look away.
“Aye, we have done the Man of Iron a great disservice.” said Thor looking not very Godly at the moment.
“I mean duh? What else could it mean big green and mean?” teased Clint. Bruce threw a pillow in the archers direction which was quickly swatted away by Natasha, the pillow had been aimed poorly.
“Oh, oh OH! Steve! Bucky! Ah!” he sobbed their names into the steamed air the surrounded them like a cloud. His cock sputtering between him and Bucky, making a mess of their fists. He felt Steve’s stuttered thrusts then a burst of warmth against his ass, shortly after Bucky followed, making a mess of Tony’s thighs and lower stomach.
Steve was concentrating on one thing, the pull-up bar and the great deal of pull-ups he was doing, he lost track after two hundred and fifty. What he wasn’t expecting was at that moment for Bucky and Clint to burst into the room.
Steve finally undressed and sadly watching the exchange, stepped into the water and sitting as close to Tony and Bucky as he could, taking Tony’s feet into his lap and rubbing slowly at the soles in an attempt to comfort him.
Tony squeaked, pulling the covers up and over his head. He wanted to thank his lovers. If they didn’t kill him first.
Looking into the camera with those big eyes was little Tony. His whole face was lit up in excitement obviously caused by the knowledge that his Aunt was here to see him. What had gotten Clint to call out was what Tony was wearing. He seemed to be wearing a large shirt, and upon closer inspection looked more like something a woman would wear, and looked more like a dress going by the straps and lace. Adorning Tony’s small wrists were expensive looking bracelets and around his neck hung a string of pearls that was almost too big for the boy and was slipping off one of his shoulders. Lipstick was smeared all over his face and in one of his hands he held what must have been a purse. All of the things Tony had must have belonged to his mother.
Steve leaned down to give Tony’s face another lingering kiss, “Get some rest sweetheart, we’ll watch over you, don’t worry, we’ll take care of you.”
Steve pulled back with a moan, “That’s right baby, we can take it as slow as you want. We won’t lie, we want you so bad it hurts. But we can take it slow, for you.”
Bucky moaned sending shockwaves through Tony when he clenched around his tongue. Tony sobbed. The sensations were too much. Steve sucking roughly then sliding his mouth up until just the tip rested inside, suckling softly. It was driving Tony mad. The two older men continued to torment Tony, building up a rhythm. Bucky would plunge his tongue inside, as deep as he could go, while Steve would suck on the head, driving Tony insane. Then they would switch. Steve would be sucking him in deep, his cock nudging the back of his throat, while Bucky gave torturous little kitten licks all around his hole, not giving him what he desired. It was as if they rehearsed it. His soldiers were so in sync with each other, they were surely going to kill him.
“Shut up, gang green,” muttered Tony, face heating up even more. Bruce chuckled and turned back to the screen. Not wanting to miss a second of baby Tony.
Steve and Bucky stared at him, waiting patiently for an answer. Tony blinked and looked up at them owlishly. “M’head hurts...nd’m’cold...started a’lil while ago….JARVIS?” Steve and Bucky both winced at the obvious hoarseness of his voice. Sore throat.
It felt like they had been pleasuring him for days, years. It all started to become too much. Overwhelmed, he began to shake. He felt the familiar hot pressure building inside him and knew he was close.
Natasha gave him the side eye, “You’re lucky I like you Banner.” Bruce chuckled raising his hands showing he meant no harm to the deadly woman with knives. So many knives.
Luckily the team came home with only a few small scrapes and bruises and a shared agreement of never wanting to eat apple strudels again. The villain was easily disposed of.  The only major issue had been Tony. Iron Man had been doing his duty, firing repulsor blasts at the beasts when one of those mutant fruit bats swooped out of the air grabbing him in it’s feet and in doing so pierced a large hole into the armor. Iron Man was safe, but when he freed himself he was then exposed to the harsh fall weather. Nobody had thought twice about it. Steve and Bucky initially panicking, but after checking on him and finding him unharmed besides being a little damp from where the rain had gotten into the armor, had quickly calmed.
Tony had no idea what he should do. He was torn between thrusting his hips forward or backwards into his lovers talented mouth’s. He continued to whimper and writhe between his lovers, sobbing out each breathe. He could feel tears clinging to his eyelashes, but he could care less. This was an exquisite torture.
The anger in him seemed to drain out quickly. He slumped on his workbench, laying his head back down onto the table. He may not be as furious as he was when he stumbled in on their little movie night, but it didn’t mean he was ready to talk to any of them yet. If he did he would risk talks with feelings in them. Tony shuddered at the thought.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, hands reaching blindly for purchase. Steve watching on in amusement reached out and took his smaller lovers hand in his own, giving the back a kiss.
Just then the Avengers heard the elevator ding. Turning their heads the doors open and they were met with the smug looks of two large soldiers and one timid happy look from their small genius. Looking down the Avengers noticed all three of them were holding hands.
Steve chuckled, “Be careful Tony, Bucky has a wicked mouth and has been waiting forever to use it on ya. He may not hold back.”
“Oh yeah. But if you think I’m lyin, get your blonde ass down here and have a taste, or better yet.”
The scene ended and time seemed to have moved on as the Tony on screen wasn’t exactly a baby anymore, but the boy on screen was still so small and still had some of his baby fat on his limbs. The boy was walking on unsteady feet around the room and oh, this time it was Steve’s turn to grab his chest with an almost pained grunt. Little Tony was wearing a Captain America onesie. The onesie had short sleeves and shorts that showed the boys chubby arms and legs. The ensemble also had a hood that was up and covering the boy's head, with wings that matched the ones on his cowl perfectly. There was a collective “aw” from the group gathered and a few snickers at the coincidence.
Steve kneeled down, sliding his hand across Tony’s cheek. “Come on baby, open up those pretty eyes for me, yeah?” Steve continued his soft caress of Tony’s cheek watching intently as his eyes fluttered open to stare at Steve, bright with fever. “There you are sweetheart. I need you to open up your mouth and swallow these pills for me, it’ll help with your fever.”
“Jesus, Buck!” Steve laughed, “I don’t know if he’s ready for your mouth yet, we want him alive, not dead,” he smirked.
Tony squirmed, his dream had felt so real, so good. His cock twitched in interest, his hips canting towards the warmth at his front, his cock rubbing with delicious friction. He mewled in pleasure, his hips rocking slowly.
Ok, so I'm back with a new chapter. I think if I get inspired enough I'll come back and add chapters? So maybe this fic will keep growing? Who knows. Also I'm a huge Disney sap and this song instantly made me think baby Tony. I also totally believe Tony is a musical genius. That's my headcannon. So enjoy this new chapter. Let me know if its cute. I literally just hashed it out. Mot entirely sure how I feel about it.
“Dah, dah dah daahhh! Welcome to the Tony and Jarvis cooking show!” On screen was Jarvis and he was waving his hands in excitement. Next to him was a small boy jumping up and down.
“I completely agree, and look how sweet our boy is, he has this big ‘ol tub and filled it with sweet water. Added bonus, what a sweetheart, he’s in the tub too.”
Heeeeyyyyyyy.......how's everyone doing? Good, good. Yeah so it's been quite a while! I'm sorry for that. Life got busy and I didn't have time to finish! Yes! this is the last chapter I hope it good enough and doesn't leave too many people upset.
Without so much as a grunt, Steve shifted one arm underneath Tony’s thighs and kept the other on his cock and lifted him out of the water, exposing him to Bucky’s gaze as he stroked. Tony whimpered in embarrassment.
Welllll? Hope was decent haha. Any ideas on what you want baby Tony to do next, leave them in the comments~
“Hm,” came the voice behind the camera, his next words sounding like he was smiling, “Captain America, I dare say you should check over by this pile of blankets, it looks very suspicious, perhaps Bucky Bear is trapped inside.”
All tony could do was mewl in response as Bucky began to suck on the head of his cock making Tony squirm. Bucky grabbed onto his hips keeping him steady.
Steve grinned “So, can we take it that you’ve forgiven us for watching the videos without your permission?”.
The soldiers looked on expectantly for the smaller man to answer, waiting patiently and not pushing for answers.
“So does this mean we need to put the videos away?” asked Clint. Everyone looked to Tony waiting to see what he would say. Tony smirked, “Nah, but I get final say in what we can and can’t watch? You got it?” Cheers echoed through the room as everyone frantically ran back to their spots. Bucky and Steve dragging Tony over to their couch, making room for him in the middle. Tony had never been so happy.
“Alright Stevie, help me get his clothes off, the tub is just about filled.” Bucky sat Tony up a little more and leaned him towards Steve giving Bucky better access to take his shirt off. Once the shirt was removed they maneuvered Tony back against Bucky so he could lift his hips as Steve slipped off his socks, boxers and pants. Tony shivered once his heated skin was exposed to the what seemed like freezing air.
“Buck, what do we do? His temp is getting too high, I mean, what happens when it gets too high? He’ll have to go to the hospital and-”
“Make it a good one Steve! Preferably baby Tony. I’m still sufferin from diabetes over here and am one hundred percent ok with that.” replied Bucky.
‘His throat must really be bothering him,’ thought Steve. Both soldiers leaned in and kissed Tony on his face, praising him and thanking him.
“Fight fair Marie!” yelled little Tony as he too disappeared down the hallway. The screen cut to black.
Steve took his time looking through the selection of videos making sure he would pick the perfect video. His eyes caught one title called “The Tony and Jarvis cooking show.” Intrigued by the possible cuteness, Steve chose the video and quickly showed it to Tony for approval. Once Tony gave him a short nod, Steve placed it into the machine.
“You can always tell us how you feel, you don’t need’ta be scared. Not ever. Also,” Bucky began rubbing his hands up and down Tony’s arms making him shudder. “We can always work on building your experience.”
“Alright then,” whispered Bucky. He pulled back, reaching down to the shirt Tony was wearing and grabbed onto the hem, lifting it up exposing Tony’s lithe body. Tony blushed even harder. They were both staring at him! The mortification became too much and he tried sneaking his hands down to cover his sex.
“I repeat! What the FUCK is going on?” He yelled, “Does no one believe in personal boundaries, consent or thoughts of others anymore? Who said you people could watch these? Watching Howard-” his voice cracked and his hard mask of fury seemed to falter into something the Avengers couldn’t quite place. “Watching all of this garbage.”
Everyone’s hands shot up, Tony almost standing all the way up on the couch to show his true feelings for his childhood ‘friend’.
“I bet you are,” Natasha replied giving Bucky and Steve a knowing look. They both blushed slightly, Bucky grumbling something under his breath that Steve wouldn’t even dare say aloud for fear of his life and Bucky’s and pressed play.
Tony shuddered. Steve leaned down to bump noses with Tony. “He’s right sweetheart. We’re head over heels for ya and we want you to be our fella. No joke.”
Steve leaned down so his mouth was next to Tony’s ear, “Sweetheart you’re not too bad at the piano. In fact I feel like most four year olds couldn’t play the piano like you could.” whispered Steve. Tony smiled again and snuggled into Steve’s shoulder.
The Avengers jumped again at the harsh tone of the man’s voice. To their surprise around the corner walked in none other than Howard Stark. On screen Tony winced and seemed to draw closer around himself, something a boy of two should not know how to do.
“Oh like hell you were! You’re all knowing and all seeing! You’re just a traitor laying in wait to watch your creator suffer. You masochist.”
“That’s right Tony, I’ve missed you so much my heart aches. Where is my sweet little boy?” replied Peggy.
“Steve, oh god, come ‘ere, come ‘ere.” Bucky urgently grabbed onto Steve’s bicep and dragged him so that they were both smooshed together by Tony’s legs. There was a pause, then Steve let out a low groan of want.
Bucky chuckled, “I know, I know. Take it slow. Can you blame me though? He’s too sweet for me not to want to wreck him.”
“Ok, good, now I’m going to pass him to you Steve while I get undressed. Once I’m done I’ll get in with him then you can strip.” Steve nodded and accepted his poor sick lover into his arms, noticing how sweaty the fever was making him. Bucky stripped quickly, grabbing Tony back and slowly stepping into the bath as Steve stripped.
Steve reached up, carding his fingers through Tony’s hair, “Tony, sweetheart is everything ok?” They got another whimper, almost sounding like a groan, but nothing else.
Steve leaned down to press his lips against Tony’s forehead, leaving them there in a silent worry for his temperature. If it got higher again, Steve would know. Bucky maneuvering closer as to wrap a broad arm around Tony’s waist, letting his hand rest on Steve’s hip.
Steve smiled, “Tony, we don’t want you to be scared of us, and we want you to answer truthfully. Baby, are you a virgin?”
The soldiers began getting ready for bed as Tony slept on. The silence comforting and companionable.
Tony groaned pitifully and turned his head away, eyes squeezing shut. Steve and Bucky both sighed. Getting Tony to take something that was good for him was never an easy task, both of them had been hoping it wouldn’t be like that this time. Bucky reached down and started to slowly rub Tony’s stomach.
He was pulled out of his thoughts when he heard the water shut off and heard his lovers talking to one another.
Just as fast as he had come, his body gave out as if all the strings that were keeping him up had been cut. He heard Steve grunt but was too exhausted to care as to why. He felt two warm hands grab and lift his hips. He heard someone snickering. Finally curiosity won out and he peaked open one eye to see what was so funny.
“Bucky’s right. We got too distracted with the idea of watching videos of you when you were little. I mean- can you blame us? You were adorable.”
Bucky pouted dramatically, but did as he was told, dragging his feet into the bathroom. Steve laughed at Bucky’s misfortune and leaned in to steal a kiss from the smaller brunette but was stopped by a finger on his lips.
They sat there in the water. The three men breathing deeply, trying to calm their beating hearts. Tony layed there on Steve’s lap, completely wrung out, leaning his head against his big shoulder, letting his eyes slip closed.
Steve glared at Bucky but carefully slid Tony’s feet off his lap. Tony himself had fallen asleep during his full body massage. Standing up Steve stepped out of the tub and grabbed the biggest, fluffiest towel they owned. With Tony in his arms Bucky stood carefully and handed him over to Steve to be dried.
Bucky ‘mmmed; in agreement. “Boy, Cap, I don’t know about you, but that mission kicked my ass, I could sure use a nice soak in the tub, get all relaxed and wet.”
Finally little Tony got himself situated at the piano and then began to slowly crack each finger to prepare himself to play. Making the little girl look on in disgust.
Bucky and Steve shared a look. Tony wouldn’t look at them and they both could feel his minute shivering. Slowly the pieces started falling into place and the stared at each other, panicked.
“Next, need sauce!” Jarvis placed a small bowl in front of Tony and handed him a small spatula. Little Tony lifted the bowl and dumped the entire bowl’s contents into the middle of the dough, making the group laugh.
Tony thought for a moment. Steve and Bucky, as well as the rest of the team seemed to really be enjoying the videos. And if Tony was being honest with himself, he did too. He felt constantly warm with the compliments and adorations for his baby self. He felt loved. With a shake of his head Tony made his choice.
“Does that feel good baby?” voice ghosting over Tony’s ear, feeling him shudder. “You have no idea how hot it makes me, knowing no ones ever touched you like this,” Steve emphasized it with a tight squeeze, making the boys hips move erratically. Steve chuckled.
Tony sat down heavily on his workbench. He let his head drop down onto the table and just closed his eyes. He didn’t want to panic over this. This was not something to panic over, he kept telling himself. He started taking slow deep breathes to calm himself down. He concentrated on his deep breathing and instead of on the creeping feeling of tootightchestnoaircan’tbreatheHELPgoingtodie. Bucky and Steve convinced him to go see a therapist to help with his panic attacks. He really hadn’t wanted to go, now though he was glad he did.
They both jumped apart and blushed slightly at being caught. Natasha, the one who called them out, smirked.
With those past few days behind them Bucky and Steve relished in their time alone, although having their third locked away left a space only a certain genius could fill. They could be patient. Tony would come back to them once he was finished. He always did.
Tony climbed back up to the head of the bed and resituated himself onto the pillows. He may be overreacting but he did love his soldiers. To do something like this for him without judgement...meant a lot to him. Somehow he wanted to show his thanks to them.
Carefully standing up and aware of their precious bundle, the soldiers stepped out of the bathtub and dried off their smaller lover. Once dry, Bucky took out one of his and Steve’s shirts and helped maneuver Tony into it. Tony was so small compared to them that the shirt easily covered the top of his ass and reached just the top of his thighs. A possessive thrill ran through him at the image Tony presented. He heard a snort and turned to look at Steve who was smirking knowingly at him. As if he could read the thoughts that were going through his mind.
“He’s right Tony, we all should have come to ask you to watch these, it was wrong of us.” Bruce added. A chorus of ‘I’m sorry’s echoed in the room and everyone looked to Tony, guilt all over their faces. They never wanted to hurt their friend.
“Great you found the pills. Fill a cup and then take out two of those and have him swallow them. Then help me get him out of his clothes.” As Bucky held Tony up Steve approached with the pills and the glass of water. Tony’s eyes were closed, he almost looked asleep if it weren’t for the small whimpers he was making. He must have really felt terrible.
“There’s your beautiful brown bambi eyes,” crooned Bucky as he slowly ran his fingers in the brunets short curls, making the smaller man mewl softly.
“Hey! Tony, calm down, don’t worry,” Steve said jostling him gently to get him out of his head. “You’re not ready for that yet and that’s ok. We’ll just use our hands. Is that ok with you baby?”
“Poor thing,” Bucky murmured, slowly stroking Tony’s hair. Tony nuzzled into the touch like a kitten, misery clearly written on his features.
Steve and Bucky were sitting cuddled together on the couch, shoulders and knees pressed together, hands entwined, watching some sort of action movie. The two of them snickering at the horrible fight scenes and the inaccuracies. They loved watching action movies together as they always made fun of them, the both of them ending up as a big pile of giggling fools. Today was no different as they had quickly fallen into giggling fits. It was a dreary fall day. It had been raining for the past few days, with the rain brought and unbearable chill to the air. It had been absolutely awful the past few days and unfortunately the supersoldiers and their team weren’t lucky enough to have spent those days inside where it was warm and dry.
With those words Tony snuggled closer to the muscled chest in front of him and back against the muscled chest behind him, one hand reaching up to grab at Steve’s shirt and the other gravitating up to place his hand over Bucky’s at Steve’s hip.
Both supersoldiers groaned, “Buck-Bucky! I can’t! I can’t take this anymore!” Steve groaned while clutching his chest. Bucky looked sympathetically over at his boyfriend, patting him on the shoulder in a comforting gesture. Bucky wasn’t fairing much better. How could one child be this adorable? It had to go against some sort of law. This was a deadly force. On screen both women tried to muffle their laughter. Sounding out of breath Maria was the first to speak.
“Yeah, you kinda were baby,” said Bucky. Tony pouted up at the taller man. Making Bucky smile fondly and lean down to place another kiss on those pouty lips.
“Sir began developing a fever about an hour ago, although it only began to become a problem about ffteen minutes ago. He stopped working and headed upstairs to you both when he could no longer work.”
“Y-yes, I-I’m a virgin,” Tony whispered. He squeezed his eyes shut in a futile attempt to protect himself from the words his lover would surely spit at him. What he didn’t expect were the twin moans of want.
“I can’t believe you guys! I thought we were friends. You don’t see me going through your stuff or asking JARVIS to spy on you. In fact, JARVIS? Why are these guys watching these videos? You gave them access?”
Little Tony lifted his leg up onto the piano bench as it was quite far off the ground and slowly and clumsily pulled himself onto his belly.
“I, uh-” he stopped to clear his throat, grimacing at the obvious pain it caused him, “yeah, uh, I feel a little better,” he murmured. “ You guys took real good care of me.”
“Don’t you ‘Tony’ me! I’m still angry at all of you and would like to continue my time alone in the lab without any nosey supersoldiers who like to stick their noses into other people’s personal belongings!”
Tony shook his head to get rid of his pinning thoughts for the resident hotties. It hurt just that bit more to know Bucky and Steve watched those videos too. Bucky even helped find them. He was going to work down here for the next few days. He didn’t care if it was an “unhealthy coping mechanism” it works so he’s sticking to it. Even though Bucky and Steve always get worried…
“Steve!” Bucky cut off Steve’s panicked rambling, “Steve, it’s gonna be ok, yes the fever is high but we don’t need to panic yet ok? I want you to go to the kitchen and find some ibuprofen, it’ll help with the fever. I’ll take Tony to the bathroom.”
“Show Javis?” Tony looked up at the women shyly through his lashes. He still looked like he was unsure and his lip was still wobbling a little.
“Are we allowed to watch those? I mean Tony is kind of a private guy.” Steve ever the gentlemen wanted to respect his friend’s (and crushes) boundaries. What? Steve wasn’t blind ok? Tony was an attractive guy and the ass on that man. Could you blame him for looking (staring longingly) at it? Steve would feel bad about it if he hadn’t caught Bucky doing the exact same thing. The conversation and events after were something to remember. Both had come to the agreement that they both wanted the genius and if said genius was amiable, well then, their partnership would be legendary. However, getting the genius alone, away from work and the superhero business and actually sit down and talk about feelings was a whole different battle entirely. Meaning that the two supersoldiers were having no luck whatsoever.
“Anthony, when I call your name I expect you to come! Are you literally too much of an idiot child to understand that? My god boy!”
Tony could only pant to catch his breath. He had never felt something so warm and wet and perfect around his cock before. He was embarrassed, but he felt like if Bucky hadn’t stopped, he would have lost it, ending quickly.
“He’s right Tones, never seen a more pretty sight.” Bucky leaned in for a kiss. Tony was charmed and leaned in to kiss his lover back before he remembered the situation he had found himself in. Scandalized, he shoved at Bucky as hard as he could. Bucky being completely caught off guard lurched backwards and fell off the side of the bed, thus sending his other lover into hysterics.
The camera went black causing an outrage to the viewers, all except big Tony who only rolled his eyes at his team.
Steve stood up from the couch, ignoring Tony’s whine of disapproval. “Ok, so Clint got to choose this one, I want to choose next!” yelled Steve
