Now the little person who had crept into his heart was being taken away and there was nothing he could do about it.
Evenings like these are so very few and far between John reflected as he settled in his chair, a cup of tea by his side and the remote in his hand. Rosie had gone down easily, worn out by her day at nursery. Mrs Hudson was at her book club; Sherlock was off on a case with Hopkins hours ago and John had Baker Street to himself.
It is no laughing matter to be chastised by an angel, Crowley reminded himself as he tried to keep a straight face under the onslaught of Aziraphale’s wrath. The problem was that although he had started out as the Angel of the Eastern gate, complete with flaming sword, Aziraphale’s manifestation of anger amounted to no more than a pout, and a great deal of sighing interspersed with a few tuts.
He rings for the messenger and sends a card, partakes of elevenses, then luncheon in the hour before his visitor arrives.
“It is ironic, I do have scruples, it has taken nearly eight years for us to get to point where we’re both on the same page and now you’re a married man.”
John thought as he quickly climbed the stairs to the little bedroom that had been carved out of the loft space on the second floor.
“Dinah Shepherd?” John asked Sherlock tentatively as they sat together in the back a cab on their way to Scotland Yard.
Mrs Hudson was referring to the tall, brown haired man, standing close behind Molly, holding a medium size organ transportation box tightly in both hands.
"I...am sorry, dear friend. But I examined the necklace and have given my statement. My reputation is now in the-" I could stop myself before the word "capable" could escape me. He would not have believed me, had I used it. "-in the hands of Scotland Yard."
Had I been aware of the true meaning of his words, I would have been able to hear the underlying gratification in them. It is no use dwelling on what could have been however. Ones time is better employed considering what has been, and what can be learned from it. I have done just that, and learned never to underestimate my Watson, for, had I payed more attention to his concerns about Farley's slander, both of us would have been spared a great deal of pain. But as it stood, I made the mistake of simply writing off his remark as superficial politeness.
I could hardly complain, for the landscape, changed as it was, had not lost its beauty. The thick, white fog, and the glistening frost covering the grass beneath our feet as we walked, made the grounds feel mysterious- as if the entrance to Avalone had opened up right before our eyes, leading us into a distant, hazy past.
My friend, however, refused to let go of the subject once again. A discussion erupted, over who might be to blame for the unjust mistreatment of my name, during which my eyes kept darting demonstratively at the clock.
“No. His scare visits were rather a consequence of his work. The young man is employed within the Royal Archives, which leaves him with little spare time.”
“See here, Watson, footprints often provide more vital information than the very best of informants.”
His eyes had drifted back inside and fallen upon an advert for biscuits in the newspaper on the floor in front of him. It showed a fanciful depiction of the future, with flying police, an hôtel on rails and people walking on water. It was ridiculous. Hardly reason enough to yield to gloom.
"Watson, I have just discovered a new field of study. I really wonder how it has escaped me for so long! I think I shall write a monograph upon the subject as soon as we return to Baker Street." he muttered at long last.
"Well, what about earlier this evening. Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary? You are the page after all."
I was glad to hear it was not the case, for it made my partner more human than he liked to present himself in public.
Soon the butler, whose name I learned was Huntley, made another entrance in order to serve the aperitifs. Inevitably, the conversation moved to all things India, whence Trevor and White had only recently returned.  The two of them were very pleasant company- even White, who had appeared so quiet at first glance, soon partook in the conversation wholeheartedly.
For a moment I considered remarking upon it, but decided it was better to remain silent. Instead, I pulled a book from my waistcoat pocket, and began to read.
While I beamed at the opportunity, Holmes merely forced a polite smile which faded into a deep frown as soon as he turned around.
I awoke the next morining unaware of where I was. My drowsy brain convinced me all was as it should be, and that I had fallen asleep on the sofa in our Baker Street lodgings again. As the vague memory of my nightly visions began to fade, reality returned in its stead. I understood then, that I had fallen asleep on the divan in Holmes' hotel room. The journey must have exhausted me in such a way, I had no memory of falling asleep- nor of loosening my collar or fetching a blanket.
I believe I speak for the both of us when I say I we were happy to return to our compartment. While our little game in the dining car had been amusing, we preferred to travel in companionable solitude.
"I am afraid I cannot tell you. Everything that happened tonight has happened in order to avoid a scandal. It is within our best interest to keep it that way. I must therefore ask all of you to return home."
“His shoes! Watson, his shoes are missing!” The familiar excitement of the chase finally got hold of me. It made my entire body tingle with electricity.
This rule has become quite dear to me, as it is very useful to make others think something which might deviate from reality.
The door swung open, and out came Holmes, shrouded in a heavy, hooded cloak, and sporting a black, pointed hat like those witches wear in the children's books.
And with that, the Reverend broke into a sprint straight for the door. I no longer cared, as I had found what I had searched for- Watson  however, was another matter. As long as the extent of the danger we were facing was unknown to me, I had to make certain he knew as little about the whole affair as possible. I sent him chasing after the wayward cleric in order to finish my work discreetly, but he returned sooner than I had anticipated- out of breath and clearly upset. Not a minute was to be lost, as the police were likely to arrive any moment.
Well, the rest of the day was spent much like the last: with dinner, good conversation, and a taste of Mr. White's musical talents to top it all off.
Watson would perhaps describe the room as “tranquil and flooded with warm light”, but such poetic descriptions, as charming as they may be, are irrelevant to me. Instead, I focused on anything out of the ordinary. Two things in particular stood out from the rest of the room:
Part of me hoped, that all of this was nothing more than another night-terror, and that I would awake one day to be greeted by the scent of his tobacco seeping in from the living-room.
A strong scent of chemicals clung to it, but I was unable to identity the mixture solely based on that. It would have to be analysed in Baker Street.
"What? In that case, I must ask you to leave. I must get in touch with the authorities without further delay!"
Never before, and never thereafter have I seen him partake in any social event with the same enthusiasm as on the evening of October 31st 1887.
"All due respect, sir- if I see a man stare back at me like that, with his head bashed..., I ken that I'm looking at a dead man."
Holmes examined the stairs and the carpet above and beneath, but was unable to identify any feminine footsteps.
"Good. Good. Well look for that confounded man Huntley and send him my way. But first, go and search the house for the woman. The doors are locked, so she can't have come very far."
The atmosphere turned cold as ice in an instant, and an eerie silence settled over us. The fear among those men-myself included- was palpable. Everyone knew that not a single woman resided in this house- not even the usual maids. A female scream meant an intruder had entered- which in turn could only mean exposure.
I collected a scalpel from a side table and pocketed it with the rest of the evidence. Watson had been right.
"Yes, yes of course...but..come in." the Reverend stepped aside. A moment's relief washed over me, allowing me to hope that for once my conclusions were faulty. Well, it is justified to say that, in some way, they were- in that the sight which presented itself to us was much worse than anything I had seen throughout nearly two decades in my profession.
"Very well." I was not pleased by this sort of secrecy, but I knew my companion well enough to be conscious of his love for the dramatic.
Another sigh. “I know, I know. I can see that now, though I cannot make any promises. My work is everything to me, you know that.”
In the sitting room of 221b Baker Street, chairs pushed out of the way, rug rolled up and the sound of Danny Williams singing
“Or too young” Mrs Turner, who Mummy had handed Rosie to when Mycroft arrived, replied, kissing the top of the toddler’s head.
This Friday was going to be different; John knew that even before the phone call that woke him up just after six in the morning. Not just that it was the last Friday before Christmas, and all the pandemonium that that entailed but also that, as had been announced just two weeks ago, it was the day before Greg’s wedding.
“Its great for the craic but I’ll warn you I’m meeting my friend Mary and it’ll be wedding talk, Mary’s getting married in August and I’m her maid of honour.”
“That’s what I mean. I know him, could you tell him I’ll be ten minutes and ask him to wait outside.”
“Who?” But alert to the fact Mrs Hudson had given a little squeal, Sherlock added, “Perhaps you might elucidate.”
Sherlock’s first client of the morning was an overweight man of medium height with an unhealthy colour and a wheezy cough.
John waited a good fifteen minutes for Greg to come to the phone, but the faint hope that the officer was not in fact in the hotel but rather on the overnight train to Euston was dissipated by the sound of Greg’s voice. If John had thought that he was down, then Greg was a whole new ball game.
Somersby and his two colleagues carried the unconscious Sherlock up the two flights of stairs to his room and dumped him unceremoniously on the bed. John thanked them and let them go. He slipped off Sherlock’s shoes and loosened his belt before rolling him onto his side in the prone position and covering him with the duvet. Sherlock immediately began to snore.
I could picture him with painful vivacity. The pale moonlight outlining his slender body complimented by his favourite red morning gown, and the first pink rays of sunshine softening his sharp features.
We were offered cocktails from one of the serving-boys, and then set out to find our hosts. It was quite the task, considering  the mass of masks, extravagant hats, and false beards, rubbing shoulders on the premises. Unsurprisingly, it was Holmes who spotted Trevor.
“I am certain you have read the rural origins in the redness of her cheeks. No paint could produce so natural an effect. The dress speaks of wealth- as you have correctly observed. It is her behaviour which really gives her away. No lady from a good home would slouch in such a way.”
The morning came, and the sun rose. Drenched in sweat, and eyes reddened with involuntary tears I made my final decision: I needed explanations or I would go mad. Another day of going between disdain and pity for my friend, and I was certain to lose my mind. Rather than spending another sleepless night, wondering what might have happened; perhaps tortured with crippling uncertainty and unable to trust any human soul again until the end of my days, I needed to go and find out for myself. Above all, I needed to know whether Sherlock Holmes was innocent.
“Well, then allow me to provide an even more fulfilling ending to this day...” With that, he took my hand gently in his, and stepped closer in order to press a gentle kiss onto my mouth.
“But these prints were made by two different men, as one pair is size 9, whereas the other is half a size larger.”
“I am a gentleman, and it would distress me to be obliged to pass this correspondence across to your superiors...”
“And twice has she waved for the waiter-” Holmes continued.  “-which speaks, as you will no doubt agree, of very little etiquette. This, again, leads me to the final surmise I have made: the family's rise to wealth having been recent. She has not yet had occasion to learn the adequate mannerisms of her new status.”
Finally, the day we had all been waiting for arrived. It had been clear from the moment Holmes and I went down to breakfast, that the tensions which had been building among the staff had severely increased. The usually quiet house had come alive with nervous energy. Constant orders from the Butler, and other instructions were to be heard. Decorations were being hung on the walls, doors were open and closed in a never-ending stream of motion, and the smell of various dishes- sweet and savoury alike- filled the atmosphere even before luncheon.
Too often had I scrambled into his chamber in the middle of the night, frantically calling his name, foolishly hoping to find him standing there, smiling, or rolling his eyes at my emotional entrance- only to be met with a ghostly emptiness, which reflected the state of my sinking heart.
I looked at my friend and saw his narrowed eyes and pursed lips. Even he was not immune to the sheer fascination the man exuded.
"Gentlemen- all is well. There will be no scandal. We are safe." A wave of visible relief passed through the attendees.
I felt a cool hand wrap around mine upon settling down next to him. Even on the third day there this sort of freedom felt strange to the point of being uncomfortable. Holmes didn't seem to care.
“Suffice it to say, that the arrangement predates you, dear fellow. Our companionship hardly lasted six months, and ended with me having found a profession, and him selling his house and leaving for India.”
"As entertaining as the idea may be, I am afraid we must settle for something more conventional." his steel-grey eyes met mine. "In fact, I have taken the liberty to consult someone who agreed to help us out of this crisis, Watson. I hope you will forgive me for choosing a costume for you."
The game however remains on. The crime has Moriarty’s fingerprints all over it, the pursuit of the jewel implies that Sherlock was not as successful in eliminating the consulting criminal’s entire cohort as he supposed. One remains and Sherlock rises to the challenge. Craig gives him the low down on how six identical heads of some politician who is unaccountably collectable arrived in England and the plot thickens. Five are destroy and a woman is dead. Sherlock takes himself to Reading to skulk in the undergrowth and await developments. He does not have to wait long.
Still another forty-eight hours and he was out of here, back to London, and his bride to be. Dinah was a wonderful woman, Lestrade still couldn’t quite believe she was going to be his wife, his feet hadn’t touched the ground since he’d met her.
Rosie had finished her breakfast and was now wriggling to get down. John took her upstairs to get her dressed and ready for her excursion with Mrs Hudson. In the early days of parenthood, he, and Mary, had determined not to dress their little one in gender stereotypical colours. However, Rosie did show a marked preference for pink, and now purple. John mused to himself, as he dressed his daughter in her mauve dungarees, on what that said about nature versus nurture.
John felt uncomfortable, and started to apologise for the lack of contact but Sherlock shut him up, unconsciously echoing Mrs Hudson, “Well you are here now.”
The soldier thought for a moment, as he had very little of value that hadn’t already been sold by Harry to fund her drinking habit. “My dog tags,” he said at last. The stranger took the dog tags, and then he said.
“Well, there you are then, that’s your answer. You need to get this Dr Watson back on cases with your detective, show him what he is missing.”
“I understand the need to stir, although I cannot see why you need my assistance, it is your hip that troubles you not your wrist. But why you wish me to engage in some superstitious ritual while doing so is beyond me.”
The standoff continued, jeans were out, the Aran jumper too obvious, finally they compromised on a pair of tailored corduroys, a plaid shirt and a leather jacket.
The seagulls were a nuisance though and Sherlock, who had soon had enough of defending his chips from the birds, began to think about returning to the cabin. It was in the evenings that he missed London most, spending the nights walking its streets, learning the city by heart. This reflection turned his thoughts again to Mary Sutherland; the only Lyon Place he knew of was just off Berkley Square, but it seemed unlikely that the family would occupy such a desirable address, not on their collective income.
Greg looked shocked, “What? Dinah is a tour de force, John, you don’t stand in her way, when she wants something she just goes right on and gets it. I just can’t believe that she’s settling for me.”
They left the warmth of the gamekeeper’s cottage and walked down the lane to the place where André Cloete had died. As Sherlock had feared, there was little left to be discovered from the site, what hadn’t already been destroyed by the heavy-footed constabulary had been obliterated by the snow.
The three men sat in silence, in the distance a clock struck, and a bell rang but otherwise all was quiet. Then finally the Duke spoke again.
Culverton Smith, every time you turn on your television there he is. If he isn’t selling you your breakfast he’s opening a hospital, killing a business or being honoured by Her Majesty. In the same week this man did Question Time, Songs of Praise and Sport Relief. The only thing he hasn’t done is Strictly.
John insisted he was perfectly fine. He was hungry, tired and dirty, no doubt he would have nightmares for a week or two but otherwise he was perfectly fine. And he said so, several times. Steve produced a flask of tea from his holdall in the truck, Danny sacrifice his Mars Bar, and Sherlock held back from interrogating John until he had eaten and drunk both and was seated in the back seat of the truck with him, as Steve pulled away from the Ragged Shaw to head back to the road.
He quickly put together a decent supply of clean clothes for a week away, toiletries, laptop and chargers, and then sat down to telephone his intended.
“Dr Watson, Mr Holmes, it was a pleasure to meet you again. I will have my assistant call you regarding your suits.”
It was clear that Tony Aveling didn’t want to hang about, and Sherlock had to concede that despite the torches and the light of the moon there were limits to how far even he could investigate in the dark.
“To be honest, although it was incredibly painful, saying the words out loud was cathartic” she pauses and then adds “You should try it sometime”
As soon as Ralph had left, Sherlock had said something about getting changed and disappeared into his bedroom. John opened his mouth to protest, he was here to dance, and Sherlock was dressed for dancing, but he changed his mind; he had seen Sherlock in all manner of guises, from bespoke suits to pyjamas but the dancewear was a new experience entirely, he looked young, athletic and something else entirely. It was probably a good thing that Sherlock was going to change, he was altogether to distracting dressed like a kid from
Aveling was standing close behind him, “can I help you at all, are you looking for anything in particular?”
As it turned out Sherlock had plenty of time, as soon as he saw his client disappear into the house, Sherlock slipped round the back under cover of darkness, hopped over the fence and forced the basement kitchen window. He stealthily climbed the back stairs and made his way along the landing to the master bedroom. The drawer of the dressing table was unlocked, it was an old piece which had no doubt lost its key years ago. Sherlock reached in and took out the jewellery box.
“What’s that got to do with anything?” answered the soldier, "What’s the point of surviving a war if the Queen demands I spin gold out of straw and will take my life if I don’t do it.”
, the sentiment is stuck in his head, unworthy of the rational mind but remarkably persistent. Sherlock smiles, the British Museum, right on his doorstep.
“Flat B just isn’t big enough, Greg, not for the three of us. Rosie comes with a lot of baggage for such a small person, and for someone who lost most of their possessions eighteen months ago Sherlock’s not been slow in making up lost ground. I’m sharing a bedroom with my two-year-old daughter, who just so happens to sleep like a cat. We none of us have enough space. If Sherlock and I were sharing a room, then maybe we might have managed… but if that isn’t going to happen then I need to find somewhere bigger for the two of us, and I need to do that before Rosie gets even more attached to Sherlock than she is now.”
John picked up his phone and dialled the number that he had cajoled out of Hopkins earlier, it rang a couple of times before a man with a broad Scottish accent answered, “Heart of Shetland Hotel…”
“It’s not very often I have one up on the Holmes brothers. I didn’t hear what you were up to, but I heard enough to know that you were up to something. I gathered Mycroft had enlisted your help to separate Greg from Dinah Shepherd. I assumed he knew that she was behind the deaths of her first three husbands and wanted to save Greg from a similar fate. I was always on my guard from then on I never thought you would go as far as to marry her.”
Reassured, John stood carefully and stretched his legs, he thought he was getting better at this, standing in the dark. He caught a few drops of water in his hand to drink and took another mint, his last but one, his stomach rumbled but his mouth felt better for it. He was ready to press on.
“The dear boy, not really his area, and he rather snubbed the poor doctor’s feeble attempts at flirtation and as a result Dr Watson put up his defences, and they never got back on track. Sherlock was quite resigned to their being no more than friends for ever, but then he died and when he returned, he found his only friend had moved on, so to speak.”
The headteacher was quick to correct him. “You misunderstand me, Mr Holmes, much as I would wish it, I cannot directly ask you to investigate the boy’s abduction without the permission of his parents.”
John was pleased to find Sherlock at 221b when he finally arrived home, but he wasn’t the only one. Rosie was delighted, it appeared she too had missed Sherlock over the weekend. Sherlock took Rosie from John and helped her out of her coat and shoes. She clung to his leg as he did this and said as she had when she had first started talking “Sher… up.”
“As far as reception are concerned, she has checked out. It was the best we could do at short notice. Fortunately, one of the smaller rooms was available, and the officiant was willing to relocate to this venue.”
Sherlock could almost see the weight falling from John’s shoulders. “I really thought you knew I bought it this campaign.”
“The club’s about to be raided, I’ve no wish to be here when the police arrive and I suspect neither do you. This hatch leads to the roof space, there’s a fire exit that opens directly onto the canal path. If I give you a bunk up, then you can help me and we could have a chance of getting away.”
John made up his mind, if he was mistaken, he would deal with the consequences. He looked over to where Simon was manfully still trying to round up Molly and Mrs H,
“You see over the previous few years James had begun to ask questions, about who would inherit the estate when I died. It is not exactly easy to explain male-line primogeniture, but I did my best, told him about Charles Beverley, and his sons, Alistair and Patrick. James didn’t take this well at all; all teenagers think that life is unfair and to James, the thought that the estate should pass to these complete strangers when he was living on my doorstep, the only son of my only brother, was an outrage. In his view he should himself have been heir of all my estates, and he deeply resented those social laws which made it impossible.
Empty and half-paralysed I gazed out the window. The city was not quite awake. Only the occasional rattle of a bus, or hurried steps in the street beneath betrayed the first signs of life- workers, staff, and lantern lighters. It had been Holmes' favourite time of day.
What would my friend have inferred from the fact I knew the correct place for all of his belongings by heart? Hopefully not the correct ones. I cannot imagine how he would have reacted, had he managed to get a look at my heart, rather than my mind for once. Would he have made fun of me? Would he have asked me to leave? Would HE have left?
"Well, sir- I thought if I were hiding in a house this size, I'd go to the attic where no one's looking. Nobody ever searches the lumber rooms.I went to the ground floor last because, please excuse my language, sir- you've got to be right stupid to hide where all the guests and staff are."
As if in response to Sir Thomas' question, there came a loud bang against the door, followed by a bellowed "No! No! Oh god! Let me go!"
My friend had come to stand beside me as I knelt down to examine the body more closely. He knew he was needed whenever medical matters were concerned.
Our first stop was the dining room where we had spent two hours playing games earlier that evening. How much had changed since then...how much HE had changed.
The moral part of my character rejected the idea. What a loveless marriage it must be, when one party has unwittingly entered the arrangement merely to for show. The subject weighed heavy on my consciousness for a while. Yet I must admit I emphasized with the man.
Funny as it was, clearly this costume was of great quality, with its golden embroidery, and craftsmanship in ever seam.
The flickering light of the candles complimented his handsome features, and brought forth the actual warmth of his dark-brown hair. His half-closed lids did nothing to lessen the sharpness of his steel-grey irises which reflected his intellect.
"He loved you as much as you love him...which is something we do not have in common, I'm afraid..." I chuckled bitterly as my thoughts clouded again. My features followed suit. "He could never shake your trust...I wonder...does that make you a better friend?"
This was met with annoyance from his master. "What was he even doing here? He knows he drops dead at the sight of blood!"
As I listened with great fascination to his lecture, I was once again overcome with great admiration for the man, and, despite his many shortcomings, considered myself lucky to be his partner.
"You know what it's like, Holmes. Sir Thomas asked us if he could have one last party before selling the house for good. Yes, it's a bit much, but we felt we owe it to him."
Buried beneath those letters, lay a mold of wax. Judging by its shape it had been used to copy a key. Interersting.
"Nonetheless- don't you think it curious there are no female servants in this house at all? Not even a housemaid?"
"I have some papers here which I really think, Watson, that it would be worth your while to glance over. These are the documents in the extraordinary case of the Gloria Scott, and this is the message which struck Justice of the Peace Trevor dead with horror when he read it."
I huffed, whereas my friend took it rather more lightly. “It cannot be helped, I am afraid. What pretty fools we are, eh? To think we spent all evening lounging about, when we had the entire house to ourselves.”
"Isn't he married? I remember seeing a photograph of them in the papers. I never knew he was...well...one of us."
In typical-Holmes fashion, whatever had gotten hold of him vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, and he returned to his old, proud self.
“Holmes, you can't go on like this forever. You might be lucky now, but god knows what will happen next time?”
Of course, this made me prick up my ears. I had forgotten all about Holmes' promise to share the story of their friendship with me over the course of the day. I was eager to inquire, now that another chance presented itself to me.
I had hardly left my room that morning, preoccupied with the Bishop's urgent telegram, when my friend forced that preposterous article upon me. I gave in, even finding it rather amusing, but generally considered it to be of poor penmanship and not worth my time.
“I have always taken a special interest in bees. Their ways simply fascinate me- their social orders, their ways of communication, and their industriousness. I feel, at times, that they are a much more pleasant alternative to our own kind. I am much inclined to write a monograph upon the matter someday...perhaps when I acquire my first hive.”
I had long pardoned his earlier misconduct, and was even glad (at least to some degree) to see my friend's energy return to him.
“Oh...perhaps a bull terrier. I have quite the history with those rascals, you know.” he paused and shook his head. “No, no, what a silly idea. Bull terriers are only for the young. A Labrador would be better-suited to an old man.”
"It will only take you a couple of minutes! You really must quell the suspicions put forward in this appalling article!"
I attempted in vain to peer through the half-light of the room in order to catch a glimpse of how my friend was faring. I could make out nothing save for his pale skin, and the vague outline of his slender frame buried in the sheets.
As I got to know him more intimately, I came to realise that one would not be possible without the other, as it is with all of us, it is the sum which makes up the whole. He could not have excelled in his field, were it not for his eccentricity- but neither would it have been possible without his empathy.
It seemed mere minutes until dinner was served, when in reality, it must have been closer to an hour. Like any engaging interaction, the topics jumped from one to the other, ranging from amateur sports, to the tulip mania of 1637, to Socrates and his impact on modern literature.
I examined the brush in my hand. The hairs on my neck stood upright at the thought of entering his room. It was the one place I least wanted to go.
"He asked me to authenticate a certain document. If my cases continue down this line, I should consider a change in career."
I returned to my room as soon as Baynes was gone, in order to fetch my hat and coat. Although my mood was continually blackening, not aided by my colleague's endless tirade of dull questions, his presence comforted me.
Thankfully the man smiling at me from the sturdy wooden bed was not Mr. Holmes, the cold thinker; the Great Detective to whom all the world turned for help. This was Sherlock- a man trying not to shiver beneath thick blankets in a well-heated room- who looked to me- John (for I was never Dr. Watson when he was not Mr. Holmes) for much-needed and well-deserved love. Without the context of his intellect and his profession, the air of mystery surrounding him vanished entirely, leaving nothing but a human being.
At last, my voice broke and I gestured for the grave digger to lower the coffin. Indeed. It was over. I had said all I needed to say. Now, it was time to go.
We returned to the music room. An absolute silence lay over the house as soon as the door opened. The quiet weighed heavy upon us all. I could hear my own heart beating loudly in my chest, and feared I would be unable to breathe for much longer. The atmosphere felt oppressive. I slid my hood from my head, and watched the crowd, hoping to find some sort of reassurance. All I did find was fear. There was Parker, holding an empty tumbler in his shaking hands; and Trevor, whose glistening, reddened eyes betrayed the true state of his nerves.
There came a faint whining noise from the window, and I looked up to find our dog Toby resting his head on his paws.
The evening found me in a mediocre hotel room near Holborn Viaduct. I was glad to be out of Baker Street. The distance, albeit not a great one, was enough to free my mind to some extent, and take off part of the weight which had accumulated on my shoulders throughout all of this sorry affair. I even managed to take pen to paper, hoping that writing an account of what had happened might help me sleep.
Although the country squire was really over fifty, he moved and spoke like a lad of 20. His powdered wig and black mask around the eyes helped a good deal in concealing his actual age.
"I...I don't know! It was last night, I think...it must have been...I only just arrived, and I have made this macabre discovery! My God! How horrible..." he paused and swirled round to look at us. The haze of shock lifting from his thoughts, if only for the briefest of moments. "I haven't called anyone, how did you know that?" he shook his head and continued his somewhat incoherent but invaluable statement.
"My colleague's title is Doctor Watson. Unless you were expecting someone else." Said Holmes suavely.
Holmes slipped through the crowd of men like a snake through the jungle. The only way I could follow him, was by looking out for his pointed black hat, which stood out among the mass of colourful feathers and hoods.
Honesty seemed the best option on our side. My name evokes trust more often than it turns people away. I have often used this to my advantage.
Thus,when I placed my hand upon his forehead to ascertain his temperature had not gone up, I did so in the foolish hope he would take no notice.
Now for the safe. The lock was so complex it was impossible to break into it, therefore I had no choice but to open it legitimately. It shall serve as a reminder to always pack my tools- whatever the occasion.
Next, I directed my attention to the desk, which was also covered in blood. It had nothing to offer except for a bottle of Whiskey and a paperweight. Evidently, the murderers had used the former to steady their nerves, and the latter to break the Bishop's fingers.
Sherlock had the impression that John’s storytelling had concerned him, but he was too subdued to be flattered, what he really wanted was for the day to be over, and to be safely behind their front door. But he needed John and Rosie to be there with him.
John demurred, but Sherlock went on, “My unforgiveable error was not to realise the extent of the danger the Hilton-Cubitts were in. I deduced that Abe Garvey was a stalker; someone from Patrick’s past playing a nasty game, but had no idea it could escalate so quickly. Even when I saw the final note, I thought it was just to put the wind up Patrick. Damn it! I knew that Richard had access to a gun, I just never thought he would use it.”
Sherlock then turned his attention to the Duchess; she was a much more interesting character. The news of the impending divorce had exercised the press and several of the articles carried photographs of the woman taken on different occasions over the course of her marriage and before. She was a striking woman, some fifteen years the Duke’s junior, Sherlock surmised, something of the look of Irene Adler about her, perhaps more so if she had stayed with her natural colouring rather than the bottle blonde she adopted. There were four children, a daughter born within a year of the marriage, twin girls some eighteen months later and then the longed-for heir five years after that.
“I don’t know, one of your colleagues might have found the bullet hole in the window frame,” Sherlock managed to combine the optimum degree of politeness and pessimism in his comment.
Molly had had an enormous crush on Sherlock for years that was true, but ironically, the phone call from Sherringford was the final nail in its coffin.
“It all comes down to the most tedious motivation, money. Estates like these are a bottomless pit. How much do you think you need to pour into it to keep a place like this going in a year? A million? Two? The more money you need to raise, the more it costs you to raise it. Open a gift shop, you need shop staff. Run a grouse shoot, as Danny told us, you need loaders, beaters, caterers, and Uncle Tom Cobley and all.
“It begins with my brother Alexander, he was ten years younger than me, and born after considerable heartache on behalf of my parents, as a result he was indulged in every way, by them and by me. He was completely fearless and totally irresponsible, but he was funny and charming, and everyone loved him.” The Duke swallowed audibly and then went on.
“I think I will, I have nothing else on at present, and it is so difficult not smoking. It would give me a change of scene; I would have to stay over.”
“We are all going to die sooner or later, in your case it will be sooner because you won’t see a doctor. If you want to avoid dying for as long as possible, I suggest you make an appointment for the moment you get home.” Sherlock heard a noise and looked up, “Although, as it happens you are in luck. Here comes a doctor now.”
Mrs Hudson was obviously not in the mood for argument, so Sherlock conceded defeat and left them to it, anyway he had his own preparations to make.
Clara is in Geneva to present a paper on human trafficking and will be away for three days. Time enough for Harry One to enjoy a much needed session and for Harry Two to destroy the evidence.
by Edgar Allen Poe. John would have been useful here; fiction was much more his department. Sherlock quickly abandoned that area of enquiry, and went instead upstairs to the cypher room.
“Dinah loves you; it's you she's marrying. The snow won’t last for ever, it’s due to start thawing tomorrow, if you could just get to Aberdeen on time you could make it.
“The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the address is the British Museum, that's enough. Try to be there this time”
John doesn’t have the energy to laugh. Instead he stares at the sky, watching it change from grey, to mauve, to pink and remembers a pair of silvery green eyes, a purple shirt and a rosebud mouth. John knows that he’s a romantic, and will almost certainly be disappointed but keeping the dream alive, somehow keeps him going.
"I might be wearing a pointed hat, but I am unable to perform exorcisms- or whatever ritual is needed to rid oneself of ghosts. No, Watson. That yell was as real as you and I- and by jove, I will get to the bottom of it tonight." My friend muttered in response.
We stowed away our luggage, and, thanks to my companions foul mood, almost got into an argument once again. Soon the train jolted into motion, and we were but two weary travellers homeward-bound.
I hesitated. He was right. I did want to learn his tricks, but failed miserably every time I as much as attempted it- and it would certainly provide ample entertainment to Holmes. Even so, I was certain I would make greater progress with his aid. “Well...I shall do my best.”
"We can but speculate, but the sale of the house seems a likely-enough motive. After meeting his new masters, Huntley knew the end of his career had come- instead of speaking to his employers however, he realised he could make a considerable profit by blackmailing his innocent master's wife."
No part of the Bishop's body had been spared the torture. I have taken the liberty of borrowing Watson's notes:
It is one of the first rules of theatre to proclaim loudly what one is doing or holding, so even those at the far back of the hall can understand the play, even though they can hardly see the actors from their places.
"No, Reverend. I am Sherlock Holmes, and this is my associate, Dr. Watson. We hare here at the request of the Bishop."
How long I lay dreaming I do not know, but eventually I was torn from my reverie by a drowsy "Good morning, dear fellow..."
There came a knock on the door. "Mr. Holmes. Dr. Watson. Mr. Trevor sends me to inform you breakfast will be ready in half an hour, and hot water has been carried to the bathroom for you." With the Butler's announcement ended my second attempt at learning more about the tragic, and mysterious story which lay behind that chipper man Trevor.
We had been given a room at the far end of the house, whence we returned after some light conversation in the smoking room. I am positive the somewhat exiled placement of our room was neither an oversight nor hostlity, but really a matter of privacy- as our hosts knew exactly how two confirmed bachelors like to spend the quiet hours.
“Ah, Watson! You were gone a terribly long time.” I deliberately overlooked the other man. “And Inspector Baynes isn't with you?”
"Have you read that rag?" Baynes said, pointing at the newspaper on the table. At least he addressed the matter at hand right away.
“Something is missing here...” while I had really muttered it to myself, Watson responded anyway. It was not an uncommon occurrence.
"Come, come." My friend replied soothingly. "The Doctor and I will find the lady and all will be well. But you must be honest, or I might not be able to do anything for you."
"Ah, no matter, I believe I have one here." He rooted through his own pockets, and pulled a handkerchief from his cloak before taking the whole thing off, and hanging it over a chair. The result was Sherlock Holmes without a jacket, but with the added bonus of an almost comical witch hat. As soon as he had rid himself of his woollen burden, the detective dabbed carefully at Huntley's open wound and examined the blood stain in the orange light of the gas lamps.
“That is exctly the reason why I chose not to tell you about it in my letters. It would have caused no end of trouble.”
One by one I eliminated the possible tiles in my mind, until only seven possible stones remained- the third of which finally gave way to my touch.
But no...it was impossible. I had seen him pull the trigger. I had felt for his pulse, knelt by his lifeless body, and stained my clothes with his blood. There was no other explanation. My best friend, Sherlock Holmes was dead- the days of his great adventures numbered once and for all, and it was up to me to bury him.
"I haven't had the time to do an inventory, but nothing appears to be stolen. Besides, his Excellency didn't own anything of great value."
There is another advantage of being with a man of Holmes' faculties. We never really had to proclaim our love aloud. A glance, a smile, or sometimes a gesture were enough for him to understand- and he would do his best to remind me our feelings were mutual.
On most mornings we would get lost in the companionable silence between us until the sun brought our great city to life, but on some, rare occasions, my friend would invite  me to join him with a gentle "The rocking chair is at your disposal, dear fellow."
I must have dozed off at some point, for I awoke to the sound of the clock on the mantelpiece chiming eleven. My companion's warmth still radiated against me, and his pleasant weight pressed into the pillow I had provided.
I could see his gaze wander out into the greyish-brown wall of fog behind which our city lay hidden.
When I finally closed the dreaded door again, it was with bowed head and some hesitation. Who knew when or if I would return? In case I did not, at least I would be able to leave, knowing I had done all I could for the moment.
It was clear he had picked up a scent the moment he jumped to his feet and dashed out of the room. There would be no use in asking, for I was well aware he would not speak a word until he had either confirmed or denied whatever it was he had found.
The little party was made up of Willis, Sir Thomas, Holmes, and myself. Parker remained behind with White and an utterly distraught Trevor.
Watson and I did not exchange another word until we were back in our quarters in Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson had served tea, which we gladly accepted as a remedy for our frayed nerves.
It was a small volume of poems I had picked up upon my departure from London to keep myself entertained during my journey. While essentially serving its purpose, the poems were nothing remarkable- especially nothing my friend would willingly endure.
“I wonder what has become of England....where it will all go. Will the future be as glorious as we like to paint it? Or is it yet another elaborate story, constructed to shield us from the ugly truth?”
Mrs. Hudson must have missed it. I couldn't blame her. The poor lady must have been in a state of shock similar to my own.
I was unable to feel his heartbeat this time, owing to the fact he was appropriately dressed for the time of day.
I cocked my head in a playful manner, and offered to link arms with him. "Oh, I rather think there is no need for that."
So they left without delay. The cleric mumbled curses under his breath as they walked away. At least the sentiment was mutual.
"And when Parker did faint, you couldn't bring yourself to leave his side, is that not so? For despite everything, you love each other..."
I shook my head. I had made no attempt at producing one. "I have absolutely no idea. You insisted I examine the necklace, and I have done so." My were eyes fixed on Baynes'. "Now it is important that I keep my appointment. I am sure, Inspector, that you will throw some light on this affair."
“Ah, good evening, dear Watson. I am delighted you got the rest you deserved, after a week with undoubtedly one of the most taxing patients to ever plague a doctor.”
Her shoes I was unable to see, and her hands told me nothing from a distance; so could not apply Holmes' golden rule of observation.
My partner smiled enigmatically and shrugged. “Perhaps? Whoever it was, there was only one reason he could have done it: to make certain both landladies are out of the house, to ascertain there will be no further intrusions this evening. Perhaps the sender wished to spend some time alone with his loved one.” he looked up with a smirk. “But alas, we shall never know.”
My friend smiled, and leaned back in his chair good-humouredly. "All in due time, Watson. I said "suffice it to say", and suffice it must. Halloa, what's this?" he had jumped to his feet with delight, following the ring of the doorbell. "A client! Ah, that is music to my ears! I will take any problem she will put before me now. Another day of boredom would have been the end of me!"
"Inspector, can you explain this slander?!" he blurted out. I would have risked a smile at his eagerness, had we not been so pressed for time. "Has the necklace of the Samoas really been replaced by a fake?"
“Simply this: What are you able to tell us about the Bishop's final days? Did he receive any visitors? Did he appear distressed?”
Following this metaphor, I might have been the veterenerian, who saved the animal after having walked into a trap. I was glad to have gained his trust and affection, but would be more than happy to release him back into the jungle of crime where he could truly thrive.
Even in illness his features were strikingly handsome. While Holmes did not possess what most would call “great personal beauty”, there was a certain attractiveness to his sharp, clear-cut features which I could rarely resist.
“Well, doctor that's the thing- I don't know. A boy delivered the tickets yesterday. I told him he must have mistaken the house, but he wouldn't have it. So I looked at the tickets and addresses, and right enough, they were addressed to Mrs. Hudson and Turner, 221a, and b Baker Street.”
However, Sherlock Holmes never failed to surprise me. He had done so the evening I had looked him in the eyes with shaking hands, and told him how I felt- only to find the sentiment was very much mutual. He would do so again some time later, when, in the most nonchalant way possible, he would reveal his family tree to me.
I had heard the Inspector the moment Mrs. Hudson opened the door for him. His entrance gave the most welcome opportunity to divert Watson's attention.
"I understand you, Toby. We are in the same position, aren't we? Both loyal companions who were left behind, heartbroken and unable to grasp the meaning of it all."
"The very same." Trevor replied with an air of pride. "We met in India and started a contract. I would sell him tea, which his company would ship out into the world. He learned of Elias and me, but rather than showing disgust, he revealed himself to us, and offered to sell us his country house- which was fortunate, because I refused to buy back the late Dad's house."
“Take a closer look at the woman,” Sherlock suggested bringing the conversation back to the occupants of the opposite table.
John couldn’t hold in his curiosity, “Off out again? I have hardly seen you this week.” He immediately regretted the words; he wasn’t Sherlock’s husband. He tried again.
But John was an old-fashioned man at heart and deep down he longed to call his Sweetie his husband. Thus, he tested the waters to see if he could discover his name. He started with the obvious names like Peter, James, and John, then went through an alphabetical list from Aaron to Zebedee. He moved on to rhyming names, Barry, Garry, Harry, and Larry, then more extravagant names beginning with Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar, but after each his beloved said, “That is not my name.”
He was angry with Mycroft, but he had enough self-knowledge to admit that he was merely diverting the anger from himself.  He was angry that the mission had taken so long, angry that he had wasted time in Tibet, angry that he had misjudged the situation in Serbia and got caught, angry that his brother had witnessed his humiliation and taken the credit for getting him out.
Mrs Hudson was cooking up a storm; there was pastry and baking tins all over the kitchen. She had called Sherlock down twice already, once to take the lid off a jar of cloves, and then again to ask if he had any icing sugar. Now she needed him to run to Tesco’s.
John had questions, Mycroft Holmes answered them succinctly and without sugaring the pill. He gave John a brief resumé of Mary Morstan’s career to date, without revealing her real name or her present whereabouts.
Crowley didn’t have to ask who Aziraphale was referring to, he bristled with jealousy and the air around him became a green mist, with a hint of sulphur.
“He is not one of us, but he has done a bit of work for our side in the past, a lot of work in fact and I rather think we owe him a return favour.
He glanced at the Doctor’s face and his expression caused Sherlock to add hastily, “so I am given to understand. I haven’t sampled them myself.”
Honestly, you would think that today of all days, they’d put a sock in it, especially with the genuine domestic drama being quietly played out in the sitting room.
Later that evening, as the two men sat in the peaceable comfort of the flat, after the Chinese had been consumed to John’s satisfaction and Rosie had gone down for the night Sherlock once again saw the uneasy expression on his flatmate’s face. Whatever had been bothering him at the weekend appeared to still be on his mind. There had been a brief moment, when they were both at their most broken, where John had reached out to him and Sherlock had been able to offer some sort of comfort, may he could do that again.
John dozed on and off for an hour or so before getting up, he had an unpleasantly cold wash, before heading down to the restaurant for breakfast. Looking out of the windows he could see where the snow had drifted against the walls of the hotel, it looked pretty deep in places.
Sherlock reflected on some of the encounters he had had with elements of the Russian Mafia, in Belarus and during his time away, and as a result did not rule out a possible link to the disappearance of Petrovitch’s grandson. There had been many allegations regarding the providence of the Petrovitch fortune, but nothing had ever been proved and he had died three years ago with his reputation unimpeached. His money had not, however, bought him happiness; his son had died at twenty-one of a drug overdose in Berlin, and his younger daughter had been lost when the helicopter she was travelling in ditched into the North Sea, thus his entire estate had passed to his only surviving child, Natasha.
Undeterred, the caller continued, in the most persuasive of tones, but one did not become the British Government without the ability to resist persuasion. “Let me assure you, that won’t be necessary.”
“Ignore him Inspector; he’s desperate for something to do. Come in and have a cup of tea, you look like you could do with one.”
As Hilton-Cubitt had not suggested that his husband’s first language was anything other than English (although as an American that could be up for debate), Sherlock thought it safe to assume that to decode the cypher which he was certain it was, he should also start with English.
“Four and half years ago.” She replied promptly to Sherlock’s question about when she’d noticed the cupboard key was missing.
“Aside from Mr and Mrs Windibanks, one other person has a great deal to lose should Mary Sutherland chose to get married. The Windibanks might lose their home and livelihood but Mrs Etherege was in danger of losing an exceptional secretary.”
“I hope you are not too disappointed about the job, although there might be something similar in London.”
Mary paused and then crossed this through, John had told her it was in hand, and she should trust him with something.
“There would be shock and grief that I understand,” Sherlock frowned, his look giving lie to his words. “But surely the natural reaction would be to seek revenge or justice, not oblivion.”
Aveling pushed open the door to allow Sherlock to enter first and he found himself standing in a comfortable sitting room that doubled as a study. There were two upholstered armchairs, not unlike John’s chair at Baker Street, either side of the fireplace, and a table and chairs and a large bookcase. On the desk there was a newspaper open at a half completed sudoku and a chewed biro, next to a new laptop stood a stack of exercise books and science worksheets.  The four doors off this room revealed a bathroom, a kitchen, a cupboard and the bedroom. It was this room that Sherlock turned to first, although larger than John’s room at Baker Street and differently laid out there was something quintessentially John about the room. It was neat and tidy as he might have expected, but there was a spy novel open face down on the bedside table, next to glass of water. The bed was unmade, as if someone had just got up out of it, but the bottom sheet was neatly tucked in with ‘hospital corners’ just as it always had been.
He’s not alone; Murray, Turner and Simmonds have also hitched lifts on a variety of RAF planes in search of sun, sand and sex, their final destination Cyprus, Paphos and the Med.
Mycroft and Aziraphale were getting on like a house on fire. Once Mycroft had recognised Aziraphale as one of the privately educated, independently meaned, bookish types that had littered the library of his Oxford college, and once Aziraphale had stripped away Mycroft’s pomposity to reveal the genuine concern for his younger brother underneath they discovered they had a great deal in common.
“You can hardly call yourself a consultant if nobody consults you” Mycroft caves “Very well, I’ll see if Detective Inspector Lestrade will condescend, but you must leave off the Blow”
“That’s what you saw, wasn’t it, when I walked into your booth and you told me not to go to Afghanistan.  You knew if I went, I wouldn’t come back.”
Just as John thought Sherlock was going to begin to interrogate Dinah on the deaths of her second and third husbands, he changed the subject and began to talk of her forthcoming European tour. Dinah responded by becoming quite animated, talking about the breath-taking illusions and spectacles she had planned although giving no secrets away. John thought that at last they were getting a glimpse of the real woman behind the poised façade. However, it seemed Sherlock was unable to stay on his best behaviour for long.
Sherlock listened to John as he ranted and raved, it seemed there was plenty more where that came from. He found the good scotch from the back of the cupboard and watched while John drank himself into oblivion, and then helped his friend up to his old room, where he promptly fell asleep. Sherlock draped the quilt over John and went back downstairs,
However this morning Sherlock had other things on his mind. The truth was that he hadn’t seen that much of Mycroft since the events of Sherringford. Ironically for someone who had dedicated much of his adult life to avoiding his older brother it now appeared that Mycroft was avoiding him.
While Mary and John sat down, Sherlock remained standing, leaning slightly against the mantlepiece and listening as John, without mentioning any names, carefully outlined the scale of the deception that had been played upon her.
Dinah seemed quite flustered at this but quickly composed herself and said to her guests, who had stopped talking to observe what was happening.  “Well, I supposed that is very gracious, under the circumstances,” before giving the box back to Carlo and saying, “we won't have it now, put it in my room, for later.”
“I am elated, Dr Watson, all is well. This morning I received a letter from Ian, explaining everything, he loves me still.”
John felt a funny sort of pain in his chest; so this was it, three days late but Sherlock had finally worked it out.
Sherlock obviously expected John to agree, and seemed put out when his friend said nothing, so he continued.
31 Lyon Place was an attractive three storey town house, and while it was not as large as some of the houses in the row, John could easily imagine that it was worth every penny of the one million it had been valued at for probate. He was just beginning to wonder if he had been sent on a fool’s errand when a cab pulled up and Sherlock got out of it, sharply dressed as the night before, John felt his heart do a little flip.
Then John had got up, adjusted himself, grabbed his coat and ran out of the flat. Sherlock hadn’t heard from him since, no less than he expected.
Sherlock ended the call and said, “That was my contact at Scotland Yard; Reuben and Julie Hayes have been arrested, the local force are bringing Arthur back to you now, unharmed, physically at least.”
He sat down at his computer and googled Sherlock Holmes, he read the detective’s blog, he read Dr Watson’s blog, for good measure he googled Mary Morstan. She did not have a blog, which was disappointing. In fact, she didn’t have much at all, which was curious.
John’s voice trailed off, he could see even in the dim light of his bedside lamp, his friend was blushing.
, John thought, as he tucked the quilt a little closer round his sleeping friend. Sherlock shivered and gave a little moan but then settled again.
There was something about the client that made Sherlock think they had met before, or perhaps it was merely that the man reminded him of John. Sherlock put the man’s age as late thirties, possibly slightly older, expensively but not ostentatiously dressed, someone who liked the finer things in life and was able to afford them.
While Sherlock held a comprehensive record of motor vehicles, particularly those used in the pursuit of crime (getaway cars, non-accidental road traffic accidents and the like), stored in his mind palace he saw at a glance that the truck that was waiting for him was no ordinary off-road vehicle, but had been subject to some highly specific modification.
Just as this longing was becoming unbearable, Molly yawned, “I’m sorry, its been a long day, too much food on top of too much booze. I think we’d better make tracks.”
John did so without question. In the darkness he could still make out the shadow of his friend. Ethereal and insubstantial. Just as John was about to say to Sherlock again that it was all fine, his friend started speaking.
While John had been talking, Sherlock had been busy on his own computer searching the name Mary Sutherland and various connections before turning to John with a look of triumph. “The will was contested by Miss Sutherland’s mother!”
“Very well, I will continue to work on the messages I think it is very likely that I will be able to contact you shortly to throw some light upon your case.”
There was another silence which seemed to drag on for an unnecessary length of time. Sherlock took it upon himself to move the conversation on.
I recounted my observations to him, and prepared myself for one of his half-humorous remarks. However, he once again took me entirely by surprise.
“You are going to kill your appetite and what is left of your health. You were making such great progress. Now is not the time to be reckless! If not for your own sake, then for mine!” I crossed my arms in front of my chest in anger.
"On what business are we going to the Bishop?" Watson continued before I could lose myself in my thoughts any further.
They still reside in India together and are, to the best of my belief, well-established, and well-respected in the tea trade to this day.
While our friendship was genuine, there was more to it on my side. I was- or at least had been, terribly in love with my friend. Years of solving puzzles together had produced an intimate bond between us.
Not even our hosts were spared the burdens of organisation, which resulted in Holmes and I traveling into Norwich to be out of the way.
"Well, sir...there was this man- dressed like a harlequin- with chequered suit, and black cap and all. He was making eyes at Sir Thomas all evening, is all. It might be nothing, sir. I don't know...I just thought it was a bit strange, you see- I didn't see him talk with anyone else."
"Why did it have to come to this, Holmes?" asked quietly. "All those years of friendship, and respect... of trust! Everything that we went through together..."
How often had I crept out of my room at ungodly hours, plagued by dreams about the war, and about past cases (the hunt for Jack the Ripper, and the nightmarish case of The Awakened being the most common features of such nightly hauntings), only to find my friend standing by the bay window with a tranquil expression, smoking his favourite pipe.
The footman clenched his jaw. "I saw him sat there...the old bastard...didn't ken he was injured until the moment he turned around and looked at me with his bleeding nose. But it was too late...I was already about to strike. Killing was never part of our plan, and I pray to god I never have to do it again..."
"Well, we can do it like so- I will lay the facts before you, and you will correct any little error I might have made." My friend suggested patiently. He had had dealings with similarly stubborn criminals in the past. "I will start by continuing the chain of events we we were discussing before you appeared. You heard Lady Peacock's cry of distress while you were in the cellar. It never struck me as odd to see the two of you come out of that door until the death of the Butler. What was the footman doing in the cellar? Why was he in the house at all?"
Holmes spoke up before Sir Thomas could do so. "It would be wiser to continue this conversation upstairs where there is light and warmth."
It was then a slip of the tongue almost compromised the investigation. Regrettably, I am not exempt from such errors, as the further progress of this account will prove.
I could see from his expression that he pictured the scenario in his head. Eventually, he returned to the present and sat down in the armchair opposite me. His knee brushed against mine. I was aware it was no accident, but rather a gesture of affection.
"Nothing, Holmes. I am sorry. But..." I pulled my friend close, and muttered underneath my breath, "Do you really think we are in danger? It might have been one of the boys after all..."
“What kind of dog would you like then?” I asked with as much love as a man could hold, so endearing was his little monologue.
"Did I not tell you I would act as a magician tonight? My little show was so successful, I should consider changing my profession!"
“Look at your notes, Watson. It is perfectly clear. The object of this crime could not have been wanton burglary, but to acquire something specific. The Bishop was tortured, but resisted as he was accustomed to pain. As a result, they killed him, took his shoes, and left- no doubt to report their failure. Since the veranda has remained locked and unharmed, we can now deduce, that whatever it was they were looking for, is still in the safe- which they were unable to open.” I turned to the cleric. “Reverend, I shall ask you one more time to open the chest. The item they were looking for must still be inside. It is unlikely that they will let the matter rest- meaning they will return to finish what they started.”
I was glad, therefore, when we finally boarded our train. As much as I had enjoyed looking after my friend, the sooner we could get some distance between us and the destination of our involuntary holiday the better.
I turned around and smiled. There he was, in the flesh, smiling back at me with all the tenderness of a smitten schoolgirl.
"So..." Mrs. Peacock muttered, her consciousness clouded with her own problems. "All those....handsome men aren't...?"
"Well, I suggest we move on to lighter things. See here." he got to his feet and disappeared in his chamber for some time. All I could hear was the rustling of papers, until a delighted "Ha!" rang out.
Slowly, the exploits of the bygone night returned to my mind. The memory of Holmes' knuckles turning white as he clung to the bed in ecstasy; my own name whispered hot against my skin; his tight grip in my hair- and lastly, the feeling of utter exhaustion which guided us into a pleasant night's sleep- all of it filled me with a sensation of utter pride and accomplishment. To know one has pleased a lover so completely, gives a sense of satisfaction which a week of work could hardly achieve.
"Dear me, doctor! What a handsome devil you are!" he cried and graced me with another impish smile. I exhaled sharply though my nose, as one does when expressing mild amusement.
“Well, there you have it.” His lids snapped shut again, and his worried expression faded into a slight smile. “I am not in the habit of sharing my dreams. They are too abstract to be of any use- but I will make an exception for you, as I know you take an interest in these things.”
“Good.” his smile widened just a little. “You must come lie with me. I'd rather you wrap your arms around me than kneel by my bedside as if I were a dying man.”
His recovery was so rapid indeed (aided, no doubt by the southerly French climate), we were able to pack our things by the fifth day, and head for London by the sixth.
Parker frowned, then turned to us. "Sir Thomas took me in about three years ago, when I'd just turned 18...Willis had already been here some time before that. We were lucky to have someone who looked after us, and took us for what we were. Well, somehow we ended up together. We were so happy, and everything was fine, until Willis came up with the idea of eloping...somehow. It was just a fantasy at first. We'd often dream of running away together, but I knew there was nowhere we could go. At least nowhere where we could be the way we were here. Still, somehow neither of us could let go of the idea...until one night, we made a plan to steal little items from the house- things we could sell but no one would miss- knives, candle sticks- picture frames- that sort of thing..."
