John reaches for him and weighs his shaft in his right hand, loosely circling it. Sherlock can feel the calluses of John's palm against the underside of his cock where his protruding dorsal vein is throbbing, pulsing with hot blood.
Sherlock sucks and licks, tasting lube, rubber, salt and tangy musk mixing with John's come on his tongue. It's filthy, but he has no choice. John holds the toy firmly in place.
“Ah, John.” Mycroft says by way of greeting, noticing John's irritation about the unexpected invasion. “These are a few special friends of mine from the Belarus embassy.” Mycroft continues in a language that John thinks might be Russian, gesturing towards him. The diplomats look him up and down and nod, unsmiling, until one steps forward and offers his hand.
Sherlock closes his eyes as Toby takes what looks like a small knitting needle and brings it up to his chest.
John strokes Sherlock's sweaty curls from his face. “Hey. There you are. I thought I had lost you. Are you all right?”
Because he's gaping. His anus is wide open, the rim only slightly wrinkled, a bit red but otherwise looking delectable. Fuckable. And he stays open. His knees are slightly spread, and his arsehole is on full display. Vulnerable. Ready. Some of the excessively applied lube is dripping out of him, running down over his perineum, his balls and inner thighs, and it's deliciously debauched. Sherlock cants his arse upwards a bit more and presents himself, in awe of what his body can be transformed into. A soft moan escapes his mouth.
John allows Sherlock to take off his ruined knickers - only to stuff them into his mouth to muffle his cries. It takes some time, effort, and a lot more lube, but finally the toy sits in place, positively filling Sherlock to the rim.
Thwack.
“More?” John asks, and Sherlock smiles eerily, getting on his hands and knees again, spreading his legs, pushing his arse up in the air.
The day ends with Sherlock obediently draped over their kitchen table. John has removed the plug and made Sherlock lick it clean. Sherlock groaned as he tasted John on his tongue. Now John is watching his come dribble out of Sherlock's hole, pushing it back in when it starts to run down Sherlock's crack. He's still using the tiger balm but Sherlock has learned to breath through the throbbing burn.
When Sherlock finally reveals to John that he's still alive, John needs proof to accept that he's not trapped in one of his wistful nightmares. He has to experience Sherlock's indestructibility first hand to believe that their reunion is real. Also, there's one thing left to do to erradicate the memory of Mycroft's claim to his brother.
“I love our little games.” He whispers into Sherlock's ear. Sherlock nods and smiles wickedly against his chest.
A shiver runs through Sherlock as he stares at his reflection, almost not recognising himself: battered, with an unnaturally small waist, his milky skin a stark contrast to the shiny black rubber, his legs even longer due to the high-heels, a collar around his throat, indicating he belongs to someone else now. And isn't that true?
“I have to feel confined and abandoned... left behind, for this to do things to me. Please, John, trust me with this.” Sherlock begs until John finally relents. He knows it's crazy and irresponsible – but that's how they are.
“Use the tawse again.” Sherlock gasps suddenly, and Mycroft growls as he picks the strap up without slowing down.
“Hm, he seems quite talented.” Irene states and Kate nods enthusiastically. Her hands grab the armrests, knuckles turning white, as Sherlock lets the tip of his tongue repeatedly circle her clitoris, massaging gently.
From time to time, John remembers to drip hot wax along Sherlock's arching spine. Sherlock throws back his head at the sensation, begging John to take him harder.
John takes his time, careful not to hurt Sherlock. This is a little dangerous, but he's a doctor after all. Sherlock tries to relax and not to worry but that's easier said than done when a five inch long metal screw is pushed up one's penis.
----------
John's eyes are dark as he takes the black neoprene mask and pulls it slowly over Sherlock's head. His world goes dark.
----------
John does only stop when his arm starts to tire. He crawls all over Sherlock's tortured body, rubbing himself against the red, raw skin until Sherlock sobs with need, whispering in his ear: “Tomorrow, you'll get a big bowl and kneel beside my bed, holding it up so I don't have to walk over to the bathroom first thing in the morning, understood?”
Because Sherlock wants this.
“John, what...” He huffs out as he tries to twist his head to see what's happening. John's arm looks weird, and it takes Sherlock a moment to notice that he must have pulled on the violet household gloves that usually lie next to the kitchen sink.
His skin is prickling all over as his vision becomes fuzzy...
“He's so pliant.” Mycroft seems captivated by the scene, lost in admiration.
“John. Sherlock.” Sherlock's mother replies, not so much as a greeting but just as an acknowledgement of their presence.
“Ok, love, that was amazing. You're amazing. Just lie here, I'll clean you up and take care of you.” John gently pats Sherlock's hips before he starts to untie the ropes. Sherlock just murmurs his approval, totally compliant and reduced to making incoherent noises. His mind is wiped blank as he gives himself over to John's care.
“Beg me to fuck you.”
“Well, after your rather spectacular exit, I expected something clever.” Mycroft seems surprised by John's answer, flustered even.
Sherlock pushes his arse up in the air and moves his knees as wide apart as possible, supporting his weight solely on his forearms on which he rests his head.
Sherlock nods, his cheeks heating with excitement.
Sherlock just nods. John holds onto him until their breathing has evened, his chest flush against Sherlock's back as he mouths at Sherlock's neck and nape, just licking and suckling while his hands start to brush over Sherlock's abdomen and thighs.
“Six.”
It's not that Sherlock is shy – he's just not sure. If it would be enough? If John can handle him?
Sherlock has no words to reply to that. He just pulls the soiled, wet sheets around himself and crawls off the bed, crouching at John's feet.
On a tablet on the counter lie two small silver rings in a sealed plastic bag. Sherlock swallows as Toby pulls on latex gloves. He flinches when Toby disinfects his left nipple with a cotton puff dabbed in alcohol.
“Change of plans, Mrs H. You know how things are with Sherlock.” John explains, and Mrs Hudson smiles and nods. John pushes Sherlock up the stairs and politely refuses her offer of tea. “We are just knackered and need some rest.”
But as they are almost through the door, John turns around and smirks: “Just so you know, I mixed a laxative into the nutriment. Therefore, you might experience the strong urge to vacate. Let's hope the plug stays in place, otherwise you'll have a lot of cleaning up to do.”
The noises Sherlock makes... desperate, high whines. John needs more of this, needs to feel more of him. He removes his free right hand from Sherlock's arse and brushes over his hip bone until it rests against Sherlock's sternum. Slowly, carefully, John pulls Sherlock back and up until he's kneeling upright, with John's left shoulder a steadying, anchoring pressure against the small of his back.
“More. Please, more. Give me everything, Mycroft. I need it. Destroy me. Ruin me.” Sherlock begs, and Mycroft does, pushing in yet three more ridges until the monster sits snugly lodged inside Sherlock's hole. He's almost dizzy with pain. “Thank you. You are such a good big brother. Show me how it's done. Isn't that how it's supposed to be, you showing me?” Sherlock pants.
John has the presence of mind to look for his underwear and puts it back on. As Sherlock still retches John finally has mercy with him and gets him a glass of water from the kitchen. Sherlock takes it with trembling fingers and gulps it down almost too fast.
There has been an irrevocable shift in their... partnership. Sherlock will not decide things alone anymore. John won't allow for scheming behind his back, a tactic Sherlock has been quite fond of in the past. In exchange, John will provide Sherlock with the kind of distraction he craves. John knows what Sherlock needs – it's not drugs, it's not even cases, it's being rescued from all-consuming, brain-wrecking boredom by way of sensation play. And John is very good at that.
“Well, he’s here now.” Daddy says a bit wearily. “Do you know how long the two of you might be staying?”
“I’m sure he’ll dress you up in little fancy knickers, like a proper slut. Parade you around the club. Let all and sundry fuck you, even two or three at the same time. In all your holes. They'll take turns. And he’ll make you, holding you down, come dripping out of you, yet you'd still want more. Perhaps you’ll be allowed to lick his arse afterwards. But only if you’ve been a good boy. Will you be a good little boy for your big brother, Sherlock? Will you do as you are told?”
Sherlock can do nothing but breathe and lock his muscles.
Suddenly, almost in shock, realising that he can, John lungs forward and grabs the back of Sherlock's neck, pulling him in for a long, hard kiss. He tastes blood. Sherlock smells odd, too sweet, and his skin is too soft, not even sporting a hint of stubble. It's all wrong. It's perfect.
“You tell me. Nothing good, that's all I can guess.
Have some dirty pwp after that trainwreck that was The Final Problem.
“I'm sure you do.” Sherlock growls before bowing his head and lowering his eyes, fixing them onto the duvet.
He remembers that all those years ago he had stayed in bed as well at first as he had thought about a way out of this mess, tossing and turning – even rubbing himself? - in those damp blankets.
“I understand that this morning was hard for you. You aren't used to be treated like this. But you wanted it. Therefore, all this crying and pleading was really annoying, Sherlock. You acted like a difficult prat. You refused to drink my piss.”
“Oh. Then we'll better get you prepared.” But instead of getting up, they stay in bed a little while longer, limbs entangled, rolling around in the sheets, snogging like teenagers. Only when they're both too turned on to keep their hands off each other does John finally pull back.
“This will look beautiful when fully healed.” He whispers. “Do you know what your brother has written onto you, Sherlock? In bold black letters.” Sherlock shakes his head. Spit flies. John comes around and puts two gloved fingers beneath his wet chin. “God, look at you.” But Sherlock can't see his reflection anymore, it's obscured by John’s, his body superimposing Sherlock's, morphing them together. A strange sense of vertigo makes Sherlock briefly close his eyes. What is happening to him?
“Dio, guarda. Quale scoria!” [God, look at that. What a slag.] One of the spectators mumbles in awe. Others nod in agreement.
“You like that, don't you? Being tied down and beaten into submission?” John growls in a dangerously low voice.
John is quite surprised how full his bladder must have been, for it seems to take ages before the hot stream stops. Sherlock is dripping by now, fully drenched in his own and John's bodily fluids. He looks gorgeous, debauched, filthy. John's sure that he's never seen anything more sexy in his whole life – and he's had encounters on three continents.
“Take your clothes off.” He groans. Sherlock gets rid of those baggy sweat pants and the worn out t-shirt and hoodie as quickly as his battered body allows for. Naked, he sinks back down onto his knees on the floor and resumes fondling John's cock.
He can see Moriarty taking a picture of the corpse covered in Sherlock's semen, and then of him, lying on his back on the cold concrete floor, arms wrapped around his head, trembling with disgust.
The box of nitril gloves is still sitting on the desk and John pulls one pair over his fingers. Then he sits back onto the sofa and switches on the telly. “Come here.” Sherlock shuffles backwards, not raising his head, until he's kneeling between John's spread thighs. He shivers.
Soon, the wax has filled the small orifice and starts to coat Sherlock's cock head. John continues his ministrations until Sherlock's cock is covered in a congealed layer of white stearin, looking almost like a candle itself. Even Sherlock's fingers are coated, resembling frozen come. It looks absolutely stunning. John crushes his mouth onto Sherlock’s in a bruising kiss.
“God, you...,” John sighs with pleasure, watching Sherlock move on top of him. “That's amazing. So beautiful. Perfect. Such a perfectly trained boy, always open, ready to be of service. He's still rather tight, Mycroft. Are you sure you'll fit in here as well?”
“Take a deep breath, Sherlock.” He commands, and Sherlock obeys, afraid he might not be able to get enough air later. It's a disgusting feeling as the hose slides down his throat, pushed into his oesophagus. Sherlock gags as it passes his tonsils and Mycroft has to steady his head again, holding it in a death grip to prevent Sherlock from shifting and thereby impeding the procedure.
“You really think that's necessary?” He asks with a meek voice.
They arrive at ten sharp in front of a white town house at Eaton Square, one of the most expensive neighbourhoods in London. Miss Adler's work seems to pay off nicely, Sherlock muses, as he exits the cab and let's John pay the fare (well, if he can afford such services as rendered by Miss Alder, he can surely afford a cab ride as well). Sherlock is dressed in another slim black suit (not the one from yesterday, for obvious reasons; Sherlock is still not sure how to explain the stains to his trusted dry cleaner's) and a tight white shirt that elegantly hugs his lean frame.
“Look at you. Wet and desperate. Take those pants of as well, show me.”
Around midday John unties him and takes him to the bathroom to clean him up. John washes Sherlock's face, torso and groin with a damp cloth before giving him another enema. Only this time, he has Sherlock fill the bag with his own piss.
“Are you all right?” John asks, brushing an errant curl from Sherlock's forehead.
“Think of poor Molly. Think of the pictures I have from you with your own fist up your arse. You remember those pictures, don't you, Sherlock? Good.” Moriarty takes a step towards the stretcher, then another, reaching for Sherlock's backside, and squeezes one arsecheeck encouragingly. “Now, get the hell on with it.”
Clear fluid is continuously leaking from Sherlock's tortured cock, forming a gooey bead connecting with the wet rug beneath him. His balls are already drawn tight against his perineum, small and hard. John pinches them and Sherlock gasps, his muscles knotting in a desperate effort to keep still and not to jerk away from the pain and expel some piss.
“Please, let me try once more.” Sherlock whines, visibly contracting his hole.
A quarter of an hour later, they sit on the bed, Sherlock still just wearing those silky panties, as he apparently has only female clothes with him here. John finds this utterly arousing and very appealing, even though he wants as much pure male Sherlock for their reunion as possible.
“No. I thought you might want to use your own toys.” John answers.
John's smirk broadens. “The knickers.”
Sherlock huffs with disappointment but sits down on his hunches. John hugs him tightly around the middle, pressing his hot face between Sherlock's shoulder blades.
Mycroft shakes his head. This is bordering on obsessiveness. Yet he can't let go, at least not without being absolutely certain. It tortures him. Who'd thought his little brother would be able to extort such power over him after his death? It's ridiculous...
Sherlock swallows, standing rigid in the middle of the room while blunt hands touch his body. He has no illusions who's behind that warrant. Neither has he any doubt what will await him should his brother get him extradited. It'll surely be worse than letting this policeman have his way with him. He has no time right now to wonder how Mycroft conceived the idea to issue such a warrant. This will have to wait for later.
Sherlock nods. If he's allowed to speak he's sure he might somehow talk his way out of this. Not to forget Molly.
Sherlock does. John comes deep inside him, pulling him down into a tender kiss afterwards.
“On your knees.” John orders, and Sherlock sinks gracefully to the floor, grateful for not having to stand on his trembling legs any longer.
Sherlock, obviously unconscious. Tied down. Smeared with blood. His contorted face, slightly out of focus, blurred. Pale skin, so much of it. Eyes wide, clouded, dazed.
Sherlock bites his bottom lip and shakes his head. “No.” He whispers.
“Come on, fuck her with your tongue.” John's voice is rough and low and Sherlock's cock slowly starts to thicken as he becomes aware that this is something that turns John on. He stiffens his tongue and pushes inside, plunging deep between the folds of smooth tissue. Kate rocks her hips forward invitingly. It's actually not as awful as Sherlock has anticipated.
“Turn around.” He says instead.
“Yes...
Eventually, John gives in. He ties Sherlock up and stores him in one of the large built-in cupboards of the flat when he goes out to do some shopping. The concession Sherlock has to make is that they won't use the hood or a blindfold when he's locked away and on his own. There's also an open bottle of water next to Sherlock's head. If need be, he could push it over and lick some water from the floor. John wants to plant a mobile inside the cupboard as well but is met with Sherlock's stern rejection.
Sherlock wants to nod but John still firmly holds his face in place, so he licks his lips and answers “Yes, John.”
“Ah, but wait.” The DI smiles somewhat smugly.
“DI Gregory Lestrade from New Scotland Yard here. Can you put me though to Mr Holmes in an... urgent personal matter, please?”
“You said you had one last surprise for me tonight.” He asks, sounding a bit drowsy. This will soon change, however. As he puts his pants back on, John stops him before he steps into his trousers.
And as if on cue, Mycroft offers, while his come starts to ooze out of Sherlock's still twitching, sore hole: “Now it's your turn, John.”
John first undoes Sherlock's feet so that he can stand on shaking legs while he unties his arms. When released, his arms and shoulder ache rather badly. His back also complains. John slings an arm around his waist and supports him as they both hobble back to the bench. The cool marble feels lovely against Sherlock's abused arse.
John leans over to Sherlock, not taking his eyes off the action on the table. “How are you?” He asks.
Mycroft crosses his legs as he remembers Sherlock being breached by a dildo the size of his long pale thigh. Those visions keep haunting Mycroft, who has to admit that he does nothing to suppress them.
“He looks beautiful.” Mycroft murmurs, stroking Sherlock's constricted belly that doesn't have a chance to expand, despite being so full it feels like rupturing. Mycroft even squeezes Sherlock's waist until he groans in pain, his rigid abdomen suffering under the pressure. Yet he doesn't dare to flinch, fearing throwing up the mush with the hose still down his throat. Choking on one's own vomit is a very unattractive cause of death. Sherlock knows that.
“Hold your head up.”
While they wait, Sherlock takes his time to let his eyes roam the room. He has a good view from the raised platform he's sitting on. The orgy has progressed. There are entwined bodies everywhere; sighs and moans fill the suite, sometimes overlaid with shrill shrieks or loud groans of agony from the whipping room.
“No, John, don't be daft.” Sherlock grins. “Enemies, of course. But Mycroft’s as well.”
“A text from Molly. Apparently, she found something on the dead girl... she wants me to come to Bart's to take a look myself.” He's already shrugging on his Belstaff.
“Hm, ok, but I think we really need some lube for what I have in mind...,” John trails off as his left hand starts to stroke Sherlock's naked arse. When his deft fingers flick the base of the plug Sherlock’s hips stutter and he raises his arse even more, offering himself up.
“God, Sherlock, I'm fucking your pisshole, and you are letting me.” John whispers in his ear, his breath hot and moist on Sherlock's neck. They are both staring down at Sherlock's groin. “You know, there are rather large sounds to do this with? I think I'll get a set. And then I'll stretch your slit like I did stretch your arsehole. I want to push my finger inside you, up to the second knuckle. And I want to watch you finger yourself, your pinkie up your cock. Will you do that for me?” Sherlock stares down, fascinated, as the needle is swallowed by a hole he'd never really thought about, but like all his body's orifices, of course even his urethra is for John to use and play with. Therefore, Sherlock moans, giving his consent.
“Because…” Sherlock coughs. His jaw hurts and his throat feels like sandpaper. “Because that’s what I’m here for. That’s for me.” Sherlock mumbles, staring at the duvet.
“I'm not sure I want you in a room with loads of horny strangers. Last time wasn't exactly my favourite experience.”
They don't take a cab but catch a train to Friedrichshain. The flat is located near Boxhagener Platz. During their journey, they chat about nothing in particular. Sherlock points out the odd sight but seems to grow more and more restless, fidgeting in his seat. John can't suppress a smirk as Sherlock crosses and uncrosses his legs while a light flush creeps down his throat.
John's left hand pushes past Mycroft’s to prod behind Sherlock's balls. As two of his fingers slide easily into Sherlock's still loose hole, he smiles wickedly.
Tentatively, he raises his trembling fingers to his face and touches his lips, his nose.
“Get the lube out. I want this to be easy for you.” John tells him. Sherlock's right hand scrambles blindly inside the drawer of John's bedside cabinet, searching for the lube, when his fingers suddenly grasp something heavy, oily, metallic. He takes it out and gapes at it while John sheds his pants.
The slap hits his face unexpectedly. His eyes fly open as he's almost knocked off balance.
“Because I really don't care if you were involved in killing that pervert. Or in whatever else. I'm neither interested in some foreign scam. But I have to run the holding cells here and believe me, it's advisable to scratch the right backs. And profitable. At least for me. So...”
When John removes the nipple weights, Sherlock gasps at the loss.
“Stay like this, I'll get the lube.”
“Drink.” John presses the rim of the jar against Sherlock's lower lip and Sherlock reluctantly takes a sip of his own by now cold piss. “Swallow.” John orders and Sherlock does, even as the salty bitter taste nearly makes him gag.
John gives Sherlock a stern look that shuts him up at once. Sherlock takes a deep breath but still turns his head away as John takes his flaccid penis in his gloved hand and holds it into the jar.
But John has other plans right now. He opens a drawer and rummages through its contents in search of something. After a few moments, he comes up with a piece of string. From the cupboard under the sink he takes a small bucket in which they usually store their detergents. Sherlock frowns as John fills four cups with water and sets them down on their kitchen table.
John is sitting on the couch, skimming through the paper with a mug of tea by his side as Sherlock walks into the living room. He stands next to the coffee table and waits until John lowers the paper before slowly unbuttoning his coat. As the heavy wool falls open, Sherlock strokes his hand down over the damp shirt, usually crisply white but now soaked in pale yellow urine.
“Magnussen's newspapers.” Sherlock mumbles.
Sherlock does, greedily swirling his tongue round and round, lapping up the rest of John's ejaculate.
They are both startled awake a few hours later in the early hours, grey light lazily seeping through the curtains. Both their mobiles start ringing insistently and simultaneously. That's not a good sign, John thinks, as he blearily staggers into the kitchen to take his call and retrieve Sherlock's phone from the desk in the living room.
“Ok, wait here, I'll be right back.”
John continues to pour wax down Sherlock's cleft until the candle has almost melted. It looks like Sherlock's arse has been flooded with come. John moves over to the pale globes of Sherlock's cheeks, generously dripping wax onto them as well while watching Sherlock writhe and squirm in front of him.
But now, as he enters 221b, his thoughts return to John. who'd wanted to do some shopping earlier... Sherlock is rather excited what John might have got him.
She is alone, clutching some folders to her chest. John's stomach drops.
There's a bullet vibrator up Sherlock's arse, keeping him aroused and semi-erect all the time, wet and leaking. Yet it's the only penetration he's received since having been fucked by the hoe (no pun intended). John just plays with his hole, not even fingering him. He liked Sherlock's cunt all right, but prefers a tight arsehole.
John has to blink once, twice, before tenderly turning the debauched man in front of him in his arms, stroking his face, his hair... and then they kiss. Deep, passionate, without holding anything back. John arms – one sticky with sweat and ejaculate, the other with lube – hug Sherlock so tight as to never let go, feeling the rise and fall of his ribs and his knobbly spine while he slides his tongue against Sherlock's, soft, possessive, claiming him. Owning him.
John is sitting at a small table outside a cafe on Prinsengracht, overlooking the Westerkerk at the opposite side of the waterway. The bells are chiming, the sun is warm on his face, and the idyllic setting suddenly almost overwhelms him, especially after the events of the last twenty-four hours. He'd love to have a beer to relax, but he's drunken way too much over the past few weeks. Besides, it might be better to have a clear head for whatever revelation he's about to be confronted with. Therefore, he's just nursing a surprisingly good coffee as he sits and waits.
But his eyes go wide nonetheless when John leans over to reach for the glass still standing on the bedside cabinet, filled with Mark’s by now congealed come mixed with a splash of whisky. John’s leg slides between Sherlock’s in the movement, spreading them, making him groan. At least John removes his hand from his aching cock to hold Sherlock in place by his biceps to prevent him from flinching away.
John smiles a dark smile as Sherlock tries to squirm away from him on his lacerated back, making choking noises while his limbs start to twitch uncontrollably. Instead of letting go, John grabs his cock hard and squeezes. “Stop it right now, Sherlock, or you will be really sorry.”
As they leave, Sherlock is trembling both from the cold water and the endorphins rushing through his blood stream. Somehow he knows that the night isn't over yet.
“Imagine what your brother will think when he hacks my phone again and finds this little video. You think he'll like what he sees? I bet he does. I bet he's fantasised about this, you, on the floor, hurting and bleeding. I think I might invite him over when you are a bit more advanced, to show him your progress.”
“Mycroft...?”
“God, look at you.” Mycroft whispers as he embraces his brother from behind, rolling his abused, dark-red nubs between thumb and forefinger. Sherlock draws a shuddering breath but raises his eyes to look at himself in the antique mirror: hair wet and dripping, eyes wide and dark, mouth swollen, lips slightly blue from the icy water, pale skin rubbed a blotchy pink in places where it’s pulled taut over his fine bone structure. He already looks wrecked, yet they have barely begun. His eyes dart to his left, where he can see the reflection of John, his face closed-off, expression unreadable. But when their eyes meet in the mirror, something briefly flickers over John's features... a mixture of sadness and longing that makes Sherlock frown. Why is John looking at him like this?
John wants to punch something, preferably the man in front of him. “That's just dirty blackmail. I didn't sign up for this.” He says instead.
“I'm sure I won't be able to swallow properly. I'll be drenched in saliva soon.” Their eyes meet. Sherlock's go dark while John's sparkle with affectionate mischief.
As John starts to push the ribbed device inside him, Sherlock remembers inspecting the toy in the morning – black, made of thick, smooth rubber, about 9 inches in circumference, the tunnel being 2 inches in diameter.
“I have to piss.” John clarifies.
“Later then, maybe.” He says, but it doesn't seem very important to him. He seems quite content to show of his own subs.
Sherlock cranes his neck to look up at Moriarty over his shoulder, not caring that pure horror must be showing on his face. “No...”, he mouths.
“See what I have here for you." Moriarty croons as he pulls back the white linen, exposing a male corpse. "He's even blond, like your little army doctor. Come over, take a look. I'm sure you two will have so much fun together. He's quite... pliant.“ Moriarty raises the dead man's arm and lets it fall back down again to emphasize his words before gesturing towards Sherlock's somewhat flagging erection. “Better keep it up. I fear we won't have much time left. The quicker you come, the earlier Molly is released.”
“Hello, little brother.” Mycroft hums, while John walks over to him and strokes his face, his hair, his shoulders. “How was the experience? It looked quite intense.”
They'd've been drinking. Both of them, actually. In the afternoon, they'd wrapped up a particularly nasty case – involving homeless refugee children killed for organ harvesting; John still had those pictures of little bodies wrapped in sheets imprinted on his retina, and doubted he'd ever be able to erase them – and after returning home, John had decided to get hammered. Surprisingly, Sherlock had joined him; a sign that the case had affected him as well, that he wasn't the cold calculating machine as he himself and others liked to describe him.
“He's a quick learner.” John pumps in and out of Sherlock's throat while Sherlock grabs his hips to steady himself.
When John eventually goes to bed that night, Sherlock has rolled up on the rug on his side and is breathing evenly. His pale body is bruised and covered in bandages, his hole stuffed and his face dirty. He looks used and squalid but still ethereal and beautiful. John can't wait to continue to break him. Such a challenge; such a reward.
They start kissing, deep, open mouthed, the boy pushing his wet tongue inside Sherlock's mouth still filled with come.
“That's right, Sherlock, you are my slut. And I'll decide what's best for you. Now, take that hand of your cock before I'll break your fingers.”
The taxi ride is somewhat tense. Well, no wonder... their session has been interrupted but Sherlock is still plugged and open, reminding him of his place, anchoring him somewhere in subspace. Yet, he has to concentrate on a case. It's difficult.
“I knew there was only one chance to escape my brother. I had to die. He can be very persistent, as you might have noticed.” Sherlock smiles a wry smile. John snorts. “But it had to be convincing, in the presence of an independent eyewitness. Well, the easiest way is to stage a suicide. Not too many people involved. I would be in control. But, of course, I needed a motive.”
“You are enjoying yourself way too much down there.” John admonishes. “Lets see how much you can take.” He tugs again and Sherlock groans.
“I got you back from the dead, a second chance. Of course, I forgive you.” John once again feels a lump in his throat. The way Sherlock looks at him, so trusting, so full of adoration… how could he not forgive the bastard? He coughs to clear his throat. “But...”
It's disgusting.
The woman called Kate takes a good long look at Sherlock before licking her lips and replying. “Of course, Miss Adler.”
After a few minutes, however, the trichomes are spent, having released all their histamine into Sherlock's most sensitive parts. Now it's just the friction of the leaves, combined with the raw surface of the gardening glove, rubbing his cock. And despite his abused body, Sherlock feels his orgasm building.
Shit! John thinks.
“Yes, love.” John answers, his free hand stroking Sherlock’s gleaming curls.
But Magnussen seems not to notice. “So you are admitting to doing drugs, Sherlock. What else do you want to tell me? There was talk about young boys, very young boys...” He trails of, looking right at Sherlock, starring unblinking at his face with his sharp dead eyes. Sherlock's flinches a little and shrugs as if embarrassed.
John stares down at the track marks in a mixture of horror, rage and disbelieve. Sherlock pants and coughs in front of him, looking up at John in defiance from below his dirty fringe while fighting to get his breath back.
John's skin starts to prickle all over. He looks around to find something suitable to use as a battering ram. There's a fire extinguisher mounted to the wall. John grabs it, takes a deep breath, and crashes through the door.
“I think your parents have gone out.”
Eventually, the hot water is turned off and both men grab a towel. But not Sherlock; he’s left dripping wet, kneeling on the tiles. Soon, he starts to shiver.
“Sherlock, stop that!” He shrieks, swatting Sherlock's long fingers away. “How do you feel?” He asks, turning serious.
John takes a picture of him on his phone, with the toilet brush protruding from his mouth. Sherlock wants to close his eyes but John gives him another kick.
“Can you take another cup?”
“I understand.” John murmurs against Sherlock's lips, cupping his face in his palm. “I do. I've got you.” Sherlock closes his eyes and leans in as John deepens the kiss. He leads, entwining their tongues, nibbling at Sherlock's bottom lips, and Sherlock arches into the touch, melting into the kiss. John brushes the knuckles of his free hand over Sherlock's crotch and both gasp as they realise how hard Sherlock is.
John nods. “Sure.”
“Thank you, John. Thank you.” He whispers again and again. John smiles down at him.
Sherlock hisses as the procedure is repeated on his right nipple. He stares down in both horror and fascination as his chest is now decorated with two small silver rings protruding from his slightly swollen nipples.
“Do you have some clothes for him? Nothing special, just some sweat pants and a hoody. And perhaps some flip flops?”
“At my parents?”
“Turn around.” John orders.
“That's... well, what can I say, Charles? If, hypothetically, maybe some aspects of those stories might be accurate... could you help me? I'd be very grateful.” Sherlock tilts his head and cants his hips enticingly.
It's over far too soon for his liking. He truly enjoys licking John there and could eat him out for hours. But apparently, John has other plans. He rides Sherlock's face only for a few minutes before he comes all over his hair.
“Easier said than done with your little toy up my arse. Despite, I didn't leak, did I?”
When his bag is stuffed, he slings his laptop over his good shoulder, stuffs his Sig Sauer into the back of his jeans (he never puts it in his luggage while travelling, it could get lost or stolen) and makes his way downstairs again. His plan has been to sneak out of the front door after nicking Mycroft’s car keys, surely hidden in one of his coat pockets, and drive to the nearest station, taking the first train back to London. But as he stores his bag in the boot of the black limousine, John feels the urge to take one last look at Sherlock, to bit him farewell and see how he's doing. John had trained him for this, after all. He deserves a glimpse of how his novice gets on. John walks around the front and along the East wing of the house until he stands on the terrace outside of the large sitting room window.
The bath did help Sherlock to relax and loosen his muscles. Now he feels warm and a bit sleepy as he kneels on all four on a clean towel spread out on his bedroom floor, with John squatting next to him, slowly stroking his back. Sherlock's head hangs low between his elbows, so he can watch what John is doing in the large wardrobe mirror behind him. At the moment, he's slowly twisting the plug inside Sherlock, trying to loosen his entrance a bit more before pulling the first ridge free.
When John wakes the next morning, Sherlock has already left the bed. John finds him in the kitchen, on his phone, stirring sugar in his tea, just wearing his blue silk dressing gown. It falls open as Sherlock turns to walk off into the living room, and John can see black and purple bruises on this torso and thighs from the beating he took last night. The swelling on his eye has receded but he still looks as if he's been in a fight. There's also a slight limp to his movements; he must still be sore from being roughly fucked by four man merely 12 hours ago.
“You are going to blackmail him, aren’t you? That’s tremendously stupid of you.” Sherlock sounds rather disappointed in the face of John's alleged idiocy.
“And what did you provide in return, Sherlock?” John growls.
The man is still panting as John’s come drips over his nose, lips and chin. Sherlock is furious. But all he can do is blink rapidly. As if to remind Mark that he's still there as well, he pushes the dildo deep into his by now sensitive arse. Mark groans, starting to pull away.
“Are you seriously expecting me to spend the afternoon bend over the coffee table while you play with my arse, while Moriarty is on the loose?” Sherlock asks, his tone acerbic.
“What is this, John?” Sherlock sounds intrigued. Oh, boy...
“My brother will do as he's told and leave this house with me, now.” Mycroft drives the pointed tip of his umbrella into the creamy carpet to emphasise his order.
“Escapists.” The Inspector says dryly, scribbling something on her notepad. “You were at Signor Acri's … party last night?” The pause is eloquent.
----------
In his desperation, he had tried humping his pillow but - of course - to no avail. He’d just felt chafed afterwards. The only thing that brought him some relieve was milking his balls, which he did by fingering himself until he found the bundle of nerves inside his rectum. As he rubbed his prostate for hours, clear fluid started to leak out of his trapped cock, which he gathered in a jug. Imagining John’s voice in his head ordering him to drink it, he obeyed, slowly slurping up his own thin ejaculate with a straw. He wished John could watch him. But that was impossible right now. All Sherlock was able to do was to film himself on his phone to show John later. He had to admit that he looked deliciously debauched, sipping his own come as if it was some exotic cocktail. Perhaps he should add a cherry...
John makes him drink a glass of water, then another, but swats his hand away as Sherlock wants to wipe the come from his face with his gloved fingers. “Leave that. It suits you.” So Sherlock leaves the come drying on his face.
“So...”, he starts when they are alone, drawing out the word to raise anticipation. “Are you curious what we unearthed about Moriarty, little brother?”
“Undress, I run you that bath.” John whispers, squeezing Sherlock's sore groin one last time. “The pleasures mother nature offers...”
“Touch me.” The voice says.
Two servants clad in nothing but tiny red leather shorts pull open the doors to a large room: there are more candles, reflected in mirrors, paintings showing rather lewd scenes from Greek and Roman mythology – Leda taken by the swan, Achilles and Patroclus showing just how good they get along, Zeus and his cup-bearer Ganymede, Diana and Callisto in some kind of mud-fight with their nymphs bordering on gang raping poor Callisto – and men in different states of undress everywhere.
“Please...,” he begs, the bucket swinging from his chest.
John just can't bear the thought of this celestial beauty being violated by this bunch of drunken brutes down there. He stands in front of Sherlock and gazes down at him, his thumb caressing Sherlock's full bottom lip. It's soft again and a little wet. John remembers that Mycroft wanted to see Sherlock with his mouth still sewn shut.
When Sherlock doesn't catch on immediately, she gives his buttocks some forceful strokes until he grabs his arse cheeks and pulls them apart, face and chest now flush with the table top.
When he comes into the living room John is standing by the window and indicates for Sherlock to sit down on one of the hard chairs at the table, not on the soft couch. Sherlock can feel the plug inside him more intense this way.
“Please, John, let me pleasure you... hit me. Beat me really hard. I don't deserve your attention, but please, use me for your enjoyment.”
“About the piss thing? No.” John had actually felt quite inebriated – and that had made him reckless.
“So you have… what’s the word… private means?”
Despite having been strictly disciplined for fifteen minutes now, Sherlock is gasping and begging for more. Greg truly admires his stamina.
“You should lie down again. I’ll get you some water.”
“God, I really want to fuck you again, Sherlock.” He sighs and Sherlock moans in response around the rubber stuffing his mouth. He sucks it in deeper than he's thought possible, almost gagging on it and John smiles fondly and strokes his hair once before getting up to leave. Sherlock is thankful that John not only closes but also locks the door to their flat. No-one will disturb him as he plays with the rubber toy. He'll be a good slut and do as he was told. The dildo feels amazing in his mouth. How mind-blowing it will be when John eventually fucks him with it!
“Me? No. I didn't. Why do you think...? My phone...”, she stammers rather baffled.
“Logistics?” Is all John asks by way of agreement.
“One.” Sherlock’s voice is steady if a little thin.
After another half hour, however, sweaty all over, wrecked by cramps deep inside him, Sherlock is not so sure anymore. He doesn't even have the strength to groan. His whole body is trembling while he feels his mental resistance weaken by the minute, slipping. He's slowly losing control. Little whimpers of agony are all that escape his gagged mouth.
Sally grins. “You know, junkies have no limits when it comes to hiding their stash? I'll probably have to put my fingers into all his orifices.” She winks as Sherlock pales. “God, I seriously have to piss.” She shakes out her dress when John nudges Sherlock off the table.
John stays inside him and must be watching.
“So, how about I don't beat you as a punishment, but as a reward for me?”
Sherlock shrugs. “Sometimes. Not often.” It's the truth.
“Good evening.” John replies.
Blunt fingers spread his cheeks. Despite knowing what’s coming for him, it’s a shock as a sheathed finger rubs against his hole. Sherlock tries to jerk up and away but a firm hand presses to the middle of his spine and pins him down.
“God, this is so adorable.” Magnussen outright gleefully wrings his hands. “Will you stand by this little tabloid whore when I'm finished with him, John? May I call you John? I've heard from reliable sources that you are into calling him your whore yourself.”
It's coming in huge waves now, and Sherlock is unable to ingest it all. It splashes all over his face, drips from his mouth, runs down his throat and chest and pools between his thighs. Eventually, the boy just spits remnants of frothy saliva into his mouth and on his face.
“That's it.” He breathes. “Good, you are a perfect cockslut. You've got two dicks shoved up your tight arse. And you love it.”
“Please, John, please...” Sherlock is sobbing uncontrollably, thrashing his head form one side to the other.
To his utter enjoyment, this seems to be exactly what John wants. “Your wish is my command.” He grins, taking his cock in hand and fiercely pumping it while opening his mouth to let saliva drip from his lips onto Sherlock's upturned face.
Sherlock gets it, whimpering in a needy tone: “Oh god, John, you are so big. This feels so good. I’ve never done this before. I’ve waited for you. You are my first. I love your cock. Show me how good this can feel. All I want is to ride your fat cock.” He still sore from the clothes pins; the pained little gasps he’s making are not entirely faked.
“If I had known earlier...” Moriarty mumbles, suddenly close to Sherlock's ear. And then his palm travels further south, pressing down onto Sherlock's groin, who inhales sharply, flinches and squirms, trying to escape, to get away from this touch. But Moriarty just gropes him tighter, until a gurgling sound escapes Sherlock's mouth as he desperately struggles to swallow down the bile rising in his throat.
“You know what's coming, don't you, Sherlock?”
John takes the riding crop from the desk and follows Sherlock into their kitchen.
“No, you'll do it yourself.” John tells him.
Sherlock is too weak by now to fight his body's needs any longer. All he can do is breath and stay conscious. The cramps now come in waves, giving him some time to recover in between. He doesn't have much strength left. He's lost his composure together with his dignity some two hours ago. He stops watching the clock. It's no use. He's trapped in an ailing body in a world of pain.
And Sherlock had given himself over.
“I need your services.”
“On your knees, slut.” John breaths, and Sherlock sinks down in one fluid motion, kneeling before John, still fisting his cock. John takes his chin between thumb and forefinger and pushes his face up. “Look at me.”
Sherlock desperately clenches his hole when Greg finally pulls out, but all the plugs, the fingering, the speculum and last but not least Greg's enormous cock have stretched him so much that it is no use. After a few moments, Greg's piss, mixed with his come, starts to ooze out of Sherlock, slowly running over his balls and dripping down the back of his thighs. He is sobbing excuses as John crawls away for him. Both men stand next the bed, watching Sherlock soil the already ruined sheets with piss and more come.
-----------
It stings. The wood is firm, hard, unyielding. Sherlock can't move or wriggle away; he's absolutely at John's mercy. Soon, his buttocks are bright red and burning. They'll sure turn a bruised greenish purple over the next few days.
Sherlock is by now shivering in the rapidly cooling splashes of piss that cover his naked body. But there's still something to do before he'll be allowed to shower. John takes the still warm bottle back into the kitchen and puts it in the fridge. He knows it's sterile, but anyway. No good if Sherlock catches something by drinking contaminated beverages.
When they reach ten, Sherlock's arse is decorated with a crimson zick-zack pattern. John is completely in his element.
Sherlock briefly wonders how one could live with such level of internalised homophobia that one could only pursue one’s own desires by rape, can’t wrap his brain around it and abandons the thought in favour of dealing with the situation at hand.
“John, please, let me come... please.” Sherlock is begging but he doesn't care.
Thankfully, John had also found some pruners with which he now quickly cuts the branches wrapped around Sherlock's head and legs. There surely are some scratches on his face, and his legs hurt rather badly, but right now, the endorphins flooding his bloodstream give Sherlock a natural high, suppressing the pain.
“I'm afraid we'll have to improvise a bit. But I found some interesting stuff. I promise you a surprise.”
Sherlock tries to detach himself from the situation as Moriarty's dry fingers wrap around his cock. He has to escape this ordeal, otherwise he might simply vomit. Suffocating on your own sick does make for a very unattractive corpse, Sherlock reminds himself. Therefore, he retreats.
Will. He stayed William in this house. Not Sherlock.
His humiliation develops into a panic when he hears Mrs Hudson shuffle around downstairs. Tears of despair dwell up in his eyes as the doorbell rings – but it’s just a delivery for their landlady, not for them. And thank god it’s not a client either.
Sherlock sucks in his breath at the first sensation of the touch and almost loses his balance. The rope doesn't tear forcefully at his piercings, but still his nipples are nicely stimulated. Sherlock moans softly at the back of his throat as he steadies himself.
“God, you are so utterly responsive.” John whispers as he twists the rubber device inside Sherlock's anus and starts to pull at it. Sherlock gasps and moans unashamedly at the delicious stretch. It's not painful anymore.
“Yes, tell us, John, are you allowed to wear the hat as well? Or are you just cleaning up afterwards?”
John really wants to leave as soon as he's finished tending to Sherlock, but Murray insists that they have breakfast. Suddenly, John can feel his stomach growl. He accepts some toast and makes sure that Sherlock eats as well. Surprisingly, it's not difficult. Sherlock seems almost famished as he inhales three slices of bread, dripping with honey.
Something thorny is slowly wound around his legs, first around his left calve up to mid-thigh, then around the right. Sherlock gasps out in shock.
Finally, the plug is removed. The sounds his excrements make as they gush out of him indicate that the shady figures must have placed a bucket beneath his arse, for which Sherlock is eternally grateful. He wants to sink down onto his knees and thank his saviours, praise them, and his gagged mouth distorts into a manic smile. He's sure he's never felt happier in his whole life.
And indeed, inside, the conditions could be described bacchanalian. Beats rumble and pound loud enough that the whole structure seems to be pulsing and vibrating with it; almost naked bodies twist and rub together as if engaged in some euphoric, archaic worship, joined in communion by the roaring music. Images of their infinite grinding dance freeze like a pagan relief, spellbound by the flashing strobe lights. Everyone seems to wear some sort of rubber or leather outfit – if they'd bothered with clothes at all and didn't go straight for no more than some sort of harness or straps and nothing more.
“Miss Adler will be with you in a few moments.” The maid/housekeeper/PA informs them before sweeping out of the room. John sits down and crosses his legs. Sherlock paces the room and takes in every detail – barely visible red wine stains on the thick white carpet, the pictures original paintings by Mondrian, Magritte and Kokoschka, the sofas being at least 18 months old and still no one's had sex on them – until John coughs once: When Sherlock looks at him he gestures towards the empty space on the couch next to him and Sherlock sits down.
“So it's quite possible that this third person – man or woman – just mixed with the crowd at the bar and left with everybody else when the alarm went off... Did you recognise a newcomer?”
“Were you invited?”
“Then I think we should make plans to travel somewhere more to your tastes. After we've eaten.”
“Take it, Sherlock.” John orders, finally moving away. He turns back around and watches Greg emptying his full bladder inside Sherlock's anus. “Try to  keep it inside. I prepared you for this.”
Sherlock nods. He's able to get some air. Yet it's an effort with the tube up his nostril. He has to concentrate. It feels a bit like diving. Like drowning.
John's jaw drops when he sees Sherlock's modification. He had dressed Sherlock up in lingerie as well, but nothing quite like this. The black rubber corset morphs Sherlock's gangly figure, giving it an androgynous shape. Arched feet, lean, impossibly long legs, the round, bruised arse, the slim waist, the heaving chest swelling over the brim of the black rubber hugging his torso, flushed a delicate pink, shiny wet lips hanging open, moaning softly – Sherlock looks like fetish sex incarnate.
“I missed this.” John tells him. “My beautiful piss slut.”
“I want you to come inside those fancy knickers. Make a total mess of yourself.” John huffs in a rough voice while Sherlock can only nod to signal that he's heard and understood.
Sherlock nods, his eyes two dark pools in his pale face, staring up at John, who now puts a few items down on the bed for Sherlock to see: weights, a collar, a leash, a spider gag, the double dildo they'd used the other night, mere weeks ago, but it somehow seems so much longer since.
Sherlock is too keyed up to rest. He can feel his own piss slosh around in the bag. It's a lot, running down his legs, pooling beneath him, riding slowly up his back until his whole body is soaking in it. It's getting cold, but the idea of being forced to lie in his own urine indefinitely arouses him immensely; being unable to move, to clean himself up...
“Oh, for fuck's sake!” John shouts but then falls silent as he turns around from the fridge. Sherlock is kneeling on the floor in the middle of their dimly lit kitchen, holding up a bright red apple in his long pale fingers, offering the fruit – and more - to John.
“Spread your legs like the slut you are.” John groans, and Sherlock obeys.
Despite John going slow, it doesn't take long. Sherlock is too exhausted to keep it in any longer, and John, for once, won't drag it out beyond what Sherlock can bear. The man needs some rest after all he's been through, as well as some tender caresses and aftercare.
“It's not that easy, Sherlock. Remember how long it took to work it in?”
“He is quite a beauty.” She tells John who meets Sherlock's eyes when replying: “You should see him when he's tied up and helpless.”
As much as being confined like this turns Sherlock on, it also gives him an eerie sense of peace. He can't do anything. All there is for him to do is breathing, listening to his own heartbeat and his blood rushing through his veins. Quiet fills his head; under different circumstances, this would drive him mad. But not tonight. Not after those two weeks of high-strung anticipation and coming completely undone this evening. Now finally getting some rest is somehow alluring. All responsibility is taken from him. He can relax. John's in charge.
Perhaps Sherlock needs something that helps him to take the edge of things...
With that, Sherlock leaves and John follows suit, just shrugging his shoulders in an apologetic gesture. Dimmock nods in John's direction as they both share a look of
“You are a very dirty boy, Sherlock Holmes. Filthy. Deranged. You fantasise fucking your mother. I bet you also want to lick her arse, put your tongue up there, perhaps while Daddy fingers your tight hole.” John crouches over Sherlock on all four, his hard cock just inches away from Sherlock's gagged mouth.
“Sherlock, show me your arms!” He bites out.
In another alcove between two large windows, a fair young man has been tied to one of the ornate  red and golden Louis Quince chairs with what seems like a thick velvety curtain tassel. His head is thrown back, exposing his long neck, and every muscle in his body seems strained as a tall man drips hot wax from one of the flickering candles all over his left thigh. The moan the blonde lets out borders on a scream, yet is so full of arousal that Sherlock doubts he's truly in pain. His agony is of a totally different kind.
-----------
John, being a good doctor, has doubts. He knows it could be dangerous to leave Sherlock alone when bound so tightly, totally immobilised. He might get dehydrated or suffer from insufficient oxygen supply. Yet it seems to be the thing Sherlock wants. And who is John to deny Sherlock what he wants?
“So you have some money at your disposal?”
John has to admit to himself that he absolutely loves using Sherlock when he's tied up and open, overwhelmed by the sheer incredibility the degrading things he begs John to do to him entail.
Sherlock's knees suddenly go weak and he has to hold on to the sink to keep himself upright.
When John nods, he puts it to his lips and takes a first tentative sip.
Suddenly, he can feel the rough fabric of John's glove on his neglected cock. He's gone soft, but now his shaft is rapidly swelling, filling with blood.
But Sherlock stays at arm’s length away. “How much do you know?” He asks breathlessly. John's suddenly not sure if he's still shamming.
“We are not done yet.” He says, looking pointedly down at his groin. His jeans can't hide his arousal as the denim stretches around his stiff cock. “You are going to finger your cock while I fuck your face until I come. Now, open.”
“Please, John, use me.” Sherlock pants. “Do what you like with me. Fuck my hole, my mouth... I'll take it. Everything... stuff me with your cock... please, I need it so badly. I want to be your good slut, just give me what I deserve. Oh god, it hurts... John, please, it hurts so good. Make me bleed, make me cry. Please,
Before they had started, John had pissed into a pint glass – he had had some tea after all – and Sherlock had drunk it without protest. Afterwards, the gag had been fastened around his head. It was a large red rubber ball gag that made it impossible for Sherlock to swallow or to speak. He started drooling almost immediately.
“Ok?” John asks.
All faces turn towards him.
The next three seconds play out as if in slow motion. Upon the noise of the smashed door, Moriarty turns and starts to get up, taken by surprise. John, still stumbling forward, uses his momentum and throws the fire extinguisher in Moriarty's direction, hitting the man square in the chest. Knocked off balance, Moriarty staggers backwards and crashes into a bench, sending lab equipment and tools flying. The mobile slips from his hand and skitters over the floor, ending up under a stretcher next to the freezer.
“What about me?”
Sherlock places his hands flat on the floor behind his back and arches up, baring his torso. John takes in the patches that cover the burn marks and cuts. It's not that he wouldn't do such things to Sherlock, to drive him mad with pain and desire. But he loathes that others claimed a right to do so. Sherlock's body is his to torture and hurt, no one else's. Only John knows how much Sherlock can take, how far they can go. That's not to say he wouldn't push Sherlock's boundaries. But it has to be done out of genuine desire on both parts.
“I even put three fingers up myself while I was in the shower...”
“John, I don't share syringes. And I know from whom to buy. It's good quality.” Sherlock assures him.
“Have you seen what Miss Adler did to the new sub who refused to swallow her client's come? The  Mistress had her lazy mouth sewn shut and fed her nothing but come via a nasal tube for a month.”
Soon, Sherlock can't control himself, despite the pain, and bucks into John's fist as an answer to every stroke. Each thrust is accompanied by a guttural moan. Sweat runs down his face and his body is flushed pink down to his navel while his abdominal muscles flex and quiver – he's the epitome of debauchery. His nipples are getting stretched a little with every thrust, the silver rings gleaming in the dim light.
“Please... no.” Sherlock begs, tearing his lips open at the thorny raspberry branch, but John doesn't stop. He winds some twine around his bollocks as well, before Sherlock feels a rather heavy tug. It must be a large stone that's swinging between Sherlock's legs, and the stretch to his balls shoots white hot pain through his body.
“Might as well staple some papers with you, later, training your anal muscles...” Greg smiles darkly before taking off his trousers, getting on all four on the floor.
John coughs, and Irene looks up at the three people who just entered.
“Sit down on the tub. Let me do this.”
John watches him a moment longer, his eyes dark, his face a blotchy pink.
“Your brother brought some friends. Apparently, they want to play with you as well.” John sees a frown forming on Sherlock's face. “Don't worry.” John continues. “You have been trained well, you will be perfectly able to submit to their wishes. Just, because this might take all night, let me give you something to make it a bit easier for you, to relax and keep you going, ok?”
Sherlock's belt starts leaking as they leave the private chamber and return to the feast. With the sound in place, he can only walk slowly. Even like this, every movement sends electric shockwaves through his body. The hairs on his arms stand on edge, and there's a sheen of cold sweat forming on his brow.
A zip being torn...
“Yes?”
John knows he has to put his foot down at some point. He also knows that he has to ask for sacrifices in return of giving Sherlock what he craves.
“God, no! This is fine. Really fine!” John assures him. He can already feel his cock strain against the zip of his jeans – just from the thought of what is about to happen.
He’s grateful when he hears the snap of latex gloves.
John carefully places the apple on the table next to the microscope but when he turns back to Sherlock he sighs. Sherlock is still on the floor with his eyes closed but his hand is now palming his crotch through his expensive sharp trousers.
“Those bruises...” Sherlock's father seems searching for words. “And the rings in his...” He turns a bright prune as he gestures vaguely in front of his chest.
----------
Thwack!
“Look at me!”
Thwack!
“Good morning, John.” Mycroft raises his head and looks down on John over Sherlock's shoulder. “Look at him. Already hard again. Leaking even. You've created a monster.”
John fists both their cocks in one hand, sitting astride Sherlock's thighs, his other hand playing with Sherlock's nipple rings. He's going slowly; he doesn't really need to come again, but then he doesn't have a vibrator up his arse either. Sherlock, on the other hand, is moaning with every tug; when John rubs his cockhead against Sherlock's frenulum, he outright arches off the bed.
“I'll run you a bath. That'll help. Just... get fully naked in the meantime.” He playfully swats Sherlock’s bare arse as he once again walks over to the bathroom.
Oh, yes, Sherlock remembers: head stuck beneath the edge, gripping the polished rosewood with both hands, feet shoulderwide apart. He had to take it up quite often in boarding school, to be disciplined for his numerous trespasses of rules he didn't understand. Did he misbehave so frequently even back then because corporal punishment secretly thrilled him? He has no time to dwell on this thought right now, but stows it away for later contemplation.
“Who are they?” John asks after closing the door behind them.
The three words hang between them. Sherlock doesn't obey outright but doesn't move either.
John groans. “Sherlock, I'm in my pyjamas, and half of London's yellow press is already camping on our doorstep...”
“Yes.” Sherlock rubs one long, white finger over the rim of his tumbler while keeping his eyes fixed on John.
As if to push his boundaries even further, Mycroft turns the vibrator to the highest setting. He obviously enjoys the effect, watching Sherlock's body going rigid. Sherlock's useless, caged cock dangles between his thighs, clad in glossy rubber stockings, and starts to leak again as the vibrator relentlessly buzzes against his prostate. Sherlock can't escape the almost painful stimulation, he just has to endure it.
Sherlock is led down a narrow corridor and into a windowless room. Mondigliani gestures towards another plastic chair in front of another scratched metal table before leaving him. Sherlock stares at the clock on the wall, ticking away. Ten minutes later, finally another plain-cloth policeman enters.
So they relocate to their dimly lit kitchen. Sherlock doesn't move with his usual grace and has to grab the doorframe as not to stumble. Yet John feels suddenly way too sober.
Thanks to the drug, Sherlock only feels slight discomfort as a cock enters his anus without proper preparation or lube. Someone starts to fuck him but it doesn't really matter.
They all settle at the sticky metal table screwed to the floor, their chairs scraping loudly over the concrete floor. When seated, Inspector Mondigliani starts a tape recorder and asks them to give their names and addresses.
John's not sure if Sherlock is already healed enough to take his cock, though. He doesn't want to risk tearing him apart again. The doctor in him tells him to wait for a few more days. Yet, he needs friction. He's at least as hard as Sherlock. But he doesn't desire another blow job.
Sherlock clambers onto the mattress and does as he's told, his stiff cock bobbing between his shaky legs. John has taken the dildo from the kitchen chair and now attaches it to the wooden headboard with its suction cup, the black rubber almost poking Sherlock in the eye.
Sherlock lowers his head. His hands rest on his thighs, balled into fists. His nipple rings shine in the sunlight streaming through the curtains. He's not quite in the right frame of mind. Tension radiates from his body.
His cock twitches between his legs, pulsing, seeking friction from the slightly rough material surrounding it. If he concentrates, he can buck his hips just a bit...
“God, look at you. You are a right slut, Sherlock. Gagging for it.” John nudges Sherlock's erection with his foot. “Does it hurt?”
“Come on, don't you like this?” The deep voice is mocking Sherlock. With an encouraging slap on one of his arsecheeks Sherlock is told: “Fuck your tight little arse on my fingers, cockslut. Now!”
Sherlock swipes his tongue over John's testicles, sucks at the sensitive sac and rolls the nuts in his mouth while John fists his cock above his face. It doesn't take long for him to come, decorating Sherlock's dark curls with thick white stripes.
“So, she wasn't raped. That's at least something.” He tells Sherlock, trying to cheer him up a bit, while the detective is brooding gloomily over yet another crime scene report.
“You can't do that to Mummy!” Mycroft raises his voice in slight alarm.
“Anderson?” Sherlock exclaims, seemingly more affected by the attendance of his most hated forensic officer than by the scene in front of him. “Oh, for god's sake...”
Excruciatingly slow, as not to upset Sherlock's stomach, John pulls the hose out. It feels like his bowels being dragged out of him. Sherlock closes his eyes and wills himself not to throw up. Eventually, the feeder gag is unbuckled, only to be replaced by a large ball gag. But it's a relief, compared to the degrading rubber hose.
John needs a moment to steady himself. “We had an agreement. I trusted you. And now I have to find out that you... that you betrayed my trust. This is not good, Sherlock.” John draws a frustrated breath through his nose, his nostrils flaring.
“Hm, I wonder what he's up to next. Shall I stay in the line?”
It doesn't take long afterwards. The sight of the sweaty, bleeding mess to which he has reduced his usually so proud and arrogant little brother is enough for Mycroft to speed up, pushing his hard cock deep inside Sherlock's yielding body. Sherlock is making incoherent noises, but Mycroft is also just grunting: “God, Sherl... so tight. You little tart. Filthy! God... you want this... so badly. Take it. That's it.”
Thwack.
The bedroom is painted a dark shade of pink and in its middle, on a heart-shaped mattress, lies the body of a young man. His limbs are remarkably hairless but that is not the only feature of interest here. The man is dressed up in blue lace panties and wears shiny black hold-up stockings as well as black patent leather high heels. His wrists are still tied in front of him with the same blue lace ribbons that bind his ankles, the two cords connected by a third, immobilising the man and rendering him helpless. A large black dildo protrudes from the man's mouth, stuffed in right up to the rubber balls.
“I... I want to be a good boy.” Sherlock moans. “I want to be your good slut, please...”
Sherlock sees himself, standing in a long panelled corridor, doors at either side. He is running, skittering over the polished wooden floor, desperately looking for something to calm him, to distract him from what he's about to do.
He closes his eyes and thinks of something else, tries to evoke the memories of the four men fucking him in their kitchen; of Irene beating him with an iron rod; of licking Kate's cunt; of slurping Donovan's piss; of being fondled by Greg, sucking him off in his office at NSY.
“Hey, there you are. Back with the living.” John smiles down at his lover, who's still sleep-mussed and seems a little confused. “I patched you up, but we'll have to go slow for a few days. You better stay in bed today.”
John holds a small black flask under Sherlock's flaring nostrils and Sherlock can smell a somewhat chemical stench, not unpleasant, a bit like a solvent or a sharp cleaning agent. He inhales nonetheless. Immediately his cheeks heat and his heart rate speeds up as he's suddenly getting a bit drowsy.
“The quote. It’s from Nietzsche.
John has to use the loo, and as Sherlock is still covered in dried come and his wounds need checking and re-patching, they just tug on their pants and shuffle together over into the bathroom.
It's what Sherlock needs to let go; to give in to his darkest desires. To surrender, body and mind.
The sleek black car races through the night. After a few miles, John pulls over into an unpaved side track and parks the car to rummage through the boot. He's seen a blanket there earlier. It's a soft chequered woollen plaid that smells faintly of petrol, but it will have to do. He drapes it over Sherlock before gently stroking his hair back from his forehead. He can't tend to his injuries here, in the dark. He needs proper light, hot water. But he has a plan.
“John... Doctor Watson.” Mycroft tries to placate him, taking a step towards them.
.” Sherlock gasps, oblivious to any discomfort, not even able to catalogue all the sensations and signals his body is firing up to his brain.
He also somehow knew that this was a once in a lifetime chance. He'd lived with Sherlock for some time now – and never had the man been so open when it came to... physical stuff. Intimate stuff. Sex. Therefore, John had decided to knock back another drink and plough ahead. If it turned out to be disastrous – as his recent love life tended to be – he could blame the booze, and argue that Sherlock had started it.
“I have to dash, Sherlock, if I want to catch my train.” John smiles ruefully as the naked man in front of him lies back on the bed and stretches out on rumpled sheets. His pale skin is glowing in the gloomy afternoon light, the silver cock cage heavy between his lean thighs, nicely matching the glittering rings piercing his nipples.
He comes back around as he hears the front door being pulled shut, blinking a few times, but he doesn't get up as John enters the kitchen. Instead, he starts to slurp up the mess around him, first only licking, tasting with his tongue, before bringing his hands up from under his body to slowly pour the disgusting mix over his face and down his throat. John sits down at the kitchen table and watches as Sherlock cleans the kitchen on his hands and knees, nuzzling his face into cold pools of piss, drenching his hair with it before finally getting some towels to mop the mess up.
Finally, Mycroft will devour his little brother.
Sherlock can only nod as he feels the first cramps set in. It gurgles and roars inside him as his intestines are flooded with warm liquid.
Still, he complains again when told to ride a 10 inch dildo, glued via a suction cup onto the coffee table. Sherlock has to squat over it and whines as he slowly sinks down. John makes him bop up and down on it all morning, until he's sore and almost screaming with oversensitivity. His prostate feels positively chafed. Meanwhile, John sits in the kitchen, drinks coffee and reads his paper, but every time Sherlock starts to slow down, he walks over and swats him hard with the rolled-up Independent. By midday, Sherlock is drenched in sweat and his thigh muscles are burning as he begs John to be released, because it's too much, too big. Eventually, John has enough and hits him so hard that he bites his lip. After that, Sherlock's quiet, swallowing his whimpers as John makes him fuck himself on the monster cock for yet another half hour.
John returns the rental car at the station the next morning when they take the first train home.
The evening seems to be well under way. There are couples but also three- or foursomes... even whole groups of men engaging in all sorts of sexual acts. Next to the door, on a sofa in the corner, a well-built youth is sucked off by a much older guy on his knees while another twink pounds the man's arse hard, gripping the hips in front of him tightly. They are all sweaty and moaning – as best as one can with a huge cock down one's throat – and don't spare the new arrivals so much as a glance.
He takes his now flaccid cock into his free hand and aims for Sherlock's chest. As the first splatters hit him, Sherlock makes an almost animalistic noise, something between a rough growl and a high keen at the back of his throat.
“It's... nice. A little vanilla for my liking.” John turns slightly to look over at Sherlock, who's standing where he's left him, the almost empty champagne flute clutched in his hand.
He pulls on each ring simultaneously until Sherlock's nipples are elongated and stretched almost past endurance. In response, Sherlock makes desperate keening noises at the back of his throat, probably begging John to stop, but John doesn't care.
“Spread your cheeks. Show me your hole.” Sherlock had hoped it would be over but apparently, the Commissario has other ideas. So he does as he’s told and pulls his cheeks apart to expose his sore anus.
The plug glides back into his hole as the straps of the chastity belt are fastened around Sherlock's waist. John tells him to take his erection in one hand and pull his slit a little apart with the other. As Sherlock obliges, John carefully inserts the tip of the sound into his urethra and slowly pushes it in.
Suddenly, Mycroft's touch is gone. “Let's have some nibbles, shall we?” He offers cheerfully, as if this was just a usual invitation to tea. “Sherlock, get over to the fire place and kneel down. You'll be serving us.”
“Doctor Watson.” Mycroft tilts his head as a way of greeting. He's dressed pristine as ever – charcoal three piece suit, light grey shirt, dark red tie, fob watch and the ubiquitous umbrella – but there are also dark circles under his eyes, and he looks somewhat haggard. “Please, allow me to drive you over to New Scotland Yard. I presume my brother is busy elsewhere?”
“Oh god.” Sherlock whimpers.
“I like it, too. You know that. But I'm not flogging you after I'd stitched you up just hours earlier. We have to be a bit more careful.”
He closes his eyes as a cool drop of spit hits his tight pucker. Still, he hisses when the probing finger breaches him, biting down on his naked forearm as the digit slides deeper and deeper inside him. When a second finger is added, he holds his breath, wishing for it to just be over soon.
Sherlock searches for his brother, his anchor in this somewhat unexpected scenario. Mycroft steps up next to him and leads him into the middle of the room.
“He's almost passed out.” John observes.
Where best to hide a car? In plain sight, John muses, amongst other cars. Preferably at a place where they can acquire a new vehicle without attracting too much attention. John heads for Heathrow airport.
“Thanks.” He gasps. “Stay here.”
“I want you to deal with me as you see fit.” Sherlock whispers, staring directly into John's cobalt blue eyes. “Do anything you want with me.”
“Yes, John. Thank you, John.” Sherlock whispers.
Sherlock shuffles a little closer. His face contorts in discomfort as he moves.
“I need it. I need you.” He says fiercely, his face serious. “Help me with this, John.”
“You wouldn't believe what he can take.” John grins.
Sherlock shakes his head, not sure if he's allowed to speak.
Moriarty tries to move quickly in her direction, but, suddenly, Sherlock rolls around and lungs forward, grabbing both of Moriarty's ankles, pulling his legs out under him in one swift move. Moriarty lets out a surprised squeal as he tumbles forward, dropping to the ground like a sack of potatoes. As his body hits the concrete, he makes a wet, gurgling sound.
Mycroft's grin is outright salacious.
“Come all over his face, come on, Greg, do it.” Mycroft almost yells over the phone, and Sherlock's greedy mouth is suddenly pushed back and away as Greg gets to his feed, grabbing his cock in his shaking fist.
When Hoody is finished, it's Chequered's turn. His cock is thick but short, resulting in him hitting Sherlock's prostate again and again with every thrust. Sherlock can feel himself getting hard, dripping pre-come onto the linoleum.
Instead of an answer, John drags him into the bathroom by his hair, on all fours, regardless of Sherlock's screams. He tries to pry John's hands away from his short curls but John only grabs him tighter.
Oh god, Sherlock thinks. He's grateful for getting rid of the cage, but another tube up his penis makes him uneasy. At least, John is a doctor. He knows what he's doing.
“See you tomorrow, then. At home.” John tries to sound cheerful and uplifting, but his tone rings false and put on in his own ears. Sherlock doesn't answer, just closes his eyes again.
Afterwards, Sherlock is not allowed to clean up; John only rubs him down with a clean towel before he yanks him to his feet and drags him to the bedroom. Walking is awkward with the long chop sticks still inside him, so Sherlock can only scuttle down the corridor. Despite his bruises, Sherlock will not sleep in the bed tonight. He has to curl up on a blanket John throws him onto the wooden floor before cuffing Sherlock's wrists around one foot of the bed to keep him in place.
“Good, that feels amazing.” He moans as Mycroft sets a slow rhythm, pushing again and again into Sherlock’s body while John holds him in a death grip. Sherlock bows down even further, now almost lying on top of John's chest, as Mycroft adds a third finger. The stretch burns, but the feeling is also unbelievably arousing. He's already stuffed to the brim with John's cock, yet something else is moving inside him. The friction is glorious. He's glad they put the cage on him. He would have had come by now without it, no matter if he'd been allowed to.
“I put effort in things worth it.” John says, glancing over at Sherlock. “I know your resources, Mycroft. It's useless to try to run and hide from you.”
John just sheds his light linen jacket, keeping his black jeans and polo shirt on, but Sherlock disrobes completely. Beneath his suit he's been wearing what looks like a thong – only made of stainless steel. His cock and balls are trapped in a silver bulge with tiny holes. The contraption runs between his legs, with black leather padding on each side to prevent bruising, and vanishes between the pale mounts of his muscular arse cheeks, covering his hole. A dildo is attached to the strap between his buttocks, filling him and brushing his prostate as he walks.
The lean, blond boy on all fours is grunting as two arms move elbow-deep inside him, slowly twisting. The sounds of his heavy breathing echo in the gloomy room.
Of course, John sees through Sherlock's thinly veiled scepticism. “You don't like the idea.”
“Jesus fucking Christ!” She exclaims as she finally releases the bunch of red hair, allowing Kate to slide to the floor. “That was... wow.”
“Relax.” John murmurs. “It will only hurt more if you fight it.”
“I think you know quite well what I mean, brother mine.” Mycroft's stares Sherlock down until he averts his eyes, casting them down at the floor. “Is he ready?” This question is directed at John.
“No, he's not ready for that. But, as you can see, we are working on getting there.”
“Let's try in without restraints first. I'm quite sure we'll have to tie him down at some point but I want him going along with it voluntarily at the beginning. I like it when he surrenders.”
“You let that lot go? Just like that?” John asks sharply.
To his surprise, John bows down and kisses him, softy and almost chaste, mouth closed. The gesture is so very tender that a shiver runs through Sherlock's body.
“Of course it doesn't. I was the one suggesting it, remember? Do keep up when I discuss my sexual proclivities with you. It's not that I indulge in it that often.”
“No... not really.” A push, a hiss. “A bit.” Sherlock answers, his words cut off by rough gasps for air.
“I want to see how wet you are for me.” John just strokes his fingertips over Sherlock's fly once, twice, up and down, feeling the cool, hard metal beneath the denim.
The Inspector looks not the slightest bit taken aback by Sherlock's frankness. “I think we should talk to you separately.” She states before leaving the room.
John watches, mesmerised. “Jesus, Sherlock, what a filthy mess you’ve made. God, this is so lewd.” He breathes, slowly pulling the tool out. More come gushes out of Sherlock’s slit in its wake, and Sherlock wails at the burning pain that accompanies the squirting.
“Ormond Sacker and Sven Sigerson, currently residing at the Pensione Santa Anna.”
“What is... this?” Sherlock asks, a little breathless.
He's offering himself up...
“Just a few days.” John has trouble to keep his voice calm and stick to a polite tone. He doesn’t come from a very happy family himself, but distinctly remembers, when he returned back home, invalided from Afghanistan, his father hugging him and putting him up without any questions asked about his pending departure. Sherlock’s parents might seem nice on a surface level, but somehow seem to lack compassion and empathy. Suddenly, many things become much clearer to John.
“We are currently travelling.” Sherlock states.
“Of course, DI Lestrade. Mr Holmes has been expecting your call.”
“Watch.” Acri says to John. Then, addressing his kneeling pet: "Get to work, pig. Show our guests what your filthy hole can take."
John pulls the heavy door open and motions for Sherlock to step inside. The room is bright, square, about a hundred feet long and nearly as wide. Floor, walls and ceiling are tiled white, as are some concrete benches in the middle. At one side, a trough runs the whole length of the wall, with a drain at the far end. The other side is partially lined with white china urinals. At the back, there are a few larger than usual cubicles, some with doors, some without. It smells of sweat, piss and disinfectant.
Sherlock needs a few minutes to accomplish his task. Eventually, John pulls the dildo away to see if Sherlock did a thorough job. As the toy is glistening with spit and nothing else, John nods with approval before putting it on the bed.
Sherlock's eyes dart between her and John, unsure of what is expected of him.
“Don't! Careful...” John bellows.
“Pour it down my crack.” Sherlock pleads in a soft voice, and John dips the candle and watches mesmerised as white wax runs down Sherlock's cleft, held up only by his tight balls. Sherlock's pink hole twitches as the hot tallow hits it. The sutures have dissolved, leaving his anus tight and almost virginal again. It's so beautiful that John can’t suppress a moan, kneading Sherlock's arse cheek with his right hand, listening to Sherlock humming with arousal, his hips bucking forward into thin air as his wax-coated cock seeks some friction.
When John returns to the bedroom, Sherlock hasn't moved. He still kneels in his and Greg's come and piss on the edge of the mattress
“Lean forward, on all four again.” John tells him, and he does. He watches John from under his lashes as he fills the small bucket about one third with water, ties the string around its handle and then attaches each end of the string to one of his nipple rings. As the string is pulled taught, the bucket lifts off the linoleum and swings freely a few inches above the floor. It's heavy, tearing at Sherlock's nipples. He sharply inhales as the bucket sways in front of his chest.
Suddenly, the rod glides almost all the way in. Sherlock huffs as he can feel some inner barrier being pierced. “God, I think I just pushed right inside your balls.” John's voice is rough with arousal. “Does it feel good?” Sherlock experiences slight discomfort at the idea of being penetrated by a sharp object. But he trusts John, so he nods again and hums in approval.
“Please...,” he whispers, slumping forward, resting his brow on John's shoulder. John strokes his curls while shushing him. “It'll be over soon.”
“No, look at me.” John whispers, drawing the blade over Sherlock’s heaving sternum. Blood spills over his pale chest, droplets catching in the silver circles of his nipplerings. John dips his head to lick it up, to taste, sucking on Sherlock's left nipple until the distinct metallic flavour of the juice of Sherlock's life fills his mouth.
The pig nods. Sherlock shivers a little.
Suddenly, there are John's hands on Sherlock's buttocks, prying them wider apart, spreading him for Mycroft to inspect. He can feel his arsehole twitch in excitement as Mycroft brushes just one finger down his smooth, hairless cleft. He desperately wants to be filled.
He's so far gone that at first it doesn't register that Ginger has taken his flaccid cock in hand and is lazily pissing over Sherlock's shoulders and back. Soon, the other three men join him, glazing Sherlock's body in hot yellow urine. They aim for his face and crotch alike, and Sherlock squirms and opens his mouth while spreading his legs to allow their piss access to all parts of his body. The yellow liquid hits Sherlock's chest and arse, splatters onto the floor, and it's so unbelievably hot that Sherlock can't control his body any longer, despite his want to prolong this sweet humiliation. His orgasm crashes over him as he throws his head back, baring his throat, eyes wide open, and then he shoots load after load over the kitchen floor, gasping while making inarticulate keening noises.
Sherlock doesn't want to, he really doesn't, but what can he do? He is a comedump after all, so this is what he's here for. He swallows and swallows until he gags and tries to lower the bowl to catch his breath, but John's firm hands hold it in place and force him to continue.
“Y-yes.” It's strange to speak like this, with a tube up your nose and down your throat, yet it is possible.
“You don't have to drink it all. Just a bit. To show us how much you like it.” A glass filled with light yellow liquid is held in front of Sherlock's face. Yet his shaking fingers can't hold it, and he's unable to raise his arm. So John has to help him, holding the glass to Sherlock's lips as he slowly takes a few sips. It tastes stale. The caustic odour fills Sherlock's nostrils despite the tube. He doesn't want to swallow, wants to turn away, but he obeys and takes another swig.
In the evening, John takes a shower, before he runs Sherlock a lukewarm bath, soaping his back with a soft loofah sponge. Eventually, all remnants of last night are gone from both their bodies.
Moriarty stares at John for a moment before his eyes flick around the room, wild and manic. John takes a step towards him, then another. But suddenly, there's a scalpel in Moriarty's hand. He wields it like a dagger, slicing the air between them. John suddenly becomes blatantly aware that he is unarmed.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock groans, getting more and more desperate. He can feel the pressure on his bladder increase like a dull throb building deep inside him.
John's large cock blocks his windpipe. The lack of air makes Sherlock dizzy, especially as John stays deep inside him for long moments, cutting off his air supply. In addition, Sherlock starts drooling copiously because he can't swallow. His spit drips onto his chest, reminding him of the weights still attached to his nipples.
At least Sherlock is allowed to use a cloth to wipe the floor. Only when the oak parquet is gleaming does Mycroft send him into the bathroom, wrinkling his nose in disgust. Sherlock washes himself quick yet efficiently.
“Well, it turned him on...” Sherlock cuts in.
John stares for a moment before he takes the toilet brush from its stand and pushes it deep inside Sherlock.
“Fuck me, John. Please, fuck me.” He pleads, raw and hoarse, flayed, his core laid open. John instantly drops the knife, unbuttons his jeans and pulls them down to mid-thigh. As his stiff cock springs free, he takes the lube and slicks himself up.
John presses the palm of his left hand against his crotch. This is definitely the hottest thing he's ever seen in his whole life. He might be about to have a coronary – but sod it, if he's to go like this, it's totally worth it.
“I'll be thinking about you every day. My cock rendered useless, any attempt at release futile. It'll be torture. I can see its appeal. For both of us.” Sherlock mumbles, kissing down John's neck until he pulls away. “We shouldn't contact each other if it's not absolutely necessary. It should look like as if we met by chance.”
Sorry, I left the fandom and won't continue this story. Apologies but I just can't...
John pulls his pants up before he starts to feed Sherlock strawberries dipped in yoghurt and his come. As John spears each fruit onto a fork, he watches Sherlock greedily open his mouth to receive his breakfast. His full lips wrap around the ripe fruits, sucking the coating off of them before slowly chewing and swallowing.
Over the next 20 minutes John drizzles hot wax over Sherlock's exposed perineum, his shaft, his spread cleft – even the base of the glass plug – before finally devoting his attention to Sherlock's glans and slit. It doesn't help that Sherlock can see where the hot splashes will hit him next, as the knowledge of the pain caused by this torture is at least half the agony he experiences. But he can also see how much John enjoys punishing him in this way. His eyes are dark and his breathing is almost as ragged as Sherlock's.
They quickly get a bucket and cloth to wipe up the mess. As per usual, John is doing most of the work, and as a perhaps little spiteful revenge leaves Sherlock's come to dry on the cupboard's door (should the git try to explain
He would love a shower. He feels itchy, covered in dried sweat and semen. The latex sticks uncomfortably to his skin. His stomach hurts, his nipples pulse with a dull ache, his arse is sore, and he still doesn't know what his brother has written onto his body. Yet he tries to stay very still, sensing that they want him like this, pliant, an inanimate object, dehumanised.
They gleefully enjoy playing with the vibrator's remote; adjusting the settings makes Sherlock twitch and moan while he's sucking on his own fingers, preposterously frotting against the mattress, unable to find release.
“John I... I can't do this... right now. God!” Sherlock pants as John drives the plug further inside him regardless.
