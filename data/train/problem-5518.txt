“He’s grieving.”
and Dean calls him a bitch before he pockets his phone and takes Cas out on a date because that they haven’t done yet and Cas needs to know what a date is like. It’s just cheeseburgers and fries because that’s all they can find that’s open at this time of day
“I think she took off with Anna then?”
Dean pointed at the bed. Castiel looked way younger and relaxed while asleep, like the way Dean remembered him from juvie.
Fate chooses that moment to rip his wings out of his back. Castiel arches his back and screams as the sharp pain shoots through his shoulders. His vision goes dark as pain overtakes. For the first time in his long life Castiel wishes he would die.
“I’ve done good? Do I look like I feel good?”
I hope you liked this chapter. The next prompt is “Are you happy now? HUH? DOES THIS MAKE YOU HAPPY?”
Dean sets the tray down next to the cabinet with the machetes and crouches down next to his boyfriend.
Dean nodded.
didn’t want to go. The other guests were already there and looked like they had the time of their lives. Kevin looked like he didn’t want to be there either so Dean decided he was good company. Charlie was dancing and came by to hug him.
Dean shook his head.
“Dean, I do not cry about my clothes. I have been surprised by the branch of a tree on this side.”
Dean sighs and motions for Cas to sit on his bed while he scoots forward.
to do it, and that is the worst part.
Cas stops the car and I realize that we’re back home at Bobby’s garage.
Before Dean can answer Cas has captured his lips again. Dean can’t complain until Cas leans back up for breath. Because now Dean is freakin’
His eyes snapped open. He hadn’t just thought that. Never.
“But you’re my dork. C’mere.”
“Of course, Samsquatch. Gotta make your bride regret her choices.”
Dean couldn’t make out Castiel’s expression but his shoulders were slumped and his head was hanging low. He didn’t react when Dean closed the door.
“Dean! Hey, Cas!”
, but it’s cold. Naomi is proud of him, he can tell. She touches his forehead and Castiel forgets but there’s a little more freedom in his wings as if Naomi unclipped them.
“Just clean up after you’re done.”
“Don’t ever do that again!”
“You’re a dork, you know that?”
Dean and Castiel climb the wall in no time and soon they are on the other side, safe. Both men are panting and Dean can’t bite back the laughter that’s trying to escape his throat.
“You wanna talk about it?”
“Why didn’t you let Sam help you?”
Castiel closed the book and sat down next to Dean, eyes locking with
The guy nodded enthusiastically.
Dean looks at him incredulously.
“Shut up, Sam, I’m trying to not be awake.”
“But only because some douchebags were bullying me.”
The deep, gravelly voice brought him back to reality. No doubt the father had caught him staring and Dean tried to hide his embarrassment by getting up and wiping the snow from his pants. He then extended a hand to Castiel who still lay on the ground watching Dean.
“Easy there, angel, don’t go too fast.”
I very much appreciate suggestions, so feel free to leave one.
That’s the moment I realize that Cas is as nervous about this as I am. For some funny reason that takes some of the nervousness from me.
It was a painful procedure. Most times Castiel could hear Dean scream inside the room but he prohibited himself from going into the dungeon. He wouldn’t be able to look into those dark eyes. Castiel knew that it wasn’t fair to let Sam treat Dean with everything the demo
“I’m sorry, Dean. Many of the angels stil haven’t accepted me as one of them after what I’ve done.”
“It’s okay, Cas. I don’t judge you.”
He feels Cas stirring beside him, moving slightly in his sleep. The bandages and the pain should keep him from moving onto his back. Dean’s given him some more painkillers before sleep but that was several hours ago. Cas’ movements become more frantic, he’s throwing his head back and before Dean register what’s going on a hand hits his stomach.
“Hello, Cas. Toldya I’d be there.”
y fires two shots, both of them hitting the target between what would have been eyes had it been a human.
When Castiel still hadn’t moved after Dean had changed into his pajamas his worry started to eat at him almost painfully.
It was way past midnight when Dean decided that Jessica’s parents were probably waiting for their daughter and offered to take her home. Meg also seemed to be tired and said good-bye quickly before heading off to her apartment.
There’s a little smile playing on Dean’s face. Ten years. Sammy’s been married for ten years now. Dean’s a proud uncle. Just think about it! He doesn’t try to keep that smile from his face. His niece and nephew are the best kids in Kansas and although it’s a long drive from Dallas to Lawrence he’s been going up there every now and then to visit his brother’s family. It won’t be different now.
He opens his eyes to find his head cradled in Dean’s lap. The hunter’s green eyes are gleaming with unshed tears but his expression is furious.
His eyes open wide, darting around unfocused, trying to find something, anything to hold on to.
“Hey Dean, guess who’s coming over for Christmas?”
“I’m not going to argue with you, Dean. You sit. I drive.”
Since then I’ve never punched somebody. Not because Dad was pissed, he really wasn’t, but because Sammy had problems making friends at his old school and when he finally found them I had to come and ruin it. So that’s why I don’t beat assholes to shit anymore. And I don’t go to clubs. Definitely not wearing a fucking crop top from Charlie because she annoyed me for half an hour until I groaned and put it on just to shut her up. Charlie’s the reason I am in a club. Not only a club but
Again no question.
Dean does find Cas half an hour later. He’s got some coffee and breakfast saved up for him and scans the bunker until he finds Cas sitting in their weaponry, looking at Dean’s spare gun.
“Dean?”
“Shut your face.”
“Dean, we need to talk,” Ms Carlson said. Dean just shrugged. He was sitting on one of those chairs that tried a little too hard to be comfortable. The therapist sat across from him, a notebook in her lap, legs crossed like a professional. She had that concerned look on her face that a lot of grown-ups wore when they were talking to children they found difficult.
Dean shrugged.
Sam didn’t meet his eyes.
“Normally, yeah. But not you, Cas. Not you.”
Castiel smiles and reaches for Dean’s hand.
Dave smiled.
“It’s not important.”
Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam can’t do anything but watch Dean storm out of the house and into the dark. He thinks he can hear a silent sob but that might just be his imagination. John is still standing, staring at the door, face red, breathing heavily. Before Sam can stop himself he’s on his feet shouting at his father.
“Shh, Dean, language,” the witch s
He is on his way out of Dean’s room when Dean’s body speaks without his consent.
“Well, you know he’s a jerk, right?”
“You’re family.” He’s barely audible, even for the angel.
strength slowly fading. They’re trapped.
There was something in Novak’s voice that made Dean shut up.
“What do you want, Sammy?”
Under different circumstances Dean would’ve told him to stop talking bullshit, that he didn’t need time with anyone, but the hunter stayed silent, still without having moved. That told Sam how much Dean was scared for Cas. He got up and left the room.
Dean didn’t believe
Jo comes over and saves me from embarrassing myself even more. Turns out we both like Cheeseburger with extra onions and fries. That’s a good sign, right?
A warm smile split the angel’s face.
much trouble!
Castiel dropped his gaze, his face blushing with shame. Dean bit his lip in frustration while fighting with himself. How could he convince Cas that he wasn’t mad, just worried? In times like these he regretted not knowing how to express his feelings. Oh, fuck it, Dean thought and grabbed Castiel’s hand.
“You can call me Cas.”
“No! Why would I do that?”
“I have to atone.”
“Uh… yeah?”
Dean’s smile widened as his eyes turned black and Castiel found that he was unable to move. A crack went through the floor, ripping open the lines that should have kept Dean locked inside the circle. With achingly slow motions Dean rose from the metal chair and stretched his limbs, sighing in content.
“Seriously, if there’s a problem just call me, I’ll be there.”
ou spread yourself too thin on this one.”
“That’s the last one. Now we can just wait and hope.”
“I’d like that,” Cas replies. Seconds tick by.
“We need you.” Dean swallows thickly and croaks weakly, “I love you.”
“I didn’t.”
“Just a question? You’re not sure?”
Castiel averts his eyes.
“Cas and I got it covered. You stay here, have an eye on Kevin, make sure he comes home safe, help him if you can.”
“No, not yet.”
, wrong, evil. Still he missed the demon’s touch when he shoved him away, eyes burning in a bright divine blue. This was not
“It’s not a girl.”
“I don’t know, okay? He just came outside, looking for a lighter for his joint and in the next moment he’s way too close and kisses me. I have no idea who he is or what he does, just got his number on a scrap piece of paper he slipped into one of my pockets. It’s not a big deal.”
His voice is hoarse, barely containing the agony, his words slurred from the split lip.
The other bed had been occupied by Dean until he received a call and drove off with the Impala, leaving Sam to deal with the witch himself. He’d managed with a little help from Cas. Speaking of Cas… Sam brushed some strands of hair out of his face and picked up his phone before returning to the hospital.
“That’s the job.”
“You are not going to let me talk you out of this, are you?”
“That’s your car?”
Sam sighed and left yet another voicemail.
“What?”
“It’s okay, I guess.”
“Good one, Cas. I toldya you’d be good once we started training.”
Sam gulped.
“You were forced. There was nothing else you could’ve done. Don’t get me wrong I would be angry as hell and sad and disappointed. But I would forgive you eventually.”
“Dude, you okay?”
Ok, so this one's a little different from what I've written before, let me know if that was okay or not...
“One last time.”
“Oh. That’s sad.”
Dean sighed once again.
“Cas?”
With that Novak rose from his chair and Dean stood as well.
is going on with you.”
He closed his eyes for a second, listening to the beep his phone made when Charlie replied.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice was still quite high although he really started growing. He met Dean in a crushing hug.
The witch walks over to Cas, kneeling down beside his face.
We’re talking over the phone and it’s really late and I have to get up early in the morning. But still I feel like I should tell her. Tomorrow is Thursday. Thursday is my first date. With Castiel.
Sam grins once more before turning around and leaving. Dean is sure he’s never going to let him forget that he and Cas made out after sparring.
His smile is wide, eyes glowing.
“I am questioning your sense of awe,” Castiel replied between pants, still trying to catch his breath.
“You think I don’t love you back.”
“Well, what can I say, bitches like you deserve to be put down.”
Dean reinforced his grip on Castiel, trying to keep him from moving and hurting himself even more.
“You idiot! You lost your home and your grace and your wings so I could walk around with a clean face?”
“There’s no blackmails, no conditions, nothing. A kidnapper would want something from the girls’ parents, right?”
“Let me go, please, no!”
“Don’t, Sam. I don’t wanna hear it.”
Dean can try to run, he can try to fight but Castiel is always ready. He breaks Dean’s hand and arm effortlessly. Dean groans in agony, falling to his knees.
“You don’t do that to family.”
Dean hates himself for causing Cas’ voice to waver.
“It’s a … uh.. just forget it and climb onto the wall.”
For the blink of an eye nothing happens. Then it starts beeping while the phones are connected. After a short while a gruffy voice answers.
“You know what I want you to do.”
“You’re not going to kill Sam.”
Dean got to his feet.
“I brought you a beer, brother.”
“Cas, why do you want me to come with?” That question had been floating around in his head for over a day now.
Next up is "We were supposed to leave like ten minutes ago."
He didn’t wait for his brother to answer, just opened the door and ran into the evening, oblivious to the cold.
Dean laughed. “Nice. Good for you.”
She digs her teeth into the bite mark on his shoulder. Pain explodes as the wound tears open once again. He doesn’t know if he screams or not but after some moments the pain eases into a throb and he becomes tired. His eyes become heavy, so heavy and all he wants to do is fall asleep.
without looking up from Cas.
“Crowley? He’s not that old, sister. Your demon could be anyone who died a couple hundred years ago. You think that’s old for a demon? Think again.”
“I know, Cas, but I’m the only one who’s going to be arrested.”
“You shouldn’t have to do this.”
Charlie gets that dreamy look she always has when she thinks about a girl that rocks her world. I’d be surprised if she doesn’t have a date with Anna already.
“I’m sort of meeting her, like, this evening.”
Dean looked up at that.
His little brother stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Dean in that pathetic, miserable state.
Dean tries to remember. Was is Tuesday? Or Wednesday? The last days are becoming kind of blurry.
“Dude, that was awesome!”
“Who?”
ee you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
So, that's it. Let me know what you think. Next up is "He didn't mean it."
“Nobody gets to call my boyfriend an idiot other than me,” is what Dean thinks he hears him mutter quietly. He pops his joints and rushes over to Cas, gently probing his head, feeling for injuries.
“Liar,” she says.
But all he manages to say is: “Yeah?”
Dean stopped fighting the tears and pulled Cas into a crushing hug. He shivered when the father’s cold body touched his shirt but didn’t back down. Castiel winced and groaned against Dean’s shoulder. The boy looked at him closely when he spotted a sparkling band around the left thigh pressing against his.
“What? No!”
Dean sighed.
,” he uses airquotes which Dean thinks are kinda dork-ish but cute.
“True,” I say.
After what feels like hours and mere seconds simultaneously we break apart, both trying to remember how to breathe.
“I know. Thanks, Benny.”
Charlie rushed past Dean, that dark haired girl in tow. He could only imagine what they were doing but he stopped his mind right there. Kevin had found a shy Asian girl to talk to about … whatever nerds talked about which left Dean alone in the room. He sighed and decided now was the right time to really get drunk.
stuff like that. Not to mention that Cas and him were both guys.
“What – what are you doing with me?” His eyes are wide with fear as he backs away from Naomi. But the woman just smiles.
“Nah, it’s good.”
“I know, Sam. Believe me, I know. I’m just saying that...”
Castiel’s lips twitched.
She saunters closer, the machete Dean must have dropped swinging by her side. She removes the cloth from his mouth.
A minute later Cas comes in, wearing one of Dean’s
“I hope so. Then you have to call me big brother.”
It was the last Sunday before Christmas when Dean entered the little church he’d spent so many afternoons of the last month in. His heart was beating so furiously in his chest, making him fear that the force might rip it out. Everybody must’ve been able to hear it. He quietly entered the church and took a seat in the last bench.
are useless.” She turns her head to look at Cas’ limp form.
Dean throws another glance at Cas, willing Sam to understand.
The seventieth time he remembers. The throbbing pain in his head turns into a sharp flash, his sight going blank for a second. Castiel can hear a man scream, probably himself, and his throat feels hoarse.
“It’s almost time for dinner, but sure.”
“This is Dean’s other, other phone. You know what to do.”
“I met someone.”
“No problem,” the guy said and turned around. When he saw Dean he froze.
Castiel tries to make himself stop, he can’t hurt Dean, he swore he’d never do that to him, but it just feels
The guy blinked. He seemed oddly familiar but maybe it was the alcohol talking.
“You want me to hit you?” Castiel asks sceptically.
Dean patted him on the back.
“C’mere.”
“Dude, can you read that? I’ve never learned fancy-font.”
Sam hugged his brother and reluctantly Dean reciprocated the embrace.
“I don’t wanna hear any of this. Do you love Castiel?”
“You ever had a good snowball fight?” Dean asked instead, his voice light.
Castiel turned to look at Dean’s hand, then Dean himself who turned his eyes back on the road.
And he was gone. Dean felt the tension in his shoulders fall and relaxed. He exhaled a breath he hadn’t recognized he had been holding and turned back to his friends. Kevin was looking at him wide-eyed, the others smiled and started talking about an algebra class test. Dean was glad about the distraction.
inhaling
He sat at the kitchen table staring at the wall when Sam came home.
Castiel’s mouth went dry.
“Thought you could use it. I don’t have a lot of time. I’m meeting Andrea.”
He’s still trying to catch his breath, inhale, hold, exhale, repeat. The stars are slowly disappearing from his view as the pain decreases into a little throb.
“I’m happy to see you, too, Meg,” he replied grinning.
“Sorry,” I mutter, facing my hands.
Important information. Download and save. God, I’m a freak for thinking like this.
“A witch cursed him. We got here in time, they had to reanimate him during surgery. You wouldn’t answer your phone.”
“Who?”
“I finished school and now I’m at college.”
y bad idea,” Sam growled and crossed his arms. Castiel sighed.
“Who is it? A girl? Come on, Dean, you know I’m going to find out anyway.”
Now, when I say I’ve never been kissed before I mean it. The last person to kiss me was my mom and it was when I was four and she was still alive. Other than that I grew up learning that showing feelings is showing weakness, and voila, here I am, eighteen years old being kissed by a complete stranger outside a club that I really didn’t want to go to. No surprise that Dean.exe stops working.
Charlie slumps into the seat next to me, a whirlwind of fire, enthusiasm and curiousity. I know where this is going so I just wave my hand and beg her to get started.
“No, he doesn’t!”
“Alright, then. Shooting range, now.”
Sam huffed.
“That’s a strange name.”
Cas is lashing out now and Dean is on his knees, trying to wake him from his nightmare and keep him from hurting himself. He gets hit in the face twice despite his fighting skills.
allowed me to stop. I was merciful then, and killed my friend.”
“They found me a week later and beat me until I was half dead. I lay on the dark street, wishing I
“We can relocate our session to a room more appealing to you if you wish,” the reverend offered, obviously noticing Dean’s indisposition.
A cab pulls up and honks and the guy grins.
Castiel’s voice is deep, gravelly and it’s totally not sending shivers down Dean’s spine as he’s eyeing the wall he’s about to climb over.
Dean nodded fiercely. “Good.”
Dean snorts.
“Nah, Imma become a P.E. teacher.”
The demon leaned back and glared at Castiel.
They sat in silence, Dean watching Castiel’s steady breathing, Sam watching Dean.
“Dean?”
“Thanks, Sammy, I guess it will.”
“What? Never?”
Even after Cas stops crying they stay in that position. Castiel’s head tucked under Dean’s chin, nuzzling his neck, his back bare except for the bandages that hide the wounds his wings have left. Dean’s hands holding him stable so Cas doesn’t feel uncomfortable. His slow, steady breath telling Dean that he’s gone back to sleep.
“Shut up.”
“What’s wrong with my car?”
“We told you not to get attached.”
So Dean has decided.
“So what, you drain virgins and then? Drink their blood? Draw a picture? I don’t get it.”
“Sure.”
The skin beneath the spiked chain was covered with scar tissue that had been wrenched open over and over again, dark red almost like the scars on his back.
“I gotta go. I’m sorry.”
“You don’t want to be distracted while fighting,” Castiel quotes him teasingly. He leans down, his mouth so close to Dean’s and still out of his reach. Dean struggles against Cas but it’s futile, the ex-angel’s grip is fierce. Cas fucking
“Part time, Cas.”
when the cold wind hit his face.
Meg smirked and sat down at the last available space before talking to Cas.
“You like this, Cas?”
“Should’ve known you’d figure it out,” Dean said quietly.
Dave nodded and looked at the younger boy with a thoughtful face.
“Alright, chuckles, I’ll be there. But only to make you shut up about it.”
“Sure thing, brother.”
“Sometimes I envy the birds.”
The fiftieth time he doesn’t even ask. He goes for the kill, aims right at the head. He can hear Dean call his name,
They are standing in the gym, because of course the bunker has a gym, and Dean wants to make sure Cas can defend himself.
Castiel felt more than uneasy. It was eating at him slowly, he could almost feel how the teeth scraped over his vessel’s inner organs. Dean sat on the metal chair, bound by the devil’s trap and the line of salt. His hideous demon face laughed at him with evil eyes and the demon’s presence tore at his angelic grace.
He woke with a strange sensation of warmth lingering right outside his reach. The image of blue eyes faded slowly. Then his headache kicked in.
“Damn, didn’t know you swing both ways. Who is he?”
“Oh, shuddup!”
“Dean, what I am going to tell you I have never told anyone else before. Whatever your reaction is I would appreciate if you didn’t share it with other people.”
“How do you talk to them? Like, without stammering and getting all red and tripping over my feet and stuff.”
So that is how you would find me right now if you came to my room. I’m lying on my bed figuring out what to do. Because I can’t just ignore Castiel, can I?
“You know that I got your back, right?”
Sam shook his head.
He might’ve answered that one a little too fast. But he’d told the truth. He wasn’t seeking trouble. Trouble just had a habit of finding him. He didn’t tell her, though.
That's it for today. Next chapter will be called "Your hair is really soft after you wash it.”
“Alright, turns out it’s a witch. Only thing that’s problematic is finding her. I’ve got witch-killing bullets in the trunk and I already gave you my spare gun. You feel ready to hunt a witch?”
Castiel sat next to him but fell quiet. He seemed to be off, his hand was fidgeting ever so slightly. The priest nervously cleared his throat before muttering under his breath something that sounded like
“Why wouldn’t I?”
“Uhm, hi Castiel. It’s me.”
“You know me!”
Castiel hadn’t been meeting with any angels since… Dean didn’t even know when Cas had last met any of his brothers and sisters. That wasn’t a problem in particular. No, the problem was that Castiel began to miss them. Not all of them, from what Dean could tell, but some. So when Cas asked if Dean could accompany him to a meeting of some of his old friends the hunter agreed. There was only one thing that was bugging him.
“How’re ya feeling?” Dean asked without trying to hide his worry.
“So, neglecting his children is okay? We lost our mom, too, Dean. It’s not like she was just Dad’s wife.”
Castiel looks absolutely adorable when he pouts and I have absolutely
The first thing Dean did once he was fully awake was puke his guts out. His skin was hot and sweaty and his head was throbbing like hell and he was feeling like he was gonna die any second. Maybe the bottle of whiskey hadn’t been the best of his ideas.
Sam smiled widely and went to fetch the girl who’d been standing next to him, looking a bit lost.
“It’s okay,” Dean replies in what he hopes is a soothing voice. “I’ve got you, it’s okay.”
“I’ve been tempted. I’ve given in to temptation for too long, Dean. When I told you about my past, part of me hoped for you to forgive me still but the other half knew I was headed for a dark path.”
“So, you two want a booth at the back?”
Now there were tears shining in Cas’ eyes.
“Seeya, Cas.”
Dean turned his head to look at Castiel. Snowflakes were caught in his dark lashes, his blue eyes so vibrant they made the sky look pale. The
“Lady, I have no idea. You knocked me out, remember?”
“I don’t feel good, to be honest. I am not in pain, though.”
“Don’t you dare touching him!”
“Thanks. Good to hear that. I might stop by.”
“This was Neil. He always cared for me. He brought me sweet blood. You don’t know what it’s like to not be able to leave the house. I would’ve died but he… he helped me. Loved me.”
“Yes, Sam, I’m sure, now go and read a book or watch Doctor Who or whatever.”
She sighs dramatically.
“I have no idea who half of these people are but, hey, we’re having fun, right?”
“Bitch.”
“Good morning, Dean.”
“I’m not a good person.”
A chuckle from the other side.
I've also written a Fic around Castiel and Dean in the crypt scene of 08.17 "Goodbye Stranger" called
Dean was rendered speechless. There was a sadness in Castiel’s eyes that he had rarely seen before. He took a closer look, almost drowning in those big, bright blue eyes. No, that’s not sadness, he corrected himself, that’s shame and self-loathing. This time, Dean sighed deeply.
He rolls off him and turns to thread his arms around Cas’ waist, lifting the weight off his injured back.
“I apologize for causing that.”
Dean decides to move. Away from the city where he met Cas. Away from the memories. Away from the
“I manage. More important: How are you?”
“So I suppose this means you want to meet again?,” Castiel asks and I exhale slowly. Thank God I don’t have to say it myself.
“Well, I don’t care. People always get more than they deserve.”
No matter how ugly the fight has been Castiel’s clothes are clean. No matter how much of Dean’s blood is splattered onto him during his sessions in Heaven, the moment he’s back on Earth they are gone. So is his memory.
“You know, it’s nice to have a vessel that’s unoccupied. I’m glad I’m me, actually. There’s no little pathetic human conscience sitting in my head, screaming.”
“I’m good.”
“Nice catch, Sammy.”
“Alright, alright, Cas and I are on our way.”
“Never gonna happen, Sasquatch.”
Sam nodded. “I know, I’ll be home by ten and I’ll get out of bed no matter what.”
“What?”
“Hey, angel, it’s me.”
“It’s okay, Sammy, you don’t need to stand by, Cas is very able to do the job.”
Christmas was getting closer. There was another week until Jesus’ birthday when Charlie called him.
Sam shakes his head.
“You killed my nest.”
When I come home after school the next day the first thing I want to do is to shower. Bobby is in the garage as always, working on cars. The Lincoln is done and ready to go but the owner hasn’t shown yet. I wonder who the hell would like to drive that freaking pimp mobile. It’s gross.
The demon made him shut up as he pressed his lips on Castiel’s. His vessel reacted instantly, let Dean in, let him deepen the kiss. He tasted like ash and fire and sin and Castiel felt nausea crawling up his throat. Dean tasted
There’s something like hope in Dean’s voice. Sam smiles.
Dean felt like he had been stabbed in the back.
Two fingers reach around his head and touch his forehead.
“I’m sorry, Dean, I –”
“Let’s get back to Sam and we’ll tell you what you need to know.”
“Sure. Maybe you’re right, I do feel a little sore. Good luck.”
Sam snatched the bottle from Dean’s hands and flushed the amber liquid down the sink. Dean tried to protest but his brother wouldn’t have any of it.
“Go and sleep and pray you don’t have a hangover tomorrow. We’ll talk later.”
“What happened to you?”
He didn’t believe it, though.
“Alright, scoot over.”
“I know it’s hard but believe me, it’s worth the effort.”
“Any time.”
t sure he could resist the demon’s pleading. He would probably let him go.
He knew that voice. He knew that person. Dean’s eyes had adjusted to the dark and when he saw those angry red scars marring Castiel’s back he couldn’t stop himself from gasping.
“Cas, I’m sorry.”
Dean had miscalculated his weight, though and Castiel’s momentum shoved him back into Dean who stumbled but kept himself upright.
I rub my hand over my brow.
Dean’s breath ghosted over Castiel’s skin.
Cas grabs Dean around the waist and supports him outside the building and into the car.
Somebody is clearing his throat, making Dean and Cas jump.
“It’s a metaphor, Cas. He’s depressed because his girlfriend’s dead.”
Dean looks horrible. Castiel wants to help him, wants to take the pain away from him. Dean whimpers quietly as the angel reaches forward.
“You don’t remember anything?”
“What?”
“Only after you tell me what the
“Yeah.”
“He didn’t tell me that his angel mojo was a little low. Otherwise I wouldn’t have let him join me.”
“Dean, Castiel, this is Jessica, she’s my girlfriend.”
Castiel sighed and shifted in Dean’s arms. He could feel how the young priest flinched at every little movement.
Cas smiled, one that reached his eyes this time.
Everybody knew Crowley was dealing with illegal stuff. Everybody also knew he was earning some good money with it. It annoyed the hell out of Dean because, honestly, he was certainly no angel, but making a deal with a demon? Even he wasn’t that stupid.
Cas turns around and watches Dean in confusion.
“He’s not only pretty but also smart.”
“I like it when you take control like that.”
“You’re tense. You’ve got something on your mind.”
“You already seen a hairbrush?”
“No, Sammy, I’m telling you, it’s not a ghost … Hell, I don’t know, maybe a witch? … Yes, they’re in the trunk. Also, Cas knows how to shoot. … Shut up, bitch. Yeah, I’ll call when we’re done.”
Castiel became serious again.
“Like, a godess?” Dean asks, keeping the witch talking. His back begins to hurt from the uncomfortable position he’s in.
Dean smiles fondly while carefully taking off the bandages and gently cleaning the wound before adding ointment and wrapping them up with new band-aids.
“Sure he is. Maybe his family’s orthodox,” Dean replied with a shrug.
“I call you angel because you’re such a good person that even as a human you are… angelic.”
Dean grinned.
“Hey, Dean! Good to see you!”
Dean’s hand bounces back as if he’s been burnt. He tries to ban the hurt look from his eyes before Cas sees it but he’s too late, believing the look that Cas’ eyes give him.
“They are dicks, all of them. You’re talking bullshit, you know that? I know I can’t see your wings but I bet they look awesome anyways. Nobody cares if your wings are black or white.”
“You. My freedom. My brother’s head on a stick. A good slice of pizza.”
“I thought you’re supposed to be our father, not a closed minded sonofabitch!”
His hand touched a piece of paper. With a frown Dean grabbed it and took a closer look. It was a simple envelope, the edges were crumpled but the handwriting was still readable. The small, clean letters made Dean’s heart beat faster. He’d totally forgotten about the letter Sam had brought home the other day. Knowing he would only increase his heartache he opened it and began to read.
Ten years. Castiel has been looking for Dean for ten years. He’s been writing novels and books and become a best seller, he’s been travelling around the US, always looking for a man with brown hair, green eyes and freckles around the nose, named Dean Winchester. After ten years of looking and searching, of finding hope just to find people who are similar to Dean, he‘s finally found him. Two times Castiel was about to blow it all off. To become a hermit, write his stories and live until one day the Grim Reaper might come for him. But here he is. After ten years he’s standing on the front porch of the house belonging to the man he’s fallen in love with so long ago. Castiel can hear the familiar roar of the Impala. After ten years he’s still kept it. He slowly turns around, a tiny smile on his lips.
“If you’re free next week I’m going to show you the holy grail of pop culture.”
Dean doesn’t listen to his brother on the phone because right now his priority is to not freak out. He normally isn’t a person who goes crazy easily. But he’s got every right to freak out because he’s never been rejected like that ever before. Dean tries to swallow the lump in his throat that has been there ever since Cas left the apartment.
On the first few days Dean decided to not collaborate with the workers because, honestly, he didn’t need that crap. He also managed to get into a fight with another guy which ended with him being in isolation. He
“We’re just going to the movies.”
“Dean!”
Novak gestured toward Dean’s mouth.
“You think I want to preach to you.”
“Shuddup!”
“I understand. Have a good night.”
There was a comfortable silence between them where both, the teenager and the reverend, were taking in the peaceful moment.
Cas smells good, so good. Dean can’t describe what Cas smells like because he doesn’t know, he just smells like, well, Cas.
“You are lucky, Dean. It’s not severe.”
Cas hums in agreement, absentmindedly running his fingers through Dean’s strands. Dean doesn’t want him to stop. But his back aches from sitting like this and he needs to get some rest so he gets up. The fingers disappear from his head.
“Not exactly your M.O. sacrificing
Dean leaned back to look into Cas’ eyes.
“No, you’re not. When’s the last time you slept?”
Castiel turns his head to lock his eyes with Dean’s.
“Yeah, me too.”
“I am far from sure. I just have faith that God will guide and protect me.”
“Whatever. You want me to come with, I’m coming with.”
“Wake up, Cas, it’s me.”
“Do you remember our conversations in detention center?”
Sam didn’t even have to think before he answered.
Sam snapped out of his thoughts when he realized Dean’s voice was wavering.
There’s a painful throbbing behind Castiel’s eyes and he doesn’t know why. He follows Naomi's orders. This time he thrusts the angel blade right through Dean’s back after only half an hour of waiting, fighting with his conscience. He doesn’t remember anything, not the blood on his hands, not the desperate whispers as he tries to revive his best friend. Not how Naomi is a little more pleased than before.
“What has you in such a good mood?”
“Sure thing. You want me to bring that waffle iron again?”
When Castiel turned up on his door step to offer his help Sam hadn’t said no. Killing a witch was not easy and now that he didn’t have Dean as his partner even more so. What Sam didn’t know was the fact that Cas was low on angel juice.
“For what?”
.” Dean gulps for air as if he has trouble breathing. “It’s me.”
He pockets his phone and turns to Cas.
“Don’t take His name in vain, Dean.”
That’s how I end up riding shotgun next to my crush (yes, I’m admitting it, Charlie, shut up) on the way to our date.
He turns to leave. I can finally move again, my head getting less foggy with every second. He’s almost gone before I manage to croak out, “What’s you’re name?”
“You’re not fully charged.”
“You know Eileen
Dean was glued to Castiel’s lips. He knew it was probably not the right way to react but Castiel had a way with words that filled the story with life, with pain.
“What’s going on?”
“Yeah, it does.”
“Nonono, that’s not what I’m saying. I was just wondering why you’d want me with you?”
“Dean, why is he doing that? I thought he’s a teacher.”
“I will tend to his wounds,” Castiel reassures him. Sam shoots Dean a questioning look.
He forced himself to see through the demon, to look at the human underneath, the man he’d long ago fallen in love with.
. He takes a look at his watch and then decides it’s too early for him to be awake, so he snuggles deeper into the pillows and Cas’ embrace before dozing off to sleep once more.
“I really would like to kiss you,” he murmurs that I have to listen very hard to understand him.
I tell her to shut it and end the call. She won’t be angry.
No, him being (secretly) bi wasn’t the problem. The problem was that the dude he seemed to like was nine years older and a friggin’
“Dean – – ”
Sam is still talking but Dean doesn’t know what about.
“Castiel, I’m sorry but – –”
Another groan escapes Dean’s lips and he tenses the moment the angel’s hand touches his face. Castiel lets his grace travel over Dean’s body and heal the bruises and broken bones. Dean watches in disbelief and wonder as his skin becomes smooth and the cuts and all the blood disappear. His eyes find Castiel’s and the angel is sure his human charge can read them like an open book.
Dean’s eyes darken.
The witch turns around, annoyance clear in her face. Cas inches closer to the door, inch by inch.
And maybe, Dean thinks, maybe broken hearts can be put back together.
“You feel better?”
“Bitch.”
Charlie slowly exhales.
Cas curls into his embrace, seeking Dean’s warmth and strength. Dean holds him, mumbling nonsense to calm him down, his thumb rubbing little circles onto Cas’ back. His tears are wetting Dean’s pajamas but that’s the least of his problems. It’s not Cas’ first nightmare but they’ve become more frequent, more violent, they hurt Cas in ways that almost make Dean cry. He would do anything to take that pain away from Cas. Literally anything.
This. This made him happy. This was worth fighting for. And when Castiel was sound asleep, his head in Dean’s lap, the boy stroked those black strands of hair muttering quietly.
“Do what?”
“Ouch. Sorry, man.”
They sat together in mutual silence before Sam said: “Talk to him, Dean. Show him you care about him and he’ll open up.”
As always, I'm happy to receive feedback and if you find any mistakes just tell me, I'd like to improve my English.
“How are you, Dean?” Sam asked.
But Gabriel chuckles and gets some from the fridge anyway. He places it on the table next to Castiel and Dean and winks at his little brother.
“Not a big deal? He gave you his freaking number, Dean. Have you called him?”
Dean’s breath hitched in his throat when Castiel’s blue eyes looked directly at him, into his very soul. They widened with recognition before he turned to look at the other believers. Dean felt disappointment settling deep inside him.
The father chuckled. “I’m twenty-six. I’ve been ordained half a year ago.”
“I really liked tonight, Dean.”
“It’s a nickname, ya know.”
“How are you, Dean?”
“Head up, girl. I’m gonna come visit.”
Chuck, Michael and Raphael are waiting for him in the kitchen when Castiel comes home. They seem to know how it ended. Not that there has been any other way.
“Cas. It’s shorter and everybody uses it.”
“I’d do anything for him.”
“Yeah, whatever. I’m fine, okay?”
The hunter chuckles. “I know.”
“Just asking if you’re actually going to hunt that ghost or if I should let Garth take care of it.”
“That what? That being drunk is taking care of his sons? That you faking his signature so I can go to class trips is supposed to happen?”
Dean groaned once again and pinched the bridge of his nose to fight the headache. He then slipped his arm into the dark ravine between his bed and the wall feeling for his phone.
That's it for now. Next prompt is "W-what happened?"
“Sammy, I’m going out!”
“I don’t know, dude, maybe it’s better if you sit this one out. We don’t want your shoulder to go crazy after what the vamps did to you, right?”
He stands and goes, willing himself not to be too disappointed because, of course Cas doesn’t care about him like that, of course he doesn’t love him back. Not the way Dean loves Cas. But the rejection still hurts.
Castiel blushed slightly and shook his head.
He knows Cas is avoiding him, for the first time since he’s turned human. It makes Dean’s heart ache and he wants to reach out so desperately to touch him, to let him know that he’s there and will listen to him although he doesn’t know how to talk about feelings. For Cas he wants to try.
Cas doesn’t answer but continues to carefully touch the back of Dean’s head where the vamp knocked him out.
“I want to hear it. Clearly.”
Castiel’s heart is pounding wildly in his chest as he knocks at Dean’s door once more. He can do this. He can stand here and tell the love of his life that he screwed up and is going to stay if he’d still want him. He can do this. He’s stood here a hundred times, knocking on the door, waiting for Dean to open. But nothing happens. Maybe Dean’s out. Castiel sits down on the door step and waits. People come and go. After an hour an old lady opens her apartment door and smiles at him sympathetically.
I can’t wipe the smile from my face. Not this evening, not the next day, not the D&D weekend with Charlie and Ash. I get my fair share of mock and bicker but I know my friends are happy for me. I can’t wait for the next week to be over…
“I think it says H. P. Lovecraft.”
And that’s the moment all Hell breaks loose.
cottish accent.
So, you see, it’s not like I don’t want to do sports. So what if I’m not ripped? I get by and by all means I’m not fat, or am I? Most of the P.E. lessons I spend trying not to be hit by the ball of whatever stupid game the coach wants us to play this time. I already had to have my glasses replaced two times because some douchebag threw the ball directly into my face. Not that the coach cares.
Seeya
Cas stands, too.
She takes his hand and Castiel can feel a numb kind of fog cloud his mind as his resistance crumbles. He follows Naomi into the white, clean room.
“Nothing,” he replies, looking at the steering wheel.
She waves her hand around her face. The make up, the hair, the leather, the
“Alright, kiddo, relax.”
Dean wasn’t answering the phone. Sam was getting more nervous with every ring, silently begging for his brother to pick up the damn thing. This was the third time he called.
A skinny figure knelt in front of a wooden cross, the pale skin almost glowing against the darkness surrounding him. He was only wearing a pair of boxers and shivered in the cold. He was rocking back and forth slightly, head bowed down, whispering quietly. As Dean stepped closer he started to hear a strained voice pleading.
He’s fucking
Cas doesn’t get the joke but that’s okay because his confusion grows and is just fucking adorable.
“If you do not wish to…,” Cas started but Dean interrupted him instantly.
Sam really doesn’t give up, though. After another three calls Dean knows he won’t let him off the hook so easily and knowing that he’ll bother him the whole night he accepts the call.
“I still win.”
“So, what do you have on your mind, Dean?”
I manage to nod. Castiel and I walk into the Roadhouse and take in the smell, the ambience, all the stuff that I remember from playing with Jo when I was little. Ellen is nowhere in sight but her daughter is grinning at us, waving from behind the counter.
Castiel looked strikingly handsome with his tousled hair and the dark slacks and shirt, the white collar sticking out from the dark fabric. His blue eyes seemed to glow when he started to talk in that deep, gravelly voice of his. Dean found once again that he soaked it all in. The sermon, the prayers, everything. He was enthralled by the way Castiel preached. By the end he might have at least a little faith. He still dreaded the moment it was over and there’d be nobody but him and the father.
Relief flooded Castiel’s senses.
“I didn’t want to worry you, Dean.”
Talking to Cas is nice. He’s witty, smart, funny. Time goes by and before I know it, it’s dark and late and I must yawn. I’m not tired. I can’t be tired now.
“Because your family bribes the police and my family has a man in jail already. Are you ready to jump over that thing?”
“So pure.”
Dean’s eyes hadn’t left Castiel’s face for one moment. Sam sighed.
“What the hell just happened?” Dean’s still a little out of breath but the pained expression has left his beautiful face although the hurt look remains in his eyes, mixed with relief.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel muttered.
Meg just nodded.
Dean sighed. “Alright. Just… talk to me next time, okay?”
“I’m gonna meet him tomorrow.”
He gave his boyfriend a peck on the lips before grabbing an angel blade and his jacket.
He doesn’t expect the visitor when he comes back from work. There’s an old, rundown punkass car standing in front of his garage. Dean cuts out the engine and walks to his front door. A man is standing beneath the canopy, seeking safety from the burning Texan sun. He’s wearing a trench coat, oblivious to the heat, seeming oddly familiar. Then the man turns around and Dean stops breathing.
Okay, is he teasing now, or…
rude. Well done. Castiel frowns.
Dean approached the chair Sam had left and sat down pinching the bridge of his nose. He felt a bad migraine incoming and tried to ignore the pain behind his eyes and the bright lights coming from the ceiling of the room.
!” A weak hand tries to stop him as Castiel kneels down in front of Dean.
The guys’ full lips form an understanding “o” before laughing himself.
“Cas, look at this.”
“Yeah, I will.”
“Breathe, Sammy, breathe.
“Fried eggs and bacon sound good?”
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Now, I smell food. Real food. Where’s the kitchen?”
He pulls Dean down for a short kiss and suppresses a groan as the wounds on his back open once again.
“Good, jerk.”
“Shut up.”
“It’s a Colt .45 M1911A1, I did the engraving and handle parts myself.” He indicates the ivory handle parts that he is actually really proud of. It’s one of the few things he allowed himself to craft, similar to what other people would’ve called a hobby.
She scowls.
Sam squeezed Dean’s shoulder in encouragement (honestly, how was a kid like Sam able to behave like a freakin’ grown-up?) and left the room.
“How about pancakes for breakfast?”
“Well, I guess Charlie has no taste, then. He’s really missing out.”
Dean hugged her good-bye, gave her the cigarettes and then he was gone, out of that thing. It had only been a month but it had been long enough. He got some more stuff from the office, did some paper work, promised Carlson not to get into trouble and then he was truly free.
Dean sighs deeply.
“As I said, do something wrong and you get the wrong kind of attention. It’ll heal.”
“I’m sorry, man.”
Alright, I’m not saying I never do sports. I do. Well, at least I did dancing before Dad told me he didn’t raise a girl. So I stopped. I tried wrestling but I’m really bad. Sometimes I watch Sam with his basketball games and the little jerk is really good.
Sam laughed. “No, it’s not you. Something upset him. Was there anyone insulting Cas?”
Meg rolled her eyes at that comment.
Castiel is lying on his bed trying to figure out if he should text Dean and ask him if he’s alright or if he’s just being overanxious. He’d been a little disappointed when Dean told him he didn’t want him to come with and support him while he talks to his father but he does respect Dean’s choices and told him to call when it’s over. So far there’s been nothing. It’s not that Castiel gets antsy or anything, it’s just… he’s worried.
Dean takes hold of the gun and aims it at the target, making sure his foot work is right, motioning for Cas to mimic him.
“Just remember, safe sex, Sammy. And clean up after you.”
“I would never. You see, pretty boy, sometimes it’s so much more fun to tell the truth. It hurts so much more.”
“Help me? I don’t need help, feathers. I’m peachy.”
His little brother sighs deeply before arguing back.
“What do you mean, you’ve never seen Star Wars? Dude, where do you live?”
The table was laid for six but only five places where occupied. Dean and Cas were sitting next to each other, on the opposite side Sam and Jess were discussing a subject from school. At the head of the table sat John, as close to sober as he could get. The other end was still free.
“What the hell is going on with you?”
“Charlie’s a girl and she’s a lesbian.”
face and Dean grins, changing back into more comfortable clothes.
“You’re a demon.”
She laughed. “Oh, please, don’t!”
The guy turns around and raises his eyebrow.
The father looked at him, bloodshot eyes deep-set, dark circles around them creating a high contrast to the peaked white skin.
Dean’s voice is quiet and hoarse and Sam thinks he’s been crying. They sit in companionable silence for a while, watching the stars like they had done when they were little.
“So, what are you thinking? Ghosts?”
“I really am not in the mood right now, so
Dean didn’t talk to Sam when he came home. He just rushed past his father and the TV and slammed the bathroom door shut. After he splashed water into his face he took a look in the mirror. He didn’t really like what he saw. Sure, he was what people would call handsome. But there were freckles all over his face. Whenever his face turned into either a tomato or an ice cube those little spots would stand out like rainbow sprinkles on a chocolate cake.
Dean’s voice is weak. Castiel presses his lips onto his forehead before shouting for his brother.
waffles.”
Dean radiated temptation. His hair was longer than it had been when they had parted and it didn’t make him less attractive. His green eyes were sparkling with a provocative look, making it hard for Castiel to suppress a groan. And lastly there was his smirk. The left corner of his mouth was barely raised, giving Castiel the impression that he was being played with. Sam had been right. It was a very bad idea. Castiel swallowed heavily.
“You noticed he’s off, too, right? It’s not just me.”
Sam gives Dean a funny look but nods.
“Yes, Cas?” Dean says sweetly.
“You care a lot about your brother,” the man observed. Dean nodded.
He groaned and his hands fidgeted as he tried to come up with any way of getting out of this situation without talking to his brother. But there was none.
“Just saying, man, I’d like to do that again.”
Sam’s mood darkened.
Castiel fell silent. Dean’s head was spinning from all the information.
Sam sighed.
When Sam came back into the room he smiled to himself at the joined hands that Dean tried to hide from him but being the good little brother he was he didn’t say anything.
So Cas is not dead. That’s good, Dean thinks. Very good. Now he only needs to get out of this situation. His wrists hurt from the rope that’s cutting into the skin. She’s taken his knives. All of them. Dean tries not to groan in frustration.
“Screw you, bitch.”
“Nothing,” Cas says and points his chin at Dean’s black eye.
I put the book away. I’m not going to get any work done anyway.
The father smiled.
“Shit, Cas, you’re scaring me, what’s wrong?”
Dean sighed.
“Anytime, angel.”
“It’s late,” Cas says. I nod.
Every now and then when the nurses weren’t looking Dean would turn to Cas and place a kiss on those chapped lips because they really are very kissable. It has quickly turned into one of Dean’s favorite things, kissing Cas and eating pie.
He steadies Cas and waits for him to sit up before moving into a sitting position himself. Castiel doesn’t look at him.
“That’s what I said.”
She walked past him and entered the kitchen, stopping when she spotted Castiel.
Sam nodded.
That caught Dean by surprise.
He scooped some snow from the ground while dodging another of Castiel’s missiles. He ran after the father, grabbed his coat and rubbed the snow into his neck where the collar wouldn’t cover the skin. Castiel jumped and froze and fought to get Dean off him. And he kind of lost his balance and fell but grabbed onto Dean’s jacket. Dean wasn’t prepared for that, so they both hit the ground and lay next to each other in the snow, panting, the cold biting their faces.
“Cas, look at me.”
Feel free to leave dialogue suggestions, I'd appreciate that.
“What’re you talking about?”
“Are you getting yourself into fights on purpose?”
His little brother crossed his arms in front of his chest and turned his head expectantly.
“No, it’s not.”
romantic relationship stuff. And I… get by.”
Dean also considered asking Meg for advice but on second view that was a very bad idea. He wondered how the petite girl was doing. He knew he couldn’t keep all his confusing emotions locked away forever but who could he talk to?
Castiel groaned. He didn’t miss the way Dean’s eyes were sizing him up suggestively. It made him imagine things that were very… sinful.
“I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Dean chuckled. He didn’t seem to be concerned by the devil’s trap. He was relaxed.
Castiel and Dean settle in on a girly romance (Dean’s pick after he’s threatened he’d couch Castiel if he ever told Sam. Or Gabriel. Or anyone.) it doesn’t take long before Castiel can hear Dean’s breathing become steadier. He sofly kisses the tip of his boyfriend’s nose and murmurs, “Love you,” before shutting his eyes as well.
Dean smiles at that. Boyfriend. Cas is his boyfriend. He’s never had a boyfriend before. He’s never met anyone before that he is drawn to the way he’s drawn to Cas. There had been Cassie, of course, and Lisa. But they just weren’t Cas. Dean doesn’t know how else to explain it. It’s Cas he wants. Only Cas. Dean doesn’t like to think about what exactly that is suggesting.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Yeah.”
“Because he gave you his number which means he likes you. Do I have to explain the birds and the bees to you?”
The beeping sounds were gone and the tension slowly left the room and the corridor. Sam followed the nurse’s order and sat down.
“Come here.”
Dean chuckled.
“Dean, say something, please.”
When he
Castiel wants nothing more than just snap out of it. He wants it so badly his chest hurts. But his arm is raised, ready to thrust the deadly angel blade into Dean’s torso, to kill him, to lose him. Forever.
“What would you think of me if I was forced to torture and kill someone I’m really close to, like Charlie for example?”
“It’s not nothing because it’s bothering you.”
Then, “I’m sorry.”
“Let me go,” the priest whispered, his eyes unfocused, darting from left to right and back again.
He then passed Dean and exited the church, not waiting for Dean to follow him.
Dean smiled sadly at the horror in Sam’s eyes.
There it is again. The mocking tone, as if my name was a joke only he understands.
Dean ate his sandwich and decided to ignore Meg’s comments
“You win,” Dean murmurs quietly, blushing hard, avoiding Cas’ eye.
“I bet you might look even cuter in glasses.”
“When I grabbed you tight and raised you from perdition I almost didn’t survive. Hellfire caught my wings, burnt my feathers and turned them black.”
Dean didn’t answer. He stood in the room and although he wasn’t a small person he seemed to shrink with every second that ticked away. The air seemed to become thick. Sam cleared his throat before saying: “I, uh, give you some time, I guess...”
She sighed.
“Cas, what are you doin’, man?”
“Maybe.”
At twelve he had lunch (no need to mention that it was gross) and then even more work and after that, at five, he had some free time. Dean mostly used it to hustle some poker games or to breathe some fresh air in the yard. When he got lucky he could talk to the nice prison guard with the dark hair. He didn’t know her name, but he had only been in here for a few days, so that kinda explained that.
“So, you think my car is a pimp mobile?”
He frowned for a second as if in thought, then turned to Castiel once again.
Sam watches his brother walk away. It doesn’t feel as bad this time.
Dean closed his eyes and shook his head.
“Yup. I’m gonna meet her at the movie theater tomorrow. We’re going to watch the Planet of the Apes marathon because she does enjoy good works of fiction despite her…”
“Alright,” Dean says and takes hold of his favorite handgun. “Dad gave it to me when I was twelve. He thought it was a good birthday present.”
“So… you and Anna been hitting it off?”
Dean shakes his head and heads toward a dark hole in the ruin that has once been a mansion. He tries to ignore that unpleasant feeling that’s gnawing in his gut and steps over the wooden half-rotted threshold.
He frowned in confusion.
“You really scared me back in the church, man. Don’t do this again.”
Sam gave him one of his bitch-faces and Dean felt himself giving in.
The nights were the worst. It was because there was so much going through his head. Sammy. Dad. Mom. Although it mostly was Sammy. His cuts and bruises. He was only thirteen, goddammit!
of the girl. I think about Castiel, about the piece of paper in the transparent phone case, folded up neatly in case I decide to actually… but what if it’s a prank? It wouldn’t be the first time someone would be making fun of me.
The nurse shifted uncomfortably.
Dean would never admit that he was lonely but apparently he was. School was being worse every day as nobody forgot about what he (supposedly) had done. The rumours would’ve been funny if Dean wasn’t the one receiving the disgust and hate from all the other students and teachers. According to a freshman he had stolen a gun and shot two other students. He’d heard another boy say he’d strangled three children to death. His favorite one was the one where he had joined a satanist sect and had robbed a bank in order to pay the supplies for their dark rituals. Yeah, school was crap.
“Your man. Where is he? He’s hiding. I want to know where.”
Castiel took out the syringe he’d been holding and injected the blood into the demon’s veines. When Dean sunk down to the floor Castiel exhaled in relief, letting Sam come in and together they strapped their friend and brother back to the chair, reinforcing the devil’s traps.
Nothing happens.
It’s not the first time Sam speaks up against John but it’s the first time he totally means what he says. Every word of it. Sam leaves the house and goes looking for his brother. There are a few places where Dean likes to go when he wants to be alone but being the annoying little brother Sam is, he knows every spot. So it doesn’t take him long to actually find Dean. He’s sitting on a swing, moving back and forth slowly. Sam quietly sits down next to him.
The silence answered him. Dean sighed and peered at the clipboard whose paper announced the angel’s injuries. Cuts, bruises, broken bones, a light concussion, bloodloss. Nothing fatal, not even for a human.
Dean popped his head into Sam’s room and found his little brother sitting on his bed, face still red.
“Thank you Dean, I’m fine.”
“He said he’s fine.”
Dean rubbed his eyes and tried not to imagine how Castiel would look like in the shower. Wet. Naked. He shook his head as if that would help losing those images. He heard a muffled response and decided his angel was okay before he headed to the kitchen in search of a beer.
Dean somehow managed to reach his room and fell into his bed. He was instantly asleep.
It’s Cas. Of course it’s Cas. He cuts the ropes open and helps Dean off the chair, handing him a piece of cloth to put over his wound.
“That’s none of your business. Dean’s got to learn to follow orders.”
“Hey, Gabe, can you get us some ice cream?”
“Charlie…”
Dean swallowed.
“Dean, you’re seventeen.”
“Dean, what’s wrong?”
“Stop it, Dean!”
“What makes you think they don’t?” Dean asks.
“Dad? Hey, uhm, it’s been a while. I’m back, you know.”
“Euh… what?”
Dean came home soon. Sam was in his room doing homework and his dad was sitting in front of the TV watching sports although Dean seriously doubted that he was actually seeing any of it. The bottle of liquor stood next to the armchair where he could easily reach it. It was half empty.
Dean warred with himself before gently picking up Cas’ hand once again.
It does make sense, though. He’s the one who broke the First Seal. He’s the one who brought the apocalypse over everybody, the one who isn’t even capable of saving his own family. Sam gives him a funny look but Dean ignores him and heads out, intending to find a bar and get wasted.
