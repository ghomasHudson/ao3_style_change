happen if you sleep.  I am losing the fight.  I clench my teeth.  Expecting the shattered molar to provide enough stimulation to keep me awake for
“I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have pushed you.”  I say, although the word sorry is too feeble.  I stagger back to sit on the chair, on the edge.  My legs feel weak.  I grab the towel off the floor and wipe my own face.  The water leaves pink spots on the towel.
“There was a lot that led up to it.  It was pretty soon after my wife had died, I was, I was grieving, I guess, and I blamed him for what happened.  I hadn’t seen him for months; I needed the space.  Then he just barged back into my life and dragged me into his chaos.  He was high, not at all himself, he attacked someone else, I intervened.  I took it too far.  I know I did, but I had to stop him.”
He fiddles with the control panel on the bed and it sits me up.  My muscles complain at the movement.  He holds a plastic water bottle to my lips; my hand covers his to control the amount of water.
“What you did last night was....”  I begin as he trails a single finger along the length of my twitching cock.  Regaining my thoughts, I have to speak in a rush to get the words out, “I was, um, I was worried about you all night.”
“Yeah, loads.” He says, and I laugh, I never know when to take him seriously.
“You’re welcome.”
“All this.”
“Morning.” He mumbles into my shoulder.
“Whatever you want to say, It’s alright.”  I tell him.
I’ve seen his skin; the marks that he never mentions.  I asked him about it once.  He told me he’d had a night with Irene Adler.  I had been so surprised by that that I nearly choked on my cuppa and then he changed the subject.  I don’t know if I believed it, even back then.  Not that they had been together, they might well have been, there was clearly some chemistry between them.  What I didn’t truly believe that she had left those marks on him.  Now, I am sure he was deflecting.  That he clearly did not want to talk about what had really happened.  Shit, it must have been bad.  He is private by nature, but to outright lie about it shows he really must have been motivation to avoid the subject.
“Oh, of course we will.  It’s warm as toast.  You’ll love it.”
He is thoroughly too smug.  I undo the top few buttons on his shirt and lean in to take his nipple between my teeth.  Lick at it with the tip of my tongue while I hold it in place with my teeth.  He moans softly.  This is my favourite way to see him.  It is worth the stress of intimacy to see him like this.
He is too smart to fall for my hopeless apologies, but I try to ring him on the way to work.  I need to explain, to apologise again, a hundred times over.  He ignores my calls.
He strides away before I can answer.
Mycroft looks at me and I nod for him to move on.
Then a smile settles, and he says “Night.”
“On the balance, I think you were actually pretty nice to her, I might have said worse.”
I think he is already asleep but when I climb under the covers next to him, he says, “Tomorrow night just come up here, don’t wait until the middle of the night.”
“Sherlock, John and I are having a little bet.  I think that Peter Sutcliffe was born in 1942 but John is absolutely sure it was 1948. Can you clear it up for us?”
I am surprised when she turns up with two other cleaners in tow.  A bald man with only two front teeth, who looks like one of Sherlock’s Irregulars and a young guy that looks like a college professor.  I had assumed that they would give me a quote and leave, only to return tomorrow if I was very lucky.  I had half expected that they would decline the job, leaving me to try to sort it out.  I had visions of trying to clean the roof with a mop and bucket.  Thankfully, they save me from that task and begin at once.
Then there is the bequest of the man’s own father and all the guilt and shame that apparently comes with him.  I wonder if even someone as strong as Sherlock can shake off the power of that suggestion.  Sherlock has quite enough to deal with, without adding more to his problems.
Heed the tags on this chapter and if you feel that something may be triggering please make safe choices.  However, if you have followed this series so far, you should be fine with this one.
I pause.  Clear my throat.
Holmes burst into the room, all flailing arms and spraying raindrops.  Coat and hat and scarf were jettisoned; the gloves were tossed upon the sofa, where Holmes rejoined them seconds later.  He slumped there in spreadeagle, head thrown back and eyes tight shut.
“Lestrade,” I said, relieved to have the answer right at last.
“But where?”
“For once,” I said, “I am planning precisely nothing but this.  With the added bonus of sandwiches.”
“Yes.  Yes, it is.”  I hesitated, then:  “Holmes, I apologise for yesterday.  My conduct was unseemly, and--”
Holmes turned his head.
One week later, there were two letters in the mail.
“Then we'll have breakfast,” he said, loosening my hand, smoothing the tablecloth.  “But why aren't you at
Our dishes mopped clean with hunks of fresh bread, we ordered three brandies and sat back to smoke.  Victor told us his situation, then: of his being the sole beneficiary in his late Aunt Augusta's will.  The prospect overwhelmed him.
“Sandwiches would be lovely, thank you,” I said, as our landlady passed through.  “Ham and mustard?”
Leaning in towards his ear, I pressed moist lips to lobe and tragus.
“Like Adams and young Dooley,” said my friend.  He sniffed, and stood.  “Oh well, come on, or we'll be late for eggs on toast.”
“I understand,” I said.
“Thank you, thank you both,” said he.  “For all that you have done.  I can hardly tell you just how relieved my Victor is.  He won't admit it but he was fair worried out of his mind as to what might happen with the house.  He will likely keep it, Mr. Holmes.  My word – imagine if he had sold it as it was with that hidden cache behind the wall!  It hardly bears any thinking, eh?”
“Yes.”
“It just needs time.”
There was a little bakery on the main road passing through.  I purchased pastries, a jam sponge cake, and a bag of chocolate bits.  The baker's wife was pleasant, and we shared a friendly chat.
This struck us both as fair hilarious.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Daylight at last.
, but you go straight ahead, my dear.”  She turned her head to watch the countryside flash by (for we were on our way; the track down which we sped was deeply rutted, and the wheels were jarring, jolting, and we found ourselves thrown fair together often, to my discomfiture).  “Oh gracious me,” said my companion, “this silly carriage ride is shaking up my
“Wonderful,” I said, although not hearing a small word of it.
I held my breath – for now the tree was 'bearing fruit', as Holmes would say.
I moped around after he'd gone.  The guilt again, which struck me sharper than expected, but I was in uncharted water.  This was the closest thing I'd had to an “agreement”, and the path ahead was all but nigh invisible.  How should I behave?  Was I unreasonable?  Was Toby?  Things were different, I was sure, between two men.  I had never known romance, and I had never been in love.  I felt dissatisfied.
“Diabolical,” said Holmes.  Then:  “Hello there, who is that?”
“We must talk tonight,” Holmes said, quite suddenly.  “But after dinner would be best, I think.”
?  An engraved silver cup for
“It is all conjecture.  I am going to search the house.  Come with me, John, or not, but I would value your assistance.”
“Gregson thought you were a dirty little puzzle,” I told him carelessly.
A game of truth.”  He smiled, and waved his glass.
We took a moment to compose ourselves.
“Hypnotism!”
“My name is known, John.  Celebrated.”
There was no sign of Mr. Holmes out in the hallway, so I climbed the stairs to reach the fellow's sitting-room.  I heard no sound within.  I knocked.  To my great startlement, the door pulled in an inch immediately, and Sherlock Holmes's nose poked out.  “What do you want?” said he.
“Mr. Holmes,” said he, “you and your friend are unprofessional.”
, indeed.  My own queen bee.
“Although it might be fun to try,” I mused.  It was no use, however.  Holmes was sitting at his desk and opening up his leather-bound journal.  I watched him as he wrote, with left elbow leaning on the blotter, his dark head propped into his hand.  Another monograph; this one upon hair, both human and beast.  (It seemed the oddest thing to me to base a monograph upon.)
I returned behind my desk, quite irritated.  “Then you shall stand there and dehydrate,” I replied, “and that is all the same to me.”
The scream shook me out of my daydream.  It was shrill, it was strangled, and it spoke of much torment.  It caused me to spring from my seat as a jack-in-the-box.
Holmes raised himself upon one elbow.  “Well, I'm glad too.”  He touched my face.  “To think, I might have lived my whole life through without knowing this.”
“Good morning, Holmes,” I said, intensely curious, the more so now.  “How are you feeling?”
, my dear fellow.”  Holmes was examining his own card now – for of course, that's what it was.  He smiled at me.  “Oh, Watson.  It's from you.”
“There is some wardrobe space,” I said, “if you would like it.”
“Well, it all amounts to the same thing.”
“Not remotely.  I was tired.”  My head felt heavy, as if a hundred small lead weights suspended from it.  “I was reading about--”
“If you
“Good morning, sir,” I said.  “May I ask whom you are visiting?”
“I solved the case,” my friend replied.  “It was the old man's second cousin after all.”
I heard his sharp intake of breath.
“So what did Mycroft say to you?”
“What
“I was only sulking,” my friend explained, “because I wanted to be the first person to send you a card.  But that arthritic nitwit got in there before me.”
Cold hands, warm heart; no comfort when they're on your flesh and freezing you.
“Not to me, you flaming lunatic.  To Mrs. Hudson!”
“As for
Victor smiled.  “I think you are correct.  Those do sound good.  My mind has been all around and over, and I don't know quite what to think.  My poor aunt.  Tobias has been wonderful, but he has his duties back in London at the present.  I miss him so.”
“Have the beds even been made?”  (So many questions to be answered.)
“And this is why I rip your buttons, you do realise?”
“Of course he does,” my friend replied.
My yellow-backed novel had fallen to my lap with the surprise of him.
“No, Isobel, he doesn't want to speak of
“Mr. Holmes, good evening to you,” said she, with a curtsey, “and Dr. Watson, too.  I am so sorry, for I was just on my way, but I shall inform Mr. Burroughs straightaway that you are here.”
Holmes sighed loudly.  “I don't want to sleep alone,” he said.
I had a cockstand now as hard as any flagpole.
“Oh,” I said.  “I see.”  I raised my hand nervously and patted the curl.  It seemed blissfully unaware of the fuss it was causing its anxious owner.  “I am dreadfully sorry, Holmes.  I, er...”  I hesitated.  “Er, is there anything wrong with the curl?”
“To come in?”
He regarded me a while.
“Well, yes.”
I am looking for?  A naval treaty tied with a pink ribbon?”
I swooped upon him.
He came the closer to me then.  “Did you come here just to scold me on my diet?”
“I want to, very much,” I said.  I felt some hopeful stirring of arousal.
I was fast about my travel, and I wound up on his doorstep before nine o'clock.  His landlady was pleasant as she showed me up the stairs towards his rooms which, as I saw, were large and comfortable and handsomely laid out.
“In a what?  Holmes, what are you doing?”  I rattled the doorknob once again.  I looked down sadly at my feet where a thaw-puddle had appeared.  My toes were numb; my fingers number.
It took some time to find a hansom that was free.  At length, I managed to locate one, huffed myself inside and sat back against the cushions.  I was not relishing the thought of meeting Mr. Holmes again, for he unsettled me.  I pondered this predicament, and put a question to Miss Marsh on my return.
The day of the ceremony, then.  Set to commence at two o'clock, I was ready by midday.  As my “plus one”, Mr. Sherlock Holmes was looking dapper in his pinstripe suit.  He fussed around his buttonhole.  He fumbled in his pocket.  He eyed me sideways until my nerves reached fever pitch.
“And how is that?” my friend enquired.
It was just ten o'clock, and the table had been cleared from early breakfast.  The first post had come, and now I thumbed through leaflets, bills and letters.  No longer urgent telegrams, nor frantic hand-scrawled messages, inviting us to trawl the ends of London on some caper; no, those days were gone, and in their place this calm, this sweet unending peace.
“That's my direction too,” said Holmes.  “Why don't we walk along together?”  He stooped down to pet the pup.  “Good dog, good boy.”  He squinted up.  “Are you all right?”
“Good god, old man,” said he, “it seems I've talent as a writer, eh!  That didn't take you long; what did you
“Yet alas, we did not hear you.”
He shook his head, as if I must be a slow simpleton indeed.  And it is partway true, of course; I am.  As most men are, if they should be compared with that great brain – its owner now engrossed in some thick volume propped half open, making notes and sighing soft into his coffee cup.
“Well?” he snapped.
“Holmes!  Great heavens...!”
are, and well, I think we have a problem.”
And despite the heat, I felt a shiver through my spine.  My brain did its utmost to process this fresh information.  We had taken the train down to Surrey.  Somehow, this Spencer had observed our departure and pursued us, with Rusty in tow.  Taking note of arrangements he had set his own base camp, and then while he spied – on us, on the house, and presumably on Victor – the terrier Rusty had made his own sport.  What a coincidence that we should meet the pup and make a tender fuss of him.
The calming effect from the hug had quite vanished.  I was aching to know all the detail – of Dawkins, the skull, and of poor Mrs. Barker.
“We'll be having a jumble-giblets every day?” my friend enquired.
The sun was poking through the clouds as we spilled out onto the street.  We strolled a little distance, arm in arm, and it seemed that gradually my friend recovered his good humour.  I had feared his altercation might have set him in the dumps, for it seemed somewhat unlikely that Lestrade should now see fit to bestow us with anything of interest for the next month.  Yet our conversation soon turned towards the theatre, and with plans to dine at Simpson's, and soon we were both smiling with little thought to spare for taciturn Inspectors with their paper piles and chaos.
?  And why didn't Mrs. Hudson care to warn us that her friend was mad?”
And then, in a self-conscious, friendly gesture, he drew me to him in embrace.
My esteemed friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was, to all intents and purposes, at the very zenith of his powers throughout the year of 1895.  His cases were considerable, both in number and in growing reputation.  He revelled in
Holmes slipped into the room, shutting the door quietly and padding across to the bed, where he perched upon the edge, cast in dark shadows and streaks of pale light from the chinks of the curtain.
“I think Holmes likes you,” said my friend.
.  In fact, I hope some day to make my record of the two and of my friend's ingenious brain-work to bring the guilty to the bar.
“I hope he won't,” I said, and laughed.
“Not with your hand upon my arse like this,” I said.
It seemed from very far away I heard a helpless keening, felt a body writhe and wrestle, and I stopped and pulled myself back to investigate.  Holmes's eyes were pooled and wide: grey flecks of light that burned and blinked at me.  “
I took a hansom, unperturbed, and headed eastwards towards Bart's.  When I arrived, the labs were thinning out; the students had gone home, save for a cluster round one table, deep in talk.  I looked around for Holmes, but he was nowhere within sight.
His hand was cool and soft; I felt reluctant to release it, but let go of it I must, or else latch on like some wild python and alarm the both of us.
I told him then, of what transpired after we parted on the Saturday.  Holmes nodded slowly, saying nothing until I'd rumbled to a halt.  “It was a physical affair,” he said reflectively.
“A tour of healing, of meditation,” shrugged the old man.  “I have not planned it through just yet.”
“Don't forget to—” (and here Holmes made a tipping motion with his hand.)
“Well, am I an octopus?  Must I do twenty things all at once?”
“That would be suicide,” said he.  “Two sympathetic parties, yes, but then all the rest of Scotland Yard would be ablaze with gossip.  How could they keep it quiet?  Regardless of Spencer's reputation as it is now, he was once a capable police constable.  How many Yarders would choose to believe his side of the story?  I have less than no desire to find that out.”
It was the Thursday morning, early.  And despite the looming inevitability of our meeting with the odious Pike, we were enjoying a generous breakfast of kippers and eggs – which danced an internal quadrille with the fresh seafood platter from the previous night.
“I used to come here as a child,” said he, “to hide.  Mycroft's forgotten all about it, I shouldn't wonder.”  He swiped a finger through some dust.  “I liked this room.  It was so quiet.  I could sit in here and think.”
Holmes drew away.  “The other fellow begs to differ,” he replied.
He coloured.  “John, how crude.”
I shook my head.  “I swear to you, I ended it on Tuesday.  It was a... casual connection,” I added clumsily.
“Not so fast,” I said.  Manoeuvring, we switched about.  I pinned him to the bed.  I kissed his mouth; I traced my tongue across his chest and abdomen.  I licked and wetted the soft mound of pubic hair.  I took his prick into my mouth and lapped it gently, teased and nudged it to attention.  He was wailing, baying, making such a noise, that I held pause.  “You have to
But still marginally more acceptable than fellating him from under the table cloth.
“I must see Mycroft, for a minute,” he said softly.  “For if I don't, then he will hoot, and heaven knows, I don't need that.  I will see you later, Watson.”
what time it is?”
,” became two hours at the least.  The afternoon drew to a close; I washed, and changed my clothes for dinner.  I was fiddling with cufflinks when Sherlock Holmes entered the room.
The houses on Exeter Place were very fine, and number nine finer than most, with its three-storey height of red brick, large sash windows, and tended bushes to the front.  The Royal blue door was standing open as we approached and stepped up to our man in uniform.  A few words had us through and to the hallway, where we found Lestrade in waiting.  He eyed the pair of us suspiciously.  “Hello, now, what's all this?”
“I rarely play,” said he.  He winked.
“What was
I laughed.  “That's quite all right.”
... I can be.  I chose not to dwell in
“There,” said my friend, “It is done.  It was horrid.”
“Watson!  You're out of bed at last.  You're looking well.  How are you?”
, I thought repeatedly to myself.
On the table was a tray, laden with teapot, cups and saucers and an oval covered dish.  Pike made a grand gesture towards it.
“Touché, Watson,” he said, smiling.  “Come on, let's not waste any more time than we already have.  Oh, I had better introduce you, I suppose, or there'll be trouble.”
“Just this one time, Sherlock.  And I must
The fellow thanked us, shook our hands, and shuffled out.  Holmes closed the door and turned to look at me.
“Tell me anything.”
He fixed me with those steel grey eyes.  “For the same reason, I suspect, that
“I'm turning in, I think.  I am done in.  It was a
.  But, doctor, tell me what your home is like, and do you have a garden, and a maid?”
I did so.  We examined him together, before Holmes roamed around the room on his own methods, and so forgetting me entirely.  I stood to one side and watched him as he shuffled on his knees, peered through both the windows, and crouched down behind the sofas and the chairs.  It all seemed very thorough, and I found myself enjoying the odd spectacle (particularly the moments when his rump was in the air and pointing true in my direction).  I had so many probing questions, not the least of which was if the man was married or a bachelor, and if, pray god, the latter, then possibly...?
That set him panting all the more, and somehow robbed of his verbosity.
it do,” I said.  I placed it on the stand.  I curled beside him.  “You have done all this before?”
“A prude?!  I'm nothing of the sort.  But, Holmes--”
I poured a second brandy, patted his shoulder that he should not be afraid.
I leaned forward.  “You are a cock tease.”
“I suppose that you will be scolding for me to get dressed next,” he said.
Sherlock Holmes released a lungful of held air; he may have held it for the length of my sad speech, I could not tell.  He rose.  I looked at him in fear.
“What are you
He smiled.
, and loudly dismissive on the subject of
And then the house began to stir itself, and doors began to bang, and feet in multitude descended from the upper floor.  Sunday, in its finery, began to whirr and spin.
mean?  Does it mean that I have letters?”
My eyes, which had been closed in heady bliss now flickered open.  Holmes was gazing down, the sincerest expression on his face.
“Are you all right?” I asked, dismayed.
I wondered, panicked, but in awe of his noble heart.
“Yee-eees.”
I licked him clean.  He moaned the more.  I raised myself upon one arm and looked him over.  “You are quite wrecked,” I said.
I had no answer.
“Er, I, well, what?  Yes please?”
He stopped short in his tracks and slapped his hand upon the sofa back.
“You are not going to pay?” I asked him, amused.
,” Gregson continued, with a broad shrug of his shoulders.  “it's the same in our cheap digs.  It's a bit much to keep asking my Victor to squeal like a strumpet so that no-one suspects.”  A pause.  “He's very good at it, mind you.”

with it,” I said aloud.
“Whatever for?” my friend enquired, allowing me to drag him nonetheless.  We tilted down the single path, so steep and narrow, to the beach.  The man was throwing driftwood for his pet to chase.  We watched them for a minute.  I felt all of a sudden that I should rather like a dog.  I was about to voice this thought to Holmes, when the fellow turned and waved to us.
“I will think for a while,” said my friend, and he did.
“Oh, let's not talk around in circles,” he snapped, twisting around to face me.  “I cannot bear this conversation.  You want me as distraction, hmm?  Your profession makes things difficult; you have to be discreet, I understand.  It's hard to find like-souls.  But now, you think you've found one, so you latch on like a limpet.”
“--About skulls, yes, I noticed.”  Then:  “You rarely mention your brother.”
“You are so beautiful,” I told him.
“I know.”
“Yes, please.  An evening or a weekend would be best, if you don't mind.”
“Ah, it was Mr. Holmes.  I understand.”  The Inspector nodded.  “All the same, as I am sure you must be aware, it is highly irregular.”
“Keeping mum, eh, I don't blame you.  No doubt he's sweeter than a berry, you lucky rake.  Oh, I'll not mention it again, don't glare like that.  At least you're happy now.  You gave us both a heart-attack last night, when you ran off.”
My friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, was a man wholly driven by his impulse, as I have had endless cause to mention – and in great detail – these past years.  Benevolent, as the impulse never failed to be, regardless, it rained chaos on our lives to some degree until the mania receded.
“Thank you, James,” I said.  “It's very nice.”  I tipped him lightly for his trouble, closed the door, and set about a short unpack.  I chose the bed nearest the window, and set my books and things beside it.  I hung my clothes inside the wardrobe, and my toiletries upon the marble wash stand.
“You pup,” said Stamford, with his face curling to merriment.  “
“Ye-es,” said Holmes.  He sounded quite underwhelmed.  “What we
“Should I, er...?” I pointed to the stairs.
“Quite a hindrance,” I agreed.
I sipped.  “You never do.  And you
He had thrown himself back into his chair.  “Why, yes,” he said airily, “it has wrapped up very nicely.  And all thanks to Mr. Dawkins and his pendant.  Lestrade was grateful.  And so he should be.”
I sat up.
“I've no idea.  Two dozen.  More.”
“It's snowing like a baggage,” said Mrs. Oaks, her face in roil.
I put my arms around my love; I pulled him close to me.  And then, of course, he realised I knew.  I felt him shudder.
He beckoned that I join him, and I did so, curiosity in flare.  Holmes clapped my shoulder.  “Look,” said he, “just take this, and now tell me what you see.”
“And this visitor, he or she did not ring the doorbell?” Holmes enquired.
” I asked, as the home train rattled.
So we spoke of Goethe and Dickens, and then of the new restaurant – the 'Steamboat William' – in the Strand, that Gregson found much to his liking, not least the excellence of its wine list.  We made promises to all meet there one evening, their best table set for four.
And once there, to spend an idyll with all of nature.
That was how I came to learn, then, of the treachery of family and the process of elimination.  For secrets fester when they have no right nor privilege.  I asked only a few questions, and Holmes answered them as best he could.  At length we had no words to speak.  I found myself curled up upon his lap as he sat upright on our sofa.  I fell asleep, and many hours in that position, and he did not move an inch that he disturb me.
“Holmes,” I said – alarmed now.  “What?  You don't want to hear
“I have to know.  If I'm offending you, or making you uncomfortable, it's better that you tell me now.  I'll go, and we need never speak again.”
I bucked a little; it made him whine.  We clung together until eventually Holmes drew himself away.  His cheeks were flushed; he rooted through his jacket pocket for his cigarettes.  We smoked and stared, as the day darkened and the shadows filled the room.
“It is rude to burst in unannounced,” said he.
We watched as Mycroft Holmes made his departure, more sedately than on the previous occasion.
“I really don't know of the details, John.”
“You have left a huge mess, Holmes,” I said.
“I do know that,” said he.  “And I do intend to turn him down.  My letter and this meeting only serves as friendly warning.  What you choose to do about this tomfool is your concern.  I have his exclusive interest for a day or two or more, but then I fear that he may turn to other avenues.”
“Is there a note, or a letter, or anything?”
“He's been to see you?” I asked, shocked.
The street was empty.  I was bold, and I leaned forward, kissed him tenderly.  “Then goodnight, Sherlock.  I hope to see you very soon.”
They wake me again.  More questions.  More lights
“That’s not necessary.”  John begins.  “In fact, it should be the other way round, you should not be staying here alone.”
“Yes, Metal pipe.”  I say in a thick voice.
“John, you should have seen them.  Perfect specimens.  Five of them.  Bright yellow bands, perfectly marked.”
“Course not.”  She says, clearly unconvinced, heading for the door.  “Eat that and I’ll bring you some scones for afternoon tea.”
The best years are the ones after I talk John into selling his practice.  Well, he advertised it, and I bought it.  Not that he knew that at the time.  I was a good choice, it provides us a modest income and if he ever grows tired of being my blogger, he can go back to it.
I didn’t have time to appreciate the moment for too long though.  Doctor Pawson enters again with a smiling hello to each of us.
I hear footsteps on the stairs.  Greg couldn’t have got here that quickly so it must be the ambulance crew.  I call out loudly to let them know where we are.
“It is next week.  You still have time.  Please don't buy her another coal scuttle,” I added.
“So, then,” Holmes said, at last.  “The Hon. Cole Ramsey.”
At the very least, he ceased his fitful jitter and by and by our conversation turned to the gossip of the day and comment on the freshest casework.  Our roast beef dinner was enjoyed, and later, after the apple tart and port, we read together by the barren hearth as the evening shadows spread.  My glance often stretched across to Holmes, for it being the first day back from the great wherever, I still retained some small concern for his well-being.  Content enough, he seemed to me, engrossed as he was in a serious leather-bound.  (The previous time, it was
I waved a hand above my head.  “I would enjoy a tour,” I said, all of my machinations whirring.
Watson, madam,” I said, nodding, with a smile.  “And I suppose we might?  I really could not tell you?”
He smiled, still tentative.  He moved his chair a fraction closer.
After an interval, the meal was on the table and we set to with alacrity, for we had eaten very little since the morning.  The pie was good, homemade and hearty, and with some left for the next day's lunch, our housekeeper informed us.
“As it turned out, the lady had recently met and fallen to talking with a particular gentleman who promoted himself as some form of a miracle 'healer'.  So persuasive was he, and so convinced was Mrs. Barker by his spiel, that she asked him for his assistance with the 'mysterious pain' in her back that her doctors had not found the root cause of.  She had booked a series of appointments with this gentleman; the last of which was on the day of the murder.”
But good things come to those who wait.  At close of day, I filed the notes on my last patient, and I strode out to the waiting-room to find Miss Marsh and bid her a good night.
“Very much, I am afraid.”
Pike turned to me.  For the most part of our meeting he had managed to ignore me very well.
“The weather makes you impossible,” I told him fondly.
I followed the lad up a long curving flight of stairs to the first floor, and along a corridor to a far room which I was introduced inside.  My bags were placed inside the door.  I looked around.  A pleasant room, in shades of green, twin-bedded, richly furnished, with the windows looking out to the rear gardens, which stretched out admirably far.
Holmes stared.  “Why not?” I saw his fingers grip the fabric of his chair-arm, twist it fretfully.  “You'll want to move out some day, after all.”
“Holmes, I have a terrible feeling that--”
“I have a great many bad habits,” he continued, sucking now on a malodorous clay pipe stuffed full with shag, “and a few lesser, better ones.”  He smirked.  “I'll leave it up to you to ascertain which ones are which.”
“Thank you, Watson.  You are perfectly mad, but very kind and it is perfect.”
We set off at a slow pace, keeping well hidden by the jostle of pedestrians and street carts.  Spencer's route was not meandering, but headed straight for the lower and popular commercial quarter.
Jacob Stone drew the red curtain, unlocked a door and led us through to a small room.  A round table in the centre, laid with lace cloth and, on the top of it, a lustrous, large red jasper skull.  It seemed to reflect all of the light within the room, and the expression on its face – if I could even call it that – was cheerful and benign.
elude you.  You must speak with her, find out her name and where she lives and what she wants here.  Do I make myself clear?  Memorise her features and her voice and anything strange at all that strikes you.  Can you do that for me?  Thank you.  I rather hope that we might find her before you do.  But it is no good for us to sit here as we are in one great huddle.”
After a few further minutes, the gathering heat from the stone bid us rise and move on.  We followed the pathways and paused by the blossoms that most caught our eye.  Small birds in the treetops sang down to us, joyful.
my signet ring.  Fellows these days, Watson, you've no idea.  And what of you?”
“But this is terrible!” I said, in consternation.  “We are at Pike's mercy?”
“I did not say that,” my friend replied.  “I merely said that I would appreciate an intrigue.”  He tapped at his forehead.  “For this.”
“Spencer was in Surrey, then,” I hissed – for I must speak now or burst a blood vessel in angry indignation.  “And little Rusty
We stood at the gate, peering through at the garden.
I leaned and placed my mouth against his ear.
“Changed my mind?” His face was puzzled.  “Why, whatever do you mean?”
“You will be remembered as a genius,” I said cautiously.
“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” said Holmes, his head cocked in a whimsy.
Holmes did not reply.  He fixed the fellow with a grey, metallic stare.  Pike bore it bravely for half a minute until the second he could not.
I clasped my friend's hand in my own, and squeezed it tightly.
“He was the young man responsible for those charming typed notes, back in the day when I still thought of Gregson as both a bounder and a fool.”
“She is in the kitchen,” Lestrade replied.  “I suppose you wish to speak with her?  Follow me, then.”
I patted his knee.  “I'm sure it won't come to that.  Just write the note, please, at least.  I assume that your wallet is a fly-trap, as usual?  Well, I thought so.  The note, then.  The sooner the better.”
“Yes, William Eldritch,” said my friend.  “Now, I realise that it's a capital mistake to theorise in advance of the facts, but it's really too great a coincidence: this man gets out of prison, and more than likely he harbours a grudge. A few days later, here we are with these two phials that spell the onset of his surname.”  Holmes spread his hands.  “Well, it's a theory, if a poor one.  What do you say to it?”
“Thank you so much for inviting me,” I said.
“He didn't seem so.”
We sat by the hearth with cigars and a small tot of port.
“Not quite.”  A pause.  “I see you've come to an agreement.”
“No,” I said.  “Just, no.
than a little.  What have you
“What does the man have to say, then?”
We burst out into mirth, a little hysterical for our own private reasons.
, and what was
“All this fresh air,” I said, “is making you a harlot.”  I touched his hand.  “I'm not complaining in the least.”
“But I feel that I should.  I love you more than I could possibly admit.  I--”
“With Mrs. Hudson.  The silly old trout.”
“Gregson,” I said, haltingly, “I am sorry for intruding.  I thought you were alone.”  I stopped.  The stranger stood before me was now eyeing me askance.
“You mustn't go to the barber,” said Holmes with finality.  “You must grow your hair.  I want to see what happens next.”
The canyon between the almost and the actual is vast.  My heart yearned, daily, foolishly, and he all the time oblivious – for what use had he for tenderness, or – god forbid it – love?
“Well, yes.  Apart from university, and the less that's said of
I heard his breathing stutter, quicken; regulate.
He was quiet a moment longer.  “Yes, perhaps.”
“I'll see you later, then?”
“I began my business there, and was content.”  He stopped again, and looked at me.
We lay for several minutes, joined and aching, then to softening.
“Watson, I would not become over-excited,” said Holmes, stooping closer to look all the same.  “This is, after all, an antiques shop.  Items are put up for sale and then sold.  Such a knife, had it been used, given its age would have left a debris in the wounds that Scotland Yard could not have missed.”
“You try the chests,” said Holmes.  His hand smoothed back his hair.  “I'll take the boxes.”
He exhaled; his points retracted, and he turned his head to contemplate the interfering fellow sat beside him.  “I don't know,” he said.  “But Watson, there are two things you must do for me.”
“Gregson, what was that?  You spoke of Spencer?”
“I was looking to see where you were,” I said, almost totally flustered by now.
“What the hell is going on?” I hissed.  “I don't understand it.”
“We should have played for money,” Holmes remarked.  “I'd be a rich man by this point.”
Our man was still in sight.  He ducked down an alley and whistled shrilly for his dog to keep the pace.
“Gregson,” said my friend, “do sit down and cool your ardour.  I shall tell you both as much as I am able.”
Holmes looked sharply back towards me.  “That is my bedroom,” he said softly.
Victor placed a hand upon the shoulder of his cousin.
Holmes's bedroom was a barren land, with the minimum of furniture and precious little in the way of a homely touch.  The room was chill; the fire unlit.  He sat upon the narrow bed and eyed me with suspicion.
“Oh!  I see.  That's very interesting.”
“You are magnificent,” I said.
,” he said, directing a stern look at me.
“You're still in love,” I said.
“Yes,” said he, “I discovered that
“No,” said Mrs. Oaks.  She stamped her boots upon the mat.  “There'll be snow tomorrow.”  She sounded mournful.  “That rain's turnin' to hail.”
“Mmmmn.”  I blinked.  “Good gracious.  You know, if you left me alone, I just might.”
I drew up into his lap then, and I held his face and kissed him 'til he had to beg for air.
My eye was fixed upon the... something... that was dangling from the ceiling in the centre of the room.
“I know,” I said.  “You are not at fault.”
“So we were all led to believe.  Hush now, I am reading.”

“There now, I've saved you ringing on the bell,” said she.  “I'm feeling quite myself again today, I hardly think you need have visited.”
“What are you doing?” he enquired.
“You have your bees.  I'd like a dog,” I said, folding the letter back into its envelope.
“Being what, exactly?”  I wished that my friend might spit it out, as it was almost time for lunch.
him.  And I never did, you know.”
And gradually, my guilty feelings – and the other – relaxed and lessened, and my thoughts turned to tomorrow, optimistic for results.
He wrestled free.
I struck a match and lit two cigarettes, and we smoked a little while.  And the world slowed down its tilt-a-whirl, and the rain asked for permission to make itself heard once again.
“You say that now!”
NEW LETTER RECEIVED ADDRESSED TO MY AUNT STOP I BEG YOU TO COME HERE TODAY STOP TOBIAS WILL BE CATCHING THE TWELVE THIRTY TRAIN STOP VB
“It's a pleasure, and he's no bother.  He's an angel, aren't you, Max?  Oh, you doctors, with your working hours, and all those overnights!  You must be worth your weight in gold.”
is why I'm sitting here, amazed, amused, what have you.”  Adams lit a cigarette, and sucked it, chuckling away.  “I fell in love, you know, and told him.  He replied in the same vein, and then confessed to his great secret.”
My mouth was parched.  I poured a glass of water from the carafe beside the bed, and sipped it slowly.  Holmes was watching me the while.  “Did you sleep well?”
He shook his head then, flapped his hands, as indication that the subject should be better kept for later.  He swept out to the hall and picked up our bags – for the maid had departed – and beckoned us on to and up the stairs.
The young man became serious then for a moment.  He reached over, picked up a letter and held it out towards my friend.
“Then what are you saying?  That nobody scaled the drainpipe at all?  That they held a spare key to the study, and crept out through the door without the housekeeper hearing?  But what of the skull?  What does Dawkins say now?”
“Oh, little,” said he, “except that he has risen again, and is in contact with Pike, wanting cash for great scandal.
Holmes quickened his pace, the sandy grit rising in sharp huffs at his boots.  I broke into a trot to draw up level with his peeve.
My friend had pulled me, dazed, from our new friend and up the path away to grass and field and quiet.    I wrenched myself free of his grip.  “Will you
“Thank you for such a lovely evening,” I said shyly.
“Indecency?”  I shook my head.  “Whatever did you do?”
look very much like suicide.”
“Yes.”  He sounded defeated.  “But, John--”
The morning came.  We proclaimed silently, and looked out at the street, where passers-by walked on, oblivious, and Mrs. Hudson clattered saucepans on the lower floor, oblivious.
Confused, I let the subject drop.  We spoke of books instead, and as the evening drew the darker I found myself with a small pile that sat beside me, with more yet added as my friend plucked volumes down from his great shelves.  “You
“Where is the housekeeper?” he enquired.
All we could do then was wait.  It was unlikely we would hear anything before the evening or the next morning.  A simple meal of cold meat, bread and pickles had been laid out upon the dining table.  We sat and piled our plates and poured cold beer from a carafe. Our talk remained subdued, each of us lost in our own thoughts.  I was barely listening when Gregson, tongue broadly loosened by the beer, commenced to spread gossip of the Yard.  At the first mention of '...
(And I confess, that by this point I had taken myself in firmer grasp and was drawing up and down, delighted beyond all measure at my friend's impromptu tease.)
.”  He sat back.  “There we are.”
There was a silence while Sherlock Holmes digested this scrap of information.
“Yes, yes.”  His smile faded in disappointment.  His fingers twiddled the handsome quartz point on the gold chain around his neck.  “You do not wish to make a purchase?  Only to ask me my name?”
“Oh, I see.”
“We are going to be
“I would rather you did not.  I loathe the name.”  He smiled.  “Unless you
“Just making the place pretty, John,” said he, with a grand gesture.  He came up to me.  “Your room is ready.  You'll have everything you need in there.  Ho ho!”  He rubbed his hands.  “We'll soon have everything like clockwork, just you see.”
“Yes.”
We comforted him as best we could.  And several hours later, with more ales imbibed than might be considered wholly sober, we wended homeward with the night air soft and sweet.  The countryside, so peaceful – at least upon the surface.  I wondered what might transpire upon the morrow.
I leaned back in my chair and eyed the fellow in amusement.  “I was sincere,” I said.  “So you, er, observe things in that way, and you solve crimes?”
“If you want to take things slowly,” I said sincerely, “then we will.”
.  Mycroft is seven years my elder.  He is the bane of my existence.”
“You like a challenge,” said my friend.  “You always have.  Now pass that bottle, and we'll smoke a few cigars, and talk of Dickens for a while.”
“And how did she react?” my friend asked very gently.
He nodded, stricken.
It seemed as an eternity.  I confess I fell asleep, and awoke some one hour, two hours later, with the room now bathed in gloom, the merest sliver of a lamp light shining through from Holmes's room.  I heaved myself up from my chair and set to making light within the sitting-room.
The next morning brought the first of them: a parcel, small, and square, wrapped in brown paper, tied with twine.  Stamped with a local postmark, our address in high block capitals, and 'Strictly Private, for the attention of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Esq.'
I hailed a hansom and sat back inside the cab, in thoughtful mood.  It was a pleasant day, despite persistent drizzle; warm, at least.  We were held up for several minutes by an accident involving two large grocers' carts; the road had to be cleared, and we were on our way again.  At length we came to stop; the driver tapped upon the roof, and I stepped out and paid my fare.  The street that I was standing on was fairly well-to-do.  I looked around and found my bearings, and as the hansom clattered off I walked up to the door of 221B Baker Street.  I rang the bell.  I waited patiently.  There was some turbulence within; I heard the thud of boots upon the stair, and then a key turned in the lock, and the door pulled slowly inwards to reveal a stern-faced gentleman.
“You were content?”
His face creased up in agony.  “No.”
Yes, there they were indeed, the three – two gentlemen and a lady – and were now standing in a huddle close to the heavy-curtained wall.  They paid us little mind, lost in their own engrossing mardle.
“Good evening, Watson,” said he, with a bow.  “Do come in.”  He stepped aside.
“Oh,” said she, “well, that's me done for.”  And she cackled like a raven.  “No, no, my sirs, I'm all in jest.  Do go on, Mr. Holmes.”
“Then perhaps it is likely he has a sounder knowledge of London, and therefore is more familiar with his escape routes than, er...?”
We grinned in memory.
I hadn't expected that.
I fumbled with the key, opened the door, and there was Sherlock Holmes.  I stared at him.  It seemed to irritate him.  “Let me in,” he said again.  His tone was cold.  I stood back slowly, watched him enter and look around with some distaste.  “This is a dump.”
Come Valentines Day, Sherlock grew anxious in each of his classes. What if his admirer decided to stop giving him little compliments? What if he transferred schools?
Sherlocks eyes went cold. “My parents are the exception, and they were never around to begin with.”
Sally fell silent and the rest of the room started murmuring.
John looked out to the tall green cornstalks, brightly-painted red barn, and fresh flower beds planted outside the house, feeling uncertain that there is no one living here.
“I’m sorry.”
“Yes, sir.” John spoke with sincerity.
"Sherlock-"
The rest of lunch was eaten in silence. Sherlock didn't finish his plate.
John was a whirlwind of emotions after Sherlocks death, he was not seeing things clearly. The letters from Moriarty only managed to confuse and anger him more, and they never deviated from one centered viewpoint: he and Sherlock were boyfriends.
And despite the sickness of the photos, John kept them. He looked at them every night before he went to sleep, either with tears burning his eyes or a grin spread across his face.
Sherlock kept his focus in front of him. “But a man as remarkable as you should have an evenly remarkable man by his side.”
Hmm, maybe I should walk out in the open and let someone recognize me; it will give me another chance to practice such acts. And besides, keeping hidden is becoming boring again. I need to
“Of course. An unfamiliar home, with an unfamiliar sound coming from down the hall. That is bound to wake anyone up with a history of PTSD.”
“They might be in the barn.” Sherlock was already walking in said direction before he finished the sentence.
I leaned forward, mimicking Lestrades position. "And you and I know him better than anyone. He wouldn't do this unless he knows something we don't."
Per usual, they arrive and greet Angelo with a smile, he seats them at the available table by the window and scurries off for the candle. He doesn’t even say he is going to retrieve it anymore, he just does—but John still gives hopeless attempts at explaining they are not a couple.
"I don't care." I called, not
“No, you're better than that- better than them.” John gestured to the school. “Don't you dare ever let anyone tell you otherwise.” John smiled sadly and turned and left, leaving a confused and curious Sherlock on the schools sidewalk.
Sherlock scoffed. “If that is what you would like to believe, John.”
Nice try, Watson.
When it came to Moriarty, nothing was more maddening. John was about ready to explode (pun not intended thank you very much) with how irritating things came to be. It is one thing to be strapped to a bomb, and another to force your friend to ‘kill’ himself.
"Away from here," I said and kept walking.
. Apparently not.
"Well, I couldn't let my brother be alone on such a big day now could I?" I turned around and faced my eldest sibling. He is leaning on his drawn sword, as usual, and clearly has gained weight.
The four of them went inside, Harry and Clara holding hands as they walked down the hall to the kitchen. John stopped and removed his jacket, Sherlock following his lead, and placed the two on the coat rack.
Siger spoke in a low voice. Beside him, John could feel Sherlock tense up. “And it’s about time we met your mate.” Suddenly all eyes are glued on John, and he actually feels like he could sink into the high-back of this ridiculously large chair. Instead, he looks Siger dead in the eye and sits up tall. He was a soldier for god sakes, he will not stand down to a stranger with glossy hair and an expensive suit!
I sneak a look at him to see the unsure expression on his face.
Sherlock was feeling a bit like his sixth grade self again when he considered the thought of his admirer moving. Though he is starting to think it is unlikely. He has been consistent for all these years he doubts anything will change now.
“Nice of you to join us for once, William.”
John enjoyed his time in the military. He met many people that he grew close to and saved many lives in the process. He quickly made his way up the ladder and became a Captain, one of the most respected and trustworthy. It was all great, but that was before he started to witness his best friends get shot down right beside him.
“Don’t feel sorry for me, John. It was for the better.” Sherlock said, his eyes stayed blank. John wasn't convinced. Not just because of the look he is giving him, and the slight weariness in his voice, but because of the way Sherlock had actually
“And misjudged by you.” Eugene cuts in. “That’s why the case took so long to close, you were all looking at it wrong.”
Halfway through the night, Sherlock three beers in, and John was explaining his most gruesome experience in his army days, was when things took a turn for the worst.
“Mycroft.” Violet begins. “Is this true?”
When John reached the hospital a few hours later, he immediately went to the desk to inquire about his friend.
“Incompetent?” Sherlock looked offended.
I paused. Intelligent indeed. "What have you heard?"
John was baffled. He never thought Mycroft could be talked into anything he doesn't want to do.
“Then why don't you two talk? I’m sure there is something more to talk about with someone you know as opposed to someone you don’t.”
to him the night after their dinner at the Manor.
Sherlock looked up. “Yes, John. I’ve always known. Do you take me for a fool?”
"Take a
The light outside is beginning to fade when John hears a bang coming from the barn. He looks over and sees three men, two he does not recognize, the other is Sherlock. And Sherlock is running into the cornfield and away from the men with knives.
"Angelo was the prime suspect in a murder, and while I couldn't exactly show my face in England, I had to send some anonymous evidence to prove that Angelo was in a different part of town housebreaking."
"Understandable," I say.
, I tell myself,
Sherlock shook his head. “Tedious.” He grumbled.
“John.” Sherlock spoke gently and looked down at John. John stared up at him angrily, he froze entirely when he felt Sherlocks hand interlock with his. “She already knows, there is no point in hiding it now.”
I glanced down the dock and found no one on shore, and almost smirked. This is easy... Though that is the problem.
John sighed, the poor sod must be going crazy trying to deduce him. Yet there is nothing to deduce with Johns words, they mean exactly what they sound like. Except Sherlock needs it spelt out for him. John smiled, this was one of the reasons why he felt strongly for Sherlock—even when he is a genius, he doesn't always get things right away. It makes Johns heart thud heavily in his chest. His genius, his uncertain man, his annoying git, his Sherlock.
He did, and naturally, I helped him escape from a year in jail.
the Freak.”
"And you believe them enough to come down here and think they will hold leverage over me."
“So what happened here? Did you decide to delete the list and then pull it from your mental trash bin just now to appease me?” John crossed his arms over his chest and continued to glare at the man before him.
“Here.” Said the cabbie. John paid as Sherlock slowly got out and went to the gate. When John approached, Sherlock was typing something into the metal keypad built into the stone wall next to the artfully designed iron gates.
"Please step off the ship." The man, Stamford, spoke. He is head of the Royal Navy here and caught me the last time. It was not one of my proudest moments considering the guy is larger than Mycroft and he was clever enough to cut me off on a rooftop and tackle me from the roof to the ground, the only thing breaking our fall was a pile of barrels. Before I had the chance to react, I felt the iron manacles around my wrists.
“Hello, I’m Doctor Harrison.” He shook Johns hand. “I’ve been informed you are Mr. Holmes’ spouse?”
As their time together grew, so did their feelings. Johns crush turned into something more, something he couldn't quite explain. His stomach trembled and his breathing picked up speed when he knew he was going to see Sherlock. Johns knees felt weak when he finally saw the pale man before him, all angles and lines, all black, blue and white. He started to worry about what he wore everyday, how he smelt, if his hair looked just right.
“Hello, Harry.” John sighed.
“YES!” Harry exclaimed, giggling. “How’s Saturday night? Clara found this great restaurant just in the heart of the city. Dress nicely, we will be here at seven.” Harry ran down the stairs but stopped halfway. “Maybe you shouldn’t ignore my calls so often John, then I wouldn’t have to show up so abruptly. Though I’m glad I did, otherwise I wouldn’t have met your boyfriend.” And then she was gone.
John thought a moment and then nodded. If Sherlock doesn't want to answer, John knows he won’t, and John is far too tired to argue.
Harry sighed and forked a piece of chicken forcefully.
“Oh my, what has happened here?” Mrs. Hudson was suddenly beside John, looking at Sherlock accusingly. “Sherlock you better get this mess cleaned up, and I had better not find any stains or it will be placed on your rent.” She tisked at him in warning.
"You've lost it." He threw back, so it doesn't bother him this time. Something must've happened to boost his confidence level.
John could hear Violet sigh when Eugene finished speaking, and Sherlock is once again tense next to him. It doesn't take a Holmes to read the tension between Sherlock and his family.
John turned back to a sleeping Sherlock. He could hear the incessant beeping of his heart on the monitor. John has never felt such a relief. He sat down next to his friend, placing a hand on his wrist with a sigh.
“Do you see a fat man anywhere?” Sherlock asks casually from underneath the nearest tree, while John stood a few feet away under the suns rays.
“He’s stable. The Doctor thinks he will be just fine.” She said, with a gentle smile.
No definitely not.
Sheryl… Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Really John, it is nothing. I threw the first punch.”
“How could you even know about those?”
"Alright." I agreed without further thought. Besides, this could be rather fun. Better than sitting in this cell awaiting a typical death.
"I am not worried,
John blinks at her. The entire room is silent. “He’s not a psychopath.” John managed to blurt out. “And we’re not together.”
“Very good John, you’re catching up.” Sherlock praised him in a patronizing tone. “Number seven is my parents,” Sherlocks face contorted at his mention of it. “you felt offended and hurt when my parents started acting like the homophobes they are. Yet you wonder why I try to avoid them.” He added the last part as an after thought.
?" If Lestrade was drinking something he would have choked on it. "And you brought him
John frowns and looks out at the sea. Physically he feels all that I do, the spray of the ocean already dampening their clothes, the smell of seaweed and soon to be rainfall, the cool wind ruffling our hair and clothing.
"To get us out of here," he stated stubbornly. Ah, so he is going to fake trusting me for awhile for his own sanity.
Sherlock is staring intently at the grass below him, John received the side profile of his face and a diagonal of his body. If John were an artist, he would be tempted to draw Sherlock like this. It is a sight to see with the different shapes and angles and the odd contentment that filled the air.
“John have you met my cousins and uncle?” Sherlock cuts in urgently and sits up straight to point to the three people across from them, who were watching the exchange with amusement. “Over there is my cousin Earnest and that’s her twin brother Eugene.” Sherlock points from left to right. “And this is my Uncle Frederick.”
“Shut up.” John said quietly but most definitely audibly. All eyes turned to the jock sitting next to the ‘Freak’. John suddenly found his confidence. “Honestly, what makes you think you’re so much better than him?”
Sherlock made a noise that sounded like a restrained growl. “Quit dancing around the facts. You were in the military, of course you weren’t too shocked to react.”
category.
But that is all beside the point, because none of it matters now. Sherlock is back, and any strange thoughts and feelings John may have had while his friend was away can be justified as mourning. Everyones judgement is impaired once someone dies.
“Where are we going?” Sherlock asked as they stood on the curb.
"You, you and you. On the ship, make ready to sail." I pointed to the three smallest and nearest crewmen with my gun and they ran for the ship, doing as they are told.
We're a good distance away that Mycroft has to yell his next words. "You're not going to ask about my prisoners?"
John reaches for the gun, aims and shoots before the man even knew what was happening. He hit the ground in pain. John shot his leg, just in the right spot to impair the use of it. John ran over, took the knife, and went with lightning speed into the corn where he saw Sherlock and his attacker disappear.
"Why should I help you?" I asked in response.
Sherlock has worked with John in class, he has to admit that he really isn't as dumb as the rest of their classmates. He can keep up, mostly, with Sherlock. He frowned. Why hasn't he tried talking to John before? Nothing has ever been spoken between them but Chemistry problems.
It is a beautiful day out for London, the clouds are breaking up and the sun is peaking through onto the streets. Despite the cold winter air, the sun is warm when it shines on John.
“Greg-”
over the two of them.
Sure, John expected things like that to happen, after all it was
"You're Sherlock Holmes?" The man questioned urgently.
John looked up and glared at Greg before looking over at Sherlock who had four empty beer glasses in front of him and was leaning heavily against the wall of the booth. His body and features seemingly lost, though his eyes seemed to be at attention to his surroundings.
“I was sticking up for your arrogant, incompetent ass.” John responded harshly.
Sherlock let go of Johns hand and smirked. “I like her.” He said. “A bit manic, but rather entertaining.”
I tie the helm in place and descend to the deck with a tight grip on the rail. It wouldn't do for my crew to see their captain flailing about like he can't handle the sea.
“Oh god,” John said and dropped his head to the bed. His almost headache is now a full-on headache.
Jealous.
“John.” She wiped her hands on one of the flannel rags and walked over to give her son a hug and kiss on the cheek. “Oh I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.” She placed her hands on his arms and looked him over fondly.
“So seeing me was more important than hitting on the nurse an hour ago?”
“Don’t bother, John. We are wasting precious time standing here while he is probably finishing his donut down the street.” Sherlock huffed, crossing his arms and pursing his lips, effectively forming his famous sulk.
And that is when Sherlock Holmes decided that Valentines Day is by far the most tormenting holiday in existence. Hell, why is it even considered such? There is nothing special about the day, no one gets the day off. Really it is a day for adults to ship their children away with a nanny so they can go eat candy and buy each other pink items.
Sherlock gave him the
“You would have already. And besides, you enjoy it.” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly.
John sighed and listened as Mrs. Hudson went back into the kitchen. He needs to calm himself down, but his damn leg—and that comment about being with Sherlock.
It was silent for a moment, but something suddenly dawned on John.“You said you knew it would wake me, why did you want me awake?”
“Could you really not tell that the woman looked
“What the hell was that? Who is he talking about?” John started in on Sherlock who only sighed in annoyance. Whoever it is, it is clear to John that Sherlock wants no part of it.
“It was an act for the case, John. It was quite clear you were jealous of the attention she received from me.”
And John is suddenly convinced that Sheryl is the female version of Sherlock.
The room is small, and he first saw Mycroft on his phone. He glanced up briefly and smirked. “I figured you would find your way up.” With that, he got up and walked past John to leave.
"None of your business," I snap. John doesn't physically react, but I can tell he is surprised by my sharp response.
"Follow my lead," I said again and swiftly took John by his fidgeting arm and guided him off the ship none too gently.
"Just—you, a blacksmith."
“Shut up.” Sherlock ordered.
“O-oh,” the nurse stammered. “Of course, my apologies.” She said and went about checking his vitals.
John seems to think on his words before asking them, but I know exactly what he is going to ask before he does. He's only been asking since we arrived.
force all the students to give Valentines to each other…
"Royal Navy."
“John, my boy!” He exclaimed and came up to him for a body crushing hug. John had to try very hard not to spill all his lemonade on the two of them.
“Oh?” John states. He can’t help but feel how incredibly awkward this entire table is, and he fears it is only going to get worse.
“Oh yes!” Harry answered before John could, rushing up behind the two of them. “I’m sure Sherlock treats him all
Sherlock dreaded the upcoming fourteenth of February, the day he will be forced into interaction and affection.
Day thirty-one:
“Why?”
“You complete asshole.” John growled through gritted teeth.
"Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock. Look at where you ended up because of it." And suddenly Mycrofts footsteps faded away.
Sherlock sat still and stared at John, slowly beginning to relax a bit. Neither of them moved until they were stopped in front of a gate.
“He’s been having trouble admitting it aloud.” Sherlock started, poking at his untouched food. John looked at him in confusion.
John frowned.
“No.” John answered, forcing back an eye roll. He is use to Sherlock calling Mycroft fat, when he certainly isn’t, but John is still amused and annoyed by Sherlocks comments.
“Sherlock, you call my sister right now and tell her that we are not together and that it was a joke. Tell her we can’t go out on Saturday and apologize for being a complete git.”
"I'm going after my brother."
“Forget I asked, it’s obvious.” Sherlock brushed him off with a wave of his hand, and relaxed back into his pillows.
Sherlock went home and placed the note with all the other ones he has kept over the years. Sherlock looked at the handwriting, it has changed over time since they were young, it went from sloppy and unsure to clear and confident, but definitely from the same person.
Neither of them saw Mrs. Hudson smile knowingly as they ran out together.
The chairs are close enough to one another that John is able to reach under and squeeze Sherlocks knee undetected, for reassurance. Sherlock reacts by grabbing Johns hand tightly and holding it, refusing to let go.
The first letter was simple:
“How could I-”
. Not sure if he is speaking to Sherlock or himself.
“Yes.” Sherlock confirmed.
John turned his head on the mattress to look at him. “Yes, they have a habit of befriending everyone they come in contact to.”
I was broken from my trance when the sound of something snapping pulled me back to the ship. A rope snapped near the mass and I groaned. I knew those idiots would tamper with something.
No, ponder on it later. I need to leave this awful city.
“Don't thank me, sweetheart, we’re practically family!” She exclaimed.
Angelo laughs and then looks over my shoulder again, obviously curious. "Your usual table, then, for you and your date?"
I know where to go immediately like it's an autonomic response. I walk the familiar pathways up to the pub near the town center.
Mycroft stood in between the kitchen and living space to have both of their attention, though he received no acknowledgement from either.
Curiosity. That became the strongest feature in his eyes. He may know all about my past in some way or another, which is also quite interesting and I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious myself. His curiosity is going to get the better of him. I know this before he is inserting the key and unlocking the door.
It was impressive to say the least. John is truly amazed that someone could be so smart, he wondered how this kid is capable of doing such things and if John could ever live up to such a clever mind.
John didn't respond, but he settled for a head nod and went upstairs to his room. It was a strange night, and John felt the only way to fix this awkward feeling is sleep.
He pulled his hand free from his mothers grasp and slammed it back onto the tabletop, making the silverware and glasses vibrate loudly.
“Harry!” Clara and John scolded at once. Their father laughed just as Sherlock came bounding out the back door and down the steps of the porch.
“What?” John says and looks at Sherlock who only stares and observes Mycrofts reaction. John follows his gaze, and very slowly does he begin to understand. “You and Greg?”
I didn't respond. Why such a stupid question?
