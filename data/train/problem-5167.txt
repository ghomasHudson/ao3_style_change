As if that was even a choice.
It was the rest that had him nervous. The charity balls, the business dinners. What the hell was he going to talk about with the kind of people Castiel usually spent his time with? And how long until the novelty of dating a pretty, blue-collared mechanic wore off and Cas realized he’d manipulated them both into a relationship he only thought he wanted because he was temporarily bored of his own ilk?
“Well, they're home now, and we’re naked, so move your fine ass inside.”
“Not sure, but Cas’ said-”
Soon Sam and Charlie joined Castiel at the table when Dean joined the rest of his band on stage. Ellen took over for Jo at the bar, and she made her way to the table as well, smiling shyly at Charlie before punching Castiel in the arm. That was interesting. Castiel wondered what Dean thought of that potential pairing.
“Just tell me what’s going on.”
“That is a lot of food, Dean,” Castiel said ominously but Dean only bit into a sausage and sighed in satisfaction.
“Is this weird?” Jimmy spoke up suddenly and Dean met his gaze to find the man studying Dean with a searching expression.
“Shouldn’t we call the police?” Dean countered, then nearly laughed aloud as he reminded himself that he was tied to a chair.
“He told me I was a fool to let myself be fucked by someone who didn’t really love me, that I deserved a real man who wouldn’t sneak around behind my back and how Michael was sure that he could take care of me far better than you ever could. That’s about as far as he got before you decked him.”
Castiel had to admit; it took him a moment. Then his eyes widened.
Dean grinned, “You don’t see enough of this annoying mug at home, huh?”
“On account of how sexual they were,” Frank deadpanned, and Dean jolted when Castiel coughed, violently, spraying beer out of his mouth and nose.
. Dean didn't care how much of a workaholic he was, cheating was something that he would never put up with. And so what if he wanted to work in a place that showcased his lobster risotto and garlic butter steak with scalloped potatoes instead of jalapeno poppers?
“I meant what I said, though, Dean. I am sorry I caused such a scene,” Castiel took a sip of his wine and fiddled with his cup. “I don’t abide people who are so cavalier with other people’s feelings,” Cas quirked a grin. “Yours, in particular.
“I am pansexual.”
The pout in Dean's voice did much to buoy Cas' spirits; if Dean was feeling well enough to bitch about clothing, then he probably wasn't internally freaking out the way Cas had been.
“Welcome to Morningstar Manor,” the woman said warmly, her Scottish lilt almost musical. “I’m Rowena MacLeod. I’m so pleased you could come out here.”
“That’s because I have like, six different candles burning.”
“My Grandparents were fascinated by angels and eternity,” Castiel said, simply. Dean stared at him, clearly waiting for him to elaborate.
“Dean, I-” Castiel glanced in the rearview at Sam.
“I’m sorry,” he managed, only to be shushed as Castiel whispered soothing words in his ear.
Castiel's mouth kicked up in a half-smile. He wasn't sure what he'd said that had warranted such a reaction, but he promised to stay the same anyway.
Castiel threw his jeans on top of Dean’s in the oversized chair next to the bed and stood naked and unashamed. Dean’s eyes raked over him, and Castiel looked his fill as well, drinking in the gorgeous sight of bowed legs and freckled skin. Cas thought maybe it would feel weird to stand together like this, so vulnerable and bare, but instead if felt so perfectly right. Like this was where they were always meant to be.
, maybe she’s just dumb and doesn’t think you're married?” Benny offered next to him, having stolen Dean’s chair since he was busy grilling.
Fourth of July came and went, and it was probably the most fun Emmanuel could ever remember having on the holiday. That morning Dean had a skype conversation with his mother for about three minutes before she had lost internet. They were somewhere on the Medetaranian and internet on the open sea was unreliable at best. Dean had tried to tell her about his new roommate, but never got a chance before the call cut off.
“Dean, fuck,
to deal with the onslaught of questions that Castiel knew were coming his way.  So, instead of fighting his boyfriend, he just nodded.
“I’m still deciding,” Emmanuel said pensively, then smiled softly at Dean’s amused expression. “But for today, let’s go with… E.J.”
Alistair allowed them to get out and stretch, taking the keys from Dean's hands before they left the car. Dean and Jack awkwardly turned their back on each other so they could pee, pain in his bladder overcoming any embarrassment.
“His prints should be on file,” Gabriel’s voice sounded thready as he spoke up from the back of the room. Though he spoke to Jody, his eyes were only for Cas. “Aunt Becky, she uh-,” Gabriel paused, swiping a hand down his mouth as he fought to collect himself, “she works at the elementary school. She was always involved in fire safety and public servant week. When you and Dean hit kindergarten she and Mary took you both down to the police station. Had you guys printed as part of this crime prevention initiative program? You know, in case…”
"You all packed for this weekend?" Dean asked, and Castiel nearly laughed at Dean's attempt to appear casual.
It was something he hadn’t thought possible, not in the romantic way his best friend had clearly meant, and as Dean had sobbed against the cold wall, it had been for the loss at the chance of something he hadn’t even known was on the table.  Those first few days, it was only the angel’s words that kept him going, and of course, Sam.
“Oh, really? Did you forget my mom died when I was a kid, too? I understand exactly.”
Castiel was vaguely aware of a floating sensation as Dean hefted him into his arms with a grunt as he continued to cry, burying his face in his boyfriend's neck.  He inhaled sandalwood and vanilla as Dean settled them on the couch until his raw weeping died down to hiccuping shudders of air. Castiel felt soft lips press against his forehead as Dean carded his fingers through his hair and made soothing
“I had assumed. But he’s not here at all, is he?” Castiel cocked his head and observed as Michael stood with him nearly toe to toe. Castiel searched pools of green for any recognition. A flash. Anything that said his beloved was aware.
“Death was a relief for Anna,” Michael spat out. “Living with Lucifer was like a slow, painful disease. She never spoke of what he did to her, but Anna’s eyes spoke volumes. I remember telling her, she could leave, I would give her money, and she could run away, but she never did.”
Castiel admired his husband’s ass in the new jeans they’d picked up on their California vacation. They were black and hugged his firm cheeks just right,  clinging to his bowed legs in such an appealing way. He was not the only one who thought so if the stares Dean garnered meant anything. The crowded heat of the bar had made Dean strip off the deep purple and black flannel down to the white tee-shirt he wore underneath.  It revealed off a portion of his handprint tattoo, and the low lights of the bar showed off the column of Dean’s throat that was marked by Cas’ mouth.
"Of course, Dearie," Rowena sighed. "I'm going to have to write this place off as a loss, aren't I" she sounded incredibly sad. Dean heard the words, but now it was through a veil.
“See you out there,” the man muttered, to either Dean, Jimmy or both, quickly exiting the highly charged room.
“New year’s eve, 2008.”
sound when a football collided with his stomach.
Dean stretched out across the seat as best he could and closed his eyes. A smile tugged at his lips when
“I love you, Dean,” Castiel murmured into his ear, arm draped tightly around Dean’s middle, making him feel safe and secure.
“I thought you were here cause you wanted to take pictures of the beautiful view?” Dean asked with a playfully arched brow.
“Dean doesn’t let people in.” It was a statement.
“That’s Sam and me with my dad and Grandpa Henry,” Dean said with a soft smile.
Alistair kicked the door closed, and Dean envisioned jamming his elbow, hard into Alistair's gut. Still, it was like he was walking through syrup, and he couldn't get his limbs to cooperate.
“Been planning this, huh?”
“Let’s go get changed and head on up. Nothing better at 2 a.m. and than chicken salad sandwiches and Pinot Grigio,” Dean said with a wink.
Dean decided not to give Castiel a choice; instead just packed his clothes in a duffle bag while he snored away, utterly unfazed by the sound of Dean pulling open drawers. Saturday had not come fast enough, with Castiel back to being quiet and withdrawn. Dean didn’t know what was going on, but he sure as hell hoped this short trip away would help.
He must have looked pretty miserable because with one last stink-eye, Charlie let it go.
January had quickly melted into February, and Castiel seemed more at peace with himself as time went by. It had been almost eight months since April had died, and Dean was happy that Castiel had gone back to therapy. Every Friday after school, Castiel went to his appointment, then came to watch Quattro Formaggio play. He played darts with Ash, and Dean had even seen him smile shyly when one of their coworkers complimented his rendition of The Tell-Tale Heart. Castiel’s nightmares had all but ceased, though he hated the small selfish part of himself that missed being able to comfort Castiel at night. He missed the stolen moments where Cas’ solid body wrapped around Dean, and he could pretend for just an instant that he could have this.
“Go on, man, I’ll lock up.”
In a flare of self-confidence, Castiel had said enough. He was done being spoken to like he was worthless, he was done doing Zachariah's job for him and not getting paid for it. He was just done. Why was he making himself miserable in a position that he hated, when he didn’t have to? He had enough money saved to float himself while building up a solid base.  Switching from a public accountant to private was what he’d always wanted to do; to build up a solid rapport with local businesses instead of big name companies that were so impersonal.
“You shouldn’t have to,” Castiel fired back.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam turned his blurry hazel eyes towards him, and Castiel grinned.
Daphne’s father had passed three years prior, but her mother, Naomi, was infinitely kinder than his own, and for that, Castiel was grateful. Naomi was one who appeared stern and often was, but she loved her daughter and Castiel by extension, and she recognized that there was no ill intent on Castiel’s part.
“You told him that?” Castiel started towards Cole again, fists clenched tightly at his side, until Dean intercepted him, running hands calloused from hard labor, down Castiel’s bare arms, calming him with his warm touch.
“Bitch,” Dean replied, standing up, taking Cas’ empty plate with him, and loading it into the dishwasher.
Dean pep-talked himself.
“As long as I’m with you, sweet boy, I’m ready for anything.”
Dean sighed, a soft smile tugging at his lips.  "Yes, sir," he said teasingly. "And I didn't mean to skip lunch, but Adam stopped by, and I got distracted. How'd your day go?"
"Don't even say it, Cas. If we hadn't come, it could have happened to somebody else.  This isn't your fault," Dean rushed to reassure Castiel when he saw the gleam of tears in his eyes. He watched as Castiel swallowed them back, taking a deep breath.
“Near the barn?” Gabriel asked, jotting notes into his phone when Rowena nodded in the affirmative.
The heat of Cas’ narrowed gaze should have set him on fire; should have killed him on the spot; dead and buried.
apologize to me for this.“
Emmanuel tilted his head, eying him speculatively. “What?”
Dean shook his head. "Not since my mom. It always seemed like such a commitment. Like it was verbal consent to hand someone the power to hurt you, you know? So, it… it wasn't something I ever said out loud. But with Leo, I thought that I might be ready," Dean scratched the back of his neck and let out a bitter laugh. "I'm glad I kept my mouth shut, because I came home sick early from work one night, and found him fucking some guy he picked up at a bar downtown. He didn't even try to hide it by going to the next town over."
“You have a tattoo of your own, I saw. What’s the story behind that?” Castiel looked pointedly at Dean’s left shoulder and let out a gasp when Dean whipped off his tee-shirt, showing off his own body art.  Castiel felt no shame in cataloging how beautiful he thought Dean was. There was a flaming pentagram on his left pectoral in black, which was intriguing, but it was the red handprint gripping his left deltoid that had Castiel’s hand seeking Dean’s skin. It was warm and freckle dusted and when his hand fit perfectly over the mark he felt a near electric charge at the point of contact.
“Dean, it’s okay,” the power had gone out but the bright snow blanketing the skylight gave the illusion of twilight making them both inky outlines.
Cas was excited to see his parents. His mother and father were very proud of Castiel and had been nothing but supportive of his lifestyle and choice to settle so far away from home. He knew he was lucky and there were times when Castiel missed them desperately.  He missed his mother’s quiet, soothing presence and the pure kindness of his father that was so lacking in many human beings these days. He supposed that was part of what attracted him to Dean. His best friend was another rare person who was pure kindness. It was hidden under a panty-dropping smile and a cocky attitude but short was the list of anyone who knew Dean and hadn't benefited from his generous nature in one way or another.
Dean’s body was nearly vibrating against Castiel’s, and he whined in Cas ear. “I’m ready, now, Cas.”
The graceful lines of Castiel’s body under the morning sun were nothing short of ethereal. His leg was extended up and away, hand grasping his big toe. Dean knew if were him he would have toppled over in an instant, but Castiel looked unmovable as a mountain, eyes closed, a serene expression on his face. Dean watched as Castiel seamlessly switched positions, giving the opposite leg the same treatment, and Dean found himself mindlessly flipping open the sketchpad to capture the moment.
This was one of those times where Dean would be happy to keep Castiel out until the last minute. Whenever the episode for this case was released, Castiel's face would be blurred, and the gravelly timbre of his voice would be distorted, per his fiance's request to remain anonymous. Some suspected, of course, who the mysterious medium was. Cult fans who followed the show and tried to keep up with the team on social media, but for the most part, they were lucky enough that Cas' anonymity remained intact.
Dean set Castiel up in the first-floor guest room after making him down a glass of water and a couple of Advil. He left another bottle of water and pills on the nightstand for the morning after Castiel climbed into bed.
“Yes, she’s been extra bitchy since you moved back,” Castiel said matter of factly, closing the door, but leaning in through the window.  Having Dean move back in August had been the highlight of his year, Castiel couldn’t deny it. He’d missed his best friend so very much. It had been rough going and Castiel hadn’t realized how lonely he’d felt until he was smiling over Chex mix and talking with Dean.
“I don’t see why we can’t still do those things,” Castiel finally said when he had his emotions under control.
you, but I
"It's just, the fun part, as a married couple buying a new home, is getting to pick it out ourselves. Making it our own, christening all the rooms..." Dean knew that what he was about to say could either make his husband laugh, which he hasn't done enough of in far too long; or Dean could find himself sleeping on the couch alone for being an insensitive asshole. "I just don't know whether I could ever feel comfortable rimming you in the same room where your grandmother made me cherry pie."
Castiel studied him, the surety of his deep voice, the smirk on his perfect face.
“Yes, seriously, Cas,” Dean groused, frowning at the knowing smirk that he swore flashed on his best friend’s face for a moment before Castiel schooled his expression.
“I suppose,” Castiel said, a lazy grin stealing across his face. After Castiel had to bullshit his way through a Bigfoot sighting to recount for his parents, Sam had looked a tiny bit guilty. Declaring that Dean and Castiel hadn’t slept in hours while Sam had dozed in the backseat, he’d insisted on taking Emmanuel and Anna out for a thank-you dinner while they relaxed and settled in. Though judging by the teasing smirk his father had sent them on the way out the door, his parents knew what was up. He chose not to think about that.
"Sam—" Castiel started, looking back at the building, wondering what the fuck was taking Gabriel so long.
He shuddered a bit at the surrealness of it all, pulling Dean even closer.
The fallout from the demise of Castiel and Daphne’s marriage was remarkably minimal. Minimal in the fact that Castiel’s parents no longer wanted to see him, end-of-story.  Castiel had not heard from either of them since the night he and Daphne set their parents down to dinner and explained their situation. They'd left before the first course. His father had written him off as an embarrassment to the family, and his mother, a disappointment to God.
, sweaty guy in a potato sack," Dean countered as he tossed the turkey leg in a barrel with a sign that said
“Leo,” Dean answered cooly, “What brings you back to town?”
“They’re pretty much done with set up, come lay down with me,” Castiel said, standing and holding out his hand. Now Dean was
Castiel didn’t remember much about that night, other than drinking copious amounts of alcohol and waking up in bed with April.
Dean had been putting his personal life on hold for years. He knew it worried his parents;John, his father was always encouraging him to meet someone and his mother was constantly trying to set him up with nurses from the hospital. Even Cas’ mom and dad, who still lived next door to the Winchesters, had tried their hands at matchmaking, but to no avail. He wasn’t looking for a relationship beyond a decent lay and a few laughs. To begin that deeper, meaningful chapter of his life that included love and a partner, and maybe even a family of his own making; it always felt wrong. As if him living his life to the fullest, he was giving up on Cas when he should be right there beside him.
”He’ll come to me when he’s ready. Besides,” Dean said forcing a grin, “school starts on Monday. Hunter Springs’ favorite English teacher can’t avoid me forever. Now hurry up and eat your yogurt, Samantha. We told Dad we’d meet him at the hardware store.”
Ever since they moved in next door, Eve would pop by unexpectedly, with excuses ranging from bearing welcome to the neighborhood cookies to the old stand-by of
Castiel chuckled as Dean grinned sheepishly, following him into the house. Castiel was content to take his time, indulging in late day kisses against the refrigerator as beef stew reheated in the microwave.  Between presses of lips, soft sighs, they snickered like children as they joked about hiring a stripper dressed as a clown for Sam and Jo's Jack and Jill bachelor party.
Castiel chuckled and the sound still made Dean’s pulse jump, even through the phone.
in its chasteness, but Dean was relishing it. Holding hands and innocent kisses that made Dean’s heart trip and stumble more than any he could remember in his long experience. Aside from Sam, Dean never had an emotionally intimate relationship as meaningful as the one he had with Castiel. Dean wasn’t typically romantic, but now that they’d crossed that vast chasm from best friend to more,  he wanted to celebrate it with some kind of meaningful gesture. Dean glanced down again into the passenger seat where an envelope full of documents sat. With help from Jodi, Donna and electronic finessing from new Charlie, Cas was now the owner of a social security number and I.D. for one
They didn’t speak on the short ride to Salt Meadow Harbor’s police station. Castiel didn’t think he could handle idle conversation and thankfully Dean seemed to understand that. Instead, he held Castiel’s hand as he drove, thumb rubbing soothing circles into his knuckles. He only pulled away when his cell phone rang.
“I know. But it’s only until an apartment becomes available. I can deal with it. I've slept in worse,” Emmanuel said with a shrug that did nothing for the almost pained expression on Dean’s face. He reached a hand out to Dean’s and squeezed. “It’s truly fine, Dean. I can take care of myself. I’m quite fit, you know.”
Castiel shook his head. “No. No, Dean.”
“Please, sir,” Dean’s voice was gruff with hunger, embarrassment superseded by the pure necessity to be taken by his husband.
“We were invited to a key party?”
"Seriously, thanks for doing this with me. I know there are a thousand other things you'd rather be doing," Dean said as they walked through the throngs of elves, orcs, and fairies milling about the camp. The Moondoor Faire was a LARPing event that ran from April through the end of October, culminating in a battle for the throne. Charlie had been crowned queen the last three years running, requiring her handmaiden to be present and accounted for in her court .
“I’ll be right behind you,” Leo said, and Jody sent Dean a sympathetic smile, and he couldn’t even bring himself to acknowledge her. Charlie tucked her hand in his and squeezed it as they watched Cas and Jody drive off.
When Dean had called Pam, his therapist had been proud of him, urging him to call her if he needed to anytime while they were on the road. Dean was happy that he didn’t think he would need to.
“Why, because April said so?” Charlie made a
Dear lord, he’d been so distracted by his state of undress around Dean, he‘d forgotten what had startled him in the first place. He turned towards the mirror again, twisting sideways.
“You never told me what made you start reading my books,” Emmanuel commented as he sampled his bourbon steak, humming in approval at the sweet and savory taste of the Whiskey marinade.
the words seemed to penetrate because suddenly, Dean was smiling his charming smile and making Cas' stomach do somersaults.
“We appreciate it, Sam,” Castiel said solemnly.
Meg merely gaped at him and Dean dragged a hand over his mouth, stifling a laugh as Emmanuel reached for his cup and sipped. He closed his laptop and slipped it into his messenger bag and laid it in the seat next to him at the counter. He didn’t look up when the door opened. Instead, he watched Dean’s face; sporting his ever-present charming smile, gorgeous green eyes friendly, but no more than that.
gonna freak out because he’s never gonna know. Because as soon as he walks in this house I’m gonna do exactly what I always do and paste a smile on my face. I’m going to be a good best friend and ask for all the dirty details even when listening to them makes me sick to my stomach,” the words were said viciously as Castiel slowly walked forward. It was like trying to move through syrup.
Easier said than done, of course, Dean thought wryly, as he tapped the envelope in his hand before climbing back into the Impala and tossing it in the passenger seat. They’d inched towards it, in true angsty fashion, with Sam rolling his eyes the entire way. Casual touches became more lingering. Movie nights had included more than slasher films and westerns because the sound of Cas’ laughter during romcoms and innocent delight when he was introduced to the music of Moana was too damn addictive. Shoulder to shoulder, thigh to thigh they would sit, much to his brother’s amusement. Nearly holding hands as they sat across from one another at Lebanon’s only 24-hour diner and an almost kiss after a hairier than usual salt and burn that was interrupted by resident cockblock Sam.
Castiel propped himself up on one arm,  inching back just a bit to lube up and guide the flushed head of his cock to Dean’s pink, puffy entrance. Castiel sank in with a guttural moan, cock gripped hot and tight. His forehead pressed to Dean’s nape as he clenched his eyes tight, breath hissing out as he fought for control to not start blindly thrusting. Dean relaxed back against him with a sigh. Castiel began to rock into Dean gently, the slow drag of his dick against Dean’s rim creating delicious friction. Castiel reached around his lover's waist and curled his fingers still slick with lube, around Dean’s cock, making a tunnel with his fist for the thick, silken heat of him to push into. Castiel eased back, then fucked into Dean faster, angling his hips and brushing against his prostate.
A chant of "
Castiel shrugged. "It's just stew in the crockpot. It'll keep. I thought maybe you'd like to share a shower with me," he cocked his head invitingly as Dean followed him into the house through the laundry room.
“Claire, listen to me. None of this is your fault, okay? Luke Pellegrino and his crew are criminals and murderers,” his breath hitched on the word, ”Whatever is going on right now is on them, not you.”
“It’s stupid, but I feel like... if I fall asleep, I’m gonna wake up and you’ll still be…” Dean sounded ashamed and Castiel wasn’t having that.
They had abandoned the idea of a bonfire on the beach, instead choosing to watch the fireworks from the roof-top garden. Any hopes of getting to act out any of his fantasies with Dean, however, were cut short when they all imbibed in copious amounts of alcohol and those that didn’t live within walking distance we’re forced to either call a cab or crash at Dean and Emmanuel’s. In the end, Sam had taken the couch, Meg had taken Emmanuel’s bed, and Emmanuel had wound up passed out on Dean’s bed, wrapped around the man like an octopus. He remembered being soothed when his human pillow had escaped his embrace, letting out a groan of displeasure at the loss of heat.  He felt the cool press of lips to the side of his temple and it registered that Dean was leaving for work. Emmanuel rolled into his side of the sheets, burying his face in Dean’s vanilla and sandalwood scented pillow. When he woke a little while later, he’d been hard, and allowed himself the luxury of jerking off in Dean’s bed, surrounded by his scent and filled with obscene thoughts of the man himself. He refused to feel guilty for indulging in fantasies, though he did wash and change the sheets.
Dean sent Gabriel an unimpressed look. “Don’t you think we’d be there if we should have?”
"Does Pellegrino even know what you're up to?"
Alex flashed him a grin and reached into the bag. “Thanks, Mr. Winchester.”
"It feels pointed. I'm not even catching them out of the corner of my eye, yet I feel them. Whoever it is, wants me to know they're here, but doesn't want me to see them. It's a game," Castiel said, irritation lacing his gravelly voice.
“Only three. Minor offenses,” Dean cocked his head, ”well, sort of minor,” Dean amended, thinking of how much of a mess it must have been to contain all of the frogs that Alex had let loose in his protest of dissection.
"When you ordered me into the bathroom and pushed me into the stall, commanding me to get on my knees, I was relieved. I didn’t want to think, I just wanted to feel like I was yours.”
, did he wish the man he loved would stick with cases about sweet little old ladies instead of tragedy and murder.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Dude, you’re killing me. Is this gonna be a problem, Cas?” Dean asked, trying to hide the worry in his tone.
“Shush, let him talk,” Castiel chastized and Dean settled down.
“You gonna stare at me all day, or are you actually gonna do something?” Dean snarked playfully, earning himself a light smack.
“Here, here,” echoed Sam and John, as Dean just smiled at him softly from his spot beside him on a wide log bench.
“Sure I can,” Gabriel said, sucking on his pop obnoxiously. “You’re all glowy. And I know you and Dean.”
Castiel knew it was more likely because Dean was about to bust a gut laughing at the fact that he and Castiel’s sexcapade last night was now being factored in as Yeti evidence and needed a place to hide.
Oh, he knew. Paranoid as fuck. Dean only smoked once in a while with Castiel, and always the old fashioned way. He didn’t like bringing his food into it.
They slipped their sleep pants and tee-shirts back on, and Dean unzipped the sleeping bag. Castiel slid in first, so he could pull Dean back against the warmth of his chest.
, his inner voice whispered, which Dean promptly told to shut up.
Dean stood over at the grill with his Uncle Bobby and Cas' dad Chuck as they chatted over beer. Castiel admired his husband from afar. The sun teased out the gold and caramel streaks in Dean’s burnt honey hair, and Cas knew if he were close enough, that his ginger freckles would be more pronounced. Dean hated his freckles, but Cas loved them and how they were scattered all over his body from his flawless face to his deliciously bowed legs. Said legs were displayed beautifully in a pair of khaki shorts, and Castiel watched as Dean expertly flipped a burger. Cas' eyes trailed up from the leather corded bracelet on Dean’s wrist, to his strong forearm, and over his firm and comforting chest, wearing the worn AC/DC shirt they shared. As though feeling the heat of his gaze, Dean glanced his way and gifted him a playful wink.
“What are you doing here? I thought I was meeting you—” he didn’t know what to say. Home? He wasn’t there officially yet. “At the manor?” he decided that was safe enough and he scowled when Castiel’s lips curled in amusement.
“Dean Winchester, stop yelling at your brother, it’s not going to make him go any faster,” Dean’s mother, Mary, chided. “Now go get in the car, Cas, you’re riding with us since Gabriel brought a friend.”
there.
“Well apparently after the hit and run, the police didn’t think they’d be able to catch who did it. The traffic cams and security cameras from the nearby business didn’t have the right angle.”
“Some place fun. Let’s go take a shower—separate showers,” Dean reiterated when a wicked glint appeared in Castiel’s ocean eyes. “And on the way, you can tell me why this Bartholomew makes you scowl so much,” Dean rubbed the furrow between Cas’ brows until they smoothed out.
Dean could tell Cas was intrigued and laughed when he gaped at him in surprise when Dean opened up the small garden shed and dragged out a free-standing punching bag.  He grabbed the gloves from the shelves, not trusting Cas to not damage his hands without them.
“What about kids? Is that… was that something we ever talked about?”
“Dude, you okay?” Dean whispered before shaking his head. “Never mind, dumb question.”
Now, a week later, it was game night again and Emmanuel smothered a yawn with his hand. He honestly wasn’t sure he’d make it through the whole night.  It had been a busy end of July for Dean. He had three weddings, two beach themed ones to bake cakes for, plus an astronomical order of
“I’m okay to talk about her now,” Castiel said quietly as they danced. “I was too angry before. And guilty.”
“Murder-suicide?” Dean offered, and Rowena gave a contemplative nod.
"You shoulda seen him, Cas. Skinny jeans, a faux hawk. Made us call him Priestley," Meg added, and Castiel couldn't help but snort at that.
“Yes,” Castiel said, voice suddenly firm and lips curved up in a smile. “Please come to my dick of a brother’s wedding with me. As yourself, though, not as my fake date, because you’re right. I owe them nothing and fuck what they think of me. ”
“You two need to get over that whole cheerleading thing. I’ll be polite and not mention how many years it’s been,” Dean said and Lisa huffed, but didn’t protest.  “Decide what you want yet?”
“Dean, are you under the impression that I'm only here temporarily?”
symbol embossed on the side.
"Shut up. Maybe. Anyway, Becky said she heard Sam tell Gabriel that his brother's been burnt pretty bad before. You're gonna have your work cut out for you. And if you fuck him over, like you did your last three conquests? It's not gonna be pretty for anyone."
As he knew Dean hoped, Castiel cracked a smile. “No, I can make it,” Castiel said, straightening up when his cousin Hannah clasped his hands and smiled kindly.
Castiel got dressed and padded barefoot out of the bedroom. He saw two steaming mugs sitting on the coffee table, one coffee, the other tea. There was a small pipe and a baggie of weed on the table as well. Castiel laughed at himself when he felt a little thrill in his veins at the idea of doing something he only remembered as being illegal and frowned upon. A thick black and yellow striped blanket had been placed in the corner of the couch and Castiel knew just by looking at it that it would be as soft as a cloud.
They stayed one more night with the Novaks, and Hannah was even able to stop by for a few hours on Sunday to visit with all of them. On Monday morning, they’d started the day with lingering kisses and lazy handjobs before going upstairs for a big breakfast with everyone. Cas’ parents were taking the morning off to see them on their way. They said tearful goodbyes to Cas’ parents, promising to come out for Thanksgiving, Sam too, of course, and Dean was happy to go along with that plan, especially when Anna promised to teach Dean how to make Pirozkhi, which were oven-baked mini-pies, for dessert.
“Pick up, pick up, pick up,” he gritted out as the phone continued to ring.
Castiel laughed, placing his camera up on the bar. “Hmm. Bees, yes. Glamour shots, not so much,” Castiel tapped his chin in mock consideration. “ I might have a fedora you could wear and we could give it a go,” Cas teased.
“I don’t know if it’s a good idea,” he said, finally and Dean tried to ignore the stab of hurt, but something must have shown on his face as Castiel hurried to reassure him, hand grasping at Dean’s knee as he stared at him imploringly.
Bela let her eyes linger on Castiel for the first time, and he met them with a raised brow.
“Hey, Frank. You got any of Becky’s favorite Sangria in stock?” Dean called out to the man crouched behind the register.  “Frank?”
The inside of Java the Cup had low tables and sofas, as well as bean bag chairs and reading nooks. Dean loved it and was so proud of the owner, his oldest and dearest friend, Charlie Bradbury. They’d met in high school detention and bonded over a love for all things fantasy and sci-fi.
“Are you sure? Because if you’re nervous-”
“The whole house smells like lemon pledge, so yes, I noticed,” Castiel’s voice rumbled against Dean’s ear, and he sighed.
“So you’re mad at me over a fictional scenario where we’re not married, and Dean is gay?”
“Couldn’t relax so I made some more of those blueberry-lemon tarts that are going like crazy, and a couple of pies for tomorrow, and tonight’s dinner,” Dean gestured down to the steaming pie pan as he rolled out the top crust.
Castiel nodded. “Well, Ms. Talbot, while I appreciate your concern as to my well being via my marriage, I assure you it is unnecessary. I suggest you move along.” Castiel’s brother and brother-in-law wore twin expressions of
“I was doing an oil change, and that’s beside the point. What do you mean for my safety? We live in Angel Falls. I’m more likely to be attacked by a moose than a person.”
“Oh, you mean that strawberry lollipop isn't filling enough?” He asked sarcastically, taking the turn on to Nicholson Drive and then taking a left at Lambert to hit the drive-thru.
"Sorry, partner, but you were starting to make bedroom noises, and I am so not here for that."
“Fair enough,” Dean murmured silky, before claiming Cas’ lips in another drugging kiss, taking his hands in his calloused ones, pulling Castiel from the room. His heart felt as light as a cloud when Dean tugged him down the hallway and into his bedroom, pushing the angel onto the plush memory foam. They took their time undressing with soft caresses and long looks of love. And when Castiel received Dean into his body,  their eyes locked and reverent on each other until they each crested, breaking like waves on the shore.
if that didn’t have little Dean twitching in his pants.
Emmanuel had a second to look chagrined before letting out a needy growl when Dean wrapped his slick hand around two of them.
be late, and they both had last-minute details they needed to take care of before the car service to the airport came to get them at the godforsaken hour of four am. One of the details being the prescription of Xanax so Dean could fly—something he hated to do and never would do if it weren’t for Cas—without an embarrassing meltdown. Spring break was only a week, but it was also Dean and Castiel’s anniversary, so they would be gone for two, and it would be spent in the same private bungalow, surrounded by flowers they’d had on their honeymoon. Dean could hardly believe they’d been married five years already, he thought with amazement, looking down at his wedding ring. At the beginning of their relationship, their families called them rash and impulsive for getting engaged after only two months of dating. They were even more shocked when Dean and Castiel revealed that they would be getting married the following month when Dean was on Spring break. But, as they had explained to their families when breaking the news, when you know, you know.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I know that.”
Castiel ignored him. “Lisa? The girl you do ‘yoga’ with?”
“Yes,” Dean said, voice grave as the dead.
Dean had joined the local chapter of the Moondoor Chronicles, an online gaming group, nearly a year ago. None of them had met up in person; most didn’t share their real names, aside from Garth, who had no problems sharing his life story, which was how Dean knew that Garth worked in the plaza fifteen minutes from Dean’s apartment building, as a dentist. In Moondoor, Dean was Hunter, handmaiden to Celeste, the Queen of Moons. They’d met when their squads joined forces and Dean helped Celeste overthrow the former king and take her place on the throne. Dean was not ashamed to have replaced Saturday morning cartoons with online gaming.
“I always miss the good stuff,” Sam said sadly.
He truly was. Even blurry-eyed and sloppy-assed drunk, Dean was something to see.
It was fast and dirty, and deep grunts of pleasure escaped Castiel's lips, with no hope of being quiet. Dean seemed just as wrecked as he was, as soft gasps fell from his open mouth. Castiel could feel his orgasm building fast, his whole body quaking against Dean's.
“That sounds perfect, Dean, thank you.”
“That’s okay, Donna, I’m right here.” Castiel watched as an attractive brunette with warm eyes come around the corner of the desk.
Dean's head dropped back on Castiel's shoulder, a guttural wail sounding from his lips as Castiel shifted just a bit, the angle making him rub against Dean's prostate on every thrust. Castiel sucked and bit at Dean's neck as he continued to rock into him, the wet sound of Dean's fist jerking his cock pushing Cas even closer to release.
Dumbfounded, Dean nodded, as Castiel left the kitchen to get changed into his clothes from yesterday. Methodically, Dean washed the frying pan and loaded the dishwasher, before going upstairs to get changed into something appropriate enough to drive Castiel home.
“Jesus Christ, Gabriel,” God save him from curious straights.
“I think she’s gonna do it, guys,” Jo murmured, and everyone turned to look as the girl’s friends left, waving goodbye at her and winking as she hung back, obviously waiting for Dean.
Dean grinned. “Every once in a while.”
Unfortunately, there wasn’t really a charity for wives who manipulate you by making up babies. Though, Castiel supposed he could make a Gofundme.
“Well, I can probably help you with that if your afternoon is free,” Dean said.
“Yes, I remember you found out during one of our tutoring sessions. That was a good day.”
“Allegedly,” Dean interrupted, and Castiel laughed from across the room where he was helping Dean pack his apartment. It wasn’t quite the romantic evening he was hoping for their first real date, but Castiel insisted, saying what better way to get to know someone than to help them put their lives in a box.
The recipe was quick and easy. 3 cups Brown Sugar, 3 cups of butter, -
“Yeah, could be important, s’okay,” Dean said, nodding at the waiter who gestured to their wine glasses, coming over to top them off.
“Whoever he is,” Gabriel interjected, “he’s probably been watching Jack for a while. Pretty ballsy with two cops as guardians. To get close enough to know the kid’s Saturday schedule, without being seen?”
“Morning, Sunshine,” Dean’s voice was thick with sleep as he stumbled to his feet, caging Cas with his arms, bringing him in for a warm embrace.
“So you moved all the way to California so you wouldn’t have to see me and we could preserve our friendship,” Castiel’s voice was thick with regret. “We’re both at fault. I should have known. I should have pushed you more for a real reason why you needed to start this whole new life, three thousand miles away. This whole thing, our situation, it’s just as much my fault as it is yours.”
“I always knew I was attracted to men, deep down, but I didn't allow myself to think about it. Not purposely, anyway. It wasn't until I went to the wedding of two of my friends from college. Cesar and Jesse,” Castiel felt so loose and relaxed, as though he talked this intimately with Dean all the time. He knew part of it was the wine, but mostly it was Dean.‘
Dean scrubbed his hands over his face roughly. “No, that’s not what I’m say-” he broke off, frustration ripe in Dean’s tone. “ Anyway, a few days later it was our anniversary. Since we share it with New Year’s Eve, we always wind up at the Roadhouse to celebrate with all of our friends. The only difference this year was that Sammy and Gabe had rented out the back room for a private party instead.”
Dean popped a piece of bacon in his mouth, swatting Bobby’s hand away when it reached towards his plate. “Nah. I know Cas. If I push him before he’s ready, he’ll clam up. Thinks he’s burdening me or some stupid shit like that.”
“Why are you staring at me like that?” Castiel questioned as Dean seemed to freeze in surprise.
Castiel snorted. “Yeah, not the smartest place to hide.”
Castiel walked a slow circle around, hand never leaving Dean’s face. “You’ve been so good, Dean, taking care of me this week.”
“Alright, alright, enough stalling. Tell us what’s going on with you. Is it something to do with Jo?”
"When have I declared that I'm going to marry someone?" Tearing his gaze away from the stunning man, Castiel arched a pierced brow at his friend, "nine-ball, corner pocket," Castiel made the shot, easily and Charlie huffed out a breath.
Castiel saw his brother and his niece heading out the precinct door, but he didn't even stop. He snatched the keys out of Sam's hand, and tossed him his own.
Dean laughed heartily at that as he filled the cupcake trays. “Yeah, my mother would have loved that,” Dean slid the cupcakes into the oven and set the timer. “ ‘Sides, it was always gonna be the Honeybee Bakery. It’s what he wanted,” he said simply and Benny nodded.
"As well as can be expected," Jack said with a nod.
Dean’s own cock was thick and long, head flushed and weeping, and Castiel was so eager to welcome it into his body. Cas clutched at Dean’s shoulder as he shifted back to watch Dean slick himself up. Castiel’s hands slid down Dean’s arms, before he nudged his hand aside, taking Dean’s lubed up cock in his fist. Dean spread Castiel’s ass wide with his palms, and Cas guided Dean to his furled entrance. The spongy head caught on Cas’ rim, and with a dark groan of need, Castiel sank down, slow and fluid.
"Enough," Dean murmured,  licking his palm and reaching between them. "Enough for this," and Castiel groaned against Dean's Adam's Apple when he closed his fist around their lengths and began to stroke. Castiel propped himself up on his elbow and brought his free hand down to lace with Dean's, making a tight tunnel for them to fuck into.
Take a steadying breath.
"That we're soulmates, of course."
“I think I like that,” Castiel said and the smile that bloomed on Dean’s face was dazzling.
Castiel made it through the rest of the day,  hugging Gabriel and Kali goodbye and leaving April’s mother in the care of her sister, promising again to get to the list as soon as possible. There was no hug goodbye or soft words between them, only a nod and a thank you.
“Heya, Cas,” Dean said, moss green eyes flecked with gold sparkling at him, before they closed, as Dean swooped down to steal Castiel’s mouth in a deep kiss. He tasted like coffee and cherries and Castiel sank into the exploration, seeking out the flavor of Dean with his tongue.
"Dean! Look at me," Cas' tone was commanding, but that didn't seem to matter to whatever it was that had taken hold of him. Dean understood now. He was merely along for the ride. "Dean, are you in there?"
“Yeah, well, pretty sure after all these years of baking, that is just permanently seeping out of my pores.”
Ha. Sure. Dean was totally going to forget all about the murder he witnessed and being tied to a chair by an angel-faced millionaire with an affection for knives and tranquilizers. Still, he made quick work of the bathroom and stared at his chalky-white reflection. The freckles he detested showed in stark relief on his face. Dean’s green eyes were dull and bloodshot, and he was thankful as fuck that tomorrow was his day off. Assuming he got out of here without being murdered and hidden inside of a bag of coffee beans, Dean was going to need it.
Castiel was grateful for the afternoon sunshine and salt-water breeze when he stepped outside onto the sidewalk. He shook off the under the microscope vibe he had felt inside and climbed into the comforting familiarity of the Impala. It smelled like Dean plus leather, and it soothed him.
"Noted," he murmured quietly as Dean and Charlie came back to the table, laughing like old friends.
“That’s easier said than done,” Castiel grumbled as he flipped to an episode of
“Yeah, well. Don’t be
“Hey, Mick?” Dean called down the other end of the bar to his co-worker. “I’m going on my break before the rush.”
“You know, Meg?” Emmanuel called as she started away. “Dean is lucky you’re looking out for him.”
Dean wondered if that meant it was a common occurrence for Charlie to see her boss chatting it up with a dude tied to a chair and finally snapped.
Sam began peppering Cas with questions on fur color and shoulder width, and Dean snickered softly as Castiel attempted to answer the questions with noncommital answers. Cas was obviously not comfortable lying to Sam but unwilling to say they were out of breath because they’d had hot, public sex against a tree.
status.
A shadow of remorse passed over Cas' features, but Dean felt remarkably removed. Dean observed Rowena; She was pacing, cell phone to her ear as she listened to whoever was on the line. He vaguely wondered how the woman felt about all of this, though truthfully, he didn't really care. If anything, he felt almost bored. What was wrong with him?
“Dean, I wanted to talk to you about something,” Castiel shifted his gaze to Dean’s inky profile as they sped down the interstate.
“Do not believe everything you read on the internet or your local magazine stand,” Castiel bit out sharply, and Dean was sure he heard a hint of hurt beneath the steely words. “But fine. I’ll give you your four weeks, Dean, but I want you to quit this job,” Dean watched as Castiel gave Alistair a not-so-subtle glower. “There is no reason for you to continue to work here, and I cannot successfully
For someone who just got off, quite spectacularly if Castiel did say so himself, and followed it up with a Denny’s Lumberjack slam-
Charlie only laughed delightedly. “You know what I'm talking about. You’ve got total heart eyes,” she said.
Castiel, Dean had learned, could sleep anywhere at any time. Despite it being only one in the afternoon, Castiel had nodded off almost as soon as Baby’s tires hit the open road. Cas was slumped in his seat, head leaning heavily against Dean’s shoulder, letting out soft little snores. The sounds of Sister Christian belted over the radio, not bothering Castiel’s slumber in the slightest.
Finally, Claire replied, “We met in Moondoor.”
“You in a hurry, sunshine?” Dean asked cheekily, and heat suffused his body at the dark look and arched browed leveled his way. Dean swallowed harshly at the picture the man-made; dark hair tousled, tanned bare chest with dusky nipples he ached to taste, and dark freckles teasing him delectably.
He felt all eyes on him when he finally spoke. “If I show you my driver’s license it will tell you that my name is Emmanuel James Milton.  It’s the only name I’ve ever remembered since I was a child.” Castiel licked his suddenly dry lips. “You see, my mother, Anna, she always told me that was because of the accident. Apparently we had been involved in a car crash when I was eight years old. Anna said it was because we were on the run from my father who was a very bad person,” he shook his head, as if annoyed.
“Dean,” Castiel growled, eyes lifting from their connected cocks to watch the flush climb up Dean’s chest, to watch his back bow as he gasped out a soundless wail, coming without warning against the head of Castiel’s dick. The hot feeling of Dean’s spunk against his slit, the slippery feel of it, encased in Castiel’s sheath tipped him right over the edge and he gave a hoarse shout rough as sandpaper, coming spectacularly. Dean’s forehead dropped to the hollow of Castiel’s shoulder as he panted madly, fingers still gently stroking along with Castiel’s. Castiel followed suit, dipping his head to the crook of Dean’s neck, after pressing a soft kiss to the sweat-dampened skin.
April would say.
“Anything you need, dude.”
“I won it,” Emmanuel said proudly.
“Thank you, love,” Castiel said, kissing Dean’s swollen lips softly.
Their bodies quaked, slumping against the railing, Castiel’s sweaty body encompassing Dean’s.  Castiel had to make an effort to gasp air into his lungs, and he chuckled breathlessly as he heard Dean do the same.  Heated bodies cooling, the warm summer breeze felt cool now on Cas’ damp skin, and he could feel his cum leaking out from around his softening cock in Dean’s ass. He let his wet dick slide out, and Dean groaned, rim sensitive and puffy.
“No, Lilith. He’s not,’ Castiel bit out, wondering if she were related to Eve as they looked a little similar. He glanced across the room, but their hosts for the evening were nowhere to be found. More than likely, having already left for the rooftop.
Dean felt Castiel lightly bang his head between Dean’s shoulder blades.
“Even if you could force me out, what do you think I’d leave behind, hmmm?”
Feeling bold, Castiel had shoved Dean against the side of the car and proceeded to plunder his mouth, sloppily tongue fucking, deep and obscene. Dean initially responded with enthusiasm, one hand digging into the dip of Cas’ back, the other clenched in the material of Cas’ tee-shirt.  It had been sobering when Dean had pulled back, cheeks flushed, green eyes wide.
“Looks like you got a nice memory floatin’ up there, brother,” Dean’s head jerked up, smiling when he saw Benny leaning against the doorjamb.
“What, baby? What do you need?” Castiel asked, playfully, knowing precisely what Dean needed, but wanting to hear the words. His own hard shaft bobbed against his stomach, and Castiel let out a deep groan of his own when he pressed himself harder against Dean's sweat-slick body.
“Heya, Cas.”
“She just doesn’t want to have to deal with your hungover sasquatch ass in the morning,” Dean smirked.
”You think that because I have never been with a man, that I’m only going to want you until I...what? Get bored and want to see if someone else does it for me?” The words came out harsher than he intended, but Castiel couldn’t help but be offended.
“What was all that about?” Dean shivered as Castiel’s husky voice murmured into his ear before he dropped a kiss on Dean’s shoulder.
“I’m okay,” his voice was sandpaper. "Just need a second,” Dean furrowed his brow as he studied Castiel to see if he was really alright, before nodding and standing shoulder to shoulder with Gabriel, hiding him from view.
For a second, time stopped, and there was nothing but heat. The slick, slide of tongues as they stroked against each other. Dean tasted of cherries and wine and
“A long time,” Dean finally said. “Probably junior year of college,” Dean admitted and chuckled when Castiel’s brows winged up in surprise. “We, uh, I remember we were at some party, some shindig Gabriel was throwing. I was playing beer pong with some chick and someone was doing a horrific rendition of
Dean passed out the bottles, and they mock-cheered as they each downed one. Dean gave a little shudder as the whiskey burned down his throat, and he chased it with a long pull of his beer.
The gritty, screeching whine of the metal doors sliding open had Dean raising his fuzzy head. Footsteps echoed across the concrete floor. Before him, Dean could see a pair of sensible shoes. As Dean dragged his gaze up, he spied a pair of dark slacks, a white dress shirt, and dark blue tie; backward, all enveloped in an ill-fitting beige trenchcoat. A tax accountant had taken Dean hostage. He nearly snorted until his eyes finally rested on easily the most beautiful face he’d ever seen in his twenty-eight years. High, cut cheekbones were sporting a light stubble, accentuated by wide pink lips that looked pillowy and chapped. He had a straight nose and stunning eyes so blue they put the ocean to shame. A dark eyebrow, arched dangerously, matched the tousled locks on his head that screamed, I just got deliciously fucked, and Dean felt a momentary flash of irrational jealousy at whoever got to put their hands on this man. Dean was so caught up in staring that it took him a full minute to realize that angel-face was actually speaking to him.
Dean found himself grinning at how high school it all was. “Cas, you realize this is a dance for the kids, not for the teachers, don’t you?”
Charlie smacked him on the arm. “Hey! Sexist!”
. It would be given to the soon to be former angel along with his own key to Baby with the initials
“Problem?” Dean asked, tone teasing.
“You’ve been fucking with me about this shit the whole time, haven’t you?” Cas asked flatly and Dean barked out a laugh, eyes shifting to the rearview mirror and landing on his brother.
“Remember when you said that you looked up demisexual?” Dean asked and Castiel nodded, the smoke held in his lungs and preventing his words. “Regular porn just doesn’t do it for you. We’ve tried a few times, just to see, but it really doesn’t turn you on.”
“You’re impossible,” Castiel rolled his eyes, but his words were fond. “Sam, look, we’re sorry. We weren’t hiding it from you because we didn’t want you to know. We certainly didn’t plan on being so… so brazen. It’s just… “
“Sheriff Mills, was there something I forgot before I left?” Castiel asked, putting the phone on speaker.
Dean screamed the question in his head, getting a rumbling laugh in reply.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Don’t tease, Gabriel,” he said, excusing himself to wash up.
“Fine,
Dean blushed and stammered, and Sam guffawed loudly behind him as Emmanuel looked on with quiet amusement.
“I promise that someday you’ll trust me enough not to ask that question.”
“Nope,” Dean interrupted loudly, popping the p, and Castiel rolled his eyes at the interruption.
A sidelong glance showed Castiel nodding, looking just as happy as Dean felt at the news.  With their wedding only months away, Dean and Castiel had finally decided on a honeymoon spot. Two weeks in a private bungalow in Waikiki, Hawaii. When Cas had first mentioned a beach themed honeymoon, Dean had been surprised.
“Okay, are we ready for our first fan question?” the Emcee asked the crowd, a round of applause sounding as a college-age girl stepped up to the microphone.
“Cas? Cas, come on, don’t do this to me.
Dean knew exactly why, and it was the way she was looking at Castiel right now. Like she wanted to do things to him only he should be allowed to do. Meg knew exactly who Castiel was when Dean had finally told Bobby his future living plans.
Castiel stared at Dean with an arched brow and deadpan expression. “Yes, it’s hilarious,” he said before rounding the back of the car to get into the passenger seat, settling back into familiar leather seats.
“Wait. Are you serious?” Castiel asked, and Dean shrugged, trying for nonchalant.
“But right now,” Castiel shook his head, tugging on his bottom lip with his teeth, then releasing. Dean’s eyes were drawn to the marks imprinted into the pink flesh and wanted to soothe them with his tongue. “Right now,” Castiel continued,” all I want to do is kiss you again. Do you mind?”
"I'm sorry. But I knew you'd come for me. I had to take a chance, Cas, he was gonna take the kid. I couldn't let him go alone."
“Claire, who says she wasn’t?” he asked softly, and Claire laughed bitterly.
“Dean,” Castiel hissed, side-eying his fiance, warning in his tone.
, since I know you don’t want any part of that, I do think it is wise that we find some ways to protect ourselves. Maybe some kind of protection tattoos,” Castiel pondered, and Dean wet his lips as he pictured it.
Emmanuel placed the box on the coffee table and bent down to pick up the wallet, grabbing a picture that had slipped out as he did so.
Alistair blindly reached in the back, grabbing at the blanket Dean and Castiel kept in the back for stargazing. He dragged it into the front, and Dean realized what it was for as Alistair draped it over himself, gun covered but still pointing at Dean and Jack, tenting the green and plaid wool.
"We were walking," Dean continued, shaking his head, then met Castiel's gaze head-on," and this hand… so cold… just grabbed my ankle and yanked. There was nothing I could do. I couldn't move, I couldn't fight. It was like I'd turned to stone."
“Do… do you remember me, Cassie?” Gabriel had never sounded so vulnerable and Dean watched as Cas’ face softened as he smiled sadly.
“Well, that will probably be on the menu for tonight.”
John stood up and walked over, standing in front of Castiel. He clapped him on the shoulder. “I promise, it’ll get better. This one’ll take care of you,” he said, nodding at Dean.
Gabriel’s brows rose in surprise and Emmanuel had the feeling that asking for help was not something Gabriel was used to from Dean.
. He wants to talk everything to death and never wants to just… do!”
“G’night, Cas, I love you.”
They traded ridiculously shy grins, considering what they had just done, in the mirror as they quickly washed and finished doing up their pants. There was no way that their self-satisfied grins didn't show what they had spent the last little while doing.
“We don’t have time to wait for Henriksen. That’s
“Okay?  Okay, what? I just said a bunch of shit. Oh. Okay like you want me to come to the wedding?”
Dean was planning a quiet dinner of his world famous- well, bunker-famous- bacon burgers, in the library, complete with wine and craft beer. Sam had promised to be scarce, going to a double feature with Jack at the movie theater outside of town. His stomach jumped, butterflies racing and making him this weird mix of excited and nauseous. Dean was so distracted in his thoughts as he started the car that he barely had time to blink when someone wrenched open the passenger side door, sliding into the seat and knocking Dean’s envelope to the floor of the car.
“Maybe they didn’t see anything,” Castiel said, stepping into the warmth of their bedroom, chewing on his thumbnail.
Castiel could feel his orgasm building low in his belly and he hoped that Dean was as close as he was. Castiel propped himself on one arm so he could slide a hand between their slick stomachs to grip Dean’s cock. As soon as his hand wrapped around the silken head, Dean was gone. Castiel watched in wonder as the mere touch of his fingers around Dean’s shaft had him arching, gasping brokenly as he spilled, thick and white all over Castiel’s hand.
“We don’t usually scene in public unless we’ve talked about it first and we don’t do the club scene or perform,” Dean continued.
stolen him from somebody else? Castiel could feel himself getting worked up again and fought to control his breathing.
. How was this his life?
If that wasn’t tragic enough, in a cruel twist of fate, Dean’s younger brother, Sam, lost his fiance Jessica a few years ago in a dorm fire.
,” he mimicked Dean’s voice. Castiel took an ambitious spoonful of sticky sweetness and was grateful when Eilleen reached in her fast-food bag and produced two small Orange juice bottles and tossed one to Cas. He nodded his head in thanks over a mouthful of the tangy drink, enjoying the taste and unsticking his tongue from the roof of his mouth. Since he was slowly becoming human, food had begun to taste less like molecules which to his amusement had made Dean both happy and sad, because it meant Dean could cook his favorite foods for Cas, but couldn’t steal from his plate as much anymore.
a stickler for the law.
“My God, Dean, I’m so sorry.” Castiel frowned when Dean shrugged it off, clearly uncomfortable, and he was unable to stop himself from drawing the man into a tight embrace. Dean held himself stiff for a moment before relaxing into Castiel's arms, his chilled face settling into the crook of Cas’ neck.
Castiel captured another picture of the man in front of him. “I am,” he said, smiling when his words caused Dean to blush.
“Well, it’s not like we bragged about the in-school suspension, Uncle Cas. We didn’t, like, tweet about it.”
Emmanuel held up his hand to stop the torrent of Meg’s words. “I’ll hear about it from Dean when and if he decides to share with me. Until then, it’s his business and probably not something you should be advertising to others, well-intentioned or not.” He didn’t try and mask the disapproval in his tone. When Meg didn’t say anything more, Emmanuel scooped up another bite of parfait, enjoying the crunch of the granola combined with tart cherry.
“But Sam wound up back here anyway?”
Castiel came back from the bedroom with one suitcase and his duffel bag.
"S' matter?" Dean asked, lazily stroking his cock and distracting Castiel momentarily. "Cas?"
"Really? "
“Dean! Dean!”
“Don’t change the subject. So what? He just randomly changes his name?” Sam was sounding more and more irritated and Dean couldn’t help but laugh, though he was touched by his brother's concern.
Seeing the brightness back in Castiel’s eyes told Dean that it was true. Dean knew it would be a long road to come back from losing someone you loved like that. Healing was easier said than done, but he also knew it was important to have someone to lean on.
“You are perfect,” Castiel murmured, before drawing back. He dragged his cock against Dean’s bottom lip and he shuddered, wanting so badly to touch his tongue to the now leaking slit. “You may put your hands on me, but only your mouth can touch my cock, understood?”
Wordlessly, Dean rose and went into the kitchen. He grabbed thick wooden soup bowls and put them on the counter before pulling a cutting board out of the drawer to slice the Italian bread.  Sam and Gabriel seemed to know not to follow, twin expressions of apology on their faces. Instead, they turned the television on and left Castiel to go after Dean.
Dean grabbed the mail from the box at the end of the driveway and tossed his keys on the kitchen counter once he got inside. After getting cleaned up and changing into his sweats and a tee-shirt, Dean felt much more human. Deciding he was in the mood for spice, Dean ordered Thai, and had a debate with himself on whether to watch the latest recordings of
Dean laughed, nodding his thanks at Kevin when he handed him a takeout bag with the rest of his goodies.
“Saw what?” Castiel asked sharply.
, Dean had whispered, and Cas’ laugh was bordering on a sob as he buried his head in between the juncture of Dean’s neck and shoulder. Greedily, he’d breathed in the familiar clean scent of
“You don’t have to save anyone here, Dean,” Castiel whispered. Dean let out a ragged breath as he tipped his forehead to Cas’, feeling soothed at the implication of his angel's words.
Castiel and April had been married just over a year when Dean had returned from living in New York. Dean remembered how he and Sam and Castiel had been sitting around a table at the back of The Roadhouse, enjoying beer and each other’s company. Castiel hadn’t changed much in the short time Dean had been gone. He still wore the same boxy tan trenchcoat that hid his phenomenal frame, only now, instead of a sweater-vest and jeans, Castiel sported the classic tie and slacks of his English teacher persona (or tax accountant, let’s be real).
“Oh, do tell. Go on,” he gestured with his cup of punch, snickering when Dean covertly splashed a bit of vodka into it from the flask he’d brought.
gesture.
Cas had spent most of the morning at the beach. He’d left Dean’s house early to join Sam and Rowena in Sunrise yoga, something they had tried to no avail to get Dean to participate in. Most recently, during dinner at
“If you are waiting for an apology, you won’t get one. Now tell me why you were talking to Charlie?”
Dean knew that if Castiel helped this woman to the other side, it was the right thing to do. Reuniting a lost, tortured mother with her children? Dean could think of no better reason than that. This wasn't a betrayal.  This was Castiel, and his kind heart, giving someone peace in the only way he knew how. Dean knew that, logically, but all he felt was irrational fury.
When Meg and Charlie went out on to the dance floor, Dean nudged him with his shoulder.
Dean gently rubbed Castiel's shoulder. "Cas? Hey, buddy, wake up for a minute."
Dean caught Cas’ gaze and flashed him a quick grin and even quicker wink before responding to the woman.
“Good morning to you, too, Dean,” Sam said with an eye roll, as he scrubbed some stray jelly from his chin with a napkin from the bumblebee holder Cas had made in the pottery class his mother, Anna, had enrolled him in for his thirty-fifth birthday last year.
(another of his dad’s favorite expressions) with Cas’ dad Chuck while Cas’ mom Becky and Gabriel’s friend, Rowena Macleod, tossed sweatshirts in the trunk of their sedan. Summer had ended and come evening they would be appreciated.
"Fuck," Castiel said, suddenly, as Dean crawled up onto the bed, lounging on his back, one arm tucked behind his head.
Castiel turned in his seat to save the crick in his neck, pouting a little bit when Dean rose.
Alistair grabbed a pill bottle out of his pocket and popped it open one-handed. He shotgunned two pills, swallowing harshly, and Dean wondered what the fuck he'd just taken. "I'll give you two hours, then we're back on the road. And I swear to God, Dean, if you even try to fuck me over, I will kill you. You see, I am not all that worried about leaving your dead body behind. No one's going to shoot at me if they still think you're behind the wheel." It was said flatly, and Dean couldn't help the flash of fear that that was precisely what Alistair planned to do anyway. If that was the case, he hoped Castiel never found his body. Seeing it would break him.
"Maybe, maybe not. Stealing someone else's ride isn't exactly unobtrusive either. Sam," Castiel held out his hand. "Keys? You can take mine until I get back."
“Sorry, man. I should have thought of that. I'll bring you home after breakfast in the morning,” Dean said over a mouthful of cherry pie.
Dean could only glare at him, unimpressed. “You have got to be kidding me,” Dean deadpanned. “No. Not a chance in hell.”
“If the weapon was only visible because she took it off and used it, what good exactly
“Me too. Felt relief that is. That you took me in, that I wouldn’t have to go through with the wedding. You were right, I wouldn’t have been mad at them. I wasn’t angry because they fell in love, or because they broke my heart.  I was hurt because Michael didn’t trust me enough, to be honest. If I had just known. I entered into that engagement because Daphne and I had discussed it. She was very adamant that she was only looking for companionship and I was so convinced that you didn’t have carnal feelings for me, that I was okay with that. Why try and find something more when I only ever wanted you that way?” Castiel took a deep breath of the warm, smoke-tinged air, and searched Dean’s mossy green eyes.  He was humbled when he found only love; no surprise there as Dean and love had been synonymous with each other for what seemed like forever.
“I’m adorable,” Dean countered, tossing the rag he was using on the hood of the car, before he ambled over to Cas, angling for a kiss. Castiel grinned at Dean’s-
“In the kitchen,” he called back, heart skipping just a little bit when Dean came around the corner and leaned on the doorjamb, a Walmart bag in hand and a sheepish look on his face as he smiled at Castiel.
“Cas… are you saying that for the past month, every time I said  I’m going to Lisa’s to do yoga, you thought I meant it as a euphemism for sex?” When Cas only continued to peer at him like an adorably inquisitive bird Dean guffawed loudly and tugged his phone out of his pocket. He opened his browser and found what he was looking for on google. Bringing up the image, he turned his cellphone towards Castiel, noting the blush that climbed up his cheeks with satisfaction.
The words were like a balm on his soul, and the tears started to slip down his cheeks before he could even say, "Heya, Cas."
“Well, first off, there is never any spontaneous in-sync dancing where all of a sudden someone stands in the middle of the floor and we all magically know the moves,” Dean said. “So let go of that dream.”
“Castiel, please. Please try and understand.”
That didn't stop the hard-on he woke up with every morning, spooned next to his husband, or the soundless orgasm he chased in the shower every morning. But it wasn't until Cas had come home early from work after a canceled staff meeting that they had a stupid fight about it.
“Yeah, cause that bitch told the coach I was smoking weed in the out-of-use bathroom by the science wing!”
“Oh, I see. The filter is gone now?” Dean asked, breathlessly and Emmanuel peered at him, head tilted like an inquisitive bird as though having no idea what prompted  Dean’s charming blush.
“What was that?” The concerned tone of Castiel’s voice had Dean meeting his equally concerned gaze.
Castiel knew what Dean was trying to say. He didn’t think he would last until Castiel opened him up and made him ready.
wannabee.
Castiel shook his head no, planning on helping himself to the coffee in the breakroom on his way to sixth period. Fuck knew he needed it.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “Of course you do. C’mon dorks, we’ve got family drama to start!”
Emmanuel nuzzled his cheek in response, the sound of their stubble rasping making him shiver. “That it’s super hot and manly,” Emmanuel deadpanned with a teasing nip to Dean’s earlobe.
Dean wound up with two boutonnieres, each with a pale pink rosebud, with a sprig of baby’s breath.
“Okay, what else?”
"You're the one who promised to bring me home in time to get ready for Church."
A small puff of air brushed his lips when Dean laughed in disbelief.
Castiel’s breath hitched audibly as he studied Dean. Then, Cas smiled; that
Jimmy liked to tease him about how hard Castiel worked to keep in shape while Dean pretty much lived off of bacon and burgers and only had a tiny bit of pudge around his middle to show for it. The rest of Dean Winchester was strong and firm and so perfect he looked photoshopped.
