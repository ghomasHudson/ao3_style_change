“And how many of them did you introduce yourself to using the honorific?” he asked dryly, nodding in grim satisfaction as Watson caught his meaning almost at once. “They know a rogue Prince exists in London, but they do not know
on its way out?"
Holmes peered at him with a dissecting gaze. “What are you up to, brother? It is quite unlike you to facilitate any cooperation between Watson and myself.”
Still, every now and then they had their uses.
Even the circumstances being what they were, he laughed. "It is not modesty, merely the truth. This fearsome countenance is but an act."
She thought hard, the somewhat rusty gears turning slowly in her mind. "Well..." she said after a moment, "He did ask me to stay with the missus a night or two, on account he don't like her bein' alone after dark."
"And the doctor's voice, it is pleasant to listen to?" he prompted, leading her neatly down the path of erroneous conclusion.
With little to guide them, the Yard’s trail soon went cold.
Holmes got to work. The doves were a simple affair, requiring little more than transferring them to a crate and covering it with sackcloth to simulate darkness. After that he cleaned the coop and put down a layer of sawdust and fresh grass and soon the birds were back inside, cooing contentedly and pecking about. The parrot however was another matter, and Holmes came away from the ordeal with several scratches and a new adversary.
Holmes raised an eyebrow. "You are remarkably lively for a corpse."
The only thing that slowed him was the fact he had exactly one good arm with which to move about. He reached toward the creature; mind filled with the vampire's own hunger as the thing lunged at him, held back by its bonds.
"You know I did not arrange for a private room at Saint Thomas', nor come here at your behest simply to disregard you until Christmas. This is a warning, Sherlock. Show some restraint, or I really will drag you home."
But Watson knew nothing of his intentions, and only laughed. “It is hardly of importance now. I am not so attached to material goods as most mortals. In any case, it achieved the goal. The world thinks me dead.”
It was not a concept that bothered him, though he knew it should.
"Thought I'd have but one drink" he agreed, wiping his nose on the corner of his shirt. "Jus’ the one...but I ain't never stopped at one. Didn’t stop this time either. Not 'till I was flat broke again."
Father Newman leaned his head back slightly, appearing deep in thought. "Sherlock Holmes...I remember now, I've seen your name in the paper."
Holmes packed his pipe one handed. "You ought to send out a summons instead."
The elder Holmes glanced at his brother as he entered.
He arrived at the occult shop to find Montressor gone and the same pocky girl from the night before left in charge. She chattered at him in a good natured, empty-headed fashion, informing him that her master had left earlier that morning in great haste, with no word as to where he might be going nor when he would return.
(See the end of the chapter for
For a moment Deighton’s voice grew unbearably gentle. “You poor man. What did Jackson promise you, that you put yourself so completely in his power? Money? Long life?” He shook his head. “Lies, my child. All lies. You will never be free of his dark curse until he is destroyed. Even now, after he has betrayed you, you still keep his secrets. Why? Let us help you; tell us where he sleeps. Confess and the Lord will forgive you, welcome you with open arms.”
Holmes glanced at him. A younger man, but already with a wife and at least two small children at home. He smiled congenially, flawless bedside manner. He'd do well enough for himself in private practice, once age lent him a more distinguished air.
Whatever Holmes had been expecting Jackson to say, it certainly wasn’t that. But he kept his face neutral and gave nothing away. "I'm sorry I cannot be of assistance to you, Doctor. I do hope your situation resolves itself in your favor. Goodnight."
Watson could see why that would be so. To have such a connection with a mortal would be a fatal weakness, and one no doubt eagerly exploited. Assuming, of course, one planned on staying mortal...he looked up at Mycroft, a dim understanding starting to take shape in his mind.
Jackson clenched his jaw for a moment, finally letting go of his ire in a long hissing breath that reminded Holmes of the sea.
to inhale, but he did so anyway. "What-why?”
“I didn’t-” Watson began, but Mycroft ran over the top of his words.
“Come to me!” it growled and Holmes body acted of its own accord, leaning forward slightly as Newman grabbed him by the shoulders, preparing to drag him onto the bed. Behind them Father Deighton murmured a low and fervent prayer.
“No. I must alert your neighbors to the danger, then make haste to Montressor's shop before he finds a way to escape."
"I'm straight as a trivet, old boy."
“Then we should leave,” Watson said, preparing to stand.
“Yes,” Holmes parroted, head bobbing like a drunkard. “My Doctor, yes.”
"I do not think Newman is a priest at all."
Beneath the metal rings, the floor was stained a dark wine color.
Holmes refused to be baited, though he had to admit his brother was as skilled as himself in the art of verbal warfare, on the rare occasion he could be bothered to participate. That he was doing so now spoke eloquently to his agitated mental state, and that meant Holmes would have to take care. There was a delicacy in dealing with his brother right now; he would need to forego the usual banter in favor of a more practical approach. Mycroft was immune to all emotional displays; heartfelt entreaties were received with clinical detachment and did not move him, even those presented by Holmes himself.  But he could be swayed by logic.
The letter opener on Montressor's table had been sharpened to a fine point; punched into the carotid artery by a man of Mister Montressor's build, it would puncture the skin easily enough, and so Kramer died a painful death, bleeding out in a dingy alleyway while Montressor traded away his soul in pursuit of a zealot's justice. But the frame did not work because Watson was not a suspect; the police had not yet found any connection between him and the two dead men. They didn't even know they were supposed to be looking for one. Why then had Montressor not come forward with an anonymous tip, pointing them in the doctor's direction?
Holmes hesitated, and being in his mind Watson felt his trepidation. This was not an aspect of himself he cared to share.
“What is it?” Holmes asked, his scientific mind beginning to churn. “What did you experience?”
Holmes moved, a sudden streak of violence and there wasn’t enough room through the narrow door to strike overhand so he swept down and up, catching Newman between the legs in an area both extremely sensitive and most likely to be remembered.
“I have procured for your examination all the literature we have concerning thrall,” Mycroft answered. “What it truly is, and what vampires use it for."
"Hmmm?" Holmes murmured groggily, awareness slipping as the morphine sank into his blood.
Many of the pages were filled with more insane rambling as the vicar spiraled into true madness, line after line of near indecipherable ramblings about the burden cast upon him: the demon that inhabited his son’s body, and his fervent belief it could be excised with the purified blood of a true repentant. More than once, there was a plea to God to end the boy’s suffering.
Holmes watched the inspector as he went back to his examination of the room, the twisted metal bed frame with its leather straps and silver cuffs, the trail of crimson footsteps Watson had left in a careful path to the door.  He remained silent, letting the inspector draw his own, almost certainly erroneous conclusions.
Holmes harrumphed at him. "If I am not to be noticed it hardly matters." But he did up the buttons anyway. Well, some of them.
No, the task by default fell to Watson, and Mycroft was wise enough to know it.
"I dare say you shall walk again. Not that I had any serious doubt; I would not allow such an injury to cripple you when it is in my power to prevent it.” He covered the wounds over again, satisfied. “How is the pain?” he asked, and Holmes twitched out a familiar shrug.
“I haven’t told you a number of things,” he replied honestly, “nor do I intend to at the moment. There is far too much to do and very little time to do it; it benefits nothing to stand about chin-wagging. Come now, take this blood, pour it about your surgery downstairs.”
It was a long time before Mycroft spoke. "Very well," he said at last, and Holmes felt himself deflate in a long slow sigh of relief as Watson's iron grip on his arm eased slightly; it had not been tight enough to hurt, but it had been immovable.
Jackson sighed, a startlingly human gesture. "What proof can I offer that my words are true?"
“What do you mean, ‘compulsion or necessity’? Compulsion I understand well enough, but what is there of necessity to these crimes?”
"You needn't involve yourself any further than telling me what happened to frighten you so."
kind of poison! Poison of the soul, of the mind and heart! Of body too, yes - but this poison does not allow the dead to stay where they belong!"
Behind him Newman stumbled in, still hunched over and hobbling. Dimly Holmes saw him raise the shillelagh but Deighton stopped him with a withered hand on his arm.
"He certainly is. As for the sire's crest I mentioned before; with two snakes, entwined around a castle. Do you know of it?"
It was a startling dichotomy that was perfectly illustrated by the tall, grey-suited gentleman who currently wandered through the rougher parts of town, and the sharp-eyed miscreant that stalked him like an oily shadow.
Trigger warnings: umm...zombie fungus?
Perhaps it had been dangerous, to let himself care so much for Stamford.
"It hardly makes a difference, I have more in the flat," Holmes replied without a hint of shame.
"I believe he worked in a shop."
“Thank you,” said the stranger with a formal nod, “I know the hour is unusual, but the matter is quite urgent.” He removed his hat to reveal blond hair as carefully groomed as the rest of him.
“The you recall only half the conversation. The promise, Doctor, was that you never use your powers to influence my mind without my permission. In this instance, you have it.”
Holmes didn’t answer.
Holmes blinked at him, mildly surprised and distantly disappointed. "Lay down?"
Holmes calmed, and after a moment looked vaguely around, eyes glassy and unfocused. "The vicar?" he asked, mind already turned to the case, even damaged as he was.
Watson kept talking, voice steady and professional. The monster had been stowed carefully away, and tonight he was only John Watson, healer of the sick. "Your brother is very... perceptive. As much as you, it seems."
"There are many theories, some of them more religious than others," Watson said, setting the tea tray down on the table next to Holmes. He took a seat and glanced at his hand, seeming unbothered. "Some think the sun is God's eye, and exposure to it destroys us because we are tools of the devil."
It was well into the afternoon by the time Lestrade's man came by with the letters. Sergeant Clark was a solid, dependable sort of man, slightly more competent than the average London peeler (though that was faint praise indeed) and Holmes was inclined to think as well of him as he did any of the Scotland Yard constabulary. Which was to say, marginally. That and the fact Clark seemed less bothered by Holmes' eccentricities than most meant it was nearly always he Lestrade sent to Baker Street on police business, making Clark Holmes' unofficial liaison to the Yard.
"Believe it or not, Watson, I am considered a shrewd judge of character, and I judge yours to be sound. I cannot say the same for any others of your kind we might meet with."
“Allowed?” Mycroft repeated dryly with a lift of his heavy brow.
"Because I have just been removed from the Yard's official investigation of Michael Kramer - that's our corpulent alleyway victim, by the way," Holmes replied smoothly. "As a concerned citizen, surely you do not wish to see such a heinous crime go unpunished, and as you are a reasonable individual you must know the Yard will bungle the investigation hopelessly. Furthermore, as you are already my client in another case and I believe the two to be intimately related, it is in your best interest to hire me to investigate them both." He finished and waited expectantly, and the corner of Watson's mouth curved up in a slight smile. His eyes were twinkling again, but Holmes didn't let himself think about that.
Mycroft glanced at him in an offhand manner. “You do seem somewhat improved,” he admitted grudgingly.
“You are
“I am sorry,” he said, because Stamford wasn’t there to say it himself.
“A few,” Mycroft admitted. “Though not so comprehensive a collection as parliament.”
"A little," he answered, reaching past her for a bit of toast. "I don't imagine I shall be about much today- is that the paper? Excellent." He snatched it up.
“You are lucky it is not longer," he replied crisply. "The blood I gave you in the hospital has accelerated the healing.”
“You were in my mind,” Holmes reminded him patiently. “There could be no misunderstanding. I knew what you did not want me to do, and I did it anyway, and was successful. If you gave me an order right now, I could refuse if I desired.”
"I would have, had you smelled like yourself," he snorted.
"I believe he is lying," Mycroft answered, "but there is enough doubt that I am willing to proceed with a certain amount of caution.  I have sent out for information from other societies such as ours; they exist in one form or another in nearly every country in the world. I am taking no risk with regards to you. We will solve this mystery together and free you."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course I do not trust you," Mycroft rumbled at him, following the direction of his thoughts. "How could I, being what you are? At least here, you will be properly looked after." They stopped at last in front of a set of heavy wood doors, the now familiar symbols of a protective ward carved into the polished wood.
drinking her blood! She wanted to go
"Yes, precisely..." he sighed deeply. "We have no time, it shall have to be tonight. Before midnight, yes?" He glanced at his pocket watch. "We should go now. I don’t like the idea of putting it off."
She took a shaky step towards him, shaking her head in disbelief with her hands clenched into fists at her sides.
"Yes well, vampires usually are," Jackson replied with a shallow grin.
Holmes kept his face clean of all artifice. "If I did not have evidence, I would not have called on you."
"Perhaps," he said softly. Then he kissed Holmes again on his ear, licking along the ridges and pulling the lobe into his mouth. Holmes' knees went weak and he grabbed onto Watson's jacket in an effort to keep his feet, but Watson held him up with one arm as though he weighed nothing more than a babe.
“Higher than God?” Holmes queried and Newman answered, “Yes.” Then he smiled; an empty, cold thing that didn’t reach his deadened eyes.
“Decently, for a beginner. Had he not thrown himself into fugue I think we would have made progress.”
“But did you really suspect nothing?” he asked curiously. It seemed unlikely Stamford could have kept up a similar charade with Holmes of all people. Certainly not while living with the man.
Sturgerson offered a wry smile. “Then I’ll be very glad to
you have anything to tell me? Or am I wasting even more time while a murderer prowls the city?"
Jackson smiled coldly, regarding him from head to toe. "You're far more afraid of that possibility than you let on," he challenged.
“I know my brother. If he wanted to kill you tonight, he would have by now.”
Holmes let out a hiss of air from between his teeth and sprinted across the street, managing to reach the door just as Montressor was making to lock it. "A moment, sir!" he called in high, nervous tenor, wedging his foot in the door. Montressor reared back in surprise, his face a jumble of confusion and fear.
He was still in deep contemplation as he finally succeeded in hailing a cab, dapple-flanked horses pulling up beside him with the steam pouring from their mouths. He gave the address by rote, the driver responding with a quick jerk of his head and a sharp crack of leather reigns. Holmes senses were keen but he was still human, bound by human limitations and the driver spared no attention for anything not directly in his path; thus neither of them noticed the dark figure that watched them from the shadows.
Holmes was, at least, living up to Stamford's description of him as "the queerest pile of contradictions God ever breathed life into." Both irascible and conscientious, brilliant and unhinged, the breeding of a gentleman and the manners of a bohemian...moral, but eschewing all trappings of conventional propriety. The man who had both loved Stamford and left him to die.
Trigger warnings: none
"Until now your danger has been from your own kind. Now the night will be as dangerous as the day. He
It was as though someone had set off fireworks inside his brain, a brilliant display of dizzying color and he was pushed out of the quiet space of the library, swept away as Holmes opened the floodgates and both their minds became awash in sensory data, sight and smell and sound all blending together in a cacophonic roar.  As the tidal wave rolled over him, Watson broke and retreated from Holmes’ mind, back into his own.
"And what evidence draws you to this conclusion?" Watson asked, full of questions. He wanted to know everything Holmes knew. He wanted to be a part of this thing, whatever it was. Wanted to be on equal footing with the detective; something more than just another hapless client. He was unused to knowing less than someone else, and it bothered him. And somewhere, deep down, he wanted to prove himself to Holmes.
Seeing that Holmes would not be dissuaded and all other avenues barred Watson sighed, stood and took the few steps to Holmes’ chair, placing his hand atop the detective’s head...
"Knee, shoulder, head in... roughly that order, I think. Is there water?" he asked suddenly, and Watson felt rather foolish to have not thought of that himself.
“Be silent!” Mycroft snapped, and Watson’s spine stiffened, eyes turning a stormy grey.
Watson huffed, unsatisfied. “So, you do not trust me with your secrets,” he concluded, “only your life.” But even as he said it he understood it to be an affliction that plagued them both.
"I don't know," Watson admitted with a helpless shrug, "It does not seem to be anything like what I have heard, I can say that much."
"A message in a bottle, hidden in a wall?"
"I don't need to feed," he replied, voice eerily calm, his arms like iron bands around Holmes’ back, holding his slacking body up like a scaffold. "It's not about that."
"Ah!" he said with satisfaction, sounding happier than Watson had yet heard.
"Awake already?" Deighton said with surprise and no small amount of fear. "But-"
idiot!" he thundered, opening the door and shoving the lad through with the command of "Stay there, Sturgerson will come for you." He turned back to Holmes, his face hard as granite and white with rage.
"What reaction could she make? He had enchanted her, bewitched her! I've looked at her arm – there's only one mark, not two."
He left, and did not turn to gauge the man's reaction.
"More so," Holmes corrected. "If he did not know you were upstairs, I would be very much surprised."
“And what does that tell you?" he asked impatiently, "I need answers, Holmes. My constables are acting like a barn full of horses when there's smoke."

“It’s dressed already,” Watson called back as he went to retrieve it, and Holmes gave a hum of approval.
Watson rolled his eyes, there was nothing else to be done. “Oh, undoubtedly. And did it not occur to you that
The dark mutterings died down as each man grudgingly accepted Mycroft’s reasoning, because when Mycroft deigned to speak only a fool would dismiss the words, and Mycroft Holmes did not employ foolish men.
"Do you think he suspects what I am?"
As if Holmes would concede now, at the denouement of the game. "I had suspected as much. Insane men often see their madness reflected in the world around them. You didn't really think he was a vampire, did you?"
It was late evening by the time his brother arrived. Mycroft Holmes was a tall, ponderous gentleman with thick features and an obviously surfeit appetite. But despite their differences in size, the similarities were striking if one looked below the surface, past the layers of idleness and fat. Mycroft Holmes had the same nose as his brother, the same mouth and chin...and the same eyes; every inch as piercing and calculating as the detectives’ own.
“Don’t go in,” he rasped, voice rough and grizzled from years of too much drink. “Ain’t no God in
Mycroft paused. "That is true enough, as long as you do not drink any more of his blood in the meantime. I do not currently plan to kill him, because I think he might be more useful alive...for the moment."
Holmes made a rumble in the back of his throat. “I do not intend to explain it at all.”
"I don't generally enjoy watching people hang. I might make an exception for you."
“What’d he want him dead for?”
Lestrade blanched, nose wrinkling in disgust. "Good Lord. What monster could do that to his own son!?"
"I killed him,” Watson said plainly and without remorse. “Along with his friend Newman and that- creature." He could hardly call it a vampire.
Watson had sat listening quietly, absorbing Holmes’ words. “There must be
But Holmes did not recruit unobservant children, and Georgie turned quickly to look at him, a question in his eyes. "Mr. Holmes? Are you alrih' sir?"
“And yet I feel reborn.”
“It chronicles the history of the Irish clans back to the days of Richard Strongbow,” Mycroft told him.  “Included within are copies of any heraldic crests that could be identified, both legitimate and otherwise.”
"No.”
"Are you implying they're afraid of me?" It seemed unlikely. He was no one, a clanless vampire without status or bloodline. He didn't even have thralls.
And here they were, the consequences of his actions.
"A doctor stopped by a few days ago," she said, thrusting the letter at him. "He left this for you. Where have you even
"I rarely sleep while on a case," Holmes said dismissively. "In any event, there is the business of the garret window. There are shutters of course but I mean to board it as well. There is some lumber in the coal shed..." And then, his mind desperate for something to occupy it, he became distracted by an experiment that had been percolating on the table for the last week and a half; engrossed enough he did not hear Watson either leave or return again.
There were many things woven into the look Holmes shot him. It was a fatal flaw of the doctor's that he had pretended to be less clever than he was for so long now he had started to believe it of himself. It was a bad habit, but Holmes was confident in his ability to shake him free of it. “I asked you once to tell me all you knew of vampiric society. You did not, and the results are now upon us. I will ask you again. This time, do not deceive me.”
"Any human loses patience when hungry or tired," he replied, hands curled into a fist at his sides. Holmes was sporting with him, he had to be. Watson was not some- some
Sometime later Lestrade walked in, looking unusually pensive. "I'm glad you're awake," he said, and did indeed sound relieved.
After a heavy pause Holmes said softly, “Perhaps he intended to.”
A slight smile touched his lips. “I had only known him for three.”
“Very good, Watson. That tells us he was certainly the sire’s thrall.”
"An immolated corpse that left the bed sheets unburnt?" He shook his head again. “No doctor, that is not good enough. We-” but whatever he was going to say next was lost in a spasm of pain.
"If you let me into his flat so that I may examine it, yes."
Holmes harrumphed at him as he left and didn’t sleep that night, which was unfortunate. Instead he spent a good deal of time thinking about the past, which was also unfortunate. Such morose thoughts tended to have a damaging effect on his psyche.
Watson sighed. It was hopeless, because Holmes had a damn good point. He could not defend himself from them either physically or mentally, and Watson could not aid him during the day. And if he was unwilling, well...the fact this might be necessary at all was directly Watson's fault. Still...
reckless; he simply cared too damn much to take heed of his own welfare.
A sound like distant thunder reverberated from deep within Mycroft’s chest. "If you believe I did not trouble myself, you are a larger idiot than I thought."
(Yes, the pear thing is indeed a direct reference to Dr. Who.  We apologize for nothing.)
"Confess, Mister Holmes. Or there will only be more pain.”
He bent to pick one up, the words ‘Ancient Alchemy’ printed in gold across the blood red leather. He glanced at the other books, unsurprised to find most of them relating to various religions, myths and the occult. On a rosewood table from the Indian region of Bengal stood a metal bowl surrounded by the same strange chalk pattern he had observed in the alleyway. Inside were the remains of burnt sage and cedar, the scent strong enough it had not yet faded from the room.
Is that what he is? No- no a monster! He is too dangerous...I want nothing else to do with it!"
“With the accelerant used? Most certainly.” It should not, however, be long enough for the fire to spread too far. He didn't go over the calculations again because there was no point; the thing was done. If he'd made an error, he'd know it soon enough.
It was like shaking hands with a corpse (and corpses were a subject Holmes had some experience with). The skin was marble smooth, strangely hard, and very cold. Jackson wrapped his hand around Holmes' and there was no give to the muscle, no pliancy to his skin.  Holmes had the thought that Jackson could break his hand with extraordinary ease if he wished to.
That man happened to be Father Newman.
Watson's brows arched high upon his forehead. "An interesting charge. What makes you say so?"
Holmes contemplated that. "Why do you suppose sunlight is so destructive to your kind?" he mused.
Watson glanced at him irritably, in no humor for Holmes’ verbal chicanery. “What?”
The skin where the silver touched had turned black, cracked like dried mud.
Holmes had paid the final words no heed, long used to his brother's brusque manner. “Well, that went better than I had feared. I do believe he's warming up to you."
Watson excused himself wordlessly, heading upstairs to check the security of the garret room and turning the endearment over in his mind, trying to decide whether or not it left a bitter taste in his mouth to know it had not meant for him. Upstairs he spent some time studying the windows, testing the room for light leaks but Holmes, it seemed, had been as good as his word; the boards were secure. The room would remain in total darkness even at the sun’s zenith. But despite all this Watson was not entirely comforted; during the torpor of day sleep he was wholly unaware and impossible to rouse. If Holmes wished him dead all he would have to do is enter his room and pry the boards off the windows. Watson would burn to death in the sunlight without ever having even a chance to defend himself.
"I don't consider you mad, but even if you were, that's hardly a bad thing," Watson offered softly.
"It is a common weakness among the less fortunate," Holmes agreed. "But if he were headed to the bottle, he would have taken money as well."
Holmes sniffed. "You should tell your constables to conduct themselves with better decorum, murder is hardly rare. I am confident that the murderer was known to the victim; that narrows our list of suspects quite substantially."
“No defensive wounds,” Holmes observed, bending down to peer at one long, white arm, “he was either caught by surprise, or - more likely - knew his attacker. What were the contents of his stomach?”
"I'm sorry," Watson blurted out, "I'm so sorry, Holmes. I didn't know- I had no idea it would be so- from the few vampires I spoke with, they never mentioned anything like this. They treated thralls as tools, or pets..."
Holmes interrupted them both. "Whether it is my will or not, I will allow no harm to come to him. You will have to either kill me or incapacitate me first."
Holmes shrugged the comment off. “It was not luck at all; my survival was due entirely to the good doctor’s efforts. It was he who killed both Deighton and Newman, and dispatched the pathetic creature that had once been the vicar’s son.”
"Damn" he muttered, pushing himself away from the desk. He nibbled a piece of cold toast and drank the now (very) cold tea. Maybe thrall had been a mistake. He couldn't work like this.
. But you've framed him and the Yard hangs on your every word, Sherlock Holmes," she said, spitting his name like a curse. "You're in bed with the devil."
“He knows by now I have disappeared from Baker Street,” Holmes added, “and you have not been seen for at least as long. It is possible he may assume you killed and drained me as many vampires are wont to do with thralls who have outlived their usefulness, but if I were so disposable, why come to my aid at the church? A less considerate monster would have simply let me die, and found another thrall to do their bidding.”
Watson had only just risen, still shaking the stiffness of torpor from his limbs as he came downstairs with Holmes’ name on his lips, a perfidious sort of happiness trying to wedge itself inside him at the thought of having someone to wake up to. He crushed the feeling down and thrust it aside. This wasn’t a permanent arrangement, after all. Holmes had been quite clear on that point.
"What - what should I do, then? I want no more bloodshed, Montressor is only trying to protect his wife."
Holmes found himself uncharacteristically at a loss for words. "I came to check on you," he said a bit helplessly.
His sweet, gentle boy. A slayer working for the Diogenes, for
"Watch them," he said flatly. “If that creature tries to feed from my brother, kill it.” He left, and Sturgerson pulled out a small revolver no doubt loaded with silver bullets, setting it well within Watson’s line of sight and easily within reach, should it be required. Sturgerson was perhaps more willing than other slayers to give the benefit of doubt in Watson’s favor, but he was still Diogenes, and he would still not hesitate to shoot Watson through the heart if he deemed it necessary.
The moment stretched on, tense and unforgiving, the air filled with an energy so palpable the room nearly vibrated with it though each man remained motionless, trapped together in this strange drama like characters from a renaissance painting.
"A parrot?" he repeated dumbly, because while he had indeed glimpsed into that raging maelstrom of thought, it had not bestowed upon him any enhanced powers of understanding. It had been no more than a glance anyway; any longer and he'd risked being pulled in, pulled under and drowned in the constant flood of sensory data that poured into Holmes' mind from every direction and battered him ceaselessly. Every scent, every noise, every glance was a full-on assault. Each trickle of information became a stream of data the required processing and cataloging, each stream running on until it met up with others, became great flowing tributaries of information, vast rivers of knowledge all rushing into the immense sea of his memory.
Trigger warning for: dead bodies, blood
"We do not know how we will feel in two weeks, but for now, he could not convince me of anything else. And what choice I make when the thrall lifts will be entirely my own."
"I do not know, that is why you should look into it."
"Adultery,
She wrinkled her nose in distaste as she inspected him, head to toe. "You'd best not smell like a sewer by the time I come up. Go take a bath."
A bit later Mrs. Hudson came up the steps with tea, finding him with the letters spread out before him like a jigsaw puzzle. He'd been staring at them for well over an hour but found it devilishly hard to concentrate. Watson haunted all his thoughts, the dark space behind his eyes filled with bone white hands and golden smiles tinged in blood.
helpful to have known."
His brother’s face darkened again. They’d had that argument too, in times past. Quite often in fact.

Watson moved at once, retrieving both syringe and an unmarked vial of clear liquid.
“I don’t know
She nods. "Yes, of course.  Watched them wander around just like you."
"A number of small observations. For example, he does not attend Sunday Mass, and he misquotes his scriptures." At Watson's questioning look Holmes tilted his head back and recited, "'But if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.' John. 1:7; Newman got it wrong."
Holmes nodded absently, his eyes still on the wall. He wondered if there had been a better way, something he should have done differently...the pain on Mrs. Montressor's face gnawed at him, even though her husband
"What?" Mycroft said, blinking. "Say that again... you're his thrall, his tool. He doesn't think of you as anything other than a puppet to be used and discarded at his leisure."
Langley end up on the church roof?"
“I seem to recall you making me promise quite faithfully that I would never use my power to influence your mind.”
“The story you gave Lestrade was a plausible one,” Mycroft rumbled, “but knowing the creature for what it was, I could not account for your having survived the encounter. If you were alive, it could only have been through very good luck. And you know I do not believe in luck, brother.”
A brief glance around the flat revealed the detective was not at home. Watson was not unduly concerned. Holmes’ schedule was as eccentric as the man himself; heaven only knew where he had gone, what mischief he had involved himself in during the long hours Watson was obliged to remain insensible.
"Mr. Holmes? How are you feeling?"
“You have one more chance, Mister Holmes,” Deighton said. “Only one. Confess, and spare yourself any more torment. I think you are due a rest.”
, Watson was at risk. If he let Montressor escape, not only would they possibly not find him again but it put his plan in jeopardy...and Watson was still at risk. Montressor could not be turned over to the law until "Doctor Jackson" was safely out of the way.
Holmes closed is eyes against another onslaught of guilt as the officer wrestled Montressor back under control. "I will stay with the lady," he said, his voice rough. "Until a neighbor can be found to come to her aid."
Holmes looked back at him with genuine curiosity, “Why would you care?” and Watson answered instantly, “Because Stamford cared.”
“The madman? Another beggar, surely.”
"If he is to remain in the city, one might wonder how he plans to make a living."
“You could go somewhere for a few weeks, hide-”
"Damn. You rarely fail," Lestrade said, surprised. "I'm sorry."
Holmes moved closer, conspiratorial curve to his face. "She chose
At least Stamford would have had the presence of mind to find out where Kramer
“But he did not report me to the Diogenes.”
A crease appeared between Watson’s brow, and he frowned. “Stand. Up,” he said again, putting more of his Will into the command, making it an Order.
"No, I would not be able to see you here. However, it may be for the best. Certainly, I can stay here by day, and be protected from any thrall that enters the city. By night, I-" he hesitated.
Then again, nothing ever was.
Watson snorted softly. "That hardly fills with me with comfort."
"I did," he replied, and from his shoulder-bag he pulled a thick, bound volume. "These appear to be the vicar's notes. He was meticulously organized when it came to his son’s feeding schedule.” His nose wrinkled faintly in disgust. “I did not read much of it, just enough to realize it was significant."
“Then what is he?” Mycroft asked, and Watson did not need to hesitate over the answer.
“That fits with the timeline of events so far. It has been three months since indigents began disappearing off the streets around the church.”
"Most interesting,” Holmes replied with casual disinterest. “I have been considering your condition, would you like to know my hypothesis?"
Watson found himself reaching for Holmes, wanting to offer comfort...but what comfort was to be had from the cold, dead hands of a vampire? “I could go to the Yard-” he began, but Holmes cut him off.
His concentration was in tatters, thoughts scattered like seed and more than once he caught himself on the verge of dozing off. Ridiculous, dangerous and lazy. What the hell was wrong with him? He had a case that was swiftly moving to a pivotal point. He had slept for hours the night before, and again that morning. He had no excuse to be drifting off while at watch. Lives were at stake.
"One of the services I offer as a doctor is bloodletting," Watson said in way of an explanation. "I don't need to pick out a random human from the crowd; they come to me."
"Will they now." Another small, odd smile crossed Watson's face. He examined the items carefully. “Occult, from the look of them.”
Watson hummed thoughtfully. "It is an interesting plan. However, you will not be of much use tonight." The kettle whistled and Watson took it off the fire, filling the teapot and releasing a heavy herbal scent to waft through the room. Watson prepared a cup, handing it over with a congenial smile. "Drink this," he instructed, "it's a mixture of my own creation. The ingredients all bolster the production of blood and warm the body. You'll need two full cups to replenish what was lost, though even then you will be weak for some time yet. You are welcome to rest here for the night."
Watson snorted at the cryptic phrasing. "I wonder what way he would have in mind. One that does not involve you?"
Mycroft's voice deepened as his concern grew. "You should be wary. This is not one of your trifling mysteries, Sherlock. It is an ancient evil from before the dawn of civilization; countless men have lost their lives to it. We have safe rooms here, and wards they cannot cross. Now we know they are coming, we shall stand watch at night. You will find no safer place in London than here. No one could bother you, not even that doctor."
"I'm sorry," he said, and started backing away, letting go of Holmes just enough so he could walk, but keeping his hand on his arm as he herded them towards the door, his eyes on Mycroft.
“You will serve him too, in your own way. Just like this fellow...” he kicked the chained man, but there was no reaction. Newman looked down in mild curiosity, knotting his fingers in the stranger’s hair and lifting his head to peer at him. "Tch. Dead already? Such a shame; he is no use to us dead."
Watson gave a small laugh. “That is the point of the exercise, Holmes. You have far more dominion over your mind than I do; I can read the words but you are the author. So, take up your pen and edit your thoughts. Keep them from me if you can.”
Mycroft could be a very dangerous man when he wished to be; Holmes would have to be careful.
Holmes nodded, still weeping pitifully.
"There is a question in all of this, though," Watson said. "How am I to feed? I'll no longer have a practice."
"We hope," Watson muttered, but what else was to be done? He owed Holmes dearly. The least he could do was let the detective have his way. He did as he was instructed, collecting both bandages and bedsheet on his way out. At the door he turned back. Holmes had his eyes closed again, and Watson did not want to leave him. "Try not to die," he said, the words sounding far more sincere than he would have liked.
Mycroft entered the room and stared hard at his brother, no sign that either affection or worry for the younger Holmes had ever touched his heart.
Holmes looked unhappy, quarrelsome furrow along his brow. “That long?”
what happens to you? You are nothing to him; he can make another."
"If there can be no truce then I will not stay here."
He got hit again, this time on his injured leg and he cried out, pain blooming sharp and hot as a poker. He twisted against the iron shackles, nerves afire, grinding his teeth together and forcing himself to breathe through the pain as sweat beaded on his forehead.
“At around nine o’ clock.”
"You shouldn't let me sleep so long," he complained with his back to Watson.
"Thank you for your patience, Father. I can now say I am more certain than ever that Mister Blevins met with an unfortunate end. This is a good church, your employees are satisfied, your wages fair. You gave Mister Blevins food and shelter, and from all appearances he was grateful for the work. Why would such a man disappear into the night, leaving both money and coat behind, with no word to anyone? Something is not right."
Holmes had to be careful here. Lestrade was not a smart man, but he was tenacious, making the rank of Inspector through his sheer refusal to give up a case, regardless of how outclassed he might be intellectually. He would not easily give up looking for a 'madman' who did not exist.
"No ordinary man can survive in such a way," Watson said without thinking, and it was both a compliment and an admonishment.
Lestrade shrugged. “Might have had a tool with him. Might think he
wandering helpless and devoid of reason.
“For the banishment of evil, and protection from harm. I believe he was attempting a protective ritual, before he was attacked.”
nothing.” He sighed deeply and sank down, cantankerous set to the line of his mouth.
Ah. “I-” he searched, and found he had no good answer. What could he say in his defense? That he had forgotten? That he hadn’t thought it a necessary detail? That Holmes was too- too
“You must understand,” Holmes began, “I have only ever taken one man into my confidence. I was not yet ready to do so again.”
"If things are as dangerous as I think, it will be a relief. I have reason to believe they are far worse." He stood, tipping his cap to Watson. "Should you need to send me word you will find several urchin children within easy sight of your surgery. Call upon any one of them; they will find me."
"Is there no sin you'd like to confess to?"
He stood unsteadily, room swaying like the bow of a great ship and he anchored himself against the wall for a moment before wrenching open the door with a bleary-eyed grunt.
"I have uncovered many truths in the course of my work that have remained hidden for the greater good," Holmes responded, the words thick with irony.
At least nothing they had done had been on the list...
The streets were dark and fog filled, lamps creating capsules of amber colored light within the brume. There were very few hansoms about this time of night and thus Holmes was obliged to walk quite far before finding a cab willing to convey him the rest of the way.
"Gregson informs me the fire department is on its way to retrieve the body. They can surely wait the span of a minute or five."
Holmes’ feelings for him had not changed. Watson
“A man who can twist metal bed frames and bash in skulls with his bare hands must be strong as an ox. Such a man might have little trouble in dragging a body to the top of a church roof.”
"I'm sure there are many who would marvel upon their first meeting a vampire as well... before they saw the fangs, and considered the perils of closer acquaintance."
Sorry to have missed the weekly update. In our defense, one half of the team is busy with Uni and the other half was busy trying to weather spring break with an overactive six year old attached to their leg.
"True, but it seems the usual practice is in fact to nurture their young rather than abandon them," he said wryly.
on them, a representation of stores of knowledge used less regularly than others.
of Holmes, but no more. Ideally they would share blood, but that was an impossibility. Mycroft would never allow it, and it would only extend Holmes’ stay in this place.
clearly think it was. For shame, brother. I am disappointed he has controlled you so easily." He lumbered over to the table and poured himself a drink. “Speaking of which, get up. We both know you aren’t injured anymore.”
Holmes bent over the letters once more, Watson's presence steadying his mind. That spoke abysmally of his concentration in the daylight hours, but things were as they were.
“Calm down, all of you calm down,” he said, and pointed to the eldest boy. “You there, tell me what has happened. The rest of you be quiet.”
Jackson’s eyes narrowed. "I expect you to find evidence that this man is indeed out for my life. I do not care if you agree with his motivations. But if it eases your conscience, I haven't killed while feeding in half a century."
Holmes observed her openly and without shame, concluding she must be a great beauty by the standards of the day - if one were inclined to notice such things.
trigger warnings: none
together by now. “What facts do you have?”
"Indeed, sir," he replied, striding forward and setting a wrapped paper envelope upon the table where it would be within easy reach. "Inspector Lestrade bids me to remind you to be careful with them; they are very delicate." Clark was too much ruled by propriety to say anything against his superior, but Holmes could tell by the faint cadence of his voice how unnecessary he considered that particular warning. It was one of the lesser injustices of the world that Clark would likely never make Inspector himself, despite having a quicker mind than most of the men who held the title. His social status and Irish ancestry were both against him, and those counted for far more in the world than intelligence and acumen. A shame, really, but only one such shame in a thousand, and nothing to be done about it anyway so Holmes didn't spare a great deal of attention ruminating on it.
The cellar appeared in all respects an ordinary space, filled with the customary items such as coal, firewood and extra provisions. Holmes grabbed up a convenient candle from the stack at the bottom of the stair and set it alight, sending thick shadows shifting over the cold stone walls.
He braced his hands on the slick tiles and hauled himself up the last few feet onto the roof, leaving the ladder behind. Below him the firemen bellowed in dismay, cursing him for a madman while the crowd gasped in horrified delight. They might yet see a man fall to his death this morning, how thrilling!
Holmes nodded, reaching up to squeeze Watson's hand. "When the thrall lifts, you may not feel so strongly towards me," he pointed out.
“That is rather a lot,” he remarked a bit disapprovingly.
"I am not a museum specimen," Jackson said with a huff, though he didn’t pull his hand away. “And yes, I must drink blood regularly. I won't die without, not for months- possibly years - but the hunger becomes overwhelming. That can be quite dangerous, and I prefer to keep such urges in check. As for everything else, there is nothing. Just blood. I cannot eat food or drink."
“Yes. I- have tried to live as the man I was as much as possible.”
“Your brother? Is that wise?”
“He never mentioned you,” Holmes mused. “I wonder why?”
“If you do not believe it, then why ask me here?”
“The world of the vampirium contains many secrets,” he began. “Indeed, vampires are such bloodthirsty, treacherous and duplicitous creatures that secrecy is a simple matter of survival. No vampire reaches an advanced age who is not skilled in the art of keeping his own council...nor in discovering the weaknesses of others. It is therefore understood that any weakness which may be leveraged against one or even all vampires would be deeply buried indeed. It is that secret you seem to have so unwittingly discovered, and it is one that leaves yourselves, this coven and my personage in something of a predicament.”
Darkness came to claim him, and he fell willingly into it's embrace...
as always questions, comments and constructive criticism are always welcome.
Watson bent down and put his fingers against Montressor's temple. After a moment the man's face turned to a grimace of fear and pain and he whimpered pitifully, twisting on the ground.
"You handled the Blackwood case excellently," Jackson remarked, stretching long arms over his head. "Your refusal to believe in his magic tricks saved parliament." He leaned back in the armchair and for a moment Holmes was struck by an inexplicable feeling of danger; the same kind felt by a doe a split second before it locked eyes with a hungry wolf. "You had a partner then, didn't you? A shame. I read his obituary. Explosion at the docks..."
"I do hope you have removed any personal artifacts you wish to be spared from the flames," he said without preamble.
“But even the damnedest of lies have a foundation of truth, however deep one must dig to find it. Tell me brother, in your studies, what did you learn of psychics and the art of mentalism?”
He waited until he heard her leave again, her scent fading from the room then stepped away from the wall, coming back to Holmes' side and noting the detective’s eyes had already gone soft and unfocused from the drug. He felt a pang of something that might have been jealousy that someone else was caring for Holmes, easing his pain and making him whole and that - oh that was a dangerous, dangerous feeling and he tried to lock it away.
A line appeared between Watson's brows as he considered. "I can influence them to a degree," he said. "I make my patients forget what I do to them."
Diogenes,” Holmes said aloud, confirming what until now had only been speculation. The man’s interest in the occult, his knowledge of wards and spells and the sudden appearance of the burgundy waistcoated man all pointed to the fact the Montressor – most likely unwittingly – had killed a member of Mycroft’s inner circle.  He wondered how many other such agents he was going to meet with...probably quite a few, if he were to continue keeping company with a vampire.
“What do you usually do, when you are without a case?” Watson asked.
He held Watson's eyes with a gaze sharp as carpet tack. "And I ask again: what would you have me do? You already know who is after you; how am I to act upon that information?"
"Coercion is not 'willing'," Holmes replied scathingly. "Hurt a man enough, he will beg for death. But no one tortured into a thing does so voluntarily."
Lestrade stared at him, shocked to his core and thoroughly disconcerted, confusion and disbelief at war on his bushy face. “You’re tellin’ me a man of God did that to you?”
Sturgerson looked like he wanted to argue, but didn’t. The elder Holmes gave him a quick, searching look and seemed to soften very slightly. He then continued in a gentler tone, “In any case, it is best not to encourage them. It may be that the problem solves itself in another week.”
"We are well prepared and protected. We have wards and guards; no vampire can penetrate these walls.” He paused, and for a moment Holmes thought Mycroft might go so far as to try and reach for him. But his hands stayed by his sides, and he said only, “Try to sleep now, brother."
"What reason could there possibly be? Deighton and Newman both had their heads smashed in, and you nearly joined ‘em. It's a bloody wonder you're not dead yourself.”
“All indigents, yes?”
Holmes’ chest was heaving, and he stared at Watson with eyes fogged by desire. “Yes...Master,” he breathed, because nowhere on the list did Holmes tell Watson not to let him use the title. Such a thing wouldn’t have occurred to either of them. It was a shock of cold water on Watson’s fevered mind and he pulled back, flinching as if the word had been a physical blow against his skin. Something about it felt
From the other side of the room a door opened, and a thin, blonde woman poked her head out. "James... it's alright dear. I want to speak with him."
“Of course I do. Doctor Jackson is dead and he must stay that way. Two other men have just died and there must be an explanation. I am injured and there must be an explanation for that as well. In none of these explanations is there room for you. Ergo, if you do not wish the torching of your house and practice to have been in vain, you will follow my instructions precisely.”
Watson agreed instantly. "Of course."
Holmes winced. "
“Aye?”
"Unlikely, but prudent all the same; thank you. Has my brother been contacted?"
The words sent Holmes into a fresh bout of tears.
Holmes' smile was a forgery, smooth and transparent. "Allow me to elucidate then. Nelson Langley made his living chiefly as a hired gun; a bounty hunter and - on occasion - a mercenary. Not entirely a legal profession, and certainly one that might incur a good deal of 'enmity'."
He decided to let Holmes sleep until just before dawn; Watson's own senses could tell him morning was hailing even if he were under a hundred feet of stone. But it was Holmes, so naturally he woke on his own an hour or so before sunrise.
Given all circumstances, it was perhaps not so surprising that – however unconsciously done – Holmes had ended up choosing for his companion a psychic, and one skilled in the art of mentalism. In fact, Watson concluded it was very likely that Stamford had been surreptitiously using his abilities to sooth Holmes’ raging psyche, to calm those dangerous waters and bring him a modicum of peace. Which meant Holmes’ near unraveling at his death had been more than the customary grief of lost love. For Holmes had lost not only his lover, but his psychic anchor as well, and it was only his own iron will that had kept him precariously clinging to sanity.
“I do not see how I can.” He lit another pipe, body crumpled in haphazard angles on the settee. He felt agitated, raw and restless and uneasy. Out there beyond the solid walls of the Diogenes, evil was seeping into the city. It would be only a very short time before it began claiming victims of a more sympathetic variety than the fellow they’d dredged out of the water.
"You do. Feeling better?"
"True," Watson admitted, frowning deeply as he pulled himself from his reverie. "But maintaining a thrall requires they be given blood frequently. If there are other thralls in the city, the sire is not likely to be far."
a murderer. That was what he had to keep reminding himself of; Kramer had been an innocent man.
Newman's eyes narrowed dangerously. "I was chosen to serve a higher power!" he hissed.
He had been touching Watson this whole time, either a hand pressed to his back or leaning against his side or their heads touched briefly together. He was not wholly conscious of it, but it helped soothe and ground him to have his hands on the man.
have known. He'd asked Watson to tell him what he knew of vampiric society and the man claimed to know hardly anything at all, having been abandoned by his own sire and thus left ignorant of his kind.  Well, he'd known more than he'd spoken of and that was a problem now because if Holmes had been told all this beforehand, he would have played his hand quite differently.
The first thing to do was visit Mrs. Montressor. He did not
"I do not think so. I believe however his disappearance is linked to several others in the area I am investigating."
“It will be fastest if I carry you, then. Here, climb onto my back,” Watson said, and Holmes laughed at him.
“And nearly as long since Newman came to the parish,” Watson added, and Holmes gave him an approving look.
find him."
"Sherlock," Mycroft said, and for once his voice was something approaching gentle. "You misunderstand. I did
"Hmmm?" He surfaced, and for a moment it wasn’t Watson's voice in his ears. He fought down a sudden pang; the road was steep and slow but he was getting marginally better at ignoring such things. "I don’t remember," he said gruffly, then turned his attention back to the beaker. Dull yellow...what did that mean? He'd written it down...he went in search of his research notes.
The papers were thrown into a frenzy. For days the headlines were printed in blood, entire pages devoted to what they had affectionately nicknamed "The Marylebone Vampire" and for a time all London was abuzz with wild speculation. But the faster news traveled the quicker it passed, and after all, there was only so much sport to be had over a single murder. Eventually the papers moved on to other shocking delights, the rumors died down, and when people walked the streets at night they stared at their feet again, and not the rooftops.
Holmes roused himself, licked at lips that were dry and cracked as old leather. "I've felt better," he croaked, voice sounding like something dredged up out of a gutter.
“I cannot go to a hospital,” Holmes continued in that same reasonable tone that made Watson want to wallop some sense into him, “unless you have a suitable answer for how I ended up there when I can neither stand nor crawl."
And then Newman simply wasn’t there anymore. Holmes heard a loud and sickening crack that registered in the back of his mind as a skull shattering on stone, but that didn’t mean anything to him. All that mattered was the demon’s voice in his head, screaming for his blood.
Despite himself Watson laughed, and bowed slightly towards Holmes, a conciliatory tone to the movement.
"Who are you?" he demanded.
Mycroft knew of the existence of thralls. Knew of them so intimately that he had this room - the only place in the whole of the Diogenes that non-members were allowed - warded against them, for that is unquestionably what had happened. If he knew of thralls, then he also knew of vampires, and his knowledge likely far surpassed Holmes’ own; a fact which would make his task both easier and harder.
"What are you-" Watson began, but Holmes quieted him with a wave of his hand before pricking his finger on a needle held in place with a vise and smearing a few drops of his own blood on another part of the shirt. Watson opened his mouth to caution Holmes against drawing blood when he had none to spare but the detective held up a silencing finger, checking his pocket watch. After a few minutes he poured the contents of the beaker he'd been holding onto the ruined material. The pig's blood remained a dark red stain, but the human blood turned a rust brown.
he had fed...
“There does seem to be a curious aggregation of madness among the patrons of Saint Cyprian's,” Holmes noted, and Lestrade spread his hands in hapless agreement.
Watson looked up at him with interest, eyebrows hiked high on his forehead. “You’re familiar with the occult? Stamford led me to understand you gave such things no credence.”
"Of course not; you're under thrall. How could you be anything but enamored with me?" he said miserably.
desire...or perhaps Watson was burning with his. He couldn’t tell the difference, anymore.
“Good Lord-" Watson breathed, shielding his eyes and taking a reflexive step away from the growing blaze, "should I call for the fire brigade on the way out?”
"Now, Mister Montressor, one final leap of faith. Your wife will go without you." Knowing this to be distressing to him -- in fact counting on it -- he soothed the blow by hastily adding, "I will walk with her, she will not be defenseless. But you must see with your own eyes that your wife is whole and safe, even in darkness. Even when you are not by her side."
deliberate, occurring organically between vampire and victim, for reasons unknown even your kind.” He sighed heavily, “It is also quite permanent.”
Three months later Stamford was dead.
need to speak with him."
"I should like to see them; piecing them together might prove an adequate distraction for a time."
of him that Watson had difficulty getting a lock on anything definite. It was akin to standing in the middle of a crowded room and trying to pluck a single thread of conversation from the multitude.
“And how to you plan to explain that to the Yard?”
disobeyed him; a thing that should be impossible. Then again, Watson had not really noticed the insubordination because Holmes had been subtly disobeying him this entire time...mostly regarding their more intimate relations. But that supposed contradiction was born of the fact that Watson himself was conflicted.
"Ah!" Holmes shouted, waking with a start, strangled gasp trapped in the back of his throat that turned into a groan of pain. "Watson...yes, of course. Off you go, my boy," he replied, shooing him away with a flick of his fingers.
"You are host to a parasite."
He glanced down to find the pen in his hand crushed to a twisted mélange of metal and ink, black morass dripping down, pooling on the desk and creeping towards his medical journals like the piceous tendrils of some monstrous deep-sea creature. It reminded him of ichor, of blood. It reminded him he had forgotten to feed this week...
"I agree," Father Deighton said. "Poor fellow must have met some terrible evil out there..."
“Ah, but what a glorious death,” Holmes teased, but then sobered himself for Watson’s sake. “Do not fear; I will not let him harm you, nor give him more reason to wish it than he already has.”
Inside the foyer were three chairs in a row, encircled by a small group of men, including Mycroft, Sturgerson, and, “Hello again,” Holmes said to the burgundy waistcoated man, who glowered back silently.
Holmes offered up a pale and humorless smile. "I feel as though I've been shot."
Lestrade stopped in his tracks like he'd been grabbed, staring at Holmes' swiftly retreating back. “What’s the
Watson considered his answer carefully, his fingers gentle on the side of Holmes face. “I cannot answer that now. Ask me again once the thrall fades.”
"It is forbidden in the common areas, where causal members who have not been indoctrinated into the coven often mingle with those of the inner circle. No need that way to worry over loose tongues. But here only senior members are allowed to pass, and writing notes to each other would swiftly become tedious. Even so, we do not make a great habit of it."
“What
of the spirit, these terrible weeks..." Montressor looked close to tears.
"That never changes," Holmes continued. "The nature of man: conflicted and afraid. Fear is an inherent characteristic in any sentient creature. The deer must be ever wary of the wolf, and the wolf fears the hunter. But conflict; it is our self-awareness which grants us that. The urial fears the lion but it is not conflicted about it. Neither is the lion conflicted about where its dinner comes from. We are capable of such great goodness and great evil precisely
Holmes considered that, a contemplative tip to head. “Possibly, but who would assist in the endeavor? I was given to understand Stamford was the chief mentalist among you; has he been replaced, or is there another who could perform such a task?”
"I am certain he does, as the man who hired him knows what I am."
Holmes had to admit it had been his own carelessness that set events into motion, a brief but unforgivable lapse in his usually ridged standards brought on, no doubt, by the after-effects of mild to moderate blood loss. In such a state his thoughts became fractured and disorganized, body slow to respond to his commands.
As he scrubbed the lye soap over his hard skin he had a moment of clarity, identifying the feeling inside himself at last. He had thought it was anger. He had thought - he had thought himself incensed by Holmes, embittered over Stamford's death. This, he realized with no small amount of chagrin, was not the case.
Seeing Mycroft's thoughts bent in another direction, Holmes relaxed slightly. But only slightly. “It was not consciously done,” he said, and Mycroft rumbled at him.
“We have so little time,” he said. “Let us make the most of it.”
"And what was your wife's reaction to this?"
," Mycroft growled, his face pale white with anger, whole body shaking in barely suppressed outrage.
"I hadn’t noticed," Newman replied, sounding bored. "But as I said, no one has disturbed his things."
Thus he was caught completely off guard when the toff turned and smiled at him very wide. "Ah, my dear fellow," he said in pleasant tone that sent ice down the back of Nock’s spine, "I wouldn't do that if I were you."
“No matter,” Holmes said, eyes closed and breathing too labored for Watson’s comfort. “It will- not be a terribly hard thing to explain. The constabulary rarely looks past the most obvious.”
The doctor pursed his lips. "We can talk of it, but until your wounds heal over I am reluctant to agree, unless you hire a doctor of your own."
He cursed and flung the pen away. He was still thinking about Sherlock Holmes. Thinking about the way the detective would be smirking at him right now, supercilious smile tucked into the corner of his mouth, hands in his pockets as he watched Watson make an immortal fool out of himself.
Holmes eyes cleared, growing sharp as he felt the weariness leave his limbs, slowly replaced with the squirreling energy that always infused him when a case reached its pivotal point. “Has he been taken into the clergy house?” he asked and the boy nodded.
He ran with it anyway. “There is,” he said with a lecherous grin, “but you keep telling me I must wait until after the thrall has faded.”
Chapter 25 is the official end of book one, and the first chapter of book two has been posted. This small addendum will hopefully clear up any confusion anyone has. If not, go ahead and shoot us an ask.
At least, Watson mused with morose humor, he was finally getting some sleep.
This was a trouble he was most keen they avoid. On that point he would happily avoid it himself, were not a man’s life hanging in the balance. But the fact that the unfortunate soul had been taken in so quickly could mean nothing good. Holmes would have to act with equal celerity.
"Well, if you hold his death against me then find comfort in knowing my days since have been their own hell, and will continue to be so until I am doubtlessly murdered by someone seeking a less righteous brand of vengeance than yourself."
“I shall always fear for you, brother,” Mycroft said blandly in what was, for him, a display of high emotion. "You've a martyr's soul and a masochist's heart. Do not think it has gone unnoticed that your 'improvement' comes only after you've allowed yourself to be nearly beaten to death."
