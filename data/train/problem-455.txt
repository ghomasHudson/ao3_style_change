"Not with his knowledge, no, he's craven but not stupid, and it wouldn't profit him in the long run, even if he did try to frame someone else. Still happened on his watch. Inside job, though? Almost certainly."
about that old cabin he very much did not like. It wasn't just the draping of dormant kudzu and grape, wasn't just the way the light shining through the dead windows didn't seem to match the moonlight exactly, wasn't just the natural fear of a building that had been rotting for probably at least fifty years and could come down around them at any time, wasn't just the way this was the time of year when snakes liked to find their winter sleeping places.
"I knew it," Holder said.
"You took it home."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mmm,” said Sherlock, slightly preening. “Anyway, the business partner was grateful that her arrest put an end to the embezzling too, so I took care of Mrs. Hudson’s Mother’s Day present a little bit early.”
“Yes,” John said, twisting his head around for a kiss, and receiving it.
"OK, it won't be right now though, sorry. I have an appointment with someone who's getting scammed over bitcoin, and if I pull on these threads, it'll lead me somewhere big." Holmes looked suddenly very nervous.
"Yes," Sherlock said. Under John's eyes, he was opening his jeans, and squirming.
"You think it's the son?"
Burnwell took it, and gave Holmes the gems. Sad, broken things they were - the settings were bent and the crown had lost its beauty. Fortunately, Sherlock had real paper cash in his pocket, that he would take to the best jewelry fence in New York. That person would be able to seamlessly recreate the crown to its original glory. For the ceremony that would happen two days from now.
Fuck, Sherlock was sucking him like he was trying to eat a hearty soup through a straw. John was amazed he'd managed to keep linear thought going as long as he did. Inarticulate sounds broke from his throat, and he didn't think he'd be able to come nearly as quickly as he did, all his efforts at holding off defeated.
John looked at him for a long moment and then smiled. "Feeling it?"
He laughed of course. Something was going on. Should he send a laugh emoji back? He kind of wanted to, but he also kind of suspected the message was code, so he thought he shouldn't send anything. Holmes would know he'd read it, right? That was enough.
"Yeah. Look at me. I'm so wet. You did that. Look!" John pointed at the crotch of his jeans, faded denim darkened by the trickle of wetness.
They weren't.
"But the help you did give was invaluable. You know we're a team, right? I'm not in this just for me, you know that."
“How good a shot are you with a cock up your ass?' Sherlock chuckled.
“Yess…” Sherlock murmured. “After the fair I’ll tell Lestrade where the victim’s body is.”
"I did clock you for a Friend of Dorothy, though," she said quietly. She said no more, just watched his face journey. It was long, and complex, and beautiful - and exactly what he deserved for interrupting her
Then they were laughing, perhaps just a bit hysterically. John couldn't resist and he leaned over to turn Sherlock's face towards his to claim a sloppy, shoulder-heaving kiss.
John barely had his cock out of his boxers and aimed properly at the toilet when the stream started, urgent and hot. God, it felt good to let go. He let out a long sigh, and that, combined with the sound of the stream hitting the bowl, covered up what he probably should have heard. But you didn't live with Sherlock Holmes for long without developing a sixth sense.
"Man, the major corporate label cut
Jon woke up with a start, imagining he was still back in Afghanistan. He yanked his hands down from around the pillows, expecting to see them covered in blood.
and the next thing John knew, he was tearing one of those boys up, methodically, yanking out veins and arteries to get that goddamn morphine back.
“Sure did,” John said. “Too much snow to fuck you right here though. Let’s go home and I’ll collect my bounty.”
Sherlock held his gaze until it started to smolder. “I think it’s time for our traditional post-case celebration, don’t you?” he said, rising from the couch and holding out his hand.
“If you must. Just make sure we keep control of the narrative . . . oh, never mind. Just don't be cruel, and for God's sake, don't be seen being cruel. We are
their balls off," Watson finally said.
John cocked his head and smiled at Sherlock, all sleep-mussed in the moonlight. “You erased the solar system, but not Yeats?”
John shuffled out onto the porch of Sherlock's house in his pajamas and hiking boots. The porchlight was the only artificial illumination; the white in the night sky and the white on the ground reflected each other and cast an eerie, pale light.
“It happens sometimes, problems with fetal development . . . “
Sherlock reluctantly drew away to give John room to move. "Bathtub, I'm thinkin.' I feel kind of creaky. Want to take some time to soak. Wanna join me?"
Sherlock gave a guttural sound of triumph when John spilled into his mouth. John could look down and see those quicksilver eyes blinking. Sherlock wasn't impatient now, though. He was reverently tender in fact, cozying John's cock with soft licking kisses until it finally went fully soft and John relaxed.
Sherlock jerked his head up and snarled silently. The half-dozen huge cans of tomato juice had done nothing to abate the stench, and now he just smelled like skunk with tomato sauce. He was in one of the old bathtubs in the yard, since John had barred him from the house when he came back steeped in
"She let him in. She had watched my dad open the safe and filmed him doing it. She gave him the combination. I happened to hear him - footsteps where footsteps shouldn't be. I was in my pajamas but I caught him, out in the courtyard, and we fought. And he got away with a few jewels but I was trying to bend it back into shape and make it look more presentable when Dad caught me. And I didn't want to give her up. I couldn't. I've been the bad guy in this family most of my life, I'm used to it."
A few trout and beers later, Lestrade was looking a little bit cross-eyed. “Now, tell you the truth, I always thought
Once in the shower, Sherlock took him into his arms and kissed him. That was a pretty amazing mixed message right there, happening in John's groin.
Sherlock's eyes still goaded him now, ice-blue in the sun, set in that striking face with its red juice streaks . . . and then John just gave up, and swore, and started stripping off his own clothes in a put-upon way. He'd only just figured how to fit his body to Sherlock's in the steep old tub and kiss him with tongue and lust despite his watering eyes and burning nose, when he heard a sound that made his blood run cold.
“So the florist . . . poisoned her husband with flowers on their anniversary?”
“Can I tell her?”
Never the same one twice. What would be the point of that?
"Now, I'm not completely sold on this repatriation fad, between you and me. We have the facilities to keep precious objects in good climate control, and we're a world-class museum that can display it in the highest levels of safety and with the best possible lighting, with programs and side cards to educate about cultural context. People travel from all over the world to see art in New York, and I have no doubt it's more appreciated here than it could ever be in some backwater. And I do have some skepticism about its security and fair treatment in a less prominent hub."
A middle-aged white man burst into the room, a line of sweat prickling along his high forehead, his hands shaking terribly - Jon sneaked a glance at the car outside and let out a low whistle. There was another man standing by, watching the street warily.
That earned an extra one. Sherlock’s firm flesh beneath snug denim didn’t quite jiggle the way John loved best, though, so he reached under Sherlock, opening his jeans and pulling them down to admire his work. Even in the pale light, the rosy color of Sherlock’s perfect ass was glorious, and John ran his tingling hands over the curves to feel the burn.
"We've got to talk, Lestrade," Sherlock said, as they walked up the hill towards the woods.
John shuddered as Sherlock's cock bore down inside him, waves of pleasure filling his pelvis. “They could join in if they want.”
"What do I need to do to prove it?" John said, approaching him slowly. "Whatever it takes, I'll do it."
Greg Lestrade/Molly Hooper! Who's getting interrupted now?
He heard a distant fiddle calling him to the place where he belonged.
“Tomato juice doesn't
“Never underestimate the single-minded focus of the dedicated criminal, John,” Sherlock said. “Like an artist, like a religious zealot, like a mathematical genius, the obsession can’t be broken by outside forces.”
Then after the last note had been allowed to die away for its full length, he lowered his violin and bow and faced Jon.
John thought. What he said was, "Considering everything else you can get me to do, that sounds downright nice."
“Unlike our tires,” John said ruefully.
“And” - slap - “what” - slap - “did” - slap - “you” -slap - “do?”
And after it was all done and they’d consumed plenty of cheese to go with Holder’s whine, they cheerfully accepted the limo ride back to Harlem, with the gratis champagne.
he’d love to watch that someday. “Sherlock, c’mon,” he muttered. “It’s good - I want-”
“No, John,” Sherlock said, pushing his hips forward in the rocking chair. “I don’t think I am.”
Sherlock stared down into the bowl, and John could almost hear his brain calculating the color and consistency. Was it too dark? Was Sherlock going to be force feeding him water?
he thought when the pumpkin was blown and starting to burn, pressing seed-laden orange slime to his face.
It turns out that Vietnam is not John's last source of Nightmare Fuel. Sherlock adapts.
This time, Jamie was quick with her knife. The first stab took Sherlock in the gut, the second in the chest, and the third, buried to the hilt in his long slim neck. This time it was Sherlock who clutched at himself in shock, his white hands going red with the blood he failed to hold inside. It was Sherlock who slumped backwards into the mine shaft. Turning to John, making John the last sight in his eyes as the light left them, and he fell.
"Sure do. Want you to do it, too. Is that a can of Crisco in your pocket or are you just already so hard you're about to bust out of your jeans?"
It was that he had the nerve to smell like that
"I never meant to cut you out of it. But this wasn't a gig where I needed muscle. It relied on my own contacts."
“So you deserve this, don’t you?”
What has Sherlock done now? Is it a gift? An apology? A thank-you? Whatever it is, it's a little bit sweet and a little bit morbid.
Sherlock so fervently hoped that was the champagne talking. Carbonated alcohol affects the brain differently than other kinds. "Jon, I never meant to imply that. Anything of the sort. You're important."
Watson. Instead, he was going to address himself completely to the issue of the pumpkin and why Mrs Hudson’s pies had such chemical perfection. The question of Jamie Rowe, and the question of Dr Watson, would percolate in the subconscious of his mind while he studied the inner alchemy of the largest native squash.
It was one of those magical nights when the snow was coming down hard and heavy, but there wasn't a single breath of wind, so every twig on every tree was outlined in white, and the air was heavy with a musical silence. John could
John's heart started to pound. "Are we goin’...?"
The archaic shower pipes above his head awakened with their usual piercing screech. John hadn’t needed as much sleep as he’d thought, then. Soon he’d be coming down, and then Sherlock would assess his mood in a moment, and he would know how to proceed.
Sherlock shivered. His torso slightly curled in.
Why was he still thinking about John Watson?
"So...I think maybe it's time you explained some things," John said, leaning back in the chair with an easy smile to let Sherlock know he wasn't judging, even if he might feel tempted to do exactly that. "About Shinwell Johnson, for one. You don't usually just have people come by and give you a vintage Harley for no reason."
Arthur kind of crumbled then, and finally consented to take a seat. "I really didn't want to say this. I really didn't. It's my fault for bringing Burnwell into this at all. You know I have some...bad habits. You know that he's trouble. I got in too deep with him, that's all. Yeah, I owe some money. But I wouldn't have done this. Problem is, he met Mary and they hit it off. Of course they did, he's Hollywood handsome and he has charisma and he...radiates this sex appeal. Gender no object. Worst thing I ever saw in my life was the look in her eyes when he was around."
John didn't want to break the companionable silence, but he did stop resisting the temptation to slide his hand up Sherlock's denim-clad thigh, lean and warm beneath his hand. Sherlock smiled and leaned back a little, placing his hand over John's. He took another deep sip of iced tea, and John watched the bob in his long pale throat. "Mm," Sherlock said. "Maybe what I need more is to relax a little bit."
She shook her head. "Don't do that, young man. I pack a piece and I have reflexes."
“Think, John! That little girl’s father is going to prison. I won’t break her heart further by forcing Lestrade to dig up her prize-winning 4-H strawberry patch before the harvest.”
"I didn't get that impression, no," Jon said, laughing. "Probably shocked he still got the hubcaps on that Benz."
And so, the crown was repaired, with Holmes’s agent wearing a Guy Fawkes mask for all entrances and exits.
“Yeah?” John asked as he stripped slowly, refusing to cringe from the chill, watching the movements of Sherlock’s eyes down his body. “Really?” He crawled under the covers and ran his hands over Sherlock’s legs. “You sure?” He lay down on his back.
"If you don't mind...I'd like to..." Sherlock had brought up towels, and John was just a little bit frightened until he realized Sherlock had been telling the truth about his bladder. He just wanted to straddle John's hips and jerk off on his stomach and chest, and let John caress him and help him along and grunt sweet filthy everythings. The towels were just for wiping off perfectly normal semen.
he'd been sleeping with for weeks, he'd say it. Three words.
"I sure do. Glad Miss Adlero is still cranking them out." It was a remarkable song - R & B with decades of history in it, a haunting blues slide guitar slithering alongside her versatile, masterfully controlled voice. There was sorrow in it, and hope. Watson took the phone from Holmes and looked at the title. "Goodnight Mr. H?"
“Naw. Mrs. Hudson knew it right off. She thought I was slow.”
Jon had an unusually uneventful shift at the hospital. Only a few heart attacks, and one biking accident. No fatalities. He felt his phone buzzing in his scrubs, and was so relieved to be able to take it out. Holmes had sent him a funny video of a crow and a puppy playing.
"Between thought and expression lies a lifetime" - the Velvet Underground, "Some Kinda Love."
Missing scene from
But never a neighbor. Never a friend, not since - no, never a friend, not really; in only one case was it debatable. Never anyone who met his . . . people he knew.
Jon took a deep breath. "It's okay, man, I gotta sleep. Morning shift at the hospital. " Then a wild hair rose up in his mind, and he said, very quietly, "I don't lock my room. The bed is tiny but you're welcome there."
Sherlock Holmes had bedded many, many men over the years.
“That’s five days away. He’s gonna think you’re gettin’ slow.”
"Am I wrong about that?" she reminded him gently.
“HIM!” Lestrade yelled.
“Oh,” John said calmly. He waited until Lestrade's mouth was as full as it could possibly be before saying in an utterly matter-of-fact way, “He's just about the hottest piece of ass I've ever had.”
“Mmmmm,” Sherlock said into John’s spine as he crept up, kissing all the way with his musky mouth that latched like a leech onto John’s neck, his ear, aiming at his mouth. John just arched his ass up for the feel of Sherlock’s greased cockhead pushing at him, and then
"The old man tipped me very nicely indeed. Very nicely. Of course it's ninety percent hush money. I wish there was enough time to let Mycroft's tailor work on you, but we're going to where he buys off the rack." He tapped the taxi driver and gave a Midtown address.
Even as John was starting to lose his mind from Sherlock's ravenous attentions, his fingers flexed in texture that was all wrong. And dark as the old cabin was, he could see that what little was revealed by the moonlight was ALL WRONG in color and the way the walls met the light. It was - slick. Meaty. Not at all woodlike. He glanced around, the spell broken, and wondered how both he and Sherlock had managed to miss what littered the floors in the corners. Bones and skulls. Mostly animal, but some human. And now the walls seemed to start to press in, and the floor start to rise, and there was a horrible squelching that was not coming from Sherlock's mouth on him.
"Oh no. Oh no. I am not lettin' you buy me an expensive suit." He looked indignant, and it was endearing. But also worrying.
In honor of master mountain musician Dr. Ralph Stanley (February 25, 1927 - June 23, 2016)
Sherlock focused on the issue with his usual intensity then, having been nudged, and then John started to get a little bit worried. How overboard could he go? Best not to even think about that.
"Arthur," Holmes said calmly, trying to call him back into himself. "I want to hear your side of the story in your own words. But I gotta tell you that you need to stop protecting Mary."
John sighed. “So does the whole town know?”
“John. Okay. Your son, he - ”
to it?”
There'd been more to Sherlock's game that night than finding a match for the fiddle of bone.
“I can keep my mouth shut,” Lestrade said. “But you probably oughta know she's put word out in her church that y'all are
Holmes sighed. "Alright, alright. A little bit more anticlimactic that I like, but..." He rummaged around in an inner pocket of his bright white suit jacket and took out a small manila envelope. With a little bit of a flourish, he emptied its contents onto the glass coffee table. The pilfered jewels, in their broken setting.
He looked down at the dark curls tickling his thigh and felt a line of warm drool leaking down to his balls.
If Holder caught the shade, he gave no indication. "I only wanted to keep it secure. There’s no one there but longtime trusted help and my sweet niece Mary. But - my son. My Arthur. He's been in trouble in the past - led astray by bad companions, of course. There was an issue with drugs when he was in college."
“And if they don't?” Sherlock growled in John's ear.
John closed his eyes. Drew deep breath. Held his stillness as long as he could. “And Mary?”
A 221B
"Sri Lanka," Sherlock cut in.
Sherlock gave a full-body shiver, and then he exhaled, and he let go, and John leaned in to avoid getting it on his face - he didn't want it in his eyes, that's for sure, and he was not at all ready for the mouth thing - letting the warm jets land on his chest and run down his body. His jeans were going to get wet but if anything he liked that, he'd wear it as long as it took to get back to the house and wash them, and have that little marker of Sherlock on him. He felt Sherlock's piss stream down his belly, pooling for a moment in his navel. He saw Sherlock's face relax and turn innocent with blissful relief.
I was thinking of the way, in
“Oh hell yeah,” John said, feeling his cock twitch as Sherlock led him up the stairs of the old farmhouse. John gasped when he saw the bedroom.
Sherlock shows a considerate side, and John is eager to reward him.
"You didn't ask me to help you solve the case of the missing Federal agents," Sherlock said quietly.
"Reckon we do," the Sheriff said, and he did not sound happy.
"Shinwell needed a flexible prop to increase his social standing in certain circles."
"I can't just enjoy your obedience?"
John has Nam-mares. Sherlock has a method.
"Fuck," John said, letting his head loll back on his suddenly boneless neck. "You're just decadent sometimes, you know that?"
That was an image that stuck in John's mind.
"Where I'm going, yeah."
“Why the hell are you tryin’?” John giggled.
(See the end of the chapter for
Was Sherlock into that?
Two VERY DARK glimpse of what might have been, if this version of John and Sherlock had never met. Most of the others are rather light-hearted. These aren't.
"Mr. Holmes?" he said.
Jon's eyes looked huge, and he let out a little whistle. Sherlock tried not to think of all the ways he'd been taught that love had to be earned. He dabbled in a little Southern fiddle style before returning to his first early favorites, Venuti and Grappelli. Then at last he settled into a project of his own working: a solo violin arrangement of "My Favorite Things" (after Coltrane). This was dangerous because it got him emotional. In his heart of hearts he did not want to be a genius who’ll die young.
A few almost-clear drops started out. A leaky faucet drip at most.
"Mmmm" was pretty much all Sheriff Lestrade could say, his mouth completely occupied with the slick delights between Molly Hooper's thighs. She writhed to and fro, popping the corner of the sheet right off the mattress. Her heels dug into his back and her hand tugged at his salt-and-pepper hair as he licked and sucked with both enthusiasm and attention to detail. She was close, he could feel it, muscles in her legs tightening and quivering.
There was no distracting him from thoughts of the naked man in his bed, who had crawled upwards and passed out on his chest after bringing him to spectacular orgasm with a technically less-than-spectacular blowjob - a bit sloppy, but rewarding in its enthusiasm - and who had fucked him as close to senseless as Sherlock had been since the last time he had Afghani black tar.
"So what was all this for?" John gestured at the pumpkin on their kitchen table, just at the right height. With the large and deep round hole cut into it. (With a nose and a pair of eyes and a squiggle of dark curls Sherlock had drawn with a marker and said, "Just pretend it's my mouth.")
"Mycroft also doesn't think
"It is. He does a good job of it. But there are some things you can't change, and, like they say in the Serenity Prayer, wisdom is knowin' the difference."
Sherlock started undressing as he went up the stairs, letting his shirt fall over the banister, leaving his shoes right at the top for John to trip over, dropping his tight bell-bottom jeans right over the threshold of the door he wasn't going to bother to close. John chugged the lukewarm Bud as he heard the water pipes howl.
"Longterm loan." That was indeed just a hint of a smirk. "Alright. Surely you're aware that motorcycle clubs are a significant presence in the subculture in general, yes. Well, there are, shall we say, different affiliations. And tenuous allegiances. And occasionally the practice of running drugs and guns has some...overlap. Still, you have to be careful not to confuse a purely outlaw club in that sense with the ones that are also outlaw in a certain...sexual sense."
"No," John cried. "Stop."
"You really are a fucking know-it-all," John said fondly, giving Sherlock's ass a light slap. He picked up the picnic basket and cooler, and didn't even mind having to carry everything, because Sherlock kept his hand in John's rear pocket the whole way back down to the house, except when he slipped around a little for a bit of a discreet fondle - which made John feel just fine about being temporarily a little itchy and doing a fair amount of squelching.
John laughed, wrapped up in terrycloth and Sherlock's arms. "You appreciate how.I put up with you, you mean. You ask me to piss on you and I say yes. What's that about?"
John thought.
The church was packed, standing room only, but Sherlock and John truly saw only a few people. Martha Hudson herself, asleep in her bed of flowers, and her caretaker Violet Lestrade standing by the casket. Violet’s mother Molly (née Hooper) hugged her and glanced at her husband who waited on the bandstand.
John’s bladder was screaming. Seriously. If he dawdled too much he might not even make it to the bathroom, it was that bad. Regretfully he gently nudged Sherlock's arm off his waist - if Sherlock squeezed anywhere below his navel they'd both live to regret it.
John's eyes slowly blinked open, a bit sticky and gummy with sleep still. The light in the windows of the old bedroom was gray - an overcast day, maybe some rain for the garden later. That'd make Mrs. Hudson happy. Also create a lot of good mud for preserving footprints in case there was a promising murder any time soon. Yeah, John had a lot of reasons not to mind rainy days.
John breathed it in with his eyes, his whole soul rejoicing. He heard Sherlock coming up behind him, and sighed and settled as Sherlock's hands slid around his belly and drew him close.
221B format (221 words exactly, last word must begin with 'b')
Back at home, Jon was sulking a little, even after listening to Sherlock's explanation of all his brilliant deductions and how he'd beat the case. "You cut me out of this, man. It was dangerous, especially with Burnwell. Just say the word and I'll be with you."
“Almost…there,” Sherlock whispered, cold air knifing his lungs. The branch he dragged did little to hide his trail in the deep snow, but the details would be blurred, and soon he’d reach the creek bed that could obscure his path completely.
They exchanged a glance. Both were armed.
John smiled and his shoulders relaxed. “Can't thank you enough for that, buddy.”
“Didn't make it. Did he?”
anyway.”
“Oh John. You’re such an idiot, you come full circle to being brilliant.”
time.
“Ha, ha, tourists, That's a good one. Nope. I'm gonna catch a lot. I'm gonna feed my whole spur of Rt 221. Give Mrs. Hudson some payback. Keep Sherlock from keelin' over in his beehives.”
"I think - "
"Filthiest shower I ever had," he said, kissing Sherlock's neck. Limply he swiped at them again with the soap.
"Correct." Oh no, did he look wistful? Anyone might be, for their wasted youth. Sherlock himself had evidently been a lot of people's favorite wasted youth. "He was well-connected, I was working on several cases with ties to places that he had better access to than I. New York City is a gathering place where a lot of the dregs of the world empty, but even then I knew there was possibly just as much exciting criminality out in the hinterlands, on the open road. So for the sake of the science of deduction, I accepted a temporary arrangement of mutual advantage."
The lines Sherlock quotes come from
The doctor was young. Still a scientist, still trying to explain.
John was doing his best to make sure his face was showing nothing but radiant pride and delight. No disgust allowed. And he wasn't faking that, not in the slightest. "I knew you had it in you," he said.
“Yeah?” Oh, that was a terrible look on Jon’s face. He wasn’t convinced. He needed to be.
"How 'bout a nice big pitcher of Mrs. Hudson's cold sweet tea?" John said with a little grin. "I know you can't resist that."
"And now you have it on you," Sherlock said, snickering.
John thought. At first, he'd known the twists and turns of road, the specific sounds of gravel in certain places, the rush of wind moving through walls of trees sounding so different from the patches of open fields. The dips of valleys, the steep rises of hills, the stomach-twist of switchbacks and the little inner ear-pops of changing altitude. But now, he was lost, well and truly, and the world was dark.
''Not enough data on what?'' came my drowsy reply.
We had settled down before the fire, each in his favourite armchair. I was tired and sleep was not far of, Holmes was wide awake. Steady clouds of smoke curled up from his pipe. His expression was vacant, sometimes he focused on me, as if to make sure that I was still there and then he vanished again, to whatever place his thoughts had taken him.
When I had made it about halfway through London’s deserted streets, my anger had fled into the cool night air. Surely there was an explanation to Holmes behaviour, there usually was. All I had to do was wait and soon everything would clear itself up, or so I hoped…
I hung my wet hat, scarf and coat upon the rag, together with my walking stick and picked up my medical bag, limped over to the cupboard and placed it inside, leaving my gloves on the small table by the fire, on the way.
As it was, I was just leaving the home of my last patient, an old army acquaintance of mine, who really was who he claimed to be, or so Holmes had said with some surprise, which had confused me in turn.
I put down my medical bag and stood, the light from the landing streaming past me and throwing my own shadow in stark outlines on the floor.
Then, suddenly, he sat up.
I kept my face turned to the flagstones below me, in as much an attempt to shield my face from the wind, as to watch were I treaded, for a constant soft drizzle had made the stones slippery.
''You must now, I am a great admirer of your work and your nerve, to get so close, to live with such a man. I couldn’t do it, not for all the money in the world. Your stories are an enormous success, of course, but is it really worth it? Surely, it would be far easier to make as much money as possible at once, instead of the years you would have to wait, until your story's have earned you enough to finally be able to get away from this madmen. Consider it. One last payment and then, you would finally be rid of him. How does that sound? And all I want you to do in return—''
I huffed and he smiled indulgently.
On our way home, he linked his arm with mine, as much to be near me as to support me, I suspected. He seemed still upset, but I wanted to give him the opportunity to sift through his thoughts first. I was sure that when he had gotten through them, he would tell me what was the matter. We had been walking for some little time and had just turned into Bakerstreet, when Holmes spoke:
Rather then answering him, I took him by his elbow, stirring him away from the window and towards the settee.
Worn from a long day, stiff from the drive and tired from the suffocating air in the cab, I stumbled out of the car, paid the cabby and wished him seasons greetings.
He then tried to lose them quite forcibly, which had the result of them wrapping themselves even tighter around him.
When I was at his side, he lay one the ground, moving helplessly. He looked like a caterpillar.
''He insulted you Holmes! How could I just stand there and do nothing, he said that, he implied that I—''
I must have fallen asleep then. When I open my eyes again, Holmes is lying on his right side, facing me. He must have turned in his sleep.
He followed and as I sat down, he sat himself close beside me and carefully, draped his long legs over my own, so that he could curl up on his side to rest his head comfortably against my chest, while avoiding to put pressure on my bad leg.

''I can’t say, not yet.''
I picked up the two teacups with their saucers, setting them upon the papers and books that were strewn across the table, poured tea for both of us and added milk, all in hopes that Holmes may change his mind.
I turned on the lights myself, then and closed the door.
His mind, usually demanding some stimulant or other seems to find peace, at least for a short time and so I wrapped my arms around him, to hold him close.
Usually, I do my best not to take notice and will try to get back to sleep, as soon as he has calmed down.
I made my way towards one of the main roads were I hoped to find a cap, as I didn't feel up to a long walk.
While I drank my tea, I became suddenly aware of the near complete silence that had fallen over our rooms.
I was in quite a temper, and on my way to the Tobacconist.
''Watson?''
''Hmm!?'' came the startled answer.
Behind him, a wake of opened doors.
The hot tea and the silence, both produced in me a curious clearness of mind and thereby enabled me to see the melancholy, that seeped through the cracks in the usually smooth, cold stonewall Holmes had built around himself, a safeguard, even against myself.
Gently, I ease his sleeping form back down onto the bed. I draw the bedsheets, which he had kicked away in his sleep, over the both of us
I finally made it to the main road, already frozen and barely able to walk.
Resigned, I walked over to the table and sat down upon my chair.
It is decided therefor, I will stay.
He looked up, then. ''It’s fine. It’s fine… Hm. It is?! Holmes, how—''
The curtains were half drawn, preventing the dim streetlight from entering the room. From were I stood, I could just see a thin line of the dark sky and the snow covering the roof of the house opposite our own.
''—and so you stayed.''
His warmth bled through my clothes, chasing away the last of the heaviness the cold had left in my bones and warming me to the core. To be so close to him, felt just as marvellous as it had the very first time, like holding a part of oneself that had been missing, but was now finally found.
Barefoot and in my nightclothes I make my way to his room. I open the door slowly, soundlessly, slip inside and close it behind me.
I found a cab that, after a ride that seemed far longer than it ought, even with the heavy snowfall, brought me right up to the doorstep of 221B.
''Watson!''
There is a corridor. It is long, very long but narrow and dark. The rough stone walls are lined with heavy wooden doors. The air is damp and cold. Almost no sound is to be heard, but the faint rushing of water, as if from far away.
All was over in a flash and I could do nothing but watch. I do not enjoy the feeling of being to slow, I don’t want to be useless. Therefore, I clumsily walked the few steps over to Holmes, who stood with his back to me, over our, now quite harmless adversary, starring down at him, were he lay in the mud at his feet. I knelt beside him, with some difficulty, to check the condition of the man. As I did so, I caught a look of rare anger on Holmes face, that unsettled me.
The coals in the fireplace had burned down, warming the room, but failing to lighten it.
''Here, let me help you. No, don’t move.'' I rolled him over, until he was freed from his cocoon. Then I helped him back to his feet.
It seemed, as if he hadn’t realised, that I had awoken as I had opened my eyes.
I turned to lay on my back, looking at the ceiling above me. ''It’s fine, old fellow.''
She set the tray down upon the only free surface of the table, tended to the fire and left, not without a worried glance in Holmes direction, however and one in mine, a silent plea, that I may look after him.
I myself am not a man of thought however, rather of action and so I set down my teacup and went over to him, determined to free him from this dark place.
''It’s no use, there is not enough data!'' he exclaimed.
''Watson! Were are you?''
''What have you done with my Tobacco, Watson? I need my Tobacco to think, Watson! Get me some Tobacco! Watson. Watson. Watson, do this, do that, so typical!''
The seventeen steps seemed rather like seventy.
There is a man. He is hurrying along the corridor, stopping in front of every door, just long enough that he may open it to look inside.
The moment was broken by heavy footsteps that announced the official police force and soon enough, Lestrade and his men came around the corner. Holmes explained what had happened and then excused us, for the small ally had gotten quite crowded by then.
Holmes half turned to watch me with an abstracted air.
He started, as I carefully took violin and bow out of his hands, then watched curiously from were he stood, as I put them on the table beside the tea pod.
To dispel the feeling, I called out into the gloom: ''Holmes? Holmes are you there?''
I picked up my medical bag with my left and took my walking stick in the right hand, then his wife accompanied me to the door to see me off.
Stepping outside, I noticed just how cold and dark it had become.
It was dark inside.
He stopped and turned to me, as far as our interlinked arms would allow.
I hurried on, in hopes that he would lose interest in me. He followed me, however, speaking in low, confidential tones. I tried to ignore him, but it didn’t really work.
Even though I had quit medical practice for some time now, I still visited old friends if they needed my help and would accept any emergency case that was send my way.
Suddenly, there is warmth and a voice, filling his lungs with air.
I got my kiss and without a soul to interrupt.
The heavy snow outside, now lay like a cold blanket, muffling all sound, while the soft crackle and shifting of the coals in the grate, provided a contrast, that served only to pronounce the silence.
After a short wait, Mrs Hudson opened the door and as she did so, a wave of light and warmth greeted me.
''Watson, whatever are you doing?''
Slowly, I could feel the tension draining from him and his body relax.
''Watson, what are you doing in my bed?''
''It’s not yet 6.00 a.m. and you might still get some sleep.'', then, quite without thought, I added ''Unless of course, you want to stay?''
''I know what he said and I don't care. I don’t want you to endanger yourself for something as petty as that. You are infinitely more valuable to me than my reputation! I don't want you hurt.''
I was still some streets away, when it began to snow.
Lost in thought, I wasn't paying any attention to what was going on around me. When I suddenly heard an unfamiliar voice to my right side:
To my relief, there seems to be nothing standing or lying about, which could cause me to stumble and fall.
ink_stain
Anyway, it was nothing serious, he would be well in no time and that was really the only thing that mattered, I thought, while putting on my scarf, hat, coat and finally, my gloves.
With clumsy fingers, I searched my pockets for the keys, without finding them however.
Perhaps one of the most unexpected things that I discovered about my love, is that he enjoys it tremendously to cuddle up beside me and do nothing for hours on end.
I was finally warm, I was home again.
I stopped for a moment, waiting for my thoughts to catch up to the situation. This afforded me the opportunity, to get a good look at the man, or as good as was possible, in the dim twilight between street lamps. He was well dressed, as far as I could make out and held himself like a gentleman, but there was an air of cruelty about him, that I could not quite place. Maybe it was his awful smile, that made his eyes seem all the colder. This was not a man by whom you would want to be recognised.
He in turn, sidestepped him, spun around and added to the other man’s momentum by pushing him between his shoulder blades, with the head of his cane. The villain, unable to stop himself, ran headfirst into the wall, against which I leaned and which had been at Holmes back a moment before. He sunk to the ground with a groan and lay unconscious.
''The famous Mr. Holmes! What honour!'' our foe growled out from between clenched teeth ''Come to save his pet, I see!'' and with that, he lunged for Holmes throat.
He wore his old dressing gown, tightly drawn around his thin frame and holding his precious violin hugged close to his chest, bow in hand.
''Never mind who I am, be off with you.''
As he departed, I walked the few steps up to the door, now with a pronounced limp.
''You’re not hurt my dear fellow?'' I knelt down beside him. He huffed angrily.
Instead, John heard stalking, stomping footsteps behind him as he went to the bedroom they did use (very well). As John hoisted the old wooden windows open, a blast of frigid mountain wind howled in. “New Years Eve, Sherlock. Tradition. We’re having ham and cabbage and greens and black-eyed peas tomorrow too, because that symbolizes money, and Mrs. Hudson will probably put silver in the cabbage, so mind you don’t swallow it.”
"It's a collaboration with Norton, hear that guitar? It's about his addiction and getting clean."
"Well, you don't have to go on me," John said. "But if you want to...that'd be good. I'd like that."
him, seeking everywhere Sherlock's pulse could be found surging hard: his neck, his chest, that glorious, growing handful between his legs.
"Oh my god. Did you meet him at a truck stop?"
"You barely let me help at all!"
It wasn't just that Sherlock had come home stinking of skunk spray like a bad dog, trying to walk right into the house as if bringing home an acrid, eye-watering reek was just a normal Sherlock day. (Some things he liked to play with smelled almost as bad and were actually dangerous.) It wasn't just that he didn't even care to change his clothes.
"I just don't belong here, Sherlock," John said. "And these people - they're not shy about lettin’ me know it."
Arthur was a sullen young man, in a specifically wealthy sort of way, but the look on his face was dogged and harried.
"It was for a case."
The moonlight on the snow was too bright to hide in. He listened for footsteps, the distinctive snow-crunch of human boots. His eyes scanned - rock outcropping, rhododendrons, tall tree stump. Nearly to the creek, there.
John had to ask. "Do you need to, uh?"
"It's okay," Holmes said. "You can say it's the Met. It's on your tie-tac for heaven's sake."
Mycroft took a deep breath. He commanded so much power of perception, and yet even his skills could be so easily undone in the face of real pain. Right now, he truly hated the masters he served and the thugs he commanded.
with a man that's the real challenging new frontier.
He’d weathered Sherlock’s piercing study of the scratches, the mud, the surprisingly piney-fresh scent of John’s knapsack. Even if Sherlock figured out what John was up to, he was just going to proceed as if he didn’t live with a super-genius. (But John really hoped he wouldn’t.)
"Exactly right," Holmes said.
John groaned and pressed up against him, reaching back for Sherlock's leg, to pull him harder in – only the second time he'd done this and he already knew he didn't want Sherlock to be careful or hesitant because that only drew the awkward part out longer.
“I know you don’t believe. I know you don’t feel that. I know what you’re feelin’ really hurts, though,” John said. For just a moment he let his hand rest on the small of Sherlock’s back, stole a glance at those keen green-grey eyes dimmed with unshed tears. Still stunning. Enhanced not diminished by the lines around them and the salt-and-pepper of his brows. “But I think it’ll help to play for her one more time. She never got tired of hearing us.”
Holmes leaned forward in the chair, picking at the dregs of the eggs. "He sure seems to, doesn't he? I feel bad for that boy, to be honest. You make a couple mistakes in life, and your old man always thinks the worst from then on. I'm keeping an open mind. I don't think our client here is an unbiased source."
When Jon got home to his Harlem crib, he had to think hard. The memories of the sight of his Maria in another man's arms still burned. She was right. There was no coming back from that.
They sat together, listening to the music. When it was over, she put on a Cecil Taylor side. It was fidgety, restless, passionate music. S. leaned into it, his fingers following the insanely adept piano lines.
“Aww, look at you,” John said, coming up close, hands in Sherlock’s hair. “You’re such a softy after all.”
A ficlet in 3 221B drabbles.
In which Sherlock contemplates a pumpkin, and fights off panic about just how many of his own rules he broke when he went to bed with John Watson.
"Yes," Sherlock said.
"I'm not playing, Sherlock. I mean it.
God, John could
"Cold hands, warm heart," they say. Just a little cuddling going on in the warmest bed in Arthel County.
"Only the help, and my sweet niece who wouldn't hurt a fly."
“Why did you imagine I would tolerate this for a
“You- you know - come on, do it.”
“Me too,” John said softly.
Character death.
"Absolutely. Best first step, in my opin--
, he thought.
Don't pout, John. It's his way of saying "I love you."
John pulled his hair, pulling him up into a frantic kiss. Sherlock pressed himself up against John so hard the residual wetness made damp patches on his shirt, and his tongue made a shivering ingress into John's mouth. John pressed his hand down between them and found Sherlock's cock was swelling into delicious hardness.
offended by someone’s stupidity. John turned his back on it and went to open windows in the upstairs bathroom and the dusty bedroom they never used. If Sherlock closed them downstairs, there’d be hell to pay.
"If you pardon me," Holmes said, retiring to his room. "I've gotta get dressed and do some field work."
Ah. That got him to sit up and speak true. "Errr... do you mean Jon?"
"You thought you'd find a woman who'd cook and clean and make babies for you while also being your ideal sexual partner?"
Sherlock groaned and molded himself against John's back, driving his cock in deep and moving his hips in lascivious circles as he pinned John's wrists to the bed. “So tight. So hot,” he purred. “I'm not cold anymore, are you?”
“Yeah,” Lestrade said. “Maybe I know you too well to do that.”
"I don't deny it," Holmes said.
“John, what are you doing? It’s
Jon wondered. He kept his silence. He wasn't a trained therapist, but a good doctor has to read between the lines just the same. And know when to shut it.
"Better production values but at what price? Let's keep our eye on this Moriarty empire," Holmes said with a twitch of his lips. He sat back, lightly fingering his short beard. "That's how record labels are when they get big. They want to keep getting paid, and they'll trim artists' feathers to make them conform. Irene was smart to get out and go indie."
He only stumbled a little bit on the uneven threshold, only felt a little bit uncomfortable because that dirt floor was a little too soft.
"You're really good. For sure." Jon nodded along as the song passed by. And then he lifted his head to look Holmes in the eye and, felt unusually open, so he asked: "Why you never played for me?"
“Sally’s always said he has to be overcompensatin' for something.”
"Just let me know," John said. "Remember, I'm still countin' on you for some payback. Or some... pee back."
Sherlock shuddered softly and leaned his back up against the tree that was just behind him. From his motions, he was remembering the feeling of John's massage. When he leaned back he took his cock in his hand and closed his eyes.
that apparently, if worked to a sufficient state of exhaustion, the great detective had the ability to fall dead asleep with a dick in his mouth. (Not a small one either, thank you very much.)
Holmes swiped over to NuTube on his phone. A few taps, and he'd pulled up a song. He paired it to his Bluestruth speaker
"Uh...sure. Thanks, bro."
"Not here, though," Sherlock said. "The moon is bright, and we could be seen. We're too close to the road. Here. Let's go. We'll slog up the hill, through the brush, to that old abandoned cabin. That's where I want to fuck you."
Watson was quiet on the way back uptown. Sherlock counted down to twenty and checked his texts and bank balance on his phone. “We’re going to the ceremony of course.”
Jon's face was radiant, smiling. He was still in that elegant suit but he'd loosened his collar. And Jon was applauding with his whole heart.
John tried not to shake too hard as he laughed helplessly. Of all the amazing feats of Sherlock Holmes to share with his readers, he wouldn't be able to tell
That boast did it for Sherlock, for suddenly he was clutching John around the chest with all the force that was in him – and it was a lot, he was strong – and seizing up with a throaty cry as he shook them both hard.
Well, that wasn't subtle. John was already starting to feel the pressure just a little bit, and he was sure that Sherlock had to know that. Still, he did as he was told. Might as well make it worth his while.
"Sure didn't. You solved it anyway, didn't you?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He was in the soft chair close by, all apologies.
“For the hearse or for us?”
"Listen to this," Holmes said, smiling. "You know that voice, don't you?"
His newfangled answering machine with the cassette tape clicked on. Two exasperated groans at the familiar voice. "I know what you're doing right now and with whom, but considering the number of times you've interrupted John and myself, I'm not inclined to have much sympathy. The third beaver lodge downstream of the North Fork of Troublesome Creek is man-made and that's where you'll find the missing head and hands."
"Well, she texted me asking if her theory was right. About my hands. So I recorded a little clip and sent it, and she asked me to play on the record. Didn't take long, it's a simple part. The song ain't about me."
How many of Sherlock’s own rules had he broken? Never bring trade home if you can help it. Never show them where you live. Never learn their last names if you don’t need to; if you absolutely must, erase when done. Don’t cruise where you live (don’t shit where you eat).
“They're predators of honeybees,” Sherlock growled, flinging tomato juice from his reeking wet hair. “I'll do anything to protect my beehives.”
Sure enough, Mrs. Hudson knocked on the door presently. "Gentlemen here to see you," she said.
“Don’t be frightened, John. They’re perfectly ordinary and harmless roses.”
Lestrade rolled his eyes to heaven. “Really? Hell, that just ain't fair.”
“Well, you do,” John muttered.
“What” - slap - “did” - slap - “I” - slap - “tell” - slap - “you?” John demanded.
Well, that was part of the thrill too, wasn't it? These hills were full of abandoned houses, as people died off and moved away and no one came to replace them.
“Radio Lestrade, then,” Sherlock sighed. “Flashlight, batteries, blankets?”
John bit it back – he meant it so much, but had no idea how Sherlock would react. Instead, he reached back to the front of Sherlock's jeans, fondling, and whispered softly, “it's beautiful.”
He shook himself, and tried to re-orient himself to reality. What he was actually hearing now was jazz. What he was actually smelling was coffee and grilled onions.
John reached up to kiss him, and murmured in Sherlock’s ear, “I only agreed to this because you promised you’d repay.”
“Of course,” Jon said.
"So you work for your brother often?"
“Of course you'll show me how,” Sherlock whispered, smiling against John's shoulder at a few more distant booms.
Lestrade was a good man, who heard the emotion in that and gave it respect. Am I a good man like that, John sometimes wondered. But in this unseasonably warm late winter evening, he felt in tune with the land, proud to provide for the ones he loved.
Jon got up on his feet and approached him close, and that was both the best possible outcome, and so very scary. When his face was cradled in Jon's huge hands, Sherlock managed to say, "I like to go fast when it doesn't matter….but I want to go slow when it does."
"Alright but one thing still sticking with me about the Irene Adlero case is...?'
John thrust himself against Sherlock’s face, eager to take whatever he could get, and thinking
As might have been expected, Sherlock shrugged off the bathrobe and wiggled up into the bed, pulling the blankets around him and John. And John thought he might have been in his case focus mode or restlessness, but something about what they'd just done put Sherlock at ease so quickly he fell asleep almost immediately.
John smirked sadly and rolled his eyes before he closed them. As if. As if there was anyone to love him. To like him. To care for him. Hell, there wasn't anyone for him to love, to like, or to care for. "No- you wouldn't have. You don't get off on committing murders." He sniffed a bit, eyes tearing up as his bandaged back faced Sherlock. His words were much quieter when he opened his mouth again. "Just get off on hurting people." He pushed the sidebar with the morphine amount indication to high as he settled back and for the first time since leaving Sherlock, he felt safe enough to sleep.
A high pitched, disbelieving laugh ran through the doctor before filing into unbelievable fury. He gripped the phone and flung it across the room as harshly as it could, the impact leaving a decent dent in the wall. John sat with his legs over the sides of his bed, elbows on his thighs and his head in his hands while he closed his eyes.
Sherlock gave his left cheek a little slap. “I’ve got so much to give you. Been saving it up. How about you go lean up against the wall there?"
Sherlock's hands were on John as his breath quickened, opening his jeans and freeing John's cock to the air - which John was grateful for because it had been needing adjusting in his jeans for some time now. The sight of him like that, the touch of Sherlock's hand, was just enough to get him almost to where Sherlock was - and he'd been so focused on getting Sherlock to let go and give John what he wanted, he'd barely even noticed.
“I haven't seen this in years,” John said quietly. Sherlock rested his chin on John's head.
Sherlock inched forward and draped his legs over John's so they could fit together, all four hands working and blood-raged flesh meeting. Sherlock had the range of motion to grind his hips, and he did so with sluttish gusto. "Fuck," John groaned.
Jon sat back against the window, clearly thinking. Then his voice dropped, as if he didn't want the driver to overhear. "I think it is for you, though, isn't it? You want to see me looking fine because
Holder gave Sherlock a stinkeye, and then dropped his head into his hands. "I made one of the worst mistakes of my life. The repatriation decision wasn't popular among the Board. I voted against it myself, through certain proxies. But it prevailed, and we had to live by it. There was so much...disgruntlement...among the staff that I worried someone might try to compromise the board's decision. Although it is strictly against museum policy, I felt that I had enough reasons to be concerned to override that."
But, post-pumpkin, he supposed it would be the civilized thing to wash. Pumpkins were messy. And they had a scent of their own that might distract him from thoughts of the naked man in his bed.
“The part of me that’s hard is demanding your attention.”
John was more inclined to stay awake, thinking about what had just happened.
“Now, yes.”
"Are you sure?"
John wanted it bad already,
"Of course," Sherlock said, wiping his mouth and sliding back up John's body. Almost leisurely, he wriggled his jeans down and started to stroke his own cock lazily, as if he were just warming up. He gave a salacious little smirk with his slick lips and musky breath, and just let John watch the show for a little while, until John couldn't stand it anymore and reached over to give him a hand. The pace picked up and soon Sherlock was writhing, his hips rocking in sharp, urgent thrusts as John worked him. When Sherlock gave unmistakable signs of being about to come, John pulled up his shirt. Just to feel those white stripes on his body.
John emptied his can, laughing. “That’s what I said.”
Sherlock looked mutinous.
which was a weird thought, but one that almost made him come on the spot,
Lestrade made a sort of understanding grunt. Then he shook his head. “God, I can't even imagine what that's like.”
“You know you don’t deserve to come tonight, right?”
His mind was still racing from that scary gay biker Shinwell Johnson's revelations about just how far Sherlock was willing to go for a case - oh, John was not opposed to it in principle, but every new revelation about just how slutty Sherlock used to be always messed with his mind.
is a real thing!
“Tradition--” Sherlock said, about to launch into a diatribe.
And yet . . . he was not going to work very hard on the question of how to get rid of John
With a slight movement, he walked over a few inches, and sank again to his knees. Then he took his shirt off, and hurled it away out of the danger zone. He knelt there, waiting, watching Sherlock's eyes moving over his body and dilating in desire. "You have to go, don't you?"
John's vocabulary shorted out as he was wrenched a little upward to give Sherlock's skillful hand room to work on his cock, pumping and vibrating mercilessly until John came with a broken, breathless shout. The night outside erupted too: celebratory pops and bangs of firecrackers and gunshots. Might have set a vet off in a bad way if he weren't drifting in hormonal bliss beneath Sherlock, who nuzzled him contently.
The scent of clean, nearly-clear piss rose up in the steam, and Sherlock moaned as it covered his groin and thighs and ran down his long legs, fading away into clean water as it reached his feet and circled the grain. John still had a little more left, and a second, sinking jet emerged. Sherlock looked down, trying to keep water out of his eyes as he watched, mesmerized.
John could see his legs tightening.
“You're in Stanger, West Virginia, USA. The date is April 14, 1974, about 0232 hours. Easter Sunday. You left Vietnam 7 months, 8 days, and 4 hours ago.”
"And yet something terrible happened on your watch, or else you wouldn't be here," Sherlock said, with a little hint of a bitter smile.
"Watch this live video from '76, a year after that album came out. Listen to how much more real and raw this is than the version on the album."
He'd lost fair and square, and was already getting hard in his jeans when he thought about the reaming he was going to get.
Sherlock shook his head. "No. Vinegar is acidic and ammonia is basic. It's not dangerous, like mixing ammonia and bleach, but they render each other neutralized."
had stretched out to downright
"I hear you, man," Jon said. "Is a kiss okay?"
He pulled on a blue dressing gown over his naked body, gazing out at the grey stormy morning. The silk slid over his skin enticingly and reminded him of every bruise and scratch and ache he had, every streaking of substances within and without, the dark animal funk of mingled sweat and sexual secretions.
"No, unfortunately. Jon called me to the scene, and there was absolutely nothing I could find that couldn't be traced to pure callousness. There's no greater picture at all."
"No mystery for you to solve then."
"I sure did." John didn't even bother to try to put his cock back in his underwear, it was already getting stiff enough to resist caging, especially with the sight of Sherlock in only slightly more than nothing.
"Ssh. Humor me," John said, digging his fingers into Sherlock's rhomboids. Sherlock dropped his head to allow for greater access, and John couldn't resist brushing his long curls away and pressing a kiss to the nape of his neck. Sherlock gave a little shiver and leaned into John's hands running up and down his biceps through his thin fitted shirt.
"I like that violin sample," Jon said. "I didn't expect that. It's got a little jazz in it?"
John smiled a little. "We use fish eggs for bait back home."
Relief died in his chest at the red laser-tag sight flickering over his heart. Slowly he raised his hands. The tall tree stump was really a short man, who’d stood still as wood and was now collecting his reward. “You got me,” Sherlock said, frustration turning rapidly to arousal as John swaggered towards him.
good enough for our family so you're in perfect company there. And if we hadn't gotten those submarine plans back Mycroft would be in trouble and he knows it. He's showing gratitude and superiority at the same time. He thinks that's both efficient and elegant. 'Oh, brother mine, you've barely touched your caviar!'"
“Sure did,” John said, rocking up slowly and running his hands up Sherlock’s back. “I ain’t gonna lie, that scared me, the first time you told me -
John thought, almost crying as he buried himself in the strong life force of Sherlock's body.
John and Lestrade go fishing and talk man-to-man. John is better understood and accepted than he knew.
The sky was fading, full moon rising over the crest of the mountain as John squelched through the thawing black earth with his cooler full of ice and trout. Mrs. Hudson’s house was awash in golden light just before the hill shadows fell. Up past her driveway he could see the lights on in the big farmhouse. Sherlock was home and awake then, and up to Lord knows what.
"To your work?"
"He's facedown on his bed," Sherlock said. "He was working for hours to save a patient. 14-year-old boy. Bicycle. Hit by a drunk driver."
A motion. A very slight one, but she jerked up.
Out of their little band it was John who’d turned out to have the high-lonesome tenor that could wail like winds through tombs. But they kept her favorite old hymn joyous, as she would have wanted: John’s guitar strolling, Sherlock’s fiddle soaring, and Lestrade’s still-nimble fingers leading the charge to heaven on his banjo.
by W.B. Yeats. A lot of anger and survivor's guilt in that poem.
"As a filthy fuckpig?"
The creak of wood, strained and rocking. Heavy breathing. A rhythmic swinging and slapping. A grunt, an intake of breath sharp and sudden.
His fingers trailed. The touch lingered.
"I know and I should have. I'm asking now though. Don't have to be right now. Just letting you know I'm interested. Should have done it sooner."
that's good," Sherlock groaned, his eyes flying open to take in John's wet torso and pose of complete acceptance.
it, deep inside; he squirmed and moaned, shoulder pinched by Sherlock's teeth. “Man, did you just . . .?” John said fondly. “We've gotta work on your endura—
Sherlock had once almost given it up for George Burnwell. Burnwell was a player, and one of the worst of the type. If he could, he might have tried to rescue Mary Holder, the niece in question who was obviously the one who had let him in to do the job, but he knew that she wouldn't want to be rescued. He approached Burnwell with a blacked-out card. It was lucky for him that Mary had expensive tastes, and the amount on the card was high. Holder had said, no expense too high. (Sherlock had insisted, no bitcoin though, you cannot rely on that shit. Real money backed by a real bank or get the fuck out.)
I pulled the door shut behind me, with such force, that I myself jumped, as the door shook in its frame.
A sigh from the direction of the window. ''I am here my dear fellow.''
By then he had already walked some time beside me and when I looked around me, I found myself in a small, dark allyway. At first, I hadn’t understood what he meant and what he was trying to say, but by now it had become quite clear to me and I was determent to give him a pice of my mind on the subject. I didn’t mind him insulting me, but how could I stand by and allow this villain to talk about Holmes in such a way! I am certain that he could not have understood everything of what I said in answer, for all my mumbling, but in the dim light it seemed to me, that he had understood all the most important parts, for his mouth twisted into an angry snarl, that fit his eyes much better then his smile had ever done.
''Watson? Were are you?'' There is a tone of increasing desperation in his voice. I can feel an answering panic rise in my chest. What to do? Instinctively, I climb into bed beside him, wrapping my arms around him, my body seemingly moving on it’s own.
Now, he all but jumped from my bed and being caught up in my bedsheets, he almost feel, swaying dangerously on his feet.
The sound is very loud now and very near, stopping the man, mid run. He turns, to see water burst forth from the doors he has opened.
Another sigh, but no answer.
''Come now, I’ll help you get back to your own bed.'', I said, holding him by his elbow, like I always do.
Something else is different, too…
When I circled around again, I spotted Holmes, who indeed leaned on the wall next to the window, starring out, sightless.
''Yes.'' He mumbled, looking at the ground, finally holding his attempts to extricate himself from the sheets. They were still tightly wrapped round him.

boys, and if she hears a single un-Christian word, well . . .”

(But WAS it code?)
Sherlock chugged a whole paper cup full of iced tea, and then looked up to the sky beyond the trees. The play of gold-and-green light on his face was beautiful. "Truth be told, I rather envied Shinwell's lack of inhibition in this regard," he said slowly. "This is embarrassing but - in men's rooms, when there are others around...I've often had trouble relaxing enough to relieve myself, even when I really needed to. Self-conscious. In that particular scene, in that undercover operation, I had to play the role of the piss-pig, because I couldn't possibly have taken any other. I get embarrassed and it just...can't happen."
“Just that. Just exactly that, John.”
"Shoulda trusted my instincts," John panted. "Didn't like the look of that place from the outside, I was just too damn horny."

“Do you know where we are, John?” Sherlock asked as the hearse came to a halt.
John gets a little payback when Sherlock falls asleep at an inopportune moment. Rated E. 221B format drabble.
Alex Holder let out a little sob. "I can’t believe they’re here! You're - you're too good. Too cruel. Too honest."
Moonlight flooded the room, washed in on a breeze starting to carry the scents of the first spring flowers. One low lamp glowed in a corner, not to overwhelm the silvery light.
“You missed snow?”
"Come with me," Sherlock said, whisking John out of the reception hall and into darkness. Down and down they went, through hidden doors and mysteriously unmanned checkpoints.
Jon tried not to feel a little bit of hurt - especially when Holmes emerged in a version of his usual flash that was flashier than usual. "Dang, you think that's undercover?"
Holder looked like he’d aged a decade, and he hadn’t really had it to spare. But he played the role very well, shaking hands with the Ambassador and handing over the priceless artifact, which Holmes rather thought looked to be in even better condition than it had been before.
Sherlock shivered. For a long time, he leaned up against a tree and seemed to go into his mental reserve state. It was amazing to see that, with his jeans half down his thighs and his protruding cock at half-length.
John looked at the clock and grinned. “You know what I wanna do all year. So take off your clothes and get in bed.”
There was something youthful and happy flashing across his face. Like a teacher he had a crush on had given him a gold star.

want to see that."
“No...but you can’t resist me.”
"I caught him!" Holder wailed. "I caught him in the safe room, with it in his hands - and two jewels were missing, and it was twisted and broken!"
John breathed deep. He leaned back against someone else's chest that breathed with him, voice still speaking. “My name is Sherlock Holmes and you've shared my house for 4 months and 22 days. But you know that.”
And maybe something about it made Sherlock a little bit settled. John felt that warm, long weight shuffling around in the bed, and as John wriggled just a little bit he felt Sherlock's huge hand slide across his back to his side and pull him closer. He felt Sherlock's breath across the nape of his neck, with a motion that was a little more than a nuzzle and a little less than a kiss. Oh, that was nice. He wasn't sure yet just how awake Sherlock was, if this was going to remain at the cuddle and back to sleep stage or if it was going to blossom into some lazy morning action, and either would have been fine with him, except for one nagging problem.
Quickly he padded over on his bare feet to stand directly behind John, so close John could feel his body heat, peering over John's shoulder. The stream faltered a bit, though he knew he wasn't done. Sherlock chuckled. "You were in the Army, John."
She had no choice but to laugh, richly. "Well, who else would I mean?"
"Do you think he took the gems? Inside job?"
"Sure did."There passed a long moment. Turkey buzzards kettled overhead, their dark feathers catching the golden evening sun.
She laughed. "No, can't say that I am. The poem's escaped the rooms though. Southern Baptist white ladies got it on their cross-stitch samplers and shit."
Sherlock was up on John's back, very close, arm sliding around John's waist. John could feel Sherlock nudging his hips to push John forward, hard cock in his jeans trying to get between John's thighs through two layers of denim.
“They'd be true,” John said quickly, like pulling off a scab. “You're not shocked at all, are you?”
"Well, yes. I do my best." Holmes checked his phone. "There’s someone outside who can make this item as close to whole again as makes no difference, but you're going to have to let them do their work in private, understand? Someone who has good reasons to not want to be seen. They brought a kit. They can fix it right here if you give them privacy."
Sherlock put on a false comforting mode - Jon had seen his real comforting face in action often enough to know this wasn't real. "And did anything actually happen? With the artifact?"
"So, let's talk about ..."
Sherlock groaned and his knees nearly buckled - he leaned back against the wall of the shower for balance while John stroked him off. John took a moment to slick himself up with soap, and pushed his hips up against Sherlock's, angling his cock between Sherlock's thighs. God that felt good. Sherlock's balls pressed up against his cock, velvety and rolling, Sherlock's pulsing erection in his hand, the soap making everything deliciously slick and clean. The sounds Sherlock made echoed against the tile walls and sounded deep in the roar of the water as John made him come. All over John's hand and belly, thick and white, washed away in the shower streams. As Sherlock shivered and trembled and clutched at John's shoulders, he clenched his thighs together tight, clasping John's cock in the tight space between them, and John groaned and let go, feeling hot pulses of ecstasy as he released - again, a different kind of sharp relief. He bit down on Sherlock's shoulder as they rode it out shaking.
It was actually kind of nice to think of watching Sherlock piss, knowing it was allowed. He was going to ask for that next. Now that it was apparently alright to sneak up on one's lover in the toilet - as long as he was standing and not sitting - John was going to use that opportunity to stalk the next time he overheard a wet stream.
"Is that all I am to you? Muscle?"
"Need to stretch my legs a little," Sherlock said, and John sat back to let him rise to his feet, a little bit wobbily.
“No,” John groaned, humping the mattress and pushing his hips against Sherlock's thrusting weight.
"She'll put that plastic stuff all over her furniture when we come over."
The touch of Sherlock's soapy hands was exquisite, running all over him with a glorious slipperiness, over his back and shoulders and ass, dipping down into the crack with sensuous playfulness and pushing into him just a tiny bit, just the tip, just enough to make John groan. Sherlock kissed him wildly as the hot water streamed down over them both and John melted into his arms for just a moment - before he got his wits back and grasped for the soap - don't drop it, hahaha - and felt it squirming through his fingers. He soaped up his hands and worked one between their bodies, taking hold of Sherlock's cock with a tight, sliding slickness.
John had to chuckle. "I'm sorry I don't need to pee right now."
She was rewarded. He sat back, suddenly struck speechless, his hand that was toying with one of his locs had gone still - and that in itself was worthwhile.
John didn't even care that his cock was still sticking out of the fly of his jeans, he fired wildly into the door. The door that had fused into the fleshly interior of the rest of the building. There was a shudder and an agonized squeal with each shot, from all around the house.
“You're prone to sentiment. I thought you might like it,” Sherlock said.
There was a little flush on Sherlock's cheeks that couldn't be blamed on the sun.
“Doors and windows still open downstairs,” Sherlock murmured as he moved, holding John down. “Anyone could walk in. Anyone could see you like this.”
it!” Sherlock roared.
“Oh no you don’t!” Holmes cried, and then wondered if that was a little too quick, too adamant.
“Not yet. Can I take the blindfold off?”
John gave a soft groan at the sight. He hoped Sherlock could hear the trickling sound of the little creek down their valley and take inspiration from it.
And that shot John through to the heart. "Oh, fuck, Sherlock. No. No, come on. No. That's not what I meant."
"Did I ever tell you," Sherlock said, eventually, "about a case John and I worked last year? Something happened to us on the way back from Nashville. We were followed. By some very nasty characters. And it was dark, and remote. Full moon. Oil crisis ongoing. I had...contacts...in Matewan who could help us, but we had to get there first. We didn't have enough gas and no guarantee we'd find any to buy even if we could stop. At a place with lights anyway."
“I do now, yeah,” John said. “God, those guys. I can
"Oh - oh, you're good at that, oh!"
"How is it I have even less privacy now?"
The elder Holder was gaping like a goldfish, and only turned to Arthur as an afterthought. “I’m so sorry, so sorry.”
“No.”
Sherlock allowed himself a quiet shiver, and then his mask arose and his spine straightened. Though his heart was breaking, he had a task to see through.
He might have overreached, or perhaps Sherlock was playing along, because they came close to leaning and nearly falling over the old moth-eaten couch. Sherlock made a little twist of his waist that made all the difference, and so they fell. And John absolutely did notice that Sherlock made sure they didn't land on his untrustworthy leg.

Holmes laughed softly. "Did you see how fast they peeled out of here? He wanted to meet at a private room in Mycroft's club. I thought it'd be funnier to make him come here. You can tell a lot about a man when he's completely out of his element. Don't think he gets up to Harlem much."

Holder nodded. "He's still...not good with money. Recently he fell in with a man called Burnwell, who is up to his elbows in this Bitcoin thing. Which I don't believe is a good investment, and I understand it's used for unsavory things."
A tense moment in Sherlock and Lestrade's long friendship.
He almost wished they were - that's how it is when you lose a patient. You ought to wear the marks. It's not right that you get to go home to your family (but you can't, the demon at the back of his head said. She don't want you. You're not a married man anymore. No, he couldn't go back to the family he thought he would have had.)
fine. “So ...no more. You’re sticky enough.”
"Oh shit, should I get presentable?" He'd shuffled down to the table in pajama pants.
John barely registered the doctor's touch on his arm. It was intrusive. It was pushy. Why was this man touching him? Bad news was bad enough. Why was he calling him Captain? He wasn't there. He didn't understand.
"Have you been up all night?"
“You appreciate it even more then, don't you?" John said.
Warning: light BDSM
“Yup,” John nodded. “Beef jerky, even.”
"Fine," he said. "I am Alex Holder, and if you've been reading the papers, you probably know there's a repatriation ceremony next week. A very precious artifact from Southern Asia - "
"Both," Sherlock said, smiling against John's mouth, his hands trailing down John's back and grasping two handfuls with his ridiculously large hands. "Have I told you how much I love your ass? It's ridiculous, to love anything this much. And I don't think I get enough of it. You make me work so hard to earn it."
“It’s too cold for this, John,” Sherlock said, shivering and naked with the quilt around his shoulders.
Frustrated, Sherlock pulled away, ignoring John's protests, to wiggle John's jeans down to his feet and to untie his shoes. Off. Everything off.
He saw Sherlock in his briefs, waiting for what was about to happen next. "You're a magnificent pervert," John said over his shoulder as he loosened his jeans.
“He’s not. Not
He'd thought he had Sherlock, in the meadow ringed with dark trees and the mist rising through the waist-high grass. But just one blink and Sherlock had disappeared out of his sights. John followed where he thought Sherlock might have gone, down the creek trail. And then he stumbled on a beech root - and the shot had come out of the darkness, splattering his jacket, in one sharp quick moment of moonlight.
"Mmm?" Sherlock queried, sounding a bit put out.
He pulled John roughly against him, catching both their cocks between their bellies. Sherlock was rock hard, John realized. He fucking loved this. "Oh, John," he groaned into John's ear. "You are so, so perfect." He took a bar of soap from the rack over John's head, without releasing him, and started to soap up his back. John leaned in, wary of knocking them both over.
"Of course. My brother asked me to figure out a little problem out for him, and the only person I know who had rooted out this kind of security breach before is in Kuala Lumpur. Because she has the skills, it's her time zone we work on, not ours. Eggs?"
"It must be because my attention is so much more intimate," Sherlock said, and he had to be lowering his voice to that subsonic octave on purpose, knowing damn well the effect it has.
Long sidling licks, up and down the sides of John's cock. When John started to enjoy that too much, Sherlock switched up and went down to laving his balls.
"We're in the shade," Sherlock said with a little chuckle in his voice. "And I don't think it's even 80 degrees anyway."
This was intolerable. If John didn’t wake up horrified at his own indiscretion, if he didn’t flee or even lash out at Sherlock in violent displacement of shame at his own homosexual desires, then Sherlock would be very hard put to get rid of him.
He glanced back over his head to see Sherlock standing in the doorway, an open bathrobe highlighting more than covering his nakedness. Watching intently.
John gave a little groan as he met the wall, and Sherlock's hands were on him, unbuttoning his shirt and sliding it off his shoulders, starting to rain wet, nipping kisses all the way down the length of John's spine. John spread his legs instinctively as he felt Sherlock slide to his knees, biting John’s ass through fabric even as he deftly undid the belt and fly sight unseen.
John had been in medical school and the Army, but even by those standards, this was a labor-intensive prank. It had involved a lot of hiking, scouting, snipping, and one nerve-wracking climb in a high oak tree. He was pleased that none of it was store-bought: the woods on Sherlock’s land had yielded everything he needed.
At this point, Max was curled up on the ground. He could no longer stand, it was too painful. He kept staring to Sherlock, the last sight he ever wanted to see. The only picture that was worthy to be brought with him to the next world.
The smile on John's face was beautiful. Sherlock leaned over, just breathing close to them. He didn't kiss the man, wouldn't do this without his consent, not after everything that had happened between them, not while knowing John no longer loved him. But feeling his breathing, his heart beating. It was beautiful. Sherlock stepped back after a while, pulling the blanket a bit higher, just as John had done when The Woman had drugged him- and for the many nights they’d shared together after John had finally figured out that he was not not gay. He kept talking softly, saying nonsense, creating fakes days from actual memories he had. He sat there, next to John's bed, watching the man, unable to look away.
Sherlock would.

Reading the messages, Sherlock curled up on himself. Max was sleeping on the sofa, letting the detective enjoy the bed on his own. He had insisted to stay despite Sherlock's attempts to push him away.
Max taped his thigh. "Good. That's good. That's what you deserve, da’ling."
“Work time for the grown-ups, Max. Got to go kidnap some priests. Take care of my Johnny boy, I’ll be home before he knows it!” The man bent over the unconscious ex-army man, pressing a small kiss to his sleeping beauty’s lips before pressing his fingers into the bleeding hole of ripped flesh, earning no response from the unconscious doctor. “Oh, and Maxie, patch yourself up if you can.”
As he got up and left his room, he felt even more exhausted than before having slept. He craved to close his eyes and come back there. Into his happy dream. Shivering, feeling cold, he wrapped a dressing gown around him.

And of course, we all know whose writing graced this piece that would be dreadful if I had written it myself.
Sherlock couldn't bear the sight of Max anymore. He was the cause of the loss he was suffering, and the shoes he brought with him got thrown away, under a car's wheels.
Sherlock had always hated hospitals. He hated the scent of it, and the knowledge of the pain, filling every room. But despite everything, he stayed. For John. He was safe, and now that the adrenaline had faded away... Nothing was left but the loss of the two men he loved the most. "If you have been killed there, you know what would have happened. A case worse than Jack the Ripper. A case of never ending deaths." He hated saying this, but it was the only way he could protect John's life for now. "You have friends, many friends. You are loved. Don't die.”

John straightened to his feet, able to breathe the tiniest bit now. He stuffed his hands into his coat, mentally thanking himself that he'd kept his wallet in it before running. He pulled it out and made his way to the fish and chips stand, ordering a basket and paying. Fish and chips. Nearly the only good thing about being John Watson. The doctor had no heart to eat them. He walked a ways before stopping, staring down at them before he looked around, feeling nauseous all of the sudden he made his way over to a bench with a scraggly looking man, giving his food away. He walked with his eyes closed in a random direction after- though he knew how dangerous it was to do so in London. What did it matter? Sherlock probably wasn't even looking for him. The doctor turned his lip up at the corner in a sad and betrayed smile.
Oh bloody Christ.
He had tried. John had only given him a look a look and had taken it away from him. The detective pouted, waiting a few seconds while tapping the floor with his foot, louder and louder as seconds passed. "John!" There was a resonating growl from the other side, a hoarse shout accompanying it. "John?" The detective backed away from the door, annoyance turning into fear. That night, at Baskervilles, John hadn’t been the only one fearing. In fact, some deep aversion (sadness had turned into fear) towards dogs had taken residence in him ever since he’d… since he’d lost Redbeard.

. That's how much Moriarty had broken him. But it wasn't as if Jim had starved John on purpose. The doctor had been the one to do this to himself, refusing the spider's spoon feeding more than he had accepted it. He set the bottle down after managing sips, his head slightly dizzy at how much pain that it had caused him.

John's forced himself to concentrate, using the vodka to clean the wound before ordering Sherlock to thread the thread into the needle. He reached over with his left had to grab it, his face turning red with effort. Around him, there was a puddle of blood- Max's and John's combined. The doctor ignored it and made his shot arm come up, holding the needle in it with force as he used his uninjured left hand to hold the wound shut as best as he could. After what felt like
The doctor turned on his heel, looking straight at Sherlock for what he hoped was the last time, hissing out," What do you want from me, Sherlock? I can't give you anything. I don't love you. There's nothing for you to possibly fix." It was a lie. John knew that the
Without thinking, John leant onto Sherlock's shoulder heavily, not having enough strength to hold himself up anymore. He closed his eyes as he finally felt the pain and soreness of a year of trauma, torture, and emotional conflict. His breathing quickened but lulled to a slow calm. He was with Sherlock. The doctor closed his eyes, body pressed up against his flatmate's as he dozed off to a proper rest for the first time in a year.
Most people thought that doctors made the worst patients. Not John Watson. Even before he'd been tortured, broken, etc, etc. John Watson had been a model patient. When his shoulder had been shot through the first time, he sat in his army medic room of his base and allowed for himself to be doped up and away from the pain. He had taken his medication properly. All because he knew how annoying terrible patients were. This time- it was for a different reason. John allowed himself to be wheeled away into emergency care, forced to take x-rays, and sat through all the tests simply because it gave him something to do. He allowed his wounds to be stitched up and his back to be bandaged after having his shoulder checked. He laid dutifully after it all, staring up at the bland, white ceiling as Sherlock sat beside him on a boring, cushioned, plastic chair. He had ignored Sherlock's statement and had simply followed the man, not having anything else to do.

He'd known.
He picked up his phone, realizing that there were notifications on it. He replied.
And that was why Sherlock felt more lonely than he ever felt before.
Max slid a hand in Sherlock's soft curl, kissing his pale jaw despite the grunt of protest of the detective. "Mhm... 'ts going to be fine, honey." The young man said, caressing Sherlock's forearm. "I have to go back at my flat. See you later, yeah? I'm sorry he saw." Max left, grabbing his leather jacket. Sherlock's heart was torn. He had loved John, and he had loved him more than he ever thought possible by sociopathic standards. He hadn't planned to get affected, to grow bounded at Max somehow. But he had. Emotionally, as well as sexually. The detective sighed sadly, checked his phone every four seconds. John wasn't replying. It was getting worrying. "Come back. He left. SH" He quickly typed an another message. "At least tell me you're fine. SH"
John felt fingers wrap around his wrist. The doctor was almost completely lost in thought and was paying nearly no attention to his surroundings. Though he was sensitive to his environment, he was still extremely distracted. Without the doctor thinking, his instincts would be in control of his body. John flipped into Captain mode, skillfully twisting his wrist out of the grasp, using his body's momentum created by the twist to sweep the person onto the wall, his forearm blocking their airway and his left arm raised for an offense. Captain John Watson was a mode to be feared, eyes blank and ready to kill. His eyes softened in recognition once he realized who he had pinned up against the wall. Hurt flooded his eyes before the doctor could stop it and turn it anger, leaving him momentarily vulnerable. The doctor blinked for a fraction of a second and when he opened his eyes again, they contained nothing that could be classified short of brick-like, his walls having been put up again.
"You're going to need at least one, probably more," Holmes said, completely reasonably. "And part of this is yours. Fair and square."
"You know when it's me and when it isn't," Holmes said. "I'm sorry if I scared you though."
John was strangely touched. "And here I was thinking it was some kind of animal scent-marking thing."
"MMMphh?"
"But he's desperate. He was being too coy about the item damaged, and about his weird family situation, don't you think?"
"You knew that already," John said.
Lestrade laughed. “Well, they say fish is brain food.”
sheltered," Holmes chuckled.
"Oh good," John said. "That's it, you can do it. Just let it go."
"More than I'd like. Got another one of his problems coming in about 20 minutes in fact."
, which is something you used to do a lot."
"Interesting," Holmes said calmly. "Who else is in your household?"
like it, then,” he all but purred as John slid his feet up the back of Sherlock’s calves.
"No, of course not," Sherlock said. "You're a sharp observer in your own way. But I'd rather talk about anything else, please. Did you pick Cecil because you knew he was queer?"
and applied a different method. “I know who died in your dream, John. Take whatever proof you need that it was false.”
"I have a home safe. I was desperate to prevent theft. I thought it was possible some of my...coworkers...who objected to the transfer might make an attempt to do something rash -"
“Been meanin' to tell you, John,” Lestrade said as he speared a fat nightcrawler on his fishing hook. “A couple single ladies asked if I know you well enough to introduce 'em.”
“Not Vaseline,” Sherlock said, taking hold of John’s wrist and removing the jar. John groaned softly, because he was just waiting for Sherlock to say it: “I don’t like the taste.”
(“Damn, man, leave some fish for the tourists.” Lestrade had been impressed with the collection of silvery trout bodies John was steadily pulling out of the sleepy brown creek.
Well, no. Crotch-sniffing dog, more like. When John grasped his hair and turned his face up, he saw that Sherlock's eyes were closed at first, utterly rapt, and when he opened them, his pupils were so wide they nearly took out the ice-blue around their edges. "Thank you," he finally said.
New Year's Eve, '73/'74. John teaches Sherlock a little respect for tradition. By positive reinforcement.
“You mean with a man in general, or with him in specific?”
He was tempted to forego the shower and treat Sheriff Lestrade to the full bouquet later.
“Yes! Yes, I do!”
At the sound of their code words, Sherlock pulled away immediately, and started to help pull John's jeans back up. "What's wrong?"
"I apologize," Sherlock said quietly. "Just...sometimes I wonder."
Jamie pointed the gun at John, herding him towards that dark pit. “You want to be with him,” she said, aiming the revolver between John's eyes. Yes. Yes, John really did. He closed his eyes and waited.
Sherlock seemed lost for words, and John stepped up into the zone of his body warmth and took both his hands.
"Finish up that beer quick, John," Sherlock said with a little twinkle in his eye. "And then drink another one quickly. I'm going to go get in the shower. Come and join me when the sound of the rushing water gets to be too much."
“Mmm. You like my neck, don’t you?”

“Do whatever it takes,” Mycroft Holmes said, “ just know that cameras will be on you. The demonstrators will have theirs and we will have ours.”
The strawberries were so fresh and succulent - and so was Sherlock in that porch chair in the moonlight. John bit off a tip and came around behind him, running it down Sherlock’s long throat and bending over to follow the juice with his tongue.
"Umm...yeah, when I was younger, but that we both know that's not gonna happen."
"Three minutes into the last track," he said. "I didn't mean to impose, I just wanted to hear the music."
No warnings to speak of, except long-ago offstage NPC death, and memories of graveyard sex. Mature rating.
Jon was glorious in his finery, sipping from a small glass of their shared bourbon. Eyes locked on each other. Sherlock relaxed his shoulders, tossed his long locs, and lifted the violin up. He started out with a bit of Bach - mathematical and impressive. Memories of childhood lessons, baked in and unforgettable. A bit of brooding Beethoven and melancholy Mahler.
by Alice Coltrane.
Sherlock’s hands gripped the bedpost, white knuckled and straining. He was shirtless and his skin reflected the light as his back arched, and he jerked with each blow.
“No running after them alone,” Sherlock groaned. There were tears in his eyes, and the jeans he still wore constricted his cock painfully.

If John were a completely good man, he might not have given in to temptation. But he was only a
The parts of John’s body he’d had so little time to explore. What the backs of his thighs and the crease of his arse might taste like, feel like under his hands, jiggling with a little slap. How long it would take him to come in Sherlock’s mouth, in his hand, clenched between his thighs - and so many variables to explore under so many different condition: speed, heat, suction pressure, friction, length and intensity of prior foreplay. If (barely-bisexual, women-watching) John truly wanted to learn all the ways of pleasing men . . . of pleasing Sherlock specifically. If John would be willing to put on a show of self-pleasure and let Sherlock observe. If John might be receptive to being receptive. The nape of his neck, the dip of his spine, the swirls and whorls of the bullet scar, the psychosomatically injured thigh that could still spread and lift, wrap around Sherlock and grind against him. The choke of his voice, hitching breaths, whether he would respond to a hand there clutching his neck, whether he would be aroused by binding Sherlock’s wrists, whether he would possibly want more, so much more, as much more as Sherlock wanted if he didn’t tamp his own beast of a sex drive down into its iron cage and only let it run under very specific circumstances...
He tried not to shake so hard with laughter as he aimed his cheap little Kodak and clicked. “Good thing they haven't invented film that captures smell.”
Very carefully John eased himself out from Sherlock's lax jaws, placed a cushion under Sherlock's head where his thigh had been, and drew the wool afghan over Sherlock's half-clad form. Then he very slowly lifted Sherlock's magnificent hand up to that sleep-sweetened face, and carefully inserted the thumb between his pink lips, which closed around it in childlike reflex.

John looked around, squinting, at the spring-wakening woods. It looked familiar, but he couldn't place it yet. Sherlock reached in the big bag between them on the front seat, and to John's surprise, pulled out bunches of flowers. He handed one to John and led them down the overgrown forest path.
Lestrade just nodded. “That's what I thought.” For just a moment, he looked nervous, afraid of offending. “Not sayin’ I've heard any rumors about you and Sherlock, but if I did--”
"No," Sherlock said. "At the moment, no. You said you'd come back to bed, didn't you?"
“I know that,” John said coldly. “I'm a doctor too. Paternal chromosome damage. Agent Orange. Spina bifida.”
John surprises Sherlock for a change. Holiday 221B inspired by the fantastic card Corpsereviver2 sent me!
"A what?"
Jon took his dishes to the sink, and was only a little bit surprised when Holmes swung by close and reached up to pat him on the shoulder. "Don't worry about me."
Holmes was in the kitchen of all places, trying to do his best to cook a breakfast. His best wasn't very good, but Jon appreciated the effort.
One day later, Sherlock texted Holder and insisted on coming to his house. With Watson. He roused Jon out of bed with some vigorous shaking, called his under-the-table jewelry artist, and hailed a Youber.
Then Sherlock's brow furrowed. "Oh," he said, and his eyes went wide. "Gravity."
I wouldn't have thought . . . ”
Jon studied his face for a long time. He'd wondered if there might be something going on with him and the clever little singer, but she obviously was all about her own man - who was definitely a huge step up from that King fuckboy even in his homeless junkie days. And Holmes's little smile was focused very much in the here and now in ways that made Jon's head spin to think about too much.
"You do have a little bit of a chip on your shoulder."
"Yes. A priceless jeweled headpiece, obviously worn by someone very important long ago. It happens to contain a large number of good-sized and valuable stones, and if even one went missing it would be a disaster. The integrity of the piece as a complete art object is vitally important to its value. I can't abide even the hint of scandal. I've held my position honorably, I've never even had the whiff of anything unethical about me. I can't stand it.
"What...what the hell?" Sherlock demanded, half out of breath as they finished closing their clothes up and ran like racehorses.
The spot they had chosen was secluded, surrounded by tall pines and shielded from the sun. The ground was naturally weedless and coated in an almost plushy bed of old pine needles, and the scent was rich and fresh. The mountain started to rise more sharply at this point, but they'd found a natural flat area.
"Oh no no, there's more to it than that," John said. "I know there is."
“‘Cause I put the mistletoe inside. In the back.”
When Sherlock at last emerged from sleep and saw John’s handiwork on his vintage hearse, his poleaxed, horrified expression was everything John had hoped for. Pine and spruce and hemlock garlands festooned it, and sharp shiny holly was wedged into every outer crevice.
Holder suddenly fixed him with a shocked look. As if it had never occurred to him that Holmes might say no. He gulped like a goldfish for several seconds, and then composed himself to bring out the charm, and the checkbook that had always served him well up to now. "Thank you! Money is no object of course. Whatever you require. This is a matter of honor, which is priceless."
“Even if I tell you I want you to fuck me?” John asked.
"Of course," Sherlock said, closing up his own stained jeans and, as usual, standing around watching and preening while John did the work of packing up their picnic leftovers. "Not taking those to Mrs Hudson's yet, I assume," Sherlock said, gesturing at John's jeans.
“Diabolically clever, John. Oleander, daphne, and the exquisitely formed and deadly leaves of the castor bean plant. The trappings of romance, focused toward death.”
"Not until I've let them had a good long soak in vinegar, that's for sure."
"Joe Venuti influence for sure," Holmes said noncommittally, and there was more than a bit of a knowing smirk in there that Jon was finally learning how to read. That meant Holmes wanted him to notice something. Jon really put his ear into that violin sound, and it was superficially snappy and flip - but there was something sad in its tone as well. Unexpected soul.
with a stretch and burn.
He was really pissed at himself, because he ought to be more used to losing patients by now, but damn, that poor boy could have been Omare, just a few years older. And he'd had to hear a mother's screams. You don't get a sound like that out of your head. If you want to stay human, you shouldn't.
Sherlock laughed, and looked into Jon's eyes with a little crinkle. "Oh, you calling me out now?"
"I wanted to see you fuck a pumpkin," Sherlock said, completely blasé.
Sherlock blinked for a second and then complied, launching himself with his heavy hiking boots first, with the full force of the martial artist he was. John kept firing above and around him. With a horrible sound of tearing meat, the door eventually parted, strands of gristle still keeping it from opening entirely, but coming to himself at last, Sherlock grabbed John, and with all his force, shoved him through into the clear air. John didn't let go of his hand, and pulled Sherlock behind him as the door slammed shut.
The water was starting to run cold.
References the same ballad the story does. "Get down, get down, little Henry Lee, and stay all night with me . . ."
Sherlock scoffed. "Of course not. It was a perfectly respectable abandoned loading dock in the Meatpacking District."
Holmes swallowed then, hard. "I didn't know you wanted me to. You never asked."
Holmes whirled into his bedroom, pulled out the concealed violin, and did the fastest tuning job of his life. He had a tone app on his phone. The bow needed rosining too, but he'd do that in front of Jon since the motion was suggestive.
John nodded and gave Sherlock's thigh a squeeze, and crept around behind him. Sherlock spent way too much time hunched over his books and his notes and his microscope. Shoulders like that shouldn't be allowed to hunch so much. John began to massage at the base of Sherlock's neck, seeking out knots and working them through - deep, but careful. The scent of Sherlock's hair tickled his nose, and he nuzzled in.
"Do you have information?" Holder said uncertainly.
Holmes finished his piece, resisting all impulses to end it before its time out of his nervousness. Let it take its own time. He closed his eyes and erased his surroundings, to stay into that zone to do the music justice.
Sherlock snickered and then slithered off John and let him escape the bed.
"Indeed. I'll be in touch about what I need to do. I'll need to visit your home and speak to everyone, including the help. I'll also do my own research among my contacts, which I suspect you don't have much access to. We'll get to the bottom of this."
Mrs Hudson sighed. She loved Alice because Alice was a survivor, and very underrated. Oh, she hated the crack and the smack and what they did to her people, but she'd never believe there was anything wrong with a little ganja, so she indulged. She got absorbed in the opening track - the swaggering opening riff, the whole long 15 minutes with that sexy sax, Pharoah Sanders on the right channel and Joe Henderson on the left. A good music journey, and she felt safe enough to lean into it in her own store.
"Doctor Watson." Mycroft said quietly. It wouldn't be much difficult to push John away if he tried to hurt him. He was perhaps a soldier, but Mycroft was a Holmes. And not sounding calm would only make him feel angrier anyway. "Of course, I knew. I just didn't see the point to tell you. It's my brother's privacy, after all." He  said it with a smirk. Privacy was an abstract concept for anyone who knew either Mycroft or Sherlock. "Should I add that your relationship with him made my brother happy?" It wasn't about this. Obviously, it wasn't. Sherlock thought Max had just been a random lover, but Mycroft knew better than that. He had read him, found his other identities. And that, he hadn't told his brother about. "You truly shouldn't be angry like this. It's just sex.”
"Well, they didn't exaggerate. You're good. I'm so glad."
To be ready to go is a blessing - to learn how is hardest for the ones left behind. Music helps. 221B format.

“I like your everything.” John fed the rest of the berry into Sherlock’s mouth and groaned as those soft lips chased his fingers and sucked. John reached down with his other hand into Sherlock’s shirt, caressing his chest.
“That’s surprisingly thoughtful of you,” John said. He knew he was starting to get that cow-eyed lovesick look, and he didn’t even mind.
Sherlock stood at the bottom wearing that venomous expression he got when he was
John's getting a little hot under his blue collar, so leave it to Sherlock to take the sting off. (Sherlock and John, I think, are rather unreliable narrators when it comes to Mycroft).
“. . . a terrible beauty is born.”
"You can listen to music anytime you want. Where's your man?"
"Not this time, man. I'm gonna be undercover. And you gotta work. Keep your phone on though, I'll be in touch when I can."
Take comfort knowing that this is an AU of an AU, and did not really happen, not in this 'verse.
