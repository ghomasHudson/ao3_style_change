Dean laid out the plan for the night.  “OK, Harry, you and Ed are going to help us salt and burn the bones.  Ed should be back here soon.  Call him and tell him to bring working clothes for you.”  Harry nodded and walked off to call his friend.  “Melody, you should be safe here.  We’ll put down a salt ring that the spirit can’t pass through.  Just stay in the ring and you’ll be fine.”
Now, with the added pressure of a nearing wedding date, Sam was hoping that he could have a stress free visit with his brother. He loved that he and Dean had kept this tradition of meeting once a week for drinks. Dean could almost always cheer him up. It was always fun giving Dean a hard time about his endless pop culture references and ridiculous jokes but really, he kind of enjoyed them (but he would deny that vehemently if anyone ever asked).
Castiel thinks for a moment and begins, “Did I ever tell you about my first regional competition? I was just a kid and I was scared to death. Everything went wrong. I was wearing this all white costume and I was so nervous I threw up my red slushie and let’s just say it didn’t all make it into the trash. So my costume was a mess. Then, the lace on my skate broke and all my coach could dig up for a spare was some pink sparkly thing he borrowed from another skater.  Sadly, it matched my slushie stains.”
Castiel has never had much of an interest in hockey.  He had grown up around plenty of it, of course.  Frequently his ice time would be scheduled before or after hockey practices.  He would quietly find an isolated corner to change his skates, trying to steer clear of the boisterous young men around him.  Sometimes they were nice, other times they weren’t, but Castiel was always self-conscious.
The situation had him working distracted, which is never good, especially since he was elbow deep in the engine of a ’78 Chevelle that was absolutely refusing to cooperate, its bolts rusted together through the years. He gave one final angry shove at the stuck wrench and the rusted bolt finally squealed its objection as it budged from its spot, but the wrench slipped and his hand lurched forward and slammed against the sharp edge of the engine block, leaving a gash along the back of his wrist and a swelling bruise.
“Naw, I can do this. Just… distract me,” Dean says, turning away from the mountain to face Castiel.  “Talk to me, Cas.”
“I know, right?”  Melody looked up at him through tear filled eyes.  “Castiel is the one who saved Dean from hell.  He rejected millions of years of training and even torture to rebel for Dean.  He chose Dean over his own family and he was even willing to die for him multiple times.  And even in that one book when Dean went to the future, Castiel stayed with him and gave up his powers when the rest of the angels left.  How can anyone not see how much Castiel is in love with Dean?”
Dean can’t stand the tender, open look on Cas’ face and falls back to his usual comedic responses to ease the tension, “Nope.  Rookie here.  Looks like you’re gonna be calling the plays.”
He huffed a small laugh, “Not exactly. I really just wanted to fly. I became very interested in flight as a young child. I don’t know why. Something about flight just clicked with me and it was all I ever really wanted to do. The freedom of floating high above the earth just spoke to me. This may sound strange, but I sometimes feel like I belong in the air, like I am more comfortable there than on the ground.”
“That’s… odd. But my brother does have an odd sense of humor. I’m sorry, can I help you with something?”
“You’ve already met her. She is parked outside.” Dean smiled at his joke and sucked on Cas’ earlobe.
Once they are alone again, Cas leans close to Dean and says in a low voice, “Dean, I think Claire’s teacher was under the mistaken impression that we are a romantic couple.”
“I’m afraid that we need to keep you here overnight for observation.  I understand that this is important to you, but your health is more important and we would rather have you ready to compete on Monday.”  The doctor’s stiff exterior softens just a bit as she almost smiles and adds, “We are all rooting for you, Castiel.  You need to get better so that you can win the gold for Russia.”
He hollowed out his cheeks and sucked as he increased the rhythm, placing one palm flat across the man’s stomach, grounding him. Dean finally couldn’t take it any longer, he brought his hands up to Cas’s head, reveling in the motion of their bodies moving together. “Cas, oh God, Cas. I’m close. Shit! Cas!”
He decides it's best to not put Castiel through that. He'll play Crowley's game and, who knows, maybe if he ignores his attraction to Cas he can just be friends with him because, even though he knows he has nothing to offer romantically, he just can't bring himself to cut off their friendship completely. It's crazy that someone he has only known a few days has burrowed so deep under his skin. No, he decides, there's no way he's giving up being friends with Cas. He'll just have to keep it platonic.
At first, he made no move to let Dean know he was awake. He was too content. Maybe this was still a dream because it almost didn’t seem real. Slowly, he sat up and turned towards his companion. Dean turned to him and flashed a grin that took his breath away. “Morning, sleepy head.” His smile extended through his eyes, that were a stunning shade of green as they reflected the bright spring hues around them. Castiel was mesmerized with the way that smile caused the little crow’s feet around his eyes to wrinkle up.
“Shit, sorry,” Dean apologizes, “I shouldn’t have intruded. This is your room and I… fuck. Just… sorry. Um, I’m a… fan… and-”
Dean is surprised when Castiel’s anger seems to fade and he looks down at the outstretched hand then up to his face.  Those damn blue eyes are looking up at him with an expression of… hope?  He can’t believe this guy is willing to put aside everything and just start over.
“They were due to come off soon anyway.  You suffered a significant injury.  This is a bit of a nasty crack in your chassis.  You will need to be patient and let your body heal itself the way it was designed to do.  We just need you to give it time.”
Dean’s hands slid down Castiel’s back and pulled in when they reached the small of this back, crushing their bodies together before sliding up under Castiel’s shirt to finally explore skin.  Castiel’s hands were still in his hair, gently grabbing small handfuls, causing shocks of pleasure to wash through Dean.  Castiel moved forward, pushing Dean back against the door, surprising him with his eagerness.
Once the awards ceremony was over, the mood in the competition hall changed as the after-party reception began. Castiel sat at the table and looked around in satisfaction. Everyone he loved was here and he reflected upon how his life had changed. A few years ago, he didn’t know that any of these people existed. Now, Dean and all of the people who orbited around him, had become his life.
Naomi hums and takes some notes before telling Castiel, “It’s alright.  It has only been a couple of hours.  This may be a temporary side effect of the swelling or the fluid in your ears.  Relax now.  I will prescribe an antivert for the dizziness and see if we can’t get that cleared up.”
“Naw, I just,” and that’s when Dean reaches up and pulls his mask up, “he said you’d be cool with… meeting me. I’m Dean, by the way.”
Sam tries to give Dean his most supportive look and knows his brother well enough to know that a joke may help. "Yeah, just, uh, spare me any details that will give me nightmares."
The man turns around and Castiel notices that he is young, probably his own age, maybe a bit older, with strong broad shoulders covered in at least three layers of clothing. His brown hair is cut short and spiked on the top, and he has what can only be described as a perfect face. Sharp, green eyes over freckle-dusted cheeks focus on Castiel as the man’s arms swing out wide, incredulous.
He still feels terrible, though, knowing that he is going to go get ready to march in the Olympic Opening Ceremonies while Castiel is stuck lying in a hospital bed.  An idea comes to him and he pulls out his cell phone and dials the number of Inias, a teammate from back home who is playing for Russia at these games.
Just then their conversation was interrupted by a knock at the door as a pretty woman with dark hair came into the room.  “Is this the right place to be for costume fitting?”
“It’s the neck injury, Dean.  We really don’t like to take risks with that.  We can’t force him to do anything, but we just don’t want to expose him to more serious injuries.”
Castiel couldn’t sleep. He had gotten through the day alright but knew that tomorrow would be so much worse. Tomorrow would be three years since his life had fallen apart. Three years since he held Balthazar’s broken body and wept. Three years since he had been forced to leave a job he loved because they found out who he loved. Three years since he had touched the sky.
But her face is what caught Dean's breath. They had managed to find an actress who had Cas' features but on a softer, feminine face. She had those same soft pink lips and an unruly mass of dark curls tumbled over her shoulders, framing her high cheeks. But her eyes! She had Cas' kind, inquisitive blue eyes that held him transfixed. "Holy shit," he breathed out before he could catch himself.
“That’s what we are going to find out,” Sam told her.  “Get some rest.  We are going to find out who did this to you and stop them.”
Sam smiles at his dumb brother, “Then I’d say both of you are very lucky and found something special. We don’t get a lot of wins in this life, Dean. That’s why I never gave up on Eileen. When you find something good and real, hold onto it. And I’d say both of you have earned some happiness.”
OK, so, hockey is pretty much my favorite sport.  If you don't watch it, seriously, try going to a game some time - it's a fantastic sport (don't try to become a fan by watching on TV - its NOT the same).  Anyway, hockey has a very colorful and unique vocabulary all it's own (its part of the sport's charm) so whenever I use hockey lingo in the text of a chapter, I will try to put a little definition of what that term means in the end notes for anyone not familiar with hockey terms.  Hope it helps.
“Yes, please,” Castiel breathes out soft and solemn. And Dean brings a hand up to his cheek and softly caresses down to his neck and gently tilts his head and pulls him in until their lips meet. It’s short, just a soft caress but the thrill of it is nearly too much to bear.
“Dude, seriously, with the pictures already?  We’re gonna be here two weeks.  Can this wait?” Dean grumbles at his brother.
But that look never came. Instead, Cas narrowed his eyes and tilted his head to the side. Dean felt like he was being studied.
Castiel looks around the room quickly then back to Dean. “I… yes, I’m with you and you’re… it worked. You’re alive?” He finds his hand moving to touch Dean on its own, resting on his friend’s upper arm soliciting the slightest smile from Dean.
He takes one last look out over the darkened sea, no longer able to tell where the water ends and the starlit sky begins.  All the way back to his room he thinks of Castiel and it isn’t until he is turning the key that he realizes he has had a stupid smile on his face the whole time.  He quickly gets that in check, not wanting to answer any questions from Sam but it makes him realize how completely screwed he is over the hot figure skater.
Cas’ hands reached under Deans shirt and smoothed up his sides, providing soothing strokes of pressure over Dean’s ribs, up and down, massaging the muscles through his back, making the man go loose and pliant under his hands. Cas continued to work around Dean’s neck with his mouth, licking around the rim of his ear and nibbling then suckling his earlobe. Little droplets of water were occasionally falling from Cas’ hair onto Dean’s neck driving him crazy with the unexpected pop of cool against the heat of Cas’ breath and tongue.
Then he met Balthazar. Castiel fell for Balthazar surprisingly fast. He was smart, funny, sexy, and made Castiel feel a sense of purpose again. Balthazar still had faith in their mission and inspired Castiel to be a better soldier.
Dean sighed, relieved that Melody was finally catching on and getting with the program.  He tried Cas’ number again, but the phone had been turned off.  He left several more messages, each increasingly frustrated until finally Dean yelled, “Fine!  If you want to be a bitch about this than we’ll just finish this case without you.  Not like we’ve never had to do
I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for reading and commenting on this fanfic. Last chapter and this one were both difficult but I feel they were important to the character's relationship to get that elephant in the room out in the open and deal with it and to show that both Sam and Dean need to understand each other's needs and struggles a bit more. Also, I really loved writing the parts with Sam's POV before the wedding and where he and Bobby get to help Dean. Hope you are enjoying reading this story as much as I love writing it. Thanks again for all of your support and feedback!
Dean was so hard in his jeans it hurt and when Cas’ tongue licked along his hip, he couldn’t take it anymore.  He pulled Cas up by the shoulders and dragged him to the bed, pushing him down and crushing their mouths together in a blinding kiss as he straddled Cas’ hips and rubbed their bodies together, desperately seeking the relief of the friction between them.  When he pulled away and looked down at his friend Cas was smiling, fucking smiling up at him with the most smug look he had ever seen on the angel’s face.
Lately, however, they had seen less and less of each other.  Anna, older by two years, had moved three states over when she started college and the two have had to keep in touch through Skype and visits whenever their schedules matched up.  But seeing her now, here in Russia to cheer him on at his biggest competition ever means the world.
“Singer Auto Body.” He had said and waited while there was silence on the line. “Look, you want something speak up.” He didn’t have time for this. What he heard on the line was a breath and a sniff.
He can feel Sam laugh before he steps back a bit from the hug with his hands still on Dean’s shoulders. “We just took on 5 vampires, and one of them was the size of Gunner Lawless. Trust me, it has nothing to do with age.”
A few minutes later, they had arranged themselves so that Dean was leaning back on the door with Cas laying back against him, four arms tangled around Cas’ middle. Dean was sucking gentle kisses down the side of Cas’ neck and Cas leaned his head back onto Dean’s shoulder, relaxing into the attention.
When he said excuse me to get her attention, she hummed an acknowledgement to him while barely taking her eyes off the screen.  “I am looking for assistance in finding out the history of a particular movie studio.”
He looked at the angel who was standing in front of him, head tilted and damn blue eyes wide as he waited for Dean to respond.  And yeah, he realized, he did love Castiel.  OK, this was it.  He decided to bite the bullet and just tell Cas that he wanted him.  He was Dean freaking Winchester.  He had been to hell & purgatory, stopped the apocalypse, and faced a thousand monsters bigger and badder than most people could imagine.  Certainly he had the balls to just take the one step forward that would close the gap between him and Cas.
He is healed. This isn’t going to be his last day on earth. Holy shit! He’s got more time and he’s about to thank Cas when the angel collapses across his chest as Dean let’s out a grunt and closes his eyes.
"That's ridiculous! You, gay?! Everyone knows how much you like girls. Who would even believe a story like that? Why would Crowley even bother to acknowledge it?"
“I wrecked his car, though. He left it to me when he died and I was inebriated one night and I think I didn’t even care if I lived or died and I wrecked it. It was kind of all I had left of him. I couldn’t even get rid of it. It’s still locked up in storage, all mangled and broken.” Castiel couldn’t believe he had just blurted all of this out. He didn’t understand what it was about Dean that made him want to tell him his life story. He felt ridiculous for keeping a broken car and for being such a depressing mess.
Kevin coughed, “Well, I translated the part that contained the spell that Metatron used to make the angels fall.  It seems like God created that spell as a way to join his two favored creations, humans and angels.  The first part was to kill a Nephilim, which is the result of
… for Sammy,” Benny drawls as he makes eye contact with Dean and there is no mistaking the unspoken communication between the two old friends.
Dean looks at his brother, who is motionless on the ice, his helmet knocked off in the collision and his long wet hair splayed out all around.  The medical staff is already swarming and Dean stands helplessly as they try to revive Sam.
Dean smiled at this. He liked that Cas had a way of saying fuck you to the world in the most polite way he had ever heard.
“Listen,” growled Dean, “you can’t call us by our real names while we are here.  We just want to destroy the vengeful spirit and get out of here.”
"I just, I just need some time, Dean. This is a lot to deal with." And with that he leaves. The sound of the door clicking closed is enough to send a shiver up Dean's spine.
"No one was aware of a scenario like that, however, the lighting crew may not be privy to that level of information."
Melody did as she was told and followed barely a footstep behind Dean, holding onto the back of his jacket.  He knew the spirit had to be close.  Something slammed into the front of him, nearly knocking him off his feet.  When the spirit flickered into visibility, he could see it was a woman and she was holding what looked like blue flames in each hand, which would explain the burns.  Melody screamed and practically crawled up Dean’s back.
Ed turned to Harry and Maggie, “You know what this means?  We still have a chance to get it on film.  Get the cameras ready!”
Dean turns to her and removes his left arm from Bela’s shoulder, snaps his finger and exclaims, “Hey, wasn’t that the year they went to the playoffs?”  Bela, who is pretty absorbed in her cell phone barely notices he is no longer paying any attention to her.
Cas caressed and thrust and tasted and teased Dean until his mind had lost all thought outside of the immense pleasure that his lover was giving him. Cas pulled away and leaned back to take in the sight of Dean, laid out vulnerable in front of him, ass presented. And it was beautiful. This man, whom he loved also trusted him and wanted to give him everything of himself.
Dean tilted his head and gave and almost imperceptible nod of his head, a feeling of overwhelming relief that he had the support of Sam.  His simple acknowledgement was enough.  Sam knew that Dean wouldn't want to talk about his feelings so he gave Dean the one thing that he did need; his approval.  The two brothers sat on the back on the Impala like they had so many times before, not needing to say anything, just sharing the comfortable silence.
“Dude, you gotta face this head on. You were a bad ass pilot who flew in a war zone, you can do this.” Dean placed a hand on his shoulder and Castiel relaxed into the warmth of the touch, leaning into the support. He bit his bottom lip and handed the keys to Dean.
And just like that the game goes on.  It continues as if nothing had happened.  As if Dean’s baby brother isn’t in God knows what condition in the back of an ambulance.  As if Dean’s world wasn’t just shaken to pieces.  As if the devil’s spawn isn’t sitting across the ice from him grinning like he just won the lottery.
Castiel turns the engine over and pulls out of the garage, heading north towards that quiet woods in Canada where he will once again pray for the guidance of a father who isn’t listening from the secluded park bench surrounded by thawing snow and early spring flowers.
Dean Winchester is thrilled to be the best man at his little brother’s wedding.  That is until Sam tells him that Jess has insisted they take dance lessons for the reception.  But when Dean meets the dance instructor, Castiel Krushnic, his world gets turned upside down.  The men discover that they are both Afghanistan war vets who are dealing with the aftermath of their individual experiences there.  These two broken ex-soldiers embark on a project that will help them both face their past and teach them that together they can heal those wounds.  This is the story of overcoming trauma, finding love, and facing fears and all of it set to great music.
Castiel nodded that he would go with Sam, even as he tried to keep his anxiety about the situation from showing on his face.

He rushed to his lover’s bedside and grabbed his hand. Tears fell as they whispered their last words to one another and Castiel kissed him for the last time. It wasn’t until after Balthazar’s breathing stopped and his hand fell lifeless that Castiel noticed the looks that he was getting from some of the soldiers. He realized that the game was over, it had been quite obvious to everyone in the tent that he and Balthazar weren’t just friends. It was one week later that he admitted to the accusations of homosexuality and was escorted home with discharge papers in his hand.
“Sorry, I promise, no more Psycho moments,” Dean tried a halfhearted laugh, “So, anyway, Sam and I moved in with Bobby. We were there three years when the little braniac got accepted early to Stanford. I was workin’ a couple of jobs and, I just… I think I just didn’t want to be at Bobby’s without Sam. I don’t know. Maybe from all those years living on the road, three years at Bobby’s had made me restless. And I knew Sam was going to need money for college. He got a full ride, but that doesn’t include all of his living expenses so I joined up and started sending him as much as I could. Best investment I ever made.”
His anxiety was already starting to feel a little lighter, the dreams becoming more spread out and even when they happened, it was getting easier to calm himself down by curling up in Cas’ arms or pulling the man close in his own. Yeah, Cas had helped him in so many ways and he was pinging with excitement that he could do something for Cas.
Castiel listened to Dean’s stories and felt his connection with Dean grow along with a deep respect for the man who had such a beautiful spirit and so much heart. Dean, in turn, felt a kinship with Castiel and was charmed by the man’s awkward quirks and moved by his quiet strength. Both men were quietly falling in love under the hood of the broken car.
Dean sinks back down on the bench, hit hard by the woman’s words.  Some were a little too close to home.  Maybe she was right.  Maybe he should just stay away from Castiel, not involve him with any of his own crap.  Dean’s a dropout with a history of trouble and he’s never been able to make a relationship last more than a few weeks, not to mention he’s too much of a freaking coward to come out. Yeah, she’s right.  Cas is intelligent, articulate, cultured, brave and just plain good – everything Dean isn’t.
“So, Sam, now that you’re awake, are you feeling up to some tests?  I’d like to let your doctors know that you are up.  I’ll have to call some in since it’s the middle of the night but everyone’s anxious to make sure you’re OK.”
Castiel guides him around in a small circle and tells him when to jump.  His first attempt is a failure when he lands on the wrong foot and nearly pulls both of the men down onto the ice.  The two have a good laugh at the awkward attempt until Castiel encourages him to try again.  He is again led in a circle by Castiel and when the skater tells him to he jumps with one foot while Castiel turns him so he can land on the other.
ze emotion in ze skate.  I have seen skaters move whole arena full of people to tears.  Zat,” she says as she taps her finger on his chest, “zat is somesing you never forget.”
But something had been bothering him all evening. This was one of the few times that he and Dean had been in this type of environment with family and friends. Usually their time spent together was with just the two of them where Dean was open and unselfconscious. But tonight he had found ways to avoid looking like a couple. He was frequently busy greeting guests, had made the excuse that as the best man he had to dance with the bride and each of the bridesmaids, he disappeared into the bar with a few of Sam’s colleagues to check the score of the Royals game, or he would put his feet up on the chair across the table and say that he needed a break.
And Castiel takes off his mask to reveal big awed eyes and a mouth hanging slightly open but definitely the traces of a smile behind it.
Castiel tilted his head and opened his eyes as they began to rake over Dean, taking in every curve, freckle and scar and then his hands followed, tracing the lines of his eyes, ghosting over Dean’s skin.  Dean stood, transfixed, aching to touch Cas back but somehow knowing that Cas needed this.  His long fingers traced the outline of Dean’s tattoo and ran across the line of his collar, stopping to map a scar on his arm.
“Oh no,” Jess shakes her head at Sam, “I watched the highlights of that game.  I’m not incurring the wrath of Dean Winchester.  He’s kind of terrifying,” she says with a fond smile on her face.
Dean huffed a laugh at his brother as he hung up the phone.  He never could say no to that kid.  The things he wouldn’t do for Sam.  The things he had already done for Sam!  Dean had sacrificed everything for his little brother, raising him without a mother and with an alcoholic father who couldn’t hold down a job and had to move their little family all over the Midwest every time John Winchester had gotten himself fired from another job.
Dean knew there was a story there and was immensely intrigued, but didn’t want to force the guy into anything. He knew that soldiers all had stories and most of them were not pretty. Hell, he was an expert at burying his own feelings about the war so why begrudge someone else for needing to do the same. “Well, you know what’s a great cure for a complicated story you don’t feel like dealing with? Beer and babes! C’mon, let’s head out. I’ll introduce you to the lady in my life.”
. Thought we’d help you out a bit.” Then he pauses and steps a tiny bit closer with a soft smirk. “Or maybe I’m just a sucker for baby blues,” he says with a wink.
Dean’s back was facing him and he moved quietly to take in the sight of Dean swaying and singing along with Led Zeppelin to
Castiel knows he needs to talk to Dean.  But this is a whole new game for him.  Never before has he been faced with something as awkward as being attracted to a man Anna had been with.  There is absolutely no precedent for how to handle this.
Castiel tilts his head and looks at Dean through his eyelashes, smirking as he shakes his head, “Dean, still thinking that life revolves around hockey?”
Sam and Dean easily fall into this group.  Dean squirms uncomfortably under the constant stares and whispers.  A few have asked for autographs and pictures, which Dean reluctantly but pleasantly gives.  He’s certainly used to smiling for cameras and answering questions at interviews.  He pastes on his famous smile and charms everyone who comes over to meet him.
“Gonna tell you a secret, Cas, most humans are shit at humaning too. Everyone’s just white knuckling it through as best we can. You’re doing fine.”
Dean’s brain froze up on the spot. Did he hear right? Cas was with a dude? And they were in the Army? There were a thousand questions suddenly swimming around in his mind and his heart was suddenly beating faster, chasing adrenaline through his body.
He roams around the Olympic village for a while, taking in the sights of the excited tourists mingling with eager vendors selling their tchotchkes.  Impromptu stands have been set up in a busy outdoor market where people bustle around buying sweaters, hats and scarves, flags from every country, flowers and stuffed animals, and food that smells fantastic and makes Dean’s stomach growl.
“Yeah, it’s pretty awesome,” Dean replied into Cas’ ear before sucking his earlobe and placing kisses down his neck. “I’m really glad I came down here with you.”
, fuck peace! I just know that I was miserable without you and your damn blue eyes and your nerdiness and you missing all of my references and -”
He let himself listen to the short message again, enjoying the way his name sounded on Castiel’s lips, the little hitch of hopefulness in his voice when he said he wanted to talk to Dean, the nervous breaths he could hear when Cas paused.  God, he was pretty sure he could listen to Castiel talk all day.
Dean leans back on the bench and pulls his coat tighter around his chest while he listens to Castiel talk as the evening turns into night.  It’s relaxing to watch the sky redden while the sun descends over the sea as Cas’ voice keeps him warm.  He and Castiel talk like that for two more hours.  They talk about hockey, skating, and life growing up an athlete (what life?).  Dean tells Castiel about his dad dragging two tired little boys onto the ice every morning at 4 AM and about Bobby Singer.  Castiel talks about being the odd foreign kid with no friends.  But it didn’t matter because he was always on the ice anyway.  They discuss everything and nothing.  Burgers and movies and Classic Chevy Impalas.  And Dean is shocked at how little Castiel knows about two of those subjects.  Dean carefully avoids any mention of Bela.
A moment later, Dean is lying on the bed with six feet of sexy toned skater under him.  Now that Cas has the front of his jeans undone they are loose and low around his hips and he winds his arms around Dean’s hips and under his jeans to squeeze his ass, causing their erections to rub together through their clothing.
“Naw, I hate flying. I’ll leave you to it.” He winked at Cas, who smiled back at him and mouthed the words thank you before heading off with Josie.
Dean almost stopped for flowers on the way over. That’s what you do when you’re saying sorry to girls, right? But what the hell do you give a guy to apologize for neglecting them and throwing their dead ex in their face? Fuck! He was terrible at this. He finally decided the best thing he could do was just show up and offer his honest apology and Cas would take him back and bam! Makeup sex!
Hoping that Dean thought to text him to let him know if his brother was alright, Castiel rolled over and picked up his phone, noticing that it was already the afternoon.  Just then the phone buzzed and nearly gave him a heart attack from the surprise and the spike of pain that blasted through his hung-over head.  He saw Dean’s caller ID and answered immediately, eager to find out if he and Sam are both alright.
Jess opens and closes her mouth a couple of times, at a loss for words, and Dean can’t help but grin at this girl who might just be perfect for his little brother.  She is beautiful and caring and smart and seems to really like Sam.  Maybe this is just the distraction Sam needs to keep his mind off of his injuries.
As Castiel stills in the center of the ice a hush comes over the crowd as they wait for the music to start.  And when it does, Dean feels a thrill run through his bones as the music he loves surrounds him and Castiel pushes off to begin his performance.
He heads back to his room and drops straight into his bed, face first, ignoring Sam’s question of where he disappeared to after the game.  He is afraid that if he even looks at his brother his traitorous face might let on some of the conflict that he is feeling inside.  He just needs to sleep it off.  Things will surely go back to normal tomorrow.
Dean sighed, “Cas, I wasn’t…” but he didn’t know how to continue.  He was kissing Melody, but how was he supposed to explain how wrong it felt?
The dog in question walks up to Castiel and begins sniffing at him, tail wagging furiously and he cautiously reaches out and pets the animal behind it’s ears. When he looks back at Dean the man has a grin widening on his face, “Cas, meet Miracle. He’s ours and I think he likes you.”
“Well, since this seems to be par for the course for you guys, it should be no surprise that it looks like there’s haunting on the set.  Three people that were up for the role of Castiel have been injured in unexplainable ways.”
Dean escapes the room before he has to answer another question from his little brother. His brain works on overtime wondering what he is going to say to the press, what Crowley has planned to fix this. Shit! He hasn't even done anything with Cas and now he has to stand in front of a bunch of asshole reporters and defend himself? He gears up for accusing questions about his sexuality from perfect strangers – questions that he himself hasn't really even come to terms with yet.
“Great.  I’ll text you the details and meet you later?  Oh, and Cas?  The Anna thing… not a problem for me at all.”
“Right,” laughed the actor, “and demon blood?  Pretty cool, though!  Drink demon blood and get super powers!”  He said this with the enthusiasm of a five year old watching Spiderman cartoons.
Dean went through her dressing room, searching it top to bottom for hex bags but it was clean. As much as he was glad that it wasn't a witch (he hated witches), he wished that he could find some evidence of what was going on here. No EMF, no hex bags and no history of violent deaths. Maybe this wasn't going to be quite the simple salt and burn that he thought.
“Hold still, gigantor,” Dean grumbled at Sam as he reached up to straighten the younger man’s tie. “Shit, you’re a wreck.”
Cas’ hands moved to his face, cupping both of his cheeks as he breathed, “Dean,” forcing Dean to open his eyes and focus on Castiel.  Their eyes locked and Dean could feel an electricity between them.  He didn’t know if it was the grace they shared but damn, it was better than anything he had ever felt, that is until Castiel began to rock his hips up under Dean and the feeling became even more intense.
“We were friends for a few months then… well… my dad found out about us. He hit me and forbid me to see Michael. He never looked at me the same again. And the worst part was that he punched me in the face so I couldn’t even hide the bruise from Sam. I never wanted Sammy to know about Dad.” Dean’s voice had lowered to a whisper as he recalled the memory.
Castiel sits in a little coffee shop, soaking in the strong black liquid and nursing one heck of a hangover as he reflects on his strange day.
Sam nods, doesn't know what to say. This story sure explains a lot about his brother and Benny. Wow, he even has some new respect for Dean's friend who has kept his secret for years. Dean is sitting stock still, his elbows resting on his knees and eyes focused on some random spot on the floor. Sam can feel the weight of the moment between them, it feels heavy, saturated, important.
Sam continued with his usual line of questioning about cold spots and sulfur smells only to get strange looks from the actor.  It didn’t seem like he knew anything.
Dean Winchester is thrilled to be the best man at his little brother’s wedding.  That is until Sam tells him that Jess has insisted they take dance lessons for the reception.  But when Dean meets the dance instructor, Castiel Krushnic, his world gets turned upside down.  The men discover that they are both Afghanistan war vets who are dealing with the aftermath of their individual experiences there.  These two broken ex-soldiers embark on a project that will help them both face their past and teach them that together they can heal those wounds.  This is the story of overcoming trauma, finding love, and facing fears and all of it set to great music.
What Cas didn’t know was that Dean had sent his own silent prayer to the man he had never met. Hey, Balthazar, just wanted to say awesome taste in cars… and men. Don’t worry, I took good care of your roadster, she looks like new. And I’m gonna take care of Cas, too, ‘cause I’m pretty fucking crazy about that guy so you can, I guess, rest in peace knowing that he’s with someone who really cares about him now. Uh, Dean Winchester out?
Cas brought his other hand up to thread through Dean’s hair, pulling it gently which felt glorious after a day wearing an itchy wig. Cas tilted Dean’s head so that Dean’s ear connected with his lips. The heat of Cas’ breath and the gravel of his baritone sent a quiver up Deans spine as Cas growled, “I want you to watch as I make you come. See how beautiful you are when you come apart for me?”
Shame, because that Castiel seemed like a perfect fit for Dean. He had a calm weight to him, like he was so much bigger and deeper than he let on. It would be the perfect complement to help ground Dean, who had a restless anxiety to him, always seeming to have too much energy to contain.
This could be just what they need, a two minute power play goal to gain back the lead.  Dean, Sam and Vic vault over the board separating the bench from the ice, ready to play with a one man advantage.  Sam takes the faceoff against Luc and he can hear the bastard jawing, trying to get under Sam’s skin.  Sam plays it smart, though, keeps his cool, and as the puck drops, he wins the faceoff, directing the puck right to Dean.
Castiel rolls his eyes, “Had I known a year ago when I choreographed it, that some reckless hockey player would try to kill me a few days before my short program, I might have selected that music.”
“No can do, Sammy, we can keep it light, just some drills, but we’ve got to stay sharp and limber.  We face Slovakia in a couple days.”  Dean picks up the phone, “what’d y’ say to a nice greasy breakfast for that hangover?”
“I know,” Castiel soothed and guided Dean back over to the couch. They sat there in silence for several long minutes, Dean staring at the ground while Castiel waited patiently perched on the corner of the couch.
He is pulled out of his trance by the light touch of fingers tracing the hairline on his temple before threading through his hair, massaging his scalp.  God!  He nearly purrs it feels so good.  Instead, he groans softly as he shifts and pulls out of Cas, rolling back to remove and discard the condom.  Cas untangles himself from Dean and grabs the tissues from the side of the bed to clean themselves up with.  And just like the magnets that they seem to be, a moment later they both find themselves tangled together under a sea of soft blankets, Cas’ head resting on Dean’s chest and leg tucked between the hockey player’s.
Pamela had offered to come home with him so he wouldn’t be alone, but he knew that she wasn’t really what he needed. The two friends had occasionally found comfort in each other’s arms, abandoning themselves to the physical release that sex could provide, but both understanding that they were not meant to be. She was the only woman Castiel had been with and, as nice as it was with her, he knew that he had a strong preference for men.
Dean didn't have to meet up with Melody until after her costume fitting so he used the opportunity to do a little poking around. Unfortunately, EMF was coming up clean and this set was much too large to even start looking for hex bags. Frustrated with his lack of success, he decided to head over to find Cas and see if he or Sam had any better luck.
Dean wondered if anything could ever surprise him again.   Then Charlie spoke.  “OK, guys, you’re not going to be able to just walk on set.  This is Hollywood we are talking about here, not some horrific crime scene.  Security is actually going to be tight.  So, because I’m that good, I secured all three of you jobs on set.  OK, Sam, you are James Hetfield, wardrobe assistant.  It’s perfect.  You will have access to all of the actors on set.”
And with that, Dean exploded as his hips jerked and he reached behind him to pull Cas close, grounding himself against Cas’ strong body. Cas worked him through his orgasm until his body was loose and he could barely stand. His head lulled back onto Cas’ shoulder and he turned to kiss his lover but barely had the energy for more than a touch of lips.
Maybe that’s why he was so defensive.  Well that and the fact that he was shoved up against a wall by a perfect stranger.  If he was being honest with himself he did have to admit that he was strangely affected by the hockey player.  But that was wrong, completely wrong.  He couldn’t let himself be attracted to another man who was careless with people’s hearts.  And there was Anna…
“Dean, I have no intention of seeing any of them while I am there. And if I did, I am certainly not about to pretend I am someone I’m not at this point. Plus, I believe Pamela has a date this weekend that I wouldn’t want to get in the way of.”

Josie smiled at her co-conspirator, “Yes, Dean said he wanted this to be a surprise. Now, touchy-feely moment aside, do you want to get back in the air or not? We can talk in flight.”
“Sounds like fun. Go get ‘em racked while I deliver a couple of drinks and let Mom know I’m taking my break.”
Reluctantly, Dean agrees.  He’s just too stressed out to stay here and deal with the press right now.  Jess takes him out through the restricted area so he gets to avoid them and he soon finds himself back in the athlete’s village walking towards his room.  He is anxious, going out of his mind with worry about his brother.  All his life it’s been his responsibility to take care of Sam.  Even when he has nothing to do with Sam’s injuries he can’t help that voice in his head (that sounds distinctly like his father) saying that he somehow failed Sam, didn’t do his job.  Dean has never been able to let go of that feeling and now, with Sam lying in a hospital with who knows what kind of injuries, he feels like he is losing his mind.
Thank you all for reading along and for all of your lovely and helpful comments.  They help to make be a better writer and encourage me to keep writing.
Cas nods and Dean can see the slight mischievous uptick at the corner of his mouth and he smiles back at his friend while he douses the circle. This is going to be so much fun.
With a resigned sigh, he knocked on the door, which swung open before he even got to the third knock. “I’ve been waiting for you.” Castiel looked surprised. “You didn’t think I would be up this early, did you? The Army trained me well and I never have really gotten out of the habit of being an early riser. I still like to get a little workout in before going into work,” he patted his stomach, “try to work off some of those burgers and pies.” Dean smiled at Cas, swung his duffle bag over his shoulder and locked the door before heading to the car.
Unfortunately, this distracted him just long enough to have a leg cut out from under him. He went down but quickly rolled onto his back just as the sword was coming down, missing him by an inch. As his attacker raised his weapon for another blow, he saw a sword come from over his head right into the orc’s gut, killing the attacker. It was Cas, who smiled down at Dean just as a knife appeared at his neck and made a motion of slitting his throat. Cas fell to his knees, grasping his neck and just like that he was gone.
His phone rang and he nearly dove to grab it, hoping that it was Sam and he wasn’t too upset.  But the number on the caller ID wasn’t one he recognized and he sure wasn’t going to deal with any reporters.  So he let the caller go to voice mail then a minute later clicked the icon to listen to the message.
Castiel was pretty sure he wasn’t missing anything, but kept that opinion to himself. Dean’s enthusiasm was infectious and he found himself looking forward to this day. Dean stretched an arm out for Castiel to enter his apartment.
“Good, now that you are feeling the music, I am going to be Charlie. Let me see you lead.” Castiel removed his hands from Dean’s hips and moved around to take dance position in front of him, putting his left hand on Dean’s bicep and right hand into Dean’s left. Dean couldn’t believe he was doing this, dancing with another man. It felt surreal. How was this his life?
He had spent over a month working with Cas on the car and now, the shop had felt empty without him. Dean found that he missed the companionship and missed being able to teach Cas new things about restoration. It wasn’t like he worked alone. There was Bobby and his crew of mechanics always coming and going as well as his own small team of two, which included Victor Henrickson, his body work specialist and Krissy Chambers, paint artist. Victor had worked for Dean almost since he opened the shop and had proven himself to be a valuable asset.
“Well, it looked awesome to me. You’ve seen what a mess I am at dancing. I think poor Charlie is ready to give up on me.”
Castiel thinks for a moment about how to share the experience of being a wavelength of celestial intent. It’s not something a human mind can truly comprehend so he decides to describe it as best he can.
Dean drew in a heavy breath, letting it out slowly, trying to calm his frayed nerves. He finally turned his head and met Castiel’s eyes, who could see the pain and need there that he would do anything to alleviate. He gently rubbed his knuckles over Dean’s cheek before moving a few sweaty strands of hair that were stuck to his forehead. Dean’s eyes fluttered shut as he soaked up everything from the loving touches, pulling them inside with everything he could to fill the aching hole in his heart.
“Of course, apologies.” Castiel seemed to gather his wits and got to his feet to come over to Dean, standing strangely close. “We aren’t technically open today so I was just, uh, it’s nice to have the dance floor to myself sometimes,” he explained, shifting his eyes towards the floor.
Castiel pulled Dean further into his mouth, sliding him in and out to an increasing rhythm until he could feel his lover hit the back of his throat. He hummed again, pulling a gasp from his lover’s lips.
Dean’s emotions tumble over each other so quickly she can barely tell one from the next, but shock and fear overpower the others. “What?! You think me and Cas-”
She smiles at him and she really is beautiful.  He hopes she continues to be Sam’s nurse.  At least give the guy a hot nurse to look at while he’s laid up.  “Well, I’m probably not supposed to be say this about someone getting hurt, you know, being a nurse and all, but hearing that gives me great satisfaction.”
need to find a cure. And that can wait ‘till we get you home,” Dean groans as he gets up, grumbling about his age and his painful knees. But Castiel barely registers any of what Dean says, still focused on the one word.
“Yes, showed up a few minutes after you did.  He stayed for a while, trying to get information but Meg chased him away.  I believe her exact words were that she was going to sick rabid dogs on him if he didn’t leave the premises.”
“Yeah, man. Just… trust me, I have my reasons.  He’s cool.  Anyway, get used to him. He’s covering your ass behind the blue line for the next two weeks.”
He turns to head back to his bed just in time to be greeted by a serious looking woman in a grey pants suit, shirt butted all the way up to her neck.  Her auburn hair is tied up into a perfect knot and not a strand is out of place.
“Wow, even to be considered in the same league as the Richard or Hull brothers is an honor.  I hope we can live up to that.  Well, Dean and I come from a hockey family.  Our father played in the American Hockey League and taught us the game.  We’ve been playing hockey together as long as I can remember so I guess we just have so much experience together it just sort of comes together on the ice.”
It feels like heaven. No wait, it’s better. He’s been to heaven and that wasn’t so great. This feels like home and family and the comfort of Baby purring around him. He feels that odd relief that always comes the moment his cuts no longer sting and his ankle no longer throbs. Involuntarily, his body relaxes, his eyes flutter closed, and he lets out an embarrassingly soft sigh as he lets Cas’ grace wash over him, through him, around him. Cas must feel the change because he freezes and tries to pull back but Dean’s own hand flies up to cover Cas’ and hold it against his cheek.
“Well done, Dean. You’ve got it.” Dean looked at the man in front of him, smiling encouragingly. From this close Dean was mesmerized by the cerulean blue of those eyes, dark now in the dim lighting. His dark hair was in disarray, flattened down against his forehead with sweat, framing his smiling face. Dean didn’t think he had ever seen anyone so beautiful.
Dean put up his hand.  “No!  I’m gonna stop you right there, Sam.  We’re not talking about this.  We’ve got a corpse to burn and no time for this drama.”
Dean’s smile fades and he blinks a few times and Baby can feel his warring emotions. Part of him is terrified, part of him feels unworthy, and part of him is so happy that she can feel the joy emanating off of him.
“I fucked it up like I always do! I guess your goddamn wedding brought out the girl in him because he started talking about family and shit and how he wants me to tell everyone about us. And…” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and squeezed his eyes shut sighing, “I haven’t told Bobby, Sam. I don’t know how.” Defeated, Dean laid his forehead on his arm, outstretched across the table.
Dean pulls back in surprise, making eye contact with Cas, who is looking at him with fuck-me eyes and a slightly upturned grin.  And Dean dives in for another kiss, a deeper, exploring kiss that is full of heat and promise.  They make out like a couple of horny teenagers, breath getting heavier and tongues reaching for that first taste of each other.  Dean moves his kisses across Cas’ jaw until he can suck gently at the soft spot just under his ear.
Finally, Dean turns away from him to face the parking lot, the darkness hiding the emotion on his face. “He’s so stupid, man. Like he didn’t know what he was saying. How could he? I don’t even know what he meant.”
“These are all new.  When I remade you, I wiped away every scar.”  Castiel kissed along the line of the mark, just slightly lighter than the skin around it.  He continued like this, exploring Dean’s torso with his fingers and tongue and lips.  It was as if Castiel was relearning Dean through touch.  Dean leaned his head back against the door, breathing out soft moans at the gentle caresses and running his fingers through Cas’s hair.  Castiel’s touch made Dean feel treasured, filling a need he had carried with him his entire life.
He was right about the poking and prodding.  After at least an hour of scans and tests and questions and examinations the doctors finally leave his room, presumably to huddle up and decide just how broken he is.  Its once again quiet until he hears a soft knock at the door and when he looks up his heart does a little flip when he sees Jess and hell yeah, she is carrying a tray of food!
Dean grabs the keys from Sam and digs in his pocket for a moment and tosses his own set of keys to his brother. “You wanna stash those bodies and pull the car up to the door while I get Cas down? We’ll meet you out front.”
“We’ve got to get to Ed and Harry.  They have salt in their bag.  And that bitch is coming for you,” he yelled, pointing at Castiel.
Well, that explains a lot, thought Sam. He knew about Michael and he knew what Dean had done a few times for money when they were younger, having walked in one time and backed out before he could be spotted. He never said a word about it and didn’t think Dean ever would either.
Lucifer’s expression hardens, “I’m going to destroy you, Dean, and enjoy every moment. I think I’ll skin you alive… slowly. My co-pilot should enjoy that. I’ll be sure to make him watch every last second of the torture.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that.  It sounds pretty girly.  He’s pretty sure that no ice skating performance is ever going to have that much of an effect on him.   It’s just a sport, after all.  Yeah, it was pretty exciting watching Cas do all that stuff, holding his breath with each jump.  But that’s sports.  He holds his breath when the Chiefs throw a hail Mary pass or when a team mate gets a breakaway.  He’s sure as hell not going to get emotional over it.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Dean groans.  Cas’ voice should have a mature audiences only rating because it might be the hottest thing Dean’s ever heard whispering shit like that into the cold night air.
“Son of a bitch,” he grumbles and tries to gather up what dignity he can as he puts his hand out to Cas to hand over the ticket to his doom.
Dean was dumbstruck.  No one had ever really laid it all out there like that.  Could Cas really feel that way about him?  Everything that Melody had just said was swirling around in his head, making him dizzy from thinking about it all.  From the moment he had met Castiel his life has been a constant race to save the world, his loved ones or his own skin.  He barely had time to breathe, much less take time to consider the motivation behind Cas’ actions.
Cas is improving on hunts, he’s still tough as nails and lethal with a sword, and he’s getting better at talking to people without earning all three of them strange looks. And now there is this other side to their relationship, this domesticity that terrifies Dean with how much he enjoys it. Sometimes he pretends to be researching when out of the corner of his eye he watches Cas discussing school work with Claire or correcting historical mistakes in the MoL literature with Sam.
The living room had a welcoming and comfortable feeling. It gave off a sense of home. Everything was warm colors of soft brushed greys and deep reds, with polished cherry wood accents. An antique traveling trunk with worn wood and old leather buckles sat along one wall. Dean smiled to himself as he noticed, too, that it was a bit messier than he had imagined Castiel’s home would be. There were books laying casually on end tables one laying open and face down to save a page. A throw blanket was tossed haphazardly over the back of a chair, a pair of shoes had been kicked off onto the floor in front of the couch, and what was probably the morning’s coffee mug was leaving a brown ring on a folded newspaper.
“Sounds like you and Sam would get along great.  He was a bookworm too.  Always wanted to go to college but when he was offered an NHL contract right out of high school… well, you know, hockey, the family business, kind of took priority.”
“No.  Stop, Castiel.”  She takes his hand and leads him to the bed to sit next to her.  After taking a deep breath she starts, “OK, now tell me what’s going on.”
“You don’t think you are good enough, but you are. And I’m not just saying that because you are my brother or because I’m kinda drunk. Really, Dean, any one would be lucky to have you. This Josie lady sounds great. You should go for it. I know it’s been rough for you lately but I believe there is a light at the end of this tunnel. Maybe it can be with her.”
Castiel smiled at him and brought his lips to Dean’s, kissing him long and slow, searching but soft. It was beautiful and perfect, this kiss. He licked at Dean’s upper lip as the man opened up to him. Castiel took the invitation and lightly licked into Dean’s mouth, touching and exploring and teasing with soft little flicks, nothing rushed or urgent. The feel of these soft touches, though, made Dean feel like he had gone to heaven. He could lose himself in the way Cas sucked his bottom lip, touched and teased at his tongue, making him shiver as he rubbed it against the roof of his mouth.
Right on time, Sam, who had been silently preparing the blood sigil on the wall behind Lucifer, slams his hand onto it and the archangel slumps into a boneless pile on the floor. He quickly yanks a hair out of his head, tosses it into the cup, and hands it to Dean, who downs the potion in one chug. Sam gives him an apologetic look before hitting him in the jaw with a powerful right hook.
“And you get to be the supportive shoulder for him to cry on? God, Dean, you’ve got it bad.” Sam laughed to himself at how excited his big brother sounded.
Castiel slowly nods and watches a fond smile build on Dean’s face. “Yeah?” He asks, “Do you wanna try… a kiss?”
Castiel still hadn’t said a word. He was not happy about this new development that Dean was a morning person. In his line of work, he didn’t even schedule classes until the afternoons so he was pretty sure this was the earliest he had been up since his Army days and he was no happier about it now than he was then. Castiel grunted something that sounded ridiculously like the sound Marge Simpson makes when she is upset with Homer and Dean turned around and winked at him. What kind of sadistic bastard is awake enough to wink at someone at five o’clock in the damn morning?
Cas looked at Dean for a long breath and closed his eyes while the corner of his mouth twitched into the slightest hint of a smile. “He used to say the same thing about them. It’s really so unfair. He barely kept in touch with them and he wanted me to have his flag, but his brother insisted that I stay away from the funeral. I don’t think he wanted anyone to know that Balthazar was gay. Raphael was truly a bully in every sense of the word. He all but disowned Balthazar when he came out and he made every possible attempt to get rid of me. We lived in constant fear that he would destroy our careers, but I guess he was happy with Balthazar being away from home so he didn’t expose us. In the end, it wasn’t Raphael who exposed us. I did it myself. That’s why I left the Army. It wasn’t voluntarily, Dean, I was forced out because they found out about us.”
Dean opens his mouth to protest but decides it's better to just leave this one alone. Crowley has, after all, figured out a way to keep a story about him and Castiel out of the news, or at least buried under all of these stories about his fictional relationship with Bela.
“Because you’re my big brother. I have been watching you and emulating you my entire life. I have your mannerisms memorized and I can tell when something is bothering you.”
Sam realized that the only way to keep these idiots safe would be to keep an eye on them.  He pulled Dean and Castiel aside, “Heckle and Jeckle here are going to get themselves killed unless we babysit them.  As much as I hate to say it, I think we are going to have to keep them close, otherwise, they are going to go poking at this thing and causing more damage.”
The other hockey players have begun to exit the locker room and are starting to queue up behind Dean.  Gordon narrows his eyes at Dean, a strange leer that gives him an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of his stomach.  Dean catches Sam out of the corner of his eye, looking back and forth between Gordon, Dean and Castiel.  Sam’s got great instincts and by the look on his face, he can read the strange tension in the air.
He stands under the hot stream of water and closes his eyes, reflecting on the series of events that have thrown him for a loop in the past couple of days.  The fight with Luc, his brother’s injury, Benny’s game winning goal, and waking up this morning wrapped around six feet of hot figure skater.  OK, that last one hasn’t left his thoughts since his eyes opened before dawn.
“Anna?  Um, I don’t think she will be concerned.  I’m sorry, Dean, but she moved on a long time ago.”
The more he thinks about it, the better he feels.  Sure, one silly reporter made some false accusations, but Dean didn’t seem bothered by it and Bela must not be either if she doesn’t mind the friends going to the snowboarding competition together.  He is feeling relief about Anna as well.  He had been concerned that Dean would be uncomfortable being around him knowing he had once had a fling with his sister but Dean said that wasn’t a problem for him at all.
The only hockey terminology here is the chapter title of slashing.  In hockey it's kind of what it sounds like, slashing someone with your stick.  But what Dean Cas fic would be complete without a little fandom slashing of our own?
Gabriel shakes his head and throws it back in a howl of laughter. “Oh, Dean-o, I think this is going to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Go to room 738 at 2:30, got it?”
With his hands lathered, Dean slid them down around Cas’ neck and over his chest, kneading the muscles there until Cas was liquid beneath his fingers. Next he rubbed his thumbs up and down Cas’ neck, across his shoulders and down his arms. One at a time, he worked the tension out of his lover’s hands, through the tips of each finger. Dean loved these hands. It was captivating the way that Cas used his hands. He would sometimes just stare at his them as he danced or ate or just turned the pages of a book.
“Oh, don’t try to play innocent, Dean.  The pictures have been all over social media this morning,” Becky is grinning now, wide eyed and practically salivating at the juicy gossip she has uncovered.
That at least makes Dean laugh. Benny has jokingly told Dean about the short leash that his wife, Andrea keeps him on. Thing is, though, Benny is so crazy in love with her, it doesn't even matter. Benny had told him once that everything he had done in the past seemed to vanish because he had Andrea and he had stayed clean not only for himself but for her and what they had together. Dean envies what Benny and Andrea have, wonders if he could ever have anything like that himself.
It’s late.  The hum of the busy hospital during the day has quieted and Castiel is sitting in his darkened room alone.  He isn’t ready to fall asleep yet, still wound up from the unlikely events of the day.  Oh well, at least he feels better.  After the afternoon guests all trickled off to find somewhere to watch the opening ceremonies, Castiel was finally able to take some time for himself.
“The two are definitely not mutually exclusive. There is, sadly, a very vocal population of people who exploit Christianity to validate their hate, but in my experience, they have been in the minority. Most Christians I have met are accepting of me and really just want to follow in Christ’s footsteps. I have even been to a church with a gay pastor. I will never let my faith be dictated to me by those that would manipulate it to spew hatred.”
But Cas had offered him forgiveness, recognized that Dean didn’t think he deserved it but gave it anyway.  And that gesture had meant probably more than it should to Dean.  Why did it even matter?  Its sports, people get hurt all the time.  For some reason, though, Castiel felt important to him.
He moved on to another photo of two soldiers in what was certainly the Middle East. They were standing next to one another in front of a Blackhawk helicopter with a large red cross on it, the shorter man casually leaning back against it’s door, legs crossed at his ankles. The taller man had his elbow resting on the shorter man’s shoulder and he was grinning widely. The shorter man wasn’t quite smiling, but had a satisfied smirk on his face. Dean looked a little closer and realized that the shorter man was actually Castiel. He was in the service? He wondered how he went from that to dance teacher. He made a mental note to ask about this development.
– A hat trick in hockey is when the same player scores three goals in one game. It’s a pretty rare feat. A variation of that is the Gordie Howe hat trick.  Howe is one of the greatest hockey players ever, so much so that he is actually known as Mr. Hockey.  He was good at scoring and fighting and so the Gordie Howe hat trick was named after him.  It’s when one player has an assist, a fight, and scores a goal all in one game.  Dean earned himself an off ice Gordie Howe hat trick for assisting Sam, fighting with Crowley, and scoring with Cas.
"Don't play coy with me, lover boy. You know I don't care who you choose to get… biblical with. But your lack of discretion and choice of timing is impeccable as always. Did you really think no one was going to notice you eye-fucking a sexy Russian skater?"
“We have all done things we regret. I didn’t fall in love with you for what you have or have not done. It is your soul that is so bright. Dean Winchester, you have more heart than anyone I have ever met and I was drawn to you like it was my destiny. Trust that this good thing can last.”
Dean’s confession scenarios became more and more outlandish in his mind and pretty soon found their way to emulating a bad porno. Yeah, he was pretty sure that showing up at Cas’s door with a pizza in hand wearing nothing but a smile would get him arrested before it got him ravished against a wall, but a guy could dream couldn’t he? And that just sent blood straight to Dean’s traitorous dick. What the hell, might as well make the best of his crazy situation. With Cas’ blue eyes and perfect long hands in his mind, Dean imagined what it would be like to look into those eyes while those hands explored his body and those incredible hips rocked against his so obscenely. Dean worked himself with furious strokes and called Cas’ name as he reached his climax.
Dean watched as Castiel lubed his fingers and began working himself opened as he sucked at his neck. His other hand reached behind Dean’s neck and met him for a mind-blowing kiss. It was deep and sexy as fuck and perfect. Castiel’s lips opened for Dean to explore with his tongue, licking across his lips and teeth, delving deeper into his mouth, trying Cas’ trick from earlier, licking across the roof of his mouth. And, yes, that was perfect. It pulled a low moan from Castiel.
And Cas said he wanted to see him again.  Those words shouldn’t steal the breath from his lungs the way they do.  This gorgeous man who moves on the ice like he’s flying and bites his bottom lip nervously when he smiles and looks at Dean with those penetrating blue eyes and makes him feel like he’s worth more than how many goals he can score…
. He was such a sap! He was getting emotional again as he watched the couple moving across the dance floor, impressing their guests. He thought the song that they had picked out was perfect.
“Yeah.  Sucks ‘cause he can’t hear me anymore.  I used to be able to just pray and at least I knew if he was alive he could hear me.  Now, he isn’t even answering his phone.  And he’s new to being kind of human.  I just hope he’s OK.”
“I don’t know, man.”  The familiar worry floods Dean’s mind and he begins pacing, talking fast and animated and he can’t seem to stop the words.  “I just came from the hospital.  I mean there’s a couple of busted bones but we’ve been breaking bones for years.  They’re more worried about the hit to the head.  Jesus, another person with a fucking head injury!  I’m gonna kill Luc!  Fuck!  It’s my job to protect him and he was just lying there on the ice bleeding and he’s still not awake and-”
“Hey, Cas. So, let’s take a look at her.” Dean greeted him with a warm smile as he jumped down from the cab.
Castiel hangs up and stares at his phone, horrified at himself, and drops the offensive gadget onto the bed like it was burning his hand.  How is it that he suddenly can’t put together a cohesive sentence?  And it’s the year 2014 for pete’s sake!  Why hasn’t anyone invented a way to delete a regrettable voice mail?!
“Whatever, dude.  Hey, maybe I can get them to add even more powers.  Wouldn’t it be cool if the demon blood made Sam fly like Superman or maybe go invisible?!” OK, thought Sam, this guy’s a few cards short of a whole deck but he was still difficult to hate.  He had this laid back surfer vibe that was kind of endearing.
Krissy was a more recent hire, having been brought on about six months ago. But she may have been the best business decision Dean had ever made. The kid may have been just out of high school, working her way through art school, but she was already a master with an air brush. Dean was the visionary who decided what the car’s paint should look like, but Krissy’s hands helped him bring that vision to life.
Benny just laughs, "No thanks, brother. You know a little man-love's your cup of tea, not mine. And I think Andrea might slay us both."
“I don’t know if there’s a God, Cas, but if he is out there, this is definitely one of the best things he made.” Dean wasn’t referring to the rocks, but Cas didn’t have to know that yet. Dean was certain that if there was a God that created everything, Cas was one of his masterpieces. “Wait a minute, Cas, you said you are gay, isn’t that, like a problem for you if you are a Christian too?”
He got up and went to the bathroom to run warm water over a washcloth. He came back to the bed, sat down on Dean’s side and washed him with a reverence that broke something inside. Dean didn’t know what he had ever done to deserve this man and he could feel that familiar fear rising up inside of him. It felt like standing on the edge of an unstable ledge that could break off and send you tumbling down at any moment.
He takes a slight step forward and traces his hand up, up, Cas’ arm until he cups his face and leans forward to press their lips together. It’s short and tentative but still enough to make his already thumping heart feel like it is going to explode out of his chest.
Dean immediately felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for his little brother, who had been so unbelievably cool about his confession last night. How could someone’s own brother want to destroy them just for who they loved? Then he suddenly remembered his own father’s reaction to finding him with Michael. Fuck! Why was the world so full of cruelty and intolerance?
He nearly runs to the on-deck area to tighten his skates and prepare for his performance.  All of these reporters have him much too frazzled.  When Dean showed up out of nowhere, it had taken less than a minute of flirty banter for him to begin to feel composed and confident in the man’s presence.  Something about Dean just makes him at ease and comfortable.  And in just as short a time, that tranquility was shattered by the reporters yelling about Bela and asking the nature of his relationship with Dean.
He looked up at the man splayed out beneath him. He loved making him come completely undone, seeing him release everything that usually kept him coiled so tightly and just let go. “That’s it, let go,” he coached, humming onto Dean’s dick, the vibration washing him with a rippling thrill. “I love when you are like this, open and exposed for me. It’s so fucking sexy.”
Dean shrugs his shoulders, "Kinda swore off guys after that incident scared the hell out of me. I still worry one day I'm gonna turn on the news and see my naked ass as the scandal of the day."
“Not that I know of.  They only tested me with those three plus Melody, who has the role now.  I gotta say, she doesn’t seem like the type to go around burning people because they got a job she wanted, but, who knows?  This is show business, right?  It can be pretty cut throat.”
Pretty soon, more pictures have been taken, more rounds ordered, and more people have pulled up chairs.  Members of the US Hockey team have arrived, along with NHL teammates from back home who are representing countries all over the world.  Before long, their quiet dinner for three has become a rowdy party.  The games don’t officially start until after the opening ceremony tomorrow evening so no one at the table is has to worry about competing the following day.  Dean is feeling the relaxing effects of the alcohol and the casual atmosphere.  He is a bit afraid it’s the calm before the storm of competition begins, but is able to put that thought in the back of his mind to have fun with his teammates tonight.
Castiel shrugs, “It used to be standard practice, but things have changed.  We have actually found that using popular recognizable music increases scores because it engages the audience more. And I despise sequins!  I’m already a gay figure skater.  Adding glitter is a little clichéd, don’t you think?”
Dean found the Ghostfacers, huddled together with their backs to the wall on the other side of the door.  Harry was digging through the bag as Ed was narrating to the camera Maggie was holding up.  He was breathing heavily, taking in huge gulps of air between words.  “We (breath) are here at (breath) the set of (breath) the Supernatural movie (breath).  The ghost of (breath) Nick Morgan’s dead girlfriend (breath) has already murdered (breath) once and is now (breath) on the rampage (breath) for another victim.”
"Of course," she said as she stepped aside for him to come in.  "What's going on?  I thought it was over but I heard about Lance?"
He can feel his heart beating faster with every ring.  What will he even say?  How does he even begin to address this awkward situation?  He is so nervous but an energetic buzz of excitement and anticipation thrums under his skin still.  He is saved from having to untangle his tongue when he hears Dean’s voice advising him to leave a message.
Dean hangs up the phone and suddenly remembers what Cas said last night about Anna.  Cas said he was gay but… well Dean says he’s straight so there’s that.  What if Anna is a girlfriend or something?  What if this news gets to her and screws up Cas’ relationship?  Shit!  He needs to warn the guy.
He turns before Castiel can even finish saying thank you and heads back down the hall.  God, he’s an idiot.  What was he even thinking showing up at Cas’ room?  Fuck!  He was going to kiss him.  He actually leaned in and was going to kiss Castiel!  What the hell had come over him?  He can only rationalize it as the high he must still be on from the game.
“I have never seen you look anything but exquisite, Dean.” With one swift movement, Cas fell to his knees and lowered Dean’s pants down to free his already rock hard erection. He licked at the head and pulled Dean into his wet mouth, eliciting a curse from the man above him. He closed his eyes and found a perfect rhythm, rocking back and forth, enjoying the sinful sounds that every movement was pulling from Dean. But Castiel wanted to watch Dean come undone.
All of these awful human feelings were so much more manageable when he could just mute them with his grace.  He didn’t have to feel the tingling in his fingers and toes that accompanied fear.  He hadn’t felt the hot rush of blood to his cheeks when he was embarrassed or flattered.  He didn’t know the fluttering feeling in his belly that he got when Dean was kind to him.  He hadn’t felt the warm roll of desire in his groin when Dean would step out of the shower wrapped only in a towel.  And he certainly hadn’t felt the stomach lurch and nausea that could only be labeled jealousy and hurt.
“Dean, yes, yes, I’m yours. I love you.” Castiel was writhing and arching into Dean’s every touch as their bodies melted perfectly together.
“No, our wings are… I think Jack wanted angels to stay in heaven and not interfere on earth so he didn’t restore our wings. Our work is now in heaven, restoring it, re-creating it, and protecting the souls there. But I could feel your distress so I asked him to send me to you. I knew I wouldn’t be able to return to heaven.”
Dean couldn’t help stopping on the way back to pull Cas into an empty tent, though, for a quick make out session. Dean pulled Cas to him and crushed their mouths together, groping Cas’ ass with his hands. “God, you look so hot like this. I’ve wanted to do that all day.” Dean pulled Cas’ hips to his, bucking against his lover, pulling a groan of pleasure from both men.
The following day, Dean shows up with an old DVD player and a few burned disks. He hooks the player up to the TV and they eat Ellen's pie straight out of the tin over a pirated movie. When Dean leaves, he kisses Cas again, this time it isn't quick. He cradles Cas' face with both hands, tilts his head, and they kiss for several stretched out minutes learning the curves of each other's mouths. Cas is left breathless, eyes fluttering open as Dean smiles fondly at him, pecks him on the tip of his nose, and turns to leave.
Sam holds back a snicker and instead gives Cas this warm smile, “It definitely does. Good plan, Cas."
“I know. But you are the strongest man I have ever known. You will save Sam, Jack, and your world. And you
Towards the end of the program is a movement in the music where the Imperial March plays and he does a slow spin combination during this dark, slower section.  Then at the end, the music picks back up to the familiar main theme and he flies around the rink, doing split jumps as the music crescendos and ends the routine with a fast combination spin and stops on the last note of the music.
