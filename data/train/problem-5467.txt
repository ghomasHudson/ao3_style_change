Tony dropped a kiss on his temple before turning to Pietro, “What my darling husband is trying to say Pietro, is that we’d like to legally adopt you. You wouldn’t have to take one of our last names and we wouldn’t expect you to call either of us dad or anything. But we do want you to stay here for as long as you want and the kids already love you like a brother and”
Tony was starting to cry, so Steve started talking again, “We named you after these people because they were strong and beautiful and smart, Peggy. We named you after these women, because we love you. We love you so much there aren’t words, baby girl. Sweetpea? We love you to the moon and back and then some. You’re staying right here with us. And if anyone tries to take you? We’ll send Uncle Bruce after them, huh? Sound good?”
Was it getting hot in here? J was supposed to keep the temp at a steady 70, but maybe something was off. Also, it was getting harder to breathe, which wasn’t unusual when he had the arc reactor, but he hadn’t really had breathing problems since then. He vaguely heard JARVIS saying something, but really couldn’t hear. Tony stumbled toward the couch, after that everything went kind of fuzzy, like he there but also wasn’t. Why was breathing so hard again?
He was promptly smacked across the chest, “Yes, of course there’s a point punk. Just listen. I’m assuming Tony knows that you swung both ways even way back before the ice right?” After Steve had nodded his head again, Bucky continued, “Okay and then I show up. The only person you have from before the ice. And there might have been some things said before that led him to believe that we may or may not have been a thing?”
“Steve, baby? It’s me Toni. I’m here now and I know now that I should have been here all along. I’m sorry I left in the first place. I-” Toni paused to choke down a sob, “I never should have left. I had no reason to leave. You were right, running is what I do best. Running or burying myself in work. This time I just happened to do both. But I love you and when you wake up, I hope that maybe you can find it in you to forgive me. If you can’t I-I understand.
The genius smiled at that and dropped a kiss on top of Peggy’s head, “Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s go watch our boy graduate!”
Steve and Toni both laughed at the boy’s breathless rant. They viewed the Spiderling almost as their own child. Toni had found him online, fighting crime in Queens in a onesie and goggles. She had designed him a suit and given it to him under the guise of a Stark Internship. He still lived with his aunt (the kid
He started talking, “Oh nothing. I was just laughing because none of you can fit in the suit. It’s designed for daddy and daddy only. People have to be smaller than him to fit inside. And the only one here that’s smaller than daddy is me, but I’m too little. Guess you just can’t use it!”
As it turned out, they were both in the shop when Toni’s contractions started. Toni was working on some coding for the newest edition of the StarkPhone, as well as new arc reactor plans for the compound. Steve was on the couch sketching. Neither of them liked being very far from the other, especially now that Toni’s due date was so close.
Steve couldn’t help but also smile at some of those memories though. After all, Peter and Peggy getting kidnapped had led to them adopting Pietro. That was definitely something positive. The boy had been hesitant around the family at first, but now? None of them could imagine life without the silver haired speedster running around.
I'm thinking of doing some more Peter-centric chapters. It wouldn't be until later, when I get to the root of Peggy's problems. But I think putting some more of Peter in this story would be a good thing, as most of it had been centered around Peggy. What do you guys think? Leave me a comment with your opinion!
Tony whirled around to face his husband, “Steve, I am almost positive that that is physically impossible considering that you almost never bott- okay, okay. What is it really?”
It took a split second for Steve to cross the room. Immediately, he drew the covers off. Tony’s cries seemed to lessen.
“Okay… But only if we get ice cream after, and only if I don’t have to come back if I don’t like it.”
Tony went to get up, “I-i said i-it’s nothing C-cap. Sorry J bothered you.” He turned to look at the ceiling, “JARVIS, don’t do that anymore.
Steve murmured something Tony couldn’t understand, “Can you repeat that Cap? Couldn’t quite hear you.”
And so, Tony didn’t. He fell asleep in the workshop whenever he just couldn’t run on caffeine anymore. This solution seemed to work. That is until Steve found out.
Tony had been working in the shop for four days straight. He’d probably had two hours of sleep a night, if that. He told himself that he was just gonna lay his head down on the workbench for a few minutes. That didn’t work out so well.
“Should we tell the team yet?” Toni had intertwined her fingers with Steve’s and was swinging their arms back and forth.
“Peter was asking for you yesterday. And I didn’t know what to tell him.” Steve moved back towards the bed, “Normally, I would have just used my override code to get into the shop, but it wouldn’t work. I tried. I’ve tried I don’t know how many time in the last few weeks. But every time, JARVIS reminds me to remind you to update it.” He paused again to sigh, “Tony, I don’t know what’s going on, but I really wish you’d talk to me. The kids have been asking for daddy, and all I can give them is papa. We all miss you, Tony. Just…” Steve turned back to the door again, “I’ll be here when you’re ready to talk, okay?”
Steve picked Toni up being careful, but still swinging her into a hug, “Oh my god, baby! We made a baby! Oh my god, this is incredible!”
In reality? It felt so fucking real Tony just wasn’t sure anymore. He kept seeing the Chitauri ship blowing up with the nuke, but at the same time felt himself being waterboarded in Afghanistan. He kept seeing Yinsen die, over and over and over again, while also seeing his dad throw tumblers of scotch at him but ultimately hitting the wall. He kept feeling all the times no one else was home, when the belt would come out. At the same time, he was felt like he couldn’t breathe, like he was in space again, with a suit that wasn’t prepared for that.
Well sure, Steve married Tony. Sure, Steve had kids with Tony. Sure, Steve could have left a long time ago. But Steve also hadn’t known that Barnes was alive. Would he have married Tony had he known Barnes was alive? Did Barnes even swing that way? Tony didn’t know. The logical and grown up thing to do would be to go talk to Steve. Instead, Tony went back down to the shop. He had a new idea for Nat’s Widow’s Bites.
Sam thought Nat looked awful. He had seen her with serious sleep deprivation, but this was something different entirely. He knew that her past was something she’d rather forget, but he also couldn’t help but wonder if just being here was messing with her psyche. However, that being said, he also knew Tasha well enough not to ask. If one wanted to live, one did not ask Natasha Romanov about her feelings or her past.
Nat’s face was suddenly on the screen, “Stark, I don’t know where you’ve been or what you’ve been doing, but I need you to get to New York. ASAP. The doctor’s aren’t sure he’s gonna make it through the night. How soon can you be here?”
Tony’s nose wrinkled at the title, “Don’t call me Mr. Stark, Mr. Stark was my father. Whatever happened to those sweet little nicknames?”
In the end, it took the six of them just over three hours to find all of the eggs. And then it took them a good long while to count out all the money they had found in the eggs. The patterned ones had candy in them, but the plain ones just had money.
He got a kiss before a verbal response, “Tony, the day I don’t forgive you is the day you have full permission to throw me off the roof. I love you and that’s not going to change. I married you and we have two wonderful kids together. I just don’t understand why you didn’t talk to me. We’ve established that communication is necessary. Why didn’t you just talk to me, baby?”
Steve sighed, “Tell him that’s fine JARVIS. Not like we could keep Peter away from bad habits forever.”
The family eventually moved towards the bedroom, hoping that maybe they could get Peggy to sleep if they were laying down. Tony thought trying to get her to talk could wait until tomorrow. The rest of the team was downstairs interrogating Peggy’s captor, trying to find Peter. Right now though, Peggy needed both of her parents, and they weren’t really willing to leave her side.
“I did? I just got up early and fell asleep again?” Tony phrased his statements less as statements and more as questions, knowing Steve wouldn’t buy the excuse either way, they knew each other too well.
Peter darted into the corner while Rhodey worked on opening the cell. He saw the modified suit in the corner and wondered if Tony wanted to leave it here or not.
Steve jumped in, “It was positive. And that’s why we were gone for two weeks. There wasn’t a heartbeat at the first appointment and we wanted to wait to tell you guys until we had a heartbeat.”
By this time, Peggy was crying again. Tony and Steve both looked about ready to murder someone, but their first priority was their daughter.
Ugly, earth shaking sobs were coming out of Toni’s mouth and it was only then that she really started talking, “I was so scared when I found out I was pregnant again, so fucking scared, Steve. I already wasn’t good enough for our little girl and she’s dead because of me. I killed our child because I wasn’t good enough! So I figured that getting pregnant had to be some sort of sick joke from some higher power because why would I lose one only to have another taken from me so soon? And then I hit the five month mark and all I wanted to do was come home but I didn’t think that you’d want me anymore because I was the one who lost our little girl in the first place!”
Steve was working on some paperwork from the latest mission and was planning on relaxing for the rest of the day, maybe taking his sketchbook out to the roof, when JARVIS started talking.
Right after the Mandarin, Toni wasn’t sure that she wanted to rebuild anything at Malibu. Steve convinced her to at least build something. After seeing his fixation with heat and sunshine, Toni really couldn’t say no. So, she rebuilt the house at Malibu, albeit this time, further back from the cliff.
The scientist just turned back around to the other bank of holo-screens, “Yes, I suppose. But usually with you, there’s work attached to the call. So c’mon, Pep. Spill!”
Rhodey and Sam were waiting outside. The looks on their faces didn’t bode well, not well at all. She almost broke down crying right then and there, but she held it together for now. Partially because both of them had the decency to not bring up the very obvious condition she was in.
“Sir appears to be having a panic attack Captain Rogers. Sir has experienced panic attacks before, after the Battle of New York.”
The supersoldier shook his head when he realized Bucky was talking to him, “Yeah, Buck, I’m here, just thinking about things.”
Steve perked his head up from his sketch book when he heard Toni hiss, immediately making his way over to the workbench.
The new model of the Stark watch was supposed to hit the markets in the next couple of months, and R&D was hopeless. Anything he said to fix, always came back worse than before. He told JARVIS to make note of who was making the mistakes so he could figure out how they had been hired. The watch had been the priority while the team was gone. Steve and the assassin twins were out tracking down HYDRA, Thor was off-world, and Bruce was at some conference.  Tony was perfectly content to sit and work on actual projects, but also goof off with the suits and DUM-E.
The relief flooding through Bruce was almost palpable, “I know it’s a lot to ask and I know you guys want to spend some quality time as a family after everything we’ve been through, but I really want to work on getting Bucky better as soon as possible. If Steve could spare just even a few minutes?”
Bruce ran a hand through his hair and down his face, “Not physically. I can’t speak for what this has done to his mind. I’m hoping that with enough rest, relaxation, and maybe some therapy he’ll be fine. I just don’t know though Tony. I just don’t know.”
Which was good, because Tony didn’t know if he could have met Steve’s, “Sure, no problem. Most of the stuff in the shop is done anyhow.”
I'm trying my best to put more and more of Peter into this story, but it's not going very well. I know he's supposed to be super smart, but I'm finding it hard to balance between that and him being five. If anyone has any ideas, drop a comment. Thanks for reading!
“Peter, come meet your little brother.” Toni was holding James when Peter came in, “Do you want to hold him?”
They met in the hallway, each heading to the bedroom they had been called to. Tony walked into Peggy’s room and was immediately met by the scent of vomit and the sounds of Peggy crying.
Peter nodded so quickly, Steve thought his head might come off. He scooped Peter up, throwing him over his shoulder. This sent Peter into a fit of giggles that both parents just smiled at.
Soon enough, they pulled up the last known address of Peggy’s parents. He sincerely hoped for their sakes that they weren’t there. The couple and their extended family were all angry. How anyone could do such unspeakable things to their innocent little Peggy was beyond any of them. If they hadn’t wanted her, why hadn’t they put her up for adoption in the first place?
Normally, Toni let Pepper take care of meetings, especially the ones overseas. Now though? Now, Toni begged Pepper to find her meetings that would get her out of the compound, begged for the overseas meetings that would keep her away for weeks, begged for anything that would work as a distraction.
And that’s where Tony stopped him, “Whoa, sport. Slow your horse there. That’s not at all what we were going to say. Just hear us out, okay?”
Toni could see into his eyes now, those eyes that used to be so full of love and devotion, now overtaken by hurt and betrayal and anger. She could see her reflection in the tears.
Steve and Tony looked at each other. They knew he wasn’t talking about having an accident, Peter had been potty trained by the time he was three. They had discussed his spider powers and decided to keep those a secret for the time being. There shouldn’t have been an issue there. Their little boy couldn’t possibly know he might be kidnapped, could he?
Steve had gone to see Bucky after Tony had come up from the shop. He had waited until Nat and Clint were finished training for the day, Tony was just too exhausted to take care of the kids.
He trudged his way to the elevator to get to the common floor. Tony had designed all of their apartments with kitchens, but no one ever really used them. Most of the time, they liked being around each other. Most of the time being alone was just too much. The doors dinged open and laughter invaded the space. Steve was tempted to turn right back around and go home. Maybe dealing with other people was too much for today. Of course, someone saw him before he could make up his mind.
They flanked her as they made their way to the elevator. Sam was the first to talk, “Not yet. They’re pretty sure he’s gonna wake up soon. He’s been talking in his sleep, mostly about you.”
Tony shook the thoughts out of his head, “Yeah Bruce, right here. Sorry, it’s been a long few days.”
Eventually, Peggy was able to talk again. At first though, Peter couldn’t understand what she was saying. After a few repetitions, he heard the majority of it.
They landed at SHIELD and immediately stormed in the front doors. Everyone cleared a path, not wishing to get in the way of the most powerful couple on earth.
This resulted in more sobbing, which led to Peggy throwing up again. Tony just held her, knowing there wasn’t much else he could do. Most of the team had gotten the stomach flu before Peter was in the picture, and the only thing to do was wait it out. It hadn’t been pleasant for any of them, but for Peggy? Tony didn’t even want to imagine what that felt like.
Tony didn’t think he had ever run that fast in his life. When JARVIS had said there was an emergency in the penthouse, he didn’t even hesitate, he just ran, telling JARVIS to make the elevator go as fast as possible.
“Did you really think they’d keep you? Did you really think anyone cared? They’ll never want you Layla, never. Nobody ever wants you. Why do you think I left you there? Why else would I go out and not come back? I was hoping you wouldn’t be there when I did, that’s why. Because you’re a mistake Layla, a terrible, horrible mistake that nobody and no one will ever want.”
The team was hesitant to wake the trio when they arrived back at the tower, knowing that Tony and Steve hadn’t slept hardly at all while Peter had been gone. No one knew just how bad off Peter was, they knew he was gonna have scars for a while. Eventually, his healing abilities would make them disappear, but for the time being, Peter had nasty scars that had even Natasha cringing at the sight of them.
Their daughter got off the bed and started for the bathroom, whining the whole way, but she went. When Peggy came back, she had her teeth brushed and pajamas on, still grumbling at her fathers about not wanting to go to bed. Once they got her in bed though, the kiddo was out like a light.
She could practically feel Steve staring holes into her back. After awhile, she gave up on trying to work.
Just a PSA, notes give me life. And by life I mean inspiration. You know, that thing that makes me keep writing? yeah that. So if you have anything at all to say, it'd be much appreciated, thanks!
Peter’s cries were breaking their hearts, but they had to go. Peter had turned five two months ago, it was time for him to start school. As much as Tony and Steve would love nothing more than to never let Peter leave their sight, they knew it was necessary. The kid was wicked smart, of course he was, Tony was his father, and he needed to be in school.
Bucky rolled his eyes, but continued, “Well, Tony locked himself in the shop after I showed up, right? Me, the only person still alive that you knew before the ice?”
“But she got me thinking. I know we initially ruled out a therapist because Peggy wouldn’t talk, but I think now that she’s talking more and more, reconsidering might be a good idea. We’re kind of out of other options here, Steve.”
Tony groaned, about ready to get up and just let Peggy stay up all night when Steve walked in. His husband looked tired, but triumphant, meaning that he had successfully gotten Peter to sleep for the night. Tony was going to have to admit that Steve was right later; not one of his favorite things to do.
They started by all sleeping in Steve and Tony’s bed that night. It was clear the kids weren’t going to be able to sleep on their own anytime soon, and if their parents were being honest, they didn’t want to let either Peter or Peggy out of their sight.
Meanwhile, Bucky was awake. Bruce wasn’t sure exactly what was going on. Bucky was locked in a Hulk proof room, for safety reasons. According to Natasha, what Steve and Tony had experienced was the Winter Soldier. But the unknowns about the situation vastly outweighed what the team did know about Bucky. By all accounts, he shouldn’t have even been alive. The official story was that James Buchanan Barnes had been killed in action in the Alps. They now knew that that wasn’t true, but until Steve could be pulled away from his family, they weren’t quite sure what to do.
Steve was still trying his damnedest not to cry, but it wasn’t working very well. After being alone with the kids for almost six weeks straight, he couldn’t take it anymore. Before HYDRA had happened, it had been him and Tony against the world. Now it felt like his better half had been ripped away and was never coming back.
“Daddy! Papa! I had so much fun today! We started learning how to write our names, and I know how to write my whole name now! And I made lots of friends but Franklin and Harry are my favorites, and they said that their parents know you. And then I said that maybe we could have a playdate, but only if it’s okay with you, and I”
“Alright munchkins, listen up!” Tony received cries of indignation from Pietro and Wanda at the childish title. He ignored them in favor of continuing, “Now that you’re all done with Easter baskets, we get to move onto the real fun. There are just about five hundred eggs hidden all over the tower. It is your mission to find every single one of them. They vary in size. The smallest hold quarters and the size progresses. The biggest one has a hundred dollar bill in it. Are you ready?”
A loud sigh escaped from Bucky, “Well, from what I’ve heard, Tony’s had issues with affection and people leaving him before, right?”
Tony continued trying to get Steve to breathe with him, but to no avail. Steve just kept gasping and wheezing and sobbing. There seemed to be no end in sight.
Peter woke up, not being able to move. He could feel everything, and when he opened his eyes, he could see he was now chained up. For what he didn’t know. He opened his mouth to speak, and let out a scream. He couldn’t see behind him, where the pain was coming from, but it felt like his back was being lit on fire. He knew it wasn’t because there wasn’t a burning smell. He hoped he would pass out at some point, it might make the pain go away.
He sighed, what was the point? The kids weren’t going to eat their veggies and there was nothing he could do about it. It wasn’t like he could withhold dessert when there wasn’t any. He had half a mind to call Tony up from the lab on the basis of it being an emergency, but gave up the idea rather quickly.
Toni looked up at her husband, tears shining in both of their eyes, “Yeah, I hear it. Loud and clear.”
Tony perked his head up, “Sure, just leave Peggy with me if you can. Bruce wants you down in his lab. He has some questions about Bucky.”
Tony’s tears were flowing freely now, “I-I just, I thought that you would want him. He’s so much better than me and the kids were getting along with him and what do I have to offer that he doesn’t?”
At first, he had been apprehensive about going to see Bucky. He knew what he wanted Bucky to be, what he was expecting him to be. Steve was expecting the same smooth talking, charming Bucky he had known before. Realistically, Steve knew that was impossible. Thus, why he had resisted going to see Bucky. But he also knew, the longer he stayed away, the longer it might take Bucky to get better. Sam had said they were making some headway with getting him to talk and move, but they thought that seeing Steve might really jumpstart the process.
Tony heard someone calling his name. He was sitting next to the workbench with his head on the workbench. He must have fallen asleep again.
Thankfully, Peter had stayed asleep through the whole ordeal. If he hadn’t, Steve didn’t know what would have happened. In all honesty, he and Tony probably would have started crying right along with Peggy. As it was, they were having a hard time calming her down. In the past few days, Peggy hadn’t wanted to be very far from either of them, which was understandable, normal even. The intense amount of crying and screaming and sobbing she was doing now though? It was getting concerning, especially when she started calling out to them, almost like they weren’t there.
By this point, Steve was kneeling by the bed, giving Tony those god damn puppy dog eyes. And Tony tried to voice his concerns, he really wanted to, but the words just wouldn’t come out. He wanted to tell Steve what he was afraid of. He wanted to talk, but the words just wouldn’t come.
Tony was on the verge of crying, “Steve, I love you. I need you here. I want you here.” He didn’t know what else to say.
You’d think that playing hide n seek with two ex-assassins would be rather annoying, but with the kids, they were perfect. They hid in places that were almost too easy, but the kids could find them after looking for a bit. Those two had blossomed together and got along with the kiddos swimmingly. Tony had a bet going with Steve that Nat and Bucky had moved in together, Steve didn’t believe him.
It wasn’t like he needed other people around, he was perfectly fine working on his own. Bruce was always going on and on about lab safety, while Nat and Steve always tried to convince him that coffee was not the only food group that mattered, and for that matter, that coffee was not a food group. Whatever.
“Okay okay, I get the point. I should have told someone. They started after the Battle of New York. I think it was mostly because of the wormhole. You didn’t know because I moved back out to Malibu and after the fact I didn’t want to talk about it. I don’t think I really have specific triggers for the panic attacks, they just happen. When they first started happening, it was anything about New York that would trigger them really. I haven’t really had any since then though. I’m hoping there won’t be future attacks, but if there are what you did today seemed to work. I’d stick with that. I think maybe Pepper knew about them, but Rhodey definitely did. He was there when I had the first one. There was a kid I met while trying to figure out the Mandarin, his name is Harley Keener, he knows. That kid helped a lot with that whole mess, he’ll definitely get into any college he wants to, fully paid tuition too. But I digress. Any other questions?”
Everyone triple checked their weapons, made sure they had coms, and prepared themselves for whatever situation they were about to walk into.
Steve was the first to speak, “Sweetheart, we love you, so much. You’re staying right here with us, okay? You’re not going anywhere baby. We love you too much. You’re our little girl and we’re a family. You and me and daddy and Peter. You’re ours, forever and always Peggy, okay?”
They were down in the gym, and Steve was on his third punching bag, or was it his fourth? Either way, when they all came home, Tony went straight to the workshop, and Steve headed for the gym. He hadn’t said a word to anyone, just wrapping his hands and going to town on the punching bags. Tony was going to have to make more after all of this was over, because there weren’t very many left.
“She’s inside. I think you guys need to get in there now. She’s hardly stopped crying since you left, I’ve never seen her separation anxiety get this bad. I think there might be something else going on.”
Steve huffed and then rolled his eyes when Toni stuck her tongue out at him. They both really hated being wrong.
“Already done, Sam,” Steve stood up and dusted his hands off, “just waiting on this husband of mine now.”
Steve stumbled out of the elevator. He had asked JARVIS to take him to his floor, the one he had moved out of when he and Tony became official. The one he hoped he’d never have to see again. But right now he had no other choice. He didn’t want the kids to see him like this! It was bad enough that they had a parent who was essentially MIA, they didn’t need to see the other one all broken up.
“If you’re wondering where your sister has gone, she’s at home. We traded her for Iron Man. You, on the other hand, young master Peter, have much more to give up than your parents ever could.”
Steve was still gazing at Bucky when Tony wrapped an arm around him, “We’ll figure everything out, Steve. It’ll just take time.”
From what everyone could piece together, Peggy had been raped, multiple times, by her mother’s boyfriend. When it got hard to keep her quiet, her mom dumped her on the steps of the firestation. From there, Peggy’s main concern seemed to be about Steve and Tony abandoning her or getting sick of her. They did their best to assuage these fears but everyone knew that time would be their best friend going forward. The family lived by the motto “actions speak louder than words.”
“Any particular reason you’re laughing like a maniac, dearest cousin? Because if there is, do please enlighten us.”
Peter perked up at the mention of DUM-E, but still wasn’t totally convinced, “But I’ve never been alone before, what if something happens?”
. If he wanted anyone else, he would have done it long before now. He’s been driving himself crazy taking care of those two wonderful kids and trying to figure out what he did wrong. He thinks that it’s his fault you’ve locked yourself down in the shop. He loves
She and Steve had decided to wait on kids. Well, actually it was more like it had taken him awhile to bring her around to the idea of having kids. She had been so scared that she was going to turn out like her own parents and that their kid (or kids) was going to grow up hating her. Steve had calmed her fears after some time and some serious talking.
Peter nodded, seeming very much happier with this than having the whole family laughing at him. He was content to let Tony carry him to the bathroom for a bath, while Steve went back to cutting Peggy’s pancakes. Or he would have, except that Peggy had apparently not wanted to be left out. She had dumped the whole plate, the pancakes
Flabbergasted, it took Steve a minute to talk, “You want to do what now? Tony, you do remember we have two small children at home, not to mention the rest of the team lives there? Are you out of your ever-loving mind?!?!”
Steve was still crying, but the tears were different from before, “Of course that’s enough. I love you too. Yes you can call me sweetheart." A pause, and then, "Can I call you doll?”
Tony was hoping that by the time Peggy went to college things would have settled down at least a little bit. He’d probably turn Iron Man over to Riri by that point (she was already building her own version of the suit) [he’d wanted to give the suit to Peter, but Petey had Spider-Man], although getting Steve to retire from the Avengers would be a totally different story.
of the learning curves getting there. After Peter, came Peggy. And with Peggy came a whole basket of other stories, all leading up to the kids getting taken by HYDRA. This led to the whole mess they were in now. The mess where Steve might as well have been a single parent and Tony had locked himself in the shop for the last two months.
He walked over to where Tony was in the shop, “We don’t have to make a decision right now. I just thought that maybe getting her around other kids might be a good thing. But if you don’t think she’s ready, then we can wait.”
When they got back to SHIELD, Tony and Steve wanted to the interrogations themselves, but their way was barred by Fury himself.
Steve honest to God giggled and brushed a kiss over Tony’s lips, “Whatever it takes. You’re stuck with me for good, Mr. Stark.”
The man didn’t answer, he simply stood there watching Peter. Peter thought that maybe he was supposed to be watching his spider powers. But he wasn’t gonna do that anymore.
The news was playing softly in the background. The watch was 95% done, as was the newest version of the suit, Mark 43. Everything was going fine until DUM-E picked up that stupid photo of him and dear old dad. And then, on top of that, there were rumors swirling on the news that Steve, or Clint, or Tasha had been hurt, or killed, he wasn’t sure which.
I'm most likely going to be making another part of this series. There's other elements I want to add to this plot line, but if I include them in this fic, it's gonna be really long. I don't really want to make this fic that long. I'm thinking that this might have a few more chapters, maybe 4, and then it'll be done. Not sure though.
Peggy didn’t have an answer, she just curled further into the corner, hoping that the man wouldn’t come in. He didn’t come in, just looked at her for a moment longer and swept out of the room. She tried her hardest not to cry, she really did, but she wanted daddy and papa. She missed home, and Peter, and the rest of her family.
“Mmm, how fast can you drive to LaGuardia?” She leaned over the console and rubbed their noses together.
“There is not any in the refrigerator on this floor, however there is a case on the communal floor. It is clearly marked with Agent Barton’s name though, Sir.”
Steve chuckled, “Well the ice cream I can promise Peter, but not coming back will have to be discussed ad longitudinem bud. Kay?”
Tony and Steve stared at each other, unblinkingly, for a while before they both broke down. Sam was urging everyone out of the room, sensing that the couple needed space. After everyone was gone, they curled into each other as best they could on the couch. Tony spoke first,
Nobody had to do anything. The HUD locked onto the life signatures and all of their would be assailants were dead in seconds.
“Yeah, Petey, I do. Papa and me will be back just as soon as we can, huh? And then we’ll just have to make some more pancakes, yeah?”
Toni didn’t have an answer. She dodged around Steve and ran for the house. He didn’t follow her or say anything, he didn’t have to. Toni could feel the daggers he was glaring at her back even after she closed the door.
The scientist was already back at the screens, “No, it’s fine. I just wanted to give you what little bit of an update we do have.” He took a deep breath before continuing, “We know there was some sort of brainwashing involved. I don’t know yet how deep it went, but I’m guessing it did more harm than good, keeping him trapped for over seventy years? We were hoping that knocking him out would snap him out of whatever trance they had him in, which it did, but now we have a new problem. He’s not responding to anyone. Sam tried, partially because Bucky needed medical care. But Bucky wouldn’t let him get anywhere close. So then Natasha tried, thinking maybe he was used to a different language. He looked more alert at that point, but she didn’t get any kind of reaction either.”
Tony woke up in the shop, again. There had been a time when if he fell asleep in the shop, he’d wake up in bed. But that had been before Barnes showed up. Before he decided Steve would be better off without him.
“They showed up on the front step about an hour ago. Barton knocked ‘em out with tranq arrows pretty quick. They’ve been here ever since.”
After the first trimester was over, everyone had taken a sigh of relief. They were essentially out of the woods. Toni stopped going on missions after they told the team, staying in the shop and operating the suit remotely. Everyone thought everything was going to be fine.
Tony sighed but knew he’d have to fess up at some point. Might as well make it now instead of later. “Pepper called me today. She had the normal business stuff to talk about. But she also mentioned Peggy.
For the first time in months, Toni saw the brilliant blue eyes that she had fallen in love with. And they were looking anywhere but at her.
Tony spoke up first, “J, what he means is if Steve does anything suicidal, will you please let all of us know immediately?”
Eventually, Tony’s breathing evened out to a normal rate. The shivering never quite stopped, but Steve was more focused on trying to get Tony talking.
Even as he was berating his husband, Tony stepped forward to hug him. After all these years, just a hug from Steve had the power to calm him down.
The couple shared a look over Peter’s head, what had happened that would make Peter so panicked? Fortunately, upon hearing that Peggy was safe and sound at home, he cuddled right back into the family sandwich.
Clint was still rubbing his head while everyone else gathered around to extend their congratulations and well wishes.
Tony finished his sandwich and stood up, “Thanks for lunch Cap, but I have to get back to the shop. Suits to improve, deadlines to meet, yada yada.” Tony turned to head to the elevator.
Both women were waiting by the door, ready to go, but needing to talk to one of the parents before they left.
Eventually the tremors and audible gasping stopped. Steve didn’t notice at first, but did when Tony started to move.
As soon as Nat came out of the elevator, the TV was the last thing on Peter and Peggy’s minds. They were infatuated enough with their Aunty Nat, but Aunty Nat had also brought Uncle Bucky.  They were all over Nat and Bucky, asking why they didn’t come over more often and if they could go play in the gym with them. They went on and on and on with the questions, Natasha laughing at them all the while. Steve managed to duck out while they were preoccupied with Nat, shooting her a grateful look as the elevator doors slid closed.
The door opened. At first she thought maybe papa had found her, but the next minute that hope was dashed. The man that walked through the door looked nothing like her papa or her daddy. This man was tall, dressed all in black, and had an unkind look on his face. Peggy scrambled back into the corner, wishing for anyone to just get her out of here.
When Toni got back to the villa that night, the door was cracked open. Slowly, she set her briefcase down and activated the gauntlet watch, just in case. If there was a real intruder, JARVIS would have told her, but any intruder was unwelcome at this point.
Steve came down an hour later, knowing full well Tony hadn’t left the shop in days. He was fully prepared to have to drag Tony to eat. What he wasn’t expecting, was for Tony to be asleep on the workbench.
James Camden Stark-Rogers was born on June 16, 2018. He weighed 7 lbs 10 oz and was 20 inches long. He had inherited Steve’s blonde hair, but had Toni’s gorgeous brown eyes. There wasn’t a dry eye in the room when the team came in to visit. All of them were crying and cooing over this newest addition to their little family.
He really hoped that answer would be good enough, it was the best one he had. The only one that was even slightly truthful. When he looked up, Steve didn’t look convinced. He also didn’t say anything else. He walked towards the doors, taking one last look back at Tony, before heading towards the elevator bank.
“It appears that progress has been made looking for Miss Margaret’s biological parents, Sir. Shall I bring up the new information?”
That first kiss was six months after New York. Steve was there. Steve was there through the panic attacks and Malibu and the Mandarin. Steve was there is a way no one but Jarvis, Rhodey, and Pepper ever had been. He had been Toni’s rock through the whole process.
“OH MY GOD WE ARE NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, YOU BASTARD? YOU ARE WEARING A FUCKING CONDOM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES, I AM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN, OH MY GOD!”
Peter just looked up at the man, “My family is coming. You won’t get away with this! They’ll be here really soon!”
never about before. Why should it be better or different now? If anything, it’ll probably be worse.”
JARVIS finally convinced Tony to leave the lab, claiming that Dr. Banner had some urgent news. Tony wasn’t inclined to believe him. That was often the excuse JARVIS used, when really the info could wait for later. But, considering what the family had just gone through, Tony didn’t think Bruce would call him down for anything less than an emergency. It was worth at least checking out.
So I realized that they were supposed to trade the suit for Peggy and that I didn't talk about that. I honestly didn't mean to do that, I just had a thought about how to finish Peggy's story and went with it. I'm going to cover that in this chapter.
The kidnappers were going fairly well. HYDRA was so cocky it wasn’t even funny. They blatantly put faces, names, new identities, the whole works on their servers. And unfortunately for them, very little of their data had been deep sixed before Tony got to it. The team, along with SHIELD was bringing those bastards in one right after the other.
It was almost a day before the ransom video came. Everyone had been expecting it, you don’t kidnap the children of Captain America and Iron Man without making some sort of demand. Nobody was quite ready for what they were about to see, Tony and Steve least of all. Pepper and Rhodey had to leave the room and Natasha looked like she had just seen a ghost.
Tony bolted straight upright. He knew he needed sleep, but the nightmares were almost worse than being awake. When he was awake, he knew what was real and what wasn’t. He knew that for right now, his children were alive. His subconscious wasn’t so sure. It kept showing him varying versions of the same vision, his children, laying on the floor of that goddamn cell, dead. He kept dreaming about the different ways those sick bastards could torture them. He just kept dreaming all of the worst case scenarios.
The look on Steve’s face still said he didn’t have a clue what Bucky was talking about, “Buck, I don’t understand what you’re trying to get at. What am I not understanding?”
Fury himself had taken point on the case, commanding all SHIELD personnel not working on necessary projects to report to their superiors for new orders. If anyone had any problems with the new order, no one said anything.
Natasha brought the whip down on his back again, hoping to make this bastard feel what had been done to Peter, “You will answer my questions, bitch. You, are going to,” she whipped him again, “tell us where to find Peter,” the resounding crack of the whip was heard again, “and then I will make you and all of your friends, die in the most painful ways I know how.” She crouched to look him in the eyes, “Do you understand what you have done to yourself?”
Peggy’s eyes shot open, looking straight at Peter. She stared for a few seconds, before shooting forward into Peter, sobbing.
“Just know that you don’t have to give us an answer right away. We’re prepared to give you as much time as you need to give us an answer.”
This is just kind of a filler chapter. There's nothing super important that happens, some family bonding, but that's about it. The next one will be better.
“I know, I know. I can’t believe I’m saying it either, but the best place to keep potential enemies is close. And if we keep them at the tower, JARVIS can keep an eye on them. They won’t be able to do much.”
Bruce and Natasha looked slightly shocked by this statement, but with resignation on their faces. They both knew Tony was probably right. All of them knew Steve was depressed. But nobody knew what to do about it. None of them felt they had known Steve long enough to be the one to bring it up. And all the people that had known Steve before were either dead or on the run.
When Steve got the alert, he almost crushed his phone. Tony had warned him about this. They had both agreed that implanting trackers in the kids was a good idea. They had been prepared in the event that someone ever tried to take the kids. But Steve never thought it would happen. Despite their adamant protests, he was almost positive that Fury had at least one agent stationed at the kids’ schools. Nat was the first one to notice the change in Steve’s breathing.
The couple was now pacing a hole in the floor of Steve’s office, driving their friends crazy, as none of them were allowed to go out. They were too close to the case, although, no one knew how Clint and Natasha had managed to sneak past that rule. Tony was chugging coffee like there was no tomorrow and Steve just wouldn’t stop moving. Eventually, Sam and Rhodey forced them to sit down. For the first time in hours, the two really and truly looked at each other. They both looked about ready to collapse, the others were hoping they would tire themselves out and fall asleep, but neither were prepared to do so.
A week later, Tony sent Wanda back to SHIELD. She clearly didn’t want to be in the tower and she was starting to pose a threat to the inhabitants. Suffice to say, she wasn’t entirely thrilled with being sent back, especially without her brother.
Tony thought that maybe going to bed with Peggy might calm her down, Steve went with it. That was how they calmed her down from nightmares, putting her in between them and making a family sandwich. If that didn’t work, they didn’t know what to do.
Toni set to work packing a bag, not knowing what was going to be on PEI, considering that she had forgotten that she owned it. There was no telling what was or wasn’t going to be there.
He made a mental note to bring some food down later, “Yeah sure, Tones. Whatever you need man. Let me know if you do need help though, you’re not alone in this.”
“I never wanted you. You ruined my life, you stupid, little bitch! I had everything before you came and ruined it all! You’re a problem that nobody wants! You really thought that they’d keep you? That they’d love you? How could they? You’re a mess! You can’t even sleep on your own! You have to have someone there or you wake up screaming.”
JARVIS came back with a response several minutes later, “Agent Barton is happy to give the ginger ale to the children. However, he wants to watch Peter the next Friday he is well.”
Steve wouldn’t trade any of it for the world. On the way there, Peter and Peggy were preoccupied with Bucky, so he had a few minutes to just sit and think. About how his and Tony’s relationship had started.
They stayed locked together long enough for Steve to murmur his response, “Sorry, sweetheart. The kids had a few wardrobe malfunctions and then well, there were just things that needed to be taken care of before we left. But we’re here now. And we’re gonna go watch our son graduate high school, can you believe that?”
The next chapters will be more from the kids' points of view. So they might take a little longer than a day.
Peggy woke up sobbing, which wasn’t anything new. The new part was, papa wasn’t there. Neither was daddy for that matter. She looked around through her tears, and found that she was surrounded by bars. It didn’t look like anywhere at home.
Tony liked to think this was when he would open up to Steve, tell him his fears, confide in his husband, just like he used to. Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. Peggy’s confession? It was another excuse to throw himself into work. Now looking for both their kidnappers and Peggy’s biological parents.
Sharon rubbed her face, “We’re really not sure. You guys left and she started sobbing. A few minutes later, she was calling for you guys, begging you not to leave, promising she’d be good. I really don’t know what was going on Tony, I’ve never seen her like that before.”
Fighting his way out of the embrace to face the super-soldier, Tony huffed. “I’m being serious here, Steve! I think Pepper might have been on to something. Peggy talked after HYDRA, but we know there’s still issues there, right?  Well, I’m just saying that now might be a good time to start looking for a therapist.”
“STEVE!” She screamed, pouring everything she was feeling in that moment into that scream. All the anguish and sorrow and devastation that she felt for this child that was never to be.
Several weeks later, the same thing started happening again. This time though? There wasn’t anything that could have triggered it. He was down in the shop, as usual, and the whole team was safe in the tower.
“Yeah buddy,” Steve shook his head slightly, “I’m fine. Why don’t you guys take your dishes to the kitchen? And then you can ask JARVIS for a movie?”
Peggy walked over to Tony and hugged him, “You’re not old, daddy. Papa’s a lot older than you. So is Uncle Bucky. Either way, you’re not old.”
Steve just laughed, “Ya know, not everything I do has to be uber patriotic. Captain America is just a name.”
He didn’t give Tony a chance to respond before answering, “I do, I can count back the days. The last time I fell asleep next to you and woke up the same way, was before the kids came home. Do you know how long ago that was Tony? It’s been six weeks.
He quietly thanked both Pepper and Sharon, showing them to the door. He turned around, ready to talk to Steve. What he saw however, melted his heart. Both of the kids were cuddled on top of Steve like a puppy pile and he had an arm around each of them. All three of them were also asleep. Tony grabbed his phone to take a picture.
Bruce was simultaneously running simulations on possible projects, “Yeah, why not. Maybe Tony has an idea that we missed.”
The boy was trying to catch his breath, “I don’t know. We both know we can’t run from Tony Stark for forever. He’ll find us sooner rather than later.”
Tony sighed, knowing he wasn’t going to get anything past the superspy, “Well, you know Barnes is back in the picture. And I’m also assuming you know that Steve swung both ways, even back in the 40s. Do I need to keep talking or are you getting the picture?”
Nurses and doctors came through every hour, always finding the same thing. Nothing was changing, which was both a good thing and a bad thing, the doctors explained. If nothing was changing it meant that nothing was declining, but nothing was improving either, which was concerning considering Steve’s healing factor.
Steve knew doing paperwork was out of the question for today. Which meant that going into SHIELD today, was also out of the question. He really didn’t know what to do. Usually, he’d be working, but today that just wasn’t going to work. TV was his last resort, other than going back down to the common floor. Steve plunked down on the couch, not planning on moving for the rest of the day.
When Peggy started crying, Tony was wide awake. He and Steve had become accustomed to hearing Peggy cry over the last few months. It still wasn’t a pleasant sound to wake up to, but Peter used to wake them up by dropping on their bed from the ceiling, so waking up to Peggy crying wasn’t the worst way to wake up.
Clint was finally the one to break down and do it, knowing that Peggy would want to be with her family. The tot had been asking for Peter since she got home and no one had known just what to say to her.
Tony scooped his son into his arms, “Hey squirt!” He was also trying very hard not to cry, “Sorry it took us so long. We just didn’t know how to find you.”
This time when Steve moved, he moved towards Tony, stopping when he had his hands on Tony’s shoulders, “Sweetheart, you know I love you. And I know you well enough by now to know that something has to be wrong for you to be doing this. But you need to help me understand. I can’t keep doing this, baby. You not being with me? With the kids? It’s killing me. I just need you to make me understand. Help me to understand. Please?”
husband here, seems to think that I need to stay away from my shop until after this baby is born. I keep telling him that I’m staying away from chemicals and flame, but he still thinks I shouldn’t be working. I need a professional opinion.” Despite her ribbing at Steve, Toni was beaming at him.
Toni kept feeling twinges in her back all day. She thought it was just because the pregnancy was progressing, she was getting bigger, coupled with the fact that she had been bent over the workbench all day.
Tony crouched down to be at eye level with their son, “Peter, we’ll be back in a few hours. You’re gonna make all kinds of new friends today, I just know it. We’ll be back at 2 squirt, and then you and DUM-E can play catch the rest of the day, sound good?”
There were tears in Toni’s eyes and she had massive bags under her eyes, “So is there hope that he’ll wake up? Any at all?”
Tony was in fact talking. He was trying his best to calm Steve down, but wasn’t sure that he could hear him.
“Hey Steve? Tony? Guys? We’re home. You maybe wanna take the snuggle party inside to include your daughter?”
This chapter's also a little bit choppier than the last ones, but I think it works for the most part. If any of you know of a beta that would be willing to help me, let me know in the comments.
hadn’t been to see Barnes yet, Tony couldn’t help but start distancing himself. Once Steve did see Barnes again, Tony would be no more than a speck. Sure, they were married, but Barnes had been first. Barnes had more history with Steve, more to offer to Steve. More than just money and Iron Man as team member. He just had more.
Tony just winked, “Guess you’ll just have to go to school to find out squirt. Why don’t you go find out?”
“Oh, it’s good, Stark. You’re both gonna want to see this. Walk with me.” He turned and started to walk down one of the hallways.
When they came back to the compound, Toni locked herself in the shop. It was Steve who had to break the news to Peter, Nat had told everyone else but Steve wanted to tell Peter in person. The boy had been so excited about the baby; essentially, she would have been his sister. When Steve knocked on his bedroom door, Peter looked up, his face an expanse of hope.
time Tony, I have to tell them, ‘I don’t know.’ Which isn’t even the truth, I do know. I know you’ve barricaded yourself down here, but I also know I can’t get in without permission anymore.”
Eventually, he woke up. Waking up was more along the lines of jolting awake in a cold sweat, feeling like there wasn’t enough air in the world. It was like having a fire underneath you, while being frozen in a block of ice. It was hot and cold, wet and dry, comforting and disconcerting. All of these feelings came flooding into his system.
He wasn’t prepared for what he was about to hear. Peggy had been talking more and more after starting school, but when they got her back from HYDRA, she had stopped talking almost completely. Now though? Peggy was letting out a constant, non-stop stream of words.
Tony and Steve were trying to have a conversation, knowing that when the kids finally woke up, they weren’t going to have any alone time for a while. Problem was, every time they started talking, Peggy would start to wake up, which was one thing they didn’t want. Because when Peggy woke up, Peter woke up and then nobody slept for a solid twelve hours.
JARVIS came back with a reply a few minutes later, “Agent Romanov wishes me to inform you that she will be up momentarily. Can I do anything else for you, Captain?”
“Steve! It’s fine! Just give me like another hour, or until my water breaks and then we can upstairs, okay? I really need to get this coding done before this baby gets here.” Toni had turned around initially, but was now steadily working at the holo screens again.
Tony desperately wanted to tell Steve. He wanted to tell Steve everything, but just like before, the words just wouldn’t come. He had seen the way Steve and Barnes were getting along. If Tony kept himself out of the picture, the kids might even forget about him before the inevitable divorce.
Steve’s voice was trembling now, but it still held all the fire and anger that he was feeling, “Toni,
Tony looked over and looped Steve’s fingers with his, “Maybe it will be good for her. Bring her out of her shell a little bit?”
Originally, they thought that marching right up to the tower would be the best way to get this over and done with. But then the boy had a better idea.
Steve hugged Peter just slightly tighter before asking his own question, “And Bucky? Bruce, how is he even alive?”
Tony looked about ready to keel over and faint. Peggy had seemed off the last few days, but he and Steve had put it down to be, ya know, kidnapped by HYDRA. They never imagined that she would start talking about her past.
It seemed like years before the elevator opened in front of the shop doors, and even longer before JARVIS opened the shop doors themselves.
It took Tony a good long while to process that, Steve was starting to freak out and think that Tony was gonna hate him, and that he’d have to move back to SHIELD, and………
Five minutes later and every asset SHIELD could spare, and then some, was mobilized in the hunt for the Stark-Rogers children.
He hoped that had been convincing enough. Peter knew he just had to stall some more. Either to let papa and daddy find him, or to find a way out himself.
Peter nodded miserably, burying his face in Tony’s shoulder. Tony just cuddled Peter as close as he possibly could.
Steve was trying to get ready for bed when there was a knock on the door. At first, he thought that maybe it was one of the kids. He knew it couldn’t have been Tony. Tony had never knocked on their bedroom door in his life, why would he start now? When he opened it, Steve was sorry to say he was disappointed. It wasn’t one of the kids, it was Bucky.
Steve huffed out a sigh before turning to walk through the door, heading back out to the kids. He turned around just as Tony was getting comfortable.
Steve didn’t look super thrilled either, “Well at least they’re asleep now. When they wake up we need to try to get them to at least drink something. Do we have any ginger
“Sir, as part of my protocols, I am obligated to remind you that you have now gone 72 hours without any substantial amount of sleep. Shall I alert Captain Rogers?”
“Congratulations Mrs. Stark! Do you hear that heartbeat?” Dr. Evans was extremely cheerful today, mostly because they could now hear the heartbeat.
Pepper and Tasha were the ones to finally talk Tony into it, he had been on the fence for a while. The idea of sending his little girl anywhere for any length of time still scared him, hell, it still scared him sending Peter to kindergarten every morning, but he agreed that preschool would be good for Peggy.
At his lovebirds jab, both men blushed, knowing they hadn’t been lovebirds in god knows how long. Fury didn’t need to know that information though, so the two headed back to car, riding back to the tower in complete silence. Neither of them knew that both hearts in the car were breaking just a little bit more.
“Okay, okay!” Steve held his hands up in a surrender motion. “If you think Peggy would be willing to talk, I say we go for it. If it doesn’t work, no harm no foul, right?”
Tony thought it was probably a stupid question, but he was acting like a therapist so, “Back where?”
Peggy woke fully with a start. At first, she didn’t know where she was. Maybe back in the cell? But then she smelled papa and realized that whatever she was laying on was warm and soft. She looked up and saw papa. He was smiling at her, trying to cuddle her closer with Peter in the other arm. She just cried harder.
Steve picked him up, rubbing his tummy as best he could, “I wish I could baby, but there’s not a whole lot I can do right now buddy.”
