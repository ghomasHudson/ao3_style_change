He's nothing like the curvy girls John used to date. He's all straight lines and awkward angles.
Yet more proof that John is the One to activate the medallion.
But John hardly knows anything about him.
“When we get word from Finn”, he says, “and....if it turns out that....after......if I'm not who you think I am....please don't think less of me.”
He would very much like to do something like that again.
People will see through him immediately.
It drips and oozes as it shambles towards them.
She sighs and rolls her eyes again.
I wait a good 15 minutes before I text him back.
He has just finished telling Finn everything The All have told him in their recent meeting and his own interpretation of it.
Still nobody speaks.
Something that I've kept inside of me for far too long has been set free. I feel so much lighter for it. It gives me hope that I might be able to set things right with John after all. If I am able to talk after years and years of silence then maybe he will be able to set free some of those words he keeps hidden inside of him as well.
Is this a date? Surely it can't be a date.
As always: many thanks to anyone who's reading along.
But John specifically told him.......
The last thing John remembers is his own reply: “The world can wait.”
He had found it difficult to breathe. And so he had made his retreat and he had sworn to himself never to return there again without John.
“Everybody knows me.”
She had been pale and terrifying and full of teeth and venom and he had wanted her instantly.
And John will do it.
“For the love of.....”, by now his brother has stopped eating as well. Sherlock can feel him getting aggravated.
“Wait”, John said. Still so concerned. “Who are you?”
Mrs. Holmes and her daughters were having a ball this evening and John would be in charge of taking care of the horses of the lords and ladies that attended.
His eyes seem too small like this and his cheekbones far too pronounced without his curls to hide them from sight.
“But......how?”
God, he hopes John didn't see him staring.
“I might take up canoeing while I'm there.”
'I have bad news, John.'
He wishes he had had time to do research before coming over to John's actual house.
This gentle, uncomplicated comfort.
“Oh...gosh....I really don't know”, John replies, trying to sound as innocent as he possibly can and failing utterly.
Sherlock didn't reply.
I glance at him and he actually does look like he's in pain.
“I have the answers to the test right here”, he says as he waves the envelope he's holding around. “I told you I wouldn't lie to you.”
But John is not here.
To have a girl who I've just met see through me in a minute?
He sighs, bites his lip and hazards a look at John's table.
“John....my name is John.”
“Now I know why you're so lovesick. He's just about the straightest guy at school. Very popular too. He's had scores of girlfriends.”
Within the familiar folds of her own face, today, she sees another.
She looks at him and once again John has the feeling as if he is finally able to catch a glimpse of what lays behind the mask again but its gone before he is absolutely sure about what he sees.
Sherlock knows he should be worrying about getting to talk to Hooper, about the magpie, about all kinds of possible dangers from Morgana....from beyond the veil.
(See the end of the chapter for
Wherever John leads him he will follow.
You can hope for a different outcome time and time again but the words are already there on the page. They will not alter themselves every time you close the book just because you wish it were so.
The smile on the stranger's.....Sherlock's face widens.
friend's shoulder.
Because, why is John late then?
The feeling of his breath on the back of Sherlock's neck.
He can't find it in him to get himself even somewhat presentable.
He hands me his phone and I take it with shaking fingers. I add myself to his contacts and hand it back.
John shakes his head.
It definitely doesn't feel like a smile this time.
“I miss you every goddamn second of every goddamn day, you know that right?”
John shrugs again.
John is reminded of the evening they had spent together on the bleachers. After the game. On the field people had been talking, dancing....drinking, but Sherlock had chosen to sit alone. Way up on the bleachers.
A sudden gust of wind, blowing a stray, dark curl across his face only seemed to enhance the effect.
And where Sherlock had thought he had been the only one with insecurities it appears that John, stunning and perfect John, surprisingly has plenty of his own.
But it was never supposed to be like this.
Whether he dreams it or whether he is awake.
He just gives her a radiant smile and shakes her hand.
And then there were the events at the field. Sherlock had brought him to a gateway through the mist he and Finn had closed off years ago. But, as with all closed off gates, some magic still lingered there.
When they are both presentable again Sherlock goes to unlock the door.
happen. A whole lot of nothing seems to keep on happening. Because, apparently, that's how John wants it.
And as his fingers lost contact with the wall on his left and the fingers of his right hand had not yet found anything solid to touch upon on the other side, for a moment, he felt as if he was floating in inky black water.
************************************************
He coughs again and the sound is just as out of place the second time.
Two more sets of feet.
John does look at him then. Maybe it is the setting of the two of them playing cards and Holmes being entirely too good at it, but he is suddenly reminded of all the rumours about Holmes' gambling addiction and the subsequent loss of the family fortune because of it.
Over time the pain had lessened to a level that he had been able to bear and he had found himself growing fond of Sherlock.
His cheeks flushed. His hair already pleasantly mussed and his skin has a slight sheen all over. The team has most likely been busy warming up and he has already worked up a bit of a sweat.
“I think I'm going to break up with her”, John says.
My breath leaves my heavy chest on whispered wings and disappears into the inky night that cloaks the bedroom around me.
Finn likes watching Mycroft when he either doesn't know Finn is there or has gotten so engrossed in the task at hand that he seems to just  have forgotten Finn is there.
“I've only brought it up”, he says in a conspiratorial whisper as he leans in close, “because I worry about you John. I worry about your grades.”
A storm gathers.
Just....being.
The pale faces of her mother and father.
'So I have.....so I have.'
“You were, weren't you?”
For what John offered him once.
I follow him and as soon as I am inside he locks the door behind me.
Trust John to notice it though.
A dimple forms in his left cheek and for a moment I really don't know what to say but eventually I just go with: “good morning.”
That he will run.
Just a couple more steps and he'll reach the doors himself. To his own surprise he finds he's looking forward to find what lies beyond.
'Mycroft?' he had tried again. Slightly louder.
Surely.
Once again Sherlock wishes he could bury his nose in the crook of John's neck and just stay there.
Sherlock's first instinct is to shake his head. Definitely not. He's just as strong as John is when it comes to weathering the elements. But halfway through the head-shake, his damp curls sticking to his forehead slightly, he changes his mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come closer.” The figures speak again and this time one stretches out a long, pale and slender arm towards him.
He tries again.
This time the kiss is more tender. There is less anticipation in it. They both know what to expect.
It would complicate things.
“You could have told me later.”
Sherlock just laughs, twirls him around and pulls him close again.
In hindsight there were signs. Of course there were signs. There are always signs.
Even if he had wanted to he wouldn't have been able to climb back up again. His arms were tired and his hands were cramping where they clung to his bedroom curtains just a little bit too tight.
He gives his friend a rather sheepish and guilty smile as he puts his phone back in his pocket and then........my own phone vibrates.
If that's the reason why he seems so unbothered by it all.
His mind kept wandering to Mary....to Holmes.....
On the screen the name “John Watson” can be seen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Swirling shapes and colors in the dark.
“I'll never be as good as you”, he says, “you're amazing!”
My mouth has suddenly gone dry and I'm having a hard time swallowing. I try to swallow anyway against the lump that has formed in my throat but there doesn't seem to be a way to get rid of it.
Andrew slides his seat just so that all my hopes of catching even the smallest of glimpses of John's face are now well and truly lost.
John always felt just a little bit nervous whenever he stepped out from under the trees and onto the grass, but every single time Sherlock was there and at the sight of him his nerves evaporated like morning dew at the rising of the sun.
As the last of the borrowed magic burns out, the threads in her hands turn to ash and slip through her fingers.
I stubbornly carried on existing but was lost. Adrift at sea and no longer able to find the shore now that my trusty lighthouse had dimmed, crumbled and gone out.
I have come to the conclusion that trying to hide and be unnoticed here had been an utterly ridiculous plan.
********************************************************
I try to warn them.
Someone moans....it might be him....it might be Watson....it might be the both of them.......Sherlock is having trouble discerning where he ends and Watson begins.
In the end it had been inevitable.
John is glad to be back.
The touch of his fingers light, almost reverent. Sherlock is reminded of fireflies again and he smiles as he closes his eyes.
'Now you listen here', his father spat out, 'we have been over this countless times, but it just does not seem to sink into that soft, stupid omega brain of yours. Bonding is the
It does not matter that you have not reached the final chapter yet. The words are already there. They are just quietly waiting for time to pass and for you to find them there. On the final page.
But he will have to apologize first.
“Well? Anything?” Finn asked.
Sherlock is just carrying on as if nothing has happened at all.
Finn repeats his question.
“Okay?”
Next chapter: the reunion. Finally. I've found not having Holmes and Watson together slightly less fun to write.
His last inhaled breath filters back out past his half  opened lips and it dissipates into the room around them.
Demanding and yet considerate.
The time he spent with Sherlock had been pretty hectic and he doesn't really remember all the details of it very clearly.
Now with paternal Greg.
'You were supposed to wait for me at the school entrance, young man', his mother said as soon as she reached them. Her voice high and loud. As it always was when John was in deep, deep trouble. 'I have been looking all over for......' it was then that she suddenly noticed Sherlock standing there. His hair mussed up, face flushed, lips swollen from kissing John, his shirt untucked, partly open around the neck where the beginnings of some phenomenal hickeys could be soon. John was all too aware of what this looked like and he wished he could turn back time. Go back to when they were still together in the shed. When it had seemed they were the only two people in the world. God only knew what kind of wrath his mother would rain down upon them now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Greg laughs again and shakes his head in disbelief.
John looked out the window again.
I'm really getting into this story again.
And so he turns his mind to something else.
But still.....he feels nothing but peace.
It was hard not to be happy with John around.
Once he became a bonded omega he could do none of those things. Especially not if he bonded to one of the lords. An omega was far too valuable a possession to have them riding around the countryside unattended. All on their own.
Sherlock is still so cool and calm and.....just so 'him'.
Sherlock has never had sex. He's only kissed that one time.
Sherlock finds solace in the fact that, although they might be heading in different directions, for the time being, the sun and the moon still occupy the same sky.
This will have to do for now because I am all out of writing time for the forseeable future.
Finn's expression sours as he climbs a small hill in order to soak up the last of the moonlight before she dips down behind the horizon and the scorching sun takes her place.
Maybe he won't die just yet......maybe he's already dead.
But relationships.....involvements......call it what you will, things like this, they are usually kept secret.
John looked over his shoulder to where Finn was standing. Not sure how to phrase what he wanted to ask but the elf seemed to understand him nonetheless.
I don't react. I don't know how to react. I feel frozen. I feel confused. I don't know how I feel.
His lips are gently folded into a soft and relaxed smile that only gets bigger when he sees Sherlock notice him.
Snuff out her light and replace all with darkness.
'Good evening to you too', he replied. A smile forming on his face as he looked John over.
This was his second week of studying with Sherlock, but he found he couldn't really  concentrate on his work today.
He needs to not think so much.
The entire theater-class?
There is a sudden vibration in the back-pocket of my jeans.
John feels his blood run cold.
This is it, John thought, he is going to send me away. Why else would he be here. He clearly remembers what happened last night and probably does not want the truth to be spread amongst the household. What with his reputation being on shaky ground at best and all the rumors that are already making the rounds.
I take the bus into the city and then another bus to get me closer to the movie theater and so of course I end up getting there a good 40 minutes early because public transportation apparently still hates me.
But no less powerful for it.
There's only so much cleaning up you can do at a bathroom sink.
In the bed John stirs:
Not for the first time in his life John silently cursed his leg. Any other night of the year he would have been perfectly capable of sending this gentleman on his way. At the moment however his left leg was completely useless to him. He was more or less holding himself upright by his arms which he had firmly planted on the crate behind him and with the gentleman leaning in so closely he saw no way of changing his position.
He'd rather not think of Morgana any more than is necessary.
John wasn't his. Could not be his. Would never be his.
The curtains are opened the tiniest of cracks, it's all Sherlock can handle at the moment, and they've both got paper cups filled with tea.
But I still do.
Maybe he only changed his mind after I pushed him against a wall and put my hand down his pants....
'I am not hiding in your suitcase.'
I only partially register another body crouching down in front of me. Another hand stretching out to make a grab for the sheets of paper strewn around at our feet.
He is way.....
he is “Person X”.
He looks at me and it's almost as if he's trying to ask me a question but I just can't tell what it is.
Sherlock smiles too.
'It's been a while', Sherlock ended up saying. Apparently something about the casual setting of just the two of them in the coffee place made Sherlock more willing to share details about his personal life than usual.
“I will rip out your fingernails one by one and use them to pluck out your eyeballs”, she says.
Mary points at the door again.
A quick update? From me? Impossible.
“Of course not Mrs. Hudson.”
Birds.
It's been too long.
John swallows.
Has been able to feel it during the entirety of their frantic run here.
As it turned out Sherlock was in a much better mood that day.
He's fairly certain John doesn't know it was him that threw up all over his shoes.
“Yeah, you?”
And now he can.
*****************************************************
John can't help but smile.
At the knowing that this is finite and life is finite and maybe this is the last time I see him but if we don't say goodbye then we won't know for certain until it actually happens and, for the moment, that leaves you with a bit of hope at least.
'When did he leave?' panic clung to the edges of his words now mixed with a hint of fear.
And as the corners of John's mouth turn up in just the barest hint of a smile Sherlock is now absolutely sure he's on the right track.
It still won't budge.
Sherlock wonders how long he's been awake for.
He's always thought so.
Finn just smiles like the cat that got the cream. Not for the first time Sherlock wishes he could punch him. He still feels the faint ache of the bruise Finn left on his own face a couple of nights ago when Sherlock had tried crossing the Veil.
The question keeps changing.
About them?
John wouldn't really know what to say anyway. He is so very new to this world. He's not sure what to do now. Going inside doesn't seem like a good option. For one because from what they can tell by peeking around the corners of the door there is absolutely nothing left of the inside and also because he's afraid the structure will collapse on top of them as soon as they even try and open the door any further.
A million thanks to anybody who is still reading along.
“My brother had maps”, Holmes says, shaking John out of his own contemplations, “and on one of these maps there is a location marked by a drawing of a magpie. I never really thought much of it.....in fact.....I had completely forgotten about it, until you and Finn mentioned the magpie the other night.....I'm sure my brother was on to something......must have been.....”
'Why else would I be here?'
Not at all.
But he also cannot avoid John for the duration of his summer break.
You expect to leave them behind once the season changes.
Sherlock doesn't do well with goodbye's.
It's light blue, high collared, with a matching darker blue waist coat.
“Sometimes I just like looking at you.”
He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath and tries again.
'If it's not too much trouble'.
And then another.
John messes up one of his lines....again, and Molly giggles as she twirls her hair between her fingers.....again.
He is reminded of memories he hasn't had yet but knows he will have someday.
Not quite yet.
At that point he seemed to have regained the use of his vocabulary.
He hopes John understands what he's trying to tell him.
I do not look for John in the cafeteria.
She's gotten pretty good at detecting my 'moods'. She knows that sometimes it's best to just leave me alone.
Every time John calls him he vows to himself that this.....surely, this will be the last time he takes John up on his offer.
His marriage to his mother a loving one with two children as the end result.
“Does Mary know you're cheating on her with Mr. Freakshow here? Tell me, which one of you is “the girl” I bet it's you, isn't it?”
They're over.
bond. Either you choose your own mate from the lords of the neighboring counties or I will choose one for you. These are your options, John. So pick one.'
'Piss off'
Sherlock finds it harder and harder to look at him as he is now.
Not with Holmes begging him to touch him.
“Perhaps we should sleep on it tonight and talk about.....this.....in the morning.....when we're both sober.....” Holmes had said.
With Holmes now no longer beside him the entire evening immediately feels like a strange dream to him.
John sighs again.
'About time you buried him then', a full smile was now firmly on Finn's face as he produced a piece of paper from within the confines of his riding jacket.
This chapter just popped up in my head and I thought: "might as well write it down."
He feels strangely protective of Sherlock.
To his surprise John doesn't even look the least bit fazed.
The night is too still, too calm, around him.
Okay.
“Thank you”, I say again. I remember John's angry look as Andrew and I moved along with the ebb and flow of the beat. Maybe I had misinterpreted it....
Just for a little while longer.
His perfect everything.
The bartender gives him another look but, once again, says nothing.
A rare sighting of the sun coming out at night to shine on the moon.
Sherlock gives him a smile but it's almost.....sad?
They have changed each other because they had time to do so.
“I know where he is.....it's not far......he's only just left with her”, Holmes says, “come on, Watson! We can still catch him!”
This would be a phenomenally bad idea.
“What we found?” he asks. He still does not understand.
One of these days she will kill him....after he has served his purpose........but not yet.......the King says he still needs him and so she keeps him alive.
For some reason John was mad at him and Sherlock had no idea why.
My shoulder jostles painfully and unexpectedly with one of them -
“Did you know I have a sister?”
Watson is reading some book or other on botany.
After months spent mostly in cold, detached silence John was slightly taken aback by his father's sudden question.
“See you tomorrow then, yeah?” John says.
He wants to give her a snarky reply but he still has a headache and his mind feels as if it's stuffed with cotton making it hard for him to come up with something clever. So, in the end, he just decides to not say anything at all. It will vex her equally.
And then, slowly and ever so carefully, another body places itself behind him on the narrow bed and a warm hand comes to rest lightly on his hip.
How.....
It was then that Sherlock had looked up. Into John's bright blue eyes. His radiant smile. His perfect face. All of it inches away from Sherlock. All of his attention directed at him. So close....
Maybe they  never will again.
I spend the rest of the day in bed.
Maybe Molly isn't coming after all.
Regret about us? About me?
And then:
He lets them both leave to go to Holmes Manor to figure out what the best course of action is and just prays Holmes will come to the right conclusion in the end.
Sherlock can't sleep, though not for lack of trying.
Holmes' chambers.
Once again Sherlock's thoughts drift to John's number in his phone.
He wants to say so many things.
Finn had left them both soon after that.
Afraid for the near future and what it might bring them.
Always there but never really there for him.
“You are here to talk about our break-up?”, he asks.
John......
He might have.
There are doors in my  mind and memory that I keep closed for a reason. Times and places I never want to go back to and certainly not now.
'You play the violin?' he found himself saying. Eyebrows raised and an incredulous smile on his face. A small bit of information Sherlock had decided to share with him after he himself had confessed to playing the clarinet for all but three weeks in a misguided attempt to try and woo a girl in the school band. Turned out she was not interested in the least and John had no talent to play the clarinet at all. The term “the sound a tone-deaf drowning cat would make while it's being simultaneously strangled” had been used to describe his skills.
“I've seen that medallion many times....I've held it once even.....sure, it is special but it is not
If he looks up he can see stars.
*******************************************************************************
Oh boy, this story is not getting any views at all but, I'm sorry, I'm hooked on this idea. So expect more chapters. Terribly sorry.
Andrew laughs with me.
There was something about Sherlock that instilled in him a sense of calm and security that he had not felt before.
John's lips are slightly parted.
“My brother has.....issues”, Mycroft says. He expresses himself so delicately. John feels he would make a fine politician.
*************************************************************************
This is one subject he will not yield on.
He was about to call out for Sherlock again when suddenly two hands encircled him from behind and grabbed him loosely around his waist.
But not anymore.
*******************************************************************************
*********************************
He could, however, see that he was completely alone.
See: less angst this time.
It was all fine to stare at a sleeping Watson in the dreamlike glow of the moonlight. But in the harsh light of day......it's all too real.
Know each other's hearts and minds and no amount of time or distance between them is able to change that.
John gives me a blank look and I can't help but chuckle just a little bit. I like him when he lets his guard down. When he looks non-plussed.
She glances at the rugby table again.
He's looking at me again but, even though he has pulled his hood all the way back, I find his face unreadable.
On more than one occasion has he felt his cock stir as a reaction to merely thinking of John naked.
About John's deceased former lover.
Sherlock is not so much paying attention to anything John is saying but his eyes follow the pattern his hands make as he waves them through the air in front of him.
Or....
“Your brother”, John says by way of explanation.
“Look after him if something happens to me.”
Just so he doesn't look like such a creeper.
How can any one single person be this sexy.
He puts his hand against the wall in front of him and small particles come loose underneath his fingers and fall away towards the darkness around his feet.
“Was I that obvious?”, I say. Still slightly coughing.
And as the moon rises higher and higher in the sky, replacing the golden light of the setting sun, suddenly its silver light hits her mirror at just the right angle.....and then she sees it and wonders why she hadn't seen what it was before.
He had wanted to die.
Bill had answered.
John is calling.....
Thoughts and memories drift into his mind's eye one after the other, break apart or merge together to form a jumbled mess and he slowly finds himself sinking into them.
Next to me he just chuckles at my clumsy and unsuccessful fingers.
'No!', John shot up in bed. For once he was dreaming something nice and now his dream was already trying to leave him? Not on. 'Don't go', he said weakly as he let himself fall back to his pillow and closed his eyes. Even just sitting up had drained his energy completely.
'I commend your bravery, John. I had expected nothing less of you, but in this case it would be better if we were able to avoid a fight altogether.'
And as he takes down two mugs from the kitchen cabinet John wishes he was still holding Sherlock's hand.
Mycroft rubs his temples with his fingers as he closes his eyes and inhales sharply through his nose and Sherlock experiences a small sense of victory but, somehow, it's not quite as sweet as he had imagined it to be.
When the daily sounds of the hospital and the city outside have quieted down and there's nothing left to distract him from his own company and his own thoughts and mind.
“Well....it's not so much what they say as their attempts to beat me up.”
Being close together.
Holmes, Finn, Molly......
(See the end of the chapter for
Finn closes the door behind him.
“....for a bit.....get to know each other a bit better.”
And if her spell works the way she has intended it to work Sherlock Holmes is already on his way.
*********
John couldn't believe his ears. Here he had been these last three weeks trying to come up with some form of apology for his own actions that night and now Holmes had beat him to it. Surprising him once again, like a breath of fresh air.
I take more after my father.
When I get back to my bedroom there are two paracetamol and a glass of water on the bedside table.
“So”, she says, even before she sits down, “tell me everything.”
It means the world to me.
This late in the afternoon there are hardly any people left on campus. Sherlock is glad for it.
He needs to not feel so much.
He tries focusing on Finn again but there are clouds in his mind still and his thoughts are getting lost in them.
It takes them the entire night and most of the next day to get back to Holmes Manor.
John can relate.
But everything ends.
It's worth a shot to take a trip down to the stables.
I wish I had seen him.
They just fuck.
“Hey”, John says, once again his voice the honeyed sweetness I used to find myself gladly drowning in, “are you alright?”
*************************************************
John tastes like life and sweetness.
'I think I'm ready', he said, stretching his back as well, 'at least I hope to god I'm ready. I'd hate to think this was all for nothing. I'm used to rugby, but who knew math could be such a work-out.'
He should have taken Holmes' arm, shaken him, waking them both, he should have demanded him to tell, once and for all, exactly what was going on.
It was then that, just for a second, his vision temporarily went completely white. As if he had been struck by a flash of lightning.
His heart races at about a thousand beats per minute. Fast, erratic, afraid.
'I did not kill anyone if that's what you're wondering.'
“It's like with you and Finn”, John says, “his love for you ended up saving your life.”
“Who are you?” Sherlock asks.
Smiling at him while nervously holding his cup of coffee.
Sherlock doesn't reply.
Another silence fell heavy between them before John could find it in himself to speak again.
John didn't mind too much. His shoulder and leg always fared better when the temperature rose.
He will be leaving tonight.
“Just why?”
Watson actually laughs at this. The sound is honest and warm and Sherlock stores it away in his mind-palace as well.
The sun's rays filter through them as if they weren't there.
People you care about disappear.
And maybe I should feel a little bit hurt or insulted by the fact that, even though he has asked me out, he is still trying to hide me.
“We should probably go back inside”, John says as he throws him a weak and nervous smile, “we don't want to be late for our final performance.”
“Maybe we should take a break”, John says.
“Alright. You are dismissed. But do not let me catch you up there again, Mr. Watson!”
John takes care of Holmes.
*********************
He is briefly reminded of John's love of James Bond and he smiles to himself.
Maybe it's the loneliness.
Sherlock sees this now.
They've kissed so many times by now that Sherlock has lost count but somehow it's different this time.
“Disappointing. So much for leaving a couple of protective and offensive spells with you just in case then.”
Sherlock tries to memorize everything about John while he still can. Now that he'll be leaving in just a couple of weeks.
I cringe but John just laughs.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. Not bad indeed. It was worse than bad. It was the worst. He's eager now for his turn to read and his hands slightly tremble as Molly finishes her part. She's chosen one of Helena's Monologues.
Leave a comment if it so behooves you.
“Enter”, Sherlock says. His voice sounding alarmingly loud in the dimly lit room.
Make plans for what to do next. Find the magpie. Find out what it means.
*****************************
Letting the clear water cool him down inside and out.
It's well past midnight now. Not a snowball's chance in Hell that he'll be able to get Sherlock something in return.
The man stops.
John's next words are a question but Sherlock still cannot find within himself the strength to answer with words and so he just nods again.
The honeyed light of the early sunrise uses his fluttering eyelashes as springboards and dives into the blue pools of his eyes as he opens them.
Sherlock's skin is soft and warm and he really hopes that, someday, he'll get the chance to explore more of it.
'It's not for her', he had said.
Holmes' neat clothes lay forgotten in a heap on the floor by the foot of the bed.
“I just don't feel like I should have to share something so intimate with everyone”, John says.
Sherlock often wonders how John has kept their....affair......from his girlfriend for as long as he has.
Or...I don't know....ask the geography teacher I hired for you that you never make use of!'
'Don't hurt our child. I beg you.'
“Well....your part anyway”, he adds.
And so, now, he also meant everything to Finn.
Just assuming things has already almost made him miss out on John once in his life, he can't believe he almost made the same mistake twice.
“I should go”, he says, it's getting late.”
But that will have to wait.
There is nobody else who can possibly know about John and I, John's made sure of that. He systematically ignores me if we're anywhere where other people can see us.
“If you don't mind me saying so, sir”, the girls says, “Master Holmes.....your “friend” is very handsome....you both are.”
He also got a girlfriend.
“Ehm....yeah.....sure......I guess....”,Sherlock still seems lost. One hand still in his curls as the other is now desperately trying to straighten out his t-shirt.
But now I find myself transported back once more.
But this time not because he is plagued by terrors in the night.
“I'm sorry to hear that”, Sherlock says. He's really not.
So......
Sherlock cannot do that to John.
The soldier offers Molly his arm and she takes it. As she does so, Sherlock gives the soldier a look she can't quite place.
And so I just do what I can.
“This can only mean trouble. I'd stay home if I were you.”
A smiling John Watson is a thing of beauty and he finds himself getting lost in the radiance of it all.
John knows who Mycroft is.......
“It's complicated”, I end up saying. And I hate that that's how I have to describe what we have. Because it's not complicated at all. None of John's rugby-friends seem bothered by the fact that I'm gay. Patrick is openly asking me questions about it and this is only the second time I've met him.
Sherlock is mostly functioning on auto-pilot. The lines leave his mouth but his mind is somewhere else completely.
Sherlock wanted to answer but he didn't know what to say. His entire world had pretty much just ended and, if he did open his mouth, he was also running the risk of throwing up a second time.
Holmes has reached the outside doors now and is making his way through them. Out into the dark night.
John is here.
He would hate to die screaming or crying.
It will be good to finally get answers about what exactly they are dealing with, about Watson, about what he is, what he can do.....but.....he is afraid those answers also might end up breaking things they've only  just recently started building.
'I called for you too.'
Shiny, colorful and mesmerizing to look at, but, when it comes right down to it, bad for your health and almost impossible to get rid of.
“Is there anything you want me to say to him........from you?”
Not yet....but maybe someday....a boy can hope.
Holmes gets in the carriage and John closes the door behind him. For the first part of their journey they will still be separated and they won't really be able to speak to each other.
And so he remained clothed and stepped outside.
But apparently Sherlock does do Christmas. Just.... not with John.
Sherlock.
Doesn't even try to look at me.
She is much too small for him to worry about.
There's a young lady with long blond hair that falls down her elegant, pale neck in perfect curls standing in front of him.
'I don't care', he said. Matter of factly.
I've just missed the bus again because apparently this day
“Not in the least”, he replies. The thought of what might happen tomorrow frightens him more than he can put into words right now.
The.....
Now that the room darkened around them and candles were being lit to keep the night at bay memories of it came creeping back. The soft touch of a hand. The small lines that formed at the corners of Holmes' eyes when he smiled at him. It had all felt so personal.....so real......
It feels as if he is whole once more.
“Oh no”, he says, “I'm not going to tell you. Figure it out for yourself, pretty boy.”
Sea blue eyes and his blond short hair sticking out at odd angles.
'How do we do that then?' he asked. Making sure his wording included them both as well.
John felt like he had put up with a lot of harassment and nonsense over the last couple of days, but as Wallace's tongue slithered across the whorl of his ear like some kind of slimy fish something in him snapped.
John is more than a little impressed.
He had put John in danger. Grave danger. Morgana was not someone to be trifled with.
“Did.....something happen between you and Victor?”, John asks.
Holmes' slight hesitation before the word “friend” has not gone unnoticed by him.
Their mouths are empty.
“So we both heard it then?”
John leans himself forward, his gaze following the direction Sherlock is pointing in.
Just for a second John had a vision of a black horse with a hooded rider silhouetted by a lightning streaked sky, but as he blinked his eyes the vision was gone and it became apparent that it was just one of the guests arriving late as a young nobleman with fair hair was guiding a dapple gray horse inside.
Sherlock makes a face.
“Oh”, John says as if Sherlock has just woken him from a daydream, “I thought it would be nice to see the sunrise together......or......you know.......romantic......or whatever.....”
“Nonsense”, Holmes replies, “money is not important.”
What was he even to Sherlock? A means to an end? Another high to chase?
Holmes however seemed to grow uncomfortable, misinterpreting John's stunned silence, 'I'll leave you to your chores again', he said with a curt nod. Voice tense and cold and his posture stiff.
Actually hurt. I might as well have physically struck him. And suddenly I think back on the bruise on his face. But somehow I can't quite bring myself to ask about that again.
It had all ended with Mary demanding his set of spare keys back and proceeding to flush them down the toilet once he handed them over to her.
Tanned skin.
“They're like tiny stars......”, John's voice had been soft and full of awe.
Always in the background.
You must have known.
“With you back here at Eton this year”, John says, “you know......with your peers.....clever, well-off and handsome boys.......I was afraid that, perhaps, you had met someone more on your level........I don't know.....”
John shrugs as if that explains it even more and then he actually stretches out his hand towards Sherlock's face, twists a stray curl around his finger and tucks it back behind his ear before he casually brings his hand back to the cup of coffee he's currently drinking.
“Both.”
You probably thought you'd seen the last of me, right?
Pictures of John and his parents.
Drained of its comforting toxins.
“Still dating your rugby-man?”, he asks.
It looked familiar.
There is a word then, whispered softly against his partially opened mouth.
you think and it's keeping me awake.”
He always does.
Beside him Finn sits straight. His eyes shine like rubies in the light of the moon and there are drops of water in his hair that make it seem as if he's wearing a crown of stars.
“Hello, my name is Sherlock Holmes”, I say.
Of course, sir.
This is why I don't do endings.
He's going to tell her he doesn't like her and to stay away from him and he's going to call her 'Crazy Molly' and it will all be because of me and no amount of chocolate in the world will be able to cheer her up for quite a while.
They both had laughed at that and Mike had given him a slap on the back. John had tried not to wince as his injured shoulder stung in protest.
This time Sherlock does look up from his book. Evidently having picked up on the rising anger in John's tone of voice.
John kisses him softly again and this time he tastes of the purest ambrosia.
Sherlock sighs again.
All this time he has been silently wishing for an apocalypse but what if John is his apocalypse....because, surely, one of these days, he will be the end of him.
But he really thought they didn't do Christmas.
Molly's smile falters somewhat.
In this imaginary place you fashion rooms for yourself. You order these rooms. Make them distinguishable from each other. You can decorate their walls with paintings, wallpaper or vibrant colors if that helps you remember more effectively and in each room you place your memories in a way that works for you.
His inexperience written all over his face.
But in the end Sherlock did find out which day in his life was the price Mycroft had had to pay for his vision.
John's not sure if he believes him.
*****************
And even now in the dark of his bedroom he could still vividly remember how Holmes' eyes had glowed bright blue when he had continued speaking:
This last year he had learned that people who barely knew you tended to have a habit to make up all sorts of stories about you if how you looked or acted was a bit out of the ordinary. He'd had his fill of rumors, thank you very much. And he tended not to listen to them. Mike had told him all about Holmes Manor and it's inhabitants though and he did remember the bulk of the story.
'You have a motorcycle?! Why am I not surprised'  there was a hint of amused exasperation to Johns voice.
His heart had started up again, but it seemed to have moved away from his chest to his throat where it now beat irregularly and made it hard for him to breathe.
Sure, they haven't really been getting along since they met a couple of months ago by the luck of the draw that is “room assignments”, but for John to play a prank like this on him seems sort of.....out of character.....
And so I take one more deep breath, splash some water on my face and head back out into the theater.
~ Vanimelda
I feel turned on and embarrassed at the same time.
John's hair still slightly wet and slicked back from the afternoon swim they've had.
“Since we're having so much trouble with these phone calls how about you write me a letter.”
The dark man just raises his free hand and, where Sherlock's magic is made up out of light, his magic is made up out of pure darkness. Look at it for too long and you'd swear you'd gone blind.
“Please”, I say again, “hold on to this for later.”
Sherlock let's out a giggle and with the sound the last of the remaining tension seems to leave his body too until nothing is left but languid leisure brought about by the warm embrace of the sun.
But he decides to save those questions for a later date.
“Will you stay?”, he asks.
He half expects the door to be locked and, for a moment, as his trembling fingers push against the heavy wood of the door, that seems to be the case....but then.....a soft click....and the door swings open before him.
Maybe I shouldn't have gone looking for him.
Like last week. When he had given John this medallion to “protect him” and had refused to say any more on the matter and had disappeared before John even had a chance to ask him anything else.
So in his inebriated state he failed to directly answer Sherlock's question and just said:
Sherlock inhales sharply and John lets out a joyless laugh.
My hair has become a mess because his hands can't stop pulling on it and there's an unnamed fire in his eyes and molten lava that flows from his tongue unto mine.
Even though the fire is no longer blazingly hot John feels his face flushing too.
The classes go by in a bit of a blur but I'm sure it'll get better soon enough. I've never had too much trouble with learning and school-work.....yet another thing people seem to want to bully you about.
Silly John.
Sherlock isn't sure if this is the absolute best adaptation. The shop-lady might have just told John that to get him to buy the dvd. But it is a pretty good version. And certainly a complete version.....
Back then it was not easy for men like us to be who we were.
Sherlock seems to be calming down.
She looks so honest.
Because I am.
He knows that it is a necessity for the paramedics to be touching him, be this close to him, put their lips on his and put their hands all over his naked body but still.....some dark part of his mind wishes he could push them away and cover Sherlock's body with his own again.
The things John does to him....
The smile on Watson's face widens as he leans himself forward once more. His hands slowly making their way up Sherlock's body until they find a new resting place on the side of his neck.
Because I'm not good with this.
Sherlock is the first to recover. He just rolls his eyes in that very Sherlock way that John has come to know so well, turns his head to Sebastian and says:
Maybe Death isn't trying to hide itself as much as she initially had thought.
But Sherlock wasn't bad. Sherlock was good.
'He'll turn up. He always does. Though I wouldn't mind if he stayed away for at least a month more', a kitchen maid named Mary whispered to him before she got shushed by Mrs. Hudson.
“Hello, Greg.”
They do end up reaching the Hooper estate just before dawn. It is too early to call on Molly Hooper yet and they are both weary and tired from riding through the night.
“He seems to know you”, the other boy says.
***************************************************
Once the coffee is ready Sherlock's fingers will find something to do and he'll probably loosen up a bit.
Sherlock doesn't look at him. He stares down at his coffee instead.
'Indeed I am sir.'
Too large for him to decide on right here and right now and yet.....he feels as if a decision has to be made....rather sooner than later....before they both have turned to ash and the chance to enjoy each-others light and warmth has come and gone.
As if it can anticipate her moves and follow along but not exactly.
Can anything that only happens under the cover of night really be real?
Just great.
“She dies.”
But it isn't the world outside her window she is interested in.
“Why don't you take a seat next to Phillip”, the teacher says. Her voice has that edge to it that teachers think is helpful but only ever makes things worse.
His relationship with his mother, not having been that good to begin with, it had been his father who he had always looked up to, got gradually worse now that there was no one else left in the small house to serve as a buffer between them.
His heart still breaks when he remembers the sadness that had clung to every word.
Morgana revels in the fact that, one day, she will peel the flesh from his living body and eat it while he screams in agony and Holmes watches.
He had worked from dusk till dawn that day. Only taking small breaks here and there when he felt close to passing out.
Sherlock tried looking at her, but by now the internal fire had traveled further upwards and it nestled behind his eyes and made him see stars as his vision blurred.
For some reason he thinks that hiding John at Holmes Manor is the best solution to all of this and he is not open to any other options in the slightest.
************
Suddenly he was moving again as his father pulled him away from the wall and flung him to the ground.
“I already finished it.”
The aftermath of their confrontation with the dark man.
'We have to celebrate this', he said as he handed the test to Sherlock who took the paper from him and started going over John's answers.
Finn had shortly contemplated this option but in the end had decided against it.
I contemplate whether I should say anything about it to her or not but before I am able to reach a conclusion the doors to the cafeteria open and a rather rowdy bunch of boys streams in.
John is puzzled for a moment but before he can ask Molly to elaborate she has already turned around and is making her way back towards the house.
The world around him is hot and dry.
Because I feel I need to know today.
“Sssssh, it's alright.....it's alright. Just tell me what's wrong, puppet.”
'Where did you get that?' Finn's tone demanding and urgent. John saw no more reason to lie.
I let them be happy for now and hope they will remember it.
I don't know if he's doing it on purpose.
At least there was a small silver lining to John not being out, he thought grimly, if Bill thought John was straight at least he would be less likely to make a move on him.
He had just felt like such a scumbag.
John's house is nice. It suits him. It's small. Compact. To the point. What you see is what you get.
'Then what, John? What will you possibly do? I am your father, your alpha and your lord and master in every sense of the word.
From inside of the car only a loud sigh for an answer.
I don't know what to say. What I want to say and what I should say are two entirely different things and I can't seem to be able to find a proper middle-ground between them.
Molly gasps.
Sherlock nodded, 'let's go then.'
Forced to leave the place he had called home for many years and having no one to turn to for support but himself, John had wished on more than one occasion that it was he himself who had died and not his father.
Tam Lin himself is rather useless (don't get me wrong, I love him anyway). He gets himself in his current predicament because he literally falls from his horse while out hunting and the queen of fairies catches him.....wow.....well done Tam.....well done....
My hands seem to have developed a will of their own.
Tomorrow is Sunday and then after that Monday and I will see him again at school.
After about 15 minutes Johns mother and sister got back in the car. John stayed behind. His mother said something to him Sherlock couldn't quite hear from his position behind the tree and John waved his phone at her absentmindedly.
“I.....don't know.”
She makes him tea and asks him questions about the funeral of his father. Was there a big turn out, does he have a nice grave, was his mother very sad?
It cannot be Holmes himself. She has seen inside his mind. She has felt his thoughts corrupting and bending to her will with every step he took towards the Veil and her realm.
This line gets repeated several times. The repeated mention of the kilt is a nod to that.
A gentle hand was placed on his shoulder.
“How can you possibly know that.”
Apparently this was the right response because Miss Huntington gives him a broad smile and immediately starts talking again.
John's eyes are still closed. Sherlock lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding as he sinks his head back in the soft pillow beneath him and decides to  just stare at the ceiling for a while.
**************************************
His father squeezed just a little bit tighter causing John to retch.
Reborn and reforged by Watson's gentle touch and soft words.
Suddenly I don't want him to look at these pictures anymore. These frozen moments of a simpler time in my life. When Mycroft was still around and still cared, when I had sunny days out in the yard and all I worried about was catching frogs and.....
I might be staring at him.
“You know where to find me when you need me, Mycroft.
I don't want him to tell me that he's not sure and he needs more time and that he needs to think about things.
John just shrugs, something only halfway resembling a smile on his face.
John and I both still in our pajamas while my mother hums a song at the stove.
Sherlock eyes the almost empty glass in his husband's hand again.
John just gives him a smile, closes the curtains a little further, takes out a book and sits down in the corner of the room.
Or....after all that hasn't happened.
His breath formed a small, white cloud where he breathed, joining the ghostly armada of clouds that drifted overhead.
Not while he is surrounded by other people.
He hasn't seen John in two days.
There is so much he doesn't know.
'I used to take Mary here when we first started dating', John said and cringed internally. The almost pained expression on Sherlock's face told him this was exactly the wrong thing to say.
I can't sleep.
“It was fine.”
All good things come to an end.
*********************************************
“Just wanted to see if you needed anything.....or maybe if you'd seen something.”
She's no longer at any of the tables, she's not amongst the dancing crowd or in any of the groups that stand around and talk. They ask around if anybody has seen her leave but nobody seems to even remember she had been there in the first place.
Maybe he was still drunk.
He hopes that's what they are.
I just don't understand him and so far he has been unable to  make me understand him.
The rest of their journey was pretty uneventful. The sun had started to rise further, as it had done on countless mornings prior and would probably keep doing so indefinitely and by doing so it had cast a golden light that reflected quite beautifully off of Holmes dark, dew soaked, curls. John was mesmerized. Once again he was reminded of a fairy prince when he looked at his lord and master and he had half a mind of telling him so now that the atmosphere between them felt so amicable and relaxed, but in the end he decided to keep his thoughts to himself.
It was all rather serene, but for some reason he felt ill at ease. He felt watched. And even though the sun's rays now shone directly on him he shivered once again.
Morgana?” John hazards.
He gently squeezed their interlaced hands.
Mycroft has been able to do magic for years now and he never has any fun.
But as long as she keeps her eyes closed and focuses on the stars the shoot through the darkness there she can almost make herself believe.
Sherlock had been bored out of his mind.
If he had wanted to remember me he probably would have asked for my phone number.
The walls rebuild themselves. There are more jagged points and edges to them than there were before.
I groan as I close my eyes and take a moment to try and make sense of the world around me again.
All she could see was the soldier's Death. The woman in the pale robe. Lurking in the corner. Watching him. Unblinking. A smile on her face somewhere between amusement and boredom.
, he thinks.
“I need to tell you something.”
He had liked what he had seen.
Only for Him.
He doesn't know what he's looking for exactly.
A couple moments pass in silence before Molly speaks again.
'If we do this....there is no going back.'
She's probably worried.
Tonight, they find that they both much rather would just like to stay home anyway.
Him and all he stands for.
John felt like shrugging it off immediately, but a part of him was still giving his father the benefit of the doubt and so he endured the gesture and waited silently for what, in the end, his father had to say.
And what  makes him feel even worse is that he still wants.
****************************************
“Yup”, he says.
Holmes' surprised laugh is once again filled with fireflies and they dance around them in the night-sky like stars.
He had resigned himself to the probability of Holmes sending him away again. No doubt as soon as he realized John was still just a penniless, damaged soldier who couldn't even finish a war.
John rubs his eyes yet again.
“Is this why you've been blowing off the team? To go on dates with your boyfriend? Need me to get a candle for you two? More romantic.”
'Doesn't everybody?'
Something more.
Or maybe both.
I still don't look at her.
Finn has said something to him.
Holmes.
Maybe he just tells himself that he doesn't.
John is taken aback just a little bit by the use of his given name.
“And what is it that you do in the meantime? Huh? Gambling? Drinking? God help us all....”
So here is another chapter to celebrate!
I want the rest too.
, he thinks and gently places his palm on Sherlock's shoulder.
There are 7 figures in long, gray, flowing robes kneeling on the floor.
After everything they had been through together he felt his master owed him that at least.
It wasn't much and it certainly wasn't his dream job but it was something that helped him pay his bills and helped him afford his tiny London bedsit until he figures out how to move forward again.
And the small ember of hope bursts into flame and ignites John from the inside out.
Did Sherlock honestly think he would harm their child?
There is a strange look on his face.
“It's not like you to not know where your man is”, Finn continues.
Which turns out to be pretty hard to do because today
, he had said after her failed attempt to get him to cross the Veil.
If he had attended the family dinner.
Several times.
It takes him until sunrise to finally fall asleep after all.
It's heaven.
“Wow”, John says. His eyes are full of wonder as he catches some of the snowflakes in his outstretched hand. “they're warm!”
But for now it is just beyond his reach.
Or....not people exactly.
“Oh”,John says. And then after a moment he adds: “and what about your brother? When did you tell him?”
Maybe it's the bow that he's most perplexed about.
“Where's Molly?” he asks.
His eyes an ocean he finds himself drowning in.
John knew exactly what he was asking for and he wanted that too. Without breaking the seal of his lips he gave the smallest of nods and used his hands on Sherlocks backside to gently pull him closer. That was all the affirmation Sherlock needed. He moved his hands from Johns hair to the side of his face and started to move his hard member in and out of Johns mouth. At first he set a slow pace and moved in small increments, but as John started to moan around his cock his thrusts became more enthusiastic as he moved deeper and faster into Johns mouth.
This story just reached 100 subscribers and that is about 100 more than I ever thought it would get.
John should be here any minute.
It's Mary.
******************************
Sherlock wished he'd stay.
“Yes.....thank you.....sir”, he stammers and starts buttering a few slices of bread.
He misses it.
She must see the look of utter confusion on his face because a smile lights up on hers.
Had his erection waned somewhat during their conversation, he finds it is at full attention again now. Watson's answering hardness pressed up against his groin.
Because that is something that I do and that's solely mine and that I enjoy.
Finn seemed to know an awful lot about Mycroft. From what Sherlock can tell they have been close. Finn seems so sad. Whenever Sherlock thinks about him on that day the memory turns more blue still.
“I think”, Holmes says, “that....under the circumstances....when we're alone....you can still call me Holmes.”
Had Sherlock's words been soft and loving before they had nothing but sharp edges now. His father recoiled slightly at the sound of them.
The next card from the larger pile. He is holding it so that the value of it is still hidden from Sherlock and himself as he looks at his younger brother with a serious and questioning look.
Sherlock had had no idea. He didn't do friends. Well...he had Finn, but Finn had sort of happened to him.
“Does it matter?”
“Will you promise me one thing?” Mycroft had said.
Where John is tanned, muscular and broad shouldered, Sherlock is pale and skinny. Sure, he does have muscles but you'd have to look hard to find them. Not a single part of him is as well defined as John.
If only John would return. His stomach is in knots and he is experiencing a very real sensation that feels a lot like drowning in water.
A short silence falls between them. Around them a couple of bright stars start appearing in the ever darkening sky.
“How much time do you need?” he ends up asking Holmes.
But all he is, is worried.
“Oh for the love of......”
He is very aware of what John's favorite movie is.
But....then again.......he never really had John in the first place.
He locked the door behind him and sank down on his bed.
The answer is almost instantaneously:
***********************************************************
My mother actually goes out to buy John clothes and shoes. Seeing as he came here yesterday in sweats and rugby-attire and none of my clothes really fit him right.
“A magpie? It's a birthmark in the shape of a bird. Could be any bird. How are you so sure it's a magpie?”
But he can´t.
John gives him an incredulous look. “You're so full of shit.”
“Yeah....yeah...I'm ready.”
He sits on the chair at my desk, the bruise around his eye nothing more than a faint and ugly yellow mark at this point, and I sit on my bed. My shoes lie somewhere in a corner of my room and my socked feet dangle over the edge of the mattress.
No, you are not dreaming. This is real life.
It will only worry him needlessly.
. Surely I would have known.”
Sherlock remembers tracing those strong muscles with his hands as Watson had hovered over him naked on the bed.
Sherlock just waved as he lit another cigarette.
The words are not nearly sufficient for everything that he feels. They are not nearly enough. Not even close. They are not even what he means.
“John?” Sherlock's voice was surprisingly soft even though John's ear was almost pressed against his shoulder. The sound somehow reminded him of a purring panther and he couldn't help but smile as the rumble of it seemed to warm him up again instantly.
I deserve better than secret snogs in shittily lit storerooms.
And that would have honestly been fine too.
Not ever ever
The smile on Sherlock's face widens.
The look on Sherlock's face turned into something resembling a worried frown.
Comforting, safe and secure.
She must have had.
“Oh”, John says, “I must have misunderstood her then.”
is what he wants to say but in his dream this all seems to make perfect sense so instead he just smiles back and says:
It's as if the guy is made out of music. His limbs notes that come together to form the dark, seductive melody that is his body.
The ball is in John's corner now.
And yet....he feels watched.
He's awake.
Why had he even decided to talk to me?
Their pacing calm, steady and calculated.
There was anger first, how dare this man touch him like this.
Mrs. Hudson is silent for a moment and when John finally works up the courage to look directly at her the look she bears is.....sympathetic?
“It is a little bit”, John's tone is playful and soft and Sherlock simultaneously wishes they were and weren't sitting as close as they are now.
'What?' John asked. Still smiling.
But, once again, I find I cannot stay away from him.
He doesn't know why he's even thinking of drowning right now.
Dream Sherlock smiled.
If the John on holiday and the John here at school in his private life that he's lived for 17 years and counting are two vastly different people he has tried so hard to keep separate.
“How was it?”, he finds himself saying.
He thinks back to the last party he and John were both at......the party where he got drunk and vomited all over John's shoes.
The gathering of deaths open their mouths simultaneously in a silent scream. All except for her own death.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see you've finally woken up”, she says.
And as the man started kissing a path along his neck and John found himself unable to move away or even fight him off he felt a mixture of emotions.
He understands the struggle Holmes faces at the moment and so he lets them leave.
As he looks up at the moon he wishes for nothing more than to just be with John Watson again.
“Yes....and look where they are now.”
It didn't seem like it had.
Watson had taken it all rather well.
He should  know better by now. His step-mother is like a bloodhound. Once she is on the scent she will not give up.
His fingers have suddenly become restless..
It was all a bad dream.
The woman gives him a sad smile.
Is this too dark?
Although not quite as intense as before.
“I don't think I can make it up the stairs.......you'll have to carry me....”
Well, at least she wouldn't be able to chastise him about coming home inebriated, without his coat or wallet after having broken up with Mary.
“Gay”, he says.
Especially when the oldest son vanished in a similar fashion.
“Consider it a gift”, he says.
But Holmes won't be back until the evening.
Maybe she hated him most above all else?
Sherlock had become like a younger brother to him.
(Sorry, this chapter is rather short but I felt the subscribers of this story had been waiting long enough for an update. I'm planning to have the next chapter up soon too. It's done in my head, I just need to type it down. Consider this chapter a "teaser" if you will).
“I don't know how to flirt”, he ends up saying.
John finds himself smiling in return and as he gestures at the plane around them he says: “Evidently.....yes.”
I just shrug.
If that was a joke he's not sure if he gets it.
Molly looks away as she bites her lip.
******************************************
I know this story has been on the backburner for a bit but that sometimes happens to just about everything I write.
And then the floor around them lights up.
He'll go in and out quickly and see what there is to see.
'I've changed my mind.'
For a moment he goes tense and he lets out a startled yelp but soon enough he relaxes and wraps his own arms around me. His palms a reassuring warmth at the small of my back.
She had let herself believe it was the truth because she so desperately wanted it to be the truth.
This is how he likes sherlock best.
Mycroft is usually not someone who likes to use terms of endearment.
Broken pieces of glass lilttered around his feet. Glinting like diamonds in the fluorescent kitchen light. A symbol of the world that used to be so comforting, solid and kind falling to pieces all around him.
I guess there's some part of me that had hoped this new plan of mine would play out differently.
He is not expecting anybody this late in the evening. Maybe it's Mary.....but she hasn't even so much as looked at him ever since Mrs. Hudson caught them red-handed outside of Holmes' room.
He speaks to me in half formed thoughts and sentences but still the message is loud and clear.
“Just.....please don't die”, he says.
He made to roll over on his stomach and present as a good omega should, but Sherlock's hand on his shoulder stopped him from doing so.
He wonders what John is doing now.....where he is now.....probably somewhere in the servants quarters.....or just sitting outside...enjoying the sun.....after all the wind and rain they've been having, today is turning out to be a rather pleasant day.
The sound far too loud and grating to his own ears.
The look Holmes gives him then is so full of.....something.....it makes him shiver involuntarily as a cold chill runs up the back of his neck. Just a draft through the many cracks in the stable walls, he tells himself. But the inside of his mouth tastes like ash and bile and he has to put his cup down.
I still don't look at her.
He looks at the hotel-entrance. The weather outside is abysmal. The sky is gloomy and overcast and rain pours down in heavy, fat and cold drops.
'A bird? What kind of bird?'
With his goal now within reach all of the doubts that had plagued his mind while he had been cooped up inside for the last month with nothing to distract him from thinking came rushing back.
That he imagined everything that happened between them last night.
to make him feel alright again.
However beautiful, you can't really use a broken ashtray for its intended purpose anymore, now can you?
As he does so suddenly a gentle breeze picks up turning the night air into sound.
He knows what that sound means.
His hands have gone all clammy again.
He's done it before.
“I....erm...”, Holmes stammers, closes his mouth again, looks down at his half-dressed form, thinks things over for a moment and then decides to go in a different direction.
Every moment they spent together a harsh reminder that, in a couple of months, this would be the exact thing he would be missing and every moment spent apart now precious time lost.
So he had come up with an even better plan.
At first he thinks she isn't going to speak but then she takes a step forward, he notices her feet are bare, she stretches out one of her hands as if she is trying to reach for him but instead of completing the motion she just lets it hover there in the space between them.
“No”, she says, “but it spread like wildfire. I'm really sorry Sherlock. I know I haven't really been there for you as a friend lately but know that I am here for you now.”
I head upstairs to my room and remake my bed for the third time that day.
Laws of physics.
'Oh, that's too bad', Mrs. Hudson said as she clasped her hands in front of her chest, 'you know, she's been sweet on you from the moment she saw you.'
The words sting, like a slap to the face.
John hazards.
And that had been that.
Watson would probably not like it all that much if he did that. He probably should not make an enemy out of Watson at this very moment.
The first time had sort of been an accident....or.....rather....that's what he tells himself.
In his yard.
“You're here”, John says. And John doesn't sound disappointed at all. John sounds....happy.
And Finn had promised he would.
I absolutely do not know what 'those guys are like.'
, he thinks,
**********************************************
Sherlock's face is close to his own now, his eyes shine as John has never seen them do before, boring into his own as Sherlock rests his forehead against John's, sharing breaths in the intimate space between.
He silently wishes for a miracle to happen. For time to stop and keep them here forever. Like this. Relaxed. Friendly. Sharing a drink he might have put a little bit too much strawberry in. Watson doesn't seem to mind.
John shivered as he felt a slow trickle of sweat drip down his back. With a shout and a swift kick to its flanks he spurred his horse on to go even faster, but as the horse sped up on the uneven terrain John was jostled in the saddle most violently and, spurred on by the movement, another unwelcome wetness was starting to make itself known at his backside.
And this......
“It's quite alright..... but I do seem to recall I warned you about this specific party.”
Now Sherlock really wishes he could kill Finn.
It's a small book titled “How and What in Italian”.
Don't get attached and you won't get hurt.
John decides to start moving.
But the clouds above are far from empty as the sky grows darker still and not even half an hour later the light spattering of rain has transformed into a heavy downpour.
And Watson follows where he leads. His lips just as eager as Sherlock's. His grasping hands finding a home in Sherlock's jacket. Crumpling up the expensive fabric.
And there he is again.
'Is it now?' the grin spread even wider, making small creases appear at the edges of his mouth and the corners of his eyes. Somehow it made him look younger.
“I mean it”, he says.”......It is appreciated but......I will never be able to pay you back.”
I could not imagine myself without you and, with a naivety very unbecoming of me, for a while, I thought that was how it always would be.
“Hello, again.”
With a soft thud the dagger pierced flesh.
The elf has an inscrutable look on his face.
John actually laughs and the sound is warm and honest. John is not laughing at him, he's laughing with him.
His mind won't turn off.
Sherlock is following a boring lecture on biochemistry at the moment. He's having a hard time concentrating on anything else but the pulse beneath his skin.
At the sound of his voice I flinch and the pen drops from my restless fingers and rolls onto the ground.
Waiting.
'Yes. I'm sorry John. Matters at the moment are.....difficult.'
Deep down Sherlock knew he should be glad about this but still.....somewhere inside him a feeling of jealousy stirred again.
“I did know that much....yes”, he replies as he quickly glances over to Holmes.
He is avoiding eye-contact and instead looks at the crack between the hastily drawn curtains where the harsh light of day is slowly tearing apart the dream-like bubble they had seemed to find themselves in last night.
She gives him a warm smile and Sherlock's room number.
The words are harsh. He doesn't mean them, but at the same time he does.
For agreeing to wait.
“Yeah”, he says, “but I”m not going to follow in my father's footsteps.....I'm going to become an army doctor.”
He gently squeezes our joined fingers.
I marvel at the words he's typed out.
He needs to leave tonight and there is no one else they can involve. Not now that Watson seems to be part of all of this. He knows The Order too well.....knows what they're capable of......what happened to Mycroft once they got their hands on him....their father......
