Keeping his powers secret can be really annoying! Especially when ma refuses to believe that he’s 100% fine without the phone outside. Whatever.
John lightly cuffed the back of Dean's head in a joking manner. "Save some for the rest of the family, Einstein."
“ Quite a few people can’t use cleaning appliances.”
What was the chance that Balthazar and Mary attended the same laundromat regularly? Were they closer than he’d initially thought? Did he bury himself in his own grave? He shouldn’t have asked for his help. He should’ve known their ‘friendship’ would wind up biting himself in the ass.
about his sexual life? Had he been that transparent?
“Believe me, you really do not want to know.”
“Clarence, aren’t you going to open your eyes and say hi?” sassed who could be the one and only-
This one time Bela poured paste into his shoes in first grade and he tried to put them on and they did get on but ..they wouldn’t come off. She and Lilith and Josie laughed really hard and Dean didn’t cry! He didn’t, no matter what Benny says.
Dean whipped out the oven mitts off the little hook next to the oven like his ma taught him a long time ago and put them on his hands. They were kinda (super) big for his hands but he made it work. They sagged a little as he grabbed the pie out of the oven, and his wrist burned a little bit. “Sss! Ouch!”
And waited.
liked how cool he looked.
Would he be too big?
Ma smiled and softly chuckled at him. "Slow down, silly boy. You'll get a stomach ache."
“You’re a real assbutt to the person who drove you here, y’know. I could leave your French ass here to hike back to the cul de sac. That’d teach you.” grumbled an injured Castiel.
He walks into the house and bumps into Bella who’s.. In his house?
“Don’t be so crass, Cassie.” Zar reprimanded him with a motherly tone and rolled up a stray magazine he found on the dashboard. He smacked Castiel’s head with it like a dog.
Jo jerked the rusty car to a rough stop and unbuckled her seatbelt. The engine stuttered to a stop and hiccupped with overuse. “Last time I checked Mary didn’t mind if I came in for a shower, right? I need to grab a quick one before they come back, I’ve got work right after this ‘n all.” His mood quickly perked up at his prank’s plan coming together. He couldn’t let it show, though, she’d become suspicious.
Mary chuckled along to their small argument and handed Zar a cup of some nondescript detergent brand Castiel hadn’t the energy to analyze. It was bright orange and smelled decent. Not only that, but it was the perfect idea to ask Mary for her detergent, as she would’ve noticed that the quilt smelled different if they’d used anything else.
Okay, Castiel hadn't experienced the 'great things in life' according to Balthazar, but he'd been completely fine without knowing what a Hotdog on a Stick was! He'd woken up, eaten breakfast, gone to work, daydream of forcing his eight year old succubus neighbor to hold his children, and gone to sleep
“Is that.. Do my eyes deceive me? Why do you have Mary’s quilt?”
Charlie has always been really..
“Watch the company you surround yourself in, Novak. It says a lot about you.” John stomped away, broad shoulders lightly sprinkled with rain drops and permanent wrinkled frown plastered onto his face.
A friend of Mary's? When had he been upgraded to that? How did she know that he’d been conversing with Mary at all? Is it painted on his face that he is close with the Winchester family? With Dean Winchester?
Typing back, Dean started thinking back to Cas, he thought about who he was with last night. The Kelly questions are really important ‘cause if Cas is friends with her, does that mean Dean has to be friends with Bela? Gross! Bela is a snot-nosed, uppity, primped penguin ass!
making this shit up! There Dean stood, back arched and face pressed to the window, contesting for Castiel's focus, as if anyone could ever challenge it.
Ma laughed kinda quiet and laid one soft hand on his knee.
As Castiel makes a daring escape, Mary was already sitting on the couch and he swears on his deceased wife (may her soul rest in peace) that she said, “Where's the quilt?”
thin ginger stood beside Castiel, leaning on the red barstool beside him. His eyes slid down her frame like molasses. A dress that hugs her thighs as if they’re water and it's a very hot day, pointy shoulders sticking out of her faded leather jacket.
Literally everyone! Even Garth, and Garth is really nice and would never get in big fights like Dean. Lisa doesn’t like Nick that much but she does think he's cute and that makes Dean’s stomach do bad flips. Nick sits at the bad table with Azazel and Alistair. They’re always in detention and getting in trouble.
Unbuttoning the marbled button that tied the dark of his slacks together, Castiel watched methodically as they slid down the length of his legs. He prided himself on the fact that, regardless of the strange looks he has received in waxing salons, his calves and thighs were soft with light dustings of dark hair. Royal blue boxer briefs clinging to the slight curve of his ass, he had to admit it. He looked good.
The redundant throb at the back of his skull certainly didn't lighten his argument. Hangovers aren't any more fun during the morning either. Why the hell did he let Zar convince him into drinking that much? Or sleeping with that..lunatic? She'd seemed decent at the time, he'd even chance the word "attractive". But god talk is
“Are you su-”
As Mary and John came out of their home, that weight settled right back on.
After staring her down for a long time, real quiet, her snickering cut off and she lifted two hands  like she was giving up. “Okay, okay.  I’m sorry, Dee. How about..to cheer you up..I let you off the hook for the rest of the day? No having to slave over an oven for you.”
But Dean really liked those pants. They were really cool.
A familiar set of vein lined hands set down a new pile of clothes where the old strange ones had sat. Quickly peeling off the shirt and pants he'd thoroughly been embarrassed in,
Step, step, step, Look left, look right. Clear.
Well, the short answer was: she didn’t. The more detailed, and frankly, true answer, is: Stupid, stuck-up, head up her ass, jagged toothed, devil incarnate, April Kelly
He watched curiously as two emerald green eyes staring at Castiel dunked away from the window.
He can’t go to the front door, that would make him too exposed and someone might find him. He snuck around the side and dragged his hand over the yellow panels, looking for secret entrances. Dean nudged a window up and it..opened! He knew he’d find an opening! Slamming the window open (quietly, quietly) he snuck into the house and closed the window behind him. Yes!!
Yes, she should definitely reward his efforts.
Thats fucking it-
He likes it.
Forcing two fingers into her damp vagina, his knuckles sank into the loose heat. Loose. Not tight, not Dean. Quick prep, fast. Her shrill moans aggravated Castiel’s libido, he wanted to hear something quieter, gentle. Messy and fast, her bodily juices running down the expanse of his wrist.
He turned his gaze to hers’ and caught her staring at Dean’s side profile. “Does this really bother you? Dean, don’t be such a child.”
Dashing upstairs and away from Mary, Dean ran to the restroom with six minutes to spare.
Nothing came, other than the occasional twitch of his neglected cock.
Clear minded, guilt began to sink into his bones. Fuck. That's John’s kid, John’s boy. What the hell had he done? Surely, surely, everyone would know at first glance what he's done. What he is resisting. Could they judge him? Have they been on the receiving hand of such mouthwatering teasing?
“Novak! I know you’re in there.”
He began talking himself out of attending, the store bought m&m brownies sitting cold on his dining table. I mean, who would notice he wasn't there? He wasn't formally invited by the party-throwers, Mary and John, so to simply disregard Dean's invitation would be a hitch. A tree falling with no one around, as they say. Well, no one other than Dean.
Sometimes, when he thinks about it, he ..he kinda wishes Lisa would have picked someone else. Not that he doesn’t think she's pretty or like her, he does, really! But a lot of his friends aren’t friends with him anymore because of the jerks that Lis hangs out with. That, and he's made a lot of enemies with people he doesn’t even know! Like friggin’ Nick!
Does anyone like wedgies either? Those hurt! Who would like something that hurts? Maybe someone does? He’ll ask Cas later.
Bella was an adorable girl. Wavy, soft brown hair hung over her forehead and laid shoulder length. Thin, peach-tinted lips and a slight nose. Appearance wise? A wonderful girl capable of taking the world by its trousers and ordering it around. Personality wise? April’s god damn twin.
And wasn’t that fucking awful?
He seemed really serious all of a sudden, his eyes somehow.. A darker blue? Kinda like..grey-ish blue now. Dean doesn’t know colors all that well, but Garth does. He should ask him what color it is.
without this so called 'Hotdog on a Stick' and whatever the fuck 'event clothes' was!
Castiel felt his blood freeze. He clenched the wheel underneath his palms and pulled out of the parking space a little too fast. Hopefully he didn’t notice a change in Castiel’s calm demeanor. He forced himself to suck in a shallow breath and began guiding down the semi familiar Lebanon streets.
Hopping the fence again, Dean got a grass stain on his baby blue jeans! Damn it! His pa’s car could be heard parking in their garage at the front, so he couldn’t wait around. Dean ran into his house and wiped the sweat from his brow.
“Yes. No. Mr. Winch- John, John is okay, yes? No? Okay. Look, I was heading to work. I just- I was heading-” His mouth was flapping a mile a minute, his lips numb and shaky. Anticipation of the mind bogging beating he was about to receive made Castiel nothing more than a mannequin. But even a mannequin wouldn’t wear these sneakers.
He knows how douchey that sounds.
Does he have little kids who come into his house and make him feel not loved anymore? Do superheroes have brothers and sisters? Is that weird? Would his brothers and sisters be weird too? Do they wear weird bee pants too?
i LOVE doing dean's pov because i agree with a lot of the stuff he says. Like.. i fucking love potato salad. thats my shit. and i cant stand fritos. shit like that.
Dean almost couldn’t breathe! Nickie-poo? Oh GOD! He doubled over in his chair and cackled loud, the entire class 3x louder than before. Lisa’s adorable snorts were muffled into Dean’s neck as she leaned into him. She always told Dean that a real woman wasn’t supposed to laugh out loud, and instead be ‘mysterious’ and ‘cunning’. He has to admit that that is what attracted him to her. Maybe she knows what she's talkin’ about?
He eyed the blue Converse sneakers thrown across his living room.
Before he could dive into just how ruthless god really was for forcing him into such a situation, small hands tugged at his index and middle fingers of his left hand. “Caaaas? Are you stuck in your head? Ma says it's okay for that to happen but y’ gotta stop day dreamin’!”
She died too young.
The down side about having good smell is that sometimes not all smells are good. His nose wrinkled at the thought of pa after taco Tuesday. He likes extra beans in his tacos and.. Ewwie. The bathroom is always so stinky! Cas wouldn’t like that. Dean doesn’t need telepathy to figure that one out.
It was her
Benny is from Louisiana (which is like forever away) and he always tells everyone and a lot of girls like him ‘cause of that. Even Lisa said that she liked his voice when he would talk a lot.
“So.. is fucking April Kelly fun?”
Dean was about to leave the house, now. He began shuffling around the room when he noticed that the same vines were growing outside of Castiel’s window too! He could just ‘pull a Charlie’. Hehe. He's funny.
Fuck it, he’ll figure it out tomorrow.
“Please please pleeease show me your powers please! Ma and pa aren’t gonna be here for like.. Uhhh.. I don’t know, but it's gonna be a long time! I don’t wanna be alone you can protect me! Be my new babysitter, pretty please with cherries on top? We can fight crime and watch power rangers together and watch gunner lawless beat up other wrestlers, and you think wrestling is real, right? It is! You’re cool like that, of course you’d think that!” He knew he was acting like a tiny baby, but he was so excited!
And with that terrifying realization, Castiel hurried away from the window to cowardly masturbate in the shower.
owe each other.” Zar rationalized.
The metal monstrosity croaked in disagreement.
you've no event clothing!?" gasped an appalled Balthazar, gawking at Castiel's choice of 'going out' apparel.
He never really had a crush on Lisa, is that weird? She kinda just walked up to him and told him he's her boyfriend.
“You heard that, kids? Let's hurry on up!”
of the damn mall, he would’ve ran away from the building!
That observant motherfucker.
“..No.”
Spinning his head around and glaring daggers at his friend’s back, Castiel suddenly decided that if he were to live after this day, if somehow he managed to escape the rising terror building up around him, he will murder Balthazar Milton.
Twirling and kicking the annoying straight pants off his ankles, he only had his shirt with all the buttons  and his favorite batman underwear on. He hated these shirts because they always took forever to take off! None of the babysitters even asked to help before, which was usually the sign that they weren’t good enough to watch him.
“I wouldn’t need much from you.”
Castiel leaned against a vibrating washing machine near their’s (not jumping, like his at home) and watched as Balthazar gambled his hard worked cash into a shitty vending machine. He could see the French man eagerly popping in the fifty dollar bill for various types of sugary sweets and carbonated beverages. He hadn’t taken him for the candy type.
“Of course, sweetie. Do you know him, John?” asked ma.
Castiel swallowed his self esteem and began to try on the somewhat 'quieter' clothing.
And, as anyone who has felt the everpressing stress of being the 'new' kid in any setting (even that of a cul de sac), Castiel felt a great weight substantially lifted from his shoulders. The familiar shade of navy on his bedroom walls seemed to cool the heated frustration of moving in. Of finding someone he's compatible with, someone who is attractive. Someone other than his deceased wife. Someone who is
The redhead from last night stood to his right. A bottle of water hanging from limp fingers and a devilish smirk riding up her cheekbones. Contrary to popular belief, seeing a familiar face in a new setting is definitely not as relieving as one would say. Especially when this was a neighborhood get together. Specifically, the cul de sac.
Kelly. Where had he heard that from.
Quickly, Castiel establishes a pattern, thrusting his angled hips feral. Deafening groans filter through the resounding ringing of slapping skin. Although Castiel would rather feel Dean’s vice-like grip, he’s grown accustomed to the wet folds of her vagina and is rapidly approaching his climax.
A fantasy. Pure fiction.
“Earth to Dee?”, concerned blue eyes tore apart Dean’s trance and he felt guilty for being stuck in his mind for a long time. He hugged his mom’s waist real tight and sighed.
A smoky gray henley shirt clung greedily to his biceps, making them look round and firm with a youthful swell. Falling short to just below his navel, a sneak peek of his happy trail could be seen unmercilessly teasing the viewer with '
He knows a thing or two about BDSM and he had a few enjoyments in college, but Daphne was a bit of a prude who couldn’t orgasm more than once a day.
“Is that? Your gla- Me? THATS! TH-THATS ME!  DEAN! DEAN GODDAMN WINCHESTER!” absolute fury warred against embarrassment on her face and she ran from the house, into the house to its’ left.
Right! Today they were gonna do a lot of fun stuff (but a lot of boring stuff before the fun stuff) and he had to be happy for all this stuff. He gave ma a big smile and gobbled down the rest of his syrup soggy pancakes, chasing it down with ice cold milk. He loved helping ma because she took him everywhere! The store, the bank (they give tiny lollipops to Dean!), and sometimes the ice cream shop if he's been really good. Benny's mom works at the ice cream shop and even though ma doesn't like the lafittes, she always gossips with her when they see each other. Dean likes seeing his ma happy like that. She deserves it!
Right now, in class, Charlie is the fastest reader. She says it's ‘cause she plays Crash Bandicoot and she's got really good reactions and stuff but video games don’t help you in school! Ma said so. And ma doesn’t lie all the time. But maybe she lied about that? Or maybe she kept it a secret so he wouldn’t play videogames all the time and get straight A’s?
Damn his normal balls to hell.
He has never really liked green foods (veggies and stuff) so he's always been a little weirded out about the whole adding pickles thing, but little did he know, pickles aren’t
Oh, how her sweet boy loved to run and jump around, especially at the worst moments possible.
Almost like sea blue but not sea blue. Kinda like the blue Dean doesn’t usually like because it's for girls, but.. For some reason he likes it a lot. Cas’ eyes are not only for girls. Dean likes them too.
Who the hell cares about washing machines?
A feminine voice rang from the Winchester home, most likely Mary. Dean's smile waned and an obvious pout tugged at his lips. So expressive. How would it feel for those cherry blossom lips to stretch around his wide girth? Would he choke? Gag?
“I’m helping you with your quilt situation-”
Ma ended up agreeing with pa, saying that anyone could take and use his phone if he’d dropped it. Even though he doesn’t take his phone anywhere! He found that really dumb!
He slid the box back under the bed and grinned wide. Yes!
Mary isn’t upset that she did not have a ‘gay’ son, she loved Dean just as he was, but it certainly did press her buttons that he most likely wouldn’t reach his full potential with the ever pressing weight of being the “masculine” son. She knew all too well how it felt to be forced into a mold by your stubborn parents.
He wanted to strip him of each and every article of clothing his darling owned and pin him down, watch as confusion and obvious arousal clouded his emerald vision. Stare and visually devour the sight of his pretty losing the beloved innocence he clung so tightly to.
Dean smoothly guided Lisa to a pair of chairs opposite Benny and Charlie. He helped her up to her blue seat and he sat in his own.
“Sneakers? Where are we? The third grade?” Accented snickering broke the tension growing heavy in the air.
The church smelled like old ladies and Home Depot dirt. Dean thought back to when he told pa that and he laughed so loud, reverend Jim made bad eyes at him. Ma got very mad with pa that day. They passed Bella and Garth and Charlie and Jo. Jo Harvelle was his new babysitter who really couldn’t take a hint.
They tasted like gym socks, okay! ‘N he knows that ‘cause of that time when Benny dared him to eat Charlie’s sock with the hole in it at the bottom of her dresser drawer. He remembers gagging and almost vomitin’ but not vomitin’ ‘cause he’s not dog water. Benny couldn’t believe he actually did it, but his name isn’t Dean
“I live here. Brick house. Next to the fag’s.”
A very messy Mary Winchester answered the door.
He’s hopped over this gate before, so it's easy this time. Holding onto the wooden planks, he swings himself over the top and lands on his feet, kinda like a kitty cat. The sun is high in the sky, but in our little neighborhood, nobody has their eyes peeled. Nobody is looking for people like Dean right now.
Small, teasing strawberry panties.
I APOLOGIZE SO MUCH FOR THE AWFUL TYPOS IN THIS. i barely finished my revising at 4 am. being my writer and beta is tiring, arghh!!
Dean began to undress in front of him and he damn near forgot to turn around. He craved it. Lusted over it. Needed to see the creamy white expanses of skin and fiddle with the sensitive privates of his pretty boy.
“Uhp..well..” small snickers traced her words, coating them in a sugary sweet tone and the smirk quirking her lips could be seen from miles away.
So far, the day was definitely going to be a blast! Elbow deep in potato guts and mayo, Dean squeezed and mixed them together, making a mushy paste. He didn’t always like potato salad, the relish and eggs always made him feel a little queasy inside but it was on his last birthday that he figured out how amazing it was! He ate it with an extra cheesy extra crispy bacon burger and it’d been like fate! His taste buds were dancing in happiness the whole time!
Just then, as if on cue, a small rustle in the bushes behind her earned a raised brow. A rat? Here, of all places? I thought Will Harvelle was an exterminator? She’d have to talk with Ellen about this immediately! She couldn’t have huge, disgusting, disease-infested rats roaming around when her lovely son was playing in the exact same greenery. What kind of mother would that make her? What kind of son would she raise? What of her unborn baby?
“Aw c’mon, Jo. I’m with Lis. Can’t you just wait a lil longer?” he held up their joined hands, as if proving his point.
A shockingly loud alarm blasted through the somewhat empty home office (He’d eventually gotten to the boxes) and caused Castiel to jump up, although he’d deny it until the day he died.
She could just ignore the dress and put on the white one. She could blow her husband’s mind and possibly end this night pleasantly. If you know what she means. But she knows what will happen. Vice president of the PTA came with certain..Kelly would call them ‘privileges’, but ‘consequences’ seemed closer to the head.
Standing at the front door, stood the guy! Without a shirt, his muscles looked really big and shiny in the sunlight. A huge smile stretched taut across Dean’s cheeks. He waved outside the window and watched as the old superhero guy dipped his head down and gave him a really secret smile. Like how mommy gives him sometimes, when she is proud of Dean for getting good grades ‘n stuff.
Instead of foreign music, they listened to some AC/DC and surprisingly, Zar knew his fair share of Highway to Hell. A proud smile stretched over Castiel's face. Zar would teach him clothes and Cas would teach him a thing or two about music. Finally, a friendship he had craved in Pontiac.
I knew you had a dirty little monster inside y-”
Pa wouldn’t like those pants. So, should Dean not like them? So what if they had different likes n’ stuff? Lisa said its sometimes not ok to have different likes, when Dean doesn’t like her hair and her skirt, like that. But sometimes it's ok like when Dean likes apples and Lisa likes apples. But is that the same thing?
As the weird u-shaped format (Lisa taught him that word) of the houses blurred in the distance, he sat normally in his seat and quickly noticed his ma was looking at him through the rearview mirror. “Made a friend, baby?”
“Dean, son, where’d you find that bracel-”
He snuck into the kitchen and looked in the fridge. Dean was kinda thirsty from all this sneaking around during the hot day (in sleeves, too!). A cold brush of air met his overheated cheeks and Dean smiled big. Aaah. That's better. There was a big bottle of Sprite and a few frozen burritos. Dean unscrewed the top of the Sprite and took a big gulp right from the bottle. Nobody was gonna talk smack about his manners sooo..
was in the Winchester house, but you looked like you wanted to do a number of naughty things to whoever was standing at the door.”
A crush!
“We know when evening is, doofus.” giggled Charlie, her red hair swaying from side to side.
Balthazar shoved the quilt into the washing machine and looked towards the back of the laundromat. “Give me your ten. I think.. I just solved our change dilemma.”  Zar yanked his wallet away and promptly stole a fifty instead of the twenty Castiel had been fingering.
Wow, that's a lot of words. Dean was a kinda fast reader, but sometimes he felt like Jess would lie to him and say he was faster so he felt better. He..likes when she does that. She gets that sometimes he doesn’t wanna use his super speed to read ‘cause it gets really annoying sometimes.
Anyhow, Castiel was more than ecstatic for the lack of John Winchester’s marbles.
Dean got a really bad tummy ache after eating it.
He genuinely wished he’d just stayed in his head.
to attend if it upsets you so much. Wipe that frown off your face, Cassie. That wrinkles with age.” Zar’s words were oddly comforting despite his choice of phrasing and overall tone. Something about it, though. Something said that he knew exactly what he was going through and he sympathized.
Maybe gettin’ rid of Jo was ..a bad idea?
He rushed up the dry wood stairs, deciding on ignoring his desires once more. He should begin seeing someone, anyone, to rid himself of the temptations Dean Winchester presents.
Dean doesn’t know all that much about cars but..is this even a car? It looked like shit on wheels. If this could run, he’d be surprised. It was a deep, cold gray and curved in all the wrong ways. Maybe it was ‘cause all he knew was the boxy angles of Baby. Where had ma and pa gone anyway? It's not that he didn’t ‘like’ Jo, (okay maybe it is that) but he wanted to spend more time with ma.
Tonight, he’ll work this tension out. He couldn’t be the cul de sac’s local fucking
That house is a monstrosity. Here that, kid? Monstrosity. A new vocab word." pa laughs loudly at his own joke, hand resting on the black flannel covering his belly. Ma glared at pa with an unimpressed look, a smile twitching at the tail of her apricot lips. Dean didn't see what was funny, but ma looked like she really loved pa at this moment. These moments don't come all that often but when they do, they feel so much more like a family. A family on one of those cereal commercials. Eating together at the table and talking and being ..
The sputtered hiccups of the old washing machine sitting beside the equally old dryer began beating roughly against the concrete ground, the empty basement making the echoed sound damn near intolerable. What the hell was Castiel thinking, not replacing these as soon as he’d stepped into the home? Clearly clinging to its former glory, the washing machine spurred and rocked with supernatural strength.
this monstrosity to her. And has she yet to wear it? No. Of course not! The mere sight of it makes Mary want to claw her own eyeballs out and, well, die.
or anything..
“‘S ma gon’ be ‘kay, Cas? She was..the fire.. And..” soft sniffles interrupted his query, tear tracks clearing a strip of peachy skin underneath the ash. He rubbed at his wet cheeks, dirt smudges lining his face once more. Castiel couldn’t help but feel his heart throb in empathy and care for his boy. He leaned close to Dean and wrapped him in a tight hug. A hug that showed understanding and semblance.
“Gods, you don’t
What was the chance that Mary would come to this laundromat? What was the chance that she’d walk into here at this
Seatbelt be damned, he jerkingly pulled out of the space and began speeding home. What would truly be detrimental to his grand plan involving his penis would be if a police officer were to pull him over.
As if Cas could read his mind (were they that close?), he nodded at Dean and waved his hand again, saying goodbye. His bottom lip slipped out and he pouted at Cas, shaking his head hard. Cas lingered at his window and stared at Dean, making him feel really small. It was like..like when the principal talks to Dean when he gets in trouble. Like a really bad thunderstorm is in his eyes. It makes him shiver a little ( not ‘cause he's scared or nothin’)
“You know you can’t sit here, Dean-o. Lisa will have a heart attack if she can’t sit with you.” whispers Charlie, trying not to disturb Jessica’s flow of thoughts as she writes at the board.
“I’m thankful.” John inclined his head towards Castiel, brown eyes gratuitous.
“Megara wants to know if you’d be..interested in a get-together we’re having.”
“Annnyhoo, Cassie, Darling, What are you wearing?” Zar’s eyes trailed down Castiel’s stiff figure, the epitome of uncomfortable.
Sitting up in his comfy bed (superman sheets!! yes!!), Dean sniffed the air. Ma is making pancakes and eggs! Another superpower he has is really, really good smell. He always can smell what ma makes for pa and him. Pa says that's not a real power but he can’t smell as good as Dean.
But he never really asked for help, so..
It's too much. Too overwhelming. Castiel stands up abruptly and throws caution to the fucking wind.
Anyway, he thinks his ma is the flash because she’s super fast in the kitchen. She always gets like this when they have a party. Especially the ones when the PTA people come. Dean doesn’t remember what that stands for, (he knows it's an ac..acroo...nem..nim?) and that means that it's basically a lot of words squeezed into a little bit of letters. Lisa told him about that.
Pa was real proud of him for getting a girlfriend on his first day of second grade.
“I’d always thought it’d be like fucking a opossum. Vicious but small. April sure must leave an impression in bed.”
He sat the glass pan next to the pie on the counter and closed the hot oven. His ma showed him how t’ turn it off but he thinks he forgot. He knows it's..uh, the uh.. Main dial .. in the middle. But was it left or right? If he turns it left, the numbers start going up, ‘n he knows that that is the temp of the oven so..no. So turn it right.
Is that..a bird? a plane?
pls ignore typos. im uploading this 3 am pdt  sooo *nervous sweating*
“It didn’t specify how much soap to put-”
She tried to explain how she was doing what she 'had to do' but that's simply cruel, isn't it?
Was there a laundromat near his house, though? Was there one near his office? How come he hadn’t already drawn a strangely well thought-out blue print of his neighborhood? All he really knew was where his occupation was, his home, and, well, that dive bar where he picked up April Kelly.
“Well..tonight is our anniversary.” A bashful Mary began to shuffle in place and smile wide. “He’s taking me out somewhere fancy, which is nothing like John. Usually he’d be begging me to settle for a burger joint.” Castiel could tell that she was madly in love with John Winchester, despite his very obvious flaws. Sometimes love works through all that.
“Uh..I couldn’t.. I haven’t.. I dunno if he’d even wanna talk to me!” Dean wasn’t usually shy, he made friends really fast, but he didn’t wanna ruin things with Cas if he said the wrong thing. What if Cas realizes that he doesn’t wanna be friends with a..a..kid?
With that, he succumbs to the lassitude dragging him completely underneath consciousness. But one thought plagues his mind as he relaxes.
“Sure. I’ll mention it.”
Before getting up, Dean decided to be a little sneaky..he wanted to see Cas just one time before he ventured downstairs to eat his yummy pancakes. Anyone would wanna see a real superhero all the time! Or supervillain. Lex Luthor is just as cool as Batman, ya know.
April fucking Kelly is an anomaly.
The full length mirror hooked onto her closet door presented her eerily yellow reflection. Blonde hair tied into an elaborate braided bun at the back of her head with thick strands of hair sprouting from the very base of it, she looked good. Laid back. Relaxed. Her shoulders incrementally lowered, a visual of the calm slowly swallowing her former panic. She felt as though she might just enjoy this night even with the threat of April’s presence.
“Heaven!” Zar wrapped his arms around his shoulders, rocking their bodies from side to side.
“Are you nuts!?”
Deeeep breath in, deep breath out. Like Lisa taught him.
“Mary has been spoiling him. The damn kid can’t shower or bathe without someone else in the room.” John rubbed the back of his neck, head quirked and glaring down at Castiel’s blue sneakers. “We’ve tried to knock him out of it, but he won't quit it.”
A smile that said all too much and yet nothing at all.
“Will there be an orgy?”
“Huh? Sorry. Actually, no. I’m not sorry. John Winchester was going to bite my head off because of our .. our..-”
Dean tapped the blue box app with the white ‘f’ on it and smiled real big. Charlie did text him! Lisa hasn’t texted him back yet and that made his tummy squeeze a little but sometimes she was really busy and had grown up things to do. Dean likes when she's grown up like that, a lot of people do.
To break an addiction, shouldn't the ill be as far away from the drug as possible?

“Castiel? If you wouldn’t mind watching my son for a few hours?”
Out of breath and terribly wrinkling her Sunday service dress, Mary took a temporary break from scouting out her little Dee. Who knew eight years old was the ‘running’ age?
It all happened so fast, he almost felt paralyzed with shock when it all came to a close.
—strangling Balthazar's neck like a wet noodle.
Even though the bad feeling didn’t totally leave his belly, he felt a little better and checked his phone for that notificate from Char. She said he could call her that and only him and that made him really really happy because not even Benny could call her that! At first he thought it was ‘cause she wanted to have babies with him like Lisa, and Lisa told him to push her during recess ‘cause of that, but its just ‘cause Dean is really rad.
“You got quarters?” Zar asked, hands busy with fiddling with the briefcase buckles.
Green for-
A growl. It had to be a growl. Nothing else could describe the purely animalistic sound that came from John Winchester’s mouth.
He knew this entire time. He had seen the redhead at the bar and had purposely, or conveniently, left out: oh! She lives RIGHT NEXT DOOR!
Nick was a real jerk sometimes. He told Dean that Lisa only liked him and Benny and Charlie were only friends with him because he was the only kid in class with a phone. He pushed Dean that one time when he brought his phone to class on the first day of second grade ‘cause..’cause..ma said it was ‘cause Nick was jealous, like pa.
Lisa didn’t see how much cooler Dean was than Nick (he had a phone and spiderman jammies!) but she would one day.
“Excuse me? Balthazar and..?” a strong, motherly voice rose from behind them. Balthazar’s eyes widened in joy and he sprung out of Castiel’s grip. “Linda! Oh, heavens above, how wonderful it is to see your face! Have you traveled far to save me from Cassie?”
The absolute mistrust he felt was so strong, he couldn’t believe it! Had he been hallucinating? Did his ma truly trick him into gobbling up leaves from Satan’s garden?
“You are the most stubborn cock block I have ever seen.”
Did he ever wipe her down?
“Good boy.” What? Good.. Good boy? His whole body got tingly and kind warm and his legs squeezed together a little. He’d never been called that. Just a bunch of weird names from ma and a nice nod from pa every once in a while but never.. Never
“You wouldn’t mind if we borrowed a little detergent, would you? Cassie forgot to bring any and the poor man is hopeless.”
“WOOH! WOOHOO! BYE-BYE, JOANNA! IT'S BEEN NICE!” wiggling his toes and swinging his hips, Dean was doing his happy dance! Everyone has a happy dance. It's just science.
Balthazar bristled and slicked his palm through his overly gelled spikes, playful tone lacing his words. “Oh, please! You aren’t exactly life of the party, mister accountant.” As Castiel strolled to the front door of the Winchester home, a rough guffaw sprouted from his throat. “I am very life-bringing. In all senses of the phrase.” he murmured, knocking on the door firmly.
to be a secret (even though ma doesn't like them) because sometimes it's not ok to break into a house. But it isn't breaking in if Cas can totally read Dean's mind and he
Her palm gyrated onto the sizely bulge tenting his work slacks. “Such a large male reproductive part you’ve got. I’ve heard the larger the penis, the greater the commitment to christianity.”
“Toni, Joanne, Patience, Gilda, and even Eve.” Mary admitted.
Snatching the keys from Castiel’s now loose hand, Balthazar rushed to the Continental and opened it, sliding into the driver's seat, eyebrows furrowed with determination. “I can drive us there, darling. Rest your eyes! Take a nap!”
“Did you talk to ‘Cas’, yet?” asked Charlie, as she spun around in his chair with wheels.
Stumbling clumsily into the ocean themed bathroom, Dean slammed the toilet seat down and sat on the cold porcelain of the seat. A shiver climbed up his spine, wringing his nerves dry. His small wee hung into the toilet bowl and he slowly let go of the tight vice he held around his bladder.
The cold leather of the car seat made him jerk to reality. This wasn’t fucking good. He was semi hard in his work pants, his cock standing at attention, begging to be forced into the dripping wet, savory warmth of Dean’s virgin hole. Of course, he was a virgin. He was a fucking child! A little boy, a little boy who practically kneeled down and seductively requested spending more time with Castiel.
Bad feelings swirled around in his tummy and made him feel like he had to vomit. Dean doesn’t like vomiting, it makes his throat hurt and it tastes nasty. Nasty like Bella Trenton. Nasty like Lisa’s sticky lips sometimes. Nasty like it raining outside all day.
..Castiel supposes the correct term is: cold feet.
He should really ask if Mary is alright.
Was it?
“Believe me, I.. definitely want to, but I shouldn’t. I’ve got normal human work to attend. I’ve got to blend in with all the civilians and just for the record,” he stepped closer to Dean.
Castiel frowned and tucked his twenty back into his wallet.
He thought that was kinda weird ‘cause when Dean potties (only ‘cause the strongest heroes always tinkle) he never burns down there. Maybe it's an old man thing. Maybe Cas knows what that's all about?
Before he could tell her that he’s an
Sometimes he really does like being alone, like when he has all his fun shit. As Dean stepped into the passenger seat of the car and Jo stepped into the driver’s, he went through what all of that fun stuff was. His Playstation, legos, toy army men, his swing set in the backyard, and sometimes, especially when nobody’s home, Dean likes to dress up.
Right.
“Let's get out of here. Got a house near here.” he glances around, trying to meet Zar’s eyes before he makes his unceremonious exit.
At first he tried to ask why the hell being well awake would help with his dilemma and zar’s cat-like face had burst in laughter.
that, okay?!” he sounded as if he were trying to convince both of them.
“My..wife’s quilt, she gave it to me when we’d first..met, and i accidentally..spilt semen, on it, and-” Castiel’s hands were spinning in the air, the gears in his head churning and turning with effort.
It is so crazy seeing all those comments and subscriptions! I wasn't expecting this story to get much attention at all (it is kinda on the risque side, if you haven't noticed) but I am efficiently flabbergasted! I love all of your comments and they motivate me to write like crazy.
He got the baby blue pants because they reminded Dean of Cas’ eyes n’ how much he really likes ‘em.
“You mean, how
The car slowed down in front of the big church that Dean really didn’t like. It was very.. Inn..inttimm..intimmidatiinn? Lisa would know the right word to use. He reluctantly stepped out of Baby and into the warm sun. Dean really loves summer (its the best time to swim, duh), but this suit makes him feel stuffy and closed up. He can’t wait for lunch time so he can get out of here and talk to his new cool friend.
A shocked squeal rang behind him as he pushed through the clear doors and drank in the all too intimate format of the room. Dark blue plastic chairs were sat in a circle and only some kids were here already. The god class teacher, Jessica, (she told us to call her Jessica and not ms. moore ‘cause it makes her feel kinda old) was writing something in chalk at the front board.
He wouldn’t even
Dean was just himself, and a lot of people didn’t like that.
As they both leaned into each other, creating a cocoon of heated mumbling, trading soft kisses and rough gropes, Castiel couldn't help but feel envious. The freedom to simply express how one feels is completely lost on him, what with his newfound (illegal) crush. And even with Daph, she'd been more of a "under the blankets" type of lover. Public affection had seemed crude to her. Now that he thinks about it, why had she limited Castiel to secretive kisses and mere hugs?
“Thats..good. Good, yeah. Dean is showering. He’s fine. Good night!” He was in a rush to escape. The faster he was out of this house, the better.
He hadn’t seen it at first because
Castiel Novak is a lot of things. He's smart, having graduated from The University of Chicago with honors in economics and finance. He’s successful, leaving Striegel Knobloch & Co. as the most financially fortunate CPA there. He’s ambitious, having initiated the conversation that led him to meeting his late wife, Daphne Allen. He’s loyal, spending a full five years with her before her sudden death. Castiel Novak is a wondrous man, truly.
“How come you know his name?”
Lisa thought his room looked like a little kid’s room but she doesn’t get just how cool superheroes are. A lot of girls are like that. Not Charlie though. Charlie’s favorite superhero is Captain Marvel. She said she's really pretty like Lisa is pretty but Dean doesn’t think so.
Anyway, thank you for reading this lil note and enjoy!
At approximately 9:37 PM, He’d met the majority of his coworkers, including Balthazar, which was an honest surprise.
Everything was good as gravy. ‘Til she let that lil’ tidbit flow. She hadn’t even known anyone was listening. But of course, the infamous Kelly was listening in, the damn vulture poking and prodding at her passing thoughts. Nobody is safe around her.
Picking out another dress, a dress littered with delicate sunflowers and peppered with sparkles and other fun things. To be point blank and brutally honest, it wasn’t the most attractive dress. In fact, it was drop dead ugly. Some things should
Fuck, what the hell is wrong with me?
“Because she hangs with commoners too. You know what I mean.” Charlie rolled her eyes and, sadly, Dean did know what she meant. Lisa hung out with a ..not ‘bad’ crowd, but a ‘mean’ crowd. She’s always been popular and real pretty which means that a lot of people follow her around. A lot of people in her crowd didn’t like that she chose Dean to be her boyfriend ‘cause he wasn’t as popular as her.
Maybe it was Zar’s awful joke. Or, maybe, he’d finally tipped over his breaking point and swan dived into insanity.
“Blonde?” asked Castiel, dumbfounded. Was this woman colorblind?
His face got super warm from embarrassment and he crossed his arms, upset at his ma. Thanks to her, there were smudges of mayo and relish all over his shirt and even some on his jeans! He really liked this shirt and she got it all dirty!
Lisa also thought wrestling was stupid. Lisa was always getting compliments for how ‘mature’ she was, whatever that meant. Shaking his head, ridding himself of his thoughts, he walked across the heavily watered lawn over to Baby. Baby, who glowed in the sun like a really shiny rock. Dean likes shiny things, like money and the wrestling champion belt Gunner Lawless wears. He likes it because Dean is a champion too.
“This little rascal was ‘bravely venturing’ in Castiel Novak’s bushes earlier.” commented ma, arms crossed in that way that made her look really mad, but the small smile on her face told Dean that it was secretly kinda funny.
God really was cruel.
It was the day after the barbecue fiasco and he’d tried his very best not to think of the irrevocable mistake he’d made last night. Surely, tugging one out to your neighbor (and reluctant acquaintance’s) son had to be wrong, right? He’s certain that a sizable spot in hell is burning specifically for Castiel’s soul.
“Blah, blah, blah.” Lisa whispered softly, against his neck. Glaring up at Jo’s amused expression, he stood up and walked away with her. “Y’know, Ima remember that.” mumbled Dean. “Oh yeah, pipsqueak? Whatcha gonna do, throw your batman panties at me?” sniggered Jo, smacking the back of his head as they walked to her small car.
to pleasure Castiel. A natural submissive, truly. A sultry groan reverberated through the Continental’s interior, rising from his throat.
So, why? Why did she buy it?
“I didn’t LICK-” a woman in a particularly short dress glanced their way, confusion and subtle disgust passed over her gaze.
Please tell me how you feel about this chapter in the comments and I strongly reiterate to the idiots who didn't hear the first time: if this ain't your cup of tea, stop drinking!
“If I’m truly that boring where you must retreat to the depths of your mind to escape conversation with me, then please, by all means, continue to do so. I’ll wait here.” a sarcastic lilt tainted the sorrowful words and Castiel felt the corner of his mouth twitch into an apologetic grin. Perhaps he isn’t alone in this. With Zar, his newfound, strange apple of a friend, surviving a few awkward conversations shouldn’t be impossible.
A soft smile graced her lips. “Just a small burn on my leg. I’ll be fine, sweetie. Stay here with ..uh.”
The kids were innocuously running around, playing tag, most likely what Dean was doing before ambushing Castiel. One kid with darker skin and glasses propped on his nose had accidentally kicked a wobbly wheel on the grill, keeping it stable. Bad news.
"Watch it, French model. I've got a few cards up my sleeve."
He hadn’t even thought of it. It should’ve been a clue at how fast he put the undergarment to his nose of just how far gone he was, but he didn’t think twice of it. The sweet, heavenly musk of Dean’s hairless pubic area clung to the panties. Castiel collapsed back onto the couch, knees weak while presented with this gift from the gods. Nose buried in the forbidden garment, he quickly undid the button holding his penis away in confinement.
I mean, all the dogs in the
hurt this morning, so he's not lying! It's the truth!
“He..He’s just..well, uhm.”
to be black, he doesn’t think so.
"Please Char? I feel like I'm withering away without some decent sugar! And are cookies even sugar? I'm pretty sure Jess said it counts as veggies or smthn'. Yeah, uh huh."
Eloquently, Dean stuck his tongue out at Bella and burped in her face.
His car wasn’t a hunk of junk.
that he's driving Cas crazy with his little mouth.
Maybe Cas thinks it's cool? Is his favorite superhero in Marvel or DC? He was kinda old, what if he didn’t know what marvel and DC was? Dean could show him with their big TV. Maybe he’d ask Cas to come over after the bbq to watch movies. He couldn’t stay the other day but maybe he doesn’t have to go to adult work today?
tight, too much. He needed larger breaths, more air.
“You let Eve into your home?”
Mary felt a burning rise of irritation manually pull the air from her lungs. John’s headstrong attitude certainly wasn’t one for the weak of heart, thought Mary.
She could wear a damn dress.
short. Tall vaulted ceilings hung over the Birch wooden floors, creating the illusion of a height that lasted for miles. The wallpaper was nothing more than a calm eggshell white color, and for that Castiel was grateful. Anything more and the housing design would be much too overwhelming for a simple accountant from Pontiac, Illinois. The main hallway was lined with calm burgundy carpeting and Castiel felt criminally wrong for stepping on it with his Dr.Martens (Yes, those.)
Also, I didn't put it in the tags because its kind of 'background' information, but there are a few Dean/Lisa moments. Of course, don't worry about it long term, because I'm all about endgame destiel.
Before he fully comprehended what sin he had committed, thick come spurted seemingly all over the steering wheel.
April Kelly.
John Winchester couldn’t kill him.
He grabbed his dark brown suitcase and walked out with Balthazar. Castiel rather enjoys the night. The crisp, dusk breeze desperately reminds him of Pontiac, where the air was always fresh. Smog free, if you will. Kansas was a much smaller state than Illinois, although what with nd in times like this, when the crickets could be heard from across the street and the   “Will you need a wingman? Perhaps we can participate in some group activities, mm? An orgy has never hurt anyone before”
“What died in his arse?”
“..Oh. Right. It looks okay.”
Dean glanced around, eyes squinted. He couldn’t let his ma find out about his secret clothes like this. He carefully closed the door shut like a ninja and locked it. Not all the kids in his class had locks on their doors, like Bella, but his ma and pa really trusted him to not like.. Do drugs or anything.
Could that have been..?
That would’ve made Dean upset when he’d first met Lisa because he hadn’t known all that much about her other than the fact that she liked his green eyes and humor. After a few months though, and after all the times she corrected him and scolded his ‘stupidity’, he slowly started to see the Lis Charlie had been warning him about.
Baby, bang it up inside
Gabriel, his older brother, convinced Castiel to ‘escape his bad memories’ at Illinois to join the ‘slutty depths’ of Kansas. Although, to Castiel’s amusement, Kansas seemed to consist only of churches and hidden BDSM clubs.
He’d be more upset if it weren’t already wrinkled to shit.
Castiel slid into the driver's leather seat and forced the key into the ignition. Turning the key with one good jerk and the engine sprouted to life. With Zar sitting in the passenger seat and flipping through multiple stations on the radio, Castiel dutifully accepted that this day was going to be one of his absolute worst.
Crap, Bella.
This chapter is chock-full of dialogue which is blegh, boring, i know, but i have to set the ground work for the porn, guys! Be patient with lil' ol' me XD
“No..I am and always have been Han Solo!” he grinned wide, bringing his knees away from his chest and sitting criss cross applesauce on his bed. Sure, Charlie could see his wee in the panties (they were pretty tight) but she only liked girls, right? So what difference would it make?
Superhero guy. Dean blinked slowly up at him. Man, he looked even bigger right here! Before, he was a few feet away and he’d looked as tall as a building, but now he looked like a giant!
While Dean spaced out, he didn’t pay attention to what was going on in the other house. Before he really knew what was going on, he saw those same blue eyes again! They were really,
That's the most he's come since.. Well, ever. Pulling the panties away from his face, Castiel quickly realizes that he fucked up.
Thudding down the stairs, Dean feels his phone buzz again. He'll answer after pancakes! He's sure that whoever texted him would totally get it if they knew he was about to totally pig out. Well, unless it's Lisa. Lisa said she should be his first..pri..priority. He shrugged and pushed that thought to the waaaay back of his head. Thinking about Lisa makes his tummy do the bad flips. Is that how it is for every boyfriend?
Nevermind.
He looks between both Charlie and Benny and frowns. This is one of a few things that he doesn’t like about dating Lisa. He’d never tell her that to her face, but she can really be kinda..pushy. What if Dean wants to hang with his best buds? Can’t he do that?
Oh, if only she knew.
Sometimes Zar really does make up for his stupidity.
Also, Is it obvious that I kinda..sorta.. really don't like Lisa? I pretty much despise her guts lmao
“Oh? And I’d go on to tell everyone, including the bartender, of how my best buddy, Castiel Novak, jerked off in his car and licked his own semen off the steering wheel.” Zar shrugged with a nonchalance that taunted Castiel’s very being.
“You’ve tried them all?” Linda asked.
“Cassie?! Cassie. I may be civilized, but I am not above spitting on those disastrous shoes.”
Her beloved Dee was downstairs and helping out with the transfer of food goods in the house and to the outside furniture. Her sweetheart was being so understanding about her strict dieting rules she set for him, and he truly deserved more than just her recognition on the matter. Perhaps.. For his birthday? No, that was much too far away. Christmas, then?
—" Zar imitated John's deep, metallic voice, "—stay the hell away from his home."
He nodded really fast and started towards his door. He really liked that he was right next to Cas’ window. And if Charlie wasn't lying, they could talk on Facebook too! Now they can talk all the time and show eachother everything! Hes gonna find his profile and add him right after he eats his yummy pancakes and eggs! With orange juice! Skipping out of his room (pa doesn't like when he skips but ma says its alright) Dean felt his phone buzz twice in his jeans pocket.
Mouth stained with red dye and debris tangled in his previously neat gel-spiked hair, the sight of her only child in such disarray nearly sent Mary into cardiac arrest.
When will things get less confusing?
Pulled out of his racing thoughts and forced back into bitter reality, he had to admit that he, stupidly, did not hear a thing John Winchester said. Is it too late to grovel for his life?
Lisa is his girlfriend in Sunday school and normal school. Grabbing the flower scented wipes instead of the tissue (he likes how it feels!), Dean carefully wiped his wee and its’ best buddies right next to it.
Seems like she’s used to be #1. I guess she’s more like Naomi than he’d initially thought.
He stretched up really tall and his back made a weird cracking noise. Is his back broken? He's still standing so..maybe not. He got down on the floor like he did last night and baaarely peeked outside of the window, the curtains hiding most of his face. Cas was ..fixing his bed? Did Mrs. Kelly leave already? She prolly went back to tell Mr. Trenton and Bela that she was playing at Cas’ last night. That makes sense! Like when Dean has a sleepover at Benny’s and has t’ tell his ma that he won’t be home for the night.
“Nuh.”
Sent!?
some italian sausage.
“Or..or he saw the stupid friend request and he’s gonna friggin’ think ‘m stalking him or something! I’m not!” Dean crosses his arms and scowls at Charlie, her pale features twisted into a wide smile. As much as he wanted to hate her for this, to really talk smack about what she did, he’s..kinda relieved. Dean knows he wouldn’t have done it, even though he really wanted to have text conversations with Cas.
Orange, he thinks.
His neck immediately began to warm and he needed to get Dean out of public view, right away. As much as Castiel wanted to wonder how the actual hell he’d broken into his house, nay, his
Before she could deliver the final (finishing?) blow, Bella sighed dramatically and waved her small, tanned hand in the air between both women. “Yes, yes. You look spectacular Mrs. Winchester. Now, if the traffic clears up, I could, possibly, join your barbecue.”
He’s aware of Zar’s hurried reassurements and apologies, but all he can see is the massive fucking dent in his hood.
"Those cheetah pants—"
Well, actually, Dean has never actually
Surprised by her bad language and by the threat (it sounds like it’ll hurt) he slowly peeled the blanket off of his body and held his knees close to his chest. “Don’t tell my ma. She’ll freak. She doesn’t even
pretty. Bella was ‘ok’ pretty, and Charlie was ‘good’ pretty, but Lisa took the cake. Wasn’t that the saying? Why couldn’t it be: ‘took the pie?’ Pie seems like something Dean would actually try to take, not cake.
“But she’s got my little boy wrapped around her finger. I can’t rip them apart like that. You should see them when they’ve got little playdates planned. It is the cutest thing, Lin. The cutest.” Mary began gushing unapologetically.
“Dee! Your breakfast is ready, sweetie! Come down!”
“Wait..” Dean’s dewey eyes widened and he looked up at Charlie’s dark green eyes, seeing nothing but kindness and understanding. The beginnings of a smile pulled at the ends of her eyes as she rested her chin on her knuckles.
“The way you stared at, well, I’m not sure
He forgot to charge his phone last night so it's kinda low but not too low. Dean can’t wait for the day that ma says its ok to take his phone somewhere! He's gonna have it full charged and play that hockey game with Benny. Benny can be a really bad loser sometimes and his weird accent gets all ..all..uh
Rolling his eyes, Castiel pinned Zar with a raised brow. “Hundreds of people have died from syphilis.”
Dean sat in between his best friends, Benny and Charlie. Benny has really blue eyes kinda like superhero guy but Benny’s eyes were kinda lighter. Charlie has really bright red hair and she's really skinny but that's why she always brings protein shakes and stuff to class. Carrying a really pink thermal cup in her left hand, Charlie is left handed, she turns her attention to him and almost smiles.
“Oh c’mon Clarence, the fact that YOU FUCKED AN OPOSSUM isn’t anything to be ashamed about.” Meg’s silken voice had raised four simple yet deadly words, and Castiel had never felt more doomed in his own life.
“Right here. Slow down. To the left.”
Dean didn’t see the murderous glare Mary was aiming directly at John.
He likes to think he had that with Daphne.
“Oh Shut up” Grabbing the (designer?) blouse by it’s sleeve, he yanked the French asshole into his house and safely locked the door behind the both of them. Zar was whining about something, he could see his lips flapping and his very animated complaining, but he couldn’t hear. The buzzing alarm from being near the object of his desire’s father after last night was nearly too much.
what would Daphne say?
As he neared the front door, he caught a glimpse of the empty baking dish Missouri had gifted him. Well, he was on the way, right? What's one more stop? Nodding to himself and briefly praising his quick and simple thinking, Castiel grabbed the dish and walked out of the house, keys in his pocket.
“Cassie!”
Dean didn’t like when Lisa wore lipgloss. It reminded him of his mom and he didn’t wanna kiss his mom on the lips like that. It made Lisa’s lips sticky and therefore made his lips really gross and sticky too. He doesn’t say this to her though. He just leans in again for another kiss.
“Balthazar? Castiel? What’re you two doing here?” Mary’s infectious smile almost made Castiel mirror one of his own, but the absolute horror of this situation had wiped any type of recognizable emotion off his face. He could feel the blood slowly draining out of his face. He must be white as a sheet.
Is it wrong to speak ill of the dead when they left you in a constant state of blue balls?
Oh, my love, how my heart aches to leave you now. To watch you squirm away in such displeasure, but with my every quivering breath, with all of the bone marrow that makes the 206 in my body, with the gas of each and every star in the god forsaken night sky, I guarantee that you will
“Adventurer??”
Castiel put his cock away unceremoniously as his post-orgasmic glow had been cut short and quickly replaced with post-orgasmic panic because fuck! That is obviously fucking semen on the Winchester’s fucking quilt.
“This isn’t for me, friend. This is a favor for someone else.
“Right, right. I’m not  getting any younger, Cassie. Lets go.” he began striding confidently towards the bar door, leaving Castiel behind.
Seconds after the sentence was uttered out of John Winchester’s hairy lips, Castiel’s imagination ran wild. Feral in the most ferocious way. Dean, slippery and wet, soap suds clinging to the soft slopes of his curves. Dean, surrounded by rubber ducks and action figures floating in the soap-clouded water. Dean, dripping with cold bath water, begging Castiel for a warm towel. Thin body kneeling at his feet, big green eyes watering with want. Desire. He needed a towel. He needed warmth.
parent.) but it hadn’t been whatever he wanted. It was ..well, the sole pain of her very existence hanging off a hanger in her hand.
He got a reeeally bad cold after eating it though. And that was when he had t’ go to the doctor to get a stomach pump or whatever it was called.  They took the nasty sock outta his tum’ and ever since then, whenever someone says something smells or tastes like socks, Dean can actually check if that's true!
Does that make him a bad friend to them?
And wasn't that a first?
"Make that a twenty foot pole. Lil' Cas-ti-el 's got the craaaazy eyes." taunted Rubes, grin wide. Pointy incisors glistened in the artificial light, transforming her smile into one of ridicule.
She smiled again and ran her delicate fingers through his hair, “Hey, how about I make your favorite pie? Apple?”
Soft knocking at her front door saved April The Devil Kelly from Mary’s sharp claws. God damn it. “You know the rest of the way, right? I’ll have to take that.”
Slipping off the annoying brown jacket from his suit, Dean unbuttoned his pants and began shimmying out of them, still dancing. Each time he gets rid of a babysitter, he can’t help but shake his butt a little! It's a tradition, what?
“Did you even have your license on you while you were driving it?” Castiel pondered.
Maybe.
Anyone would call him crazy for being able to relax after ejaculating on his neighbor’s property, his washing machine flooding his basement, John Winchester appearing on his doorstep, and Zar crashing his car into a fire hydrant, naturally, but all Castiel could do was focus on later.
Locking his Lincoln Continental and quickly catching up to Zar, Castiel was ready for the night of his life.
Castiel messily slid into his bungalow’s driveway, the usual stark yellow dimmed to a brownish mustard in the dark. The Kansas night breeze stood stale in his lungs as he rushed the woman to the front porch. Unlocking the door and roughly pulling her body in was almost too simple of a task.
No, Lisa had other friends and yet she still spends a ton of time with him. But Lisa is his
It was right then that he wanted to spout out his fictions of her son, of how he wanted to bend him over and fuck into his tight, rosebud of a hole. How he craved for the right moment to slide into the warm luxury that is, that must be her son’s insides. How he dreamed of nothing more than beholding the image of her little boy, Dean, suffocating on every single American inch that was his penis. His cock strained against his slacks.
Is his watch broken?
She was something else, alright.
Ma dug her sharp nails into his ribs, and Dean squealed (totally not like a girl) really loud. “S-Stoo..Stop!! Ttt..too much, please!!” snort infested giggles sprouted unwillingly out of his throat, a result of his ma’s persistent fingers. He stood at the very tippy top of his tippy toes and almost dropped the huge bowl of potato salad. It all happened in slow motion, one second he was squirming around tryin’ to get away, the next, his ma was grabbing the falling bowl of potato salad with a huge, guilty grin on her face.
Tauny hair tightly curled and laying limp around her gaunt face, secretive green eyes falsely lit with excitement stared at her through, what Mary expected was, fake eyelashes. April Kelly wasn’t a hideous woman. Quite the contrary. She had fair skin and a few wrinkles pulling at the crease of her eyes and trying oh so hard to hide behind bad concealer. Slight blemishes (that's being generous) could be found across her cheeks.
“Enn..Enough. Make love to me. No condom, as all mankind was made to do.” the redhead moaned loudly.
“You’re full of it, handmaiden!”
Scurrying off to the smaller building attached to this large Church and dodging older women that wanted to pinch his cheeks, he was making a get away. Like how Indiana Jones did when the big boulder was coming to crush him and kill him. All of the perfume smelling ladies were the monsters and god class, even if Dean didn’t like it that much, was freedom.
Castiel knew the perfect answer.
And if Castiel spent the majority of his sleepless night inside in fear of being struck by lightning, well, could you blame him? He isn’t exactly ecstatic to find out just what the hell kind of divine retribution ‘god’ has planned for him. Hopefully, God is empathetic towards his damned libido.
Ma is always doing something social and pa is always with his work buddies. Dean is always alone in their big, bad house. Maybe Benny and Charlie could come over sometimes after Monday?
No, no. Its ..me updating after a month! Fuck!
It was his work alarm that disturbed his partially wet dream. Castiel wouldn’t usually work on a Sunday, nor would he work a 2 pm- 10pm shift, but he couldn’t make demands on his first day there. Especially when he could choose what days to work in his house, and out at the new accounting office. He was a bit of a recluse on a good day, but an absolute hermit according to Gabriel.
An eager participant in the grinding motion of their hips, she licked up his jugular and murmured hotly, “Bed. Man and woman were meant to do it in comfort. It's natural.”
And all hell broke loose.
Nothing could really stop Castiel from bellowing out laughter.
Imagine all the time they could spend together! When Cas comes over to hang with pa, Dean could steal him and show him all his action figures and they could dress up together and maybe he’d like to play on the swings outside?
“Of course. I hope you’ll be okay, Mary.”
Pa said he needed a password because ‘every man keeps a lock on his phone, son! Haha.” but he didn’t want one because ma looked at pa weird after he said that. The kind of weird where she was very upset but didn’t want Dean to see it.
It hurt a lot, kinda like when Charlie’s dog bit him when they first met. She had a ugly little chihuahua dog, which was okay, he guessed. He doesn’t really like those dogs because they act like little jerks who know everything about everything! But how could a stupid dog know about Dean!
“My name is Castiel, but you may call me Cas.”
“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Any friend of Mary’s, is a friend of mine.” Linda smiled and pulled him into a one-armed hug.
“What the hell are you doing here?” had slipped out unwarranted, and by the pissed raised eyebrow she’d given in response, it was unwelcome too.
Lets earn that explicit rating, huh? (if we havent alrdy lol)
A small hand reached into his hair and carefully pulled out a small twig. “You look so.. Messy, baby.”
Lovely Mary! Mary who invited us to her BBQ and caught fire.”
The bad feelings swirled in his tummy again like it happened yesterday. Why does Lisa look at other boys? All the time, too! She's always got something to say about Garth’s teeth or Nick’s ‘cool clothes’ or Benny’s dumb voice or Kevin’s glasses. But never Dean. She never talks about Dean. Maybe its..its ‘cause Dean isn’t that cool? Maybe that's why she talks about other boys from class?
No such luck.
“Novak.”
With the rusted lid pried open, Castiel buried a sizable amount of come-covered clothing and one ‘innocent’ quilt inside. Unfamiliar with the basic mechanics of washing..anything, really, he dumped a few scoops of strong scented detergent into the water. He slammed the lid and eyed the knobs pointed to certain settings. Delicate. Delicate? No, he knew what this meant. He’d looked it up. Right. Furrowed brow and all, Castiel confidently set his load to delicate, knowing that with soap and water, it’ll get clean either way. The settings don’t matter. It’s all just minor shit.
The door was unlocked, and similarly to this morning, the door knob sat heavy in his palm. Clammy hands dirtied with dried suds and sweat, Castiel turned the knob and headed into his sudden doom.
like the Winchester's.
He’d call Balthazar childish if he weren’t eyeing the skittles in the machine.
And.. ahaha.. I'd just like to warn you that, as an eight year old hell raiser, I never had a phone. I don't know how eight year olds talk or text!! I'm sorry if my use of emojis is..disturbing. (Some would say borderline traumatizing)
for a famous french brand, Mon ami." A forced smile spread over his wary face, eyes pleading in a way he's never seen before. Zar didn't seem like a begging man which made this situation all the more captivating.
Secrets aren’t good, ma would say. But how is that fair! Dean clenched his phone hard and felt his eyes get a little tingly. No, no. No crying. Lisa would call him a baby if she was here right now. A lot more so ‘cause he’d be crying
—" Castiel began, prepared to defend his fashion choices until his very last breath.
“But if he knows I’m getting a gift from his house already aaand he hasn’t stopped me, does that mean he doesn’t mind?”
Families walking in and out of the mall ignored his standing there, as they were here for their own enjoyment, not to bother some guy in 'event clothes'. Relaxation appeared in Castiel's slumped shoulders and dipped chin. The Kansas Summer sun beat down on his skin, unforgiving. He was no stranger to sunburns but that was in
A..A what?
No. If she were to shut the hell up. Something Castiel should do too.
“Linda Tran, a dear friend of mine. Well, she doesn’t like to admit it, like John, in a way, but I’ve got a special discount off!” Zar’s chest puffed with obvious pride that made Castiel’s sides tickle with hilarity. Is he ..proud of ..a discount?
"We work at the
Shucking hid boxers underneath his ass, he pulled his engorged cock out and began stroking, shamelessly. Let anyone and everyone see. The strawberry, lacey panties sat unperturbed over Castiel’s nostrils, the wet spot from Dean’s sweat and bodily juices making this jerk off session damn near god-like. He began to lap at the wet spot, his tongue desperately begging for more of his doe’s juices. More. He
I just wanted to warn yall that John uses the F slur in the beginning of the chapter, and their is a graphic sex scene between Cas and someone else who isn't Dean. (Not gonna tell who (; )
That must be a sign, then?
Castiel completely understands.
Dean eagerly pressed to the window, his freckled nose upturned onto the tinted pane of glass. A jaw breaking smile stretched across his youthful face. Cas wanted him to be his sidekick, that had to be it. He’d always wanted to be someone’s real sidekick but he’d never met anyone like him. And after meeting Cas? Nobody would measure up! Even Benny and Charlie would be ‘meh’ compared to his former supernatural best friend.
He is a deity, a thing of beauty and hatred. One to be coveted and adored but not stared at, no one should actively practice such blasphemy. He’d never been a religious man but Castiel would worship Dean with each and every breath of air his lungs could provide.
“Are you crazy? He’s a
” Zar’s unmistakable voice, clearly holding back laughter with a loose grip.
But little did he know, Dean stayed up a little later when he put his tooth under the pillow ‘cause he wanted to actually see who the Tooth Fairy was and if he could convince ‘em to give him a little more than five bucks (he’s kinda broke). What Dean really saw was his pa’s mega hairy hand digging under his pillow to give him a..get this, three bucks and two quarters!  Not even five bucks!
Content with leaving Ruby's mind to wander aimlessly, he grabbed the bag of successful outfits and dragged it to the checkout counter. A bored teenager with bright orange hair stood slumped, scrolling through her phone. A hesitant clearing of Castiel's throat made her almost empty brown eyes gaze up at him. "Yes?"
His mom smiled with all her teeth and started putting the dishes away in the tall cabinet, the one next to the cabinet where ma keeps her rice cake thingies. As he carefully helps her put the dishes away, he thought about how rice cakes aren’t even real cakes. He tried one once ‘cause, who doesn’t like cake? And he never tried a
“We can’t
“Right..goodnight.” John nodded once and turned away from him.
Whatever. He tuned out her religious ramblings and slipped on a custom condom he'd made because his penis size is, unfortunately, not sold in retail. Her pissed off musings at the sight of the condom were cut off as he thrusted inside of her.
