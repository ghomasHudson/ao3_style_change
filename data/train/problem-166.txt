John cannot bond with his son. He cannot watch someone else take Sherlock’s place: he cannot watch someone grow to replace the person he loved most in the world. He
‘How did I get here?’ Henry was examining his fingernails, and John realised numbly that he was still wearing his dog tags: he looks
John’s eyebrows shot up. Mike rolled his eyes.
Nathaniel continues to talk and nobody seems to notice that John is crying. Nobody, that is, except Rebecca, who blinks up at him and takes his thumb.
‘Ne soyez pas impoli , Sherlock , le garçon est clairement d' une intelligence supérieure à la moyenne. Regardez sa coupe de cheveux!’ - Do not be rude, Sherlock, the boy is clearly of above-average intelligence. Look at his haircut!
Sherlock had no intention of answering to Irene.
Sherlock had straightened up, run a hand through his thick head of hair, and replied, ‘I am Prince William Sherlock Scott. But you may call me Sherlock.’
Sherlock, who’d forgotten what he’d said, repeated, ‘You’d say so?’
‘Stop.’
Sherlock was faffing around with Mycroft’s desk, so John had positioned himself by the window, staring onto the street below. The parade had been snaking past for a while, and John was remembering what it had been like when he was ten: the smell of smoke and food, the sound of laughter, the colours blending together in a perfect cacophony of the senses. He’d never forgotten it, and he knew he never would.
John looked back up at Sherlock and he was crying.
Mycroft never said anything but he had definitely warmed up towards John since Sherlock had started treating him so much better, and Sherlock appreciated that hugely. He would never admit it, but the thought of his favourite brother and the boy that he loved more than anybody disliking each other was heartbreaking.
‘Car’ - because
it when Mycroft looked at him like he was looking at him right now: as if Sherlock was a stupid, accident-prone baby who couldn't understand the world around him and had to be covered in bubble-wrap to prevent certain death.
There were a hell of a lot of other people in the room, in fact.
Sherlock tried to look modest (it was hard, because Mike was right: it
‘That was why Jim kept showing me pictures of brains and saying how cool they looked! And why Irene came up to me the night after Prom crying because she’d lost fifty quid! How did I not know this?’
And then John caught Sherlock’s eye, and saw all the pain and misery and disbelief that he had felt as he watched Jim and the younger boy kissing just ten minutes earlier.
The guard, who Sherlock now recognised as Mike Stamford, sighed. ‘Which competition?’
Sherlock crowed as he finally untied the kayak and shoved it into the lake. It was for two people and John hopped in the back before he could change his mind: Sherlock tossed him a paddle and then leapt into the front seat. ‘Keep quiet,’ Sherlock warned, and took a paddle. ‘Now. Follow my lead.’
But at the same time, it’s exactly the right moment, because everyone needs some to tell them it’s okay, that they’re not broken, and for Sherlock Holmes that has always been John Watson-
Instead of arguing with his mother, he nodded and said, ‘I always thought Prince Edward seemed more regal.’
John, who had gelled his hair back so Sherlock could see the browner roots. John, who was wearing a black suit and a dark green bow-tie which brought out the little green flecks that Sherlock knew were hidden in his eyes. John, who laid eyes on Sherlock and smiled as if he’d seen the end of the world, and it had been beautiful.
Sherlock frowned. ‘It gets a bit personal.’
Sherlock shrugged as nonchalantly as possible, even as his brain exploded into a billion tiny stars. ‘Suppose.’
‘What are you doing?’ John shouted at her. ‘He’s injured-‘
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘But I don’t want too, Irene. That’s Mycroft’s job.’
John stood, body almost vibrating with need and the alcohol. ‘Um- yes.’
He truly didn’t.
Harry and he had played there as children, with their action figures or cars, and later on the Wii or PlayStation. His sister was slumped on the beanbags, a hip flask in her hand. John decided not to say anything and sank down on the beanbag next to her, noticing that the TV was on and showing the speeech. The balcony doors were opening.
‘He couldn't even hold the knife properly, I disabled him in a matter of seconds.’
Sherlock leaned back in his chair and smiled at the ceiling. ‘I love John Watson,’ he whispered, and he couldn't actually believe that John, his John, had actually just
Molly ran into the room, carrying the hose, and Sherlock almost started crying. ‘THIS IS ALSO NOT THE TIME TO WATER THE COUNTLESS DYING PLANTS SCATTERED AROUND YOUR HOME-‘
‘I’ll call you back,’ John said quickly, and hung up before approaching the shop.
pretentious-‘
Rosie threw her head back in apparent disdain.
‘Jesus.’ John shook his head. He hadn’t been old enough to remember but his parents and Harry had told him all about it. ‘And Sherlock?’
And that was pretty much it for eight hours. Four o’clock became five, and six, and seven, and so on until John was pretty sure if a baby didn’t arrive shortly he’d have to collapse in the chair Ella had been in when they arrived. Now, however, she was up and looking alert, standing next to Lila, who was finally (
‘I’m tomorrow. Six till ten.’ He’d forgotten about the rota, until John said that, but now he remembers.
John was fuming.
Sherlock smiled sheepishly at Molly, who was once again wearing her I’m-going-to-kill-you look. ‘I’m sorry for shouting,’ he said, ‘but I was concerned for our lives.’
out of me.’
‘Wait for it,’ John reassured him, before turning around and showing him his back. ‘Ta da!’
Sherlock shakes his head, smiling. ‘Such a future is not possible. The science behind it-‘
‘Go on,’ John said, interested. ‘Do it.’
‘I-but-ugh.’ John sighed, though his eyes were twinkling, and he leant down and kissed the top of Sherlock’s head, smiling at him. John was thirty-six years old but Sherlock thought he looked exactly like the teenage boy Sherlock had met in the coffee shop, the first person to speak to him like he was a human being since his mother died.
had them convinced, but then he accidentally set fire to the kitchen trying to cook fish fingers and that was that. He was going.
‘You’re an idiot.’ He said to himself. It was too quiet so he screamed it, repeating the same four words over and over, shouting to the sky, ‘you’re an idiot!’
‘It’s simple. Charlotte Collins, this victim here, has been poisoned over a long period of time with the drug Daradocien, which slowly causes all the cells in the body to mutate. There are no physical symptoms and the mutations lie dormant until they are triggered by a rapid temperature change. This woman has recently been in a tanning bed, which we can see from the lines around her cuffs,’ Sherlock traced said lines, ‘and this clearly caused the mutations to activate. She would have died in moments as her heart failed. She got in the tanning bed voluntarily but that man, Scott Beadle-‘ Sherlock nodded at the other body, ‘was the one who took her out. Do a DNA test to make sure but he had splashes of fake tan on his sleeves but was not tanned on his skin. I would say that a gang planned this murder and killed the man they used to do their dirty work so it would be harder to track him. Guessing by the method of murder I would say it was the Red Barrons, a gang that operates in Western London and owns a chain of tanning salons. Their leader, one Aaron Mckenna is a known philanderer and I would hazard a guess that Charlotte here was impregnated by him and then murdered when he was told. If not, she owed him money and he got tired of waiting. I’m almost sure it’s the first one, though, her handbag does not contain any menstrual products which is highly unusual for a woman of her age.’ Sherlock stood up, smiled at the shocked Lestrade, and turned on his heel. ‘It’s a lot less fun doing this when John’s not here,’ he mused as he wandered towards the end of the street.
court.’
That was true. Both of them knew that. Unfortunately, they had a problem, and the problem was that as much as he wished it to be untrue, as much as he denied it, he was still entirely and irrevocably in love with John Watson.
John said silently to the universe.
‘Stay there!’ Jim shouted, dark eyes flashing. ‘Stay right there!’ The hand on Sherlock’s back twitched slightly and John halted, eyes fixed on Sherlock.
John suddenly looked all shiny, his mouth stretched in a weird way. It took Sherlock a moment to realise this was happiness, and Sherlock felt a jolt in his stomach as he realised that he was responsible for this look on John’s face, he had made him happy, he was the one that made John look like that, him and only him.
Sherlock sat still and watched them, his children, who were happy and healthy and would never, ever have to go through what he had, and he rested his head on John’s knees and mumbled, ‘John?’
you for anything. Now, back to the matter at hand, Sherlock, which is how you shall ask John Watson to your prom.’
John pulls the trigger, and everything goes black.
‘Hail thee!’ The crowd shouted. Sherlock wondered if they had been struck by a sudden feeling of Olde English or whether they had been instructed to say that. It hardly mattered, he supposed, but it would be interesting to know.
John was fuming.
‘Really?’ Sherlock glanced at John. ‘John, what’s the Berlin Circle?’
‘Cheap wine is the strongest,’ Mike said knowledgeably. Janine laughed, punching his arm harder than she intended judging from the look of pain on Mike’s face. ‘Ah, Mikey. We’d know nothing about France if it weren't for you.’
John gasped. ‘You mean…’
Mycroft sat down on John’s other side, closely followed by another boy with light brown hair and laughing brown eyes wearing tennis kit. ‘I wanted to check you weren't traumatising our newest recruit,’ he replied snidely. ‘Is he behaving, John?’
‘Sorry,’ John whispered, now hovering by the door and staring in horror at Sherlock’s rapidly retreating figure as it cut towards the waiting room, a million thoughts pushing for dominance at the front of his brain.
They sat in silence, staring over the duck pond, hands interlinked, and John decided to ignore whatever he was getting mixed up with, and just go with the flow.
John laughed, shaking his head. ‘Always liked kids. Twins are a handful, though. Why don’t you get a nanny?’
‘And that’s what John did. That is, found the real me. He saw past me, he found me, and he brought me out, into the real world, and kept- keeps, rather, he keeps me here, with him. And I love him for that.’ He turned to John, making eye contact. ‘I love him for his kindness, his intelligence, his general brilliance, his above-average deductive skills-‘ there was a smattering of laughter- ‘but, above all, I love him because he made me see the good in myself. And I’m sure many of you know how hard that must have been for him. John, we’ve accomplished so much together, and I cannot wait to accomplish everything else with you as we spend the rest of our lives together. When I’m with you, I am not only great, I am good.’
‘What is it?’ Sherlock wondered. John couldn’t believe that this man, standing calmly in hospital scrubs, his child’s arrival in the very near future, was the same man who’d freaked out when he’d gotten a text saying they should come to the hospital. ‘Sherlock-‘
‘I didn't know you had feelings for me until you kissed me, Sherlock,’ John replied. ‘Even when you said you’d come with me as my date, I thought it was just a joke. I’d always thought you’d had a thing for Jim-‘
Sherlock pursued his lips. Ezra’s ‘problems’ in that time had been kept secret from everyone except Sherlock in that time, and he knew he couldn't betray his brother’s confidence like that, so he just nodded. ‘Yes, though not as bad.’
‘I wish I had a home,’ Sherlock muttered, still staring out of the window. John should be his home, but clearly John hated him. It didn’t work if it was only one way; they had to love each other equally.
Victor groaned. ‘Jimmy?’
‘And then,’ John said, voice shaking as he stared at the trousers, ‘You lied about it. You said you were on a case, you visited every single person who could possibly know. You got rid of the evidence, but
‘Shut up,’ Sherlock growled. ‘God, you play hard to get, don’t you, John Watson?’
‘Just jump, Sherlock.’ Jim whispered. ‘Just jump, save John.’
) long time. ‘Everyone has stories,
‘How did you ask Sebby?’ Sherlock asked, trying to change the subject. Jim laughed. ‘Ask Sebby?’ He snorted. ‘I didn't ask him so much as say ‘I’m wearing black to prom. Wear something that matches but doesn't look boring’.’
An A.T emerged from behind the oldest teenagers and said cheerfully, ‘Bonjour! Bienvenue aux adolescents Club! Comment t’appelle vous?’
Sherlock paused and looked down at John. His eyes were conflicted, John could see, even through the lust still visible. ‘No,’ he said carefully. ‘I’ve never been in a relationship before.’
’ The waiter spelt it out slowly, head tilted to the side. ‘Alcoholic beverage. Often made in France. This one probably is, the groom is a
‘I was born in the year 1499, in the time of Henry VII. My mother was a mathematician, one of the finest in England, and my father was a painter.’ Sherlock reaches into his bedside table, withdrawing the photo album he made when he’d had slow decade in the previous century, and flicked to the first picture: the painting his father had done of him and his brothers, circa 1508. ‘This holds my life in pictures,’ he said, offering it to John, who took it soundlessly.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at John, his eyes apologetic.
‘She was a brilliant ruler,’ John acknowledged. ‘Apparently. I mean, I wasn't around, but my grandparents loved her.’
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘Oh, shut up.’ And then, as nonchalantly as he could, ‘How’s John?’
He turns so he’s facing Sherlock, cold blue eyes meeting incredible blue/green.
‘Oh,’ John said, trying not to sound disappointed (
‘John. John Ke- Watson.’ After their Dad had left, Harry had been adamant that they change their last names to their mother’s. John had been reluctant (he still hoped, wished,

and it had come in the mail box.
‘Shut up, John, I’ll come with you. Pick me up at five, I’ll see you then.’
‘Hi, love,’ he starts quietly. ‘It’s been a while. I know I should come more often but…it seems right, coming on the anniversary, and every other time I try and step in here I just feel like it isn't the right thing to be doing.’ He pauses and looks at his children: Nathaniel is trying to tie the scarf around his sister’s neck. He smiles, and turns back to the grave, kneeling down in front of it, right on the grave in which Sherlock will lie forever. ‘Nathaniel has grown so much. He looks more like you every day, and he’s even begun deducing. I think it was Mycroft that taught him that- I told you your brother adored you, didn't I? Lizzie’s met someone, I think. She’s always on the phone, or texting, and she seems happier than she’s been in a long time. Do you remember when she brought that Philip boy home? You were so funny.’ He remembers the incident as clearly as if it had happened yesterday (
‘Goodbye, James Moriarty,’ Sherlock whispers. With a kick of his flanks, Hadrian is running, and Sherlock is free.
‘You like spending large amounts of time with me, and would not be adverse to cohabiting with me?’
Sherlock, who was lying on the floor with his son balanced on top of his stomach, nodded approvingly. ‘I have never seen a cranium sparkle so substantially, Octavia. You have once again exceeded expectations.’
‘I’ve already fallen in love,’ Sherlock said to his empty room. ‘There is no need to promise anything.’
A murmur went up around the crowd; most of them had expected Sherlock to take his father’s name, which was stupid, because Sherlock had never been one for tradition and
Janine laughed and even Molly sniggered a bit. The boy next to Mycroft tilted his head and said querulously, ‘Que dit-il?’
‘Adrian?’ Morag continued as if he hadn’t spoken. A sneaky look came onto her face as she leant forwards and whispered, ‘Victor? James? John-‘
‘Yes, John, you know that. I consider you my very best friend.’
John had thought about Sherlock constantly before it had happened anyway. Sherlock distracted him from his studies; Sherlock distracted him from his friends. Sherlock kept him awake at night as John lay there in the darkness and wondered if he made the right decision, breaking up with him.
Silence. Not a good silence.

He’s been able to go into hiding, wearing contact lenses that turn his violet eyes a strange blue-green mix, growing out his hair, avoiding anything and anyone that might give him away. The 21
John sighed before nodding. ‘But actually tidy, Vi. Don’t just sit on your laptop and play World of Warcraft.’
Sherlock’s mind was malfunctioning. His hands were out to the sides, legs far apart, eyes wide open and cheeks flushed as he tried to make sense of the situation. ‘John-‘ he gasped, as John continued to nip at his bottom lip, ‘I don’t- you- you’re getting
John focused on the screen. The official announcer was reading out their names; John heard Olivia, a blonde woman with William’s smile, Paul, a man in his early thirties with messy black hair; Daniel and Lucas, identical twins with the same blue/green eyes as Sherlock; Isla, who couldn’t have been more than twenty-five and who had William’s sharp cheekbones, Annabelle, who was possibly only two or three years older than John, and Dean who, with his curly hair (albeit a lighter brown than Sherlock’s inky black), slender frame and wicked smile could have been Sherlock’s twin.
His mother finished her story and he pretended he’d been listening. ‘Ah. Yeah.’
Sherlock couldn't believe he’d done it. He couldn't believe him and John had just had
‘You have no idea what’s going on!’ Sherlock laughed. ‘You’ve just been laughing at what I’m saying for the last forty minutes.’
John frowned. ‘Sorry?’
‘Four months, eighteen days, two hours.’ Sherlock interrupted. John threw him an exasperated look, though inside he was freaking out (
Sherlock just stared at him incredulously. ‘Of course I choose him. Are you mad? He’s good for me, James, whilst all you do is betray me and make me hurt people.’
‘It was- was just so sudden.’ She wailed for what must have been the twentieth time. Henry patted her arm gently, pulling her towards him. ‘I know, love.’ He said. ‘We’re all sad.’
How could he do that? What would Harry say? Would he never see him again?

, as you well know.’
Sherlock realised he had been quiet for far too long and quickly answered, trying to avoid Molly’s burning gaze, ‘seventeen girls and three boys.’
'How could I not be here?' Sherlock murmured hoarsely, and John almost laughed, because he couldn't believe it, that he was back with Sherlock after such a long time apart. 'I can't believe it-'
‘It wasn’t a relationship.’ Sherlock said bitterly, glaring at James. ‘It was more—‘
Mycroft glared at Sherlock as if he knew exactly what was running through his younger brother’s mind and muttered, 'I know I said that I would drop this, Sherlock, but the necessity to discuss your little girlfriend is growing. Can we
At this point, John snapped. ‘Just because you’ve acted in what is most likely a piss-poor film with some wannabee A-lister doesn’t make you better than me. I’m not going to treat you like royalty, mate, whatever you’ve been in.’
‘William Sherlock?’ Hamish laughed. ‘So…why do you go by Sherlock?’
He called Lestrade, the young sergeant in the police who acted as his contact, and sulkily told him not to get another consultant before hanging up. He wasn’t in the mood for small talk.
Sholto stomped in at about half seven, as they sat around gossiping and cleaning their equipment. ‘Listen up, maggots,’ he shouted. ‘We’re splitting up today. Hunter, Spencer, Whitney, Scarborough, Watson; you’re checking a village that was ransacked by the enemy. There’s been no activity for twenty-four hours but we want you to go and look for any survivors. Spencer, Watson, take your medical kits.’ Technically, John wasn’t a proper soldier; he was an army doctor, and his main job was to save the lives of those who were wounded. So far, sixty-six people had been brought to John; twenty had had life-threatening injuries. John had saved eighteen of those, and the two he hadn’t still haunted him, and probably would haunt him for the rest of his life. Grace Lukeman had been twenty-eight; her daughter, Lily, had been eighteen months and her husband had contacted John afterwards to say

He closed his eyes, and hung up.
The thing that scared John the most, though, wasn’t that he had killed someone. It was that he didn’t care. A real, living, breathing human was dead because of him and he felt nothing, because the woman had been trying to kill Sherlock and that was not alright.
‘I’m going out,’ James whispers. ‘And when I return, I will make last night up to you.’ Sherlock finally turns around, staring into those violet eyes, the symbol of the

John stared at him in amazement (clearly at how clever he was). ‘Are you…we don't even have a King!’

‘Sherlock.’
Sherlock stared at Mycroft in horror. ‘Have you been spying again?’ He shouted. ‘I’m telling Mummy. MUMMY!’
‘Good,’ Hamish mumbled, returning to kissing his lips and his neck and his jawline, sucking against a spot that Sherlock had never even realised was there before now. ‘Sherlock-‘
Everyone was silent, staring at Harry and John, and John wanted the ground to swallow him up.
John was now just staring at him. Sherlock continued, all that anger he had been holding inside him about his sexuality and the hatred towards LGBT John seemed to possess flowing out. ‘You’re my best friend, John, and I love you, but seriously. I am taking no more shit about who I am. Yes, I’m gay. No, it’s not a phase. If that makes you feel sick, if that makes you want to stop being my friend, then get the fuck out-‘
‘Solved it in about ten minutes,’ Sherlock bragged. ‘It was the owner of the green-grocers.’
It was strange, the feeling of ultimate power. Sherlock had the ability to kill anyone, do anything, and he was virtually unstoppable. He finally knew what James had meant when he said,

It was the least traumatic of all of the revelations; John had been at the Palace in late October and they had been in the cinema room on the sixth floor, which held only Sherlock’s dance studio, William’s painting and dark room and the cinema room, meaning it was usually empty and quiet, watching some horrific romantic comedy. John couldn’t remember what it was called and could barely follow the plot, but Sherlock kept deducing the actors or imitating them or guessing what would happen next, which John found absolutely hilarious. They were cuddled up on the large sofas together, John’s head tucked against Sherlock’s chest, their legs entwined, when there was a knock on the door.
this dirty?’
‘I don’t know,’ Sherlock murmured. ‘I don’t know.’
They would throw him out, soon. Everyone had heard how awful he was. They’d heard the rumours about the Eye massacre. There was no way that they would give him a chance. No one ever did-
They sat in silence, Sherlock’s curly head resting against John’s good shoulder, and eventually John, who was starting to feel sleepy, said, ‘what are you going to do now?’
He had been going out with Mary for nearly three months. She was clever, she was pretty, she made him laugh, and he had honestly thought she was the one that would finally make him forget Sherlock. She wanted him to forget Sherlock; she told him that constantly. John thought he could be happy with her, that they had a future. Sherlock had been an intense, incredible pause before John began his
Harry threw open the door of the teen club.
‘Which balcony?’ Sherlock said innocently, batting his eyelashes at his brother. ‘There are lots of balconies, Mycroft.’
His Sherlock. No one else’s.
Mycroft smiled slightly and slid the phone back into his pocket (Sherlock was getting whiplash watching Mycroft and his bloody phone), smoothing down his formal suit and seizing the umbrella leaning against Sherlock’s chair. ‘Jealousy isn’t a good colour on you, Sherlock. I must go; be down in the next half hour.’
‘How did you-‘
'I-' Sherlock started to say, but John just shook his head. 'Shut the fuck up. I've tried to get over you, Sherlock, but I
‘Look at Watson!’
Everyone, that is, except John.
Dark hair, last seen soaking in blood outside a hospital. Blue eyes, last seen cold and unseeing. A long coat, last seen draped over the dead body of the person he loved most in the world.
‘Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel? Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in this country the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law? Will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of our country, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established here? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of your Kingdom, and to the Churches there committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them or any of them?’
Sherlock didn’t look at him, instead saying, ‘do you remember what I said when Morag told me I had to choose between you and my throne?’
If there was one thing that Sherlock and Mycroft agreed on, it was that Mycroft’s twins were the best children in the whole world. Mycroft was only twenty-five and Lestrade, his boyfriend/partner, was a year younger but they’d been together for years and when a ‘government’ friend of Mycroft’s had mentioned there was a trial involving the creation of infants from same-sex couples they had signed up straight away.
Oh, he loves it.
‘Je ne parle pas le francais.’ - I do not speak French
‘The little terror’s washed and dressed,’ she said. ‘Sherlock, I’m on the phone with the Chinese premier; he wants you to call him tomorrow to discuss a visit?’
They lay in silence, until John whispered, ‘I’ve waited my whole life for you, and the whole thing was worth it.’
‘Really,’ John murmured and he kissed Sherlock, kissed his cheek and his neck and his lips and his forehead, all the while murmuring, ‘it’s alright, Sherlock, everything’s alright, it’s all over now, you’re fine, we’re fine,’ over and over, and Sherlock was still crying but he was clutching John’s shoulders as if he were never to let go.
Even Sherlock.
‘You remind him of your mother.’ Mycroft finished, looking at Sherlock with narrowed eyes, wanting to see some sort of reaction when Mycroft mentioned his mother. Sherlock simply coughed and quickly changed the subject (
like he did the last time John saw him, over two years ago. ‘My brother mentioned that were holidaying here when I talked to him last week.’ He sniffed, looking around in disdain. ‘Not exactly the Carribean, is it, Johnny?’ He winked at his son, who remained in dumb silence, scarcely able to believe it, that his father was here and joking, laughing like it had been two days since he saw him instead of
Lizzie is there as well, of course: she wouldn't miss her adored brother graduating for the world. She brings Isla, her wife, and their baby girl Rebecca, who’s as good as gold and blinks up at John with large, intelligent eyes as he holds her.
John took a tentative step forward. ‘This is really awkward,’ John said as confidently as he could whilst surrounded by the Kingdom’s most incredibly powerful and rich people and as his voice echoed in the silent room, ‘but what’s going on?’
Holmes child. Though there’s not much contest.’
‘Whose are you, Sherlock?’ James growled as he pounded ruthlessly into the younger boy. Sherlock’s eyes were rolling in the back of his head and even as the sane part of his mind shouted body’s just transport, body’s transport, the part overtaken by feeling screamed never stop him, Sherlock. This is what you were born to do-
The boy raised his head. Curly black hair over a clear forehead, pale skin showing off razor-sharp cheekbones, a sarcastic smile and intense blue/green eyes that seemed both mocking and sad at the same time.
Victor shrugged. ‘He obviously cares about you, Sher. He didn’t even care about the fact I was a dude.’
Sherlock laughed bitterly. ‘I would be a detective. A consulting detective. Unfortunately, my career has already been picked out for me.’
Sherlock ignored him. ‘I’ll update you tomorrow, fatty!’ He shouted, sprinting to the third floor. As he spun around the corner, he heard Mycroft shout, ‘if you slept with my husband I will kill you s you sleep, Sherlock!’

Sherlock nodded silently, and John put a hand over Sherlock’s hand, resting on his knee. ‘I get it.’
Suddenly, there were a pair of strong hands on his shoulders and a head pressed against his shoulder. ‘Deep breaths,’ a voice he knew almost as well as his own whispered, ‘Deep breaths, John. Je t'ai. Je t'ai eu. Je suis avec vous, John.’
by James Blunt started playing.
He touches Sherlock’s foot gently, nudging him.
‘It’s your turn to tell me how brilliant I look compared to usual.’ John looked up at him hopefully but Sherlock frowned. ‘But John, you look no different. You’re just the same as always; resplendent.’
John felt a slight pull on his heart as Mycroft stepped towards the microphone.
ry, whatever Sherlock wanted him to say to make it better though deep inside he still hoped against all hopes that Irene hadn’t been lying-
‘He never cheated on my mother,’ Sherlock clarified. ‘He hasn’t cheated on Tessa, as far as I know. But he’s a player, John. Can’t get enough of the girls.’
John grinned and nudged Sherlock’s back: the younger boy laughed, a real, fresh laugh that echoed off the lake, and shook his head. ‘You really don't want to end up in this lake at night, John, we have no idea what’s in here.’
John looked at the paper in disbelief. ‘You wrote that in the hall. Bit pre-emptive, don’t you think?’
Sherlock, his best friend.
. ‘IF IT WASN’T FOR WATSON,’ the major screamed, pacing the line, ‘YOU WOULD ALL BE DOING THE WASHING-UP FOR A MONTH.’
And Sherlock was panicking madly, running towards the door, throwing it open and screaming John’s name but the older boy was gone, gone forever and it was all Sherlock’s fault, and he wanted to follow him but that sensible voice in the back of his mind was telling him he couldn't run around the palace naked, especially not with the most wanted man in the Kingdom lying on his bed with his come drying on the bedsheets, and so Sherlock went back into his room and started grabbing his clothes. It was desperate, it was pointless but he had to go and find John, he had to try, though he knew he wouldn’t be let out of the palace, he couldn’t cause a scene, but he had to at least try because a life without John was a life without meaning.
‘You’re always banging on about probability,’ Molly muttered. ‘Not everything in life is about probability, Sherlock.’
‘I am very clever,’ John replied, turning around so he was facing Sherlock. ‘Cleverer than you-‘
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his brother. ‘Idiot.’ John laughed, stopping when Mycroft turned his intense pale eyes on him. ‘Sorry,’ he muttered, feeling like a naughty school boy. Sherlock mouthed

and wondered what else he could definitely cross off.
They’ve been cleaned up and John can easily see that they are beautiful, beautiful children. One is slightly bigger, with a smarting of blonde hair and Nathaniel’s eyes, whilst the other has dark curls and bright blue eyes.
John nodded, blinking rapidly. He didn’t know why he was crying, for God’s sake. He hadn’t liked the man much. The feeling had been mutual.
John went to the palace every Wednesday for a year, trying to find a way to get close to Sherlock. Every Wednesday, Mike turned him away with a sympathetic smile and a, ‘sorry, mate. I’ve got orders. Someone up high has said you’re never allowed in the palace. Ever.’
John resisted the urge to laugh, instead biting his lip. ‘Right. Well-‘
And suddenly they’d collided, John pushing himself off his chair and into Sherlock’s lap, knee between his legs, hands pulling on his shoulders, his shirt, lips pressed against his, teeth biting, tongue stroking.
It didn’t stop John from trying, though. Every time he came back to Sherlock’s grave he would stand in front of it and repeat what he had said on the pavement outside St. Barts hospital, what he wished he’d said every day since they’d met, over four years ago.
‘Maybe we should let Daddy go, girls,’ John said pityingly. ‘He looks like he’s about to have a heart attack.’
‘You,’ the man slurred, ‘Are hot as fuck.’ He gripped Sherlock tighter, swaying with him in a totally rhythm-less circle. Sherlock mentally shrugged and let the man hold onto him, moving. The night was young, he was an addict, and the man was hot.
‘His mother died when he was very young, didn’t she?’ John asked quietly. Harry nodded. ‘He was only five or six. It was very public, though. You were probably a bit young but I remember this picture of him at the funeral. He was sitting by himself, this little kid in a suit and a tie, and everyone else was crying, and he just had this single tear streaking down his face. It was-‘ Harry swallowed. ‘It stayed with me. I hate them, I hate him, but no little boy should see their mother buried. Especially in the way she died…all that mystery.’ Harry fell silent, watching the TV through narrowed eyes.
They’d been so happy, in those ten years between Mary’s death and then Sherlock’s, and even after all this time he still misses him every single day.
The boy on the other bed laughed and then spoke for the first time, in a soft Irish lilt not dissimilar from Janine’s. ‘Oh, Miss Adler, wouldn't you like to know.’
Harry winked at him and John blushed. She was the only one who knew; she was the only one he had told, at least. Some of his mates, like Mike and Molly, at least suspected, but they never said anything which he appreciated.
Sherlock wasn’t ok. Sherlock wasn’t ok. Sherlock wasn’t ok-
Sherlock’s oar cut silently into the water, propelling them forwards, as John splashed and swore and tried to stay balanced in the back. ‘
Sherlock bit his lip. ‘James left it when- James left it. Pass my coat?’ He said, smiling as Victor complied. ‘Right. Out of the window, or out of the door?’
Hamish raised his hands in mock surrender. ‘Sorry, sorry, won’t get your name wrong again.’
‘Surprisingly, I’m not being sarcastic.’ Sherlock rubbed his chin, thinking thoughtfully. ‘What’s the date today?’
Sure enough, John said sarcastically, ‘so you got bored of Irene?’
Their son is born exactly three months after Sherlock’s death, two floors above the ward in which he breathed his last. Their son is born into a world without his father and he doesn't even know it. Their son is born with Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock’s eyes, blinking up at John with all the wisdom of a just-born babe, and it feels like John’s heart is breaking again, because their son will never know his father and he will never know
Sherlock smiled despite himself. ‘Yes. You did. You’ve put on at least two stone, although the slightly increased height and darker hair also suit you.’
'I know I'm probably too late,' John continued. 'I know that I waited too long, that I didn't listen. I know that what happened that day was partially my fault. But- Sherlock. I've come back because I can't live without you, and I want to be with you, and I love you. I love you more than anything, I love you completely, I love you.'
‘If you say so,’ Molly said doubtfully. ‘Put the heat on, Sherlock, and I’ll try and…salvage your t’s.’
Sherlock laughed, choking slightly on tears he hadn’t realised were there, and whispered, ‘I think so.'
Hopefully, John thinks, it’s because he’s emotional after the birth of his sons. Hopefully he’s not losing the rush.
Sherlock’s tongue in his mouth, Sherlock’s face cupped in his hand, Sherlock’s chest pressed again his.
before they were gone, and John was just staring at him, and Sherlock was just staring back, and then John made a choking sound in the back of his throat and ran, ran away from Sherlock.

Sherlock nodded, looking incredibly pleased. ‘Just girlfriends?’
‘D’you want to go to prom with me?’
The laughter died down and William stared at his mother in shock. ‘Pardon?’ He said incredulously.
‘You lost the little waiter, then?’ Mycroft was smiling, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. ‘I see. We’re waiting for you downstairs, Sherlock. Please be quick.’ With that, he turned and trotted quickly down the stairs, leaving Sherlock in the doorway.
century is alive with lies, and Sherlock…well. Sherlock thrives. Especially after the horror of the 19
Sherlock whipped back around. ‘Excuse me?’
‘Oh, here we go again,’ John said sarcastically. ‘I’m the King,’ he imitated, ‘so I’m better than you, and you, and EVERYONE IN THE FUCKING UNIVERSE-‘
Sherlock was needed to act as translator for a Chinese family who’d come to the resort (at fourteen, Sherlock had learnt three new languages since he’d met John: Mandarin Chinese, Arabic and German) so John had sauntered down to the adults pool to find Harry and his mother. Harry was off with the girl she was infatuated with (every time they came to the resort Harry would find another girl to decide she ‘loved’: first year, it was Clara, second year, it was Joanna, and this year it was Sally) and John just chucked his bag on a sun-bed and lay down.
Sherlock had looked blankly at Jim after his question, cocking his head to one side. ‘I haven't decided yet,’ he murmured as he gently traced his precipitate. ‘I have time.’
‘Not until you admit that girls are better than boys!’ Tavvy said, sitting on Sherlock’s ankles and tickling his knees.
‘What, in the last few weeks?’
and he needed to take action, because even from a distance he had seen Sherlock self destructing and he’d done
And John felt an ache in his chest that immediately convinced him that he was not over Sherlock, that he would never be over Sherlock, that he didn’t want to be over Sherlock and that he wanted nothing more than to be with Sherlock, right then, for the rest of their lives.
Sherlock slammed the door, and John was left staring at the younger boy through the glass, watching him lean against the counter and slam his head against the hard wood, before he left.
Jim sighed, disappointed at the lack of a reaction from John. ‘So ordinary. How do you live with it, Sherlock? Technically, though, Johnny, the reasons were in the wrong order. I fucked your little boyfriend over here first; then his father gave him the ultimatum, which was to break up with me or be disowned. He chose his Kingdom; I retaliated in the only way I thought fair.’ Jim smiled at Sherlock, teeth barred and eyes glinting and Sherlock remembered how hurt Jim had been when Sherlock, a scared, sixteen year old boy, had picked his family and promised never to see Jim again, the way his face had closed off and he had screamed that Sherlock would be sorry, that he needed him, that he couldn't banish him, and Sherlock had never regretted anything more in his entire life. Jim tilted his head to the side and whispered, ‘he broke my heart, you see, so I broke his Kingdom. An eye for an eye, as it were.’
‘Sherlock,’ Mycroft began, looking uncomfortable, ‘I see no way in which he would not agree to come with you. From what I can tell John Watson values you above anyone else in his life. True, I cannot see if he finds you sexually appealing-‘
John looked around, surprised. ‘You ok, Sher?’ He said, smiling that full-face smile that made him look so damned adorable it made Sherlock feel faint. He wished that John would be able to see himself at times like this; then he wouldn’t be forever going on about how ugly he felt around Sherlock, how perfect Sherlock was, how it was a miracle anyone fancied him at all. For someone so confident, John had a remarkably low self-esteem, and Sherlock thought it was stupid, especially when he compared himself to John. John was so much better than Sherlock in every single way and Sherlock couldn't see why John didn't understand that.
) and woman (
he thought to himself, and immediately shuddered at the mental image. Maybe not.
‘Two years and two months,’ John supplied. His voice was hoarse and scratchy.
John didn’t speak after that. He watched Sherlock for the rest of the speeches, watched his hard mask, and wondered if maybe it wouldn’t be so great being the heir to the throne of the most powerful kingdom in the world.
‘I don’t agree.’
Sherlock reached into the oven and took out the biscuits, which had crumbled into a dark brown sludge. ‘Well,’ he said. ‘They’re not exactly golden-brown, but I think I can make them work.’
‘Today’s Friday.’
‘Sherlock?’ John said softly. Sherlock was dragged out of his reverie and back into the present, looking at Mrs Watson. ‘Mm? Oh, yes. Yes, not athletic.’
John rolled his eyes. ‘The papers will be all over us, Sher, you know that.
Morag rolled her eyes and glared at him. ‘Your father would be outraged,’ she spat. ‘Outraged to know that you hadn’t risen to met the role of King as he did. You’re going to send this country to the pits, William-‘
‘You need me, Sherlock,’ Jim murmured, ‘and, God help me, I need you.’
Sherlock gazes at John, eyes still and unblinking, and John sighs, dropping the lifeless hand.
Sherlock relaxed in his arms and kissed James Moriarty.
‘Thank you!’ Sherlock beamed. ‘I mean, that would be wonderful.’ He turned to Harry and bowed his head. ‘Pleased to meet you, Harry.’
John jumped and then calmed down when he recognised the man behind him. ‘Mycroft. You scared the
Greg looked shifty; he refused to make eye contact, instead fussing over his daughter. ‘A few months ago, maybe April or May, I was asleep in the nursery and Sherlock came in. I wasn’t awake then,’ he added hastily.
Lizzie goes first, scuffing the ground with her shoes. ‘Hi, Dad. Long time no see. I’m in my first year at Uni now, studying English and History. I can almost imagine what you’d have said- you’d have been pissed that I wasn't becoming a detective like you! Sorry, I just didn't have that talent. Natty does, though, so maybe one of your kids’ll follow in your footsteps. I miss you every day, Dad.’ She sniffs and turns away from John and Nathaniel: she hates crying in front of other people. ‘I bought a chemistry set from the Uni, I had one of my friends nick it. I remember when you did your experiments and I’d help, and then Papa would yell at us.’ She pauses once more. ‘I miss that, Dad. Love you.’
‘The small, obnoxious looking one?’ John said without thinking before blushing furiously. Sherlock laughed again. ‘Yes. His name is Victor-‘
‘I’ve told you before. You’re a stupid little boy.’
Sherlock groaned. ‘What the hell am I meant to say to that?’
John leaned forwards, so close that when he spoke Sherlock could feel the cold rush of his breath against his cheek. ‘I see you as you, Sherlock. But not the you that you want people to see.’
‘As far as I see it, we enjoy the positives of marriage without the negatives.’ She reaches up, smiling seductively, looping her arms around his neck. ‘We should not play with that. We should not…expose ourselves.’
John gritted his teeth and interrupted. ‘What the fuck is wrong with you?’
John laughed as well. ‘Imagine us up there.’
‘Was that not good?’ Sherlock pondered. ‘Hmm. Have you seen the, um, rack on the Princess of Monaco? They seem to be quite big, related to the size of the three other teenage girls I know.’
and I deserve someone who clearly only used me for- for-
The idea that this girl’s boyfriend could walk in at any second and catch them combined with the indescribable feeling that came from having your cock sucked blows John’s mind. It’s the biggest thrill of his life and he
‘Indeed.’ Sherlock nodded at Molly, who was standing next to Irene, and said innocently, ‘so how’s
John took his hand off the handle and walked down the corridor slightly, reaching the door that led into the sitting room. He opened it slowly, creeping in and pausing at the open door between the kitchen and Sherlock’s room.
The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them, but they seemed to work; Sherlock lowered his arms and turned, eyes full of hurt. ‘I’m doing this for you, John-‘
Sherlock had done an unscheduled address, a few weeks after their births. He smiled as he remembered the look on Mycroft’s face when he told him.
He’s Janine’s cousin.’
Sherlock had laughed, at the time. Asked Jenny to stand up to her, to scream at her. He couldn’t, he said, so Jenny should.
‘Can’t disagree there,’ John laughed as he took his change. ‘There was a reason I did Spanish I’ll see you at school, yeah?’
John Watson loved danger. He loved the rush, the thrill, the buzz he got from doing something that had the potential to put him into danger more than anything else in his life.
Mycroft refused to let John pick up Sherlock to take him to the Prom.
But it wasn’t. She was pulling him closer to her, and then her head was on his shoulder and she was whispering into his ear, words tumbling over each other, and Sherlock couldn’t believe what he was hearing. The thoughts of John were banished from his mind; all he could hear was Irene.
‘John Watson, I believe that I am in love with you,’ he whispered, and John stood up on his tiptoes, and they were so close that Sherlock could feel John’s breath on his neck, and he said, ‘And I, Sherlock Holmes,
And John did just that.
he though tot himself. ‘My name is Sherlock Holmes.’
‘Tell me,’ John slurred as he drank some of the whisky.
Mycroft had adopted a soppy, lost-in-thought look that Sherlock wished never to see on his brother’s face again, and he opened his mouth to insult Mycroft or at least do something to break the weird tension, when he was interrupted by a sharp knock came on the door.
The moment the words were out of his mouth, there was a frenzied scream and the sound of gunfire.
more interesting than England. The books are better, the coffee is superb and the language…’ Sherlock kissed his fingers. ‘The language is
As Sherlock led the way down the corridor Victor, who was looking at him anxiously, whispered, ‘they still won’t-‘
Sherlock nodded, now slightly uneasy, and checked his watch, swearing under his breath when he saw what time it was. ‘Good. Um, John-‘
Sherlock squared his shoulders, wrenched his eyes away from those of John Watson (
John suppressed a snicker and Dick smiled widely. ‘Yeah, I know, but with a brother like Jim Moriarty you
Technically, Trisha and Archie should have swapped, but William refused to allow this; he insisted his wife should be next to him.
‘I think we should release a statement,’ John said for the millionth time. Sherlock sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He loved John, of course he did, but sometimes the other boy could be breathtakingly stupid. ‘If we do that, it’ll look like we’re trying far too hard. They’ll think we’re trying to cover it up.’
The announcer stepped up to the microphone and cleared his throat. ‘This is a scheduled official announcement,’ he shouted. ‘It is mandatory viewing for the entire nation, as well as the nations of our allies The United States of America, France, Spain and China. May I present Miss Harriet Jennifer Watson, Prince Edward Mycroft, Doctor John Hamish Watson and his royal highness King Sherlock William Scott!’
‘Il est juste d'être arrogants’ - He is just being arrogant
‘If you had to have sex with one of us, who would it be?’
‘Well, My told me you were asking all your friends what you should do to ask John to the prom, and I thought I would share my ideas.’ Lestrade smiled eagerly. ‘Come on, it’s a great idea. My keeps saying that you’re too wimpy to ask him and by writing a note you have no songs-and-dances, nothing humiliating and if he says no you can pretend it’s not from you.’
Mycroft sighed. ‘Look, Sherlock, I know that you’re exceedingly intelligent with a genius level IQ and you’ve been incredibly independent since you were six years old but you’re still my little brother and…it’s strange. Watching you grow. You’re going to University in September, you’ve got a job as a…’
‘It’s Sherlock, actually.’ Sherlock snapped, and he was pleased that all the thoughts of John had disappeared. ‘King Sherlock William Scott the First.’ Not wanting to get rid of his father’s name altogether, he had switched the order of his first and second names.
John had been so happy when Mycroft had told him that Xander’s middle name was to be Jonathan in John’s honour. Mycroft hadn’t explained why, but Sherlock had seen it in his eyes; his brother was grateful that finally Sherlock had someone who loved him, cared for him and protected him. It was his older brother’s way of saying thank you.
‘Wow.’ Jenny said, a dreamy look on her face. ‘Wow.’
The announcer read out their names and Harry snorted. ‘God, what a mouthful. Prince George Francis Archibald. Prince William Sherlock Scott.’
‘No.’ He answered bitterly. ‘No, my father doesn’t know. You saw what he did down there. He’d be repulsed. He wouldn’t allow it; he’d force me to marry some noble woman, and possibly disown me. I can’t be who I am, John, because of my father, and I really can’t handle anymore homophobia. I understand that you find it uncomfortable. I understand that you don’t like gay people. I just don’t- I can’t handle anymore shit about my sexuality, especially not from you.’ He was trembling by the time he was finished because he couldn't have John not accepting who he was, he really and truly could not, and please God let John not be homophobic because if Sherlock had to choose between John Watson and himself-
John pulled down his hood and looked around: there was no one in sight, save for a small woman wearing headphones by the bookshelves and an old man reading and sipping a cup of steaming coffee. John looked at the man, and then at the empty counter: was he
John shook his head at his daughter. ‘You don’t like her because she’s a girly-girl.’
Sherlock bit his lip.
happened with Sherlock before. Before it could get too bad, however, Sherlock looked back up and said, facing the lake so John still couldn't see his eyes, ‘Will you miss me?’
Sherlock spun back around, the calmness dissipating as he shouted, ‘yes! Yes, Morag. John is worth more than my friends, John is worth more than my family, John is worth more than my kingdom! I love him. I always will love him, and I will not sit back and let a group of ridiculous homophobes tell me that I can’t be with him!’
‘He seems so arrogant on TV,’ John had replied. ‘He seems like a right prick. And you’ve heard those rumours about his involvement in the Eye massacre.’
Sherlock glared at her; was she trying to be a complete idiot? ‘Now why would he do that, Molly?’ Approximately eight girls and one boy in our year of 75 students find John Watson attractive and I predict that at least two of the girls are willing to ask him to the prom, if he doesn't ask them first. The probability-‘
The one person he could never deduce again.
God, he
‘You can continue your little domestic,’ she smirked as mimicked Mrs Hudson, ‘later. Right now, Sherlock, we have a premier to attend.’ She turned and walked out of the room, not even checking to see if Sherlock was following, because she knew he would.
John had vowed to himself, there and then, that he would never put Sherlock in that position. He would stay alive for Sherlock.
Irene, sitting next to him, wasn’t watching either. She slipped her arm around him, an innocent enough gesture that was clearly just for show-
Sherlock closed his eyes and slowed his breathing. He couldn’t have a panic attack, not now, there would surely be people waiting when he got to the palace and he didn’t want to go back into therapy, that had done more bad than good.
) said, bored, ‘that is-‘
his by. His son, his daughter, their children, their spouses, all people that Sherlock would have loved but never got the chance to, but it doesn't matter because they exist and they let him celebrate Sherlock.
They’re lying on Sherlock’s bed, in Sherlock’s flat. They’ve just come from a case, and John is chattering happily, tracing Sherlock’s hand with his index finger. Sherlock has never been happier, but it is time.
Sherlock knew he was lying, but didn’t care enough to push it. The waiter was proving a pretty good distraction, and when he felt like this, he
‘Two of the Kingdom’s finest wards,’ John continued, ‘educated at Kingsborough Grammar school. One is the captain of the rugby team, one-‘
Sherlock stood up, trying not to look embarrassed. ‘Ah. Should have noticed that.’
John nodded in agreement, smiling supportively at his mother. It was their first holiday together since the divorce and he wanted it to be a success for her. ‘I think this’ll be great,’ he lied. ‘I really do.’
John should have said no, but that would have been a lie.
Molly had blushed. ‘You know why. It’s Prince Sherlock. God, everyone adores him. He was voted best looking teenager in the world last month.’
Molly went a deep burgundy colour. ‘Wha-
‘What’s a home?’ Sherlock said softly. He was talking to himself but the chauffer heard and said, ‘home? Home’s what you look forward to during a tough day at work. Home’s the place you miss when you go away. Home’s what you long for when you’re feeling down. Home’s what makes you happy, sir.’
John looked up, and Sherlock’s brain froze. ‘I couldn’t contact you. I was too- embarrassed.’
As if on cue he feels a little hand touch his shoulder and turns. Nathaniel is on his left, head cocked as he stares at the gravestone, and Lizzie is on his right, arms folded behind her back, and even though he feels as sad as he ever thought he could feel, John doesn't feel alone. He has his children, and they matter to him more than anything.
Jenny, John’s mother, was pulling a similar face. ‘Well. Um. I…it didn't look like this in the leaflet.’
‘My God,’ he gasped, and John tilted his head back as he came as well, shuddering against Sherlock as he braced himself on the back of the chair.
‘You broke the hearts of your wife and your children, Henry, and you have
‘I know the plan. Morag makes Sherlock kill himself; if she fails Jim lures him to the roof and makes him kill himself by jumping off. They’re using you as bait, John, but they’re lying.’
She flashed them a quick smile. ‘Just excited. Hopefully they’ll be fast, right? I don’t want to sit in the waiting room forever.’
for being with him,
‘We could go down there,’ Sherlock said from behind him, and John whipped around, startled. ‘Jesus, Sher, warning, next time.’
‘Cock,’ John whispered back, and hugged him tighter: Sherlock nuzzled his neck, breathing in John, everything about John,
answered vaguely, ‘Dare.’
A slight smile ghosted his lips. ‘All I ask for is a minor role in government-‘
In the last two weeks of his holiday especially he’d spent every waking minute with Irene, and they’d really bonded. He’d learned that although Irene was going for Molly, she was mostly just trying to get back at Janine, who’d arrived at the beginning of July and announced that she had a
) screamed from nearby, hurling himself across the small room and into his brother’s arms. Sherlock patted the child awkwardly on the back. ‘I had breakfast with you this morning, Archie. No need to treat me as if I’ve just returned home from war.’ He muttered.
‘Indeed.’ Sherlock nodded. ‘But, please, Sherlock. I’m here unofficially.’
At this point, they started kissing.
‘Shut up.’ Sherlock said, and he could actually feel his eyes flashing, focusing and un-focusing, and for a moment Morag looked almost frightened. He had only got this feeling once before; when she had told him he was worthless, almost three years ago. John had been there then-
John laughed incredulously. ‘Jesus! Have you ever met any of them?’
Not now, of course. Now he was perfectly content to submit to Jim and let him do whatever the hell he wanted.
Mike looked at him quizzically. ‘He hasn’t been in touch?’
John laughed and pulled Sherlock back towards him, kissing him again, and Sherlock knew that he wouldn’t care if he died then, right there and then, because he would die happy, he would die in love and loved, and he would die with John.
Rosie and Sherlock sat next to each other like two peas-in-a-pod, almost vibrating with excitement, their right legs bouncing up and down to an identical tempo. John was quieter, thinking about the last time he went to Bart’s for this reason- he was only thirty, caught up in an emotional rollercoaster with the wife he loved and the best friend who’d just returned from certain death, and yet the moment he had laid eyes on Rosamund Mary he’d known he would do anything for her. After the death of his first love, her mother, he’d fallen for his true love, Sherlock Holmes, and created the unconventional but unbelievable family he had now-
‘He’ll be downstairs, love.’ Jenny said comfortably. ‘No need to bother him. He won’t mind. John…are you…’
All he could see was black.
Sherlock didn’t laugh. He stood up and glared at Mycroft, scowling at him as he said, ‘he’s right, you know. It’s fucking ridiculous.’ Then he too stood and stormed away.
Sherlock had been so shocked that he dropped his petri dish. ‘No, no, no,
She pushed the door open; in the light, Irene Adler looked almost exactly as she had done three years ago, though her mouth was pinched with worry.
Sherlock was hot, and he didn’t care that he might never see him again, because he’d had the night of his life regardless.
His mother’s face when she saw all the people and costumes and floats reinforced this definition quite definitely in John’s mind, especially when she tugged on his father’s shirt and whispered, ‘Let’s go another way, Henry.’
It had been too painful, in the beginning, to see Sherlock’s face; John hadn’t read a newspaper in three months, just in case, so he just stopped looking. If he saw a picture of the family he ignored Sherlock, however hard it was. If he saw him, he would snap, and if he snapped…
Lestrade nodded, blinking rapidly. Sherlock felt slightly guilty which was absurd; he never felt guilty, why would he suddenly now? He was Sherlock Holmes; he cared about nothing and no one, ever.
Silence. It is not a phrase they use, not a phrase many people use, and Sherlock realises that he has almost forgotten what love feels like. He loves Mycroft, he supposes, but it is a love that had evolved into something that doesn’t quite fit the bracket of the word. He loved his family, his first love, Francis, back before he stopped aging (almost three hundred years ago, he realises with a start). He’d thought he loved James.
Why had John told himself it was the right decision, over and over, when the phone calls and text messages had stopped?
‘And completely platonic,’ Sherlock interrupted. ‘We’ve always been platonic. From the moment we first touched, Irene, you know it.’
‘Semantics,’ Sherlock drawled with a wave of his hand as he eagerly scanned the waiter. ‘Twenty-four…training to be a surgeon…one brother…abusive father…lover of
Ella, standing by the door, picked up John’s phone from the table and raised her eyebrows in silent question, and John, the only one looking, nodded quietly and looked back down at his son, his son and his daughter and his partner, as she snapped a picture-
Sherlock shook his head, clearing the momentary emotion from his brain and smiling coldly at Victor. ‘Enough of that. You in a mood to piss off a King?’
John has gone very pale. ‘He looks-acts-like a normal teenager.’
Sherlock hardened his heart.
Molly had been so offended that John would suggest such a thing that she hadn't spoken to him in almost a week, although she had heard the rumours too and John knew that he was speaking the truth.
‘I could barely handle one of them,’ John groaned as he sat in his chair, ignoring his husband completely. ‘Let alone two. If Jake-‘
Jenny was almost hyperventilating, barely able to speak. ‘Why are you
‘Irene will flip if she finds out,’ John laughed. ‘Ant, we’re not meant to break pictures, are we?’
a new contact, I don’t
The man looked up. His curls flopped in front of his eyes, which sparkled in the strangest blue/green colour John had ever seen. His mouth curved into a slight smile. A bright red mark snaked its way around his neck, ending with what looked like a thumb curving up to just touch the crest of his chin. ‘Ah, John Watson. Took you long enough.’
Sherlock would know. He had been responsible for one of the biggest disgraces in their family less than six months previously and it had gotten him into so much trouble at one point he was almost banished.
Jim smiled and said very slowly, ‘the first reason was because, after I was given the codes to the British Security System, I used them to piece together a team of assassins and bomb experts and then blow up the London Eye.’
‘Pst, Jean,’ Mike whispered. ‘We’re all enjoying the, ah,
No one moved. No one spoke.
Sherlock nodded and opened the oven.
John stood there, brain racing, as he tried to work out what was going on. Was he dreaming? Was he part of a new reality TV show? Was this a really fucking elaborate joke by the Cambridge twats?
The boy, Sherlock, chuckled. It wasn’t sarcastic, an actual laugh filled with actual humour, and John was surprised that it didn’t piss him off. It was a nice laugh, even. ‘I really would stop being so rude to me, John Watson. You may regret it.’
‘Daddy, I found a box.’
Then they were kissing, John’s hand in Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock could taste the salt from the tears on John’s lips and then he could feel water streaking down his face and realised that he was crying, which was ridiculous because Sherlock hadn’t cried since he was five years old but he didn’t care, because John was kissing him and him and John would be married and who cared about what people would think, what people would say because he would have John, and if he had John then everything would be ok.
‘Yet.’ Mycroft added. John sat back in his chair and tried to stop smiling; the fights between Mycroft and Sherlock were absolutely hilarious. They took them so seriously whilst everyone else in the room just stood there, debating whether to laugh or call the police.
John laughed, because it was such a
‘What was it?’ John asked, wiping a smudge of dirt from his son’s face. Sherlock shrugged. ‘She refused to give it to me, she said it was for you. That child is fiercely independent.’ Mycroft and Lestrade’s youngest, Matilda, had recently turned sixteen and without her two older brothers to keep her in check, she had gone slightly out of control.
‘For fuck’s sake,’ John cursed, and then he pulled Sherlock down to his height and kissed him.
‘He’s
He strikes a match before he even begins reading, ready to burn.
that this didn't feel like a thousand daggers, stabbing into his heart, as he realised Sherlock had moved on. He stood up, blindly rushing out of the room, his breathing laboured as he tried to make sense of the situation-
He nodded. ‘Yes.’ He managed. ‘Oh, yes.’
‘Of your imminent Kinghood? No.’ Mycroft replied snidely. ‘Of father’s blatant favouritism of you? I wouldn't say jealous was the right word, but if you like.’
Sherlock grabbed his cap and jammed it on his curls. Victor raised an eyebrow. ‘What the fuck hat is that? Is it a tourist one?’
Sherlock smiled and pressed a kiss to John’s forehead, before taking his hand.
John stopped in front of them, deeply out of breath. His hair was mussed up, he’d clearly been wearing his clothes for more than twenty-four hours, and his eyes were red and swollen (
John elbowed Sherlock and Sherlock nodded at John's mother. ‘Yes, Mrs Watson. I’m sorry.’
Sherlock groaned and threw back his head. ‘You’ve been having me followed again.’
John tried to stand up, but the moment his head was above the cart he heard a gunshot. The bullet whistled past his ear; Becca pulled him down.
‘SHERLOCK!’ John shouted, and Lila screamed back, ‘Don’t start shouting! That’s way too fucking stressful!’
‘Mycroft told me about that staircase, when we were dating. I used to come here when you went to do official stuff. It probably scared the hell out of all the people constantly camped out in the square.’ John spoke softly and sat down on the edge of the roof: Sherlock, in his heavy robes, followed his lead. It felt like he hadn't sat down all day, save for the throne, and the relief was incredible.
Sherlock slipped through the door to the nursery. Lestrade was fast asleep in one of the chairs and Sherlock smirked, half-debating taking pictures, but he decided it was slightly perverted and walked past it to the cribs.
‘It’s a good thing I am, Mummy, he’s fornicating with girls and planning romantic liaisons with boys-‘
anything. You should never underestimate Jim Moriarty, though, you’d said it so many times, and by the time I’d got to you there were bullets through that brilliant brain and you were dead.’ John puts his head on the gravestone. ‘I can’t do anything about that now, Sherlock, though
‘You’ll die if I don’t!’ Sherlock shouted. John shook his head. ‘You don’t get it, Sherlock, if you’re not here I’ll die anyway. All I want, all I will ever want, is for us to be together, and I don’t care if we’re dead or alive, as long as we aren’t apart again, because that almost killed me, Sherlock. Please don’t leave me, please.’ He reached out a hand, looking straight at Sherlock, plain eyes fixed on complicated, and he hoped that Sherlock would believe him and he hoped that Sherlock would step away.
And now it was here, and every thought, every imagine, was forgotten. All that mattered was John Watson, wearing a tight pair of black jeans, a navy jumper and looking as scared as Sherlock felt.
Christopher was ignoring her, chatting away to Sherlock, blue eyes sparkling intelligently. ‘You gave Charlie four names,’ he pointed out. ‘Charlotte Jennifer Violet Sherlock. And Jacob has four names; Jacob William Hamish George.’
. They would see reason. Of course they would.
‘Fuck.’ John stepped backwards, his legs almost giving way as he stumbled away from the body. ‘Fuck, Sherlock, fuck, we need to go.’
There were so many questions that John wanted to ask Sherlock that he knew he never would. What had actually happened to his mother? Why did Sherlock look so sad when he thought John couldn't see him? What had really happened with James, the boy that John suspected had been very, very close to Sherlock at one point but ended up causing the deaths of over seven hundred people?
‘Fourteen lines long,’ Sherlock corrected himself. ‘I so cannot be arsed, Mike.’
Also that Sherlock was gay, Irene was a lesbian and they had no romantic feelings towards each other, but mainly the in-love-with-John thing.
John shakes his head, hands still tangled in Sherlock’s hair, and he says in a voice that doesn’t sound quite as broken as it did before, ‘Later.’
John sighed. ‘Look, if you’re worried about the holding-‘
‘I could hear the tap running in the bathroom, so I decided to hide in the wardrobe. I was sitting on a big dark coat and I was looking through this gap, waiting for her to come out. I was going to jump at her, pretend I was a pirate, scare her, and then she'd pretend she was frightened just t make me feel good about myself. And then she came out, and I started to open the door, but before I could jump out I saw she was holding a gun.’
‘I didn’t mean it literally,’ Mrs Hudson rolled her eyes and patted Sherlock’s arm. ‘Go and talk to him, dear. You’ll sort him out.’ She pottered down the hallway and Sherlock smiled. The affection he felt for his ex-nanny and current housekeeper was second only to John (his feelings for Mycroft were not affection, more exasperated tolerance).
A whooshing sound went through John’s ears.
‘Sherlock.’ John says again, and Sherlock nods. ‘Right. Um, the 20
Before John could finish the door was thrown open and Irene entered, Sherlock’s youngest son safely in her arms. Sherlock sat up, dropped the heart, and shouted, ‘potassium!’
Henry clasped his hands together (
John suddenly stopped, and Sherlock doubled back. ‘What are you doing?’
‘Wait.’ Harry said suddenly. ‘John, you’ve met King William?’
John, sitting next to Harry, turned to look at the television. He checked his watch; ten minutes.
‘You couldn’t.’ Sherlock said. ‘I’m fine. I’m used to it. 'Conceal, don't feel.'

‘No.’ Sherlock replied, anger eating at his heart, ‘you manipulated my father into making bad decisions and I’m sure you’ve done illegal things for your own gain. Most of all, Morag, you’re a bitch.’
Repeat it for me?’
Sherlock lifted his head and caught John’s lips in his. ‘I love you,’ he whispered again, eyes glazed as he stared into John’s eyes, as clear and blue as the sky on a summer day. ‘I love you, John.’
and it wasn't even weird thinking it about another guy because the other guy’s
There was still silence. Sherlock glanced at Mycroft, who shrugged helplessly; Sherlock had reached the end of the speech Mycroft had prepared for him. John clutched Sherlock’s hand, wondering what his fiancé was going to do.
Sherlock smirked. ‘Nah. I’m irresistible.’
‘Basically,’ Dick said as if she’d never spoken, ‘Jim’s a genius. Like, a certified genius, but he’s evil. He already has this little gang, I’m pretty sure he’s organised murders, and he’s scary as hell to be around. I’m his twin and he scares me.’ Dick paused, and looked at John closely. ‘You’re the boy who Sherlock was in love with?’
‘What?’ John sounded shocked. ‘You weren't listening? Are you fucking, Sher?’
‘I love you.’ Sherlock gasped as John pulled away again, kissing his chin and his neck. ‘God, John, I love you, I really, really do.’
‘My mother.’ Sherlock had replied simply. His mother had loved taking him to the studio, teaching him complicated sequences before he performed them to Mycroft. That was why Mycroft liked watching him dance, Sherlock thought; as he watched his brother dance, his older brother could imagine the woman who had given him a family again there as well, dancing with her son.
his reputation because hell, John had wanted to kiss Sherlock all holiday (and for at least a year before that) and he was drunk. It was a brilliant,
John was infamous as a bit of a player, and the rumours about who he had done and what he had done with them were wide and many. His favourite was one that had been made up by Mike; when they had gone on their rugby tour. John had got off with a girl in Australia, then a girl in Indonesia, then a girl in Italy in the space of three weeks, earning him the nickname ‘Three Continents Watson’, a name which the younger children liked to whisper in the corridors when he walked past them.
