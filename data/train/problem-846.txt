John nodded obediently, resting heavier against Sherlock until his body was all that was holding him up. "Love you," he murmured before he slipped off to a deep, heavy sleep.
Sherlock reached up and touched his hair, nodding a little. "At least it's the right colour again," he murmured quietly. "I can't pull off blond, and the ginger was just weird," he said.
Maria shook her head. "Blood test," she replied easily, noting the concern on Sherlock's face. "John," she said, turning to the Alpha, "can I talk to Sherlock alone, please?"
Sherlock's brows furrowed, stabbing a piece of pasta. "When you say rejecting, you mean more throwing up don't you?" he asked. He looked over at John, then back to his plate. "I want this go quickly... I feel like it's just going to get more tedious."
John chuckled quietly, running his fingers through her dark hair and soothing one finger down her cheek. "Wants her way," he said quietly, watching as she pulled her arm free again. "Stop that now," he chided softly, putting her arm back into her bundle.
John smiled kindly, running his fingers through Sherlock's curls and placing a kiss to his forehead. He moved down to inhale at the crook of Sherlock's neck, brushing his lips along the mark on the side of his neck.
Sherlock sighed, slowly thinking. "Might... might not happen again," he murmured quietly. He shifted a little, pressing back more against John. "Most times my heat only lasts two days. But that's without any of this, no relief or release," he said with a contented sigh.
Sherlock blinked once when he caught John looking at him. He hesitated before moving into the kitchen.
"We had dinner at Gran's, it's time for bed little one," he said. Katherine protested lightly, but ended up running upstairs to change after kissing and hugging Sherlock. He walked over to John, "Will you tuck her in? I want to climb into bed, pretty tired from the drive.‚Äù
Sherlock blinked as she settled in a minute, blinking a few times as she looked up at him. He smiled a little. "Sorry about that," he murmured, looking up at John. Maybe they could do this.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Studies have shown that it's perfectly harmless, the only damage it really does is to your lungs and that's from smoking, and short term memory with prolonged use which isn't permanent. In fact,
"Hush, hush," John whispered, pressing his lips to his forehead. "Calm down, love, you're alright. We'll take it slow; you're okay." He stroked his hand over Sherlock's back for a moment, letting them sit in silence. "Come on," he murmured, pulling away and lying back down, "plenty of room, as you said."
Sherlock's mouth quirked up a little in one corner. "Thinking," he murmured. "You needed the sleep still," he said. God knew how much he'd be getting over there. He let out a breath, opening his eyes and looking at John. "It's all fine... right?" he asked carefully, looking at John.
John noticed instantly when Sherlock stopped watching his feet, and he started doing some different motions, making their feet moving a little faster, a little more in time to the music. Sherlock's fingers continued to play their tune on his back, but John didn't mind, finding comfort in it instead. "You seem to be getting the hang of it to me," he noted, spinning Sherlock away and quickly pulling him back.
John closed his eyes, covering the tattoo with his palm -- not to hide it, but to hold it closer to himself. "Doctors have a white patch with a red cross of the left arm of their fatigues," he said quietly. "And Captains have purple and gold flags on their chest pockets. Every time I wasn't in my bunker, I was marked. I was the biggest, boldest target. Yes, Sherlock. I was expecting to die over there."
Sherlock swallowed, wondering if he should mention the bullet he took from the sniper that was going to kill her son. Mindy didn't understand all the details, and she couldn't. "Yes well... I don't want him to have to do that," he said. "Fact remains, whether he puts himself there or I do, he's still put there, and it's to do with me," he said, shifting uncomfortably. He sighed, looking down.
John almost sobbed when Sherlock walked away, wanting to demand that he come back, but then he stopped at the foot of the bed and he stopped his protest before it came out. He nodded slowly, still unable to really move too much, and reached out for his son, who looked a lot like his own baby pictures. His smile widened when Sherlock settled him into his arms, and he ignored the few tears that ran down his cheeks. "Hello, Hamish," he whispered, touching the tip of his finger to his son's palm. "I've been waiting a long time to see you."
Sherlock hummed, looking worriedly over John's bandages. He swallowed, whimpering and moaning a little as John's teeth moved down his body. "J-John..." he breathed, his head leaning back into the bed.
Sherlock smiled, holding his hand down to the front of the chair. Katherine squealed in response to John, stomping one foot and letting out a long string of babble as if complaining about the effort it took to cross the two yards across the room. "Yes, yes, we hear you, now come on over here if you want up," Sherlock said, waving his fingers.
John nodded softly. "Surprised Mum doesn't know. If she does, she's keeping it quiet for the same reason." He sighed, rubbing his eyes.
John smiled at his daughter, kissing her forehead. "Nightmares?" he asked softly, though of course he knew. "I still have those, too. Nothing wrong with nightmares, baby. Sometimes they help us see things that we missed." He sighed, combing through Kat's hair and continuing to murmur softly to her.
John nuzzled into Sherlock's neck, moaning low in his throat at the desperation that he found there. "Jesus, Sherlock," he groaned, thrusting harder, faster, into his mate, pushing him up the bed with the force of his thrusts. He wrapped his fingers around Sherlock's erection, tugging slow and long to counter balance his quick thrusts. "One more," he urged, feeling his knot starting to swell.
Sherlock shut his eyes, swallowing thickly as he nodded. He didn't want this, and yet it was. He bit down on his lip, letting out a breath. "Then it looks like we can do it...we'll have to." He kissed John's cheek and down his neck a little, resting there and inhaling his scent. "Just, because I doubt I'll be able to talk when we get there, take care of yourself, and don't lose it. Don't you dare, John. Because you need to come back. And...when you're past the security point...turn around this time. We need to see you that last time because not seeing you...it's worse."
He almost followed, but Katherine was screaming now, and he couldn't leave her. He composed himself a little, shakily picking up Katherine and trying to shush her, rubbing soothing circles on her back as he looked at the door, terrified for what was happening with John.
John let out a small sigh, nuzzling into Sherlock's hair before tucking his head under his chin. "We can show her your bond marks, and tell her it's a bit like them," he suggested quietly. "I hate lying to her, but until she's at least eight, I'd rather not get into the whole secondary gender dynamics with her."
"Mm love you too," Sherlock murmured. "Know it... jus' hard for me normally. Emotions aren't my area," he murmured quietly.
This was... nothing at all like Sherlock thought it'd be. He'd had sex before certainly, but it was never his choice, and it had hurt most of the time. This wasn't just that though, this was something he needed, and John cared enough for him to do it, and was John, and was perfect. He pressed kisses to John's jaw and neck between his panting breaths.
John let out a long breath, scrubbing both of his hands down his face and nodding slowly. "Yeah, alright, I'll talk to Mum when she gets out. I'd rather not upset Kat more, unless she offers up anything to me," he said softly, noticing his sister's stance and immediately trying to put a check on his pheromones.
John laughed at the comment. "I'm glad to see you awake. And of course I'm still here." He leant forward, cradling Sherlock's hand between both of his.
Sherlock let out a breath, squeezing John's hand lightly. "You left in February, John," he murmured. "It's only been ten months, but that's ten months too many." He pushed John from the lift and out of the hospital. There was a car waiting for them, Mycroft, and he helped John in, settling next to him. He looked over at John, then leaned against him a bit. "He's been a bit generous lately, it's weird, he spends so much time at home and with me. I think he wanted the practice. "Greg's due around the 30th. Elizabeth Victoria Lestrade-Holmes. Isn't that just a mouthful, and I thought my name was long." he said with a smile, he didn't think he'd actually told John his full name.
John inhaled shakily, turning his head to look at Sherlock and furrowing his brows. "Feels like I have to throw up, but I can't. I'm getting kind of shaky, but that's just from feeling like I need to get sick, probably." He closed his eyes, letting out a small groan. "If this continues for much longer, I'm probably going to make myself throw up just to get it out of my system."
Hamish settled a little, his little forehead creasing a little at the change in arms holding him. He looked up with large eyes at John, and Sherlock smiled, feeling a tug in his chest. Hamish instantly brought his fist up to his mouth and started sucking on it, still looking at John intently. Sherlock sighed, "I swear Hamish, I only brought a few bottles with formula in them, you need to slow down babe," he murmured, getting up and taking a bottle from his bag that had some powder in it. He moved to the sink and added hot water, shaking the bottle up and waiting for the bubbles to diminish. He tested it on his wrist and held it out for John. "He's hungry, he'll suck on his fist for a bit before he starts screaming about it...best to do it before he does. He'll wake the whole ward."
"Yes, I really think so. Lestrade's a normal person, and that's how normal people react," John replied.
He pulled out his IVs and yanked off the oxygen nubs by his nose, throwing off the blankets as the Alpha doctor's scent level increased. "He's sick, you dick, get the hell out," John growled, pushing to his feet and walking over to the bathroom. He leant heavily against the door jam, holding out his hand. "Give me the syringe, and leave," he said, his voice surprisingly level.
They had stopped because John couldn't go on anymore, and they knew that pushing him would kill him faster. They'd been holed up in this small cave for the last five days, Bill tending John's wounds and Stephen keeping watch at the mouth of the cave.
A little over a week later was the sixteenth, and Sherlock stayed in the flat. He stared at his violin, wanting nothing more than to play it, but he couldn't. He just sat there staring at it. Mycroft texted once, offering to send a car if Sherlock wanted to join him. Sherlock didn't reply.
Sherlock's heart seized up and he nodded quickly, taking John's hand tightly and pulling towards the door. He grabbed an extra bag for Hamish that he always kept on hand for needing to leave in a hurry, formula, bottles, and nappies and such. They hurried down the stairs and hailed a cab. As soon as they were inside he wrapped his arms around John. "I-it's going to be fine...they're fine, and she...she's going to be fine John. She has to be." he said quickly, scenting John. He was trying to calm John, but also himself. All he could think about was Katherine and Hamish, had they been there? Were they hurt at all? What about their grandmother?
Silly me...I forgot to update yesterday. Sincere apologies! Work was killer so...yeah. Also, important announcement at the end of the chapter.
Sherlock swallowed, not sure what to say. He was quiet for a moment, thinking and carefully sifting through his thoughts surrounding John; he hadn't tread there in a while. "I... I missed you," he said finally.
"That's not what I'm worried about. I just don't want to leave you." John leant up on his elbow, running his fingers through Sherlock's hair and looking down at him. "We've still got a while, though. I don't want to worry about it now."
Sherlock nodded, he knew John hadn't tried, and he'd come home after all. He would fight with Mycroft, get him assigned somewhere further from the lines, in a recovery hospital if at all possible. He had more to live for now. When he left the first time it was just Sherlock, now...it was more than that. So much more. He got up carefully, carrying Kat and sitting in John's chair, cuddling her close to him. "It's going to be okay." he said quietly, trying to reassure her...and himself.
"No," Sherlock said quickly. "I hardly remember or care about feeding myself; I would just kill a child sooner as help it," he said, looking down at his wrists.
Sherlock shook his head, wincing at the needle in his arm. What had John given him? He shook, pulling back from John before he vomited again, feeling his side tear again. He whimpered. He couldn't go into a heat now. He wasn't supposed to, he was going to wait. He didn't want another two or three months of not feeling all the way like John's. "G-get back in bed, you s-stupid idiot," he tried to scold, curling up close to the porcelain bowl.
Sherlock leaned into her touch and closed his eyes, nodding his head. He bit his lip a little, then smiled, "Thank you," he said softly. He looked over towards the door when John came back into the living room, lead in by Harry who smiled and beckoned Katherine to her. Sherlock stood, crossing the room and wrapping his arms around him. "We'll be okay," he said quietly, meaning all of them, him and John, him and Katherine and the pup, all of them. They'd all be fine, and this would pass. He pulled away, showing the bottle. "The pup'll know your scent," he whispered, and I'll send you his...and mine. And I'll have yours...and when you get back, he'll know you," he said quietly.
Sherlock allowed himself to be moved, his heart speeding up instinctively; usually being pinned like this wasn't a good thing. He swallowed, looking at John and shivering slightly as he licked and nipped at his neck. "S-said that I didn't smell like me either," he said, gasping a little as John bit more on one of his marks. He went limp, completely pliant beneath the Alpha, pinned as he was. With anyone else... he would have minded. Did mind in fact, before. "He ruined it," he said quietly, after catching his breath.
John smiled a little sadly, following Sherlock out into the living room. His gaze softened when he saw Katherine, sound asleep and sucking on her thumb, her hair sticking up in all directions. He sat down slowly in his chair, holding out his arms for Sherlock, wrapping his arms around him once he was in his lap.
He would live. Sherlock looked around the alley, and then back down at the man, resting his hand cautiously on the side of his face. It wasn‚Äôt as warm as it should have been, but he had lost a lot of blood, it would take time for him to replenish it.
"We'll take it easy, then," John replied, wincing at the obvious pain the Omega was in. "You may as well lie back down. I'm not going to push your stomach with food right now."
Mycroft they were talking about. He smiled a little, unconsciously scooting a bit closer to John as he sipped on his tea. He noticed the glance from Harry, and her and John's silent exchange, able to read already what it was about.
Sherlock smiled a little, nipping lightly at John's neck. "Have to eat. You tossed up that muffin, remember? And I've hardly eaten anything since the case ended and I find myself... with a rather large appetite for once," he said, nibbling at John's ear carefully.
Sherlock swallowed, looking at the two of them. He gave a small smile at John, glancing at Harry as she got up and walked past Sherlock, grinning like a Cheshire cat. He let out a breath, moving over to the sofa and sinking down onto it, not saying anything, not sure what he could say.
Sherlock blinked his eyes open, seeing Mycroft there. "Myc?" he asked drowsily. He was actually there? Sherlock didn't expect him to come. Mycroft walked over and set a hand on Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock covered his face, not sure where the surge of emotion was coming from, but he didn't even try to analyse it this time. He mumbled between sobs and hiccups in what sounded like French, coughing a few times before burying his face again in the pillow, shaking.
Sherlock let out a soft breath. "Yes but... I don't know how to... the whole talking thing... sorting it all out I ‚Äì" he sighed. "I don't even have myself sorted... I can't expect to help with that. And the point is there are some people out there that know more than I do... about some things anyway," he murmured. "I just don't want it to sneak up on you later down the road... like if... when we do have, you know," he said quietly.
John smiled despite himself, wiping at his cheeks to dispel the tears. "God, I missed you too. I missed you doing that," he said, gesturing at Sherlock in a way that was supposed to indicate his deduction.
Sherlock thought about that, letting out a breath and squeezing John's hand softly in return. He could only really think of one person he loved. Though perhaps Mycroft? He cared for his brother, as annoying as he was. And in their own way, they showed affection. But John was different. "I see," he said softly.
Sherlock took the railing and slowly moved up them, getting a little winded by the time he reached the top. He moved into the living room and eased himself onto the sofa with a sigh, leaning his head back with his eyes shut.
Sherlock smiled a little, "You're more handsome." he murmured quietly. "And I still think she looks a bit like you. She'll grow into your nose," he murmured. "You just wait," he said with a grin.
‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù John whispered, his hands clenched tightly. ‚ÄúPlease keep bidding, Mike.‚Äù He could see how uncomfortable the boy was on the stage, how malnourished he was.
Sherlock blinked a few times. "Nothing on Moriarty yet but.... Moran. Sebastian Moran. He was the one in the flat," he said, swallowing thickly. He turned the phone slightly to show John the picture.
John swallowed, knowing that Sherlock wanted someone on his side, someone to baby him and talk him gently through it. But that's not what John was for, and that wasn't what Sherlock needed. "You're suffering from PPD and you're refusing medical help, even though you're in a facility that could easily provide it for you. Why? You're intelligent. Far above the rest of us idiots, but there you are, complaining that they took¬†our¬†son away from you, and you're not doing¬†anything? Sherlock, what the hell?" He didn't yell, because yelling would make his heart rate increase, and he couldn't have that. "I went through two solid weeks of torture that you cannot even begin to imagine, even after the shit that you went through after your fake death. And I did¬†not¬†go through it so that I could be discharged permanently and return home to a fianc√© locked up in a hospital and two emotionally scarred children."
Sherlock smiled, tearing the paper off and gasped a little for her. "A new bow... wow Katty, it's beautiful. Thank you," he said warmly, running his hand over it gently. "We'll have to try it out," he said. He looked over at John, handing him the package with John's camera in it. "For you," he murmured softly.
John ate his food, playing with a curious Hamish while he did, letting the infant hold his hand and pull on his fingers. Katherine ate quickly, and John managed to eat half of his dish. He was just playing with the remainder when Angelo came out with pieces of cake for them, a candle stuck in Sherlock's. John grinned at the obvious flush of embarrassment that went across Sherlock's cheeks, and then they sang him 'Happy Birthday,' Kat a little off-key, but it was still good.
Sherlock lifted his arms, tugging John's jumper off, gentle when it came to John's shoulder. He heard the noise of John's dog tags hanging from his neck, where they also dragged against Sherlock's stomach as John kissed him.
John stood and walked into the bathroom, turning the shower on as hot as it would go. He barely caught himself still dressed and stripped down before stepping in.
Sherlock continued to try and jerk away, but Mycroft simply wrapped his arms around him, and Sherlock was almost reminded of when they were younger, and Sherlock had skinned his knee, Mycroft pulling him close.
John sent the email quickly and tore off after the orderly, ignoring the sharp sting on his neck from the knife wound. He scrubbed down quickly and raced into the OR.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "I was arguing with my father," he said quietly. "They wanted to switch my schools, send me to some special private one for Omegas." He shook his head lightly. "It was in France, and I didn't want to go. I was lined up for Oxford, but because I wasn't of age, my parents would have the final say. Dad was driving; we were on our way to some stupid charity event for his work. I was yelling at him, he turned around to say something to me, and we hit a bit of ice, just enough to make the car drift from him not paying attention."
"Okay then," John whispered, kissing Sherlock again and combing through his hair. "Let's go back downstairs; I'm sure Katty wants to show off her new toys," he said, sliding off of Sherlock's lap and pulling him up with him. He wrapped him in another hug, nuzzling against his shoulder, before he drew away, leading him downstairs and back onto the sofa.
Sherlock looked up from where he was working in the kitchen when he heard the door open. He waited a minute, making sure to get rid of the last few pills he'd been using in his samples. He looked out over at John, lingering on the threshold between the kitchen and the living room.
Sherlock nodded, his nose buried in Katherine's hair as he carried her form the room, her limbs hanging limp, head on his shoulder. He took her upstairs to her bedroom, having to gently pry her fingers off of his coat and settling her in the bed. He reached over and tucked her little bear in with her.
Sherlock was confused when John got dressed, hearing his keys get taken up. He supposed he could have thought about it, but then he for once didn't really feel like thinking too much.
"Ignore your phone for a moment. How are you?" John asked, letting concern seep into his voice as he carefully looked Sherlock over.
John didn't like the trembling in his voice, the timid tone that he thought he had gotten rid of. He pulled Sherlock against his chest, holding onto him tightly and rocking him gently. "She's alright, she's fine. Molly's watching her, remember?" he murmured, pressing his lips against the top of Sherlock's head.
Sherlock's heart clenched when he saw John stir, and his eyes pulled open. He smiled a bit, a watery grin spreading on his face. He reached up and touched John's face, which was covered with a fine later of scruff. He nodded, rocking Hamish a little. "It is," he said, removing his hand from John‚Äôs face and stroking Hamish's cheek. The infant cooed, one of his small arms flailing out of his swaddle. "Just a minute," he murmured, walking down to the foot of John's bed and setting Hamish down as he undid his blanket, which had a swatch of John's pillow case sewn into it, courtesy of Mindy. He rubbed the infants belly to wake him up a little against the infant‚Äôs protests.
Katherine settled on her stomach, reaching out towards John, though her attention was soon being caught by a brightly coloured rattling toy a little bit away. She shoved her hand in her mouth, gumming it as she looked intently at the toy.
John's hands tightened around the gun and his hair. He pulled his knees up to his chest, breathing heavily and shaking forcefully. He sobbed, though no tears came, just a huge, solid ache in his chest. Tossing the gun to the floor, he wrapped his arms around his head and made himself as small as possible, part of him still feeling the heat of the desert, the bullet in his shoulder.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Sherl‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to take care of everything. Of you, I promised,‚Äù he said, lifting his wrist up to his mouth and biting down into it. ‚ÄúCome now brother, drink,‚Äù he urged the dying man he held in his lap, almost cradling him as he had when he‚Äôd been an infant.
‚ÄúYeah, good. Really good,‚Äù John replied. How many times would he sit here in the same office and continue to lie?
Sherlock sighed. "Mrs Hudson... I'll take care of that before the press. She deserves to know," he said. "And as for Harry, I can take her wrath I suppose," he said. "Did... did she and Clara ever try for that pup she talked about?" he asked.
Katherine hummed, then nodded gently. "Mhm..." she hummed softly, resting her hand on his arm, finger tracing the long line there. "Papa...got a bit cut...no more knife throwing," She said, tutting a little, it was something she'd picked up from Gran Hudson. "When you coming home?" she asked, tilting her head up slightly to look at him.
On his way back into the bedroom, John paused by the bathroom door. "Sherlock..." he sighed. "I know this isn't the best time, but eventually I have to take you down to NSY for a statement. A DI stopped by while you were in the hospital and got mine. I'd like to find him again."
John smiled, letting himself be happy. "Well it wasn't exactly... expected." He grinned sheepishly, walking over to where he remembered the tea being. Creative half-truths. "But I'm happy. I'm just worried about Sherlock."
‚ÄúWhat of you?‚Äù Sherlock asked plainly, as if such a thought had never occurred to him. It had of course. John‚Äôs scent was quite, alluring. But given the circumstances he found John in, he rather assumed John would want nothing to do with such things again. Then again, he had moved in with Sherlock, who was cut from the same cloth as the designers of John‚Äôs previous torture. John had actually been in that warehouse for almost two weeks.
Sherlock looked up at John, feeling him press against him. He nodded, wrapping his arms around John, clinging onto him. "Yes... please, I want you to. I... need it..." he breathed, pulling John's face up and looking at him. His pupils were blown wide, somewhat manic in his heat, but he looked intently at John before crushing his mouth against John's greedily.
She let out a loud wail, but as soon as John put his finger in her hand and Sherlock soothed her a little with bouncing and soft words, she settled down.
"If you're ready," Sherlock murmured, grateful to stand, he couldn't kneel for long these days. He rested his free hand on his stomach and let out a breath, the eggs and toast already well on their way to being gone. He gave John a small tug and led him from the cemetery. "We passed a caf√© on our way here, why don't we go there?" he asked quietly.
"Oh my god, pick up your damn phone, you arse." John left a message before hanging up and immediately calling again, beginning to get worried.
John chuckled low in his chest, running his fingers over the scar again. "God, you're so sensitive. You have no idea how much I love it," he said, nipping at the shell of Sherlock's ear.
John smiled, leaning over against Sherlock's side. "You're rather fond of her," he said softly, pressing a soft kiss to Sherlock's jaw. "I'm glad; she's a good influence." He ran his fingers softly down the side of Kat's face, watching her sleep.
John looked doubtfully at the box of China and then up at Sherlock. "I don't understand how this is supposed to help me," he admitted, his gaze flickering over to the smashed plate that Sherlock had thrown. "I don't have any anger to take out. Not that I'm aware of, anyway." He spun the plate between his palms, looking intently at the cracks that ran over its surface.
John laughed, helping her out. "Not quite, little one. Couple more months and I'm sure you'll be terrorising us," he teased softly, lifting her up in the air above his head and then bringing her back down to blow on her stomach. "Be patient with it."
Sherlock returned the pressure, keeping it there firmly. "Hard to say, looking like it might be a bladder infection, but the only way to tell for sure is to get a clean urine sample, hard pressed to get one seeing as we can't really wait for her to go, and her skin could contaminate the sample." She said, looking over at John and Sherlock. "I can do a quick procedure where I insert a catheter and take a sample, takes about a minute, though she won't be too much happier about it. It's not terribly comfortable."
John pushed off of the bed, walking over to the door and throwing it open, disappearing down the hall before Sherlock could stop him. He stopped just around the corner, ignoring the looks he was getting from worried nurses, and sank to the floor, his back pressed up against the wall, and pulled his knees up to his chest, sobbing heavily into them.
But then again, Sherlock couldn't help the somewhat nervous feeling as well. Share the bed with him ‚Äì he'd never done that, having always been kicked back to the Omega room where they were all kept after, but it was still somewhat nerve-wracking.
"Sherlock..." John looked down at his tea, unable to stop himself from thinking about the last time he and Sherlock had drank tea together. "Of course you're her daddy," he whispered, looking back up at Katherine and beckoning her forward until she was sitting between his legs. "So long as she's okay with it," he added, combing through Katherine's dark curls.
Sherlock looked back at John. "I don't want to be a disturbance, or a burden on you," he said quietly.
"Where?" he asked, feeling his heart sink. He'd get away, get out somehow and get rid of the monster. He looked towards the bedroom. John would never let him leave, though thankfully... he'd thought of that already.
"I know I need more sleep, and yeah, so do you. Unfortunately, I can get three hours a night on average, five when I'm lucky." John sighed, resting his chin on his palm and looking happily at Sherlock. "I just want to hold you, but I can't. You're seven and a half hours away, and I'm sitting in the middle of a desert." He paused, smiling at Sherlock through the camera. "You look good, though. Putting on a little weight, which is good."
Sherlock went to the bathroom, then ambled down the hall, seeing John by the window. "O-oh... I thought you'd be at work," he said softly. "Morning," he murmured.
"Here," he said when he entered the living room, shaking the bottle of anti-depressants at Sherlock. "I wanna make a deal with you.‚Äù
John laid like that for a few more hours before his stomach turned again, and he got up, walking into the bathroom and sinking down with enough time to spare for it before he got sick again.
give Sherlock what he needed, because that would be worse, and torturous for both of them. He sighed, rubbing his fingers down Sherlock's back and electing not to fall asleep this time, lest Sherlock wake up prematurely and need him again.
Sherlock had stopped playing when John was asleep, though he had waited a few minutes. He sat thinking then, watching John off and on. It was probably four hours later when John tore away from the sofa and dashed to the bathroom.
John held tightly to Katherine once Sherlock had left, drawing comfort from her and giving some back. He smiled at some of the things she talked to him about‚Äîher dolls, the eleventh Doctor, how she would play her violin for him tomorrow if they were feeling better. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my sweet, brave girl, Katty,‚Äù John whispered, kissing the top of her head and glancing up at Sherlock when he came into the room. ‚ÄúThank you, sweetheart.‚Äù
John‚Äôs side was starting to hurt again as he held Sherlock against the wall, but he didn't care. "You're not doing this alone. Partners, remember?"
John picked up his phone and sat down on the bed, quickly calling Harry and learning that their mother had gotten out of recovery for surgery already. She was awake, but tired. Being a doctor, he knew that she should rest, so he asked for Harry to hand the phone over and spent five minutes talking to his mum, expertly keeping the tears out of his voice.
Sherlock blinked a few times, looking at John still. He'd hoped that if John would tell anyone anything, it would be him. He looked down for a moment. "I see," he said. "Perfectly understandable," he added, moving towards the door when the car pulled to a stop. He got out, forcing himself to his feet on his own, standing outside the restaurant, waiting for John.
"That's just because she and I both have wrinkles," his mother said dismissively, making John chuckle.
"You mean this touching thing?" John mused, nuzzling against the Omega's neck and just breathing him in for a moment, one hand still carding through his hair, the other stroking down his arm.
"Sherlock?" John called, pushing open the door a little and seeing him in the tub. He smiled softly. "Morning," he murmured, still drowsy. "Mind if I join you?"
‚ÄúNo, no I‚Äôm right here,‚Äù He said, nodding once. ‚ÄúWhat did you want to know?‚Äù he asked. Ella tapped her pen once, adjusting herself in her seat marginally.
"Do you always stare off into empty space when you eat?" Sherlock asked, the sentence a little slowed as the painkiller kicked in more, but he wasn't as drowsy this time. "Don't blame you, but I thought I did that out of isolation and nothing better to do in an attempt to not be where I was," he mumbled, watching John unwrap his wrist.
Sherlock nodded again; damn John's perception. "I know that, I don't want to go anywhere, I'm not planning on it at any rate," he said, glancing up at John. "I just don't want you to slip away while either of us is still here," he said. He rested his head on John's shoulder still, only getting up when he heard a knock at the door.
Sherlock swallowed, wincing a small bit as he moved, some of the morphine wearing off as he slept, though he didn't wake up yet.
"Hey." John reached over, taking one of Sherlock's hands in his own and squeezing it tightly. "You're alright. We're both alright." He glanced over at Sherlock, his eyebrows knitting in worry. "Talk to me about it, please. Whatever's bothering you‚Ä¶ I want to know so that I can help."
John took the painkillers with a quick drink of water, eating a banana as well so that there would be something in his stomach to help the pills work. He wandered back into the living room after, lifting Katherine up and setting her on his lap as soon as he had sat down. "Oh, the Hobbit," John said with a smile, taking the book from her and smiling to himself. "Would you like me to read it to you, or do you want to try?" he asked quietly.
fight you over this, but I don't want to hurt our pup. Let him go, now," he commanded, his voice and scent resonating his dominant place as Alpha and protector, his teeth bared in case Sherlock forced him to bite.
Sherlock felt like he was being stabbed with each word John said. Finally he was carried away, and he was left alone in the morgue on a slab. Molly came forward then with a blanket and he deftly stripped from his blood-soaked clothes. He wrapped himself up in the blanket and locked himself in his (Molly's) lab, as a sob tore out of him. He howled, slamming himself against the cupboards and crying out.
John welcomed Sherlock back with a warm embrace, snuggling close to him and breathing in his scent. "We can get him a couple," he said quietly, pressing a few kisses to Sherlock's forehead, cheeks, and finally his lips. He let out a soft breath, his eyes closing as he relaxed against his mate. "I can't wait to get out tomorrow," he murmured, his breath shifting through Sherlock's hair. "I don't like being trapped inside. Feel like a caged animal."
"No, don't!" Sherlock said, trying to stop Jim but it was too late. His eyes widened when he saw the pool of blood forming around the man's head, his eyes open and an almost smug look on his face. "No... No, you've ruined everything!" he shouted at him, kicking his leg once before composing himself again.
John lifted his eyebrows, but he didn't say anything, standing from the bed and walking around. By the time he reached the other side, Sherlock had moved, and he was able to crawl in, facing him. "I miss seeing you when we sleep," he murmured, combing through Sherlock's hair.
He had since moved in with Sherlock and their relationship was one that others might find, abnormal. Two bachelors of their age, or rather Sherlock‚Äôs supposed age. John seemed to show little interest in pursuing outside‚Ä¶interests. But really, not having him come home smelling of perfume was quite nice.
John rolled his eyes playfully and chuckled. "I supposed I could. Not that I mind, but you've been doing really well on your own," he said, running his toes up the inside of Sherlock's thigh under the table. "I'm going to have to do some stretches before we leave, but as soon as I'm dressed we can head out," he said, reaching for some more French toast.
"I think you're a bit more perfect than I am," John murmured, kissing his cheek and reaching up to card his fingers through Sherlock's hair, massaging his fingers against his scalp.
"Oh, love," John said softly, cupping Sherlock's face in his hands and kissing his forehead and then his lips. "She's coming, I promise. Just a few more months and then she'll be out, and your back won't hurt anymore and you won't be eating so much and we can both relax a little."
"You know, I almost got skin tags," John mused, staring at his name on the thin metal. "Couple of my buddies wanted to, and I was going with them, but I stopped on the way there and changed my mind."
John held Sherlock tighter, his hand pressed protectively over his stomach. "No," he said firmly. "Absolutely not. Sherlock, why would you...?" He sighed, dropping his forehead to Sherlock's shoulder. "You're keeping him.¬†We're¬†keeping him. Alright?"
"But nothing did happen, right? We got back fine, we're both safe." He tucked Sherlock's head under his chin, gently rubbing his back and running his fingers along his arm. He rocked them both softly, closing his eyes. "Nothing's going to happen, alright? They would be stupid going after you. You have a brother who keeps track of you twenty-four seven, a brother-in-law who is a DI at NSY, and a bondmate who just came back from the war and doesn't blink at shooting people."
John stirred, hearing a soft voice but not exactly what had been said, and then there were footsteps and a door opened and closed again. Yawning, he stretched his arms behind Sherlock and pulled him closer, nuzzling against his next and the mark that was there. "Morning," he whispered, kissing a line up to Sherlock's ear. "Feeling alright?" he asked, breathing in his scent, which seemed more... solid this morning. Less wavering and unsure.
Sherlock blinked a few times, eyes moving up but not seeing the snipers, probably cleared out with their master. His heart was hammering in his chest and he stood there, stunned for a moment before he looked down, seeing the hole in his coat and the red staining it. He fell to the floor when John tugged on him, his knees giving out. He blinked, feeling warmth move down his front and back ‚Äì through and through, then. "Mm... my coat..." was all he could think to say, not able to think much else.
"Shut up, Sherlock," John growled, nipping at Sherlock's shoulder. He wrapped his arm around Sherlock, splaying his hand over his chest and holding him back against him. His other hand wound into his hair, gently combing through it. He felt like hell, but he didn't care. Hormones were designed for this. His body could produce chemicals to keep him alive for a few days, if need be. Thankfully, need not be, but still. "I'm fine, and you need me, so just deal with the fact that I'm not leaving."
John looked down at his marked and marred body, knowing that he still bore the weight of every one of those injuries, but Sherlock made him better. Sherlock was his medicine, always. He growled possessively, burying his face in the crook of Sherlock's neck so that he could breathe him in, reaching between them so that he could line up his cock with Sherlock's entrance. "Ready, love?" he asked, slowly pushing in until he was seated all the way. He groaned at the feeling of
John was a bit stunned by the quick movement his body was put through when Sherlock all but shoved him back into the car. "Take it easy," he whispered, relieved to see Sherlock alive and not shot or taken from him. "I'm here, we're fine," he murmured, wincing at pressure on his shoulder and shifting until it went away. "I love you." He felt that he had to say it, now that he had the chance. "And I am going to
John kept dabbing with the alcohol, then poured peroxide over both marks, wiping off the bubbles that formed and using a cotton ball to apply the iodine. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock's cheek, setting gauze and then a bandage over each mark before packing away his things. "Alright, you can sleep," he said, stepping away with the first aid kit.
John parted his lips, accepting the chip from Sherlock, not willing to admit how hungry he was. "Good, I'm glad," he said, once he had finished chewing. He poked Sherlock gently in the side, leaning against him a little more.
Sherlock let out a breath. "He won't find anything, or the chances of him finding anything are unlikely. He was never found to be in charge of the auction house, or any of the other ones that have been shut down since with the new laws. Which means that whoever he is, it's more than just auction houses he's involved with. And people are afraid to pin him, which means he's dangerous," Sherlock said, swallowing thickly.
Sherlock hummed lightly, watching John get out of bed. He was riding on the coattails of his heat, and it pained him to see John leave, quickly climbing out of bed and walking stiffly out of the door and into the kitchen after John, his gait a bit off, feeling bruised and sore. "Sounds like something I would say." he murmured, "I am sorry...still don't remember." he said quietly.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in pain,‚Äù Sherlock noted, looking at the man, who was too weak to stand, leaning heavily against the wall that he had been chained to not moments before. ‚ÄúI can help that‚Ä¶heal the wounds from where he bit you. Though, you may find the process‚Ä¶ distasteful.‚Äù
He sighed, smiling softly. "This far out...we'll be able to see the city's fireworks nicely on New Years in a few days." he said quietly. "Tomorrow maybe we can go and...walk outside in the snow." he said, trying to take John's mind off everything.
Sherlock smiled, sitting on the end of the table next to, rather than across from, John. "Well, there are other ways if you're still having trouble, I do still have some connections," he said quietly with a smirk. "You can bake it into food if you don't like to smoke," he said with a shrug, snatching up a spring roll and humming as he bit into it.
"Water..." Sherlock mumbled, shuffling into the bathroom and drinking three glasses before moving back into the bedroom. He climbed under the top sheet, not feeling as warm this time, covering himself half way.
Sherlock picked up Katherine, carrying her into the living room where John had set up a swing for her ages ago. He set her into it, buckling her in and turned it on low. He moved over and grabbed his violin, looking down at Katherine before flipping over his sheet music and starting to play the lullaby he'd written.
As soon as they pulled up at the hospital, John tossed a tenner at the cabbie and got out, taking Sherlock's hand and leading him into the waiting room. He caught sight of Harry immediately, both pups sitting in her lap, and he trotted over to her, letting go of Sherlock so that the Omega could get to their pups first, relieving Harry to come talk to John.
Sherlock hummed. "Well, soon enough we'll get to the point when we don't go to sleep the same time as our four-year-old," Sherlock said. "And perhaps stay up late talking...among other things." He closed his eyes, a soft smile resting on his mouth as he allowed himself to relax some more. "Mmm...my heats wills start again soon...Hamish is almost four months old..." he mumbled, dozing off finally.
John glanced at Sherlock for a moment before walking over to the dresser and pulling out a pair of Sherlock's pyjamas, tossing them at him. "I still have all of your clothes," he said softly as he undressed, pulling on his own pyjamas.
"Christ," John panted, dropping to his elbows and resting his forehead against Sherlock's chest. He side ached after that, and each of his deep breaths didn't help, but he didn't mind too much at the moment.
Sherlock smiled, turning a little in the water and looking up at John. "Then don't fall asleep," he said, leaning up to press a kiss to John's jaw.
Sherlock still felt horrible for having to need to tell John. He let out a breath. ‚ÄúYeah... you should," he said quietly. He wondered if John would even want him there.
Harry wrapped her arms around John, holding him carefully. "Sherlock will likely categorize everything for you, tell you the changes as they happen, hell he'd probably predict them," she said, rocking him gently. "That baby will love you, and nothing is going to go wrong because we will be here to make sure that Sherlock and them is taken care of," she said, "And finally, don't you dare even think that John, or so help me I will kill you myself," she said, voice stern.
"She's always been like that. Just... really good at reading people." John took Sherlock's hand, studying the bumps of his knuckles and the blue veins under his skin. "You're pretty good at reading me," he mused quietly, glancing up at Sherlock for a moment before looking away again.
‚ÄúI have given you my blood already, such a thing is significant. We did so at the warehouse as it was a matter of necessity and reparations. They only received a drop, you were given slightly more. But we can tell which humans have had our blood, and we can make a point not to feed from these humans to avoid forming any kind of bond.‚Äù
"I hurt like hell," John admitted honestly, ducking his hell a little sheepishly. He smiled at the mention of a shower, though, nodding as well. "God, yes. That sounds like a wonderful idea," he agreed, kissing Sherlock one more time before slowly sitting up with a small groan.
John thought about that comment for a moment, still affected by the sedation agent. "Well, he didn't. I'm fine. But you... how are you?" he asked, combing his fingers through Sherlock's hair, pulling him closer, his scent finally filtering to him.
"You've picked something you're good at. And like," Sherlock murmured. He nodded to John‚Äôs words,¬†more sleep sounding nice.
Sherlock let out a breath, leaning into John's hand lightly as he nodded. "I know," he said softly. "I do... I guess it's me I don't trust," he said. He shook his head a little. "God, ignore that... just the‚Ä¶ whatever, hormones or some bollocks like that," he said with a small huff, furrowing his brow a little. "Let's just get this over with, and then go see your mother so she can predict all of it," he said.
Sherlock sighed, looking at John. "You know, you're the most comfortable place I have for thinking, and you having to get up isn't helping," he said, narrowing his eyes playfully. He got up, and stretched dramatically. "Just make sure you go to the bathroom as well, can't have you getting up right away when the tea goes through you," he teased.
John chuckled softly, closing his eyes as he held the two most important boys in his life. All he needed now was Katherine lying across his legs and his life would be complete. "She'll probably look stellar," he murmured, wanting to roll over and snuggle closer to Sherlock, but he couldn't because he was holding Hamish. "If you're really not going to go to sleep, then maybe I should. One of us has to," he said quietly, though he knew that if he moved, Hamish would wake up.
John shrugged on his coat, watching as Sherlock did the same, and then took the lead down the stairs.
"Not too horrible a way to spend your birthday?" he asked, taking Katherine when John offered her, leading her to his chest, which she latched onto quickly.
John took Sherlock's hand after shrugging on his jacket and led him downstairs, locking up behind them as he stepped onto the pavement. Had it just been him going, he would have walked to the flower shop and then to the graveyard and taken a taxi home. With Sherlock beside him, he didn't hesitate to hail a cab right away. He held the door for Sherlock and slid in after him, giving the address to the cabbie and rubbing his leg a little, sitting straight-backed in the seat.
Perhaps it was Mycroft, or perhaps the hospital just knew better by now, but they had put John in a double room, the other bed empty. He carried Katherine in and tucked her into the other bed. He would wake her up to see John in a little bit, but he wanted to see John first, gauge how he was.
Sherlock let John lead him down the street a little as John hailed a cab, Sherlock's eyes going over everything and everyone, people passing in the street looking at him with peculiar expressions. He realised of course it was probably because he was pale, thin, bruised, and wearing slippers. He slid into the cab when it pulled up, settling onto the seat, and leaning to look out the window.
Katherine looked over towards the papers. "You get a house too Daddy?" she asked, still arranging hers, surrounded in a small nest of wrapping paper.
It wasn‚Äôt the type of silence Sherlock ever pictured being one he would be comfortable with, being so still as well. And yet, this was almost better than any case‚Ä¶any chase. Finally, the dust had settled around their lives and they could just be without one of them having to disappear, disrupt their lives and the lives of their children.
Sherlock winced, letting out a breath. "N-no," he said, voice faltering slightly. "No I don't." He hadn't mentioned Katherine... was there a chance he didn't know? He supposed that was good. "If I go... you'll leave him alone? Leave everyone alone?" he asked.
‚ÄúA wound, yes. Because I fixed that. You can continue lying to yourself but it will never sit properly with you because you know better. You know that I‚Äôm telling you the truth. Because I‚Äôd wager it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs felt proper to you since you died.‚Äù John blinked a few times, looking at the other. How could have possibly known that?
John smiled back, lifting his hand to cup Sherlock's cheek. He swiftly leant over to give him a kiss before the light changed and they were moving again. He turned on the radio at some point, listening to the music in the background as they drove out of town, keeping the speed minimal on the snow-covered roads.
Katherine smiled, leaning up to press a kiss to John‚Äôs cheek then nodded, snuggling down into her blankets and taking her bear, making sure that John kissed him also. She rolled over, sighing a little as she shut her eyes. John smiled, walking quietly from the room and closing the door behind him. He trotted back downstairs, getting a quick drink of water from the kitchen before walking into the bedroom.
"Doesn't appear to be an ear infection," she murmured. "And as for it popping up, she's quiet. Only letting you know when something was really wrong, probably was just quiet about it. One of the downsides of a soft spoken infant," she murmured.
"This was what I had, kept it with me all the time. Looked at it every day," he said quietly, easing himself onto the bed with a sigh.
"‚Äôm not sure I can," Sherlock mumbled after a couple minutes, though despite his words, his eyes closed and he was asleep again within another few minutes, snoring softly.
Sherlock remembered quickly and took John's phone, putting his old email into it. He shoved it back into John's pocket and stole up John's lips for a chaste kiss, afraid to do more; he'd never let John leave otherwise.
Oh, sweetheart, I miss you too. When you read your stories at night, I want you to imagine that I'm reading them, alright? I loved your picture. That was a really big and pretty sand castle. Keep being good for Daddy, alright? Love you.
John reached out and wiped the bit of syrup from Katherine's chin, smiling at her. "Of course, she is," he promised, though he had no idea. But he knew that his mother could be dying, and he would still lie to Kat and promise her that everything would be fine. "I just want to check up on her and Harry both, make sure that your Auntie is sleeping and eating and everything."
Sherlock turned his head to look at John as the Alpha walked past, looking exhausted. He finished the piece, and then moved into the kitchen, grabbing a banana and walking into the bedroom. He perched on the bed, reading the day‚Äôs work on John, and kept counting down to when he would be gone.
John nearly sobbed, clutching Sherlock close to him--maybe his nails were digging into his back, he wasn't sure. He didn't answer with words, instead pressing his teeth to the outline of the mark. That was his promise--that he would come back, that they would still get married.
, John thought, but he didn't say it. He had been hoping that he would be able to convince Sherlock to not take the pills, that they would be able to go through a heat without them and have another go at a pup, and so he had brought a test along just in case. But he didn't want to mention it, because Sherlock wanted to let it go. "Alright," he said softly, holding Sherlock closer and rubbing his back.
John laughed again, lifting his hand for a cab, sighing as two drove by and he had to try again. "Well I can tell you that it has nothing to do with sentiment. It's purely... selfish..." He didn't want to say too much unless he gave it away. To be honest, he was slightly embarrassed about it, and that said a lot. He didn't get embarrassed easily. But this was personal, and he didn't deal well with his own personal things. "You're hint is that it has to do with something for you to wear... but it's not clothing. And I'm not giving you another hint."
Sherlock let out a shaky breath, trembling slightly as he laid down, resting his head in John's lap, and curling close to him. The towel loosened and slid off him, and he was lying on it, curled up on his side.
He‚Äôd just turned thirty-six, and he would stay thirty-six forever now it seemed. It wasn't something he thought about often, though each time his brother insisted on associating with him, reminded him of it, for it had been his brother who had killed him.
"I don't know, Sherlock," John murmured, nuzzling against the back of his neck, hoping that his scent would calm him down some. It helped, a little. "I really, really don't know." He sighed, resting his forehead above the fresh mark. "I want you to stop worrying about me and what happened so much. I'm a soldier. We carry on. It's just... it's what we do. A week of ordered bed rest is going to be more like two or three days. I'm fine, you need to stop fretting so much."
‚ÄúNotes here say that the animal bites are post-mortem,‚Äù John said, reading over the file. ‚ÄúThey said he drowned though, fish wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to him that quickly. I doubted they even checked the lungs for water.‚Äù
"Only if you keep eating," Sherlock suddenly countered. "Twice a day at least, or I will just take it," he said, knowing he didn't want to take it, and that he wasn't being fair to either of them. Sherlock didn't like not being able to smell John's scent... everyone else's he could do without, but John's... still, he would sacrifice that if it meant John got better.
Sherlock swallowed, reaching one hand up and holding onto John's that was over his heart. "Okay," he said quietly, not saying that he didn't see himself wanting to leave. He let out a breath, the painkiller kicking in as he started to relax more, head going fuzzy.
"Good," he said, his voice sharp, military. "Give him the phone and tell him it's me, and if he doesn't answer, I'm leaving."
Sherlock sighed, nodding gently. He reached up his hand and covered one of John's on his chest, tracing lines onto the back of it with his fingers.
Sherlock hummed lightly, returning the kiss lazily and allowing his face to be cradled in John's hands. "Mm love you too," he murmured against John's lips, letting out a breath. He dragged his eyes open to look at John, lifting one hand up to trace his features. He shivered a little, a small bit cold, but he didn't mind in the least.
He walked along streets and down alleys that he knew contained rarely checked CCTV cameras, trying to draw attention to himself and still remain hidden from Mycroft's eyes. It was quite a lot more challenging than he had thought, but eventually, nearing an hour later, his phone started vibrating with a text. An address. He walked back to the main rode, immediately catching a cab and giving off the new location.
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you the night that we landed. I was immediately sent off to the hospital to organise my office and my station. I met a few of the nurses -- there are actually some male nurses this time, which is interesting, but not exactly new to me. I'm not bunking with anyone, because I'm a Captain, and yesterday I met my team. They're all nice. Three women this time 'round. They issued me a new gun, so I can give you my old one when you're old enough, Katty. But shh, don't tell anyone. It has to be our secret. This one's a SIG Sauer, and it's a much nicer gun, if I do say so. They seemed to remember my needs, and it's formulated to me again. I really don't have anything else to say. I'm safe. It's really boring right now. And hot. Dear god, I forgot how hot it gets.
John froze again, holding up his free hand and backing up at the desperation in Sherlock's voice. "Leave a note when?" he asked, and he couldn't help his voice breaking, because he knew. He wasn't stupid, he knew what was coming. "Sherlock..."
Sherlock stood, nudging off his shoes and climbing into the hospital bed. He was on his left side, facing John, John curled on his right since his left shoulder was his bad one. "Wherever you need me." he said, not sure if John wanted to spoon or if he should just curl up into his chest, so he waited, going at John's pace.
John clenched his fists, ducking his head. "I can't, Molly," he whispered, his eyes fixed on the street below him where Sherlock had died two years ago. "I can't do this without him anymore." He swallowed, closing the distance between himself and the ledge. "Katherine..." his voice broke, thinking about his daughter who, every day, reminded him of the mate he had lost.
"Come join me, then, and it won't be such a one-sided ordeal," John said before he could really comprehend the words. But he didn't take them back, just stepped back under the water, leaving the curtain open.
Sherlock hopped up on the stage, standing in the spot he had a year ago, looking out to where John had been. He let out a slow breath, waiting.
John chuckled quietly. "Eight pounds, love. That's the ideal." He chuckled, pressing light kisses to Sherlock's eyelids. "I've got brown around the pupils, and you have just..." he sighed. "Yours are gorgeous."
Sherlock shook his head. "Mm can't thank you enough for this John‚Ä¶. this was..." he was at a loss of words. He'd been alone for it for years, and it had been torture, but this... was perfect.
Sherlock tugged his phone out of his pocket, having silenced it to let John sleep. There were several messages from Mycroft, saying that CCTV couldn't pick up who the Alpha was; they couldn't get his face.
John squeezed his hand, stepping up to the counter and requesting his prescription. The nurse went to look for it and returned a few moments later, handing it over and waving them goodbye. John followed Sherlock from the hospital, leaning on him a bit as they stepped onto the pavement.
Sherlock looked over at John, seeing him with his bag and he felt like his heart stopped. "And wouldn't the country just fall if we did." he muttered, walking into the living room and helping Katherine into a light coat. With her jumper and the somewhat warmer weather, she would be fine. He sighed, forcing himself to take the stairs and wait on the pavement as John hailed a cab, trying to keep himself under control. He was failing in one respect it seemed, without his knowledge, for a minute later Katherine blinked, looking at him.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment before he nodded. "I'm fine, John," he said, mentally creating a closet in his mind palace, as far away from John as he could, wanting to keep that separated from his wing. He let out a breath, looking at him steadily. "Tell me however much you need to," he said quietly. "Don't carry it all for yourself."
John hummed, winding his fingers in Sherlock's hair to deepen the kiss, not thinking it to be a bad idea at all. Finally, he did pull back though, with a last nip to Sherlock's lip. "Alright," he said dejectedly. "We can leave."
John followed a bit behind, wishing that he could take some of the ache away from Sherlock, but he knew he had to do this. He watched Sherlock carefully, stepping up with a hand on his back to steady him as they walked over the grass and turned down a row of headstones.
That wasn't fair! Sherlock whined, frustrated, and suddenly angry, weakly kicking out at John. "Supposed to help!" he complained loudly. "Supposed to... to make it go away!" he said, trying to wriggle out of John's arms. "Thirsty," he tried, which he was, his mouth dry. He swallowed thickly, still working tiredly at pulling away.
John smiled at the picture that he had saved on his laptop, running his fingers over Kat's and Hamish's faces as they loaded him onto the jet that would take him back to London. It was one of Mycroft's jets, naturally. "You have lovely children," one of the on-flight nurses comment. "Thank you," John smiled, shutting down his computer as the jet doors were closed. "Am I going to be on oxygen the whole way?" he asked, and was rewarded with a smile and a nod. John gave a small sigh of relief, lifting his head a little for the thin tube and then sitting still as she adjusted the little nubs so that they were by his nose. "Just relax, and we'll be landing in seven and a half hours," she assured him.
He sighed, plucking a little at his violin. He picked at the patch on his arm, noting the bruising and scars in the crooks of his arms. He sighed, reclining on the sofa.
"No, it's not too horrible," John murmured, leaning forward to kiss Sherlock's forehead. He looked down at Katherine, smiling softly at Sherlock holding her.
John shook his head, but no words came out. This wasn't how it was supposed to go. He wasn't supposed to be drafted, he wasn't supposed to be leaving his growing family. He was already packed, ready to just pick up the small bag of items he was allowed, and go on his way in the morning. But he didn't want to do that. He wanted to hide in the cupboard and never come out. "Come lay with me," he said quietly, pulling back and standing from the couch, tugging Sherlock up with him.
"I don't like how you look in a tie," John said, taking his hand from both Sherlock and Katherine and knocking on the door. A few short moments later, his mum opened the door.
Jim laughed, ducking behind a doorway before Sherlock had got a proper shot off. He waved teasingly and then calmly went on his way, knowing he had plans to make now.
"It's okay, you're okay... we're okay," Sherlock said, not sure what else to say. He didn't feel okay... but he would, they both would. He looked at John, holding his head in his hands. "The sooner you leave, the sooner you're back," he said. "Like taking off a bandage. It'll be fine, John, because you're a brilliant doctor. You knew what was wrong with me right off the bat because you've got an instinct for it. And it will save lives, and keep you alive. Do you hear me?" he asked sternly, meeting John's gaze.
Sherlock nodded, letting out a breath. "Okay,‚Äù he said quietly. "And I think most would call it some kind of territorial display. Common among some Alphas, as well as other species." he said quietly, rubbing his nose a little.
John let out a breath, sipping his tea when it was still scalding. "I hope nothing happened to him that Katherine didn't see," he murmured, reaching out his had to take one of Hamish's hands between his fingers. He sighed a little, taking another sip and humming to himself. "I know you can see that they're gone," he said quietly, referring to his tags. "So why don't you ask about it? I know you notice a lot more than you mention. Why?"
Sherlock sighed, blinking his eyes open a little to see John awake. He blinked a few times, his eyes moving to John's shoulder, and the pink starburst shaped scar there.
John let out a small breath, nodding slowly and easing his finger out of Hamish's grasp so that he could relax his hand. "I'm going to be really pissed off if this is all a dream," he teased, closing his eyes as he settled a little more against Sherlock and closed his eyes, steadying his breathing. Sherlock had said that the man was gone, but John wasn't so sure. The last through his mind before he fell asleep was the man's final words to him.¬†I'm not done with you yet.
John turned back to look at Sherlock as a cab pulled up, noticing his hand on his stomach. "Everything alright?"
"He came into the hospital while you were sleeping and got really mad when I defended you. He told me about what happened ‚Äì briefly, and I doubt it was on purpose. He said he's been trying to find you and get you since you were taken." John looked down at his lap before glancing back up at Sherlock. "I'm actually surprised you didn't smell him on me when you woke up. He has a very particular scent."
‚ÄúYes, and you are not only my brother, but I am your Sire. It is expected that you take part.‚Äù Sherlock rolled his eyes again. ‚ÄúAs I was saying, as prominent members, we must be present in enforcing of the new laws. We take human companions, yes. But the time of simply
"‚Äôm sorry... bought a half dead Omega... boss don't do refunds," Sherlock said, eyes rolling around a little in their sockets. He swallowed, looking around the room and then up at the IV bags that he was connected to.
‚ÄúWell, you can assume I‚Äôm a nutter, which I am not and just figure that since I helped you that I can‚Äôt be
John looked down at Katherine's soft curls and smiled a little. He sighed, lifting his gaze and staring out of the window. "I don't really know," he answered truthfully. "Nothing specific. It just looked like the desert had been dumped into the living room. And..." he shook his head, bouncing Kat gently on his thigh, his hands steadying and supporting her.
"What... what do you need?" Sherlock asked, tilting his head to expose his neck a little more for him.
"Last time...you were drugged, it made you see it when you were awake I...you were afraid of hurting me, or Katherine," he said, then looked down. "And that time...I almost thought you would," he said, not particularly fond of the memory. But that hadn't been John at the time.
"Sherlock... what did they do to you?" John asked quietly, afraid of the answer and afraid that he was going to go down there and kill every single one of them. "And I don't care if you're broken. I like you." He smiled, squeezing Sherlock's hand and bringing it up to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "I just want to make it better."
John chuckled, making Katherine squeal happily from how quickly she moved up and down. "You would know," he said, freeing up one of his hands momentarily to reach out for Sherlock's fingers. He hummed quietly, "I love you."
Sherlock looked at John, watching him carefully. He stayed there for a while, carefully climbing out of bed and wrapping a dressing gown around him. He walked carefully down the hall and into the kitchen, grabbing some fruit from the fridge, supposing that John had stocked the place prior to them going. He called Mindy, talking to Katherine as it was still early evening. He coughed a few more times, taking a bit of medicine to try and push away the cold before it sank in. He finally crawled back into bed, draping a blanket over the two of them as he settled again, nose slightly stuffed, falling asleep quickly.
John rolled his eyes. "Oh, no reason at all. Nothing to do with your prior history with authority figures." He waved his hand sarcastically, arching an eyebrow down at Sherlock.
. And that's not to say I don't, but what if something happens? If not before it's born then after. And if it does, it will be my fault!" he snapped.
"So, do we even bother telling your mother or just see if she figures it out?" Sherlock asked, feeling significantly more at ease not that they'd left that place. "Might be more fun, and I'm honestly curios to see if she does."
"Yes, I used to," Sherlock murmured. "I had just finished school actually, was aiming to start uni early, like Mycroft," he said.
"It'll go away soon enough, Katherine," he said quietly. "Stomach flu goes by much faster than a cold, even if it does seem worse," he said gently.
John didn't say anything except to direct the cabbie to New Scotland Yard as he slid into the cab. He reached over, settling his hand on Sherlock's knee, just holding it there as they started down the road. He squeezed reassuringly, looking out of the windscreen for a moment before letting him go and turning to look out his own window, folding his hands on his lap.
As soon as John passed through the doors, he froze. Nothing looked quite right. It still looked like the living room... sort of... but it mostly looked like the desert, and when he angled his head just right, it looked just like a house where he had killed two men. "Sh-Sherlock..." he called, holding Kat tighter against him, not sure he could trust what his eyes were seeing.
With that he stopped messaging, then dialled John's number. It started to ring, and he was both hoping, and dreading that someone would pick up.
Sherlock stopped moving his hand, seeing the scar he was near. He made a mental note and avoided it. "I'll want it's story someday." he said, "All of them I'll want all..." He trailed off, another cramp hitting him but he let out a breath, trying to ignore it. It was followed by what he couldn't ignore though, and he pressed an insistent kiss to John's lips, pleading with him almost.
John shook his head, instantly collecting himself in the face of his mate. He let out a harsh breath as Sherlock reached over to turn off the water of the shower. ‚ÄúI called Harry. She was a mess. M‚Ä¶.Mum started hemorrhaging internally sometime during the night. She‚Äôs back in surgery, I don‚Äôt‚Äô know how much more blood she can lose before she dies,‚Äù he said, his voice breaking slightly as he closed his eyes, fighting off the tears trying to well up.
"Yeah, we can walk. My rib isn't complaining too much," he said with a smile, nudging Sherlock's side, inadvertently pushing him off balance for a moment.
Sherlock let out a shuddering breath, leaning his head over to John's neck and inhaling. He moaned a little, unwrapping his arms from himself and winding them around John. He whimpered a little, running his nose along John's jaw, stealing up his lips for a kiss, pressing firmly to his mouth.
"You need to be here for at least today, I think. I'm not entirely sure; it's up to the doctor." John shrugged, running his fingertips along the inside of the Omega's wrist.
John blinked a few times, his head finally starting to clear. "Sherlock, it's fine. Leave it for a moment and come here," he asked, a tremble in his voice. He stood from the chair with some effort, walking out into the living room.
They stepped outside and started down the sidewalk, Sherlock glancing around the whole time. "I know it's a short walk, but we could... take a cab... if you want," he said.
John stayed up longer, just staring at the wall and listening to Sherlock breathe before he eventually fell asleep as well.
Lucian ran at him before he had got through his wrists. John braced himself, kicking out with both feet as soon as Lucian got close enough. The man reacted too fast, grabbing John's ankles and yanking, pulling him forward and off-balance, causing the knife to cut into his arm and his head to hit the edge of the vanity as he went crashing to the floor.
John set his hand on Sherlock's thigh, running his thumb over his leg lightly. "Not sure if he gets bored or not, but he worries about you, and to him it's most likely worth it." He squeezed Sherlock's leg a little, smiling over at him and then people watching.
John smiled softly to himself, reaching out to stroke his fingers through Sherlock's hair. With a soft sigh, he closed his eyes. They all needed sleep, apparently, even if it was in the middle of the day. Humming lightly to himself, he drifted off, his hand now resting on Sherlock's hip.
John slipped his bomber jacket back on, grabbing up his wallet and keys again before leading the way down the stairs. "Any place you want to go that you used to shop at? Or are you following my lead?"
"I know," John sighed, running his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "God, I know." He blew out a breath, rolling himself and Sherlock onto their sides so that he could see Sherlock better. "Would you like me to go?" he asked quietly, cupping Sherlock's cheek gently.
"Hey," John whispered, noticing the emotions flitting across Sherlock's face. "Look at me, love." He cupped Sherlock's cheek, stroking his cheekbone gently with his thumb. "Your pace, alright?" He leant down to kiss Sherlock cautiously, keeping his movements slow. He ran his fingers over Sherlock's side, appreciating the lean muscle he found there.
"It's him. It has to be, he's trying to get under our skin, trying to get to me through you," he said, rolling out of bed and picking up the gun. "The safety is off, it's loaded, and you had it whipped out. You never did that with your regular nightmares, John, never," he said, putting the safety on and discharging the clip. "I'm going to put this away," he said, moving quickly into the living room and tucking the gun away safely. He moved back into the bedroom, sitting on the bed again.
John grinned broadly, engulfing Sherlock's mouth in a heady kiss. "You're damn right I am. Have to best you somewhere, don't I?" he teased, starting his gentle applications of pressure points again until he felt that Sherlock was calm enough.
Sherlock watched the embrace, thinking again to his first heat; that had been the last time he'd really been close to his own mother.
John grinned, looking up at Katherine as he handed the first piece of toast over to Sherlock, giving him a look that told him to eat it with no complaints. "That's amazing, Katty," he said proudly. "I'm sure you'll be able to play just like Daddy once you have enough practice. You're already so good." He spread jam on another piece of toast and took a bite, savouring the flavour. No more desert food, no more hospital food.
"I know," John murmured, understanding what Sherlock was doing. He held him tighter, burying his face in his hair.
Sherlock sighed, muttering something about transport and something else that boiled down to something along the lines of mind over matter. He was completely relaxed against John, though, and he started to doze off, despite the mess that was pressed between them. He hummed lightly, his mouth slightly open as his breathing evened out.
"Christ," John whispered shakily, holding Sherlock tightly against him as he moved them onto their sides, spooning up behind Sherlock.
Sherlock had a thought, then, and got up, crossing the room to grab his violin and drape himself over his chair. He very softly started to play John's tune, a little slower than normal as well, closing his own eyes as he did so.
Sherlock settled onto John's lap, sighing a little. "And yet I know that it is. Had he had his full attention, the car wouldn't have drifted those few precious degrees," he said, looking down. "What's done is done, though," he said quietly, glancing towards the window. "It's going to be cold tonight; I need to get this cleaned up and boards over the window," he said, trying to get to his feet.
Sherlock searched his mind palace for an answer, but he knew he would find none. "American...the only American's I ever pissed off were some CIA, and that was...a misunderstanding," he said, confused. "I felt for sure that...that it had to do with me, that it was my fault somehow, that you ended up like this," he said quietly, letting out a breath. It wasn't then...he sighed. "The good thing is that you can put it behind you, and we can move on. He's gone now." He sighed, nuzzling against John's hair a bit. "You should rest some...before Katherine comes," he said quietly. "I won't go anywhere, I promise."
Sherlock smiled as soon as John opened his eyes. "I'm fine... Katherine's fine... you're going to be fine too," he said quietly, touching John's hair lightly. He let out a breath, squeezing John's hand. "You were sick, the flu and... the vomiting ruptured a couple ulcers... and then they found more, and removed them," he said quietly, looking down at John's torso.
John be in control. "Yeah, definitely need to make time," he said, pulling Sherlock's hip down quickly as he thrust up to meet him.
"You're cocky and arrogant," John said, chuckling as he traced the outline of Sherlock's tattoo and brand with the tips of his fingers before he leaned forward to kiss it gently. "We're both marked from war, aren't we?" he asked quietly, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and holding onto him tightly. "Wish we had some semblance of a normal life."
So John just pulled the Omega fully onto his lap and turned back so that he could lean against the wall, his hand idly stroking through Sherlock's hair as the boy stayed buried away.
Sherlock relished the hands in his hair, nearly purring, ignoring the fact that this was the last time for more than a year that this would happen really. He rinsed his hair, wincing as the water ran down the fresh bite on his neck, which he could tell was already starting to bruise. He washed himself off, helping to lather up John as well. Eventually they were both clean but they continued to stand there in the shower, Sherlock's arms snaking around John's waist.¬†John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's shoulders, nuzzling against his shoulder. He didn't want to ruin the moment by talking, so he stayed silent, just listening to the water and feeling Sherlock beside him.
"You don't remember? Sherlock, you were burning," John said, concern evident in his voice. He rested his palm against Sherlock's forehead to take his temperature again, and he was much cooler than earlier. "You scared the hell out of me," he whispered, wrapping his arms tightly around Sherlock's waist and holding him close.
John moaned, nuzzling against the back of Sherlock's neck. "I know, I know," he breathed, instantly starting to thrust his hips forward. There was no semblance of a rhythm ‚Äì he couldn't feel any pain, but he was still injured ‚Äì but that somehow made it better. Everything was unpredictable, and the noises Sherlock was making were delicious, pushing him into a faster pace.
John stood up, walking over to Sherlock and wrapping his arms around his waist. He rose up on his tiptoes, licking a little at the bite on his neck, Sherlock's thickening scent getting to him already. "No one's mad at you, or blaming you for anything," he murmured, slowly taking Sherlock's coat off of him and tossing it onto the chair. "Come on. They're being taken care of. Let me take care of you."
Sherlock coughed a couple times, dragging his distant eyes up to meet John's. He swallowed, mumbling a little incoherently, shaking his head a small bit, wondering just what John thought it was.
‚ÄúI love you both so much... and I always will. Goodbye, John," he said, dropping his phone and angling himself as he pitched himself off the building just as the biker ran into John, knocking him over and sticking him to disorient him more.
He let out a breath, sighing a little. "You... you don't have anything in that med kit for pain do you?" he asked. "Something... erm, strong?" he asked. He didn't want to admit why his tolerance was high again, he was ashamed of himself, despite the fact that him doing it to begin with hadn't been his choice, but he would tell John about that later... maybe.
John chuckled, picking up Katherine and pulling the small tin of biscuits out of the bag. "Right here," he said, leaning over to kiss Katherine's nose. He handed her the tin and a plate, setting her down on the floor. "Go ahead and arrange the biscuits however you want," he said, nudging her towards the table.
Together they walked down the hall and into the living room where Sherlock put Hamish into his swing before going into the kitchen to start a grilled cheese sandwich for Katherine. When Sherlock finished the sandwich he was fidgeting from worry, which gnawed at his stomach the whole time, to the point that he almost felt physically sick from it. He smiled gently at Katherine thought as he set down the sandwich, cut in half, in front of Katherine. He poured her a glass of Chocolate milk and sat across from her.
John looked up at Sherlock, his eyes turning sad as he remembered the birthday's of Sherlock's that he had missed, and his own that he had forgotten about, and recently Kat's birthday and the birth of his son. He tipped his head back, looking up at the ceiling and blinking away any fogginess in his eyes that was forming. "Yes, we are," he said. "I'm not missing anymore birthdays or holidays, and neither are you. I'm done. I'm home, and I'm not leaving."
John smiled when Sherlock walked in, pulling his feet up so that Sherlock could sit. Hamish was lying across his chest, because John had known he should have been lying down, but he had to watch the kids. This was his compromise. "What colour hair?" he asked quietly, rubbing his hand soothingly over Hamish's small back to keep him asleep. It would be hard to tell with them. He didn't know Greg's natural colour since he had been salt-and-pepper grey since John had known him, but Mycroft was technically a ginger, though his hair was a very dark orange, nearly auburn.
Sherlock nodded, still resting his head on John's shoulder. He picked a little at his nicotine patch, which was half peeled off from the shower anyway. He slowly pulled it off his skin, folding it into a small square. "I do. Your mother actually is staying with them right now, Harriet and Clara. Since... well for a little while. Just to get on her feet, I suppose," he murmured.
John hummed, a small smile spreading across his lips. "You know, I'll never quite be able to wrap my head around it," he murmured, setting his hand over Sherlock's just because. "You've gone from an angsty teenager who hated the world and cowered from kindness, to being a mature and caring twenty year old with a daughter. And yet I can still see you as the same person."
John sagged with relief, leaning against the door frame and dropping his head back against it. "Christ, Sherlock, don't do that to me," he said quietly, walking into the room and setting the knife down before crawling onto the bed beside his mate. "You scared the living hell out of me." He wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist, snuggling in behind him and nuzzling between his shoulder blades.
John didn't reply, not wanting to get upset again or to upset Sherlock. He simply held Sherlock closer, tucking his head under his chin, and rocked him slowly. He didn't care about firsts--he wanted to be here for everything, for Sherlock. He would miss the entire pregnancy and all that it brought, and he would miss the birth. That was what he cared about.
"Of course not, I merely meant that he wasn't going to kill me," Sherlock said, still tapping away on his phone.
"And that's fine, so do I. Put on some decent jeans, at least," John commented, walking into the bedroom to pull on a darker pair. After some thought, he changed jumpers as well, pulling a dark blue one over his head on top of a white shirt. He looked over at Sherlock as the Omega entered the room, shrugging as he moved to sit on the bed. "It's a good excuse to cover another jumper in my scent," he teased, waiting for Sherlock to get dressed.
He had nearly gotten slapped for it, and a pillow had been thrown at him. He had called a halt to their agreement of whatever Sherlock ate, so did John, because the Omega was wolfing down nearly twenty-five hundred calories a day at this point. He wasn't even twelve weeks along, and John wondered what that meant, exactly. Sherlock's stomach was a little rounder than normal ‚Äì alright, quite a bit rounder than normal ‚Äì and that pleased John to no end, but he was worried about how little sleep his bondmate was getting.
John swore, his knot going from not swollen to almost full in just a few seconds at the sound of Sherlock begging like that. He pulled Sherlock tighter against him, giving a last hard thrust against his prostate and sinking in all the way, his knot swelling fully as he came. He instantly sunk his teeth into the back of Sherlock's neck, directly over the top of his other mark.
John leaned his head back against the headboard, but soon sitting started to become uncomfortable, and he gently switched to lying on his side, curled up so that Katherine was encased in him and his scent, snuggled against his chest the way she was. "You know, every time I've talked to you, I've been poking at you. I never once asked you how you are," John said softly, combing his fingers through her black curls. "And I feel horrible about that, Katty. I'm so sorry." He kissed the top of her head and held her closer. "Are you okay, baby? Really, how are you?"
Sherlock let out a short breath, cutting it off before it would choke into a sob. "I c....can't....it'll hurt." he said, not specifying who it would hurt. Both of them obviously, and Sherlock didn't want to do that with John. He took a deep breath, gulping down John's scent while it was there and fresh, trying to calm himself down so he could just shut up.
John chuckled, trailing his lips down to run the tip of his tongue over the shell of Sherlock's ear. "Absolutely not, because I love your everything more than you love mine," he teased, nipping at Sherlock's earlobe. He pulled back, sighing softly and taking a long drink of his tea. "Sorry, I'm being distracting."
Katherine sniffled once, arms almost startlingly tight around his neck. He rubbed her back gently and felt her head shift. Katherine looked over and pried her arms off of Sherlock only to scoot over onto John's lap, wrapping all four of her limbs around his neck and waist, hiding her face in his neck. Sherlock furrowed his brows a little, god, had Katherine seen it all? He held onto Hamish with both hands, looking concernedly at John.
John clicked the safety back on his gun and stuffed it away, jogging forward to where Sherlock was lying on the ground. "Easy, easy," he murmured, taking off his jumper to wipe the splatter of blood off of Sherlock's face.
John smiled, circling his arms around Sherlock's waist and holding him close. "I can't wait," he whispered, kissing him back and swaying them a little. "Have you ever danced, Sherlock?" he asked suddenly, leading him back down the hall and through the kitchen, into their own bedroom where he started rummaging in his bag for the medicine.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, looking at the gun. "If I'm taking it for my safety, then you're eating for your health," he said. "And don't think you can force me, John, because right now even I could take you," he said, standing up and pulling on his coat ‚Äì he hadn't changed out of his clothes yet anyway.
"I know you will," he murmured. "I'll tear the mickey out of you if you don't, but...however you come home...you just come home," he murmured, nuzzling into John's neck as well. He shut his eyes, memorizing John's scent further, categorizing it.
John looked down at his pocket when his phone chimed, taking a deep breath as he fished it from his jacket and opened up the message. He caught himself sighing before he replied.
"I guess the physical stimulus as well as clawing through my memories like that... It was the auction house," he said, still tracing his wrists gently. ‚ÄúThat first day... bits and pieces but... followed one, to you. When you got me from the collections room," he said. "I never said, but I finally remembered it. All of it," he said.
John stood beside Sherlock, his hand on his shoulder, squeezing lightly. He couldn't sit down, couldn't relax with Sherlock as tense as he was. "Please be nice to her, Sherlock," he asked, glancing down at him momentarily. "Just remember that she's doing her job and is just trying to help."
John combed through Sherlock's hair, running the tip of his nose along his collar and dipping it down below the neckline of his dressing gown. "What do you mean?" he asked quietly, licking over Sherlock's skin and then pulling back to look up at him.
He looked back at John, ‚ÄúSherlock Holmes, and it has been‚Ä¶surprisingly, a pleasure," he said, the corner of his mouth quirking up slightly before he left, hearing the human‚Äôs breathing even out as he fell asleep.
Katherine gasped, looking at where Regina was on the floor. She scrambled out from under the bed and stood up, coated with dust. "Fine, out!" she said, stomping one small foot in protest. "Said come out or count, I'm out! No medicine," she said, making her argument. It was true; Papa said to come out or he'd count. She came out.
John smiled, nodding. "I can manage that," he said, planning on sending a quick text to Angelo to ask him for a favour. "Alright, finish your food, Katty," he said. "Not too long before your bedtime, so you'd best enjoy it." He pushed his own plate away, leaning back and sipping from his glass.
John grinned at Hamish, bouncing him on his knees as Kat cam bounding back down the stairs, the small present held behind her back. He grinned, remembering sitting down and ordering it with her, guiding her hands in wrapping it and letting her write her name and Hamish's on the tag.
John pulled on his shoes, knowing that he would be issued an entirely knew outfit once he got to his base. They may even issue him a new weapon--it was hard to say. He sighed, walking back over to the kitchen doorway and smiling softly and Sherlock and Kat. "Come on, love. We're going to be late," he whispered.
John had been sitting on his bed, leaning back against the wall and fiddling with Sherlock's scarf in his lap when the call sign came on on his screen, and he smiled, immediately clicking the answer button. "Hey baby!" he said, seeing a bouncing Katherine first, sitting in Sherlock's lap. The connection wasn't great, but god, it was good to see them. "Happy birthday, sweetheart." He smiled back at Sherlock, tilting the screen up so that he could see them better. "Hello, love. I miss you."
Sherlock was barely starting to wake up when he heard the shout, jerking awake and gasping a bit at the pain in his shoulder. He looked over to see John, blinking stupidly as he tried to remember where he was. A nurse came in quickly, looking over the two of them, and determining Sherlock as the one to help first. She gave him the whole spiel about where he was, what had happened. Saying something about a very clean wound, through and through, minimal damage. She then showed him his little morphine button, which he clicked quickly in hopes it would work.
Sherlock hummed. "Anything... everything," he murmured, kissing John again. He looked down at his belly, one of his hands covering it. He hummed as John's teeth grazed over his skin. "Just want you," he murmured.
," John said, smiling over at Sherlock and, by default, Katherine. "I just want some proper tea. Not that awful stuff that the hospital serves." He reached up into the cabinet for the teabags, automatically making a cup for Sherlock, whether he would drink it or not. Old habits. He sighed as he poured some milk ‚Äì Mrs Hudson had been shopping for them ‚Äì into his mug and some sugar into Sherlock's. He didn't like lying to Sherlock.
John made a small noise. School. His baby girl was going to school, and he was going to miss it. He wasn't going to be there to give her a hug and a kiss and embarrass her on her first day. He couldn't pack and repack her rucksack to make sure she had everything. He wouldn't be able to pick her up after her first day and listen to all of her grand adventures. "Yeah, alright," he said quietly, trying for a smile but not entirely sure if he managed a proper one.
Sherlock grinned, nipping a little at John's neck. "Good," he said, pulling back slightly and easing John down more on the bed, before laying next to him. "You need rest," he said, more insisting than he was suggesting it.
"For what?" John whispered, not recalling doing anything that was worth thanking. He set his free hand over Sherlock's on his stomach, squeezing his fingers lightly.
Sherlock pocketed his phone, pulling on a dressing gown and looking up the stairs towards Katherine's room. He didn't want to leave her, she had to stay safe. But Harry knew Mrs. Hudson would let her in. He lifted the bag and shakily went downstairs, hailing a cab and snapping at them to take him to Bart's. He winced as he cramped up again, groaning a bit as he took out his phone again.
"My mother is in the hospital, and out pups were nearly kidnapped, and you're telling me to calm down?!" John exclaimed, taking a deep breath to keep from yelling, but all that did was make him inhale a lungful of Sherlock's scent. He let out a soft groan, dropping his forehead to Sherlock's shoulder and immediately broke down, sobbing against him and shaking with each slow drag of breath.
"Sir." Amelia's voice broke his motion, directing his attention to her. "We have company," she said quietly, and John followed her frozen gaze to the windshield, and the muzzle of the rifle being pointed at him.
"Who are you and what do you want?" John demanded quietly, not willing to trust any anonymous person who walked through the door. "I swear, if you're from that damn auction house, you have three seconds to leave before I kill you."
John leant up, kissing Sherlock's cheek and dropping back down onto the balls of his feet just as Maria walked back in. "Alright, let's get this over with, shall we?" she asked, walking forward and setting everything up. She patted Sherlock's arm fondly before slipping the gloves on. "You just wait until her four year old shots. They scream like banshees for those," she said lightly, gently parting Katherine's legs and slowly inserting the catheter.
Sherlock was fine letting her dress herself. Apparently it encouraged creativity and independence. "Such a strong moral compass... gets that from you I think," he murmured with a smile.
Sherlock blinked a couple times, then stood up, letting the sheet fall from around himself before he climbed into the shower. His arms were wrapped around himself and the water spray landed on him a little bit.
John bit his lip, closing his eyes as they progressed toward home. "It looks like it still hurts," he murmured, linking his fingers with Sherlock's and letting their hands rest on Sherlock's thigh. He let out a small sigh, squeezing Sherlock's hand until his own shook.
Sherlock rolled his eyes a little, following John out into the living room, instantly seeing four things that hadn't been done right. He sighed, looking at what was in John's hand and froze.
John had collapsed in his chair, staring blankly at the fireplace. He wondered why Sherlock wasn't answering him, or even where he was.
John flinched, knowing that he couldn't lie to her now just to tell her the truth later. "I won't be gone for long, baby. And I'll be coming back, I promise," he whispered, because damn it all to hell, he was coming back. He had made it back before, and he could do it again.
Sherlock‚Äôs eyes fluttered shut, head hanging down as he panted, feeling himself eased onto his side as John moved, his knot still firmly in place. As if on its own, Sherlock's hand reached down for John's, holding it up close to his face and nuzzling the scent on his wrist, breathing it in. He hummed quietly, feeling like he was inhaling a part of himself, filling a small gap in his chest, and being completely wrapped up in John, like a blanket.
John had to fight down his instincts to help, sitting still as Sherlock left the room. He sighed, wondering if it had been the best idea to tell the young Omega about his brother. Frustrated, he felt like throwing something but didn't, instead shoving off of the bed and walking into the kitchen with their soup bowls and the pot of iced tea, the former of which were placed in the sink, the latter in the fridge.
"Hmmm." Sherlock hummed, nuzzling close to John, his eyes closing on their own. "Can't... Mycroft sending something," he mumbled drowsily. "Have to pick it up‚Ä¶. Jus' going to leave it on the steps 'nd ring the bell. Doesn't do social calls... even if I wasn't... like this," he murmured.
John held her hair again and rubbed her back, waiting for it to calm down. He knew that eventually they'd peak out, and she'd only throw up once an hour or two, but until then, at was all random. "Papa thought you had a cold, sweetie," he murmured. "I was wrong, baby, and I'm sorry. They don't really made medicine for the flu."
"Oh, love," John murmured, wrapping his arms tighter around Sherlock, holding him close to his chest. "Don't feel so bad, sweetheart, alright? It's not your fault, it's not my fault, and I know you'll do a good job. And you'll have help, and you won't be alone. Okay? Look at me, Sherlock." He reached out, cupping Sherlock's cheek and tilting his head so that their eyes met. "Everything will be okay."
John shook his head again. ‚ÄúIt was just a voice, someone saying my name. My men were all shouting at me, probably just heard one of them.‚Äù He knew it hadn‚Äôt been one of his men, he knew all of them, this voice had been different, and the way it had said his name‚Ä¶ still he didn‚Äôt say any of this.
Sherlock hadn‚Äôt fallen asleep, simply lying there and listening to John breathe, and dream, hearing him mumble quietly. He knew when the alarm went off that John would get up. Sherlock opened his eyes, looking up at him.
"But here..." John blinked, drawing in a ragged breath and then closing his eyes firmly, swallowing down his rising emotion. "Well, I've got you," he whispered, his broken voice reflecting how he felt. "And that makes up for it all. Balances everything on the edge of a blade."
Sherlock leant over and narrowed his eyes, looking at the mark on her neck. He pulled out his phone, looking up something while he saw the bag with her effects on the other slab. He walked over, pulling on a glove on his way and fishing out the watch, smirking a little. "Check with ex-boyfriends or perhaps... a fianc√©..." he murmured.
Sherlock hummed lightly. "Mm, yes you were," he said quietly, looking at John. He smiled a little when John seemed to be trying more for his scent. "It's different now isn't it?" he asked quietly, looking down. "Sorry," he murmured.
John closed his eyes, not wanting to say anything, not wanting to relive anything. "If I looked at it kind of sideways, it... it looked like this home that I had booted into. Inspection, evacuation, whatever. I ended up killing two men with my hands. They were my first kills."
It was always so hot, but not nearly as hot as the pain that shot through his body as the burning piece of metal tore through his shoulder, shattering his clavicle before bursting out the other side. He was thrown back into the sand, stunned for a moment before the pain set in, his breathing hitching already, trying to reach up to cover it, craning his neck down, but only making out the dark red that was staining his front, and starting to seep into the sand.
John marked his own scent on everything the strange Alpha had touched, disliking exactly how much had been contaminated by his scent.
"Please don't," John whispered, his voice small. He wouldn't be able to handle Sherlock leaving him again, disappearing without a goodbye. It would kill him. He let go of a breath, closing his eyes and sinking down against the mattress. His body became heavy and before long, he was sleeping soundly.
Sherlock didn't mean to fall asleep in his vigil, and he didn't know he had until he felt the fingers brush against his hand. He jerked awake, blinking a few times as he sat bolt upright, looking around rapidly. There was no one in the room though. He looked down at his hand, then up to see John awake. He calmed a small bit, scooting a bit closer in the chair. "Hey," he said quietly.
There was a knock at his door, and John cleared his throat. "Yeah, come in," he said, holding up his finger to Sherlock. His second in command, Amelia, stepped in, looking apologetic. "Sorry to interrupt, sir, but there's an emergency at the hospital. They need you."
John nodded, thankful that they could rely on Mycroft when they needed him, even if it was only for transportation.
John made Murray go back and pick up Stephen's body ‚Äì something to send home to his family. Then he passed out, dizzy and disoriented, only able to think
John chuckled at how much she was starting to sound like Mrs. Hudson, with a small mix of his own mother thrown in. "I won't throw knives any more, baby, I promise," he said. "Not sure when I can come home, sweetie. Won't be too long, though. And I'm glad you've been helping with Misha." He looked up and caught Sherlock's eye, silently telling him that he liked that nickname, and that it was staying. "You're Papa's good girl; I knew you'd be brave for me."
"I think that might be a good idea," he murmured. "She needs to see someone at least once, that way we know if...if it would be considered a good idea for her to continue," he said, getting up and laying out a blanket, grabbing a few toys from a small basket, and setting Hamish on the floor on his stomach, putting the toys just out of his reach. "There you go, little bit of work for you." He rubbed the infant's back before taking his seat again, steepling his fingers beneath his chin.
Mycroft stepped forward. "As far as I've seen it, we have had little differences, save how we do things. We both care about him, and want his safety," he said, looking closer at the infant.
John growled a little, picking Sherlock up and placing him in the centre of the bed. He kissed him again, roughly, knowing that that was how this first time was going to be. Fast and hard. It had been too long, and now Sherlock was in heat, and he was all but fresh from the war, and they both
"Yeah, sure," John smiled, reaching down and lifting Kat up with a smile, "I'd love to hold the little one." He kissed her cheek and blew a raspberry on a strip of skin showing across her belly before settling her against his chest. "I'll be in the living room," he told Sherlock, running his fingers through his hair as he walked from the kitchen.
Worse for you, John thought, but he nodded, because he was not a selfish man, and he cared far more about Sherlock and Katherine than he did about himself. "I'm not going to lose it. I promise. I'll be on that plane home, and I'll be in one piece." He looked out of the window, seeing the airport, and tightened his arms around Sherlock, not wanting to depart from him. When they parked, he paid the cabbie, then let Sherlock out first and followed, holding a hand out for Katherine and taking Sherlock's in his other.
As soon as Sherlock felt John's arms loosen around him he leaned up and pressed a quick kiss to his lips and then rolled out of bed, walking over to Hamish. He peered in, the infant pup asleep, left fist shoved mostly into his mouth and sucking contentedly. He let out a breath, resting his hand on Hamish's stomach for a moment before reaching up and pulling his fist out of his mouth. Hamish cooed a little, shifting for a moment before instantly popping it back into his mouth. Sherlock sighed, "Going to need to get pacifiers I think," he murmured, walking back and curling back up with John.
"Your Papa means a copy," Sherlock said, looking down at the spring rolls. "And I don't get that hungry these days," he said, taking another small bite.
"I don't think I'll ever tire of you doing that," John admitted, glancing up at Sherlock with another smile. "It did, yeah. I didn't do much, just handed over instruments and cleaned the sight for the surgeon, but it went smoothly. No complications." He took another large bite of his sandwich, chewing thoroughly before swallowing. "And you're welcome for the other thing. I felt obligated. You don't seem the ownership type. You have your own ideas, and I certainly wasn't going to hold you back."
Sherlock hummed, his eyes slipping shut when John's fingers moved inside of him. He shook his head, the wave hitting faster this time and he batted at John's hand. "Just.... God, please just..." he panted, his hips bucking a small bit.
. John sat still for a moment, letting those words fully sink in before he threw his arms around Sherlock's neck, holding him close. "It's going to be the longest two years of my life, and I'm going to spend every day thinking about you," he promised, clinging to him. "I'm going to write to you, because lord knows I won't have enough time to Skype."
Sherlock sighed at the look, John was the one that needed it more, and he ate before going to the hospital...twenty-four hours before. He sighed again, then took a bite. Katherine smiled, picking up the mug of tea that was hers, it had a kitten on it. Hamish squawked a little, his small fists hitting Sherlock's legs, making smacking sounds with his mouth. Sherlock finished the toast, picking him up and situated him in the crook of his arm. "You've got worse manners than me. Maybe your Papa will be a good influence like he was on me," he murmured, picking up the bottle he'd prepared and set on the tray, holding it out for the infant. He always made Hamish reach for it, and as such, just over three months old he was already almost holding the bottle himself.
"For this... all of this," Sherlock said, "I'm sorry..." He sobbed, not able to form words anymore. He slumped back against John, turning his head in and leaning against him. He fell silent after that, still trembling, silent tears coming from his still closed eyes.
"Oh, yes, you are," John chuckled, a little amused at how stubborn he was being. "All those hormones racing through you? You're going to be pissed off one second and then crying the next. Just you wait." The thought was a bit intimidating, when John really thought about it, given Sherlock's wide and sharp range of emotions as it was. "Then again," he mused, "it may just calm you down, mellow you out." He shrugged. "Hard to be sure, really. But you're more likely to get emotional."
Sherlock sat up a bit more, pulling out some cash for the driver. When they arrived, Sherlock paid the driver and climbed out, moving up the steps to the house and waited for John before knocking.
John looked up, startled to see Sherlock standing there. He was still in heat, what was he doing out of bed? John stood, grabbing Sherlock's hand and leading him back to the room, closing and locking the door behind them. He walked back over to his bed and sat down on it, putting his head in his hands. Christ, he was still bloody crying.
John laughed a little, pulling on one of Sherlock's favourite jumpers and a pair of loose, comfortable jeans. "Yes, people usually throw baby showers. And yes, we should let them throw one because then they can buy us stuff for the baby and we don't have to spend the money on it." He winked at Sherlock, taking his hand and leading him to the kitchen. "Let's eat, and then we can go."
John jumped to his feet as soon as his name was called, antsy from sitting so long. He approached the doctor quickly, holding out his hand and shaking the older man's.
With a nod from his daughter he went down the hall and let himself into the bathroom. He instantly knew something was wrong, hearing a shuddering breath. Sherlock walked into the bathroom and instantly knelt in front of his mate. "John..." he breathed, "John, god...what's happened?" he asked, though he was forming a pretty good idea of what it was in his head. Mindy, a call to Harry. Something was wrong.
Standing outside it, though, was Mycroft. He looked at John steadily. "Welcome back, Captain Watson," he said, standing in front of the door. "Amusing, we keep meeting like this," he said.
Sherlock let out a sharp breath, snaking his arms around John more and holding tightly to him. "It's alright John." Sherlock said quietly, speaking more into John's chest. He looked up, seeing John's damp face, closing his eyes as John started kissing him. He did the same, holding tightly onto him while still murmuring quietly to his mate.
Sherlock smiled a small bit at that, letting out a breath. "That's what our Nanny did for us when we were sick," he murmured quietly, returning the pressure on John's hand a small bit.
John turned his head to look at Mycroft, smiling softly. He was in a far better mood outwardly, hiding everything negative, though he knew that probably wasn't the greatest idea. "Come in, Mycroft. May as well meet your niece." He sat up a little, exhausted as he was, but continued to stroke Sherlock's hand. "I know we've had our differences regarding your brother, but you're still family."
Sherlock took a few steps forward. "Don't touch him!" he said, trying to sound more forceful as he kept the gun trained on Moran. "Step back, Moran!" he said, swallowing thickly. "You know I'll shoot you; I won't hesitate this time," he said, his voice wavering slightly as he took in the man's stance, and what he'd heard.
"Bit boring, don't you think?" Moriarty asked, stepping around the doorway and walking towards Sherlock. He stood calmly beside him, staring out over the city, which was slowly getting showered in a watered-down sunrise. "Living, breathing. Dull." He glanced up at the Omega beside him, taking a deep breath of his scent. "I thought you were different, but you're not. You're so... ordinary."
John reached over, shutting off his alarm like his had done every morning. Except this wasn't every morning. He turned his expression back up, reaching to comb his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "I love you," he said, and he was going to say it as often as possible in the next three hours that he had with him and Katherine. He squeezed his eyes closed as an ache went through his chest, and then he sat up with Sherlock in his arms, holding him close. He kissed him softly, savouring the tired response. "I'm going to go wake Katty up," he murmured. "Will you start her breakfast?" he asked quietly.
"There are some devices we can provide to you that might help ease some of the discomfort since..." she let out a breath, knowing Sherlock knew what she meant. He didn't answer, not knowing what to say. "Well, it's an option love," she said before leaving. Sherlock thought about it, knowing it wasn't the best for John and him to actually... do that. He whined again, curling up.
Sherlock looked at her, smiling over at John as he held Katherine on his hip. "She knows your name though," he murmured. "Papa," he murmured, after which Katherine echoed it.
Katherine grinned, giggling when John pulled her close. She cuddled close to him, nuzzling against his chest. "I'm good, had fun at Gran's," she said, looking up and pressing a kiss to his cheek. "Missed you Papa, you feel better now?" she asked. Sherlock perched on the edge of the bed, sitting Hamish down between them and holding him so he wouldn't topple over to his side.
"Shut up, no you're not!" Sherlock said, hauling John up and into a kitchen chair. He looked him over, quickly getting some disinfectant for John's arm and wrapping it. Superficial cut, he knew, but the panic was still there.
"I won't!" Katherine said, stabbing a piece of the French toast and dragging it onto her plate. Sherlock smiled, reaching over and scooping a bit of eggs onto her plate as well. "Not just the sweets, yes?" he said, smiling at John. He took up one of the smaller pieces of toast, drizzling a bit of syrup onto it before cutting into it with his fork, taking a bite. "Mm...outdone yourself John, I should have you cook more now that you're feeling better," he said with a smirk.
Sherlock nodded a bit. "And her... the rest of your life, and mine. We have her," he said softly. He looked over towards the swing, letting out a breath. "We won't have to worry about him forever. And if I can help it, you won't be killing anyone again. Ever," he said, tilting his head up to look at John. "That's not your life anymore."
John nodded, giving the address of the store he had had in mind to the waiting cabbie. When they were moving, he stroked his thumb gently over Sherlock's knuckles, resting his head against the seat and letting his eyes slip closed for the moment.
John knew that spooked look in Sherlock's eye. He stepped into the room, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and pressing up against his back, resting his head against his shoulder blade. "You're okay," he promised, though he wasn't sure what was bothering Sherlock.
John stayed still when Sherlock ran into him, raising his hand to gently hold it against Sherlock's hip.
Sherlock settled against John with a sigh, relaxing instantly and resting his hand on top of John's.
"I'll force feed him cake until he bursts," he murmured, knowing full well if John didn't come back...he didn't know how he'd come back from losing John. "I can't lose you," he said quietly. I wouldn't be here if not for you," he said softly. ‚ÄúNeither would she...or this," he said, moving John's hand to his stomach. "Without you...I...I can't function," he said.
John nodded, leaning into Sherlock's hands. "I know you will. But don't... don't count on it, Sherlock. Don't get too attached to the thought. Once I'm in a routine, pulling me out of it is hard. They'd have to find a new fit, and I'd have to get readjusted. It's better to just let it be. I'll be safe, Sherlock, I promise." He knew that they would never come to an agreement on this. Safety was just relative in the end, it was never a definite thing. Over there, a stray bomb could kill you every time you leave your bunker. A suicide shooter could catch you unaware. You could get hit by a stray bullet in a random gunfight. No one was safe.
"You're an idiot because you thought I didn't want to come along. Of course I want to come along. My leg is just killing me." John followed Sherlock, barely half a step behind him as they walked down the street. "And yes, I'm curious. Where exactly are we going?"
John was slightly stunned about Sherlock sliding onto his lap. He smiled a bit, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and pulling him a little closer. "Hopefully he gets back to you soon," he murmured, nuzzling against Sherlock's temple and kissing down to his jaw.
Sherlock smiled a little, relaxing more at John's ease. He sighed. "I would say fifteen. She knew about my parents, after all," he pointed out, resting his head on John's shoulder. He was quiet for a little while after that. "It made it feel a little more real... going there," he said.
"Living is what you did before I left. Living is not keeping to yourself and snapping at the people who try to help you. That's surviving, and living is the opposite. Living is getting hurt, feeling the pain, and then moving on from it, because that's what we do. We continue to live for those who can't." John retook his seat, nearly collapsing in it, his leg practically giving out underneath him.
Sherlock let out a breath, looking up at John. "I'll get a bandage for your thumb when you're done eating," he said. "The whole sandwich this time, please. Last time I ended up eating your other half after you... had left."
"I can't help but wonder why you even brought up the question of me wanting pups at my age," Sherlock said. "Curious that you would ask. Almost suggesting that were I to say yes to such an enquiry that you would give them to me, which is a strange offer to make when one's leaving regardless. Also is the suggestion of any kind of permanence in my situation here, for the same reason," he rattled off quickly, staring at the opposite wall.
John wrapped his arm around Sherlock's shoulders, kissing the top of his head. "I love you. We're going to get no sleep tonight, but I love you." He smiled, nuzzling against Sherlock's temple.
Sherlock sighed a little, blinking his eyes open. It was gone now, completely gone. "Okay," he said quietly. "Do you just want us to go or... well, I could probably do with some tea maybe," he murmured softly. Next best thing, considering he didn't have a patch on him, couldn't smoke, and wouldn't touch the other, especially now. "Could you? You make it perfectly," he said quietly. "I'm okay now... I can go downstairs and... I dunno, make small talk with your mother or something," he murmured.
Sherlock swayed slightly where he stood, quickly corrected by a smack upside the head by the Beta holding his leash, barking at him to stand straighter. He did so, glancing up at the crowd and watching a few hands get raised.
After spreading peanut butter and syrup on his pancakes, John dug in, hungry from not eating a lot last night.
Sherlock hummed, bringing his legs over the side of the bed and standing up carefully when asked, sitting down quickly again. He winced, trying to ease the gown off his thin frame, tugging at the electrodes stuck to his chest with a wince.
Sherlock scooted over a little and pressed his hip against John's. "Mine," he answered simply, happily munching on a spring roll. He looked down at his stomach, sighing a little as he kept eating. "Better than a saint I promise, more important," he said.
Sherlock stood up, glancing at the stone again, and then down once more, letting John lead him away. He felt numb, physically from the cold, emotionally from everything else. He sniffed a little, blinking a couple times.
Sherlock let out a small cry, lifting up to press down sharply on John again, rolling his hips a little. He moaned, nodding before he tilted his head back, facing upwards to the ceiling. He panted lightly, reaching down to take himself in hand, stroking upwards, though his limbs were shaking and it was difficult. He was so close...
John smiled at the older doctor. "I came to say goodbye," he started before Dr McCann could ask. "I got a call for service. They moved my departure time up." He squeezed Sherlock's hand reassuringly, watching his mentor lower his pen and take off his glasses.
"I'll be right back," the nurse said, running off to get a doctor, though John was pretty sure he already knew what it was.
"I know," John whispered, closing his eyes as he continued to pepper Sherlock with gentle kisses. "I know it's not fair. And I'm so sorry."
John met Sherlock's gaze, for the first time seeing a hit of a spark in the depths of his mercurial eyes. "You sound better today," John noted, rolling the shirt down to cover the Omega's side. "More alert, at least." He had noticed the way Sherlock had avoided the food question, and he sighed. "Why are you so against putting something in your stomach? Even a little broth?"
mother, Mycroft what are you‚Ä¶?‚Äù Sherlock stepped forward, Mycroft stepping in front of him. It was then he felt something was wrong.
It was wishful thinking; Sherlock never hoped for anything. Hope was illogical, wishing never did anything. There was just the facts, and the probability of something happening. You couldn't calculate hope, and yet, Sherlock felt himself wishing and hoping these things for John.
"You won't be alone," John repeated insistently. "Mum and Harry will take care of you, and Mrs. Hudson is right downstairs. I'll write to you again, and I'll talk to them over Skype. You won't be alone, Sherlock, I promise." He would have to go over to his mum's soon, and Harry would have to be there. He didn't want to leave, didn't want to tell them.
John shook his head, looking down at Katherine and running the back of his finger over her cheek. He wouldn't come to me directly, that's not his style. He would go after pressure points, make me weak, make me vulnerable, and then he would make me go to him, and he would take me apart." He looked up at Sherlock, his eyes a little unfocused as he remembered that time being tortured.
ate, even. And if you worry so much about my weight then know that I will only eat when you do from now on for the rest of the week," he said. "We'll see whose resolve wears down first."
John bit his tongue to hold in his next sob, nodding a little, because it felt good to be yelled at as opposed to half-supporting another crying person. He let himself cry until all of his tears were spent, not wanting to risk another breakdown anytime soon. He slowly leaned up, wiping at his cheeks and letting out a shaky breath. "Sorry," he murmured, still just sitting there, not trusting himself on his feet yet.
"A little bit, yeah," John said, smiling as he let her go and pushed himself slowly up into a sitting position with his shoulder back against the headboard. "Hello, there, little Misha," he said when he looked over toward Sherlock and then down at their son. He held out his hands for the infant, picking him up and chuckling a little when he squealed in delight. "How are you, big boy? Good lord, you're getting heavy. What is your Gran feeding you?" he teased, winking over at Sherlock before blowing a raspberry on Hamish's belly.
Sherlock looked up towards the door, sighing a little. "Tedious," he muttered under his breath, ruffling his hair a little. He stood up, looking out into the mirror.
Draping his arm over his face, John gave a weak noise, not really knowing what to do. For a small handful of seconds, he wished that he was back in the desert. At least there he knew what he was doing. He had had an agenda and a goal ‚Äì get back home to Sherlock. Now that he was home, he was lost.
Sherlock looked in the box and saw his Belstaff coat. It had been a bit long on him before, but when he lifted it up now, it was a perfect fit for him. He'd hardly got to wear it before; it had been a present from his grand-m√©re. He smiled, looking in the box and having his breath catch in his throat.
Sherlock settled on top of John, nuzzling the thin, light hairs on his chest as he nodded, soaking up the praise once more. "Mhm," he hummed, moaning a little as John pushed up into him. He whined again, pushing himself up to align himself better, sinking down some as John pushed up, his eyes closing as the motions continued, his mouth open slightly.
"I know you didn't eat lunch," Sherlock said, looking at John for a moment. "Surgery went well then? You helped with this one. They must think you‚Äôre ready for more things if they asked you to do such." Which meant that Sherlock would have to recalculate. They might demand to have John sooner from him.
Sherlock moaned at the sound of John's voice, feeling John's knot swell. He buried his face into John's neck and cried out a bit as he finally came, his hips jerking up. His head rolled back and he shook as he rode out the wave of pleasure that rolled through him. He fell back into the bed, panting heavily as he went limp, trying to catch his breath. "I... I... John...
John grinned for a second, taking another sip of his tea before he set it aside and shuffled so that he was lying down again. He took Kat into his arms once more and snuggled with her, kissing the top of her head. "I don't know," he whispered, glancing up at Sherlock. "Sometimes I just feel like I never left Afghanistan. Like I never can leave."
John pressed a lingering kiss to Sherlock's temple. "I'm glad you like her. I thought you might, but I didn't want to say anything before we got there."
John watched Sherlock wearily, able to tell that he wouldn't be able to calm him down. He walked into the kitchen, starting the coffee pot and grabbing a banana from the hanging basket, though he still wasn't hungry. He chewed it rhythmically, leaning against the counter as he waited for the pot to finish.
Katherine frowned a little. "Okay," she said, not wanting more medicine ever. She sighed, finishing off her plate and sliding off of her chair, face sticky with the sauce from her dinner. "Can play now?" she asked.
Sherlock leant into the hand gently. "No... no, it's fine," he said. "Like you said... you're not leaving. And it was just a dream," he said quietly.
John panted, resting his forehead between Sherlock's shoulder blades for a moment and releasing his hair as he lowered them to their sides. "You're so wonderful," he murmured, kissing the bondmark at the back of Sherlock's neck, stroking his fingers down his stomach and then back up his chest as he continued to nuzzle against the mark.
Ten minutes later he looked once more at John, then left, heading downstairs and knocking on Mrs Hudson's door. He explained that John had taken ill, and was resting and that he had to leave for a case. He walked over to see Katherine, who was grinning and giggled a little to see him.¬†He picked her up, holding her close. "My girl... always. Dada's going to come back. Papa can‚Äôt know... but I am," he whispered.
John pulled Sherlock closer with an arm around his hip, resting his head on the Omega's shoulder and gently looking at the picked scab on his wrist.
Sherlock smiled when John fell asleep, and he just watched him for a little while. He got up and went to the bathroom, walking around the living room. He sighed, walking over by the window and his old chair. He blinked, looking in the corner, seeing his violin case. He smiled again, grabbing it up quickly and opening it. He laughed softly, running his fingers over the instrument. John had kept it.
The fabric of John's fatigue trousers was rough against the sensitive skin of his inner thighs and back, feeling perfect, and John's soft cotton shirt‚Ä¶ the contrast was amazing.
Sherlock's face pinched a little as he was moved, a small noise of protest escaping him as he started to stir a little. He hummed a little, settling against John more.
John set the book aside once Katherine was sleeping, but he kept holding her like that, talking nonsense to her and rubbing her back gently to help keep her from having a nightmare again. He wasn't tired anymore, not after being awake for this long, so he just kept holding her, loving on her, until the sun had risen completely.
"And just where are we going to put a bigger bathtub?" John asked with a chuckle, kissing above the mark on the back of Sherlock's neck. "There's no room in here." He traced circles around Sherlock's chest, nipping gently at his skin.
‚ÄúI am not here to kill you,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúThe ones who did this to you are being arrested, and will go to trial.‚Äù The blond shook his head.
"He was already gone Mum, when you and Dad finally found me," she murmured, looking at John. "Still though, even a call would have been nice, but I understand why you didn't," she said quietly.
"That's cheating," John muttered, closing his eyes again. Though his mind was quite opposed to the thought of sleep, his body was gasping for it, and in the end, his body won out, forcing him into a deep sleep.
John looked back up, meeting the other Alpha's gaze. "You're going to make them all suffer?" It was more of a statement than a question. "All of them, the Beta handlers as well." He turned to look at Sherlock, exposing his back to Mycroft.
John nodded slowly, watching Katherine stir a little in her sleep. She was going to get hungry again soon, which meant fussing and crying. He lifted her up slowly from Sherlock's arms, careful not to disturb him, and stood up with her, walking slowly around the room. "Then I think you should," he said quietly, looking back over at Mycroft. "Don't put it off." He walked over to Mycroft, rocking Katherine slowly. "Would you like to hold her?" he asked softly, glancing up at him and then back down at his daughter.
‚ÄúOh, small bedsit. I‚Äôm looking for another place, but hard to afford London on an Army pension,‚Äù he said with a sigh.
"Mum had me because of a relationship she'd been in with an Alpha. Dad knew he was infertile, at least that way, but they both wanted another kid, so mum went out and got knocked up again."
John bit his lip, shutting the door behind himself. He walked up to Sherlock, stopping his movements by wrapping his arms firmly around him, holding him in place. "Shh," he breathed, stroking his hand along his back, nuzzling against his neck and inhaling his scent. "Shh, love, you're alright. We're alright, I promise," he murmured, kissing Sherlock's skin, following a tendon up his neck to his jaw.
Sherlock took a shaky deep breath, John's scent hitting him, stronger than it had been, but still not the same; he didn't know if it was good or not.
"We've already had breakfast, but maybe you'll feel up to taking lunch with us?" Sherlock asked. "How do you feel?" he added.
John let out a small breath when his knot receded and he slipped out of Sherlock with a wet noise. "How bout we clean up first though, hmm?" he suggested, rubbing Sherlock's shoulders.
mine, and I couldn't..." his voice broke, and he bit his lip. "I'm sorry. But I'm glad I didn't let you go." He drew in a shaky breath. "When... when do you go into heat again?" he asked, wanting to know so that they could plan around it.
Sherlock blinked, not even thinking when he slipped inside, standing by the door and looking at the curtain, knowing John was behind it. He sat on the toilet lid, listening to John. He sighed. "You're washing away your smell," he said quietly.
John slipped out of bed, quickly walking around and crawling in behind Sherlock and circling his arm around his waist. "I know," he said quietly, nuzzling against the back of Sherlock's neck. "But I'm coming home, promise. And you can kill Mycroft if I don't."
Sherlock let out a slow breath, nodding once and shutting his eyes. He didn't think he could sleep, though. He lay there for a while, John's arms around him, holding Sherlock close to him. He hummed a little, settling more against him.
"You have to be really careful though okay?" he said, patting the left side of himself that was tucked against the sofa back. "Climb up by my legs, then settle here, but slow babe alright?" he said.
John rested his forehead against Sherlock's chest before he finally just gave up and laid on top of him, covering him like a blanket. "Agreed," he whispered, stroking his hand along Sherlock's sweaty side as they waited for his knot to recede. "You alright?" he asked quietly, raising his head to look up at him.
"Not sure I want to get out of here," John murmured, stepping up and resting his head against Sherlock's shoulder.
John sat up, looking around the small bedsit he lived in currently, rubbing his shoulder as his eyes swept over the bare walls. He‚Äôd had the dream five times now, roughly once every three or four weeks and he still didn‚Äôt understand it. Why the snow? Why that place?
John's breath wasn't coming into his lungs properly, and he realised it was more than likely shock causing it. He was alive though, because why, if he was dead, would he be experiencing shock. Something warm and wet trickled down his temple, and he knew before he had raised his fingers that it was blood. He assessed with just the barest brushing of the tips of his fingers. Graze along the side of his head. Trigger-happy snipers. Probably a new guy.¬† He looked up at Sherlock, rolling over and then pushing himself into an unsteady sitting position. "Please tell me you killed that mani‚Äì Sherlock, you're bleeding." He stared at the wound on his shoulder, grabbing Sherlock's hand and pulling him down beside him.
Katherine smiled as the scarf was wrapped up nicely and put in a bag. She looked up at John smiling. "Angelo's...hmm...if Daddy likes it," she murmured quietly. "Can I go?" she asked. "I go right?"
"Because you were gone, and your scent was gone, and I'm only two months back from the war, Sherlock," John muttered, his breath hot on Sherlock's skin as he mouthed at their bond mark, and then the one on the side of his neck. "I know that you're nesting, and I know that you miss them, but... a little warning, maybe, would have been nice."
John released Sherlock, watching him walk away. He felt like crying again, wondering if it would have been better to have kept it a secret. But, no. Secrets weren't good between them. He didn't think he would ever fully forgive Sherlock for the last secret the Omega had kept, and he didn't think Sherlock would have ever forgiven him this, either. He curled up in the corner of the sofa, smiling a little at Katty and the dolls she was holding. "The Doctor?" he asked, beckoning her over. "Is he going to join some of the other dolls in your house?"
"Papaaa!" Katherine squealed, grinning wide. "Happy Birthday Papa! I'm four!" she said with a smile, quickly starting to babble on about the zoo, and what they were doing later that day and who was coming over and how she was four now, restating the fact a few times. Sherlock let her talk, just looking at John through the fuzzy connection, trying to deduce what he could, tired...busy. Busy wasn't good. Not over there. "John," he said, smiling stupidly, eyes watering a little from a mixture of happiness and sadness. He swallowed, looking at him, in fatigues.
"When are you being shipped out?" McCann asked, folding his hands on the desk. He was going to be sad to see John leave. John was definitely one of his more promising pupils, and he had the steadiest hands and the quickest mind.
"You wouldn't drop him." Sherlock said, holding Hamish close to his chest with one arm. He lifted up his red scarf and draped it around John's neck gently. "There." he said, sitting on a chair after pulling it flush to John's bed. He wanted to climb into the bed with him, but he didn't know if he'd hurt anything. Reaching into a bag he had he pulled out a bottle that had been wrapped in a flannel. Still warm, that was good. He swirled it around to stir it up again without adding air bubbles and started to feed the infant, who's fist was shoved in his mouth as he sucked on it, indicating he was hungry. It was the quiet indication...the loud one...well John would be introduced to that later.
"You did really well, Sherlock. Remembering them like that? And pointing out the ones that didn't belong, making Lestrade look the fool... it was fantastic. You're quite extraordinary," John murmured, his lips brushing Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock nodded a little. "Yes, yes, but we won't worry about anything too big for mistakes," he said, laying Katherine on her back on his knees and pressing her palms together, pulling them apart some. "You're going to do just fine won't you? Not much room for mistakes when you're already perfect," he said with a small smile.
"Yeah, it's definitely different. Definitively... I can only think to describe it using the word 'pregnant.'" He swirled the glass, blowing on the foam, and took a drink of the beer. "I'm glad Mycroft is keeping you off cases. I'd rather you home safe, even if I'm not home, which I do apologise for."
Jim paused, humming pensively ‚Äì as if he actually had to think at all. "How does tomorrow morning sound? It better sound splendid, because you actually don't have a choice."
Sherlock sighed, looking down at them both. "Yes, possibly a drug. And it's not just nightmares John. I've seen it okay? I'm not blind, it's like you're slipping away from me, from us," he said, trying to stay calm.
John smirked to himself as he turned down the hall, gesturing Sherlock to follow. "Nothing at all," he sent over his shoulder, grabbing his jacket and shrugging it on, tossing Sherlock's coat over to him. "I'm definitely not telling you." He smiled, slightly giddy at the moment, grabbing up his wallet and keys and opening the door, trotting down the stairs.
be. There was only one thing that Sherlock didn't know about. But he could take care of that on his own, he just needed to get to work to do it. And being clammy and wanting to throw up was not going to help with that. "Is there something I can take to make myself feel better, or should I just make myself throw up?"
"Hey, don't look so forlorn about it," John whispered, brushing his lips against Sherlock's as he combed through his hair with his other hand. "It'll happen, alright? And what are you talking about; you and Mycroft are seven years apart. Five won't make a huge difference." He sighed, moving to wrap his arms around Sherlock again, pulling him close.
Sherlock moaned against John's mouth, wriggling on John's fingers. He loved the feeling of John praising him, and he felt it wash over him. He hummed, nodding slightly. "Mm...love you John...Christ, so much.." he breathed, panting.
John rolled over, wrapping his arm around Sherlock and pulling him closer. "Hello," he murmured, having woken up just a short time ago. "How're you feeling?" he asked quietly, kissing Sherlock's forehead and the tip of his nose and then his lips.
"Getting him there was like pulling teeth, but... I knew it would help." John stayed leant forward, his elbows on his knees. Exhausted as he was, he was having trouble falling asleep.
John pulled back, looking steadily at Sherlock as he traced the line of the chain from his neck to his chest. "I like them better on you, anyway," he murmured, the corner of his mouth lifting up into a smirk.
John raised his eyebrows but didn't say anything, sliding across the seat and hooking his arm through Sherlock's and resting his head on his shoulder. He laced their fingers together, stroking his thumb over Sherlock's knuckles. "Thank you for coming with me," he murmured.
Sherlock eyed the man a little, then followed John to the back of the store, looking at the shoes. He smiled a little, walking over and looking over a few pairs. He looked down at his feet, almost certain his feet were the same size. He picked out a pair, trying them on and nodding once.
Mindy reached up and combed through Sherlock's hair, trying to tame some of his curls. "Yes you do. You have me, and you'll always have me." She gave him a warm smile, meaning her words with everything that she had. "Of course I'll be there," she said, taking Kat's hand and playing with her fingers while she looked levelly at Sherlock.
Sherlock elbowed John lightly with a small laugh, climbing out of the car and moving up the stairs with John. The smell of Chinese food was in the flat and he moved towards the bag, opening it up. "Disregard my previous statement, Mrs Hudson is the resident saint of this flat," he said, tearing into the box of spring rolls and falling back onto the sofa, cradling the box in his lap.
John moaned, nipping at Sherlock's neck as he sped up his thrusts, rocking Sherlock through his orgasm. "Let's see if we can't get you to do that again. You're so beautiful, Sherlock," he purred, sucking a small bruise just above his mate's collarbone.
John smiled. "Yeah, sure," he said, leaning up to kiss Sherlock lightly. He was starting to recognise the signs of pregnancy, though he obviously wasn't going to get caught dead saying that to Sherlock. "I'll meet you in bed," he whispered, proceeding up the stairs to Kat's room. He knocked on her door, waiting for confirmation before he walked in.
After a minute he stood up, Katherine on his hip. "Why don't we go put on that nice dress Gran Hudson gave you, and do your hair up. We need to catch a cab to meet everyone at the restaurant." he murmured. Katherine nodded as they went upstairs to do that. Restaurant was a loose term, it was really a place that was very child friendly, having a small play area off to the side, which they'd reserved. Several of Katherine's playmates from the daycare were invited, and everyone was coming. Little to be said about Greg and Mycroft, but they'd been invited. Maybe they would show up.
In the kitchen, John scribbled Sherlock a quick note, telling him to make room in the closet and chest of drawers for his clothes, and to not feel bad at all about moving John's around. He reminded him to eat something, and then grabbed an apple before heading out of the door.
Sherlock finally re-emerged almost an hour later, the ache in his side worse now. He blinked his eyes a few times, having to remember where he was. He felt fingers combing through his hair and creased his forehead a little, tilting his head up slightly.
John swallowed, absently combing through Sherlock's curls. "Will you come with me? I... I want you to meet them anyway, and I guess I just... need the support." He glanced back down at Sherlock, trying not to look or sound too desperate for the company. He didn't want to face his family alone; not after all these years.
John smirked, rolling over onto his back. He reached down unbuttoned his trousers, pulling them and his pants off and tossing them to the floor. "Good?" he asked, letting Sherlock take over,
‚ÄúIt has been bothering me since my return home. I wish you would elaborate on these differences. The man whose office I was in. He would‚Ä¶bite me.‚Äù John said this carefully as if having trouble believing it himself.
John leaned against Sherlock, smiling while he watched his mother hold his daughter. "She looks more like you than she does me, Mum," he said, which was true and entirely unfair.
Sherlock bit his lip a little, eyes closing a little. "Y-yes sir..." he breathed with a smirk, the corner of his mouth quirking up. He rolled his hips up again, wetting his lips as he looked at John, almost in challenge, wearing nothing now but John's tags.
Sherlock yelped in surprise that he was actually being allowed this time, his whole body shaking and giving a jerk as he finally came. He tensed up, tightening more around John, crying out as it was almost painful this time but in the most perfect way. He saw white, back arching before he fell back onto the bed, limp, shaking, and panting, spent.
He sighed heavily, walking over to the wall and grabbing a chair, bringing it back over beside the bed. He took Sherlock's hand in his, his fingers brushing delicately over the sharply expose knuckles.
Sherlock felt gentle hands stroking the hair by his face, and could hear familiar humming. The body pressed up behind his felt safe and reassuring.
Katherine was twisting her fingers a little bit, looking sheepishly down and glancing at the boots of the other men and women. She looked up when John knelt down in front of her and she sniffled a bit, not entirely sure it was just her cold. She nodded, "Mhm...take care of Daddy," she said quietly, wrapping her arms around his neck and held onto her. "Mmlove you Papa..." she said quietly, holding herself tightly to him and also moving quickly to wrap her legs around his middle as well, effectively holding herself onto him.
John wished he shared Sherlock's confidence, but he didn't say anything to contradict him. He hated the thought of Moriarty showing up again, but if that was what it took to get rid of him... then he guessed that was what had to happen. "Of course," he said softly, kissing Sherlock softly once more before reaching out for the shampoo.
Sherlock felt his stomach drop when Mindy mentioned his bondmark, her hand falling to rest on it. He swallowed, a lump forming in his throat. He knew that what he had done had almost destroyed John, but if he hadn't done it then it would have completely destroyed him. He let out a breath, looking down, his face warm with shame.
Katherine blinked a few times, sniffling again and clearing his throat. "Think should kiss and make up," she said simply. "Thas what Gran said about people on telly. Need kiss and make up," she said with a nod. She turned sideways on John's lap and rested her head against his shoulder. "If him being gone made Papa sad... will Papa be happy now?" she asked, looking up at him. She wanted him to look like in that picture.
Sherlock held onto Katherine‚Äôs hand as john said his goodbyes, hugging Mindy and Harry both as they left and followed John out of the flat, promising to keep in touch, and visit. He climbed into the cab and settled down next to John. He sighed, "Just another chapter, after this...it's just us," he mumbled quietly, nuzzling against John's jaw lightly.
Katherine stood up, leaving her dolls and climbing onto the sofa with John. "Don't be sad Papa," she said quietly, leaning up to kiss his cheek. "Going be okay," she said. She sniffed once, "Daddy's sick...needs doctor," she said, gently poking John‚Äôs chest.
John smiled back, returning the kiss just as softly as it was given. "Alright, love. You know I just worry about you." He took Sherlock's hand, leading him back to the bed and crawled into it, leaving plenty of room for Sherlock beside him.
Sherlock opened his mouth in protest when John yanked his phone away. "Hey!" he said, meeting John's gaze.
"Will you still be here when I get back?" John asked quietly, pulling back to gaze at the Omega. He wanted Sherlock to say yes, of course. But he couldn't blame Sherlock if he ended up leaving.
