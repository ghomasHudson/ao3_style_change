art, the consequence of imagination and intuition and a gift for creating mathematical models that only a computer can imitate. It's a futurist's game. He plays it with the best.
"Say it again, Tony," she says, and he realizes she's already starting to fade away. Discussion over, just like that, because one more person decided to walk away. "And call Jim," she adds, her voice the only part of her left. "He doesn't deserve this."
Or maybe not. Happy had a briefcase with him; the briefcase is now gone. Maybe this was all industrial sabotage. Who can say. Tony can't.
NB: Sure thing. Let me grab a cup of coffee for her, that girl lives on caffeine. Can I get you something?
He drops his forehead into the palm of his hand and thinks about terminal solutions. Dennis Kellard, Yasin Renada, and Jackson Norriss had all been part of the Ten Rings cell that had held Tony hostage in Afghanistan. Norriss had filmed the ransom video sent to Stark Industries; Kellard and Renada had done worse. Andrei Gorlovich would probably be next—he'd been the one to personally put a bullet in Yinsen—and while in the abstract their deaths meant nothing to Tony, he was very rapidly breaking down under the strain of being forced into the role of executioner. Knowing that he was under someone else's control was terrifying. The time loss reminded him of the blackouts he'd used to have before he stopped drinking, and the lack of autonomy was enough to make him scream until his voice blew out.
He has to be better than this. "I'm going down to liaise with the Omaha Police Department, maybe interview the survivor. It shouldn't take long."
Although it may be an inconsequential detail, I was informed that Director Stark shut off security cameras and spent approximately thirty minutes in the cold storage cell in which Captain Rogers' body was being held.
, just the novelty woman who contributed to the legacy of the great Tony Stark. You like talking to satellites with your brain? You like having the reflexes of an Olympian and the heart of a super-soldier?" Her snarl turns to a sneer. "You wouldn't even know any of that was
When Maya grabs at him, he tries to duck; but she's fast, so impossibly fast, fast like Steve was fast, or maybe it's just that Tony's slow, that he's tired and old and the blows that feel like taps take him like a train wreck. She catches him by the hair and forces his head back until his back bows and his knees bend; the bare line of his throat is laid shivering and sensitive for her teeth. He can no longer remember his watchword.
Or maybe he's kidding himself. Those moon dreams were survival dreams, too—at first, in the early days when the Fermi paradox was still debated, a race to populate other planets before humanity destroyed itself, and later, after the Kree and their alien kin were more widely understood, a race to populate other planets before other planets destroyed humanity. It wasn't invasion but expansion; there was room out there for humans, too, and even expansion was no guarantee of survival. Tony had heard stories of the Korbinites.
"Yeah, yeah." Rhodey shoves against him. Tony shoves back. It's all very comfortable, maybe more comfortable than he deserves, but his friendship with Rhodey has always been characterized by a wildly inappropriate lack of boundaries.
STARK: Hey, she said 'most difficult,' not 'worst.' Deep, right? Have I mentioned that he hides the TV remote?
registry. I didn't hack it. I didn't steal the information." Her breath whispers against where his ear should be, and she says: "It was legal, and
"Do you?" Steve rocks back. You could cut glass on his jaw. Tony's always been hard-pressed to name a favorite feature, but that jaw—the straight strong line cutting into the jut of his chin, the notch at the corner, the crook leading to the soft skin of his throat. Tony had more than once caught himself physically listing towards Steve to press his face there. What stopped him was the knowledge that Steve would recoil. He'd be
is that Tony spent his life thinking he was wed to the country, the company, the bottle, the design, and then comes this upstart in star-spangled mail—
"Your problem," Steve says, "is that you're an optimist who thinks he's a cynic. It's a dangerous combination."
"Business?" Steve echoes. "Seems like you've had a lot of business lately." That's Steve all over: relentless in a way Tony appreciates, because Steve has expectations, because Steve never cuts Tony any breaks and because Tony doesn't deserve to be cut breaks. Behind Steve, in the kitchen, Carol has one arm hooked over the back of her chair as she slouches flirtatiously in Rhodey's direction. It's working; Rhodey's looking at her like he looked at the repulsor-accelerated canon Tony welded to the War Machine last month, like he can't wait to find out all the ways she fires.
TS: There's two answers to that. Do I believe it's possible? Sure. We're already capable or on the cusp of capable of a lot of the things Maya mentioned.
The equipment is incredible. Where the hell did she get the funding? There's an atomic force microscope sitting in the midst of a blockade of other components, and it takes Tony a moment to figure out he's looking at a nanoscale 3D printer and another moment to realize it's more cutting-edge than any he's ever seen. God. Either her backers have deep pockets, or Maya has learned how to drag her head out of her single-minded pursuit long enough to think about malware. Although if she is stealing money, she's probably stealing it from Exxon-Mobile or Wal-Mart. Apple, maybe. Part of the reason Stark Industries is such a visible presence in consumer technology is Tony's insistance on fair labor standards, which means he hates Apple for both selfish and selfless reasons. He almost hopes she
"I'm not going," Tony repeats. "Not this time, Cap. Sorry. Friday and Doctor Brashear will have to handle recon for you."
Friday's eyes fall shut. Sometimes it's impossible to remember she doesn't see through them. After a moment they open again, still the most translucent blue he's ever seen.
STARK: Favorite Avenger? It's cheating if I say Iron Man, isn't it? Then I'll go with Captain America. Nobody can get mad at you for picking Cap—he's everyone's favorite. Don't tell War Machine I said that. Yep, go ahead.
Boynton doesn't say anything. The lines of his face pull tight—around his mouth, at the corners of his eyes, behind which sit the
"Systems can always be subverted," Reed says. "I believe they call it 'political science' for a reason."
Out of the water they drew him, a hero from a bygone age, clad in mail and armed with a gleaming shield.
The final indignity is sneaking half a mile through a cornfield on foot in the dead of night. He trips more than once. If he had one of the Stephen King novels from Maya's prison library, maybe he'd have a better idea of what was coming for him; or maybe he'd just be able to name the thing that comes out of the dark before it eats him. This isn't how he thought he'd go. What's he even doing here? If the sun were out, he'd be able to pick out the bulk of the helicarrier where he left it parked six miles over Nebraska. Unless Danvers or some other, less principled power had moved it, although either case is equally useless to Tony. But maybe if he can—if he—
Tony was eight when his father first poured him a single-malt bourbon and told him it would put hair on his chest. He was eight and he chugged it down like chocolate milk. It hit him hard and fast, his body too small to metabolize the ethanol, but it was worth fighting against his gag reflex for the granite approval on his father's face. He'd have drunk the whole bottle. He'd have drunk the whole cabinet. He'd have drunk until he vomited and seized and became cyanotic. It hit him hard and fast, that golden glow, and that's how he knows he was born an addict; what eight year old swigs bourbon like water?
"I… thought this or something like it was likely." He kicks his feet out, enjoying that he has two of them and that both are whole and intact; it's a bad idea to wander around down here without shoes, but Tony lives to walk on the wild side. The rest of his body is locked away in a box; you can do that with your armor if it's sophisticated enough. Thanks to Extremis, his connection to all those modular parts remains seamless although they no longer touch him.
He can't get the angle right, so he tugs up his pantleg and assesses the geometry again. In a few minutes, Maya's going to trigger a missile attack on the East Coast. His saving grace would be that he's safe in the Midwest, removed from Atlantic affairs no matter how anchored he might be, but in this What Is he'll die anyway thanks to Maya's taste for immolation.
God, she thinks again. Her hand strays to her side, to the mark snugged up against her ribs on the left. She keeps it covered with a digital bandage as a safeguard, but it isn't easily visible—not like Stevie's matching mark, which edges out from beneath her tank top to feather across her shoulderblade. Tony had always thought of her mark as a rotten, sucking blemish, but on Stevie she first notices the spray of silver stars so brilliant no ink could imitate it and then the unmistakable blue pearl that sits just on the edge of the void. Three colors, no red: Tony's very own black spot. She's protective of hers nonetheless, was protective of it even before they pulled Stevie out of the ice. Sometimes she finds herself standing with her arm curled up against her side to shelter it; sometimes she wakes to find herself curled in a ball around it. She hates it for being precious to her, but she guards it like an open wound nonetheless. There's an ache there like a scab that she'll never scrape away. It's
He's suddenly struck by the thought that someone should clean out Steve's room. He's suddenly struck by the thought that
If he'd had this data before, he could have folded it into his model in time to do something useful with it, but now he can only perform the kind of real-time calculations that make him infamous in the industry. Of course Steve thinks Tony is following some kind of higher ideal here; otherwise, Steve wouldn't even give him the courtesy of this conversation. He shouldn't feel proud. It isn't something to be proud about. And maybe Steve is right; but he's only right in the context of Tony's relativism. Steve thinks Tony is wrong for the right reasons. Tony knows Tony is right for the wrong reasons. That's the schism between them—maybe it's always been there, unpassable, impossible, absolute, the result of a divide in belief and character an atom wide but a light-year deep, the kind of fissure that isn't noticeable when you're standing above it until something new comes crawling out of the dark.
He's less quiet than he is distracted by the CNN feed blaring a breaking news update straight into his brain. Stark Industries stocks are still climbing. Hill is angry she was cut out of the loop. Kooning is breathing down his neck. And if he could only make the armor smaller, reduce its weight, figure out a way to make it fluid—
The kid gives him a long look out of dark eyes and then drops his gaze back to his screen. "A more interesting question is why you came here alone and defenseless, without the profanity of your armor. Someone stupid might accuse you of having a death wish, but I think that you really just want to save me. Poor Yinsen's son, made an orphan by terrorists. Maybe if I
Clint's expression turns a little mulish. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out his phone, and tosses it across the table to Tony. It's cracked. It's also dripping wet.
The reality is that you can't always change a causal chain; sometimes you can only change how you respond to it, and if you run up against limits in your range of responses, there's only one solution.
This isn't the first time Stark has claimed omniscience, nor will it be the last. Stark is a self-styled "futurist"—someone who tries to predict and prepare for what will someday happen. Even his detractors can't deny that he has an uncanny talent backing the winning side in the war of consumer electronics; he correctly predicted that Blu-Ray would win over HD, that Apple would not only make a comeback but emerge as a market leader thanks to the iPhone, and that haptic VR devices wouldn't be ready for wide release until well after 2005. It's characteristic arrogance when he suggests that that same talent can be applied more broadly; social trends are to DVD players as calculus is to figuring out much a coupon can save you at the grocery store.
"Thanks, Commander," Tony says. "I'll be in touch." The line goes dead before Tony can end it. A flat second later, it chimes again.
That fraction of a second is all the opening Rogers needs. He gets his legs up and jackknifes, catching Iron Man high in the chest. When Rogers comes up swinging, he's holding the shield again. The first swing takes Iron Man in the side. The second knocks him off his feet.
He's in the middle of an office block. If someone in that moment pinned him to the ground and stripped him of his clothes and made him walk back to New York, he couldn't feel more naked. If someone cracked his skull and dug their thumbs into the crevice and split his head open like an orange, he couldn't be more exposed.
His hands are trembling. He's gasping around the block of concrete in his chest. He manages anyway: extends his arm, opens his hand, wraps it around the neck of the bottle of Johnnie Walker Black standing on the counter to the left of the sink. The articulation of movement is transcendent: in his arm alone, a hundred thousand processes go into simply bending his elbow, closing his fingers, and compensating for the weight of a full bottle of grain alcohol. Muscle memory takes over from there. He can't stand upright unassisted, but he can twist off the cap, and when the whisky hits the glass, he remembers how to breathe.
Of course, as acting director, Stark is positioned to use the extraordinary legal liberties granted to the Director of SHIELD to continue furthering his own interests. There is, of course, Prison 42, the extra-dimensional supermax facility whose construction was contracted out to Stark Industries. There's the persistent rumor of insider trading, although Stark claims that the legalization of the Registration Act and his company's concurrent surge in stock prices are a mere coincidence. There is even the concern that Stark might use SHIELD's vast reserve of exotic technology to fuel a grotesque habit of body modification that at this point is less an experiment and more a fetish. None of these should be considered in isolation.
Twelve days have passed since the Superhuman Registration Act was signed into law, and the current stalemate shows no signs of breaking. Steve Rogers, long the most visible opponent of the SRA, has been a fugitive since SHIELD agents issued him notice that he must comply with the new legislation or face arrest. In his absence, the streets of New York City are alight with a tension only aggravated by the heat of summer, the foreboding and highly visible presence of SHIELD's new "cape-killer" units, and the PR blitz coordinated by pro-Registration figureheads that blares from every TV, radio, and laptop.
So Howard took him to the shooting range; he clapped the earmuffs on Tony's head, he slid the too-large glasses with their yellow lenses on Tony's face, and he put the big revolver in Tony's hand. "Like this, Tony," he said, and he showed Tony how to load bullets in the cylinder. That first time the range was vacant of anyone who wasn't a Stark, and when Tony lifted the muzzle and clumsily aligned the sights, he did so in complete silence.
The security on the building isn't even very good. He'd expected better of Maya, although with the kind of funding she was likely pulling out of her ass, she had the freedom to bury her attention in what she really cared about. Site security was for lesser mortals, and nobody could focus like Maya could focus. Her single-mindedness made Tony's engineering fugues look like well-tended gardens of emotional intelligence and social receptivity.
Steve's mouth twitches briefly—Tony's glancing sideways under the cover of his hand—before it settles back into the flat line of tension. "What'd you want to talk about?"
Stark's support, meanwhile, is what guarantees success with both the country's citizens and with the superhero community. I agree that he is a polarizing man, but he enjoys a broad popularity and a keen understanding of political maneuvering and the importance of public image. We cannot lose him. Richards will no doubt defect to his family before long, and Van Dyne is uninterested in a leadership role. Col. Jackson will continue to work to bring Pym back to the fold, but although he has written enthusiastically in support of our cause, I suspect he will remain, for the time being, retired.
She's in the visitation room when he arrives. They have her chained to the table; he isn't sure why.
The worst quality of Tony's, the part he tried desperately to cut out, was that he wanted to be special in Steve's eyes. He had no right to be jealous, to think he had any right to Steve's time or Steve's attention or Steve's regard, knew that he was fortunate to have Steve's friendship full-stop. But he wanted that last moment kept private, not shared with two and a half million people. God, that was selfish.
Here's how he solved the problem: mounted amongst all that machinery is a block of metal. Every time Rhodey fires, certain mechanisms sheer off a nanometric fragment of that block, and then specialized repulsors accelerate the fragment to a lethal velocity. Rhodey can adjust the size of the fragment, or the speed of it. Tony hasn't found much use for it in his own iteration of the Iron Man, but that doesn't mean there aren't other practical applications—what if he used the same concept to propel, oh, a temporary paralysis agent, or chaff, or some other kind of countermeasure?
TS: That depends on your definition of natural. It sounds arrogant, I know. The thing is, we're already moving in that direction whether we realize it or not. We might as well give it a name and try to keep a hand on the steering wheel.
Amidst the Registration controversy, Rogers might the only one still doing his duty. His former comrades seem too busy fighting each other to remember their original purpose; service has yielded to jingoism, opportunism, and empty rhetoric. No Avenger's descent has been more dramatic than that of Tony Stark, a founding member of the team and the current head of the Stark Industries conglomerate. Stark is perhaps best known as the hero Iron Man; after being kidnapped and held overseas by a terrorist organization for three months, he returned to the United States, donned his powered suit of armor, and appointed himself a champion of the people. More recently, Stark went public with his identity and revealed that the previous cover story, in which he claimed that Iron Man was a Stark Industries employee serving as his personal bodyguard, was a fabrication.
as a civilian. Unarmored and unarmed, no safeties and no safety. There's something hard curling at Maya's lips, something sated but not satisfied. Her shortcut had been first in covertly providing the Extremis enhancile to a criminal element so she didn't have to wait the years necessary for legal approval and second in calling in her old friend Tony Stark to track down the thieves who had purportedly stolen her project. In other words, she had wanted to test the Extremis enhancile on humans, and then she had wanted to test the Extremis-enhanced humans against someone who could put up a good fight. Tony, in the end, had filled both roles.
"Please," Tony counters, "you know I'm the ringmaster." This is absurd. They both know he isn't going to D.C. for the dog-and-pony show, but Dugan isn't going to say it, and Tony sure as hell isn't going to say it, and Friday for once is keeping her mouth shut, so they're stuck in this fucking circular conversation until one of them breaks and cuts the line.
"Clear the mind, engage the senses," Tony coaxes. "I can probably even come up with a pot of coffee."
On the coffee table behind him is an old General Electric RBD receiver and TCX transmitter set-up. He has newer, smaller, sleeker equipment that could perform that same function, but he dug this out of storage anyway. Broadcasting any message would be the equivalent of declaring that he'd cracked their code; even if he hadn't yet, Cap would know that it would only be a matter of time—days, not years. On the other hand…
STARK: Bingo. Extremis… well, more or less, it instructs a body to treat itself as a wound and rebuild itself from scratch, in whatever way we require. The objective is programmed into the enhancile prior to administration, and then after a couple of days of blinding agony, your end result is a human with accelerated regeneration, or the lung capacity of an Olympic athlete, or an innate resistance to dementia. Anyone else? Oh, hi. Yeah, go ahead.
It's after midnight when the elevator regurgitates him into the common living area. There's a low murmur of voices that he takes first for a conversation and then, when he catches the signal with Extremis, recognizes as the TV. Steve is there, on the couch, one bare foot propped up on the coffee table and an open sketch pad on his knee, although he isn't drawing. He has the glazed, directionless stare of a man wholly absorbed in late-night television.
"You didn't think it through, Tony," Steve continues. He's relentless in the slow way of massive things. With a long enough lever, Tony could use his shoulders to move mountains.
Friday rides along in his pocket, still managing to whisper in his ear because his own deficiencies are counteracted by her grace. "Should I contact anyone?" she asks, and Tony says no. Who would he even contact? Who would believe him? All he wants is to crawl back into his coffin, but instead he's out here taking responsibility.
In another world, Tony is fucked. He falls in love hard and fast. He falls in love because he doesn't have any choice. He feels a deep well of romantic affection for a number of people, some of whom don't even shoot him in the spine before they abandon ship; but his love is packed away somewhere internal, in a hollow cavity no one can touch, and he uses lovers like scalpels to carve a path to that void. He falls in love because he doesn't have a choice, and like a boat that can only carry so much weight before it sinks, he falls in love once in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and thereafter only when he can safely compensate for the additional ballast. He falls in love with his armor; he falls out of love with himself. He falls in love with Steve Rogers and binds that love to an anchor and drops it deep where it will never be found. He falls in love but never out of love. He is anchored still.
"I don't," Tony says. "I'm still an alcoholic. I did a lot of things I'm not proud of under the influence. But here's the thing—I did a lot of things I'm not proud of while sober, too. Iron Man was always supposed to be an opportunity to be better than I was. When I had a secret identity, though, it sometimes turned into an excuse. Not that I ever needed an excuse to dodge responsibility, but—you get the idea. It meant I didn't have to own my actions, and for an alcoholic, that's as bad as a relapse."
"Ha ha," says Tony, and then he bats Steve's hand away. He has trouble with this sometimes, when he's not ready for it, when his defenses are low: Steve's regard undoes him. To distract both of them, he flips the TV over to CNBC. He can pull a live feed of the stock index, but watching the tickers scroll across the screen is ritual. Almost nothing bores Steve more quickly than being forced to think about business finance. Steve has the head for it, understands why it's important, can even fathom a measure of enthusiasm if it's required for something Avengers-related, but on the whole he is deeply and aggressively disinterested in market equilibrium and margin buying.
"Right. Pass whatever information you can along to Captain Marvel. Carol, I'm about three minutes behind you. Keep your eyes peeled. Forty-three at large."
In an unprecedented demonstration of influence, Tony Stark has been appointed head of the Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage, and Logistics Directorate.
"Thought it was the other way around," Friday says. Today Friday is played by Norma Jeane Mortensen, herself a badly-misunderstood addict unable to orchestrate the performance of her own life. She and Tony, they're both bombshells, they're both tick-tick-ticking away until the grand swell of the finale.
Tony was always careful, he'd been so careful, he'd never looked twice at another boy because when you like girls too it's easier to like girls. Even if you fucked a man, you didn't fall in love with him, because… he used to know the answer. You didn't fall in love with another man, because real men didn't. That craven, hot shame that rose from his father looking at him and
"He wanted the kid Uther would have with Igraine," Tony says. "He wanted Arthur. So Merlin gives Uther the likeness of the Duke of Tintagel, and Uther rides to Igraine in the night and, looking like her husband, he rapes her."
STARK: That comes with the territory. You try fighting off Kang the Conquerer with a guy and not ending up friends with him on the other side.
The cost of maintaining a single suit of Iron Man armor is astronomical, but it's the rush of piloting it that's priceless. He used to get the same feeling as a kid on roller coasters, had gone through a phrase where he thought he'd design roller coasters for a living, had gone through a phase where he actually
Okay, look, the business with Hammer was—it wasn't ideal, and I cannot deny that, but I took action because the tech Hammer was disseminating was dangerous. It had consequences. I did what I thought was necessary to save lives.
There are a few loose pages tucked in the front, covered with all the sketches you'd expect: skylines, studies, little cartoons in the margins. A half-finished dress almost certainly copied from a Van Dyne design. The shield, and then a series of stars that grew progressively more regular. Nick Fury, looking surprised, cigar falling out of his mouth. The Avengers logo, crammed into one corner between a series of tires and the same lampshade Tony had just straightened. He flips to the very end of the sketchbook and then, startled, works from back to front. This can't be right, but the proof is undeniable.
"Good call," Tony says. They return to the elevator, Lila running ahead, Tony and Rhodey in lockstep behind. "How long's she staying?"
There's an engineering function called a bathtub curve—a decreasing slope describing early failures, a gentle leveling for the random failures that occur even in a product's prime, and then a steep rise as the product reaches the end of its lifespan. There are ways to flatten a bathtub curve, extend the sweet spot, anticipate failure; stress screening can reduce infant mortality, all those early failures of a system; exotic materials and construction techniques can lengthen the lifespan; a very gifted engineer—an engineer like Tony—can begin to account for some of those 'random' failures with the intuitive foresight a mere computer can't match. If you look at the entire system of superheroes as the product—
"Did we ever what?" she says, and her tone is even sharper than her glance, it's granite, it's glacial. "She's my best friend. We aren't like
"It's not too late to end this," Tony says, right on the edge of begging. "I can get you a reduced sentence, make sure your family can visit—"
He can build a hundred, now a thousand, in a day, a What If for every branching decision he encounters, a What If for every idle thought, a What If for every desperate dream. Most of them are pointless, helpful only as thought exercises. Some of them are not. He played What If, and funded the Avengers; he played What If, and built the second through thirty-seventh iterations of the Iron Man.
himself for the first time, did he realize how censored his mother's tales were. The romance in the source was balanced by a kind of thoughtless brutality that other people might have excused as being 'of the time.' Tony didn't like that excuse, but there was still something there that drew him back to Malory, whose work was far from the earliest but who still loomed over everyone who came both before and after.
Critically acclaimed documentary maker Jackson Norriss was found dead in his cabin retreat early Monday morning.
SR: That's right. I was trying to sneak back into our HQ one night through some alleys when I turned the corner and almost walked into the back-end of a jeep. Someone had the hood open and was banging around in the engine. Figured he was American—
"Good thing I like you back," Tony says. "Even if you do make discouraging remarks about my youthful virility. That's slander, I could sue."
He doesn't even have to have the armor. If someone's cracking his mind, all they have to do is send an instruction for him to poison Steve's breakfast. There's half a dozen household products that would work, and Tony has the makings of half a dozen more in his workshop. Methanol, drain cleaner, dimethylmercury. He probably has some antidepressants stashed away that would do the trick in high enough dosages.
"Hi, Tony. Sleep well?" Steve asks, because unlike the What-If Steve who shared Tony's bed, he has no other way of knowing if Tony is working through a bout of insomnia that could jeopardize the whole team.
"Give me signal noise from the time you recorded me falling asleep to time of death," Tony says. "Good. Pull out the cell phones—scratch that, bring those back. Map it against projected sleep cycle." It's still too much data.
"But the cost in event of failure—come on, Stretch, that's high, too. Higher than we can afford, if we haven't managed to account for all the major factors."
"Please," she adds. Her eyes open. She keeps talking like she isn't crying at all, neither acknowledging nor conceding to the wet trails on her face. "You should go. You have a meeting, don't you?"
"Low-profile," Friday says. "Heroes, but nobody you'd immediately notice was missin'." Her holographic self takes a turn around the table and stops to gaze at the body laid out there. There's nothing coquettish about her posture, which instead suggests the bearing of a field marshal. She ignores the muffled thumping coming from the other side of the hatch.
TS: I'm an engineer, let's leave it at that. Don't tell me you're thinking of writing a book about the Avengers.
Regarding our other project: this could also be a solid step towards ensuring its completion. The data we've mined is by itself priceless. In fact, I consider the application secondary to this new information. A competent lawyer will have no trouble convincing a jury that everything we've done here is completely legal, which of course it is now even if it wasn't when we started.
Two hundred days ago, he almost choked Steve to death. He was being controlled by someone else at the time, but he still remembers what it felt like to crush Steve's trachea. It felt a lot like this. It felt exactly like this.
He wastes a precious second absorbing the involuntary twitches racking Steve's body that tell a story of suffering.
"You know exactly what I'm implying, Shellhead." Steve lifts his hand and pretends to knock his knuckles against Tony's forehead. "No echo. You've still got something in there."
"Fantastic." The corners of the room are intrusively empty. No one's standing just over his shoulder, either, although he still feels the weight of a titanic regard nonetheless. What he wants, what he really wants, is to turn himself off and sink back into a bed, not because he's been rendered unconscious but because he chooses to shut his eyes and sleep. He even knows which bed he'd pick; that's an easy What If, simple enough for Tony to construct even though his mind is pulled apart like taffy. Good thing he doesn't need to sleep anymore.
At 6:03:02, Steve drops from a rooftop and sprints forward. There are other people with him; Tony can't process their faces.
More than one shrink has tried to suggest that Tony has a pathological dependence on the armor. What they fail to understand is that it's the other way around: Iron Man has a pathological dependence on Tony Stark.
He hasn't touched Steve for two hundred days. The last time he touched Steve, he was trying to beat him to death because the Mordred of the twenty-first century found a backdoor pass into Tony's brain and hijacked him body and soul. Tony cracked Steve's collarbone, tore off his ear. Crushed his trachea. That Steve isn't dead by Tony's hand is a function of blind awful
He hauls his pants up over his underwear, buttons the fly, and then digs around under one of the worktables for the old pair of boots he keeps there. There's a jacket tossed over one of his drill presses that will have to do for the rest of his attire; he doesn't have time to turn himself out. "What about the trigger?"
, just to avoid the growing terrible suspicions that take root in his head. He gets a thought in his mind and he just—can't—let—go—
"The plane was losing altitude and speed quickly when it hit the ground," said Morel. "There was a large hole torn in the side of the fuselage, as though someone had peeled it open."
It was raining when they laid Steve Rogers to rest. Maybe this time it'll stick. We've thought him dead before, and he took us by surprise. I hope he gets his rest this time, though. He deserves it. He may not have had a good death, but he had a good life—not a perfect life, but if St. Peter doesn't punch Cap's pass through the gates of heaven, then the poor sorry sons of bitches he left behind don't have any hope at all. We're still stuck out here in the rain, but you can take comfort in this: if Steve Rogers were here, he'd be arguing and shivering and soaked through and miserable right alongside the rest of us, too.
"Deep breath," he tells himself, and then he presses the laser cutter up against his Achilles tendon, angles the handle downward, and actives it. His heel severs neatly, a diagonal bisection that causes his calcaneus to drop off and fall to the floor. The cuff drags on the open wound as Steve guides it over his foot. It's a good thing he's wearing his armor, or that would've hurt.
"What I'm getting at, handsome, is that you're abusing your position as Captain America. This is not a bloodless conflict, but it would be less bloodless by orders of magnitude if you hadn't dragged every twenty-something with a knack for heroics and a poster of the Avengers on their bedroom wall into
"Of course it's a trap," Iron Man counters. "All I want is the answer to one question, and then you get to decide how this plays out. Come peacefully, comply with the law, and you'll receive a full pardon."
"Not much they can do for you that you can't do for yourself," Friday says. "Jack Kooning wants to meet as soon as you're able. He's waiting in one of the hospital meeting rooms. I took the liberty of having a suit sent over."
HO: Toni Ho. Mr. Stark, if the Extremis enhancile is truly capable of curing diseases like cancer, how soon will it be made available to the public?
"It's equally true that not every person who adopts an alter-ego to fight criminal elements is up to the challenge or even worthy of taking part in the tradition. America's leaders have a responsibility to make sure America's heroes are deserving of the name. The legislation enacted by this subcommittee ensures that we as a country are taking the best possible care of our peacekeepers and our citizens."
In the What If of a perfect world, he's flushed and happy when he lands on the roof of Avengers Mansion. Steve is waiting, and Tony is happy; he flew for the sheer hell of it, in that perfect world where the armor is only wings and never a ballast. In the What Is of an imperfect world, he slides behind the wheel of the Bugatti Veyron, locks the doors, and starts the engine; he'd take a deep breath, but the sound of the engine is better.
"I can't promise that, Potts. No, look—I'm serious." He looks up at her, at the famous Pepper Potts, who even in four-inch heels barely comes up to his chin, who wears a pantsuit the way Tony wears the Iron Man. Once upon a time, he thought he could fall in love with her. He thought they could balance each other, that they'd be good together. He was wrong. It's not a regret now; he has Pepper in his life, he realizes it was fallacious to make one person into his everything, it's a mistake he's made more than once but at least this time he's making it with clear eyes.
Here's the magic of being a futurist: you never meet anyone like you. You might meet brilliant men and women, intellects who plumbed the depths and soared to the heights of the universe, visionaries who could shape the world around them; but only very, very, very rarely would you meet someone who understood what you understood in the way you understood it. Genius was helpful, yes, vision was necessary, there was the required balance of blazing optimism and blind pragmatism, but—
, to do the same thing to the rest of us. Flaw in the human code? Fix it. Patch it. Reprogram it. Make it
, but Tony Stark has only transition. He passes from one side of the stage to the other, bathed in light, capable of holding the attention of the entire audience on him, dazzling enough that he can make them forget that behind and above and below is only the dark. Tony can't forget. Tony doesn't have the luxury of forgetting.
They're parked six vertical miles from Manhattan. The skyline isn't what it was when he was a kid; he sees it now with the eyes of an adult, the terrible knowledge of someone who understands negative space. The Iron Man is built around an absence.
, but Reed's playgrounds are interdimensional physics and cosmic flow theory. For all that, though, the whole spectrum of emotion is as much a mystery to Reed as it is to everyone else. Grief is unfathomable.
"Done," she says. "No more Registry. There's a reasonable facsimile in its place, but it won't hold forever."
It's too clean to link Stark's support of the SRA directly to some money-making scheme, but it wouldn't be the first time his good works were nothing more than a cover for his personal interests. Prison 42's contractor is a coincidence on the order of Stark Industries' recent stock market performance—in other words, it isn't a coincidence at all.
"Do you really think I could love you, Tony?" Steve says, and oh how Tony wants, in that one moment he feels every moment of every hour of every month of every year of yearning, all the sweet bitter aching devotion he's ever felt for Steve, all the hopeless desperate hunger that he packed down deep.
He's tired. He's so tired, but he doesn't sleep anymore, doesn't need to sleep. Sleep is an outdated function. Tony is something new, something better, he can be better, he does better, he takes responsibility. Tick-tick-tick-boom. He has to take responsibility, because he's finding it increasingly difficult to remember why he cares about all of it or about any of it. The universe is vast and immense and dying a slow heat-death and humans think they're impressive for having lasted as long as a sneeze and did it really matter? Steve thought it mattered. What if Steve was wrong?
"Need any help, gentlemen?" he says, as though he doesn't know what's happening here, as though he isn't the head of the world's foremost intelligence agency, as though he weren't the architect and master of what is currently playing out.
TS: Ah. Do I believe it's the right path? Absolutely. But with limitations. We have to figure out an ethical framework before we jump into the deep end and start building better people.
The idea that Tony is some noble savior taking on this burden to protect his friends is a What If he disallows. He strikes it from the record. It's sloppy and inaccurate; Tony is building a better world for his own selfish ends. There's no other truth to be had.
He starts to dive, dropping his airspeed and his altitude simultaneously. He's still flying well above Mach 2, but he can't keep traveling twenty-eight hundred feet per second while he's buzzing Manhattan. His fault—he was flying subsonic when Friday alerted him to the problem. Or is that better? He can make it to DC in less than ten minutes no problem, but he was taking his time, using the flight to work through his agenda for tomorrow's briefing with Maria Hill and draw up some outer dimensional schematics for Project 42.
Why the high cost? While it's true that a prison designed to hold superhumans has to be superhumanly strong, the main money sink is Prison 42's location. Instead of being built on American soil, Prison 42 is in the Negative Zone, ostensibly to "provide a buffer region between Earth and Earth's most serious threats." The industry expert on extradimensional construction? Stark Industries.
The cabinet's empty, but it wouldn't be hard to find libations if he wanted to find libations. The tower is full of temptation; there's whiskey, wine, vodka, he knows a couple of his VPs keep their offices stocked with beer and cocktail mixers, he could find, he could manufacture, he could buy or steal—
He isn't interested in bonding with Hill, but he recognizes the benefits of keeping her on his side, so he swallows down a bitter pill of pride and gives her a show that feels no less artificial than his performance at the last HomeSec meeting.
? Was his deficiency so obvious it was written across his face at eight and seven and four? How could he hide it, when it was that plain? How could he purge it? What was so wrong with him, that even as a child people could tell—
) He takes the express elevator up to his penthouse suite. He exits the elevator. One of Pepper's assistants is waiting at the top with a very white demitasse of very black espresso; his name is Bill, probably, and his last name is something Polish, Tony thinks. That's a joke—the kid is named William Wozniack, which Tony has teased him about more than once, and Pepper hired him straight out of the Harvard MBA program. Before his graduation, even. His skin is dark and his hair is reddish, a whimsical coincidence that makes Tony wonder if Pepper is collecting an army of ginger-headed interns, and like everyone with regular access to Tony, Will the Woz has been thoroughly investigated through a dozen different avenues.
"How about a game?" Tony asks, and Friday, ever responsive, conjures a holographic chess board out of thin air between two stools.
Tony doesn't have time to think about telling them yes. He doesn't have the capacity. Really, when you think about it, the height of selfishness is contemplating the nightmare he himself created when Maya's here, building a better world at the expense of the present. It's the height of arrogance. Under better conditions Tony can think at teraflop speeds, can problem-solve at petaflop speeds with all the parallel processes of a Cray computer, but he isn't thinking clearly, and because he isn't thinking clearly, he doesn't see Maya until she steps out of thin air in front of him. She has a star caught in her hand, and when she swings her fist at Tony's head, he goes down like a sack of bricks.
"No, I'm serious," Tony says, sincere in his belief that his favorite fucked-up story is far more fucked-up than Steve's favorite fucked-up story. Steve prefers the term 'tragedy,' but they both know they're talking about the same thing. "Ulfius tells Uther about this guy called Merlin, and he promises Uther he'll track down Merlin if it's the last thing he does. So Ulfius goes off adventuring, and he finds an old beggar by the side of the road, and the beggar asks what Ulfius is looking for."
TS: In the strictly biological sense, yeah. Maybe even in the behavioral sense, figuring out ways to be kinder to each other, but the first one's a little more clear-cut. When you can improve quality of life, when you can take steps to ensure survival of the species, when you can open doors of discovery that were previously shut… don't you have an obligation to do that?
I can speak to the fact that it's bullcrap. Causation versus coincidence. Look it up. Go ahead, Ms. Tilby.
The most unstable element in this confrontation is Tony, and here's why: Tony is still hanging on to the delusion that they can solve this by talking. They haven't spoken since Steve backflipped out of SHIELD's mobile command center and declared war on the U.S. government, and Tony's delusion is firmly-enough rooted that he can't stop thinking that they can still fix this—that they can reach an understanding—that he'll explain himself to Cap, that they'll argue, that Cap will eventually come around, shake Tony's hand, stand beside him. He knows it's a delusion, but even self-knowledge can't excise his belief. It's the closest thing to faith he's ever felt.
"I gathered," Tony says. It occurs to him that he doesn't actually need the earpiece to talk to Friday anymore, but he leaves it on anyway. His brain feels like one big bruise. Apparently an Extremis-driven healing ability has its limits. So much for superior Stark wetware.
SR: Because of swearing, right. So I took off my jacket, straightened my helmet, and marched around to the front of the jeep to ask if the guy needed help. I dunno who was more surprised when we got a good look at each other, him or me.
He'd learned lessons far more complicated, but none that were more useful. Howard made Tony fire the gun until he could steel himself against the noise and the force of it; by the end of the day, they had used eight hundred rounds, and Tony was quivering not from anticipation but from muscle fatigue. Later, when he told that story, his audience tried to convince him that Howard had been pushing Tony too hard; but Tony didn't agree. His father had been a bastard, but he'd understood the way the world fit together, and that day at the range all he'd been trying to do was make Tony understand, too. It was, in the end, good advice, and Tony wrote it into his own personal code of chivalry.
. He never protested when Howard took him to the shooting range, for that reason and because Howard rarely bestowed attention of any sort; he also had the fascination of a child and of an engineer with force, and there wasn't much that Tony had encountered that was more forceful than a lump of metal propelled with explosive power at a thousand feet per second. He was young.
"Steve Rogers is an American hero," Ralston says. "If he won't compromise, then maybe this committee needs to reconsider its purpose."
Tony's in New York, a temporary retreat to lick his wounds. It's a moot exercise. Really he just needs a moment in the one place where he feels most like himself.
"Do you remember," Steve says—soft, glacial, inexorable— "Do you remember when you sat down in the snow and waited to die?"
He builds the best kind of What If. He starts with his hand, his right hand, so he can do the fine motor work with his left. The hand is an ideal test site: should any part of the process fail, he can replace his fingers or palm or the whole entire thing with a conventional prosthetic while he revises and replicates his process.
"Pepper—" His heartrate is rising again; he activates a biofeedback routine to suppress it. "Pep. You have—there's his living will, his power of attorney, you don't need me to—"
It's a good system. Pepper understands, and when she doesn't understand, she calls in one of the hundred brilliant innovators Stark Industries retains on payroll to help her understand. Resource management, that's Pepper's specialty. For all his sins and despite all his excesses, Tony is little more than one more resource. He's the best resource. Sometimes, he's the only resource.
The second thing is that about twenty minutes into the post-shitshow meet-and-greet, three men in dark suits arrive. They confer for a moment by the hors d'oeuvres. Two of them are wearing visible earpieces; beneath their suit jackets are pieces that are less visible. They approach Senator Boynton, who, with the unknowing blindness of a domesticated sheep, does not realize that what comes into the pasture are not dogs but wolves. The man without pieces says something brief to Boynton. There's a ripple of shock on Boynton's face—no, more like the pieceless man is the ripple and Boynton gets caught in the wake.
He rebuilt it almost from scratch, from the inside out, starting with the control center—that's Tony's brain—and ending with a long string of minute but critical adjustments to the exterior of the armor itself. No more hacking, no more unauthorized access, no more fear; he's still trying to cut back on his sleep, but without the release of an REM cycle every few days, the world begins to unravel at the seams. Happy wouldn't approve, but Happy is no longer a factor.
Senator John Boynton (D-NY) has been awarded numerous accolades: the Congressional Gold Medal, the Wallop Howard Leadership Award, the title of Tony's personal nemesis. He doesn't know he and Tony are nemeses, but that's fine; Tony has always been more than capable of constructing a narrative without any awareness from the other involved party.
Nobody suspects. He doesn't hint around it. You'd have to be an expert on the subject of Tony Stark—you'd have to have made a study of him, you'd have to have watched him, you'd have to have loved him absolutely to understand the subtle, intricate pattern of behavior that sketched the shape of all the things he hid. You would have to love him deeply, even when loving him hurt; and like all worthwhile endeavors, loving Tony would hurt very much. You would have to love him willfully and faithfully; and maybe, if you loved him long enough, if you made a study of it, you would begin to understand that nobody hated Tony Stark more than Tony Stark. It would be a long, thankless task, loving him like that; you'd have to love him broken heart and all.
"Trust me, Cap," he finally settles on. "Even if you didn't see this coming, I did. It's what I do: observe, predict, plan. You know what clued me in?" He laughs. It scrapes his throat raw. "Never mind, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Either way—better than the alternative."
If he and Friday can't figure this out before the twenty-four hour lockdown on his armor lifts, he has three options. Two options—he isn't going to put the Avengers in his line of fire.
and then he has to stop and touch his fingers to his lips to make sure the word didn't actually escape. Horrified, he spends the next two hours pouring over Extremis, checking the coding, checking himself. He isn't going through a bout of insomnia; he fixed that. It's been written out. Tony Stark 2.2 was rolled out last month. He sleeps exactly four hours a night and wakes without an alarm.
"I'm fine," Tony repeats, although the idea of a nap on the cot he keeps in a corner isn't as immediately
"Sure," Happy says, and he starts to amble towards the elevator. He's a stocky guy, not as tall as Tony but built like a boxer; there's something solid in him, something that makes him not only the most reliable but the most loyal person Tony knows. They met when Happy pulled Tony from the wreckage of an experimental racecar. That incident continues to set the precedent for their relationship.
STARK: Believe me, if he found it disrespectful, he'd let us know. He's not the kind of guy who sits on his objections.
Like the Red Sea parting for Moses, the crowd in Times Square scatters. All four tires on the truck holding Barton blow at once. Six escort vehicles skid to a halt, but it's already too late.
"No. Of course not." Tony thinks: god, he thinks: anything but this. He thinks: please, don't make me say it.
TS: Stop it. She's my Boswell, stop trying to charm her. He's serious when he says that, by the way.
If he leaves now—this is something Tony grasps intuitively, one of those on-the-fly calculations that pass for instinct—if Steve leaves now, that's it. This is the last opportunity; this is their Rubicon, and if one or the other of them crosses out of the room without reaching some resolution, they're never again going to be what they once were. Not the country, and not the Avengers, and not Tony and Steve, who were once friends and partners and brothers-in-arms.
What can Tony say to that? There's no comfort here. There's no hope. The doctors have told them as much, feeding them lines like 'narrow chance' and 'slim margin' and 'make sure he's comfortable'. Tony's recent crash-course in biomedical engineering has left him with enough background to take them at their word. Happy isn't going to wake up and be well; they're in for years of this, a slow, marching progression of bedside vigils driven by the dream of a statistical improbability.
He can fathom a dozen explanations for that. Steve wants to see if he's really, physically present, not telecommuting while he plots in his high tower. Or: Steve wants to see if he's lying, wants to read the intent in Tony's expression. Or: Steve, never one to flinch from hard truth, wants to look into the eyes of the traitor one last time. Not numbered among these is anything close to the purity of Steve merely
Friday tilts her head and considers. "Post-Extremis, you don't process the same way you did before. Makes sense that there's some glitches when you're thinkin' through new neural pathways."
Carol is saying. She can make it into the building. Natasha, Reed, and Jan will be outside. Steve had taken almost the whole rest of the roster with him when he went underground. That's fine; they'll rebuild. She-Hulk's probably in the plant already, too. Rhodey, while technically a current team member, has been put in the reserves while he's off drumming up support and building the Camp Hammond program. Rhodey not being here is fine. It's better for everyone; without Rhodey, Tony has to learn to walk unassisted.
He doesn't bother changing into pajamas of late—not, strictly speaking, that he ever did. These days, though, when Tony sleeps, he sleeps at regularly scheduled intervals, four hours every other day, and he sleeps stripped down to his underwear, usually on the cot in his workshop. When he's not in the country, he takes other measures, but on American soil, there's nowhere safer.
"Yes, sir," Tony says, as wooden now as he wasn't before Captain America's death thirty-four days ago.
Maya, desperate as always for recognition, rips Tony's communicator out of his ear. She takes part of the ear along with it. The pain hits him in a white-hot flash that eats away at his existence, that eats away at him even though part of an ear is nothing, certainly nothing that should hurt, absolutely nothing he should miss.
It shatters. Steve twists to the side. Tony deploys a localized flood of dry water that smothers the flames on the worker's leg, scoops the man up in an improvised hold that causes him to scream in animal pain, and heads for higher ground. Before he punches through the roof, he makes the mistake of looking down. Cap's lips are pulled back from his teeth.
Carol and Tony are within spitting distance of the same height—one of them a hair over six feet, one of them a hair under. The added height of the armor does nothing to remove that equity.
"No problem," Tony says. Cap starts wiping the counter down; the coffee mug is chipped, and she dumps it out and tosses both the mug and the chip in the trash. That's Stevie all over, always cleaning up the messes other people make. There's an equivalency there that Tony doesn't care to excavate. "Gonna make it up to me?"
"I have," Pepper says, "but Tony, I think Hill is going to take what she wants with or without our permission."
NB: The statistics are against him, but this isn't really a normal case. We don't run up against many of the…
BOWMAN: We've explored other options. This makes the most sense for widespread release. We can pursue more tailored applications later.
And then he'd had only the golden mail of the undersuit to keep him from being naked before them. There were so many people in the room, and they were all watching him, and he was sure he wasn't shaking because he'd coded that response out of himself, but they were all watching, because he'd said yes. "Do you have it?" Carstairs had asked, and then Agent Colletti, whose partner Tony had once met over dinner back when he still ate dinner, held up a gleaming golden circlet. "Right here," he'd said, and then he knelt in front of Tony.
The slacks follow the shirt, and a belt follows the slacks, and then he loops the tie around his neck and makes a neat half-Windsor snug against the valley of his throat. Last comes the waistcoat and the suit jacket. Thus assembled, he goes to the mirror, straightens his tie, and tries to remember if he ever felt anything other than dull contempt when studying his reflection.
"Because your sister grew up without the guidance of the one person who could understand her," Tony says.
"These are early days yet, Mr. Stark," says Senator Hawk. "Confidence may be warranted, but overconfidence is not."
"Listen, much as I'd like to see Jessica's reaction when someone calls her a weak point, we aren't that desperate yet," Tony says. "Whatever we do, assume it's going to leak to the press. We can't keep it quiet forever."
He flies alongside it sometimes—the R&D helicarrier. It's a behemoth, if not on the scale of Hill's headquarters, but fast for its bulk. Iron Man finds that it suits him. Stark Industries is no longer involved in the design and construction of the helicarriers, but they still hold many of the original patents.
"I'm burning down this building. I have what I need. No point in leaving evidence." She shrugs. "The charges are already set, and you—at this point, Tony, you're a shell. You're just evidence."
I'm offended you'd even ask that, some of my best friends are mutants. No, go ahead, laugh. Listen, in all seriousness, Project Wideawake was a misguided, speciest attempt to violate the rights of American citizens. The Registration Act doesn't care if you're human, mutant, metahuman anomaly, whatever. You are under no obligation to disclose if you have powers—or specialized training or equipment—
Socks and shoes accomplished, he collects a hat and then upon second thought retreats back to the bathroom to shave. Without the cover of facial hair, he almost doesn't recognize himself. He can't remember the last time he met his own eyes in a mirror. He can't remember the last time he
As always, I must begin with the disclaimer that this is merely a series of broad impressions. My contact with Director Stark has been limited, and there are only so many recommendations I can make without further violating the ethical standards of my field.
He retracts his gauntlet and gives Rogers his bare hand. There's a decade of history between them, and the impossibility of this moment gives way for one instant to the avalanche of that legacy. It's another scar, an imperfection in an otherwise perfect system, a cascading failure that is less a flaw than a certainty.
Steve sucks in a deep breath and then blows it out. "Sorry," he says. "Didn't mean to jump to conclusions. What's on your mind?"
Her fingers creep over the curve of the cuff and trace its edges against his skin. It's the first time in recent memory someone has touched him gently. He used to love her; she used to be family. The worst part is that he still recognizes her—still recognizes himself in her.
So Tony pours his glass of whisky down the drain. He doesn't lick that last amber drop off the rim. He pours the glass down the drain and then dashes the glass against the floor. It isn't a rational response. None of this is reasoned. It's instinctive—a last eulogy for Tony Stark.
If you watched the footage, you'd see Tony take his helmet off. You'd see him try not to breathe, try not to think, because thinking is what got him here. Thinking is the root of this whole fucking mess. Knowledge is the bait for the trap of the cage that he built himself. It's the anchor. It's the chain. And now he's stuck with the memory of something that used to blaze in his chest: a star made dense by grief and forewarning, a supernova collapse fueled by despair that crushes itself into nothing, nothing, nothing. He's left with nothing when that fuel runs out. There's a dense, black knot that sits behind the bone curve of his ribs which act as an event horizon beyond which no light can escape.
VP: You can touch, hear, all his life support equipment with your mind. He wouldn't have wanted this, Tony. You could turn it off. I would never know. It's what he'd want. There's no reason to drag this out and make him suffer.
"We've run as many simulations as possible, but even then, it's impossible to forecast with any certainty what the outcome will be. We can only exert so much control. You're right, of course, we may try and fail—but if we don't try, then the chance of failure is absolute."
"Anything similar in the other two instances? Never mind, I see the pairs. Son of a bitch. That's it, then."
It worked by overwriting the body's repair center with a new blueprint. That was what you customized: you could tell your body it was supposed to fix your hands so they had six fingers, or your immune system so perfume didn't make you sneeze. You could tell your body to fix itself so you healed faster, so you thought faster, so you reacted faster. You could tell your body to fix itself so you could breathe fire. Tony's contribution had been the customization. Maya said she had been building soldiers, but Tony had his own objectives.
Dugan asks. He has the leisure to ask that. Nobody expects Dum Dum Dugan to dress up in a suit and thank a pack of politicians for an opportunity he never wanted. That's fair. That's fine. Tony wears a suit better than anyone.
Here he is, in the cathedral of his workshop, the armor in front of him and Friday behind. "Give me a pattern analysis," he says. "Do we have times of death?"
Tony considers the sand in his eyes. He considers that unlike Igraine, he can always return to Tintagel. Friday has her own pursuits to keep her busy here in this cathedral, and the rest of the world is locked safely outside; Tony can follow his chain.
First, though, come the black trunks and the undershirt, this one clean and disconcertingly free of the scents of grease and metal, and then his socks, because Tony Stark is a traditionalist. Next is the shirt; he buttons up the front while he thinks about Camp Hammond but fumbles when it comes to choosing his cufflinks. He goes funny with them sometimes, because he gets a kick out of seeing kids light up because Tony Stark is wearing Spectrum socks or Captain America cufflinks, and that's great, it's a hoot, but today he picks out a somber silver pair instead and threads them through his cuffs, one-two-three, not a fumble in sight now that the difficulty of selection is behind him. He's been wearing clothing like this since before he was old enough to dress himself, and it shows in the way he holds himself in bespoke tailoring—he wears it like it's no different than a mechanic's jumpsuit, and people love it, people
Alison Blaire's upcoming album has had its release pushed back to December. Cash grab, or personal problems? Rumor says Blaire is in the middle of an extended stay at a rehab facility. No telling whether that album will be out in time to ring in the new year!
makes it sound like more of a problem than it is. He's heard the diagnoses. Major Depressive Disorder, that's comorbid. Alcohol dependence, however latent, is by this point simply a charming personality trait. Exhaustion isn't so much a symptom as a glitch. What distracts him are thoughts. Sometimes he gets an idea in his head, and he can't let it go.
solution would be removing Tony Stark from the system entirely. If someone's using him as a weapon, he can bury that weapon so far underground it never sees the light of day again. (The metaphor is imperfect; Tony's body will go first to Reed Richards for study, and then any remaining material will be cremated.)
He's circling the table now, going the long way around… trying to herd Tony away from his armor, maybe, or maybe just trying to intimidate. He paces past the door to the foyer, turns the corner, and starts down the long side that faces the library.
He can still call Hill. She's aware that something is amiss, that three high-ranking Ten Rings members turning up dead with the forensic signature of repulsor weapons means Tony Stark—surely she's made it that far. Hill is ferociously competent. He's surprised she hasn't tried to have him arrested. There's a chance she believes he's being framed, or maybe that someone else got their hands on RT schematics, but neither of those are reasonably likely. Tony is wildly, rabidly defensive of his technology, and the repulsor tech is the Arkenstone in his vast horde of invention. The shrapnel in his heart that was the genesis of the Iron Man was put there by a land mine he'd designed as a college student.
"Okay," Tony says. He's numb to it. Nothing can shock him anymore; this might as well happen. "Any idea where Hill went?"
Now it's all logistics, and Tony excels at logistics. For him the paramount concern will always be application, not
BOWMAN: They're more robust and therefore more likely to survive the transition. You can't harvest as much useful information from a corpse. And there's a greater variety in profile composition, too. Soon we'll be able to replicate all those abilities.
The view from up here is relentless. It's darker inside than it is outside; the suite is shadowed and cavernous, but the streets below are threaded with light and movement. They're so far away they seem like a toy, or a dream. Tony has that problem sometimes—he confuses dreams with dreaming. It's still easier to look at the city than it is to look at the reflection of his own face in the dark, liquid surface of the glass. He used to find Steve here, in the days after they'd reformed the team; Steve liked the view of the city, and he liked the big flatscreen with its enormous library of movies, and he'd liked being close to the kitchen, where the Avengers inevitably congregated.
"Right. There's a character named Giles Corey, being tortured to force him to confess to witchcraft—you remember?"
"Your reaction times are down," Steve continues, relentless like only Captain America can be. "You're distracted. Tired. If something is wrong—"
"Don't worry about it," Tony says. She has to reach out and untangle Stevie's fingers from her wrist and turn off the faucet herself. That sort of touch, the sparks it inspires, is more than she deserves. "Shouldn't have been standing here with the lights off anyway."
The man in the mirror has bags under his eyes, lines in his face that even one of the world's most advanced regenerative systems can't fix—all the signs are there, the hollow cheeks, the clammy skin, the bloodshot sclera.
