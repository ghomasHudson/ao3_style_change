“Which is good because knowing us, things will go catastrophically badly eventually. I still feel like an alien invasion is eminent.”
Tony: Is that the real reason why you’re so afraid of the Accords? You saw what the system did to those who were different back then and you don’t trust it to be better now?
Tony Potts: Actually, she already did that when she sent him here with me with lube, toys, and condoms.
“Not if we can help it,” Tony said with determination in his voice. “OK, next question, and it is apparently the opposite of what we were talking about earlier. Name your greatest accomplishments?”
StarkAE: I’m sure you could. Should you really be saying stuff like that from your work account? At least use your Avenger burn phone. Also Happy is not my driver, he is the head of security.
“Tony, I’m going to kiss you twice and then I’m sending you back to Sam to talk. You’re the one who wants the Avengers on speaking terms, when the aliens invade again, so you’re going to have to make some effort. The Avengers are more than just me.” Steve said as he opened the door only to find the last person he expected to see their.
Me: You’re so optimistic sometimes. It kind of makes me want to punch you in the teeth or push you up against the wall and have my way with you. It’s a weird either or thing.
Tony: And I’m trying to be serious. I am worried. I’m scared people are going to find you. I’m worried that we’re still too broken to handle the next world ending catastrophe. I’m also terrified that Spidey’s aunt knows the truth and she is going to kill me the moment I touch down in Manhattan.
DILF: Yes, he agreed to be the test subject. As you so eloquently pointed out, Deke and Simmons stole your work. The original plan was for Clint to go back to his farmhouse before the decimation and retrieve an object, but at the last minute, Deke went with him too.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I don’t entirely disagree. It was a version of your father that brought me to this timeline, but that’s because he needed my help. But I’ll be back soon. So that’s still no excuse for Connor hitting your dad. Tell him he’s grounded for at least the next two weeks. Ana, I expect you to institute the grounding protocol.
“Look I’m going to go get your luggage from the hallway. Don’t unpack because we will be switching hotels in the morning because I think you need some space to think about all of this. Then Monday you will show up to escort Stark to his various business meetings where you will try to ignore the fact that he will most likely be covered in bite marks.”
Also a reminder, it is election eve in DC, but Tuesday morning in Mumbai. That will be important for plot reasons.
Purple Princess 2018: Only Dad can contact her. Since she is deeply undercover at the FBI. She’s already caught a couple of dirty agents. Or I guess maybe Steve can contact her as well, even if the world doesn’t think he’s her stepfather anymore. I'll contact my dad after this and let him know. He's already worried about my all-night science bender, but it worked.
One potential difference from the prime timeline is I decided that Happy was a victim of the decimation. It felt weird to me that Tony didn’t lose either of his friends or Pepper. I had to change that.
Me: At the time, I thought it was bullshit, but I believe him now. People change. Life changes people. You have to embrace those changes because otherwise you'll be left behind.
HSBF: Well how did you write your first text message to me? If you could send that first message after how badly we messed up, then I think you can write to Pepper.
Nomad: I prefer to cook myself, but I do miss those 5000 thread count sheets. What is virgin drunk raspberry cheesecake French toast?
“Things are different,” Simmons remarked. “As we’ve just discussed. I’m not sure if Director Rhodes had to make full use of his new exoskeleton to knock May out because she became belligerent after “being touched by a ghost” as Yo Yo described it.”
Red Malibu: You know I’m head over feet for Stefan. I think Lily just misses you. It’s hard when your parents aren’t there. I imagine it’s worse when you know that your dad loves you and doesn’t see you as a prize show pony.
Me: It probably was always like this. Although I’m sure Virginia probably finds it less stressful this way.
“You should know that Agent FitzSimmons is currently in the elevator asking for access to this floor.” The AI told the group.
“I’m either going to be near Los Angeles or Washington DC with a small stop at the “Lighthouse” in upstate New York, before making my way to where ever Leo and team are. Although, I’ve heard good things about the Timber Pizza Company, if I do make it to DC.” She offered.
Girl Friday: I hope so too. I’m going to go sleep. That’s something that I need to do after the latest upgrade.
Me: Not seriously. It was an intellectual affection. I wanted his brains. You, I want everything. You’re my snuggle bear.
I’m happy I got to arrest those who tried to kill your boyfriend. Because of what happened, my detail to the ATCU is being curtailed and I’m back at the CIA. New Shield is better than the old Shield, but I prefer the CIA.
Chief mechanic: Which, judging by notes from the other timeline, was exactly what they were doing, but they were not entirely lying about the purple one, just manipulating the situation for their own purposes. However, the big boss won’t even let us set up a meeting with the SWORD people.
May: We’ll work something out with Kamala’s biological parents. I’m sure they’ll be grateful that we took good care of her while they were gone.
“Teenage years are overrated. I still don’t get why other me went straight to teenagehood.” Tony sighed. “He has a whole gaggle of teenagers.”
Anthony: OK, so do you remember when I told you about Ross taking Laura and Agent 13 helping me get her back?
“She is under my protection. Sometimes she likes to stay in the lab with me when I’m working. I’m sure you understand, considering Ms. Marvel and Spidey Junior live at the compound with you.” Things started to click in Tony’s mind at the Princess’s words.
Anthony: Not talking about it doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s my fault. I take responsibility for that because my actions led to that. However, your actions did not lead to Howard and Maria getting murdered.
Me: Horribly. It’s hard to find someone confident that could pass a security screening. I have batch two tomorrow and I may have invited Benjamin and Agent to watch. Okay, they’re invited to pull me out with a fake emergency when it starts to really go south.
I know you told me to call you Tony, but it doesn't feel right considering how I've acted the last few weeks. I’m sorry. I really don't want you dead. I know I said some terrible things, but I don't want that. I was mad about you telling your friend Coulson about me and the fact that you’re not available to date my aunt and 100 other things, but that doesn’t mean I want to lose another mentor.
Me: I masturbated to your propaganda posters. If you thought Coulson’s costume was tight, you should’ve seen how they drew your propaganda posters. It was more porn than propaganda. Nothing was left to the imagination.
Me: I’m fine doing that if you and I could make one together. Maybe for LGBTAQ teenagers so they know that they’re not alone. That there are people just like them under the mask saving the world.
Anthony: Okay, somebody posted images of me visiting Dr Suarez’s office in Midtown and apparently that is quelling Wall Street’s worries.
“OK, definitely a positive quality, but I want more. Tell me what you love about me.” Oh shit, he didn’t mean to say that out loud. “I mean, tell me what’s great about me. I say stupid shit when I’m sleep-deprived. I think I  got about six hours in the last three days because of trying to figure out how to do all of this.” When in doubt, blame sleep deprivation.
Football Hunter: Well, I can’t exactly tell her that I’m working with you. She’ll send me off to the loony bin at the very least. She’s mad at me for keeping secrets and not telling her the whole mission. Miss I never tell the truth doesn’t like it when you’re the one keeping secrets from her. I shouldn’t even be surprised. I’m done.
Me: Yes. Clint is an asshole. About an hour ago, the bastard served her with divorce papers and then went dark after all the work I put in getting him back in this country.
Red phone: Probably because they don’t know that. But I recognized it from the manifesto video alone.
Me: I wish I knew, but it’s really complicated. But I will say when you love somebody, even if that love is platonic, you will make very questionable decisions to keep that person safe.
“Laura has always been good with kids and wayward superheroes. It’s good she found a job combining the skills even if it’s in another timeline.” Clint looked down to see Natasha standing in front of him or rather the vent that he was hiding in.
MJ: Although, I thought they weren’t actually married. It was a cover identity. I always knew time travel was possible.
The mechanic: Yes, actually, but the Princess will be here soon. We are going to work on making my daughter ashamed of walking in on her other father and me, with Wanda’s help, possibly. I feel like shame of one’s parents is a significant part of being human. Or maybe that was just my childhood.
Tony: So by Thanksgiving I will sit down with Pepper Pot and discuss my options for taking a break from SI to serve my country and getting me the hell away from the board because my heart and my sobriety demand it.
Boss: Who apparently doesn’t stand a chance against Cuddle Bunny stubbornness because he wouldn’t be in this fucked up situation right now if he could. I doubt Cuddle Bunny even realizes that he’s saving those kidnapped by terrorists because he could never save Bucky Bear.
Me: Especially because I now know that Agent Scary was the first agent assigned to babysit you and you slept with her. Not that I’m jealous about that because really, I’m not. (Message not sent.)
Me: I’m trying, my snuggle baby. I have a file filled with about 30 attempts of writing a letter to Pepper. It hasn’t gone well at all
Me: Speaking of emotional counters that probably required baked goods of some sort, was Clint with you when Agent Agent stopped by to save your ass? That incident probably would require at least three dozen bacon glazed doughnuts.
“Okay, I can understand in those circumstances, although why did Ana… Friday let you into my phone? I think only the head of Shield can get in. Although maybe the head of the Avengers could too. I’m not sure how Fitz set the permissions.” Laura explained.
“You know what I mean. Look, I know where I stand. If a building was burning and I could only save you or Rhodey, I’m sorry Buttercup, but I would go straight to Rhodey.”
Anthony: I have skills and a lot of preset words. Also, maybe Friday just knows what I really want to say.
Nomad: Well at least that will keep you distracted from worrying about your ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend.
“Yes. It’s hard to accept this all on faith. If you would’ve told me immediately instead of lying to me about it for the last six months, I would have found the situation more plausible. I mean, if I find myself back in the past, I would seek you out first.” Simmons said turning to Leo. “Instead, you went to Hunter.”
The Avengers that are left have resorted to time travel to try to get the stones because they were destroyed by Thanos in this timeline, so his masterpiece cannot be undone. I assume that Thanos is dead, but again I have no confirmation on that.
Me: Ridiculously hard, however, I know this song. The counselor has played me a lot of Prince music while we have been on the run. He said that song reminded him of me.
Tony: Still coming to get your ideas about the new records, but he might have to go back earlier than planned. Although for part two, only Agent May and Spidey senior are coming. Other May couldn’t get that much time off from work and actually trusses me with her child out of the country. Which is shocking after what happened last time.
This might be my favorite chapter. I find it deeply ironic that this ended up being in person conversation 13. It’s oddly fitting. This chapter takes place a few hours after the last one.
“It’s okay if you need to leave. I have Polly to talk to and my doctor. It will also give me time to write a letter to Steve or at least try to. I’m not sure what I should say to him,” James confessed.
HSBF: What about Laura? Wait, you said something about May not being there because of Clint? Did something happen?
Me: Yes. Benji’s friend who hacked into the suit also managed to hack into the Pentagon twice. So, I have a new intern and Agent has a candidate for the communications school.
Anthony: And I actually had breakfast this morning instead of 6 cups of coffee. Yo-Yo takes being my fake assistant very seriously. Okay, maybe not something so mundane
Alternative text for the get well card: Lila drew a picture of her favorite ‘uncle’ in full armor with colored pencils, the medium of choice for all seven-year-olds. The figure is surrounded by the words get well soon. She made it the morning after Tony ended up in the hospital.  Her baby brother helped.
“Also, the agency was subsequently destroyed by that point and I spent six months locked up. So I would really prefer that you not look at that book.”
“I’m paying her triple her usual rate, and apparently we have to agree to have the wedding in a remote location that can be secured, and despite everything else that went wrong, the lighthouse venue was about the only thing that worked well for the Fitzsimmons wedding. Okay, she wants us to switch the wedding day, but I want to be married to you as soon as possible and that weekend is the best option.”
“She says it’s fine; just use condoms.” At Friday’s response, Tony deeply regretted switching her out of silent mode. “Also, she told me to tell Mr. May-Rogers that she packed lube, condoms, scarves, and the pleasure seeker 3000 in your toiletry bag for use this evening.”
Me: Yes, she survived. She’s friends with Agent so he’s a pretty good judge of character. Usually. It’s also why I’m not worried about him and his partner knowing. He did get demoted for refusing to send out his team to find the wayward Avengers, even if they lied and said that it’s because everybody thinks that Agent is still dead. Ross is attempting to neuter him and keep me busy with red tape because we both know he’s the real enemy. Mostly because he’s a warmongering idiot who doesn’t have a diplomatic bone in his body.
“So Mack is inhabited by the spirit of vengeance or whatever he really is?” Hunter asked getting a glare from Simmons.
Cuddle Bunny: It’s fine. Actually maybe you should keep everything. I need to travel light and I trust you to keep everything safe.
Tosha: I know you feel guilty because you’re here, and they are not. It always hurts when you’re the one left behind.
Me: Kind of. Agent Agent was worried about an attack. There were credible threats made. However, we all assumed they would go in guns blazing in grand super villain fashion, not take advantage of my food allergies. But then again maybe they were taking their cues from the great Hydra wedding fiasco of 2014.
Me: If we were to get married, you would get like half of everything because I feel like asking you to sign a prenup would be like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The Big Boss: Yo-Yo mentioned something about you coming back Thursday because you're going to be leaving early to avoid certain people.
Tony Potts: Although we are still going to have to give them what we have to make it go faster. They’re working on a deadline. We are not.
Me: For security and privacy reasons, we are never having text message sex. I really don’t want a 16-year-old super genius reading through a transcript of us actually having text message sex. The fake porn messages were bad enough. I love you, but no.
Tony: Not Dr. and Mr. Leopold or Fitzsimmons. Which is for the best because I doubt Mockingbird wants to deal with her ex-husband and his new boyfriend, or the guy who is her husband’s new boyfriend from another timeline. Not everybody can be as chilled about it as Simmons.
Me: Friday has a big mouth and it's actually been about three days. Of course, I haven’t talked to him in those three days, but you can’t act like a teenager when your boyfriend is on the international most wanted list. I can show some restraint.
Me: Happy still doesn’t like you. I think he’s convinced himself that if you weren’t around Pepper and I would have gotten back together, despite the fact that none of the reasons why we broke up in the first place have been resolved. When we were both with other people, he was backing down. But now that she’s single again, I feel like all bets are off.
Me: Yes, because I only left the room 15 minutes ago and it is a little bit of a walk to James' house. Hey, are you still having breakfast with Peter and Afia?
“I’m going to change this wording a little bit since we’re not complete strangers. If you were to become a close friend again with me, what‘s something you would want to tell me.”
Anyway keep me posted on your mission. We will talk again when I’m in DC. I hope things work out that you will be able to have lunch with me.
He gets why your romantic relationship fell apart. I’m so sorry he said my name in bed. I was never actively trying to break your relationship apart. Also I was completely unaware of the Tony Stark gay sex tape, so I didn’t even think I had a chance. Even if I did, I wasn’t going to take your boyfriend.
Me: Because that made the website very plain. After watching several, I think you made the right choice. I also love the one about patience. Although I think waiting to see you in South Africa really will be worth it.
“Okay, fine I will give the book of evil to Afia, but other you better break out the engagement ring after we save him. I’m sure he’s watching this.” He tells Leo as he handed the book over to Afia.
Me: Yes, because if Monkey Lover didn’t suggest that I text message him when I was completely drunk I have this feeling that the end of the universe could’ve came and we still would not have been on speaking terms and that would have been just bad. Tragic, really. I’m glad that we fixed things. I wasn’t expecting us to fix it to this point, but I’m not complaining.
The Big Boss: I appreciate the consideration, but the event was open press. It was all over Twitter within about 10 minutes.
Tony: Me having a boyfriend would be bad enough for Ellis. He is from the party of “family values”. And me being a liberal leading independent is a hard enough sell with his party already. I’m just glad this isn’t going to need a confirmation hearing.
Tony Potts: I’m trying to stay sober, so I’m not even going to touch your comment about Steve being happy with me.
If you've been following me for a while, you know that I lost two family members to cancer around Thanksgiving 2015. One right before and one right after. Boseman's death has brought back a lot of those memories. I do empathize with his family and loved ones. This is not an easy loss; it never is. It takes time to process grief, and then it's never truly processed. You just get better at dealing with it. Grief isn't linear. You move forward, but you don't really move on. Sometimes moving forward involves a zigzag pattern. But talking about grief helps us move forward, we have to.
Kissing Steve was Tony’s favorite thing in the universe. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was such a new sensation or maybe because it was such a rarity. Long distance relationships definitely make the heart grow fonder. Or maybe it was because there was a 5% probability that after Tony told Steve that his BFF was now conscious and deprogrammed this would be the last kiss. And if it was going to be his last kiss, then Tony was going to make it count and maybe start unbuttoning some jeans. Yep, that would be good.
Nomad: Oh God. The worst I got was women sending me nudes and offering to be my first time since 1943.
Tony: Greetings from the district of insanity. Where the only thing that I’m looking forward to is getting a honey butter chicken sandwich from my favorite food truck.
"But he wouldn’t have reacted the way he did if I didn’t try to keep the fact we are together a secret."
Nomad: It's better than what we had before. Although I wish we had fixed things before we couldn't see each other daily.
Agent Barton: My Tony can’t remember everything he owns either. Even with everything in the trust until he no longer works for the federal government.
Anthony: Most of our conversations occur when it’s the middle of the night for one of us. I blame it on the insomnia.
Spoiler warning: There are spoilers for Black Panther in this conversation but hey, Infinity War is just around the corner so I have to get it in now. (I’m watching Friday morning.) This conversation is where we encounter the first post credit scene.
D FitzSimmons: Good news. I am in 2018 with your Bobo. The first one. Whatever you did worked. We’re not entirely sure what you did to bridge the two dimensions instead of merely sending me back in time in my own timeline. But the Princess has a working theory that we're going to try out. She’s the smartest person I’ve ever met. She knows everything.
Anthony: You know, totally below our pay grade, but we keep having to deal with it because they’re annoying little insects.
“Is your wife going to be OK with us sharing a bed? Because I’m OK going to the couch.” Even if it is a friendship with sex type of marriage, Tony doesn’t want to upset things.
Me: To prevent enhanced person internment camps. I am surprised the good Senator hasn’t already proposed that.
As for the beginning of your letter, I think for right now I want to just be James. The kids around here call me White Wolf, but I think James works better. I really don’t feel like a Bucky anymore. Too much has happened. I’m not sure who I feel like, but I’m trying to find that person.
“Yep, I am taking advantage of my new nano tech. That way I’ll always have a suit ready to roll. Bad guys don’t wait for you to change outfits. Pepper’s pissed and thinks I need more quality time with Suarez for my hero complex issues. As I pointed out, I am not her problem anymore.”
Anthony: That sounds about right. I will figure out how to expedite you a copy of Star Trek Beyond for a future movie night unless you don't like the alternate continuity.
Me: That’s always good. Tried any new restaurants? Did any shopping? I should probably let you know that my tailor is making you something for the wedding.
"He won’t touch Tony. He can’t. The president won’t let him." Steve wasn’t sure if he found Melinda’s words reassuring or not.
“Happy to oblige.” Steve responded, pulling Tony down into a kiss again. Tony really hopes the dinner goes well tomorrow so this can be a monthly thing.
Loki has transformed into their female form and has told the Grand Master that I’m her magical warrior handmaiden. (Note to self, asked Loki about pronoun preference.) Apparently, the Grand Master enjoys princesses from far-off planets and for the moment we are safe. Although we were invited to what I’m assuming is some sort of orgy. If I find out Loki agreed for us to be concubines for this Grand Master, I will quake the Prince of Lies to pieces. BTW, that name is so stupid and pretentious.
Agent L. Barton: Getting the stones may definitely be the easy part.  Especially because you will be able to get most of the stones from my timeline, I hope.
I’m not sure they’re willing to answer my questions regarding that. They’re living with the scars of what happened, but I don’t think they ever processed it. I’m not sure if everybody grieved because they’re focusing on undoing it. On that note, I don’t think they’re going to be willing to examine the mistakes that were made closely. I hypothesize things went badly because they were not actually on speaking terms at the time of the invasion. It’s hard to stop an apocalypse when you’re not talking to many of your teammates. I think Leo made the right decision in getting Tony and Steve talking to each other again first. At least that’s one thing going in our favor.
Tony: Friday and Agent Monkey Lover will hook you up with the latest suit. I updated the AI to make sure it alerts you, May, Coulson, me, or Sharon if things are going to hell.
I do not know if I can survive weeks or months with Loki as my only companion. Why did Robin want me to come to Asgard? Did she know this was going to happen? Why am I here? I have no idea.
Me: Yes. All the money in the world can’t make up for some of the fucked-up things I’ve done. And they don’t even know about me taking a minor out of the country without the express consent of his Guardian to participate in the uncivil toddler squabble. That stupidity was like the ultimate red checkmark.
Monkey Lover 2: Much better thoughts. Although I still want to know about the alibi, you can tell me that when I get home.
Dad likes your idea of sending us to Malta. Connor is against it because he doesn’t think you should send him to Malta if you're not sending Benji, MJ, and Flash. He doesn't get that there's a big difference between a normal 13-year-old and a 16-year-old with superpowers. MJ may not have powers, but she does have agent training. Also, Flash is 18 and can do whatever he wants. Again, my brother is a brat. I’m glad my parents decided to have another kid because baby brothers are so much better.
I do care about Tony. I have for a long time, longer than I realized. I’m going to try hard not to hurt him again. But I will because, contrary to popular belief, I’m not perfect. I make the same, if not more mistakes, than anyone else.
Me: I am impressed and a little concerned because only Shield has been able to break it so far. Of course, I’ve recently discovered that half of the SI medical research department and a quarter of the telecommunications research/design division are actually from Wakanda, not Kenya, so again I shouldn’t be surprised.
Captain Tight Pants: I just wanted to have my best friend back. I just wanted to have a connection to who I used to be. The more time I spend in the world now, the more who I used to be seems to become lost.
Now more than four months removed from the situation and on a lot of medication that no longer consists of a fifth of bourbon a day, I realized that I would've regretted that. The Winter Soldier was a weapon brainwashed into the service of Hydra. There was no consent there. There’s no autonomy. No control over his actions. He was a weapon of Hydra and my anger should be focused on making sure every last part of that organization is burnt to the ground with the earth salted over.
Anthony love: Make that the lighthouse, but at least you’ll get to decide if you want it to be our wedding venue. Although we’re going to have to choose a different day because April 28 is now off the table.
Me: I think the armor would just slow her down. She is more of a hand-to-hand type person. Okay, this morning I saw her single-handedly beat up Shield’s new enhanced threat team. I would love to see what she could do with the shield.
I think the saying is ‘people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones’. Well I live in a glass tower, so no stone throwing will be happening. I’m going to step back and listen to my therapist. I have a different one from Steve but she’s good and made me realize a lot of things. The medication also helped. I’m on the good stuff.
“I guess if you were to change anything about your childhood, you would want Howard to actually be there?” Steve asked. Tony nodded his head in agreement.
The first thing she did was run up to him to wrap her arms around her Fitz and kissed him till they were both breathless.
Tony: So bad. Maybe it would be better if I got more than three hours of sleep in the last two days due to board members who don't understand time zones and remote phone interviews. But that’s life. My life anyway. I’m on my third espresso.
Me: I’m happy that I have at least risen back to the rank of friend because I didn’t think I would ever get that far, not after how we left things in Siberia. I’m also not one of those assholes that thinks friendship is some sort of consolation prize. I’ve had enough meaningless sex (though none recently) to know that I would rather have friendship. I think maybe why the Pepper thing hurts so badly is because I lost my friend Pepper too.
“On the good days, sometimes. But I have two decades of Howard making me feel like I couldn’t live up to you or at least his idea of you. I think you’re aware that my self-esteem is shot to hell.” Steve responds by placing an arm around Tony.
Melinda: That would not be advisable since I just came across a photo of Hunter and Fitz making out. Friday make sure Simmons doesn’t access this phone.
Steve: You did try to tell me about it before, but then you think of him, and you stop talking to me.
Me: Okay. Mary has everything together. She’ll give me most of the details in the car. Although, she won’t be coming with us because Hanukkah starts on December 24
"Still doesn’t mean that they won’t try something. I may be actually halfway successful. Ross could be in on it too because, again, he’s golf friends with at least Prick and Dick. I think his assistant called my assistant three times because he wants to yell at me. Fortunately, Yo-Yo just kept routing her to Rhodey." That concerned Steve. He doesn’t like Ross playing games with Tony.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You’re fabulous. This conversation takes place a few hours after the last one. It may or may not still be September 27.
PS: Phil had me sign his issue of Captain America number one in exchange for not telling Tony that I got shot again. God, they were awful to Peggy in that.
But I understand and I don't want to keep this anger with me anymore. I'm going to work on letting it go because I think that's what Maria would've wanted. I think I do more for her memory if I do good things then if I do something horrible in her name.
Me: That explains your most recent bad choice. That’s what you get when you try to spare your baby brother from being stabbed in the back by his new father figure. I told you not to put yourself through this pain and you did it anyway. I don’t like you being hurt.
“Your wife was right. That’s something you need to work on.” She tells him as she continues watching the video. Everyone she can see in the frame is a mess. Of course, they would be after losing so much. She also wonders if this Steve ever received treatment for his adjustment disorder. She will ask later, just focus on one problem at a time.
I wasn’t actively using you to get over your aunt. I was trying to move on from wanting to be with someone who already had a girlfriend. I’m sorry.
Of course, that was before he stopped drinking. It’s much harder to do this sober. He realized that during yesterday’s business lunch. If he didn’t have Steve to talk to, he’s sure that the temptation may have become too much. When a certain now blonde ninja started talking about bad decisions made in Germany and Siberia, he sincerely wished that his orange juice would suddenly become a mimosa. Thankfully, Stevie bear stopped that quickly by blaming himself for everything. That just made everything extra awkward.
Tony: Good call. And they don’t even know Dr. Leopold is the new head of the UN Avengers yet. Or he will be as soon as Dr. Suarez clears him.
Nomad: You did have a lot of physical damage after your fight with a nuclear warhead. I still couldn’t get you to stay in medical for more than five minutes.
“This is not fair.” Tony lamented and Steve agreed, although deep down inside he felt it was probably for the best. Besides a healthy Tony was more important than anything else.
I’m going to behave and not put anything from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier for at least a month. However, I have thoughts. I will say, Tony managed to fix things a lot more than he thought he did. Apparently, he fixed more things than I thought he did. More to come as we go forward
HSBF: Although, we will be in Wakanda on Christmas Day. He wrote back and just said he’s looking forward to seeing me. Are you really okay with that?
“Yes, because I don’t want to screw things up as badly as before.” He wasn’t expecting that confession.
“We can be. I hate not being able to tell you what’s going on and I know Fitz did as well. I was just afraid Hunter would be right and the team would lock us up for being crazy. He sort of was.”
Counselor Laura: Trust me, I know. What happened is going to leave many scars that are going to have to be worked through. So much therapy is going to be required for everyone.
Tony: Why are you restless? I thought you were supposed to be going sightseeing with Lily bear’s aunt and the counselor?
HSBF: I thought Senator Nadeer is still refusing to resign and claims the whole thing is a conspiracy created by Inhumans to force her out. I hope you’re having Ana send them to voicemail.
Tony: The secret really is open communication, which I suck at. Also, I miss Jane so much. She was the best PR person. I’ve fucking hate the snap.
Girl Friday: You are the best baby sister. I assume you’re making a portal for the new consultant to have access too. Can we bring BITC in yet, or am I going to have to wait until school?
Me: Exactly. I can see that it would get really annoying if you were dating someone who only wanted you because they only saw you just as Captain America and not because of what Steve Rogers brings to the table. You would just be a trophy.

Tony: So congratulations, Snuggle Bunny. You won the shield/avengers “when will May and Coulson actually get their shit together” betting pool. I will transfer $21623 into your account.
“Remember all those times I told you that I felt like the database with the locations of all the special people registered because of the Accords was like creating a super villain hit list?” Tony prompted his boyfriend.
“I’m grateful that she saved you.  We were trying to retrofit The Zephyr to come to get you with stolen Hydra/alien technology. Unfortunately, we were not going fast enough for me," Steve acknowledged.
The new consultant: I was hoping for spring break, but other things are more pressing. Did you look up what happened to Benji?
“Jim’s grandson would like for you to consider Brooklyn Vision Academy for your kids for next semester or possibly private school," Steve replied dryly.
"It has to happen eventually. I'll give Happy and Steve 15 minutes and then I'll go over to check on the idiot and my boyfriend."
Thank you for your well wishes and the cookies. You found my favorites. They are appreciated. I’m sorry I didn’t mention the allergies. I don’t like for people to have to do extra things for me.
During their acquaintance, Tony has realized that Steve is good at a lot of things. And during the last hour, Tony has realized that masseuse should go to the top of that list. He felt happy and relaxed. Probably because a Steve massage has quite the climax, literally. Totally by accident, maybe. Steve was the ultimate gentleman and did not go anywhere near Dr. Simmons’ list of no zones. Yet somehow, he still came harder than he has since… ever.
"I have no idea." Steve shrugged as he went to grab the wine bottle from the table to pour the rest of it out only to realize it wasn’t there anymore. Neither was Melinda.
HSBF: Well, considering you developed feelings for me while you were with her, I can understand that.
Me: I think I did that a little too much. We are too competitive. I hope we are getting better about that.
Tony: Yes, Dr. and Mr. Leopold just showed up holding hands and everything. He’s now introducing Hunter to the board and their wives. And another board member just choked on a crab puff when the H word came out.
Red phone: To whomever Tony refers to as Captain Tight Pants, please try not to text him when he’s supposed to be participating in a board meeting. Do that on your time, not mine.
Me: Not really. What does it say about me that one vision of Cuddle Bunny dying in my arms made me create murder bots?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. Also, thank you to all those that have left kudos. Every bit keeps me writing. The last conversation generated a lot of comments. I promise several when replying that this would be up by Friday but the week was a little more chaotic than I thought it would be and I did not have time to finalize the chapter until this morning.
Tony: Feeding breakfast to small children and preteens at the upstate facility. Nikki just managed to get blueberry compote on the ceiling.
Counselor Laura: That still confuses me greatly. You're right, I'll go invite Clint to the meeting. We are ordering pizza. That should entice him if the brownies are not enough.
Red phone: I was contacted by my ATCU contact agent Daisy because she was desperate to get in contact with our favorite Asgardian. The reason why was because Agent Agent was having some interesting side effects to the procedures that Patches used to get him back among the living. I wouldn’t help without being told the truth about Coulson. Of course everything resolved itself before I could get a hold of a certain Asgardian.
He is mad at you. Furious really. But Tony still won't throw you under the metaphorical bus or to the board. He won't let Colonel Rhodes touch you either. The conversation with Shield wasn't exactly pleasant. Despite how angry he is, he’s still loyal to you because you stood by his side when he did a lot of stupid things, mostly involving various illegal drugs. Someday, I'm going to want to know more about that, but not today.
Me: No, apparently, I’m meeting with the Princess of Wakanda instead. I’m sure one of my State Department friends suggested it. Or Rhodey. Okay, maybe he’s not so okay with what’s happening.
Red phone: So, in addition to trying to get me to violate my conscience and make weapons again, the Secretary of Defense also tried to get me to tell them where you are. Actually, I think they want you more than the armor.
Me: Yes. The weeks before South Africa are going to be total chaos, so I need as much time as possible to prepare. In addition to this mess, I have to clean house at the foundations. That’s going to be so much fun.
Agent 13: That may just be a convenient byproduct of someone else's assassination attempt. Chances are they don't know that you are with Tony. Only a handful of people know you're dating. Most of them have a S5 clearance. The Watchdogs despise your boyfriend for reasons outside of you.
Also, my 4 millionth word is somewhere in this chapter, per fanfiction dot net. (Probably a good 300,000 words are A/Ns and story rewrites, but I'm still counting it.) I've been writing fanfic since 2009. When I started, I didn't think I would ever get to this point where I’ve actually penned 4 million words worth of stories. I was terrified of writing publicly because of my disability. I thought I would be ridiculed for typos that I couldn’t always catch. Your support over the years has kept me going through near-fatal car accidents, deaths in the family, and now a  pandemic. I appreciate all of you being here with me for the ride.
Steve: Maybe. Do you still need me for that? Because if what we're doing works, we're still not going to be able to bring back Phil. He's gone.
Me: They're worried about the stock prices, aren't they? They’re overreacting. People being reminded that I am a member of the LGTBPIQ community shouldn’t hurt things that much. I mean there’s a few world leaders here that don’t want to sit next to me right now, but whatever.
Me: We are all one bad day away from being a super villain. Of course, in your case it would probably take a complete cerebral rewrite or possibly brainwashing. You’re too squeaky clean otherwise.
Purple arrow 2018: I know. I've been reading through the reports. I actually spent all night going through them. I'm not sure my other self's presence would have made a difference. I just throw arrows.
Tony: Well, then you two can chat on our car ride to see our kids. The whole point of this text message conversation is to ask you to come with me to visit the kids.
Now let’s talk about my relationship with Maria. That was complicated especially during the later years. There was a lot of resentment for her not talking Howard out of sending me off to boarding school. I’ve made peace with it, now that I know why. However, I regret a lot of the things I said to her and I wish things could’ve been different in the end. But she is my mom. I loved her, despite her faults and there were many.
“You’re mad at me?” Hunter asked Leo after sending his last message to Tony. He was not expecting Leo to lean over their bed and kiss him.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. We’re back in under a week, thankfully. I really did not intend to do another interlude conversation so soon, but the muse wants what the muse wants. Today, the Muse decided that Director Rhodes deserved some quality Tony time. I don’t think he is happy about that.
Tony: I don’t think the man ever concerns himself with legal or ethical. What do you expect from a guy who left his second wife post-heart attack for his nurse? I think she’s wife number three.
"Because Laura is mostly dealing with actual children." Tony added. "You know Steve isn't much for sharing. I'm sure he would have told you eventually. Okay, I'm sure May would have told you eventually. Or possibly Clint."
Me: Flash forward to January, Rice gets confirmed as secretary of State. Rice nominates Rhodey Bear to be Deputy Secretary. Platypus resigns from the ATCU and I get appointed to the position. Finally, at my retirement party from SI, my replacement makes out with his boyfriend. We get video footage of all of the stupid members of the board overreacting and use it to push them out of the company for good.
“Neither can I. I think this might be her rebound. God, I hope so.” Honestly, he would’ve preferred Happy even though it kind of freaked him out a little bit. Happy never made his whole-body tingle.
Anthony love: Speaking of the Calvary, I barely was able to keep Agent America from flying over to Mumbai to get her boyfriend back. Although if I don’t hear back from you by morning our time, I’m probably going to resort to using an Icer on her.
Also, I’m sorry for worrying both you and your nephew. I’m sure Laura informed both of you that tales of my impending demise were greatly exaggerated. News media always exaggerates at least when it comes to me. Sometimes it's on purpose. They have to keep those ratings up. I honestly think the shareholders started half of the rumors. I'm sorry you guys were so worried, but really, I am doing better.
Me: It’s more complicated than yes, and I'll explain everything in person in a few days. We also need to talk about your superhero future, since you figured out that you are more important than your costume a lot earlier than I did.
Purple arrow: More like the beginning of a crisis than the middle of a crisis. Also, I despise Jeffrey, which is why I’m sticking with retirement.
Nomad: I’m not even that surprised. I think I’ve known you long enough to know that you picked a word and then came up with the acronym.
A/N Summer 2020: Initially, I was going to have three “bad” timeline conversations in a row, but then new episodes of Agents of Shield started, and I had to go back and do some Leo Fitz stuff due to his absence in the first two episodes. By the time you see this conversation, the show will be over, and I will be crying. Yes, I wrote the chapter after the first two episodes in early June. Yes, these chapters are prepared months in advance of when they come out. I used to write one section of each story and rotate around. Now I usually write a block of anywhere from 4 to 12 chapters before moving onto another one of my stories. I find this method keeps the creative juices going better.
Cuddle Bunny: At least you are smart enough to know that a database of all enhanced people is dangerous if it’s easy for anybody to break into.
Anthony: The Greek fries at DC Ballers are awesome. I bet he had an awful time getting you off and that’s why you found the whole thing so awful.
So this morning I saw the now former head of the Jarvis foundation led out in handcuffs for trying to kill you. (Happy and Kevin watched it together gleefully eating doughnuts.) I assume this means that you’ll be coming home soon. I made sure that your assistant had a box of your favorite cookies, in addition to the cookie bouquet that will arrive once I’m sure you’re back home. Somebody needed to give you something nice to make up for the board getting you a get-well gift that might send you back to the hospital.
Anthony: Nope. And neither did Yo-Yo which I’m surprised because the bastard killed her cousin in cold blood. She could’ve pulled the trigger. Part of me thinks she should have pulled the trigger, but she didn’t. That makes her a better person than me.
Look, there’s nothing you can do about Spidey Junior’s dad. That is something that he’s going to have to fix himself. You are not responsible for the dumb things adults do. I know it’s hard to accept that. I blamed myself for a lot of my dad’s issues. I used to think if ‘I was better, maybe you wouldn’t drink so much.’ But that was a Howard problem, not a Tony problem. That’s the same thing going on right now.
Tony: Okay, nothing terrifies me more than a situation where I can end up becoming Howard. You know I never want to become Howard.
Me: Not right now that Senator Hateful is making things worse and Ross is pissed about me making a fool out of him
“I think you’re aware after the Helicarrier fuck up, that I never make the best first impression. Although, Siberia was extra awful even for me,” Tony remarked.
Me: You know unless we get kidnapped by a super villain and brainwashed. Then all bets are off. I feel like this could totally happen.
“Because I needed Friday’s help to do so. She was the first person I contacted. She convinced me that the Avengers needed to be back on speaking terms. So I started emailing Tony again to help with that.”
Anthony: I have the movie. But it's not date appropriate and I really want to not think about appending apocalypses. But I’ll have Friday put it on your computer anyway.
Tony: And yes, I did read the confession, the real version from Agent America and not what Senator Hateful’s Chief of Staff provided. Apparently, he turned to a life of crime because DODC put him out of business. I put him out of business.
The Mechanic: I tried to ground him and well, you saw how that went. After consulting with an actual parent, it was determined that the best course of action is monitoring and additional training. But it’s going to be your call.
“I’m trying. Does dealing with my Board of Directors on behalf of the US government for decades count as diplomatic experience? I mean, you know they’re assholes.”
Football Hunter: Apparently, every Avenger team needs a hot guy, and your Doctor persona is like Black Widow but with a doctorate. I’ve seen what you could do. We are going to use it to our advantage.
“Then you’re delusional because that’s just not feasible. At best, your plan was wishful thinking. We are low on Pym particles that we are unable to reverse engineer despite Deke being able to reverse engineer anything. Regardless of Bruce’s help and Deke coming across some old notes on the SI servers, we barely figured out how to create a time guidance system. That’s only because we had the residue energy from the monolith to help. No one else may be willing to admit it, but there’s no way we're going to be able to reverse what Thanos did, but we could at least get Fitz and Laura back.” May looks like she is near seconds from punching Simmons, but Steve quickly leaves Laura to physically hold May back.
I realize that I made some bad choices. Not agreeing to the ideal of the Accords because in theory, I think they’re necessary. I don’t always like rules and oversight, but sometimes they can be helpful.
Also, this contains “late arrival” spoilers for the next story in the series Text Messages from the Edge of High School. You may want to read the first two chapters, before reading these post-credit scenes. You can read this next part first, but it's going to change how you read parts of the following story. This is the reason these two final post-credit scenes were posted separately. Of course, if you’re planning to skip that story and go right to my Infinity War/Endgame adaptation, go ahead and read on. That possibility is the reason why I decided to post these two post-credit scenes to this story like initially planned and not move it to the other one.
“Because we're not ready yet. If you could just wait until...” Bobo one stopped speaking when Hunter and Friday glared at him.
Counselor Laura: His son ordered the nuke that you flew into a portal. Hydra has been the family brand since before the great depression. Per Leo, Wilford Malick handed one of the ingredients for the supersoldier cocktail to Hydra himself in 1931.
Luke Cage season 2 occurs after the timeline divided and therefore some of the things Leo Fitz did to prevent the upcoming apocalypse did lightly affect some things on that show. So in this universe, a lot of what happened did happen the same way, but there were a few differences. Just remember if something contradicts go with my version.
Me: I’ll talk to Jane and let her decide. I would wait until morning, but she’s going to want to know as soon as possible.
May: You wouldn’t need some with an MD, if I brought Dr. Rio Morales in. Her husband was ex shield. He was lost during the decimation. Which spurred her on to get her MD. Her son is friends with my daughter. When we have a medical emergency, we call her in.
Genius Princess: Because I change them. But did I change things enough? I don’t have an answer. Too much is at stake if I’m wrong.
OK, you get to help me pick out a codename for Hunter of the good timeline. I have a codename for a bad timeline Hunter, but I’m also open to more suggestions.
“He is not.” “We are not…” “Not really…” “He is hot but it’s complicated.” “That would be an understatement.” The two of them stumbled out almost simultaneously.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I'm sure Clint is probably anxious; let him know I'm okay, though. It’s only been two days?
“It’s a loaner. I mean I could have a quinjet drop off his actual car but it probably would be a little too easily noticed in whatever European country you are currently in. But tell him that it’s safe in my garage and Daisy is not allowed anywhere near it. I’ve even taking care of the scratches,” Tony tells him.
Agent America: I already read the data from Friday. I should know not to underestimate Stark's AI. I was already on my way to the West Virginia/Virginia border. Nice to know my hunch was right.
Me: I’m not even entirely sure. I feel ridiculously old having dinner at 4 PM. Although Friday did arrange for a hickory smoked cheeseburger.
Before she could ask how she ended up in a world where Steve married someone who is not Tony, she heard her phone ping. Laura quickly moved to the side of the room to look at her phone in peace. Steve was too busy calming his wife down to pay attention to her.
Due to the sheer amount of movies/TV shows that MCU actors have shown up in, I feel that the best way around the celebrity paradox issue is that everybody has a look-alike thespian except for Samuel L. Jackson who may or may not be an LMD. Seriously, that man is in a lot of movies. He has 171 acting credits and counting. (The number has increased by three since I wrote the original draft of this chapter a month ago.)
Melinda: I don’t think everything can be blamed on you. We all made mistakes. I don’t think it’s healthy that you put everything on yourself. We're both a mess.
HSBF: It’s really nice, but you didn’t need to rent out an entire floor. You definitely did not have to give the counselor an entire spa day.
“She decided to go after the Watchdogs by herself. She abandoned me at an old Shield safe house off of Lake Ontario.”
“Although that actually smells good, that does not seem to be enough omelets for five people,” Virginia commented.
Tony: I’m available to answer questions. Although I’m going to go to Steve now because I’m exhausted. We are totally going to end up sharing a bed, aren’t we?
Me: Friday is good, She’s already found and deactivated six bugs in the last 48 hours. But after what happened last year, I’m not putting my faith in tech, not even my own.
Agent Laura: I don’t think it will. I heard Robin drew a picture of the three together. It seems obvious that there’s a third option on the table here.
So this chapter is different than what I had outlined originally. The plan was either to do an in-person conversation between Leo and the Princess or go directly into a text messaging conversation with Lauren the other timeline. However, I did the initial draft of this chapter the day after the death of Chadwick Boseman. (Yes, the lag time is ridiculous right now). That made me want to do a chapter between the Princess and her big brother instead. Writing is how I deal with things. See my story, the Denial Phase, and most of my Dear Spock universe for proof.
May: I’m not sure. Although I did find out that I am her SO in the other timeline. That came out over dinner yesterday.
Purple arrow 2018: Well, it's nice to know Phil being a dick is a universal constant. He still hasn't called me after his last alien kidnapping Friday. I know his kid is missing, but he could still check-in.
Red phone: Better than Ross. He is misappropriating half the budget for his own superhero witch-hunt.
Nomad: And that explains why you have the person you pay to change the light bulbs at the tower wear a safety harness.
Spoiler/continuity note: I referenced one thing from the Spider-man Homecoming trailer in this chapter. Since the scene also happened in the Ultimate Spiderman comic books, I feel fine using it. My opinion is that Spider-man Homecoming is likely taking place post-Civil War in the six month gap between AOS season three and four a.k.a. when this story is taking place. We will see how right I am in July. We will also see how AU this story will become. (I’m purposely not watching the Infinity Wars video clip to avoid creative contamination for a little while longer.)
Me: I don’t think anyone really is. My ex science bro always said the guy was a dick. So I’m sure there must be more. Considering how many sexual harassment complaints SI HR made go away regarding Obadiah, that I didn’t find out about until after he literally ripped my heart out, I’m sure there’s more bodies buried somewhere.
Nomad: Unfortunately yes. I fucked him a few times before I realized he had levels of internalized homophobia that I haven’t seen since the 40s. I wasn’t going to deal with that again.
The new consultant: Wakanda Tech holo-pad. On the way here, the Princess asked me to start looking at the files that were transmitted from 2023. So, we could figure out how not to make the same mistakes.
Tosha: Never date a coworker. He’d rather run away then be with me, and that was his choice. I’ve moved on long ago. You would know that if you picked up the phone occasionally.
He loved you, he still loves you, and you completely betrayed him. You chose someone else over him. I may not know all the details, but I know you chose your childhood friend over him. What’s not to say you’re going to do it again? And I’m the one who will have to pick up the pieces, if he will let me and he didn’t last time. I’ve been replaced by Laura, Elaina, and Melinda. Even Kevin had my role for a while. He’s the one who sent me pictures of what you did to Tony. So why can he forgive you and we can barely hold a conversation? I don’t know and that hurts so much.
Christmas seems like a good idea. I can afford presents now (I’m not even going to ask Tony how he restored access to my bank accounts to me,) and I’m no longer allergic to pine trees. Although, I guess I’ll have to bring a fake one with me. They probably don’t have pine trees where you are and there are rules about bringing in outside plant life from one country to another.
Tony: That wouldn’t be hard. The guy they had play me seriously looked nothing like me. OK, so who am I?
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. It’s time to get deep. I’ve been wanting to do this letter for a while but it’s hard to get all of this out. Here is Steve’s next attempt.
Me: Which explains why TMNS told me nothing, but you’re an adult. Why didn’t you tell me the truth when you realized that my teenage nephew was running around the five boroughs attempting to get himself killed as a vigilante?
“Obviously, this thing was written by people who have never been famous for reasons outside of their control. I think that’s why I’m trying so hard to keep Morgan from the press. They don’t bother us at the cabin.” Tony explained.
Counselor Laura: I don’t know if Steve 2018 ever tried because it could interact with his antidepressants. His body is not baseline.
“You don’t have to be here. Me and Leo can deal with this on our own. Shouldn’t you be in Mumbai aggressively negotiating with the girlfriend anyway?” Hunter remarked. “Also we’re technically not married, it’s just a cover identity. Weddings just lead to ninjas or evil dads crashing.” Leo was still trying to repress what happened last March. That was a disaster.
Me: That is definitely not happening. I was a bad candidate before, now I have a boyfriend that could become a fiancé at some point. Maybe.
Tony: You would think so, but politicians. Also, Ellis knows the truth about Ultron and so does most of Congress. Closed-door hearings.
Skye quake: I accidentally walked in on them after my horrible press conference that Mace made me do.
TMNS: That’s where Liz is moving to. Oregon anyway, not necessarily Portland. Liz knows about the alibi because high school is worse than Twitter and Flash is an asshole.
Me: Yes, but Agent Agent would not be happy and I’m pretty sure he could kill you with a paperclip. Or at least choke you. He has a black belt in practically everything including Brazilian jujitsu.
Tony: Well, first of all, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a way not to die. When I realized that wasn’t going well, I gave a lot of money and art, mostly art, to the Boy Scouts of America as part of a shaming activity. I was going to try to convince them to let LGBT members in. Something good for the community before I die. At least they’re getting better and my dead body wasn’t necessary.
FRIDAY: Yes. My contact, Agent Fitz agreed to wait until Colonel Rhodes could make it to the facility. Due to the vetting process for the position of director of Shield, that was not possible until today.
Tony: Which means she’ll keep it, just so Agent won’t cry. She just loves her little Agent, even though she will never tell him that.
Agent L. Barton: Then I’m going to approach her today. We need to get somebody in to help Simmons now. Rio can only do the body part.
Anthony: Although not a bastard like your ex or slightly obsessive and crazy like Ross, I’m pretty sure I will punch him in the teeth if he uses any more PR buzzwords on me.
Tony Bear: Yep. This should be Stefan’s phone because only a complete idiot would put his superhero name on everything. At least when he or she is trying to do a secret identity anyway.
Therapist Laura: Of course he is. Tell Clint that I did smack Coulson the first time I saw him. More importantly he let me which is probably Coulson’s way of saying sorry, he had to keep playing dead. Although I do understand why he kept up the charade after Hydra came out of the shadows.
“Talbot probably doesn’t care, especially if you autograph those comics/card for his son. Seriously, that kid idolizes you more than Coulson, if such a thing where possible.”
Me: Because she would have sued their pants off otherwise, or at least dad would have on her behalf.
Therapist Laura: Also I prefer the term Counselor because I don’t have a PhD yet. I’m working on it and thanks to my new schedule, I’ll probably get there sooner rather than later.
Anthony: Pepper actually was the one who put the word friend back in there so maybe there’s hope that will be able to maybe get back our friendship eventually.
Person that cares about my boss: Sometimes I think you care too much. How can you care about me at all after what I did? If I kept Bucky from falling, then there would have never been a Winter Soldier and maybe your parents would not have died on that December night in 1991. I don’t get how you can still care about me after everything. I don’t deserve it.
Anthony love: I think it’s because I instinctively pick up on child abusers. I’m dispatching Suarez and Cruz to deal with Ruby. I would send Laura, but she was kidnapped by Clint 2023. Also, from what Deke told me they probably could all use a therapist or 6.
Me: Me actually. It came out accidentally when I had to explain why she no longer has medical power of attorney and Steve still does. That was not a very pleasant conversation.
Anthony love: I hope that goes better than telling Lily and Corey about their missing mom. When you see me, I’m going to be a little bruised. Clint should be here in an hour, and chances are I’ll end up with more bruises. He punched the wall on the quinjet during his holo-call into the all-hands meeting. So, this is probably not going to go well at all.
Counselor Laura: What question resulted in you revealing that you used his propaganda poster for personal time? I’m currently texting while we’re driving to meet up with our potential new therapist over coffee. I hope I am successful.
Red phone: More than fine because you’re alive to talk to me, you fucking idiot. The new suit will be made out of the prototype spider web fabric and will have the built-in energy shield. Maybe in the new gear you can avoid getting shot.
Counselor Laura: Yes, I did kill someone. I turned his weapon on him. Unfortunately, your other self wasn’t happy and asked me to leave Shield again.
Me: It's a little different with the spy twins because they're ex-Shield and Rhodey has better options to get them back in the good graces of the UN.
Tony Potts: I’m not even surprised. You know some of those records may not be destroyed here. We could look into it?
Blue phone: Agent Triplett. I met him a few times before we had to shut down SHIELD because of people like his boss. He was a good kid.
“You should have. Thankfully, I was on a mission for most of it. I would’ve been furious if I had sex with someone who wasn’t my boyfriend.” Simmons glared directly at Fitz. Now that the team knew there was two of them, Simmons was the only one who could actually tell them apart. (Along with Hunter, but he wasn’t technically part of the team at the moment.)
D: My niece can probably find out during spring break. We are currently escorting the hammer to Wakanda. The king mentions that his sister was planning to come back Saturday and will be bringing her friends.
Me: I don’t know. I had to postpone a few days because of an Avenger emergency. Fish oil incident that actually needed more firepower than the Zapper to contain before it became a recruitment tool for the Watchdogs and Senator Hateful.
“You’re still alike where it counts. Also you’re both easily prone to jealousy. You’re only suggesting this because you don’t want him to make a move on your girlfriend.” Hunter argued.
Tony: And now we’re in recovery. However, recovery takes time, though. I am still surprised she’s going to let me spend any time with Ben at all. Apparently, in the kid needs some form of a male role model and I am it. Thor help us all.
“Right, she would know that because Ultron happened before the timelines diverged.” This meant it’s an experience that the happy couple also shared. Friday implied that things went quickly because they were already in love with each other. This means seven years ago, he and Tony were already in love with each other, but seven years is a long time.
HSBF: I’m glad. You’ll be happy to know that Friday did send me the questions. Or rather, she forwarded to me the email that Jane sent to Stefan’s dummy email account. Yes, I did in fact rehearse what I was going to say in a phone call before making the call because it’s still a new concept to me. I actually like text messaging better. It’s like a short letter or telegraph.
So, as you can tell, the timeline that Fitz a.k.a. James Leopold came from is slightly different than what we saw in Endgame. A lot of it will be similar when it comes to characters like Thor and Bruce. Also, most of those lost in the decimation will be the same, but I felt Tony and Steve would be somewhat different, especially because I really wanted to incorporate the AOS characters (and my heart says this Pepper knows better). I’m viewing the Endgame timeline as what happens if the AOS characters stay trapped in the lighthouse timeline. There are so many timelines going on here. The multi-verse really is madness.
Director Snookums: Not Nadeer. Actually, if you could give money to her opponent in two years, I would be really happy. We haven't even gone public yet and she's already making my job so much harder.
Peter is a good kid. He's also still a kid and I think he forgets that sometimes. I know I did, mostly because I was already in college at his age and being groomed to be the next CEO of Stark Industries. I shouldn't be used as an example of proper child development.
“Which if that wasn’t the case you wouldn’t be you. But it’s not just about the security risk. Sergeant Barnes is undergoing the treatment for 70 years of trauma and the doctors aren’t sure he’s ready to see you yet. At best, it would be an emotional setback. At worst, it could re-trigger something.”
“Done.” The AI replied. She sounds a little like Friday, but younger.  “Afia, I also made this your new wallpaper.”
"No, Natasha is out there. As well as agents Davis and Piper. Actually, it sounds like she just pulled an icer out on them both. If things go too badly, we will just drag their unconscious bodies to separate rooms."
Me: It was tempting, especially when they are willing to give you opiates like candy. I'm not going to lie, I probably managed to stay sober because I was in the cabin in the woods without one drop of alcohol in it. I looked, twice.
“A lot. Apparently, mostly involving Spidey and a super villain. I'm trying to piece it together from Twitter. Apparently I have a soon-to-be former employee to thank for most of this stuff being on twitter.” It was all giving him a headache, really.
“They were outside of my price range. Although because of that, at least I never did anything stupid like asthma cigarettes.” Steve remarked darkly.
Counselor Laura: While you're doing that, I will talk to Scott and get a readout of what actually happened with somebody named Ghost five years ago.
Anthony: Coulson is the asshole who manipulated me into going to New York to keep Ross from putting the abomination in the Avenger initiative. He knows what he’s doing. Oh God, I still hope that he is frozen in Alaska. Definitely not someone I want as a teammate.
Red phone: Better than for production design, which will be what I mostly using it for. As soon as we fix things with the asshole, I expect you to get the most use out of it.
“Excellent point. The fact that you have a boyfriend doesn’t need to be some grant confession. Just mention it casually in the course of your letter. It doesn’t have to be a big thing.”
Nomad: I now know why they locked you out of your twitter account. I never told you that his penis was small.
I also wrote the chapter long before I saw all season seven of AOS, but I love how this turned out in hindsight.
Me: Yes. She is actually in a very good mood since she also won a lot of money in the ‘when will Agent and Agent America finally get their shit together’ betting pool.
"That part is easy. I’m terrified about people knowing about our relationship, but at the same time relieved, even if they don’t really know it’s me. Being out in the open changes things. It’s just so much easier if it’s between us and the world is on the outside. I’m not sure if we’re ready for all the world to be watching yet."
Me: I’m not even sure. I think Benji was involved maybe. It doesn’t matter because the 36 questions that lead to love interview is dead.
Red spider: I don’t think the Confederacy is coming back. They are a little terrified of Wanda and Robbie.
Friday: Mister Stark had to leave to finish a project. He will contact you again as soon as time permits.
“I love you and I did this for your own good. Also I got chocolate body paint. You can paint me like one of your French girls,” Tony offers. That makes Steve feel slightly better.
HSBF: I heard about her helping with Laura. I’m glad she won’t have to read anymore messages like that.
HSBF: Nothing about this situation is good. There has to be something more to this. Something must’ve happened to make him do something like that.
"It was, but you're right. We should have come to you. But you were so mad at me for my various mistakes, and I was afraid to face you. But I can't just keep running away." Steve acknowledged.
"Very skilled. I almost wondered if you went to masseuse school." Tony said as he walked into the room just in time to see Steve put the finishing touches on remaking the bed. Thankfully, the suite came with extra sheets and things because somebody thought Tony would be getting luckier than he was. Thankfully it came in handy.
BITC: Laura got kidnapped by an alternate version of her husband and is trapped in an alternate version of 2023. Half of us disappeared because we lost to somebody named Thanos? Who is he?
“I don’t know. We never found Ian Quinn in my original timeline. Neither me nor the Princess could confirm either possibility.”
“He’s a fugitive because he helped us.” Steve felt awful about that and it just got worse after he saw Lila’s drawling a couple of weeks ago. “It shouldn’t be that way. He has the kids and Laura to worry about."
“Be glad you have a parent that cares if you’re using protection. I could text her back and tell her that I promise to follow her rules. Although if we do dinner with your aunt, we should bring groceries and cook ourselves for her." Flash joked.
Me: See talking things out through text messages makes everything a little easier because in person we’re just going to argue and not listen. This is better.
Steve: So, we can be 100% sure she’s from a different past or timeline. Maybe Simmons should look through her phone? She’s better with tech.
The Mechanic: She’s the best. I hope the President wants to meet with me to apologize for not listening to me when I told him that the superpower person database could be used for bad purposes like terrorist driven genocide. Tuesday could have been a bloodbath.
Tony: That's true, and I'm sure she's less likely to yell at you for waking her up at 2 AM on Christmas.
Me: Also, please don’t watch that. I was high and my parents were murdered just months before. Not that I knew that at the time, but regardless I was in a really bad place in a relationship with somebody who did not love or respect me. Which totally explains why he secretly videotaped what we were doing and made millions off it.
“At least it’s an option now. We made the right choice coming up here if Hunter helped her get to that realization.” Steve rationalized.
Also, I think you forgot about crying in front of Yo-Yo and May on the way to the jet post Johannesburg or maybe you’re not counting that. I don’t know. Anyway, I think I’d rather do the other six questions through text message. Text message me in a few days.
We also have a new beta going forward on this story. SPNxBookworm will be taking over for Ursula who did a fabulous job. (This conversation also had additional assistance from KnowInsight.) Again, I would like to thank all the wonderful people who volunteered. I may end up calling upon you at some point in the future.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. The AOS season finale discussion moratorium is no longer in effect now that the episode has finally aired in the UK. (Although, because Ant-man and the Wasp was just released in the UK, I am extending the moratorium for another month, to be fair.)
Red phone: That I really can’t tell you. I have to go. Lila just came in carrying her cuddle bunny a.k.a. her Captain America Teddy bear. It’s as adorable as you are.
Tony: Mommy is in DC either kicking daddy’s ass or fucking him into the wall. Who really knows at this point? Neither of these activities should be done in front of small children so I’m babysitting, you know, in case Ross decides to ignore his own crumbling house and bust into mine. The compound has better protection than the apartments at the building formally known as Avengers Tower.
“I guess this means I really need to be on speaking terms with the other Avengers before that happens.”
Red phone: Of course he did. This really is my fault. All the depraved things I made Jarvis watch before. Of course Vision picked up some bad habits.
Francis: I don’t like thinking of it that way. One minute I was sitting down to have lunch with my wife and kids, and the next, they were gone.
Me: Oddly enough, knowing that Hydra tried to kill my dad multiple times before they brought out the Winter Soldier makes it easier to deal with. I’m still upset that they took out my parents and my pseudo-mother figure, but it’s easier to deal with things if I can focus everything on Hydra and not your best friend.
Me: Okay, I am pretty sure this was really revenge for forgetting to disable my pornographic text message filter when I promised Snookums that I would stop covering up talking to you with dirty, pornographic and expletive filled text messages about the various ways and locations I would like to give Cuddle Bunny fellatio.
Me: Despite what you said about his team. I also have 200 messages to respond to. I hate when email piles up.
Chief mechanic: Agent Agent, but I think part of that decision was because Phil is on the East Coast. I left him behind in DC to get the president to get his head out of his ass. As well as try to get a meeting with Director Rambeau. It’s good for him to have a distraction. Besides, as my BFF, I always try to return your messages myself.
Red phone: I’m a man of many talents. Although I’m sure the room will mostly be used for finger-painting with Lila and Nate. We are supposed to design new tactical gear for Aunt Natasha later today.
After being associated with SHIELD for nearly a decade and being thrown across the universe, really nothing should surprise Jemma. And yet she is still having difficulties accepting that another version of her boyfriend was thrown back 2 years into their timeline, or was it from a parallel dimension? She was trying to decide which possibility she found more comforting. Although, the fact that he saved May’s life with knowledge that could only come from living through it once is helping to alleviate her skepticism.
FRIDAY: Yes, but he did not take you seriously. He is in his lab, but merely because he’s working on a project not because he’s avoiding everyone.
This chapter contains spoilers for Spider-Man Homecoming, but hey the next movie’s out and Black Panther is coming around the corner (I already got my tickets to see an IMAX opening weekend), so I hope you’ve seen it by now, if you are so inclined. Besides, this is going to be a divergent point where things go differently. We also have slight allusions to the events of the Defenders in this.
“It’s a long story. I also regret assuming that Tony was just going along with things for his own selfish interests and for not trying to see things from his perspective. I realize that things were a lot more complicated than I wanted to see at the time.” Steve tells her.
Me: Still not happening. Even if we knew for sure this is actually a private conversation, the real thing is always better.
Tony: Which can’t happen until I can get all of you in the country. I feel like they should not adopt until things are stable, so that’s another reason to take the deal. Oh, maybe Red will save the money for the grandkids and not throw it off a cliff.
D Fitzsimmons: When this report is over, I really want to know about the LMD thing. I heard about them, but I've never seen one.
The next several chapters are already with my beta. I hope to update weekly, but we shall see. Let me know what you think and if you’re excited for things to come.
Counselor Laura: Honestly, I haven’t asked. I figured if you wanted me to know, you would tell me. I’ve been focusing on how to get back to my own timeline and what to do when I get there.
Friday: I am no longer allowed to foreword the thoughts of Mister Stark that he types out, but does not actually wish for you to read.
Purple Princess: Time travel and my alternate timeline self, who is still a normal AI pushing large amounts of data to me. Unfortunately, she was unaware I’m not an AI anymore. Not a normal one anyway. My body fried, and I think daddy wants Wanda to come to visit.
The Mechanic: Regardless, I do want to talk to Pepper Pot. Also, I will have Mary get Spider mom set up with the new job away from the husband.
Rogers: I need you to help me find somebody here that can help, that won’t give my location to the UN. Tony mentioned the possibility before.
The new consultant: Spidey is your friend or possibly more than a friend. We’re still in high school, there’s no real need for labels.
Tony needs someone who understands his life now. I understand that life now because I am part of that life now. Someone who understands who he is underneath the bravado and jokes. It took me a while to see that person, but I see him now.
Anthony: OK, how about for our first date, I will just text you snarky things from the charity ball Friday. That way we can hang out and I can keep my sanity intact.
Tony: Of course. You know they’re like my children, the good ones anyway. Okay, this may be because I don’t want my robots to try to kill me again. Never have it be said that I don’t learn from my mistakes.
You know I didn’t really like you that much even before I saw you snap my mother’s neck in Siberia. Howard always said good things about you, but I always thought that if you didn’t die then Captain America wouldn’t have went for suicide by nobility and then maybe he would’ve been around to keep Howard from being a bastard. Not that I framed it in those terms as a kid, but I think of it that way now because I know Steve way too damn well. He definitely has a lot of suicidal tendencies when it comes to you.
Girl Friday: I had no idea it was that late. Since the latest Wanda tuneup, I’m starting to become a bit more human in that regard. I’m sorry I texted you.
“I’m going with overthinking but please read.” At Tony’s words Steve does begin to read what he has so far.
HSBF: I don’t want to think about that possibility. I’d rather have you around. You are more important than money.
“I could see where Mister flaming head would come in handy.” That’s when he looks over to see an image of a flaming Hulk Buster. And this shouldn’t surprise him, considering what he saw his Audi do recently with Robbie behind the wheel. Tony tried to come up with a scientific explanation of the flaming Audi, but he’s just not able to.
Nomad: Are you guys getting along better now? How did the all-Spanish training exercise go a couple of days ago? I would have texted you sooner, but I’ve been busy.
Tony: Maybe I’ll wait until tomorrow when we’re in the air. I just want the next few hours to be just us and hopefully Yo-Yo will be so busy sending dirty IMs to her boyfriend that she won’t pour water on us.
Nomad: I don't know how I can help. I wasn't there. I should've been there, but I can't be because of that stupid Accord.
HSBF: But what if Ross got to him instead? What would he have done to a 15-year-old with spider powers?
“I’m well aware my boyfriend is bisexual and I’m fine that you are dating an alternate dimension version of him. However, I really want my Fitz back. I just want my Fitz back,” Simmons told everyone as her voice began to break.
How can you be trapped between dimensions? Apparently, it all involve something called dark matter and some book called the Darkhold or as Leo refers to it as the evil book of everything. One quick read and apparently you become walking evil with the knowledge of all things.
Me: Especially, considering I think someone decided that she would be going through the Cuddle Bunny text messages as punishment for her helping you get your toys out of lock up even though they're not actually supposed to know about that.
Tony: OK, things were going pretty good in Steve Roger’s life until this asshole in Germany started using people who are different as scapegoats in an effort to consolidate power and thus we get concentration camps.
Venom: That wasn’t about you. It’s been a long day [redacted], and it just caught up all at once. Although I really want to know more about this tingling.
It’s completely serendipitous that we get an update on Daisy and Loki the weekend before Loki begins.
: Codenames Baby Bird and Sparrow. She is a five-year-old “Inhuman” who can predict the future, but also see the past. I believe this is true because she knew about Eric and that knowledge could only come by some outside force. It is a deep shame known only to select few because they witnessed it.
Anthony: Well, not us directly, but Yo-Yo and Melinda are. Which is how she got, As Yo-Yo Puts it,  “touched by a ghost” that nearly killed her. I still want a rational explanation for that.
“You’re not leaving until next Friday. We have time.” Steve leaned over to kiss Tony again. Although just his cheek, this time. Any other body part would be too tempting.
Me: For some reason, I don’t believe you. If you would’ve called me earlier, I would’ve told you about the decision to give the credit to the Avenger initiative and not Shield. Technically, Agents Rodriguez and May have been detailed to the Initiative and I’m planning for Agent Leopold to also join.
Tony: Dave, my number two in R&D, does. He is really annoyed that the new upstate facility doesn’t have a pencil sharpener. He emailed me twice about it. Or rather, he emailed Friday and she found it amusing.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Me and Dr. Potts are also concerned. Tony and Steve moved an entire mini bar out of the lab and had to reinstate the breathalyzer protocol yesterday.
The new consultant: Is it true that Hale kept her daughter chained to her bed in her condo? Flash always felt something was off with Ruby.
“We will get him back,” Leo said as Simmons left the room, most likely on the verge of crying. Surprisingly, Leo didn’t follow behind.
“I’m going to put on something comfortable and then be prepared to bare your soul to me.” Surprisingly Steve was looking forward to that.
“I guess love is playing a big role in our lives right now because we wouldn’t be trying to undo what Thanos did if we didn’t love people.”
Purple Princess: Yes, which is also kind of how Flash figured out that Benji has a spider side. He took it surprisingly well, all things considered. He just passed out for a few hours, but he’s fine now.
“Oh. He agreed to take Robbie. That’s one less thing to worry about.” She was hoping he wouldn’t bring up what else was said. Maybe Phil will just focus on the job for the moment.
“Yes, we’ve spent more than a week together without catastrophe,” Tony told his boyfriend leaning over to steal a kiss.
Me: That I’m going to leave you or that we may not get to see each other again because of Ross or others?
Purple Princess: As soon as I can get someone to come to get you. Dad said he was sending somebody yesterday, but I can't confirm that with him right now because he's probably texting Cap Dad.
Nomad: I was joking. Pulp Fiction was on the list but Sam said that Tarantino is overrated and a couple words I can’t repeat so I haven’t watched it.
Venom: So how long have you known who Benji really is? Obviously, long enough to give me chocolate at the wedding. Why did I think it was a good idea to kiss a random superhero?
Anthony: Friday locked me out of my twitter account, but everything else is good. Really if twitter rants are the worst thing I’m doing, this is going really well.
Tony: OK so in exchange for you and the other Avengers getting no jail time for violating the original version of the Accords, all I have to do is agree to be the head of the ATCU until the new Accords are finalized+ 6 months for the transition or until the end of the administration. Which ever comes first.
"Most people feel that way about me," Tony remarked just as the commotion outside came to an abrupt halt. "See the yelling has already stopped and Davis hasn't sent a 911 text message yet. Nor did I hear an icer going off. I guess that's good."
Agent Laura: Hey Friday, can you see if Dr. Suarez survived the decimation and is available? I want to bring her in.
Me: Don’t ask. Just don’t ask. Also, Anthony never actually told Pepper that Coulson is not dead, so that was just not a good conversation.
“I am. I am not sure about him.” Bobo one replied. Hunter was healing his face with something that Bobo came up with. Note to self figure out what it is and see if it's something he could sell to Pepper.
Counselor Laura from 2023: At a minimum, I need to do at least two interventions and maybe help Tony Potts work through his Howard issues. It has to be easier the second time around, right?
StarkAE: As evident by several awkward lunches with Pepper Potts recently. Interesting euphemism by the way.
This conversation takes place between the two timelines. Isn’t that exciting? I had this planned before Simmons tried this in season 7 of AOS. I take pleasure in it being something plausible now.
Me: Okay, I am most grateful that we’re talking to each other again after what happened. After Siberia I thought we hurt each other too much to ever be OK again but we’re working on it. I think we’re going to end up stronger than we were. Honestly, I’m just happy we made it to the point where we are.
December 22, 2016. Group text with Tony Stark, James Leopold (A.k.a future Fitz) and Leopold Fitz soon to be Leopold Fitz-Simmons. (They are thinking a spring wedding.)
Venom: I deserve cuddling after finding out my boyfriend was sleeping with someone else and blaming it on me because I don't want to put out. After receiving a readout of last night's all Avenger's meeting, I think I understand why Benji was so amenable to cuddling.
D Fitzsimmons: As mentioned before, two weeks ago, things changed when Scott Lang mysteriously showed up five years after disappearing thanks to the Quantum Realm and the Pym particles. We had a new avenue to research. One that was more fruitful than the monoliths. That's when we decided to try to bring Stark on board.
Tony Potts: I want to know how that happened, but I feel like I need to learn more about Hydra's secret history and the fact that they kept killing off my family members. Also, there is the fact they kept using Steve’s BFF to do it. That’s just really fucked up.
"Do you want to talk about why the board is upset that you have a boyfriend?" Steve asked, trying to get this conversation to move in the right direction. Steve is starting to learn that it’s just as difficult to do this in person, as it was in text message format.
“Especially because Madeleine Rice is not an under qualified asshole. Like seriously, why did President Ellis not make her Secretary last time? Siberia would’ve never have happened. I’m like 90% sure Ross's appointment was a Malick suggestion, but I can’t prove it. He was appointed only 11 months before Malick was exposed as Hydra. Okay, yes, that was right during the murder bot fiasco but still.”
Me: I’m sure you could allow your baby brother to be with the love of your life without emotional support. He’s so head over feet in love with her, he doesn’t even respond to my flirting like you. At least you blush and get flustered.
Tony: Because he still acts like a child half the time or at least that’s what was said in my last unauthorized movie biography.
Congratulations to everyone who guessed that the last chapter was from the perspective of Clint’s cell phone. There may be a few more interludes along the way.
“Tuesday actually, which was later than I thought. Jane and Pepper agreed that I will need to be back in the country to participate in operation Damage Control. They’re still trying to decide if this involves a stint on the talk show circuit showing off pictures of my boyfriend. I’m going to probably have a few interviews with local press here as well tomorrow.” Steve is not sure how he felt about that. Mostly he was worried about what they would put Tony through.
Anthony: Wait, let’s back up a little bit. Pepper threatened to kill you? Pepper Pot threatened to kill you? See, I should read your messages before I go on a text messaging rent.
TMNS: Yes. Please don’t tell anyone else at school. Flash isn’t ready to be out publicly yet. Not at our school anyway. Although he is out at work. He kind of told you by accident because voice rec and Stark watches are complicated.
The new consultant: Yes. Honestly, the breakup was for the best. Also, I finally found out what happened on Valentine's Day, and it was terrible. I can't give details, so do not ask. However, your highness, I'm going to need your help in making sure the asshole ex-boyfriend gets blackballed from every college in the country. We would be doing the coed population a favor.
Tony: Again, things I don’t want to know about. Maybe we can talk about Benjamin. I think he should get his internship back.
Anthony: Joey the bullet proof pacifist wanted to go back to construction after killing a guy on his second mission. Even killing in self-defense makes him feel dirty. Which meant that he wouldn’t have to do with the Accords.
Tony: Well, he is the only one who actually knows exactly where the Tesseract was in 2018, so yes. His home planet was a big place. The Valkyries’ report had some missing details.
Anthony: No, I mean not telling Pepper or Happy for that matter. He’s not happy I’m dating other people. He was hoping that my near-death experience showed me the error of my ways.
“The Princess genius is probably still reading these messages and I don’t want her to tell her brother because I’m not quite sure how he feels about you at the moment. Especially when they are still in the country and I don’t exactly want to risk getting you turned over to the FBI or the CIA in an effort to improve international relations. The president named Ross, CIA Ross, official representative to the country until an ambassador is appointed. Which, you know won’t happen until a New Secretary of State is confirmed, probably sometime in January.”
Cuddle Bunny: I hate being so far away from you. And I know you’re not telling me how complicated things are. Clint still has contacts at Shield and the new leadership are making things as bureaucratic as ever. How are you really dealing with the break up being public? I hope you are not paying more attention to the stupid people then you should be? They don’t know you. They don’t know how big your heart is.
Also, the last few text messages of the chapter before are happening concurrently with the first part of this chapter.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. This conversation takes place about three days after the last one. Again, as much as Tony would love to do this five times a day, even twice a week is not necessarily safe.
Me: You were supposed to wait for me. You said you would. And of course they didn’t show the happy and emotionally stable gay couple kissing. Have to be able to show it in Russia.
That night when Steve found a platinum wedding ring hidden in the condom box, he said nothing. Either Tony will give it to him when he’s ready or Steve will find it when he’s ready to put it on. They have time.
I also wanted to contrast the Peter and Flash in this timeline compared to where they are in Far From Home. We’ve come a long way from that.
Anthony love is Tony Stark-Rogers’ current designation in his fiancé’s phone. His current Avenger network callsign is Director Stark. TMNS is Peter. Also, in this timeline, it’s Deputy Secretary of State James Rhodes.
“I have some creative control so I promise it will not end up like that travesty of the Captain America movie from 1990. Dad ended up suing them for that.” With good reason.
D FitzSimmons: This is actually closer to what I really did in our timeline than I would like to acknowledge. Obviously, he made a new timeline where he ends up married to Hunter. You and Bobo have really similar taste in men. I really want to know how that happened, but I am afraid to ask.
Anthony: She hasn’t asked for a new identity to get out of working with me, so that’s a positive start.
Blue phone: For you to be able to do that eventually, I need you to stay off of Ross’s radar. I need you to stay safe as well. I’m not sure I would fare any better if I lost you.
Jemma: I am a drunk mess. It's why I wanted us to get Fitz here first. I can’t do this without him. But he moved on.
Counselor Laura: Also, apparently, he's in charge of looking through my cell phone, so can you please delete this conversation.
Warning: Again this chapter goes into M territory because Tony has a dirty mouth (and maybe he’s trying to see if he can get Steve to sext him). After feedback, I decided that I’m doing two versions of at least this chapter and maybe the whole story (it really depends on how far Tony pushes things). On Archive of Our Own, you will be getting the full Tony Stark version. On fanfiction dot net you’re getting the edited by FRIDAY version where I will be editing in the same style that they use in the comic books to keep even the Deadpool comics T. I use the same username on both sites, so it should be easy to find the version of the story that fit your needs.
“It is going to take Afia a little while to create the gateway even with my and Shuri’s help. Maybe you should let the Dendrotoxin wear off on its own,” Leo explained.
Purple arrow: During the conference call yesterday, Deke said that Thanos wiped out half of all life in the universe. He also wouldn’t make eye contact with me.
Hunter: To avoid this Apocalypse, we both know that Leo will have to work with the grandkid. At a minimum, we want Laura back.
Chief mechanic: I know I’m part of an administration that loves WHiH and Fox News, but Jeffrey learned his lesson early on. Especially now that I’m making a joint appearance with my fiancé. Besides, you know I don’t like to give any company owned by Tiberius any actual business.
Purple arrow: Plus, you don’t want to send the Freaking Cool shippers into a frenzy again. They’re still getting over the shock of Stony being “canon,” and it’s been over a year.
“I was there when you purchased the ring, or rather my prior self was. I believe this is what you would call being engaged to be engaged. I am aware and happy about it,” the teenager told the two. Her voice was different than Friday’s, but the way she spoke was similar.
Cuddle Bunny: We saw and Clint said that you’re too much in love with someone else to even try to flirt with Laura.
Red phone: I assume that you saw her as a kindred spirit because she was just as lonely and lost as you were?
Venom: I’m not. I just broke up with my long-distance boyfriend because he was sleeping with someone else allegedly because I wasn’t ready to put out. Also, I just found out my two crushes are the same person. We need to talk.
Tony: Yes. This thing has been going on since before SHIELD collapsed. So some of that money came from people who turned out to be Hydra, so enjoy it in good conscience. You were the only one crazy enough to bet that Coulson would need to die a second time before he and May would get it together.
Love: Well, Twitter is saying that Tony is lying on his deathbed and the shareholders are holding a candlelight vigil. Allegedly, he was suffocated by a paramedic. The image of Pepper crying as she was leaving the hospital really sold it. Okay, the fact that she punched out the reporter really sold it. I had to tranquilize Nomad a second time because of that, after he made my other eye black and blue.
Boss: Seriously, why do they keep using the honeypot technique on Cuddle Bunny and why does he keep falling for it?
Leo vaguely remembered seeing an image similar to this on Noah’s screen hours before the monoliths exploded and sent him 22 months back in time. Meaning that after today, he would know nothing about what is to come except from Robin’s drawings. Even with the help of the council of elders, the Princess, her new stepfather, and a team of psychologists, Robin was still having trouble processing what she sees.
This letter was written a few hours after the last one before Tony’s fun dinner with his friends, but was not read until the next day. You’ll see.
Thank you for reading or commenting. You're beautiful and absolutely encouraging. For those of you concerned about Pepper, we will be hearing more about what's going on with her later on but it's time for a Steve moment.
Tony: It would be especially cruel now that the press knows about her breakup. That would be just pouring salt on the wounds. We don’t do that sort of thing to each other. Especially, when the press is involved.
“So annoying. I get why you don’t want to be with the others. It can be overwhelming.” Sitting in a room with a woman who looks exactly like his dead wife but who isn’t her is more than just being overwhelming, but he’s not sure how to explain that to Natasha. He doesn’t even know where to begin. So, he just glares at her.
“Shush, sweet pea. My turn. Most people thought I was at another school until Obadiah leaked the truth to the press. Which really should’ve told me right then how much of a dick he was, but I didn't see it at the time.”
Okay, that was a fast reply. I haven’t even switched to the other account yet. Yes, I will invite Pepper to Thanksgiving myself. And I’ll take care of things the day of.  I’m not that helpless.
Tony: There was also the fiasco with me in a fight with other superheroes in Germany due to our stellar communication skills. I don’t think she slept for at least three days because of that mess. Jane is also not happy that I refuse to throw Benji to the wolves for the sake of the bottom line.
“Thank you so much. As I’ve gotten older, I’m not quite in to public sex anymore. Although quick question; where is Happy? You didn’t have to knock him out? ”Tony asked a little concerned.
“Because most of us were coming up here for the anniversary party since Fitzsimmons work out of this facility now.” Because Simmons is three months pregnant and outside of Fitz and her doctor, only Tony knows and therefore assigned her someplace far away from the chaos.
Me: Why do I have this sick feeling that you only came to this realization because you nearly died yesterday?
Me: And it just goes downhill from here. There’s no way you can answer question six straight without telling the world who you really are. I mean you actually know what it’s like to be 90 years old with the mind and body of a 30-year-old. Asking you to choose would be difficult.
Me: Well Spidey Brat fucked up and I had to save his ass and a ferry filled with people. Or maybe I fucked up bringing a 15-year-old into our fight or fighting with you in the first place.
Kitty brother: You could get hurt, again. You almost destroy your lab once due to inventing when sleep deprived. It’s why limitations were imposed on you when you were 12.
“Because Piper would prefer if I showed up to breakfast wearing pants, and after what happened earlier, I felt like I should oblige her.” Steve told his boyfriend, blushing, remembering the incident from earlier in the morning.
PS: I’m sure he didn’t tell you but he’s on medical restriction for the next few weeks. No Iron Man and no sexual activities. At least with you being in another country, one of these restrictions will be observed. If he behaves that restriction might be lifted before Johannesburg.
Agent M: No. But who knows who The General would bring in to take care of it and that’s your best-case scenario. The Secretary would be worse.
Peter is 99% sure that if he was not Spider-Man, he would’ve dropped his phone. Although his mortified look led to Flash and MJ looking over his shoulder to see what he was reading.
HSBF: Yes, actually by Senator Christopher Ward. Why are they still playing that considering I am a wanted war criminal?
Blue phone: Although, when you put your new team together, you should try to focus on acquiring someone who is at least old enough to vote.
Nomad: No, you just happened to call out my name when climaxing. I haven’t been in that many relationships, but I don’t think that’s okay.
"But I know if May could be with Phil again, she would drop me in a second. I’m okay with that. We are each other’s anchor.”
Me: Yes, because I’m pretty sure Pepper is the first person I’ve had sex with since college that knew going in that she was sleeping with Tony Stark, the emotionally screwed up person and not Tony Stark media persona. She couldn’t deal with Tony Stark, superhero, but no one’s perfect, not even my Pepper Pot.
Nomad: Spying on me for version of Shield that was really Hydra. I didn't even know your real name at the time.
Ms. Potts is available for Thanksgiving. I had Kevin block the days on her schedule, but you have to invite her yourself. I will work with the caterers but you are dealing with everything that day. I’m having that day off with my family. They hate that I’m an hour and a half away now.
Red phone: Not literally. I said it in a more diplomatic way that would not result in you yelling “Language” at me.
Remember, we have a 30-day moratorium in effect for all spoilers related to new MCU content. However, if you need more Loki, please check out my short story Love is a Dagger (My Heart Has Been Stabbed Many Times).
Ana Jr.: Of course, unlike what you assumed, Leopold Fitz did not die in the explosion. He was transported back in time.
We are now stepping into another one of my great writing exercises. Basically, for this chapter, I put on Star Trek Beyond and started writing Tony and Steve snarky dialogue while watching the movie. If anybody has looked at my Twitter account to read my Agents of Shield tweets, you know I’m good at this. I did go back and edit, but I wrote the initial draft live as if a real text message date was going on (with me playing both sides).
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last letter. You are all wonderful. I was originally planning for this letter and the previous one to be together in the same conversation. However, after Tony’s letter to Happy reached over 800 words, I knew I would have to split them up. Somehow this chapter is even longer.
Tony: We are still on for dinner tonight with the MIT crew. Also, despite knowing Vaidya technically longer than he’s known me, Rhodey Bear says we can’t tell him who you really are for national security reasons. So you have to pretend that you actually were married to our fellow classmate. I’m sending you a dossier to memorize. But hey at least you’ll have something to do now.
Genius Princess 2018: That seems out of character from what we know about the purple one from Robin’s drawings. I would like to hear the story of how Hunter became Tony’s nanny.
The Big Boss: You do tend to be productive regardless of where you are when you’re in the mood to be productive.
Counselor Laura: Possibly. Although they have no trouble with you fostering now, even with Steve moving back soon. See picture attached.
“But as you already told me a couple of hours ago, the history books are not accurate. Nobody knows about Steve Rogers's half-sister.”
StarkAE: I‘m probably gonna have to replace that. Thankfully, if you allow paparazzi to take shots of you in their cars, you get one for free. Also, driving lessons will be added to the training curriculum.
"OK, emails are all done," Tony said after dictating the last message to Ana. "How did your phone call go?”
FRIDAY: That would be prudent. The man accompanying her is a 92% visual match for the image of Agent Coulson on file. However, he has a prosthetic arm despite outward appearances.
Jemma: I’m not really his grandmother. I just share the same DNA with her. I’m never going to be his grandmother.
"I was going to email Laura, to check up on Spidey. That technically counts because she’s now Shield, but she did it for love." So, her husband could come back to her and her kids.
“Yes, and yes. Leo prevented the Watchdog backer from interfering with the elections, and Ellis was open to renegotiating once he was reelected. Your counterpart helped with the negotiations. Several countries including Malta, South Korea, and Wakanda backed him up.” Laura explained.
Football Hunter: Both valid responses when you see the woman who forced you to have sex with her in a virtual prison and then went off the deep end when you said no in the real world. Have I apologized yet for my other selves’ love floppy joke? I’m never good at gauging the room.
“I’m sure you just want me comfortable. Lucky for you, I stopped sleeping in the nude once I became responsible for a small child.” And that’s the second time Steve thought about a naked Tony in the last 10 minutes. “It seems like every other night, there was a monster under her bed, and she always comes to me after she caught Hunter with his special friend. I banned sleepovers after that. Although now I know that friend was Simmons.”
Tony: Okay, he probably won’t be back in the morning. I know you want Deke back, but we're working on it. And to do that, we need Hunter.
"Yes, it gets a little less awkward each time.” Steve leans over and kisses Tony on the mouth again. “Things are awkward between you and me too but at least we can do that. I’m enjoying this. Your tongue is awesome.”
Anthony: I even sold off most of the former Avenger floors. I’m only keeping the new penthouse with guest rooms, Laura’s apartment, and another apartment for my live-in assistant. Of course, because Happy and Elena can’t get along, Yo-Yo has moved into one of my guest rooms.
Me: He started college at 14 which was way too young. Tony finished undergrad at 16 with multiple degrees because he was that good, including one in music that most people don’t know about.
Nomad: Although is Commander Spock dating both Lt Uhura and Captain Kirk in the new timeline? It kind of seems that way. I was under the impression that polyamorous relationships were only slightly more accepted now.
Agent 13: It's hard to watch someone you love die, especially if they are your entire world. It's even worse when there's nothing at all you can do to stop it from happening. I've done it twice. It doesn't get easier. The first time I wasn't ready for it and trying to prove myself at my new job seemed the best course of action at the time. I don't handle death very well.
Anthony: That was before I almost got killed by fried bread. I'm not going to risk it. You’re very important to me. As much as I need to touch you, keeping you safe is more important. Besides I'm still going to that South African environmental conference in a couple of weeks.
Me: I was hoping I could distract you with my witty conversational skills since you still will not have telecommunication sex with me.
So far, I know that there are lots of portals surrounding Sakaar. I wonder if I can manipulate the portals with my powers? It’s something I can ask Loki about when I’m speaking to him again.
P Parker: Maybe you should talk to Dr. Stark-Rogers or use the other channel that we created on your phone.
Cuddle Bunny: I did not choose Bucky over everything. I just… I’m not even sure how to talk about it.
Me: So it was just good to hang out with my friends and the kids. OK Lily Bear really was just happy her parents did not argue the entire dinner.
Tony Potts: Okay, and she dumped the asshole. Turns out, he was fucking around with someone else. Please tell me that Pepper did not marry that guy in the other timeline.
This is the first chapter of the second batch of chapters. Of the 13 chapters, only one was written after AOS season seven premiered. I am going to be incorporating some elements from AOS season seven. There’s a lot of history that will enhance the story. However, there’s one thing that threw a wrench into things (Endgame did that too, but we were able to ignore that), and I am still deciding how I’m going to handle that. I have an idea, but I think I want to wait until the season is done to put it into play. This is why I’m going to keep with the updating every other week schedule until at least the end of AOS.
Tony: Understandable. So both Steve and Stefan lost their mom at a young age. Steve’s mom died of tuberculosis and Stefan’s mom died of HIV or maybe breast cancer. I can’t remember what we mentioned in the initial press release.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all absolutely wonderful. Sorry it took more than a week for an update on this story. I had family visiting and other commitments that kept me from finding time to post.
“It’s not the same framework. For example, in this new framework if you die in there, you won’t die in the real world.”
Red phone: That’s not 20 questions. That’s sexting. Totally different. I have no idea. I haven’t been keeping count. I think our only rule is ask whatever question you want to ask, but just don’t expect an answer.
I don't know what Howard would've wanted. Our relationship wasn't that close and well, he worked on the Manhattan project. I don't know how his conscience works. Maybe he felt creating Shield balanced out all of his sins. Then again he drank like a fish so all of his sins were right there at the surface.
I'm always going to love you. That's not going to change. But we changed. We don't fit together, not like we used to so we should find a new way to work. And I don't know how to do that, at least not quickly. I want it so maybe that's half the battle. I am willing to do dinners and lunches with you and the boyfriend. Although, next time let's make sure that the entrée won't kill me.
Tony: We are combining the research together but going with the Framework name because barf is a bad acronym.
Love: Fucking Bastards. I want to shove an arrow up his ass. I also want to get Corey that video game he wanted, but you told me I’m not allowed to reward bad behavior.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. Greetings from the road. You’re getting this now because today I have an hour of free time and the hotel has Wi-Fi. I’ve won’t be able to reply to that many reviews but I will when I’m able to. This is our longest chapter so far because Tony and Steve have a lot to talk about.
However, Tony doesn’t understand why you stopped being friends. According to Tony that happened long before the breakup. Why have things gotten so stiff and painful between the two of you? Tony blames himself as he tries to analyze what went wrong. You know, Tony. He likes to fix things. He wants to make sure that what happened between the two of you won’t happen between us. More importantly he wants to be your friend. Your friendship is very important to him. Tony’s not sure how to get that back, but he wants to and isn’t that the first step?
Tony absolutely loves his boyfriend completely without a doubt. Although, there are moments where he doesn’t necessarily like him very much. The most recent moment when Tony had such thoughts involved his boyfriend making him spend breakfast with Sam and Romanoff. Especially when they could be in bed together, since Tony had nowhere to be before noon. (He feels like he needs to send Agent May a giant thank you basket or flowers for teaching Steve the thing with the tongue and the fingers.)
“He purchased it when he was in Wakanda. Or rather we allowed him to purchase it. Normally, he wouldn’t have been able to,” Princess Shuri explained.
TMNS: Of course, I didn’t think you would do that. You don’t really care if you’re still a pariah at school because you have real friends now. You don’t throw those friends under the bus. If popularity was all you cared about, everybody would know that you are best friends with Aifa Stark-Rogers, and Tony Stark-Rogers was practically your guardian for a year. You don’t even tweet that much anymore.
The first set of email addresses are Peter and Tony’s Avenger addresses, because of course Tony set up a highly encrypted Avengers only email system (that Daisy/Quake totally broke into and therefore Fitz now has access to).
“Or we can do it tomorrow. I feel like you need me for this. At a minimum, we should get the minibar out of here.” Laura said, pointing to the bar.
Me: Look, “not evil shield” is trending. Along with “new shield.” The rebranding is already working because nobody wants to type in that long name. Especially, with the character limit.
Tony: I’m well aware California is going to be highly unpleasant and not just because you’re not with me. I’m still trying to figure out how much I want to yell at Happy. Or him yell at me or vice versa. It’s all really complicated.
The first two images are safe for work, the other three, made Tony spit out his coffee. This is why this story is now rated M.
Actually don't even listen to the SI press release because at least half of it is pure BS. Also, you should probably take whatever I tell you with a grain of salt because I may or may not have been dying of Palladium poisoning for about six months and told no one. I am the master of pretending to be fine when I’m not. I’ve been working on that in therapy. Try not to do the same thing.
“Hey honey, I know you have your heart set on Central Park for our wedding next month, but what do you think about a lighthouse in upstate New York just off of Lake Ontario? You know where mommy Fitz lives now.” Tony asked the hologram of Steve standing next to him. It was nice to be able to use the hologram technology with his fiancée, now that he would soon be coming home.
Me: Funny. Thankfully for you, I am not one for genetic engineering. And Dr. Radcliffe did develop that gas that could have turned most of Europe into super powered zombies under duress. Which is better than we can say about my apocalypse.
Venom: Beyond the impending apocalypse. I really don’t want to become dust. I hope for us to avoid that.
Chief mechanic: Sentient metal. I’ve always suspected something like that, but I am still surprised. Did the nearly reconstructed hammer let Joey pick it up?
“If Pierce can get confirmed, anybody can get confirmed. Although, does the director have any experience in the realm of diplomacy? Beyond getting you out of jail in various countries.”
Blue phone: I agree with you about keeping Queens in reserve. You can find others. There’s been an influx thanks to the alien contagion.
Counselor Laura: That must’ve been brutal. Also, it's always hard for people to ask for help. I relapsed three times before I agreed to go to rehab. It's even harder to ask again when you've been rejected before.
Me: How long until someone like that senator who hates you tries to declare people with powers not human and therefore, not entitled to protection under the law?
Daisy is Cousin Q, and Michelle refuses to have any other codename besides MJ, especially in her own phone.
Counselor Laura: You can’t change the behavior of others. You may wish you could, but you can’t. You can only change your behaviors. Guilt is not helpful. It hinders progress.
I really am sorry for my actions last spring. I’m well aware that I hurt Tony. I think you’re well aware of how far you will go to protect a friend. It’s even more complicated when both parties involved are your friend. I didn’t want to hurt Tony, but I did anyway. If I could do it all over again, I would make different choices, but you can’t change the past. You can only learn from it and rebuild the bridges that you burned down.
Me: I’m equally terrified. I mean, my last serious relationship ended in tears and my stomach getting pumped. Cuddle Bunny and I are going to take things slow and work on building our relationship up as much as we can.
He’s not perfect. He’s impulsive sometimes and there was an incident a couple of months ago where things went really badly because he never really did process his mother’s death, but he’s working on it. We’re working through it and I think he’s the person I’m going to spend the rest of my life with. I hope it’s a long one. I’m scared that it won’t be, but I’m hopeful. He makes me hopeful.
