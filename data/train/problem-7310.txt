Silence.
He was pulling out cuffs. He had cuffs?
“Tony?”
I grumbled a little at that but I guessed it was fair, all things considered.
I purposefully ducked my head and pushed
Steve pursed his lips.
“I suggest you don’t attempt to do that again,” the Maw said in a bored tone as Tony attempted to get his breath back.
My hindbrain started screaming.
Thanos hummed lightly, gesturing to his right with his gauntleted hand. “Come Stark and sit with me for a while.”
I noticed the way Bucky was watching us, waiting to see what I would do. Steve clearly didn’t want to put his hands on me but it was obvious he would if he felt he had to. We were at a impasse.
Bucky nodded his head in agreement.
“Is he a mutant?” I asked. I looked the alpha up and down. “Are you?”
No, it was stupid. There was no guarantee the seatbelt would save me. I was going to get myself killed. And even if I somehow survived and managed to take Bucky out I would still have one very big and very angry Alpha on my tail.
...I hesitated. It had been a long time since I last set foot in an actual town and I could feel a cold sweat break out across my forehead as I considered all the things that could go wrong. I hastily wiped a dirty cuff across my brow and wondered if the inhabitants would realise I was alone and unaffiliated. I wondered if they’d care.
My ideals frightened my mom. She was so deeply indoctrinated that questioning anything was unthinkable. When I was a little older I began to realise that the sadness that perpetually accompanied her was due to a lifetime of oppression and abuse. Yet despite all of the terrible things she experienced she still expected me to follow in her footsteps. She didn’t want me to question the system. The very idea terrified her.
“OK,” I said, my voice rising and garnering the attention of over a dozen pairs of eyes. “You need to get out of my way, now.”
. He resisted the urge to lower his gaze when the mad titan’s violet eyes swept over him, the lips of the bastard twisting into a serene smile that didn’t belong on the face of a mass murderer.
“Hush,” the beta said, pressing her hand against my chest despite the fact I wasn’t struggling. “The alpha out there. Is he yours?” I pressed my lips together and then felt my entire body stiffen in shock as the beta pressed her fingertips against my mating gland. “Huh, I didn’t expect that. Aren’t you quite the find.”
“And I know of one surefire way to get them,” I grumbled.
“Don’t -“ I cried, going still when I felt his hand grab my nape. All it would take was for him to press down and I wouldn’t be able to breath. Death from suffocation. Would it feel like drowning?
“I don’t mean you’re not weak or anything,” he hastened to add, looking a little worried that I might be insulted.
My hindbrain told me I needed to stay still and quiet.
“Stark,” Nebula said, her soft voice surprisingly soothing. “I’m no expert but aren’t terran’s -- pinker in colour?”
“So I’ve heard,” Tony said, which was the understatement of the century. His eyes were inevitably drawn to Nebula, taking in her crumpled, unmoving form. “So you’re what, torturing her?”
He’d stopped reacting whenever the Maw called Thanos ‘their’ father. It was a surefire way to make the alien hurt him and he didn’t have the energy to stave off the aliens deceptively jarring backhanders.
“I think we’ve already established that I’m afraid of you, He-Man.”
“OK,” I said evenly. “But I can’t really control it.”
“I’m actually pretty good. Filled up on power bars.”
I snorted at him. “Yeah, OK --
Did I really want to be kidnapped, raped and forced to carry on humanity?
“That’s me,” I said, flashing him the most insincere smile I could muster. “Remarkable. I can speak without screaming and have the balls not to show my throat everytime an alpha looks at me. I’m a king among my kind.”
“Seatbelt,” Bucky said brightly, strapping himself in. He sounded pretty damn chipper considering he’d looked like the living dead a couple of days ago.
Bucky took the choice out of my hands, grabbing me by the waist and lifting me into the driving seat like I weighed nothing at all. “Stay,” he said, his scent urgent and commanding. He slammed the door behind him and quickly disappeared from view.
He frowned and I suddenly realised where i was and who I was with. Pissing the man off probably wasn’t the smartest move. I leaned back nervously, bearing my throat.
Both men exchanged unreadable looks. “It’s not like I haven’t been drenched in worse bodily fluids” Bucky said, using a bottle of water to wash himself down. “You think you can keep your stomach acid to yourself for the rest of the ride?”
“Home sweet home,” I said flatly. “I can hardly wait.”
The grip tightened as another hand circled Tony’s throat. Not squeezing. Not yet, but the threat was clear. Keep struggling and risk a throttling.
“Be still and be calm and all will be well.”
Had he still been lying there Tony was sure he would have been crushed. Nebula sat up, her arm still locked around his waist as she pulled his back against her chest and continued to edge backwards.
She turned two inky black eyes on Tony, full of pain and exhaustion. “You’re alive, Stark,” she noted flatly.
Steve opened the car and took my arm in a surprisingly gentle hold. He pulled me out until I was standing between them. His hand reached into my waistband and he pulled out Bucky’s gun -- the gun I had forgotten about in my terror -- I was such a fucking idiot. Both men looked me over, assessing and deadly.
“We’re here and I don’t want to risk anyone’s life because you decided to make Steve drive into the town without the use of the front entrance.”
“You won’t last on your own," Steve continued earnestly. "You have to realise that.”
“Yeah,” he whispered, unable to control the way he was shaking. “I’m calm.”
Bucky sat up in the tub and leaned back with a satisfied sigh. “They’ve seen worse Steve.”
I looked over his shoulder and saw Bucky tending to a small fire. There was a tent behind him that didn’t look nearly big enough to hold all three of us and further back I could make out a small oasis. I hesitated and Steve clearly noticed. “You coming?”
Trapped in a confined space with a pissed off alpha made me want to curl up in a circle and hide. I leaned away and waited for him to do whatever the hell he was going to do to me as punishment.
When he opened his eyes he flinched so violently he thought his bones were going to crack. The creature, the one that kidnapped strange,
She didn’t respond. Tony hugged himself, warring with the need to go to her and not wanting to piss off the Titan. He hesitated before gesturing slowly. “Can I?”
He caught my wrist before I could open the door. We sat there for a tense moment, watching one another. “I’m sorry, but you really don’t get a choice. This will be a lot easier for you if you just relax. We aren’t going to hurt you.”
“Go back to sleep, Tony,” the alpha muttered sleepily. “You’re safe. Just sleep.”
I bit back my immediate response, which was to tell him to fuck off. “What time is it?” I asked, feeling all sorts of groggy. God, what I would have given for a cup of coffee.
“It would take nothing to break him,” the Ebony Maw hissed, digging his fingers into the engineers skull and squeezing hard enough to earn a ragged gasp of pain. “
“Secure him,” Steve said, his face impassive as stood up and left the booth, approaching the barman.
She had taught me so much. She had taught me how to love.
“You truly are soft hearted creatures, to care for a woman you barely even know. It is a weakness, Stark.”
“It’s difficult to remember everyone doesn’t act that way. That some people are -- softer-- kinder.”
“Why, worried about your broodmare?” I snapped automatically.
“I know that! I do -- I -”
I noticed Bucky wasn’t with us.
He tried to seek our Nebula's eyes but she refused to acknowledge him. Instead, her inky gaze was locked on the Titan. Tony didn’t need to be a mind reader to know what she was thinking. He just hoped she had enough sense to bide her time and wait for an opportunity to present it self. Attacking him now would be paramount to suicide.
Her gait was quick and Tony couldn’t keep up. He was hurt. Hurt bad too. He couldn’t -
“It is not for us to ask questions of our father, Chōṭā,” the Maw cooed, all soft and gentle before his expression morphed into something sharp and mocking. “Now get up, before I have you dragged.”
“Go on then,” the Titan said. “Go fix her.”
“Stark's mind is unlike any I’ve ever encountered,” Thanos said, intrigued by the way the terran sucked in a deep, fearful breath before going limp. Other than the faint trembling of his broken body he remained still and silent. It was an act of appeasement -- of showing a more powerful adversary that he posed no threat. Thanos wasn’t fooled. Given the opportunity the little terran would destroy them all. “Such a mind would be a worthy addition to our family.”
“If I let you go, what will you do? I hope you’ll forgive me for saying so but you don’t exactly look like you’re in the best of health. You said earlier that you hadn’t eaten in, what was it, three days? You’re underweight, you’re filthy and you stink like fear and sickness. So what will you do if I let you go?”
“I’m not sure,” the larger man said, opening his door and stepping outside. He looked at me expectantly but I refused to budge. “It’s getting late though. The sun’s going to set in a few hours. I thought maybe we could take a dip before then. Clean up maybe.”
He shattered the window with his metal arm and leaned in, unlocking the door and grabbing me by the arm. “I suggest you get out carefully, otherwise you might cut yourself on the glass.”
“Where exactly do you imagine you would go?” the Maw asked in a bored, uninterested voice. It seemed to be his default setting around Tony, at least when he didn’t sound like he wanted to throttle him.
I woke up saturated in a vaguely familiar but unwelcome scent. It took maybe two seconds for the panic to kick in.
“Is that all you have to say?”
“Sorry, friend but that isn’t going to happen. Just chill out, OK? I don’t want to hurt you.”
“It’s time to go,” Steve said, stepping beside Bucky with easy familiarity. “You guys ready?”
Was he kidding! Run where? They were in the middle of the fucking desert. There was nowhere to go and I doubted one gun was going to do me much good against a pack of outlanders.
“It’s not going to be like that,” Bucky said softly, his shoulder hunched up. “No one is going to force you, Tony. We just need you to stay with us. We need people.”
He seemed to realise his mistake pretty quickly. “I didn’t mean -”
Even so, he still looked pretty gnarly. I tried to push aside the nagging voice in my brain telling me it was my fault. I refused to feel guilty after they kidnapped me and refused to let me go. It was self defence, damn it.
“No,” Tony gasped, struggling harder. He thought back, trying to remember. He had been alone with Nebula and she was scared. The ship was destroyed and she had been so sure her father would return for her.
His papa was his whole world. They might not have been a perfect family, but to Peter, his papa was perfect. He did his best to care for Peter and his friends. He sacrificed everything to keep those he cared about safe. The world looked up to Captain America. He was the world’s hero. But he was Peter’s hero too.
Peter just shrugs.
Steve would have to reveal who he really was and how he came to know the billionaire. Pepper had been helping create a story that would make the most sense. It wasn’t like they could come forward and talk about the night Steve and Tony met. Tony’s reputation would be tainted. Tony Stark wasn’t a rapist. He wasn’t a bad alpha.
“Just a preview of tonight,” Steve smirks.
The tears don’t stop streaming down Peter’s face. They mesh with the falling rain, but Peter doesn’t care. He’s never felt so alone. So broken.
Rhodey rolls his eyes playfully and gestures toward the sofa. Tony smiles and drags his friend over, pushing him down on one side and then plopping down next to him.
“When...when I said I missed you. I-Tony, I didn’t mean it. I mean, I did but...I’m sorry. I know we’re just friends.”
“Have a seat,” Tony gestures to the couch. “I’m gonna walk Happy out.”
“So where is Steve?” Tony decides to ask, though a part of him regrets bringing Steve up. Natasha will only ask more questions Tony doesn’t want to answer.
“Can I go too? Please?”
“Girl.”
Pepper winces and leans against the bench. “What did you do?”
“What about when we want to come back?”
Peter nods. “Yeah. We were supposed to work on it after he got back but…”
It had been a shock to learn that one of his teammates had a wife and children. Fury had kept Clint’s family a secret, just like he had been doing with Steve’s. It made Steve feel better about bringing a child into his world. He knew his son was in good hands and out of harm’s way.
“I guess I’m just scared,” Tony admits. “I know you’ll be in good hands here but...I won’t be here and Morgan...she’s going to need you.”
Peter yawns and stretches in his blanket, one hand slipping free and Tony tucks it back in. It’s a miracle his son is alive and unharmed. Tony had only got a small preview of what Hydra had been doing to his son. He was thankful help had arrived when it had.
Steve gives him another hug before setting him down. Peter runs off to the living room. Tony waits until he’s out of earshot before turning back to Steve.
“Come here, Petey.” Steve opens his arms and Peter rushes into the room and crawls his way up the bed until he’s in the strong arms. Steve cuddles his son close. “Bad dream?”
“No you weren’t. All you care about is yourself. He never mattered, did he? I bet I didn’t. That’s why you were never around.”
“It’s okay to feel this sort of pain. You’ve been trying to hide from it,” JARVIS says.
“Hmm.” Steve thinks it over. “What about here? We have the space and it’s secluded.”
Steve sends his mate an unamused look and quickly snatches the phone from Tony’s hand, ignoring the cry of protest he makes.
“Don’t worry about it,” Sam waves a dismissive hand and turns back around to properly introduce himself. “You’re not the first one to scent me like that, and you probably won’t be the last. I’m Sam Wilson.”
Tony half expects Steve to shut down and shy away from him or demand he leave. But instead he’s taking a deep, shaky breath, ready to prepare himself.
He’s forced down the stairs and into the living room where another familiar alpha greets them. At first Steve appears hopeful that it’s only Rumlow and Rollins, but then a few more members of their team emerge from the shadows, all of them with guns raised.
“Honey-”
“I was but Nat beat me to it. Besides, I’d rather stay back and keep an eye on you.”
Happy’s gaze falls on Steve and he gives the omega a small nod of acknowledgement, then he turns back to Tony. “Just don’t do anything stupid while you’re gone.”
“Steve, I’m sorry. I was gonna go but then…” Tony pauses, almost as if he can’t say what he means.
“I figured. You know I was really freaking out back there. I wasn’t sure if I’d have to deliver this kid.”
“What happened?” Bucky asks. He hasn’t moved from his seat since he first arrived, hadn’t spoken a word either. He stayed silent while Tony caught both him and Sam up to speed. He was broken and confused, that much Tony could tell. And he had every right to be. Steve was his best friend.
“Currently wondering where you are.”
Tony inhales sharply. “Okay. So I don’t have to worry about that arm of yours?”
“No. Tony-”
“I’m sorry. I just...I needed a minute. But I’m here now and I’m ready. I’m ready to do this.”
Happy’s expression hardens and his hands roll into fists. Pepper wasn’t worried about any alpha’s showing their dominance; everyone except herself and Agent Romanoff were betas. But that didn’t mean a fight wouldn’t break out.
Steve cries out again. His eyes squeeze shut and the grip he has on the bed sheets tightens. He tries to switch positions, remembering how that helped whenever the pain would hit. He’s been through this before, but he doesn’t recall it being this uncomfortable.
He decides to give his son one last chance to tell them the truth. “Pete, you can talk to us. You know that, right? Anything at all.”
After Morgan has had her fill and she’s burped, it’s not surprising to find her yawning and eyes fluttering shut. Tony is careful when he takes her back to her crib, hoping she remains asleep.
“Friday, what’s the time?” Steve asks the A.I. He works on finishing the last bit of preparation while he waits for her to respond.
Steve thanks them again and the pair leaves. Another presence lingers and Steve lifts his head, finding the other agent still in the room.
“What is that thing?” Steve gestures to the gadget resting in Tony’s lap. “Sorry,” he quickly apologizes when Tony peers up at him. A small grin crosses over his face and Steve relaxes.
“They’ll be okay,” Happy assures. Then he’s frowning and asks, “Pups?”
“Yeah.” Steve nods in agreement. He was already feeling the effects of not getting enough rest. “You going to stay?”
Her dad is fast asleep, a position she rarely finds him in. Getting a full 8 hours just wasn’t his style. Her papa said he had always been that way. She almost feels bad for wanting to wake him.
“Don’t lie to me. I can smell you. I can-” the alpha pauses and reaches down with his free hand, pressing his palm into the omega’s groin. “-feel you. You want this. You’re only good for one thing.”
“Hey, bud,” Steve greets and cranes his neck to peek over Peter’s shoulder to greet Ned with a little wave, then he turns back to his son. “I know you guys are doing homework but I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”
“I know, baby. Almost done,” Steve soothes. He focuses on the tiny buttons, brows furrowed in concentration as he works them closed. They snap shut and he pulls away, frowning when he realizes he missed a couple and Peter’s leg is visible.
Tony makes sure he’s done everything correctly before serving himself some coffee. He lounges lazily on the sofa, sipping from his cup and browsing through the blueprints of his latest suit. Steve emerges a few minutes later, not as bright as he usually is in the mornings. The pregnancy was taking a toll on him. Or maybe Tony finally had some luck on his side.
He doesn’t bother with building suits. That had been given up a long time ago. The decision to step away from Iron Man was difficult; he and the suit were one, but it was just another painful reminder. He didn’t feel worthy of the suit anymore.
“Why?” Steve interrupts. “Why do we need a story? The world doesn’t need to know about me or the pups. We’re fine.”
Flash was walking in their direction, his own group of friends beside him. They’re laughing and talking about something Peter doesn’t catch, but knowing them, it was probably bragging about the poor kid they’ve made their victim before the first bell even rang.
“It’s okay. Come on.”
Steve chuckles softly. “Yeah.”
“I think she has more than enough, honey.”
Tony arrives as soon as he can, and he’s brought Bruce with him. Happy greets them immediately and ushers them to the bedroom where Steve has been for a majority of the day. Happy explains the situation but Tony doesn’t hear all of him. All of his attention is on his omega.
“Please?” Peter whimpers and he holds his father’s hand tighter. “Don’t go. Please don’t go.”
“Morning, sweetheart.” Tony moves onto his husband, planting a kiss on Steve’s cheek.
Steve leaves, slamming the door on his way out. Tony rushes to the door and throws it open, peering out into the hall and watching Steve disappear. With a heavy sigh, Tony closes the door and leans against it, one hand running through his hair and tugging at the strands in frustration.
“Fine,” Tony gives in. “I guess it’s better than nothing. Now hurry up. You need a shower.”
“Yeah. I think we all could use one.”
“It’s not that simple!” Peter’s voice rises slightly. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. “You don’t think I tried? But I couldn’t do it.”
“Oh yeah. It’s Thursday. Can you just skip today?”
“Yeah. Because we’re super strong!”
Tony sighs. “You’ve done this before, huh?”
Maybe his papa was right. Maybe he would change his mind.
Tony sighs sadly and wraps one arm around Steve, pulling him closer. “You didn’t know.”
“You don’t even remember it. Why...why would you trust me?”
The one night stand, letting Tony go without properly telling him...that was the mistake.
“If that was for lunch then how’s dinner sound tomorrow night?”
“Then you just change your schedule. You do that anyway.”
The alpha is everything Steve expected him to be. Nick is strong and intimidating. His dominance is palpable. Tony senses it too and he growls low in his throat, warning the other alpha that he didn’t want any trouble.
Trust was still something Steve found himself struggling with. He could count on one hand alone the individuals who he had trust in. Those people were gone now. But now he had a new person. Maybe even two.
“We were a little outnumbered,” Natasha says.
“Only if you join me.”
Steve snaps his hips forward, unable to hold back the groan that escapes him. He curls around Tony, leaning down and resting his forehead against Tony’s shoulder. “You feel good,” Steve murmurs and presses kisses along the back of Tony’s neck. “So good.”
Morgan scoffs. “They don’t show it. I just wanted to work on my stupid science project. It’s something I know dad would like and he’s too busy for me. I know they have a lot to deal with but so do I! I can’t even talk about my days like Peter gets to.”
Peter giggles and moves away to avoid getting his hair even more messed up than it already was. He hugs both of his uncles, then he rushes toward the stairs, only to stop and turn around.
“I love you, too. Now get inside before they think I kidnapped you or something.”
The security guard Peter had met is waiting for him near the front entrance. Peter hesitates and for a moment contemplates if he should stay or return home. Happy senses his hesitation, and with an irritated huff, he hurriedly waves Peter over.
His papa returns a few minutes later with jeans that obviously belong to his dad. Peter grimaces and accepts them despite how much he’d rather reject the item and crawl back into bed.
Tony rolls his eyes and escorts the kid outside. Just like the last time, Tony makes sure Peter gets across the street safely. He watches for a while until his son blends in with the rest of the crowd of New Yorkers.
Tony rolls his eyes and shuts his lab down for the second time that night. He double checks on Peter, finding the teen sprawled out on the large bed and sleeping peacefully. Tony closes the door and makes his way toward his own bedroom.
“You will,” Steve assures and curls up against the alpha.
“Why? Isn’t it a big deal?”
“Yeah,” Steve says with a smile. “I’m ready.”
They watch the video a few more times. Peter cries initially, but then he’s laughing and smiling. Tony shows him the other videos he has. He can tell it beats any movie Peter has ever seen.
Tony scoffs and scoots away. Great. Now they were going to fight.
This was not part of the plan.
“No. I’m fine.”
Tony wrinkles his nose at the use of his last name but doesn’t correct Steve. “Okay fine. I can’t really cook. I try though. Right, J?”
He experienced firsthand just what kind of abuse Steve had suffered through. It was difficult to watch the way Hydra tormented and beat Steve down. They made him crumble and break into a million little pieces.
He’s paranoid and overreacting, at least that’s what he tries to tell himself, but deep in his gut a warning brews. Call it mother’s intuition.
Muffled voices and footsteps are what force him to stop. He listens, ears picking up on the sounds produced just outside the locked door. His heart is pounding in his chest, filling his ears with a mixture of the heavy beating and the noises outside.
“I’m just saying. You and Steve are practically married. Or at least you act like a married couple.”
He locates the elevator and takes it to the top floor. He takes a moment to compose himself and think of a quick plan. He knows once Pierce is out of the picture the rest of his men would fall back. They counted on him.
For the first time in a while his stomach doesn’t grow queasy at the thought of food. He still can’t tolerate the smell of coffee, and he grimaces when he enters the kitchen and is smacked in the face with the strong aroma.
“He’ll be here. Lord knows that’s something I can’t help you with.” Steve rises to his feet and begins gathering his reports. “Go put your stuff away. Dinner will be ready soon.”
“Just because my tower is there doesn’t mean I have to be. I can work remotely or travel if need be. I do it all the time,” Tony says.
He’s pretty sure he’s covered from head to toe in dust and possible bruising, but he can’t bring himself to care. At least he was alive.
“You’re gonna be late,” Tony’s voice captures Steve’s attention. Tony sends Steve a smile over his shoulder before turning back to his original task.
Steve wears a fake smile for most of the party. The last time he had all of his friends together like this was during the party Tony had thrown to celebrate their successful mission. It seems like such a long time ago.
“Stop. Steve-”
“Yeah,” Steve nods and runs a hand through his sweat-damped hair. “Making the baby is the best part.”
Steve leaves the room in the rush, not wanting Tony to see how flustered he was getting. But Tony had already seen in and he can’t help but smile at the way Steve reacted. Seeing Steve flustered wasn’t something everyone got to witness, but he’s been one of the lucky ones to see it, and he found it adorable.
Harley releases Tony’s hand and rushes toward his sister, throwing his arms around her waist. “Maguna! You came home!”
He takes his time popping open the buttons of Steve’s shirt, exposing pale skin. Tony runs his hands down the front of Steve’s chest, admiring the sculpted chest. He pushes off the article of clothing and tosses it somewhere behind him.
“Papa?” Peter’s voice is quiet. Tears gather in his eyes and he has to squeeze them shut. He needs to be strong.
“This is crazy,” Ned says and he runs a hand through his hair.
“I really do know a guy. But if you want something simple then I can do that. Whatever you want, it’s yours.”
Tony gives a nonchalant shrug in response. “Don’t know yet. He might want a little vacation. Haven’t been to Bora Bora in a while.”
He blames himself for everything. He told himself he wouldn’t do that anymore. He told himself that there was plenty of blame to go around, but he didn’t feel like that now.
“He’s still a stinker,” Tony chuckles. “You always smell like milk, huh?”
“Nah. If anything I did it. I didn’t mean to lash out back there. I guess I’m just...confused. Angry.”
“Obviously, Pep. Look how I came home.” Tony shuts the mirror and hands it back to Pepper. He lets out a heavy sigh and leans back in his chair. His head is still pounding. He rubs at the spot that aches. “Did Pierce say anything else?”
The contraction eventually ends, giving Steve a minute to catch his breath. He finds himself dozing off, comfortable in his friend’s arms.
“No, it won’t.” Steve sits up and stretches, a small yawn escaping him. “Where is he anyway?”
“Steve,” Tony says his name softly and Steve peers up at him. “You’re beautiful.”
“Where you left him.”
“I think he watched this like a thousand times,” Peter laughs at the memories of watching the movie over and over until they both had the lines memorized.
Steve sniffs and chokes back another sob. “I want a baby, Tony.”
Steve glances down at his lap. “You weren’t supposed to.”
Natasha cocks her head in confusion. “Nothing happened. We just wanted to check on you and-” she pauses and holds up a bottle of Chardonnay. “-we brought wine.”
The way Alpha softly strokes his stinging cheek has Steve leaning into the touch. For a moment he believes the alpha will allow him to keep this pup.
“I’ll put it on the list,” Steve replies and takes out his pocket sized notebook to add it to his list. He can’t help but frown at the long list he’s created for himself. He had a lot of catching up to do and so little time to do it.
“Yeah.” Steve nods as he follows Tony up the stairs, doing his best not to complain about the lack of air he was receiving.
Peter opens the drawer to his dresser and rummages through it, taking as much as he can and making a pile on his old bed.
This is it you guys! I’m so sad it’s over but at the same time I’m happy to have accomplished this. It has been a struggle for these three and I’m glad they made it to the very end. This was a touchy subject to write about but I’m glad I did it. This definitely helped me with my own struggles. Just know if you’re ever having those bad days, you’re still loved and deserve all the happiness in the world. 😊 ❤️❤️❤️
“Don’t worry,” Tony assures and he comes over to join Steve on the bed. “Our date isn’t till 6.”
Tony gives him one last look then he turns to leave the room, only to stop in his tracks when he hears a soft whimper. He spins around, finding Steve tossing and turning, whimpering. He’s at his side in seconds.
This was Tony’s chance to tell him how he felt. But Tony stops himself. What they did could never happen again. They were just too different and it was painfully obvious that they worked better when they were drinking. Tony didn’t want that. He wanted Steve, but he didn’t want the clashing and fighting. They were going to butt heads no matter what and the last thing Tony wanted to do was put Steve through that. That wouldn’t be a healthy relationship for either one of them.
He can’t finish that thought. It was wrong.
“That’s a long time to be away from him,” Steve sighs and leans back in his seat, squeezing his eyes shut when more tears gather in his eyes. His hormones were out of whack and it was something that was going to take some getting used to. It wasn’t the only thing. He still needed to get used to the idea of being a father.
“What about Tony?” Bruce asks and glances around at his friends. “Did anyone see him today?”
Tony only looks away from his son when the door to the connected bathroom opens and Steve shuffles out, looking drained and beat down. It’s a look Steve doesn’t wear often. He comes closer until he’s able to climb onto the large bed and adjust himself beside Tony. He winces and shifts, a hiss of pain escaping him when his lower half meets the bed.
“Okay,” Peter nods.
“Good. Then at least he will be somewhere that’s not here.”
Steve smiles shyly. “So you like it?”
“I don’t think she’s hungry,” Tony says. “She just ate not even an hour ago.”
“You didn’t do anything.”
“Why? You were willing to throw me out because you weren’t sure the pup was yours. Right?”
“T-Tony,” Steve whimpers, a moan slipping past his lips when the alpha grazes his teeth along the mark. Steve’s body shudders and he moans. “Please, alpha.”
Hi! It's my birthday today and before it ends I wanted to post another chapter. I'm sorry I haven't been updating as much, but I'm trying to come up with a schedule. I hope this makes up for it!
“N-no,” Steve stutters out a reply. His face is hot and probably as red as the Iron Man suit.
“I’m here to help.”
There was only one person who might have more information.
“You destroyed my home.” Steve seethes.
Flash says nothing and gingerly sits down on the edge of Peter’s bed, scrubbing a hand over his face. Peter moves toward him, then second guessing getting too close and crossing the room to find a clean shirt. It was the least he could do.
“S-Steve,” Tony stammers. The touch against his bond mark has his cock stirring in interest. “I’m gonna...I need to-”
“It’s okay to hate your dad. I know a thing or two about that. I didn’t get along with my old man. He never told me he loved me. I don’t even think he liked me.”
He doesn’t realize it at first, but he’s moving closer to the alpha, the gap between them getting smaller and smaller. They’re both leaning in, just inches away from closing that gap completely. Steve’s breath hitches when Tony’s ghosts over his mouth, warm against his lips.
“I love you too. I guess so much that people are beginning to wonder why I haven’t popped the question yet.”
He finds it on the next thrust, forcing a scream from Tony’s throat and causing his back to arch off the bed. Witnessing Tony take pleasure because of his doing brings Steve closer and closer to the edge.
He gives up on his work. He wasn’t in the right mindset to continue anyway. He’d rather go back upstairs and drink until he blacks out. But he can’t.
“I get it. We can always talk it over. You know, when the big, mean super soldier isn’t looking for blood.”
Steve nods. “Thank you, Bruce.”
When Steve doesn’t respond, Tony asks again.
It only takes a few more hard thrusts until Steve is toppling over the edge, screaming Tony’s name as he comes. Tony fucks him through it, cursing when Steve clenches tightly around him. It’s not long until Tony reaches his own release and comes with Steve’s name rolling off his tongue.
“I just want things to go back to the way they were,” Peter sobs into his uncle’s chest. Sam holds him tightly, running his fingers through the messy brown hair. Just like Steve used to do.
Peter shrugs. “I’m used to it I guess. He’d let me go on runs with him. It was part of the training.”
“Kidding. I love you. I’m looking forward to the wedding of the year.”
Steve senses them before the door even opens. The sound of the metal door screeching against the floor sends the hairs on Steve’s body standing on end. The sound of heavy boots and the musky alpha scent make him coil up and whimper.
Steve finds the strength to break free from Tony’s grasp and he shoves him off. Tony stumbles backwards, quickly catching himself.
“Jarvis, I appreciate the concern, but I’m okay. This is nothing.”
Eventually he pulls away and wipes at his eyes, doing his best to clear up the tears. Steve smiles softly at his son, and reaches out to try and fix his messy hair.
Peter sniffs. “Like you and Uncle Bucky.”
The car comes to a stop at a red light. Happy peers at him through the mirror again.
“You’re talking about maternity clothes, aren’t you?”
She welcomes his hug and ruffles his curly hair. “You better clean up. Papa isn’t happy right now.”
“Good.” Tony smiles.
Bruce shrugs in response. “I’d suggest you talk to him. Something isn’t right.”
Steve nods and folds his arms over his chest. “What happened, bud?”
“Yeah, guess he is,” Steve agrees and he gives Dodger another pat on the head. “So you’re really okay with this?” He asks Tony.
“‘M fine. I just…” Steve lets out another groan.
Steve shuts down again and glances at his lap. “Yes,” he admits.
“Yeah,” Tony agrees. “And he’s ours. Crazy, right? We made that.”
“I’m not giving up. I’ve tried everything and it didn’t work. Something needs to be done, and you know it, too.”
Steve’s back arches and he comes with a small scream, his body tensing and eyes rolling to the back of his head. Tony continues to thrust his fingers and lapping up the sweet slick that spills from Steve’s fluttering hole.
But Peter knew how broken up his papa was. His father was good at wearing a mask and pretending that he was fine, but as Peter got older, he started to see the mask crack and break apart. Whenever he asked, his papa always assured him that he was fine, but deep down Peter knew his father was hurting.
“It’s okay.”
Someone is gripping his wrists, their hands tightening and trying to hold him down. Steve kicks and screams, begging to be let go. He can’t let it happen again.
He makes sure no attention is on him when he approaches the vehicle. Of course he can’t be too sure if anyone’s noticed or not. It’s not everyday a car like this shows up.
“It’s fine.” Tony shifts and slips free from the arm Steve has around him. He lies down on his side, his back facing Steve.
“Oh no. No. No. Tony,” Steve groans when he catches the gleeful glint in his husband's eyes. “I’m not wearing-”
The next time their friends stop by for a visit, the group only consists of Sam, Natasha, and Bucky. It’s Natasha and Bucky who coax Steve out of the bedroom and into the living room. He breaks down immediately, clutching onto Bucky and sobs.
They don’t say much as they follow the trail that would eventually lead them to the spot that made Tony’s heart hurt. Peter points out a few of the newer graves, having seen them too.
“No!” Peter cries suddenly and rushes over, laying a hand over the weapon. “Uncle Bucky, wait! Don’t!”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “We are. But it’s a girl.”
“And Happy. You’re in good hands, Steve. SHIELD has been looking for you for a very long time.”
“Oh but don’t I? You can’t properly handle our crying baby at 3 in the fucking morning!”
“Steve let him hang out with Ned all the time,” Sam says, ignoring the glare being sent his way. He holds his hand up in defense. “You know it’s true.”
“Nope.”
Tony scoffs. “How can you be so forgiving? I fucked up. I mean I fucked up bad.”
They were better off staying apart. At least Tony had been willing to give him space and think everything through. Peter wishes he had taken the time to do that before letting himself get so attached.
Steve can’t help but frown at those words. “And you? You want this too, right?”
Steve’s heart is thumping so hard against his chest he expects it to burst right through. Peter is luckily fast asleep, the swaying of the car seat lulling him back to sleep. Different scenarios play through Steve’s mind, each one worse than the other. He doesn’t want to jump ahead of himself and fear the worst, but he can’t help but worry. FRIDAY’s alert was worrisome.
Steve nods and chokes back another sob. “I know. I hope they didn’t suffer. They didn’t deserve that, Tony. They should’ve lived. I should’ve been a better mother to them.”
“Hey, hey. He’s not. He’s...he’s from a bad situation okay? That’s it. The alpha he was with-”
Tony has expected to find his mate lingering outside near the front door but instead Steve was at the cliff that overlooked the ocean. He’s standing near the edge, not too far that Tony feared he’d have to run after him to catch him if he were to lose his footing, but close enough that Tony’s alpha side didn’t approve of his mate being alone and in harm's way.
“He is,” Tony interjects. “He is blaming me. Hell, I’m blaming me. I should’ve done more. I should’ve stayed with him.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Why?”
“Sometimes I wish he didn’t. I can’t…”
His stomach churns and the urge to vomit makes itself known. He fights it and takes a deep breath to calm himself.
Tony was so used to being alone when he worked that he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to share the space with him. He stayed up too late and consumed more coffee than a human should, and not to mention the change of persona when lack of sleep and too much caffeine mixed together. Pepper couldn’t stand him when he worked and made sure to stay far away when he got in his headspace. But Steve was different. Steve liked staying with him.
The last thing Steve wanted was to be in the delivery room and still trying to come up with a name. Baby Rogers wasn't going to cut it.
The team was well aware of the fact that their leaders were trying to start a family. They had offered their support from the beginning, especially when news broke out that Steve was unable to conceive. He can recall long nights talking with Natasha about the issue; it was something they unfortunately could relate to. Maybe they had shared more life experience than he used to think.
Steve continues to go with that lie, and each time he says those words, Tony appears more and more unconvinced. He doesn’t question Steve though, even when it seems like he wants to.
Tony finishes up the rest of the kitchen, then he joins his family in the living room. Peter already has the movie started and curled up beside Steve on the couch. Tony takes the spot beside his husband, a soft sigh of content leaving his lips now that he gets a chance to be so close to him.
He’s reminded that he’s not completely alone. Bucky was just outside the door. He had to step out when a message from their friends came through, but he’d return and be by Steve’s side, just like he had promised.
“I got it,” Steve assures. He lets out another huff in annoyance when he does in fact
Sometimes he regrets accepting the serum and the experiment he went through. He never would have ended up in Hydra’s hands if he had just accepted who he was. But what good was it to dwell on the past and the what ifs? The past was the past. And this was now.
Steve smiles through his tears. “I love you so much.”
“This is the one.” Tony beams happily, tapping against the glass display case that holds the ring he’s been eying for weeks. The clerk behind the desk smiles brightly and reaches for the keys to unlock the case. “Look.” Tony shakes Happy’s arm and points excitedly at the ring. “It’s perfect, right?”
“Hey, pal,” Bucky greets first, moving closer to stand near Steve’s side. “How ya feelin’?”
“What? Why do you think it’s always me?”
Sam smiles softly. “Night, Pete.”
Tony can’t help but reach out for the photo, only to pull back when he hears Peter return. He turns around to find his son laying out medical supplies on the coffee table.
Peter giggles. “Do I look like you, Daddy?”
“You wanna run that by me again, Cap?” Nick questions, his good eye narrowing. The man hated being interrupted, but Steve figured he’d get a pass.
“You can’t. You can never hurt me.”
“They all are,” Steve says, “I guess milk and cookies really do the trick.”
“It’s okay. Pete and I will be joining you soon.”
He forgets about the throbbing in his head the second he takes in his surroundings. He’s no longer at the party, nor in the private room he had been escorted to. His mind is fuzzy, struggling to piece together the puzzle. This didn’t make sense. He shouldn’t be here.
“He’s here,” Steve whispers. Tears are starting to roll down his face. “I-I smell him. I smell him.”
“You look awful.”
“I don’t know. Maybe we should switch more often.”
“Dodge, won’t do that. Will you, boy?” Steve gives Dodger another scratch behind his ear, giggling when he’s rewarded with another lick to the face.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers and forces himself to look into Steve’s pain filled eyes. “I’m so sorry.”
Peter sighs and his shoulders sag. “I just wanted to look like daddy.”
But he struggled to believe those words.
Steve nods his head. “T-tea, please.”
Planning a wedding was a lot harder than Steve had expected. Back in his day a wedding didn’t require much, but the times have changed. And so have the wedding planning.
“And the baby? Is he-”
He cradles Morgan in his arms and carefully lowers himself in the rocking chair. He doesn’t struggle anymore when it comes to feeding her and he’s able to get her calm and latching on in a matter of minutes.
“Get away!” Steve snarls.
“Huh.” Tony leans back in his seat, still frowning. “I didn’t know he...said anything.”
“Guess we gave birth to the mini versions of ourselves.”
He’s lucky to have a mate like him. He doesn’t know what he’d do without Tony.
The drive home is silent. Steve keeps his eyes toward the window, tears rolling down his face as he cries silently. He still has one hand over his belly, wishing his child was still growing there. He lets out a small sob, the sound capturing Tony’s attention.
“I guess I do. Tony has an appointment today and I wanted to squeeze in a run before then.”
“Honey.” Tony’s voice is soft and he comes over, placing his hand over Steve’s shaking one. “Steve, look at me.”
Peter can’t stop staring at the image Doctor Banner had printed out for him. He has an envelope full of them tucked away in his desk drawer, but he’s made sure to keep one with him. He studies it closely, finding it hard to believe that he had life growing inside of him. The pregnancy test had confirmed it, but seeing the baby for the first time made everything more real.
The kicks from within his womb has Steve pausing his preparation and he places a hand over his belly, smiling at the thought of his son. Peter had been calm most of the day but decided now was a good time to wake up and wreak havoc on Steve’s ribs.
“And he can’t? They’re his-”
“Hold him. Hold your son.”
Up close he can properly scent her. He gets a whiff of vanilla and lavender. She was an omega, but her scent was off. It wasn’t very sweet.
“Thanks. Glad to know whose side you’re on.”
“That wouldn’t be bad.” Tony nods in agreement.
“I want to be. I want to see this new world and find my place in it.”
He knows where he needs to be, and without being noticed, he swings through the city until he reaches his father’s gravesite. It’s not a basic stone with his name and dates of birth and death; he was a symbol to many and greatly recognized. The bronze statue stands tall, a perfect replica of his father and the mighty shield that aided him in many battles. The base of the statue has his name, the two important dates, and an engraved message describing the type of person he was in life.
“Why?” Tony demands.
But it was worth it.
“You can cum.”
“Will you really visit? You promise I’ll see you?”
“Good job, Omega,” Pierce praises and gently strokes Steve’s head. “You did so good for me.”
Tony snorts. “Wilson is the bad guy, huh?”
“And then I’ll help you. It won’t take long with your brother. I promise.”
“Yes! Alpha, breed me!”
“And I will. In time. You’ve said enough and it’s been hard on you. Just take things slow okay? I just want you and that baby comfortable. That’s all that matters.”
“Okay.” Peter nods. “Are you afraid of people seeing us? I swear I’m not some weird stalker or anything.”
“Of course.”
The child in his arms is a surprise, but Steve’s heart explodes with happiness and love for his son. He wishes the circumstances had been better; if the other father would have stuck around to share the moment when their son entered the world. But Tony made the choice to walk out on them, and now it was up to Steve to care for the little boy.
“Tony,” Steve says before his husband leaves. “We already looked all over. He just doesn’t know. We still have time so don’t worry about it.”
Tony runs a hand through his disheveled hair, blowing out a breath of air and turning his head in Steve’s direction. Steve is staring up at the ceiling. It’s difficult to read him, and for a moment Tony wonders if Steve had been thinking the same thing.
“You have a pup?” Sam asks.
Tony mumbles something under his breath, clearly not agreeing with his husband. Steve takes Tony’s hand again to calm him.
“Not quite. Follow me,” Tony gestures with his head for Peter to follow and he leads him to another part of the lab until they’re standing in front of a glass display case. “What do you think?”
“Okay, okay,” he wheezes out, when his aunt’s legs wrap around his neck. “You...win.”
Tony glances over at his other two children, watching as they play on the blanket he had set down on the grass for them. Sarah has most of her stuffed animals with her, each one given their own teacup. Peter pretends to drink from his cup and then holds it out for his sister to pour him more of the invisible tea.
He doesn’t hear if FRIDAY passes on the message, all of his attention is on the lifeless form of his husband. Tony holds Steve tightly, begging him not to go, not to leave him or their daughter.
“Thank you, Nick. That means a lot.”
Tony groans from the tight heat surrounding him. He takes a moment for Steve to adjust, but it’s becoming difficult to hold back and fuck Steve hard. He waits as patiently as he can until the omega grants him permission to move.
He wishes they could switch places.
With a grunt Steve pulls himself off the sofa, one hand resting over his protruding belly. His son moves, his tiny foot gently pressing against Steve’s hand.
“Bullshit.” Tony says then he sighs. “I didn’t mean to yell. It’s just...talking about him…”
Steve can’t help but grin. “You say that now but…”
“Feel.” Is all Steve says and he takes Tony’s hand, leading it to the spot where their pup was growing. “Do you feel that?”
Tony glances around at Natasha and Bruce, then back to his son. “I won’t.”
I'll update soon! Thank you for reading!
Steve frowns. “Yeah? It’s exciting, right?”
Steve takes a breath to calm himself.
“This one is Peter,” Steve replies, gesturing to the sleeping baby in Tony’s arms. “And I’m holding Harley.”
Sam and Bucky glance up at him and Peter prays they don’t start yelling. He was only a few minutes late after all.
Steve nods and he’s gently handed their son. Peter doesn’t fuss this time, instead curling up against Steve’s chest, splaying one tiny hand against him. Peter’s eyes grow heavy, fluttering for a moment until they’re shutting and he’s drifting off to sleep.
“Oh right. Yeah. What if we take turns tonight? At least that way if it doesn’t work for me then we know it probably will work for you.”
Peter follows and takes the seat next to him. “You don’t like talking about your dad, do you?”
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I-I...fuck this isn’t me. I’m sorry.”
“I know.” Tony places his own hand over Steve’s. “But you know what I’d love?”
Steve chuckles again and pecks Tony on the cheek. “Come on, Nat says it’s time for gifts.”
“I’m sorry,” Bucky mutters after he’s calmed down. He glances at where his hands are placed on the edge of the sink, cursing when he finds the dent he’s created by accident.
The pups are warming up nicely to their new home. There have been a few hiccups here and there. Especially when James feels threatened or insecure. He growls or snaps when someone he doesn’t fully trust gets too close to his siblings. It’s only happened a few times around Happy, but after he’s warmed up to the beta, he trusts him enough to enter the penthouse.
“Is that what that was! Who did that? More bad guys?”
“What did we do? Why else would you have run away?”
“I mean cool as in rich and famous. He’s definitely not cool for...doing what he did.”
“I love you, Steve. I loved you before this and I love you now. I’ll always love you. I can’t truly understand how you’re feeling, but just know I’m here no matter what. I don’t want to lose you. You and Morgan are the only things that matter to me.”
A few days later, Tony and Steve are free to go home. Natasha and Bucky stop by to help them gather their belongings or hold a baby when their arms are too full. Bucky takes Harley like he said he would while Natasha coos and smiles down at Peter.
“I’m sorry,” Peter whispers. He hopes if his papa was listening that he got this message.
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’ll come back this time. I miss our little talks.”
Tony senses his struggle and steps in. “Since he was early he’s having some difficulty with breathing on his own, and his weight is on the low side. The doctor’s aren’t too concerned, but he’ll have to hang out here a little longer.”
“I know.”
But he’s been feeling off lately and the little voice in the back of his head reminds him to go out and get a test. Maybe he was being too hopeful, but he can’t help it. He’s been through enough suffering, and all he wanted was something right to happen.
Maybe this was the worst idea he’s ever had.
“I hope you’re being sarcastic. Although I can’t exactly see me being a dad. I’m always here-”
“Yeah.” Steve’s sure he sounds every bit as confused as he looks. He had already answered this question. “Tony-”
He can’t tell them. They would be disappointed and upset and would probably never look at him the same way. He didn’t need them as much as Ned said he did. He could take care of this on his own.
“I hope not. I mean you let two little kids overrun you.”
He realizes it’s nearly their bedtime and figures Tony had them tucked in and probably on their third story. He wonders if his mate is struggling to get their youngest to bed; Peter refused to have anyone other than Steve tuck him in.
A soft bark fills the room and Dodger comes over, wagging his tail happily like he always does. “He’s not the only one,” Tony laughs and reaches out to pat Dodger’s head. “You ready for the baby, Dodge? He’s gonna be stinky and whiney, kinda like you.”
“Paranoid?”
“Does he hate you now?” Tony asks.
“Are you traveling back after the party?” Steve asks, even though he already knows the answer. Bruce never did stay more than he needed to. He would talk to Tony for a little while before he departed but that was it. Traveling back and forth must be exhausting. It made Steve wish he had just stayed back in New York. Maybe it would be easier for everyone then.
The void Tony left could never be filled. Steve didn’t understand how they were supposed to function properly without Tony on their side. He had promised he’d be there if they ever needed him, but Steve couldn’t believe that now. They were on their own.
The guards are ordered to leave and the door shuts behind them. Steve doesn’t move when the alpha comes close to get a better look at him. Steve feels like he’s on display, every inch of him is being looked over.
Natasha doesn’t respond, too busy attending to Morgan. She speaks softly to her, cooing and smiling until Morgan grows quiet. Tony can’t help but wish his husband acted this way toward their daughter.
“He’s not…” Tony trails off, nodding toward the dog. “Because that would be awkward.”
It’s after school when Peter tracks Flash down. It was safer for them to talk when no one else was around. There would be a few lingering students and staff, but not enough that would make them both uneasy to be in each other’s presence.
Steve inhales sharply. He lets the comment roll off him.
“Tones, do you need any-” Steve’s cut off when Tony lurches forward again and another round starts. Steve’s torn between rushing to his husband’s side and fleeing the bathroom before his breakfast decides to make a second appearance. He chooses the latter, mumbling something about getting Tony a glass of water.
“Don’t be. He’s perfect.”
“Yep.” Tony takes another drink. He’s starting to feel the effects of the alcohol. Any tension he felt was starting to diminish. He’s never felt more relaxed.
Tony takes the spot on the other side of his son. He shares a look with Steve, getting a nod of approval. Tony lets out a heavy sigh and reaches for his son’s hand.
“Fuck...okay okay. Shit! You can’t push now!”
Tony drops down to one knee so that he’s at eye level with the bump. He places both hands over Steve’s belly, feeling his son squirming within.
Steve is wheeled up to the side of the bed and he takes Tony’s hand, squeezing it as if to say ‘you got this.’ And that’s all Tony needs.
Sam rolls his eyes and says, “Outside in some alley.”
“So do you want it?”
“Steve-”
“Me? Oh yeah. Steve has made sure of that. Did I tell you we’re mates now? It sort of happened...a few weeks ago. Okay, maybe I suck at communicating.”
Tony nods and glances down at his plate, twirling the fork in the pasta but not bothering to eat any of it. He wants to ask Steve about those bad days, but the subject was still a touchy one and the last thing he wanted to do was ruin a good meal between them.
Sarah was quiet and reserved. Tony isn’t worried about her. She likes her space and he respects that. Peter of course is still too young to do anything. Though Tony does blame his youngest on his lack of sleep.
“Tony, you didn’t have a choice-”
Tony steps back, no longer able to stand the sight. A sob builds in his throat and he doesn’t hold back this time. He cries long and hard, wishing that he could’ve done something to prevent this. He wonders what he did to deserve this kind of pain.
“I’m Captain America!” Peter says proudly.
His son eventually latches on and nurses greedily, the sound of his suckling filling the room. Steve keeps his gaze on him, studying his tiny features. It was too early to decide who he resembled the most, but his money was on Tony. The dark hair was something he already inherited from his father, and Steve already knew he’d probably have the same matching eyes.
“Okay. Here let me help you with um…” Tony’s face flushes at the realization of helping Steve out of his sweatpants.
“Sometimes I don’t think so. I lost him and now I’m probably going to lose you and I don’t want that to happen because my whole life I’ve thought about you and-”
Tony chuckles and glances down at Morgan. She’s fallen back to sleep.
“What if I can’t?”
“Uh-oh. I knew something was up.”
“I regret a lot of things, kid. I’m full of them.”
Tony drags Bruce away from the door and down the empty hallway until he’s positive they’re out of earshot.
“We both can,” Tony turns back to his husband. “You need to sleep, too.”
“You’re not. Tony, you’re hurt.”
“Yeah. I mean, I know I wanted them once but I never thought we’d actually get to have a family. Not with our jobs and the fact that I was told this could never happen for me. And then we broke up…”
Steve nods and more tears run down his face. “What do we do?”
Peter can’t help but scoff.
“Would it matter?”
“Wait. I need to see Uncle Sam and Bucky first if that’s okay?”
Steve hugs his pup close and kisses his head again.
“They’re asleep,” Steve says when he returns. He grabs his pajamas from the ottoman and begins changing, his back purposely toward his mate.
Steve is taken aback by the politeness. He can’t remember a time when he was spoken to like this...like...like a human being. His mother made sure to raise him to be kind and speak politely to others. For the most part he did. It wasn’t until he was locked away did he forget the manners his mother taught him. In his mind Hydra didn’t deserve them. Maybe he would have received less bruises if he had listened.
Steve whines, the sound pitiful. It must be amusing to the alpha’s ears because he chuckles again and presses the tip of his finger against the sensitive ring of muscle.
“I got her.” Steve takes Morgan into his arms and turns to leave.
“I’m finally doing it. I need to be there for him.”
“Just for a couple of hours?”
Tony reaches over the older pup to take Steve’s hand. The omega flinches slightly and tears his eyes away from the window to lock them with Tony’s. Steve smiles softly, but Tony can see right through it. Something was wrong.
Natasha smiles softly and rubs her hand along his shoulder. “Yeah. Are you okay now?” She asks and Steve nods his head. “I’ve never and I mean
“What?” Steve narrows his eyes.
“Who? Me?”
“I’m afraid that’s out of the question. I can’t have my prized omega distracted with a little one. You have other duties.”
“Stark is back,” Bucky says, his eyes never leaving Peter.
Bucky’s smile widens when Peter slips one tiny arm free to grasp one of the metal fingers on Bucky’s hand. Peter must find some kind of comfort in the cool metal because he yawns again and his eyes fall shut.
Tony smirks and turns to Happy. Leaning in for only Happy to hear he says, “I think he’s going to clash with me. I kind of like it. Is that weird?”
Steve huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “Me too,” he says and glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. An amused look appears over Tony’s face and it’s then when Steve realizes what he’s said. “I mean not me wondering about the question...the guys...they’ve been harassing me…”
It’s well into the afternoon by the time Peter returns to the compound. He doesn’t find his aunt in her apartment or down in the common room. He considers going to hang out with his uncles, but they’d probably want some space. He doesn’t know their full story and has been too afraid to ask.
Steve and Tony share a look, a mixture of confusion and panic etched over their faces.
“Down in the lab.”
The real reason was Steve. He was exhausted and his back was beginning to ache. He wonders if he overdid it with the nursery. Maybe he should have taken more breaks.
“Remember the first time we came here?”
“Probably. I promise I’ll be nice.”
“What the hell?” Flash growls and yanks Peter off of him. “What’s your deal, Stark?”
“Petey, wake up,” Natasha coos, ignoring the dirty look Steve gives her. “Leave me alone, Rogers. I just want to feel him.”
With his visibility compromised, he slams into a hard mass, only to discover too late that it was one of the traders. He loses the grip on his shield and it hits the ground. Before Steve can recover it, a fist is colliding with his jaw and sending him back into one of the walls.
“I have to, idiot. You can barely stand.”
Steve doesn’t bother sticking around and he gathers up the blanket they were wrapped in, and goes inside to get ready for bed. He stops by James’ room, poking his head in and watching as Tony comforts the scared pup.
“Don’t!” This time Bucky rises to his feet and takes a few steps away from the sofas. “Don’t try and make it better because you can’t. He’s gone. He might be your leader but he was my best friend, and I was ready to follow him before any of you.”
Steve smiles. “You’re welcome.”
Peter doesn’t rush to get ready to be downstairs for breakfast. He’s exhausted and sluggish, desperately wanting to do nothing but sleep all day. He’s been tired before, back when he was staying up late to finish assignments or playing video games with Ned, but never has he felt this drained.
Tony sighs and forces himself to glance in Steve’s direction. Steve was starting to resemble himself again. He didn't appear very drunk anymore, a little buzzed maybe, but not shitfaced. The serum probably took care of that.
“When he could,” Peter says and starts to rummage through his backpack. He pulls out an old journal and opens it, then carefully slips out a piece of folded up paper. “This was the last thing he drew.”
“He’s okay, buddy,” Tony assures the dog, earning a bark in response. Dodger is growing impatient and he tugs on Tony’s sleeve again. “Okay, okay. We’re going.”
Steve is already in bed and on the verge of falling asleep. Tony joins him, spooning up right behind him and wrapping an arm around him, his hand splayed over the large bump. The activity from their son has died down; Harly was asleep.
Peter nods and holds onto his dad a little tighter, afraid that if he were to loosen his grip even just the slightest that his dad would leave him again.
Tony had woken up grumpy and Steve had hoped picking out names would boost his husband’s attitude. Clearly he had been wrong. Tony wasn’t having any of it.
Tony huffs out a small laugh. “I never will, sweetheart. I had to...protect you. I...I...promised.”
“It will only take a second. Is there somewhere private we can speak?”
Tony can’t help but smile. Steve had changed significantly over the past few months. He wasn’t as closed off as he used to be. The omega Tony remembers allowing into his car that one cold morning was gone, a new and brighter Steve emerging and taking its place. It was clear Steve was adjusting well and finding peace in his life, but Tony knew time was the real healer. He didn’t know how long it was going to take for Steve to completely heal, but he’d be there every step of the way, holding Steve’s hand through it all.
“I’m here,” Tony soothes and holds Steve close.
“Sorry. Hard pass. I like tall, muscular blonds. So do we get your real name or…”
“Well, it’s been crazy here, Tony. Not only am I working overtime, but you haven’t even called me to check in. The last time we spoke you were running away and hopping on the jet to California.”
“Still have time? Honey, Halloween is almost here and I haven’t even figured out my costume. I’m slacking!” Tony exclaims.
The room eventually clears except for the alpha. Steve pokes his head in and sniffs the room, trying to scent the alpha he would be spending the next few weeks with.
“And...maybe some carrot cake.”
“It’s fine,” Tony quickly says when he notices the omega’s nervous energy. “I don’t want to push you into anything, remember? We can order everything and have it delivered.”
“Hey. You won’t. I know you won’t.”
“Don’t disobey. I know you want this. I can smell your arousal.”
Tony welcomes the kiss with ease. He follows Steve’s lead, chasing after his lips even after Steve’s pulled away.
Tony smiles. “You’ll see.”
“Ah. I hope you didn’t Google too much.”
He keeps close to his mate, leaning in enough to nose around the crook of Tony’s neck and inhaling his comforting scent. It helps. Just like it always has.
Tony shakes his head and moves closer until he can take Steve’s hands in his own. “Sweetheart, you are not disgusting. You are one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.”
“It is when you’re having a pup with him. Which by the way, why would you keep something huge like that from me?”
“I’m not a soldier, Papa. I’m an Avenger.”
Tony grins and pulls the hood of the onesie over Steve’s head. “Yep.”
“I guess I did drink too much, huh?”
“I’m just down the hall if you need anything,” Tony says, snapping Peter from his thoughts. “Or call J. He’s around.”
“Okay, okay,” Steve soothes. “I’ll get them. I’ll get you whatever you need.”
“Is there someone I can call? I don’t feel comfortable letting you back on the street.”
But the idea never leaves him alone.
“Alpha thought so. I remember how tiny the pup was. He never cried. I didn’t even get a chance to name him.”
“Don’t scare this one away,” Tony points a threatening finger at Happy and waves Peter in with his other hand.
“I don’t think we’ve properly met. My name’s-”
“You better come back.” Natasha gets up to take her empty glass to the kitchen. “Or else you’ll probably get really familiar with Bucky’s arm.”
“Right, you did say that. But I’m not just going to drop you off anywhere. There’s really no one?”
“Hey, kiddo!” Tony greets and takes his son into his lap. “I made a new thing,” he says and shows Peter his progress. “Puppies are cute, right? Papa likes puppies.”
Peter smiles and nudges Flash’s shoulder playfully. “I know.”
The familiar urge to push finally makes itself known and he gives in to his body’s demands, bearing down along with the contraction. He keeps his hand in place, fingers exploring the hard mass of his baby’s head as it slowly inches forward. It’s a struggle to hold the push for the duration he needs to, and he finds himself giving in to the exhaustion and easing off.
“Speaking of money,” Steve begins and he gets up from where he’s been sitting for the past hour, stretching his arms over his head and groaning softly when his back pops. “I don’t want a big, extravagant wedding.”
“Good.” Tony smiles. He gestures toward Steve’s outfit. “You going somewhere?”
“Stark-Rogers?”
“I’m really sorry. Trust me I’d rather watch her than do this but the team’s really short without you two.”
“Oh.” Peter’s face falls. “You’ll come back, right? I wanted to show you around.”
“Now come back to your party.”
“Uh let me ask him. Honey-”
Steve lifts his head to peer in her direction and he gives a nod in response. “Fine. Just tired.”
“You know…” he treads carefully. “Maybe we can…”
“I know. I wish I could erase the pain...I mean I could try but…”
Tony nods and takes a sip from his own mug. “We can do both. I know you miss him.”
“Just go. And make sure you get back in one piece.”
She pulls off the bottle, her face scrunching up and small cries escaping her pouty lips. Tony shushes her gently and places the bottle back to her lips, sighing when she refuses to latch on. He wonders how Steve had done this.
“Hmm?” Tony glances over at his son, finding him on the verge of passing out.
He no longer blames Steve’s stubbornness or lack of sleep for his new behavior. Something was wrong, and he was going to fix it.
A banner of their son’s name was displayed and beneath that a table was set up with an array of foods. A large three tier cake is in the center of the table with each layer decorated with Steve’s shield, Tony’s arc reactor, and the Avengers logo.
Steve watches the scene with a sad smile. Sam would’ve been an amazing father.
“I love you,” Steve whispers once they part. “Happy Valentine’s Day.”
“And the spider!” Peter points at the black spider on the chest of the suit. “That’s how he drew it!”
Steve rushes over and takes Morgan into his arms, holding her close to his chest and calming her down. “Shh. I’m here, sweetheart. I’ll never leave you again.”
It was Tony who got to experience all of those things. Steve had been by his side through it all. It wasn’t the same as going through it himself, but it was still an experience he’d never forget.
“I don’t want to do this,” Bucky admits. The tears in his eyes have escaped and a few roll down his face. He takes a shaky breath to calm himself, but he’s struggling. “I can’t.”
He loved Morgan more than anything. She was the missing piece he was looking for. He’ll never regret having her.
“Leave him,” Pierce orders and the two alphas back off. “Let him heal. He needs it for later.”
“Good. Now you can tell him next,” Natasha says with a wink, then she turns around and leaves.
The voice taunts him every day, not once giving him a break from its abuse. Even the sounds he produces in the lab can’t drown out the voice. He deserved to be tormented. He deserved to feel Steve’s pain. He deserved to feel worse.
Morgan calms down the moment Tony has her out of her wet diaper and in a fresh one. He coos and smiles as he dresses her, chuckling softly when she smiles back at him. It’s a small smile, and he’s unsure if it’s a real one or just reflexes, but it brings joy to him anyway.
It makes him want to fuck this omega forever. Bite him. Claim him as his own.
“I know you would. I’m honestly surprised you didn’t flee in the middle of the night.”
“Goodnight, sir.”
“I did.” Steve nods with a smile. He leans closer to peck Tony on the cheek. “Believe me I’m glad you two are closer.”
Peter rolls again, and this time Steve lifts his shirt just in time to catch the tiny foot pressing against the taut skin of his belly. Steve places his hand over the spot where Peter is currently lying.
“Where are you going?” Sam asks.
“You’ll be right here?”
Rhodey sighs and steps further into the room. “You’re not fine. You haven’t been.”
“Fine. What are you working on?” Peter eyes the red boot on the bench and then his eyes are traveling up to the computer monitors. That’s when he notices the familiar design on the screens. “My suit!”
The alphas certainly seemed happy with the status quo -- even the little ones walked around with an unearned air of superiority and self-importance. As we grew older the alphas became louder and more headstrong. The few omegas living on our estate became withdrawn and timid. Some of them even started to wear the old fashioned veils my grandmother used to wear. Apparently they were coming back into fashion, my mom told me one evening when she passed me a prettily wrapped package.
He must have zoned out because the next thing he knew Nebula had stopped walking. He looked up and realised the ship was laid out in front of them, cut almost completely in half. “That’s not good,” he said hollowly, resting his chin on Nebula’s shoulder as he surveyed the wreckage.
“Didn’t take you long to hot-wire the car last time,” he grumbled, starting the engine.
was a soothing manner.
“Is it easier for you, if they’re broken?” I eventually asked, my eyes locked on his. I was a little surprised by the venom in my own voice. I’d not come across another omega in a very long time, but I could easily guess what sort of shit they’d experience if they were alone and didn’t have a way to defend themselves. Hell, most of them would have been born to a life of pain and humiliation, all because they were the weaker, rarer gender. They never stood a chance.
He winced, trying to pull away from the Maw’s suddenly bruising hold. “Watching after you is indeed one of life’s greatest pleasures,” he purred.
“I am calm,” I said, gesturing to myself. “Look at me. I’m quiet, still. I’m not crying or screaming. What more do you want from me?”
“The Asgaurdian king?” The mad Titan mused, his grip tightening as he pulled Tony impossibly closer. “I know him well. He nearly succeeded where you failed in fact.”
“Damn it Terran,” she snarled, reaching down and dragging him to his feet when he fell. “Must I carry you?”
“Some were, I imagine. Others were simply casualties of a much larger cause. Tell me, friend, did you lose someone close to you?”
They were such fragile creatures. So delicate and woefully unprepared for the dangers of the wider universe.
All in all it had taken roughly fifteen minutes for my life to thoroughly and completely combust.
“Omegas don’t play with alphas, my sweet,” my mother told me, when I kept pestering her.
“You won’t punch me again?”
“Bucky,” Steve said, settling his hand on the back of my nape and squeezing. “Do you smell it?”
The car went deathly quiet.
“Are you calm, terran?”
I was five when I learned that the reason they didn’t want me around was because I was omegan. At the time, as far as I could tell, the only difference between us was our scents. Why would something so small matter to anyone?
“Don’t what?” I asked, genuinely confused.
I didn’t bother to correct her assumption. “I want to get up.”
,” Tony snarled, trying to dislodge her grip. “I need a goddamn minute, OK?”
, I thought a little hysterically. I realised there were tears in my eyes and my breathing was too quick. Now was not the time to have a panic attack. I pushed through the emotions threatening to smother me and concentrated on moving my limbs. I was intact but sore. I figured once the adrenaline wore off I’d be in a much worse state.
I expected Bucky and Steve to give chase but they just stood shoulder to shoulder, watching the retreating pack. They had their backs to me so I couldn’t see the look on their faces but after the remaining bikers fled and those on the floor stopped moving, both men turned to look at me.
I felt the hard lines of a much larger body shift behind me and instantly froze.
He pulled off, following behind Steve. I noticed he did that lot.
***********
I pressed my face against my shoulder and showed him the side of my neck. It was an instinctive submissive response that I had absolutely no way of controlling. I didn’t want to die. I didn’t want to be ripped apart by an enraged alpha. Maybe if he thought I was some helpless little omega he wouldn’t gut me. “I’m sorry,” I gasped, cringing away when his fingers slid over my nape and squeezed softly.
The woman’s eyes flickered back to me, clearly cataloguing the way he was pinning me to the seat. She frowned and I gave her a little salute.
“You promise?” I snapped, aware I was shaking a little and yup, I was definitely panicking.
. “Can’t you smell it?” the blonde asked, leaning into my personal space and, jesus fuck,
“I won’t if you don’t want me to.” Steve said softly.
He got the message.
I didn’t move from my position against the window, but I did allow my body to relax a little. After a while, when nothing bad happened, exhaustion began to take hold. I could feel my eyelids drooping and eventually, I stopped trying to fight the need to sleep and managed to drift off.
I shrugged. “There doesn’t seem to be much point in lying about it anymore. So, you guys kidnapping everyone you come across, or is it -”
“I hate it,” Steve rasped, reaching out to touch me but seemingly thinking better of it when I glared at him. “Some of them can’t be helped. No matter what we try to do for them, they’re broken beyond repair. Some of them can be brought back to some semblance of normality, but they’re almost always terrified of alphas.”
I punched him in the face. I’m pretty sure the blow hurt my hand more than it hurt his jaw. He just shook his head and then I was being dragged towards Steve. I tried to dig my heels in but the man was so much stronger than me. I couldn’t even slow him down.
“Avery, get the omega checked out,” the woman said. “We’ll handle his boyfriends.”
“Omegas got skills,” Buck laughed, pulling the door closed and settling back with a small smile.
“Well aren’t you just too intriguing,” I said, “And that depends,
”Take the bed,” Steve ordered, sitting down with his back against the door. “I’ll keep watch.”
“Yeah, he’ll be back soon.”
I wanted to move. I wanted to get up and put some much needed space between me and them, but I just knew the moment I looked up I would see the small space I was trapped in and I would have a full out panic attack. I felt frozen, despite the fact my body was shaking hard enough to make my teeth rattle.
The car went silent - they were ignoring me and the lack of information was making my ears hot. Without really meaning I released a small, warning growl.
I could smell his anger. Anger -- and,
“You got a mechanic?”
“So, what happens now?” I asked. If they were going to beat the shit out of me I wanted to get it over with. I was tired, cranky and feeling hella stressed.
It took a pathetically short time to hotwire the car. The instant the engine came to life I hit the accelerator and in seconds I left Steve and Bucky in the dust. I could see both men staring after me and couldn’t resist winding down the window and flipping them the bird. The fuckers deserved to be stranded. Kidnapping people was just plain rude.
“Get your goddamn hands off me,” I snarled, kicking out when he opened the cardoor and pushed me inside.
His smile flickered. Yup, he thought I was hilarious. “Even so -- warm food?”
“Kinky,” I said, attempting to pull my arm free. Unsurprisingly it didn’t work. The guy was insanely strong, even for an alpha. “OK, Jesus. You don’t need to tie me up.”
I bolted but I didn’t even make it out of the van before Bucky’s metal arm wrapped around my waist and pulled me clear off my feet. I was hoisted up against the other man's broad chest and carried one armed out of the van and pushed into the front seat. He climbed in after me and suddenly I was wedged between the two of them.
She stared at him, stone faced and unsympathetic.
if you’re going to push me down and not let me get back up again you’re going to have to resign yourself to being punched in the goddamn face!”
I filled the car with some innate chatter, enjoying the way Steve’s shoulders stiffened every time I managed to strike a nerve.
Tony forced himself not to run away screaming. “Understood,” he said brightly. “Do as I’m told or face the consequences. Colour me suitably terrified.”
Tony felt wetness on his cheeks and realised he was crying.
Tony didn’t know exactly what it meant to be a child of Thanos, but he pretty much figured it wasn’t a club he wanted to be a part of, “I’m a little old to be adopted, Squidward.”
“You doing OK Buck?” Steve asked, moving one hand off the steering wheel to gently grip the back of the other alphas neck. He applied light pressure, kneading muscles as Bucky allowed his head to drop forward languidly.
,” I hissed, struggling harder. It was true too. I felt like his weight was pressing down on my lungs. I couldn’t seem to get enough air.
“So talk,” I said, trying for nonchalance despite the anxiety I could feel building in my chest.
“Yeah, except I’m not tired,” I growled, squirming. “Jesus Steve, it’s like a sauna in here. Will you at least give me some space?”
. “Please,” he gasped, lashing out and catching what felt like an arm, above him, pinning him down. He tugged desperately. “Let go.”
The alpha snorted. I could practically hear Steve’s teeth grinding.
Tony struggled to his feet and limped over to his sad excuse for a mattress. He flopped down with a quiet moan of pain, trying not to give into the almost overwhelming urge to just roll over and cry his goddamn eyes out. He didn’t even have the luxury of being able to lick his wounds in privacy, not when the Maw was always watching him.
The other man looked like he wanted to say more but he wisely swallowed his words and nodded once. “OK, let’s go,” he muttered, reaching for the zip and letting in some blessed fresh air.
?” I eventually snapped, unable to take it any longer.
“I should just leave you here,” she threatened, her grip tightening.
“But you’ve been restless all day. Really, brother, it would be my pleasure to take you out for a short walk. Our father is resting, or so I hear; perhaps we might visit him.”
“Why don’t you go fuck yourself, Buck?”
“Later,” Bucky grumbled, nosing at the back of my neck. “Comfortable.”
“Place is called Latern Valley,” the alpha said, gesturing to a brightly lit building in the middle of a small, quiet town. “We’ll rest up here tonight and arrive home mid morning tomorrow.”
He didn’t raise his voice or even sound angry, but something in his tone caused Tony to instinctively draw further into himself. “Nebula,” he said softly, brushing his fingers over her wrist and resisting the urge to shake her. No one had ever accused him of having a very good sense of self preservation but even he realised the stupidity of pissing off the Titan when they were hurt and helpless. “Don’t -”
“Such thoughts won’t help you, terran. Best not to think of them.”
“But, who-”
“I saw him,” a second voice argued, the timber unmistakenly female. “Small, bearded and dirty. He’s been travelling with you for days.”
I was very young when I first realised there was something fundamentally different about me. At first I couldn’t understand why the other kids didn’t want me to play with them, especially when they so readily accepted one another. I grew up believing there was something wrong with me --
“Fine,” the other man said, bending down until our faces were level. His eyes really were extraordinarily blue, I thought as I struggled to meet his gaze. “But if you try to run I will catch you. Know that.”
“Stop,” he tried to scream only to realise Nebula’s hand was placed firmly lover his lips. He couldn’t watch --
. Do you guys intend to make me the filling in your alpha sandwich again? Because I’ve gotta tell you, that kinda puts a guy on edge.”
,” Steve said, arms outstretched in appeasement. “Whatever you think we’re going to do to you, we won’t. Bucky just thought you might be more comfortable -“
“Hey, do you smell that?” someone piped up.
New chaptttteeerrrrrrr!
Tony swallowed, fighting the urge to thrash in a desperate attempt to escape. The last time he was close to the Titan, the alien stabbed him. It was not a pleasant memory. “Is he alive?”
I pointedly ignored the slur and bared more of my throat. “I just want to leave,” I whispered, aware that I absolutely stunk of terror. God, I wanted out of the car.
Steve growled softly, a gentle reminder that he was still pissed at me. “He’s a fast healer.”
The alien lifted its head very slightly and it's face twisted into something hard and ugly. “I was told that your greatness cleansed the universe, so that those of us that remain may live a life of order and reason. Is this true?”
“I can think of worse things to be,” Tony rasped, forcing himself to meet the aliens fishlike gaze without blinking.
“So that’s what you look like,” Bucky said, grabbing my chin and tilting my face up. “You’re even prettier than I expected.”
“He has other uses,” Thanos said, watching as the human was lowered to the ground and immediately tried to squirm out of his daughter’s grasp. “Intellect can do much, when properly nurtured,” he wiped his finger over the still healing cut on his cheek and watched the Terran's eyes widen in understanding. “You recall Nebula,” he said, gesturing to the girl, lying prone beside his throne. Stark had clearly already seen her and didn’t react. “You will keep her company whilst I take court. Observe, my child.”
Bucky chuckled darkly. “Steve’s kinda old fashioned.”
I could feel that familiar shocking ache in my chest. The pain that never seemed to go away no matter how much I told myself I was getting better.
“Healing, mostly. And you?”
“Silence, weakling,” the woman snarled, shooting him a warning look before walking away.
“She’s gone,” the android insisted, smiling terribly. “And she isn’t ever coming back. And it’s your fault. You -“
I started when I heard a number of booming voices, resonating from inside the saloon. I stopped mid step, spooked like a goddamn rabbit. The place looked as rough as fuck. Was I really desperate enough to go in there?
Steve started the car and moved forward. I looked in the rear view mirror and noticed Bucky was following us. “So, two cars and a brand new omega. Quite the haul for you guys.”
“Here I am,” Tony agreed, wiping his hand tiredly over his face. “You miss me?”
“I gotta say, we’ve never had to do this before,” he noted, grabbing my wrists and tying them together. He tethered them with a short rope, which he tied around his own goddamn wrist/ “I think it goes without saying that I don’t want you to try anything like that again.”
Panic flared and I tugged desperately at my belt until it popped free and I was able to scramble to the drivers side of the car. I moved slowly when I stepped outside, feeling my limbs shake and knees threaten to buckle.
“Got it,” I said, unresisting as I was dragged forward. Steve’s grip was firm, yet despite the anger I could sense from him he wasn’t unnecessarily rough.
I decided to stare at Bucky. At the very least it might make the other man uncomfortable. Annoyingly it didn’t seem to phase him much and after a while I got bored of that too. I started to tap my fingers against the door, my knee, the window, anything I could reach. After a little while, just when I thought my brain was going to implode, an idea took root. It was a bad idea -- a terrifically stupid one in fact -- but I couldn’t seem to shake it off. The longer I sat there the more the urge to act gnawed at me.
“Of course, my lord,” he answered, bowing gracefully. “I am but your obedient servant.”
Even though his eyes were still closed, Steve’s mouth twisted into a half smile. The dick thought the whole thing was funny. He was laughing at me.
“Well, not to use anything as ridiculous as logic in my defence, but you did kidnap me. Maybe this should be a life lesson. Don’t kidnap people.”
“Open the door,” the brunet demanded, his eyes tired but his expression faintly amused.
“There wasn’t a third,” Steve rasped, sounding absolutely wrecked. What were they doing to him? Why was he lying for me? “It’ just-just us.”
He sounded so sincere and earnest. I wanted to vomit.
Tony had never tried silence before and it appeared to be driving the Maw crazy. Awesome, Tony could totally get behind that. Anything he could do to piss the alien off was a win as far as he was concerned.
I lay their for a while, thinking about all the terrible things that could have happened and working myself into an utter state. I must have fallen asleep because it was daylight when I was woken by a soft knocking sound.
Steve gave him a hard, long look. “Nothing I say is going to convince you that you’re safe with us, is it?”
“Your flippancy is unappreciated, Stark,” the alien said in his calm, overly polite voice. In some weird, twisted way it almost reminded him of Jarvis. “You are aware you are our prisoner?”
He was so still. How could anyone sit in the same place for such a long time. Was he even blinking?
“Why?” I sniped. “Did it hurt?”
The Titan released a deep, thoughtful hum that made the hairs on Tony’s arm stand on edge. The air suddenly felt charged and tense. “How might i serve you, my friend?”
. I didn’t back down easily. Not unless I absolutely had to.
“She was my sister.”
“You talk too much, Stark,” the Titan said, amusement clear in his tone.
“He’ll return,” she spat, pulling him to his feet with disturbing ease. “We’re a loose end. We pose a risk to him.”
Thanos turned back to hall and moments later the great doors swung open, drawing everyone attention. Tony took the opportunity to edge closer to Nebula. If he could get his hands on something sharp he was sure he could break the thread. As he reached for her, her hand shot out and gripped his wrist. She shook her head slowly.
“Lucky him,” Tony said brightly, flashing a painfully wide smile. “You want to ease up a little? You’re hurting me.”
He could tell she didn't want to show her back, despite how much of a non-threat he posed. Tony could only guess what she’d been through to make her that way. In fact, he realised as he wrapped his arms around her shoulders and neck, he knew absolutely nothing about her.
“What does he want?” Tony asked, fighting to control his panic as he sat up and rubbed soothing circles over the patch of scarring on his chest. It was an annoying and subconscious gesture he’d picked up after removing the arc reactor. He was aware it made him look vulnerable and when he realised what he was doing he quickly dropped his hand.
“It’s okay. I guess I’m confused. I know you said your alpha-”
“I’ll join you.”
With two out of the four pups under control, Steve rushes to take his youngest from a very overwhelmed Happy. It only takes a few minutes to get Peter calm.
Steve loves how good of a father Tony is. Morgan was the luckiest girl in the world to have someone like him in her life. Steve would say the same. Tony was his rock, the one person who could turn his whole day around by just smiling.
“We’ll see okay? Papa needs to get better first. He’s really sad about the baby. Make sure you give him a lot of hugs and kisses. He’s going to need them.”
The hand in his own squeezes and Peter opens his eyes again. The tears stream down his face. Steve’s free hand comes up to cup his son’s cheek. Peter leans into the comforting touch, and a sob escapes him.
Tony’s careful when he approaches. There’s a slight breeze in the air and Steve’s scent wafts through it, smacking Tony in the face. The natural sweetness Steve normally gave off was there, but his scent was off somehow, tinged sour. It made Tony wrinkle his nose.
The suit fit perfectly and the tie was...well, it was around his neck. He couldn’t tie it the way his daddy did. He would just have to ask for help.
Peter takes a deep breath. “It means I have these really weird powers and I’m super sticky and can shoot web and-”
“I have to go.” Tony jumps up from his seat, grabs the letter, and rushes out of the room, ignoring Pepper when she calls out to him.
“I like the dog and I thought it would be a good distraction,” Steve sniffs again and raises his arm to wipe his nose again, forgetting about the stain he created before and making a new one. It only takes a second for him to realize his mistake and he sobs.
Tony sighs and mirrors his son. “I thought things were going great. I guess I fucked that up too.”
“Did he scream like this? He enjoyed it, didn’t he? That’s all he’s good for, and he knows it.”
“Okay. The car’s up front and running. You have everything?”
“Goodnight, sweetie,” Steve tells her and kisses her cheek.
Peter nods his head and ducks behind Steve when he catches sight of the hologram in the kitchen. Steve shakes his head and steps further into the apartment. Peter clings onto him tightly, burying his face in Steve’s side when they enter the kitchen.
“Wasn’t planning on it.”
His outburst only makes the situation worse. That fear Tony had is creeping up on him again. All he can think about is getting his daughter in his arms.
“It was my pleasure. Congratulations. You two are going to make wonderful parents.”
“You won’t.” Natasha rises to her feet and comes over. Tony would allow her to hug him if he didn’t have his daughter in his arms, but the soothing circles she rubs over his shoulder was enough. “Let me,” Natasha holds out her arms and Tony places Morgan into her arms. “You need to sit down, Tony.”
I’ll update soon! ❤️❤️❤️
“He-wait, he’s going back?” Steve asks.
“Well yeah. It’s known for having a sad beginning. I thought you’ve seen this before.”
After they both have eaten, Tony orders dessert and that’s when Steve waits excitedly for the special moment. But it never comes.
“N-no,” Peter stutters out a reply. “I don’t want an autograph. I just-”
Peter doesn’t protest when he’s placed on the soft carpet. As soon as the television is turned on, all of his attention is on it.
“I’m not...not really. I’m disappointed, but more so because he lied to us and thought he could hide it. I thought we made it clear we’d be there if he ever needed us.”
He wasn’t a killer.
Tony drops down to his knees and buries his head in the bowl of the toilet. Steve can only watch with a mixture of sympathy and disgust. His own stomach is acting up, but he figures it’s because he’s witnessing Tony’s vomiting episode. Steve pushes aside his own nausea to help comfort his husband.
“He didn’t tell you the truth?” Tony questions, giving up on his work to be fully engaged in the conversation.
The door to his lab opens and Tony spins around, surprised to find Pepper. He has a hunch for her unexpected visit.
“I’ll call you back,” Steve says abruptly and hangs up the phone. He lowers himself down onto the closed lid of the toilet, his eyes never leaving the little window of the test.
Steve shakes his head. “No. Everything would be so different now. I probably wouldn’t be able to recognize it.”
Tony hadn’t intended for there to be any tension between when it came to discussing the future plans for dealing with Steve’s depression. They decided against the idea of talking it through with the team; this decision needed to be made without their input. Tony had disagreed at first, arguing that their friends should help them, but Steve was right, this wasn’t about them. It was about him and what was best for him. Even Tony didn’t have much of a say.
Tony blows out a breath. “That’s a relief. No serious damage?”
“Hurry up, kid. I don’t have all night.”
Steve curses when he’s met with Tony’s personalized voicemail instead of Tony himself. For hours he’s been trying to get a hold of his husband, only for the calls and messages to go ignored. If it were any other time Steve wouldn’t have cared if Tony didn’t pick up right away. But this time was different.
“I was thinking of signing it over and making you CEO.”
For years Steve was sure he’d never get a chance of happiness again. When Hydra found and captured him, Steve’s life held no meaning or purpose. Being a prisoner and forced to do the things that he did destroyed him. He had given up and accepted his fate, his new life.
Steve chokes back a sob.
Steve scoops his son into his arms and presses a big kiss to Peter’s cheek. The pup responds by wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and placing his own wet kisses along Steve’s face.
Tony double checks on the pups, and once he finds them fast asleep, he shuts their door and heads toward the master bedroom. Steve is sitting on the edge of the bed, fiddling nervously with his fingers and gnawing away on his bottom lip.
The last thing he expected to see was a bright red sports car parked across from his school. Peter doesn’t even have to guess who’s behind the wheel.
Steve sighs. “I know. But it’s only because I have to keep you safe. Who else is going to fight the bad guys?”
“I did but not...not this way. I’m miserable, Steve. And I swear I’m trying to enjoy this, believe me I am, but…” Tony trails off. Steve doesn’t miss the way his expression softens and eyes glisten with tears.
It had been Steve.
“And neither did you.”
Steve didn’t know it was possible to love someone so much. He loved his mate and the bond they’ve created could never be broken. Tony was his everything. But the bond he’s created with his son didn’t compare. The love he had for that little boy was different. Steve’s heart would swell with joy every time they were near each other.
The omega’s eyes shoot open at the sound of his name, his brows knitting together in confusion. He looks around the room, immediately recognizing it as the guest room in Tony’s mansion. But it’s not the familiarity of the room that eases Steve’s anxious mind- the comforting scent of the alpha is what calms him.
The first night without Steve is the hardest. Despite Tony’s best efforts to keep Morgan comfortable, he couldn’t make her happy. She must know that Steve was missing. It was the only explanation Tony had.
“I do,” Steve replies honestly. “I think I already forgot about it.”
“I did only lose one...right?” Peter looks up at his dad hopefully.
“Not right away. I was scared too and didn’t know how he would react. We didn’t really hang out much. I had a huge crush on him and that’s when Nat decided to play matchmaker.”
There had been one person missing from the cheering crowd. It hurt to know that his papa wasn’t there to witness his graduation. It was a big day for him, a day he would never forget. He’s reminded of the people he still had with him, and that was enough to keep his spirits high.
“I know but you need to be careful. You can’t trust everyone, Tony.”
“There will be no next time,” Pepper frowns. “Not after this. I don’t know what kind of trouble you got into and I don’t want to know.”
“Honey, that’s not-I didn’t mean-”
“Hey,” he says quietly. “Can I come in? Just for a second? I swear I’m not trying to steal anymore time.”
Steve turns on him next, reaching for the arm that has the weapon and twisting it roughly, forcing it behind the alpha’s back. Rollins screams and tries to spin around to issue his own attack, but Steve is faster and presses the alpha deep into the concrete wall, using his weight to keep Rollins pinned.
Tony turns away and heads toward the jet.
Tony smiles and brings Steve in close. “So another baby, huh? That is a surprise.”
“What? But you said-”
“-and practice a few moves.”
“He’s been better. I mean, I’d suppose he has anyway. I don’t know much about his past.”
“Just Papa.”
Steve gasps and his gaze falls on his husband. They share a smile. “She’s...wow she’s already rolling over,” Steve says. There's a bit of hurt in his tone.
He should give up.
“Pizza I can do.”
“No not drug, just put in a deep sleep, thus allowing Steve a chance to get some rest,” Thor says.
At the sound of his name, Steve spins around, his heart sinking at what he finds. Tony is in the doorway, a bundle held tightly in his arms and a gun pressed to the side of his head. Brock Rumlow is with him, one hand holding Tony’s shoulder tightly and the other the gun digging into Tony’s temple.
“All of us?” Natasha asks and Peter nods. She takes a moment to think it over. “Maybe a couple of times. It wasn’t until he had you did he try to make it a yearly thing. I think there’s pictures of you dressed as Winnie the Pooh when you were a year old.”
Im updating this on my break. Just some more idiots who can’t admit that they still love each other lol Hope you all enjoy!
“Thanks,” Steve says. “You didn’t have to do this.”
Sam chuckles. “Hey it’s okay to be nervous,” he says as he follows Steve out of the room and into the hall. “Marriage is a big step.”
Seeing Tony at his door in the middle of the night was the last thing Steve expected. For months he had been trying to reach out to him, only to be ignored and treated like he didn’t exist, like the night they shared together never happened.
“When’s papa waking up?” Peter asks before taking another bite of food.
He turns around, half expecting them to shut the door and envelope him in darkness, but the door remains open to allow someone else inside.
Peter nods. “Yeah. I don’t want to get in trouble again.”
“Why? Do you think you need to worry?”
“Shut up.”
“Hey.” Tony returns the greeting. “How was the run?”
“Let me take her.”
“I’m so sorry.”
“He said it...didn’t he?”
Tony emits another growl, this time for the approaching beta and jumps up to his feet. The syringe is gripped tightly in the beta’s hand as he comes closer. Steve finds the courage to rise and he puts himself between the threat and his mate, baring his teeth in warning.
Bucky complies and shows off his smile. It’s not as bright as the one Sam fell in love with, but it still gets his heart racing.
“Stop, stop.” Steve laughs and pushes Tony away. “We’re going to be late for school and your meeting.”
But Peter is still managing to smile through it all. It’s not very bright and probably forced, but he’s smiling nonetheless. Just proof that he was the strongest among the two. Tony was weak, relying on his expensive liquor to ease the ache. He hides away and pretends that everything around him isn’t going to shit. Peter at least had the courage to face the world.
“I know. Now quit being dramatic and eat your ice cream before I take it back and go home.”
“Gonna...cum!” Steve gasps out the words he was never allowed to say.
The door to his side is thrown open and Happy is there, ready to assist in any way he can. Steve screams again and one hand flies out, finding purchase in Happy’s arm and gripping it tight.
“Is he hurt?” Happy directs the question at Tony. “I didn’t hit him, did I?”
Peter sniffs and nods his head again. “Can we watch the video again?”
“No. I guess I thought because we have a baby now that you’d consider-”
The world continued to spin and life went on, with or without Captain America. But Peter’s world was altered in the worst way. He lost Captain America too, but he lost a parent first. He lost the most important person to him.
“Boy.”
“Not my car. You can apologize to your husband. I’m pretty sure he won’t mind.”
It was difficult to imagine spending a few days with him while Tony traveled to New York. Steve doesn’t want to think about that trip either. He was going to be fine. He had Jarvis and Happy. That should be enough.
“Sort of. I don’t know. I think he was just protective.”
The time appears to be passing slowly. Every second that goes by only drives Steve near insanity. All he wants to do is be by Tony’s side.
Steve gives it a shot. It’s just another failed attempt. It’s tempting to leave a message, but that wasn’t how Steve wanted to break the news.
“I’m trying not to.”
Steve blushes even harder and nods his head. Tony smiles softly and climbs off the bed to take the tray away and set it aside. He joins Steve back on the bed, hovering over him and ducking his head down to kiss him. Steve welcomes the kiss and gentle touches.
“What are you doing?”
Steve reaches out, slapping Tony’s hand away to replace it with his own. Tony’s eyes dart down to watch Steve jerk him off, and he has to bite back the moan that tries to escape. Steve quickened his pace, intending to make Tony cum.
“Because he’s grieving? I lost him too.”
The two alpha’s had been reprimanded, and though it was nice to see them get punished for a change, Steve knew that once he had given birth, they would seek him out for revenge.
“I was just trying to...” Bucky trailed off, his grip around my neck loosening. “Damn, sorry Tony. I was still half asleep. You took me by surprise.” Bucky moved back, finally letting me go. “I wasn’t going to hurt you.”
Bucky, the alpha that kidnapped me. The alpha that I was pretty sure I’d mortally wounded. “Can you -“ I wriggled. “I want to get up.”
“So, what exactly is up with you two?”
, I thought a little numbly as they walked towards me. Bucky didn’t look too great -- his face was covered in blood and he had a huge gash in his forehead. Every inch of available skin looked shredded. How was he even walking?
Thanos seemed to consider his next words carefully. “I have no desire to harm you, but if you disobey me, or if you try to escape I will not hesitate to punish you,” he released his grip. “Do not force my hand.”
“Tony,” Steve said, sounding all kinds of exasperated. “Are you hurt?”
Tony felt wired. He’d been forced into stillness for so long that he was seriously starting to worry he might implode. He stood up abruptly, barely managing to move two feet before he felt an intrusive brush of magic against his cheek. He instinctively flinched back, wary of moving when he knew he was being observed.
He wisely backed off. “Once we’ve finished packing up we’re going to head out,” he said, holding his hand out with a quirked eyebrow. He seemed a little surprised when I let him help me to my feet. “We should be back at the base by tomorrow evening.”
“He did throw a moon at us,” Tony said, deciding to collapse onto his ass next to her. “New plan?”
, that’s enough,” Bucky said quickly, stepping towards me. “You don’t want us to touch you. Fine. Get in the car.”
“It would displease me if he died,” Thanos said, allowing his gaze to wander briefly over the wound he’d inflicted on the terran during their battle. Stark fought brilliantly, encased as he was in his clever metal shell. He had been a worthy, honourable foe.
The Ebony Maw was far too wise to push further. He would obey and he would keep the terran alive, even if he hurt and punished him in the interim. Thanos would not concern himself over such things. His children ever bickered. It kept them entertained if nothing else.
, you’ve kidnapped me. I have been taken against my will, abducted. To be taken to the place of ‘no more omegas’ because they’re all ‘just gone’ for some reason. Go fuck yourself.”
“Oh right, because what I want is clearly of the utmost importance to you guys.”
I dug in, unaware how hungry I was until I started shovelling the lukewarm mush into my mouth.
Bucky’s eyes turned back to the road.
“We’re stranded,” she hissed, glaring at him. “We aren’t leaving here. Not on our own”
“Thanos’s plans are his own. But he will be back. I’m sure of it.”
His teeth were straight and perfectly white. I couldn’t help but fantasise about knocking them out one at a time. “It must be embarrassing, being hit by an omega.”
I’m closer than you think, I thought a little hysterically as half a dozen pairs of feet rush past my hiding place. I help my breath, sure they were going to hear my panicked breathing.
So painfully young.
Tony recognised the throne room as they approached and tried to dig his heels in one last time. He was predictably yanked off his feet, his knees dragging across the ground as he struggled to find his feet.
Tony surprised himself by shrugging. “I hate to break this to you, but you’re not the first person that could break me in two with your little finger. Ever heard of Thor?”
"Awesome. So what’s the plan here, boys?” I asked, curling into myself to avoid touching either of them in the confined space. “Where exactly are you taking me?
“I kind of guessed,” Tony answered, shuddering when those long fingers slid slowly through his hair and curled loosely against his skull.
“Easy, daughter,” Thanos chided softly. “Your brother lacks your strength. He should be handled gently, less you break him .”
“I, I -” Fuck if I knew what do say. I had a feeling an apology wasn’t going to cut it.
“You refer to my traitorous daughter of course?”
I wasn’t going to admit I wasn’t actually planning anything. They were clearly wary and watching me way too closely. I was feeling pretty smug that Steve was actually, maybe, the tiniest bit scared of me. I had mixed feelings - they were unlikely to underestimate me for a third time but at least they weren’t treating me like a fucking cow for slaughter anymore.
“I can’t
Tony recognised a trap when he could see one. He shook his head, very sure he didn’t want to leave the room. “I’m fine.”
“This has certainly been one of our more eventful runs,” Steve said, side-eying me as if I was in on the joke.
Why did these assholes think they had the right to fucking touch me when I was sleeping? I drew my head forward and snapped it violently back. Bucky must have realised what I was going to do because he released a breathless gasp, somehow avoiding a broken nose as he rolled me effortlessly onto my stomach.
“You can calm down. We’re not going to do anything to you,” Steve said, not looking at me as he kept poking at the fire.
“Roger that,” Tony groaned, wondering exactly what it would take to kill the bastard.
I looked at him expectedly and Steve just stared back.  “Okay, I’ll bite. How exactly is he up and moving?”
Tony opened his eyes slowly and immediately fell off the edge of the bed when he realised the Maw was looming over him. It was easily the aliens favourite way to wake Tony up — the bastard clearly enjoyed terrorising him when he was at his most vulnerable and less able to mask his fear.
“Just calm down,” Bucky said, forcing me to straighten up from where I was sprawled across his lap, trying to get to the doorhandle.
“In the van,” Steve growled, low and utterly terrifying.
She snorted irritably and completely ignored him. “The ship may yet be in one piece. Finding it is our only chance.” She started forward again, pulling Tony with her. “We need to hurry.”
I would have panicked if I didn’t know just how badly the other man must have been hurting. I released a low, threatening growl and allowed myself to pass out.
There was yelling but no gunshots. That was a good thing, right? Unless they wanted to save the bullets and were just gutting Steve and Bucky. And yup, there went the guilt. Bucky was helpless because of me. Despite everything I didn’t want him to die.
“Calm down,” a sleepy voice urged as the arm around my chest shifted and a big hand ran soothing circles over my hip. “It’s just me. It’s Bucky.”
Tony flinched back when, with a flick of his hand, Thanos caused bands of silver thread to pierce Nebula’s lips and force her mouth closed. She screamed as it happened, the noise terrible and muffled as she collapsed onto her back, clawing at her face. Dark blue blood oozed sluggishly through her lips. Tony stared at her, transfixed and horrified.
Gone.
A few more agonising seconds and then, finally, he was released.
“Oh,” I said. That couldn’t be good. “Swell.”
That finally woke him up! The larger man grabbed my fist with lightning reflexes before I could take a second swing at him and sat up, dragging me with him.
Steve was standing with his back to me a little further up the road. Bucky was lying in the recovery position next to him. I wondered if he was dead.
I saw her smirk turn into a frown as she reached for her gun. She pointed it in my face and I instinctively showed my throat. “Stay here,” she commanded, waving the gun at me. “If you move I’ll shoot you in the goddamn leg. You hear me?”
I was convinced I was about to have an aneurysm. “Tell me to go to sleep one more time and I’m going to track down my old knives and, I swear this to you, I will stab you in the face. Just try me.”
“Would it surprise you if I said yes?” Tony asked, trying not to squirm with discomfort. He wanted the alien away from him. He needed a moment. He needed to think, to plan and to escape. He needed -- Goddamn it, he needed time to mourn. ”She’s your sister, isn’t she. Don’t you care what happens to her?”
“Then Nat calls us and we come home. Steve, darling, he’s going to be fine. No stress.”
“It felt so real. It felt like all of the times he-”
A small sob escapes him and he has to slap a hand over his mouth to hide it. Tony was just down the hall playing with their daughter, completely unaware that Steve was beating himself up again. He didn’t want Tony to see him like this either. He was supposed to be strong and happy to be a mother.
“Sir,” JARVIS decides to finally speak up. Too late. Tony wasn’t interested in what he had to say. It wasn’t like JARVIS cared. “I recall you promising to quit drinking. Do I have to remind you of your son?”
“Not now,” Natasha warns, her eyes flickering in Peter’s direction.
Maybe she had been lied to.
Pierce rises to his feet and adjusts his suit, then he makes his way over to the seething alpha chained to the wall. Tony has to fight every fiber of his being not to look up at the man that just destroyed his whole world. He’s gripped roughly by the hair and forced to look into those cold, blue eyes.
“What? What is it?” Steve asks, his tone laced with worry.
“Good.” Sam pats Steve on the back. “Now come on. I’m sure Tony is wondering where the hell you are.”
“He is being strange though…” Bucky frowns.
“Talk to me. Obviously you’re worried about him.”
“Hmm? Oh nothing. Just a little tired is all. I think I’m gonna take a nap. Wanna join me?”
“I’m not even sorry.”
But Tony forces a smile and decides to attend. He’d do anything to make his son happy.
The burning in his back has subsided, leaving behind nothing but a dull ache. It’s uncomfortable but tolerable than the agonizing pain he felt before. Tony tries to open his eyes, only to squeeze them shut from the light that blinds him.
“But I invited you.”
Walking away from Steve seemed like his only option. But in order to walk away from him, Tony would have to walk away from the team.
Peter frowns. “I’m 15.”
Pepper rolls her eyes and takes Harley and James by the hand while Happy takes Sarah. Tony switches with Steve and holds Peter so that Steve can climb onto the exam bed.
“N-nothing,” Tony stammers and he clears his throat. “I guess I forgot. Tell him I need to reschedule-”
“It’s fine,” Bucky assures and stands. Sam eyes him closely and Bucky frowns. “I’m not going to hurt him. He’s right. We’ve all made mistakes.”
“I’m gonna miss you, Pete. Be good for Papa okay?” Tony tells his son, then he’s turning toward Steve. “And if he fights you don’t hesitate to call. I’ll be down here in a heartbeat.”
“It depends on the person. Mine lasted up until the second trimester,” Steve replies.
Sam places a hand over Bucky’s shoulder to calm him, but his efforts fail and Bucky is shrugging him off. Bucky stands and turns to leave, only to spin around and point a finger at Tony.
Peter chuckles.
“Steve,” Tony says, making sure to keep his tone calm. Steve snaps his head up at him, showing off his red and tear-filled eyes. “Honey, let me have her.”
Steve grunts softly when his stomach contracts again. Doctor Patterson works between his legs, coaching him through the process of passing the afterbirth. The contractions aren’t as painful as the ones he suffered through to birth his son, but they still cause him to groan from the discomfort.
“Watch me.”
“What about Pete?” Steve questions, brows drawing together. The apartment was too quiet; Peter was usually babbling or cooing to himself.
Steve turns his attention back on his son. “Go get ready. I’ll be right there okay?”
“At least let me help,” Happy says, a little calmer this time. “Something isn’t right. It’s my job to take care of you, remember?”
Gunfire rings out through the room, the bullets flying past Steve. His shield comes to his rescue, blocking the bullets, and they ricochet off the heavy vibranium, hitting the first couple of men and sending them to the floor.
With his parents finally backing off and giving them room to breathe, Peter shuts his bedroom door and leans into the wood, a relieved sigh escaping him. Flash is standing awkwardly in the middle of the room, drenched in water and still looking scared out of his mind.
Peter nods. “I do. I just...I guess I never thought I’d ever hear it. I didn’t know if I was ever going to meet you. My papa wanted us to meet but the rest of my family...well, you know how it is.”
“I know, but you have to go.”
“Yes!” Steve moans and throws his head back. He tucks his bottom lip between his teeth, biting down hard enough to draw blood.
Steve smiles softly and pulls Tony back into his arms. “I know. You’re almost there,” he says, laying a hand over Tony’s belly and gently caressing the spot where he feels their son.
Now that he’s closer, Tony is able to get a whiff of him. He’s an omega. The scent is tinged with fear, making the alpha’s nose wrinkle. But underneath the tainted scent, he’s able to detect the omega’s natural sweetness.
He dreams of their smiling faces.
“Go away!” Peter screams from the other side of the door.
“He’s sitting right there and can hear everything you’re saying. Just a few minutes. That’s it.”
Disappearing from his life.
“Want this?” Tony tries to offer the bottle and Steve shakes his head.
One of the men has taken advantage and issues a hard punch to Steve’s face. The hit is what reminds him where he is and what he’s supposed to be doing. The strong pain in his stomach is once again ignored while he fights off his attacker.
Steve’s breath hitches. They had talked about marriage, but Steve wasn’t sure if he was ready for that. He was already bonded to Tony in more ways than one, and though it appeared marriage would be the next step to take, it was a step Steve was hesitant about.
Tony tips his head back, his falling shut and breaths labored. Steve whines softly and curls up with him, laying his head down on his chest and listening to the soft beating of his heart.
Peter had stopped crying, completely content on Steve’s chest, finding comfort in the soft beating of the heart he'd heard the moment he was given the ability to hear.
“You don’t have to say it,” Peter quickly says when his dad opens his mouth to speak. “I know you’re sorry.”
“Hey! Now I know where the kids get it from.”
“We need to check out your room,” Tony says after a few minutes of silence passes between them. Steve nods, a small smile forming over his face.
He doesn’t get a response, even though he wishes he would.
I’m at work but it’s my lunch break so I’m updating! I hope you all enjoy this chapter! 😊 ❤️
Peter nods and pulls away to wipe at his runny nose. “Thanks, dad. I love you, too.”
Tony chuckles. “Yeah, like adults. And I promise I won’t say anything stupid.”
Peter shrugs. “Sorry.”
“Push gently okay?” The doctor instructs. “The head’s almost out.”
Tony joins him on the bed, deciding to lie on top of the blankets instead of following Steve and climbing under them. It wasn’t like he was going to be getting much sleep anyway. His mind was still racing and unable to find any rest.
“But a good one, right?” Steve peers at Tony, a bit worrisome.
“You okay?” Tony whispers.
He doesn’t want to talk about who he’s going to live with. It was a big decision, one he never imagined he’d have to make. He should be deciding on college, a summer job, or what he wants for lunch. Not new parents.
“We’re using my private facility. It’s better if he does the checkup before the tower opens.”
He immediately recognizes Steve’s shoe and he rushes over, finding the rest of him lying face down on the floor.
“Nothing,” Steve snaps. “Why does something always have to be wrong?”
“Yes! I’m going to fight all the bad guys and keep you safe!”
Peter gasps and pulls away. “Disney World! I wanna go, Papa!”
“It was my fault.”
For the first time since meeting his son, Tony is relieved to find no awkwardness between them. Peter isn’t shy or angry or resentful. He’s smiling and practically glowing with happiness.
It wasn’t just crawling on walls and being sticky that stuck out. Peter was strong, just more proof that the super soldier serum had in fact intervened in the womb.
“Daddy!” Peter cries and reaches for Tony instead of the bag of chocolate chips.
“I mean it. I’ve wanted to know you and now that I can...I don’t know. I just don’t want it to turn bad or anything.”
“Tony,” Steve whispers into the darkness. His fingers find their way to Peter’s hair and he cards them through the curls.
The little pup’s cries begin to diminish until they’re fading into soft whimpers. Steve doesn’t let him go, not even once Peter has fully calmed down. The dream had felt so real. Steve needed to hold his son for reassurance.
“I swear to God if it’s drugs,” Bucky growls.
“You have a mission.”
Tony seemed hopeful this year. Steve had to remind him before the holiday to keep it simple. Steve was perfectly content staying in, avoiding the cold New York weather and curling up with Tony on the sofa. They could do takeout-Steve was dying to try the new Thai place that opened up-and enjoy being with each other instead of a fancy dinner and gifts that cost probably more than they should.
Natasha rolls her eyes and waves Bucky off. “Relax, James. He can take it.”
“No,” Sam shakes his head and gestures for his nephew to come inside. “Buck and I were just…”
“You might need them though.”
“Tony,” Steve says again, his tone nowhere as hysterical as his husband’s. “It’s not the end of the world. We can-”
“Captain Rogers is pregnant,” The A.I. replies, completely unfazed by the information. She appears to be the only one.
“There he is!” Tony from the video says cheerfully. Steve enters the frame, unamused with another video.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees and he rubs his belly, smiling when Peter pushes against his palm. “I can’t wait.”
“You won’t. I trust you.”
“Yeah. Good luck.”
Steve swallows hard. “It will. I’ll do better.”
“Hey.” Steve finally finds his voice. He doesn’t open the door, keeping his belly still hidden from Tony’s view. It would be easier to probably open the door all the way and shout ‘surprise!’ but that wasn’t how Steve had wanted to do this.
He shoots first and the alpha closest to him goes down. The other two have their fingers on the trigger of their respective weapons, but Tony is faster and he fires first, sending them both to the floor with painful groans.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh shit. Was he pissed?”
“It wasn’t!” Rhodey yells back. For a moment they’re left standing in silence. Rhodey sighs and says, “Tony, I’m sorry. I’m sorry that...that all this shit happened.”
“Sir, you’re not listening.”
Poor Steve is still struggling, but it’s going to take time for him to heal. At least he has Tony and their pups to help him.
“Bye, Cap.”
Tony rises from his chair and crosses the conference room to grab a couple of water bottles from the mini fridge. He returns to Steve’s side and offers his mate one. Steve gladly accepts it.
“You can’t stay out here, kiddo.”
“Really,” Tony parrots and he puts an arm around his son’s shoulders. It’s the first real contact they’ve had since meeting.
“This was his. I thought we buried him with it.”
“A little?” Sam snorts and Bucky shoots him a glare.
“I’m too young-oh...another joke?”
A shaky breath escapes him and he squeezes his eyes shut when they fill with tears. But as much as he tries to be strong, he just couldn’t be. He couldn’t be what everyone expected him to be. He couldn’t be Captain America.
“Well, drop that habit. When I say you’re awesome or bad ass I mean it, and you will too. Screw people who say otherwise. Especially that pathetic excuse for an alpha.”
“Which reminds me…” Tony sits up straighter and groans from the pain that shoots up his back. “Junior here is pressing on my bladder so…”
I’ll update soon!
“Guys, stop,” Peter says softly, but his words get lost in the noise the adults are producing.
Sam sighs. “I’m just trying to…”
Steve accidentally releases a sad whine. He nods and peers up at the alpha with glistening eyes. “Yes,” he whispers.
“Sweetie, I already added the chocolate chips. How about tomorrow we make blueberry waffles? Sound good?”
“You should. I’m sure Steve misses you.”
Steve moves through the space until he spots something hanging up on the opposite side of the closet. This rack holds different sets of clothing; they’re more laid back and casual. It’s tempting to take a t-shirt with a name Steve doesn’t recognize, but it’s the black sweatshirt that’s caught his eye.
Yay! Steve is fighting back! I'm so proud of him. Now all he has to do is find Pierce 😈
“Ha!” Tony points a finger in Steve’s face. “It’s a boy! I called it. I won.”
“We don’t have to do this now,” Sam says, his voice shaky from the tears he’s trying to hold back. “This can wait. If you want you can grab some of your things and then we can go okay?”
The dreadful feeling never does seem to disappear. Steve thought he had beat the episode of anxiety back on the jet, but the moment he steps foot on the ground and leads his team through the corridors of the enemy base, the feeling washes over him like a tidal wave, the force so strong it makes him feel like he’s sinking and unable to reach the surface.
Tony pouts. “Hey, where’s my hugs and kisses?”
It’s starting...😈
“Where were you! I called and called and you never answered me!” Pepper cries. She hits him again, this time on the shoulder. It still hurts.
Steve smiles. “You know if you do this, you’ll be giving up a lot. No more late nights in the lab.”
Tony doesn’t appear convinced. “You’re a terrible liar. Do you think maybe you’re-”
followed by James and Harley yelling can be heard. Steve sighs and with his free hand, runs his fingers through his hair.
Steve keeps himself distracted and calm the only way he knows how: sketching. He sits quietly with his sketchbook, hoping the activity would ease his worried mind. But the sketch he’s working on only reminds him of home and the person he’s left behind.
Tony grimaces again and moves across the room to retrieve the gun beside the fallen agent, doing his best not to step in the blood and guts near his feet.
Steve trails a hand between them, running it along the bump before settling it on Tony’s covered cock. He’s rock hard now. Steve gives the bugle a squeeze, pulling a curse from Tony’s lips.
“Dad, please? I really need you.”
“Yeah I know.” Tony rolls his eyes.
Steve leaves. And never comes back.
She’s wide awake and fussing in her crib, kicking her legs and flailing her arms. Her face is red and scrunched up, her cheeks already stained with tears.
“I need mine.”
“Uh-oh. Hormones again?” Sam grins and comes down the stairs to join his friend. He sits down next to Steve. “What’s going on, man?”
Tony scoots closer to his son and lays on a hand over his shoulder. “I’m sorry, kid. I know...I know how you feel. I lost my parents too.”
“I know. Seriously, don’t worry. I’ll deal with it.”
It was going to take a lot to comfort James and assure him that he was safe and away from any harm. Steve doesn’t know the story behind his pups and what Pierce had done to them. A part of him isn’t sure if he even wanted to know the truth. His pups didn’t deserve any of the abuse they had endured. Steve still blames himself and wishes he could go back and prevent any harm from ever coming to them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter drops down to his knees in front of the broken shield. His shoulder slump and he hangs his head, tears streaming down his face as he sobs.
The moment he arrives on campus, Peter wants to jump back into the car and ask Happy to drive him home, but he had already told his papa he was fine.
“But I hurt her. I promised I wouldn’t and I did it, Tony. I hurt my baby.”
“B-Buck,” Steve chokes on the name, blood spluttering from his lips.
“You didn’t have to make me breakfast. We could’ve stayed in bed all day.”
Steve rushes to get the car seat when Morgan starts to cry. He soothes her and adjusts the blanket around her, then he’s leaving the apartment.
Tony makes a fart noise and Steve frowns. Was his husband capable of acting like an adult? Probably not.
“Sorry. I just don’t want anyone to hear.”
“I hate you.”
Steve holds Tony by his hips and he slips one hand free to trail it up and down Tony’s back. “Just breathe, Tones. In and out, remember?”
“He’s not here anymore okay? He’s gone. It’s just me.”
Steve sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Just go as Iron-”
But Tony wasn’t like other alphas and the new position Steve has maneuvered himself in has the alpha seeing red. He growls in anger, the deep rumbling causing the omega to whine and cower.
“I’ll do it. I’ll go in there myself and yank him out. Sound good?”
“But I am-”
“Yeah. It’s a shame we have to go once you’re healed…”
For the most part everything was good. She was lucky to have such a close knit relationship with her family members. Not everyone could say that. But it wasn’t just their closeness she loved. They were a family of superheroes.
Tony’s expression hardens. He did not want to talk about Steve right now. Or ever. At least until he was ready.
“Maybe yeah. I don’t know. I came from...well, you know where I came from. Money, riches, fame; I had all of it.”
“Fine, fine. But I should let Steve stay right? I mean just in case he’s-”
“What?” He asks, even though he knows he should just keep his mouth shut.
“Darling, I’d never. I swear.”
“I’m fine. I just want to make sure you’re okay.”
“Better start planning then. We need better decorations and costumes and-” Tony’s rambling is silenced with a kiss and he smiles against Steve’s lips.
“You did your best. I’m sorry I let you down.”
“Maybe he shouldn’t have.”
Tony follows soon after, forcing his knot inside and locking them together. He grunts, hips stuttering as he reaches his release and fills Steve up. He keeps moving, riding out his orgasm until his body gives out.
“Just think about that memory, okay? I know it’s hard, but do it.”
Peter stares up and screams at the darkened sky. The rain falls on his face, but he doesn’t care. He screams until his throat burns, until his lungs beg for air.
It’s his fault. He never should have run away. He never should have disrespected his alpha.
Movement from behind him captures his attention and Steve spins around, just in time to catch Rumlow crawling for his gun. He’s not quick enough and the alpha fires a couple of rounds; Steve rushes toward Tony and throws them both down to invade the attack. Rumlow’s aim is off and he misses. The bullets stop flying and Steve lifts his head to sneak a peek in the alpha’s direction. Rumlow is up and rushing out of the room.
“Steve, no. Don’t,” Natasha begs.
“Yeah?” Steve can hear the smile in Tony’s voice. “Maguna,” Tony says, softly and Steve smiles at the nickname.
Now that James didn’t see Steve as a threat, he doesn’t growl when Steve asks to hold his sister.
He was alone.
Steve holds his son close, small sobs escaping him. The little pup only clings to him tighter, finding comfort in the omega.
Peter tries to open his eyes, squinting at first before fully opening them. Tony smiles at him and gently wipes around his pouty lips.
Inside is warm and welcoming, something her own home could never be. It was a shame her aunt couldn’t have kids of her own. She would be a wonderful mother. Maybe she’d take Morgan in.
Peter nods, his smile growing brighter. “Our favorite spot was Coney Island,” he says and then adds with a laugh, “he still couldn’t handle The Cyclone.”
He’s sure he failed the test though. If only he had failed the one had taken in the morning.
“T-Tony.” Steve manages to get out his bloodied lips. He tries to speak again, but all that comes out is a painful groan when he’s thrown down and hits the hard floor beneath him. Steve finds the strength to lift himself and he crawls toward Tony, desperate to feel his alpha’s comforting touch. “Tony. Tony, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
“Morgan H. Stark,” Tony says proudly. “Congrats, buddy. My daughter is named after you.”
Sam lays another comforting hand on the omega’s shoulder. “It wasn’t your fault, Steve. I know you’ve probably heard that before but it’s true. Alphas like him...they’re the bad guys. I don’t want you for even a second to think you were in the wrong or you had something to do with his actions. You didn’t. You’re not the bad guy. He is.
“Fuck.” Tony curses and scrubs a hand over his face. He reads over the line ‘maybe one day we can be a family’ and that’s when he starts kicking himself. He feels like the world’s biggest idiot. For years Steve had been trying to tell him something important, and Tony had ignored it all. The last night they saw each other replays in his head and Tony curses himself again for being so stupid. It had never been Barnes.
“Sorry,” Steve flushes with embarrassment. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“Please! Don’t take her. Let me have her. I’ll-I’ll take care of her.”
Tony places kisses along the omega’s exposed lips and jaw, trailing his lips lower, wanting to bite and mark the spot that he knows will bond them forever. Only, he’s met with resistance. His lips graze over smooth leather; a collar has been placed over the omega’s neck. Tony growls.
“I mean it. It’s going to be hard on you. You’re going to feel so tired and achy and...ugh the constipation is terrible and-”
Adoption seemed like the best route, but Peter still needed time to think. It was a big decision to make. Maybe a little too big. But he’s reminded of the help he does have, and that helps him worry a little less.
Steve chooses to ignore their private conversation.
“You think he’s a weirdo?” Peter asks.
Another sniff.
Ned is already waiting for Peter near the front of the school. He smiles and waves and Peter rushes over to properly greet his best friend. Ned’s smile falters the second he sees Peter up close and a frown appears over his face.
There was no denying that Tony’s penthouse was nice. It was extravagant and furnished with the best money can buy, but it didn’t feel like home. Living at the Avengers Compound was huge and made him feel small at times, but it was the people inside it that made it home.
“Do you know what happened?” Tony asks, taking his eyes off the road for a second to glance over at his nervous son.
His heart sinks at the sight. He didn’t know the story behind the baby items he had seen earlier and his uncle Sam never did tell him about the child they weren’t having anymore. Peter didn’t want to fear the worst, but judging by his uncle’s reaction, he couldn’t help but think that way.
The smell of freshly brewed coffee is the first thing Tony gets a whiff of the moment he waddles-yeah, that’s what he’s doing now and he hates it-toward the kitchen. Steve is preparing breakfast and whistling a happy tune that sounds suspiciously like one of his old records.
“Dad!”
Even with his vision blurred, he can still make out the smiley face in the little window of the test. He chokes back a sob and throws the test in the trash. It takes a few moments to compose himself. One look in the mirror shows he needed more time; his eyes are inflamed around the rims and his face is red and blotchy from crying.
“You didn’t knot me.”
Tony couldn’t tell for sure. He wanted to remember that night. He wanted to believe Steve. He wanted to know if that baby really was his.
Tony rolls his eyes again. “Yeah and I thought you were going to butt out of my business.”
In the trees above them birds are chirping, their songs a little too happy for Tony’s taste. Being here didn’t bring him happiness. How could a place like this, full of death and sorrow, bring anyone joy?
“Papa!” Peter rushes into the room having heard the sound of his papa’s voice. He runs straight for Steve, small arms wrapping around his waist. “I missed you!”
“You don’t think I would’ve? I’d give anything to go back and apologize for all the stupid shit I’ve done. But I can’t and it’s...I’m broken up about it. I’m a mess.”
“Please don’t take her!” Steve tries again, only for his pleas to go ignored. Alpha grows frustrated. Like all of the times when the alpha has become angry, he takes it out on the omega. The first slap catches Steve off guard, leaving him dazed and bringing tears to his eyes. His face burns from where Alpha’s palm had struck him. “Please? Alpha, please?”
Tony had even managed to set up a holographic image of Michael Myers in the kitchen. Near the knives of course. That would have to go. Peter didn’t need to be traumatized and Steve didn’t want that up when he was trying to cook.
Tony huffs and tips his head back against the seat. “We still have what, three months? Jesus, we do. Fuck.”
“Cookies!” Harley says and claps his hands excitedly.
“I don’t know. And even if this one isn’t it, I need to keep them safe. I’ve lost too many, Tony. All of my children have been ripped away and...and...I don’t even know where they are or if they’re still…” Steve glances down at his lap to hide the tears that have gathered in his eyes. He peers up when Tony is taking his hand.
“Then what am I even doing here?”
“Is Steve- is he okay? He’s not...you know…”
Steve shakes his head. “You…need to go.”
“That went well,” Steve sighs in annoyance and plops down in his original seat.
Their lips meet again and Steve’s touches grow more confident. He remembers how to touch and please Tony; he could never forget, even if he wanted to. He knew just what Tony liked.
Pepper sighs. “I know these past few months have been...difficult. You’ve been stressed and on edge. I know what happens when you get like that.”
Yay Steve managed to escape! I guess Hydra and Pierce should've done a better job at keeping him contained since he's already attempted an escape before. Oh well. At least Steve is away from that horrible place. Now I wonder who he's going to bump into ;)
Steve swallows hard and wrings his hands together. “I can’t. I see you with Peter and I wish-God, I wish we could be a family.”
Tony is up before Steve. It’s something he’s started doing lately on purpose. He was usually the one sleeping in until Steve woke him and dragged him out of bed. But as of late, it’s Tony getting up before the sun to make a fresh pot of coffee and await for Steve to awaken from his slumber.
“Hey,” Tony gently nudges Peter’s arm in hopes of cheering him up. “He was there. Just like I’m sure he’s here right now.”
“Steve. Sweetheart, I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes, bringing their connected hands up to his lips and kisses Steve’s. “I’m so sorry. I never should’ve left.”
“Again! Daddy, do the other one!” James points at the tree just behind the one his father just blew up.
Tony grunts above him. He can tell Steve is close, not just from his declaration, but by the way he clenches tightly around him. It brings Tony closer to the edge.
“Think of Pete,” Tony smiles and brushes back the damp strands of hair that have fallen in Steve’s face. “You have to do this for him. Your pup.”
It had been a while since the whole team had come together. Every major holiday and birthday was always celebrated as a family. For so long Peter had wanted his family together, and now he finally had it.
“I’m trying to be. I guess I want to be better than what I had. I never expected to have a pup so...I just want to do something right.”
“Yep. And I think Pete knows why.”
Steve still has his back turned. “Y-yeah,” he replies and he winces from how broken he sounds. He clears his throat and continues with the dishes. “Daddy makes good pancakes, huh?”
“Um...yes?”
He reaches down between his legs to investigate, bringing his hand up quickly when he brushes against a hard mass. His hand comes back sticky and covered in blood.
Tony raises a brow. “You do know about me. Did he tell you that stuff?”
“Did you two want to know the gender?” Doctor Patterson asks. Steve nods his head excitedly. His face heats up in embarrassment when the doctor chuckles. “I thought so. Let’s see if the baby will cooperate.”
“Pete, you need to eat,” Steve tells his son.
“I didn’t mean it,” Tony says, the tears in his eyes finally escaping and rolling down his face. “I swear I never meant for it to get worse. I just couldn’t stop.”
“Nat, that’s enough,” a new voice says and Peter feels relief wash over him at the sight of uncle Bucky walking towards them.
you started throwing up,” Steve is quick to remind.
When it comes down to discussing Peter and that happiness, the meeting only consists of three people. Sam appreciated the input the team had to offer, but at the end of the day, it wasn’t up to them. The last discussion they had as a whole didn’t result in anything other than bickering.
It was a shame he wouldn’t get a happy ending. Well, that was a lie. It may not be like theirs, in fact it would be better. His child was his happiness. He may not have Tony, but he wasn’t completely alone.
The first night with Peter is unlike anything Steve has ever experienced. He had gotten used to his stay at the hospital and the nurses caring for his son. It’s a huge adjustment being woken up every couple of hours, but he knew this and he was glad he had Tony to help him.
Well now Tony knows. He's still an idiot for shutting everyone out. It's his own fault. Hopefully I can answer any questions you guys have in upcoming chapters.
James shows off his with the word: Will
The bed is massive, making him feel small. He can’t imagine what Tony must feel like climbing into it every night. Oh right...he doesn’t. Tony made it clear that he doesn’t sleep. Steve wonders if that was just an excuse to get away from him.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m not.”
“I can see that.”
“For what? You didn’t do anything.”
“You’re sure?” Steve asks again, still nibbling nervously on his fingernails. He’s asked that same question after Bruce’s examination on each of his pups. He couldn’t help it. He was worried.
Steve scoffs and shakes his head. “We did the exact same thing. We can’t get mad at him for that.”
Was he crying?
“Papa, we get chocolate chip pancakes!” Peter cries in delight.
Natasha’s expression shifts and she lays her hand over his. “Tony told us last night. We wanted to come earlier but you were asleep and visiting hours were over.”
Tony feels worse. All he had to do was pick up the damn phone and call Steve back. It was as simple as that.
He can’t imagine not having Steve. He can’t imagine both himself and Morgan having to carry on without him. Steve was their rock, the sticky glue that kept them together. Steve needed to be in Morgan’s life, he needed to be there when she took her first step and when she said her first word. He needed to be there for her first day of school, when she graduates college, when she meets someone, when she gets married and starts her own family. Steve couldn’t miss any of that.
He pushes the idea of going down to medical out of his mind, deciding to get comfortable and try to sleep off the rest of the discomfort that still lingers. He changes into a pair of sweats and a plain t-shirt, then he’s climbing into bed.
“Oh my God. Why didn’t you get seen! What happened!”
“Not as bad as yours. I didn’t see my parents die, but I didn’t get to say goodbye to them either. I was a punk and wished I had acted better. I regret it.”
Steve does as he’s told, making sure to take the seat furthest from the alpha.
“Exhausted. I’ve maybe only slept twenty minutes,” Steve says, doing his best to stifle a yawn.
Tony Stark would never be like the parent Peter had lost. Tony proved he could be a decent father when he tried, but he’d never be like Steve. Their relationship would never be like the one Peter had with his papa.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “It’ll get easier. I promise.”
It takes a moment for a response and then Sam says, “That makes one of us.”
Tony’s head is slammed into the wall and then drops down to his chin. His ears fill with the sound of dress shoes on the floor, followed by the door being unlocked. It opens and then shuts, leaving them alone at last.
“You’re going after them. I’m not doing that again.”
“N-Nat,” Steve rasps. He winces when he tries to move toward her, the pain from his wound worsening. He grunts and slumps back against the wall, his legs threatening to give out.
“I know. This just parallels my last experiences and-” Steve stops himself, taking a shaky breath to calm his nerves. Tony is taking his hand and offers a smile.
Pregnant.
“No more scraps of paper and that broken pencil you use. Now you have all this.” Tony waves a hand over the brown leathered bag that houses the supplies.
“Really?”
“I think he had a bad dream,” Steve carefully places his son in the middle of the bed and pulls the duvet over him. Peter snuggles with his puppy and his dark eyes flutter.
Peter eventually comes down to the kitchen to join his father, still groggy and struggling to wake up. Steve shoots him a smile, getting a tired one in return.
Peter shakes his head and slips the photo back into his pocket. “I don’t know. He’s...I don’t think he cares. I can do this alone.”
“We’re gonna be late,” Ned says, a small frown on his face. He must know something’s up.
They were going to be disappointed, mad even. His papa might be more understanding but his dad would see red and probably yell.
“I don’t want to know.” The omega holds up a hand to stop him from going any further. “Have you seen Tony? I’ve been trying to get a hold of him all morning and-”
Tony can’t help but frown. “You know it sounds like you’re putting me down. Just go ahead and write ‘world’s worst dad’ on my forehead. Maybe I ended up like my father after all. Or worse.”
“True. Don’t give me a reason to use it, Stark.”
“Yes!” Steve beams proudly and scoops Peter into his arms, hugging him close and kissing his cheek. “Petey, you did it! I’m so proud of you.”
Tony holds up a hand to silence the rambling and Peter falls quiet. “I’m gonna stop you there. I’m sure you already know the answer to most of those questions. We don’t have to go over that again.”
The door to the extra bedroom remains locked. Tony offered to transform it into a new office or an art studio, but Steve refused. That was supposed to be Peter’s room. It belongs to no one else.
“Thought about it. He called last night and he’s having these weird little pains. It’s nothing serious,” Tony says quickly when he catches the concerned look on Pepper’s face.
The bed is cold when Tony wakes, a surge of panic rushing through him when he realizes that Steve isn’t lying beside him. Tony is out of bed in seconds, rushing down the hall and straight for the nursery. One glance inside the room shows Morgan in her crib peacefully sleeping. A sigh of relief escapes him.
“Believe me it wasn’t an easy decision, but I need to be there for him. He needs me.”
Just a heads up this chapter is dark...I feel terrible about writing it and I came really close to deleting it. This story is tagged appropriately but even that doesn’t make me feel better. Here’s another warning. There is a rape scene in this chapter. If you want to skip it please do so. I’ve add the star * to indicate when it starts and when it ends. This was difficult for me to do and now I need to go write something happy and fluffy.
“Look at my face!” Peter points at the one of him during his first birthday and the chocolate frosting covering his cheeks and eyes.
Peter’s aware of the tears that form in his eyes and he has to turn away from Ned to hide them. Ned doesn’t appear to notice and continues to talk about his weekend. Maybe he does notice and doesn’t know what to do. He’s seen Peter cry plenty of times throughout their friendship.
I plastered myself against the passenger side window and bared my throat. Steve scent was giving off a startling sense of
I gritted my teeth at him in a mean smile.
“What are you doin’?” I asked, my words a little slurred as I tried to push him away.
“I’m good, thanks.”
“You’ll bring him into the fold, my lord?” the Ebony Maw asked, his distaste clear as his hand tightened rigidly on the terran’s shoulder.
Bucky reappeared then, balancing three bowls in one hand and a jug of water in the other. He smiled sheepishly at Tony, his skin littered with scabs that looked weeks, not days, old.
“Sorry, I thought it was moving.”
Tony closed his eyes but it did nothing to block out the sound of snapping and cracking. He wanted to plug his ears but Nebula was holding him immobile and he couldn’t break her hold. He couldn’t plead with her or scream or do anything other than listen to another living creature be tortured and agonisingly killed right in front of him for the crime of wanting to avenge his family.
”Cute,” Bucky said, getting on the bed and bullying me over until I was practically pressed against the wall. “Hope you’re a hugger,” the alpha said brightly as he wrapped his non-metal arm around my waist.
“Just omegas,” he interrupted.
I didn’t say anything.
“Rude,” I said, tapping my fingers against the glass in a rapid pattern. I felt eyes on me and stopped mid-tap. “It’s Tony.”
I felt the bed dip and realised Steve was next to me. I curled further into myself and tried to remember the things Pepper would say when I was freaking out.
“Do you think it was painful?” he asked, the words escaping without his consent. Once they were out though there was no taking them back. “Do you think they suffered?”
“Are you actually apologising for not doing a better job of kidnapping me?” I asked incredulously, turning around to face him.
“I need a second,” Tony said, crouching over in pain. “...just a minute.”
-- I couldn’t breathe. How could she be gone? How was it possible I’d never get to see her again?
“We’ll be home in a couple of hours,” Bucky said and he sounded delighted by the idea.
Except there wasn’t anywhere else in a twenty mile radius.
Would they rape me first? Probably, although It would depend on whether they shot me before they caught a whiff of what I was.
“You looking to trade?”
“Maybe this is just how I smell,” I said, shrugging. They could complain all they liked but I wasn’t about to get any more relaxed. “If you don’t like it I don’t have a problem getting out of your hair.”
“Small and clever Stark,” Thanos breathed, dropping down to one knee and caressing Tony’s cheek with his huge, blunt fingertips. “You know when to speak and when to hold your tongue. You know what happens to those that oppose me.”
“You OK in here?” he asked brightly, his eyes passing over me speculatively. “You were making a hell of a ruckus.”
“You’re not hearing me, asshole. You’re crushing me. Get off!”
at him. As suspected he deflated a little, making himself look smaller and less threatening. “Hey, it’s OK” he soothed. “You don’t need to be scared. No one's going to hurt you.”
Because Jesus, that was a close one. I didn’t know exactly what Steve and Bucky had wanted but kidnapping a man off the street didn’t exactly paint a caring or nurturing picture. And the fact that they called me an Omega was beyond disturbing. They shouldn’t have been able to smell it. My heat was months away and I was covered in so much dirt and crap that my natural scent should have been complete masked.
“She awaits our fathers pleasure. Given her recent transgressions I don’t imagine he will be lenient,” a short pause. “Does that concern you, Stalk? To know he will hurt her?”
Bucky shrugged, plunging beneath the water and spilling suds over the sides of the tub. Steve signed and client yes his jaw, but he didn’t scold the other man for making a mess.
“Jesus,” Buck said, looking at Steve.
. His face was a mess of deep abrasions, blood and grit. How the hell was he even sitting upright with wounds like that?
“You don’t need to do that,” Steve said distastefully, pulling back his hand. “I’m not going to hurt you.”
“Knives. Good ones too. In mint condition.”
“He’s my father.”
“A risk?” Tony snorted and immediately regretted it when the wound in his side flared with pain. He allowed himself to be dragged forward, unsure where she was taking him but incapable of mustering the energy to care. “He has all of the stones. He’s invincible.”
My stomach grumbled and cramped, reminding me that I hadn’t eaten anything for almost three days. I didn’t have a choice. If I wanted to survive I needed to interact with people. I needed to trade.
“Only my pride,” Steve muttered, smiling at me again as he rubbed at his jaw.
“Yeah, I’m pretty good with engines,” which was the understatement of the century. “You guys got electricity where we’re going?”
I immediately tried to scramble out after him but Bucky grabbed me with the metal arm and I realised pretty quickly that I wasn’t going anywhere. “You don’t need to do this,” I said, allowing my eyes to widen as I fisted his shirt and pulled him close. “I’m not - I’m not what you think. You just need to let me go.
“You’re wrong.” Steve said steadily, “It’s just the two of us.”
“Do not goad me into hurting you, human. I may not kill you but I could inadvertently maim you.”
“A weak race,” she snarled, her eyes locked on the Terran. “Nothing should be so easily broken.”
Peter blows out a deep breath and starts pacing the room, his fingers running through his hair and pulling it, not caring about the pain he inflicts on himself. He can feel Ned’s eyes following him, but he can’t bring himself to look at his friend. It would be easier to say what he has to say without seeing Ned’s face.
“So, why are you only after omegas?” I asked. I was pretty sure I would be happier not knowing, but I figured knowledge is power.
And it did absolutely fucking nothing.
“Like I said, I’ve managed up until now,” I said, wondering if he thought I was a simpleton because of my secondary gener. I’d known men like him my entire life. Asshole alphas that thought they were so much better than everyone else because they possessed a knot .
The Terran didn’t say anything for a long moment. He looked very small, stood between the Ebony Mar and Proxima Midnight. Eventually he ran a hand through his dark curling hair and shrugged. “Yeah,” he muttered without looking up, his tone sullen and disrespectful. “I feel swell.”
I shrugged. “Depends on whether I’m allowed to leave the bedroom or not.”
Steve grunted unhappily but finally seemed to get the message. He lifted himself up enough to let me squirm out from underneath him but didn’t let me get very far before wrapping an arm around my waist and pulling me into his side. The shithead was trying to make me the small fucking spoon! “Sleep. We’ve got a long day ahead of us.”
“No, I think you’re saying everything perfectly. You want to take me back to your little wonderland so you can lock me in and gently encourage me to let some asshole alpha stick his dick in me and knock me up, all for the greater good. Am I right?”
“And were they evil and deserving of death?” the alien asked, rising from his lumbering half bow. “These people that you destroyed?”
He resisted the urge to pull away. It was impossible not to imagine how ridiculously easy it would be for Thanos to crush Tony’s head, to break his neck or crack his spine. A tiny bit of pressure and…
I had enough time to yank Bucky’s gun free before the car flipped. The noise was terrible and all I could do was close my eyes and brace for impact. The seatbelt cut into my chest and the airbag deployed. I was jarred violently and had a brief second to consider how desperately I didn’t want to die.
“I mean, I knew alphas were strong. It’s one of those universally accepted facts - big biceps, small IQ’s - but you two, you’re not just buff, you’re freakishly strong. Like impossibly strong. I saw you rip a man's arm clean off and that ain’t normal.” I looked between them, waiting. “Well, anyone want to share with the class? Don’t be shy.”
“Indeed I do,” Thanos said, sounding amused as he leaned forward in his great throne. His vivid violet eyes moved languidly over Tony  “Are you well Stark?”
Tony moved a little closer. He knew better than try to touch her. The woman wouldn’t welcome it, but he hoped his presence might make things a little easier.
He wanted to go home.
Jesus, what sort of resources did they have that they could use water just to wash?
I watched through half-lidded eyelashes as she loomed over me, pressing her hands over my body in a perfunctory manner I quickly realised wasn’t sexual. I felt myself relax minutely when I realised what she was doing. “I’m not hurt,” I said, my voice raw but steady.
He stood up slowly and was pleased when his legs managed to hold his weight. It was impossible to tell how much time had passed since he’d been taken but he didn’t think it had been more than a handful of days. The healing technology the aliens possessed was extraordinary advanced, especially considering he was pretty much on the brink of death when he was first brought in.
“Do you like this kid?”
The sound of footsteps reaches his ears and Steve peers up, finding the familiar face of Doctor. Patterson. She smiles warmly at him, but he knows behind the smile is a load of questions for him. Steve dries his eyes quickly, hoping that she’d mistake his tears for joy and not the fact that he was scared out of his mind of the two tiny humans in the room.
Sensing the excitement Dodger begins barking and wagging his tail.
Steve shakes his head and runs his hand along the smooth rail of the crib. “No. This is all new to me. My ma didn’t have a theme or any of this,” Steve explains, waving his other hand around the space.
He flinches when Tony reaches out for him. Steve whimpers when Tony’s hand brushes against his cheek.
“Thanks, Nat.”
He scolds himself. It wasn’t just Steve’s body that was perfect. Everything about the omega was perfect.
“Does this even count? He’s almost 16-”
“The baby-”
“You promise?”
“He was abused okay! He came from a screwed up place. All I know is there’s a chance that the pup he’s carrying could be mine, and I can’t just throw him out there when he’s being searched for.”
“I don’t think humble is the right word,” Steve mutters.
Tony takes his coffee and thanks his bodyguard. “You can wait outside.”
Peter forces a smile. “I’m fine. Everything’s...good.”
Steve huffs and lies his head back again.
“I’m surprised to see you here,” Bruce says and he walks over to stand in front of Tony. He folds his arms over his chest as he looks Tony over. “You look like-”
“What do you know?” Natasha smirks. “Right on time.”
But now Steve wanted to take their love to the next level. He had done it once before when he agreed to marry Tony. But something was missing now.
“Hey! You’re going to hurt the baby!”
The idea to find his dad and meet him doesn’t leave Peter alone. It gnaws at him. He’d give anything to have his father to guide him.
Breathe with me Tony.
“Being?” the man asked, his expression bored.
“Test me again, daughter and I promise you that you’ll regret it,” the Titan said mildly as he looked down at his prisoners. “Do not interrupt me again.”
Damnes dropped before the sound of the gunshot registered. I fell to my knees next to his dead body, unable to tear my eyes away from the hole in the middle of his forehead. I hadn’t had cause to see too many dead people before. I couldn’t honestly say I liked it.
“Steve,” I hissed, attempting to wriggle free. I wasn’t really surprised when he didn’t budge. He was a hell of a lot bigger than me, taller and heavier, and it wasn’t as if I’d been getting a regular amount to eat recently. “I can’t -- get off me.”
Steve looked over at Bucky, frowning with his signature sourpuss expression. “I don’t want our people to worry.”
She nodded, not pushing even though they both knew he was full of shit. Maybe she did have a little empathy after all.
He felt long fingers curl in his hair seconds before he was dragged to his feet. The Maw transferred his grip to Tony’s upper arm and squeezed painfully. “Do you still wish to go for a walk, little brother?”
“You know what, on second thought I should probably be going. People to see, places to go. The whole spiel. See ya -”
“I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that, usually, after the initial panic wears off most of the omegas we rescue are thankful. There’s so much worse out there, after all. They at least understand that we’re not like them.”
“If you didn’t want to be barfed on your shouldn’t have kidnapped me,” I said, trying to tug my arm free from blondies death grip. The man was strong, even for an alpha. “Seriously,” I snapped at him, trying to mask my fear with exasperation. “Let go already. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Forgive me my lord, but is not within your power to heal his wounds?”
I sat there for a few seconds, considering what to do next. The keys weren’t in the ignition. Clearly they weren’t
“No one is going to hurt you,” Steve said softly, clearly trying to be authoritative as he ushered me into the car and locked the cuff around my wrist. “You won’t be forced to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.”
“Yeah, how about you go fuck yourself,” I murmured.
“We’re getting cleaned up and then you’re going to be be quiet and go to sleep,” Steve said, his tone bordering on impervious as he used his grip on my arm to push me onto the thin mattress. “I don’t want to hear another word from you.”
I debated with myself and I reasoned I was going to have to go to sleep eventually. Driving until I had an accident was just stupid. I found a side road a little while later and pulled off. I hit the engines and just sat there for a little while, trying to calm the vicious beating of my heart as I tried not to think about everything that could have happened to me.
“Just turn around,” Tony said, making a circling gesture with his finger. “I’ll climb onto your back. Keeps your movement range relatively unrestricted and I keep an iota of self respect.”
Tony felt suddenly and painfully ashamed. “I’m sorry.”
The sky was almost completely black.
“What happened to them?”
“You distress yourself, Stark,” a polished, unsympathetic voice oozed.
Tony almost jumped out of his skin when he felt a huge hand envelope the back of his skull. He was pulled forward, his face tilted upwards until he was staring directly into the mad Titan’s eyes.
Thanos simply lifted his arm and the alien halted, its mouth opening in a silent scream as its body started to slowly compress. Bones broke and cracked as the aliens huge limbs bent into unnatural angles. Tony couldn’t stand it -- he couldn’t watch anymore.
Which even back then sounded like utter bullshit.
“Keep an eye on him,” he said laughingly to the Steve before pushing the door shut.
, Tony thought a little hysterically. They were the last two people left alive on the planet, he was pretty sure he was dying and his companion had the emotional range of a gnat.
He didn’t pause when we entered the inn, pulling me up a short case of stairs and stepping uninvited into a compact room with one bed and a large bath. Bucky was already stripping when we entered. He looked back at us momentarily before lowering himself gingerly into the tub.
And yup, I just puked all over good ol’ Bucky’s lap.
“Uh, hi,” I said, leaning back a little. Jesus, he looked intense.
Bucky kept nodding. “Even so, I’m gonna have to insist.”
“No,” I said, turning to look at Bucky. Fuck, how was he still standing?
Stark grimaced in response, releasing a soft inarticulate whimper as he attempted to shy away from the pain. His thick, curling eyelashes fluttered gently as he began to regain consciousness.
“There were three of you,” someone growled out and I had to bite down on my fist to stop from whimpering. I suddenly realised what being scared shitless really felt like. “We saw him. An undefined male. Where is he?”
“Follow me,” the Maw said, turning his back on Tony and striding forward, confident the engineer would follow. “And do not touch anything. Disobey and you will be punished. Keep our father waiting and you will be punished.”
It was too sudden. It couldn’t be real.
“Oh sure, I’m just swell,” I sniped, unable to look at the damage on his face and body. Except, was I going crazy or did they look a little less severe?
I clawed at the edge of the mattress and tried to use it as leverage to pull myself free. “Get off,” I snarled, some distant part of me aware my voice was verging on hysterical. “Get off me.”
“It suits you,” Tony said, smiling at him. He wasn’t really sure why he was being a smart mouth. He had lost. He had so clearly and painfully lost and there was nothing he could do to bring them back.
About an hour later I started messing with the glove compartment and felt my heart burst when I realised it was chock-full of water and protein snacks. I pulled down the scarf covering the lower half of my face and didn’t waste any time helping myself. I was still starving and I figured they owed me. Fuck knew where my knives had gone. Not that they were really any good to begin with, but they were all I had.
