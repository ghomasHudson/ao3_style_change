“Well, it’s not like she’s never seen me naked.” Cas flicked his eyes to Dean’s mouth and then looked straight ahead. “So... Have you told your dad yet?”
Dean kissed his forehead and closed his eyes, trying not to focus too much on how good it felt to have Cas in his arms.
comment and when he didn’t, it only cemented just how serious Castiel was about this. “You got this Cas. I know you got this.” Without thinking, he took Cas’ hands in his and could feel some of the tension release, just at the small amount of contact between them. “I’m here.”
Cas bit at his lip for a moment before sliding over and reached for Dean’s pants. “Keep your eyes on the road and find somewhere to park.” He lowered his head into Dean’s lap and pulled him out of his boxers.
Dean pulled off with a smug face he surely deserved. “Shower with me.” He pulled Cas along with him without waiting for an answer.
He eventually stood, setting his empty glass down on the counter and quickly brushing the glass clean. He made his way toward the jukebox, stopping right behind the man long enough to grip his hip hard and growl into his ear from behind.
He sighed, he should have known getting away from Michael wouldn’t be that easy. He was sure Benny would want his bed back at some point as well but it was fine, Michael only came once and nothing put a man to sleep faster than multiple orgasms. “Want me to leave you with a going away present?”
One way or the other, he needed to take his life back. The cops had been on a rampage trying to find him and although he’d been more careful than ever, he was starting to get paranoid. He needed to stop hunting dark haired, blue eyed men but the only way he knew how to do it was to get back to Cas.
“You might’ve just killed us both, and over what, a chick?” Dean pulled over into a gas station and parked the car by a pump, sitting still for a few moments. “If I wasn’t so fucking scared about what’s gonna happen to us now… that might’ve actually been
He’d hoped he wouldn’t have to say it out loud, but nothing about any of this had been easy. Dean shrugged, sucking air through his teeth. “I mean, you’re welcome to stay... but I gotta warn you. I’m an octopus, can’t help it.”
Cas responded in a tone that was harsher than necessary. “Maybe it has nothing to do with you. Would it be crazy to think that maybe I wasn’t avoiding you, I just wasn’t thinking about you?”
“No complaints here, Dean. That was the best fuck in... ever.” Cas shrugged and walked around to go wash his hands. “The anon idea was for your comfort, not mine.”
Nick took the phone and swiped a few times, staring at Dean skeptically for a moment before pulling out his own cell and calling Cas. “Better not be some bullshit… Sup Cassie, where are you?” Nick laughed and rolled his eyes at something Castiel must have said. Dean would deny it, but the thought of Cas being on the other end of that phone gave him butterflies. He wanted to hear that deep voice again. “You’re disgusting, I didn’t need to know that, I just wanted to know where you were.” Nick’s eyes shifted to Dean, “Alright bye.”
Cas went right back to the same speed he was before he edged him, spit dripping down to Dean’s balls.
surprised, not in the slightest, but he still has no words. He flicks on the light, and both of their boyfriends have to shield their eyes from the brightness, giving Castiel and Ares great views of their glorious cocks. “I was going to ask how the hell they convinced us to date them, but... I mean, I see the bright green appeal.”
“Shit, dunno but you’re welcome to it anytime you want.” Dean rocked his hips up and groaned at the tight squeeze of Cas’ throat. “Fuck, bet you look damn good with my cock in your mouth, whoever the hell you are.”
Dean scowled at the sight. “Are you planning on going somewhere without me? We haven’t needed phones yet.”
“You fucking better! How’s my neck?” He huffed a laugh and bared his neck, letting Dean see the possessive love bite.
“You got it.” He reaches over to the night stand and grabs the lube, shimmying out of his pajamas and spreading his legs slightly. “C’mon... sit on my lap.”
Dean huffed a laugh and dropped his head forward. “Can we get tested and skip the condom next time? I want to feel you come inside of me.”
He was a jittery, stupid mess, but picking out pies helped calm his nerves a little bit. Dean made sure they’d have enough for the weekend just in case, and also enough food and shit that they’d have something other than pie.
Cas noticed him after he sat at the bar. He didn’t suggest him right away, he didn’t want to disappoint Dean. So he watched. He glanced at the man every so often and made sure not to stare. He was alone and he never once looked at a phone. Mostly stared at his drink. “I found him.” Cas mumbled his description.” Can I go make conversation?”
“Fuck those rules. We made them in high school, Cas. I’ve wanted you for a year and now... I can’t go back. I just can’t. If you decide you want to be just friends after then I’ll respect that. I’ll back off but if you decide you wanna try... I wanna try.” He isn’t good with words, especially when emotions are involved — but he’s never wanted to actually date someone so badly in his life. “The more I got to know you... the more I wanted you.”
Cas complied, doing exactly what Dean said without question or making him repeat himself. He helped clean as much as possible and they were lucky enough to find bleach. “Shit. Is it always this messy? Or is this my fault?”
The next thing he knows, Cas is pushing him down and climbing into his lap, grinding down and kissing him heatedly again. "Let me ride you."
Dean screwed up his face. “You’re lucky it ain’t football season yet.” He couldn’t argue with her reasoning though, he’d just made the damn argument that it took forever to get off because she didn’t enjoy them. And if he was blindfolded... a mouth was a mouth, right? It wasn’t like he was gonna turn gay from
Cas sat up with his hair still sticking up all over the place. “Morning. Yes I did. You?” He started eating with a smile. “You let me sleep.”
“Yeah,” Dean breathed, taking in every inch of Cas’ body but not being able to get over those damn eyes. “And here’s me, thinkin’ you were just a chick with a deep voice.”
Dean’s heart pounds in his chest and the pain of his heart breaking again is overwhelming the second he sees Castiel’s handwriting. “Dammit, Cas.” He clutches the envelope to his chest as heavy tears fall down his face. The sob he releases sounds so far away he doesn’t even realize it came from him. After Charlie hugs him she goes inside, leaving him to walk this road alone.
By the time Dean returned, the sun was setting and Cas had already packed up and was sliding on his backpack, ready to start his walk home. He smiled widely and climbed in the front seat of Baby.
He was shorter than Cas, unlike Dean and too skinny. Dean had always been fully clothed but Cas could tell how muscular Dean was under than uniform. Just picturing Dean had Cas half hard.
The second Dean made contact with his skin, Cas groaned low and deep, pushing back more urgently, and Dean could feel his hand stroking his cock.
to touch your cock to get you coming all over yourself like a whore.” Dean reached behind him and planted both hands on the back of Cas’ head, holding him in place as he ground his ass against his face. He knew eventually he’d give in and let Cas take him, but old habits die hard.
“Of course not, baby.” Cas looked him up and down hungrily, leaning forward to take his cock into his mouth. Michael gripped Cas’ hair tight and began to fuck his face.
“Alright, see you at sunset, Cas.” Dean tossed the bag in the backseat and climbed in Baby. “Let’s go Nick, I have some patrolling to do around your neighborhood anyway.” Dean stole one last glance at Cas before putting the car in reverse.
“Not if you don’t wanna be there. Wasn’t as awkward as I thought it would be.” Dean licked his lip slowly, wondering just how good Cas was at keeping secrets. The more he thought about it, the more he wanted to know what Cas actually did look like - he just didn’t know if he’d have the balls to take off his blindfold and didn’t wanna ruin it by looking at probably shitty or super edited Facebook pics. “Go get your hair done or something, it’ll be fine.”
Cas went home to get his scalpel to smooth out some edges. He couldn’t help but look over his shoulder constantly, even though he had his legal paperwork folded in his back pocket and ended up staying there all night, making sure the wall was perfect before he started.
Dean leaned in, tightening his grip on Cas’ cock but finally letting go of his neck. He bit him softly at first, barely grazing his teeth over the skin. He was salty, like Dean’s mere presence made him sweat. He loved it and bit a little harder, trapped skin between his teeth and his tongue flicked over it. The third time he bit down, he broke the skin, pressing his body against Cas’ and pinning him to the car. He did it again, just above the first bite until he could taste blood, and only then did he pull back. He was fully hard now, his cock pressing against his jeans as he yanked his shirt over his head.
Dean’s grip around his neck had Cas struggling to breathe, which of course, had him coming so hard you wouldn’t believe it was his third orgasm in a couple hours... had it even been an hour? Cas didn’t care, because it felt even better than the last two.
“Y’know what... I just might.” He finished eating and crumpled up the wrapper. “Wasn’t touching you with those fuckin’ briefs on though. Laundry’s clean now, so you’re fresh outta excuses.”
"Really? It always calms me down." Dean replied. "Problems just don't seem as bad when you've got a road stretching out beneath you, knowing you could just keep driving." He glanced over at Cas. "Not that I would, of course, but I like having the option." He added as he pulled into the parking lot of the store.
Pamela rolled her eyes, "It's not the end of the world, plus it's just a doll. Fill the role for a month and then you're done. See? Easy." she said.
"To find new victims to bully." Benny supplied. "People are vicious, they are attracted to pain and would cut and cut til they get you to bleed." he said.
Castiel watched their exchange, seeing Dean laugh with the girl and smile normally but also...his playful and flirty smile. He swallowed painfully, why was Dean looking at her like that? Why was she blushing? Why? He felt like he was going to cry, which was the worst. He turned away before bumping into someone.
Then the oven dinged and he looked happy about his timing. He put on oven mitts and opened the oven. The mixed aromas filled the room and Castiel seemed pleased with the results. He slid it onto the counter with something underneath it and then slid the pie in it's place. He timed it so it should be done by the time they finish eating. "Well we should wait for the turkey to sit a little to soak but it would be fine to eat it now." he said.
"Well, I'll be right there with you. Even if someone is there, I'm sure as hell not letting them bother you." Dean assured him, glancing over at Cas as he drove. "So you've got nothing to worry about." He added. He hoped no one would be there, but if there were he'd do whatever Cas needed him to.
"Definitely. Looks pretty comfortable." Dean smiled and moved into Cas's arms, wrapping his own around him as well. "Mm, it is." He added with a grin, settling in against him.
Dean nodded slightly, panting as he glanced over to the stairs. "Yeah," he managed, tightening his arm around Cas as he moved away from the wall and started wading to the stairs. Every step moved him slightly within Cas, but it was no where near enough. He finally made it to the steps and started up the first few, holding Cas as he took on his full weight.
"It is very addicting." Castiel agreed, closing his eyes again and relaxing into Dean's touch. "I enjoy you touching me, it makes my heart swell with affection. That at any moment, I can reach out and touch you, like you can for me." he said. "It's just reassuring, comforting. Just knowing you're there. We don't always have to do anything intimate, but just touching is nice."
“Okay! I’ll be back soon then.” Castiel grinned before heading further into the water and diving down to go hunt.
Dean fell asleep, wanting to ask how he knew his name, but he was exhausted. The soothing hand in his hair made him relax.
They all left quickly closing the door behind them. Gabriel popped back in, "Sound proof walls, just FYI. Take your time...the house is big." he winked. Castiel swatted at Gabriel, who quickly left and laughed.
Castiel's body tensed and clenched down as he moaned. He tried shifting so he could tuck his face more into Dean's neck.
Castiel smiled against his skin, kissing Dean's heart. "Yep." He said before taking off his glasses and setting it aside.
Castiel started walking, taking Dean next to him. He led them downstairs and into the pool room where they had said they would be. He heard laughter and splashing of water so he knew they were there. When they opened the door Gabriel had Kevin on his shoulders and Sam had Charlie on his shoulders and they were chicken fighting. Castiel laughed lightly as they slapped each other aimlessly in the air as Sam and Gabriel splashed each other.
Castiel grinned so wide Dean swore his cheeks are hurting. Castiel climbed up Dean's arm and sat on his shoulder and kissed his face repeatedly. "Thank you for letting me show you." he told him.
Dean stared at Cas for a moment, surprised as always about what Cas really thought about him. He moved closer, resting his hand on the side of Cas's neck. "You're right, I don't see it in myself. But you make it sound like it's so obvious." He hesitated, meeting Cas's gaze searchingly. "It makes me want to live up to the person you see in me, to be better than whatever it is I am."
I know I don't need to. I want to. *Grins* So hold onto the chains okay? I don't want you falling off. I'm going to start now okay? *Slowly pulls the whole swing back and pushes Cas's back a bit to get him started* Then you swing your legs.
Castiel looked at the clock again before grabbing his bag and heading out the door to gym to find Dean. He got crowded in the hallway but he didn't think much of it since it was always crowded so he just tried to weave his way through, saying excuse me before someone pushed him roughly and then another push and he hit a locker by stumbling and dropped his things. Thankfully, nothing scattered out like the first day of school so he quickly stooped down to gather his things, trying to ignore the laughing. He needed to get to Dean to see if he was okay.
Dean frowned slightly as he saw Cas falter, tossing one of the towels across his shoulder and taking the other one as well. He ran it over Cas's body and hair before wrapping it around him, and then dried himself off as well. Castiel let Dean dry him off, taking in the gently care Dean was giving him.
Castiel smiled, he loved being this affectionate with Dean. He squeezed him a little. He rubbed his thumb across Dean's knuckles, feeling protected and safe. He was always comfy in Dean's arms, it made him happy.
"Oh no, I was definitely concerned the power'd go to your head and you wouldn't stop." He said with fake seriousness breaking cracking a grin. "But now you forgive me and we're even." Dean added, looping his arm around Cas.
Dean laughed. "Yeah, I guess I am." He shrugged. "Is that a bad thing?" He asked with a smile, glancing over at him.
Castiel pressed his lips together before he smiled, taking Dean's hand. "Okay, then we'll make this and every thanksgiving after, special. We'll have our own traditions then." He said determinedly. If he didn't have one and Dean didn't have one either when he was young, then it'll be a good experience for them both. He walked him into the store humming. "I like Mac and cheese, do you think you and everyone else would like that? Turkey, of course. Mash potatoes, possible gravy, stuffing, I think green beans, corn or some type of mixture of vegetables. Then pie." He listed. He seemed a bit more excited now, "I think red potatoes would be better, healthier." He said. "That all sound okay?" He smiled, looking back at Dean.
Dean smiled softly, not minding going over to pick Cas up again in the least. He walked over to the table and sat down, situating Cas on his lap and keeping one arm behind his back to help him sit comfortably. "There, how's that? Am I a good enough chair?" He asked, grinning as he got the food out with his spare hand.
Castiel placed his head on Dean's chest, back to snuggling. He sighed with content, humming softly. "Your kisses kind of tickle." he mumbled into him with a small smile.
Castiel rubbed his face against Dean's, feeling comforted by Dean and it was really nice. He always kept the words of Dean close to his heart, remembering every time he had ever expressed himself. He snuggled against Dean, "I'm okay with that. I've already declared you're my personal pillow and protection before." he said.
Dean watched Cas finish the drink, remembering that he had been fine at the party but curious at just how much he could drink. Dean had his own more slowly, taking sips from it. "Well Mr. High Tolerance, do you want another?" He offered, gesturing to his empty cup.
Castiel laughed lightly, still hiding behind the pillow. He had his eyes over the pillow to see Dean, smiling at the pillow. "You're easily jealous?" he asked. "I'm sure you were willing to share me with Charlie a while back." he replied. He was looking up at Dean with an amused expression, not giving up the pillow yet.
Castiel parted his legs for Dean, making it easier on them both. "We don't normally fight for very long. It's mostly short arguments that blow over soon because we know the other cares." he replied. He relaxed, feeling Dean cleaning him out gently. "Do you ever get tired of cleaning me out?" he asked after a few moments. "Before you didn't have to, but now after every time, which has become more frequent, you have to. Does that bother you?" he glanced at Dean again, having a hand over Dean's that was around him.
It was amazing how things shifted once they opened up about how they felt. Watching movies with everyone else found them holding hands under the blanket or messing with each other by trying to see who could give the other a boner first without anyone noticing. He’d skipped the group sex for the very first time in favor of laying in bed with Dean, his head on those gorgeous abs, listening to their favorite songs. They snuck out for another drive - and that time, no one mentioned going back home until they’d fogged up every window of that car
“So… I don’t think I did anything, but Jack… sorry I didn’t mean to use his name.” She waved it off and he continued. “But the student believes I helped, therefore I
Cas kisses all over his face and down to his neck, loving the way Dean came undone. “You're incredible, Dean. I
The first time he smells that cologne on another man, he stops breathing and instantly hates him. He hates that man for wearing that cologne, for walking around, for being alive when Dean is not.
Cas gazed at Dean and bit his lip. The thought of Dean scaring a man had Cas’ cock twitching and he did
womanizers, and Dean had never shown any signs that he was any different. Not that Cas watched him very closely.
took time to come down from, and Cas got his first taste of aftercare. Dean got him water, rubbed his head, kissed him and held him, all before washing him in the shower. He ordered Cas stay the night and he was glad, because he couldn’t imagine the idea of being apart.
“Fuck, okay. Uhh…” Dean slid off the bed and disappeared into the bathroom, coming out a few minutes later with an armful of shit. He gingerly sat down next to Cas, who had rolled on his side and was facing away from him. “Cas, listen. I’m not good at this shit, but let me try, okay?”
“Don’t change the subject.” Cas was smiling but he was anything but relaxed. His leg was shaking and his hand was tapping the arm of the couch as he eyed Dean.
Cas sighed and called David, saying it was okay and that his ex is an asshole. David was more than willing to meet up again, he wanted to thank Cas in person for kicking his ex's ass. Cas wasn’t exactly sure how to ask about the ex so he went with a quick,
"Yeah?" Cas lifts up so Dean can get the condom on and can't believe he's getting so lucky. "I thought the same thing an hour ago."
knows me so well.” Dean teased and poked him in the ribs as they entered the dining room. Cas didn’t get a chance to respond before they were spotted.
“Castiel…” he tested it, and Cas had to pretend it didn’t make him want to bend Dean over the recliner he was sitting on. “I like it.” Dean blushed and scratched his head nervously. “I uh, like to be called… sweetheart and… baby. I dunno why, they just feel good to hear.”
Dean kissed him quickly and then continued to cut, this time slicing a diagonal line southeast, then up and away from the first. He repeated that same action, his breath catching in his lungs at the sight of the blood painting his gorgeous angel’s chest.
When Dean realized Cas was actually coming again, he yanked his body back by his hair and wrapped his other hand around his throat. “Twice, angel?” The words came out much less menacing than he’d hoped, because the second he had Cas’ body upright and flushed with his, he saw the mess they’d made all over his car. Instead of pissing him off, it untethered something primal in Dean and he came
“Okay, thanks for food.” Cas put the pie box in the garbage bag and took another drink of water. “See you later.” Cas was probably speaking to them both, but Dean noticed Cas’ eyes were on him.
Dean stood up, tossing some cash on the bar and walking outside. When Cas followed, Dean turned to him, because there was no way he could take Cas back to the motel... but Cas’ place was an uncontrolled environment and too many things could go wrong. There might be cameras he doesn’t know about, or nosey neighbors or
Dean’s cock twitched and he almost had to adjust himself from Cas’ dirty words. “Both of those things, but that isn’t what I think of most.”
Cordelia’s entire posture relaxes and she drops her more formal tone. “Gotta hand it to you guys, that’s not one I’ve heard before.”
Cas tilts his head. “Dean… you deserve all of this and more. I wish I could do things like this for you every day, but you're so… stubborn,” he says fondly. “It's okay to take a break sometimes.”
An animalistic growl ripped from his chest as he fucked Cas into the side of his car. He could feel that little ring of muscle opened up by Dean’s fingers constricting again, fighting back against the thick, throbbing mass of Dean’s cock and it drove him fucking
“Do you have a camera in my bedroom?” His tone was serious but even in the week of knowing him, Dean had already grown accustomed to Cas’ dry humor.
For a moment, all Dean can do is huff into his neck. He’s riding a high he doesn’t ever want to come down from, and more than that, he doesn’t want to pull out. He’d live and die right here in this spot if it were possible, and the way Cas is smiling into the void tells Dean he feels the exact same. “Yeah, holy shit is pretty damn accurate.”
Leave this town and start fresh - again. Because it was easier to leave than be left and he was sure everyone here was sick and tired of his shit.
Dean had already switched to his Hulu app by the time his phone chimed again and if he jumped up to check it instantly, that’s his business. It was a picture of pancakes.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Pussy.” He turned to Sam. “Look, I was never holding a can of blue paint so I'm 100% positive
He notices in his peripheral that Dean was actually watching him when his face jerks toward the tv to take in the video for the first time. “Y-yeah... it’s good. He looks like a good bottom.”
Cas didn’t gasp for air until Dean had him on his back, he coughed, gagged and tried to sit up, flinching away from Dean. It wasn’t that he was
It actually catches Cas so off guard he’s the one blushing now, and Dean feels like he won that round as he takes a bite of his own, moaning and pounding his fist on the counter dramatically. “Now that’s a fucking sandwich.”
“Yes. Now,” Cas commands, barely holding on himself. He reaches between them to stroke Dean again, his focus slipping until he’s burying himself deep and coming with a whine.
genders. Pansexual can mean bisexual but bisexual can't always mean pansexual... I dunno if I’m explaining it good but I can try again tomorrow when I’m sober because bisexuality is actually more complicated than I can explain right now... there’s also Google which is smarter than me.”
Cas ignored the comment on where he was sitting and cut to the chase, “This is me.” Cas motioned to himself. “Now you see why my own dad couldn’t stand me. Am I making you uncomfortable too, Dean?”
“Nope. At least, not since I got ahold of it.” Dean eyed the hooks and chains littering the walls and the medical table that still had blood stains on it. “Just you, now.”
They both froze a moment, and then Cas reached in to pull him out when the doors tried to close. “Sorry. I couldn’t wait.” He was every bit as beautiful as he looked in his pictures. Dean was actually surprised to only have a couple inches on him, but he didn’t think too much about that, because those eyes… no photo would ever do them justice. He realized he should probably say something back, but Dean was speechless. Cas’ eyes flickered to his lips, and within seconds their mouths crashed together and they heatedly made out against the wall. Dean didn’t even know who kissed who but it was definitely a mutual unspoken agreement.
” Dean asked, Nick nodded hesitantly. “Okay, thanks. You won’t regret this, alright.” Dean patted Nick on the arm. He turned to leave but decided to ask, “Why did you call him disgusting?” Dean asked slightly amused but weary his questions would make Nick close off again.
“That was when I learned to stick to whiskey and not vodka.” He walked over and handed Dean a beer. “I felt so guilty about it.“
for it?” He ran a hand through Dean’s hair lovingly. “You’d tear my ass up so bad I would walk funny.”
“That’s huge, Dean. I’m proud of you, too. I…” Cas stopped himself, “and how does it make you feel?”
a picture of him to remember him by, so he walked over to grab the Polaroid he’d set by the lantern. When he turned to snap the picture, his breath caught in his lungs. The angle was perfect, something he wouldn’t have even thought to stage - on his knees, Castiel’s body blocked out that of the angel on the stained glass window behind him. The wings of the angel rose up on either side of Cas...
to get Cas released early to him. Of course, Dean searched Cas’ bag the second they walked in his house, instantly finding one of Cas’ pill bottles and went straight to the bathroom to flush them with Cas right behind him, “That’s really bad for the environment you know. You’re supposed to turn them in or some shit or just let me have them so I can taper off.”
“Yeah... we probably should.” Dean bites his lip and looks at the come on Cas’ body, his hand reaching down to his dick. “Can I use some? I wanna know how it feels… knowing it’s
He could see the blood and more importantly, the primal look in Dean’s eyes, the green almost nonexistent.
Their eyes met again, and both were powerless to look away. In fact, if it wasn’t for the damn car horn, Dean was sure they almost kissed.
“No I haven’t I...” He thought about that and realized that he actually did bring up Cas every single time. “Shit.”
Dean barks a laugh, kissing Cas on the side of his face. “Yeah... I think I crossed that ‘yes homo’ line a few weeks ago, but it’s fine. I’d be homo for you any day.”
He stifled his laugh by clamping his teeth on Cas’ chest. “Dramatic, much?” But the truth was that Dean felt the same. It was a tangible thing, his need for Cas. It sat in his core like a neutron star, dense and powerful and bright, the remnants of a fucking supernova.
The only problem with reaching the finish line is just that — it’s the finish line, and he doesn’t want Cas to be finished with him yet. He needs more... so much more. “Cas... fuck...”
“Shh,” Cas says, kissing gently over the same spot. “Spread your legs for me, Dean.” Dean bites his lips and spreads his legs, embarrassed when his body starts to tremble. “Hey, hey...” Cas keeps kissing him gently all over his thighs. “We don’t have to do this if you’re not ready, Dean. I’d wait forever.”
He laughed and glanced up at the ceiling like he was trying to do math. “I think... maybe two fun sized bags of Skittles?”
“First time you’re gonna see my dick and it’s not even hard. Ugh, fine, but only because I’m impressed with how big-of-a load you just dragged outta me,” Dean laughed. “You deserve to see what you did to me.”
Dean set his bag of food down, rolling his eyes when Charlie snatched it up and started eating it. “Better not kill my snacks. Yeah, you’re right, Cas. Charlie, haven’t you learned
Dean paused for a minute, rolling down the window slightly to inhale the fresh smell of spray paint.
“Cas... fuck... I’ll never get over this ass. I love you so fucking much.” Dean speeds up, tempted to ditch the condom all together but the prospect of seeing four flaccid glowing dicks keeps his head in the game, that’s too damn hilarious to pass up.
Dean hauled Eric across the dusty floor to the entrance of the bay where they set up and carefully looked around the corner, trying to see if Cas was ready.
“The argument we had about which fast food joint has the best fries? Because you’re entitled to your
“We can. But I kinda want see all their faces when we tell them.” Dean grins, kissing Cas three more times and then down his face to his neck.
Dean grins, come dripping down his lip, and it’s so beautiful it physically hurts. He licks some of it up and leans in for another kiss, pinning Cas on his lap as he fucks into him hard. “Fuck... I’m…comin’!” Dean whimpers into Cas’ mouth as he comes and Cas regrets the condom.
Castiel didn’t have family. Well, technically that isn’t true, he had a family. A very religious family that disowned him after he was fucked by his high school math teacher for an
gotten off just from blowing him, or the fact that Carmen wouldn't even be involved next time. He wouldn't be able to lie to himself and say he was doing it just to turn her on, he'd have to admit that he actually, seriously wanted to get his dick sucked by a dude. By
Cas tossed his head back, baring his neck to Dean. “No. these lips are yours. This ass is yours. All yours.” Cas started to move faster, his cock throbbing between them.
Dean shrugged, looking nervous again. “Not bad, just glad I had a chance to shower first.” He laughed a little and pulled off his jacket. “But uh... I dunno. Should we talk about this? I never really found a way to tell Carmen...”
“Bossy, hmm?” Cas grabbed his backpack and walked over to the couch, sitting with a plop. “All yours.”
“What’s wrong with tequila?” Dean asked with an amused expression, he was even more intrigued when Cas actually blushed.
Cas laughed out loud and struggled against the man’s grip only a second to see how sound it was, and
It didn’t take long for Dean to get fully hard and soon Cas could tell he was actually enjoying it. Dean gripped his hair a little harder, moaning as he rolled his hips underneath him. “Feels good, angel.”
Cas grinned and walked over to kiss Dean. “Hey, you asked for it baby. Want a tongue massage?” Cas licked Dean’s ear to mess with him.
“You’re fine. I invited you over.” But he smiled. “You’re very cautious since you touched my ass, though I appreciate it, you can relax around me. I won’t freak out okay? I’m very vocal about the things I’m not okay with, so you don’t have to walk on eggshells, I will tell you if any lines are crossed.”
Cas’ smile was infectious and Dean couldn’t stop himself from returning it. He turned his gaze back on the open road in front of them and had to laugh. “Who knows, maybe the cops will give us a break for doing the world a favor.”
Cas decided to go for it and slipped a hand down his pajamas to stroke himself lazily. He pictured the hot chicks at school, hardly getting a chub as he visualized their skirts. He nearly gave up when his mind - without warning - pictured Dean. Suddenly, his cock was at full mast and leaking inside his fist.
The command had Dean’s dick pulsing and leaking as he bit down on Cas’ neck, then sucked a bruise he knew would leave a mark. He let out a whimper and joined his hand with a Cas’, stroking them both and making sure Cas didn’t stop this time. “Gonna come all over my dick, baby?”
you.” Cas put the blade to David’s chest and slid it across his sternum, getting hard as the blood spilled down his torso. “Beautiful. You know, I pictured this while you told me about your boring accounting job. Pictured you just... like... this.” He slid a finger across the blood, acting as if he couldn’t hear David’s whines.
Castiel shushed him and gripped his hips. “Relax... let me take care of you this time baby.” His voice was low and deep from arousal.
Cas nodded and went back to eat his breakfast. Dean was everything he needed, maybe the world wouldn’t understand what they had, but
“Fuck.” Cas pushes him back down, licking and kissing just about every inch of Dean’s face he can get to — so much that it’s obvious Cas wasn’t
just see their baby brother. Trust me, I know this is a shit hand but it’s the only way. If Cas chooses detox I’ll foot the bill.”
Cas shivered and followed Dean to his beautiful black Impala and watched him climb inside. As soon as he closed the door behind him, he instantly reached for Dean like a fiend. “Just a taste. Need that cock.”
“I know it is… but there were a lot of expressions you could have used. And you chose to call me pretty.”
“By like four months, assbutt!” Cas shoves him playfully and walks back to his drink. “If it makes you feel better, we’ll share the bed. It’s a California King, there’s plenty of room.” He blushes slightly behind his drink and Dean pretends that idea doesn’t make him nervous.
His mind wandered the entire time, mainly to Dean. His eyes, the way his mouth looked when he - well, all the time. Smiles, frowns, when he bit his lip… Dean Winchester decidedly had one of the hottest mouths Cas had ever seen, and his dick twitched at the thought of being inside of it. But, it had been just about two full weeks since the quarantine had begun and they still hadn’t touched each other despite showering together and a few passing shoves. He was antsy, he didn’t like being cooped up and he didn’t like being in such close proximity with something - or some
He was suddenly acutely aware of the fact that they hadn’t seen, touched or kissed each other since Sunday evening and he needed
Cas dresses in a daze, thinking about how cold Dean must be without a shirt. He brings him one from the backpack he set near the door, and when he walks into the hospital he’s directed to a waiting room where he sits for hours.
Cas frowned, looking around the bar and the few people near them. They all turned to watch Dean’s little scene and Cas didn’t want anymore attention drawn to them. “Outside.” He turned and went by Baby to wait for Dean.
At home, it was just him and his dad, John. Their mom passed away giving birth to his baby brother, and unfortunately, he didn’t make it either. Dean hardly had any memories of her since he was only five at the time. But, he remembered a few things… PB&J without the crust, the tune of a lullaby that he’d never remember the words to, and the phrase she said to him every night: ‘Angels are watching over you.’
He moaned and leaned forward, finding a good pace as his cock bounced against Dean’s stomach. “I’ll never get enough.” Cas gripped Dean’s chest, his nails digging into the skin.
Cas closed his eyes and bit his lip. “Fuck... say it again.” He caged Dean against the wall and rutted their cocks together.
Too many people were surprised at how boring Cas actually was when he’s not bantering or partying. He would rather just draw with some music for hours or sit with the old man around the corner and just stare at his garden. Some of his best drawings happened in that garden and Tuesday, never pressured him to talk. Cas never even asked his real name, he called him that, because every Tuesday, he would struggle to walk to the market for some fresh fruit and now that Cas was sober and awake in the daylight, he started going for him each week.
Nick was still frowning, “Why would you do that for him?” Dean can see Nick’s face soften, “Because something
take his eyes off Cas. The blue in his eyes is nearly overtaken with black pupils, and how badly he needs this is clear as day on his face. “I got you... c’mere... gonna come —Cas!”
Castiel laughed. He felt closer to this stranger than he had to any human before in his life and they knew
He would leave and not come back for months, if he came back at all. And why would he? Cas was just a whore, and with a personality as strong as Dean’s… his devil could have anyone. He could barely stand to be around himself most of the time, how could he ever expect anyone -
Dean met him in there as he was finishing up and told Cas he was going to get cleaned up, so Cas nodded and went back to the main room.
His hand absentmindedly reached for the spot where Cas’ head had been and felt nothing but dry skin, which made him frown. How long had he been out? He got up and dressed in a hurry, hastily packing the rest of his things and returning the pull-out bed to its original state. He gave the room a cursory glance and after confirming he had all of his belongings and he was leaving Cas’ office more or less in the state that he found it, he slung his bag over his shoulder and made his way downstairs.
“Strugglin’ a little there, grower?” Dean rushes out of his pants and has to do the same to get it hard, no way these condoms will stay on a soft cock. “Fuck... we’re gonna have to have time-outs to wank it. Gotta keep these battle ready.”
thrusted into Cas’ stretched out hole. He moaned, irritated for the first time that the condom wrapped around him was muting this experience. He didn’t give his angel a chance to adjust before snapping his hips, bringing his other hand up to fist in Cas’ hair and pull his head back. “Be a good boy and take it, and
Dean slid his fingers deep, twisting them as he bent over to lick the broken skin on Cas’ back. He bit him again, hard enough to draw blood. He moved his hand, using his body weight to keep Cas pinned down as he reached below him and curled his fingers around Cas’ throbbing cock. “You want me to fuck you, angel? I want you to paint my pretty car white first.” Dean hit his prostate again and twisted his hand
At school, sometimes Dean was sure Cas was avoiding him. But he never could avoid him during class so Dean would take that as an opportunity to get to know him. He’d start a conversation about anything and everything, and Cas would always oblige, but when they saw each other in the hallway or at lunch, Cas would only offer Dean a simple wave.
too full and exhausted to have sex.They may not have had the energy to go all the way, but they sure found the energy for some toe curling blowjobs and soon they were laying in bed, completely sated with their eyes closed.
Cas was tempted to deny Dean but couldn’t. His ass was a fucking wonderland and Cas never wanted to leave it. He fucked into Dean, chasing his own release but making sure to hit his prostate with every
He'd have dropped his phone again if he wasn't clutching it so damn tightly already. That sounded stupidly, unbelievably hot, and he already knew he'd be actually taking that shower now just to rub one out at the thought.
“We should do it every day then.” He chews his lip, rutting up into Cas as his gaze darts from Cas’ eyes to his lips over and over.
He didn’t say a word as he closed and locked the door behind him, biting his lip to keep himself from saying
Unfortunately, that annoyed his current partner. Michael moved to stand and leaned down, biting Cas’ hip hard enough to leave a mark. “Fuck!” Cas groaned, the spell with Dean broken as he finally looked down at Michael.
Cas faced Dean. “What took you so long?” He asked, turning his face away again to take a drink of coffee.
The contact makes him flinch, but the compliments help him recover, and Dean finds himself pushing down to search for more. “All yours... stuck with me forever now, Cas.”
“Wow…” Meg paused. “I would take a photo if I cared just a little bit more.” She was teasing, but Cas could hear she was surprised at how relaxed he was in Dean’s arms.
“Um… no, I thought we'd take today off. Would you rather… hunt?” Sam asks, flicking his eyes to Cas.
“Yeah... same.” He chuckled and turned to face Dean for the first time, sliding the hood off his head. “Hungry?”
Cas grunted something Dean couldn’t understand as he came harder than he had in months - since his last time with Dean. Only
Cas chuckled and shrugged. “You can’t give good head if you don’t enjoy giving head. It’s impossible. She dumped him after I told her.”
Cas had to reach down and palm himself. He wondered if Dean had the chance to see his cock yet, and decided now was as good a time as any. He slid his pants down, his cock bouncing free, as he gazed into Dean’s gorgeous green eyes.
The following day, Castiel canceled his online lecture and used a sick day which made him feel even lower than before. He felt as though he was failing his students.
It was a narrow studio with relatively bare walls, just a Zeppelin poster on the wall near his bed and a piece of art that looked like blood, on the wall behind his small black couch. He had a small tv on a stand and a black coffee table with an old Apple laptop he stole years ago. The kitchen was tiny but everything worked, and he kept it pretty clean.
Dean left town before the sun came up. If Cas didn’t want him, fine, he’d always been better off on his own. Part of him thought that letting Cas live was a mistake, but in the end, it’s not like Cas knew who he
He doesn’t have to specify, Cas knows what he means. “Of course. And whatever the damage is… you’ll get through it. In the meantime… take my bed.”
The cop got a dangerously lusty look in his eyes. “Well, I guess I’ll just have to take a little look-see then, hmm? Step out of the vehicle.”
Jesse turned out to be a regular dude. Castiel almost struggled with how to act. He was so used to it being just him and Dean that he almost forgot he should have a filter. He was glad Dean reminded him that he didn’t want to kill innocent people. Jesse didn’t deserve to die, even if he
“He saved me. I was being beaten and raped daily by my... pimp.” Cas looked away as if he was about to cry.
Cas spotted a man in a red flannel across the bar and couldn’t help but wonder what was in his jeans. He felt a thrill at the thought of
Dean’s hand freezes and he looks up to gauge how serious Cas is. “Like here? And what? Not jack off until we go in the room or somethin’?”
Dean resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "Get down on your knees. Hands behind your head. Drop the cans." He motioned to Nick, "I've got your photo already."
many people? How would he know he’s sexually attracted to something unless he’s fucked that type of person?”
He tossed and turned on his bed for a while before giving up on sleep, pulling on a pair of pajama pants and heading downstairs.
I don’t exactly have a choice, but I…” the smell of sex was so strong coming off the blue-eyed man that Dean temporarily couldn’t focus. “Benny! Where the hell’s my room?”
“Yeah... we can do that again sometime... if you wanted.” He chuckles and buries his face in Cas’ hair. “Cause I sure do.”
The pie burns because the second Dean walks through his door Cas jumps on him and ends up riding him on his living room floor. Deep down, Cas knows it doesn’t get better than this, and based on Dean’s after orgasm glow, he knows it too.
He’s answered with a slight nod, then Cas takes him all the way in, gagging slightly around the intrusion. His hips jerk like he’s nearly there himself.
Instead, Nick laughed out loud. “He said I was disturbing his shower and that he was about to jack off, thinking of
Dean smirked and continued washing while Nick laughed and poked fun at Cas. The wall, once stripped clean of dirt, mud, and old stone, was a decent canvas. Dean set the washer down and grinned, "Perfect. You think?”
“Having fun?” Cas asked, sipping from his cup. He had glanced at Dean a few times that night and was still getting some major top vibes. It was very confusing. He’d also notice Dean deny every top that came his way, was he just a picky bottom? Cas had always been pretty picky, so he could understand that.
Dean is writhing, gripping the sheets as though his life depends on it, like without them he might float away.
As Cas got things started in the kitchen, Dean cleaned himself up a little in the bathroom and met him out there, once more only in sweatpants. The sight of Cas nearly naked and swinging his ass to classic rock as the smell of bacon surrounded him tugged on something primal deep inside of Dean, something that only grew stronger when he caught sight of the hickey he’d left.
He ran a hand through his hair and growled, “Just back the fuck up okay! I’m here, I haven’t had any drugs today, I’m doing what
Carmen grinned. “We can blindfold you, I’ll be there to touch you and kiss you, it’s just... not my mouth. Dean, he gives the best blowjobs. Obviously I’ve never gotten one, but I know people that have and they all say the same thing.”
As soon as Nick followed Castiel’s gaze he ran up behind him, “What are you doing? Let’s go!” He stopped a few feet behind, watching Cas’ every move.
Dean let go of Cas’ throat and dug his nails into his hip as he grunted and came hard, filling up his angel in the middle of the church that was once going to be his murder scene. When he was empty, he pulled Cas’ hand from his throat and gasped for air, his vision spotting. “For fuck’s sake…”
He pushed Cas’ face down deeper into the carpet and then leaned back, digging his nails into the man’s hips as he pulled out and flipped Cas over. He landed with a grunt and Dean thrust back in with a brutal movement. “Look up at the cross, angel. I want Jesus himself to watch what happens next.” Dean’s insides were alight with pleasure, pain, and pure anticipation for the moment Cas gives in. He saw little purple bruises budding over Cas’ skin already from the places his hands have been and he grinned, letting out a moan laced with dark laughter. It was
Cas couldn’t think about anything but the blood and before he realized what he was doing, he pulled off of Dean’s spent cock and licked his wound, staring up at his devil’s reaction. He didn’t hear anyone enter the bathroom, all he could hear, see, taste and breathe, was
okay with the blood, would Dean have killed him months ago? Or would Dean kill him tomorrow if he decided he wasn’t on board for one of his kinks? Would he just get bored one day and kill him? Did he even care about Castiel? Dean carved his initials into Cas’ chest and he still had no idea what Dean’s last name even was. Was
Cas laughed and finished his initials and moved to the other side, his tongue poking out of his mouth as he drew a halo on the other side. “Now your angel is always with you.”
Cas’ hushed laugh woke him up slightly, but Dean couldn’t remember what he said. “Sure, Dean. Get some sleep.”
“Got it! It’s to the left guys.” Cole called down and then started his descent. “Knew I’d figure it out.” He landed with a thud and grinned.
Dean followed his target out of the strip club they’d been at just off the highway with his hands in his pockets and his hood over his head. He stayed a few paces behind the man until they were safely in the darker part of the parking lot, and then he pounced, knocking him out. Cas had been on standby and already had the Impala’s trunk open. He quickly helped Dean get the man into the trunk and slammed it as Dean double checked their surroundings and got back in the car, driving away from the strip club as a savage grin spread across his face.
Cas huffed a laugh and lined up with Dean’s hole. “In that case, I’ll make this quick.” Cas pushed inside, not stopping until he was completely bottomed out. He reached forward and gripped Dean’s shoulder, the new position allowing his cock to push right on Dean’s sweet spot.
“Shit... mark me, Cas.” Dean grips his sheets and spreads further. “I swear I’ve never been more excited for a blowjob in my entire life... did I just say that out loud?”
When they finally got back to Dean’s, Castiel was completely flustered. “Jesus Dean, I can’t fucking breath with you up my ass! Can we get some damn lube at least?!”
Dean froze, his arms locking around Cas’ back as the enormity of those words sank into his toes. They’d never said it, it wasn’t like Dean hadn’t known he loved Cas, or that Cas loved him, but they’d never
yeah, we should try these on. Naked? Think we got at least... twenty minutes for a dicksaber battle before they get outta class.”
Dean did a gallic shrug hoping to get a smile out of Cas and was pleased to see those plump lips twitch slightly. “You mentioned keeping me busy?” Cas glanced at Dean’s mouth and Dean laughed for the first time all day.
Cas tilted his head at Dean. “He call the cops or he just call you? And it wasn’t a binge, I just lost count.”
His smile went on for days. “Perfect, huh? Well, I think you’re crazy, but I’ll take it.” It took a ridiculous amount of effort to stop smiling long enough to kiss him again, this time, climbing over into Cas’ lap.
what was so hot about it.” Cas was actually excited to hear Dean’s perspective on his first kill, he hadn’t said much about that night yet.
Cas grabbed the paper and looked it over. “Well shit…” He set it down and scratched his head. “Really though? My best feature isn’t my mouth?”
“You said my name. Not really anonymous anymore, handsome.” Cas grinned and grabbed some toilet paper to clean off his hand and the mess he made on the wall.
“If he’s mixing a downer and an upper, it doesn’t sound like he wants to be around long. Specifically
“I can tell.” Cas slid inside more. “This ass is heaven, Dean. I hope you weren’t planning on a marathon.” He moved in and out slowly as he worked him open.
On the other side of the room, Dean is determined to slap Cas’ ass with his cock and he refuses to give up. “C’mon, Cas, how are you so fast?”
“Fuck... say my name again, Cas.” He’s so into it he doesn’t even think before speaking, and truthfully, he wouldn’t be able to control his mouth if he tried.
Dean adjusted his weight and grinned like an idiot, shoving his shorts down and gripping his cock. “She never said it could only be once a week. You want it every day, take it every day.”
Cas dried off and then tossed the towel to straddle Dean, their spent cocks sitting heavily on Dean’s belly as he slid the blade around, watching Dean’s skin dance. “You
bullshit. You think I didn’t know that eye you drew on that wall was mine? How many hours did that take you, huh? How much sleep did you lose over it?” Dean paced, rubbing his face. He wasn’t ready to have this conversation, but he knew if he didn’t do something, Cas would never understand how much he’s really worth. “I cared about you before I even knew you had a habit
Dean sucks in a sharp intake of breath, and he knows Cas felt his dick give permission before his voice could. “Y-yeah... hell yeah, Cas.”
It worked out for them, but meeting the two closest people to Dean was intimidating. What if they thought he was weird or didn’t get his dry humor?
“Me too, don’t stop.” Cas was breathing hard and the mere thought that Cas was just as turned on as he was, had Dean racing to the finish line. “Dean… come with me. Gonna… fuck!”
Cas pulled off, stroking him painfully slow. “Yes, Dean. You may come.” He swallowed him down again and started that magical pace that had Dean right at the edge in seconds.
Staring at the ceiling, Cas thought about the last few days with Meg and decided he definitely went too far.
Dean was worried this would happen. Cas was either hallucinating or about to have a night terror and Dean wasn’t sure which would be worse for him menatally. He reached out to move Cas’ hair off his clammy forehead and sighed. Dean wasn’t sure why, but he began to hum a lullaby his mom used to sing him and play with Cas’ unruly hair.
it was off but when he realized it was Dean, he froze and the tall man - named Nick - stood up. “Wasn’t taken a moment before. Why don’t you let him choose for himself?”
Change of plans… Cas looked me dead in my eyes and bit one in half. And just like that, my rocket is no longer ready for take off.
Cas shrugged and laid his head back on Baby’s hood. “I don’t know. I mean I hoped we’d end up close.”
Cas thought he sensed a hint of defiance in Dean’s voice, like he was playing defense instead of answering an honest question. A stupid question, he was well aware, but an honest one. “Good for you. Guess that means you’ll be joining again?” In that moment, he wasn’t sure what answer he actually wanted to hear.
He shoves him off with a growl and smacks Dean’s lips with his cock, smearing the leaking precome. “There's your taste. Go get on all fours.”
Dean nearly trips as he turns down her hallway, and once they’re finally alone, he kicks the door closed and sets him down. “Now I’m torn between fucking you in this hot ass costume, and — never mind, I need to see all of you.”
a fuck. So, why did it feel so different? Whether Cas shed a tear or not was his own business. But his drive back to his shitty studio on the second floor was a silent one. He didn’t even look in the mirror when he got home, just collapsed on his bed and slept for well over a day.
to. “I honest to fuck thought maybe I dropped them at the laundromat and was about to have to go back and ask the lady if anyone had seen my boyfriend’s fucking panties.” He shook his head, his grin widening until he actually laughed. “I can gut someone with my bare hands, but god forbid I do something normal.”
Dean watched him go but didn't follow this time, joking around with Nick and the others. Dean never treated people differently because they had a record, hell, if he made slightly different choices he would be right here with them.
Dean sighed, “Look, I sent a photo of his mural around to some local businesses and a few are interested. I just want to pass on the information. do you know where he is?” Nick stared for a few seconds.
Dean pulled out the second Cas came, still hard. He tucked his throbbing cock back into his jeans and buttoned them before walking to the sink to wash his hands. “Clean yourself up, you look like you just got raped in a diner bathroom.”
“Y yo a ti, Cas.” Dean chuckles, and nips Cas’ bottom lip. “See, online Spanish is stickin’ around.”
Cas may have been fucked out, but he still wanted to please Dean, so he slid out and rolled him onto his back, and slid his hard cock into his throat.
“No, but your partner is, and that’s what matters here.” She winks, then grabs her laptop bag and backpedals toward the door. “See you tomorrow night, Buck.”
but there was nothing to hold. When Dean called him angel it sent a chill up his spine and he realized he fucking
Dean’s chest flushed in response, causing each and every freckle on his body to stand out in stark contrast. Cas’ fingers played connect-the-dots over them and Dean couldn’t do anything but watch. As incredible as he found touching Cas, feeling Cas’ hands on
That wasn't what Dean meant, but he'd already kept Cas way longer than he should've and had no idea what kinda lines he crossed just by taking the blindfold off in the first place. "Least I can do, your mouth deserves a reward. See you... uh... Sunday?"
“Nothing, Dean here is friends with the owner so we got a deal. I’m just proud of you for earning some legit money, motivated me to find a real job too, so this is our little celebration. I start on Monday.”
sound, slapping a heavy hand on Charlie’s poor hood. “Man, just made my whole day, see you guys in class.” He winked at Cas and walked away as the bell rang.
“Absolutely, 100% yes. Goddamnit you’re perfect.” Dean trembles and kisses his neck, not ready to pull out. Football... nachos... the damn president... everything else can wait.
“Well, we could have another quicky… if you wanted.” The man said nervously, Cas stared at him for a moment, trying to remember his name. He had a Scottish accent which makes sense, that always made Cas weak in the knees.
“Jealous, Dean? Maybe you should ask me yourself next time, before someone else does.” Cas tilted his head at the pissed off expression on Dean’s face. “Come on, Dean. Don’t be Ron Weasley, I’m not particularly fond of
Dean leaned down to kiss him as he followed, choking back a sob and thrusting weakly. It hit him all at once, this was over...
Dean grabbed a pair of clean shorts from Cas' bag and made a mental note that they needed to do laundry again. He gave Cas quiet, whispered instructions as he slid the shorts onto his angel's body and then he turned around, scratching the back of his head. He was grasping at straws and didn't know what else to do, but he was thirsty so he figured Cas might be too. He grabbed them each a Gatorade and went back to the bed. “Orange, right?”
Balt nodded, looking completely unsurprised. “This isn’t exactly a new occurrence, darling. What’ve we done this time?”
“Keep talkin’ like that and you’re gonna have to stay in here... forever,” he jokes, his eyes closing of their own accord.
Cas groaned and continued staring into Dean’s eyes as he milked him. After Dean was completely empty and over sensitive, he pulled off and fixed Dean’s pants. “What did you have in mind?”
Cas groaned as Dean filled him up and his legs shook when he turned around. He whimpered at the loss of Dean’s cock but his mouth instantly helped.
Dean stood over him and touched his chin. “You thought I would show you?” He laughed humorlessly. “No. You will learn all on your own.” He gripped tighter and brought Cas’ gaze up to meet his eyes. “And I will not fuck you, even one minute sooner.”
“Ol’ fashioned fun. Means no cryin’ when I kick your Hulky ass.” Dean takes his stance and nudges Lisa playfully. “You bring your A game? I’m not above askin’ for a sub.”
“There’s that smile again, except it’s so much worse. Who is texting you Dean?” Sam reached for his phone but Dean was too fast.
Dean pulled off his clothes and Cas eyed his beautiful, long, thick cock as Dean lubed himself up. Cas’ mouth watered and he arched his back with a groan. Dean reached in and pulled out the plug, tossing it on the floor with a clatter. He climbed over Cas and stared down. “You’ve been so good. I will not tell you when to come. I want to see you naturally rip apart at the seams for me. Understand?”
He laid down next to Dean, not bothering with clothes yet. “We should find you one too, baby. We could set them up together and both have one to play with before we skip town.”
attractive. His plump bottom lip was trapped between his teeth and his eyes were closed, but he looked so… blissed the fuck out. Like the guy was having the time of his life spearing himself on Benny’s cock and jackin’ two others off at the same time. Dean was half hard in his jeans just from the sight.
Though that doesn't sound right, Cas isn't going to complain. He steps away to finish getting ready, then kisses him again before they get in the car and head over to Charlie’s. “Is it rude of me that I'm excited to see Lisa’s face?”
They’re sitting there as usual, watching some old black-and-white movie with their phones in their hands, and Dean is already hardening before he can even get the words out. “Hey, Cas... you uh... wanna do that thing again?”
Dean barely caught his footing, but when he did he lifted his palms in surrender. Something like hurt flashed across his face, which only served to piss Cas off even more. Dean swallowed. "C'mon, Cas. It's me, okay? I won't touch you if you don't want me to, you know that. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have grabbed you. I just don't want you walking around outside, okay? Can you just come back inside? I'll talk to Benny, this was just a misunderstanding, right?"
“Thanks?” Cas asked, with a tilt of his head. “Did you come just to see it?” Licking his lips, Cas smiled for the first time all day.
Dean kept eating, wondering why the hell this conversation felt so natural. “Nope, notta once.” He shrugged, licking some ketchup from the corner of his mouth. “Like you said... vanilla.”
The man punched Cas, instantly putting him in defense mode. The fight was not pretty. David had jumped to cower on the side while Cas and this man he didn’t even know knocked over at least three tables. It took three strangers to break them apart and toss them outside. Cas disappeared in an alley before the police showed up.
He should have gotten into his car and drove home. But instead, he sat back down with a grunt, thinking of everything that had just happened and everything he allowed this
“Come with me… oh, Dean!” His hand tightens seconds before he releases and Dean immediately follows.
fun, but I had a sure thing at the bar.” He knocked on the table, “See ya around, pretty.” Cas turned and walked back to his spot at the bar, only then did Dean notice the man next to Cas.
Cas palmed himself and huffed a laugh, “Come on.” He held out his hand and Dean took it, happily. “I promised you pancakes.”
Castiel looked over and caught Dean’s eyes on him, refusing to break their gaze first as they both got their cocks sucked.
got hard for you.” He bit down, sucking a dark bruise into the side of Cas’ throat. “I can’t blame him, I thought I was gonna come in my damn pants watching you make him bleed.”
She motioned over to where Cas is standing with a girl Dean believes is Meg but isn’t completely sure and a few other guys. Cas was laughing at something, looking completely carefree and genuinely happy. Dean had to admit, “No, he doesn’t.” Running a hand down his face, Dean continues, “But that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t try. He may not realize he has a problem yet but he does, his own
Cas draped himself over Dean, wrapping his broad hand around Dean’s neck and pulling him into a kiss as he thrust in, deep and brutal. Dean’s body was jerking each time, making it hard to hold that kiss and Cas eventually gave up, biting his shoulder instead.
He could feel his orgasm looming, but the quiet pleas and whimpers coming from Cas were so intoxicating that he couldn’t bring himself to stop. Dean could feel Cas’ pace quickening rapidly, and his own sped up in response.
got louder before a kill. He leaned almost bored against the hood of his car as he waited for Castiel to arrive.
He isn’t alone… not really. He can feel Cas all around him and he has his words — in his own writing — against his chest. It takes a while for him to open the letter and he does it so, so tentatively that it takes longer than it should have, but it feels like a bomb that would blow if he was too rough.
When Cas pulled off, Dean dropped back to lay on the bed, breathing heavily. “Fuck. Yeah, you can do that any goddamn time you want.”
He wanted to stall, but the sirens were audible now. They were still a ways off, but growing louder by the second. “Time’s up, angel.” His heart jumped into his throat and he had to force himself to keep his eyes open. As bad as he was dreading watching Cas’ light go out, he owed it to him not to look away.
Once they were processed and fingerprinted they were put in a holding cell. "You're going to get us fucking killed one of these days with your goddamned mouth. Sit the fuck down." Nick yanked him down and lectured him until they were approached by an Officer Smith.
Cas stared at him a moment, wondering how much he should say, but before he could stop himself, he blurted it out. Deep down, he knew Balt would never tell a soul. “I let a friend’s boyfriend fuck me... and the friend doesn’t know.”
"Yeah, well I warned you when I first met you, they're assholes." Dean forced his eyes away from Castiel’s. "Beautiful color choices. Where was the inspiration from?"
“Cause I definitely should’ve done this before you left my house, and I don’t really want an audience.” Dean leaned in slowly, tilting his head down to compensate for the slight height difference. Suddenly nervous, he stopped right before his lips met Cas’ and grinned. “Cause... y’know.
He greedily kissed him back, whining quietly at the sudden and complete stretch. Dean’s legs wrapped around Cas’ ass and pulled him deeper as he squeezed his eyes shut, eager to get past the brief pain and to the part that felt so fucking good he’d be seeing stars. “Haven’t been with anyone in awhile.”
Cas made a pleased hum into Dean’s ear. “Good. Don’t move.” Cas bit the back of his neck and started kissing his way down Dean’s back.
“Nope. Love my cock too much for that. You made it real hard to sneak out now.” He chuckled and fixed his jeans.
With one long shared look, all of her questions are answered. They’re happy, happier than most couples she sees on a daily basis, and if they’ve made it this far and still look at each other like that… well they’ve got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Something in Cas’ gut told him not to go. But he shrugged it off, because maybe Cas wanted something to happen. Maybe this... was
Cas played the victim role, using David’s compassion against him and after sitting and talking for a bit, David offered
“I didn’t have a charger. Stop, m’fine.” Dean sets his dog down and tosses his backpack, staring down at them with a frown. “This is all I got, Cas. Everything’s gone.”
“Oh f— that— Cas!” Dean comes with a whimper, his body trembling as he adds to the mess in white spurts. Cas doesn’t stop until they’re both twitching from being oversensitive.
“Why’s it always about sex with you Novak’s? No, we haven’t yet.” Dean’s eyes widened at his use of the word
“Of course. Can’t go a day without seeing that face.” Cas grinned innocently, happy his wrists were covered so Alec wouldn’t ask questions. He got a free coffee,
Setting the bottle down, Cas walks closer and takes his hand. “We aren’t talking about those people. You’re allowed to feel however you feel. Don’t compare your suffering to others.”
Cordelia reviews her notes, shuffling through them until she finds the page she’s searching for, and then looks back up at Cas and Dean while closing the folder and placing it to the side. “Friends? That’s lovely. A lot of the best relationships come out of friendships because we’re already so aware of our partner’s experiences, and obviously we already have a foundation of care and respect to build on.” She smiles at Dean before speaking again. “So, Dean, how do you get along with Castiel’s parents?” she asks, an eyebrow slightly raised.
is Dean’s voice. Dean cups his chin and places a soft kiss to Cas’ lips, but it ends quickly because he is still smiling. Before Cas can ask why he is smiling, Dean tells him. “I’ve been waiting for you.”
A number flashed across the screen and Dean was tempted to call in a false tip, but knew it would be an unnecessary risk. He stepped forward to pay for his gas with his head down.
you until we are ready. I never once said I wouldn’t bend you over this couch right now and fuck you so hard you forget your own name.”
Cas looked around, “Uhh... shit, we just passed it. Turn around and make a left on the first street.”
alone. The only time he’d allowed himself to speak to her he’d found out she’d just moved to Lawrence, Kansas, and her family was still back east. She had no friends, she worked from home...
Cas leaned over to grab it and pulled off his pajamas, but Dean didn’t miss the lacy little number he had on underneath. “You... want me to go prep? Or do you want to watch?”
“Three... you got it. But I will have to request some pie for afterwards. Should I just... bring a bag... and stay the night?”
“Shit! Cas...” Dean scratches down his back and lifts his knees higher. One of Cas’ hands slides down his thigh and lifts it up, and the shift drives him a little deeper. It’s almost agonizingly slow, the way he takes him. Cas kisses him gently and trails his lips across Dean’s jaw.
“Ah fu— Cas... so fuckin’ good.” Gripping the steering wheel, Dean moans, his legs squirming under Cas.
“Hey!” Dean pointed at him from across the room. “Don’t you use Pink Floyd to insult me like that, I’ll glue Balt’s guitar to my body and play the entirety of
Dean shut the water off, choosing to ignore the fact that they’d never taken a more conventionally pointless shower. He stepped out and handed Cas a towel, then dried himself off a little before laying that same towel across the bed. He grabbed the blade, and when Cas joined him, he handed it to him. “I should have let you do this sooner.” Dean layed down on the bed, his eyes glued to his angel.
Dean lets him lead until the cool air hits their cheeks and then he tugs him in the direction of his Impala. As much as he normally loves showing her off and watching people’s expressions when they first meet his car, it isn’t even a blip on his radar at this moment. He unlocks her and tugs the backseat door open, grabbing Cas’ ass while he kneels inside.
The weekend with Dean was absolutely the best weekend Cas had had in a long time. He planned on staying one night, but when Saturday evening rolled around, they still couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Dean gave Cas some clothes to wear after a steamy shower together, and Cas ended up staying until the very last minute on Sunday. They both had work in the morning, and neither were ready to say goodbye, but Cas forced himself to walk out the door.
Dean blinked in surprise. “That’s not a half bad idea, actually.” He gave directions to the church and told Cas to park in the hotel parking lot just down the street.
Dean didn’t miss the nerves radiating off his boyfriend and nodded. “We can watch a movie or somethin’?”
“If you want my beanie, it’s yours. I run hot.” Dean pulled off his beanie and put it on Cas’ head for him. “There. Your nose is still pink though.” He tapped it and took a step back.
”Hm. I think I can handle that.” Dean got out of the car and went inside the lobby, checking in with cash as Cas gathered the bags from the trunk. They met back up at the car and Dean led them into the little room that smelled faintly of stale cigarette smoke. He locked the door behind them and pulled one of the knives from his bag, setting it down on the table by the bed. It was a habit that he’d gotten into a long time ago, it was just better to have a weapon close. He slept better. He turned after, closing the distance between himself and Cas and kissing him hard, his tongue sweeping past Cas’ teeth and licking into his mouth. He pulled back enough to speak. “You wanna know what I thought was so hot about it? I think it was your eyes. That wild, crazy
“It’s not actually broken, I just didn’t want to drive, so I lied.” Meg turned the volume up and started singing
He hit send, then when Carmen quit giving him that 'what are you up to' look and turned away, he looked back at the screen and was mortified by the typos.
gotten and he wasn’t going to last long. He didn’t grab Dean’s head like he wanted to, instead he let Dean keep control and when he looked at the blood Dean smeared on his thighs, he knew he was close. “Fuck, Dean, gonna come. Fuck… fuck.”
Dean sighed quietly but got into the car. “Fine. You’re lucky you’re cute.” He reversed the car and then got on the road.
Castiel opened the door and walked up to the closest people in his life. Benny was another, but there were things even he didn’t know about Cas that these two did. As he approached them, he could tell Meg was explaining why she called him Clarence. “... and he refuses to watch the movie.”
Dean smiled, running his hand through Cas’ hair as he slid into his open, eager mouth. He groaned when Cas’ hot, wet tongue flicked over the sensitive skin of his cockhead and pushed in deeper.
"Am I allowed to? I didn't stick around last year to find out what happens after." Cas reaches up to brush Dean's cheek with his finger. "I'll stay as long as you'll let me."
Dean didn’t know exactly what that meant, but he fucked Cas slow and deep, kissing him to swallow his moans. His pace sped up after a moment until the force of him fucking into Cas made it hard to hold the kiss, so he pulled back and lifted one of Cas’ legs.
move on and after a few months, Sam’s stories are repeats, but Castiel doesn’t care. He still listens, still hangs on to every word because
Cas stayed still for a bit before he decided to get a little bratty, he pushed back onto Dean’s fingers, which made Dean smack Cas’ ass hard with his palm. “Coulda sworn I told you to stay
One of the men was instantly interested in Cas’ company, so he made himself comfortable and started friendly conversation. He wasn’t in the mood, but he could fake it for a bit while Dean got to work. The bar was filled with mostly men so there weren’t many purses around for easy targets. Cas hoped Dean could hustle enough money to tide them over.
“Well... how was it?” Cas licked his lips and shamelessly checked Dean out. “Different ball game huh?”
Dean had warned him about how tall he was, but nothing could prepare him for how huge Sam Winchester
“Hmm.” He took another slow, steadying sip of the amber liquid and pulled it through his teeth. “Maybe this time, I’ll just
Cas had seen the man stand and worried he was leaving but then noticed he was heading towards him... wait, no, not him... the jukebox.
“Thank you, baby.” Dean kissed him. “Best present ever is your face.” He kissed all over his face annoyingly until Cas was shoving him back with a huge smile. “Where’s Charlie?”
, giving Dean full access to his amazing body. Cas had beautiful tattoos covering a lot of his torso, and a natural athletic build. He was wearing some gray sweatpants, and his hair was still wet from the shower.
He watched his angel retreat to the bathroom and smiled to himself, following and leaving a trail of clothing in his wake before joining Cas in the shower. “I’m here. Speak.”
Cas closed his eyes and took a breath. He looked around the diner and then back into Dean’s eyes, where he could see that Dean wasn’t joking. It was clear he’d done
So, enter the guinea pig. He’d tossed around different gift ideas, but this stinky little creature seemed to be the perfect fit - it would give Cas something of his own over at Dean’s other than the drawer full of panties and a toothbrush, and it would remind Cas that Dean actually listened to him when he spoke.
To his surprise, Dean looked at him with something that appeared to be compassion, not pity or even disinterest, like he’d expected. “I’m not really claustrophobic, I just can’t stand being still this long. I need to move, y’know? Drive. Go places.” Dean licked his lip and continued, his voice quiet. “You okay?”
David clinked his glass against Castiel’s with a slight nod and set it down without drinking. “You?”
Thank you to everyone who stuck around to the end. This was a harder fic for me to write. Addiction is something I grew up with in my family, so finding that line between talking about it and glamorizing it was hard. It was therapeutic to write about regardless, even though most situations were changed. I hope I did them justice. ❤️
There were few things in life Dean enjoyed more than coming after a bloody kill, despite the added tension of the situation he was currently in. “Okay, okay... fuckin’ hell, Cas.” He pulled him off by the hair and grins, already looking a little dazed. “You gonna ride me now or keep teasin’ me?”
“Those asshats took my idea.” Dean slots between Cas’ legs and kisses him, rutting their glowing cocks together. “You got the hottest green dick in all the land, babe.”
He pulled the back door of the Impala open and shoved Cas in, bending him over the backseat. In a few short movements, Cas’ pants were around his knees and Dean was looking over the roof of the car to make sure no one was watching. When he looked back down, his eyes landed on grey, faded boxer briefs instead of the pretty lace he’d become accustomed to. “What the
Cas didn’t hang David on the meat hook. Instead, he hung his tied hands on it so he couldn’t lower them and cut off his clothes, leaving him completely exposed.
Cas and Meg went to their usual bar tonight after popping an Oxy. It only took Cas a few drinks to feel that familiar warmth throughout his body, that
Fuck them for using his life to make them seem innocent. He suddenly wished he could show up there and scare the fuck out of them. He isn’t sure he could actually kill them, but Dean could. Cas pushed those thoughts aside, there was no time for that.
Dean instantly responds, flipping their positions and lifting Cas up by his thighs. He pulls back to whisper Cas’ name and dives back in, desire and lust vibrating every inch of his skin.
Dean’s moans were sinful, and it was quite obvious he relished the burn. “Fuck yes! Shit... you’re big as hell, Cas... m’so fucking full.”
Within an hour, about seven guys came up to hit on Dean. The attention was nice, but none gave off the vibes he was looking for and he didn’t miss the fact that they all had purple cups.
“Why the fuck are those my only options? Who the fuck put you in charge?” Cas turned to Nick with a betrayed look in his eyes.
“Shhh, angel.” Dean tosses the razor onto the bedside table and leaned down, kissing Cas gently. “You’re mine now. I’ve got you.” He thrusted in again and this time, he didn’t stop.
“I actually will write that down, it’s one of the things I wanted to ask you about. The first was just whether your relationship progressed into something more when you
Dean antsy for a kill and clenching a knife had Cas’ dick hard in seconds. “Fuck... let’s go. We can take the food to go.”
Cas looked back down at the emails and then back at Dean. “Alright, I’ll meet with them. Do you have to be there or can I just go?”
“Cas, c’mon. We can nap, but we gotta move to the bed.” Dean lightly tapped Cas until he felt his angel start to move, then bore most of his weight as he led him to the bed. After some exhausted shuffling. Cas tucked himself into Dean’s side and they curled together, drifting off to sleep.
“Okay.” Dean pulled himself together and slowly rose to his feet, they didn’t have time for him to fall apart. He averted his gaze from Cas as he started to set up, taking the rope from his go-bag and tossing it over each side of the cross.
Cas hoped Dean didn’t notice him physically relaxing at the word ‘friend’. “Oh, I thought that was your girlfriend.”
Cas maneuvered to straddle Dean in his seat. “Yeah? You’re mine now, Dean? Or… I have permission to wear your blood.” Cas didn’t
Alright! Who the fuck told Cas a good way to seduce me was to get honey and assprints on Baby!? He was leaning on the hood like a swimsuit model and his dick was dipped in honey! Haven’t we had this conversation already about friggin honey!? What the hell did my car do to you people!?
Dean’s inner turmoil was cut short when Cas slid his entire length down his throat without a flinch.
Just as Cas opens his mouth to come up with yet another lie, Dean blurts out his truth. “We lied. About all of it. I don’t visit people’s graves... they creep me out and I hate them. We also weren’t friends before... well today, and when I was ten, I stole a candy bar from the corner market and I slipped it into my brother’s pocket when we got caught.” He exhales a deep breath and laughs nervously as he wipes some sweat from his forehead. “I feel better now.”
Dean clenched his asscheeks together because no, he didn’t think he wanted to know what it felt like to have a dick in his ass, but... he was curious. “Tell me.”
He nipped at the curve of Dean’s ass as his own cock throbbed with need, then hastily slicked his fingers and shifted Dean’s panties to the side to expose him. He licked a broad stripe between his cheeks and nudged a single finger in, growling with the frustration of how long this would take.
Before he can even care to wipe off his face, Dean slumps back, his come-slick spent cock still in his loose fist as he catches his breath. “This shit is so much better than porn.”
Dean had suspected as much and even though it sent a jealous spike into his groin, he didn’t comment. “You gonna fuck David?”
“You know what, just for that horrible imitation of my voice, you don’t get the present I got you.” He teased.
Dean smiles and takes another drink. He can’t seem to keep his hands off Cas so he starts playing with his hair. “What if you have a test the next morning and I won’t stop singing Crazy Train in my sleep?”
Online classes are pretty lame, but there’s something about online improv that Dean enjoys. If you ask him, he’s pretty damn awesome at improvising, but he's phenomenal when it’s over a screen. Now they have to actually meet up with a classmate. He’s a little nervous when he types up his partner search ad, but he thinks it’ll be fun.
the fire simmering barely contained under Castiel‘s skin and surfacing at the most surprising times.
Dean shook his head and sat down. “Nah, just can’t sleep. Kinda feels like the walls are closing in, y’know? I want this shit to be over.”
“I dunno, but I’m tellin’ you again. You’re amazing, and so damn good to me. I don’t know how I tricked you into loving me but... I love you so much, Castiel Novak-Winchester.” He grins, proud of himself for saying all that without squeezing in a joke.
The way his giant friend looks as he runs at Dean has him laughing so hard tears are leaking from the corners of his eyes. He knows they probably look absolutely ridiculous, but at least there’s no one else around to see.
Apprehension spiked through Dean’s body as Cas stopped right in front of him, pinning him to the spot with those electric blue eyes. “Shoot.”
“Yup. Always has been. I think that was why he didn’t try to fight me at all. He gave his word.” She shrugged and looked like she had something to say.
to go in - but something had been nagging at him for quite some time now and he needed an internet connection to figure it out. He figured that on his own he might not be as noticeable, so he pulled into the parking lot and shuffled inside, attempting to look as small and non-threatening as possible.
“Cas!” Dean calls from the couch. It’s football Sunday, so he doesn’t want to move until a commercial, but the nachos Cas made are absolutely the best nachos he’s ever had in his life. Therapy may have been a couple years ago, but they’ve still managed to use those skills in their relationship, and after some nachos like these, Castiel deserves some damn praise.
“Mmhm.” Cas smiles softly, threading their fingers together under the table and leaning in to kiss him mid-chorus. “I love you, too.”
“Absolutely,” Cas said without a doubt. “I’ll keep my studio so we have somewhere to lay our heads every so often. I can pay in advance for a few months before we come back.”
I actually like that the body count rises, it makes me feel important.” Cas had never mattered to anyone before and the fact that Dean would kill for him... there weren’t words to describe how
With a growl, Dean pushes inside. “Fu— Cas... so tight.” He can feel every inch of Dean as his cock slowly splits him open, and he honestly doesn’t know how he survived this long without him. He rocks back to take him deeper.
It’s better than anything Dean’s ever felt before and he breaks the kiss to watch. “Cas…” he moans, rutting into his hand and gripping the sheets in pleasure.
Dean had the radio up as loud as he dared in an attempt to drown out the nausea-inducing moans that fucking pig made. There was sweat coating his skin and his tongue was bleeding from biting it so hard, but he finally risked a glance over to Cas and saw him getting to his feet again.
do I want to follow through with this without you knowing the facts.” His fingertips trail lightly down Dean’s thighs as he sucks in a breath. “I love you. Deeply, completely love you.”
would break the silence last week, but that failed as well. Cas decided enough was enough, and walked by, grabbed Dean’s cup and scribbled a quick “I’ll” on the cup before the name and handed it back with a wink.
Dean tilted his head and suggested something he never thought he’d suggest. “Go help him. No strings attached, just... be a good person. Maybe it’ll help.”
“Okay... Whatever it is, I’m here for you, Cas.” Dean reached out a nervous hand, sliding his fingers between Cas’. “Talk to me.”
A handful of people don’t drink — Lisa, Jo, even Benny, but the rest do and seem genuinely happy for them. Cas steals his attention quickly with another deep kiss, then bites his lip as he pulls away. “Which game next?”
He woke up first the next day and got out of bed, making his way towards the bathroom to check out his injuries. He tried not to, but was still limping.
When Dean saw a shadow moving about in the alleyway, he got out of his car to check it out. Secretly hoping it was Cas.
It makes jacking off kind of hard, unless you’re the type of person with a vivid imagination. Cas, of course, isn’t. Just picturing fucking or getting fucked by someone else isn’t enough, he needs to feel it, see it… or, at the very least, it has to have happened recently enough that it’s fresh in his mind. Unfortunately, It’s been so long since he’s been with someone else, felt hot, warm come covering his —
one with a 39 ½ foot pole. The candy project turned out to be much more boring than Dean envisaged, but he let Cas take the reins and watched him step by step. In the end, he still didn’t understand it all, but at least he found his new lab partner.
“No, it wasn't.” Cas is relieved to hear he wasn't the only one that failed to act in there, but he wants to set one thing straight. “I don't need you to be vocal about everything, Dean. Just tell me if I upset you and maybe… don't be shy about the things you like. I don't expect you to tell me every thought that runs through your head. I just want to be able to do the things you like more often, and the things you don't like… less often.”
He ran his hand over the side of Cas’ face and up to fist in his hair, tipping his head back against the wall and closing his eyes, loving every damn second of it. “Fuck, you’re awesome.” He glanced back down and moaned at the sight of his cock buried in Cas’ throat and his legs shook.
Castiel bit back a grin, happy Dean didn’t fight him on this. He reached over and put on some Zeppelin to help Dean’s mood and grabbed his hand. “You’re kinda cute too, you know.”
ideas today.” Dean said aloud to himself. “Of course the criminal wants more, when’s the fucking wedding?!” His tone is bitter and he walked over to his phone with a frown.
Dean couldn’t fight the cocky smile if he tried, and with yet another ego boost, Dean starts showing off. He meets every bounce with a powerful thrust and strokes Cas even faster. “Let me have it, baby. Want you to ride me with your come all on my face. Come for me.”
Dean lifted Cas’ chin up. “My car this time. If you’ve been hard for me for four months, I think you deserve a ride.” He leaned in and kissed him, pulling his bottom lip out with his teeth as he turned and walked toward his car with his hands in his pockets and not a care in the world.
Cas cleaned what he could before pulling up his pants and climbing in the car. “I’ll definitely have to use the next pit stop.”
Dean looks between then and chews slowly. “You never care about my plans unless there’s a case. You got one?”
“Touch me, Dean.” She grabbed his hands and placed them on her breasts, reaching down to stroke him as the door opened. He could hear her whisper “hi,” but Cas didn’t respond.
Cas released a faint whimper and then pulled away. He palmed his hard dick and took a step back. “When and where? Do you want some food first? I can tell you just got home and I know I blew your mind. No rush, I’m not going anywhere.”
Dean followed, stuffing his hands in his pockets. His mind was whirling and he didn’t think he’d ever been more nervous in his life. “Speak.”
Cas wasn’t done… he’d never be done. “Good, now shut up.” He pulled Dean back down, lapping into his mouth desperately.
Dean gripped the steering wheel so tightly he thought his knuckles would snap under the pressure. It was broad fucking daylight and they were in too public of a spot for Dean to be able to do a goddamned thing to help his angel. He’d never felt more helpless or disgusted in his life, but in that moment he knew Cas was their only shot at getting out of this alive, free and together.
Unfortunately, the women cared and they couldn’t get past second base before they were knocking but it was fine, dinner was ready and they really were hungry. Sex would have to wait.
“Yeah? I’m glad to hear it.” The guinea pig squeaked and Cas’ eyes immediately pinned themselves to the cage.
The man opened the door and grinned. ”Back for more, pretty boy?” The man instantly grabbed Cas and pulled him inside, closing the door behind him. He slammed Castiel against the door, locked it and started kissing on his neck, making Cas feel disgusting. “Back up! I gotta piss first,” he lied, unlocking the door the second the man turned away.
Cas nodded with Dean’s cock in his throat and slid back, quickly shoving him down again as he came. The taste had Cas releasing into his fist with a series of needy grunts as he swallowed Dean’s delicious come.
was the thing to get Dean out of bed at 6am. “Dean!! Cover your wood!” Charlie ducked out of view with her hands over her eyes and heard Dean laughing inside the tent.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!” Nick was sitting on the couch when Cas walked inside, grinning. Taking in the sight of his little brother, Nick shook his head. “Knew it was going to happen, you never quit huh, Cassie?”
He looked offended, “I’m not just going around kissing people, psycho! I liked Cas, he was my own personal angel today. I thought we had a connection and I was thankful he helped me, I was hoping to thank him with a blowjob or something but he denied me. I just haven’t gotten laid in months and he’s beautiful.” Jesse didn’t know why he was saying all this but he couldn’t help it. Dean’s gaze was so intense it felt like he was looking into his soul, it made him take a step back.
He does, and Benny cleans the ball as Dean takes his shot and makes it. “Oof. Roll back, thirsty boys.” His competitive side awakens as they get the balls back but when Lisa makes it again, Dean decides to go easy on Cas. He locks eyes with him and shoots, then looks down to see himself miss. “Well, fuck. Those eyes are just too pretty.”
Dean pulled back, letting Cas turn around. He stood facing the cross, his weight shifted to his right foot. “On your knees.”
came inside of a victim, with or without protection. Sex was too messy, too violent, to unpredictable to trust that he wouldn’t leave anything behind. His pulse pounded in his ears as he realized he couldn’t kill Castiel
“Yes,” he says instantly, then flushes red. “Um... yes, that would be okay. It’s your turn to choose the video, though.”
“No way you’re done after three drinks. Who are you?” Cas jokes, pouring himself a fourth drink with a grin.
Lust shot down Cas’ spine as he helped Dean get to his prize, then carded his fingers in his hair and tugged gently. “I get the sense you’re going to be a
Dean just looked at him, so Cas stood up and walked closer to see what he was reading. As he approached, he saw a photo of someone that
He goes to blow his nose and wash his face, focusing on the things Dean will need to be reminded of when he’s gone. Not the small things. Not a reminder to eat his vegetables or a reminder of where his only nice tie is — but a reminder to smile. A reminder to occasionally watch the sunrise like they used to together, and to remember that during those few moments of every single day, there is no bad or good. There just… is. With his mind back on track, Cas once again picked up his pencil and began to write.
I feel the need to say “we’re getting there, trust me!” because fair warning, we slow burn the crap out of this but this isn’t a fic where we cut off the second the get together. And I promise, it’s SO worth it when it happens.
“I mean, it’s not an ideal situation, but... if it gives us both what we want, I’ll give it a try. But babe, you better not have been kidding about bein’ involved. I’m not doin’ this shit without you.”
Cas nodded towards the stairs, led Dean to the second floor and unlocked the door, letting Dean enter first. “Home sweet home.”
Cas was completely frozen, and his eyes were wide from shock. “Dean…” He whispered once it all ended and he kneeled next to Dean on the floor. “Look at me…”
was going on with Dean, because it was obviously deeper than sex, since they haven’t had sex. Sex was all Michael and Cas ever shared and he
He picked up his phone and called Danny. He wasn’t a drug dealer by any means, but he was always the one with the pills.
“Yeah, she’s mentioned how good you are with that.” He ate more, his eyes still on Dean. “Has she still never tried anal?”
His tone is almost normal, as if they are talking about weather or art. Except they aren’t, they are talking about
Cas’ hips moved in small circles as he stroked himself through his orgasm. Dean was finally able to think clearly enough to fix his own pants as Cas wiped his hand on his jeans and slid his cock in his boxers. Cas huffed a laugh, and reached over to lift Dean’s gaze to meet his. “See you around, Officer.” Cas blew Dean a kiss with a smack of his lips and climbed out of the car, without a single look back.
“Shit... no deal-breakin’ now, Bumblebee. You signed the contract with a kiss.” Dean kisses him again and then pulls back a little nervous. “I actually do talk in my sleep…”
“Goddamn, I knew you’d suck dick like a pro. You gonna swallow for me, Cas?” Yeah, Dean was way too far gone to care about the words coming out of his mouth. “Fuck, I’m close…” He fast-forwarded a little, wanting to watch the climax.
more time over at Dean and Charlie’s apartment since he’d had that conversation with the others. They’d all been cool about it, and no one had heard from Michael in a couple of months, so now the only obstacle to their happiness… was them.
Charlie walked over and slid in the seat Dean left. “Oh my gob. Is that his number? Did you finally pull it off??”
He realized he’d much rather hang with Cas and Charlie, so he took a seat and snatched his bag back from her hands. “You guys doing that hike at sunset?”
“Ready for this babe?” Cas asked with a grin. “I want to chop his dick off, that’s what all rapists deserve.” Cas didn’t count what Dean did to him as rape, because he wanted it. He was sure the 13 year old girl from this crime didn’t.
Cas absolutely loved a brat. They weren’t for every dom, that was for sure, but Cas favorite thing was fucking the brat out of his partners, just to wake up and have to do it again.
“Man… Should we just go to Vegas and get married then, or wait a while?” Dean’s joking but Cas is tempted to say yes.
“Damn, Cas.” Dean bit his lip and smirked, his eyes dropping down to Cas’ dick. “That hard for me already?”
Dean kissed Cas again and turned to face his roommate. “Hey, we’re havin’ a family moment here. Right, Nut?” He glanced back toward the cage and stifled a laugh. “Wait, wait, maybe it’s the left nut.”
He was boneless by the time Cas finally pulled off, grunting out ragged little moans that definitely should
Dean barked a laugh, he'd been thinking the same damn thing. He stripped quickly and tested the water, surprised he had any hot left at all.
The next morning, Dean woke up stiff from the couch. “Ah fuck.” He grunted to himself, stretching out his neck. Glancing over at Cas, he had to smile, “Aww, look at the little angel.”
“Oh! I’ve seen videos of those, they’re pretty cute. Nah, no pets here. I’m allergic to cats and my apartment doesn’t allow dogs.”
The week dragged, taunting Dean with each crawling minute. The closer he got to Sunday, the more he was dreading the entire situation.
Dean’s eyes narrowed but he did nothing, reminding himself that he told Cas to do what felt right. He looked down at the douchenozzle still unconscious at his feet and reminded himself that soon, he’d be able to take his frustrations out on someone that deserved it.
