But, time or fate or destiny or whatever doesn’t give a crap if he’s ready or not.
“Of course not. I’m an excellent teacher! In fact, I should have my own cooking show!”
She pulled back and signed,
Eileen pursed her lips. “Maybe just one?”
It felt so long ago.
She led them towards another door labeled “PRINCIPAL.” She opened it and peeked in.
“Well, when I mentioned possibly looking for accommodations elsewhere, your mood changed. You were calm and excited before but then your nostrils became larger and-.”
While he finished getting ready, Dean was on the phone with… surprise, surprise… Castiel, telling him that they finally finished the case and would start heading home in the morning. He told the angel to be careful and to call if they needed anything.
“Good night, Dean.”
“Alright. See you later, Dean.”
It was Tuesday so that was three days of detention. Nothing Jack couldn’t handle.
“So, Sammy, no run today?” Dean smoothly changed the subject.
“I gave him your number,” the angel whispered, taking the spot next to Dean on the couch. “He didn’t say much but he didn’t seem opposed.”
It took a few seconds to register but the emphasis did it. Sam couldn’t stop his eyes from widening in shock. But, when he really thought about it, it also wasn’t that shocking. It sort of made sense.
Castiel already knew. He had always known. And he didn’t expect Dean to change.
Not that they had much of a choice at this point.
“Smooth sailing,” she replied with a grin. “It’s great to see Cas again. And Jack, too. Dean…” She trailed off a little, looking concerned. “Is he okay?”
“You look good, kid.”
The door closed behind them. A woman was click-clacking away at a computer. She raised her head to greet them and ask how she could help them.
Dean froze, spoon filled with milk and cereal hovering in the air. “What?”
Jack took a second to contemplate those words. The word “selfish” normally had a negative connotation. But, he had come to learn that it can be a positive word, too, in the right context. Such as doing something for yourself.
Dean whistled, finally entering the kitchen to take a look. One box was labeled “apple” and the other “blueberry.”
Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed against the walls. Both Dean and Jack turned their heads towards the door, right on time to see Sam shuffle in, a hand ruffling his hair as he yawned. (One of these days, Dean was gonna go through with his daily threat of cutting Sam’s hair off while he was asleep. Was he planning on beating Rapunzel for longest hair?!)
“Yes.”
Kaia seemed to realize it too as she pulled away and placed a flat hand on top of his head and then moved it across the space towards her own. She looked amused by the difference.
Onscreen, Allison had just gotten her makeover and Andrew looked dumbstruck by the transformation.
“I’m sorry,” he managed as he walked closer to his crying son. He pulled the boy into his arms, holding him tightly, cradling him in the way he should have if Jack had been born as a baby. “I’m so sorry. I… I didn’t know.”
For the first time since the meeting began, Michael finally spoke up. Everyone turned to him, surprised but also expectant.
“Nothing has changed in how I feel about you,” he explains, squeezing Dean’s hand, comfortingly. “It’s just… I’m not human anymore, Dean. And I have responsibilities again.” His smile widens to that of a proud parent. “Jack is rebuilding Heaven. And I’m helping him. We’re going to get it back to the way it was always meant to be. A place for everyone to come and rest and be happy the way they deserve. But… Dean… It’s not your time to be there, yet.”
“Oh!” Jack perked up, moving the papers to the coffee table and standing up. “We’re having our first Dance of the year!”
Sam blinked once. Twice. “Wait… what?”
The warm blood running down his back and the excruciating burning pain somewhere near his spine only confirms that he got himself into a situation that he has no way out of. He’s been stabbed and burned so many times that he’s almost numb to the idea that he’s not long for this world.
“Everyone really enjoyed themselves,” he said as he closed a container of mac and cheese, satisfied in hearing the “clicks.”
“Is something wrong?” Sam couldn’t help but ask. Something always went wrong. Jack was acting too shifty for nothing to be wrong. “Is it Heaven? Is there trouble?”
To his further surprise, Dean hesitated. “I… don’t know.”
“Sam hasn’t slept,” he says, avoiding Dean’s eyes. “I told him I would watch you in his stead so he could return to the bunker but he refuses to do so. He only went once to make sure Miracle has enough food. You adopted a dog. She’s beautiful and so well-behaved-.”
Back at the motel they were staying at, they stripped out of their dirty and soot-heavy clothing, took turns in the shower, and got ready for a night out at the nearby bar. Dean had insisted on celebrating and since his brother was in high spirits, Sam didn’t complain.
“Cas?!”
“Mmhmm, sure, and I’m secretly a wendigo.”
“And is your husband around? We’d like to speak to both of you.”
Jack bit his lip. “Well… why not?”
He paused, suddenly thinking about Dean because truth be told, Dean was not okay. He was far from okay. But, Jack had a lot more important things to take care of than worry about them. So, he refrained from talking about Dean.
He hung up and released a huge breath. Castiel and Jack were fine. They didn’t leave. Well, they left but they were coming back.
Dean opens the back door and Miracle happily hops in and settles down on the seat. He gave her one last head scratch before closing the door and sliding into the passenger side.
Sam placed a hand on the kid’s shoulder. “I’m sure she only wants what’s best for you. So, whatever they decide, we got your back, okay?”
“I accept you, no matter what you decide.”
Dean had just e-mailed him all the information, with a note to let them know if he needed backup, when a series of bangs shook the bunker, startling him. Like clockwork, his hunter's instincts took over.
Castiel squinted. “Do you know of another Rowena who rules Hell as its queen?”
Sam sighed. “You okay?”
“I’m not angry. I’m annoyed. The idea of you being a runaway doesn’t exactly appeal. You were in Heaven. You were supposed to be in good hands.”
Kaia caught Dean watching them and flashed him a smile and a wave. Dean waved back and pressed a finger to his lips, silently asking her not to reveal him.
“Oh, cool. Cool.”
“The same way humans were returned to Earth. Jack.”
“All of them. I swear it.”
The kid looked up as he approached and smiled. “I missed it here,” he stated. “Too often, when I was making my rounds around Earth, I was invisible. It’s nice to be noticed again.”
Overall, aside from the trip to the principal’s office, Dean thought it was a pretty fantastic day. He hoped more days could be just like this one.
“Why not? I can fly long distances now, Dean. I don’t mind.”
The kid said it with such disdain that Sam wondered if there was truly more to his running away than what he had been willing to share. So, he just patted him on the back and got to his feet.
Dean’s not sure if he’s ready.
Dean loses the battle to his eyelids and closes his eyes. He feels himself drifting off and this time, the void of darkness no longer feels like hell. He doesn’t dream, though. And he’s scared again.
Ever since Jack took on the powers and responsibilities of God, he could feel the presence of his great aunt. At first, Amara had been surprised to see Jack in the little space she called her own in his subconscious. Her last memory, after all, was of her brother Chuck absorbing her into himself. She did not expect to see anyone again.
Sam laughed as Jack stepped forward and placed his own bag on the table. “Sam bought a pie for dessert.”
By the fourth day, Dean was clearly unamused by Castiel’s constant pacing.
“Better listen to that one. He’s a smart one.” She squeezed his shoulder. “You’re right. You’re just a kid. All the more reason for you to take a break when you need it.” She gently broke away to gently take his chin between her fingers. “Talk to Castiel. Tell him what you’ve told me. I’m sure he and your mother and your uncles will understand this want of yours.”
“Really? ‘Cause you haven’t really checked in much last year. It was always Sam who answered the phone. And he told us about Cas and Jack being back. Even after that, you didn't really talk to us unless we needed information on a case. And, then, all of a sudden, you’re inviting us over for Thanksgiving. It’s a little jarring, dude. Like, what gives?”
The hunter wrapped his arms around Cas and pulled him back, sitting down on the chair and settling the omega in his lap. The angel’s head lolled back, the little slut whimpering and burying his nose against Dean’s neck as he squeezed around the Alpha's knot, coaxing out more come.
“Dean,” Sam said, stretching out his absurdly giant body and cracking his neck. “Can I use his cunt?”
Castiel was purring happily. The angel was laying flat, legs straight behind him, perfectly pinned, the body of his Alpha covering his smaller frame as his pussy twitched around the cock that was pumping him full of come. He hadn’t known it was possible to feel so complete, to feel like there was nothing more he needed from life than being underneath his Alpha, stuffed with cock.
“Why are you here, Cas?” he asked again, relishing how the omega was rocking against him, whimpering, trying to slide down his dick only to be stopped by the Alpha’s strong hands holding him still.
He felt Dean’s hands in his hair again and he cracked open one eye to see the Alpha leaning over him, smiling at him fondly before he kissed the tip of Castiel’s nose.
Castiel was moaning and fucking his pussy onto the Alpha’s thick fingers, face down in the Alpha’s sheets as he inhaled Dean’s amazing and potent scent.
“Good boy,” Dean said, smirking, and headed down the stairs. As much as it might be fun for Sam to come home to their new toy face down and ass up taking a knot in what passed for the bunker’s foyer, Dean had other plans, plans that involved a bed.
His Alpha picked him up, and the omega instinctively wrapped his limbs around Dean and pressed his nose into the Alpha’s neck, where his scent was the strongest. Being held in Dean’s strong arms while he was carried made him feel safe. Castiel had never smelled anything besides other omegas, or neutral beta scents, and he was quickly becoming addicted to his Alpha’s scent, which was somehow sweet and tart at the same time. It made him feel slow and pliant and happy.
Castiel shivered, feeling cold metal encircling his ankles. Dean reached beneath the omega, under his thighs and gently began pulling his arms from where they were curled under the angel and tugging his wrists to lay next to his ankles. Some clanking of metal sounded, and then Castiel’s wrists were cuffed along what felt like a metal bar. The angel couldn’t help but tense, jerking his hands against the cuffs.
The omega was panting into the hunter’s neck by now, twitching with every stroke of his cock. Dean stopped and delivered a sharp slap to the omega’s sensitive inner thigh, causing Cas to yelp.
This chapter is dedicated to black_dandelion and I hope you like it! Thank you for everyone who commented, I truly appreciate it and y'all keep me going.
Eventually, though, he sighed and withdrew his soaked hand and left the omega wailing and trying to undulate his hips as he turned to the laundry. He sorted the different loads with a small smile on his face as the desperate omega behind him squirmed and whined.
“Yes, Alpha,” Castiel panted, the words barely making it out of his mouth as his whole body jerked forward with Sam’s powerful thrusts from behind.
He heard his Alpha speaking with someone and noticed the scent of another Alpha but was too hazy and comfortable to react, even when he felt his master pull him upright by his hair. Trails of drool were falling from his open mouth, and his eyelids felt too heavy to keep open. His Alpha dropped him back on the bed and Castiel just drifted, feeling his body twitch occasionally around the cock filling him.
He felt his orgasm starting to tingle deep in his balls and slowed down. He wasn’t quite ready for it all to be over. He looked down to where Cas was whimpering beneath him, pulling his cock all the way out and spreading the angel’s cheeks to enjoy the sight of the omega’s pink cunt, glistening with slick and clenching around nothing. Castiel bucked weakly, tilting his hips in an effort to get the Alpha’s cock back into him.
“To be - unnh - to be fucked,” Cas grunted, “Alpha, please, please - ” Castiel’s pleading turned into garbled wail as Dean fucked into him with a hard smack. He kept one hand on the omega’s waist and used the other to grab the angel’s hair in a tight fist, keeping him immobile as he fucked Cas as hard as possible.
His hands pet over the miles of silken skin spooning against him, sliding his hands between Cas’ legs to skim over his sweet little hole, before grabbing the angel’s leg behind the knee, and pulling it up, opening Castiel for his cock.
He felt Cas nod, nose still buried in the Alpha’s neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel blinked away tears as he was filled with the first of many loads of come, looking devotedly up at the man who owned him, ready to worship him.
All omegas were slutty. All omegas smelled like pure sin and clenched hard around a knot. But angels were on another level of fuck toy, even for omegas. They didn't need to be fed, they didn't need to sleep, they didn't need to bathe. All they needed was a fat cock regularly splitting open their insides.
“C’mon, baby, come back to me,” his Alpha said, chuckling. Castiel felt his body being rolled over until he was on his back, and it felt completely natural to just let his legs fall open, baring himself to his master.
Dean had been wanting one for YEARS. He’d saved up all the money he’d made hustling pool, all of the cash he could pull off their fake credit cards, made sure that random valuables they found while working cases found their way into his pocket. Once he’d finally put the money together, he’d spent days on the Heaven Inc website, clicking through profiles until he’d found his dream omega.
Eventually, he registered his Alpha’s knot unlocking, and then he was empty. He let out a mournful whimper, twitching his hips up to try feebly to get it back in him. A hand pet through his hair and he closed his eyes at the blissful feeling.
The Alpha spanked the angel’s sweet little ass, hard, watching in satisfaction as the omega let out a strangled grunt and arched his back even harder. Dean amused himself for a few minutes warming his hand on Cas’ pretty ass, enjoying the noises coming from his pet as the pink from the spanking spread across the angel’s ass cheeks. He untied Castiel’s hands and the omega didn’t try to escape, just tucked his arms against his body and gripped the bedsheets in his fists as he cried.
Dean grabbed his messy hair and tilted the angel’s face to just the right angle before he slid his fat Alpha cock straight down the omega’s throat without hesitation. Cas choked a bit, drooling around Dean’s dick. The hunter barely paused, taking in the look on Castiel’s face, eyes watering and throat working around his cock before he started fucking the angel’s face, brutally.
“That’s for you, baby,” the Alpha said, before sliding two fingers into Castiel’s fucked out hole. The omega arched instinctively, chasing the pleasure of those fingers and it caused his body to fall into place, and he settled comfortably, despite being cuffed.
“Tightest cunt I’ve ever fucked,” Dean said, rotating his hips a bit to make Cas clamp down on him to keep him inside.
“GOOD boy,” Dean said, jacking the omega’s dick steadily while fucking his fingers into the omega’s tight hole, making sure the pads of his fingers were striking his angel’s prostate. Cas started crying and bucking against him, drooling as his eyes rolled back in his head and his small cock started squirting all over Dean’s rough hands.
The angel lost track of time, but he was eventually jerked out of his daze with a hand in his hair grabbing him roughly.
“Yes, Alpha,” Castiel said, his eyelashes fluttering. Sam slid his fingers back into the omega’s mouth and this time he let his lips shape themselves around the Alpha’s large fingers, just letting them be, instead of sucking. He could please this Alpha, he knew he could.
The omega moaned, his eyes rolling back in his head before he spurted all over the floor, completely untouched.
Dean slid his hands into the angel’s messy hair and gripped tight, then kissed him, plundering the omega’s mouth. He tasted amazing, and Dean could’ve spent hours fucking his angel’s mouth with his tongue.
He kissed Castiel’s temple and sighed happily as the omega started purring. Dean already couldn’t imagine a life without Castiel.
Comments feed the muse!
He finally fully understood what Dean had been teaching him all day. This was his purpose, the reason he’d been put on earth. To be fucked.
Castiel mewled helplessly, choking around the thick Alpha dick as it fucked his face. He wanted to come so badly, but no one had given him permission.
“There you are, sweetheart,” Dean said, pinching his nipple again and causing the omega to jerk at the pain, which was still somehow pleasure. He began whining, his hips rolling in gentle circles at the sensation, which made him feel achy and strange, heat from his nipples traveling down to his cock.
“Beautiful,” Dean said softly before moving to the head of the bed and sitting with his back against the headboard. He pulled Cas into his arms before settling the sniffling omega against him, the angel’s back against the hunter’s muscled chest. He spread the omega’s thighs and draped them over his own, before spreading his legs and leaving Castiel completely open to his touch.
“That’s it, that’s what you need,” Dean said, enjoying every squeeze of his omega’s throat around his dick. He picked up the pace, really going for it now, ready to dump his load in his omega where it belonged.
“Damn right I was,” Dean said, picking Cas up and turning to lay him out on the couch between them. He didn’t bother pulling his cock out of his omega, who was whimpering and rolling his hips against Dean. Cas was flushed and beautiful, that pretty pink blooming all down his chest. Dean slid his hands up his omega’s sides and then pinched his nipples.
“Alpha,” Castiel whined, rolling his hips into the slow thrusts of Dean’s cock.
“Good omega,” Sam said, his rumble hitting Castiel hard. His eyes drooped and he just relaxed, enjoying the feeling of his throat being stuffed with cock. As he laid there, warming Sam’s cock with his mouth, he heard Dean’s voice and the chair next to Sam screeched as it was pulled out.
“Now ain’t that a sight,” Dean said, chuckling as he started stripping off his clothes. Castiel watched with wide, lust-filled eyes, but stayed where he’d been put, hips working in tiny little circles as he watched the Alpha disrobe fully.
Dean slid his hand from the small of the angel’s back right between his cheeks, rubbing the pads of his fingers right against that tight, wet little hole. Cas squeaked and went even more boneless against him, hole fluttering as he huffed against the Alpha’s neck, breathing in Dean’s scent as the hunter slid his middle finger right into that tight heat. Cas jerked, moaning as he was penetrated for the first time.
Dean slapped Cas’ round ass one more time, just enjoying the feel of his hand on his omega.
“Fuck, sweetheart,” Dean grunted. “Your mouth is so good.”
“So, he’s yours. You requested a virgin angel, so that’s what you’ve got. He’s never been touched sexually. He hasn’t even been around Alphas before so he’s never smelled Alpha pheremones. He's as pure as it gets.”
Cas was on another plane of existence, screaming himself hoarse into the sheets his face was pressed into.
“What can I say?” Dean smirked. “I am just that good. You want his mouth?”
“How is he?” Sam asked, tilting his head back and drinking from his water bottle.
He threw open the door, and barely registered the Beta dude holding a leash before his eyes were drowning in blue. He couldn’t move his gaze from the bluest eyes he’d ever seen, large, framed with long, sweet eyelashes.
He stroked his hands down Castiel’s sweaty back. The omega was still twitching around the knot that was stuffing him full.
“I’m a fuck toy, Alpha,” Cas cried, voice wrecked and pleading. “Please, Alpha, please!”
“Ungh, that’s good,” Dean said, throwing his head back and closing his eyes so he could savor the feel of his cock being worked by the omega’s throat. His knot unlocked further and the Alpha carefully pulled out completely, looking down just in time to see one last spurt of come splatter all over Cas’ face, which was already a mess of spit, pre-come and tears.
Cas was limp at his feet, and Dean felt his orgasm creeping up his spine.
“Good boy,” Dean said, between furious thrusts. “Good fucking omega, good little fuck toy, such a pretty little angel.”
“You were made for this, baby,” the hunter said, his hands gripping the angel’s hair in a tight fist. “Built specifically to take my cock.”
The omega would learn. He was designed to take dick in every hole he had and he’d better learn fast because Dean had every intention of fucking him stupid and sloppy across every surface of the bunker in every conceivable position and he knew damn well that Sammy would also want to have their slut choking on his knot as soon as possible.
“Don’t be, sweetheart,” he soothed. “That’s what your hot little cunt is supposed to be doing. Means I’m doing my job, making sure you feel good.”
The angel was collared, naked, and had his hands tied behind him. He had dark, messy hair that made him look like he'd just been gangbanged. He was a couple inches shorter than Dean, and looked barely legal, adorable and not quite… small but smaller than Dean. He was just what the Alpha had wanted.
Castiel’s spine rippled in one long sinuous wave as he came hard, garbled noises falling from his mouth as his whole body clenched around Dean, then went limp.
“Say it again, baby,” Dean said, starting a gentle rolling rhythm with his fingers, his hand wet as he worked over the omega’s rosy cunt.
“Yeah okay, Dean,” Sam said bitchily. “You’ve made your point. You were right.”
“You’re a jerk,” Sam said, and then sighed. “But you were right about the omega, okay?”
He pulled the coffee carafe out of the maker and rinsed it out, smiling to himself as he heard Sam’s satisfied grunt and a quiet, rumbling “good omega”. After all of the “we don’t really need an omega, Dean” and “what if the omega gets in the way of hunting” bullshit that Sam had been spouting, Dean was working hard to keep a nice, smug “I told you so” from passing his lips.
Dean continued gently sliding his fingers in and out of Castiel.
“I know you do, slut,” Dean said, smiling at his omega affectionately. “Absolutely love getting fucked, stuffed airtight. Well, I’m going to be good to you baby, okay?”
“That’s right, baby,” Dean said, soothing the slap with his hand. “It’s alright that you didn’t know, you’re still new to all of this, and you still need some training, and that’s fine, sweetheart, because I’m going to help you, okay?”
Dean slid a hand over the slight bulge in his jeans, rubbing through the denim as he closed his eyes and fantasized about what he’d do to the omega first. Fuck, he needed to get laid. Dean was not an Alpha that lacked for partners of any gender, but sometimes after a difficult hunt he didn’t want to spend his time sweet-talking busty Beta chicks into dropping their panties. Sometimes he just wanted to bend a slut over and fuck them until they couldn’t walk.
He still had two fingers buried in the omega’s tight little hole, and he could feel Cas’ cunt rhythmically squeezing him as the angel continued to shudder in aftershock.
With one last squeeze to his half-hard dick, Dean refreshed the tracking page and froze. The GPS dot had moved. Right to the bunker’s location. Dean’s breath caught just as a pounding knock rattled their front door.
“If you want to return him, you have seven days. If you return him without fucking him, you can get three quarters of the price but as soon as you fuck him, you can only get half of your money back, capisce?”
Dean rolled his eyes. He knew that it had been him that had really wanted a beautiful angel pet, but the fact that Sam preferred running in circles in rural Kansas rather than be on hand when their new pet arrived was batshit crazy in his opinion.
He strode into his room, not bothering to close the door, before dropping the omega onto his bed with a bounce. The angel settled onto his back and seemed to instinctively spread his legs, showing off his wet hole and tight ass to the hunter.
"If he gets here before you get back, I'm knotting him before you even get a chance to smell him!" he yelled up to Sam, who was heading up the stairs. Sam just flapped a hand in acknowledgement. Batshit crazy.
“Like that, don’t you?” Dean said, pulling out and thrusting back in, every inch of his sweet slut’s glorious little cunt squeezing his dick. Cas made a strangled little noise that could barely be heard with his throat full of cock.
Thank you SO much to the people who commented, I was on the verge of giving up this fic because I thought maybe people weren't enjoying it. Y'all are awesome. Have more filthy porn as a reward. I know this is kind of similar to some of the other chapters, but 1) if it ain't broke don't fix it and 2) I'm working on something completely different for the next chapter. I hope you enjoy!
“Yeah.” She flashed him a curious look. “Where are you?”
“I should talk to him. Talk to you tomorrow?”
Castiel laughs again. He tries to let go of Dean’s hand but Dean holds on, flashing him a look that he hopes says everything he can’t physically say, himself.
Dean’s jaw tightened even more. “And you didn’t think to tell me until now?”
“Yeah, thanks for springing it all on me in one night!”
“It was for a month!” Dean defended, exasperated.
Dean chuckled and elbowed Castiel. “That would be Cas, here. When Jack’s mom died, she entrusted him to Cas and my brother and I are just along for the ride.”
He watched Dean swallow, the hunter’s gaze still firmly on the road. “You heard us?”
“O…kay?” Sam replied, brow furrowed. “So, that’s a problem? I always figured we were his uncles since Cas is his dad and all. He chose him, not us. And our start wasn’t exactly… great.”
Judd Nelson’s younger self as Bender was on screen now, removing his coat to show his jean jacket and red plaid flannel shirt.
“Hey, buddy!” The hunter went down on one knee and opened his arms and the dog happily went into them, licking his face. “I know, I know, you missed me, huh? I missed you too, buddy.”
Scared that it’s not real.
His brother visibly wrinkled his nose, disgusted. “Don’t you dare-.”
“Hello?”
He turned around to finally look at his brother, who was giving him a wary look. “What?”
Castiel, of course, would jump at any opportunity to make Jack happy. And ever since his talk with Sam, Dean doubled his efforts to be the best not dad/uncle Jack has ever had.
Kelly smiled up at him. “Just make sure he eats his vegetables, especially broccoli. And watch his sugar intake, he’ll get diabetes before he turns ten at the rate he's going with them.”
Maneuvering through the crowd wasn’t easy. Students popped out of nowhere, making Jack jump back and bump into people. His sensitive hearing picked out squeals and shrieks as well as the squeaks of shoes against the linoleum floor.
Dean forced his feet forward, lifting a hand. “Dean Campbell. I’m… Jack’s other guardian.”
“Dean, I’d rather not-.”
“You wanna look around?” he asked. “See if something catches your eye?”
Jack consulted his paper once more for the room number and tried to remember which stairs to take. He shut his locker door, swung his backpack over his shoulders, took one last deep breath, and nodded to himself
In the car, Jack was quiet. Dean peeked at him on the rearview mirror, wondering why he had that look of dread, as if Dean and Castiel were driving him to his execution. Maybe he did think that.
“I’ll take care of him, Kelly,” Castiel promised.
“Don’t worry about him, Cas,” said Sam, smiling in reassurance. “It’s just Dean being Dean.” He turned to the youngest among them. “So, Jack. Looks like you're going to school!"
“I’m sorry, Charlie,” he said. “I know I was MIA. But, after everything that happened with Chuck, I just didn’t… I couldn’t face you all. But, I’m trying, now. This whole… feelings thing, I’m working on it.”
Eileen nodded and signed, “I love you.”
“Oh, I apologize, I should have let you know.”
The invitation made Castiel smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Good. Good. You going to bed?”
Castiel’s voice broke through his thoughts and he looked up to see the angel lingering by the doorway.
Sam grinned. “Nothing,” he replied in a sing-song voice before handing him a granola bar.
Silly kid. Of course, Dean wouldn’t tell! They just had a chick flick moment! He wasn’t about to spill the beans on everything that happened.
“Lie back down, you shouldn’t try to get up yet. The doctor said you lost a lot of blood. And it’s a miracle you pulled through.”
Flashing a small glare at him, Castiel obeyed and slid into Baby’s passenger seat. Dean turned the ignition, maneuvered the car out of the bunker’s garage and they were off.
He looked up when Jack knocked on the window and waved.
Dean visibly swallowed. “Kinda wanna kiss you,” he whispered and Castiel’s felt his heart leap.
“I thought your dad was dead.”
“Why do we have to leave so soon? We haven’t had movie night in ages.”
“Please don’t make me go back to Heaven.”
He didn’t really have an answer for her. All he knew was that Jack was unhappy.
Castiel tilted his head to the side. “Tan,” he repeated.
Dean opened the pantry and placed the honey and apple butter inside. He scanned the shelves, wondering what he should make them for dinner.
“Oh. Okay, that’s fine. Hey, at least that means most of the other students in your classes will be new, too. You can easily make friends.”
Castiel preferred this kiss over all the others he had experienced. It had him feeling like his grace was burning up inside him and, for a moment, he was afraid that he would explode in Dean’s arms. But, he didn’t. The hotter he burned, the more wonderful he felt. And Dean’s lips against his own, though slightly chapped, were oh so soft. Castiel wished that he could taste him, too. Would he taste like the whiskey he was so fond of? Or something else?
me every time the Winchesters or Heaven needed you for something!”
Castiel’s tired sigh brought him out of his thoughts of guilt and regret.
“Thanks, sweetheart.”
“Right. Angel. Got it.” Dean chuckled, sounding a little nervous. Awkwardly, he reached out and patted Castiel’s arm again and squeezed it, lightly. “Good night, then, buddy.”
Kaia reached over and placed a hand over Claire’s, squeezing it in comfort. Claire smiled at her, a lovely smile that was so loving and tender that Jack felt like an intruder watching them. So, he turned back to his froyo to give them some semblance of privacy.
Beaming as she gave his hand one last squeeze, Kelly turned on her heels and walked away, presumably to return to her own heaven. Castiel simply watched her back until she disappeared from his sight.
And so Sam followed his brother into his bedroom and shut the door.
“They are both very angry.”
Castiel frowned and caught his arm before he could go further. “Jack, we need to go home.”
“Yeah, of course,” he signed to her. “By the way, thanks for getting all this together. I wish I could have helped.”
It was a little strange to Dean. They were talking about school and dress codes and proms and graduation. Schools were surely different now compared to when Dean and Sam went and he couldn’t help but wonder if they could keep up with the changes for Jack’s sake. What did it even mean to be a parent or guardian of a high schooler?
He heard the angel repeat the question to the dog and the dog seemingly respond. “He says he appreciates you letting him lick the plates when you wash the dishes. And speaking of that, Dean, I do hope you wash the dishes after he licks them? Miracle may be a clean dog but germs and bacteria can still accumulate-.”
Dean shrugged. “I dunno. It would be nice, I guess. I mean, he’s family, ya know.”
Dean took one last sweep of the kitchen to ensure everything was fine before bounding up the stairs to the bedroom. He swapped his pajama pants for sweatpants and tugged on his worn brown leather jacket over his sleep shirt. (He could shower later.)
“I couldn’t say anything, man! Billie was banging on the door and then the Empty showed up and next thing I knew, Cas had shoved me to the wall and he was…”
“What?” Sam asked.
Claire and Kaia were browsing the shelves, talking to each other in hushed tones. At one of the tables, sat Jack and Sam surrounded by textbooks and papers. It appeared that Jack was working on Biology, judging from the sketch of a DNA strand on his notebook and Sam’s excited rambling – that nerd.
Castiel's lip twitched. “Next time, please, just… try to find a teacher. Don’t get into any more fights. Please.”
He placed his bag on a chair then stretched, feeling his muscles pop in a pleasurable manner. For a second, he considered meditating and talking to Amara to get her opinion. But, if Dean was already grabbing Sam and Castiel, Jack didn’t want to keep them waiting.
Jack cleared his throat. “Actually, I sort of have an idea already, if you guys care to hear it?”
“What do the hell do you mean-.”
He was alive. Castiel was alive. He was right here. In the bunker. He was alive all this time.
Sam felt his throat constrict and he wished he had some water in hand. Thankfully, Dean took the reins.
Sam was still a little ticked off that he got left behind but, he had to admit, seeing the photo of the three of them made him smile. They looked like a happy little family. He wondered if everyone else who saw them thought that, too.
“How are you sure about that, Gabriel? You left us, remember? You weren’t there when Father just disappeared one day and never came back. He abandoned Heaven and we had to fend for ourselves, naively believing that he would return. And what happened after that? Chaos. Bloodshed. An apocalypse. If Jack leaves us…”
The bar wasn’t too far from the motel, probably only two blocks away. But, it was a cold night and drizzling a little.
Sure, he knew Castiel was a good dad but Jack was practically grown and so was Claire. Yet, the angel looked comfortable and at home with a baby in his arms. Maybe he started off a little awkward about it earlier but looking at him now, he looked like a pro.
“Something smells good. Are those waffles?”
“I could call up Eileen and see if she wants to do it with me,” said Sam after he finished explaining.
“We know a lot about that,” Dean muttered under his breath.
Finally, after what felt like forever, Dean, Sam, Castiel, and Eileen lowered their phones. One by one, they stepped forward to give him goodbye hugs and Eileen kissed his temple.
Satisfied, Castiel nods.
Dean cleared his throat again. “That’s… that’s good. Happy for Rowena. She almost killed us when she found out Crowley died. At least she finally got everything she always wanted. Did you know she left all of her witchy stuff to Sam? He brought them all back here from her apartment. Has a room for them and everything. I can show you later.”
Sam smiled and met it with his own. “Yeah.”
She flashed Sam a strange look that included wiggling eyebrows and a wink. Sam coughed and turned red, seemingly embarrassed.
Castiel pointed at his own cheek. “You have a little something…”
“You know I don’t sleep.”
Shutting his mouth, Jack nodded.
Jack blinked. “Oh. Was it a secret? The way you both look at each other, with so much love and adoration, I came to the conclusion, myself.”
Dean sighed. “Yeah.”
The rest of their ice cream outing went without much incident. They even took a selfie together, with all three of them. Then, Castiel had pointed out another chocolate smudge on his face but this time, he simply pointed it out and handed Dean a napkin so he could wipe it away, himself. And, before heading home, they bought Sam a large-sized cup of Rocky Road. (Dean wanted to get him a small but Castiel insisted on getting the largest size in compensation for them forgetting him at home.)
At this, Jack nodded. “I do. It’s fun.”
“I don’t know,” he replied, honestly. “But, I’m certain it has nothing to do with your stories.”
wanted to go back to school and… yeah, nope.
“I won’t run away,” he promised.
For a long time, Castiel was silent. On the T.V., Andrew was going haywire. Dean just wanted to watch the movie. Rewind everything and start from the beginning. He wasn’t sure if he was referring to the movie or this uncomfortable conversation.
and picked up two glasses from the dish rack before heading back to the table. He filled both glasses, almost to the brim, and pushed one to the kid. Jack took it gratefully and took a sip. Dean did the same and grimaced at the stringy texture on his tongue.
“Yes, I arrived the same time as Eileen so we came in together. I have some news.” Castiel looked behind Dean. “Where’s Jack?”
At that, she laughed and kissed his chin. “Me too.” Then, she looked down at her lap. “This life though… it’s not for raising kids. At least, kids who won’t end up like us.”
Now, it’s Dean’s turn.
Jack’s lip trembled. “Everyone hates me. The angels. The souls. Maybe even Dean still does.”
He really was. The case was exhausting, especially since he was out of commission for a while. Jumping right back in definitely took a toll on his no-longer young body. It wasn’t a difficult case but it wasn’t easy either.
Sam sighed. “Eileen and I have been talking about it since last year. After everyone got back.”
At first, Mr. Klein managed a smile, elated at the information. But, then, seeing the photos, his face crumbled once more. He reached out for a photo of a pregnant Kelly while his wife grabbed the cardigan and hugged it to her chest.
“I’m sorry, I-I didn’t mean to,” he whimpered, seeming to curl in on himself.
Castiel could feel something happening in his stomach. A comforting warmth. It happened a lot whenever Dean looked at him too long. There was a feeling of anticipation that he didn’t quite understand. It was easier to ignore in the past but after Dean’s confession, it was like he could feel every single nerve in his body humming and vibrating in response.
“No! No… don’t say goodbye. Just…” Dean visibly swallowed. “Just say, ‘see you later’.”
He followed Sam and Eileen to the library while Dean went to get Jack. They made small talk, mostly Eileen telling Castiel about what she had been up to and him giving her a fast and short version of what happened to him and Heaven.
“You can do that?” Sam asked, fascinated.
It felt like the war room was further than it actually was but, finally, they made it. Everyone had already chosen their own seats around the table but both heads were left empty. The map table, itself, was heaped with so much food that Dean wondered how they managed to make room for the plates.
“Nothing. Just… you sound like a worried husband and dad, that’s all.”
“We will tell the angels that Jack is taking a leave of absence to rest and recuperate.” Michael paused and, here, he looked at Castiel, pinning him with a look that garnered obedience. “One year.”
“Doesn’t matter now, I guess,” Sam said, contemplatively. “If it’s on Facebook, her parents most likely have it on other platforms, too. And… hate to say it… police might even be involved, now. Jack’s right. We have to nip this in the bud. But, how?”
“Thank you, Dean.”
Claire volunteered to get Sam and Jack so Castiel got Miracle’s own dinner ready. The angel hummed as he filled the bowl with dog food.
“Oh. Cool." He breathed out. "That’s fine, we’ve got plenty of room here. She can stay with you. Or if she's sick of your snoring and your face, she can take one of the other rooms and-”
Is he allowed to laugh in hell?
That was another thing. Miracle took to Jack like a fish to water. He
He released the safety on the gun before bellowing, “Who the hell are you?!”
“Is Jack here?”
Dean raised his head again, his eyes squeezed shut, as if he was in pain. “What about hunting? Are you still gonna do that?”
Jack felt himself blush but was aware of Casey’s presence behind him. He had to be careful with his words. “Well, I had to… you know. To fit in.”
A familiar red car ambled up the dirt road. It continued and stopped just a few feet away from where Castiel stood, patiently waiting.
“Dude, what the heck’s going on with you?”
Dean was working basic maintenance on Baby when it happened. His phone rang. At first, he let it go to voicemail, not wanting to break his concentration. A minute or two passed until it rang again. This time, Dean wiped his hands on a rag before picking it up.
Dean had no real answer to that. “I just… don’t.”
best friend – could even feel that way, especially towards him. Who was Dean Winchester compared to an angel of the lord? Dean had nothing to offer. Angels could fall in love, Dean now knew and he had enough time in the last year to come to terms with that.
Castiel looked thoroughly chastised while Dean laughed.
“What got too much, Jack?” he asked.
“This is…. A lot,” he observed.
A pang hit Dean in the chest.
“And you can chop some peppers while you’re in there,” he called out to her.
“Got practice,” he said.
Light as a feather, he moved through the darkness before settling and landing. He felt his own weight, heavy against the soft sheets of his bed. Castiel’s voice was clearer as he called to him from the other side of the door.
“Yeah,” said Kaia. “We’re on our way back to Sioux Falls…”
Meanwhile, after a close call with a vampire nest and almost dying from a nail in the back in Ohio (Sam managed to clear out the bodies, call 911, and get him to the hospital in time), Dean had decided, right there and then, that he was done hunting. He wanted stability.
Dean nodded, absentmindedly. They’ve pretty much talked about everyone and everything. Castiel told him all he wanted to know. Except for one thing.
Jack seemed to hesitate before sighing. “It’s not very… cool,” he said, honestly. “And this is my first school Dance and in the movies, you’re supposed to look nice.”
Dean places a hand over his, gripping it tightly. “Anything, Cas.”
Dean was no fool, okay? People may think he was stupid for a variety of reasons and he was fine with that. It threw them off and made them underestimate him. But, when it came to things that mattered, Dean was not a fool. He knew what Castiel meant by that line. He knew what the angel meant when he said, “I love you.”
Not meeting his eyes, the couple nodded.
“Dean, calm down. I’m sure they’re fine.”
“It happens. We were in a rush.”
“Dean!”
The angel’s thumb stroked his, gently. “I don’t know what to say,” he confessed.
“But, first, I need to know if Jack is here. Is he safe?”
Dean paused his peeling to look over at her. “Me? I’m fine. Never better.”
Dean felt bad for him, wanting to reprimand Castiel for making their kid think about adult work.
“Either way, what’s done is done,” said Michael, taking his hand back from Raphael and folding it with his other one on top of the table. “I will not force our nephew to come back if he’s not ready. Now, we must simply think of the next steps. And, as I mentioned, we are not alone this time. We have each other.” He smiled at his brothers and Kelly. “We can all work together to ensure that Heaven will continue to run smoothly in his absence.”
Jack shrugged. “He was being a bully to Casey.” He spooned some froyo into his mouth, practically moaning at the sweet taste of the nougat and the crunchiness of the sprinkles.
“Okay, we’ll go back to that scene.”
“I didn’t tell you that Eileen and I were planning on moving in together because I didn’t want you to suffer any more than you already were. You weren’t in a good place and I couldn’t spring that on you. So, we waited and, honestly, man, I never thought we’d get there. But, then, Jack and Cas came back and, suddenly, you were getting better. You’re laughing more and you have this… new sense of purpose. I waited longer because maybe it was a fluke. But, you’re getting better, Dean, don’t deny it. So, I feel like I can tell you now. And I just did.”
“Nothing! Dude, relax, okay? I was just asking. It’s no big deal.”
“Night, Sammy.”
Sam went about preparing two mugs of coffee while Eileen squeezed into the bench beside Jack and Castiel. She filled her plate with bacon and pancakes and Jack passed her the bottle of syrup.
“I think he’s doing it more for Cas, if you ask me. It’s his first Thanksgiving.”
“Yeah, we do!”
“I understand, Sam, do not worry. You were getting everyone to safety.”
“He did.”
They both settled on the empty chairs on either side of Jack. The boy seemed to shrink in further into himself.
With that last thought, he took off again and made his way back home.
“Dean!” a new voice joins them.
Something happened over the weekend. Jack couldn’t put his finger on what it was, exactly, but something
What was next year going to be like?
He paused and gave the hunter his full attention.
Castiel always wondered what the phrase “tongue-tied” meant. Now, he knew.
The hunt where he died.
Dean is so proud of him. Now, Sam can go wherever he wants and do whatever the hell he feels like without Dean holding him back. He should look for Eileen, she's good for him.
Meanwhile, Castiel quit the convenience store when he discovered a Honey Farm nearby. He learned how to be a beekeeper – the bees always did fascinate him. He was good at it. He talked to the bees like he talked to people. Whether he could actually understand them or simply made up their conversations, it didn’t matter. He was a hoot among the older ladies and the kids.
Male celebrities admitted that they were attracted to other men. Gay men played sports. Men married other men and had children. “Brokeback Mountain” was considered a classic romance movie. Heck, Pride parades were highly-publicized events now!
Finally, Dean appeared with a large bottle of liquor in one hand and two glasses in the other. The hunter pointed at one of the chairs with the glasses.
“But… we were thinking… of moving in together.”
Then, to his surprise, Claire snorted and broke into her first smile. “Totally embarrassing? Yeah, he was such a dork about it.”
“Of course. It was wonderful seeing everyone again. And everyone enjoyed your food. You should be proud of yourself, Dean.”
Sam calling and e-mailing every professor and theologian he could find. None of them could help.
“Ain’t that sweet?” Dean commented and Castiel agreed.
“Hangry, Cas. Like hungry and angry?”
Dean ignored the sensation in his stomach as he grinned and gestured for Castiel to lead the way.
There was only silence in response, save for the sound of the waves.
He can feel his arm.
Still glaring, Dean huffed. “It’s your life, Sammy. I’m just here to support you. But, for the love of Jack, do not move to suburbia. I’ll judge you forever.”
“He did do a good thing,” he agreed. “I know I should be disappointed as the parenting books say. But, how can I when he did the right thing? Though, he did use his full strength when we specifically told him to watch himself.”
Castiel squinted. “I don’t eat-.”
He forces his eyes open again, slowly this time, so he can adjust to the light.
So, Dean continued to push through, ignoring the angry and protesting voices in his head, telling him to turn back. One of them sounded suspiciously like John Winchester. But, Dean was getting tired of listening to those voices. He was tired of letting them control his actions, his wants, and his needs.
He needed his heart to
“I don’t blame them,” mused Castiel, sadly. “Kelly was adamant about them not knowing the truth. But, clearly, we can’t escape this.”
“What?!” Dean sits up, unable to believe his ears. “You did what?”
“What happened?” he asked as he followed Dean back to the garage.
Oh, did he say that out loud?
The way he and his garrison stormed through Hell, weaving their way through the throng of demons that greeted them. Castiel had been at the head, slashing and stabbing the smoky dark beings. His true form’s eyes had scanned every broken soul upon the racks, torturing others to their dark hearts’ content. And, then, he saw it: the brightest and purest soul in all of Hell. The Righteous Man. He, too, was torturing a soul but found no real pleasure in it. So, Castiel had gripped his arm tight, despite the soul’s enraged protests, and flew out of Hell with him with his grace flaring. Dean was broken but rebuilding him was nothing to Castiel. He put him back together, piece-by-piece, learning more about the soul – the man – that managed to remain pure in Hell. He was a puzzle and Castiel had been curious to know what the whole picture looked like.
He really couldn’t help but wonder what made Jack leave Heaven all of a sudden. He had Kelly as well as Castiel. And if you counted his brief meeting with Gabriel, he also had his uncles. He had his family up there. But, why did he still leave? Was he really that unhappy?
He entered the kitchen and immediately spied their resident God, perched on the table, munching on cereal. It was the sugary kind that Sam often hid in the back of the pantry:
“So…” Sam began, trying to sound nonchalant. “Cas is back.”
“Jack?”
“It just seems cruel, man.”
“So, what gives, Dean?”
“Then I’ll teach you. And while you’re still learning, you can do other stuff for him. We can take turns driving him to school and picking him up. You can help him with some of his homework.”
“You know, if you want some alone time with Cas, now’s your chance. He’s in the kitchen stirring the pizza sauce for the next two hours. He’s all alone in there. He could probably use some company.”
Sam rolled his eyes but Dean knew there was no malice behind it. This was how they worked as brothers, after all.
“Yeah, yeah, keep mixing. I don’t want lumps in my cornbread.”
The smell of antiseptic.
Sam bit his lip. “Do you… want to tell me why? Or what’s wrong?”
With one last wave goodbye, Jack felt himself moving.
One thing they were both clearly avoiding.
God, he really was Castiel’s son.
“We missed you, too.” Sam pulled away and stepped back, taking a few seconds to look at him.
They finally made it home, a couple of minutes earlier usual due to Dean’s speeding but, luckily, with no incident.
Wake up from what? He’s dead.
Dean hung up and scooped another spoon of ice cream into his mouth. He looked up to see Castiel and Jack watching him.
Dean gestured with a jerk of his head towards the Jack in the back. The kid tried to look inconspicuous but he did seem to perk up at the mention of ice cream.
She smiled, stepping forward to plant a motherly kiss to his forehead. “Anytime. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll take a swim.”
“When Castiel comes back, we can leave.”
Weird question, but okay. “Yeah, of course. Dean did too.”
Once everyone’s glasses were filled, everyone looked towards Dean, expectantly. It just occurred to him that as the host, he was expected to make some kind of speech.
“Yeah… Yeah, I know,” she repeated. “Jack told me everything Cas does for him. The breakfasts and packing his lunch and all that. That kid can talk, dude.”
With one last wink at Castiel, he strolled towards Jack. Castiel noted a few eyes following him, mostly from the teen girls and from some of the parents and teachers. Dean garnered attention everywhere he went without even trying. If Castiel was like any other human, perhaps, he would feel jealous. But, he wasn’t, not really.
Dean bit his lip and nodded. “Yeah… Yeah, we’re good.”
Dean tossed the empty paper plate at the nearby trash can and wiped his hands on his pants.
Dean opens his mouth to answer but, again, his voice refuses to cooperate. And he’s tired again all of a sudden.
between Dean and Castiel.
“So… this feelings thing…. Does it also include Castiel?”
Filled with new determination, he opened the door to face what was coming next.
Dean could only watch, helplessly, as Jody took over his kitchen just as easily as she did at her own.
Dean muttered curses under his breath as he tried to maneuver to an empty spot. Castiel found one and pointed it out so Dean squeezed in and parked.
Jack brushed off the sand from his jeans as he, too, got up. “Thank you for listening, Amara.”
“You can do this, Jack.”
The angel cleared his throat. “Sorry.”
“Hi, mom,” he said to Kelly’s smiling image.
“I brought mac and cheese!” she announced.
“Yes, Cas.”
“Heya, Sammy!”
That made Dean turn his attention away from the T.V. to look at Castiel.
“I said ‘no’, Castiel!”
“And thank you for reminding me about the sunscreen, I bought a new bottle the other day.” Dean turned his attention to Jack again. “Jack, they might take you outside for gym class. Now, I don’t care if you’re God, we do not risk skin cancer in this family. You’re wearing that shit. Be right back.”
Dean hid a wince.
“I thought he was gonna have an aneurysm!”
“Maybe something light since we’re having a big dinner.” Dean placed an arm over his shoulder as he pursed his lips in thought. “PB&J?”
Taking several more deep breaths, Jack managed to calm the butterflies in his stomach. They were still fluttering around but not quite in full force. He sent a quick prayer to his uncle Gabriel, letting him know that it was his first day of school and to please let his mother know that he was fine so far.
Castiel’s whole body jerked, his voice whining with the omega’s desperate pleasure of having something snug in his tight hole.
All of those fears had disappeared when he’d first seen his Alpha, so beautiful and strong, smelling so wonderful. His Alpha would take care of him, and make him feel good and safe and he didn’t have to worry any more.
The hunter tilted Cas’ head up and kissed him, enjoying the taste of his sweet boy. He spent several moments pillaging the angel’s mouth, before dropping several kisses along his jaw and nibbling over the bite mark he’d left on Castiel’s neck.
Castiel sat on his pillow, drifting as his two Alphas talked, their deep voices tingling down the omega’s spine. He felt so sleepy and relaxed, with a plug deep in his cunt and a cock deep down his throat. Drool slowly dripped down his chin and hit the kitchen floor as he knelt, perfectly obedient, and was used for his purpose.
“When you say so, Alpha,” Castiel moaned, his words barely articulated.
“Sucks for you, bitch,” he said, smirking. “Make sure to put some fabric softener in there.”
He knew his Alpha was talking to him and he tried to pay attention but it was all coming from so far away, across an ocean of contentment that he was drifting in.
Castiel let out a shy purr as the hunter ran his thumb over the angel’s cheekbone.
“Ok, baby,” Dean said, eyes crinkling as he smiled down at Castiel. “Let’s get you ready.”
“You only suck if I say to suck, omega,” Sam said, his quiet voice surprisingly soothing.
“That’s right, sweetheart,” Dean said, smiling down at him and removing his fingers from Castiel’s hot heat and moving his cock from where it had been pressed firmly against the omega’s ass to rub the head right over Cas’ hole, enjoying the feel of his cock getting soaked in slick.
“C’mere, baby,” he said, extending a hand under the table and helping the omega stumble to his feet. He couldn’t help but chuckle at the amount of come Sam had managed to coat the little slut with.
“I’m here to - unnh - to be fucked, Alpha,” Castiel moaned, eyes quickly losing coherency as Dean ruthlessly finger fucked him.
Two hours later, excluding the short break he took to switch the laundry to the dryer, the Alpha finished dumping his third load into the entirely limp omega. Sam was pretty sure Castiel was whatever passed for unconscious among angels, every limb boneless and his eyes shut. He’d stopped yelping around 45 minutes ago, until the only sound left was Sam’s balls slapping against the omega’s wet pussy.
“You’re soaking the sheets, baby,” Dean said, laughing at the blush that tinted Cas’ cheeks.
“Good boy,” Dean said, fucking the omega with solid thrusts, enjoying the soft mewls that fell from Castiel’s lips with every pound of Dean’s cock. He rolled the omega under him, straddling the angel’s thighs with Cas’ legs beneath him lying straight in one long tempting line.
The omega let out a slutty purr in response, muffled by the massive cock that was stuffing his mouth full, eyes sharpening just enough to look up at the Alpha adoringly before he went back to working his tongue against Dean’s knot.
“Please, Alpha,” Cas begged, his words slurred as he drooled into the sheets.
“You can come, slut,” Dean breathed out, digging his fingers in and pulling Cas back onto his dick as hard as he could. The angel let out a high pitched cry as his whole body seized, his talented pussy squeezing every inch of Dean’s dick. His knot popped and he groaned as he started filling the omega full of come.
Cas just looked up at him in confusion, tears forming again in those beautiful blue eyes as he panted against the Alpha.
The omega licked his lips, tasting Alpha come for the first time with a hungry look on his pretty face, before staring up at Dean and dropping his mouth open again, silently asking for more.
“Fuck,” he muttered, as his balls tightened. “Fuck, you’re so good for me Cas.”
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed before he heard the other Alpha enter the room, opening drawers and the rustling of clothes. The bed creaked slightly behind him as the Alpha settled himself behind Castiel before he felt large, strong hands pull his cheeks apart, baring his hole to the Alpha.
“You’re so pretty when you beg, baby,” Dean said, predatory smile widening. “But you’re misinformed.”
“That’s what you are, Cas, something pretty to stick a dick into, to fuck while it makes sexy noises,” Dean grunted, feeling like a god as he fucked the crying omega into the mattress. He felt his knot forming and slapped Cas’ flank sharply, leaving a red hand print.
“Fuck,” Dean barked. He’d never had anything so tight around his dick. It was otherworldly good. His knot caught, splitting the omega’s cunt open before it locked, filling the drooling omega with seed.
“Fuck, that’s good pussy,” Dean grunted, enjoying the tight, wet heat wrapped around his dick. The omega’s muscles were fluttering around him as Cas adjusted. Dean collared the angel’s neck with a firm hand, sliding his other hand under the omega’s thigh and started fucking him with rough, deep thrusts. The hunter held Castiel completely immobile, the angel unable to do anything but lay limp against the Alpha and take dick.
“That good, huh,” Sam said, chuckling.
“Yes, Alpha,” Cas said dreamily, eyes closed and pliant body nestled trustingly against his Alpha.
Cas beamed at him, his blue eyes bright and happy. His scent was all honeyed arousal and ocean breezes, making the kitchen smell absolutely amazing. Fuck, but he was really getting attached to this sweet omega.
Cas’ mouth had barely dropped open before Sam had tilted his face to the right angle and was feeding the omega his dick. Dean loved the little grunting noise Castiel made when Sam was fully sheathed in his throat.
“Yes, Alpha,” Cas said, moaning as he bared his neck further for the hunter.
He ground his dick in hard, feeling his knot growing already. Castiel’s hot little hole was just so good, already starting to milk him for a load even though neither of them had started coming.
The omega was pinned to the wall, arms stretched above him, and his knees spread wide and attached to the concrete, leaving his wet hole completely exposed. He had a cock gag muffling his whimpers and his nipples were clamped. The delicious smell of omegan arousal was almost overwhelming.
“Look, man I just need to get through this spiel and you can do whatever the fuck you want to him, okay?”
“Good boy,” Dean praised, causing the omega to whimper in pleasure. “The first thing you need to understand, Cas, is that you’re not here to come. You’re here to get fucked, in any way I want to fuck you, and to give me pleasure. If it gives me pleasure, I will let you come, but it won’t be for you, it’ll be for me, do you understand?”
“Please what, angel?” Dean asked, grinning.
“And what do you say to me, Cas?” Dean prompted.
Dean basked in the feeling of having a sated Castiel in his arms, still trembling in orgasmic pleasure, the omega’s nose buried in Dean’s neck, his wonderful scent filling Dean’s room with happy, aroused omega.
“Oh, baby,” Dean said, cupping the angel’s face in his hand. “We’re going to have so much fun with you.”
“Fuck,” he said again, under his breath.
Dean couldn’t have felt better. He had a pretty little pet at his feet, hands tied behind his back, and whose blue eyes were half mast and dazed as he obediently swallowed the steady stream of come the hunter was pumping down his throat.
“I - unnhh - was a good fuck toy, Alpha,” the angel said, writhing in Dean’s arms.
“Oh, I don’t know, Sam,” he said, snuggling his face right into his omega’s neck and getting another hit of that glorious ocean breeze scent. “I thought his cunt was a waste of money.”
Dean pulled the angel into an embrace, and Castiel wound his arms around his master’s neck and let out satisfied purrs at being pressed against his Alpha, nuzzling into the base of Dean’s throat. Dean laughed gently and just held him for a few moments, petting the omega as Castiel cuddled against the hunter’s strong chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good boy,” the hunter said, grabbing a fistful of hair and baring the omega’s neck, leaning down to bite it, before letting go. His hands gently tugged the angel into place, knees hip distance apart, settled on his heels.
Dean’s kisses gentled and he left one last lingering press of his lips on Castiel’s cheek, cupping the omega’s face in his strong hands.
Cas whimpered, his plush lips open and wanting. He looked absolutely desperate but didn’t move from where Dean had put him, perfectly obedient.
In his opinion, this is what omegas should look like all the time, drooling and fucked out, cunts dripping with come and slick, and spread open for another knot.
He yanked the leash and the omega fell into him, eyes wide and dark, panting slightly as his smaller form plastered against Dean’s muscled frame.
“He’s very pretty, Dean,” Sam said, one hand easing down the omega’s throat to his collar bone before cupping the angel’s face. Castiel let his eyes half close as he rubbed his cheek into the Alpha’s grasp. He choked a bit as two large fingers slid deep into his mouth, his eyes meeting the Alpha’s hazel gaze. He instinctively began sucking on the fingers filling him.
Dean carried him down the hall and set him on another bed, one that smelled of a different Alpha. His Alpha tilted his chin up and kissed Castiel, and it felt so good. The omega melted, putting his arms around Dean’s neck and trying to press his body as close to his master as he could.
Dean opened his eyes and looked at his dumbass brother in disbelief. He was currently balls deep in an omega that was orgasming his brains out all over Dean’s dick and Sam wanted to play some stupid game?
“Yeah, okay,” the beta said, rolling his eyes. “No one’s gonna take him from you bro, I just need you to initial here to confirm that you heard what I’m telling you.”
Sam grumbled to himself as he dragged two full hampers of laundry down to the laundry room. At least the bunker had commercial grade washing machines and dryers, impressively built monstrosities that would probably keep running through several more apocalypses.
Dean collapsed back on the couch, knot gagging Cas’ mouth, come sliding down the omega’s throat. He looked over at Sam, whose hands were still firmly gripping Cas’ hips as he knotted him, looking totally blissed out as he came.
“Rock, paper, scissors?” Sam interrupted.
“Sure thing, Sammy,” Dean said, dropping Cas back onto the bed and stretching. He felt fantastic, every bit of stress evaporated. Yeah. This had been a fantastic idea.
Sam didn’t see the point in wasting any more time teasing Castiel, and freed his cock with efficiency, stepping up to the omega. He was impressed that Dean had managed to mount the omega to the wall at the absolute perfect height for fucking, and sheathed his throbbing dick in the tight hole with one hard thrust. The omega let out the little satisfied grunt that all omegas made when he stuffed them full of his cock and gave them what their pussies were craving.
The more he thought of Dean, with his green eyes and strong hands, the emptier he started to feel, and Castiel started to fidget in his cuffs. He felt so hollow, like part of him was missing. He let out a sad little whine. But Dean wanted him to be good, and surely being good meant being patient. He began drifting again, just letting his mind float.
“Thank you, Alpha,” Castiel said, his voice fucked out and filled with the proper gratitude.
“No, Alpha,” Castiel cried, trying to spread his thighs wider. “Please, Alpha!”
The Alpha grabbed a fistful of Castiel’s hair and brought the omega to his cock, sliding the thick Alpha dick into the angel’s throat until he was balls deep. Castiel let out a small grunt as his mouth was invaded, but went passively limp and let himself be used for Sam’s pleasure. The omega had to fight his instinct to suck, and instead lay against the Alpha’s thigh and just held the cock in his mouth. If Sam wanted him to suck, he’d tell him to suck.
“That’s it, sweetheart,” Dean moaned. “Fuck, you feel good.”
Dean’s fist clenched around the leash which pulled the omega within scenting distance and FUCK Dean could feel his pupils dilate and his fangs itch. Castiel smelled like the ocean after a thunderstorm and if Dean didn’t get him sheathed on his cock soon he was sure he would die.
Dean stretched, rubbing a hand over his stomach. Damn, he made an excellent breakfast if he did say so himself. He gathered up the dishes and set them in the sink to soak. Behind him he could hear Sam face fucking a mewling Cas as he dumped some dish soap over the dirty dishes and called it good.
Dean began kissing his neck, nibbling over the omega’s mating mark and causing Castiel to shiver. He felt his Alpha’s knot unlock, and then Dean was pulling out, leaving Castiel unbearably empty. The Alpha nipped him hard on his neck and then rolled off the omega.
“You have to sign for him,” the delivery guy said impatiently, and handed him a pen.
“Open your mouth, sweetheart,” Dean said, arranging the omega’s pliant body to be perfectly situated between him and the other Alpha, who was already stripping off his clothes and getting his cock out. “You’re going to enjoy this.”
“Please,” the angel cried. “I need… Please I need… I want... to come.”
“You like that, baby?” Dean asked with a smile. “You like being a perfect little slut for me?”
“You. Were. Right.” Sam said, enunciating every word clearly. “Now, hand him over.”
“That didn’t stop you from dumping a gallon of jizz all over his face, now did it sasquatch?” He pulled the plug out slowly, causing Cas to let out a sweet whimper and tilt his hips, offering up his tight cunt. The whore really loved getting fucked, which, let’s face it, was convenient for everyone involved.
Distantly, he could hear the Beta dickhead talking at him, until a hit to his shoulder jolted him from staring into the omega’s eyes. The delivery guy hit him again with his clipboard.
“Let me have his cunt Dean, please,” Sam said, his hand flexing around Cas’ throat. Dean could barely even see the omega’s face, Sam was drowning the poor angel in dick.
“Insatiable little slut,” Dean said with an amused chuckle. “Don’t like being empty, do you, little omega?”
Cas leaned into him, purring. Dean tossed the smaller man over his shoulder and stood, the angel’s startled yelp making him smile. He smacked his hand onto Castiel’s round ass, just to hear that noise again. The omega obliged with another yelp, then began wiggling temptingly, his thighs covered with the slick that was pouring from his slutty cunt. Dean slapped him right over his swollen hole, enjoying the wet sound and the strangled moan the angel let out before the omega went completely pliant.
“One, two, three, shoot,” Sam said, before throwing scissors. Dean held up his fist clenched in rock in triumph.
“Such a good boy,” Dean cooed, sliding his fingers out slowly before pushing them back in gently, rolling his wrist in a circular motion while stimulating Cas’ prostate with soft touches. He was rewarded with a small gasp and then the rolling of the omega’s hips as he rocked his pelvis on Dean’s fingers, and another spine-tingling flood of slick.
Sam pushed the hampers of dirty laundry towards the washer and stepped up to the omega, gliding long fingers over the tight buds of Castiel’s clamped nipples. The omega let out a muffled keen, baring his throat as best he could with how immobilized he was. His bright blue eyes were dazed.
Dean laughed out loud. He rarely won rock paper scissors, but when he did it never failed to make Sam salty.
Cas was whimpering like a whore, hips working furiously as his face was fucked.
“Such a good boy,” Dean said, the praise hitting Castiel deep inside. He wanted to please his Alpha, always.
The angel cried out in disappointment when Dean pulled his fingers out, letting out sad little mewls until suddenly he felt something thick at his rim and then ohhhhhhh he was being filled good and deep. He clenched around whatever was filling his wet cunt, feeling immensely better even though he could tell it wasn’t a cock.
Castiel sat quietly while Dean started cooking breakfast, trying to stay still and maintain position. It helped immensely to be plugged, and the angel let his eyes close and just concentrated on the feeling of being thoroughly filled, clenching around the plug and basking in the full feeling, trying not to rub his little cock against the pillow beneath him. Dean wanted him to be good, so Castiel would be good.
Castiel barely noticed the grunting, animal noises he was making every time the Alpha’s cock slammed home, and eventually he went to that beautiful place where everything was bliss. He felt the sharp pleasure when the Alpha knotted him, and the soothing feeling of being filled with come left him limp and sated.
Dean cradled the crown of the angel’s head in one broad hand and stroked the other down the omega’s neck, squeezing slightly so he could savor the feel of his cock sheathed firmly in Castiel’s throat. He ran his fingers along side the omega’s brand new mating mark, a bone deep feeling of completeness bursting from him with a satisfied rumble.
Dean chuckled and rearranged Cas a bit, making sure the omega was situated as comfortably as he could be, double knotted on his hands and knees between two Alphas. When he was sure Cas was comfortable he went back to petting the omega, smiling gently when he felt the omega’s purr start up again. He really couldn’t imagine a better way to spend an afternoon at home with his family.
A sharp smack snapped his face to the side, and he looked back at the Alpha’s calm gaze with wide eyes. Sam had slapped him, though it was more of a shock than anything painful.
Sam pulled his dick from Castiel’s mouth and began spraying thick Alpha come all over the whimpering omega’s face, grunting with every spurt. Castiel laid limp at the Alpha’s feet, letting himself getting covered with seed. It felt like it lasted forever, the omega letting out little moans of pleasure as his tongue darted to lap at the rich taste of Alpha come.
The knock sounded through the bunker again as Dean took the stairs two at a time, heart beating in excitement.
Castiel allowed the Alpha to turn him over, arranging him in the now familiar position of being face down with his ass tilted up, offering his hole. Castiel settled in, shivers running down his spine where Dean was petting his back.
“Thank you, Alpha,” Castiel said shyly, already feeling how relaxed and natural he felt, cradled in the metal that would keep him perfectly presented for use.
“You can keep your hands on your thighs, or behind your back,” Dean said, two fingers under the omega’s chin and tilting his face up a bit for a sweet kiss. “If an Alpha approaches you, drop your mouth open and be ready to take a cock down your throat.”
Dean shushed him, soothing the omega with long strokes along his thighs and arms.
“Were you a good little fuck toy for Sam, sweetheart?” Dean asked, already knowing the answer. The other Alpha had spent a solid hour last night pounding the omega into unconsciousness. Dean had heard Castiel’s mewling, animal grunts as he was brutally fucked from every room in the bunker. It’d been pretty hot, and when Sam had delivered Cas back to him, he’d been less an angel and more a drooling puddle of slut.
“Morning, baby,” Dean said, peppering soft kisses along Cas’ neck before pressing his lips against the angel’s eyelids and cheekbones in a featherlight caress.
“You can come as soon as Sam knots you, okay baby?” Dean said, continuing to pet the omega as he whimpered.
“When do you come, baby?” Dean asked, rotating his finger in Cas’ hole and sliding another finger home beside it.
“Come, slut,” Dean said, and Cas' spine jackknifed as he came, every muscle in his body seizing and clenching around Dean, causing the Alpha’s knot to pop.
“Fuck, ungh,” he grunted, before he held Cas against his balls and emptied down his throat, knot catching behind the omega’s teeth. The angel stayed pliant, swallowing Dean’s seed as the Alpha groaned.
“Fuck, baby, you smell like heaven,” Dean groaned, putting his nose right against the angel’s scent gland in his neck and breathing deep. It was partly covered by the collar and Dean wanted to tear it apart with his teeth and replace it with a bite. The omega whimpered, swaying against him. Dean wrapped an arm around the small of Castiel’s back and slid a thigh right between the angel’s legs. He pulled Cas tight against him and licked his neck as the omega moaned. He could feel the omega’s small cock hardening against him.
Castiel blushed and obeyed, moving his pillow and settling at the Alpha’s feet. He leaned into a large, warm thigh and rubbed his cheek into it as Sam unzipped his jeans and brought out his massive cock. The omega whined, mouth opening wider instinctively. He wanted that cock in his mouth.
“I AM your master, sweetheart, but you can call me Dean.”
“Fuck,” Dean hissed and got up so fast he banged his knee against the table.
As if on cue, the dryers behind him let out the buzz that let him know that his loads were done and he spent a few minutes dumping clean, warm clothes into the hampers. He’d drag them upstairs and make himself a sandwich before watching TV and folding.
Dean settled himself solidly on his knees before thrusting his dick all the way into the omega with a loud smack, grabbing the angel’s arms and crossing them at the small of his back, holding on firmly as he rode the whimpering slut into the mattress. Cas was letting out a wrecked grunt every time Dean’s cock slid home, his balls slapping wetly against the pinned omega.
He couldn’t help but smile at the extremely cute sight.
“There’s something wrong with you, you know that?” Dean said, before dropping his hands from Cas’ hips to make a fist for the game. The omega let out a startled yelp as the added pressure caused him to squeeze hard around Dean’s knot. Dean grunted in pleasure and spurted another load into Cas. The pressure on his knot was absolutely fantastic.
“Yes, Alpha,” Castiel murmured, leaning into the hunter before Dean kissed him on the forehead and left him to sit on the pillow like a spoiled pet.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” the omega said, looking up at the Alpha with a flutter of eyelashes. The hunter dropped another kiss right on the sweet blush of Cas’ cheekbone.
“I gotta grab a shower. Put him in my bed and I’ll fuck him once I’ve cleaned up.”
“Damn, Dean, I couldn’t have even been gone an hour!” Sam said, taking in the cock drunk omega. “How did you manage to fuck him completely brainless?”
Didn't want you to have to wait long to find out what Dean had planned for Sam's laundry day! So here it is. Also, look, Sam POV! Something I didn't think I'd ever do lol
Eventually he smelled the sweet tanginess of Dean, and he was being cradled in his Alpha’s strong arms as he fell into something like sleep for the first time in his life. He was home.
“You’re mine, baby,” Dean said, thumbs tracing Cas’ cheekbones before nipping his bottom lip. “Do you understand?”
The beta snapped his fingers in front of Dean’s face and he snarled at him.
They reached the kitchen and Dean gently lowered the angel to the ground near a pillow that was set out.
The omega’s blush intensified, and he slowly shook his head.
Dean immediately shot his brother a shit-eating grin.
Sam could admit it to himself, even if he probably wouldn’t admit it to Dean, getting an omega for their personal use at home had been a great idea.
Dean closed his eyes and threw his head back, settling into a nice steady pace that was slower than normal. Today was about basking. There was no need to rush to orgasm, because Cas was his and he wasn’t going anywhere and Dean could fuck him ten times a day if he wanted to. Right now he was going to savor every sensation of being buried deep in his omega, the scent, the feel, the sound of balls slapping as his omega was spitroasted between two Alphas.
Dean smiled down at the omega, who was completely overwhelmed, whining and rubbing his sweet little dick against Dean’s strong thigh. He was drooling through the ring gag and looking up at the hunter with desperate eyes.
Dean Winchester was not a cuddler, but even he had to admit that waking up with a purring, well-fucked omega in his arms wasn’t the worst thing in the world. He nuzzled his nose against the omega’s neck, basking in the happy pheremones. He pressed his mouth gently over Castiel’s mating mark, nibbling over it before kissing his way up his angel’s smooth neck and grinding his erection against the sleeping omega.
“Alright, Sammy,” Dean said, pulling out. “I never could say no to the puppy eyes.”
“You’re perfect for me, baby,” Dean groaned, getting on his knees so he could wipe the some of the mess from his omega’s eyes and nip at that tempting bottom lip. “Sweet, cock hungry little slut.”
“Mmmm, good boy.” Dean said, deciding the time was right for another finger in his omega’s tight hole, enjoying the jerk of Cas’ hips as he fucked three fingers right into the angel’s sweet spot. Cas was staring up at him, mouth parted and eyes worshipful as he moaned.
“Sam, I don’t say this lightly,” Dean said, still breathing heavily from the intense fuck. “But I am a goddamn genius.”
“I knew it,” Dean said, fucking hard into his pet’s face, knot starting to swell. “Barely got you through the doorway before you started begging for cock, angel.”
He sighed deeply into the other Alpha’s neck and realized that at some point he’d been uncuffed and was again being carried.
“What are you, baby?” Dean asked, squeezing the omega’s waist to hold him still.
The omega smelled Sam’s deep, rich scent and his eyes flew open just in time to see the other Alpha stride into the kitchen and head straight for the omega. Castiel moaned a little, bending instinctively towards the large Alpha and letting his lips fall open in case Sam wanted to use his mouth.
“Good boy,” Dean said, rewarding his good little pet with another stroke of his cock before sliding his middle finger squarely all the way into Cas’ wet cunt, grinding his palm against the omega’s small balls.
Sam shot him one last bitchface as he stomped out of the kitchen.
The Alpha’s big hands stroked through his hair in praise and then left.
“Yes, Alpha,” Cas slurred out, obedient and submissive.
“Come for me, Cas,” the hunter said, slapping the angel’s ass firmly.
“C’mere, Cas,” Dean murmured, and his omega managed to get his palms flat on the couch and move towards Dean on his hands and knees. Sam anchored him with his large hands squeezing the angel’s hips as the hunter continued to fuck him from behind with bone rattling thrusts.
“Do you understand, Cas?” Dean asked again. The omega squirmed against him before saying in a small voice, “you’re going to tell me what I did wrong.”
The beta guy handed him the leash.
Dean chuckled.
I figured if y'all were like me, you could use some distraction today and so I present: porn.
Sam had pretended to roll his eyes when Dean had brought up the idea of having a wanton pet on hand to bust stress, but Dean knew damn well that his moose of a brother felt the same way. For all he wasn’t your typical knothead, Sam was still an Alpha, and Dean had personally witnessed what he was like when he had something sweet wrapped around his dick. Hell, Sam was rougher than Dean was.
Dismissing the beta from his mind, Dean finally, FINALLY was able to turn all of his attention to the pretty little pet who was whimpering against him, the smell of his slick permeating the air around them. Dean carefully undid the ring gag, dropping it to the floor of the bunker. As beautiful as his slut was when gagged, now was not the time.
“What are you here to do, baby?” Dean asked, tightening his grip on the omega’s chin.
Once he had the laundry started, he turned back to his gift with anticipation. The omega was sobbing, and his pussy was so wet it was dripping down the wall. Even though his mouth was stuffed full with a cock gag the omega had drooled over it so much he was sloppy and wet, and his eyes were lidded and cock drunk as he writhed and moaned against his bonds.
He walked into the laundry room and stopped dead, eyes taking in the naked omega bolted to the wall with a growing smile. Sometimes he really did appreciate his jerk of a brother and his skill with a drill.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alpha,” Cas gasped, and then arched again, his legs spread as wide as they went, his toes pointed elegantly. He looked like a goddamn wet dream. He belonged in a magazine spread devoted to how gorgeous he looked taking a dick.
Yeah, Dean could get used to waking up like this.
Sam looked tempted, but waved him off.
I live for comments! Make my day!
“Good boy. Look at me, baby,” Dean said, as Cas looked up at him, pupils totally blown, eyes hazy and cock drunk. Dean slid his hard cock into the omega’s drooling mouth and down his throat, as Cas let out a grateful little grunt.
Dean joined them back on the couch, reaching out and cradling Cas’ head in his palm. Sam released the hand around Castiel’s throat and allowed the omega to lean forward towards Dean. Castiel managed a weak purr in between grunts and rubbed his cheek in Dean’s hand.
“Suck,” Sam said simply and Castiel began sucking the cock deep in his mouth, moaning with pleasure at the taste and feel. He worked his tongue along the hard dick, before the fist in his hair held him still and Sam began fucking his face, hard, balls slapping against his chin. The omega tried his best not to choke as he was brutally face fucked, tears gathering in his eyes, and his body went completely slack, allowing the Alpha to use his mouth.
He got to his knees and rolled the omega over without preamble, manhandling him until Cas was in a perfect presentation, ass high in the air, knees spread wide to display his wet cunt, and face smushed into the bed with his hands tied at the small of his back. Perfectly helpless.
Dean was content to hold still, his erection growing as he watched with amusement as the desperate slut beneath him became more and more frantic, whimpers turning into moans as he worked his hips. Dean reached down and grabbed Castiel, holding him still and causing the angel to cry out in protest. Those blue eyes locked onto Dean, wordlessly begging him.
Sam amused himself for a few minutes coaxing a symphony of different noises out of the omega with his fingers, especially enjoying the high yelp he got with three fingers in the omega’s pussy and his thumb stroking over his tiny cock.
Dean dropped a kiss on Cas’ nose and felt the omega’s eyelashes kiss the skin of Dean’s neck.
“Fine, but you’re cleaning the kitchen, jerk,” Sam said, leaning back in his chair and watching the omega’s eyes roll back in his head as Dean slid all the way home.
Grabbing the pan he’d made eggs in off the stove, he gave it a cursory scrub before rinsing it off. He’d wash the dishes more fully later, but right now he had an omega that no longer had a dick inside him to get back to.
“I’m… here to be fucked,” Cas said, stumbling over the words.
“Really, Dean?” Sam said, his bitchface making him look like he’d sucked a lemon. “We eat here!”
He let out a mournful little wail and twitched his hips up, wanting to be filled again. As sated as his body felt from being so well used by the pair of Alphas, it no longer felt right to be so hollow. His hole was still fluttering from his orgasm, trying to clench around a cock that wasn’t there. He whimpered again, feeling cold now that his Alpha’s warmth had left him alone.
“Be good, baby,” Dean said affectionately. “I know you will be.”
Turning back to the table he ducked his head and took in the sight of Castiel, purring and leaning into Sam’s leg, looking every inch a happy omega as Sam ran fingers through his messy hair.
“Fuck!” Dean said, grinding his knot deep. “Fuck, that’s good.” He collapsed over the omega beneath him, enjoying the feel of Cas’ smaller form pressed against him skin to skin. The angel was wrecked beneath him, eyes dazed and his mouth open, little whimpers being punched out from the omega’s mouth with every spurt of come into his well-fucked pussy.
Leaving one hand wrapped around the omega’s wrists, he grabbed Cas’ hair with the other and pressed his face firmly into the mattress, leaving the angel arched obscenely.
Dean leaned back, letting the omega’s face up from the mattress, and listened to him wail with every sharp thrust.
Castiel moaned and pushed his hips up, only to be held down firmly by the Alpha. He lay quivering in anticipation, hole fluttering, before he finally felt the blunt edge of a cock nudge at his rim. Then he was filled in one long, firm stroke and ohhhhhhhh, that is what he needed. That’s what he had been missing. He was incomplete without it. Dean was not small by any means, but the cock inside him was even larger, hitting spots inside him he hadn’t even known existed.
“Alright, dude, Christ!” Dean yelped, rubbing his shoulder.
Sam let out an appreciative rumble and removed his fingers, pulling out a chair and sitting comfortably.
The angel could hear Dean rustling around him, and then leaving the room. He felt weak with pleasure but forced his limbs to respond and managed to get on his knees, before letting his hips settle and tucking his arms beneath his body, presenting his hole for use. Dean had said this was the position he should be in when he was waiting to be fucked, maybe it would entice the Alpha into filling him with a fat cock.
