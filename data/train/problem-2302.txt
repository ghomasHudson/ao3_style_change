“John, what’s wrong with you? You’re acting weird, well weird for you anyway…” Harry rolled her eyes and laughed.
Most of the party goers had cleared out well before the explosion and only the boys and a few passers by were still there.
“Well yeah.” John could not be bothered by Mike’s observations. His heart was hammering in his chest as he searched the crowd. With so many students’ milling about, all in a hurry, all busy unloading cars it would be impossible to find any one person, even if that person was as distinctive looking as Sherlock Holmes.
He dreaded turning around, but as he trudged along with his head down against the rain, he realized he was fighting a losing battle against the elements.
“Something?” Sherlock shook John slightly by the shoulder, jogging him to explain before he fell asleep and the observation was lost.
First things first. There's an assignment tonight that I hadn't anticipated. Bugger. So I get right down to it. I'm supposed to be on my best behavior. The alternatives for not complying are dismal.
He thinks I'm getting back into drugs when I'm not. It was unfortunate that he wouldn't listen when I tried to explain that Jim actually
Luckily, they have some leftover Thai that they reheated. No sense to leave food in the fridge when they will be away visiting Sherlock's family for the better part of a week. John was quiet all through dinner, his mind elsewhere. It was difficult to keep up with Sherlock's detailed explanation of his latest experiment-- the one that went wrong in the flat just moments ago.
"That said, you've certainly created a stir in London with your CCTV stunt. I'll have to come up with a suitable explanation for why it was necessary. I'm beginning to see why you and my brother are....friends."
“Oh right, sorry, that’s Angelo--he’s always like that, he never takes my money.” Sherlock waved a hand in the air.  “Let’s get a bottle of wine, then! My brother prefers sangiovese, but I’d rather have a pinot noir, especially if you are getting tomato sauce.”
Thankfully, there was no one on the floor tonight. Maybe everyone was at the pub. We've been lucky, Sherlock and I. No one thinks, um-- no one suspects--well--
The kid in the hoodie spoke as they left. "John, my offer still stands. I can explain. Meet me here," he tossed something small to John who caught it.
shown up at places where Sherlock (and I, truth be told) were...coincidence? Maybe, but there were more pressing questions.
The test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.
"That's not a code, that's a name." He almost whispers and walks over to a desk and picks up a black phone.
In my free time, I  wandered to Camden Market--force of habit. And as luck would have it, didn't run into any of my previous
“And you're telling me this because you know how I love football….” Sherlock's  arms remained stubbornly crossed in front of him
John met Mary Morstan the first week of uni, she was in all of his classes, anatomy, physiology, dissection. They just seemed to fall in together--along with Molly and Stamford--they formed a little study group.
During the siege, I was on the floor, flat on my stomach, a jack booted thug pointing a gun at my head-- his foot firmly planted between my shoulder blades.
a novelty item, but in the end the toys were surprisingly strong--see here there's a cut in the wrist, were the victim was struggling--before he was killed."
John moved in with Sherlock and Mike. Mike got out of hospital and was on the mend quickly. John slowly replaced all of his books and clothes that were destroyed in the explosion. For the first few weeks, the phone at the flat rang off the hook, much to the dismay of Sherlock, who after a very short while, refused to answer. Friends called, professors called, the football team called, girls called. Everyone wanted to talk to John and Mike about what happened.
“Maybe it’s the girl from Harvard? That should be fun. You can tease him.” John says as he lays back down on the pillow, closing his eyes and smiling to himself.
"Why not? Something special about this party? Invite only?" Sherlock smiled and pulled off his vest and stood in front of John with no shirt on. Sherlock's jean's hung low on his hips, and his long curly dark hair touched his collar bones in the front. They stood there a moment in silence as Sherlock watched John's eyes wander from his face to his lips, then collar bones and chest. John flushed pink and looked away before his eyes wandered anywhere else.
John whispers up at Sherlock. He doesn't seem as drunk as he was before.  "It's a problem I have, have always had."
His Dad looked at him in surprise and Harriet started to snicker, and he turned and threw his napkin at her. It landed harmlessly in the middle of the table.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I moved over and sat right next to him, the edge of my right thigh touching the edge of his. His leg was warm. Our shoulders were touching.
Sherlock nods his head in acknowledgement, although he's certainly not diligent enough with his health and wellbeing to actually do as John says. He's barely even heard it, because certain other senses seem to have overridden his sense of hearing.
When the silence stretched between them for another moment or two, Mycroft got to his feet, making his way to the door to take his leave. However, when he reached the door, he hesitated, one hand on the door handle. He looked over his shoulder.
John's laptop is still sitting open on the bed beside John, and Sherlock moves quietly to pick it up and move it so that there is no risk of John rolling over in his sleep and landing on top of it. The moment the laptop is off the bed, the change in the distribution of weight over the mattress causes John to shift and roll over, curling into the warm spot that the laptop has left behind.
His mother, on the other hand, doesn't seem to notice. Instead, she says, "Oh, how lovely. How long have they been together?"
Sherlock sends the project to the printer, and then he creeps downstairs – carefully sneaking past his mother's room – to collect it. He staples it, flicks through to make sure that all of their graphs and diagrams have not moved positions without them noticing it, and then he returns to his room.
Unfortunately, his mother manages to get the next few words in before they can leave the room. "Of course," she says. "John is welcome to stay as long as he likes. In fact, John, would you like to stay for dinner?"
Sherlock is pleased, because proving that he is intelligent and achieving results on something that he did dedicate a lot of time and effort to is satisfying. Mostly, however, Sherlock is satisfied because of the bright, shocked-yet-ecstatic look that comes over John's face when their professor hands their paper back.
"I don't know what she thinks gives her the right to talk to you like that," John says, shoving open the door at the end of the hall with his shoulder. "I mean, how dare she treat you like that?"
He raises his fist to knock, and then hesitates, and lowers it again. Maybe it is better that John does not see him like this. Plus, John does not live alone, and the last thing Sherlock wants is for someone like John's sister or John's father to open the door instead.
doesn't disobey John's instructions, simply because his eye is far too bruised for his poking and prodding to make it any worse.)
Mycroft remains quiet for a moment, but apparently, 'I told you so' was the extent that Mycroft actually has to say. A moment later, he gets to his feet. "You knew better, Sherlock, and yet you let yourself care anyway. You brought this on yourself."
Molly Hooper from biology pulls him aside after class one day, and Sherlock knows what she is going to say before she has opened her mouth. It's obvious in her body language, in the redness in her cheeks and the way she fiddles with her hair, twirling it around her finger.
John, however, has a different view. He cuts off his words mid-sentence and whirls around on Sally. "I think you're supposed to apologise when you run into someone, not insult them," he says.
Come on, Sherlock. You won't know what you're missing unless you go. Maybe it would be nice for you to have some fond memories to look back on.
Sherlock is aware that this is the kind of deduction that is more likely to get him hurt. He expects John to tell him as much, to say something along the lines of, 'Well, that would be why he hit you, then.'
John probably would mind. That kind of position, that kind of contact, is not socially acceptable for friends. It should be socially acceptable for friends. Sherlock would like to be that close to John, physically, even though they are not romantically involved.
They get in a routine of taking lunch together. At first, it is only on the days that their chemistry class is immediately before their lunch break, but as time goes on, it becomes more frequent. It's easy for Sherlock to memorise John's schedule, to know where his classes finish and where he is likely to take lunch on any one day. Sometimes, Sherlock runs into him by chance, because the school is not huge and people tend to stick to the same few areas at lunch time. Sometimes, Sherlock goes to a certain location where he thinks John might be on purpose. After a month or so has passed, it becomes the norm for them to find one another after class.
When they don't have assessments, sometimes John will help Sherlock with the experiments that he chooses to run on his own, just for fun.
They could use the school library instead, but even if they can get past the noise, they will only have an hour before closing time. It feels like the entire school is against them – of course the chemistry lab would be closed on the same day that the library closes early.
Immediately, thoughts spring to Sherlock's mind on how to respond, on how to deny it without making it seem like a lie. He's a good liar, he always has been. John will believe him, and they will move onto the next movie and they never have to have this conversation. Their friendship will not suffer; Sherlock will not ruin a perfectly good friendship with icky, messy feelings. However, though Sherlock opens his mouth, the words do not, or cannot, reach his lips. After a moment, he closes his mouth and hangs his head, eyes on his lap.
He turns to take his leave, but he gets no more than a few steps towards the path before the door opens behind him, and he hears John's voice.
Given the fact that we live in a day and age that gives us access to mobile phones and the internet, if I did miss anyone – which is highly unlikely – I would be able to get in touch with them later. I do not need to go to formal to say goodbye.
He walks home, hyper-aware of the pain in his face and not so aware of where it is that he is actually going. He hasn't realised that he has taken the route to John's house instead of his own home until he finds himself standing on John's doorstep.
Sherlock had not been looking forward to Christmas in the first place, when his mother had first brought up the idea, but somehow, the knowledge that John could have been with him but will not be makes it even more unbearable.
John looks different this time to the way he normally looks when they watch movies. He does not seem as engrossed in it as he usually does. He looks distracted, and almost tense.
They get through a fair amount of work before Sherlock's mother calls them for dinner. The work provides a distraction, and Sherlock temporarily forgets his concerns. However, once he hears his mother's voice, he is again filled with dread. He does not want to sit through dinner. He does not want to listen to his mother talk about how nice it is that Sherlock has finally made a friend, after so many years without one. He does not want to hear his mother praise John for being a nice young man, because John is everything Sherlock is not, everything Sherlock should be. Sherlock does not want to sit through these conversations. He does not want to hear how John responds.
Sherlock is used to staying awake – if he needs to, he can go days with a minimal amount of sleep – but John does not have the same experience. Even after two cups of coffee, Sherlock can see the way John is starting to drift off over the top of his laptop, each blink getting a little bit longer. The fact that he opted to sit on the end of Sherlock's bed probably isn't helping, but the desk is not big enough for two.
It's not that he does not want John's company. On the contrary, John is one of the few people whose presence Sherlock can actually stand. However, if John stays for dinner, it's not just him and Sherlock. It's John, and Sherlock, and Sherlock's parents, and Sherlock's mother is talkative. She might ask questions, or tell stories. She might say something embarrassing. She might say something about how Sherlock has never had any friends before. John might leave dinner tonight with the belief that Sherlock is someone to be pitied. Sherlock is
And with that, John turns, taking quick strides away from Sally before she has the chance to reply. Sally stares at Sherlock for a moment, before letting out a disgruntled sigh and storming away herself.
Mycroft found him a couple of hours later, knees to his chest and arms wrapped around his legs. Mycroft did not turn on the light when he entered, but simply shut the door behind him and took a seat at the end of Sherlock's bed. He did not speak, instead waiting for Sherlock to break the silence when he was ready.
John shoots him a glare. "I'll get more coffee, and then I'll be awake," he says, and he steps out of the room to pour another cup before Sherlock can tell him that even the coffee might be a lost cause now.
John's eyes focus on Sherlock's face, carefully dabbing away the blood with the washcloth. It hurts, because Sherlock's face is bruised and tender, but John is excessively gentle. Sherlock distracts himself by focusing on John's eyes, watching as they move to different spots on Sherlock's face. They're almost crossed, so that John can see him while he's sitting so close.
It's not just the nodding-off-then-starting-awake kind of sleep that John had been drifting towards earlier. He has lain himself down on the edge of Sherlock's bed, curled up with his head pillowed on his arm. He does not so much as stir even when Sherlock pushes the door shut behind him.
"For the cleverest person I know, you can be remarkably oblivious at times," John says, which makes Sherlock drop his gaze a little in embarrassment.
John shrugs. "I was going to come back this weekend anyway, so I figured I might as well make it a day earlier. Besides, no one should be alone on formal night. Even geniuses who think they're too good for formals." He peers past Sherlock's shoulder, and then asks, "Can I come in, or are you busy?"
Just go to formal, Sherlock. I had a really good time at mine and I don't want you to miss out on that. - JW
Sherlock cannot help but wonder what John would do if Sherlock were to lean into him. Would he instinctively move away, or would he allow Sherlock to sit closer? Would John do anything if Sherlock were to, seemingly unintentionally, slouch against John's side, pressed together from shoulders to hips? Would John mind if Sherlock leaned his head on John's shoulder?
"That doesn't make it okay!" John says, raising his voice slightly. It's clear that John is far more angered by Sally's behaviour than Sherlock himself is – despite the fact that the behaviour in question had been directed towards Sherlock and not John.
"God, you're out of it, aren't you?" John says, returning to his task of cleaning Sherlock's face now that he has Sherlock's attention. "I hope these guys didn't give you a concussion."
Sherlock wants to scoff, at first, because that's nonsense, until his mind catches up and he actually understands what that sentence means. From anyone else, it's nonsense. From the only person who Sherlock has ever felt this way for, it's something else entirely. His mind screeches to a halt, and finally, he draws his gaze away from his knees to look at John, staring at him with what he knows must be an awestruck expression on his face.
"Then why did they get married? Why does anyone get married, or bother falling in love, if it will only end in broken hearts?"
And again with the capital letters. Are you hoping that repeating it enough will make me change my mind?
, he writes one day when he catches Sherlock fiddling with his phone underneath his desk. Sherlock thinks for a moment that John is genuinely frustrated with Sherlock's behaviour, until he catches the ghost of a smile that is playing on John's lips.
John soaks the washcloth in the bowl, wrings it out, and then leans forward. He holds the washcloth in one hand, and with the other, he gently frames Sherlock's face. Sherlock knows that this is to hold him steady, to stop Sherlock from turning his head away from the washcloth. He tries not to think about the intimacy of the touch, the warmth of John's palm against the line of his jaw, both firm and gentle.
"Convenience, usually. Divorces are messy, expensive, and complicated. Sometimes, couples will just decide that they can stand one another enough to stay together, if it means they can avoid all the legal complications such as custody battles and..." He trailed off, and then looked down at Sherlock over his nose. "Well, I don't expect you to understand any of that."
He wonders what John is doing right now. He knows he shouldn't think about it, but he cannot help himself. He wonders if he's sitting around the table, making small talk with his girlfriend's parents, presenting himself as the perfect boyfriend that Sherlock knows John must be. He wonders what John's girlfriend's parents think about John. Do they consider him a lovely young man, just like Sherlock's own mother does? Are they pleased that their daughter has decided to date someone so perfect?
You'd do really well in a chem degree. And you'd enjoy it a lot more than school. So much of it is self-directed, you'd get the chance to make your own experiments all the time.
A moment ago you were convinced I was above feelings, now you're convinced that there is someone I secretly want to ask to formal.
He's lucky, staying at home, because he has the place to himself. His parents had booked some sort of overnight trip on the night of formal, likely under the assumption that Sherlock would actually go. The idea that they assumed that for even a second is ridiculous, but maybe his parents were holding onto some sort of wishful thinking. All the same, they do not cancel their trip at the discovery that Sherlock will be home that night, not when Sherlock insists that he's fine and would rather be alone anyway. He has the house to himself, which is ideal.
"Only applies to innocent people," John says calmly, and Sherlock has absolutely no idea how serious John is being.
"We're almost done," Sherlock points out, "and even if I wasn't working on this, I would probably stay up anyway. Sleeping is tedious. There's always something more interesting to do."
Sherlock considers pressing the topic, but it turns out, it's not necessary. John grabs the remote next to him and mutes the television, before turning so he is facing Sherlock.
Sherlock cannot make out the emotions in John's voice, but he can imagine what they must be. Discomfort. Disgust. John is kind, and good, and won't openly confess to feeling this way, but this will ruin them all the same. John won't consciously decide to stop being Sherlock's friend because Sherlock desires more, but he will pull away unconsciously. Perhaps he'll even feel guilty for not feeling the same way. Texts will become more infrequent, conversations will become more impersonal. Maybe John will be excessively wary of hurting Sherlock's feelings, and will stop saying some of the things they would talk about now. They will drift apart. This will end.
"Don't do that," he says sternly. "Wait here, I'll go get my first-aid kit. Try not to make it any worse."
"Okay," John says, going through his bag. "So, I brought a few different movies, and popcorn, and a few boxes of tea because I have serious doubts about the adequacy of your tea collection here..."
"That it's fine?" Sherlock says wryly. He cannot feel reassured by the words. Of course John would insist that it is fine. John is a good person, and John isn't going to judge Sherlock for liking boys. However, that doesn't mean that the fact that Sherlock likes John, specifically, won't mean that John starts to treat Sherlock differently. John says it's fine, but it's not, and Sherlock might lose the only friendship in his life that has ever been worth anything to him.
He only ends up texting back when John starts a conversation with something completely unrelated to their last conversation – John texts about a part of his chemistry homework that he is struggling with. Sherlock is not stupid – Sherlock knows that John intentionally chose that topic of conversation because it's something that Sherlock is comfortable discussing, unrelated to the one thing Sherlock will not discuss, and thus the most likely topic that would lead Sherlock to text back. It works, only because Sherlock does not like not talking to John, either.
Sherlock does not want to work with anyone else, but he also does not want to work with this boy. He does not want to work with
"You can go to sleep," Sherlock says, causing John to start with surprise and then shake his head as though to wake himself up."
The closer formal gets, the harder it is to avoid hearing about it. Sherlock catches girls giggling to themselves in corners, flocking together in packs, apparently making it hard for boys to approach them. He sees couples start talking about how they're going to dress – apparently there is some need to colour code pocket squares and formal dresses. When the girls start buying their own dresses, suddenly laptop and phone screens and filled with images of people showing theirs off.
Sherlock finishes the last mouthful of his dinner and excuses himself so that he doesn't have to hear any more of this.
Somehow, without Sherlock really noticing what John is doing, John takes control of the situation. He moves the focus of conversation away from Sherlock, turning it to Sherlock's mother herself. He asks her about what she does for a living, and shows a genuine interest when she tells him that she's a mathematician. He asks about her work, her books, her publications. He does not sound like he is interrogating her, but instead is just making conversation, asking questions and showing genuine interest in the answers. It does not seem to bother Sherlock's mother. In fact, she seems flattered that someone has taken such a keen interest in her, and it keeps the conversation flowing.
I thought it was best to avoid John. Maybe if I didn't see him, I wouldn't be so angry. In my fit of pique, I fell asleep early in the evening, so I was wide awake at about 3 am.
"Don't go." he stared at me, eyes piercing, voice low and dark. "Fun's just getting started." he took the empty out of my hand and motioned to someone to get more drinks.
Not entirely aware of the time, he hit the buzzer on the door of 221 Baker Street, flat B. He leaned on the buzzer a little too long.
They squint at the screens, rubbing their eyes occasionally. The half empty styrofoam coffee cups at their elbows are from early this morning. The paper signs that read 'Please do not eat or drink at the desk." has been ignored.
The meeting at the Yard was extraordinary also. Sherlock was on first name basis with many of the detectives, when he could remember their names.
John turns back again to see Sherlock, of all people, on the floor, wrestling with the younger of the two boys, who is squealing and laughing and turning red. John watches Sherlock jump up from the floor with a frightened look on his face. He turns to John with an imploring look, “It’s ok Sherlock really-- you can’t hurt them that way, they are really quite sturdy at this age.” John watches himself call out.  Thus reassured, Sherlock and the younger one immediately return to the pretend wrestling match. As John watches the spectacle, he isn't sure who is having more fun, the 4 year old or Sherlock.
"It's a shame that John couldn't make it, isn't it?" she says. She doesn't take the hint from Sherlock's silence that this is not something Sherlock wants to discuss. "I suppose he wanted to spend Christmas with his family, didn't he?"
Sherlock's excitement lasts up until he gets a reply to the invitation text. John already has plans for Christmas with his girlfriend and her family.
"I don't think it's because he likes me as much as it's because I don't treat him like you do," John replies without hesitation. "I don't know, maybe if you tried treating him a bit better, you'd both get along."
In addition – less a deduction, more an observation – Sherlock discovers that John is a particularly unusual person when it comes to the way he treats Sherlock.
"No, Sherlock," Mycroft said, and Sherlock knew in that second that his older brother had already made the same deduction that Sherlock had verbalised. Sherlock was not the first to realise this, he was only the first to say it out loud. The tone that Mycroft used was one that Sherlock was unfortunately very familiar with. It was the one Mycroft used whenever Sherlock had been a particularly stupid little boy. Mycroft continued, "You're far too young to understand adult relationships. You should have kept your mouth shut."
John breaks up with his girlfriend a little after New Year's Day. Sherlock deduces that John would have done so sooner, because their uncomfortable Christmas together must have made it clear that they were not as compatible as partners should be, but John is a kind enough person to not let his now ex-girlfriend associate the time between Christmas and New Years with a breakup. The added bonus is that John and his girlfriend break up on fairly amicable turns – as it turns out, John's girlfriend had not enjoyed Christmas together either.
The number of students in the class had not been Sherlock's concern. He clarifies, "I work better on my own." After a moment's thought, he adds, "I'm in this class so that I can challenge myself. Let me challenge myself by completing the project on my own."
Sherlock never has to censor himself, with John. Mind, Sherlock has never censored himself with anyone, but in most cases, this usually leads to people calling him some variation of 'Freak' and walking away. John never walks away, and John never tells Sherlock to piss off when he makes deductions (either about John or about someone else). On the contrary – often, when Sherlock makes deductions, John will say something like "Amazing" or "Fantastic" or some other such word that makes something warm and light blossom in Sherlock's chest. Sherlock knows that he is clever, but so many of his deductions are with regards to things that are so blindingly obvious and unbearably simple to him, he has never believed that they are anything to be awestruck by.
You had a really good time at yours because you managed to convince Mary to go with you. She was all you talked about for weeks.
Sherlock knows. He's had plenty of experience with that particular classmate's behaviour, and the behaviour of his friends – often directed towards Sherlock himself. Regardless, Sherlock says, "I see little point in paying attention to what other people say about me."
It sounds unbelievably childish coming from his own lips. It's probably one of the least intelligent things he has ever said in his life, and yet he feels the need to say it all the same.
Sherlock wonders, as John walks away, if John knew what Sherlock was going to say there too, even though Sherlock hardly knew himself.
As soon as these thoughts enter his mind, Sherlock realises he's not actually sure why John pitying him is such a problem. He does not need pity, but he has never cared what people think of him before, not really. With John, it feels different. He concludes that it's simply the fact that they have to continue to work together for another few months, and their ability to do so will be impaired if John starts pitying him.
are the ones who should be pitied for being born with such small IQs. John, however, won't understand that.
A few weeks prior to Christmas, Sherlock realised that there is one thing that would make the party much less unbearable.
This much is made clear one day at lunch. They wander side-by-side through the hall, engrossed in conversation. Although Sherlock's attention is primarily on John and what they are talking about, Sherlock is always aware of his surroundings at least to some extent. It does not escape his notice that Sally Donovan, walking in the opposite direction to them, changes directions just enough so that she can shove Sherlock's shoulder as she walks past.
That's Sherlock speak for "I too would be happy but I'm not going to say that because emotions are below me".
It's nothing extravagant, and involves no more than their immediate family, but it's certainly not something they do every year. When Sherlock asks why they're bothering, his mother gives him some nonsense about Christmas time being family time, and with Mycroft now off and working in the real world like a proper adult, and Sherlock beginning his search for universities for next year, she thinks it's a good time for them to all get together.
So they work together on projects in the chemistry class they share, and they even take to helping one another in their other classes too. They can bounce ideas off each other when planning independent projects, and they study together for exams. Sherlock helps John with memory techniques and quizzes him in the lead-up to exams to keep him on his toes. John helps Sherlock by proofreading his essays and pointing out all the areas where Sherlock had begun assuming too much knowledge in his audience and has skipped ahead and is not making sense.
Silence stretches between them for a moment, until Mycroft is the one to break it. "I did warn you, Sherlock," he says. "You knew from the start that this was a risk."
"It hardly matters," Sherlock says. "I do not hold her opinion in high enough esteem to care what she thinks of me."
"It's not pity. I just feel like you'd work better with someone who doesn't act like some of the people in our class do, and
"You're aware that people generally tell me to piss off when I make deductions," Sherlock says, his voice catching mid-sentence as John touches a particularly tender part of his face and makes him wince. He recovers quickly. "Sometimes, people tell me to piss off without words."
It's not just about the way John looks, however. It's so much more than that. Sherlock has heard in the past that it is a person's personality that makes them beautiful, and once upon a time, he would have thought this is ridiculous. Regardless of a person's personality, their facial features remain constant. Whether they are kind or rude has no bearing on that. However, the more Sherlock gets to know John, he realises that he was wrong about this. John is warm, and kind, and good, and it's like it shines through his skin and makes him glow. Physically, John is attractive, but his personality turns him into something that's far more breathtaking.
"You'd be the only one who could," Sherlock says, and then he kisses away the next words that reach John's lips.
Sherlock purses his lips, considering. Unfortunately, this boy is right. His professor has made it absolutely clear that Sherlock is not allowed to work alone. So, if Sherlock
It's a few moments later when John finishes cleaning Sherlock's face, and he puts the washcloth down into the bowl. "Well," he says. "You're slightly less likely to give your mother a heart attack now. Slightly." A beat, and he adds, "Your eye will hurt for a while. The only thing I can recommend is icing it to help the swelling go down."
Sherlock sticks to his word. Come lunch time, he makes his way to the library, just as planned. The boy is already there when Sherlock arrives, sitting at one of the tables. He raises his hand in greeting, to get Sherlock's attention, and Sherlock heads straight over to him. He slides into the seat across from the boy, without returning the boy's smile.
The boy tilts his head to the side, an expectant look on his face, but when Sherlock does not speak, he says, "Why don't you meet me in the library at lunch? We can talk through our ideas for the project, and then you can decide if you want to work with me or if you'd rather work with someone else."
– a look that Sherlock cannot quite name, but it makes Sherlock feel warm and makes Sherlock want to keep making deductions, just so that John will keep looking at him that way.
Sherlock has tried to look at girls, to see what John sees when John looks at them. When he thinks about it, Sherlock can acknowledge that some girls are aesthetically pleasing. He knows that there are certain features that are generally accepted to be attractive; he can acknowledge that there is something pleasing about the symmetry of a girl's face or the smoothness of her skin. However, this is as far as his acknowledgement goes. He can acknowledge when John might find a girl attractive, but Sherlock is not attracted to them himself. How pretty a girl is does not even catch Sherlock eyes automatically. When Sherlock meets someone – girls, boys, anyone – he immediately collects data to make deductions, based off the way they dress or the way they hold themselves. How pretty they are does not give Sherlock any data to work with.
The statement sheds no light on the situation, and Sherlock furrows his brows, simultaneously intrigued and inexplicably nervous. "All right?" he says, making it sound more like a question than a statement.
When he reaches John's side, he realises that the reason why John is walking away so swiftly is not merely because John wanted to make a dramatic exit. John is genuinely angry.
At last, Sherlock asked, "Isn't it better that she knows?" His voice was quiet, hoarse. His tone reflected the unspoken question beneath his words:
"Party," John answered absentmindedly, staring at his phone until Sherlock snatched it out of his hand and walked away with it. "Hey!" John made a grab for the phone but Sherlock had already looked through John's texts. "I know that address. I'm coming with you."  he shoved John's phone in his own pocket and walked back to the bedroom. John followed.
And there stood Sherlock in the doorway, slightly unsteady on his feet, coat just hanging around his shoulders, but not quite on his body. "Hello," he said smiling, "Well, I guess I'm at the right place. I think I recognize you two." He pointed at them, squinting.
He stared out the dirty bus window, not able to see London speed by. Mary held on to his hand during the trip, but he wasn't aware of her warm hand at all.
There was nothing for it. Was it the early morning hour, the slight hangover nagging at my temples or my foul mood? I put on my clothes and seething with anger that came from an unknown source, left John's room.
"Did something happen while we were gone? John, you're not making any sense." his father asked, irritated.
She tossed her pretty head back and laughed. "You know, he loves you so much, he'd probably kill someone for you."
John and Mike both looked each other with unguarded shock and concern. This was a surprise. Mike knew where John was last night, but no one knew where Sherlock had been. john didn't realize that Sherlock was out at all. Had he been out all night? By the looks of it, that's just what happened.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. As far as John knew, trouble was Sherlocks middle name. He thrived on trouble. He lived for it. But John fought too hard to get here, to this university, and even though Sherlock was important to John, he didn’t want to get sucked down the rabbit hole of Sherlocks chaos.
He would never talk about himself. He was pretty cagey when I asked him what he was reading at uni or which university housing he lived in. He would change the subject, so I stopped asking.
“Are you saying that they are plagiarized?” Now this he could sink his teeth into. Completely against university policy. Clear cut rules, if broken, had clear cut consequences.  Things were looking better already
John led him down the hallway and into the bedroom and he fell onto the bed face down, shirt sleeve still buttoned, shirt trailing on the floor. John reached to pick the shirt up and unbutton it from Sherlock’s wrist. He tossed it over a chair and went to get a bucket. Placing the bucket at the side of the bed near Sherlock's head, he felt his wrist to check his radial pulse. It was rapid and bounding. He made some quick mental calculations--suspicious that alcohol was not the only thing Sherlock had consumed the night before. Sure, he could be dehydrated from drinking, but John had a sneaking suspicion that Sherlock could possibly have some exotic pastimes.
"Ah, there you are, John." Sherlock stood in the hallway enroute to his bedroom, small smile playing on his lips.  "For a brief moment, I was afraid we were on our way to the A&E. Don't want to be frequenters there. "
He asked question after question. John knew very little about me and I preferred to keep it that way. I deflected his questions about me by telling him things about his friends.
It was end of term, everyone would be going home tomorrow for break, there were parties all over the university. John was out with Mary and her crowd. It got late and they went to another late night pub, it was dark and John insisted that this was his last beer, he wanted to go, Mary didn’t seem to want to leave. They were in the back in a quiet booth sitting with Irene and Jim--whom he had taken a dislike to.
"Well that's just what I meant, he's been at it all day--" she started to explain, "John, maybe now that your home, if you'd just-just talk to him maybe..." of course, John knew who she was talking about and why she was so worried, he nodded to her gravely and bounded up the stairs two at a time. He opened the door to his flat. John knew exactly why Mrs. Hudson was worried.
As we walked back from the curry place, we passed Sherlock's school. I looked up at the building wondering which window was his.
John's new relationship with Mary was going well. She was such a ball of fire. For a nursing student, she hung out with loads of studious but hard drinking students. Mary introduced him to Irene, Janeen and Jim. They were out every weekend (and a few week nights, too.) John found it difficult to keep up the pace--not with classes and football too.
John was very quiet on his end of the phone. He had no justification for his actions. He had no words to explain himself.
The week had been slow, the weather bad, cold freezing drizzle making venturing outside a chore. I sat in front of the fire, shoes off, dressing gown on, reading a dry scientific journal-dry even for me.
"John, I,  um…" Sherlock began softly, quietly, not knowing what to say but wanting to offer some kind of comfort.
Sherlock is never quiet when he tries to get his point across--he just keeps going. I should have let him explain himself, instead of jumping all over him. I never should have let myself get so angry.
Sherlock sighed and slowly removed the cloth. His shirt was ruined. John whistled at the sight of the laceration on his forehead. At the edge of his right eyebrow was just about a 10cm gaping cut, still oozing blood. "That's gonna leave a scar, mate."
“Well, he sighed. “It’s really quite a long story that I’ll tell you sometime I reckon, but I can’t now, sorry. How is Harry?”
"Respite's over,"  Sherlock whispered. "Come on John, back into the fray," Sherlock reached for John's arm to guide him out of the WC.
I placed the electronic ankle tag and it's homing base in a carton I had lying around and brought it to the meeting. Turns out, I shouldn't have done, Lestrade was to remove it from my leg, officially.
I turned around suddenly and practically shouted at him, "What the FUCK is going on, Sherlock?" My anger getting the better of my need to be careful that he was in my room in the wee hours of the morning. I winced after I realized that the entire floor could have heard me. Probably heard me. Definately heard me.
John watches the scene that occurred just this very evening, as he follows himself up the steps to the flat. 'John' coming home to find the flat a mess, Sherlock in the kitchen, so happy and relieved to see him, just to get scolded. An abrupt dinner and then John off to bed.
Sherlock slowed down, lungs on fire. He could probably take the next block as a walk. John likely went home with Mary and they could just have it out in the morning. Or even better yet, in a few more blocks, Sherlock could take the tube to Mycroft’s. School was over for the term.
I saw a dark mark on the side of his neck, near his collarbone. I hadn't seen anything there before.
My friends--all whom I've met just this week, were in high spirits. If I was being honest with myself, my thoughts were all over the place about Fresher's Week at uni.
Sherlock hesitates, and then he sits. He still doesn't meet John's eyes. He doesn't want to see the discomfort on his face.
Sherlock has always known that John likes girls. Anyone who pays even a little bit of attention to John would know this. John's gaze shifts whenever an aesthetically-pleasing girl walks past. He talks to girls in a different way to the way he talks to boys – it takes Sherlock a while, but he eventually realises that the difference is that when he talks to girls, he is flirting. John leans a little bit closer, smiles a little bit brighter, finds extra excuses to touch their arms or to take their hands in his. Sherlock would also guess that John's heart rate speeds up when he is around girls, too, but Sherlock has never been physically close enough to John while he's around a girl to confirm this.
John abandons his seat at the front of the class, in favour of sitting next to Sherlock instead. He's still just as attentive and as studious as he was when he was sitting at the front, still taking notes about whatever their professor says, but in between writing those notes he can now get away with writing notes to Sherlock in the margins of his page.
Sherlock doesn't like to consider himself to be a jealous person. He knows he should not be jealous, because John is not and never would be his, and even if he wasn't dating Sarah, or Jeanette, or the one with the spots, or the one with the dog, he would not be dating Sherlock. Plus, all the girls that John dates are so much less intelligent than Sherlock, so they are nothing to be jealous about. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt, when John chooses to spend time with them and Sherlock is on his own.
As the weeks progress, Sherlock's meetings with John become more and more frequent. They switch from lunchtime meetings to afternoon meetings, because that affords them more time to work on their project. They make use of the chemistry lab, because it remains unlocked after school for at least a couple of hours (something Sherlock discovered when he first started high school and something he has used to his advantage ever since). It's nicer than working in the library, as many of the other students at the school do not realise that the library should be used as a study area and not a social area. That, and the library also closes a few hours after the end of school, whereas the chemistry lab is sometimes open much later – depending on how long it takes the cleaners to get in and lock up.
Mycroft gives Sherlock a look, too, whenever Sherlock comes home late because Sherlock has been spending time with John after school. The look that Mycroft gives Sherlock is not one that causes a warm and fuzzy feeling. It is a look that makes Sherlock want to squirm, like a child caught with his hand inside a cookie jar. It's a look that says Mycroft knows exactly where Sherlock has been, who he has been with, and, worst of all, exactly how Sherlock is feeling.
That does not mean you can afford to wait until next year. Especially if you're going for one of the more prestigious universities.
Sherlock turns to the source of the voice: a blond boy whose name Sherlock does not know. Sherlock recognises him as one of the boys who sit in the front of the class, but Sherlock has never interacted with him before. Sherlock has had no need to collect unimportant data on this boy, including his name.
Sherlock pulls his professor aside the day that they are given this project, as the other students are beginning to pack up their belongings and make their way out of the room.
"Thank you," John says, and then he turns to Sherlock, inclining his head to wordlessly say 'Shall we?'
The kiss breaks when John's lips pull upwards into a smile against Sherlock's own, and then John lets out an almost giddy-sounding giggle that brings a smile to Sherlock's own lips. It's quite possibly the best sound that he has ever heard in his life.
The words earn a bright smile from John, warm and genuine and showing absolutely no indication that he has taken offence. "I suppose people are usually a bit weirded out by you reading their minds, then?"
He watches the movie, but his attention is divided, as is always the way when John is involved. He's following the film's storyline, but he is more interested in watching John, studying his reaction to different parts. John is very expressive when he watches movies and television – which Sherlock knows, because they have had "movie nights" before. Even when John has seen a movie before, even several times, he smiles or laughs and generally demonstrates his enjoyment of them. It's always clear that he is invested in the storyline, even when he's seen it before.
John lets out a breath, and Sherlock's mind is whirring way into the future. In his head, John has already stormed out, John has already told Sherlock that he will not be working with him, and Sherlock is already in the process of considering ways to convince his professor that this is proof that Sherlock needs to work alone.
He turns and makes his way down the front step, but before he can disappear from sight, Sherlock says, "John", and John stops, turning to face him.
"You could come back to my house," Sherlock suggests suddenly, before he even realises he was going to make that suggestion.
His face is tender, but not enough to justify the way that he can still feel the imprint of John's hands on his skin, even once John stands up and steps away.
Instead, Sherlock takes a spare blanket from the top of his wardrobe and carefully drapes it over John's body, before taking a seat at his desk. He had had no intentions of going to sleep anyway, not when he has to be awake in a few hours. John will make better use of the bed than Sherlock would have. Instead, Sherlock passes his time by jumping through various internet articles, following links to different pages and eventually ending up on entirely new topics, passing the time by reading about crimes and chemicals and anything else that catches his eye.
He would have thought that by now the dreams would have stopped – or, at least, that he would have stopped feeling the way he feels when he wakes up.
Sherlock still isn't entirely certain where this has come from or where this is going, but he feels as tense as John looked earlier. His stomach churns, but, wordlessly, he nods his head.
"Most people aren't like you and I, Sherlock. They cannot see things objectively. They let themselves believe that their love will last. It just leaves them more hurt when they find that they were wrong."
"Sherlock," Mycroft says in a slightly exasperated tone of voice. "Only children believe that someone cannot see you if you cannot see them."
It's just. I know you. I know you have a tendency to keep to yourself, especially since I graduated, and I don't want you to be, you know, lonely.
Sherlock is familiar with the terms that people often use to describe him, and the things that people say about him behind his back. Freak, psychopath, madman – these words are nothing new for him. He has heard similar things throughout his entire life – if not these precise words, then words that imply more or less the same thing. Sherlock is used to it. He has learnt to filter it out and ignore it.
Well, you could ask someone if you wanted to. Maybe then you'd be the one who does nothing but talk about your formal date.
"Problem?" he asks, and John's head snaps towards Sherlock. He looks almost as though he has forgotten that Sherlock is there at all.
"We could try a café?" John suggests, but Sherlock is immediately dissatisfied with the idea for the same reason that he would be dissatisfied with the library. If anything, a cafe will only be louder than the library. And there will be people everywhere.
John goes back to university, and Sherlock goes back to school. He graduates this year. He's almost done, almost free.
They're practically joined at the hip – where you find one, you know the other is not far away. Sometimes other students will ask Sherlock where to find John – often they will refer to John as Sherlock's "better half". Sherlock does not mind it. Sherlock does not mind any of it. He has never felt this close to anyone before. It feels like nothing could come between them.
"Can I kiss you?" John asks quietly, and the words alone are enough to make Sherlock's breath catch in his throat. He doesn't trust his voice, so instead, he nods his head, and then John leans forward and kisses him.
A part of Sherlock seems to almost instinctually want to deny that John is his friend, because he doesn't have friends. This particular part of Sherlock is the part that is very closely linked to Mycroft's voice in his head. He suppresses the urge. "This is my lab partner, John," he introduces.
would also work a lot better with someone other than those people." He pauses, and then adds, "I don't have any close friends in our class, so I need to find a partner as well, and you sound like a nicer partner than a lot of the people in our class."
In his head, he can hear his brother's voice. He can hear his brother tell him not to get attached, because caring for someone means putting oneself at risk.
Sherlock loves the class up until they are told that their major project for the semester is to be done in pairs.
Sherlock shifts on the sofa so that he does not take up as much space, so his knee isn't pressing into John's.
Sherlock turns to look over his shoulder, and John's expression shifts when he sees Sherlock's face, portraying a number of different emotions. Shock, horror, sadness. Sherlock wipes some of the blood from beneath his nose away with the back of his hand.
Mycroft replies with a faux-innocent look. "Nothing, Sherlock," he says. "I merely thought that you of all people would have been resourceful enough to find a way around your professor's request. Or, I would have expected you to agree on paper but still work by yourself, rather than inviting your partner over for 'study sessions'. That is, presuming you really did want to work alone."
Sherlock has spent most of his life alone, but the months that follow John's graduation are the first time Sherlock has ever felt lonely.
Sherlock opens his mouth to respond, but the best he can do is, "Oh." It's possibly the least intelligent thing he's ever had to say.
There's a timer in the back of Sherlock's mind now, constantly counting down the number of days until graduation.
"Watch it, freak," Sally spits as she walks past. Sherlock barely processes it. Whatever word Sally Donovan refers to him by does not affect him, and he does not want to waste valuable brain power paying attention to her and the things that she says.
Sherlock doesn't realise that John has been trying to talk to him until John pulls the washcloth away and frowns.
Sherlock's expression must have portrayed his thoughts, because John glances over at him as though asking permission, and whatever he sees on Sherlock's face makes him say, "Oh, that's okay. I wouldn't want to impose..."
Sally crosses her arms over her chest and glares. "Well, even if I did," she says, "I don't see why I should waste my breath. It's not like he has any concept of manners."
The fire was warm and I was sleepy, the whiskey not helping.  I looked down at my glass and realized it was empty.
I closed the door quietly when I left and walked to the loo. I'm nervous. If I'm honest with myself, it's probably about what Mary said when we were out to get curry. Sherlock spending time with me. So what if he does?
Sherlock was walking determinedly and as fast as possible, but didn’t exactly know where he was going in the big, confusing house. He wanted to get away fast, find the door,  maybe just to find some air, but maybe go--get out of here. Not finding the door right away, he polished off the beer and went to look for more.
Outside on the kerb, Mycroft parted from John and wished him good luck. John climbed into the back of the long dark car and the driver pulled away into the road. John did not give any thought that the driver knew exactly where he was going. Just another inexplicable fact of life with the Holmeses that John had uneasily accepted.  He wastes no brain power asking 'why' or 'how' right now.
Sherlock curled himself up tighter, wishing he could sink into the bed. "I thought he loved her," he murmured. That was what parents did, wasn't it? Love each other?
The words "freak" and "psychopath" and "stalker" echo inside Sherlock's head. John is staring at him, and Sherlock can only wait for the inevitable. John will call him some variation of the words that Sherlock can already hear in his mind, and he will get up and storm off. John might have been the only person in Sherlock's class who Sherlock could possibly work with, and Sherlock will undoubtedly have destroyed any potential of an effective partnership before they can even start the interesting work.
Of course, it's not like it completely comes between them. They still see each other almost every day, and John's love life isn't going to stop that.
If John just looked distracted, Sherlock would assume that maybe this movie is one he has seen so many times that he is bored of it. However, that would not explain the tension that is visible in John's neck and shoulders. Is John stressed about something? Is he uncomfortable? There are certainly tense scenes in the movie, but nothing that really warrants this kind of reaction. It must be something unrelated to the movie, something that is occurring in John's life. Is it due to uni, to upcoming exams and assessments? Is it something to do with John's relationships? John hasn't mentioned a girlfriend recently – unless he did and Sherlock chose to tune him out, which isn't all that unlikely.
They take the time to proofread it, and neither of them pick up on any glaring errors, but they are both aware that it is entirely possible that they're simply too tired to notice their own mistakes. At least, John is aware of this. Sherlock has enough confidence in his mental faculties to believe that there are no causes for concern. And, of course, given they do not have the time to get a good night's rest and re-read it when they're less sleep-deprived, the project is as good as it's going to get.
Sherlock is vaguely aware that these last few points are not objective. Maybe Sherlock isn't objective about this. Maybe he never has been.
"You volunteered to be my partner immediately after one of our classmates expressed displeasure at the idea of partnering at me," Sherlock explains. "I assure you, I do not need you to partner with me because the comment in question made you feel sorry for me. I do not need your pity."
It's not like they stop being friends, of course. It's hardly as though people abandon all their friends when they start dating. However, the fact that John is now dating does mean that they do not spend as much time with one another as they used to. Sometimes, Sherlock will suggest an activity, and John will decline, because he already has plans with his girlfriend at the time.
John reads the number on Sherlock's page, and then he looks up at Sherlock with a visibly surprised look on his face. It makes Sherlock hide a smile.
"Sherlock, love, would you mind –" she starts, and then she looks up and realises that they have company. There's a flicker of surprise, but it very quickly melts into a smile. "I didn't know you were bringing a friend home. Who's this?"
Afterwards, Sherlock shut himself up in his room, sitting on his bed with his back against the wall. He made no effort to move, even when the light from outside faded and left it too dark to see.
For the first time in his life, Sherlock's mind goes completely and utterly blank. It's as though every door and every window around his Mind Palace has been thrown open, letting in beautiful, bright, blinding light that drowns out everything else. The kiss is gentle, and yet it leaves Sherlock's head spinning.
Sherlock studies John's face for a moment, and he knows from John's expression that John is not likely to change his mind. Even though Sherlock has insisted that he is happy to finish the project, John will not let Sherlock work alone. And, Sherlock thinks, maybe it is better if they finish it together anyway.
Sherlock is careful with every move he makes, because he does not want to make too much noise and accidentally wake John.
Are you kidding? This is you were talking about. As if you could stand going to a less-prestigious university and being around "idiots".
A few minutes later, Sherlock's phone buzzes, and Sherlock all but trips over himself to pick it up. John's name lights up on the screen.
John glances at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye, and then he returns his gaze to Sally. "You know what, you're right," he says. "If I were him, I wouldn't put any effort into getting along with someone who treats me the way you do anyway."
After a moment, he tells her that he'd been under the impression that Greg Lestrade was going to ask her. It's not strictly speaking true, but it's not a lie that Greg has been stealing glances at Molly out of the corner of his eye for the better half of the year.
His professor looks up at him over the tops of his glasses. "There's an even number of students in the class, including you," he says. "You should have no problems finding someone to work with."
"Mummy tells me you've been spending quite a lot of time with one of your classmates," Mycroft says over breakfast, on one of the weekends that Mycroft has chosen to spend at home.
"Come along, John," Sherlock says immediately. He might not be able to avoid the awkward conversations that will take place over dinner, but at least he can separate John from his mother now and ensure that these conversations do not start any earlier tonight.
The professor shakes his head, though there's a little smile playing on his lips. "You're also in this class because you're clever. We know that you're intelligent enough to complete the assignment on your own. I think it would be more of a challenge if you had to work with someone else."
It's definitely more intellectually stimulating. You might even find some of the things that I'm learning challenging. Chem isn't quite as exciting without you blowing things up next to me, though.
Why are you so desperate for me to go? You're at uni and your life is in no way impacted by whether I choose to spend my Thursday night around a bunch of idiots in nice clothing or at home by myself.
Sherlock's mother does not take the hint. She shakes her head insistently. "No imposition at all," she says. "Please, we'd love to have you. We always have leftovers anyway. This one," – she jerks her head in Sherlock's direction - "doesn't eat enough."
Although they are apart, they do not fall apart. The benefit of living in today's day and age is that friendships are not limited by distance. They text and they email, and it's not the same as sitting together at lunch or passing notes beneath the desk, but it's better than nothing. Plus, two hours isn't really that far, and John has the option to come home from time to time on weekends.
In sleep, John's expression looks soft. The lines on his face are smoothed out and he looks peaceful, content.
John is looking back at him with an expression on his face that is both familiar and strange. On the one hand, it's an expression he's seen on John's face before, but on the other hand, it's something he cannot immediately put a name to. There's something soft about the look, about the smile that plays on the corners of John's lips and the almost warm look in his eyes.
to work with someone, then obviously it's preferable to work with someone who is not the boy who called Sherlock a freak, or that boy's friends. Maybe the blond boy sitting in front of him is the best option available.
I'm sure that would be an excellent incentive if I actually got on with any of my classmates. However, I do not, and I cannot say that there is anyone currently at the school that I will miss after graduation.
He suggests the idea to his mother one afternoon, when she is in a good mood and most likely to be agreeable. "Can I invite John over for Christmas?"
They run into a problem one Wednesday afternoon. The cleaners have come through early, and the chemistry lab is already closed by the time they reach it.
"I haven't broken you, have I?" John says after a moment, and Sherlock realises that he hasn't said a single word of this out loud.
The words, Sherlock can ignore. Sherlock does not care if people call him a freak, or a psychopath, or a weirdo. What is much harder to ignore is when Sherlock's peers decided to demonstrate their opinions of Sherlock in a much more physical manner. Usually, Sherlock is fast enough to keep himself out of reach, at least until he can either get home or get to class. This time, he hasn't been quite so lucky.
John shifts, and then he reaches out and covers Sherlock's hand with his own. Immediately, all of Sherlock's attention is diverted to the touch. It's innocent, gentle. It's hardly anything new – John has touched his wrist before to get his attention – but this feels like something else entirely. It shouldn't be right for such an innocent touch to feel so intimate.
It's certainly not for lack of effort. It feels like they have done nothing but work on this project for the last few weeks – lunch times, after school, and, of course, the allocated in-class time. However, the project design they chose is not an easy one. Neither of them ever believed it to be. Even with all the time they have spent on it, there is still more to go.
Again with the capital letters. It doesn't change the definition of the word, nor my decision on the matter.
