Steve knew the answer, but only nodded as he let Tony respond; he was still too nervous about answering questions, afraid he would say the wrong thing and/or look ridiculous doing so.
During the entire meal, Tony seemed wholly unbothered by his behavior that morning, chatting with Steve as if he didn’t just have an emotional break down a few hours earlier. Steve listened, trying to play along because he didn’t want to upset Tony again.
“Be that as it may, Colonel Fury, I still believe selling Synergy to an outside bidder is the only recourse we have…I don’t see this project moving forward in its current capacity.”
Steve mentally perused through past details concerning his relationship with Tony: Tony had been more than great while Steve was in recovery and Steve felt a wonderful connection toward Peter, also. Steve truly believed that the three of them could be a family someday.
Steve sighed as he watched Tony and Peter comment on his ad. But as he watched, he began to laugh with them; something about the moment felt warm and familial.
Steve huffed as he rested his hands on his hips. He was so confused by Tony’s abrupt change; he had no idea why he was being blindsided like this.
Steve glared at Tony who was standing in the doorway before closing his eyes again. “Are you going to make an announcement whenever I do something?”
“I’m fuzzy on the details…I’ve only been given some information…I was only contacted to persuade Selvig…they wanted to use him to build some sort of super weapon…” Loki gasped as soon as Tony let go of him.
Tony moaned from the comment and feeling Steve. He kissed him back; he could feel that Steve cared about him, but Tony couldn’t be that honest with his feelings just yet. Maybe he needed to give it more time before telling Steve that he was in love with him and wanted to adopt more kids.
Fury nodded, uncrossing his arms to rest them on a chair back in front of him. “I agreed, Stark. How long do you think it’ll take before we can use the device again?”
He decided that now wasn’t really the time to tell Steve how he felt. All of the shit that had happened over the past week or so was too much to process and he didn’t want to cause any more tension with Steve over a series of misunderstandings.
“No problem,” Strange crossed his arms, “I want to keep you in the hospital for a few more days just to watch that arm, but then after that, you’ll be free to go,” Strange smiled downward at Tony, “glad to see you're more or less your normal self, Tony.” He winked at Tony before saying goodbye and exiting the room.
Tony inhaled then exhaled deeply as he went back to fiddling around with the Synergy device. “I didn’t mean that to shame you into going with me…I would take Rhodes but he’ll be playing patriot in Washington when the house is free.”
Steve nodded, leaning in to kiss Tony before lying down next to him. “Of course, Tony.” He then hugged Tony against his body as they drifted off to sleep.
Steve leaned downward to pick up his bag. He heard the others, as they made their way out of the conference room, welcome him to the team. But instead of hearing Tony’s voice, all Steve was left with, as he glimpsed once more around the room before leaving with Bruce, was an awkward looking Tony with his hands in his jeans staring in his general direction. Steve smiled as best as he could but didn’t wait for Tony to reciprocate. He felt too uneasy himself to really acknowledge their team leader.
“…could…we start…over, Tony?” Steve voice grew quiet, “…I really miss spending time with you…I also miss spending time with Peter…I just want us…to be friends again…”
Tony turned around with a smile and a lime La Croix. “Here ya go.” He held the can up for Steve as best as he could, but Steve was holding him too close to his body.
“Uh, my closest friends are also in the military.” Steve awkwardly volunteered. “Or one of them still is.”
“I’m well aware,” Fury responded as he backed away from a grinning Tony, “but I think having Rogers in your lab will not only make him more valuable to the team but may also help you more than you realize.”
“Hey, Banner.” Tony greeted as he entered the main space. The set up wasn’t as luxurious as the labs at Stark Tower, but the space was equipped with all of the basic amenities that would come with working in a Stark Industries lab.
“Of course, Obie. That’s what business partners do. They don’t hide things from one another.” Tony responded, still sitting at the table.
Clint looked around before holding out a hand for Natasha to take. They then walked to the middle of the space to continue dancing to avoid looking suspicious.
After further reflection, Tony slowly turned his head to look at Steve who had remained in the same position while he was thinking.
Steve held his gaze toward Tony before finally letting go. Tony almost let out an audible sigh of relief from being that close to Steve for the first time in such a long time. Steve backed away an inch as Tony coughed before motioning toward the kitchen.
Tony moaned quietly as Steve scooted them around in the bed to lie lengthwise. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck as Steve held him close against his body, letting his hands roam over Tony’s backside. He heard Tony make a few quiet noises through their kiss before breaking away to rub the tip of his nose into his neck, pushing himself more into Steve’s body. Steve pushed back until he had Tony completely on his back and he was above to the side. He reached out a hand to stroke Tony’s face.
Natasha and Clint busied themselves, finding the broken remote they needed to replicate. On a tablet, Natasha punched in some numbers to create a code to send to Tony. To Steve, it felt like both a long and short while; he felt a little uneasy as he crouched down near the Synergy device.
Steve jogged to catch up with him, but he expended little effort. “Me too.” He offered quietly in a reassuring tone as he followed Tony into the bedroom.
He turned slightly to wave back at his friends before finding Tony again who was standing next to Happy, chatting away enthusiastically.
The principal shook her head a few times. She had a huge band aid on her forehead from escaping the robot. Steve and Tony were sitting in front of her desk, both looking awkward and nervous about embarrassing their kid in such a matter.
“Well, that’s great.” Tony began as he handed Steve a plate, “I’m glad you’ll have your squad back.” He tried for as lightheartedly as possible which seemed to work because Steve just grinned at him before picking up a utensil to eat.
Steve’s internal clock jerked him awake. He yawned, blinking a few times before looking over at Tony who was practically curled in a ball, dead asleep, and snoring even louder than last night. Steve attempted to readjust his body, but then he realized that Tony was sleeping on top his outstretched arm. He gently pulled himself free, wincing momentarily as Tony let out a huge sigh before turning over on his other side. He promptly went back to snoring.
Obadiah kept grinning as he spun around to walk down the corridor. Tony watched him leave before marching off in the opposite direction to access the elevator. He rode the elevator down to the lobby, nearly doubling over from how unsettling Obadiah had been since they launched Synergy. He counted to himself, trying to think about Steve getting better as the elevator reached the lobby.
Steve took note of how engaged Tony appeared as his lab partner studied whatever was in front of him.
Tony stopped the car as he turned onto the driveway, pulling out his car keys from the ignition, before sitting completely silent.
.” Steve knew Sam was joking, but this would be the opportunity of a lifetime. And, yeah, maybe he did often find a way to bring up in conversation how much he wanted to work on Project Synergy.
Steve smiled. “Great.” He then reached forward underneath the table to find his phone in his bag, “oh and I hope you still don’t mind about the suite situation…”
Steve looked downward at the city as they departed. “Thor and Bruce should be at the hospital when we get there! We’ll get the equations when we reach the hospital!” Tony added.
Tony nodded as he watched Steve leave the space, grappling with balancing his swarm of feelings before calmly walking to the console to work for a few more hours.
“Sure, I’m close with my friends, but it’s not the same, of course…” Steve trailed off as he cupped his hands together.
Steve sighed before he looked directly at Tony then the device. He smiled, albeit reservedly, before reaching out for the device.
After about an hour of awkwardly getting ready, Steve and Tony arrived at the restaurant. The host led them to their table which was outside on the balcony overlooking the water. Steve pulled out Tony’s chair for him, which caused Tony to turn red. Steve waited for Tony to settle before sitting down across from him.
Peter sighed loudly, trying to keep it to himself, but failing. Ned laughed. “You know, it’s not that bad.”
. He already said that, Buck.” Sam playfully nudged Bucky in his bionic prosthetic arm as he drank from his beer. The three friends were sitting in a booth at their favorite dive bar not too far away from Steve and Sam’s apartment in Brooklyn.
Tony made a whiny noise, stamping his feet, before he inched closer toward the bar to grab a bottle of tequila.
Both Steve and Tony went silent as the traces of Tony’s reasoning hung in the air, building toward some tension Tony wasn’t entirely sure he was mentally or emotionally prepared to confront. Steve nodded slowly, but his expression was still very much concerned. He looked like he was about to reach out for Tony.
“The presentation would have been better if I had you up there with me, Rogers. You could tell everyone that the thing isn’t that bad once you give it a try.” He winked at Steve.
Tony sighed, waiting before pushing himself out of the bed. He dragged himself out of the room toward his office before stopping at the entrance to the kitchen. He sighed again, sulking into the kitchen, plopping down on a stool at the island.
But Steve laughed anyway as he waited for Tony to walk past him and into the kitchen, following closely behind.
“Okay, since this is our first international presentation, make sure your questions are top-notch.” Tony joked, addressing the press pool.
Rhodey sighed deeply, glancing at Tony before turning to face the whole room. “My superiors are not happy that the explosion leaked to the press…” he took in another deep breath as he clasped his hands together, “…I know you all did the best that you could…but Synergy is too dangerous for the government to justify picking it up as a program…”
Steve watched Tony perk up at the comment, his expression working from emotion to emotion before settling on uncertainty.
Obadiah shook his head, "I'm not talking about whether or not Mr. Rogers is well enough to attend the event this evening."
Tony laughed. He was standing next to the bed only wearing a towel around his waist. “Don’t mind me. Keep going. I’m just enjoying the show.” He teased, waiting a moment before joining Steve in the bed.
Bucky shook his head. “You told him, after having sex the night before, that you wanted to be friends? Damn, Cap.”
Tony turned to face Bruce, realizing that he had stopped himself, dead center in the lab, clutching his chest.
“If it doesn’t get too out of hand, I wouldn’t mind that.” Steve answered. Any worry he might have sounded silly was quickly dashed by Tony’s jovial expression.
…Tony groaned to himself. After a few seconds, he felt a hand squeeze his shoulder. Tony sighed, fighting back a stream of tears brought on by the impending collapse of Synergy and his relationship with Steve.
“Really, Tony? That’s really no one’s business.” Bruce returned to eating. Tony sensed Bruce’s anxiety and decided to give him a break.
Steve could tell that Tony was trying to sound lighthearted, but he could also sense that Tony was too upset to continue. It didn’t offend him, however; actually, it made him appreciate the moment with Tony even more. Also, Steve was afraid he would make a mistake if they went any further. He was very attracted to Tony, but he knew if they ended up having sex, he would just be terrible at it, possibly ruining the evening.
“So how was your first day?” Clint inquired as Steve took a sip out of his beer. He was standing with Clint and Thor on the opposite end of the cocktail bar from where he could see Tony talking to Bruce at the bar counter.
Not long after, Tony and Steve were back in their lab. Tony was leaning up against a table, arms crossed, as he watched Steve parade in front of him, modeling a pair of the team’s new safety uniforms.
Steve nodded, still smiling, so much so that it was easy to forget that he and Tony hadn’t spoken to one another since their breakup and that he was kind of seeing some else at the moment.
Tony picked up on the hesitancy evident in Hammer’s tone. He took his time before answering. “I had to fire one of my best scientists because he was leaking company secrets to whomever this Thanos is.”
Steve took in a deep breath, seeing Tony with his back turned to the entrance of the space. Steve stopped short before entering, taking another moment before walking over to his table.
“I’m sorry I’m late. The traffic is bad.” Steve ran a hand through his hair that had been tussled a bit from having to deal with midday New York traffic.
Obadiah nodded as he walked inside, too anxious and jumbled to remark that the conference room didn’t have the same amenities he typically enjoyed at one of these events.
Steve reached downward to free himself, letting out a sharp moan as his naked hard cock made contact with Tony’s. Tony pushed upward before using his body weight to push Steve onto his back, straddling him, jerking forward with each thrust.
“Hey, Rogers.” Tony sat down next to Steve as the yacht finally headed back to the dock, “I feel like I haven’t talk to you all day.”
Steve hummed to indicate that he had heard Tony, but he never broke away from the kiss. Tony swallowed a lump in his throat as he demanded himself to play cool and not tell Steve that he loved him.
“Is this official Synergy business, Rogers?” He tried for an assured tone, but his voice cracked a little.
“I, uh, tried making lunch…hopefully I don’t kill you…” Tony attempted to tease, but the joke sounded stilted.
Bruce sighed in between bites. “She’s not interested. Trust me.” He mumbled as he sank lower into his chair.
Steve tilted his chin upward to kiss Tony on the underside of his chin before straightening up. He rubbed Tony’s body before rubbing more lube on his cock, taking the condom to roll down the length of it. Tony whined with pleasure as he watched, anticipating the sensation of feeling Steve inside of him. Steve smiled, as he kissed Tony one last time before gently pushing himself inside. Tony’s body jerked from the reaction, causing Steve to hold onto him tightly with one hand.
Obadiah stared at Tony before grinning slightly. He brushed himself off before responding. “Relax, my boy. Impetuous anger doesn’t look good on you.” He grinned before spinning around to walk away from Tony in the opposite direction.
“Drive safe and let me know when you get home, okay?” Steve asked, tapping his hand a couple times on the frame of the door before turning around again with a wave.
“What are you going to do, tie Rogers down?” Tony added with a grin. He was standing too close to Bucky at this moment, trying to sound as lighthearted as possible.
“Well, you can make a mess all over me whenever you want, baby.” Steve felt him kiss the top of his head.
Tony turned around to peek at Steve through the glass; it appeared as if his lab partner was trying to give him some space to figure out babysitting logistics. He gave Steve a thumbs up which prompted a smile from the latter.
“…but don’t despair, Anthony, your father had trouble with this damn project from the start—” Obadiah motioned toward Pepper and one of the female board members sitting closest to him, “forgive my language, ladies.”
Tony walked over to his desk, drinking his cup of coffee. He turned around to lean up against the desk, musing about using Peter’s robot as a testing ground for the iron man suit.
After some time passed, they came upon a winding driveway and a property covered with trees that had been orderly planted. Steve could see through the tress that the driveway led to a nicely sized, Modern house set quite a ways away from the main road. The driveway was unusable; the current owner was repaving it to restore it to the version it had been when Tony was a kid.
Steve sighed, trying to process his feelings and further assess Tony’s behavior. The feeling grew worse as he thought about waking up in Tony’s bed after dreaming about them making out. He groaned again as he slapped a hand to his forehead, upset with himself that he could never seem to get this whole dating thing right—
Bucky was smirking at Sam as he drank out of his beer glass. He was standing near Steve who was standing close to Tony at the bar counter. Sam flanked the end facing the rest of the group. Tony perked up as he looked over at Sam who went completely silent.
Tony carefully nestled himself on the bed next to Steve as he whipped out a few sheets of paper containing Steve’s updated recovery plan.
“We’re planning for an event right after the simulation for the board, so stay tuned,” Obadiah rose from his desk, buttoning his jacket again before motioning for Steve to follow suit.
“So…” Clint glanced back and forth at Bruce and the group, “in non-nerd speak, we’re fucked either way?”
Tony sighed as he removed his sunglasses. “Yeah the current owner wants to turn it into a house museum or something,” he turned slightly to look around the property, “even through there are
Tony walked to the edge of the bed, shuffling around anxiously as if that had been the first he was alone with Steve in his room.
Tony laughed as he clapped his friend gently on the back. “Aw, come on. You can do us all a favor and just ask her out. I can’t stand watching you two avoid speaking to one another in front of us any longer.” He made a cartoonish face of disgust in Peter’s direction which incited delightful laughter from the nine-year old.
Tony moved the hand he had on Steve’s thigh up his hip, his waist then his side, along his body until he reached his neck. He smiled as he caressed Steve before climbing on top of him to straddle his lap. The sudden movement on Tony’s part nearly knocked Steve off balance but the latter recovered quickly by using one hand to brace himself and the other to grabbed Tony’s waist before they toppled over.
“Nice work!” Rhodey had appeared behind some of the backstage employees. He walked up to Tony first to pat him on the shoulder before shaking Steve’s hand.
Tony shook his head, facing downward with a grin. “No, I was just checking…” He looked upward at Steve, still smiling.
Tony hesitated before rising from his chair again. He leaned forward, trying to give Steve a kiss, but then they were interrupted again by a nurse.
Steve looked back and forth at Tony and Bucky. “Well, uh yeah, but…Tony I thought you said you wanted to relax a bit?” He had worked himself up all night about having a conversation with Tony that he had missed his chance at the dinner and now knew he needed to talk to Tony before the party that night.
Steve rolled his eyes with a laugh as he let Tony drag him down one of the hallways. They walked for a while until they found a room with the door ajar. The color of the door matched the description given prior to Tony for the meeting location.
The group responded verbally as they climbed into the cars. They drove to a covered walkway that cut through the landscape to the main buildings.
“Peter’s better about this now…” Tony locked the door, “…but I should probably lock the door just in case he barges into the bathroom.”
Bruce clammed up at once. He readjusted his glasses before answering. “…we haven’t settled on a date yet, because of all the commotion, but probably next week. The week after at the latest…”
Steve carefully removed the Synergy device from the bag before placing it on top of the bedside table. He pressed a few buttons before addressing Tony.
Everyone nodded back as Tony tapped on his earpiece again. “Romanov, it looks like we’re in a tricky situation. Stand by and we’ll meet you guys out by the helicopter.”
Steve nodded while looking around the space as if that were the first time he had ever been there. He then turned around to face Tony who was lingering near the elevator.
Tony sighed as he turned around to face Peter who was holding Steve’s letter. Tony sat up quickly in the bed.
Tony nodded as he pulled out a stool to sit at the island across from Steve. “Ah well…I think we could manage something….” He smiled at Steve before standing up quickly to walk to the counter, “I should probably have some plates and shit out, sorry about that…”
Tony moaned even louder from before as Steve bucked up into his body. He leaned forward again to kiss Steve, now touching and rubbing himself. Steve could feel himself giving in, but he didn’t want to come so quickly; he was afraid it would turn off Tony.
Tony squinted his eyes as he let Obadiah’s words shoot painful jabs throughout his body. Maybe Obadiah was right; Tony couldn’t even say out loud that he loved Steve.
Rhodey rolled his eyes as Tony let go off him. He looked around the restaurant, spotting Steve making his way over.
“Until tomorrow night. It’s only been a week, but I feel like I haven’t seen him in ages.” Tony answered.
“Okay, so here’s everyone’s ticket.” Sam handed both Tony and Bucky theirs. “We should sit down and wait. After the ceremony, we should try to get Steve to take some photos before grabbing a drink somewhere.”
Steve nodded as he listened. Tony sniffled again. “Everything was barely fine before we broke up, I just made it worse. I don’t even think we can be friends...I’m not…good for you, Steve.”
“…fuck, Steve…” He repeated as he felt a warm slick feeling between their stomachs. He pressed up against Steve who was a still grinding downward into his body. They held onto each other for a moment longer before Steve slid off Tony to lie down next to him. Both panted for a while, trying to catch their breath.
“Hey, how did it go?” He asked as he met Tony with an outstretched arm that landed on the latter’s waist.
Trying not to make a bigger deal out of the moment then needed, Steve followed Tony to the middle of the balcony designated for dancing. There were other people present so it didn’t feel completely odd to dance with Tony. Besides they were just friends. It really wasn’t a big deal.
“Fuck! I gotta get Peter. I almost forgot.” Tony’s relaxed smile turned into a look of determination as he jumped out of his chair, grabbed his things and rushed out of the office.
Obadiah shifted a bit in his chair before answering. Tony remained outwardly nonchalant toward Obadiah’s glaring stare from the other side of his desk.
Steve, as he stopped a few feet in front of Tony, stared at him attentively. “Tony, don’t ever blame yourself for that. You know it wasn’t your fault.”
Tony couldn’t help himself; Steve was all over him. But then he remembered why he had liked Steve in the first place. He
“Nice. I can’t believe Riri managed to find more material from my dad’s archives…” Tony mostly said to himself, “it looks like she stayed up late, though. This email is from 3am…”
Tony shook his head. “No, I just forgot about that fucking press event…” He leaned forward with a groan.
Tony scrunched up his face. “She’s my research assistant, Rogers. Besides, I know she would tell me if I were exploiting her in anyway.”
Bruce nodded as he patted Tony on the shoulder. “I get that, Tony. But maybe Steve’s trying to process what’s going on before trying to have a productive conversation?”
Steve swallowed a lump in his throat as he nodded back again. He wasn’t sure if he should try to explain the situation. Of course, he was interested, but he also didn’t want his friends to think he was just sleeping around.
Steve reached out his hand to greet the two women. “Nice to you meet you.” He shook both of their hands before wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him in close for a snug half hug. Tony hugged him back, even tighter, which then turned into an odd game of who could act the most unbothered by pretending to be married to each other.
Tony bucked upward into his mouth as Steve continued to move his head downward. As he took in Tony’s lingering scent from his shower, Steve remembered the way Tony used his hand on him, mimicking the movements he thought felt the best. He glanced upward at Tony who was now looking back at him with his eyes halfway closed, biting his bottom lip.
He was so annoyed, not really with Rhodey, but more with how terrible he felt since he last saw Steve. Making out with Steve had been so fucking hot and Tony thought he had made progress by not rushing things, but the way Steve had scurried out of the penthouse the morning after made him feel like a complete idiot.
“Okay, we’re sending the first set to you now, Stark.” Natasha called in Tony and Steve’s earpieces.
Steve nodded, hugging the pillow next to him as he gasped a few times. He lifted his body as Tony placed a pillow underneath him.
Tony laughed quietly. “Aren’t you the one who would stop at no cost to save Synergy? Well, here’s your chance, Rogers.”
Tony turned his head toward the direction of the bathroom; he listened to the shower running. He sighed once more before staring upward at the ceiling.
As soon as Tony uttered the name, Hammer’s face went completely white. He cleared his throat a few times as he fidgeted in his chair, obviously visibly uncomfortable by the topic.
Tony shook his head. “No, you look very handsome, Rogers.” He put is phone back into his pocket before returning to his chair. Steve got up to pull his chair out for him.
Steve’s expression changed quickly as he smiled back at Tony which prompted Tony to return the expression, albeit timidly and through waves of pain.
“I think you already know why I’m here.” Obadiah started, looking around casually before training his focus on Tony.
But before Peter could answer Tony, Steve had appeared at the entrance of the lab with a plate full of cookies. Both Tony and Peter looked at the other before dropping their tools to race toward Steve, nearly knocking Steve over as they grabbed at the plate.
Steve nodded as he closed the door before sitting down in his desk chair. “Thanks.” Was all he could manage in a situation he had never thought he would find himself in while pushing for a deadline in the middle of the week.
“I’m going to go out there, gather intel on the buyers then toss Obie out on his ass.” Tony answered coolly, eyes still fixed on the data.
“Hey, Tony.” Tony turned to see Shuri walk into the conference room T’Challa had set aside for the team to work on Synergy. The rest of the team would be arriving the next day for the wedding, so Tony, Shuri, and Steve would be video conferencing with the rest of the team with Fury.
Tony appeared to be on the edge as well because his body began to shake as he rubbed himself before coming on himself and Steve. Steve leaned forward, holding onto Tony as he came inside, his movements sped up before they slowed down. He laid on top of Tony before sliding to the side, panting.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., hold up for a second.” He called as the numbers before him stopped running up the projection.
Tony took a moment before answering. He kept his arms crossed, looking side to side before looking directly at Steve. “Okay, fine, Rogers. But you have to promise me we’ll always work as a team.”
Steve pulled a blanket over his head, sighed, before flinging the covers away. He swung his legs over the side of the bed as he looked around for his jeans from last night. He looked over at Tony who was in the process of trying to make himself look more presentable.
“Let me go!” Loki shrieked as Thor threw him into the back of the car. Loki grabbed Thor and the two of them wrestled with each other in the back seat as Steve tried to help Thor hold Loki still.
Steve jumped out of his chair, swinging the office door open before jogging past his interns until he was at the entrance of the building. He threw open the door, looking down both sides of the sidewalk until he saw Tony getting inside his car with Happy sitting in the driver’s seat.
Tony nodded emphatically as he ushered Steve in with his arms, stepping to the side. “Yes, of course.”
think I would do something like this?” He crossed his arms against his body as Tony felt like crawling into a small, dank hole.
Steve turned his head somewhat to look at Tony. “Also,” Tony continued with a grin, “remember when I said it’s okay if you don’t get it the first time? We can try again.” He turned to face upward at the ceiling.
Pepper had the Stark Industries Chief of Security inspect the security tapes to find a culprit, but he came up short. Fury then had Shuri and Natasha review the tapes at S.H.I.E.L.D. to find any similarities between it and the tapes Loki had doctored. So far, there had been no correlation between the security tapes of the blast and the Loki tapes.
That mid-afternoon, Obadiah had emailed Steve, asking to meet with the latter at his most convenient time. Steve thought the request was strange; this would be the first time he would have a one-on-one with Obadiah since starting on the project.
“Because,” Tony grinned, “I must retain the softy parent,” he then pointed toward the outside of the car at Steve who was patiently waiting for them, “and the hard ass parent dynamic,” he then pointed to himself, “your dad knows the deal.”
Tony felt too overwhelmed to try to escape, now expecting Sharon to also mention that she knew that he and Steve used to date. He waited and waited as Sharon continued speaking, until it became clear that she had no idea that he and Steve had been in a serious relationship.
“Yeah Tony lives here with his son.” Steve added, smiling warmly at Tony who was screaming on the inside and trying to stay composed.
Steve laughed as the three of them clinked their glasses together. Sam and Bucky began to debate one another over which part of the presentation they like the most while Steve sipped out of his glass, still watching Tony.
Tony hurried out of the lab, barely hearing Steve respond. He hustled back to his office, shutting the door behind him as he entered. He looked around the office, as if searching for something that would stop his heart from exploding. He counted to himself, closing his eyes as he breathed deeply.
Steve grabbed both of Tony’s hands with his own. Tony watched Steve convey his sincerest apologies with his eyes.
Hammer smirked at Tony as he sat down. “So, what can I get the national hero?” He waved for a waiter to serve their table, “seriously, though. How did your gadget figure out a cure for a newly developed virus? That seems impossible.”
“Tony.” Bucky coolly addressed Tony before walking up to Steve’s bed. Tony continued to watch Bucky as he took his time approaching.
Tony stared at her as she approached, not entirely sure if she knew about what had happened between him and Steve.
Steve turned his head to the side to address Tony who kept kissing his neck. “Tony…,” he exhaled deeply, “…do you think we could…” he began before stopping himself.
Tony was standing next to Steve with a clear view though the room window, while the rest of the team was standing toward other side of the hallway.
“Steve! You’re awake!” Tony instinctively reached out for Steve, rising from his chair to give him a hug, but Steve winced as he moved toward him.
Steve attempted a nod, but his neck wouldn’t respond. He clenched the armrests on his chair; he couldn’t go out to the cubicles, but he also couldn’t hide in his office. He thought maybe he should ask his assistant to tell Tony that he was busy with the deadline, but Steve knew Tony would see right through that.
Steve hugged Tony before turning to press him downward into the bed. He moved so that half his body was lying on top of Tony before kissing him. Tony kissed Steve back as best as he could, but he couldn’t stop thinking about Tiberius. Steve ran his hands up along Tony’s sides moaning quietly and Tony could feel his insides turning in on themselves again.
“Indeed. Now in other related news. Former CFO of Stark Industries, Obadiah Stane, in connection with the explosion, has been indicted on multiple charges of fraud, bribery, manslaughter, assault—”
The room became quiet as everyone looked back and forth between the door and Obadiah. Obadiah, for a brief moment, looked surprised by the accusation. Yet, he shrugged it off with a hand wave to avoid any further embarrassment.
Steve’s expression turned curious as he stared at Tony, clearly thinking that Tony was about to say something more profound.
“…they managed to get him to the hospital, but the staff doesn’t have access to the machine they need to keep him alive. Apparently, he has a rare heart condition that only his personal doctor has been able to keep stable. I’m sending the rest of the team’s whereabouts.”
All eyes turned to Steve and Tony as the huddled group realized that the photographer had mistaken them for a couple. Both Steve and Tony quickly glanced at each other, both turning red before awkwardly shuffling to the right. Tony almost tripped and Steve took a hold of his arm before he fell over, adding more to the palpable tension.
Tony’s heart sank. He needed more time to get over Pepper, so it wasn’t helpful whenever she suggested meeting up. Tony had always found a way to get out of it, but ever since launching the Synergy program, Pepper had increased her efforts to get him to talk to her.
Prompted by Tony’s magnetism, the press agents surrounding them began laughing at the harmless comment. Steve walked as close to Tony as possible, feeling weird about receiving so much attention. They answered a few more questions until Happy managed to get them into a room with more press agents.
Steve didn’t mind the office. Actually, the medium-sized, wall-offed office surrounded by a few cubicles was nice. The office space was also not too far away from his apartment in Brooklyn, so Steve would often ride his bike to work.
And as soon as Rhodey finished his statement, Tony rose quickly out of his chair, marching out the conference room. Everyone else, too stunned by the situation, tried to ignore it as Obadiah only shook his head.
Tony nodded as he worked, but the robot began to spin around again almost bucking him off. Tony pulled the blue wires out which caused the robot to stop spinning and turn off, but the force of the last spin caused the robot to topple over. Tony managed to let go before the robot fell on top of his body. He rolled to the side as sparks shot out from the robot as it powered down.
Tony waited before answering. He continued to stroke the back of Steve’s neck. “Steve…it’s okay. That doesn’t matter…honestly,” he laughed to himself, “I could jerk off to just thinking about you smiling.”
Steve only nodded as he rose from his desk to walk Tony out. Tony did the same, but he waved Steve off.
“Rogers. There’s no time. You need to move quickly.” Tony’s voice sounded gruff and harsh. He sounded like he had earlier in the morning, but now there was no doubt to the tone in his voice.
Obadiah had been told that after leaving the weapon at the tech conference, one of Thanos’s associates would pick up the weapon for safe keeping. Obadiah wasn’t sure what the point was taking the weapon to Roosevelt Island in the first place; he thought it would be best for Thanos to lie low after the S.H.I.E.L.D. raid so Obadiah could diplomatically redirect Stark Industries’ efforts into full weapon contracting with Thanos and his scientists secretly working on building weapons for the company.
Steve groaned as he shifted his body from side to side. He was lying on one of the sofas in the living room area of the suite. He turned over onto his side to look at his phone which was sitting on top of a coffee table near the sofa.
Obadiah laughed as he turned in his chair to face Tony directly. "I only want to talk with you about your plus one for the event this evening."
“…I’ve already had J.A.R.V.I.S. itemize whatever was salvageable, so we need to look through this mess and figure out what to keep and what to toss.”
Obadiah straightened up in his chair. He rolled his eyes again as he rose from his chair, walking over to the nearest window to look out onto the cityscape.
He then tapped once more on the device he was holding before turning around. He tossed the device at the other scientist who clumsily caught it as Thanos briskly walked away.
Steve smiled at Tony as he patted him on the shoulder before walking over to Bucky. Tony watched Steve leave, frustrated that another moment had been interrupted, and this time by Bucky. He scanned the bar, spotting Sam talking to one of Steve’s professors. He figured maybe he could ask Sam about Steve and Bucky. It wouldn’t hurt to ask, right?
Steve swung his legs out from the bed. He leaned forward to retrieve his shoes before straightening up to exit the bedroom, but before he could, Tony stuck out an arm to stop him.
Tony rolled his eyes as he slid his phone into the breast pocket of his jacket. "And what about it? I'm taking Steve."
Shuri shrugged, although it was clear that she had appreciated Tony’s kind statement. “Eh, sometimes it helps having a fresh pair of eyes.”
Tony laughed awkwardly. “I’m just messing with ya, Rogers.” He then tried to walk ahead of Steve who stopped him with an outstretched arm.
“End simulation.” Fury called as he reappeared above the team, hanging his head as the house disappeared. The tablet Tony had thrown onto the simulated couch dropped to the metallic arena floor with a loud clack.
Steve nodded again before turning around to walk into the living room, spotting a few boxes stacked in the middle of the space up against the fireplace. The living room had more than enough furniture in it, and there were a few paintings off to the side underneath a cloth sheet with one painting sticking out. Steve squinted to see that the painting looked to be a wispy depiction of a coastline somewhere. The room was also lined with half-filled floor-to-ceiling bookcases, with more books at the foot of the cases. There was also a record player in one corner, half covered in plastic with some records stacked next to it.
“Sir, your readings appear to show that you are fatigued. Would you like for me to turn the lights off now?” J.A.R.V.I.S. asked.
Steve responded with a cautious smile as he scooted a little closer toward Tony, noting, again, the shift in energy between the two of them. Tony looked slightly upward at him as he drew nearer, never removing his hand. The mood between the two had grown even more relaxed and cozy, but alas it was soon spoiled.
Tony had never felt so mortified in his entire life, and that was saying a lot. He had to steady himself by placing his hands on the table in front of him.
“Right away, Mr. Parker.” J.A.R.V.I.S. answered as the computer took half a millisecond to complete the request.
Pepper nodded, still horrified that she had admitted to peeping through company files. Tony sat back in his chair, arm on the rest, hand stroking his chin.
The moment felt superbly intimate, but Tony wasn’t sure what his next move should be. He was close to Steve on the couch, but not really close enough to kiss him. Also, he wasn’t sure if he should try; something about the morning after the party was still bothering him and he was afraid of misreading the mood again.
As some other event guests emerged from the building, Obadiah straightened himself out, feigning the phoniest grin, before chatting with the guests.
Tony sighed. “Bruce and I created a backup plan for the device in case, well, in case this happens.” He pointed toward the device.
Tony patted Steve on the chest before walking over to the group. Steve smiled as he watched Tony walk away.
Peter motioned toward Ned to complete his turn. “Steve’s Tony’s boyfriend.” He explained without missing a beat.
Tony grimaced, completely surprised by Steve’s change in tone. “Well,” Tony forced his face to relax, “I shouldn’t have taken this out on you…”
Steve backed away somewhat to clear his throat. The more Tony kept rubbing his hip, the more he wanted to feel up against Tony’s body, rubbing himself as he let himself get caught up in the moment.
Tony gave himself some more encourage, nodding to himself, becoming more confident with his plan to get Steve back.
“We’ll have a script that we need to follow for the actual presentation, but feel free to improvise.” He grinned knowingly at Steve.
Steve nodded as Tony worked, tapping quickly before pointing to Steve. Steve nodded again as he quickly inputted the functions into the device as Tony called them out.
After eating, the group went to a bar that wasn’t too far away from the restaurant. They ended up running into some members of Steve’s graduating cohort and professors, turning the small gathering into a larger informal graduation party.
“Hey, Tony. If you’re free tonight, would you like to come over for dinner? I’m thinking 7pm.” Steve rocked back and forth on his heels behind Tony who was facing the console he was usually stationed.
Steve sighed loudly. “…I’m a little embarrassed that you found us like that,” Steve took a deep breath as he heard Sam laugh quietly, “and…I’m not being hush-hush, Sam. I’m just not sure where Tony’s at with all of this…” Steve slumped further down into the couch.
“…I always sat in the front with my dad, which means my mother always sat in the back…I once overheard them discussing that I should learn the route to the house for when it came time for me to take care of it…”
Tony felt his eyes well up as he thought about last night and all of his insecurities. Tony closed his eyes as he began crying again, knowing fully that he needed to let Steve go so he wouldn’t have to suffer through any more drama.
Yet, despite all background noise, Tony could barely keep his hands off Steve. Almost everyone, if not everyone, knew they were seeing each other, even if Tony hadn’t had his formal meeting with the Synergy executive committee. Steve was becoming used to Tony’s mannerisms, but he was still shy about Tony being so comfortable with showing affection in public.
Tony swiped an image away on the projection. He then zoomed in with his fingers. “Okay, what if we—”
Steve shrugged in effort to alleviate Tony. “Nothing too earth shattering, just that he wanted me to be the ‘face’ of Synergy for the upcoming promotional tours.”
Steve could see Tony smiling at him out of the corner of his eye, but he was too embarrassed to look directly at him. He watched Tony cross their apartment to grab his things, before he stopped short near the door. Steve could feel Sam staring at him with that goofy smile which made him blush even more.
Tony grinned to himself as he watched the specs to the one of the suits run up the projection in front of him.
Even though they hadn’t seen each other in person, Steve had been updating Tony via email about the living arrangements at the resort. The resort suites were extravagant even by luxurious hotel standards, but most of the individual/private suites were already taken to accommodate Shuri and T’Challa’s extended family that had flown in from Wakanda for the wedding. And considering that Tony had been a late addition to the bridal party event, he and Steve would have to share a suite.
“Yeah, I know, Tony. I want to go.” Tony looked up at Bruce who was smiling. He smiled back, although it was on the weaker side.
Tony used the towel on his shoulders to run through his hair a few times before throwing it back toward the bathroom door.
Tony waved goodbye to the guard, walking quickly back to the mailbox to avoid any more prolonged conversation. As soon as he reached the box, he hesitated before taking the letter, not entirely sure what he would find inside. He flipped the envelope over as he pulled it out, his eyes widening as he realized that the letter was from Steve.
Steve chuckled before resting his hands on his hips. “Okay, Tony.” He gazed at Tony. His expression was sincere; an expression that usually made Tony melt.
Sam nodded as he drank from his bottle. “Hey, there’s your in, Cap. You should offer art lessons since you’re an artist.”
Obadiah ignored again him as he calmly continued. “They would still like to have a private event to assuage investors. The timing of this is inconvenient at best. Thank god no one else was hurt.”
“Talk. Or you’ll have to deal with me instead.” Her voice never rose above her normal speaking tone, but it was still very intimidating.
remembered, as Steve kept feeling him through his clothes, the advice his friends had given him about taking his time when pursuing future relationships.
Tony’s smile spread across his face even more as he took the opportunity to move his hand closer toward Steve’s crotch, stopping short to rub the inside of his leg.
the private one. One of his employees entered the elevator with a heavy yawn before recognizing he was an elevator with Tony.
Obadiah was chatting loudly with one of Stark Industries more important investors. They had met early that morning at Stark Tower to discuss financial business. Ever since the fate of Synergy became even more uncertain, Obadiah had been calling and meeting with investors to convince them to support bidding for open contracts.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., lower the volume, please.” Tony waited before closing the door as the volume of the music lowered.
“Wait, you asked Steve out?” Bruce, as he finally realized what Tony had said to him, turned to look directly at his friend.
Steve curiously tipped his chin upward. Stark Industries had thousands of employees, so he knew he would never meet every single one, but he thought he would have at least met Thor’s brother before now.
you were into anal, Captain Rogers.” Tony winked at Steve and Steve winced again, thinking back to when Bucky poked fun at him at the pharmacy.
ritual involved that includes literal and figurative prep, if you know what I mean.” He winked at Steve as he waved his hand about.
“Whoa! Time-out. No one said anything about assault.” Tony held up a “time-out” sign before wrapping his hands around Steve’s waist with a grin.
Nebula rolled her eyes as she listened, but after a moment or two, she shrugged. She looked directly at Gamora before looking past her down the adjoining corridor toward the testing area.
Peter nodded with a huge smile as he sat down next to Steve, rattling on about the comic being an alternate universe of their own with their family and friends dressed up like superheroes and fighting cosmic bad guys.

Steve nodded as he followed Tony, taking the private express elevator up to the penthouse. As soon as they arrived at the level, Steve went to Tony’s bedroom to wait for him as the latter checked on Peter who was sleeping soundly. As Tony entered the master bedroom, Steve could tell he was still upset.
Steve smiled. Something about this piece of information seemed to be the most private thing Tony had ever offered to share with him. He thought maybe he could take advantage of the intimacy.
Tony felt his chest constrict again as Steve caressed his arm. “Uh, I’m just exhausted…I had an extremely frustrating day that I don’t want to get into…” He half-admitted.
He guided his cock toward Tony, easing himself in as much as possible but being mindful of not going too far before Tony settled on him.
“I should probably get going…” Steve said softly before leaning downward to kiss Tony. He searched around for his shirt, getting off the bed to attempt to straighten himself out. Tony chuckled as he reached over to his bedside table, opening the drawer before producing a Kleenex box.
Tony turned somewhat to face Steve. He finished unbuttoning his shirt before shuffling up the bed to lie next to Steve who then pulled him close to his body.
Tony glanced at Steve. He was smiling; his facial expression was its usual soft and inviting countenance. Tony sighed in his head before finally climbing into the bed with Steve. He settled next to him, body near the edge. He heard Steve say something else, but something about how soft Steve’s bed was and how worked up he had been since the weekend forced his body to give into exhaustion. He drifted off to sleep next to Steve with his phone fully charged next to the bed.
Ever since that day, Tony had either worked from home or in Bruce’s space at Stark Enterprises. He was too shocked by Steve’s reaction to face him.
Tony scoffed, keeping his back turned. “A couple means precisely two. If you’ve been out on three or more dates than that’s a few. And several,” he huffed with a slight hand wave, “that’s a
Steve stayed where he was, but he shook his head. “No, it’s not, Tony. All of this was out of our control…”
After a moment or so, Tony flopped down next to Steve, panting heavily. Steve turned onto his side to place a hand on Tony’s chest, too amazed with what just happened between them.
“…I got in?” Steve barely managed as he tried to process the good news. He turned around to face Sam who had the hugest grin on his face.
Steve’s weekly routine consisted of spending five days out of the week, sometimes six, at the public defender’s office in Brooklyn and taking the subway to Morningside to teach a class at Columbia’s law school once a week. It seemed as if Steve was headed in the direction he had always intended with his life. However, despite all the professional success and opportunities, Steve found it difficult to get over Tony.
Tony shook his head as dropped his work bag on the floor with a loud thud before taking a seat at the island.
But Tony had thought Pepper had been the right person, and the people he had been with before that and so on and so on. He remembered once telling a past boyfriend that he knew they were in love one month into their relationship only to break up the month after. Once he told another ex-girlfriend one evening that they were going to adopt at least three kids, but then they broke up at the end of the following week after a stupid fight over meeting up somewhere for her birthday.
Tony glanced around the restaurant as soon as he entered, spotting Pepper in the corner near the kitchen as soon as he removed his sunglasses. She noticed him at the same time, waving with a warm smile.
Tony nodded once before turning to head further into his home. Steve followed, remarking to himself that this would be the first time he would see more of Tony’s place. As Tony entered his kitchen, Steve waited at the threshold to the space. He watched Tony walk to the island in the middle of the kitchen, opening a bottle with something brown in it before pouring himself a glass. Steve walked up to the counter, placing his hands on the edge.
Tony had led Obadiah, and god knows who else, to believe they were sleeping together. Yet, Steve quickly forced the theory out of his mind; what would be the benefit of that?
Everyone peered out of the helicopter to see Steve holding a thumbs up with his free hand to show that despite sustaining injuries from the reactionary blast, Tony was alive. Everyone cheered as Natasha maneuvered the helicopter over toward Steve and Tony.
“Good work, Parker.” He smiled to show that he was genuinely proud that Peter had finally figured out how to parallel park.
Although Tony looked wrecked from the night before, Steve couldn’t help but stare. Then his dream popped back into his head.
Soon after, everyone else except Tony began debating with each other over how best to proceed sustaining an attack from Thanos. As the cacophony of voices rose, Tony felt like his head was on the precipice of splitting in two while his chest felt like it was close to imploding.
Bruce nodded. “Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to that…” he then walked around the console, “but I do think the mini reactor will help somehow if it comes to pushing Synergy to its limits…yet…”
Then why even try for a relationship at all? Maybe he shouldn’t date. He probably should just give up and focus on Peter and work. There was no use; he would just fuck it up again.
Tony let out a sleep noise as he shifted his body weight on top of Steve. Steve held still before attempting to pull his body free from Tony.
“Tony…” Steve stepped further into the lab, “…we can get through this. This is just a minor setback…”
“I’m just a little overly protective of my space.” Steve turned around to see Tony leaning up against another console with his arms crossed. He was looking downward and away from Steve. Steve stood firmly in place, resting his hands on his hips to try for a more relaxed stance, which he was sure came off more standoffish than anything else.
“…well,” Steve looked away from Tony before facing him again, “you’re my employer, Tony…of course it’s different…” And to Steve it was different; he had been embarrassed that people thought he was capable of something that was completely antithetical to his character. It had nothing to do with Tony, but he wasn’t sure how to articulate that.
He had forgotten to give Steve the instructions for inputting data into the Synergy device before going in. Through an exhausted state, Tony thought that he had given them to Steve the day before. Still, it was no accuse for practically trying to push his lab mate out of the way because he had lost his patience. He hoped maybe he could smooth things over with Steve; Steve was a diehard professional and would probably keep working even in the most dire of situations.
Tony smiled as he glanced at Steve who was blushing from the attention, waving his hand around awkwardly.
The office rolled her eyes with a huff as she continued. “Well, like I told the Shaft wannabe then, we don’t need the alphabet boys interfering in our jurisdiction.”
Steve had been debating with himself the entire ride from his law office to Stark Enterprises over how he should deal with Tony and Synergy.
Steve laughed as he followed Tony further into the suite. “Yeah, this place is definitely bigger than my apartment…”
Tony rolled his eyes. He knew Obadiah meant that he missed being able to keep tabs on Tony like when he was younger. It had become more difficult for Obadiah to do so after Tony graduated from college and now a more mature Tony had basically shut him out of his personal and most of his business life. Pepper had advised Tony to only deal with Obadiah when necessary to keep up appearances with the board and investors. Tony had wanted to remove Obadiah from the company all together but knew that the board would turn on him if he had done so, let alone a majority of Stark Industries’ investors.
Sam patted Bucky on the back a couple times. “You also gotta make things right with Tony. You know how serious they are…”
Tony nodded, moving one finger to tap on the tablet he was holding but he stopped, “hold on,” Tony ran toward the robot, producing a tool to fix some wiring Peter had missed on his first scan.
Reticent, Steve nodded as he hung his legs off the edge of the bed before finally rising. He looked around before exiting, realizing that he had no idea where Tony’s home office was, but he felt too mortified to ask. He took a deep breath before continuing.
“Hey,” Steve entered the room, “don’t tell me you’re thinking about leaving already.” He tried for a casual and playful tone despite the tension.
Steve chuckled as he took the tags out of the box. “Thank you, Tony, that was really thoughtful of you.” He kissed Tony before handing him his gift.
Steve seemed understanding, but he wasn’t aware of all of Tony’s issues. Steve had only caught a glimpse of how big an emotional wreck Tony could be over Bucky and Tony knew that if Steve saw everything he would definitely leave. So, it was better to have some distance.
Strange led Steve and Tony inside the building, leading them to the section where Strange’s team kept the medical equipment.
Everyone’s body shifted to the side as the helicopter veered toward the island. As soon as it landed, Tony jumped out, running back inside Middleton’s main building toward the conference room. Bruce tapped on his tablet to watch Tony’s movement…
Steve sighed as he sank further into the tub so that just his head hovered above the water. “I only went to one so far and I feel well enough already.”
The rest of the night progressed as you probably already imagined. The team had their moments of bonding as Thor’s Jörmungandr exacerbated their specific personalities. Tony was watching Steve the entire night; completely transfixed, yet unable to do anything about it. When it came time for everyone to leave, Tony had managed to locate his lab partner in a spirited drunk conversation with one of Thor’s closest friends, Valkyrie, about which historical or mythical figure would be able to win in a melee.
Steve nodded again, but let out a painful sounding sigh as he joined Bucky at the table. The sigh was so distressing, it disturbed Bucky.
“If you don’t want people to think you’re messing around with Tony, maybe you shouldn’t have him spend the night.”
Thor walked over to Tony and clapped his shoulder with such a force it nearly toppled him over. Tony flinched as he rubbed the area after pulling away, but the move proved futile as Thor clapped him on the shoulder again, pulling him in close toward his body for a weird half hug.
Clint was standing at the entrance to Tony and Steve’s lab, fumbling around for a piece of paper he had shoved in his pocket that had the access code scribbled on it.
Tony couldn’t help himself as his eyes welled up. He nodded back at Steve, looking away. He could see Steve out of the corner of his eye, now smiling at him.
Tony shook his head weakly, screaming as the man pinched his nipple again. He opened his eyes. The alpha's eyes were blue. Weren't his alpha's eyes blue? He tried to drift away. Steve was touching him, yes, Steve was warm and gentle, and the sheets were soft, and he was looking at him with
Steve shifted nervously from foot to foot. He was home for the first time in a year and was staying for much longer than he had hopefull stayed last time. Around him techies rushed around, yammering into headsets and tapping at screens. His Tony and Maggie looked bored, Maggie pressing her face into the fabric of Tony’s pants. Tony looked about five minutes from yawning. They were really only there because Steve wasn’t, but he had a -- hopefully good -- surprise for them both.
Tony rolled off his lap petulantly. Steve tamped down on a smile. "Good to know that’s what’s on your mind when you have your hot and attractively slick with sweat boyfriend in your lap."
“Hey, Steve,” came the voice from the top of the stairs. Tony was smiling at him warmly from the top of the stairs, wearing not much else other than Steve’s t-shirt and socks.
Steve jolted and had swept Tony up in his arms, pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek and giving him a firm hug before he realized it. “Oh my god, sweetheart no,” he gasped before realizing what he’d done and dropping away from Tony abruptly. “Oh, I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have touched you without asking, I--”
. “Steve,” Tony’s voice had laughter, but as much as Steve hated it, still had trepidation. “Dinner’s gonna burn.”
Tony sniffled, a small smile breaking over his face. “You do the same thing, Steve. I literally bounce on the mattress every time when you get out of bed in the middle of the night to draw."
The little boy giggled and squealed, clapping his hands. Steve winced as who he would presume to be the boy’s father stirred but then let out a breath of relief as the -- rather attractive, he wasn’t gonna lie -- settled again, this time at a position that had Steve wincing.
Tony grinned and took a sip of his wine. “Honest to god, I swear one of them spent the entire date droning on about her bee in her garden and how she was sure this was a sign that Jesus hated her or something.”
When he looked up, Tony was beaming, a hand over his mouth. “Oh, it’s so cute!” Tony whispered. “And so small.”
wanted. “Yes alpha,” he whispered after a moment. “And I’m not just saying that. I like cooking,” he said, pinking. “I can cook for you, alpha.”
, the Tony who laughed and giggled at random things and made snippy jokes when he disagreed with Steve.
Tony rubbed his eyes and straightened out fully, Steve wincing in sympathy when the other man’s neck cracked. They got on to talking and by the time the plane landing, he learned that Tony and he both lived in the same area, and were both going to LA on business.
Tony grinned and sat up, ignoring the way that Steve blinked in surprise and started to smile back. “I’ve got two best friends and they’re the best people in the whole world. Rhodey’s one of ‘em, he’s an alpha and I met him at MIT, we met in physics when I fell asleep during an experiment and almost fell straight forward into acid, but he stopped me. He’s the best, even though he’s a little overprotective. Fought in the air force, but he’s home now, and last I heard, he was visiting his sister in Pennsylvania. The other one’s Pepper, she’s the most fierce omega I’ve ever met, not weak like me--” he ignored Steve’s frown. “And she bosses me around and it’s great, she gonna take over the world and I can’t wait.” he sat back, a grin still on his face before he realized that he was rambling, something very unbecoming for an omega. “Sorry.”
Bucky ducked his head, a blush going up to his stupidly nice cheekbones. Not that Tony was staring. He wasn’t. It was just that Bucky was shaped very nicely, and had a drool-worthy metal arm, and an ass that wouldn’t quit. It would just be rude to not look.
because the new man smells nice and kind and the blue eyes are grayer. "Oh, sweetie, you poor thing." The omega wrapped his hand around his ankle and Tony whimpers, tears quickening.
CLIFFHANGER! *creepy music plays* But also, thank you guys so much for putting up with me, and my kinda shitty schedule. I'm trying to prewrite chapters, but I keep forgetting, and I. am. so. behind. for. the. bingo. challenges. Also, did y'all know that 'gossipy' was a word?
Whatever they had given him was making him go down and all he could think about was the swears that the alpha had spat at him, so unlike Steve’s gentle hands and gentle voice and the way he had always touched Tony like he was
3. Look at the tags! They are subject to change, and if you're not sure about this fic, look at the tags!
“I saw the news,” Tony mumbled after a few quiet seconds of them just holding each other. “I’m sorry.”
Tony slumps gratefully as the alpha drops him by the hair, curling into the fetal position and shuddering as someone shoves something in him. It’s too big, it pinches and prods at the wrong places and he goes limp, the world fuzzing into black around him as footsteps get farther and farther away from him.
Come time for sleep, Tony shrugged on a sheer nightgown and did his best to cover himself with his robe that his Mamma had thankfully slipped into his suitcase.
“Tony!” The alpha turns him around with calloused fingers on his shoulders and Tony drops his eyes and oh god he’s going to be punished, he knew that the kindness couldn’t last, and he knows better than to expect a safeword or being able to stop.
Peter pouted at him, and Tony swore inwardly. It was like a cute puppy begging for treats and it took everything in him to not cave. “It’s physics, Mr. Stark.”
The only started talking after they were both situated with coffee in hand and pressed from knee to shoulder. Tony was unabashedly touch-starved and Bucky looked like he could use a hug or twenty. “So?” Tony asked, nudging Bucky. “What’s up?”
He turned back to the kid and went crosseyed, smiling as the kid grinned and tried to copy him, looking down at his nose with big doe eyes. He squealed, and that’s when the boy’s father roused and sat up, blinking sleepily, and oh. The boy’s father had the same honey-doe eyes and he looked so cute, what with his mussed hair and pink cheeks as he caught Steve staring. “Hi,” Steve said, reaching over the little kid who was now gleefully exclaiming “Daddy! Daddy!” and reached his hand out to shake. “I’m Steve.”
The alpha grabbed a nipple and pinched it harshly, twisting, making him sob with pain and screw up his eyes, whining as the alpha grabbed his chin and jerked his head up. "Look at me, whore. Look at
Tony ducked his head, but Steve tipped his head up with a gentle hand under his chin. Steve still saw Tony flinch every time he moved too fast, and Tony was still holding rather terrifying expectations, but he needed to get this through. “Babydoll,” he murmured, brushing the barest kiss over Tony’s cheekbone. “I’m gonna ask you again. Do you wanna cook?”
Being married is weird. Everyone keeps looking at him with reverence and intrigue when they see the Captain walking alongside him, the hero from the war, the one that all the omega’s swooned over and the alphas wanted to be like.
When Tony comes back, Steve and Bucky are leaning towards each other, foreheads about an inch apart and talking in what looks to be secretive tones.
“We just got married, Steve.” Tony turned to look at him and Steve was horrified to see tears glittering in his eyes, reflecting proof of the grey eyed one’s blessing, even as they shone with sadness. “We just got married. I’m not with child, thank Zeus for that, and you are about to go off to fight someone else’s war in someone else’s land for someone else’s wife.”
Tony gave him a lethal side-eye, scrambling to his feet. “I am a fine specimen for human attractiveness and I will not stand for this slander,” Tony snaps immediately, hair askew and surprisingly offended, sashaying-as best a sweaty and greasy college boy could sashay-into their bedroom.
is not something he would use to describe anything right now. “Honey?” the alpha asks, and he twitches, because somebody else calls him honey, somebody with blonde hair, and a voice like sunshine, and blue eyes--he cringes. He remembers the alpha’s voice and the way he’d fucked into him cruelly, and he quivers, crying softly. His belly hurts.
Steve snicked and moved to rinse it out, chuckling at Tony’s purr before quickly soaping himself down. “Sweetheart?” he asked, rubbing Tony’s hip. “Awake?”
Steve hushes him. “No doll, you’re so good, my perfect omega, can’t imagine how I lucked out with you. Would Captain America lie?”
Even though Tony was crying and obviously upset, and Steve wasn’t exactly happy either, this was a nice change from ignoring each other.
“I need your help,” a sudden voice came from behind him and Steve jumped high enough and forcefully enough that his knee banged hard against the wood of his desk. Steve bt his lip and clutched his knee and swore internally in the case it was his boss. 'Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me', and all that.
1. I will be posting a chapter every Wednesday now that my schedule's been figured out, and near the end of the fic, I might post chapters twice a week; I'll keep y'all posted.
Tony pulled away, lacing steve and his’ hands together, and Steve squeezed to reassure himself. “Good. Now c’mon, you look like shit, Rogers.”
Tony rolled over, snuffling a little bit into the pillow. “Steve?” he mumbled, blinking open one eye.
Tony whined and went limp when Bucky attempted to move them both up. “Stop,” he groaned, sitting up when Bucky obligingly sat still. “It opens in fifteen minutes. We’re here early, because you, mister,” he poked Bucky’s chest, and Bucky couldn’t help but wrap Tony’s hands in his and press them to his chest. “No,” Tony complained. “You’re being sweet and distracting and it’s not helping.”
“We’ll get you new clothes soon,” Steve’s voice came from the doorway of the master suite. “I can’t imagine that’s comfortable.”
Tony flushes and Steve makes up his mind, grabbing one of his own comfortable t-shirts and pulling it over Tony’s head, grabbing his sweatpants and guiding Tony to his feet. “I’m going to dress you now,” he says firmly. “If you’re uncomfortable, or anything, anything at all, just say Manhatten, alright?” Steve says, picking something random for a safe phrase. “Say yes if you understand.”
Steve tucked Tony into his side. “I have to go,” he said softly after a moment’s silence. “If someone took you, I would tear the world apart to get you back,” and despite where the Fates had cruelly let them land he cracked a smile and the way Tony’s head ducked as a blush traveled up his neck and down the neckline of his dress at the affirmation of his love. “It’s only fair I extend the same courtesy.”
“Easy, easy,” Steve’s voice came closer, and Tony clenched his eyes shut. He would not cry, he wouldn’t--He tensed as he felt Steve put a hand on his back. “I’m not mad, baby doll, just confused. You did so well, so perfect with the journalists, much better than me, I’m so proud.” Steve ran gentle fingers through his hair and Tony sagged, his drop fading away from him.
Steve ran his thumb over the apple of Tony’s cheek, smirking as he caught sight of the hickey blossoming right under his jaw. Steve moved slowly, carefully to not wake the omega wake up and disturb his much-required sleep, before padding quietly to the bathroom to use the toilet and brush his teeth.
“How do you want me?” Tony asked, interrupting his train of thought. “I am yours to use as pleased, but how do you want me?”
, and-and-and--” Tony voice broke as he trembled, clutching the wooden spoon with white knuckles. “I--”
He goes to Tony’s tiny, tiny, suitcase -- for someone who is moving away from a home he is never to return to except for short visits deemed by Howard as
“No babydoll,” Steve interrupted, standing up so fast he knocked the chair right over. “You think--I would--you--oh sugar,” he whispered, going behind Tony when e turned back around to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist, and nuzzling at his shoulder, tantalizingly close to his marked-up bond mark. “Oh, sweetheart.”
“I can tell,” replied Steve, amused, and dried them both off, before helping Tony hobble over to the bed. “Better?”
Bucky grinned and tightened his grip carefully on the box, opening the door with one hand and trying his best not to jostle the contents of the box. His baby was at home, hopefully resting considering he was 6 months pregnant, and hopefully, this present could keep him company. He finally managed to get the door open, dropping his keys on the table placed conveniently there for this very purpose and carefully put the box, rolling his shoulders as the weight was taken off his arms. “Tony?” he called into the penthouse, striding towards the bedroom. “Baby?”
“Good boy,” Bucky murmured and grinned when Tony ducked his head a flush rising from his delicate collarbones to his cheeks. Bucky quickly pulled at the box, it falling open at a tug. It was an elaborate fake. Really it was just a kennel for the surprise inside with airholes and space for its contents, but it just looked any ordinary box. And out of the box sprung a little German Shepherd, its ears cocked up and skidding on the slick floors, nails clacking. “Hey little buddy,” Bucky murmured, picking up the puppy and smiling when it licked at his neck. “C’mon, let’s go meet your mama.”
Tony didn't say anything. “It’s not your fault.” Tony’s voice was gravelly and Steve was so glad for his grounding presence. He felt Tony’s chapped lips press against his temple. “It’s not.”
! please please please send me prompts and you can follow for some content that I might not put on here!
? To be away from early morning snacks in the kitchen with Ana when he couldn’t sleep, and late-night baking cannolis with his Mama because of their mile-wide sweet tooth? To be away from Jarvis who had patched him after many of Howard’s outbursts and the training sessions with the instructor who was supposed to teach him how to be a proper omega--something he was terrible at?
Tony nodded. He didn’t look entirely convinced, but Steve would convince him. He had the rest of their lives to do so anyway.
Tony whined helplessly, arching. “Becuase it’s forbidden?” he asked rhetorically. “Becuase if anyone finds out we’ll be hanging from the gallows within the hour, heir status be damned?”
“Honey,” Steve said, and when Tony looked cautiously back up through the hair that covered his eyes he could see Steve’s crinkled up face. “I’m not mad.”
“Thas’ shit,” Steve said vehemently, surprising himself as forceful as it came out. “It’s not jus’ for ‘an omega ‘ta do all the work at home, baby, it ain’t right.” He took a deep breath when he saw Tony staring at him, lips parted. “My Ma didn’t raise me that way, babydoll, it ain’t right.”
He turned back to the kid and went crosseyed, smiling as the kid grinned and tried to copy him, looking down at his nose with big doe eyes. He squealed, and that’s when the boy’s father roused and sat up, blinking sleepily, and oh. The boy’s father had the same honey-doe eyes and he looked so cute, what with his mussed hair and pink cheeks as he caught Steve staring. “Hi,” Steve said, reaching over the little kid who was now gleefully exclaiming “Daddy! Daddy!” and reached his hand out to shake. “I’m Steve.”
“Hush now,” he crooned, kissing Tony’s temple and rocking them back and forth. “I’m not lying to you baby, you really are so strong, you made it through Howard and those infernal lessons of yours, baby, I am so so proud. I am in
They fought like a well-oiled machine, one that made Tony’s engineering heart sing. “Looking good?” the Captain called through the comms, and Tony steadfastly ignored the ba-bump his heart made at Steve’s voice.
Tony squirmed and Steve shifted, trying to hide what that did to him. He knows that this is not something either of them are ready for, but he’s self-aware enough to know that he
I scrambled, trying to make it in time. I don’t know what my plan was, whether I was going to hold his hand and share the power, or if I was going to take the gauntlet and snap myself. I had superpowers, he didn’t. He couldn’t survive it.
I narrowed my eyes at him, and took a slow bite of my sandwich. “Not a single one of those reasons had anything to do with how you feel about him.”
The first one that came up was a conversation between Mr. Stark and Ms. Potts, dated about two months before they broke up.
That became a weekly tradition. However, one week, about a week from the start of the fall semester, I went into the city to hang out with Ned and MJ, and missed movie night. When I got back, though, Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers were asleep on the couch, the end of a Denzel Washington movie playing. Mr. Stark’s head was on Mr. Rogers’ shoulder, Mr. Rogers’ head resting on Mr. Stark’s.
Getting out of the shower, I toweled off with maybe the fluffiest towel I’d ever touched, and then got dressed and headed out to the living room.
When May got sick, I didn’t think about the possibility that she wouldn’t get better. She had to get better, right? The universe couldn’t be cruel enough to take away the last bit of family that I had. It couldn’t be cruel enough to take away the woman who’d become my mom.
There was a weird jingle, and the display lit up again. This time, instead of FRIDAY’s footage, there was Mr. Stark’s face. In the corner of the display, was the word EDWARD.
I walked home from the hospital that evening. The sky was a dark grey-blue, light rain wetting the cement under my feet. I had a backpack full of her stuff, things I’d brought her in the hospital to try to cheer her up. Old photos of the family, some of Uncle Ben’s old things that still carried the scent of cologne. A few of my academic awards. Stuff like that.
For a moment, I smiled to myself, imagining May commenting on exactly how much pent up chemistry Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers really had.
The funeral was bigger than we anticipated. Everyone from the neighbourhood had shown up. Homeless people she’d given spare change to, the bodega man with the funky Hawaiian shirts she always complimented, the staff from the Thai place that were all in love with her. Of course, Mr. Stark, Ms. Potts, Happy, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Barnes, Mr. Banner, Miss Romanoff, Mr. Barton, Mr. Thor, Col. Rhodes, an ambassador from Wakanda (since I guess King T’Challa couldn’t make it), Mr. Lang, Miss Maximoff, Mr. Vision, and Mr. Wilson. And MJ and Ned.
I took a deep, shaky breath. “I saw him steal the infinity stones from Thanos. I tried to make it in time, to-to steal the gauntlet and snap myself or to hold his hand ma-maybe and spread out the force so he didn’t have to take it all. But I wasn’t fast enough.”
“Uh, Steve made the grilled cheese. I got distracted a burnt the first one. Hot chocolate is my mom’s recipe. I know it’s not May’s, but…”
It had been three weeks and four days since May had passed away. Six months, two weeks since the doctors told her she wouldn’t make it to see me off to college.
Not that I did a lot of walking to the kitchen for the first week or two after the funeral. I spent most of my time in bed, facing buried in a pillow, feeling utterly empty.
When we got home, to the cabin, Morgan wanted some time alone in her tent. Happy went back to the compound to deal with some business. Mr. Rogers and I sat on the porch in silence.
When I got there, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Stark were bickering over which movie to watch. Mr. Stark was arguing for
“Hey, you haven’t lost all of your family. You’ve got your friends, right? Ned and Michelle? And obviously everyone at the compound. Family isn’t just blood.”
The shower I had here was…huge. It had weird features, too. Massage jets, steam functions, speakers embedded in the walls. Not that I didn’t absolutely love all of the weird features. It was amazing. I stayed in there until I was an especially wrinkly prune.
There was a weird…tension in the room, the whole movie. I was sitting between them on the couch, and they kept glancing at each other over me, acting like they were checking on me if the other caught their gaze.
We sat out there and watched the sun set over the water, over the bundle of flowers with a glimmer of metal and glass in the centre.
“Women’s studies. It’s killing me. We had a guest speaker today, and he was absolutely awful. Talked a lot of shit about how women are warriors but have been taught to be docile and therefore allowed ourselves to be pushed aside in society.”
There was a long pause, and then a sigh. “Alright. I’ll go shopping. You gotta help me with the gift wrap, though. And maybe I’ll get some calligraphy done for the note.”
A sob wracked my body. And then another, and another, and I let myself curl up on the ground, crying hard, wishing May were here to hug me and stroke my hair and make it all better.
And then, over the course of the next few months, they seemed to settle into the relationship. There was the occasional fight, always resolved with hugs and then some…much less PG activities. I usually stayed in the safety of my room those nights, with headphones in. I did not need to know anything about their sex life.
I spent about a week in bed, wallowing, before I guess Morgan had had enough. She came into my room one day, jumping on the bed.
It was time to stop worrying, I figured. The worst had come and gone. She wasn’t in pain anymore. She was with Ben, hopefully happy. Peaceful.
On one particular night, I’d arrived late, slightly ruffled by some swinging around and webbing up bad guys.
“Mr. Stark?” I asked, turning around. It felt like every cell in my body was fighting, clinging to each other. It hurt like hell. “I don’t feel so good.”
The apartment seemed cold when I walked in. I didn’t bother turning the lights on, or bringing the backpack all the way to my room. I set it down next to the front door and went to the kitchen, opening the fridge.
I found myself in Mr. Stark’s workshop one night, going through FRIDAY’s tapes, trying to find conversations about me. I don’t know why, but I had the urge to find out what Mr. Stark said about me when I wasn’t around.
For starters, my new room was the size of the entire apartment May and I had. Huge bathroom, giant bed, tons of bookshelves and desk space, all of the lab equipment and chemicals I needed to make web fluid, access to FRIDAY. It was insane.
He stays still in silence, feeling fluids drip down his thighs and onto the cold floor with a sickening noise, thighs shaking. The alpha seems to notice and gently puts her hand on his calf, rubbing it soothingly. It feels nice, he thinks distantly, and that makes him giggle because
His eyes water at the pain and oh no, he knew it wasn’t going to last, he fucked up, he did, and he had to get it cleaned up before Steve came home. He doesn’t know where the broom is, he realizes belatedly and drops to his knees, ignoring the sharp pain of glass in his legs.
Tony detangled his legs from Steve’s waist, and Steve let him, removing his hands from where they were clutching at Steve’s probably rather mussed hair. “We shouldn’t,” the young heir said, wringing his hands. “We are not--we cannot,” he started, but Steve interrupted him, his voice low. He knew where this was going.
Bucky kissed the top of his head and sighed, moving so that Tony was seated comfortably in his lap. “Can we go? Sweetheart, you’re cold an’ tired, an’ frankly I ain’t enjoyin’ this either. Let’s go, school don’t start for another hour.”
Tony nodded. “Father used to go on about you and your whole squad for ages. I know more about you than I think I ever needed to know.”
Steve blinked and took a step back. Sir? That was deeply enrooted in Old Way protocol, and as far as he knew it was just Howard’s generation that followed that still. It didn’t make sense for Tony to be calling him that basically saying that he, as an omega, was somehow less than Steve. “You don’t need to call me sir,” he said definitively. “Just Steve is fine.”
He sobs and the tears are making it hard to see the glass and his vision is whiting out, panic on the brink of tipping and he sobs even though he is already short on breath.
“Without wanting to hurt me,” the quiet response came and Steve bit his lip. His omega pushed up against him to scent him, and Steve let him, walking them back to the bed and tugging Tony into his lap, a soft noise of pleasure coming out of him as he was warmed from head to toe. His omega was so pleased with such a simple act of being cuddled and held, something that all omegas should be accustomed to. The poor thing must’ve been so neglected to get so happy at such a basic touch from what was essentially a stranger to him.
Steve tilts up his chin, looking into Tony’s own before he remembers to drop them. He knows better than to look a dom in the eyes. Strike two.
“Okay, so you can see why the sudden abundance of baked good is a problem right? I mean--” Tony scratched the back of his neck, shifting uncomfortably. “I’m about as emotionally stunted as they come, but, like, if you need someone to talk to?” he peeked up from where he was staring at Bucky’s neck and locked eyes with Bucky, where the other man was staring with a little bit of amusement and a lot of trepidation. “You know I’m here right?”
Tony smiled sweetly and scented him softly, burrowing close to his chest. “I can cook,” he said, muffled into his chest. “I got it.”
“You’re so bad,” the alpha hissed into his ear, pounding into him in a way that made the cuts on his back and ass light up from where he was rubbing against the scratchy wall. “You’re bad, such a bad fucking
we finally meet bucky! and also, steve is very Not Okay. this chappie is a little bit longer than some of the other ones, so hope y'all enjoy!
," the stranger hissed, throwing his head back as Tony was filled again, for what? The fifth time? "You're bad, yes?" he said after a second. "Just so you know." Tony jerked, shuddering as the knot was ripped out of him again. He could feel come and spit and what was probably blood dripping down his thighs, and he sagged as the restraints that kept him tied up were taken down and he dropped unceremoniously to the floor, the world going white and fuzzy as his ankle made a snapping noise when his legs couldn't hold him up. He slumped, looking up with wet eyes as an alpha grabbed him by the hair and yanked him up.
Tony shuddered at the statement, a fire lighting inside him. “You can’t go,” Tony said fiercely, clutching the fabric of Steve’s tunic. “I won’t let you.”
Sam grinned and slouched back in the diner booth. “Damn. So you’re the stupid best friend! He goes on about you for ages.”
“Uh, you were asleep and you’re son looked like he was about to throw a tantrum of epic proportions, and you looked like you needed to sleep, so I was just making faces at your kid to keep him entertained.” Steve flushed at the ramble of words that spilled out of his mouth. “I didn’t mean to overstep.”
“S’okay,” Tony said, baring his neck for easier access. “But maybe we should’ve cleaned up before bed.”
Tony scooted closer to him, nuzzling at the hollow of his neck and Steve could feel his muscles going limp as Tony’s soothing omega scent rolled over him. “We gotta get dinner.”
“The kids want us to date,” Steve murmured into Tony’s hair as they lied in bed, brushing a kiss over his temple as he felt the other teacher snort.
2. I still don't know how long this is gonna be. I was thinking around 15, but I'm not gonna put anything down, because again, I've got no idea.
And I'm done! I am honestly so proud of myself, I was behind like a whole week and I got it done on time anyway.
so, it's kind late because usually i post in the afternoon, but i'm legit a hot a hot mess rn with school and other stuff and i am so so sorry and i low-key hate this chappie but whatever.
They had come a far way in two weeks from their first few days together and they’d put together a schedule about how Tony did that cooking, and Steve did the laundry (Tony vehemently hated the laundry), the rest of the chores divided by day. Tony smiled more, he laughed more, he lounged semi-comfortably in their living room with less fear of judgment. He joked, and as the weeks passed, Steve got more and more of a look at
“You didn’t like him either, baby,” Steve started but winced as his back finally made a creaking noise he couldn’t ignore. “But I’d be happier to complain about him not twisted around?” he asked hopefully, turning back around and patting the seat next to him. “Sit with me? Better angle to see your pretty face anyway, baby."
Tony sighed. “Don’t pick an argument with me when I’m about to fall asleep in the bath. Damn, it’s like I’m an old person.”
Steve smiled down at him and Tony didn’t even have to look to see it considering he could smell it. “No problem,” he murmured, and Tony whimpered under his breath as his new husband kissed his hairline. It was
Steve tucked Tony into his side. “I have to go,” he said softly after a moment’s silence. “If someone took you, I would tear the world apart to get you back,” and despite where the Fates had cruelly let them land he cracked a smile at the way Tony’s head ducked as a blush traveled up his neck and down the neckline of his dress at the affirmation of his love. “It’s only fair I extend the same courtesy.”
“Months!” the next shout came, and Tony flinched minutely as all of them swiveled towards him, tucking an errant curl behind his ear.
Tony grinned, dinner ignored. “I think you just might be,” he joked shakily and purring as Steve sighed, chest rumbling and brushing his lips against Tony’s soft cheek, and the omega leaned down to brush his lips against Steve’s again. “You just might.”
"No,” Steve rushed to say, pulling Tony into a kiss that he hoped consolidated all of his feelings. He couldn’t
“No!” Tony said, blushing himself when Bucky stared at him with ice-blue eyes. His eyes have a bit of green in them, isn’t that interesting? His brain idly thought and Tony forcefully shoved that interesting tidbit of information away for when he was ahem alone. Tony stepped out of his doorway, but held the door open with one foot, awkwardly hopping and tugging Bucky a little closer. “No, it’s not the desserts that are the problem. Uh, you said that you baked when you were stressed and sad?” he looked up at Bucky to receive confirmation, and gently maneuvered them back to his doorway so he could stand normally.
“Does anybody else know about this?” Natasha asked, successfully breaking up Steve and Clint’s staring contest, waving a fry between Steve and Tony.
Tony swallowed. “I mean. If you want it to be a date then I’m okay with that. But if you don't!" he protested. "Then that's totally cool, and if you don't want to, like, ever ta--”
Steve’s scent spikes anger again and then calms down into something soothing and reassuring. “Shh, honey,” Steve mumbles and rights him, apologizing when Tony whimpers as another cramp wracks through him. “C’mon, I’ve got you,” he says rocking them both back and forth, and Tony starts crying all over again, an action that makes Steve cup his face and wipe away the tears tenderly. “I’ve got you, Tones. C’mere precious, nobody’s gonna hurt you anymore. We can go home to our nest and I’ll take care of you the whole time, nobody’s gonna hurt you.” Steve keeps this up the entire time until the first alpha from before, the one with the fiery red hair and had been kind to him, opens the door and makes Steve get up.
Being married is weird. Everyone keeps looking at him with reverence and intrigue when they see the Captain walking alongside him, the hero from the war, the one that all the omega’s swooned over and the alphas wanted to be like. Before everyone looked at him like he wasn’t worth their time or ignored him completely, and to be scrutinized now whether he is worthy of the Captain is different.
Steve snickered before following him and pulling the omega into his lap, kissing his temple. “What happened to your voice?”
And then it all comes spilling out, how he’d startled and dropped the glass, and he didn’t know where the broom was or if he was allowed to use it, and how he was sorry he’d broken his property and he was trying to clean and---
Soon enough another pair of footsteps stop at the door and he can hear a choked gasp from the doorway. "Oh, Tony."
Dodger rolled over and wagged his tail, giving Steve the smuggest doggy face that Steve had ever seen. He barked happily when Tony began to rub his belly and padded around him to put his head with a soft whine on Tony’s thigh.
“Oh, no!” he exclaimed, something that gave Tony quite a jolt. “I’m not going to, I would never,” he babbled, setting Tony down and kneeling in front of him, off the bed. “I would never, ever have sex with you unless you wanted it.”
"We'll leave you here," the stranger murmurs with sickening softness. "And you can stay." Tony's stomach hurts, he doesn't know what's going on, he wants his mate, he wants
Tony sighed and blew the hair out of his face. “Peter, if you or anybody else from your class tell Mr. Rogers this, I will actually make you guys write essays for the rest of the year.”
Sam appeared next, walking with Shuri and T’Challa’s mother, Ramonda. They walked to the front before Ramonda sat down in her designated seat. The music faded then changed to indicate that Shuri was next to appear. She walked out, holding arms with T’Challa, both wearing the most elegant traditional attire appropriate for a modern Wakandan wedding.
“Of all of the people I’ve had the opportunity to work with, Tony Stark is perhaps the most fascinating.” Thor offered.
Tony could barely listen to Obadiah ramble on about essentially nothing. He contributed from time to time when prompted, telling himself that remaining calm would be the only way to deal with Obadiah until they figured out what to do with Synergy.
Tony reached out a hand to do the same to Steve, but Steve could tell that he was still upset from their conversation. Steve swallowed; he held still before leaning downward toward Tony’s face, but stopped short not entirely sure what he wanted to do next. He felt Tony physically reacting to him, but before he could get closer, he felt a hand on his chest.
Usually, Bucky and Sam would have a tough time getting Steve to go out with them. Steve preferred staying in and making dinner while trading memories amongst themselves privately. This time around, however, Bucky and Sam had successfully convinced their friend that he needed to be more social. Although a little irritated by the pestering, Steve understood why: it had been awhile since he had been in a relationship, or on a date for that matter, and he knew his friends were only being nice in their efforts to get him to meet new people.
