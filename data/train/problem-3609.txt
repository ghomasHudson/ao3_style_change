“I’m, I’m a bit drunk, I don’t, I thought you might. Thought I could show you--” Dean rambles, looking at you slightly terrified. It occurs to you, you never made it clear how much you wanted it. You’re not sure how to tell him now, though. Because it feels like electrification. Like if you could rewire the synapses of every living creature on the planet, they’d spark to short circuit. He’s false ions. You’re burning. It’s so much.
The first thing Dean did was lie to Castiel, and frankly Cas thinks it’s one of the cruellest things he’s ever done. He knows it’s supposed to be for him, but it’s just a mockery and it teases the shattering hope and overwhelming pain in his chest like nothing else.
Cas held his hand out to the side, palm up, as an invitation for Dean to take it.  Dean made several aborted motions before giving in and clasping Castiel’s hand.  Dean felt an odd sensation, as if he were inhaling ice water.  Then, there was an odd sensation in his mind, like a flock of birds was taking off in there.  Several memories were yanked to the surface.  He didn’t really see what they had to do with each other until they were placed before him like this.
“I told you, Angelic thinking on gender is not the same as human thinking.  I myself only answer to male pronouns because I got used to it.  Most of my vessels have been male.”
Dean had seen that face before.  It was the face Cas had made when he was trying to understand Dean’s porn.
“Nephilim are super off limits.  He probably needed time to come around to the fact that yours isn’t like…  this guy.”
Sam had a million tabs open about Nephilim.  Dean had just finished telling him about the very real existence of his nephew.  Sam was eager to learn more.
Dean’s mind supplied him with an image of naked Cas, which he liked.   He thought of not touching Cas, and decided that he’d rather keep scenting him, thank you very much.  Castiel let out a long suffering sigh.
Dean pulled back enough for Cas to cum into his mouth.  He came so much that Dean couldn’t swallow all of it at once and it spilled over his chin.  Dean’s eyes watered and his throat was so sore, but it was so worth it.  Cas hauled him up by the armpits and kissed him hard. Cas licked the cum from Dean’s chin and claimed his mouth.  Dean melted.  This was nice.  He wanted to keep doing this forever.
Cas was beating him and beating him hard.  His eyes were blank and ruthless.  Dean couldn’t see Cas in them at all.
“Angels don’t think of watching and privacy in the same way that you do Dean.  The angelic part of them is always clued in on what I am doing. They are one with me.  However, I have learned that humans tend to like their privacy from their offspring during carnal activities.  I have informed them that this is our alone time and that it would be impolite of them to spy.  I have also wrapped them in my grace so that they do not feel isolated.”
Just as soon as Dean pulled the trigger, Jack let out a sound that Sam could not hear.  He could not hear it, but he could feel the way Jack screamed.  The sound physically pushed himself and Dean back and up into the air.  Sam could see the nephilim’s power radiating off of them like heat waves.  Jack’s face was twisted into something frightening.  Sam and Dean hit the floor, hard.  Sam has to collect himself.  He moved through the pain.  His eyes were shut tight as he moved to get up.  Sam heard the patter of Jack’s bear feet as he ran.
Dean tackled Cas to the mattress, disgusted to find that Cas was only wearing his robe.  He pulled it open and yanked it aside before plunging in.  His teeth found Cas’s neck and locked onto it.
Cas felt secure under the human weight of Dean.  Dean’s scent was bright, healthy and masculine.  He was extremely aroused,  His breath smelled of Castiel’s release.  Castiel could still taste it inside of his own mouth.  He wanted to remember this scent forever.  Natural lubricant leaked from him as Dean’s hips snapped against his own.  He let out a mournful moan, wanting so badly to know what Dean felt like without that foolish plastic balloon separating the two of them.  Castiel felt that, after everything they had been through together, nothing should come between them.  Dean’s breath was hot against the back of his neck.
Dean smiled in a way that suggested that he was surprised, pleased, and affectionate.  He took Cas’s Cock in his hand and kissed his neck.  Castiel surprised at first, but then he dissolved into a whimpering mess.  Dean swallowed his cry as he came all over his chest and stomach.  Castiel kissed Dean.  Kissing was something he knew well. He wished to show Dean that he appreciated and loved him.  Cas hadn’t really been planning on getting off.  He had just been really enjoying watching Dean enjoy himself.  He kissed and licked his way down, cleaning his come up off of Dean.  Dean had done that to him before.  It had felt very nice.  Castiel wanted Dean to feel nice things.  Dean watched him through his lashes.  He hissed when Castiel licked up the cum that was still all over his cock.  Dean’s eyes went wide and he yanked Castiel up by the hair.  Castiel went.  Dean wanted another kiss. Something sweet and chaste this time. Castiel was just starting to get a rhythm on what to do when Dean climbed on top of him.
Castiel bowed his head, allowing himself to be vulnerable.  He rotated his hips.  He needed more.  It was good, but it wasn’t enough.  He needed Dean’s knot, the needed Dean’t teeth. He needed Dean’s cum.  Dean shushed him and Castiel realised that he had been begging.  He wined long and low.
Castiel growled.  Dean whined and rolled his hips.  He set a luxurious pace, whining helplessly.  Castiel was breathless.  The pads of his fingers stroked Dean’s cheekbones. Dean’s eyes were wet, but he never looked away, continuing the sinuous roll of his hips.  A few tears fell onto Castiel’s face. They tasted salty.  Castiel cherished them.  He watched Dean’s pupils open wide with arousal.  One of Dean’s hands held Castiel’s hip while the other wondered.  It ran up his abs, pinched at his nipples, and closed around his throat for a moment of pressure.  Then it traveled back down to massage Castiel’s balls.  They felt warm and secure when Dean cupped them in his palm.  Dean grinned a little shyly before taking Cas’s dick in his hand. Castiel blinked, but did not look away from Dean’s face.  Dean’s hand was rough and too dry, but it belonged to Dean. He welcomed the pleasure-pain.  He tilted his hips to meet Dean’s.  Dean’s hips stuttered.
Dean plopped down next to Cas in nothing but a pair of boxer briefs.  He couldn’t seem to look Cas in the face.
He had just died.  He was dead, but now he wasn’t.  Something warm, good, and powerful pulsed through Castiel.
Castiel watched as Dean shoved a pillow under his hips.  Dean rose to his knees, looking picturesque.  Dean locked eyes with Castiel and his cock brushed Cas’s hole.  It was then that Castiel realised that Dean’t cock was naked.  Before Castiel could think too long, or react, Dean was pushing inside.  Dean held eye contact as he bottomed out.  They both groaned at the feel of it.  Castiel couldn’t believe how much better this was.  It was amazing how Dean was mixing with him so deeply and completely.  He looked into Dean’s eyes.  It was satisfying to see that Dean was struggling not to roll his eyes back.  Dean stayed like that for a while. Panting and letting the occasional keen slip out.  Castiel found himself grinning.  He was perfect.
“They were worried. I do not think they understand that humans need time.  I told them that you wanted to meet them, but we needed to move at a much more human pace.”
Cas was right.  The heat was building in Dean’s gut.  Cas took such good care of him. Dean made an agreement noise as he sucked a mark into Cas’s skin.  It looked so pretty. Cas should always be marked up like this.  Dean gasped as Cas angled his hips, grasped Dean’s cock, and took it into himself all in one swift motion. Dean rotated his hips languidly as he sucked more bruises into Cas’s hairline.
Dean blinked quickly.  The guilt threatened to overwhelm, but Cas’s scent was so nice and soothing.  Dean whimpered and gulped it in greedily.
Castiel felt Dean brush his side and grumbled as he moved over.  Dean laughed good naturedly.  Wait, when had Dean taken his shirt and pants off?  Why was he only in his underwear?
Sam’s shoulders slumped.  He could still see a tear drying on Dean’s cheek.  Dean’s face set into an expression that gave nothing away.  He said nothing, so Sam spoke.
“I've got some fake slick to ease the way…  You know how I opened you up during your heat?... With my hand?...”
Dean felt himself give in.  The condom had really been out of habit.  Cas pulled his fingers out, leaving Dean feeling cored and empty.  Cas rolled him over.  Dean supposed this was how Cas wanted it.  Dean went pliant.  He spread his legs wide.  His ass was clenching around nothing.  He watched Cas’s brow furrow in concentration as he took his pretty cock in his hand and…  Dean’t breath caught in his chest.  Cas was just rubbing the freshly slicked up head over his ass and a couple of times. His ass was so hungry that when cas applied pressure, the muscles sucked him in.  Dean felt all of the breath leave his body.  It felt weird and good and wow Cas looked great between his thighs.  His eyes were dark.  He was breathtaking up there with all of those rippling muscles and that scent.  Dean’s breath hitched as Cas bottomed out.  Cas ran his big hands over Dean’s torso and Down to his face.  Cas shifted his weight and kissed him in a way that was both filthy and sweet.  Dean was really getting used to the feeling of Cas’s cock.  He was actually rather enjoying it.  Cas started to wonder, nibbling his neck and telling him how lovely he was, how good he felt.
“Betas came when humans arrived.  The archangel Raphael, the head healer, arranged it so that Angels would not present and remain sterile unless there was a shortage of angels.  This text doesn’t say how to undo it or how he did it.  I think he was trying to keep the angels under control and easy to train as warriors.”
Cas seemed to be enjoying the attention.  He hummed happilly and fucked himself on Dean’s fingers.  Dean’s hand was getting soar, but Cas didn’t seem to be getting any closer.  He thought he knew what would help.  He had done it in his twenties for some of his cliants who had been nervous about taking an actual knot and getting stuck.  Most times it worked.
Castiel sat at the kitchen table, waiting for Sam and Dean to come down and have their nightly beer.  He had three bottles of sweating beer.  He heard them before he saw them.
Castiel ignored Dean and continued toward Lucifer.  His only goal was to keep the devil away from Jack.  Dean was frantically calling for him.  Sam was shouting.  They fell silent as they faded through the portal.  There stood Lucifer…  Smirking like he had any right. A fresh wave of agony reminded Castiel that he had to act.
He said it as a joke.  It wasn’t like it wasn't true.  He really had been worried that Cas was now damaged because Dean had touched him.  Cas took hold of Dean’s face in his hands.  It was not the first time Cas had pinned him with those otherworldly eyes.  It was always like Cas really saw him when he looked at him like that.
Dean smelled another wave of Cas’s heat.  It was at a low simmer, but soon, Cas would be a begging wreck again.  Dean was glad that he was already hard from having Cas’s cock in his mouth, from hearing Cas as he came.  He was already excited.
Dean forgot that he didn’t cuddle and let a very vulnerable looking Cas cling to him.  Cas was making this humming sound.  They were both shaking and Cas’s eyes were wet.   Dean had to kiss him.  What else was there for it?  He’d felt Cas, down to his grace.  It had been pretty scary, but Cas loved him.  He was purely devoted, utterly lost, and it made sense.  Maybe Dean hadn’t seen it before because he didn’t want to.  Maybe he had seen it, but was too chickenshit to admit that he knew what it was.  A lot of stuff Cas said and did were making even more sense now.  Cas had thrown his family away, given up an army, and cured Dean from being a demon with Sam.  Cas had been about to kill him, but his declarations of need had been enough to bring Cas out of the trance.  Dean had been about to confess his love.  If Cas really did kill him, then he didn’t want anything left unsaid.  Dean had choked and said “need” instead, which had been enough.  Not to mention the way Cas looked at him, like he saw someone worth living for.  His eyes said; you are worth my time, you're worth everything I do for you, and so much more.  The ‘I love you you silly human’ was there too, but Dean had chalked it up to Cas being Cas.  Cas was a weird, dorky guy.  How was Dean supposed to know what he was thinking?  The problem with that was that Dean could read Cas.  Cas wasn’t when compared to humans, but he had a subtle way of holding his weight, moving his shoulders, using his eyes to talk without saying anything.  Dean knew exactly what Cas was telling him through long, heated glances, and just swallowed it with bottle after bottle of booze. Dean hadn’t wanted Cas to return his affection, because that meant losing more if he lost Cas.  Dean loved the feathery bastard.  His soul had probably been all over Cas.  How embarrassing.
Cas’s whistling snore interrupted Dean’s spiraling thoughts.  Cas shouldn’t have to sleep, but he must be pretty torn up after that Attack Dog spell, and he had lost a lot of…  well, angel blood.  Dean made a mental note to get him a gatorade or something and make him something to eat later just in case.  He did really have to admit that sleeping Cas was a pretty funny and adorable concept.  Last time he had commented on it, Sam had shot him down with a big old “angels don’t sleep.”  Here Cas was, snoozing away.  His cheek was pillowed on Dean’s shoulder, the one with the fresh ritual brand.  Dean just kind of held Cas and waited for the other shoe to drop. Dean wasn’t going to get to just have this.  There was going to be a catch.  When Sam called, Dean was able to fish his phone out of his discarded pants pocket.  Cas grumbled.
Then, in a long ago room, Zachariah was trying to get Dean out of the way.  Cas had appeared to help him.  He had been so close, with his hand on Dean’s mouth.  Then Cas had activated the angelic banishing sigil, and he was gone.
Dean clenched his hand into a fist to keep from touching his own cock, which was currently tenting his jeans.
“Rest.  If I’m not in the nest when you wake up, I’m right outside the door.  You can come and get me like you did before.  I won’t be upset.”
When Dean woke up, it was to an oddly pleasing sensation. Something warm and wet circled his hole.  His legs had been pushed apart enough to expose his asshole.  His knot had gone down, but his dick was half-way filled with blood, resting cheerfully against his thigh.  Dean, who was still mostly asleep, luxuriated in the soft attention. The tongue(yeah, that was definitely a tongue) swiped over his hole a couple of times, circled it, and swiped again. Dean stretched, pressing his hips up into the touch.  His hole loosened and unfurled, opening up to more attention…  His nerve endings buzzed pleasantly.  He wanted it more…  Deeper…  Hands spread his cheeks wide and the mouth that was currently licking him open, moaned openly.  He’d know that voice anywhere.
There was a light flutter under Cas’s skin.  Their baby had a name.  Dean was going to be a father.  They were going to be parents.  Dean was scared shitless.
“But it's not and everyone who knows you, sees it.  Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love.”
Cas was perfect.  He did his best to look out for Dean, to protect Dean.  Dean was hungry, but he had to say one thing.  God he hated talking.
“Dean, Cas could survive a normal fever, but let me pose a theory.  Say the fever keeps going up and up until something gives and even he can’t handle it anymore?”
Sam left the two of them sitting on Cas’s bed with Dean holding Cas’s bleeding arm.  Cas told him that he didn’t have to do this.  Dean knew that, if he could save Cas, that he did have to.
Cas prattling on about animal testing and bumble bees while he wore scrubs from the mental hospital.  He had taken Sam’s burden onto himself.  He had given Dean a wide eyed, glassy look and claimed that he was ‘cursed.’  The Winchesters should not want him around.  Dean’s throat tightened.  He remembered what he had said next.
Dean smirked at him and raised an eyebrow.  Castiel would have sunk to his knees right there if Dean had asked.  He would have stuck his face right into Dean’s crotch and gotten everything nice and wet and hard if Dean made any indication that he might want him to.
The two of them were covered in leftover semen, slick, and sweat, so Dean found Cas another dead-old-guy bathrobe.
Dean whined in his throat and his knot popped at the thought.  Cas stroked his back through his orgasm.  He whimpered and bit down just a bit more so that his canines pierced skin. Dean immediately scented a change.  Cas purred with contentment.  His scent was filled with relief and mellow bonding hormones.  Dean would be lying if he said he hadn’t been anxious about those.  Now, he couldn’t imagine why.  He unlatched his jaw and buried his face down behind Cas’s ear, snuffling at the scent gland.  Cas seemed perfectly content to just hold him, to pet his hair, to intertwine his fingers with Dean’s, to kiss his knuckles.  Dean snuffed at Cas’s scent gland.  His head was cloudy from the bonding hormones and post orgasmic fatigue.
Dean placed both hands atop Castiel’s shoulders.  Castiel looked into his eyes one more time, silently pleading with him to back out.  When Dean didn’t so much as flinch, Castiel squeezed his shoulder with one hand.  He closed his eyes, thankful for the darkness.  His bleeding grace ached for the soul that was in front of it.  It knew where to go.  He allowed it to direct his hand, pushing through Dean’s body as carefully as possible.  He felt Dean’s head fall against his shoulder.  Dean hid his face in Castiel’s neck and he made a small sound.  Castiel’s grace rejoiced at the reunion with Dean’s soul.  It flicked it with tendrils aand swirled around it in weak spirals.  Dean was breathing hard against his neck.
“And we should name a certain someone. The sooner he has a name, the sooner I can actually think of myself as a dad.”
Castiel stood from the table.  Jack had grown quickly.  Cas looked more pregnant that he should, but how would they know?  There was no president for this.  There were no records of any Omega angels giving birth to nephilim.  Cas might not need nine months.  Jack could be ready to be born any day now, for all they knew.
Dean was trying to focus on his words, but Cas had decided to take his cock in his hand and the washcloth.  He treated it no differently than he did the rest of Dean’s body, but his cock was over sensitive.  Dean let out a hiss through his teeth.  Cas gave the foreskin a little kiss and let go.  The touch was so sweet and non sexual.  Dean didn’t know what to do with himself.
Dean leaned back, stroking his back.  It soothed the fever a little.  Castiel told Dean that a knot wasn’t enough.  This heat needed something else if they were to quench the fires.  Dean’s hands faltered when Castiel tried to explain.
Clearly Cas was not cool with being woken up.  He was grumbly and grumpy. At the same time, he was nuzzled and scraped his beard over Dean’s tattoo.  Sam made a really annoying voice, like he knew exactly what was going on.
Castiel pulled himself back onto the bed and did as he was told.  He was so surprised and thankful that he didn’t ask any questions.  His blue eyes were wide and shiny as he peered over his shoulder at Dean.  Dean’s scent was helping him feel lucid, centered even.  He flinched in Surprise when Dean’s hand grazed his tender hole.
Dean held up a hand and almost smiled.  He almost laughed too.  Jack knew what Dean’s smile and laugh looked like.  They wanted Dean to smile at them.  Dean didn’t seem able to.  Sam rolled his eyes at Dean.
Cas’s scent spiked with pleasure.  He ‘mmm’ed again.  Dean whimpered a little.  Cas pulled his cheeks wide and thrust hard.  Dean gasped as one of Cas’s slicked up fingers joined his tongue.  Having Cas’s slick inside of his hole was wild.  It was pure chemistry.  The smell of Cas’s slick inside was oddly arousing.  His muscles loosened enough for two of Cas’s fingers.  Cas let his tongue wonder around the stretched rim, causing Dean to shiver.   It was so nice to be full.  Cas brought more of his musky slick and stretched him slowly, gently, with a third finger.  He didn’t seem to mind that he had to take his time.  In fact, Cas smelled content, as if he would be perfectly happy to fist Dean as long as he wanted.  Cas’s tongue disappeared.  Dean’s skin was cold where Cas’s breath had heated his flesh.  Dean whimpered a little, which was embarrassing.  He needn’t have worried.  Cas’s mouth was back on him, this time, on his scrotum and balls.  He kissed them and licked them wetly, like it was just the thing you do.  His scent was pleased.  Dean was so hard that it almost hurt.  The gentle swipes of Cas’s tongue, his rough stubbled cheek, his fingers sliding in and out of Dean’s well stretched ass.  It was almost too much sensation.  His knot would pop and that would be embarrassing.  Cas wasn’t even fucking him yet.  Oh god Cas was gonna fuck him…
“I've been so unhappy all this time.  The one thing I want is the one thing I thought I couldn’t have.”
Cas blinked a couple of times.  Dean led him out of the shower stall and wrapped him in the robe he’d brought for him.  Cas wasn’t all the way here right now, but he was beautiful.
They were clumsy and awkward, but they made it up stairs.  Cas flopped down onto Dean’s bed.  His chest still glistened with holy oil.  Dean’s dick seemed to find that interesting.  While he was busy getting the lube, Cas was busy ridding himself of pants and drawers and oh wow that was a dick.  Dean was ready to have a freak out.  He usually did, right before messing around with a man, but that didn’t really happen.  Cas was really just Cas.  Dean had let him touch his soul, for crying out loud.  As if reading his mind, Cas spoke.
Dean didn’t want to admit that his big puppy dog of a brother was right.  Cas had been so wide eyed and insistent.   Then he had been all ‘oh Dean, you are right.  I am terrible.  I shall go pout now.  Have good dreams while you sleep alone. I hate myself.’
Dean stated before lying down on his back.  He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply as he situated something around his rather large erection.  Castiel glared at the rubber thing around Dean’s penis as if it had called him a series of rude names.  Dean cleared his throat.
Dean asked.  He found himself putting pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding, as if that would work.
“Here you go.  It's cereal. You mix it with milk and eat it with a spoon.  The cookie one really isn’t good for you.”
Castiel looked down.  Blood ran steadily from Castiel’s ruined pelvis, dripping down his thighs, running down his calves.  Too bad his grace was too fractured to do anything about the stain.
Castiel had wandered into Dean’s room.  Dean’s stomach clenched again.  If Cas were a normal human omega, then he would be able to get through a heat on his own.  Mated omegas had an easier time of it when their mates were there to help.  Under the heat smell, Dean could detect Cas’s other emotions.  He had been incredibly sad.  Dean could smell his tears and the bitter hint of physical pain.  Confusion was woven through all of that like fine thread. Confusion and distress.
Dean bit his shoulder gently and wound his hands around Cas’s descended belly.  Cas was mated and pregnant and marked up.  Dean had done that.  He was in Dean’s nest.  Cas had told Dean to take him here.  He was so full of cum already, but he just needed more of Dean’s cock.  Dean growled at that thought.  If Cas weren’t already pregnant, Dean would be pushing his seed so deep, that Cas’s womb would have no choice.  Dean’s cum was just that good. Dean pushed his knot in, locking his seed inside.  Dean touched Cas’s cock lazily.  Cas told Dean that he was good.  That Dean could cum if he wanted.  Dean came then, because Cas said he could. Cas turned his head, giving him gentle kisses as he rode out the orgasm. Dean took his hand off of Cas’s belly to play with his nipple.  That seemed to be enough to send Cas over the edge.  Cas opened his mouth in a silent scream and filled Dean’s hand.  Dean nibbled behind Cas’s ear.
Castiel stayed with Dean for the two days that his rut lasted.  Dean pressed against Cas, earnest in his declarations of need.  If Castiel left to grab supplies that Sam had dropped off,  or to talk to Sam, it would bring Dean to angry tears.  He would pull Castiel back inside and below
In the car, Jack felt itchy in the place where their skin had been tattooed.  They picked at the bandaging to find it healed over.  The ink had disappeared.
Dean wondered why that was his only issue here.  He did not want to talk about this.  Not when his knot was so warm inside of Cas.  Not while he felt safe with Cas winding his fingers through his hair like that.
Dean wasn’t having this shit.  He squeezed Cas so tightly that it would have hurt a human.  This whole thing was giving him flashbacks of that time Cas had started using phrases like ‘kill myself.’  He was so glad Cas had asked for help at all.  The realization that he could have arrived back from a hunt to find a dead angel was upsetting, but not surprising.  Cas had a tendency to feel like he was “bothering” him or Sam when he asked for help.
Cas issued the order in a fucked out voice. He pulled the blankets up to their chins and kissed Dean’s forehead.  Dean shook his head.  He wasn’t done.  Dean sleepily crawled under the blankets and licked the cum from Cas’s cock, his thighs, his balls, his belly...  He liked having Cas’s cock in his mouth.  It was soft and small, but nice.  He could hear Cas making little noises up there. Good.  Dean crawled back up to his pillow only to have Cas kiss him with a very wet mouth.  He tasted like slick and their come and sex and Cas.  Dean licked Cas’s chin clean before he sighed and pulled him close.  He wanted to be held.  It was fine, as long as they didn’t call it cuddling.
The nephilim was righteous and offended. The feeling was so fierce it made Castiel’s being throb harder.  He laid there in the hay.  He wished Dean and Sam were here.  If he were to die, he wanted them to be there. He was so cold.  The darkness was opening up to swallow him.  All he could see was blackness.  Then there was nothing.
“These beings have the power to do everything that angels can do, but they feel the way humans do.  They have hormones and mood swings and tantrums like humans, but with angelic power to back their whims…”
Sam chuckled.  It was good to hear him laugh.  Cas insisted that Sam needn’t do that.  He had found his own food as a human.  Sam and Dean both shot him down.
“Cas…  I’m ticked yeah… But when I did this as a living back in the day…  Lets just say none of my clients need it as often as you do.  As soon as my knot goes down, your body starts freaking out.  I don’t want you boiling in your skin because you’re my friend and friends don’t knot each other.  I’ve had to be more than one omega’s ride to the ER. We can’t do that with you, but…  I can give you some relief...”
Dean was a sexual giver.  He enjoyed pleasing others, but right now, all he wanted was Cas’s cock in his mouth.
Dean made a sweet rumble in his chest and made Castiel into his mattress. Castiel pulled the blankets over him and ran gentle hands over his back.  Dean really was beautiful when he slept.  He slept so little.  Castiel wanted to savor this.  Maybe, if he was lucky, Dean would let Castiel touch him in his sleep again.  Maybe someday they would touch each other again.  They would kiss and hold each other.  Maybe Dean would let him put his penis in his mouth. Castiel was allowed to think about it.  He didn’t think it likely, however.
“Cas, Dean, he’s going to need a knot to help him through his first heat.  Unless you want me to drive forty five minutes to the nearest store, we don’t have any knots just lying around.”
Cas finally came, his muscles clenched deliciously and Dean groaned.  Cas whispered a stream of praise filled with “yes” and “Dean.”  His come painted Cas’s chest, neck and even his face.  Dean failed to stop himself from licking the come away from Cas’s cheek.  It was bitter, but it hit the spot.  Dean found himself humming and licking Cas clean of his own come.  It was like he couldn’t help it.  When Dean caught himself, he blushed furiously and hid his face in Cas’s shoulder.  He could hear Cas laughing.  It was a nice laugh.  Dean could feel it in his knot. That felt awesome. Cas was laughing at him though.  He was ashamed.
“After I kicked you out.  If you want to stay Cas, you'll stay until you’re better! Stay longer if you want. No going hungry for you!”
Jack nodded.  They held the jacket tight around themselves, as if for warmth or comfort.   Jack’s eyes were on their feet.  Their toes wiggled.
Castiel stated in a flat, even voice.  Dean and Sam were only able to lead Cas out into the war room before the discomfort became too much for him and he refused to move.
“Do you think we need to go all the way for the magic to work? Or will a little frotting be enough?”
Dean inhaled, Cas’s scent centered his racing mind.  Cas’s toes were rubbing along the tops of his.  It was actually really sweet.
He pressed his own, weakening grace to the creature’s grace.  It wound itself around his own and squeezed like a snake.  It felt kind of good.
Dean didn’t think before he spoke. His voice broke.  He sounded so needy and broken.  It was disgusting.
“Okay.  I’m gonna make an executive decision and say I’m topping.  You're hurting.  Just lie there and tell me if anything feels off to you.”
Cas gazed upon him with such fondness, that he had to look away.  Dean was such a coward.  He thought that maybe he had grown a pair.  Dean thought maybe he would be able to say it.  Someone had best repo his balls.  He didn’t deserve them.
Cas took the hint and crawled up Dean’s back, toward his face.  Cas stopped now and then to give Dean’s neck some attention, or nibble his ear.  His cock pressed cheerfully against the cleft of Dean’s ass  Dean was achingly hard, but Cas seemed to be only semi hard.  His body temperature didn’t burn like it had before.  Cas covered him with his own body, pressing him down into the mattress as he sucked at Dean’s scent gland.  Dean thought, again, of how nice it would be to have Cas fuck him just like this.  Cas pulled back from his neck with shiny eyes.  With one hand, he rolled Dean onto his back.  Dean yelped, causing his face and neck to burn with embarrassment.  Then Cas was kissing him, hard, on the mouth, so that was okay.  The kiss stole his breath.  It was messy and unpracticed.  Cas’s mouth tasted like his own ass.  He hadn’t thought that that would be a turn on for him.  As it turned out, it was.  Dean clung to Cas’s shoulders, licking the taste of himself out of Cas’s mouth until it was gone.  Cas nipped at his lips, growling.  Cas’s heat still hadn’t flared back up.
Castiel told Dean that he needed to be mated.  Dean was his mate.  His body needed Dean to completely mate him. Dean had not finished the job yet.
“They wanted to meet you.  I told them about you…  That we share a special connection…  I told them to trust Dean and Sam.”
“I performed the first part of the ritual on Dean’s soul.  It was a bonding ritual, meant for angels.  His soul was far too injured to be inside his body.  I had to use a strand of my grace to hold him together.”
Emerging from this state was like coming back to life.  It was sharp, cold, and disorienting. His shoulders burned where Dean clutched him.  Dean was there. Tremors rolled through his frame.  He still had his face pressed into Castiel’s neck.  His eyes were wet.  Castiel could feel the heat in his own hands.  The hand he had not used to contact Dean’s soul had burned Dean’s skin.
Castiel smiled at Dean from where he knelt, fetching Dean some water.  Dean laid on his stomach, naked as a newborn.  His head was pillowed on his arms.
“Lucifer could still be out there.  This sounds like something he would do.  Nephilim tend to be conceived when an angel alpha that impregnates an omega.  There have been few exceptions.”
Castiel hummed. Dean’s lips were pillowy and plush.  Castiel enjoyed learning the cellular structure of Dean’s mouth.  Tasting him down to the molecules. Communicating without words that Castiel loved him.
Cas pressed Dean’s hand to the top of his bump.  Dean’s stomach did a flip flop.  That was their kid in there.  Weird. He felt a faint flutter under Cas’s skin. Then he saw a gray sky, Lucifer, a rift in the air.  A rip in this world.  Dean pulled his hand away.
Dean couldn’t seem to look at Jack.  He busied himself with something else.  Sam was on his own on this one.  Jack looked very solemn for someone who had just been born.
The first time Cas had ever lied to Dean.  It had spiraled out of control.  Dean had felt so sick about it because Sam and Bobby could see through it.  Why couldn’t Dean.  Then they had caught him and he had looked so small.
Even though the two of them were tied together, this felt weirdly intimate.  He hesitated for a moment.  Cas huffed and grabbed his hand.
“No offence Sunshine but isn’t kind of a crazy coincidence that we just had unprotected heat sex and now there's a half angel half human that just poofed into being somewhere?”
It felt odd to be rocked.  Dean had not really been rocked since his mother was alive.  Here he was, a grown ass man, allowing Cas to hold him and sway back and forth.  He was so proud that Cas liked his scent.  It made him feel like a good Alpha.  Like he was taking care of Cas.  Cas was getting what he needed.  Cas felt good, he told Dean to bite harder.
Dean kept his face in Cas’s shoulder.  Cas just sighed.  He reached up and stroked the top of Dean’s head. His touch was so tender that it ached.
Dean’s voice sounded like an alpha growl in his own ears.  It was doing it for Cas, who sighed and pushed back against his hand. Cas nodded quickly.  Dean could see the strain and knew that three just wasn’t cutting it any more.  Cas hadn’t asked for anything up until now.  It was so like cas to take what he was given and ask for so little.  Cas made a little sound, which he tried to muffle.  It was an unhappy mule that didn’t fool Dean.
Castiel threw his arms around Dean without hesitation.  He squeezed him, wanting to make sure that he was real.
Cas explained with an unnerving calm that only made sense if you knew him.  Dean rubbed his head in a restless way.
Cas’s eyes had faded back to blue.  The weird feelings were gone.  What was left was the weight of Cas in his lap.
Cas sagged.  He looked much sadder than he had when Dean had been holding him.  Dean wanted to hold him now.  He wanted to smooth out the frown and taste his dry lips until he smiled.  Cas had the cutest smiles.  They were all gummy and they made the fine lines around his eyes show.
One second, Castiel was standing in the cold with his pants and belt undone as he bled from the womb. The next second, Dean was screaming and there was a startling, stinging pain in his back. Then he was nothing.
Dean tried to explain that if Cas didn’t let him go, he’d knot Cas’s mouth.  That was good for porn, but Dean wasn’t sure that Cas would like it.  He stopped trying to try to talk when Cas found his prostate.  Dean bent forward and moaned helplessly, fisting a hand in Cas’s hair.  Cas hummed around his Cock and proceeded to rub against it over and over.  Dean stopped thinking.  His hips thrust helplessly. Cas’s mouth was so good and wet and warm.  Then, his knot popped behind his lips, behind his teeth.  He was cumming, hard down Cas’s throat.  Dean couldn’t help but stare down at Cas as he swallowed over and over.  The feeling pulled more helpless whimpers from Dean and more spurts of cum. Cas just blinked up at him.  Dean’s thighs trembled and he finally had to sit.  Cas’s lips were stretched wide around his knot.  The teeth kind of hurt, but not enough to cause Dean to want to risk injury by pulling out.  It was just the right kind of pain.  He was safe inside Cas.  Cas sucked a little, pulling one last drop of cum from Dean.  Dean’s breath caught for a moment.  He really did feel nice and snug and safe inside of Cas like this.  He let his gaze drift down to Cas’s face.  His eyes were half lidded and his mouth was swollen red.  Dean allowed one of his hands to pet and stroke his sex mussed hair.  This almost felt more intimate than a regular knotting.  One of Cas’s hands stroked up Dean’s lower back, down his backside and rubbed  into his thigh.  He let it rest at the back of Dean’s thigh, rubbing soothing circles into the skin with his thumb. Cas pulled his finger free of Dean’s ass, causing Dean to twitch in surprise.  He had almost forgotten that Cas was still inside of him like that.  The scent of Cas’s slick and cum was thick and fresh as it trickled out of him.  Cas just wrapped that arm around Dean’s middle so that his wet hand clasped his hip.  This was nice.  Their post orgasm scents mingled pleasantly in the air.  Cas smelled happy down there.  Dean could feel gentle puffs of air from his nose against his belly as Cas relaxed.  Dean knew he was staring down at Cas.  He knew that he was grinning like an idiot.  He just sat up there, playing with Cas’s hair and letting the feeling of his mouth and throat fill his senses.
The two of them just kind of stood out in the hall, looking at each other.  It felt natural, and super weird.
Castiel hummed.  He gently pulled his own boxers down to his thighs.  Then, Castiel ran his hands down Dean’s back and pulled his underwear down off of his backside.  Castiel moved slowly, not wanting to disturb Dean’s rest.  He was having such a good dream.  It would be a shame to cut it short.  Dean sighed happily at the feeling of skin on skin.  Castiel felt his cock react to that sound immediately.  Cas grabbed hold of Dean’s backside.
Cas raised  his head so that he could look at Dean.  His eyes were so shiny and wet.  They swam, as if Cas may cry.
Apparently, Crowley had broken the Lance of Michael.  The Winchesters understood that it was he who saved Castiel.  Cas intended to set that straight. He didn’t get much of a chance. Dean practically pounced on him when they got to the bunker.  His mouth was insistent and hungry.  He acted as if he may die if Castiel did not kiss him right this second.  Castiel was happy to let Dean nip, kiss, and lick into his mouth as much as he needed.
Dean just kind of shrugged and bit into his own burger.  Jack watched Dean carefully.  Castiel had always said that Dean was a perfect example of what it meant to be human.  Dean was their father after all.  They should learn from him.  Dean took a bite of burger, Jack did the same.  Dean twisted his beer open, Jack twisted one open too.
His hole was suddenly filled with Cas’s stiff tongue.  It pushed in and stayed there for a moment.  Cas’s breath was hot against his entrance.  Cas pulled almost all the way out and then pushed his tongue in again. Cas was fucking him, but with his mouth… His strong, wet mouth... It was hot as hell...Fuck yes…
Dean barked out a laugh.  He held Cas around the chest, squeezing him so hard that it would have hurt a human. He could imagine Cas smirking and wished, for a moment, that he could see his face, kiss his mouth, lick all that cooling cum up off of his body.  Dean cleared his throat.
First, there was the memory of the old Cas, pre-rebelion days. They had sat next to each other in a children’s park
“Sam, Isn’t it true that human male omegas sometimes try to get pregnant for years?  Isn’t it the case that some try repeatedly, but never end up carrying to term?  It would be so unfair if I were to get pregnant on the first try, wouldn't it?”
Dean smelled like happy alpha.  Castiel smelled them together.  It smelled right.  Like they were mating.  Dean stroked Castiel’s wet cock, surprising him.  It was so much better with that mating smell in the air…  That mix of pleased Dean, Alpha orgasm, omega heat and bonding. hormones.  It was too much.  Dean whimpered and pressed his mouth to Castiel’s gland.  He licked and suckled behind his ear and moaned into the muscle of Castiel’s neck.  Dean was lost in his own instinct.  Castiel listened to him purr when he found a suitable spot. Dean sank his teeth into Cas’s neck as he came again.  Castiel came again, massaging more cum from Dean.   Dean lapped at the bite with a flat tongue.  It was too much. They were mated.  Finally.
He watched Cas genuinely enjoy his food.  Cas moaned happily around the ground meat and gave Dean those big smiling baby blues with his mouth all full.  Dean picked at his own, despite his hunger.  Finally, he stopped trying, resting his head on his hand and watching Cas enjoy the molecular structure of cooked egg and beef.  He had a bit of egg and cheese stuck in the hairs below his lower lip.
Castiel went to what the Winchesters called ‘Cas’s room,’ to spend time with the stranger to whom he was playing host.
Dean watched Cas’s abdominal muscles flex and his calves bunch up.  The tug at his knot was maddening, but it told him that Cas was trying to push up into his hand.
Dean had very mixed feelings about Cas having any kind of reproductive... anything.  He had liked Cas in a special way for a long time.  Still, Dean had believed that, if Cas would be anything, it would be a Beta or even an Alpha like Sam and himself. Angel Cas was a Steryl Unpresented.  All of the angels he ran into seemed to be Sterile Unpresented.  Something about Cas still did it for him.  Dean tried and failed not to think of how good looking he was.  How nice he smelled.  Cas smelled like the woods after a light rain when everything was waking up and there isn’t a wendigo after you.  Cas smelled like coffee too.  There was something else in there.  Dean didn’t think about it much.  He just kind of figured it was an angel smell.  It was close to how star jasmine smells, but that wasn’t right. That smell had become spicier in the moments Dean got back to the bunker.  Cas had looked so dreamy with his sex hair, big pupils, and flushed cheeks that Dean had really wanted to nip his neck.  Not a mating bite or anything.  He had just really wanted to taste his skin.  Dean really did not want to have to think about the way Cas would taste right now.  He was pumping out all of those pheromones designed to get an alpha excited.  The smell alone had tested Dean’s will a little.  He wasn’t an asshole.  He could control himself.  It was Cas.  Cas smelled good to Dean every day.  Right now, Dean kept having to look at and smell Sam to make his chubby go down.  His dick did not like Sam.
He waited at the door and let Cas in.  If he squinted, and looked at Cas really hard, he could see where their kid was growing, stretching Cas out like he had swallowed a melon.  It made Dean’s cheeks all hot and he rubbed his neck.
Once the three of them arrived back at the bunker, Sam showed Jack Cas’s old room.  Jack stared around with an understanding that was alien to Sam.
“Everything you are angry at yourself for, everything you have ever felt guilty about, I have already forgiven.”
Dean did as he was told and sighed  as the pressure on his cock eased somewhat.  When he looked up, Cas was in his space, squinting at him.  Cas tore his shirt open, effectively ruining it.  Dean’s breath caught in his chest.  Cas was so hot.  Dean allowed his hands to wander over his chest and belly.  He liked the feel of the stretched skin.  He’d put a baby in there without even trying.  Dean was awesome.
A strong energy shot through his grace.  It was pure power.  He was so weak.  Castiel closed his eyes.
“Angels don’t think of gender the same way you do Dean.  I know our child’s sex, but they have not presented a gender as of yet.  I doubt they will for some time yet.”
“And I told them that humans did not like it when we went through their memories.  They may have thought sending a vision was something different.  I will explain.”
It was very difficult to concentrate on words when he was aching inside.  He also had an erection that was impossible to ignore.  It was straining against his trousers, intent on capturing his attention.
Was really all Dean could manage to say.  Cas looked like he could use a mug of something warm, some comfort food, and a hug, or something.  His urge to nurture was threatening to get the better of him.  Sam cleared his throat loudly.
That was how the three of them picked Jack’s name.  Sam even chimed in later, telling them that it was some people’s nickname for John, which made it a family name.  Jack seemed interested in the concept of a ‘family name.’  Castiel was always answering questions.  Jack was a bright inquisitive child.  He was starting to get impatient for the brothers to formally meet them.
Cas nodded.  His stubble was rough against the skin of Dean’s chest.  Cas was going to give him a friction burn.
This whole time, Dean had been feeling a steady tug inside.  It was the way he often felt when he was around Cas.  He could explain it much better now, after the ritual.  His soul yearned for closeness.  He wanted to touch Cas’s grace.  He wanted the tendrils of light to caress him.  He wanted to embrace it and engulf it before letting it free.  He would have to wait.  Dean applied more lube, watching the minute play of muscles in Cas’s face.  Dean licked his lips.  Cas’s hands kept petting him in that way that reminded Dean of his grace.  The first press of a finger to Cas’s ass made Cas jump.
Dean shook his head.  Sam said he liked the name Elliot. Nobody liked that name, except for Sam.  Dean also like the names Kurtis, Stephen, Robert, and Sam.  Sam refused to let Dean name the child after him, even though the kid didn’t seem to mind.  Cas shot down naming his child after any rock and rollers, which made Dean pout.
“It's just a little extra food.  We can handle it. Besides, I think Dean would literally die if you starved.”
Dean’s vision blurred as his eyes filled with water.  He wished it away, but it wouldn’t leave.  His tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth. Cas sighed contentedly and pressed their cheeks together.
“After Rowena’s spell broke and you left with Sam, I had some time to think once I learned I was dying. What would I say to you?  I figured that happiness is in just saying it.  I should give you the option to say it if you return my feelings.  I knew this was unlikely, but I want you to be happy.”
“And here you are letting me use your body because you know it will ease my discomfort...  I may be able to deal with this on my own, but you’re here...   You are so good to me, and yet I failed you once again.  Dean I-”
Cas stood up and began to wash Dean’s belly.  He acted as if there was no place that he would rather be.  His eyes were naked in their longing.  Dean tried to swallow the lump in his throat.  Why was Cas talking so much?
Dean knelt there beside Cas’s body, unwilling to comprehend that time was passing.  Unwilling to acknowledge that there was a throbbing pain in his knees.  Cas looked so peaceful, like he had been sleeping. Sleeping people usually breathe...  People usually don’t look so angelic in death.  But Cas WAS an angel after all.  Other than the Small hole in his shirt and the blood stain on his lap, Cas looked like he could have sat up and given him a little ‘hello Dean.’  Dean needed to get with the program.  Cas wasn’t sleeping.  He wouldn’t sit up and he wouldn’t speak.  Cas was dead.  Dean was a bit horrified to find wandering to Cas’s unzipped fly and unbuckled belt.  He absentmindedly did them up for Cas, god knew why. His hand came away wet with fresh blood.  Cas had been bleeding.  He’d bled a lot and yet, he hadn’t stayed put.  Where was the child?  Where was Jack?  Dean tried to stand, but his knees buckled.  He had been kneeling next to Cas all night.  An unexpected rage swept through him.  Cas was a dumb son of a bitch who should have stayed put.  This would have never happened if he hadn’t gotten Cas all knocked up.  Jack had hurt Cas real bad and opened some other portal.  Lucifer wanted Jack’s power, that’s why he was here.  Dean would literally give an arm and a leg to have Cas back.  He’d rather Jack not exist at all and have Cas back.
“I hope it's alright…  That I wanted to touch you in your sleep...  It is truly something I have wanted for a long time…”
Castiel crowded right into Dean’s space.  His full bodied, pregnant scent caused Dean to blink in quick succession.
This time, Dean’s strokes were long and thorough.  He made sure that he drove in hard at the end of each thrust.  Cas made the most delicious grunting sounds when he went in deep like that.  He devoured Cas’s mouth.  Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist, and dissolved into a trembling mess as Dean squeezed and jerked his Cock to the rhythm of his hips. Dean, so overcome with the intensity of the lovemaking, locked his jaw around Cas’s neck before he could stop himself.  Cas tilted his head back.
Cas had begun to shift distractedly. Dean could now see his flushed cock and began to salivate.  He’d always had a bit of a thing for omega cocks.  Cas’s was bigger than average and it was rosie with blood.  He really wanted to find out what it tasted like.  Cas was his friend.  Cas was his friend and he deserved better.  Cas deserved a compassionate alpha who would suck his cock and then take him slow, preferably with Cas on top so as not to hurt him.  Dean loved that image.  Cas’s chest and cheeks all flushed as he slowly slid down a nice big cock.  Dean was betting he purred.  He bet Cas made lots of happy throat noises while he took what he wanted. Dean caught himself in the middle of his fantasy and mentaly slapped himself. He tore his eyes away from Cas, even though he looked delicious.  Dean was disgusted by his own smell.  He smelled all hot and worked up.  Cas gazed at him with glassy eyes.  Dean tried again.
Finally, Cas dissolved into helpless, happy little sounds.  He pressed his firm body close to Dean.  Dean grabbed for the other washcloth.  Clearly Cas was in the mood for grooming.  Dean could get on board with that. He took his time.  He shampooed Cas’s hair, even though Cas made a weak attempt at telling him that Dean needn’t do that.  Cas could use his powers.  Dean sudsed him up all over and rinsed him down. He checked Cas’s hole out of old habit.  His finger pushed in and felt for damage. He leaned in close.  It wasn’t sore looking any more and it was so tight.  Cas hissed a little.
Dean cooked them all a large meal of hamburger steak and eggs with shredded potatoes.  The eggs were supposedly out of date, but they hadn’t gone bad yet.  The hashbrowns and meat had been in the freezer.  Cas stood, leaning against the counter, watching him silently.  The smell of Cas, newly mated, mixed with the breakfast food made his mouth water.  Dean dished out three heaping portions, despite Cas’s insistence that he did not need to eat.  Dean raised his eyebrows at him.
Cas pushed back.  He seemed eager and had finally found his voice.  Dean was also speaking, but he wasn’t really paying any attention to it.  It was just a bunch of praise mixed in with some dirty talk.  He didn’t even remember doing it later.
“Actually Cas, We’re ma-mated now.  If you have another heat or…  um…  just want to do that again sometime…  There would be…”
Dean rolled his hips forward one more time, and his knot popped inside.  Dean purred and his teeth sank down into the back of Cas’s neck.  Cas’s body clamped down on the knot, milking it, but it did not give him any cum.  Dean’s teeth grounded him.  He was still so feverish.  Dean continued to purr, which soothed Castiel’s aching mind a little.  He wished that Dean would never pull away.  When he did, he smelled worried.
Dean followed him up the stairs.  Castiel stocked down to where Sam and Dean were hunching over computer screens.  He thought that they may have a problem.  It was a bigger problem than a simple hole in the world.  He had told Dean, moments before Sam arrived in the kitchen, that something was wrong outside.  He felt a profound disturbance in his grace. Castiel was certain that others would be able to feel it too.  Other angels, maybe even Lucifer.
you?” Cas says, and he sounds bewildered. It makes Dean feel really embarrassed. But then something dark crosses Cas’s face, and Dean feels like an idiot.
“I was thinking it would make a hand job easier, if that's what you wanted, or I could give you another blow job,” Cas says, "Or we could do something else if you're comfortable," and wow even the words make Dean feel enthralled when they come out of
“Dean, let me go,” Castiel says, and he tries to turn to face Dean, who looks as much himself as ever, just a little confused. Castiel notices his fist is bloody, and Cas goes to heal it instinctually, but the handcuff stops him, and he gives out a groan in pain. He does manage to lie on his side, facing Dean, slack gone in the handcuffs and balancing his back against the wall.
“What year did you die, then?” she asks. “How are you even still alive? I’ve been there for....” there’s a faraway look in her eyes. “I’m a demon,” she says, like she’s just realising. You’re not very convinced of that, considering the fact she’s in her body and not possessing anyone, but you guess you can test with holy water. You check your jacket, but it seems that it was all evaporating in the fire.
You work cases together. You get used to the fact he’s trying to replace the hole of Sam’s absence with you, and you get used to the feeling of oxygen and pressure calibration that seems to need to be redone by being around him. You’re obsessed with the way he smiles around you, the way he laughs with you, pats your shoulder and seems
“Maybe later,” he says. You nod, a little uncertain on his plan, but then he’s kissing you again, and you honestly do not care.
wrong for me not to want to repeat that?” he says. Cas is so riled up, Dean’s certain he’s stunned himself into revelation, but the words don’t compute. All he can think is,
He wonders if this will have meaning to Dean. If it will bring him peace, control, acceptance. Cas feels so utterly twisted between the conflicting desires of actually wanting to die for Dean and have it mean something, like it could have, if he had just
“Well, the real Cas could never want you,” the demon says. If you wanted pitiful torture like this, you’d just listen to your internal monologue on earth.
You have already seen the end of the world. But you just let it burn. And burn it did. The oceans became poisonous to all their inhabitants, the volcanic activity skyrocketed. Gondwana and Laurasia danced their last given melody, while living creatures suffered and died. But it was part of God’s will. After all, how else was the diictodon going to evolve and dominate the world as their dicynodonts, the Lystrosaurus of the early Triassic and into the primitive mammals of the later epochs? How would the diversity of life on earth be possible to create humans, as they are, therefore vessels, with the complexity to comprehend and give consent to play out God’s prophecies? You’ve seen great extinctions. You’ve seen asteroids switch the roles of power dominating the environment, watch it down the line, dinosaurs to giant terrifying birds to the great array of birds alive today, so many of which humans now eat.
what is going to happen. That’s why he feels it, feels the threat of the weather, and hunger, why he feels terrified of violating Dean with every touch like he did April Kelly. The empty is using this, to hurt him. To give him a mirage of everything he wants and twist it into something horrible. To then torture him with Dean’s face.
“You almost killed me,” Dean says, and he sounds betrayed, heartbroken, like he cannot believe that that could ever happen.
“Sorry, that was rough, but personal space, and, well, I don’t really like you,” Cas says. You stand a few feet back, gutted, for a minute. Things seem somewhat nightmarish. Cas hasn’t ever said something like that before. He’s never. Not like that. You’re frozen, too hurt to rejoice that he’s here. Too confused to say anything at all until it turns to anger.
“Wow, uh, Cas. Your mouth could give a guy ideas,” Dean says. He’s not looking at you anymore. You wonder if he is referring to blowjobs. It makes you feel brittle somehow, like you’re coming back to yourself, and it’s rigged with vulnerability.
He definitely doesn’t expect Dean to just be sitting there, at the kitchen table, at 5:34 am, with a hollow look on his face.
“You did good,” Dean says, and Cas sobs at it, black sparkles dizzying around the room. “You think you can keep going, even if I don’t tell you to?” Dean asks, and he grasps Cas’s hand and puts the whip back into it.
“It was the night before we confronted Raphael. I think you only did it because you expected me to die,” you say, trying to keep your voice a steady monotone.
But the way he smiles and laughs makes everything feel like grand design in it’s own manner. He makes it make sense. Life is about the living, and that is precious. It is about his happiness. You want to make him happy.
“That doesn’t explain anything,” Cas says. It’s not until now that Dean looks at Cas and sees him for what he is: vulnerable. This isn’t going to go anywhere if Dean doesn’t pick apart his own fucking carcass.
It fills him with such despair, and he feels desperate. He can’t stop Cas from breaking up with him. He knows that. But there wasn’t any sudden change, right? And Cas seemed more than happy with him just earlier that day. So maybe he could have one kiss, one goodbye kiss. Surely that would seem logical. He could ask, in any case, and Cas could decline him, and Dean could deal with whatever psychological repercussions that could bring. It’s not like it could bring some sort of consequence greater than this.
“You didn’t want me in your home. I left your home. I went to a place where I am paying money and seem to not be likely to have to leave on short notice. You followed me here. I don’t see how any of that is you doing something wrong.” Dean feels almost winded from a punch in the gut, but Cas seems unaffected by the weight of his words and goes to put the snacks into the cupboards.
It's a bleary night, and Dean’s pulled over to the side of the road in some part of rural America. The moon dimly hits his face.
He reaches for his grace, but it feels smothered, and dazzling panic bursts in his chest. What is happening to him now? When will his actions be his own? When will he be able to perceive what’s going on?
“I am sorry I cannot heal right now,” you say, and maybe the genuine dismay in your tone is that obvious because when Dean looks at you next, his expression softens. He sits on the bed, glancing between you and the hole in the wall.
“Cas!” Dean exclaims, and you feel him stroke your arm, and it almost feels like some sort of relief to the pain.
“It’s the same,” Dean says. “Hey, can you give me a minute. My clothes kind of stink of ash,” you say. It’s not entirely true. “And you know Bela’s stealing our silverware.”
me? You run away again and again, and it ends with you beating me near to death. Then what do you do? Run away again! Do you think you washed your hands clean?” Cas can’t help but shake his head, even as Dean reaches over him and cuts against the bottom of each of Cas’s palms. Castiel feels the dripping blood from them. “Do you even
“Oh, uh,” he mumbles. “Either, either’s, good.” That’s about when Cas lathers his hands in lube and wraps his hot fingers around Dean’s cock. After fucking around teasing Cas all this time, it isn’t that long before he comes, the time elastic and blissful between, jutting out into over-sensitivity a few times pulsating into pleasure, and even if that happens a few too many times, Dean’s having the time of his life.
“Want to, want to make you feel good, Cas,” he says sincerely, and when you don’t make any objections, his mouth slides back over your cock, and you lose any semblance of coherence once again, moaning out. Dean seems to take this as encouragement, and swallows more of your cock down. The only thought great enough to keep you from fucking into his face, losing yourself completely, is your fear of hurting him, your knowledge of the human gag reflex, so you go motionless, let him do what he plans to do, but you’re so undone, you’re do undone,
,” Cas says, and he sounds rather desperate, more emotive than Dean’s even used to, and he grabs Dean’s shoulder. He drops his hand immediately though, but Dean turns around anyway, feeling uniquely absent.
Cas does move at that, and rather aggressively, but instead, he reaches towards the bed and grabs his keys, pressing a button that closes the garage door behind Dean. Dean watches it, enamoured by the mechanism for some reason, even as it leaves them in a semi-darkness. And when Cas does come at him, he thinks Cas might actually be about to hit him.
He wakes slowly, and when he does, you let yourself stroke your hands through his hair, admiring how he leans into the touch, before he opens his eyes, looks at you, and pulls away so fast it almost seems violent.
“Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” Dean says. Cas is stunned for a moment, knowing he needs to be quick to react, before it hits him that Dean probably wants him to set his hand in the cuff. For some reason, he can’t do it, sticks shock still, immobilised. The room turns to a halt. He remembers the pain, the fear, the helplessness, his memories giving rise to the last twenty-four hours and flashes of memories he’d rather not observe. He knows he’s not supposed to like this, like being hurt, like whatever Dean’s about to do to him. And he still wants it, he does. But for some reason, he’s having trouble reconciling the prior with the latter and his actual genuine choice. “God, can you not pick up on anything? Put your friggin’ hand in the cuff, I’m not doing shit until I know your mojo’s snuffed.”
“God, Cas, you suck cock like a whore,” he says, and it almost makes you pause, but the terror of screwing up drags you on. You don’t know why it sits so twisted in your stomach while also igniting your arousal even more. When he comes, the bitter taste seems acrider, and you’re left feeling dirtier than before.
“Cas, Cas, this is so, so good,” Dean’s muttering out, much more vocal than you, hands in your hair, moving, so so gentle, and you swallow him down more, moaning as you feel his cock sliding in and out of your mouth. It’s vaguely uncomfortable (though maybe you’re pushing yourself too fast) which somehow makes it hotter for you. You’re surprised at your reaction given you just came and you know male humans have a refractory period, but you suppose you don’t have to be getting off to find something so erotic and pleasurable. Granted, it’s probably Dean’s encouragement that gets to you the most. He keeps going on, repeating how good it is, your name, and as you go on, he starts taking your father’s name in vain too. Towards the end, he’s just pleading,
But he doesn’t want to be bad at this. He knows he is inexperienced, but he’s researched it quite a lot. He wants to come off self-assured. He reaches his hands down Dean’s body, tries to undo his jeans, until Dean’s pulls away, his hands over Cas’s, and Cas feels deranged and desperate. He wants to give Dean what he wants. He’s terrified this isn’t Dean. He’s confused.
“Dean, is this what you desire?” the demon Cas asks, before running his hands from your shoulders past your chest down to your hips. “Is this why you came to hell? To finally feel me touch you?”
“Cas, hold on, slow down,” Dean says. “Your hands are shaking,” he notes. Cas doesn’t know what to make of it. Hands can shake from desire. Is Dean reading something different off him?
. He was just thinking of how no one else could ever do this to him. It was bitter and stupid, and he can’t believe it.
“So are we, are we good? Because I got to admit, I don’t know what the hell I’m doing here,” Dean says.
He can’t make much sense of Cas, and he’s trying to not seem as affected as he is, even if the pretense is bullshit. But Dean also thinks Cas looks devastated, like it’s splayed across his face, and it makes Dean even angrier because Cas is the one doing this. Dean didn’t even go out and do something to destroy this. He simply just wasn’t enough.
. Dean locks it immediately then, tight, and Castiel is hit with a flood of sensation. Neural responses are unavoidable, all sharp and bright on a canvas of blank encumbering powerlessness. Activity he didn’t even realise he’d been monitoring goes radio silent, and all he can feel is Dean’s grip on his wrist.
He wants to chase salvation so badly he’s sick with it. He wonders what it’d be like if Dean would just stop hurting him, just for a moment, and sit close to him, hold him. Sometimes, he fantasises about this so loudly in his head that it chases away some of the pain until he realises again that Dean is looking down at him in disgust.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t expect to see you again and make you face how I felt,” Cas says. He thought the biggest hurdle would be Dean’s reaction to Cas’s attraction, and maybe if this was real it would be, but now it seems very much centred around the simple fact Cas loves him.
If he still wants you, that means that wasn’t what made him regret it. It must have been some failure on your part, or something personal about you he doesn’t want to associate sexual relations with. Which you guess makes sense: you know there are a lot of layers to human intimacy. It doesn’t stop how it makes you ache.
“You really think you’re gonna die huh? That you won’t make it outta this one?” he says. It’s interesting, how much it seems like that matters to him. It ignites you.
You sit in silence, in the front seat, wondering if you did something wrong in the way you ran your fingers through his hair. You wish you left another mark on him.
But you can’t stop his frustration, later that night, when he kicks the motel wall and leaves a hole, the noise loud in the night air. You can’t help his despair. He said he needed a couple of hours of sleep (but you’re pretty sure he’s grossly underestimating what humans need). Did he get it?
“Alright,” you say. Dean looks at you like he always does, like you’re the funniest riddle he’s ever seen. Gives you a bit of a smile, and you melt. You wonder how long it’s been like that. How many millions of years have people found cosmic significance in another creature with an expiration date of time that seems like a blink of an eye to you.
“Come at me,” you say. He pulls some holy water from his jacket, and you hold out your hand. It doesn’t burn, which you suppose is a good sign.
He doesn’t know what to say. Doesn’t know what more he can say. No wonder Cas wants to stay away from him. He doesn’t understand how last night ever happened. Maybe he’s fucking delusional. Or maybe Cas is. But Dean’s money is it being himself.
“Get out. Now, Cas,” he says, rather tersely, grabbing a flannel from the front seat and putting it on. You do as he says, fumbling at the car door. When you stumble outside, you notice your pants are still undone, and so are all of the buttons on your shirt. Dean groans and throws your trench coat after you, and you wrap it around yourself, disoriented in the morning light and the concrete parking lot ground. It’s a very deserted area, and no one is up yet. Everything feels eerie and quiet, like a storm coming. And for some reason, it’s not Raphael and your soon demise that has your chest beating bright with panic.
from me,” Dean demands, and Castiel wrenches his entire body around gaining him another foot of distance from Dean, panting in the exertion and agony.
But then you feel pressure from someone’s hand on your shoulder, and you open your eyes to make out his face, and for a moment, everything isn’t so horrible. But your system is still in recovery, and a wave of sharp pain comes from nowhere, and you find yourself curling in on yourself in the dirt.
“Fuck, we’re going to need lube,” he says. He opens up the glove compartment, checks under the car seats as if he’s remembered it as some necessity. “Just found a condom, but I’m guessing we both know each other’s history already for that,” he says.
him. He has to have something wrong. He can’t think because of the way Dean’s lips on his make everything focused solely on them, on the way they feel, the sound in the room of them together, but his thoughts still race somewhere underneath, fears about the vague concept of the weather outside, the room Dean’s offering him, the sandwich, the fact Dean would never want him as himself, the fact Cas has to have this twisted, and it turns the sensations into something overwhelming in a way that makes him feel sick.
“Of course,” Cas says, and Dean lets out an audible sigh at that. “You’re always welcome with me.” Cas turns away then and pulls out a key on a chain with a number (4), and unlocks a compartment on the wall next to the garage door. He then presses a button and the garage door goes up, revealing an unmade twin-sized bed in a large room with several windows at the back as well as several cabinets with haphazard snacks on the counters below them, such as an opened bag of cheetos. Cas walks in, kicking the pair of pants he had been wearing last night under the bed, and throwing his jacket and keys on the mattress.
