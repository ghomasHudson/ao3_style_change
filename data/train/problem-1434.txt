“She said that you had parted on good terms but that she saw it coming a mile away and is “glad it’s over with”.”
“Alright, I’ll mention it to her and see what happens.”
John didn’t quite know how to respond to that so he just nodded, not quite fully meeting her eye.
Once on the ice Molly started to move forward and immediately fell “I haven’t been skating in years, so I’ll probably take a minute or two to get back into it.”
“I’ve already got your number and you have mine too.”
The dinner had gone well despite the tension surrounding Doctor Watsons wife Q thought as he entered his childhood bedroom with 007 tailing close behind him. His room looked as it always had a soft, cosy green; every inch of the walls covered in dark wood bookshelf and
"Was it a silly thing we did once because it was 3 am in the morning and nobody is sane at that time or was it a start of us dating and being romantically involved." John scratched the back of his head.
"Eat your food Sherlock." John replied used to Sherlock by now.
Sherlock followed a bit behind John and Bond as they walked towards the dining room.
“I must admit that I’m surprised Q,” 007 said setting down his overnight bag next to the cot.
"That's horrible! Then did it happened?"
"Well he has been busy. With his workplace blowing up, his promotion and everything," she tried to smoothen over with a wave of her hand.
"It is possible that he is involved in the murder or knows something we don't and we have to match the name "Mikel Smith" or possibly "Micke Smith" with a Facebook profile with the knowledge we have about him." John groaned he didn't even want to imagine how many "Mikel Smith" or "Micke Smith" there was in London let alone Facebook. He rose up and headed for the kitchen.
That was all I had at the moment but more will come. A big thanks to my beta and amazing friend AlexBSChris she is on here and as soon as I figure out how I will do a link to her. I also exist on tumblr and run the little teahouse as Mandy-Hope-san if you wanna find me. While I been posting this I saw this work had got 14 hits and that makes me superexited. Please let me know that you think. Mandy out. The song mention here is from the TV-show Ally McBeal, called Hooked on a feeling an do not belong to me.
"You were embarrassed back then" a deep voice spoke directly in his ear with just a hint of worry. John suppressed a shudder of pleasure but hurried up to reassure his boyfriend.
"Are you close to Mr Johannesson?"
"I was a bit surprised how Doctor Watson handled 007. Is he always like that?" Q spoke up.
"Anyway," Q continued as if Bond hadn't spoken at all.
"Yes, congratulation on becoming an uncle Q. I sure you will do wonderful, you have had a lot of practise minding Alec here," 007 chimed in avoiding the punch from 006.
~ SH ~
"Of course I can, a normal one but we train our agent not too and unfortunately for this situation 006 and 007 is the best. I would want to seriously injure them," Q snorted.
"I'm starting on breakfast now. Are you coming?" he said as he swung his leg over Sherlock's hips and slid of bed. On his way out he nicked one of the detective's all dressing gowns (the blue one). Behind him he heard Sherlock's answer.
"John, Sherlock so wonderful that you could make it," she greeted them.
"Beside how bad can it be?" 006 added. Q stared at him like he had grown a second head.
“You don’t get to complain your spoiled bastard. You are an uninvited guest after all,” Q said without looking up.
I'm no expert in crime solving, everything is made up. Give a round of applauses for AlexBSChris that is my wonderful Beta.
"Then you are delusional too Em. John is simply my friend and I'm worrying about him wearing himself down”, Sherlock huffed.
"No" he answered.
That night Sherlock danced for John. He put all his feeling into the well-practiced movement and kept his eyes locked on his doctor. The world slimmed down to just the two of them. Sherlock built a new room in the John wing there he stored how Johns expression depending on which movement he made. It was glorious. About 3 am when he got off the stage his co-workers couldn't hold their question anymore.
"I just had a flashback of getting caught red handed by my grandma"
“If you wanted me to strip for you, you just had to ask Q,” 007 purred.
"Mhm and what do you propose we do with that time?" John smiled down on him. Oh this was going to be a delightful morning.
"She made a mess, didn't she?" he asked then his mind coughed up with the rest of the world.
“You seem to know Doctor Watson quite well,” Q comment as he accessed the latest report from R&D.
"And still are. I tried to get them all home for the weekend but Myc had something important to take of in Ukraine. At least you get to meet little Em at last."
"Let me take care of her a bit and go have a nice nap," she suggested as she sat down next to John on the sofa and reached her arms out for the sleeping little girl.
"We slept in again."
"It is a small sharp object. Probably some kind of knife, but not a normal pocketknife." He rattled off.
As soon as Sherlock entered the crime scene facts started flowing to him. One pair of heavy footprint in the carpet leading to the body - the killer had carried the victim here. Slightly deeper footprint on the left foot - victim had been carried over the killers left shoulder (right handed killer? Sometimes right handed people preferred to carry things with their left arms - not enough information). A second pair of smaller footprint also led up to the body but from another entrance (size looked about Donovan's so that information was irrelevant). The body was clearly posed as a nice little lady: legs crossed, hands fold in lap, dress arranged to look as good as possible, she even had a bit of stage make-up applied - killer had an obsession or was into some form of art (theatre, movies, artists, photographs his brain helpfully supplied.). The body was dressed after the time of death and boar no sign of struggle - victim knew the killer or was unprepared. No scratch, her peaceful face indicated that she had been asleep then she died and the death had been instant (small reliefs) - something had been injected in her? Possibly poison? No obvious signs of poisoning needed to see injection wound or analyse blood staple to be sure. If wound existed it was probably covered by the dress.
"The victim is female and showed up in a seat sometimes between closing and opening without triggering the alarm, dressed like the female lead in Titanic. No obvious course of death and no clues about her killer."
Sherlock showed no mercy as he dropped the next bomb on John.
"No, I have a dead body in a bloody cinema and have been trying to reach you all morning" Lestrade answered tension obvious.
"No, not at all. She is the most tolerant of my relatives. Both Harry and I have lived periods at her place when our parents threw fits over our sexualities." The answer seamed to please Sherlock and he squeezed John's hand.
The game was on.
Sherlock had known that John was following him the moment he stepped out of the door. But he had to give his dear doctor some credit, he had been discreet about it. When Sherlock had left he had sat in his chair with a new cuppa and a novel looking like he had no intention to leave at all. The giveaway had been earlier then Sherlock prepared himself. John always at least raised an eyebrow at the ruckus he made, but today it had been nothing. At first the detective wrote it of as John still being angry with him. That had made him uneasy, he didn't like it when John was angry with him. John was one of those things in the world that just shouldn't be angry, sad or distressed it was just wrong and then the whole world was wrong until the matter had been restored. John seemed to think that Sherlock did everything to piss him of but that really wasn't the case rather the opposite and he couldn't understand why John.... Bam! At this point Sherlock smacked the door shut in his mind palace. Going down that corridor only led to pain, not doing that now thank you very much. The dead giveaway had been that John didn't look up when he left anyway. John ALWAYS look up when he left. He had since the study in pink, Sherlock secretly liked the name it was dramatic, he thought it had something to do with last time John didn't check he had run off with a serial killer. His doctor was overprotective sometimes. He didn't mind that though or the tailing. It was exciting that John was tailing HIM for a change. He was quit skilful really, Sherlock would make sure to compliment him for that later. John said it was nice to compliment people, it was only too bad for him that Sherlock had memorized the sound of his footsteps and could always notice him then he wanted. He had a whole wing set aside for John in his mindpalace slowly filling it up with every little detail that made John his John. He spend the rest of the walk to "Mercus" in the John wing sorting through his expressions trying to deduct which one he would wear then he saw Sherlock today. Oh it was so exciting. Quietly slipping through the staff door, Sherlock quickly headed towards his dressing room. In his head he was already sorting through the big Victorian closet in his mindpalace working out which outfit would be best for today. Purple he thought, John had always paid extra attention to his purple shirt, and black lace too. A smirk spreading on his face he opened the door and spared no time starting to undress as soon as it closed again. From his bag he gathered today's outfit: black fishnet socking, a pair of black mini shorts that hugged his arse closely, a tank top of fine black lace and as top of the crown a purple corset with black ribbons. This particular corset was one of his favourites and it had been customised for him. Sherlock shivered a bit of excitement for his John to see him in it as he laced it on. He then sat down for some quick make up. Mascara, black eyeliner, a hint of purple eye shadow and bright red lipstick quickly went on with precise and practiced movements. After a second of thoughts he added some colour to highlight his cheekbones. Today was special nobody could blame him for putting in some extra efforts. Lastly he picked a pair of rich purple jazz heals and bent down to lace them one. Just as he finished the manger knocked on the door.
And the next morning when he was on the plane home, he cried; for himself and for what their friendship would become.
“Because I didn’t know you felt that way about me until someone mentioned it to me the other day. And after that, I didn’t know how to act or what to do because I’m absolutely awful with things like this. Let me say this though, what I said before about enjoying your company and wanting to do something like this again, I meant it. I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings because that was not my intention.”
“Well, I’d better get studying” she pointed over her shoulder with her deep purple mittens.
Molly chuckled, “Yeah you’ve got it bad, love.”
Mary smiled as she started to sit down and said, “Sounds good.”
“Oh. Um. I’m sorry John but I have a really big test the next day so I’ll probably be having a date with my textbook.”
John wakes up in a daze. As he stretches he realizes that the other side of the bed is empty. It hasn’t been empty in little under a year, since he and Sherlock had gotten together. It was after the whole Mary fiasco played out and John learned the truth; that Sherlock had flat lined that fateful day when he was shot. He hadn’t realized how symbolic that all was of how they were both feeling.
Sherlock nodded; yawning before muttering: "Ok," and resettling comfortably against John.
Have some water nearby so you can help all the sugar go down.
After ten minutes of walking, they finally reached Mary’s destination; the library. Mary turned to John and said “Thanks for walking me, John.”
Sherlock looked into John’s eyes, hoping to convey what he wanted with a look, but he still got a perplexed look, so Sherlock did the only thing left. He lifted his right hand and cupped John’s face and lifted his left hand and put it on John’s back. John sighed and his eyes closed as he leaned into the caress and Sherlock leaned in until he was an inch away from John’s face, but before he could hesitate, John closed the gap as the breeze swirled around them bringing the scent of lilacs to their noses.
Moving his lips from his own, John pressed a kiss to the hollow of his throat; before licking a trail to his Adam's apple. He smiled against Sherlock’s skin, and allowed his fingers to slowly scratch down his chest while he circled his tongue under the prudence in his throat. John’s head was thrown back, and his hands were tightening against his back; his moans vibrating against his nose.
Victor gently slide over on the bench and put his arms around Sherlock.
“Because I kind of feel that way too and, no one and I mean no one has ever said something like that to me. I’ve never had something like this.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
She just chuckled in reply and said “Thanks. Now I’m really cold and I’m already starting to feel my bruises start to form, so can we maybe head back to the dorms or somewhere warm?”
“Gladly. I just want to head back to my room to drop my things off before we go, you’re welcome to come with me if you’d like.”
“That I did. I would never just leave without saying goodbye to you. I’m not going to see you for 9 months, you idiot.”
“No. It’ll be fine Sherlock and then afterwards we could bake cookies and make hot chocolate.”
John his face red from the cold replied, “Yeah, it should be a good time. We’re just about to start, as soon as some of the other members show up from the other team.”
“John, I’m afraid I really have to go do homework now. I really enjoyed this and maybe we can do it again sometime?”
“So Sherlock, how are all of your other classes coming along?”
On his last day in Rome, John is heading to the Trevi Fountain with one of his roommates. They finished their packed itinerary yesterday and have the morning to themselves before they have to head back to Florence. The entire trip to Rome was incredible. They of course went to all of the typical places like the Roman Forum, Capitoline Hill, the Colosseum and the Vatican, but they also got to go to other places like the Villa Farnese on the other side of the river, and the Borghese Gallery.
Enjoy!
The kiss started out hesitant and unsure, but soon became tender and sure. Slowly, John pulled away, eyes fluttering open and lips parted slightly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Alright, but hey, I have some news and it’s not something you’re going to want to hear but you need to hear it from someone.”
John was in pure heaven when Sherlock called his name and proceeded to give him what he wanted; turning him and connecting their lips the second before Sherlock screamed into his mouth, and their bodies shattered together. John felt Sherlock’s heated juices shoot forcefully onto his belly.
Hope you enjoy!
Ludovico Einaudi is an incredible musician and if you have a chance I highly recommend listening to his work. I could also make a playlist and put it on 8tracks if people are interested.
He drug his nails up the muscles in his legs, and brushed his fingers over the tent in his boxers; gasping when he kissed Sherlock harder, and bucked into his hands.
Being without John was insufferable. Sherlock couldn’t stand it. He missed their long chats and their walks and going to events together. He was abroad and Sherlock was back at school stuck in the tedium of classes while John was off on an adventure. Yes, they were both going to be in Greece after Christmas, but then again, he still had to live without his company for four and a half months.
______________________________________________________________________________
Sherlock startled slightly and glanced over at John, “Yes. It was fine. How about your exams? Latin and immunology?”
After the ceremony of course there were pictures, food and mingling. John talked with a few of the professors for a little while and some of his other Classics friends until he saw someone he’d been wanting to talk to for quite some time standing in the corner trying to blend in and failing miserably. Sherlock was dressed in his usual attire of dress clothes. Today he was wearing a black suit with a purple and gold stripped tie for the occasion and he looked stunning.
“I’ve been good. Just about to head to dinner.”
Normally, John would take his time and meander paths and explore but, today, he made straight for the pond at the very top of the stairs and sat on the bench setting his journal down on his left and took a deep breath. As he took in the grey sky and watched the rain hit the water making it ripple, he trapped himself in his mind and thought. John sat forward putting his head in his hands and let out a sigh. Then glancing up, towards the fountain, he saw two ducks gliding gracefully across the water.
“Oh hi Irene. Sherlock and I just made some cookies, we’re waiting for them to cool if you’d like to stay and have one.”
As December rolls around and with it finals and Christmas break, Sherlock is ecstatic with his new “relationship” with Victor. Not much has changed, they still go to dinner regularly, they still go to practice rooms and play pieces for each other. The only thing that’s new is that they hold hands and on occasion cuddle.
Sherlock just nodded his head and they entered the classroom putting their bags against the wall before heading over to stretch before class began.
“Mary, wait. Uh…I had a really good time too and I was wondering, what are you doing on Valentine’s Day?” he held his breath as he waited for an answer and she replied
Over the next few days, John analyzed everything that had happened. He was hurt by the rejection but still put on a happy face regardless.
So Sherlock melted the butter and carefully melted the chocolate with it over a pot of boiling water. In the meantime, Molly took care of beating the eggs, vanilla and espresso powder and sugar together. When it came time for the combination of the two as well as the folding in of the flour, baking powder and salt, Sherlock took care of that while Molly combined the chocolate chips, peanut butter chips and nuts with the remaining flower before Sherlock folded that into the mixture. Finally, it was time to put them on the sheets and bake them.
“Sherlock? Is everything ok? You never call.”
“Me too. Do you want to eat with me?”
Next he thought of Sherlock and decided he deserved one of his wishes.
Sherlock replied, “Yes they’re ridiculously sensitive and I never had the patience to bring myself to try.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“That’s not normally what people say.”
While they waited for them to cool, there was a bit of an awkward silence between the two friends. Just before Molly was going to speak, one of her friends, Sherlock believed her name was Irene, came into the kitchen.
“Do you remember, earlier at dinner when I mentioned that I liked someone, romantically I mean?”
“None. I’ll get the rest of your things.”
John just finished his last final yesterday and was finally getting a night to relax before all the graduation events began. It was Tuesday evening and as he sat back in his chair, he couldn’t help but think about Sherlock. He’d been harboring his feelings for him for quite awhile and figured that tomorrow on their walk around campus, that he would finally tell him.
“Absolutely. Have a good night, John” she said and turned to head into the library.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Beautiful place. Is the course for language, history or archeology?”
Sherlock felt all the breath leave his body. John fancied someone, someone who probably wasn’t him and he couldn’t look at John anymore, couldn’t reveal his feelings anymore, “Oh. I see. Anyone I know?”
“No, I’m not” he sheepishly replied.
“Ah I see, it’s a semi-forced kind of love”
He stood up and extended his hand to her and she grasped his hand while she ungracefully stood up. She kept his hand in hers for longer than was necessary but realizing that quickly let his hand go turning a shade of red that was not from the cold as she embarked out on the ice. After a moment, Sherlock followed.
“Brilliant, Sherlock. We should definitely collaborate sometime, that would be so much fun”
“Well it was good meeting you John. Have a good night.”
He chuckled and sarcastically replied, “Exhausted, but what else is new. How about you?” “Oh you know, busy with projects and papers; the usual college student life.”She nodded enthusiastically, eyebrows raised.
When they arrived at his dorm, Sherlock said “Thank you for walking me back. I enjoy having company when I go out from time to time.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Over the next month John and Mary’s dinners became more and more frequent and sometimes even turned into weekly brunches. And over that period, John found himself becoming more and more besotted with her After Christmas break, term started up again and things had resumed like before.
I'm also on tumblr: divine529
“Then she mentioned how she’s going abroad next term and said that she’s excited because all the foreign boys would be all over her. Well after that I changed the subject because I didn’t want to hear about it anymore. I can’t help but wonder if she mentioned all of this to me because she forgot we’re mates or if she deliberately did it to hurt you. Either way looks like you dodged a bullet with that one!”
Come early March, the Classics Society inductions rolled around and while John was already a member, he enjoyed going to the events.
Sherlock couldn’t breathe. His eyes widened and he took in a shaky breath, “What?”
Then after that John said “It sounds like you’re having a really busy semester. Now tell me more about Molly.”
Before he threw them in though, he carefully thought about what he wanted to wish for. Ultimately he decided on three things:
They met in the dining hall as usual and grabbed a two person table. Once they were seated, comfortable and had started their dinners, John started talking.
“There are so many to choose from. But probably Archangel”
After several weeks of casually bumping into each other, and casual chatting in the halls, Sherlock and Victor started becoming friends. It took for some awkward talks with Irene in the halls to reassure Sherlock that this was a good thing. That John would be glad he’d made a new friend.
During all of this Sherlock couldn’t help but shed tears, no one had ever said anything like that to him.
“What are you studying?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Soon after, John got a text from an unknown number “
She averted her eyes and pursed her lips and Sherlock thought she looked like she was thinking hard about something “I’d like to do this again sometime.”
He prepared himself for bed and had a fitful night of sleep.
Two: I wish Sherlock to be happy always, no matter what happens between us
“I’ll miss you Sherlock. I promise to skype and there’s always email.”
“You were the mystery text. I should’ve known by the initials.”
“I’m alright. How are you?”
“You mentioned that you’re a chemistry major right? Do you know my mate, Mike Stamford?”
“Absolutely.”
She shook her head, “No. I’ve just been wondering about that for a while.”
Sherlock furrowed his brow slightly, “What is it, John?”
Sherlock smiled up at him, and continued running his fingers along the buttons of his dress shirt to quell the nervous feeling he felt deep in his belly. "Yes," he answered on a whisper. "I am absolutely sure. Am I insecure because I've never been in a relationship like this before? Of course, but I trust you…with my mind…with my body…with my heart…"
John sat in his chair aching, just thinking about a little Sherlock all alone except his lovely dog and Sherlock had never told him any of this. Before John could say so, Ms. Hudson continued:
“I’m taking ballet, obviously, Ovid my advanced Latin course of the semester, analytical chemistry, violin, and an archaeology course which is mostly for fun, but also in preparation for my study abroad this January.”
“John if you would say your vows please”
He let out a breath “Oh. Ok. Maybe some other time. Good luck studying then.” And then he went up and hugged her.
“I’ll see you in 9 months.”
Just an epilogue left!
After that happened, he realized he knew what he always wanted and that was Sherlock. They had been there for each other through thick and thin and he realized he’d never had someone like that before, even in Mary. Shortly after that realization, he moved back into Baker Street and slowly started to patch up the mess he’d made of things with Sherlock.
“Like who?”
“Today is an anniversary of sorts for Sherlock, not a very good one mind you but it is one nonetheless. You may or may not know this but when Sherlock was a child, he had a lovely dog named Redbeard. He was an Irish Setter and Sherlock’s first and only true friend.”

Irene looked at Sherlock at that point “You’re Sherlock, aren’t you?”
John’s heart sunk at those words. Mary had known about his feelings all those months and had just strung him out. Mike wasn’t finished however and continued.
He stared blankly at her for a moment, “Ok. And what do you want?”
“Well we’ll each have something to look forward to then. The ice skating for me and the baking party for you.”
Sherlock’s arms wrapped tight around his neck, and his hand settled in his hair to encourage the soft kisses he was littering across his clavicle. He slid one of his hands down to his sides; whimpering and crying out at the sheer pleasure of his mouth on Sherlock’s neck and small breasts." Keep going John," he managed to whisper into his ear. "I don't think I can last much longer."
“Oh good you’re back.”
“What happened Sherlock?”
Slowly, people started to trickle into the theater and soon enough the lights were dimming and the concert starting.
Mike grunted in response and then his face brightened with a Cheshire grin.
Molly bit her lip to conceal a smile and looked at him batting her eyelashes “Please Sherlock” He sighed and conceded that yes he would go ice skating tomorrow not knowing just what he’d gotten himself into.
Sherlock nodded and found himself smiling more. He hadn’t connected with someone like this since John. By the end of the night, he had Victor’s phone number and a link to his youtube channel and a promise for more hangouts. He walked back to his apartment with a small smile on his face.
Once Victor stopped playing he turned to Sherlock with a hopeful look, “What did you think?”
New fic coming soon...
Well here goes nothing, he thought “I just wanted to let you know that I really like you and I was wondering if you’d like to go on a date sometime.” He let out a large gust of air that he didn’t know he was holding and waited anxiously for her reply.
He picked up his notebook, untied the leather straps and flipped to a blank page and began to write:
“You also seem to have a love for classics if you’re here.”
He could not do that. Every time he saw Victor now, he had Jim attached at his hip. They never acknowledged each other. It was so painful.
Mary huffed a laugh and ultimately replied “Sure, but it’s going to be a bit of a walk.”
Looks like Sherlock's finally figuring his life out!
“We should all get together sometime and hang out.”
The tender run of John’s hand brought a moan louder than the one Sherlock exclaimed before, and he couldn't help put press a loving kiss against his heart, before he retraced his trail and reached the already shimmering curls of dark brown hair.
“Sorry about him.” She said, “he’s always in a hurry”
And then pocketed his mobile as he ascended the winding staircases to the topmost floor of the building, found his professor’s post box and then began his trek across the grounds to find Sherlock.
The night carried on in much of the same manner and once it was over, there were promises of more.
Slowly John worked his way back up to Sherlock’s chest and his hard nipples. Sherlock shivered and whimpered softly. John did as he had before, and stepped back to get a better view of Sherlock; his nervousness giving his heart yet another scared flutter as he looked over Sherlock’s beautiful form.
Sherlock glanced over at John again, “John.”
“Shit!”
Not far from the tree where John’s snowflake was resting another snowflake was falling. This snowflake was just as beautiful as John’s. It also had six points and fernlike dendrites but once you reached its center, an intricate floral pattern that started with twelve points on the middle ring joined together with another six points creates another pattern of diamonds between them and at the very center of the complex snowflake are three hexagon shapes within each other and three pointed clovers between the first two finally ending in a hexagon shaped star.
He can do this.
John squeezes his hand “I understand Sherlock and I am so sorry. Know that I will be here with you for as long as you allow it.” Sherlock nods his head and clasps his hand with John’s intertwining their fingers.
Visibly startled that she was caught she stammered “Wh-what?”
It was just then that she realized that Sherlock was having no trouble at all “Wait, Sherlock. You’re having no trouble at all!”
John looks at Sherlock with tears in his eyes and says “Sherlock we’ve been through a lot, good and bad, separately and together and I can honestly say that you’re not only my best friend, but someone who I’ll cherish for the rest of my days and beyond. I promise to take care of you and love you and rely on you as my equal. I love you, Sherlock, now and for always.” And with that, John slips a beautiful platinum band with swirls surrounding the ring onto his long, slender finger.
She smirked and tilted her head, “So, what’s on your mind?”
A few weeks later, Sherlock and Victor ran into each other again but this time decided to grab dinner. They spent several hours together at the little bistro down the road from school talking and laughing and eventually Victor invited Sherlock to go to a practice room in the music building.
“Sherlock. Look at me please.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock swallowed, sighed and glanced briefly at Molly before replying “Not currently, no.”
The room they entered had wooden paneling and red carpeting, wooden chairs and tables that looked to be made of mahogany and pictures of significant people who went to their school. Once all the inductees were seated, the ceremony began and it being top secret, there’s not much that can be said. However, it involved a lot of Latin, Greek and signing of books.
John chuckled at the impatient tone of the text and replied
And the last he made for himself.
“Oh. That’s fine. It’s all fine.” He replied looking dejected and just so he could make things less awkward, he quickly changed the subject.
Sherlock didn’t respond but he was definitely looking forward to seeing John again so he nodded slightly.
He arrived at the desk “Hi, do you have any cooking ware I could use?”
This chapter was particularly difficult for me to write, not only because of everything I wanted to include but also because what Sherlock went through is something I've experienced as well and I just needed to write it and get it out there.
Find me on tumblr: divine529
Molly said they were making cookies but based on the picture she’d attached to the recipe, it looked more like a brownie cookie. Looking at the ingredients, Sherlock went over to the cabinet to see what was provided, while Molly had run back to her room to grab the rest.
“Yes sir. John Watson” he said as he straitened his back and held out his hand.
“Have you ever been kissed?”
“Hello Molly. What do you want?” Sherlock said exasperated.
Come November, many concerts came up and being music students, there are so many concerts you are required to go to. Not surprisingly, Sherlock hadn’t gone to any. When Victor learned of this, he dragged him along whenever he went, which was often. The first concert they went to was the school philharmonia. Sherlock thoroughly enjoyed that one and looked forward to going to more. The next one was one of the madrigal choirs; neither Sherlock nor Victor loved that one, but they kind of suspected going in. Third was Baroque night which Sherlock knew John would’ve loved had he been there and finally, the Orchestra home concert. They had just gotten back from tour.
“Sure, that would be nice.”
Now that John got a glimpse of the Trevi Fountain, he wanted to study it as a student of art. However, the crowd surrounding it had other ideas. So, he just pushed his way up to the fountain’s edge carefully surveying his surroundings and took out a few coins.
Later that day, after hardly thinking about anything else, Sherlock resorted to research online and including taking quiz after quiz titled “What is your sexuality” or something to that effect.
“What do people normally say?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John set down his fork and crossed his arms on the ledge of the table while leaning in and replied “Um, well, in my free time I like to read and write mostly but I also love to travel.”
“Wow, that was fantastic! Mostly right on all counts.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For now, he just needed to get through finals. He could do that.
“Oh good John you’re here. The officers have done much of the room setup but we need someone outside. Would you mind helping out with keeping the inductees out of the room?”
“Goodnight Mary.”
Clearing his throat he replied “No.”
“Well someday I hope to be a doctor, but the history is mostly for fun.”
"Mmhmm," Sherlock grumbled, his eyes closed, and his face completely calm. "Very tired…"
John makes the short journey down to Ms. Hudson’s flat and knocks on her door. She opens it and says “Oh John, I wondered when you’d be stopping by” and John walks in and sits down at her small wooden table and looks at her “Do you know where Sherlock is? He almost never leaves the flat without telling me where he’s going, at least not in the past 7 months or so.”
They stay there in that spot, looking at that statue and holding each other for the rest of the day; full of emotion but glad to be in the safety of each other’s arms.
Later that night, Sherlock checked his email and saw that he had a message from John. With a grin on his face, he opened it and read what it said.
Sherlock was surprised “But she’s never said anything and I’m not interested in her that way. How do you suggest I go about telling her that? I really enjoy her company.”
Glancing at the recipe to see what they needed, Sherlock went over to the cabinet first and found the sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt. And then he went to the fridge, and found the butter and eggs. When Molly returned, her arms were overflowing with ingredients.
“Can I walk with you to wherever you’re going?”
Once they were both calmed down a little more, John said, “Sherlock, that was some of the best sex I’ve had in I don’t know how long and it was even better because it was with you.”
“Wow. That’s absolutely incredible”
When he finishes eating and cleaning up, and he still hasn’t heard from Sherlock, he decides to make a visit to Ms. Hudson and see if she knows where Sherlock’s got off to.
After his conversation with John the other night he had a feeling he knew where this was going “I did too Molly.”
Sorry this took so long to get out, life's been chaotic.
And he grabbed his mobile and shot off a text to Molly:
“Excellent. Any particular artists you enjoy?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John nodded, numb, thanked Mike for letting him know all of that and then changed directions to go to his room instead of the science building.
“As I said before, just take it a day at a time, you never know what’ll happen”.
They started walking back to the dorms, both pensive and when they arrived they just stood around, John looking at the ground shuffling his left foot back and forth and Mary masking a smile while sticking her hands in her pocket and looking at the door.
Sherlock felt like he’d been hit by a bus. “It’s second semester of senior year. There is no way I’m doing anything about this.”
As the snow falls, the hidden sun casts its light on a particular snowflake. It has fernlike dendrites and a diamond looking center with a hexagon snowflake at its center. As we look closer we see a young man walking across a school campus and now our adventure truly begins.
“I’m taking ballet, of course, astronomy, organ lessons, calculus and German”
After a minute, John broke the silence with a slight cough, “How did your Latin exam go? Well I hope?”
Sherlock adored the orchestra here. He would never want to be in it himself because sometimes listening is better. Letting the music surround you and wrap you up in its tendrils. Sherlock’s favorite piece of the night was called Turtledove. The strings section was superb in that piece and Sherlock, though he would never admit it, shed a tear.
As we leave that particular time in John’s life, we see his snowflake floating around caught in a breeze carrying it toward a tree to rest in for the time being.
"....or longer. John seems all worn out. Being on the countryside would maybe let him rest a bit and it would be good for Amalia to have some fresh air too."
"Does he..." Sherlock began.
"You are a doctor." And they were back to this again. Deciding to test if Sherlock remembered John choose his next words carefully.
"Still need to read people every day and I have bad days" Involuntary the detective's hand flinched up and touched the place there John's punch had landed months ago.
"Food is unnecessary" came the reply spoken in a deep voice still covered in sleep. Another shiver went down John's spine but he didn't give in.
"That's not true and you know it" John replied
"Happened after the murder.... Someone was in the hurry..... Not planned.... No sign of breaking in..... The bugler had a key..... John go check with the landlady who has the key to this flat! Friends, family, boyfriend, girlfriend, anyone" Being far too used to his flatmate’s (boyfriend, partner or whatever they there now) ways he didn't even bother to reply as he turned around and walked out of the flat knowing that Sherlock had dismissed him in his mind. He went down the stairs knocking on the door labelled 127A (the victim lived in C). The landlady opened at once.
"You might want to take a moment to straighten up a bit seeing that we will arrive back at 221 B in five minutes" he said close to John's ear. A wonderful shiver went throw John's body but then he replied it was with a glint in the eye.
"It was that flat mate of yours, wasn't it?" she asked as she moved towards the stage again.
"However it may be you should take John and Amalia and come stay with us over the weekend. Your father would like to meet his granddaughter....."
"Oh" Sherlock’s eyes went wide. That made sense. The rest of the walk home passed in silence, except for John's giggles (but them Sherlock didn't mind, he quit like the sound in fact), and Sherlock rearranged in his John-wing to fit around this new important piece of information.
"No he is securing the scene" John said as he followed Kalyani inside and sat down on the sofa.
Sherlock was awoken by John's not so kindly elbow in his ribs. After a millisecond to replay yesterday’s events, he wrapped himself firmer around the warm form pressed against his torso. Inhaling the doctor’s familiar scent he pressed his face to the point where shoulder met neck, as he had wanted to do so many times before. Testing how sensitive John was at this particular spot he started to drop small kisses on the skin before him. The experiment had a very satisfying outcome. A shiver went through John's body and Sherlock decided that this had to happen more often. Dully he noticed that John was talking to him, had been for some time, but it had only been a soothing sound that washed over him. Now he focused on it and was able to catch the last of the sentence
"Sherlock, hold the baby." John said handing over Amalia and marched forward and started to poke at the shoulder and making James move his arm around.
"Really Sherlock there is no reason to get jealous of that kid. It isn't like you never use a bit of charm to get what you want."
"Scones?" He asked taking out the small bread. It smelled amazing. Sherlock hummed buttering one up, took a small bite and let out a groan of pleasure.
"Nononono," Q mumbled beginning tapping furiously on his keyboard not aware how much he alarmed the minions closest by and the two double ohs in the room.
John talks to the landlady.
Snogging and Sherlock trying to gather facts.
At least he knew for sure that Sherlock was awake now, his pale blue eyes observing every move John made. John did the only thing that made sense at the moment, he leaned down and kissed the man bellow him. The kiss was slow and sweet just as all their other kisses and Sherlock was eager to respond, he loosened his grip around John and leaned up. After a couple of minutes of lazy snogging John pulled back, let his legs slide to the sides of Sherlock's leg and pushed himself up. This time the detective didn't try to stop him, he just let his hands slide down until they rested on his hips.
"Very well then take me home. I for one would fancy some sleep".
"Your runaway wife is a known assassin, she was on our radar until a couple of years ago then she dropped off after a deal with an Irish mob boss had gone wrong." The whole room grew deadly quiet after the news, nobody seemed to know how to act. John gave him a curt nod in acknowledgement, all emotion hidden under a face Sherlock only seen him pull up in really serious situation to keep calm. - It was disturbing. John was not supposed to look like that, not anymore. They were here for a relaxing weekend so he could rest. Damn Mary for ruining it all again.- He was just about to deliver his own kick under the table as the door opened and his father entered. His father, as always, looked a bit like a Hobbit – yes he had read the Lord of the Rings and not deleted it, the books was fascinating and the movies was good as well – his red locks sticking up in an untameable mess with some twigs in it an dressed in a bright coloured waistcoat over a lose linen shirt and a pair of pant with small stain from the garden, his face lit up in a big smile then he saw his sons.
"YES!" both Q and John cut him off.
I'm sorry for the long wait on the update. It have been a hellish month for both me and my beta, final exams in everything. I had 12 exams, papers, presentations and such. You might have notice that I set a numbers of chapters now and that's because I have finished it and you will get all chapters today. Big thanks to my lovely beta AlexBSChris. More notes at the end of this story. Enjoy.
"With the kissing and sleeping in the same bed thing" he tried again.
“Bed or cot, think carefully of how you reply 007,” Q said keeping a straight face. He was still a bit alarmed by one of his agent stripping in his mother’s living room (not that he hadn’t appreciated the sight. 007 was very well-built but in this context it was just wrong).
"Cows."
His inner ramblings was interrupted by John when he got out of the car and tried to gather the bags at the same time as he balanced Amalia on one arm.
"But it is comfy here" came the reply direct into his ear.
“Fair enough, still is there any chance I can convince you to share that nice bed of yours? I promise to behave,” 007 smiled charmingly. Q:s first thought was to answer with a frim “nope” but he was still curios about 007 connection to Doctor Watson so if he just played along a bit…
"Good night John" Sherlock whispered near said man’s ear. His low baritone voice made a shiver go throw the smaller man and he replied.
"He was Em long before he was Q," Sherlock said the 'you imbecile' was quiet but well understood. Thankfully a forth voice interfered before a fight could start.
And now we will find out how it will end.
"Before, then we lived together you took care of me. And I let you. Now could you let me take care of you and Amalia?" Sherlock's words stunned John and all he could manage was a slow nod.
"That sounds nice. Let me change into my pajamas and I will meet you here in 15 min. Guess you want to take a shower after today's work" Sherlock nodded, released his hold on John and started to move away. He got maybe a couple of steps before he stopped, tuned and in two long strides was standing right before John again. He bent down and placed a kiss on John's lips.
"You get plus point for asking mate! And it is they." John nodded as a doctor he had learned that queer people are more common than people think and it can be really sensitive.
Sherlock walked quietly up the stairs to 221B. He didn't hear any sounds from the flat so he hoped John had been able to take a nap. The doctor have been looking more and more worn for each day that past the last week, damn it, John moving back here was supposed to make it easier for him but he stubbornly refused all help. Sherlock quietly opened the door to the living room walking as softly as he could.
"The practice area is that way. Go and pretend you are a blogger covering the end of term project and ask around" John squeezed Sherlock's hand briefly as acknowledge before he slipped away. As he opened the door to the practice area he was overwhelmed by chaos. The room was stuffed with people doing all kinds of things. Some was sitting on the floor sketching on what seemed like different boat things, some was standing in their underwear's getting their measurement taken, some was reading their script, some was reading their script against each other, the dear doctor had no idea there to start. Finely he picked a young (boy? girl? something else? hard to tell) student who didn't seem too busy.
"No, you don't understand," Q protested.
"Anything more? You have to tell me everything."
"But I thought you wanted the tasty bits." He smiled innocently.
"Where is she by the way?"
"So" he said putting down his toast.
"Couple of days ago. At first I fought 'Ness had borrowed it for the movie convent she went to, but then I texted her about it yesterday she said she didn't have it. She had to work at the cinema yesterday but said she would come in first thing today." Oh so the victim had been working at the cinema possibly.
~ SH ~
"…in all this."
So what do you guys think? Do I still got it? I already started the next chapter so hopefully i will be up soon. Comments are more than welcomed!
"Yes, he is hard to ignore when he gets determined," Sherlock replied his mouth slightly tilting upwards as he studied John from the back. - It was fascinating really John always had at least half his focus on Amalia, shifting his grip so he held her firmly, bouncing her a bit so she wouldn't be bored, making sure that the bee didn't fall and all this while holding up a conversation with Bond. He seemed happy, probably because he had a similar minded friend to catch up with. -
“That’s right. How’s John doing? He’s abroad this term right?”
“We’ll make it work.”
Ever since that case though, Sherlock had been treating him differently; he’s been extremely flirty and touchy. John doesn’t know what prompted the change but he found himself liking it more and more. Shortly after that, John asked Sherlock to dinner and that night they kissed for the first time, in Regents Park under a lamp post. They’ve been together ever since.
He switched to attend to Sherlock’s neglected breast, but brought the treated one into his fingers as he rolled and squeezed the mound of flesh. He felt Sherlock’s nails dig into his shoulders, and he felt the pressure of his hands; following his lead and trailing feather light kisses down Sherlock’s belly, making him writhe and his member harden and leak even more.
He finally decided that he is going to tell John how he feels, and he knows that if he tells someone else that he’ll actually go through with it. Sherlock just decided that instead of feeling like he’s going to die every time he’s in John’s presence that he’d just tell him, because if he doesn’t do it now, he knows he’ll never get the chance. He would rather know he tried than have the regret of never saying anything at all.
John left his flat in a hurry; journal in hand, wallet in pocket, he stormed past the gelaterias and restaurants. He wandered among the cobblestone streets and by the medieval buildings of Florence and upon reaching the Duomo paused, closed his eyes briefly and took a breath of air, inhaling the tantalizing scents of the eateries around him and upon opening his eyes took the path towards Santa Maria Novella and towards the bridge that led him across the Arno.
“Oh good, that saves me a bit of explanation, but anyway since you know what that means, I figure I should say something else because” John paused and looked at the woodchipped ground “I fancy someone.”
He didn’t want to have that kind of a regret and as nervous as he was, it was something he had to do.
John looked into his eyes and could see the playfulness in them so he gently bent his head and captured his lips with his before slowly trailing down his neck with his tongue until he finally got to his chest. John’s eyes shot up to Sherlock’s own to find that his eyes were closed, and he smiled before he passed the flat of his tongue over one of his rosy, pebbled nipples; closing his lips fully around the small bead and sucking softly in time with the erratic moans that poured from deep in Sherlock's chest. “Your nipples are incredibly sensitive, Sherlock.” John panted “Can you just come from nipple stimulation alone?”
“Well today is the anniversary of his death; August 27. Sherlock created a memorial for him in one of his favorite places and he usually spends all day there when he goes. Even though it’s been years it still affects him so much. I’m so glad he has you now John. How you’ve been with him all these years and even now is the happiest I’ve seen him in a very long time.”
This will probably be the last chapter for awhile since I'm starting summer classes for law school.
Einaudi came out and his entire string orchestra as well as percussionists and they began to play.
“Come on Sherlock, I really want to play you the new piece I’ve been working on”
Once Sherlock had gotten his violin from his music locker, they meandered around looking for an open practice room in the section of the building where the organs are. Finally they found one; the room was covered in wooden panels (including the floor), a bench and a music stand in the corner.
John moved his hands to his hips and pressed Sherlock backwards; backing him until he hit the arm of his couch. John pressed Sherlock to sit, and kissed his lips softly, before backing away with a tempest smile.
Too emotional to speak, Sherlock just shook his head yes.
Shortly after the introductions class began. Being third years, they needed to start preparing for their solo recitals and so much of the class was dedicated to the professor explaining what each person’s piece needed to include.
“I don’t believe you for one second, John Watson!”
John had just finished a day of shopping and last minute packing and he was eating dinner before he went to the Einaudi concert. He returned back to England tomorrow and this was the best gift to himself as a las hurrah.
Sherlock just glared at him until Mycroft turned to him and said “Are you ready to go brother mine?”

Sherlock doesn’t need to hear anymore before he runs out of the building, tears streaming down his face as he pulls out his phone and frantically searches his contacts for the one he wants.
Grumbling and muttering could be heard on the other side of the door and not a minute later, it opened a fraction to allow her inside.
He put his pen down and closed his journal making sure to tie the leather strands together and he realized he felt a little bit better. Being in this beautiful country and sitting surrounded by greenery and gorgeous sculptures definitely helped, but putting his thoughts on paper helped his brain calm down, at least a little. He sat there for a few more minutes taking in the beauty of the ever changing garden and then he gathered up his things and walked home feeling a bit lighter than he did before.
John walked up to him and since he didn’t want to be seen as a creep introduced himself “Hello Sherlock, I’m-.”
“Long story short, I was sitting in the dining hall the other day, alone and Mary came up to me and we got talking and she mentioned something about you.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“That’s quite an interesting combination. What do you want to do with that?”
Molly took one look at him and ran over and embraced him in the biggest hug.
“John!” Mike shouted and John could tell he was getting closer so he braced himself.
Sherlock thought about how truly awful this class was and flashed back to a conversation he and John had in the spring where he suggested that Sherlock branch out and meet new people while he was gone. He stopped briefly and with a small smile replied “Yes. That would be fine.”
Molly swallowed and could see that she was trying hard to fight back tears “I really enjoy your company as well and I’m sorry if I’ve made this uncomfortable.”
The weeks continued to fly by and before he knew it, finals week was here. As Sherlock studied for his Latin final, he thought back to a conversation he had with Molly the other day.
Both Sherlock and John decided to write their own vows based off the journey that had taken to get to that point.
John laughed and reached out for Sherlock again, “I’m so glad I found you.”
Just then a sleek black car pulled up and what was John assumed Sherlock’s brother Mycroft got out. Sherlock pulled away from John as Mycroft walked up to them.
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile, “Alright, let me just grab my violin so you can hear me as well.”
“Victor cheated on me. After everything he said to me, he cheated with some guy named Jim”
“John! Wait up!”
John lowered himself to his forearms, and rested his forehead against his clavicle as he allowed his animal instinct take over him. His hips pistoned into his, and he panted heavily against Sherlock’s sweaty skin.
“We had a class together last term Mike, we’re friends.” He huffed and hoped he sounded convincing
The girl at the front desk sighed, got the key to the closet and motioned for him to follow her. She opened the closet and looking inside he saw two large pots, some plastic bowls, measuring cups, a pan or two and a mix-master along with some other random odds and ends. He grabbed the pot, a few bowls and the mix-master and went back to the kitchen.
“They’re a necessity for life and if we don’t understand them we are truly lost as a society. Also Professor Hudson is a friend the family. I’ve known her since I was quite young and I’m also an officer of Classics Society, so I had to be here.”
John never got around to having any conversations with Sherlock nor did he have any more real conversations with Mary again until the beginning of November.
He rolled his eyes in response “You get the point”
Hope you all enjoyed.
“You are definitely showing me some cool jumps and spins Mr. Holmes!”
Molly chuckled and replied “Yes, I’d like that.” And she hugged him back.
“Yes. Absolutely. I’ll leave the door cracked for you.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And so the game began, the ball flying from one end to the other. And the surprising part? Mary was an excellent broomball player. Her team scored 4 points whereas John’s only scored 3. In the last few minutes of the game, things got a little more intense.
“They’re fine. I’m really enjoying all of them this semester. How about you? What are you taking?”
“Oh!” she gasped “I’m Molly. Molly Hooper and it’s alright that you don’t remember me as that lecture room was really quite large, but we were in medieval and Renaissance Philosophy together last year.”
John turned his head to look at Sherlock, and his eyes shined with lust and love. He pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead before he leaned down to suck on his left nipple. Sherlock gasped, and moaned against John’s mouths; his voice coming out gruff and colored with awe and desire." Oh God John, that feels so good. Don’t stop!"
“No, I’m alone tonight.”
Jumping forward to present day, John finally gets out of bed and after washing up he makes his way out to the sitting area where he expects to find Sherlock but the detective is nowhere to be found. Thinking that maybe he’d gone for a walk, John puts some tea on and makes himself some breakfast. As he eats he can’t help but think what had gotten into his crazy flatmate, and decides to text him.
“Mary, send the ball over here!”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock sighed “I hope you’re right.”
“That later part sounds more fun that sliding around on potentially thin ice on razors.”
John sighed and his shoulders sagged slightly, “Fine, I may like her a little bit more that friends.”
Sherlock nodded, and they continued wandering among the wooded area until they came to an obscure vined bench that was near a small stream. Sherlock noticed that John was limping slightly due to a rugby injury he sustained several years prior and suggested they sit.
After agonizing over this for hours, he stumbled upon a website that discussed something he’d never heard of before; Romantic Spectrum. He read through that and did some extra research and came to the determination that he was homosexual demiromantic, at least for the current moment.
The cool April breeze tickled his face and he reveled in the warm sun, smiling as he walked through the canopy of trees leading him to the doors of the commons. While he ambled his way to the café and ordered his usual grilled cheese sandwich and chips, he surveyed the room and as soon as she found Molly, he walked to the table and sat down.
So with that in mind, John got settled into his chair, put on a nice movie and drifted off to sleep.
Sherlock taken aback tried to get out of answering, but ultimately said, “No, not really my area.”
“I can be. Next year I’ll be abroad for part of it.”
“I’m double in pre-med and history”
“I’m doing just fine. Hang on my order’s finished, I’ll be right back” As he walks away, Sherlock can’t help but think about how terrible this is going to be. Yes him and Victor have started talking more, but actually sitting, having warm drinks on a fall day in the local café? That seems a bit different.
“No. Absolutely not.”
It’s Sherlock’s turn to smile and clasp John’s hand in his “My dear John Watson, back when we met in that first class I knew you would impact my life, I never knew that you would impact it this much. I was going through a rough time and you seeped your way into my heart and became my conductor of light. I can’t thank you enough for that. You’ve seen me at my worst and my best and you managed to love me for me. You saved me and are to this day and for eternity, my greatest and truest friend. I love you, John, now and for always.” And Sherlock slipped and identical band to his onto John’s finger.
Sherlock was still skeptical but nodded despite his reservations. “Alright then, what are we going to do about pots and pans? There seem to be a lack of them despite the fact that we’re in a kitchen.”
John goes to Florence and Rome and has some realizations
“John Watson, second year medical student who has a deep love for history and classics, courting Mary Morstan. You’re also planning on enlisting in the army once you’re finished with university.”
“I could ask the same about you, John. What’s going on with you and Mary, hmm? He panted, still trying to catch his breath from running.
John had just left the history building and started heading towards his dorm when he saw Sherlock standing by the giant oak tree near the science building, legs crossed and looking at him with a smile. John couldn’t help but think if he was waiting for him but he grinned and walked over.
April is nearing its end and John is finally going to tell her. He is finally going to tell Mary that he likes her and he’s scared shitless.
“Not particularly, no, but what choice do I have?”
“Alright. You?”

“Sure.”
So they headed off to John’s room and after he dropped his things off, they went on their walk.
“Well, we could always go to the desk and see what they have. I don’t have any of my own here otherwise I would suggest that.”
“Sherlock, you ok?”
Sherlock put his mobile back on his desk and steepled his hands under his chin, once again in deep thought as he contemplated what to do about John; tell him or not, take the risk or keep it bottled up, stay friends or find out if there’s the potential for more. All he could do was think and hope he came to a decision before graduation rolled around in a few weeks…
This fic took quite a turn from what I was originally planning for it, but I'm ok with that as it turned into a bit of a cathartic adventure from all the craziness of my undergrad life.
They left the special events room, Sherlock grabbed his long black wool coat and blue scarf and then they trekked across campus to Sherlock’s dorm.
“Sherlock, why didn’t you tell me that you were gay?” Molly blurted out.
“Of course we’ll be in touch, you twat! Now come on, give me a hug before you leave. I don’t want us to leave upset.”
A few minutes went by and they were still in need for one more player and that player, based off the rule book, had to be female. Ultimately Mike went over to Mary and suggested that she play.
Sherlock did however, get a lovely email from John the other day telling him how excited he was about seeing him in a few weeks. Sherlock will be glad to get away from England and onto Greece with his best friend. And that is what’s really helping him get through finals.
“You fancy me.” Sherlock breathed in shock. “Yes, Sherlock, I do. Scared me a bit there.”
Sherlock checked the time on the email and checked his watch and realized that he should log on to his Skype. Once logged on, he shot John a message that he was ready to talk and waiting for the melodic sound of a call coming through.
Sherlock just smiled and walked up to the car, got in and John waved as they drove off.
"You are so beautiful," he confessed breathlessly; reaching forward to slide a single finger along the curve of Sherlock’s waist, until he allowed his hand to settle against his hip. "I love you, Sherlock, and I'm in such an awe of how someone like you could be in love with someone like me. My god, you're too good for me."
Ms. Hudson grimaces and says “Yes dear, I know where he is. I’m surprised he hasn’t told you about this himself but, given the circumstances I think you ought to know”
“Well of course she likes me, otherwise we wouldn’t be hanging out at all.”
Irene smirked “And what about a boyfriend then?”
(See the end of the chapter for
As he neared the river, he couldn’t help but stop to take in the scenery of the grey light shining on the water and revealing the mountains in the back along with the foliage; every single time he had to cross that river, the view struck him and he wished he could share it with the friends he left back home. He wished he could share it with one person in particular; Sherlock. John hadn’t seen Sherlock since the previous May and it was now early December. Only a month and half until he got to see his friends again. And while John had kept in touch with his friends, it was hard for him to not miss them and want to be part of their lives all the time. As people often say after having been abroad “you will never be completely at home again, because your heart will always be elsewhere. That is the price you pay for the richness of loving and knowing people in more than one place”. John’s life embodies that quote because, while he loves being and experiencing Florence, he misses his friends back home, but he knows that once he’s gone from Florence, he’ll want to be back here.
After he crossed the bridge, he continued on to his original destination; The Pitti Palace and ultimately his favorite place; the Boboli Gardens. Being a student, he got free access to any museum or historical site and so he got his free ticket and cut all the lines and went in. Once through the palace entrance, he continued through the courtyard to a small door on the right that led into “his” garden.
As it turns out, Mary did want to go to the game, so at 8:00 PM, she showed up at the ice rink. She spotted the team and gave a small wave and Mike waved back. He slid over to John who was wearing goalie gear and tapped him on the shoulder while pointing to where Mary was standing. John’s head swiveled around and found her standing at the edge of the rink and shuffled over to her. And just then Mary noticed that they were in their street shoes, but before she could voice her question, John spoke.
Breathing in a shaky breath against Sherlock’s lips; John rested his palms against his developed pectorals. He felt the muscles quiver under his touch, and allowed his fingers to twitch forward, so that his nails could scratch against Sherlock’s skin.
John sat on the edge of his seat, tears prickling the corners of his eyes.
He passed the blue Christmas tree and the Nativity scene near the Duomo and continued walking the cobbled streets past Santa Maria Novella and down the narrow street straight ahead that led to the river. While he normally crosses the river, this time he turned before the bridge and walked along the water until he came to the brightly lit “Teatro Communale”. He checked his watch and saw that he had plenty of time before the concert started at 21:00, but he went in regardless, too excited to wait.
“A nice choice”
“Probably” Irene replied, glancing at the door as Sherlock’s coat floated in the distance.
“It’s just one game, John! It could be fun for her!”
In order to get Sherlock out of that awkward conversation and to save herself anymore embarrassment Molly quietly said “I think the cookies are ready now.” And went over to the rack to get one for each of them. After they all had napkins and a cookie, Irene said goodbye and left them alone.
“Yes, yes of course.”
About a month after he’d been back and things were relatively back to normal, they got a new case. This one having to do with a Baskerville copycat. Only this time it didn’t have to do with a lab, it had everything to do with stealing and killing domestic pets and particularly dogs. It was then that I realized how invested into animal welfare Sherlock was. He was affected by that case more than he let on. When the case was finally cracked and we were safe back home in Baker Street, Sherlock locked himself into his room for 2 days. John didn’t understand why but eventually he emerged his old self and acted as if nothing was wrong. So John let it be.
Molly’s smile turned mischievous and Sherlock visibly turned even paler than he already was when Molly said “We’re going ice skating.”
“A compromise. Really Molly?”
“You are now pronounced husband and husband. You may now kiss one another.”
“Ok. So I’ve got all the chocolate; the chips and the blocks and I made sure I had the correct amount, I’ve also got the espresso powder and the peanut butter chips as well as the pecans and walnuts and the vanilla. Did you manage to find the rest in the cabinets and fridge?”
“John! You made it.”
“Hello, John. How was your medieval history class today?”
As the light shines on this particular flake, we zone in on a scene to behold…
As he walked to his ballet class, leaves of all colors were falling around him blowing his raven colored curls and making his coat float around him. Once he reached his building, he entered and Irene immediately bounded up and started talking about her weekend, or at least that’s what Sherlock presumed since he wasn’t listening. He felt a slap to his arm and he looked over at her in shock where Irene was glaring at him.
"I think you make a lovely couple."
"I would never experiment on you in that manner; you are far too precious for me to do that." Sherlock said determent.
"If they threaten to stomp us to death yes." A bit calmer Sherlock put his head on John's lap and said man began to stroke his hair.
"Yes, thank you John." Sherlock said and pressed a kiss on top of his head.
"Mummy! What are you doing here?" he asked surprised then he saw his mother, Angelica Minerva Holmes, sitting in his sofa rocking little Amalia who seamed to be enormously fascinated by the golden locket that always hung around his mother's throat.
"006 is 007 partner in crime, Russian by birth, pyromaniac stroke going strong."
"What do we have to do so they get that we're not interested?" He grumbled. An idea crossed Sherlock's mind and pulled away with the spirit of the night as he was he didn't stop to think before he acted on it. He stopped, pulled John around so they were facing each other, bent down and pressed their lips together. At first John didn't react, probably shocked Sherlock’s brain provided, but after a few second he started to kiss back. It wasn't a very long kiss and not really anything special but then they pulled back the catcalls had stopped. They resumed walking but Sherlock's body was full of tension. That certainly had been pushing it too far. After walking about 10 minutes in silence, he cleared his throat and spoke up.
"Presumably in the beginning of the movie convent since Kim thought Vanessa had borrowed the dress for that at first." Black jealousy flashed throw the detective's eyes but all he said was:
"Bloody annoying, never understood why people found it charming," John added while trying to save the little plush-bee from being chewed on. Not that it worked very well, Amalia could be very determined when she wanted. Before James had the chance to defend his honour Mrs Holmes swept through the door.
"James Bond"
"I wasn't proposing sex John, just a bit of cuddle and then sleep. Together. In mine or your bed, it doesn't really matter but mine is bigger. You did say you would fancy some sleep right?" He might have said that. It felt like ages ago, when it couldn't be more than an hour. Cuddling with Sherlock sounded nice. More than nice actually, it sounded amazing. He didn't really want to let go of the detective now that he got him close. Without thinking of the consequences he found himself agreeing.
"Dull but mummy enjoys it. Tell me more." John smiled a thin smile. People who thought Sherlock didn't care were dumb and blind.
"What do you want?" was the only answer he got, the temptation to slam his head in the table grew. John took a deep breath and straightened up his shoulders (here goes nothing).
"I had forgotten how much I hated university gossip" he muttered as he reached the consulting detective. Said man just hummed and slipped his arm around John's hips.
"Okay then just remember..."
Sherlock piss Anderson off.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And we was here for that and a nice date not a murder and tree climbing." His muttering didn't go unnoticed.
Now finally awake John sat up, the blanket pooling around his waist. Someone, probably Sherlock, had removed his socks, jumper and trousers when he slept and tucked him in under the blanket. Huh, he must have been really tried to not have noticed that. Yawning he got up pulling on a pair of pyjamas pants and a jumper padding towards the living room. He leaned against the doorway and watched Sherlock walking around, rocking Amalia as he sung. John didn't say anything just stood there watching the peaceful sight before him. In the end it was Sherlock who broke the spell.
"None of that now," his mother scrolled and cuffed him over the head.
"May I meet her sometime?"
"Logically I should lead since I'm taller". This was sooo not going the way he expected, but to hell if he was going to back down now. With a smile John linked their arms.
"And don't tell me you can't lose a trail anymore Em?" he couldn't help tease his brother who sat down next to Bond - the sitting placing was such he and John at one long side, Bond and Emanuel on the other long side Bond opposite of John and the brothers opposite of each other. At the short end between John and Bond Mummy was seated. Amalia sat in a child chair screwed onto the table between Mummy and John happily altering between dropping her bee to get John pick it up or banging it on various surfaces. The place between him and Em was empty but set for Father. He was probably out in the garden or in his little work shop, botanist by profession and tinkerer in his free time Father always had some project on.-
"It is rather hard to play the violin when the lady is damaging to be held," Sherlock said in a manner of explanation. John hummed stroking a blond lock out of Amalia's sleeping face.
What he knew:
"Good morning" John smiled like the smitten fool he was.
"How exactly do you know that?"
"John your computer is on the coffee table not in the kitchen." Sherlock said
"See for yourself," Sherlock said stepping aside and sinking down on the floor next to Amalia. On the bed lay a pair of dark jeans, a clear-green shirt and one of John's favourite beige cardigans. It was a really nice combo of fancy and John's own style. The doctor smiled and started dressing.
"You got it covered then," he said raising himself from the chair and moving towards the bed. It was reliving to see how easy and natural it had become for John to sleep and change in front of him. They had become a part of each other's life in a way that felt so right and warm.
I feel bad for John having to stay up all night, but it needed to be done. This is all I have for now but I will try to post more soon. It just have to be written and pass my wonderful beta AlexBSChris. So what do you think of the story so far? How did it? Please comment I'm dying to know what the readers think. I love kudos as well. Please talk to me I'm friendly.
"Sherlock who's that?" All three men looked up (not the baby she was starring fascinated at Q), a top of the three stairs stood a very rumbled blond man wearing an beige cardigan.
"Or something" he replied. Jolene's eyes went wide.
"Well shall this overprotective flat mate of yours take you home?" What Sherlock did next surprised him. The detective offered his own arm with the words:
"But you are not gay." The moment the words left his mouth he silently cursed himself. He could almost hear Mycroft mocking voice: Smooth little brother. Really and you claim to be intelligent. John just chuckled. How dared he?! Didn't he take this seriously?!
With a groan he tipped his head back and let it hit the wall behind the sofa. He had far too little information to come up with anything useful. The smell of tea and the clinking of cups brought him back to the present. As he opened his eyes he saw John sitting in his armchair eating some kind of pasta dish (pasta, smoked salmon, salad, tomato, cucumber and a honey dressing), a second plate was placed on the coffee table in front of him - right he had asked John to cook, but that was not important now, the case was. The case, John! - suddenly it clicked in Sherlock's brain. He had asked John to talk to the students, he might have the missing bits.
“They would be in danger of Amelia tearing them down,” he settled for. Their father sighted and turned to James.
"Vanessa nicknamed 'Ness was a good actor and well liked by everyone. Yesterday she was working at the cinema and before that she was at a movie convent. Apparently she was collecting old movie stuff. She also had a boyfriend but nobody has a high opinion of him."
Next morning then he woke up the warm feeling was still there and so was John who had turned during the night so he now lay on top of Sherlock. The doctor’s head was on the consulting detective's shoulder and he had his arms wrapped around him. He could get used to this Sherlock thought tightening his arms around the man above him letting his right hand wander down to John's butt. It was logical really, butts have a good shape to hold on to. And John had a nice butt, a really nice butt. Still half asleep he bent his head and nuzzled John's hair, completely content of just laying there enjoying the sensations. It lasted only 10 minutes before the man above him started to stir.
“He is a very likeable person,” 007 agreed before continuing
Extra information: the lovely landlady is from India. Big thanks to AlexBSChris for putting up with my spelling. You don't know that she is saving you from.
"With the kiss" Sherlock replied trying to suppress the blush.
"The bathroom his free" he said quietly as John opened his beautiful blue eyes. His flatmate nodded and rose.
"Q, what is happening?" it was 007 who had first dared to step forward to try to find out if there was as attack going on or something else equally dangerous. His partner in crime 006 already had his hand on his gun, thankfully still in its holster, and was scanning the room.
"Obviously we need to remove the dress to determine the course of death seeing as it covers most of her body." The consulting detective stated but had thankfully not removed the victims clothes himself, God bless the small victories.
"Thank you," John said ever so politely. He must have been drilled hard into it as child; maybe it was why he made such a good solider.
"Within the first 48h of knowing you I shot a man to kill you. I can defend you from a couple of cows."
"We are not taking it. Go bother the polices or something." He waved the teacher of as he went to their bedroom and slammed the door shut. John just stared at the door. What?! A minute ago his flatmate had been nearly bouncing up and down in excitement to get started and now this?
"Damn right it did, we figured something had blown up that wasn't supposed to blow up," Bond muttered utterly ignored by everyone.
"Isn't Watson still married to Rebecca?"
"No I'm not" he heard his doctor say. At this point he was beyond so he settled to glare down on the shorter man, raising an eyebrow in demand of an answer. John chuckles had passed on to giggles by the time he filled in the missing piece.
"Coming right up" and with those words he swooped out of the room.
"Oh," mummy seemed surprised that John hadn't met Em and threw a glare of her own in Sherlock's direction.
"Bond," Bond spoke up
extremely neat; the bed had been made up and a small cot was squeezed in between the desk and the bookshelf alphabetised N through to O. 007 eyes flicked around the room quickly probably gathering up all information he could about his quartermaster.
"Of course" the lady replied, opened the door wide and took a step back.
Everyone (except Mycroft he has a situation to handel) is gathering up at the Holmes mansion for a relaxing weekend, some things are getting revealed and John is finely letting Sherlock help him.
"A pleasure to meet you as always Captain," James Bloody Bond said with a smirk.
"You can eat while I talk." Sullenly Sherlock stabbed his fork throw some of the food and popped it into his mouth - it was the quickest way to get answers when John was like this. The food had a fresh slightly sweet taste (from the honey) but it wasn't important right now. Putting another forkful in his mouth he looked up at John, his eyes demanding answers.
"You are telling me that you are afraid of cows?" This was so precious.
"The car alarm will activate in 10 minutes I suggest you are out of the car by then," he said as he opened the boot and removed his messenger bag (holding his laptop and tablet) and his small suitcase. 007 hurried to exit the car as fast as possible and grab his own suitcase, he had learned what "car alarm" meant in Q's world the hard way (Q was a bit pleased about this he deserved it after all the cars he had stolen and crashed). Before anyone could come out and great them Q opened the big doors and walked in.
"You said it would be cows."
"Ah good afternoon Mrs. Holmes," he said softly not to disturb the sleeping baby.
Q quickly typed out a response.
"Visiting my grandchild of course," Angelica said opening the locker showing Amalia the two black and white pictures inside, one of his father Siger Charles Holmes and one of him, Mycroft and Emanuel.
“Go lie down 007, I’m going to make a pot of tea. Good night,” and with those words Q left the room.
The next morning John slowly began to stir as offending rays of light danced over his face. To escape he tried to roll over to his other side but failed. Suddenly he became aware of the solid heat against his back and the strong arms that hugged him tight. In fact his attempt to move only made the arm hug him closer. Slowly the day before started to come back to him: following Sherlock, the dance club, the kisses, going to bed together and his last words before falling asleep. A slow blush started to creep onto his face. He normally wasn't much of the blushing type but this was Sherlock. His wonderfully brilliant flatmate that he, oh better admit it now he thought for himself, that he frankly had a crush on since they first met and it was only growing.
"I didn't really mind. In fact you are most welcome to repeat the performance" he said. Now that wasn't any of the 48 possible outcomes that Sherlock had deducted. The combination of John and all surprises he had this evening shortcut the detective’s brain so all he managed to say was:
"Quit" he agreed. John continued
I firmly believe other little detective can control if he is waking up or not.
Then he somehow knew there he stood, not really he still didn't know how to handle this development, he settled down again fully intending to make the most of this wired and wonderful situation. It was really comfy laying there surrounded by Sherlock's heat. However his stomach had other plans. Just as he nuzzled back against his flatmate and started to drift of it let out a loud growl demanding food. John was very tempted to ignore it at first but after a second, even louder growl he gave in. With a sigh he tried to slip out of Sherlock's arms without waking the sleeping genius.
"I'm sure me and Charles can manage," Sherlock said, softly pushing John in the direction of the main door.
"Hmm" Sherlock started looking through the mess on the desk looking after
"No I even don't wanna know" he settled with as the detective and his doctor exited the flat.
"That she will need feeding in 23,7 minutes yes, I remember John," Sherlock said picking the girl up from John's arms and placing her on his right hip. This got another small snort out of the man.
At this point I don't know what I'm doing anymore. It is spinning out of control.
"Eat your toast now. I figured we could have some scones and talk later" So there would be a talk then Sherlock thought, it wasn't unexpected. He sat down and took a bite of his toast to please his doctor. It tasted good. He decided it was acceptable to eat breakfast if this was what was served.
"And she has that boyfriend of hers. He might have a key. Never really liked him, she said she met him at a movie festival, but something about him throws me off" John nodded as he wrote that info down, 'boyfriend fishy, has key, check up'
"Besides contrary to popular belief I have dated and had sexual relationship. It just takes a lot for me to get attract to someone in that fashion, so I have no need for more examination" John looked a bit confused over this extremely clear statement.
"Emanuel, but at work they call me Q. I have heard all about you John," Emanuel said with a polite smile.
"So what do you want to know? Vanessa is a good kid, always pays her rent on time, it is a shame that someone would rob a nice one as her"
"Isn't it obvious?" The detective replied from his place halfway up the tree.
Victim -> Vanessa Miricho, 26 years old, female, looked a lot like Rose in the Titanic movie (awfully boring movie about big ship sinking, mummy liked it) studying to become an actress, good student, lived alone, liked colour, equal right activist, kept flat neat by habit, had had a boyfriend (dislike but facts was lacking), hobbies: movies and painting.
"She will need to be feed in 35 minutes, don't forget to burp her and she will probably wanna play a bit after that..." John was cut off by Mrs. Holmes stern voice.
....things happens.
"You are already doing so much for us, letting us stay here and all."
"She didn't show up on any of Mycroft records," Sherlock huffed annoyed.
Thanks to AlexBSChris for being an amazing beta.
"Ehh yes it is the countryside, dear. Still don't see the issue here."
"Sherlock what are you doing?!"
"They are terrifying!" John blinked twice.
"Was he in the army?"
"Cat" John said fondly and finely shut of the annoying beeping noise.
"Since the lady extended the mess to me I saw no reason not to pick outfits that worked well together," the almost stroppy reply came. John shook his head.
They where sitting in their living room talking to a new client. Apparently small children had gone missing spread out over the last two month. Most came from pretty crappy families so the police had just called it run-aways. Now the teacher in the local primary school had gone to London to heir them to find the kids.
"She is gone now so it doesn't matter? I will talk with John about your offer when he wakes up. Now it was very nice of you to stop by and help John but it is almost mealtime for Amalia so you should leave." Sherlock said taking the girl from his mother and not so subtly pushing her towards the door.
"Due to the marks in the grass it is the most likely conclusion," Sherlock said as he reached the nest. A pleased 'ahha' left his mouth as he pulled a silver knife covered in blood out of the nest. That was the exact moment then the tree decided that it had had enough of climbing grown ups and promptly gave away under Sherlock's feet. The detective stumbled towards the ground and John instantly stepped forward trying to catch the falling man. That ended up with both of them laying in a heap on the ground.
“Me? Never. John became a friend since he had an interest in actually keeping me alive,” 007 said casually. Q hummed turning back to his computer wishing he had a cup of tea.
"We are going back to Baker Street, you can tell me there." With those words Sherlock swept out of the room still with a firm hand on John's hip. John was more than happy to be tugged a long and then he threw a look over his shoulder he saw Kim mouthing 'someone is getting laid'. With a giggle he turned his head back and slipped his own arm around Sherlock. Dating Sherlock Holmes was weird but absolutely wonderful.
"She wasn't asking John. Beside the countryside air could be good for you and Amalia. Giving you a chance the rest and recover" Sherlock said and the doctor had a sudden flashback of being ordered to bed a few hours earlier.
“Perhaps, if you told me a bit more about your relationship with Doctor Watson. Given the amount of times I seen you breaking out of medical and John only needed to give you a look for you to remove your shirt, I would say your relation runs a bit deeper than him just patching you up,” Q said spinning his chair around to face 007.
"I didn't mean to dump over Amalia on you and your mum like that," John sighed and if he hadn't been holding the baby he would have buried his head in his hands.
"The ones with keys to the flat are the victim, her mother that lived in Sussex, the landlady and possibly the fishy boyfriend. Also Miss Miricho was studying to become an actress and was apparently chosen to be the female lead for the end of term project."
"Sherlock. Sherlock come out here." John continue poking on the blanket pile that was Sherlock until a head popped up.
“It was nice seeing John again,” 007 said rapidly changing the subject.
“I didn’t take you for the reading type,” 007 said tailing his finger over the back on the books at shelf P.
"So and so. Everybody likes Ness, she is very friendly." Damn no obvious enemy, time to play it a bit risky. John let out a laugh and let a charming smile play on his lips.
"Okey. As long as we keep distance to the cows."
"He is and a workaholic so he won't be here until dinner so why don't you take a little nap? I can Amalia down to the green room and entertain her," he proposed already picking up the bag containing some of Amalia's toys and slinging it over his shoulder. For a moment John looked like he wanted to protest but then he seemed to remember their talk on the train.
"Oh and mummy have invited us to come visit us over the weekend,"
"Puns really John?"
Because 007 and Doctor Watson already had met they had decided (without listening to his protests that he didn't need a bodyguard. Honestly what did they think about him? He was the Quartermaster of MI6 and a Holmes. He could take care of himself!) that 007, James Bond was most suitable. With a sigh he started to pulled himself together (one of the extremely important lessons he had learned growing up with his family) as his family home came in view. It was a lovely white painted wood mansion with three floors, two wings and a lovely garden. Between the trees he caught a glimpse of the laboratory he and Sherlock had shared as children (maybe he would get some time to tinker this weekend that would be lovely).
"Do any of you recognise this woman?" he asked.
"You are still alive you suicidal wanker?!" John stared in disbelief at the blond man standing next to an armchair leaning his hip on it.
"They all were," mummy laughed.
“Biebers and threats, we will make a proper spy out of you yet,” 007 joked but quickly added when Q glared pointily first at the bed then the cot:
"Obviously we need to remove the dress to determine the course of death seeing as it covers most of her body." Why did he even try to explain this to idiots? Before Anderson could answer John entered the room (his John it was amazing to think of him like the now, finely). Apparently his suggestion of removing the clothes had been a bit no good seeing as John immediately tried to convince him to let Molly do it. Well that was acceptable, Molly did her job alright. Seeing as she was murdered in her sleep the next logical step was to visit her flat - the most likely crime scene. He snuck a look at the police file, good they already had an ID on the victim. Vanessa Miricho, an employee at this cinema. With this information he called for his John to come along and exited the building already typing on his phone finding out the address - lucky the victim had an unusual last name so it wasn't any misleading addresses. He hailed a cab and they were off again.
"Thank you for the offer, but it is fine really," John tried to brush her off.
"And you just had to match your clothes?" John teased as he sat up.
Time for the talk
Sherlock wasn't the only one who made observations at 221B Baker Street, John did too. His was mostly just not as exciting as Sherlock's, but lately some of his observations had gotten his attention. An example of this were that every Friday Sherlock took an early shower, washed and styled his hair, made a ruckus going throw his wardrobe, packed a duffel bag and left. He didn't get back until 3-4 am the next morning and by Saturday evening they had more money on their bill account. This pattern was only changed by cases. At first the doctor didn't pay it any mind, the detective did have a strange set of habits, but one night he decided to follow his flat mate. The main reason was that he was pissed at him. Earlier that week Sherlock had interrupted his date, gotten himself hurt and left discussing experiment in the kitchen again. So when Sherlock swooped out of the flat John had quickly put his novel down and followed him. Luckily for him, on Fridays Sherlock apparently walked. He followed his friend through London to the parts that were frequented by party people and students. The chase became easier now, since John wasn't exactly unaware of this area. After a while Sherlock slipped through the backdoor of a building called "Mercus". In John's time that building had hosted a rather crappy but cheap bar, now it seemed to be some kind of fancy club with dance shows. The doctor circled the club a couple of times to make it less obvious that he was stalking his flat mate. He didn't think spotting Sherlock inside would be very hard, like seriously that man was ridiculously tall, not to mention that face with those cheekbones..... Realizing his thought had spun off in clearly of limits lines John shook his head and entered. The first thing that he noticed was the music. He had never heard something like that before. The song had a clear beat and somehow managed to be both sensual and sexy at the same time. The next thing he saw was the stage. Well he was right, Sherlock wasn't hard to spot.
"Now let me up" he added before Sherlock had the chance to protest.
"We slept in" Sherlock said. "Text me the details and the address. We will meet you there." With those words he was up and on his way to gather his coat.
“Bugger, where did you find this? Discarded from the military?” he complained.
~ SH ~
"Fine but just two hours," he said and carefully handed over the baby and took a look on his watch.
"Hey, wake up Sherlock it is morning." It took a couple of more not so gentle nudges with his elbow before the detective started to stir. It didn't however have the desired effect. The only thing that happened was that said man tangled their legs even more and nuzzled his head down where John's neck met shoulder. He started to kiss the sensitive flesh and a shiver went down John's spine.
"See you soon" he mumbled and then disappeared into the bathroom. John remind in the same place for a while trying to gather up his thoughts again. If Sherlock continued to catch him by surprise like this he would look a lot of stupider in the near future. Oh well that wasn't exactly a problem that needed to be solved at 3 am, John reasoned and moved up the stairs to get his night clothes. During his time in the military he had picked up the habit of sleeping in just his underpants and a T-shirt so it just was to pull on his pants if something happened. And that was a habit he stuck with, it could be useful then one lived with the world’s only consulting detective. Well up in his room he stripped out of his clothes and pulled on a pair of new underwear and an old T-shirt from his time in the army. He had got it from a marine guy and once up on time it had been in the standard dark blue but now it had faded to a lighter shade. It sat tightly over his chest and was soft in a way only well used shirts become. When he was dressed he went downstairs again and sat down in his armchair waiting for his turn to use the bathroom.
However it was, he was exhausted. He couldn't remember the last time he slept more then a couple of hours in a night. Sherlock had been amazing babysitting Amalia the days he had gone to the clinic to work and even offered to be the one how walked around with Amalia then she woke them in the middle of the night. John had declined. He didn't want to bother his flatmate more then he already did and also he was the father - he needed to do this, take care of his little angel.
"It is only a matter of time. Besides Doctor Watson married Mary and since she technically doesn't exist it shouldn't be a problem," Q waved him off and then looked down as he felt a tingle at his temple. The little girl he was holding had got a hold of one of his locks and was tugging it, since it didn't hurt too much and seemed to amuse her Q let her continue.
John thought as he laid on the sofa with Amalia on his chest. They had been living in 221B for one week now and he and Sherlock had continued their sleeping arrangement as it was since that gave them the most sleep. Not that it was a lot of sleep. Amalia still wasn't used to the change and woke up all the time screaming. She was either hungry or just wanted to be carried around and rocked. John thought she did it so that he wouldn't forget her and leave her too, but then again what did he know. He spoke Sherlock not baby.
"They later on helped my ID the supposed Mary Watson as Rebecca Frost. I'm sorry," he said turning to John.
"Really what are they putting on?"
"Yeah sadly Rose dress was stolen. Like have people no respect for an artist work! Now I have to redo the whole thing and 'Ness haven't shown up yet" John didn't have the heart to tell the young designer that his work was most likely in an evidence bag down at the yard.
"Yes they are awful big monsters that will stomp you to death!" Okey it was very bad to start giggling now.
"I'm a soldier Sherlock, I can read people too. Down there that can mean the difference between life and death."
Confrontation time! They will actually talk to each other now.
It's time for dinner in the Holmes manor and we get to know a bit more about everyone.
I blame everything on that it is 3 am. Nobody is sane at 3 in the morning. How did this turn into fluff?
This worked about as well as the first time. That would be not at all, despite his skinny form the detective was really strong something John had witness many time. The next step, which would be waking Sherlock up, made John stop up for a moment. The detective rarely slept and he wanted him to have all the rest he could. Another firm growl quickly put an end to that and he pushed back against the man sleeping behind him and nudged him with his elbow.
"Oh you are awake now," he said sitting down on the sofa, still holding Amalia, gesturing to John to do the same. John sat down and reached out to shift his daughter over to his arms.
"And don't drag national security into this my clearances is still good enough."
"Yes yes I'm leaving," Angelica said pressing first one kiss to Sherlock's cheek and then one to Amalia's forehead.
So guess who is back?! Yes yes I know it been a year but a lot have happened. But I haven't forgotten you and here is a brand new chapter for you all.
I like Sherlock's co-worker and Sherlock is a tease.
The trip to the victim’s apartment took a good half an hour. It was located in a quiet nice building giving what the rent was (Sherlock had looked it up to get a hum of the victims economic situation). There wasn't really any possibility to sneak in so Sherlock got them in by showing the landlady a police badge (stolen from Lestrade) and claiming they had been called in on a bugler in Miss Miricho's flat. The lie wasn't so far of it turned out as they entered the flat. The airy living room was a mess, DVDs and video tape mixing with each other on the floor, a lamp was knocked over and had shattered and a bookshelf was pushed aside revealing an empty whole in the wall. Sherlock swept through the room muttering as he went along.
"Aye, you just go inside with the little one Mister. Young Master and I will follow with the bags," the driver said starting to gather up the bags. A flash of amusement that Sherlock couldn't place crossed John's face but since the man just correct his grip around Amalia and started walking to towards the house he didn't pay it any attention. Sherlock heaved the diaper bag up on his shoulder and then took the bags Charles had left before following John. His long strides made him catch up quickly. Had they always had such difference in their normal speed of waking? How much had John hurried his steps up to always keep up with him? Or was this new speed because of Amalia? He was in the middle of a calculation comparing different speed of John's walk when the front door opened and mummy walked out.
"Yes he was an army doctor, honourable discharge, not everyone recovers from a bullet to the shoulder Bond. Why do you know him?" Q said.
"Sleep well," he said as he exited the room and closed the door behind him.
"That will be nice I haven't had the pleasure," John said throwing a glare at Sherlock who shuffled his feet. Even if John hadn't said anything he got the feeling that not telling your roommate that you had another brother was a bit not good.
Waking up is always fun.
"I think her mother has one, but she lives in Sussex, no friends that are that close, oh and I have one but I keep it safe" she said and patted her hand over her heart.
"Would not think so. He is with me" he snarled at the offending idiots calling after them. At the same time he slipped his arm out of John's, encircled his wrist and pulled him flushed against is side. Realizing what he had done he tensed a bit. What if he had pushed it too far? He looked down on his doctor but said man just smirked, looked up on him threw his pale lashes and snaked his arm around Sherlock’s wrist putting his hand on his slim hip. Sherlock relaxed, he hadn't pushed it too far. He decided he preferred this way of walking. This display didn't have the desired effect, if something it just increased the catcalls. John spoke up for the first time since they left the ally.
"Well I suppose we should introduce ourselves then Amalia," he said looking into the girls deep blue eyes.
"Oh yes, his apparently assassin wife left him alone with a teething baby without any warning that do wear on people," Sherlock snarked.
"The recommended amount of sleep is 8 hours and we slept just a bit more so I would say that it doesn't matter that much." John groaned and buried his head in Sherlock's collarbone.
"Thank you Q, didn't know you cared," Bond inserted and then did his best to hide a wince -it was hard to tell if it was Emanuel or John that had kicked him under the table, maybe both. For all Sherlock knew it could just as well been Mummy even if she was more the type to 'accidentally' press down the heel of her stiletto on someone's toes if she felt that they had been behaving inappropriately. He had seen her do it many times during the more political dinners she sometimes arranged.-
"Sherlock?"
"The student with green hair has been checking you out for at least the quarter I have been standing here" he whispered in John's ear. Without turning his head he replied.
“Do you want the long or the short version? I got the list alphabetised,” Q fired back.
"'How bad can it be?' 'How bad can it be?!" he sounded almost frantic now.
"Good morning" Sherlock replied and cracked a small smile of his own. Now this position could be very embarrassing and John didn't intend to stay there long.
"It isn't hygienic!" John replied.That comment made Sherlock enter a rant of why John was wrong. It felt nice doing their ordinary bickering, nice to know that their relationship wouldn't change too much even with the new addition. They were in the middle of a heated discussion on the subject of why chemicals should be on safe distance from food when Lestrade burst through the door. John turned his head when he heard the footstep, body tensing slightly before recognising the DI. Sherlock had known who it was as soon as he heard the footstep in the stairs, but he thought John's soldier instinct was cute even if he should have known the sound of Lestrade's steps by now.
"Have you called Lestrade?" his doctor asked
"I'm a designer. Made it to top of my class this year so I got to do the main leads clothes!" Their eyes light up again as they talked about their work.
"What is your name?"
"I certainly do not...." Sherlock started looking a bit put out. John just raised an eyebrow.
John hid an amused smile by putting his last forkful of food in his mouth. It was a little game he played, too see how much he could make Sherlock do then he had the information/thing the detective wanted. Today he was kind since he still was softened up after the snogging that had happened in the cab. Still he waited until Sherlock had at least had eaten five forkful before he pulled up his notebook and started speaking.
"I'm too tried to do the math but we really need better sleeping habits." Sherlock hummed and stroke his left hand up and down John's back letting it slip under his vest to find naked skin.
“I like Doctor Watson more and more,” Q said with a smile.
"'Night love" and with these word said they drifted off to sleep.
"It agreed quit fine, she have been quiet all the way," John replied politely.
"Kim Westerstein"
When he was finished they went downstairs. John was carrying Amalia, who in her turned was carrying the little bee. In the saloon they entered it was already two men, a young one with wild curls and glasses wearing a brown cardigan and...
"Banks" the teacher replied.
"So shall I text Mr Brown and tell him we will take the case?"
“He is just the same but with greyer hair.”
“Listen I been working on this blue rose project and I think I almost succeeded. Do you want to have some stickling’s to take home and raise? It will brighten up that awful grey London, I simply don’t get how you live there of your own free will, a lot.” Their father rambled on happily completely unaware of the tension in the room.
Sherlock took his time in the bathroom scrubbing the makeup from his face and washing the sweat away. Mostly he tried to calm down and gather his thoughts. He didn't know what had flown into him then he asked John to sleep with him. Not that he didn't want to mind you, but it was such a risk. For some reason a tune from one of those TV shows his mother had watch drifted throw his mindpalace: "I'm hooked on a feeling. I'm high on believing that you're in love with me". When he had heard the song as a child he had thought it was ridiculous and tried to delete it. Apparently it hadn't worked. Well he could sympathise with it now. It was not really any other explanation to this situation. When he couldn't drag it out anymore he pulled on a light blue T-shirt, fresh underpants and a pair of deep blue silk pyjamas pants. When he exited the bathroom he lost his breath. John was sitting half asleep in his chair, head in his hand, wearing a thin worn T-shirt that hugged his still muscular torso and a pair of underpants. Sherlock had never seen John in this state of undressed before. The consulting detective stopped short for a moment taking in and memorising every new detail of his doctor. When he had everything safely stored away in his John-wing he quietly crossed the room to wake his John. Since he already had gone way out of line today he didn't hold back as usually and placed a kiss on top of John's head before he lightly shook his shoulder to wake him up.
"I'm your uncle and you can call me Q but Sherlock is most likely going to refer to me as Em. It is a pleasure to meet you little one," the only reply he got was a small giggle and a harder pull of his hair. A small smile played on his lips. Now that he had got over the first chock he felt that it would be kind of nice to be an uncle and little Amalia was adorable (not that he was going to admit it out loud. He had his reputation to think about).
"On a second thought I don't need to know that about my brother-in-law."
"Let me take that," Sherlock said putting a hand on John's shoulder and freeing Amalia's diaper bag from him with the other.
"She went home hours ago," Sherlock answered shrugging, they was sitting so close on the sofa that their shoulders brushed. Unknowing John leaned into the contact until the meaning of Sherlock's words hit him and he sat up ramrod straight.
John is not above manipulate Sherlock then needed.
Then you think of what an consulting detective can be afraid of you might think of that the work will hurt their loved ones or that they will one day wouldn't be fast enough but never this. John was still giggling a bit hours after finding out. If that didn't qualify him as an "good boyfriend" anymore he didn't care. It all started like this:
"Take Amalia and put her in the crib, I'm getting supper started."
"Exactly! And what is this restaurant famous for?" Sherlock continue quiz his boyfriend as he climbed higher in the tree. John was starting to get nervous, the tree didn't look like it should be able to support the consulting detective's wight.
"Will you shot them?"
“Sure, make yourself comfortable. I was not planning on sleeping much anyway,” Q replied absently rising up from his chair. 007 frowned a bit at the statement almost like he was worried. (What made it his business to worry about Q’s sleeping habits? If he was worried about Q’s health there was better ways to help - like not destroying his bloody equipment all the damn time.)
"Stand down 007, 006, this does not concern you," Q ordered his eyes never leaving the screen there he went through all the security and trackers he had placed.
"It seems like the report of a burglar at Miss Miricho's place was correct and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of minutes to answer some questions?"
"Obviously I was dancing John, surely you must be familiar with the concept." John just laughed.
"Missing" John mutter and earned himself a glare. Taking a deep breath he did his best to recall the wound on the victims throat.
"Don't you have any respect for a doctor's hard work putting you back together again?! And what did you do to that shoulder?!" John continue ignoring two pair of confused eyes staring at him.
"Just tea and toast for me John!" With a chuckle for this typical Sherlock attitude the doctor began the new day.
"You seem close to Miss Miricho"
"Don't do it again." Ah Sherlock was the jealous boyfriend not really a surprise there.
As soon as John left the room Sherlock started walk towards the bedroom, his suspected crime scene. He was already done with the living room, the marks on the floor indicated that the bookshelf had been moved often- the hole in the room had stored something the owner took out often and looked at, the movies thrown out everywhere- the bugler knew the area and where to look but not exactly (heard about the thing hidden in the hole but never seen it been taken out? - the bugler was someone the victim trusted and knew? ->possible but not enough data to be sure), the lamp knocked over- the bugler had left in a hurry. The bugler was also most likely male given the foot prints on the shelf where it had been kicked. The bedroom was a completely different thing. The walls were painted in a wonderful shade of blue (almost the same as John's eyes but a bit lighter) and the roof was white. Everything was colourful or beautiful bare woods, the closet was purple with green leaf painted on the doors, the carpet was a play of red, orange, purple and pink, it was a green drawer that contained art supplies, pencils, notebooks, a couple of games and other stuff a uni girl needs, the old fashion timeless wooden bed was neatly made but then he lifted up the blanked he could see that someone had been sleeping there last night. Ah, his conclusion that the victim had been asleep was gaining points. Studying the print on the floor it seemed to match the ones in the cinema. There was also two pair of female footprints - one belonged to the victim and for the other one the landlady? A cleaner? All footprints led to the bed at one point. Then taking a closer look on the ones belonging to the male he saw that then leaving the bed it was heavier on left side- his theory of the victim being murdered here and carried away was more and more likely. He was going through the bathroom when John got back.
"Of good reasons" John mumbled before offering his arm as a joke
"A good steak and a fancy environment." John said and then muttered:
"Where did you say you where from now again?" John ask going throw his notes to check if all important information was there.
"Who is playing the leads?"
~ Q ~
John Watson can cook fight me! Also all receipt mention in this and the last chapters are stuff I make so it actually taste good.
"Sorry to interrupt but you have reached your address gentlemen" John refused to be embarrassed as he pulled back, he was an ex-army doctor and he had been nicknamed three-continents-Watson.... Okay he was embarrassed, it felt a bit as getting caught by your grandma. Sure a non-judging grandma who was glad for you but still. Even if he felt like a teenager caught red handed he didn't let it show as he slipped out of the cab, paid and walked towards the academy's entrance holding Sherlock's hand firmly.
"Except for the ordinary jealousy for her getting the main lead, it was nothing. Nobody could really stay grumpy with her long." He wasn't going to get out much more from Kim now so he thanked the designer and moved on. While talking to the other students he got more than less the same answers. Vanessa Miricho was a nice girl with a lot of talent, nobody got way she was dating that loser that did nothing of himself just taking small jobs to keep himself floating, she had been working at the cinema where they had found her body, she had a big collection of old movie stuff, the budget was mean, this and that department had no idea what they were doing, how did the professors think they had time for all that homework and so on and so on. Then he finely saw part of his partner’s coat and he quickly said his goodbyes and hurried over.
"Sherlock..." the doctor began to protest. Feeding the baby and changing the diapers was one thing but staying at the parents place for a weekend was in a completely different dimension, it had to be some borders.
"Here take Amalia for a while and don't let your pet killer hold her," and with those words he was racing up the stairs.
"Well Em is the Quartermaster hence Q and your friend is one of his agent, a double-0 agent. 007 wasn't it, Em?" Sherlock continued and Emanuel looked like he regretted his earlier slip up.
"I said just tea and toast John" the detective spoke up. The doctor didn't even flinch; he just continued working the dough in front of him as he replied:
"I...."
"I'm bisexual"
"Of course, she did John. She is a baby." Sherlock huffed.
"Do you mind terribly if we take our stuff upstairs and unpack a bit?" the doctor asked.
"A bit possessive, are we" she said as she patted his hand.
"I can imagine that. I bet he was a handful as a child," he said and because of the smile that light up his face Sherlock forgave mummy for the comment on his childhood. It was nice to see John smile again – those exhausted forced in a sense of politeness smiled that had been common lately did not count.
"Yes please tell us," 007 asked putting one hand on Q:s neck working out the knots that had formed there - God damn double-0:s and their magical hands. Still shell-shocked Q let his fingers still and leaned back slightly in the amazing hand.
When you live with the world only consulting detective you really shouldn't let anything surprise you anymore. But still the only thing John could do then he saw Sherlock on stage was to let his chin hit the floor and hoped nobody noticed. Damn that man was hot. Of course he was hot every day of the week, even then he was sulking on the sofa in only a sheet, but this was something special. His long leg was being showed off in skin hugging fishnet socking, the black enlighten his pale skin, those sexy, sexy cheekbones was highlighted by a red blush, not to speak of how close those small shorts that showed off a very fine piece of arse and John was about to lose it then he came to the purple corset. He had never imagined Sherlock wearing anything like that, but now it seemed as the most natural (and sexy) thing in the world. And don't even get him started on his movements. For yes, believe it or not, Sherlock was dancing. John hadn't seen this particular dance form before but it sure suited Sherlock. It was both sensual and brutally honest at once. The movement sensual and beautiful but it was a clear attitude in it. 'This is not the time to get turned on', John quietly reminded himself in his head. Of course Sherlock choose just that moment to find him and lock eyes with him and smirked as he linked arms with the other dancers and kicked his leg straight up the air. 'Oh well' John thought as his knees gave in and he sunk down on a nearby chair 'so much for going by unnoticed'. Then he regained some brain function, he adjusted himself in the chair and lifted his hand to order a pint, now than he was here he could as well enjoy the show but if he was going to need a drink. Then he got his drink he leaned back, crossed his legs and locked his eyes on Sherlock. They would have such as interesting Saturday conversion this week.
"Ah that explains a couple of things" John replied
"Of course you had your own laboratory," John said with an amused voice. What was so funny about that? It was perfectly logical to have a separate place for experiments so they don't get affected by outside interference.
"But it does if it upset you," 006 said even if he let go of his gun and stepped closer.
"Awww how caring of you 'Lock, I can see the sweet couple mummy is taking about," Q says teasingly.
"And I didn't know you existed until last week," John said with a glare in Sherlock's direction who handed him Amalia back thinking somehow would spare him.
"Guilty on all charges," The bloody bastard was still smiling like he could charm his way out of this, not that that has ever worked on John.
Sherlock is done with is research for now and it is time for bed.
"Get me a cup as well." The doctor was very tempted to ask 'what is the magic word?' but choose not to. He just filled and flicked on the kettle, took their biggest pot from the shelf, measured up the tea and poured milk into a small container. This was going to be a long night.
“Emanuel, Sherlock you are home!” he exclaimed happily.
"We are not a couple," Sherlock denied flustered feeling all of 15 again when mummy had caught him kissing the gardeners son and decided that they needed to have The Talk. She had reassured him that she didn't care which sexual orientation he had but he had to be careful if he was going to have sex and please do read up on the subject, it had been a interesting experience but nothing he wished to repeat.
"Hello. My name is John and I'm covering your end of term project for my blog, could you spear a couple of minutes to answer some questions?" All he said was kind of true so he didn't feel bad about lying. The young student lit up by his question and let out a cheerful:
"I know what to do John, I raised three boys remember?"
"So if you want to give it a serious try then I'm all in but if not I will back away and we will forget that this ever happened. He looked up and caught Sherlock pale blue eyes observing every move he made.
"They are all in silver, cleaned so well they are nearly shining and the knifes is very sharp."
"Ah ha" he said and held up an IPhone with a rainbow case - no surprise there the whole flat went in rainbow colour. He went out in the kitchen and opened the lockers until he found the cocoa. Sherlock took a small amount and put it on the screen before tipping it so the cocoa ran across the entire area. This trick revived four clearer fingerprints that matched the numbers 1,3,7,9 (how simple and unsafe). Going directly to "texts" he found the contact "Micke<3" pressing the contact he got the number which he made a search on and got the name Mikel Smith, but he had no address registered with the phone company that had the number. Doing a search on the name he got 58 hits only in London.
Then Sherlock went off the stage the final time, John paid for his beer and exited the club. After a short discussion with himself he rounded the building to the door Sherlock had entered. Not wanting to get hit on he went a bit into the ally and leaned back against the wall, one foot steadily placed on the wall and armed crossed other his chest. Then he waited. He didn't have to wait long, after about 20 minutes the door opened and the detective exited. John's breath caught in his throat. If his flat mate was hot on stage he was stunning now. He hadn't removed the makeup which enlightened all his attractive face and he still walked with the sensuality he had witness tonight. With a smile playing on his lips John kicked away from the wall and approached Sherlock.
"Since when did family weekend become such a big security risk that it warrant a double-0?"
Warning for a bit of catcalling. No details but it is there. Oh and things start to speed up.
"Not my own. I had to share with Em. Half of it is mine dedicated to chemistry and half is his focused on computers and engineering. Sometime he drifted over to my part it was a bit annoying he is terribly neat, no idea there he got that from," he finished putting the clothes away, closed the wardrobe and turned around.
"You should cook more" he said taking another small bite.
"Would you like to sleep with me?" John's mind went blank and the only word he could choke out was:
"What?!" Oh dear God Anderson was here, what a bother.
"Well you can't match me in too I know for a fact that I don't own anything purple," he couldn't help teasing Sherlock a bit. It was just too adorable that he had match his clothes with Amalia's, almost as if they were a little family. A warm fussy feeling was filling John and he could feel himself smiling, it had been a good idea to come here.
"Who is fooling who?" 007 asked innocently (not that Q was fooled but he wanted to rant about it so he decided to answer).
15 minutes later, when John exited the bathroom clad in the clean pants while rubbing his hair dry with a sinfully soft towel, he saw Sherlock laying something down on the bed - the clothes he picked probably. Amalia was lying on the soft play-carpet joyfully tugging on a small plushie-bee's wings.
"The murderer is most likely male, killed her when she was asleep and carried her away to the cinema. No sign of entrance so he had a key - the victim knew him very well. We should check up that boyfriend of hers. Did the landlady say a name?"
"Please call me Kalyani. Is your partner coming too?"
"I'm considered the normal one in our family and you are asking how bad can it be?!" His hysterical rant was cut of by his private phone chiming with a text message. Quickly he scrambled to read it hoping that it somehow would magic away this mess.
Sherlock is woken not so kindly.
"Will, are you ready to start your show now?" Sherlock stretched up, an extra 3 cm added to his already spectacular height, let his baritone voice drop to a purr as he answered:
So this was the final chapter of this part. Yes this part, it will be more. Did you really think I could let them go now? The next part is gonna be more case!fic but don't worry it will be plenty of Johnlock too. And besides they still haven't talked about the dancing. Thanks to everyone that have read this, please leave kodus and comment and tell me what you thought about it. Lastly a big thanks to lovely AlexBSChris for being an amazing beta! <3
"And it is doubtful that that is her real name. As far as I know there is only one assassin foolish enough to run around giving away his real name." Both frowned, Emanuel should really have a talk with Bond about that.
“Maybe. Depends on what we do.”
“I’m well aware of the amount of time you’ll be gone. I am going to be your contact here if anything were to go wrong though, so I’m sure we’ll be in touch.”
John carried Sherlock lovingly in the strong cradle of his arms, and moved into his bedroom so he could place him on the queen sized bed. John stepped back and smiled at Sherlock; letting his eyes roam fully over his body, admiring not only the breath taking beauty he encompassed, but also the contrast of his skin to the purple sheets that covered the mattress.
Sherlock finished the piece and turned to Victor and raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock just got out of a particularly dull analytical chemistry lab and decides he wants to see Victor. He makes his way to Victor’s dorm and once he arrives at Victor’s door, knocks and waits.
"Get some sleep," John assured, moving to his back and bringing his to his side. He settled Sherlock’s head against his heart and his fingers against his sternum, while groaning softly as sleep crept up to shroud his in darkness.
Sherlock startled by this said “Sure. We could always use extra help.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock smiled and glided over to her with ease, helping her up “It’s alright Molly. I’m sure you’ll be back at it in no time.”
Sherlock's head snapped up, heart racing, “How did you know that! Is it that obvious?”
And aside from the art, the “Metamorphoses” motifs all over the city made him so happy. And of course that brought Sherlock to the forefront of his mind, again. Back home in England, both John and Sherlock had not only studied Ovid in their Latin classes but their history classes as well and now getting to see so much of the artwork surrounding each tragically beautiful tale, he was awestruck. His absolute favorite piece that he’d seen was the “Daphne and Apollo” statue in the Borghese Gallery. It was sculpted by the incredible Bernini and the ability to create something of that beauty from marble is absolutely amazing. It portrays the scene of Daphne running away from the god Apollo who wants her for his own in every way and at the last second before he manages to grab her, she’s turned into a tree. The sculpture captures her transformation from woman to tree and the leaves are paper thin. When John saw that sculpture, he shivered and shed a tear.
