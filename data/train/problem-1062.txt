“Care?” John supplies.
Everything around them seems to melt away, the music muffling in John’s ears as they brush their bodies together. John is absently aware of how they must look, knows the others are probably grinning at their writhing bodies and nudging each other with winks. He doesn’t care, just grips Sherlock harder.
He sounds surprised. Which is to be expected. John hasn’t come round in weeks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock shrugs.
Sherlock hadn’t promised John that the brief kisses they had shared meant anything. God, he was
Maybe it wasn’t guilt over Mary’s death at all, maybe he always knew he wasn’t to blame for that. Because, admittedly yes, he simply
He belatedly realises he is standing, and not knowing what to do he takes one step towards Sherlock’s door. He stops. What exactly is he going to do, burst in and demand Teddy leave?
“Do you want me to call the police?” John had asked.
“I am sick and tired of your-“John was cut off his very important accusation as Sherlock swiftly jumped forward and grabbed his face. His palms were cool and were a welcome relief to John’s flushed skin.
John gives him a sharp look.
“Has she gone?”
Turning around, John gets a strong sense of déjà vu as he stares at Sherlock’s ruffled form, the light from his bedroom illuminating him from behind like an angel. John closes his laptop with one hand, ignoring the way Sherlock’s eyes follow the movement, and stands up to stretch.
For some reason, the words unsettle John more than the situation itself and he sits up abruptly, tugging Sherlock’s face away from him and pulling him upright.
“What was the point of that? We are actually supposed to be here, you know!” John snapped, the cage digging into his back uncomfortably.
John frowns slightly as he watches his old friend make his way around the table and gently takes the bloody tea towel from Sherlock’s hand with a small smile and chucks the ruined thing into the washing machine. He comes back with the kitchen roll and mutters something close to Sherlock’s ear. The detective slides his phone into his pocket and rolls his eyes in response, snatching the kitchen roll away from the blonde. Teddy murmurs a laugh and goes to snatch it back, but Sherlock pulls it away before he can reach it with a smug smile. Teddy reaches for it again and this time manages to grab the roll with a laugh and breaks off a few squares, handing them to Sherlock, his eyes twinkling. Sherlock rolls his eyes again but it’s accompanied with a lopsided smile, and his eyes suddenly dart to John’s in a quick glance.
John murmurs, an uncontrollable steady stream of profanity pouring past his lips.
but that he would rather live with the pain himself than cause anymore hurt.
Rudy gives him an odd look. “That doesn’t sound very appealing.”
John's eyes snap open when the warmth air hovering over his mouth bypasses it completely and then Sherlock’s lips are resting on his neck. He feels the man inhale and a shot of electricity pangs through him straight to his crotch. John tilts his head to the side, allowing more access without any conscious thought. He waits. For what, he isn’t sure. Sherlock doesn’t move except to exhale in a sigh and slumps slightly. John raises his arms and hesitantly crosses them over Sherlock’s back. If it wasn’t for the strain in his trousers, the doctor would take this as nothing but an odd embrace.
“Apparently,” she shrugs, unconcerned.
The room is full of chattering people, and John hesitates at the smiling faces around them.
Sherlock doesn’t reply for a second before saying in a rush, “No, of course you can! That isn’t what I meant, not at all, I just wasn’t expecting you-But it’s fine! I mean, it’s nice to see you. I just…” he trails off, noticing he’s rambling and promptly snaps his jaw shut.
They sat in comfortable silence for a while before John let out a yawn and heaved himself up off the sofa. He looked down at Sherlock with a frown.
John knows, deep down, that his
Mycroft’s pajamas are soft and luxurious, and as Sherlock predicted they fit nicely at John’s shoulders and chest but are a bit long on the arms and legs.
John feels an odd mixture of amusement and guilt. The latter wins and he sighs. “I’m sorry I haven’t been round-”
happy then I rather suppose it would be hypocritical for me to scorn you in return.”
Mrs Jones looks doubtful, but to John’s surprise, she doesn’t push the point.
Thank you to everyone who liked, commented and expressed an interest in this!
John lets out a deep sigh, straightening his back on the wall to hear his spine crack.
his smile dimpling his cheeks.
“What’s going on between Sherlock and Alfie?” John demands in a low hiss.
The boy, who had been following John's gaze to Sherlock, looked quickly back to John and his eyes dropped to his mouth briefly.
“Did he smell of antiseptic?”
“You seem happy.”
They sit like that for a moment or two, until Sherlock’s arms finally give out from under him and he collapses backwards, falling into the sink and bashing his head onto the mirror with a loud thunk.
And Sherlock, jesus
“Hm,” Mycroft nods once, one side of his mouth quirking upwards for a second. “I place my trust at your door then, Doctor.”
Sherlock tilts his head to the side, allowing the ministrations as his hands tug the girl towards him by the waist of her skin-tight dress.
Sherlock sends him a quick side-look before returning his eyes back on the screen. “Teddy can do it quicker without me being in the way.”
But he does know one thing for sure, and that is that Mycroft Holmes loves his brother.
“You’re in Buchan Park,” the man explains patiently. “Do you remember how you got here?”
“Yeah. That.”
John almost doesn’t catch the murmur of Mrs Hudson as she passes Sherlock a cup of tea. John pretends he didn’t hear it, continues to wash up plates in the sink.
John turned his head and glowered at his friend, who was stood pressed up against the box full of sweets John was still holding between their bodies and scowling at it.
“Uncle Rudy, let us not delve into your dramatics this evening,” comes a low, exasperated voice from the door.
John ignores the insult, knows Mycroft well enough to spot an attempt at deflection with a well-timed barb. Sherlock does the same thing.
She had glared at each boy hiding in her shed, making them all shrink back from her eyes. Then had grasped Sherlock and John by the ears, snapped at Victor to follow, and marched them into her kitchen before shoving them down into seats and turned to switch on the kettle.
for christ sake. John had kissed nearly everyone in his friendship group at some point or other when he was that age.
The feet stop just shy of the doorway.
Sherlock stares straight ahead, unmoving.
home.”
“John Watson. My parents speak highly of you.”
“I honestly don’t understand how you can be so damn rude sometimes, my god how were you raised? Had everyone waiting on you hand and foot, did you?” Sherlock is beginning to frown a bit but John isn’t done, can’t seem to stop, “You can’t just go through life taking advantage of everyone and giving nothing back in return! Teddy is my friend, and I will not have you screwing him about just to get what you want! Grow up!” John manages to stop himself before he shouts anything more insane, but the damage is done. Sherlock stares at him for a second and opens his mouth to speak. John braces himself but then Sherlock closes it a moment later and, giving John a cold look, shoves himself up off the sofa and storms his way into his bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
John pants into Sherlock’s mouth, can’t form any other coherent words, not when Sherlock reaches down to grab his arse, pulling him in tighter.
“So, what were you two up to last night?” Victor asks knowingly, giving John a side-eyed look.
“Ah right,” John nods, self-preservation causing him to adopt an air of familiarity. What the hell is he doing in West Sussex? The last time he had been anywhere near Sussex had been that insane christmas with Sherlock’s parents. Where he had reconciled with Mary. It’s a painful memory and he pushes it from his mind. Another thought overtakes it. No, the last time he had been here was the night before last. And he had been down a well...
An old man is kneeling in soil a few feet away, staring with wide eyes as they run past him.
! I’m sorry but I’m not allowed to give you a refund on reduced items!”
“Hello, Mrs Jones.”
. John pinches the bridge of his nose.
John jerks slightly in surprise, tilting his head to the side automatically. Sherlock hums into his skin, licking delicately down to the base of his throat.
John, rather expecting this confrontation at some point, glances over his shoulder. “Do they? That’s good.”
“Because I was there and I saw the person hopping over the fence with my Baldwin. My eyesight isn’t what it was, but I could see clearly enough that it was someone much smaller than Sherlock’s lanky frame.” She takes a sip of tea.
He can hear Rudy singing loudly, presumably to Sherlock, and smiles a little to himself.
The second thing John sees is-
and rushing around the table to wrap her arms around the man.
“Yes, but now I’m dying,” comes the faint response next to John.
“Sheeerlooock...” comes a low sing-song voice from outside and Victor sucks in a tiny gasp.
“Are you okay?” He had asked in alarm, staring at Sherlock’s wide-eyed look of confusion.
“Hm,” Jules hums in suspicion. “Sound like a-like a...police.”
“Your dad’s watch?”
Wanting nothing more then to extract Sherlock from the pair, John swallows as Sherlock leans back into the new body, a blissful expression on his face as he reaches a hand behind him to pull the man closer by his hip. John slowly backs away, hands clenching and unclenching repeatedly. A sour taste has taken root in his mouth.
“Sherlo’k? May I come in?” The man had muttered, and Sherlock had shaken his head slowly, rolling it on the door from side to side, even though the man obviously couldn’t see him.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrow. “Nothin’,” He moves to sit up.
“Here,” Victor passes over a small wooden fork, unwrapping the paper digging in with gusto.
There is companionable silence as John finishes making the tea and Teddy waits until he is seated opposite before asking, “Mate, are you sure you’re okay? You seem…” He trails off, waving a vague hand in John’s direction, face drawn together.
“I’d much rather walk, if that’s alright with you.” Sherlock aims this at John.
John chuckles lightly at his expression, and Sherlock face turns a little affronted. It isn’t lost on John that this Sherlock has probably apologised more in one night than
Everyone expresses their thanks, digging in with vigor.
“Good, good.” John replies absently, pouring boiling water into the mugs.
John stops those thoughts quickly, cringing.
“Bad luck. And I’m afraid that’s only going to get worse,” Victor grimaces.
"Obvious, but what did she say?"
“This is Sherlock,” John explained, “My housemate. Sherlock, Teddy-“
“My poor ego,” John pouts, tilting his head down. His breath hitches when Sherlock’s eyes flick down to his lips.
grasp over his emotions, had picked himself up, stared down at his grazed hands where small dots of blood were oozing out of his skin, and had then proceeded to punch the boy in the face.
a murderer in this timeline.
John groans, covers his face with his hands.
After the horrific act, and the girl is send away, through his grief and terror and hurt, the brother grows to forget her and his friend. An act of subconscious self-preservation. Fascinating really, what the mind is capable of.
Rachel watches him go, her face twisted unattractively. She looks back at John. “How can you possibly-”
John lets out a bit of a hysterical laugh and leans his head back on the wall as he gets his breath back. He feels Sherlock shift next to him and glances over at his friend. Sherlock has his head tilted back also, his eyes closed and a small smile on his lips. There is a small but fairly deep cut on his cheekbone that John hadn't noticed before, an injury no doubt created by a flying piece of glass. Without thinking, John reaches up and swipes gently at the gathering blood with his thumb. Sherlock twitches slightly at the touch but otherwise doesn't move… until he mutters a second later, "I'm sure you're trying to help, but your sweat mingled with the dust has produced a rather intense sting."
He felt Sherlock roll over to face his turned back.
"Why? Can't you just go and read your little list? That makes it all better usually, doesn't it?" Sherlock sneers viciously.
“What did you take?”
John is rather surprised to hear this, feels the need to point out, “I’m not a doctor yet.”
John and Sherlock glance at each other before dissolving into a fit of laughter.
“Not at all,” John snorts, chuckling at the very notion.
John shrugs that he doesn’t know and doesn’t care.
“I’m glad you’ve established that,” Sherlock replies, turning to give John a strangely pointed look. John frowns in confusion as he follows his friend, ignoring the suspicious and bloodshot eyes that track him. He feels Rachel grip onto the back of his jacket as she shuffles in behind them.
Besides, does he even
Sherlock shoots him a look which is part amusement, part exasperation. “I wouldn’t murder you
“Oh.”
“Stop!
Of course, he is well aware that the entire situation could actually be deemed very simple if they only
“Teddy, this is Molly Hooper. Molly, Teddy Knowles,” Sherlock introduces, leaving her standing as he takes a seat next to John.
for you, so that you could
“Sherlock back yet?” Victor asks a few minutes later, ambling up to John with a paper package in his hand.
“Oh, okay,” John mutters in surprise, taking a hasty step backwards and searching for Sherlock’s face with his eyes.
"It's also a surprisingly effective stress relief." Teddy shrugs, throwing a look at Sherlock that John can only describe as
“You need to leave.” He bites out angrily.
“Good morning, Victor!” Sherlock announces loudly and the boy’s other arm comes up to wrap around his skull with a grunt.
Mrs Jones stands abruptly. “Oi! Watch my floor!” She marches over towards the sink.
“You almost did,” he had whispered.
“What on earth do you think you are doing?” Sherlock asked, sounding genuinely offended.
Mortified, John rushes over to take it back from her. “Jesus, Sherlock. Sorry, Mrs Holmes.”
John blinks, darts his eye up to Sherlock’s face. When their eyes meet, Sherlock shrugs again with utter nonchalance.
From John’s rather limited knowledge of party drugs, he is aware that MDMA usually releases an influx of endorphins, causing the user to have a heightened sense of empathy and emotion. This is usually paired with a sense of contentment, warmness and general happiness. Something John can see the appeal of, of course, but he’s seen enough teenagers being brought into A&E experiencing seizures and heart rate irregularities to know the risk just isn’t worth it.
“Home, home home,” Sherlock nods, gripping John’s hand tightly as he begins hauling himself to his feet.
John looks down at his peaceful face, young and smooth. His dark eyelashes cast a shadow across his cheekbones. John reaches out to brush the tips of his fingers against the silky skin, soft and warm. John allows the tips to wander across the bridge of his straight nose, down to the plump lips, parted slightly. Warm air puffs across his skin, and John absently strokes the bottom lip gently.
“Do it again.”
The old woman, who John imagines has a very warm face when she’s not scowling as she has been doing the last ten minutes, is a tiny force to be reckoned with. Turns out, she had all but dragged the thug from her garden, shoving him bodily over the fence and into the neighbouring garden, where he had promptly galloped away.
It’s not even a whisper, an exhale of breath at most, and John flutters his eyes open for a second to peek at Sherlock’s closed eyelids. He could have imagined the sound, the soft sigh from a dreaming mind.
“How should I know?” His voice is too casual to be complete truth, and John wouldn’t have picked up on it if he wasn’t actively observing him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock changed tactic, had sent him a charming smile. “I’m with someone, mate. He’s around here somewhere,” Sherlock made a show of glancing over the crowd.
John stares at him, unnerved. It’s like the past few moments never happened, Sherlock easily continuing their previous conversation.
The man didn’t even blink. “Nothing like a bit of healthy competition,” he had drawled, leaning forward to breathe stale breath across Sherlock’s face. “Come dance with me.” He took a quick step into Sherlock’s space, reaching behind him to grab a hand at Sherlock’s arse.
“Did he faint?” An unknown person asks loudly. Muttering breaks out around them, each asking similar questions.
John hadn’t said a word the entire taxi ride home, but his hand had gripped onto Sherlock’s knee possessively the whole journey back and Sherlock didn’t think anything could compare to the thrill he had experienced in that moment.
“Saw wha’ happen-happened with your boyfriend,” Jules mumbles, giving John an exaggerated grimace of sympathy.
“Wha-where-what?” John babbles, eyes flickering to left then right. He’s in a park. A young woman of a similar age is standing behind the man, biting her lip and alternating between staring at John and the man to his left.
“Sure, yeah I’ll just..” John trails off awkwardly, sliding off the bed. He turns back once he reaches the door. “I didn’t mean to pry, I’m sorry.”
Maybe it was the kiss. Maybe it was Teddy. He isn’t certain, but something has changed. A new clarity has settled into John and he doesn’t know what to do with it.
"What?"
The man leans down to whisper something in Sherlock’s ear, and Sherlock reaches backwards to cup the back of the blonde head in reply, tugging it closer to his skin. John turns swiftly, can’t stand to watch any longer, and stumbles towards the entrance of the club.
John rolls onto his back once more and lets out a slow exhale. Closes his eyes. Wishes, not for the first time but with far more feeling, that he could go back in time and change
The girl folds into Sherlock lewdly, pressing stained lips against his collarbone as heavily made-up eyes flick over to John with a triumphant look.
“Monday, yeah. The seventeenth.”
Sherlock blinked at the tone. “John-“
Sherlock nods distractedly as he pours milk into his mug.
“Open your eyes and I’ll rule out the hospital,” John says, holding out a hand to halt Toby’s struggle to retrieve his leg.
), and had parted ways in a club to watch the crowds without looking suspicious as a two-some.
Once John gets to his room, he’s suddenly rather relieved Sherlock kicked him out of his room as the day’s events catch up with him. Talking with Sherlock had distracted him marginally from the situation he’s found himself in, the utter insanity of it.
Come say hello to me on my tumblr! Or if you have any questions, I am more than happy to answer them.
John then noticed the small family watching them also. Sherlock deftly stepped back and towards them instead. The child’s parents began signing in unison, a perfect symmetry that John could only admire and Sherlock smiled at them with uncharacteristically warm eyes. Again, he spoke what he was signing as he replied, “You’re welcome. I’m glad he is safe.”
Much like his bedroom at Baker Street, Sherlock’s space is an organised accumulation of odd nik naks, books and trinkets. There’s a microscope and chemistry set on his desk under a window that overlooks the garden, and a distinct burn mark on the wooden floor that’s half-covered up with a rug. John spots his violin case propped up in one corner and, most curious of all, is the old wooden upright piano sitting next to it.
“What the hell happened?”
John can feel his face shuttering, and he moves backwards slightly. “What happened?”
“Thanks,” John says in wonder, can count on one hand the amount of times Sherlock has made him tea. He usually waits until John or Mrs Hudson passes him a mug.
Thank you again to everyone who commented, I get such a kick hearing from you all!
Sherlock nods once, then moves to close the door in John's face. John catches it before he can do so, and roughly pushes it open again.
John stares at them, baffled, as Rudy lets her go and pulls close another chair next to him. Eurus plops down with a grin and begins rattling off questions about life in London and whether he is still friends with Annie Lennox. John catches Sherlock’s eye with a frown, who leans over.
There was a pause where John simply watched him. "Right," he said eventually. John rolled over, giving Sherlock his back and closed his own eyes, done with the conversation and desperate for sleep knowing full well he wouldn't be getting any easy shut-eye until the case was over.
Sherlock steps away, glances at the laptop then back at John as he leans against the table watching John open the bottle and downing half its contents.
Sherlock’s breathing hitches suddenly, his eyes squeeze shut for a moment before forcing them open again.
“Yeah. Cool. So it was nice seeing you again,” John interrupts, moving to stand. Rachel reaches out and grabs his arm to stop him.
With that thought in mind, John reaches for Sherlock’s face again and slides his mouth against those
Teddy chuckles, “Yeah, they’ve got the two goons. Apparently they’ve been up to all sorts of trouble, and will definitely be going down regardless of my case. They want me to go in tomorrow to identify them, though.”
Father had a business partner come and stay with them over the summer to work on a project, the details not something Sherlock had paid much attention to.
“Oh, right. Yeah. I guess. Thanks again.”
“This is John,” Evie begins, plopping down in a seat and the rest follow suit, “We found him in the park. He got mugged and hit on the head and now he can’t remember what year it is.”
He’s always assumed Sherlock was more gay than straight, even though the man has never fully expressed otherwise. Never expressed anything of that matter at all, really, if you disregard the vague comments during their first dinner together at Angelo’s. But for some reason, John’s never been able to imagine Sherlock with a woman. Not even Irene Adler, regardless of what he’s said in the past. John remembers the awkward way Sherlock has stood, rigid, while Janine was kissing him. The sight then had made John squirm in discomfort, and does now too. No, Sherlock doesn’t suit being with a woman. John couldn’t coherently explain why, he just knows it.
so John prepares himself for a long night.
"No, it's fine." Sherlock pants wildly, his voice pitched higher than usual and his eyes staring at a fixated spot behind John's head.
John casts a look at Sherlock, who has adopted a rather content expression now the talk of hospitals has dispersed. He’s watching his hands as he runs his fingertips across the pads of his thumbs rhythmically, as if the sensation is new and riveting.
As John leaves the table, he can’t help but notice the way Eurus’ eyes follow her brother’s retreating back.
“I brought you some pajamas,” he begins, not meeting John’s eyes. “They’re Mycroft's. He’s taller than you but broader than me so..” Sherlock shrugs, holding out the bundle in front of him.
“Sher-” John tries again. Stops. The eyes, similar colour, different face. John shakes his head to clear away the blurry edges of his vision. The movement sends a sharp stab of pain behind his eyes.
Victor’s eyes narrow, but before he can say anything else Mrs Holmes enters the room again and immediately demands to know what’s happened to her table. When there’s only a reply of guilty silence, she throws a dish cloth at Sherlock and tells him to mop up the mess.
Teddy had startled, apparently having not noticed Sherlock’s huddled motionless form as a person when he had arrived. It was possible he had overlooked the bundle as a pile of pillows. He had stared at Sherlock for a moment, only his curly mop of hair and bright eyes were peeking out over the blanket.
Sherlock watches him with a scowl before realisation hits him. “
As I stated earlier, there will be an epilogue. I'm also working on another fic as we speak that I hope to start uploading soon-Hope to see some of you there if it floats your boat!
John has a passing thought of how differently things would have turned out if the two of them had decided to have a dance on his stag night, if it would have ended up like this. The two of them, drunk and mindless, rubbing against each other. Probably not, in hindsight. John has absolutely no idea if Sherlock even feels any sort of sexual attraction to John like
The blonde answers for her, “No. He was kinda drifting off for a few seconds before he fell, sort of stumbled down and I caught him.”
“Two, three hours?” Evie replies, glancing at her boyfriend in question who nods in agreement.
“Hm?”
John can't help but glance at Sherlock, and his breath hitches slightly at the look on his face. His eyes are staring darkly down at John’s, now empty, thigh. His full lips pinched into a straight line. Feeling John's gaze, he snaps his head back round to face the window to his right, effectively hiding his expression from the doctor. John can’t help but feel strangely smug and, feeling bold, he reaches out and squeezes Sherlock’s own thigh. The detective starts and spins his head back round so quickly his neck cracks. John is already looking pointedly away, his hand resting innocently back on his lap.
John blinks at it, squinting in the dark and willing his eyes to adjust.
“What?” John asks, leaning down a ear close to his mouth.
“Alright?” Sherlock whispered.
"Oh don't I? What do you think you're playing at? I need a drink-"
“I know where he is.” Sherlock announces, rising with a stretch and sounding bored.
"On top of the microwave," Sherlock explained impatiently.
John gives him a pointed look, wishing the man was the Myroft who
John looks back at him, takes a deep breath and reaches out a steady hand to cup Sherlock’s chin, pulling his mouth open to stop the gurning.
“Have you lead us here to murder us?” John asks his friend dryly.
and John gives them a sharp look, holding his hand up to stop them all from piling closer.
Sherlock had been frozen to the spot, heart thudding in his ears.
"Well maybe it's for the be-"
John turns his panicked expression to Sherlock, who stares back at him for a long moment before they both dissolve into silent laughter.
Sometimes, Sherlock would lean over John’s shoulder while he was tapping away at his blog, just to see how the man would react. Usually he would ignore him, or push him away when Sherlock said something derogatory about his writing. But once, Sherlock felt John’s face turn towards him and his breath danced across Sherlock’s cheek. John sat there, eyes flicking over the turned away features, and maybe he thought Sherlock didn’t notice, or maybe it was pointed, a silent hint. Sherlock kept his face looking ahead, then slightly tilted his head to the side to bare his neck and felt John’s breath hitch slightly. He bit back a smile and turned away.
John can feel his lungs burning with the need to suck in deeper breaths and he jerks suddenly when sharp teeth bite painfully down into his shoulder. Sherlock is crowding into him urgently now, fingers clawing desperately at the skin of John’s neck hard enough to make the man wince.
“This is our Uncle, Rudolph. Dad’s brother,” Sherlock explains.
John assesses the tall newcomer, not recognising him but finding little similarities in Sherlock’s face. Their mouths are the same, as is the shape of their noses yet the taller man’s is longer. His face is lined and jolly, wrinkles set deep in the corner of his eyes and mouth; visual evidence of someone who spends much of their time smiling and laughing. His hair is white and long, tied back into a careless bun that should look odd on an older man but somehow works. Maybe due to the colourful and rather bohemian way the man is dressed; the white shirt rolled up to his forearms with a colourful array of small flowers dotted around the material, the bright red woolen waistcoat and dark blue jeans tucked into tanned cowboy boots. His wrists jingle with golden bangles, almost every finger shining with a variety of expensive looking rings.
Warm arms suddenly circle John from behind and he almost drops the spoon in his hand.
“Don’t stop, just run!” Sherlock yells, shoving Victor upright as the fly down the street.
John looked back at the small boy and gave him an encouraging smile, couldn’t imagine the terror of becoming lost and not being able to use his voice to call for his parents and hear their reassuring reply.  The child only had eyes for Sherlock though, who turned back to him and this time translated what he was signing as he did so. “We want to help you find them, will you come with us?”
to you.” His eyes, a darker blue than his siblings, flick down John’s body as if trying to discover why that is.
"It's all about getting through the bone, John." Sherlock explains, prodding the dead pig with a finger as Teddy places the knife gently back on the table.
As Rudy starts up another story about a pirate ship he bought in Maine, her eyes drift to John’s elbow and he tenses.
“Jesus!” Victor yells, voice high in panic.
They had kissed. He had kissed Sherlock. He
“For god’s sake John, what
Sherlock reads something in his gaze and lets out a slow breath that dances over the doctor's face. His pale eyes glance down to John’s mouth momentarily and he sways forward slightly. John's heart picks up and he takes a step into Sherlock's space. Their chests brush.
A little flutter of butterflies in his stomach, an almost daily occurrence, John wonders if there will ever come a day where the sight of Sherlock doesn’t result in it.
“I need to see if you can,” John elaborates.
“Plus,” Rachel continues, voice pitching lower and less hysterical, “He didn't take anything with him. All his stuff is still at ours.”
John munches away, enjoying the vinegary lunch.
John’s lips twitched. "I'm sure it'll be fine."
“Fuck!”
"I never told Mrs Hudson to feed him," Sherlock said miserably, staring up into the darkness.
The voice returns, a bit impatient, “Yes?”
Sherlock dries his hands on the towel, glances up at John through the reflection of the mirror.
“What’s your name?” He asked instead, pulling at him again.
Sherlock’s hands still and he glances up at the lighter, following John’s gaze. He sits up fluidly, “Don’t know. It isn’t mine.” Sherlock plucks it from John’s fingers and leans over to place the object in his bedside drawer, closing it again with a snap.
“Uh, gruff? Common,” Teddy stopped, brown eyes squinting, “No wait, one had an accent. Polish I think.”
Jules focuses on his face again with difficulty, then elaborates. “A li’l ‘puff puff’,” he mimics taking two quick drags of his cigarette with a loopy smile, “Somet’mes a pill or two when it’s a birthday.” He shrugs.
The three boys blink. Then simultaneously let out a breath of relief, shoulders slumping. Sherlock lowers the wood.
John offers a forced smile instantly. “Yeah, course. Come in.”
“Uhuh,” Victor grins. “Break his heart, etcetera etcetera…”
John groans and shifts his weight. Is he on the floor? Must be. It’s too hard and his back is aching.
Mycroft smiles, slow and deliberately complaisant. “I’m sure.”
Neither John nor Sherlock give any sign that they’ve heard the man, so he twirls away with a shrug to pass the drinks around to the others.
“Sherlock.”
“No, no, you don’t understand. Killed him, I could have
“You’re a bit young to be a doctor, aren’t you?” Toby grins, eyebrows arched in disbelief.
Best not think about that now.
“You two do seem to manage to distract each other a fair bit.” John agrees in a mumble, crossing his arms. He knows he’s being childish. He doesn’t care.
“Is it paranoia?” John smiles to take the sting out of the words. “Or
Turns out, something could, because when they had got home, John had slammed the door shut, grabbed Sherlock’s face between his hands and pressed their foreheads together while hissing, “How dare he touch you, how
He feels betrayed regardless, is aware that the ache is unwarranted.
The milk is still on the unit and definitely inconsumable when John goes down in the morning.
“Wha-?”
“You’re late for work.”
since his miraculous return. Who came back different, yet the same and still made mistake after mistake. Who John can’t help but still be angry with. Sometimes livid.
“Honestly, John, I woke up like-”
Something prods his foot again. Not Rosie. John glances down. Another foot. John sits up suddenly in a panic.
"I don't like being reminded that
“Maybe he’s been mugged?” The girl offers, shifting her weight from one foot to the other.
John glances up from his plate as Mr Holmes tops up his glass without waiting for a reply.
John stops short. Turns back slowly. He tilts his head, regarding the intoxicated boy with barely suppressed rage, can feel his lips twisting upwards in a smile. Takes a step forwards.
“Looks like you missed your bus, again.”
“You have no idea what you’re doing to me,” John whispers in his ear, tightening his fingers into the soft skin of Sherlock’s back. Can feel the curve of an answering smile against his face.
Sherlock, anyway. Wonders what his take will be on this mad dream. Or hallucination. Whatever. Dreads the thought of the inevitable conversations they’re going to have to battle through come the morning.
When John glances at Sherlock, the detective's eyes are already trained on him, reading his expression. He quirks an eyebrow at the blonde and John shrugs slightly in response.
Sherlock has done in all the years they’ve known each other.
“Oh. Ha. Nice one. Cheers,” Jules sniggers, falling sideways onto the wall next to him and finally managing to spark up his lighter.
Sherlock gasps loudly, turning it into a spluttering cough, before standing abruptly with an announcement that he needs the loo and scampering out of the room.
John groans and covers his head with his arms. John has fantasised about kissing Sherlock before and it was always sweet and gentle, soft declarations and small smiles. Not the aggressive, desperate lunging that had actually happened. John was surprised at his behaviour, at how quickly his anger had turned into something else entirely. But the thing that surprises him the most was Sherlock’s reciprocation before he had pushed him away.
“He's gone!”
“What did they sound like?”
“Honestly, I don’t know why you young people feel the need to get yourselves into such a state everytime you go out,” Mrs Holmes is tutting, placing a mug next to Victor’s hand.
He tries to remember the last thing he was doing before he knocked himself unconscious. He has to choke back another hysterical laugh as he remembers desperately wishing he could do just this, go back in time and change the outcome of his and Sherlock’s life. This must be a manifestation of those thoughts, he thinks logically. He was wishing for the unattainable, then knocked himself unconscious. So, in conclusion: this is a dream. He glances around himself. An extremely vivid dream. That can only be it. Deciding to just ride it out, ignoring the voice in his head that is claiming otherwise, he forces himself to breathe calmly and enjoy the feeling of being twenty-three again. What was he doing when he was twenty-three? He would have, indeed, been a medical student. He vaguely remembers having a girlfriend who lived near Sussex. Maybe he was supposed to be visiting her. And somehow hit his head..in the park. This is insane. Besides, what’s the point of trying to rationalise a dream, anyway?
However, about once a year, Johns body seems to just give up and he will come down with the most horrendous case of flu. Usually, he can anticipate or even predict when this bout of illness will strike and will pop out to the nearest co-op to stock up on supplies such as soup, tissues, cough medicine, paracetamol and a hot water bottle to cuddle. He then takes it all home and waits for the demons to strike and spends the next week in bed alternating between looking after himself like the good doctor he is and feeling terribly sorry for himself.
“Sherlock.”
John opens his mouth to begin but is interrupted.
“Afternoon!” John nods at him, hears Sherlock’s bark of laughter in front of him.
“Not you, you can keep me company while I finish my tea.”
John lets out a nervous laugh, “I don't even know where
Just then, another body staggers out of the club, where the pounding music has started up again.
, is so good with Rosie. A natural. Wouldn’t have thought it. Parenting suits him. But then again, Sherlock does have that annoying habit of being good at everything. And Rosie, she adores him. Pulls at his curls and giggles when he pulls a face and pretends it hurts. And that hurts John too, fills him with dread because if his daughter loves Sherlock even half as much as he does, then one day she might also feel this awful, hideous pain John has been living with since the man jumped from that hospital roof.
“Come along!” Sherlock orders cheerfully, all but skipping to the front door.
Silence.
He leaves the lamp on for the rest of the night.
Thank you so much for all your comments, it gives me such a thrill to hear all your predictions and thoughts!
“How is it you knew him?” Rachel asks suddenly. John looks up and she has a hard look on her face as she stares at Sherlock.
“I love you, Redbeard,” Sherlock had said clearly and honestly.
“No, that’s fine. Happens all the time. He just need to go home and rest,” John declares, giving the man a nod and pointedly not looking over at Victor and the others who luckily all keep their mouths shut.
Sherlock spins round from the window, gives his brother a hooded look.
"John," Sherlock starts, his breath still coming out in harsh gulps but John doesn't wait around to hear what he has to say and bolts from the room, slamming the door open and sprinting up the stairs into his room.
John sees red and the next thing he knows, Sherlock's head has snapped to the side from a sharp shot to his cheek.
I shall think about this every night for a week at the very least!”
“Must extend my gratitude towards those thugs too, of course,” Teddy smirks, “Otherwise I would never have met
"And that you didn't forget the milk."
Smiling to himself, John pads quietly over to the door to one of the downstairs loos. He waits patiently outside for a few moments before the lock clicks and he grabs the handle and swings inside.
“Thank you,” John says sincerely. Looks back at the auburn haired boy again. “Sorry, what did you say your name was?”
“Prob’bly for the best,” Jules pats him on the arm, misinterpreting his humourless snort.
Thank you all who left kudo's and commented! Angels!
“I wanted to thank you again,” Teddy starts, “Without you those thugs wouldn’t be getting what they deserve. And I wouldn’t have my dad’s watch back.” He glances at his wrist, eyes shining in gratitude.
A second later, Sherlock’s door is roughly pulled open again and John snaps his head up. Sherlock doesn’t even look his way as he stomps determinedly into the kitchen, grabs a frozen and staring Teddy by the wrist and drags him back into his room, door slamming once again.
John half expects Sherlock to emerge from his room once he hears the front door close, as he is accustomed to do when visitors he has spent the day avoiding finally leave. The door stays firmly shut, however, and John hovers outside it for a moment. He knows he should apologise, but something makes him turn away.
“Then there’s Eurus, our youngest,” Mrs Holmes continues. She doesn’t say anything else and goes back to eating.
John exhales slowly, nodding. He knows this. “Everything is so fucked. I don’t know what to do.” John confides tiredly. Teddy is unwavering.
“I don’t like how he’s looking at you. No, I’m not jealous.”
The realisation of what just happened hits John like a train and he stares at his friend in terror. Fuck.
“No that’s not-there’s something
“Good night last night?” A smile of straight white teeth.
“Let go,” Sherlock had snapped, irritated, and tried to wrench his hand away. The man held on with disconcerting strength, tightening his grip painfully.
They never did get to investigate where Luke Ford was, because the next day Sherlock punched a customer in the face.
That he knows of, anyway. He forcibly pushes that thought aside.
“Cheers.”
The woman doesn’t seem to care. “Like hell it doesn’t, get out of my garden!”
“I’m entering the shed...now,” the feminine voice drones before a grey head pops around the doorframe. Brown eyes, hooded with wrinkles, assess the room and flick between the three boys with an unimpressed look. They rest on Sherlock and the rest of the woman appears, arms folded across her chest.
John jumps up to follow, grateful to be leaving the room.
"Well I couldn't very well just leave him there." The blanket cocoon shifted with what John guessed was a shrug.
Mycroft had, surprisingly, taken the main brunt of the blame when it came to deceiving his parents about the death of his sister all those years ago, but John had found that rather ridiculous in hindsight considering he would have only been about thirteen at the time. Sure, it can be presumed that Mycroft was as cold, calculating and clever as a young teenager as he is now, and John wouldn’t doubt that at all if he hadn’t gone through hours and
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to meet John’s and he shrugged, “I like creating suspense.”
Once in his room, he changes slowly into his pajamas, thinking he would really like to take a shower but decides to hold off until the morning. He would rather keep Sherlock supervised for as long as possible.
“Uncle Rudy is incredibly wealthy and incredibly generous,” he breathes, lips brushing the shell of John’s ear.
Sherlock shoots him a venomous look that startles John. He hadn’t meant the comment as a dig, but Sherlock seems to have taken it as such regardless.
"Is he-" John began to ask, but the man already understood.
“Have you put something in the tea?” John demands bluntly.
She accepts it with a frown. “Do you have anything stronger?”
After a moment, John asks, “Sorry, who are you?”
of all people insulting him in
After Teddy had left, John had emerged from his room an hour later. Sherlock had been in the living room, curled up in his chair and reading a book. He hadn’t acknowledge the doctor. It had been tense, both following each other’s movements in the corner of their eyes but not saying a word. John had made tea, placing a mug next to the brunette, a silent peace offering. Sherlock didn’t touch it, left it to go cold. In the end, he had retreated into his room, and the chance of reconciliation had passed.
“No, low blood sugar,” John rushes to say, giving Sherlock a quick once over before reaching for his icy hands.
He cuts himself off as Sherlock takes another step forwards, his shins brushing against John’s knees. John’s breath hitches slightly and he moves the laptop onto the cushion next to him automatically. Sherlock steps immediately forward again, giving the seated man no choice but to spread his thighs to allow the detective to settle between them.
"What are you doing?"
Victor details his night out as they eat, claiming Jules was well behaved and only threw up once. He then vents for a while about public indecency, describing how inappropriate Toby and Evie’s
their erections line up perfectly. John grinds forwards, reaching one hand up to grip the back of Sherlock’s neck and tug him down to press their lips together again.
"Sherlock was just showing me the most effective way to stab someone."
“Goodnight, John.”
John doesn't really know what to say to that so he just smiles a bit tightly and reaches down to pat her hand twice, using the gesture as an excuse to gently brush it away from his thigh. Taking the hint, she folds it back onto her lap.
Sherlock turns towards him. "I told you, you'll see."
“Either of you lovebirds want a drink?” Jules suddenly shouts as he appears to the left of them, hands full of bottles. The boy seems to be in a much chipper and generous mood than usual, probably because Sherlock has hardly paid Victor any attention all night.
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
John smiles softly back. “Hello. You alright?” It’s a stupid question, they both know it.
Sherlock maintains the eye contact for an impressive four seconds before he, too, lowers his gaze with a slight grimace.
A slow gradual smile tilts Sherlock’s lips, and John’s eyes are drawn to them as a hazy image of fingertips softly brushing that mouth fills his mind. A bit embarrassed, he quickly looks away.
Victor hisses quietly, noticing their silent exchange.
"I'm trying to apologise here!" He snaps.
Sherlock wines, canting his erection forward into John’s hip.
"Erm," John backs up another step, at a complete loss.
” Sherlock sings briefly in a deep voice, stretching his arms above his head as he lifts himself up on his tiptoes.
“So you’re the same as him?” She asks viciously. “A junkie?”
“Anyone got any chewing gum?”
“Sherlock, try and open your eyes for me. Toby go!” John orders.
John frowns. “How do you know it wasn’t Sherlock?”
Sherlock gives John an impish grin and places the mug back down, leaning on the unit and mirroring John’s stance opposite him. “Calm down John, I’m only teasing.”
“You look happy.”
“No, it’s fine, I mean, they are-” John begins, cutting himself off when his face is captured by two warm palms and he finds himself staring up in bewilderment into two watery eyes.
When they had got home, the row had been spectacular. Sherlock screaming that he
John takes a deep breath. “And I’m going to assume you can’t give them back because you’ve used them?”
“NOW!”
John casts his eyes back over to Eurus, who is laughing prettily at her Uncle’s antics with a hand on his arm. John scoffs, turning back and starts when he notices Sherlock hasn’t moved away and his eyes are trained on John’s mouth.
Then, a memory from a few months ago:
“Don’t be like that,” the man had slurred, snatched Sherlock’s wrist when he had turned to move away. “You
“Oi, is he on something?” the man points at John in accusation.
Sherlock is standing there, looking a bit uncomfortable and holding a small bundle in both hands.
John shakes his head and climbs the stairs back to his room. This time, he falls straight to sleep as soon as his head touches the pillow.
“Huh? Oh, yeah. I mean, we all do,” Jules laughs, blowing smoke into the air with a stagger.
. But he can’t help but think how Sherlock, once again,
Because that look,
The night did have some true highlights that still make John chuckle now: dragging a petulant Sherlock away from a fight about ash of all things, stumbling down the street arm in arm and singing an old folk song they somehow both knew the words to, Sherlock’s baffled expression when a young man asked him to dance approximately two seconds before they realised they were in a gay bar, then the young man’s baffled face when John had grabbed Sherlock’s arm and tugged him abruptly away, Sherlock slurring about something or other while their bodies pressed warmly together on the foot of the stairs, Sherlock’s softly lit face smiling across at John from his chair with his own name framed by his curly fringe on his forehead, Sherlock shouting at a stranger to not contaminate the crime scene before throwing up all over the carpet, giggling helplessly as Greg shoved them both into the back of his police car... All distorted memories, one overtaking the other like a badly edited film.
Sherlock sighs, looking oddly relieved. “Ah yes, she..does that.” He glances towards the door.
John spins around, spotting Sherlock leaning against his closed bedroom door. John absently gets a sense of déjà vu as he wonders if Sherlock has been standing there the entire time, listening to everything, but the thought is overshadowed by a wave of
“Gaspard Dubois! My old nemesis!” Rudy cries, raising his fists in front of if him like a victorian bare-knuckle boxer.
“Goodnight John.” Sherlock dismisses, not looking at his friend.
John shoves it back open and forces himself into Sherlock's room so he can't shut him out.
Sherlock. God. What a mess. John rubs his hands rigorously across his face, fingers digging into his eye sockets. Flashes of the lithe man crawling into John’s lap flickered in the darkness of his lids and the doctor feels a stir in his gut. He rubs his eyes harder to dissolve the image. It is then overtaken by the small, vulnerable expression on his friends face just before he had turned and fled to his room for the night. John sighs and lets his hands drop with a slap onto his mattress.
John hadn’t allowed himself the luxury of indulging his need to read the list again. He felt out of place, adrift, not knowing what to do or what was acceptable. It hasn’t helped that Sherlock hasn’t had one case during this time. It especially hasn’t helped that Sherlock hasn’t delved into a usual and expected sulk. Two weeks is a long time for the man to go unentertained, but he hasn’t snapped once. Hasn’t even glared or huffed. He is the epitome of politeness and it is unnerving. John has no idea how to act around the man. Every morning he will go downstairs and Sherlock is either up already and immaculately dressed, making tea for the two of them, or will appear within the hour. Immaculately dressed and making tea for the two of them.
The three boys stand quickly, but a wrinkled hand reaches out to grab John’s arm.
“You do, don't you.” Sherlock murmurs at last, lips barely moving.
In one universe, thirty-three years ago, a young girl constructed by the power of nature rather than nurture, full of cold hate and jealousy and nothing much else, decides one day to kill her favourite brothers best friend. In a rather twisted bid to win her brother’s affection and attention, she pushes the small boy down a well, where the child tragically drowns.
John shakes his head distractedly. “Eurus.”
John is shoving past the boy before he’s even finished his sentence, a low buzzing in his ears as he forces his way through the crowd.
“Sherlock..” John tries to tug his head away, an impossible feat when those long fingers tighten brutally.
, Sherlock!”
John moves around them to spot a bloodied slab of some animal or other. "Was he."
John’s eyebrows crease together as he watches his usually eloquent friend stumble over his words. Sherlock doesn’t meet his eyes. John lowers his again and continues his task before noticing something on the back of Sherlock’s hand.
“So, you think he took the blame?” John clarifies, eyes flicking over to Sherlock, who is whipping Victor’s bum with a tea towel as the other boy attempts to jump out of the way without spilling water all over the floor. He aims a kick at Sherlock, who side-steps it with a laugh.
Sherlock nods numbly and follows John onto to cushions. They settle next to each other, not quite touching but close enough that they would brush if one of them shifted. John puts on some sort of mundane talk show, not paying much attention. Sherlock is sitting ramrod straight beside him, but after some time, he slowly relaxes.
but the angle is wrong, John wants to
Sherlock is laying on top of him, head nestled under John’s chin, his long arms wrapped around the strong torso, the small of his back pale where his shirt has risen up.
John stares at the two of them.
Sometimes, Sherlock would find himself staring at John from across the room, eyes drawn to him like a beacon of light. The sun would filter through the room and bleach John’s hair, or the moonlight would transform it to a glittering brown. Sherlock would stare and stare at him, and his pulse would race in the strangest way, and when John glanced up he would look away quickly.
John scowls, turns to move away. “Yeah, I’ve heard
Both John and Sherlock had sniggered into the accompanying silence, quite a number of glasses of wine under their belts at this point, and Alfie had blinked across the room at them as if noticing them all for the first time.
“Don’t be silly, it’s no bother. I’m just glad you weren’t too hurt. How’s the head?” John asked, looking at the dried blood on his temple in concern.
John pushes writhing bodies out of his way without a care, ignoring the splutters and curses in his wake. It doesn’t take long to find the others, a small ring parting the crowd in the middle of the dance floor, all looking down with worried expressions.
“What are you doing?” John asks softly, stepping into the room. He feels like the space is in a state of delicate calmness, the darkness and the small lights creating an intimate atmosphere he doesn’t want to break. He sits down on the floor opposite Sherlock, mimicking his pose.
John can’t tear his eyes away from the crouching form of Sherlock, who is inspecting a broken vase on the floor on the other side of the room. He can feel a stupid smile on his face, doesn’t even try and stop it.
“If anyone is holding a weapon, I would advise you drop it as I don’t fancy getting hit in the face.”
And when John leaned over his shoulder to read an article on Sherlock’s laptop, Sherlock turned his head fully to stare at the side of his face. John glanced at him, smiled softly, then wandered away.
“Vibrating,” Sherlock sounds the word out slowly, enunciating every syllable with delicate care.
"Let's just leave it yeah? I'm not-not now." John let's out a huff of air and tries his hardest not to slam his beer down on the counter next to him.
They break through the staring crowd and Sherlock pitches to the right suddenly, down a thin alleyway. Without stopping, he lunges at a low wall, planting a hand on the brick and swinging himself over the top and dropping back down on the other side.
John watches in amazement as Sherlock’s arms slide away from John’s body and raise into the air above his head, tilting his face back and bearing his long throat as if sensing John’s previous longing. His arms twirl elegantly above him, a blissful smile on his upturned face, body meeting every beat with effortless grace. John stares at him, can’t help but slide his hands up under Sherlock’s shirt and across his back to feel the damp skin, too-hot but erupting in goosebumps under John’s fingertips.
God, he was actually hurt? Hurt more by Sherlock’s obvious need for drugs (which doesn’t even seem particularly fair in hindsight as
John snaps his head round as Sherlock lets out a quiet groan.
John tunes out the shaking brunette girl who had stolen Sherlock away from him not ten minutes before, brushes past her without a glance as he dives past the frozen bodies.
Sherlock grins. “Good.” Then leans forward to press his lips against John’s neck.
“Me too.”
Victor stares up at her as if she’s demented then stuffs a forkful of cake into his mouth to stop himself blurting out anything else, probably that exact thought. John sniggers.
“Something was keeping me up.” Sherlock steps into the room, stopping just shy of John’s knees where he is sat on the sofa.
When they all turn away so mutter amongst themselves, John turns back to Sherlock.
Sherlock glances over his shoulder. “Because she didn’t want me to.”
“You’re studying to be a doctor, you mean?” Evie asks after a moment.
“Ah, I see.”
“Sherlock!” Mrs Holmes scolds, shooting him a dark look.
“Alright, there?” The man’s hands are resting securely on his biceps.
“Jesus, how are you doing that?” John asks in awe, it’s a pose he’s often seen dancers or gymnasts do, and although he knows Sherlock is fairly flexible; this is just ridiculous.
Sherlock looks affronted and surprised by the question, as if he
need to be reminded!" Sherlock shouts, trying to yank his wrist out of John's grasp. John tightens his hold automatically, surprised.
John looks back at Victor, shrugs, twists into the opposite direction and begins running in the opposite direction.
Rachel gives him a beseeching look but rises from the sofa. “John can’t you see-”
Sherlock doesn’t even glance in his direction. “I want coffee.”
John slips from his bed, drags on some clothes and makes his way downstairs.
Slender hands fall to fumble at John’s belt, unfastening it with impressive speediness, and John sucks in a short breath. His button and zipper are open a second later and a warm palm slides into his trousers and-
And when Sherlock had voiced
Sherlock paces into the middle of his room, shaking out his limbs and chewing frenziedly at the minty gum Evie had found in the bottom of her bag.
Sparks fly across John’s vision, and when his hand has stilled and all he can hear is the panting of his own breath, he realises that he has slumped forward and is resting his head against Sherlock’s chest.
“You do know there is CCTV back here right?” John asked, stepping around his friend to grab a box of sweets.
Sherlock rolls his eyes a bit manically and gives John a scathing look. “I’m under the influence, what do you expect? Just tell me you’re not angry with me. Even if you are. But make it convincing because I’ll be able to tell.”
“Oh, for-”
“How the hell has no one made that connection?” John demanded, unconvinced the police could be so dense.
Sherlock squirms in the hug, face a little flushed, but he’s grinning widely and squeezes the man’s forearms affectionately when he is put back down.
into a nice cup of
Debating whether or not to simply give up and go downstairs to watch telly, John fumbles for his phone on his bedside table. The bright backlight makes him wince as he hastily dims it. Nothing. No new messages, no new emails. Although it would be silly to assume there would be anything considering it was about half two in the morning. Sighing, John slips out of bed and tiptoes down the stairs, not wanting to wake Sherlock who really doesn’t sleep enough as it is.
When Sherlock doesn't turn his head to acknowledge the glare, John inflicts the heat onto the window instead, trying to piece together where they are heading. He's both relieved and a bit disappointed to note they are heading in the opposite direction to Rachel's house.
Sherlock gives away nothing in his expression as he glances up from his phone. He takes a moment to reply, “We used to frequent the same circles.” He mutters vaguely.
When Mycroft tried to come into his room, Sherlock had thrown a book at his big fat head and screamed at him to ‘
Sherlock thinks about Enzo, with his charming smiles, delicate touches and soft words. The infatuation that caused him such heartbreak, caused him to smother any and all romantic feelings for so many years. He wonders what he’s doing now, if he’s married and happy. If he ever thinks about Sherlock, the young teenager who had fallen in love with him and he had rightly rejected with such care and compassion. Thinks about how the man who had told him to stop punishing himself for
The woman drops into the chair at the head of the table and surveys the boys steadily, one after the other.
And the second;
“What’s that, Sherlock?” Rudy asks, glancing over at them with a questioning look.
Their hands grope frantically, tugging up shirts and grasping at flesh. They writhe against each other and John grabs Sherlock's hair, tugging his head back and exposing his long neck. He follows the movement with his head, biting down on the soft flesh and leaving hot wet marks on his skin. Sherlock pants above him, gripping John's waist hard before wrenching his head down and capturing his lips again. John bites at his lips instead, sliding a leg between the taller man's and he hears Sherlock gasp, his long hands sliding up John's back.
were together.
“So, is it just the three of you? Oh no, wait, you mentioned a Mycroft earlier?” John asks, knowing the answer of course but fishing for more information on the Holmes’ family dynamic in this world.
John has heard of Uncle Rudy only a handful of times, mainly during conversations (arguments) between Sherlock and Mycroft. From what he could gather; both brothers were close to the man, he was a cross-dresser, and he was the one who ultimately decided to send Eurus away to Sherrinford after burning down the family home.
the whole affair is, his parents humouring him slightly with obviously put-on expressions of sympathy.
“What on earth?” Victor mutters in bewilderment, chip hanging from his mouth.
this Mycroft feel the need to keep an eye on his little brother? After all, wasn’t it Sherlock’s forgotten memory of Eurus and his fabrication of Victor the primary reason behind the eldest sibling’s concern? John doesn’t know; feels like there is far more things to be concerned about when it comes to Sherlock, in this world
Teddy has taken it upon himself to ‘pop round’ every day since his surprise visit three days prior. John had let the man stand shaking on their doorstep for thirty surprised seconds before ushering him inside. John had then shoved the incoherent man into his arm chair and pushed a hot cup of tea into his trembling hands. Sherlock, sulking from the rude awakening had sat scowling at Teddy on the sofa, wrapped tightly in the blanket John had draped over him not five minutes before. John sat in Sherlock’s chair and Teddy began explaining how he had just been attacked a few streets away, jumped in an alley by a couple of thugs who had stolen his wallet, phone and watch.
Sherlock. The one who really needs to hear it.
John responds with a venomous glare and she starts slightly before hurriedly groping in her jeans pocket for her phone. “But I do have a few pictures of him on my phone.” Her tone is carefully level while her thumbs fly over the screen before placing it in the man’s still-outstretched hand.
“Substitute buses,” Sherlock replies promptly, tracing one lithe index finger in the spilt tea to make a pattern.
“Christ, be careful,” John mutters, suitably impressed. Sherlock’s trembling has definitely decreased, the stretches and casual exercise loosening his cramped muscles.
He’s quite obviously still under the influence of whatever he’s taken, pupils still dilated and speech a little slurred.
After that, Sherlock took residence up in his room, not leaving for many days, the space becoming a haven he preferred over possible knowing looks across the dinner table. Concerned, his parents tried to coax him out with offers to day trips to London, or with his favourite food, or, once, with a threat to invite Mycroft over for the weekend.
“This way!” Sherlock interrupts, playing a rather twisted tour guide as he bounds up the stairs, leaping fluidly over missing boards with practiced ease. “Watch your step now.”
John doesn’t even want to
“I’m not trying to drug you, John. What would be the point? You’re already in my house.” Sherlock grins, excessively wide and full of teeth.
Mycroft steps leisurely over to him, letting the door swing shut behind him. “Hm. I hear Sherlock in particular has formed some sort of...
“Can’t deny that,” John huffs a laugh. “And I suppose I’m also stuck in this orbit?”
“Have you ever visited the Cutty Sark, John?” Eurus asks suddenly, head titled in his direction with a pleasant look.
John sucks in a great lungful of fresh air, padding back over to the wooden railing and resting his hands on it, trailing his fingertips over the flaking paint.
"No, stay here." John murmured quietly, well aware that it wouldn't be a good idea if the child looked up and saw two large men approaching him while backed into a corner. "Hey," John called softly. "Are you alright?"
John shakes himself and stands. “Of course. Sherlock will be pleased to see you once more before you go.”
“You will not!” John snaps, anger flooding him unexpectedly.
Considering his skin feels like ice, John decides listening to anything Sherlock says is a moot point and forces Sherlock’s long limbs into the arms of the shirt. As they’re struggling with the garment, Toby, Victor, Evie and Jules all stumble out of the club and make their way towards them with concerned looks.
Suddenly, a hand snatches the remote out of his and the sofa dips as a body settles next to him. John frowns at Sherlock, who is now flicking through the channels at lightning speed.
John blinks, confused for a second before remembering his excuse for leaving Victor’s house early last night. “What? Oh yes. Much. Ta.”
John clenches his jaw and looks down at his hands gripping his mug. Teddy slowly walks back to the table, sensing the tension, and sits. He give John a pointed look, eyes narrowed but John doesn’t meet it.
you would be lurking around here somewhere,” Sherlock mutters with bad grace.
“That’s because I am,” Sherlock shrugs, a hint of triumph in his tone. Like happiness is a competition.
Sherlock’s mother had arrived home not long after Sherlock had showed John where he would be sleeping tonight. The house, if you can even call it that, seems to have endless floors. Sherlock had given him a brief tour, the ground floor consisting of the spacious living room, a long dining room with a huge formal table, a drawing room with a door leading to a sparse area that looked like it was once used as a small ballroom. The house is ancient, passed down the Holmes line for a great many years. John is rather interested in the history of it, but when he had asked Sherlock about it, the tall man had replied he couldn’t remember in a tone of such disinterest that John suspects he had deleted the information a long time ago.
"That's his name. John." Sherlock didn't take his eyes away from the child's face as he pointed towards the doctor, his fingers flying around his face and John recognised the errant hair gesture again. The boy then turned his grin towards John instead and began signing in earnest. Sherlock raised a hand and the boy stopped, Sherlock shook his head as his hands twirled around each other and the boy glanced at John a bit sadly before turning his full attention back to the detective.
reminded John of his own late grandmother. So once Sherlock grabbed her thin shoulders and proceeded to yell into her stricken, tear streaked face, John had lost it. He had marched towards Sherlock, grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and proceeded to forcibly drag him away while the man himself spluttered in indignation. As they passed Lestrade, the silver haired man had muttered; "Not on Sherlock. Keep a tighter leash on him will you John? Maybe a muzzle too."
But it hasn’t been like that for a while. A long time. Since Sherlock came back, to be honest. They tried to get back there, to the relationship they had before and it was almost accomplished. But it hadn’t been the same.
“What a strange night,” Sherlock comments lightly.
John stares at him, taken aback. “I didn’t mean-”
John huffs out an irritated gush of air.
He stops a foot away, takes a deep breath, before turning back to Jules with a cold smile, leaning in close.
The time in the well, that fear of death had hit him harder than ever before. Harder than any other mad situation he found himself in. Harder than when he was laying in hot sand with a bullet in his shoulder. The fear of a father leaving behind an orphan. The fear of Sherlock being killed by the suppressed trauma of his past.
Somewhere during the evening, Ms Bennet had decided to forgo making a large dinner and had laid out plates and bowls of nibbles and dips across the table. John was secretly relieved about that, as it allowed the atmosphere to continue with its easy informality and thus allowed him to continue to ignore everyone else in the room but his two companions without seeming rude.
John takes a small step forward, intending to drag Sherlock away from the girl and out of the club when a thin man, taller than Sherlock with bleached white hair, saunters over and gives the dancing pair a considering look. John tenses, wondering if it’s the girl’s boyfriend, but she casts a sly smile over to the man and then he is pressing up against Sherlock’s back, running his hands down his sides and grinding his crotch into Sherlock’s arse.
“He is,” John murmurs, knows this far too well.
“A bit,” Sherlock replies, plopping down on his bed and resting his feet up high on the wall above him. John considers his upside down head, mystified by the modesty.
From the corner of his eye he spies Sherlock letting out a silent breath of relief, shoulders slumping marginally.
There’s a distinct sound of shuffling feet outside, and John feels Sherlock tense against him. John darts a look around the shed, noticing an axe. He nudges Sherlock’s ribs and the boy looks at him. He nods towards the axe with a questioning look, and Sherlock follows his eyes. He looks back at John with a considering expression.
…different.”
The sound of his voice seems to cause an electric effect on the man, and Sherlock jumps up suddenly. John feels cold without the heat of the other body pressed against him and he snatches Sherlock’s wrists in a firm grasp without thinking. The man pauses in his retreat.
“What-?” Victor starts.
To Sherlock’s credit, he didn’t stumble or mutter anything too odd as they make their way slowly outside, eyes drawn down to his feet in concentration as the crowd parts to let them through. Once outside, however, he turns his head over towards John and says, “Did I fall over?”
When John doesn’t continue, feeling a bit like a coward, Sherlock glances over his shoulder at him expectedly.
I am disgusted,” Sherlock sniffs at them.
“Poor you,” Sherlock says without sympathy.
“What did you do?”
“A misunderstanding, and because my brother got involved.”
“No. I tried explaining it to the police, but they seemed pretty set on his guilt. Partly evidence, partly due to his previous convictions, and partly because the idiot boy made a thoughtless comment about an affair one of them was having with a babysitter.” She rolls her eyes.
” John stops himself from finishing his sentence, but Mycroft turns to give him a penerative look anyway.
, has fucked up his life so completely. By simply existing. By being there and always damn
"What happened?" Sherlock asks, watching him neutrally.
“You must be Eurus,” John quips back, wondering who told her about him and extending a polite hand for her to shake, silently hoping his palm is dry. She takes his hand in a firm grip, glances down at it after a second and looks back up at him through dark lashes, a lazy smirk stretching across her face. John takes his hand back as casually as he can.
“I tried that last night!” John exclaims, frustrated. He stops and tries to lower his voice again. “But he was already so angry with me then and now…” John scrubs a hand over his face.
Sherlock’s sentence is cut off, for as he speaks his fingers knead into the muscles of the neck under his fingertips, causing a sharp pang to shoot through John, and then the older man can’t stop himself from leaning down the rest of the way and capturing those smirking lips with his own.
“Oh, okay.” Sherlock nods indulgently. John bites the inside of his cheek to stop a completely inappropriate smirk from evolving when the pale eyes flick to his for a second.
John sheds his coat and throws it in the direction of the coat stand once inside and makes a beeline for his laptop which (isn't where he left it) is on the kitchen table. He roughly opens it and punches on the power button, scowling.
So he had slept in his old room, and it hadn’t felt like this, then. Because he had known, deep down, that he wouldn’t be staying.
“Shall we try and call a taxi or something?” Victor asks, watching Sherlock with a pained expression.
This chapter killed me, I'm still not 100% satisfied with it but I had to upload it before I just went and deleted the whole damn thing.
“Sherlock, I need to know what you took earlier. Or what you
Sherlock is still watching him with that blank intensity. He leans his face forward. John’s eyes flutter as warm, minty breath hits his face and he can’t help but tilt his own head upwards slightly.
money than they originally asked for, and now they might not be up and running until the end of the week. It’s ridiculous, I don’t know how anyone is getting to work!”
“Sherlock’s collapsed.”
“Exactly.” Sherlock grinned. John smiled up at him for a moment before frowning.
“John! Why are-wait,” Victor looks between John and Sherlock, then the door. He raises an eyebrow and a slow smirk tilts his lips.
“You’re right John, I can’t urinate!” Sherlock shouts too-loud from the bathroom.
“What’s this, then?” She looks down at the pile, frowning.
“Is that wine I spy, Emelia?” Rudy cries, diving over towards her with a hand outstretched.
John stares out over the garden, wondering on Mycroft’s blind trust and if it’s genuine or some sort of test.
“Just-for helping. For not turning me away after…” she trails off and looks at John a little imploringly.
“John hit his head about a week ago, bless him, and it caused a bout of amnesia. He’s staying with us over the summer before heading back to university in London. Our Sherlock has been looking after him while he finds his feet,” Mr Holmes supplies, casting a fond look over to his son and John.
In the end, it was Enzo who got Sherlock to end his week-long isolation. He knocked on the door and Sherlock, thinking it was Mycroft yet again, had shouted
"This can't be safe." John protests, gesturing vaguely at the wrecking ball a few houses down.
But maybe he hadn’t after all.
John does the same, casting an eye at the state of their shirts and pulling a face.
Then,
Now John is imagining just that and he rubs his fingers hard into his eye sockets to get rid of the imagine.
Sherlock lets out a shaky exhale, eyes fixed firmly on rim of his glass, and he shifts his thighs wider a fraction. John bites hard at the inside of his cheek, reaching for his own glass with his free hand, fingers impossibly steady.
Eurus is now giving Sherlock a dark look while he gazes impassively back at her. She turns away in disgust and fixes an overly-friendly grin to Victor who pales considerably.
“Really?” the boy perks up, looking at John from over his menu with renowned interest. “I’m Victor.”
“Sherlock! The man of the hour!” Teddy grins and rises from his chair, advancing on the man with wide arms. Just as he gets close enough to touch the detective, he stops. “What happened to your cheek?” Sherlock frowns in confusion before comprehension passes over his face and his eyes flick instantly to John’s before snapping back to the blonde man in front of him. The movement is so quick, but Teddy notices it. John winces, noticing the dark smudge on his friend’s cheekbone. Teddy spins around, looking at John with wide eyes. There is silence. A moment passes and when John lowers his eyes in shame, Teddy’s darken.
John lets out a snort that is borderline delirious.
“Is it carrot?” Sherlock asks innocently as a third plate is slapped down on the wood next to his cup.
“Why’d you stop?” John asks quickly as Sherlock’s mouth opens to no doubt comment on his tone.
and John screaming that he
"Damn bloody childish, inconsiderate..." John's angry muttering trails off into incoherent nonsense as he quickly skims through his files.
“You too. Thank you, I mean.” John grasps Teddy’s arm and the man squeezes his in return.
Sherlock doesn’t look at him, eyes fixed at a singular spot in the distance, spine tall and ridgid.
“An apology is a start.”
Encouraged by his lack of response, she shifts closer and raises her other hand to grip onto the back of John’s neck. Her eyes are a bit manic as she leans forward. “You’re such a good man John, a good man,” Her breath ghosts over his face and John can see clumps of dried mascara in her tear ducts. “We don’t deserve these people in our lives.”
John groans, shifting his body to slot a leg between Sherlock’s open thighs as he licks into the hot mouth under him. Sherlock slides his other hand up into John’s hair, tugs at it and nips lightly at his lip with sharp teeth.
“Okay, okay,” John raises his hands in surrender. “Obviously a sore spot. I’ll drop it.”
John thinks she’s fantastic.
“His father!?” John gasped.
“Victor!” Sherlock cries in outrage.
“Ouch,” John winces in sympathy.
John shakes his head in dismay, unsurprised, and moves away from the gruesome sight on the windowsill. He takes a seat on the bed next to Sherlock’s hip, reaching over for the lighter on the pillow to give his hands something to do. He flicks it open and closed a couple of times before noticing an inscription on one side reading,
John feels a little bad for assuming that Jed had just left the woman. Then again…
“Shit!” John darts forward. “Are you okay?”
John doesn’t comment, thinking that’s a bit unfair considering the woman named her dog
he breathes, giving John a half-hearted glare.
Sherlock shoots John a questioning look, which he ignores.
John sucks in a deep breath into his nose, the smell of coconut and smoke filling his nostrils. He flexes his fingers, rests his lips against the skin in front of his face.
“I dunno, you seem pretty easy to get along with.” It’s a true enough statement, this Sherlock is decidedly less rude and abrasive than the one John met years ago.
John had winced in sympathy, remember how the man in question had passed suddenly five years ago due to an undiagnosed tumour in the brain. Teddy had been extremely close to him.
Toby and Evie glance at each other, she pulls a face. “Definitely think we need to go to the hospital.”
“You don’t remember anything from last night?” Toby asks again, frowning deeply.
The boy simply stared.
Sherlock hums in agreement, slowly raising his parted feet off the ground and up into a handstand.
Thank you for all your lovely comments, it really does brighten my day!
“Of course,” Sherlock nods, “So, you’ll be back here before you know it.” He gives Teddy a bright smile.
Jed doesn’t answer and glances around, first at John then settling on Sherlock.
John blinked up at the so very blue sky. “You’re pretty.” John felt much more content, knowing that the sky now knew how pretty it was. The sky blinked, and shifted to the floor before darting back at John.
“I was in a lecture,” John shrugs, hoping Sherlock doesn’t detect the lie. He usually can but the Sherlock sitting across from him just nods and looks away deep in thought.
John stops moving, ears ringing.
Blinking heavily, John slides one hand slowly up Sherlock’s back, cups the back of his head. It’s warm under his palm, and he simply holds.
His bright eyes glance around the room and settle on John standing over by the sink, who gives him a sheepish wave.
"It was. Burst pipe, flooded all the houses on this street, everyone had to be evacuated. The house owner’s son did it. Boring." Sherlock picks up a wine glass and inspects it in the light.
, me too, me too,” John pants into his neck, not even knowing if the truth of that admission is directed to a few days ago, or many years.
John doesn’t delete the list, but he doesn’t add anything else to it, either. Doesn’t need to, he can remember with sparkling clarity every moment he and Sherlock share together.
Considering the basis of Sherlock’s argument earlier, it doesn’t seem to be much different.
Suddenly, Sherlock lurches forward. “Here!” He commands the driver and is out of the car before it has even rolled to a full stop.
John smiles a bit, tugs at the strands playfully.
She shifts them over to John, assessing, as he walks away.
“You’re the central element.” Sherlock responds, matter-of-fact.
John swallows. It isn’t right, not really. Nothing is right, here. It
The heavy bassline is thumping a nostalgic rhythm like a heartbeat in John’s burning throat, the sickly sweet tang of whisky and coke on his tongue. Too-bright coloured lights are panning repeatedly into his eyes and if John wasn’t already quite tipsy, he is sure he would be hating it. As it goes, he’s surprisingly enjoying himself; the pulsing sweaty bodies surrounding him and the wide grins of his new friends as they grab onto each others arms and drag each other along to the music. John can feel himself smiling and laughing along with them, alcohol numbing his senses into nothing but silly happiness and a particular giddy excitement he hasn’t felt since he was a teenager.
“Shh,” Sherlock murmurs, pushing John backwards by his shoulders until John is laying flat on the floor. He kisses John’s collar bones, scraping his teeth against them teasingly.
“-Can we not?” Sherlock snaps over her, glaring down at his plate.
“Mate. You alright?”
“Speak and he shall appear, look at my littlest nephew!” comes a booming voice and suddenly Sherlock is being bodily picked up and spun around by a pair of strong arms adorned in a floral pattern.
“We’ll have a look at the times,” Victor promises.
The next morning, John wakes up late having slept like the dead. He stretches with a pleased moan. Then freezes. Memories of the night before come flooding into his mind and his heart starts beating frantically. The argument, hitting Sherlock. Kissing Sherlock. Oh god.
"Sure. If you love stabbing pig carcasses." John snaps, irritation peaking as his brain throws him a picture of what other stress relief he was imagining occurring between them moments before.
“Can I use your phone?” He asks desperately, hand already reaching out towards the young man. Toby frowns at his hand slightly in confusion.
Due to the unforgivable delay, this chapter is a little longer and a little naughty.
Enjoy! xo
Sherlock twisted his arm outwards, effectively loosening the grip on his wrist and took a step backwards with a glare. He darted his eyes up and down the man, taking in his dilated pupils and flushed face. His hands were rough and calloused, obviously a manual labourer. Possessed a dominance kink, which definitely wasn’t ideal.
Sherlock strokes John’s length with surprising gentleness, fingers fluttering around the head and massaging the silky skin with such delicate care that John just
Toby gives him a bit of a disapproving look, reaching out to take Evie’s hand. “Yeah I know, mate, but unless you’ve got a few hundred quid hidden somewhere to pay for a taxi, that’s not going to happen right now.”
Sherlock ignored the questioning looks from his parents.
“Yeah, they are,” John agrees. “Don’t you get on well with them?”
“Good, because you have no reason to be. Considering I haven't actually done anything wrong.” Sherlock glares at him and stomps over to his dresser.
“Smile, you look angry. No, not
John gives him a side-eyed look and props him up against the brick wall that John had been having a crisis on moments before.
Just as he reaches the stairs, Sherlock’s door opens again, this time much softer. John almost doesn’t look back, not really wanting to see the evidence of something he’d rather not think about, but a voice calls his name.
"Nothing," John answers quickly. He winces at the too-fast response and tries again. "I thought I heard you moving around..."
John can't sleep. He keeps replaying what he said to Sherlock earlier. He should have apologised.
It doesn’t take long, four strokes at most, and then John lets out a gasp and spurts all over Sherlock’s stomach, his name on his lips.
him, who didn’t hesitate to tell Sherlock he loved him right back when the man had accidently muttered the dreaded words first. Who, apparently, had fallen in love with Sherlock just as quickly as the detective had with the doctor. Who enjoys telling him that fact daily, even now, just to see Sherlock smile. Tells him even when they row and bicker, and when they shout and scream at each other, when they curl up together on the sofa or when they’re at crime scenes or when they’re panting into each others mouths and gripping fists into bed sheets.
"Sherlock, listen. What I said, it wasn't fair. I know you weren't trying to be a dick. I shouldn't have shouted at you. I don't know why I got so..." he trails off with a sigh.
Victor can’t stop a quick grimace from twisting his features but he covers it up swiftly with a strained smile and looks over to the siblings.
isn’t putting enough effort into the game.
Alex is standing in the garden, face twisted and teeth bared as he pants heavily. He turns in a slow circle, as if sensing their presence. As he gradually twists his head in their direction, Sherlock and John dart behind the flaking wood. John can feel his heart in his throat, his pulse jumping with adrenaline and excitement. He glances behind them, where Victor is sat on the floor with a wide eyes. John shoots him a lopsided grin, and Victor shakes his head at him in dismay.
“I...don’t have it with me.” The young man replies slowly. When John simply stares at him he elaborates, “I mean, it’s connected to the wall..in my house?” He poses it like a question, looking a bit lost.
“Morning!” Sherlock sings merrily, sitting at the edge of the bed.
“Well, they’re really expensive,” Toby mutters defensively. John ignores him and turns in a slow circle.
John doesn’t know what to make of that statement and so doesn’t say anything.
. But maybe it was everything else.
John blinked.
John stared at Sherlock. “You know you just proved my point.”
Their tongues slide together furiously, and John has never felt anything so damn erotic in his life. He loosens his hands on Sherlock's wrists when the detective snaps his hips forward without warning and Sherlock's hands land on his chest. He grips the material hard, his face turning to follow John's as he changes the position of their heated kiss. John’s mind is blank, his body reacting to a primal need he hasn’t felt in a very long time.
“Ah, bit of rumpy-pumpy?” Rudy asks, nodding in casual understanding before moving away, his voice drifting quieter as he wanders back towards the kitchen. “Fix yourself up boys, I require your presence!”
After a while, John starts to feel the weight of the man in his lap and he shifts slightly. “Sherlock-” he murmurs.
Jules’ wide eyes squint gradually into confusion, but John is already storming towards the club doors once more.
Sherlock huffs a breathy laugh, tongue emerging to toy at his right incisor as he tilts his lips in a half-grin. The sight makes John’s breath hitch slightly and he suddenly feels very unstable.
John forces his eyes away from the door. They land on the TV, left on the channel Sherlock had chosen. It’s an old James Bond film, one of John’s favourites. Sherlock hadn’t liked it yet here it was, playing on the screen in front of John.
"That's not what it's about..." John breathes.
"About an hour ago, Sherlock explained you were at work. Then he said he needed a second opinion on something and... voilà." Teddy gestures at the mess Sherlock is half-heartedly trying to clean up with a tea towel in one hand, while the other is texting rapidly on his phone.
Teddy seems to have taken a shine to the detective, asking him about his work and sending him compliments every two minutes, varying from his intelligence to his looks. Sherlock usually ignores remarks like these from other people, but with Teddy he smiles charmingly, visibly enjoying the praise and allowing Teddy to continue.
"What is this place? Is it for a case?" John asks, stepping on dusty floorboards that look like carpet was aggressively wrenched from its grasp going by the scrapes and scuffs.
“Lower your fists, Eleanore, are you a primitive sort?” Eurus gives Rudy an appalled look before
John notices slow movement in the corner of his eye. "Sherlock that means you too."
Teddy looks up. “Hm, I think he just likes doing things his own way.”
“You’re going to get us all killed one of these days, Sherlock!” Victor hisses across the table as John takes a sip of tea.
“Oh!” Toby’s expression clears, but shakes his head. “I don’t have one of those, sorry.”
Being only six, the young child of course didn’t have a full grasp over overwhelming emotion, the rejection painful and baffling. He was hurt, so he wanted Sherlock to hurt too. And Sherlock, also only being six and unfortunately having an even
John glances at Teddy with dread. Teddy looks much the same, not dishevelled and out of breath, but looking distinctly happier than he did before he went into Sherlock’s room. John sighs and heads back towards the living room, where Teddy is heading. He sits next to his friend, suddenly miserable and very tired.
“John’s parents are dead,” Sherlock cuts in casually.
“-No Sherlock!” John interrupted, “I am sick and tired being your lab rat!” John was suddenly standing, and
you took at any rate. This is important.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, although his lips were twitching slightly. “You wanted to know my progress?” He asked, kicking the box away.
“What ever shall we do-”
“You look good.”
John doesn't know, can't ever seem to follow what Sherlock is thinking these days, so he simply shrugs and turns away.
“My knight in shining armour.” John muttered, slumping against the cushions.
John wasn't sure how Sherlock could be so confident of that when the child had his face buried into his drawn-up knees, and he rather suspected the detective didn’t know
“No thank you,
“What about Luke Ford? And Joel?”
“Sherlock!” Emelia scolds, patting the auburn head gently as she passes it.
John doesn’t know how long they lay together in the bath for, but he must have drifted off because he finds himself blinking his eyes open, neck stiff and shoulders cramped.
annually drug John. Then again, this Sherlock doesn’t, John supposes.
“No, lad, this is the Partridge residence. You’ve got the wrong number. Good day.”
John was rather surprised at how easily Sherlock picked up the work, considering the man is allergic to any sort of manual labour that isn't chasing down a suspect. Well, at first anyway. The first day, John was left to work on the tills and Sherlock was to stock the shelves. Sherlock was perfect at it, uncomplaining, helpful and charming to customers who asked where this or that were kept. John was a bit proud, to be honest.
The muscle of Sherlock’s jaw is fluttering rhymically as he clenches and unclenches his teeth, and he quirks a small smile of someone not-all-there before leaning down to lick a stripe up the side of John’s neck.
John recognises his old friend’s voice and a sudden fury surges out of nowhere and John sprints up the rest of the steps, kicking open the door to a much loader exclamation of, "Put your back into it man!"
“Right,” John frowns, sliding an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and, without a backwards glance, begins walking him towards the exit.
“Wait!” Rachel cries, hurrying to follow them, “Why would Jed be here!?”
John huffs over his chuckling and rolls his eyes as he glances around for a tissue. After he’s wiped his hands and face, he grips Sherlock’s forearms and tugs him out of the sink.
John huffs a laugh before pausing. He narrows his eyes in suspicion as his friend pads into the kitchen. John follows and leans against the unit, watching Sherlock as he fills up the kettle.
Sherlock hasn’t gone through hours and hours of John screaming at him to promise,
Looks like his aversion towards food spans across any timeline. The instinct to encourage him to eat makes John bite the inside of his cheek more than once.
They were working undercover for a case, something about a drugged homicide, Sherlock forgets. Sherlock was dressed in tight jeans and a black t-shirt, John in a similar get up (
John wills himself not to flush, raising an eyebrow at Sherlock’s tented boxers in turn. Sherlock casts a quick eye around his room, darts over to the floor and picks up a sheet that was kicked away during the night. He wraps it around his shoulders, effectively hiding the evidence, and pads over to the door where Victor has taken up knocking a annoyingly repetitive pattern onto the wood.
“I have my theories,” she mutters, eyes trained back on the two boys, who are now full-out chucking handfuls of water at each other.
at his food before buying it, thank you very much.
John barks out a laugh before trying to balance three mugs of boiling tea in his arms, following.
John hisses, his mind a haze of adrenaline, can’t really believe this is happening. Doesn’t want to
“Yeah well,” he clears his throat. “I haven't actually done anything yet, so.” He shrugs.
“I guess so,” John agrees lightly, opting to not express too much of an opinion on the matter.
John blinked and willed his body to move, sliding between the cages and rubbing his eyes tiredly. “Yeah, I’m coming.” He muttered, following the detective back onto the shop floor, not really understanding why he felt a bit disappointed and also a bit weary.
…Oh God. John forces himself to step back and sinks slowly back onto the sofa, eyes still on the closed door.
“Like you know Frank?” John stirs the tea, not looking at his friend who is leaning against the fridge.
“John, you are experiencing hallucinations due to a rather severe fever. You ought to go back to bed,” Sherlock stated calmly and clearly. John was not impressed.
There's probably heaps of grammar mistakes, so I apologise for that. Also the late update-life got in the way.
John fixes his eyes to the man’s face, watching intently. “Alfie.”
John groaned and placed a hand over his eyes. Suddenly a burst of shocked laughter had filled the air and John looked up in surprise. Teddy was still chuckling, his dark eyes wide and fixed on Sherlock before turning them in disbelief onto John. “
“Ah, let’s never speak of that again eh?” Teddy chuckles, ignoring the dark atmosphere. He glances at his watch. “On that note, I must be off. Trains to catch, people to see etcetera, etcetera.”
The afternoon passes surprisingly quickly, John’s initial awkwardness disappearing as soon as he re-entered the kitchen a few minutes after Mycroft. Sherlock and Rudy had immediately flown at him, as if waiting for his return, and dragged him into an argument about whether or not it takes seven years to digest chewing gum. Rudy was adamant that, ‘
“In his room.” John says nothing more.
Rudy stands abruptly, knocking the table and nearly upturning their glasses. Sherlock reaches out a quick hand to steady them.
he had felt, god, the
John mutters a curse and reaches down, fingers straining and body hanging suspended off the side of the bed as he tries to locate the phone.
“Mr Holmes. Why am I not surprised?”
Sherlock blinks lazily at him. “Ah, so I am. Suppose it would be rather redundant of me to go in today, now.”
John lets go of his hands, watching with growing dread as Sherlock’s arms flop down to his sides like a ragdoll.
Sherlock’s head snaps up, and his eyes go wide for a second when they land on John.
“There’s a towel and a toothbrush there too,” Sherlock gestures.
“Don’t be dramatic, Victor,” Sherlock rolls his eyes, unconcerned.
John grabs his wrist, stopping him from opening the door. Sherlock's eyes snap up to his and narrow dangerously.
“Nothing. She was just standing there, watching me sleep. Was a bit creepy, I won’t lie. Then she just turned and left without saying a thing.”
Sherlock jerks himself upright, scowling. “No. I can’t give them back because I don’t know where they are.”
“Hm,” is all she says, squinting at him.
“You amaze me.” John whispers without hesitation.
After dinner, John only has a second to thank Sherlock’s parents for the meal before the younger man is dragging John out of the room and upstairs to his room.
“Why would I be angry with you?”
John switches off the bedside lamp, says a silent goodbye to this peculiar world and falls almost immediately to sleep.
Sherlock starts a bit and glances at his hand, flexing his fingers in and out of a fist as the bloodied scabs shift with his bruised skin.
“No! What do you mean you put something in my tea?”
I hope YOU like it!!
by any means, but he’s somewhat given up trying to to intimidate John and purposely keep him out of the loop.
“Who’s ‘A’?”
“You look
John watches him for a moment before sighing and kicking off his boots, placing them neatly together up against the wall next to the door.
Stupid idea, really, considering the teacher was an idiot.
Not that it was an argument, really, John realises. Sherlock hadn’t said a thing. The man usually has no qualms against standing up for himself, whether or not he is in the right. Sherlock has just as much as a temper as John does, and it comes out the most when he is being attacked. John has been the subject of said anger, many times. But John has also noticed that when Sherlock is most definitely in the wrong, those are the times the man will vehemently defend himself. He hates admitting when he’s wrong. So it only makes sense that when he has actually done
John falters in the hall, wondering if Sherlock really
Sherlock’s smile shifts once more, this time it reaches his eyes. He seems pleased with John’s answer.
John frowns at the throwaway comment, wondering what on earth Sherlock had been dreaming about for him to have punched something so hard he cut open his knuckles while he was sleeping and didn’t even notice. John takes a deep breath.
“No I’m not.”
“No, it’s not…” John doesn’t know where to begin. If he should even say anything at all. He can’t deny the thought of confiding in someone is appealing, however, and Teddy is egging him on with his eyes.
, but he believed he was making a good point and should continue thus, “I am sick and tired of being poisoned by
“To see if I can piss!” Sherlock shouts, slamming the door shut behind him.
Sherlock snaps his head round to John so fast his neck cracks. “What?”
John snaps his head towards the door, where Eurus is entering with a mild expression. John quickly glances back to Sherlock, trying to gauge his reaction. Sherlock looks round at her in a relaxed manner before turning back to his plate with no expression. She slowly pads into the room and over to her brother’s chair, standing behind him. With slow movements, she raises her left hand and runs it up into his hair, carding slender fingers through the curls. Sherlock doesn’t react, takes a bite of toast.
“I don’t know why you feel the need to scorn the man for living his best life and thus allowing happiness to shine through his heart, but if doing so makes you feel like
Downstairs, directly below him, his best friend is astonishingly asleep (maybe or maybe not on the floor). He knows this because he can’t hear a peep of noise under him, learned behaviour to know what to listen out for. A habit he won’t ever lose, it seems. Always listening for him, his friend, waiting to hear a body roll over in bed or the soft padding of pacing feet on carpeted floor. His best friend who has died, and resurrected. Who hurt John so many many times and who has unwaveringly, frustratingly always
“Hey, hey, John,” Jules suddenly stumbles closer, resting his free hand on John’s shoulder. “You should stay ‘way from Sher’ock. Ser’sly. Ser-seriously.”
“Remember anything?” Sherlock asks, eyeing him in the similar way he looks at particularly fascinating microscope slides.
The little bell above the door chimes as Toby opens it, holding it for Evie and John to step through.
When they’ve finished their tea, Sherlock stretches out on John’s bed while the older man has a quick shower in the ensuite. Wrapping the towel around his waist, John looks at the pile of clothes from yesterday with a grimace. His jeans are muddy, the legs a bit stiff where it’s hardened overnight, and his jumper isn’t much better. Not to mention putting on yesterday’s pants always makes John feel rather disgusting. With a sigh, he pulls the pajama bottoms on again, deciding to go commando and ask Sherlock if he could use the washing machine. He goes to pull the soiled jumper over his head before simply dumping it back on the floor and heading back into the bedroom.
“Over here!” Victor shouts, having followed him back inside, face pale as he waves over to the left.
Speaking of the cold, John shivers. He’s
It wasn’t hard, the small muscles of his arms not having developed enough to cause much damage, but the intent was clear and the other boy had
But John isn’t just anyone. He doesn’t believe Sherlock. But how to explain that? How to explain that he can’t just let this go, that a large portion is due to a clenching cramp in his gut. How to explain,
Soon enough, John has barricaded himself in the red telephone box, staring at the metal ‘Insert 10p’ sign while the couple stand outside the glass, their muffled voices chattering away.
“Huh,” Sherlock lets out a little puff, stretching his arms above his head and letting out a sigh of content when his joints crack. He turns his face towards John, raises a teasing eyebrow.
“Argh, ‘kay! S’one sec,” Sherlock grumbles loudly, adopting the tone of someone who’s only just woken up and hasn’t just been engaged in a thorough snogging session.
want his community service to end,” Victor huffs, tugging John into the shop.
The images of Sherlock grinding up against the two strangers won’t leave John’s mind and he opens his eyes again to stare up into the starry sky.
“Sherlock! Is Sherlock there?”
The kiss is a mash of teeth and tongue, sucking and biting. Their bodies tremble and shudder together, and Sherlock
In the end, Teddy just sighs, “It’s complicated, that’s for sure,” John gives him a pleading look and the taller man chuckles. “I can’t tell you what to do John, but I will say this. You’ll regret it if you don’t pursue this. And Sherlock wants you to.
John frowns at the harsh reply, he understands Sherlock’s anger but how can he make it right if the man won’t let him speak? “I’m just saying-”
“I’m glad I woke you up.” John grumbles childishly. Sherlock smirks over his shoulder, “I wasn’t asleep.”
John felt like he had missed a large chunk of the conversation. His face must have shown this as Sherlock let out an all-suffering sigh and rolled onto his back, pulling his arms free from the many layers of wool and gesturing at the ceiling as he spoke. "His owner was a murderer. You know, the builder...baker...banker? I don't know, the one who killed his wife. He was sentenced to life, remember? There was no one to look after him," he glanced back at John.
“You amaze me.”
him.” He flicks his eyes over John once more, expression twisting slightly. “He will grow bored soon enough.”
Sherlock looks back at the dark haired woman and holds out his hand. He waits. She blinks.
John stabs at the keys roughly as the file pops up on his screen. Trying to control his breathing, John skims through the document, trying to find something that he hadn't read in a while as those seem to have the highest success rates in calm him down after a fight with Sherlock. John assumes this is because he can trick himself into believing he has almost forgotten the memory and the small pang of pleasant surprise is a welcome relief to the blinding rage.
John smiles a bit. He clears his throat and looks away from the pale, piercing gaze. “How is it that everything always circles back to you?” He asks, voice purposefully light and teasing.
himself.
“Hello Frank,” Sherlock beams. “May we come in?”
Enzo had murmured, sliding his warm hand up to cup the back of Sherlock’s head and tugging it forward to rest his lips against his crown.
John is waiting for the reply of ‘I am well aware of how amazing I am’ accompanied by a smirk and glittering eyes, but Sherlock continues to just stare. He tilts his dark head slightly to one side, a mannerism that has always unnerved the doctor.
John blinks. “Pardon?”
John hears the faint sound of feet landing on soft grass a few feet away and drops into a crouch, holding his breath. He shuffles forward silently, hovers over Sherlock’s body to glance out of the shed, resting his chin against the inky curls on the top of Sherlock’s head.
“Hm? Oh. Yes,” Sherlock drops his hands from his mouth and heads over to his adjoining bathroom. He leaves the door open, and John can hear the tell-tell sound of a belt being undone and a zipper being lowered.
“Thank you John,” Rachel taps lightly with her fingers, causing John to look down at the hand on his leg before up at her face. He feels a strong urge to slap the hand away.
After a moment of silence, she follows John’s gaze and watches the boys at her sink.
They allow themselves a moment to get their breaths back, Sherlock sliding to the floor, resting his back on the wall, tilting his head back and closing his eyes.
"Ugh."
“How are you feeling?” John asks, trying to adopt a casual tone while his heart thumps unpleasantly.
Sherlock doesn’t seem to hear him, dropping all the weight of his arms into John’s grasp as he continues to move manically in time with the music.
“Do you remember what you said?” Sherlock murmurs.
a doctor, would assume that what Alex slipped Sherlock was indeed a cocktail of MDMA, speed, and possibly coke. The latter would have explained his sudden manic energy on the dancefloor, the need to rub close to any body he came in contact with, but has probably dispersed now. MDMA, however, can last for
“Clumsy,” Sherlock states camly, avoiding John’s eyes.
John shuts his eyes tight and clenches his jaw. The pain in his chest is horrific. It burns down in his stomach, radiates up into his throat. The loss of his wife. The burden of playing both father and mother to his child. The utter agony of Sherlock.
“Sorry mate, ran into a bit of a dilemma,” Toby apologises, glancing at John.
to see you punch Jules in the face.”
wrong, he would stay silent. John almost wishes he had snapped back something nasty in return, so that he would stop feeling so guilty. Sherlock had seemed genuinely surprised at John’s accusation, before his eyes had turned to ice.
John huffs a laugh. “You’re impossible.”
“I can’t remember the pain of it now, but I got a nasty infection and the doctors were convinced I would lose all sight in that eye. But, lo and behold, it caused no lasting damage to my vision. Except an irritatingly inconvenient sensitivity to light. And an apparent resemblance to David Bowie,” Sherlock shrugs, taking a sip.
"What the hell are you doing!?" John shouts. He watches in disbelief as Sherlock drops the now empty bottle into the bin. John can't believe it. His housemate really
“Admittedly, I would
“‘The Jam’?” John asks with a smile, locking the door after a moment’s hesitation and wandering over to Sherlock’s bed while the other boy stands in the centre of his room and slowly lowers himself into a crouch before standing upright again. John sits on his bed, watching the muscles of Sherlock’s legs ripple and flex with the movement as he does it again.
It was the worst two weeks of Sherlock’s young life, he had cried and smashed up his room, throwing tantrum after tantrum that his parents infuriatingly ignored.
After the initial introductions, they had all sat down to eat. John had glanced at an empty chair, wondering if they were going to wait for anyone else, but everyone had started tucking in without hesitation.
“Yeah. Good,” John heaves in a breath and lets it out again slowly. He turns in the circle of Sherlock’s arms and the younger man drops them but doesn't move back. “Why did you do that?"
“Non, you do not,” Enzo breathed softly into his hair.
Knowing he can’t stay and mope in bed all day, John climbs out of the sheets and hurriedly gets dressed. He needs to talk to Sherlock. Needs to make sure he’s okay.
Eurus smiles at him, and it’s such an honest expression that for a second John forgets who she really is.
“Sherlock, Christ, what the fuck is going on here?” John asks a bit desperately, weary and tired but heart thudding uncomfortably in his chest.
John can’t sleep. Even
Mycroft tilts his head to one side, curious and casual. “What about him?”
John snaps his eyes open and turns towards the slurring voice, groaning inwardly as Jules stumbles over to as he tries unsuccessfully to light a fag hanging from his lips.
“Can you stand?”
“What are you laughing at?” A sleepy voice asks behind John and he jumps in surprise.
“Wait, John,” He looks back at her and her expression has morphed into a desperate look. “What am I going to do?”
“Please John, I don’t want to,” Sherlock murmurs, a hint of urgency in his voice.
John glares at him. "Stop it."
“You must be the new boy. Joseph?”
“No idea,” Sherlock shifted to his other leg, causing his face to inch closer to Johns. “But let’s find out.” He gave a bit of a manic smile down at John, before suddenly leaning in. John’s heart froze along with his body and before he could register what was happening, Sherlock was sliding out of the cramped space, his body brushing forcefully against John’s, before making his way to the door.
“Yeah,” John lets out a shaky breath and opens his eyes again.
I’m afraid I have something to be getting on with today.”
Sherlock turns his head to face him, the close proximity nearly causing their noses to brush. John swallows. Sherlock's eyes follow the movement of his throat before answering. “Of course. Why would I lie?”
“Do you really know where he is?” John asks quietly. The three are jammed into the back of a taxi, John sat in the middle. Rachel is staring out of the window, paying them no mind as she watches the passing scenery of London with her bottom lip between her teeth. John doesn't know why she didn't just sit opposite them, squashed as they are, and being the last one in the car. But the warm press of Sherlock's thigh against his own is enough to stop him caring too much.
His eyes, already swelling and bloodshot, had looked up at John with such agonising guilt, and he just
“Bloody hell,” he says under his breath.
Redbeard and Bluebeard sprinted around the grounds of Musgrave for hours, squealing in delight and bashing their small wooden swords together with gusto. Then, when their little legs grew tired and the sky was beginning to darken, they had laid side by side in the grass pointing out funny looking clouds above them.
been a disaster, it had also been everything John would have wanted in a stag night. Just him and his best friend, getting horrendously drunk together, stumbling into an adventure, and making thorough fools of themselves.
“For fuck sake, Sherlock,
John peeks through his fingers at the clock on the wall, blinks in surprise. “We slept late, it’s almost eleven.”
is asleep. John wonders if that’s why he can’t doze off, because he can’t hear the usual crashing and bashing coming from his housemate in his room below. Their fight earlier had drained John to exhaustion and he had expected to have gone out like a light once in bed. But no.
“So? It’s not as if the manager is going to fire me, is he.” Sherlock muttered, eyes still down on his phone.
The auburn haired boy, obviously a regular customer, begins chatting amicably to the older man about nothing in particular, throwing in an order for a large portion of chips in the middle of a question about the other man’s wife.
John nods at him, thinking the fresh air might do him some good, then nods at the others, who slowly start collecting their things.
A man's body had been found dumped in the freezer out back near the manager’s office, left neatly propped up next to the frozen veg and chicken breasts, along with an hour of blank footage from the CCTV cameras that had obviously been deleted. So the manager had called Sherlock and a day later John found himself wearing a uniform with the name tag 'Pete' adorning his left pectoral and a badge reading
“Don’t. Just-don’t do that.” John shakes his head at him, eyes emploring and lips pinched together in a tight line. Sherlock’s eyes have widened, and when John lowers his hand his expression has transformed into such an honest look of vulnerability that John has to actively stop himself from reaching out and tugging him into a hug. A second later, the look shutters and Sherlock is a blank mask once more. He turns back to face the garden again.
That’s a lie. He slept here after he found out Mary was the one who shot Sherlock, when the curtain of deceit was cruelly ripped away to bare all in an act of unnecessary dramatics that almost cost him Sherlock’s life. Again. He couldn’t stand being near her. Couldn’t stand the thought of Sherlock in pain and ignoring it because no one was here tell him to
They all jump, startled, as a woman’s voice is heard screeching from down the other end of the garden.
John lets out a breathless chuckle, shushing him with a press of teeth into his shoulder as he pumps two squirts of soap into his palm before pulling back and running his palm over Sherlock’s cock and then his own.
But then she is turning back to her Uncle with a look of playful disbelief at his speech and the moment passes.
John’s bedroom hasn’t changed much since he last slept in it. Never had a lot of personal belongings and the room held strong from the blast a few days earlier. Downstairs is another story, the debris has all been cleaned away (John wouldn’t have let Rosie within ten feet of the building otherwise) but it’s cold from the boarded up spaces where the windows used to be and the living room is barren, anything salvageable having been taken away by Mycroft’s cronies to be cleaned. John hasn’t seen Sherlock’s room, but he assumes there’s at least a bed in it. Hopes so, at least, considering the sofa is gone.
John squints at him, immediately suspicious. Lowers the mug before the hot liquid touches his mouth.
John starts and twists his head around to see Eurus standing behind him, arms crossed and an unimpressed look on her face.
John absently registers that he’s still in 1996, pushing down a pang of anxiety this thought accompanies. Not a dream, then. Although John was seriously doubting that conclusion long before now. Won’t rule out a vivid hallucination just yet, mainly because the thought that he’s actually gone back in time is not only illogical but utterly
He’s missed this, John realises suddenly. He’s missed Sherlock.
John watches him turn to go, frowning a little.
“Did you know he takes drugs?” John interrupts lowly, staring straight ahead and not really in the mood to hear about what Sherlock ‘isn’t’.
This chapter is a bit darker than the others, small warning, but things should lighten up again soon enough.
“-Knowles,” Sherlock interrupted, eyes still down, “You went to university together, studied psychology but didn’t pursue it once you graduated. Married once, no children. It only lasted a year. Probably because of your closeted homosexuality…“
In the end, Sherlock was banned from the shop floor and was made to work stock out back, which is where John found him a week into their case, sitting on the floor scrolling through his phone.
’ While Sherlock argued, ‘
“Where do you usually get them?” John asks, wondering if Sherlock always picked up for them.
John shuts the door behind him and locks it, turning back to Sherlock who has stumbled backwards in alarm, face pale and eyes wide. He blinks at John in surprise before sagging against the sink with a harsh exhale of breath.
John thinks fondly,
“What the fuck!?” he cries, and Sherlock reaches over quickly to clamp a hand over his mouth, eyes still sparkling with mirth.
Victor lets out a not-so-subtle sigh of relief. Eurus picks up a knife and starts buttering a slice of toast with deliberate care.
John can’t disagree with that and smiles a bit at his friend. He frowns suddenly. “He did call the police though?”
“Look at me,” John demands, capturing Sherlock’s face between his palms to get his attention.
Sherlock blinked at John from within a cocoon of blankets. "The fish. Dennis."
“You’re back,” Sherlock had stated, blurting the obvious without thinking.
"In the kitchen."
don’t understand!” Teddy snaps viciously. He sends a quick glance towards the kitchen door before continuing quietly, “Sherlock cares about you a lot. I know I haven’t known him very long but it’s clear as day.”
"What noise?"
Much like with the former task, Sherlock at first put every effort into performing his role perfectly. The old ladies loved him, the building site workers thought he was hilarious, young women and men batted their lashes at him as he smiled charmingly while asking if they needed a bag. And then, much like with the former task, Sherlock got bored and seemed to adopt trying to deliberately wind up the customers. Every time John looked over at his friend, he was asking an old man for ID, or holding up a ten pound note up to the light with suspicious eyes while a teenager squirmed in front of a growing queue.
John reaches down with clumsy hands and tugs at Sherlock’s jeans, working them open as he fights to breathe.
John can feel Sherlock trembling under his hands, his previously hot skin cooling with his sweat under John’s touch. He runs his hands down to Sherlock’s belt, allowing his wandering fingers to dance across the swell of his arse with small subtle movements as the taller man pants into his ear.
“Now, I really do have to go.”
One arm is wrapped loosely around Sherlock’s waist, the other laying straight across the pillow. His fingers are numb where Sherlock’s head has cut off the blood circulation to his hands, head heavily resting on his bicep.
Sherlock moves his head to bite gently at John’s earlobe, breathing into his skin, “I’ve wanted to feel you for so long.”
Next chapter will be a continuation of where we have left off here....I could have easily continued but I had to end the chapter at SOME point...
John doesn’t say anything but Teddy must have read something in his face because he rolls his eyes. “Don’t be such a fool. He didn’t get my watch back for me and me alone, he did it for you. Don’t fuck this up. You have a hell of a lot of grovelling to do.”
He takes a sip, other hand gliding leisurely higher until his pinky finger makes contact with Sherlock’s crotch. He sees Sherlock’s adam apple bob and lifts the finger up, using his nail to drag one long line from the base of Sherlock’s zipper down to the seat of the chair.
“Mais moi oui,” Enzo had said.
"Hey, hey, it's okay. We just want to make sure you're okay," John placated, watching as sharp blue eyes jumped from his face to Sherlock's then back again in quick succession.
“Sometimes.” Sherlock had answered, eyes back on his phone.
“I wasn’t asking
John leans down to Sherlock again, speaking lowly to not be heard by the others.
Sherlock tilts his head, his smile softening in a way that looks far more sinister. “Are you afraid of me?”
Mrs Jones is muttering to herself on the other side of her large kitchen, jerkily slicing up a cake.
Sherlock’s hand on his cock falters in it’s slow stroking, and he lets out a small yelp of surprise. John drags his hand roughly up once, then back down, then lower, reaching out with one finger to stroke along his perineum.
Sherlock had repeated desperately, mouthing up the strong jaw, trying to reach for the man’s lips.
back then. But he knew something was up when his tummy would hurt, his hands would get clammy, and his heart would race even when he was just laying under the hot summer sun.
John reaches down to capture those thin wrists in his hands and pulls them from his body, turning in the circle of Sherlock arms before placing them back on his hips with a smirk. He casts an approving eye down Sherlock lithe figure, the shirt he was wearing now tied loosely around the narrow hips, the weight causing his jeans to hang low and allowing those sharp hip-bones to peek out over the top of the material.
It’s incredibly disconcerting, sitting in the same room as a murderer and her victim. John forces himself to unclench his jaw as he glances between them, sending a quick mental reminder that the eighteen year old
Sherlock looks confused for a second before considering the statement. “They’re Victor’s friends,” he shrugs.
"Sherlock, if you didn't want to come you didn't have to. I didn't force you to come with me."
They both chuckle at this, as if he were making a joke. He gives them a critical look. “What?”
“Sherlock didn’t take my dog,” she interrupts with hooded eyes.
"I don't know. The council relocated them I assume. The son got community service." Suddenly Sherlock throws the wine glass to the ground, watching it smash in satisfaction.
“If you could even call it a kiss,” Sherlock continues casually, inspecting his thumbnail.
“You’ve got a nasty gash on your temple,” Toby points.
“They were
John glances over Victor’s jerking shoulder towards the toilets where Sherlock had disappeared to a little while ago.
John chuckles and reaches down to help him. They really are knotted badly. After a few minutes of silent unraveling, Sherlock glances up again.
“It was my fathers.” He had muttered miserably.
John squeezes his eyes shut, wonders how he has been so blind, sucks in a painful breath.
“Nope, just me,” John smiles, leaning his back against the door.
he thinks. “Okay. Thank you.”
John clears his throat. “You do, you know. Amaze me,” he purposefully adopts a light and casual air and gives Sherlock a small teasing smile. “But you know that, I say it often enough.”
John lifts one shoulder, imitating Mycroft’s drawling accent with a grin, “Why, indeed?”
“That’s smart of you,” Mrs Holmes comments mildly. “It’s healthy to divide your interests so as not to become too overwhelmed or frustrated with singular material.”
