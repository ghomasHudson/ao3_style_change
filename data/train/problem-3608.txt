have a ring but I’m kinda stalled out on how to actually go about it. It’s kind of a big question. I feel like it matters how I ask.”
“It’s okay, Sammy,” Dean says, because honestly, it almost is. Okay there’s a lot of it he’d unwrite if he could, but the fact that Sam is hearing him? That’s worth his weight in gold.
It just takes them a little while to make it work. There are some…misfires. The first time, it’s all Dean’s fault.
Without traffic or detours, the trip is a solid nineteen hours. Dean intends to put away at least fourteen of those hours today and give himself a much more leisurely drive tomorrow.
Castiel’s responding laugh is much more of an ugly snort than actual laughter, but Dean sees the humour in it anyway. “Yeah, like the internet cares about my plot.  Have at it,” he says, waving at his laptop. Dean drops his book on the coffee table and approaches with well-hidden trepidation. He tries not to read anything except the last couple sentences on the page, focusing on what a logical progression for the sentence might be. After a few long moments, he backs away and stands up.
He puts that down to two things: number one, Cas is possibly the hottest guy on the planet, and number two, the man is fucking insatiable.
“Excellent,” Cas says with glee. “You should touch yourself.” He phrases it like a suggestion, but Dean knows an order when he hears one.
Cas fingers him open with unhurried thoroughness but it still feels like no time at all before he’s rolling away just long enough to put on a condom. He enters Dean in one smooth slide, buries himself to the hilt and then simply waits, letting Dean adjust. Their gazes lock, and Dean’s mouth falls open just a little. When Cas starts to move, there’s no urgency to it, his thrusts patient and steady, and Dean is all about it in a way he has never really been about slow, sweet sex before. It’s not until he realizes with a jolt of horror that he’s hovering on the verge of tears that he spots the danger in this kind of sex.
“Am not,” Cas assures him. “I’m being entirely honest. I can only just imagine what you look like in nothing but a scrap of pink satin. It’s a really nice mental image. I just wish I could see the real thing.”
“Quite the contrary,” Cas says, sounding strained, “and one of my coworkers went into very premature labor and will likely be out for the next two months at least. I’ve been asked to take over her classes in addition to my own.”
Dean blushes. “Thanks for dinner. I, you know, I don’t date much. But this was good.” This close, Cas’ scent invades his nostrils, heady and intoxicating. There’s something soothing and warm, calming almost, in the way Cas smells. Something that makes Dean feel safe and comfortable.
They talk so much Dean actually buys a fucking Bluetooth headset, despite the fact that he insisted for years he was never gonna be that douchebag. Whatever, he’ll be that douchebag if it means he can talk to Cas while he cooks dinner and does laundry and putters around the house. They even watch movies together, Cas’s snarky commentary in his ear making Dean laugh just as hard as it did on the island.
Dean drags himself out of bed, taking it slow and using the bedside table for balance while he waits for his head to stop spinning. His first stop is his bathroom to take a piss, and when he’s done he heads for the door of his room, which is closed.
“There was this girl,” he begins. “She was, well, I don’t know if she was actually the one, but I convinced myself she was. We had this apple pie life, picket fence, a kid – not mine, hers from before, but Ben was a great kid and I coulda been proud to raise him. The whole package deal. Anyway, we were together for a couple years and things were pretty good, except as you may have noticed I am basically impossible to live with and I kinda drove her off. And the thing is, I didn’t even see it coming. I probably should have. If I was paying attention at all I would have. But I didn’t, and by the time she lost her patience with me it was too late to fix it. So here I am, mid-thirties, totally convinced I’m done dating for the rest of my life and I never gotta be lonely again, and I realize I fucked it up real bad. And that was just…it was way too much to deal with so I just didn’t. I pretended it wasn’t there. I spent all my time at the garage, worked myself until I was too tired to think about sweet fuck-all, and just avoided everything. Figured I’d just eventually like, move past it or whatever, but as usual, Sam is way smarter than me and he figured out what I was doing even though I shut him out too. So that’s why I’m here. ‘Cause if Sam exiles me to a cabin for two weeks I got no choice but to deal with this shit.”
"Wait, so Dr. Winchester is the father?!" Jo asked, stunned. Dr. Novak looked at her with an expression that was equal parts confused and offended.
"Dean, you know that I want to work as a translator after college. I kind of have to speak more than one language for that." Cas leans over and presses a brief kiss to Dean's lips. "Can I go back to learning that terrible, horribly complicated language now?" he asks teasingly. Dean glares at him.
Cas’ lips were parted slightly and tiny gasps and moans escaped them whenever Dean’s cock brushed his prostate. The thrusts were so slow he could feel every vein on Dean’s member, and he loved it.
“No”, Dean called back and he could practically sense his brother’s bitch face through the wood of the door.
"Oh God, Dean", Cas breathed as he let his body adjust to the familiar feel of Dean's thick cock deep inside him. After a minute, he began to roll his hips slowly, teasingly. They had time, and he wanted to draw this out as long as possible. Besides, it was still way too hot and he was still too exhausted for hard, fast and dirty, especially if it was him who was gonna have to do all the work here.
“Good morning, Dean”, Cas replied sleepily. They stayed in bed a little longer after that, wrapped up in each other and reveling in the warmth under the blanket.
I'm so sorry for the long wait! I just had so many exams and stuff before break and also I couldn't get this chapter so that I was satisfied with it, but now I finally finished it! (Not that I expect anyone to miss the updates for this story, but whatever ^^)
After that there was a seemingly never-ending string of congratulations and hugs and more tears until Dean finally had had enough and demanded that they start in on the food
“That’s soo cute! I’m really happy for you! I’m sure you’re an awesome couple. Well, I think I should go now, wouldn’t leave your brother waiting too long”, she winked and headed for the door. “Sorry again!” she called over her shoulder as she left the bar.
After a few seconds, though, he felt Dean gently grasp his chin, turning his head so he was forced to look at him again. The cocky smirk was back in place and Cas frowned at him. “What?”
sounded like he regretted everything that happened after his mom died but that didn't mean that he would just give in and accept his apologies without question.
(PS: This hasn't been proof read yet but it's two am and I wanted to post before going to bed so please feel free to point out any mistakes)
All too soon, though, he pulled away again, hands cupping Cas’ face tenderly as his gaze caught his boyfriend’s. “You, um. You know I’m only teasing, right? I’d never actually do any of that. I mean, you mean everything to me, Cas, honestly.”
Then came the "I do's" and they exchanged the rings and then they were finally kissing and everyone was cheering and
"A second chance," Dean answered, glancing up at Cas. He sent him an encouraging smile before both of them looked down at the phone when Sam spoke again.
He awoke barely an hour later to soft kisses being pressed into the smooth skin of his back and neck. He still felt overheated and now he was also grumpy, like always when he'd just woken up.
Cas moaned louder, reaching one arm back to tangle his fingers in Dean's hair and hold him pressed against his ass, urging him to continue his ministrations.
“Is it because of that woman?” he asked, a slight hint of surprise in his voice. Cas managed a small nod. Dean grabbed his face tenderly and made him look into his eyes.
"I understand that, Dean, but I can assure you that Gabriel told us the truth. If it would help you, I could go back to heaven and check on your father for you?" Cas offered, taking Dean's hand in his own comfortingly. Dean thought about it briefly, then shook his head.
The wedding! Whoo! Plus, a special little surprise from one of my favorite characters, who is unfortunately dead (*glares at writers*) but I'm bringing him back, 'cause I can do whatever I want with this fic.
They were halfway through when Kevin entered the kitchen, still in his pajamas and looking more asleep than awake.
Eventually, Dean got up to make breakfast. No one else was already awake. He went into the kitchen and made pancakes, Cas’ favorite.
They all averted their eyes, and Dean grinned at his angel suggestively. Cas got the hint and leaned over to kiss him, but was instantly tugged into the hunter’s lap, straddling his thighs. Dean tilted his head up and planted his lips onto his boyfriend’s. They kissed hungrily and Cas grinded his hips down against Dean’s.
On Friday, Dean picked Cas up after work and they immediately started their trip to Lawrence, Kansas, classic rock music blasting through Baby's speakers. Dean sang along happily, something he hadn't done in years, at least not that enthusiastically. Their hands were intertwined between them on the seat.
“I guess I’ll just have to wear them for you again,” Dean winked, and Cas moaned his approval as he finally started to get rid of the last piece of clothing left between them. Dean groaned as his dick was freed from its last confines, slapping up against his stomach and leaving behind a small trail of precome. Immediately, Cas leaned down to take him into his mouth, and Dean gasped as his hands buried themselves into dark hair yet again.
"Uh, I thought you guys haven't seen each other since you were seventeen?" he asked, obviously confused as hell.
“Dean, please, move”, Cas whispered as he broke the kiss reluctantly. He wrapped his legs around his lover’s waist and his arms around his neck as Dean began to pull out slowly and then pushed back in just as slow. He braced his forearms left and right of Cas’ head and gazed into his deep blue eyes while he made love to him achingly gentle and slow. He loved this, the eye-contact during their love-making; it reminded him of their first time, so many months ago.
"Sam, please. Let me at least tell you what he said, okay?" He waited for Sam's confirmation before continuing. "He uh- he told me he was in rehab the last two years and that he checked himself in after a near death experience and the realization that he was lonely as fuck and wanted us back in his life. I mean, apparently he realized that he'd have to seriously get his shit together for that to happen. He sounded like a completely different man, Sammy. He apologized like, a thousand times and
"Jeez, Cas, you want me to die from a heart attack before we're even hitched?!" he exclaimed, hand resting above his heart for extra dramatic effect.
Now, they were heavily making out, clothes hitting the floor piece by piece until they were both naked, Dean on top of the blue-eyed angel, straddling his hips while he sucked hickeys into the skin of Cas' neck.
The hunter rocked his hips up as good as possible with Cas in his lap and he managed to continue hitting his prostate on every thrust. The angel’s moans became louder, interspersed with small cries and suddenly he gripped Dean’s shoulders with bruising force as he came closer and closer to orgasm. He clenched tightly around Dean while his sweet spot was stimulated heavily. His muscles fluttered and spasmed around the thick length inside of him and he screamed out his orgasm.
“Well, technically it was the other way around. Mom, dad, this is Castiel. He’s an Angel of The Lord.” Cas just nodded silently in agreement. Dean quickly raised one hand to stop his parents from starting to ask tons upon tons of question. He just began to tell them everything they’d been up to in the last years since John had died, although he left out some details – for example about the gravity of Sam’s demon blood addiction. He knew his father would throw a fit if he knew the whole extent of everything and he didn’t want him to put up a fight with Sam as soon as he’d see him at the wedding. Still, Mary sometimes had to calm her husband down before he started to punch something. Even with the left-out details, it took Dean several hours to explain everything, with the occasional comment from Cas thrown in. At the end, he still had to tell them about his relationship with the dark-haired angel.
Cas sighed as Dean lessened the onslaught on his sweet spot in favor of adding a third finger, spreading them wide to prepare him for his bigger-than-average cock.
But they both still had their morning wood problem, so Cas started to grind his hips down into Dean's to get some much needed friction. They both moaned at the sensation and Dean rolled his hips up to meet Cas' thrusts. Dean's hands wandered from the angel's hair over his back and towards his ass while they kissed messily and grinded their cocks together. He traced the puckered rim a few times before starting to press one finger in. He went slower than normally, since they only had the water as lube, but Cas was having none of it.
"Well, I don't know 'bout the others, but the two of us certainly had no fuckin' clue", Jo said, still a little shell-shocked. Charlie nodded vigorously in agreement.
"I'm the Trickster, dumbass. It's not the first time I faked my death, that's not exactly news for you, right? But of course, I had to make an appearance to hand over my wedding gift, didn't I?" he said, gesturing in Mary's direction. Dean frowned.
"Come on, Dean, give it to me", he rasped, and Dean certainly didn't need to be asked twice. He started with slow thrusts that quickly became faster and harder and soon Cas couldn't do anything but hold on for the ride. Dean was slamming into his oversensitive prostate with nearly every thrust, punching little
Dean drove the whole way without stopping for more than five minutes, wanting to be at his parent's house as soon as possible. Sam would be there, too, he'd called Dean earlier to say that he was coming from Stanford to visit their parents and ask if Dean would come, too. Dean had told him that he was busy and couldn't make it, wanting to surprise his family with their visit.
“What do you think, shall we head back to the bunker now?” he asked his boyfriend, who nodded enthusiastically.
Dean almost laughed at the way his mother's eyes went so wide he thought they'd pop outta her head, but he held back and just stood there with a big, goofy smile on his face instead.
The textbook falls to the floor, forgotten, as they roll around on the bed, desperate to get out of their clothes.
“You know exactly what I mean, Dean. I couldn’t sleep at all last night, because of those awfully loud
“You. Will. Be. The. Death. Of. Me,” he said, dropping kisses down Dean’s chest and abs after every word. Dean just chuckled in response and lifted his hips to finally make contact with Cas’ dick, rock-hard and dripping precome as it slid against the front of the panties deliciously.
Dean catched on quickly, grabbed Cas' hand and pulled him towards the Impala, opening the passenger's side door and pushing him in hastily. He sprinted to her other side and hopped in, ramming the key into the ignition and certainly breaking several speed limits as he raced towards his home.
"You sure 'bout this?" he asked one last time while slicking his cock up with more lube from the bottle.
When there was no answer from his angel, Dean threw a worried glance at his brother, who stood at Cas’ other side. With a sigh, Dean picked the unconscious angel up in his arms and carried him to his bed, where he carefully laid him down on the blankets. Then he inspected the angel for injuries, but couldn’t find any.
As he watched, another man came up to Dean from behind, clearly meaning to put his paws were they certainly didn’t belong, and Castiel
Cas, who watched him through the rearview mirror, was very much aware of his boyfriend’s arousal and he felt exactly the same way. But he also felt pretty smug because he was able to affect Dean in this way. Admittedly, Dean could do the same to him just as easily and so he waited impatiently for the end of their drive.
Dean was caught off guard, his eyes widening in shock before he relaxed and let them slip closed. He kissed Cas back just as urgently, threading his fingers into his dark hair. Eventually, he slowed down, and the kiss became gentle and deep.
Cas pressed a quick kiss to Dean's lips. "Hey, sweetheart. What's going in that beautiful head of yours?" he asked with a smile. Dean huffed and dropped his head to Cas' shoulder before answering him.
After a few more moments, Dean broke the kiss with a gasp only to lean in close and put his mouth to Cas’ ear. “You’re so hot when you’re angry,” he said and pulled back, trademark cocky grin firmly in place. Eyes narrowing, Cas ignored the comment in favor of wiping the smirk off Dean’s face by kissing him absolutely senseless. God, but Dean could be so infuriating, making a joke out of everything – even some idiot trying to force himself on him. Of course, Cas knew that Dean was very much capable of defending himself but
Sam, Dean and Cas finished breakfast, but Kevin took his time and the other three watched him impatiently, waiting for him to finish as well. Kevin glared again.
“Okay, let’s have breakfast then”, Dean said. “Hey, where’s Kevin, anyway? I haven’t seen him when we came back yesterday.”
A hand grabbed his shoulder, and he turned, ready to defend himself, but instead of black nothingness, he was met with blue eyes. “Cas…”
Castiel fidgeted a bit next to him, not sure how to react. “I’m sorry, Dean. I didn’t mean to embarrass you.“ Castiel didn’t know why he felt this need to apologise, but Dean’s reaction made it seem like the right thing to do.
Dean quickly stepped forward, pressing an urgent kiss on Castiel’s lips. The Angel returned it fully. Dean pulled back far enough to look into the Cas’ eyes and begged. “Don’t you dare die out there.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean thought he caught Cas squirming for a moment. It was probably nothing. He could ask about it later.
Every human in the room sharply turned their head to Jack with a look of disbelief before turning to Castiel, eyes wide and curious as to how the Angel was going to answer.
It was the first time they met Jo’s dad. Dean had exchanged nervous glances with Sam when their dad greeted him, but they had apparently forgiven past missteps. William Harvelle was a good man, and clearly loved his family more than anything. He ruffled Jo’s hair despite her protests and kissed Ellen’s cheek whenever he saw an opening.
Jack continued after a pointed look at his father. “We know of one other being besides God that is able to see the normal Reapers even in hiding. They might be able to see the Empty Reapers and may also be powerful enough to fight them.”
Sam stood up in full-on lecture mode. “I know we talked about that. But we can all agree that the Empty is not a good place for anyone to end up. Maybe the Demons deserve it, but the Angels? The Reapers? Other beings, who did good things in life, but just happened to be celestial? They are all laying in a restless sleep in there, just because of how they were born. And now, it is taking human souls too. Good people.”
so much that it sent him back’. So, what if the opposite of the Empty isn’t ‘something’? What if it’s life?” Blank eyes turned confused instead and Sam rolled his eyes at his slow audience. “Think about it! Before God and Amara, there was nothing. When God and Amara appeared, they created life and left. Since then, all the Empty has known has been the dead spirits of celestial beings.”
Dean stepped forward and aimed a hit to its head. He felt it hit, but instead of hitting something solid, his hand sank into the black mass. It had no temperature or real mass. The closest comparison he could think of was water, but dry, which was just a messed-up thought.
“We need to hear what Sam and Bobby has found. But we can’t just leave the other Angels.” Castiel looked around at his brothers and sisters.
Judging by how Castiel was tightening and untightening his fists, he didn’t know what to do in this situation either.
To the humans, he looked like himself. He was out of breath, fighting the remnants of pain that coursed through his body.
“Don’t worry about. It’s taken care of.” Dean put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder to slow him down. “Easy now.”
When their lips met, they both hesitated for a moment, just touching lightly. It felt surreal. And yet it felt as if it had been a long time coming. And it felt right.
Behind Jack’s back, Mary hugged her oldest son, who was obviously very happy underneath all the embarrassment. Sam patted Castiel on the back, letting him know that it was alright. John put a hand on his son’s shoulder, giving him a quick squeeze and a smile. Eileen signed something at them that Dean didn’t understand, but Castiel answered with a soft smile and a sign of his own. At Dean’s bewildered look, Castiel leaned in and whispered; “She congratulated us. Apparently, we are ‘glowing’.”
Dean might have snapped back at this, but Castiel was pleading with him, both with voice and eyes, and it made the hunter respond in kind. Softly, he implored: “Cas. If anything is threatening you and Jack. I want to know.”
“I’m afraid so.” Jack answered. “And even that is a long shot. We are only assuming that the Archangels were created from the void and that there might still be some of the primal force within the Archangels’ grace. But they must have been created from something. They must contain elements from the time of their creation, from the void.”
Dean looked at Castiel, and he had clearly heard it as well. Dean started shouting. “Jack! Get us back in there! Get us back to-“
Cas had always been very minimalistic in his decorating, and the layout of the room was exactly like his old room in the bunker. Bed, table, two chairs, bookcase. But everything was of a better quality and more comfortable than what the bunker had provided. And unlike his old room, this one actually looked lived in. There were books in the bookcase – not many, but they looked very old – and a few, small artefacts on the flat surfaces. Some of the artefacts looked ancient. Others were almost childlike, like a small seashell and a spotted stone.
“Then we’ll make it up as we go.” Castiel supplied with a sad yet nostalgic smile which Dean reciprocated. The smiles quickly disappeared again and Castiel looked at Jack. “But let’s at least wait until tomorrow. We can still look through the library. And Dean, though I know you are very stubborn, I still urge you to rethink this.”
Castiel and Jack said quick, awkward goodbyes, and Mary assured them that they were always welcome to come back. But right now, they just needed time to let it all sink in.
“That’s alright.” Dean answered with a smile. “Would you like to stay? I mean… Just to talk and stuff… Well, not
: Did a proofreading of this fic. It contained a lot more spelling errors than I feared. Sorry about that! Hopefully, I have cleared most of them now. No changes to the plot, but I have elaborated a little bit on some of the scenes and thoughts and feelings and dialogue here and there.
Castiel nodded as much as was possible without breaking the connection with Dean. He was positively surprised by the small, affectionate gestures Dean had already given. Initiating their first kiss, accepting Castiel initiating their second kiss, allowing Castiel to hold his hand, and just now kissing him again. Yes, he had probably intended for it to shut Castiel up, but that was okay. He could feel Dean resting in himself in a way he had not before. Still, he could also feel the hunter holding himself back, taking it slow as earlier agreed. Castiel respected that… but he wanted more. More closeness, more time together, more... everything.
Castiel looked down at the bed. “It has never been done before, so we can’t be sure. But our best guess for a worst-case scenario is that the power of the grace would implode, and you would disappear from existence.” Castiel looked back up at Dean. “And that is why this is not an option. It is not only your father who is afraid of losing you.”
The Empty frowned at the sudden change in tone. No one had ever spoken to it like this before. God and the Darkness had been bothersome, young creatures. Making messes and noises and loud, loud, loud… Never talked. Babbling. And then they left. One, last big noise, and then they were gone. Just sending the scraps from their table to the Empty when they lost their lives. Never talk.
“Yeah, I think you’re right.” Sam nodded. He caught Dean’s eye and frowned. “So, now you don’t have to be an Angel anymore. You can cut the wings.”
“Huh.” Dean kept ruffling them around. Then he looked at Cas. He could see his wings too, but he had to… tune in on the right channel. The one where Cas was displayed in blue light, shining everywhere. It was odd, seeing the wings like this. Every time he had seen Cas’ wings, they had seemed corporal, even if only portrayed in shadows. He had always imagined them as white and fluffy, like in any movie or picture of an Angel that he could think of.
Castiel couldn’t hide his own smile, and quickly took off. No goodbye this time. Just a silent promise to return.
But that’s not what Dean needed to hear. Of course, he valued Cas’ opinion, but… he had already made up his mind. He instinctively knew what felt right. So instead, he looked at Sam.
Sometimes, old familiar faces would pop up. Jesse Cuevas came by, telling them about a long happy life with Cesar. Donatello made a surprise visit, soul restored, probably a little gift from Jack. Even the pain-in-the-ass Ghostfacers visited, and it was not too bad to see them again. It seemed like people were coming from far and wide to greet them. Dean started to realise just how many lives they had touched.
“Yeah, I’m gonna be a whole lot more open to that position when you’re not standing over the charred remains of your most recent victim.” Dean instantly regrets his phrasing, but it’s too late to have it back now. It brings up all sorts of mental images of the positions he’d be open to if Castiel were to say the word, and this vacation has been tense enough without Dean introducing unnecessary sexual tension into the mix.
They barely make it to Cas’ kitchen. Dean drops the pie on the counter with the least concern he’s ever shown for pie in his life, then grabs fistfuls of Cas’ coat to pull him closer. Keeping his hands on the steering wheel on the short drive back felt like torture, and now that he can get his hands on Cas he never wants to let go. He wants Cas in his space, up close and personal. He
“Way better than I remember, then,” Dean admits, “’cause I just remember it being food at the time.” He doesn’t like talking about his heats. It’s embarrassing. There’s something deeply shameful about being that far out of his own control for so long, but somehow talking to Cas about it doesn’t have him looking for an exit like it normally would. He still wants to change the subject like, immediately, but at least he doesn’t want to crawl under the table.
“Charlie, I love you,” Dean says, ignoring the fact that it is, in his recollection, the first time in his adult life that he has told someone he loves them, “but that makes absolutely no sense. Are you drunk? Did you get day drunk while I was at the bakery?”
Dean rolls his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest. “Gee, I don’t know, maybe because you all but stopped calling me after you met
“Then I’d tell you that you should make it personal. Something that matters to the two of you. I proposed to Jess at the restaurant where we celebrated our first anniversary, with a bottle of the same champagne we were drinking the first time I told her I loved her. It doesn’t have to be elaborate. It just has to be meaningful.”
Dean starts to wonder if he bit off more than he can chew, offering to buy Cas coffee. He doesn’t have any specific regrets at the moment, but as much as coffee is casual and he never actually indicated he meant anything more than consuming coffee at the same time in the same place, it is an invitation. An invitation to think of Dean as more than an acquaintance. An invitation to take up some of his time. And he doesn’t think Castiel is going to go anywhere unsavory with that train of thought. He has no reason to, and every reason not to. Honestly, he’s not sure how he’s managed to reconcile this in his brain but he actually kinda trusts the alpha. But the longer Dean thinks about it, the more he’s concerned about giving anyone the chance to get that close to him. He is probably overthinking it. He’s also probably overthinking the overthinking. But he just can’t shake the feeling that he’s in over his head.
hasn't had the opportunity to beta this (see above re: impending marriage) lemme know if you find any glaring errors 'cause I'm nowhere near as good an editor as she is
He can also feel when Dean stops trying to match his motions to Cas’s and just becomes pliant, his muscles going lax as Cas works in him. The mix of pain and pleasure has pushed him to that place where nothing else exists, just the intensity of the sensation overwhelming his brain. He still makes these gorgeous little fucked out noises, half formed moans and abortive grunts. He makes softer noises, contented almost-sighs when Cas presses lips to his cheek, his neck, his shoulder. Dean’s so perfect like this, when he stops trying to be any of the things he thinks he’s supposed to be and just lets himself enjoy it, and that’s what pushes Cas over the edge in the end. Dean’s submission is so pure, so perfect, there’s nothing he can do to resist the beauty of it, and he comes with a strangled groan, grinding his hips against Dean’s abused ass until his cock goes soft.
Dean didn’t jump into fighting crime the moment he found himself with an abundance of strength. He feels guilty about it sometimes, that it took something big to make him jump into action. It’s what his favorite heroes would do. As soon as they got the means to do so, they’d step up to the plate. But for the most part Dean was just so freaked out by the whole inexplicable thing that he didn’t think of much except
He does okay for a while. He craves cherry pie, but instead it makes himself a pork tenderloin with sour cherry demi glace and roasted root vegetables. It is not anywhere near as satisfying as it would be to give in to the craving, but he feels a little bit more in control, and it means there are leftovers for lunch. He craves jelly donuts but instead he makes whole wheat toast for breakfast and lets himself have a little bit of artisan preserves on top. He picked them up at a farmers market a few weeks ago, from this vendor who grows all her own fruit to make the jams and jellies, and sure it’s a bit indulgent but it’s not fried and coated in powdered sugar. He gets low fat frozen yogurt on occasion, and sometimes he even succeeds in forgetting it’s in the freezer. His pants start to fit better again, and the cravings are still there, but he does a whole lot better at not indulging all the time. Once in a while. Sometimes. But not always.
“I tried,” Dean complains, “but do you have any idea how many Cas Miltons there are out there? It’s ridiculous. And those fucking people find websites fleece the hell out of you, by the way.”
Dean laid down, hand still on Castiel’s waist and Castiel’s hand on his arm. “I might have to revise the whole ‘taking it slow’ thing.”
Did Jack know what they had been doing? It was not illegal or wrong. And yet, Castiel could not deny this uncomfortable feeling of being caught by his son during such an intimate moment. Was it normal to feel like that?
Castiel sobered and looked thoughtfully at the hunter. “I appreciate your words, Dean. Truly. I could tell when you told me about Miracle that you have opened yourself up to love and kindness in a way I have not seen before-“
Before Dean could regroup and aim a new attack, something grabbed him around the neck from behind, dragging him backwards. He clawed at the arm, but it felt like a steel beam closing around his windpipe. Suddenly he felt sharp spikes forming from the arm, cutting into the skin of his neck. He might not need oxygen anymore, but he very much preferred that his head stayed on his shoulders. He summoned all of his angelic strength and desperately pulled at the arm, keeping the spikes at a distance.
“And we will keep it closed. Out graces will keep it strong. If you have a way to stop the attack, then go.” Camael stood strong. Angels gathered behind her, nodding their agreement.
“I don’t know…” Castiel was looking around them, trying to find their enemy. Dean could see the grace surging through him, making his eyes shine blue. He was preparing for an attack but didn’t know where it would come from.
For a moment, a quiet battle raged between God and Angel, staring intensely at each other. This time, it seemed that Jack didn’t dare to speak against his father’s will.
. And Dean wasn’t. So, basically, they had eternity to be together now. He was so relieved that he was unsuccessful in holding in the happy tears.
“So, you’re powerless against the Empty Reapers?” Eileen signed and asked, disbelief and fear edging her voice and sending a small tremor through her hands.
Since Jack brought him back, he had been busy with assisting in recreating Heaven in his son’s image. He had helped reassuring the other Angels that their new God and the New Heaven was for the better. The Angels recognised Jack’s power, but he was – or used to be – a Nephilim. And son of Lucifer.
“Okay.” Jack nodded and took a few steps back. God moving away to a safe distance did not make Dean feel particularly safe. “If you just-“
Dean smiled, and Castiel’s heart swooped. It was so warm compared to the broken look he had last seen on the hunter’s face, and much more beautiful than any of his memories had been able to recall. They had been apart for a short amount of time compared to the lifespan of an Angel, but it felt like forever.
Castiel felt a hand on his arm, making him realise that this was truly happening. He heard Sam’s voice next to him. “Cas? Did it work?”
Somewhere music started playing, Bad Company filling the air. Judging by the enthusiastic ‘Rock on!’ that followed, it must have been Ash who had brought a boosted ghetto blaster.
Compared to the last time he had been in the room, it had been updated with a few female touches, clearly a manifestation of Eileen’s arrival in Heaven.
Castiel moved his hand to catch Dean’s hand under the table, giving it a quick squeeze; an apology and a promise to return. “Please, do not think too much about this. We still have opportunities to explore.” Then he added to Jack. “We should probably leave.”
“Guess I did.” Dean tried smiling as well, but he was suddenly reminded of the wound to his side, now that the more important concerns had been dealt with. He grasped at it, still feeling fresh, warm blood against his hand.
The Empty Reaper screeched an ear-piercing sound. It seemed to become unstable. The smooth black surface burst and bubbled, like boiling water, under the onslaught of the warm, white light. Finally, it gave up on keeping its shape and splattered against the wall behind it.
Castiel studied the man next to him, but all he saw was nervous determination. “So, what are your questions?”
Dean smiled. “Well, I guess it was short but sweet. Sammy and I stayed in the bunker. Not much changed on that front. Oh, except, I got a dog!”
Jack came rushing through the Angels, looking more dishevelled than hurt, but as he made his way towards them, his eyes darted around his Angels with great concern. “This is not going well.”
Castiel reluctantly stopped his exploration of Dean to let the hunter remove the shirt completely. As soon as his arms were free, he picked up where he left off. He didn’t get far because Dean pressed up against him, and they were finally touching chest to chest.
Castiel took a breath and tried to steady his voice. “Whatever questions you have, I will do my best to answer them. But there are many aspects about this process that I do not understand. So please, Dean, reconsider your decision. You don’t have to-”
“Nah…” Dean tried to sound casual, though he was a little bit angry with his dad for kicking out what he considered just as much family as his blood relatives. “They know it’s a tough subject. But they need our help, dad. I’m not saying that this Archangel thing is the right thing to do, but they are my family. And I’m not just going to turn my back on them. And I’m pretty damn sure Sam feels the same way.”
The blast was still powerful enough to push away any other beings around him. Any Empty Reaper within the blast zone disappeared.
Dean drove back to the house. This had gone better than expected. Al lot better. For all the nerves he had been fighting, he now felt lighter than ever. He felt giddy. Freaking giddy, like a high school girl.
“Yeah.” Jack smiled. “I’ve turned other humans into Angels. Only if they wanted to, of course. They have to be willing to serve. And it turns out that a lot of previous soldiers and police officers and similar spirits find it difficult to be at peace. They need a purpose in order to rest. Maybe you need the same thing? And even though some of the old Archangels might return once weighed or I might be able to create new Archangels now that we have a deal with the Empty, I don’t want to push my luck yet. It would be reassuring to have you on the team.”
“Yeah, but we found him right after…” Dean trailed off for a moment, clearing his throat. Castiel nodded in understanding. Dean still forced the words out. “Uhm… Right after you left. But before taking out Chuck. Seemed liked he had missed this one dog when deleting all living things on Earth. Turned out that he was just messing with us. Again. Giving us one small glimmer of hope before taking it away right in front of us. But the furball came back together with everyone else, so we adopted him. Called him Miracle.”
Sam forgot about the glassware, eyes going round with fascination. “It worked? You heard my prayer?”
“Huh.” Castiel looked at the wall, appearing normal to him. He then turned back to Dean and smiled. “You did it.”
3) I liked the ending of the show (I will elaborate on this in the afterword), but I hated the way they just casually mentioned Cas. It might have been a COVID thing, but really? Are you just going to leave me hanging with an “Oh, BTW, Cas is alright”? WTF! He just made a beautiful sacrifice two episodes ago, and now you’re ruining it like that? If you had to bring him back, at least let Dean and Cas talk it out instead of leaving all the fans with unresolved feelings, no matter if they were going to end up together or not. I don’t care, just give me closure! (So much for saving the rambling for the afterword...)
Castiel put his hand on Dean’s arm. “It is not wrong to be angry sometimes, Dean, as long as it doesn’t consume you. Your motivation was clearly still pure.”
“The common areas cannot accommodate everyone’s liking. Our individual rooms are personalised in much the same way as your Heaven.” Castiel explained.
Sam cleared his throat. “I’m, uhm… I’ll hit the books. Maybe call Bobby and see if he can help with the research.”
More days past with dinners, visiting hunters, nights at the Roadhouse and days just spent in the sun.
Dean grinned as Sam turned beet red. The tall hunter quickly avoided his brother by instead focusing on the other woman in the room. “Mom. I don’t think you ever met Eileen.”
“Sam. You said you found something.” Castiel cut in, voice urgent with guilt from leaving his fellow Angels.
Castiel looked puzzled at first but caught onto Dean’s intention. When out of hearing range, he started explaining, gesturing with his hands towards Dean, as if it would help force the knowledge on to hunter. “Grace is celestial energy. It is fierce. In order to control it, you have to be focused and in control of yourself.”
Castiel laughed at the statement. It didn’t sound like Dean had meant to say it out loud. He turned his head, resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder. This way, he could peer over Dean shoulder at the shield of feathers behind him. They truly lived up to the reputation of an Archangel’s wings in both size and beauty. “Yes, you do.”
Dean thought about it. Yes. He wanted the thing to hurt. The power he had felt at first had almost been intoxicating. To finally stand unafraid in front of one of those creatures. Especially while being able to see its true form. He had wanted it to burn. To have a little payback for all the things that him and Sam had been through while fighting Demons. That good, old anger had surfaced again. “Maybe I’m just not cut out for this. Having powers like that.”
“I have to go.” Castiel untangled himself, suddenly realising how he and Dean had almost tried to melt together on the bed.
“And you. But you’re not stepping down, and neither am I!” Dean growled. “We’re soldiers, Cas. And soldiers fight!”
“You were wounded by a weapon created from the material of the Empty. To my knowledge, this is a first. They usually just push the Seraphs and Reapers away and take the soul. It clearly recognised you as a threat.” Castiel couldn’t keep out a bit of pride in his voice.
Dean did as asked. Castiel gently pulled up his t-shirt. It wasn’t strictly necessary, but he wanted to make sure that there was nothing special about the wound since it had been inflicted by a weapon created by the Empty Reaper. He had seen the Empty Reaper pop in and out of existence during the attack as it had manifested to attack Dean, but only caught small glimpses.
All except Jack, who just smiled at them like any other day and said: “Good morning, Dean. Good morning, Castiel. I sensed you were already here. How lucky is that?”
The Empty looked behind Jack to stare at the small group behind him, especially eyeing Castiel with a mixture of hunger and hate. “Come to give me back what’s mine?”
They heard a growling noise behind them and turned around. Apparently, Jack had summoned a Demon into the room. It seemed to be fighting an invisible force holding its feet in place, keeping it away from everyone in the room.
“I’m serious, Dean. In a fit of anger or despair you could risk sending out a flare of pure energy that could hurt someone unintendedly. You have to channel your intentions, and the grace will follow.”
“Huh…” Dean hadn’t even realised. It had just slipped. But if such a small word made Cas this happy…
“What’s going on?” Sam had run to his brother, holding his shoulder. Whatever happened, he couldn’t hear it.
And they took long drives through the green landscapes of Heaven. Only them and the roaring engine of the Impala. Dean was thrilled that Castiel was still willing to go on something as simple as a drive. But the Angel clearly had just as fond memories of the vehicle as Dean did.
Sam took in a breath, like he always did when Dean was opening up. It was usually both difficult to hear what his brother had to say, and hard to watch him struggle through it. Though they had always been close, Dean had never allowed himself to be Sam’s equal. He was always the protector, standing strong and alert around the pedestal that he had put Sam on. Dean didn’t continue on his own, but he had a small smile on his face, so Sam carefully pushes: “So… how do you feel?”
Jack smiled. “Yes. The Angels felt like Chuck left them, never giving them any answers or reasoning behind his actions. I wanted to do things differently. So, we have an information meeting every morning where I relay important messages.”
“You and me both, but… He seems changed.” Dean admitted. “Like, he heard what I was saying instead of just dismissing me before I even opened my mouth, you know? And he… He actually said that… That he was worried about losing me. The guy who dragged me out to hunt when I was just a kid…” Dean huffed a weak laughter at the absurdity.
Jack frowned for a moment. “Yes, I do believe so. No one has ever tried to talk to it before. Listen to it. Chuck and I just popped in and did what we came to do and then left. Basically, we started this war. So, I need to end it. And I believe we have found a compromise that will benefit all.”
“Sure thing,” Dean tells him, locking the door back in place behind him and jamming the chair back up under the handle. The pie smells amazing, but Dean’s not sure he can stomach any food right now even if it’s pie, so he opens a bottle of Gatorade and drinks half of it in one long gulp. It’s going to be a long couple of days. He needs to stay hydrated.
Coming to a decision is all very well, and the feeling of purpose and satisfaction (not to mention the high he’s riding from finally admitting to himself that he’s in love with Cas) carry Dean through the work day easily. His mood has done a complete 180. He’s fallen in love with an absolutely amazing guy who he was lucky enough to meet (at his brother’s wedding for fuck’s sake). A guy who literally
As Jess predicted, the university is an absolute zoo. Finding parking takes eons and even then, it’s a trek from the lot to the auditorium. At least it’s a nice day, bright and sunny but not too hot, with a bit of a breeze to cool it off a bit. Everywhere they turn there are students out and about even though Dean would have assumed classes would be done by now, but it gives the entire place a lively air. When they finally reach their destination, Sam splits off to join his classmates while Dean and Jess take their seats.
Cas laughs. “Ah so we’re at the point of the evening where we start employing literary devices to move conversation along are we? I think I’ve got some alliteration around here somewhere, let me just check my coat pocket.”
Dean lets them into the bakery and disarms the alarm, his unpleasant conversation with Crowley  forefront in his mind as he does. Castiel pointedly looks away while he keys in his code though, ever the solicitous gentleman, and then lets Dean lead the way into the back of house for baking.
“Wild horses couldn’t keep me away,” she fires back with a wink. Dean watches her drive away, his heart heavy. How someone he’s only known for a couple of months has managed to carve out a place in his heart this quickly and solidify themselves there this easily, Dean will never understand, but he wouldn’t undo it if he knew how.
“So was I,” Cas says, voice quiet, and then Dean is pulling into the driveway, and they make it to the door like mature, reasonable adults who are capable of being in proximity without ripping each other’s clothes off like a couple of love-drunk teenagers, and then they are inside and ripping each other’s clothes off like a couple of love-drunk teenagers.
“Cutting out of work early?” Dean asks. There’s really not much prep to do, but he likes cooking, so he’s been puttering around in the kitchen for a while now. The steaks have been resting on the counter for about an hour, nearly up to room temperature, and he’s soaked the wooden skewers for the vegetables so they don’t go up in flames when he puts them on the grill. The mushrooms are scrubbed clean and the peppers are cut into chunks and it all took him less than ten minutes of actual work but he managed to stretch it to nearly fifty.
With barely contained ire, Castiel texts the hospital information to Sam’s number and then turns Dean’s phone off. He decides he’s not going to mention his conversation with Sam unless he shows up. There’s no point. Dean already has enough reasons to be upset with his brother.
Cas hums, considering. “Is that so? Well, I’m not so sure about that. But if you think you’ve been bad, there’s really only one thing for it.” He slaps Dean again before he can open his mouth to comment or question, and then again, and again, until his hand is hot from the impacts and Dean is whimpering softly, wriggling a little as instinct kicks in and he tries to avoid the sting. Soon the whimpers give way to louder noises, soft moans and grunts, and eventually cries of pain that are pure music to Castiel’s ears. This is what he loves, taking a strong man like Dean and taking him apart, then putting him back together somehow stronger than he was before.
Benny hands him a box that’s far too large to hold a single slice of pie, and Dean eyes him questioningly.
Finally, after a long while, Cas leans over to his bedside table to grab lube and a fresh box of condoms. Dean raises an eyebrow. “I didn’t want to assume,” Cas tells him, “but if I
This time it is Cas who interrupts, but it’s okay, because Dean doesn’t know what he would’ve said. “Me too,” Cas tells him, something that is almost a smile settling onto his face as he gazes at Dean, who tries again.
Later, when Dean kisses him for the first time, Castiel still tastes blueberries on his lips, and it’s the best thing he’s ever tasted.
“Hey,” Dean replies wearily. He fumbles for a shirt, unsure why he cares. He doesn’t think Castiel is trying to come in and he wouldn’t be removing the chair even if he was. Dean could be stark naked in here and Castiel would never know the difference.
Castiel moves smoothly down Dean’s body, taking time to lick and nibble his nipples to hardness before tracing a line down his belly with the point of his tongue. Dean squirms, apparently ticklish, but he doesn’t make any move to stop Cas’s progression south. If anything, his pleased hums are encouragement and Cas takes them as an invitation to move this thing along.
And after being slowly and thoroughly fucked open on Dean’s fingers for over forty-five minutes, Cas does, in fact, beg for him beautifully.
Even now he moves slowly, careful not to go too hard or too fast. He props his arms on either side of them as he leans over Cas, lips parted in silent pleasure until Cas leans up to pull him into a kiss. It barely qualifies, the way their jaws hang open in awe. Before long they’re really just moaning into each other’s mouths, hot breath between them nearly matching the humidity of the storm that still dominates the world outside the shack. Castiel rolls his hips up to take him deeper and slides a hand between them to take his own cock in hand.
They talk about the new Star Wars movies. They talk about David Bowie. Sam talks about wanting a dog, a big silly golden retriever, and how as soon as he and Jess get their own place he’s gonna find a puppy.
For a moment, Dean fears a misstep, that he’s challenged an alpha in some way. An alpha likes to feel like an alpha, that’s what they all say, and Dean’s fairly certain that doesn’t include being pushed around by some omega. But Cas just smiles up at him, his kiss-bitten lips formed into such an inviting curve, his eyes heavy-lidded but bright with that blue Dean has come to adore. Fed up with second guessing, with fear and apprehension, Dean climbs into his lap.
“Tell me about it. So yeah, no toys yet. Well, except that dildo but man, I tell you, it doesn’t feel anywhere near as good as your dick.”
“Well, other than my house, there is officially nothing tying me to New York any longer. So that gets listed, I pack, decide what comes with me and what to sell, and I move. There’s the matter of finding a place out here of course, and I’ll need to hire a moving company and figure out if I’m going to drive my car out or have it brought out by the movers. And there’s some details to be worked out with the university here but for the most part that’s settled.”
“Did you want something, Dean?” he asks innocently, able to perfectly call to mind the wicked glare he knows Dean would be throwing his way if he had the ability to turn to face him.
By the time he’s worried one nipple to a red and angry nub, Dean’s soft hums of pleasure have decayed to harsh gasps and choked moans. Cas is careful to keep his thigh from pressing too close between Dean’s legs. Only a hint of friction, that’s what Dean gets now. Just enough to tease. Just enough, in combination with the low buzzing of the cock ring, to set his mind to thinking of how delicious release will be, but not enough to get him there. Not yet.
The sound of Charlie unlocking three deadbolts to let him in untangles something ugly in his chest that he pretended not to notice before that very moment. His shoulders relax a little even though he’s still carrying food and booze, and the smile he gives Charlie when she opens the door to let him in is at least 90% sincere, which is saying something.
“They haven’t even plowed the road yet,” Castiel muses. They’re far enough off the main roads that it’ll probably be much later in the day before a plow makes it anywhere near his street, and truth be told, he’d rather not go outside either.
“Fine, you know what? Stay here. I don’t know why you even bothered getting on a plane if all you wanna do is stay locked up inside the damn house while you’re here. I could have not spent time with you while we’re in separate states just as easily.”
Benny just laughs. “True. Alright brother, doors open at seven, so we best get started. Get the ovens on and we’ll put in some of those loaves we put in the proofer last night, and then we’ll move on to the fun stuff.”
“Awwww don’t go getting all soft on me now. You’ve got a reputation to keep up.” She throws her arms around him, nearly toppling the plate of pizza on his lap, but Dean doesn’t protest at all. He doesn’t mind the hug. In fact, if he lets himself think about it, he kinda likes it. She’s smaller than him and doesn’t have the bonecrushing strength of someone like Sam, but she hugs like she means it and she doesn’t let go until Dean feels well and truly appreciated.
He blinks a few times, struggling to make sense of what’s going on, until things finally click into place.
“Power surge,” Dean squeaks out, voice high, as if he can’t summon up enough strength to let it boom as it usually does. “Storm probably damaged part of the grid.” His eyes slip shut, preventing Castiel reading much into his gaze, but he’s already got a pretty good idea of how to interpret this.
“We should,” Dean agrees. He wonders if he’ll follow through. When he hangs up, he’s got two text messages, one from Charlie telling him not to wait up, which tells him she’s definitely with Stevie, and unsurprisingly, one from Cas.
“What do you want?” he asks it, his voice softening just a little. The cat meows back inquisitively, then again with such insistence that Castiel feels judged. But that’s silly. It’s just a cat. It doesn’t care one bit what he feels.
“I hardly think you ruined everything,” Charlie offers, consolingly, but Dean’s way too deep in the self loathing to be won over that easy.
“And I told you, I’m gonna need something better to call you if we’re going to be working together.” Cas pulls him back in close, not to kiss him, but to carry him out the side of the room, where the wall once stood. Its unsettling being this high above the ground without his grappling hook and a cable to rely on, but he trusts Cas. He must, but he would even if it weren’t necessary right now. The Archangel was a stranger to him, an obnoxious, arrogant douchebag in blue spandex, but this is Cas, also in blue spandex, and that’s a partner he can work with.
He considers ignoring it, but sheer force of habit drags him out of the living room and into the entranceway.
“We’re gonna find him, Dean,” Charlie says, voice softening a little, “it’s just a little more challenging than I thought it might be. I’m not finding any Cas Milton that fits the description. Could you have gotten anything wrong?”
Dean is still a pretty casual guy at heart, so he ends up rolling the sleeves up to his elbows, then takes more time than he’s willing to admit in front of the mirror, carefully gelling his hair. Ordinarily, he’d make himself a quick cup of coffee with the in-room coffee maker, but today he decides to venture back down to the lobby’s coffee shop to get a fancier cup. Not, of course, because he’s thinking there’s somebody he’d like to bring a cup of coffee to; he wouldn’t put that much thought into a virtual stranger. In fact, just to prove it, he doesn’t go back across the room to fish the tiny scrap of paper out of his discarded pants (he conveniently pretends like he doesn’t have Blue Eyes’ room number already memorized), pausing only to grab his cell phone and room key before heading back for the lobby.
“It’s not absurd that you want to take care of me. That’s. I mean. I never saw myself getting together with an alpha, but if I had, that’s what I would have thought about wanting. Someone who wants to take care of me. Someone who wants to be good to me. I just never expected that’s something I’d find. But it’s not absurd. It just has me asking myself sometimes if you’re for real.”
“Yeah but shift change!” She looks at him expectantly, like some sort of realization is supposed to dawn on him. It doesn’t. “New nurses. They probably don’t know the other ones wouldn’t tell us anything. Stay here, I’m gonna try the roommate angle again.” Before he can reply she’s out of her seat, headed over to the nurses’ station with determination in her stride.
With Mom dead in the fire when Sam was just a baby and Dad lost to a drunk driver (not himself, by some miracle, considering the number of DUIs he racked up) back when Sam was finishing up his undergrad, all they’ve got left is each other—and Bobby, of course, who was more of a Dad to them than Dad ever really was. Jess’s parents are still happily married and living in—what was it? Delaware? Virginia? Something like that—and her older brother and two younger sisters are scattered around the country. She gets along with them well, but nothing like Sam and Dean’s bond. In the end, Jess was the one who delicately suggested to Sam that maybe they could think about moving back to Sioux Falls. She confessed to Dean once, in strictest confidence, that Sam broke down crying when she mentioned it. He’d wanted to come home, but had feared that she wouldn’t even consider moving to nowheresville, South Dakota.
In the car on the way to the graduation, Dean keeps quiet for the most part. Sam and Jess have this easy banter, a running conversation that flows smoothly, and while they make efforts to include Dean, he doesn’t bring much to the table so there’s not a whole lot for him to add. But he observes. He watches how they interact, how they play off each other. They’re well matched. Jess is Sam’s equal in all things Dean can identify, except for a few places where he’s pretty sure she outstrips him. She’s witty and quick on her feet, but more importantly she challenges him. She never lets him get too comfortable, too complacent, and it’s weird for Dean to admit but he thinks Sam needs this in a partner. He needs someone who pushes him. She’s perfect for him.
Dean doesn’t drive his baby much these days. She’s still his baby. He still loves her. But it is somewhat less practical now that he’s putting down roots. He has a neighborhood now, places he goes that are within walking distance. And now that he’s thinking about it, he doesn’t want to be behind the wheel all the time anymore. He spent too much time driving when he was running away from things. Drove to work, drove to the next town, drove away from his problems. He’s living a different life now. Most of that life can’t be lived behind a steering wheel.
” Cas snaps, putting himself between Dean and the alpha, and for the first time, Dean is grateful for his presence. He doesn’t like being sent home under the charge of a veritable stranger and he likes it even less that the stranger is an alpha, but at least he’s got someone in his corner right now.
As soon as he gets Dean on the phone, he’s going to come clean. It’ll feel good to have everything off his chest, and maybe it’ll go a little ways towards repairing the damage he’s done by being so distant and inaccessible lately. It won’t fix everything. Castiel has a strong suspicion he’s going to be down on his knees begging for forgiveness next time he sees Dean. Actually, come to think of it, maybe he should lead off with getting down on his knees. Dean is always so much more…relaxed after a good orgasm or two. Perhaps Castiel should steal away to Sioux Falls for a surprise visit, blow Dean’s mind, and then tell him the whole story. It’d probably go over a lot better that way.
“And you’re telling me that if I don’t get in the passenger seat of that miniature abomination, that offer’s off the table?”
“Thought never crossed my mind, brother. You’re a better judge of character than that. I’m just sorry you had to listen to him spew that crap about omegas at you. Ain’t fair. He was trying to manipulate you.”
The cold toast and tepid coffee Castiel left for him took the edge off somewhat, and the shower really was a priority, but he really needs to get himself moving so he can figure out where he is, how to get from there to his motel, and where he can get food in between points A and B. As much as he just slept like the dead, it’s not going to be long before the exhaustion left in the wake of his heat catches up with him, and he wants to be safely locked away in his less than safe room before that happens. He’s got to work in the morning, or at least, he thinks he does. Dean should probably figure out what day of the week it is at some point.
“Why are you being so nice to me?” Dean demands as they turn into a residential area Dean hasn’t been in before. He should have been watching for street signs and landmarks in case he ends up in a bad way here, but he’s too distracted. The heat overpowers logic.
that’. Even when Sam hit the ripe old age of fifteen and showed himself to be a beta (statistically, so very common that Dean is still not sure to this day how John ever expected anything else), it wasn’t half the disappointment of Dean’s big dark secret. It was bad enough he was late to the party, going into his first heat at nearly nineteen when most kids figured out their secondary characteristics many years earlier, but to find out he was a damn omega? It’s a surprise dear old dad didn’t have a heart attack right then and there. The jury is still out as to whether that would have been better overall.
Come to think of it, that’s going to exclude him from most legitimate work. His best bet is likely going to be finding something less…savory. Something off the books. Something under the table.
Cas says, venomously kicking at the beach. Dean refrains from telling him that he can’t hurt the sand by kicking it, opting instead to give Cas a one-armed hug in consolation.
“That sounds excellent.” Cas slips his hand into Dean’s free one, squeezing gently and relaxing at the touch of his skin. Later, once Charlie is gone, there will be a great deal more skin he wants to touch, and it won’t just be hands he wants to touch with, but for now, this is the best feeling on earth.
They don’t need a structured quid pro quo of information. It doesn’t need to all flow out right now. They want it to, and who could blame them? The moratorium on information kept them from sharing all the things they wanted at the right moments, so of course they want to make up for lost time and opportunities. But the companionable silences you have with someone you truly know, they happen whether you have all the details or not. When you have that visceral connection with someone, the details are irrelevant. It doesn’t matter whether you know their middle name or their blood type or where they went to school. You don’t need to have a top ten list of their favourite movies. You just need their presence, maybe a little physical contact, and the silence can fill all the space you let it.
He’s not really hoping for much because his luck never actually fares that well, but that would be ideal. “
“I,” –smack- “told,” –smack- “you,” –smack- “to,” –smack- “stay,” –smack- “still.” Castiel chastises calmly, punctuating his words with firm slaps to Dean’s already red ass.
“You’re awesome at a few specific things I can think of,” Dean replies, waggling his eyebrows suggestively. Cas rolls his eyes. “And I’m sure you’re just fine at a bunch of other things that have nothing to do with preparing food. But you know, you could still learn. It’s not exactly super complicated. You just need someone to show you the ropes. “
It’s another two weeks before he gets the next update, and it’s actually a phone call. He’s in the kitchen, shirtless, making himself pancakes (sometimes a man just needs breakfast for dinner), and he’s so excited to hear her ring tone (the Star Wars theme song, obviously) that he practically drops the phone in the bowl of pancake batter. Some haphazard fumbling later and he manages to answer it. He aims for casual and fails completely.
“I—told them I would get back to them,” Cas says, after a pause. “I wasn’t going to accept without talking to you first. Are—are you sure, Dean?”
Beer has never sounded so good. Dean nods assent as they make their way to the baggage carrousel, starts trying out what parts of his life are even worth catching Sam up on.
He’s halfway through the remaining pizza when it occurs to him that pizza is one meal he and Cas never shared. What does Cas like on his pizza? Dean bets it’s something weird, like pineapple, but maybe it’s—fuck. He’s doing it again.
The night is quiet, but not so quiet that it doesn’t cover up the sound of footsteps trailing a fair distance behind him.
“So you like piña coladas then?” Cas asks wryly. “Let me guess, next thing you’ll be telling me you like getting caught in the rain, too.”
Through a partially ajar door, Dean can see what he assumes is Charlie’s bedroom. Instead of curtains, she has Gryffindor house banners over the windows, tied with gold sash. That’s surprising being that he didn’t see any of the Harry Potter books on her shelf, but maybe she has another bookshelf in her room or something. Dean’s just in the process of wondering what’s behind the other door, the one that clearly isn’t the bathroom but is shut tight, when Charlie hangs up the phone and comes over his way.
Not wanting to run the risk of showing up late on his first day, Dean’s out the door by 7:30, and leaning against the side of the building a good twenty minutes before Benny walks up. He’s wearing the same blue coat he had on the other day, and he’s carrying two coffees.
“Hey,” Dean says, tapping on the door and giving the kid a smile, “sorry, don’t mean to hold you up, but quick question.”
“Dean? What’s wrong?” Cas asks with concern on his face. His scent takes on a sour note, worry and uncertainty. Dean wonders if his own scent carries those notes all the time.
The new laptop turns out to have more than one use, and the first time Cas talks him through fucking himself on camera, Dean announces that he clearly missed his calling as a porn director.
“Hey,” Dean says, “don’t talk shit about my boyfriend. You know, the one who’s a brilliant, highly sought-after expert on melittology, looks sexy as fuck with two-day stubble, is unbound by arbitrary cultural norms like matching socks, likes to decorate his students’ work in new and interesting ways, and made sure to leave some kosher options for any Jewish colleagues?”
“Happy birthday,” Dean murmurs. “If I get up and make you breakfast now, there might be enough time for another round before we have to get on the road.”
Something shifted when John died. Dean didn’t miss him, that’s for sure. They hadn’t spoken a single word since Dean left. Hell, he wasn’t even sure John had tried to find him, and he’d been parked in the same place three towns over from Lawrence since the day he walked out so it’s not like it would have been all that hard. Dean stayed there for four whole years after he finally made his escape, working wherever he could and keeping his head down to avoid notice, but in the back of his mind there was always this fear that he’d have to go back for some reason. Sam would leave school, he figured, and have nowhere else to go and Dean would have to go back to keep him safe. Or something, he didn’t know what, but something he couldn’t avoid. He’s not sure why he ever though Sam would leave, since he loved school, and he was obviously never in danger of being kicked out, but the fear was always there. He just knew he had to be close enough that he could get back if he was needed.
Of course there’s only one room. Of fucking course. It shouldn’t even be a surprise. It’s kinda okay, really, what with the cost savings and all. Dean isn’t exactly rolling in disposable income and he knows Cas isn’t either, so not shelling out for two rooms works out pretty well, financially speaking. But apparently, Fate took one look at Dean and Cas, thoroughly exhausted after an entire day on the road and desperate to just shove food in their faces before passing out face down on their respective beds and went,
It doesn’t make any sense. Why would Dean show up in Ithaca, make his way all the way to the restaurant where Castiel was sitting, and choose that very moment to turn around and walk out? Something must have set him off. Something must have upset him.
This time, Dean doesn’t protest at all. He doesn’t give any indication that he resents the implication of control. He groans and squirms in Cas’s lap. Cas gives his ass another firm squeeze as a warning.
They didn’t get out of the room anywhere near as soon as Castiel would have anticipated, but it’s still too early for a drink. Or rather, it would be back home in reality, but apparently those rules don’t apply here in paradise. They’re only basking in the sun for a few minutes before an attendant in khaki shorts and a polo shirt emblazoned with the resort’s logo comes around to take their drink orders.
“I, uh…” That’s about the best Dean can muster, and that’s after three long years of trying to figure out how to break the spell Cas casts with those kisses.  It’s still better than the days when he couldn’t manage even spluttering, at least.
Dean’s running out of rocks, so he moves a few feet down the shore to a spot that hasn’t been picked quite so clean of ammunition. A mottled stone about the size of his fist makes a really satisfying splash when he pitches it overhand into the lake. He throws another one, and another, just a steady stream of muttered curses and rocks flying through the air. It’s not even cathartic, not like punching someone would be. Someone named Castiel who can’t make a frozen pizza without the fire department intervening and finds Dean’s entire existence annoying. Not cathartic at all. Just something to do.
It’s a King, so there should be plenty of room, but Dean feels cramped and claustrophobic and hemmed in despite it. He could just reach out his arm and touch Cas, and that’s enough to leave him feeling weird and awkward and apprehensive, and he’s sure he’ll never fall asleep like this.
“Excellent,” Cas purrs with a grin, tugging at Dean until he concedes and climbs onto the bed, bracketing Cas in his limbs. Cas’ hand slides between them to make a loose fist around Dean’s cock. He strokes lazily, gently, just enough friction to get Dean’s hips moving in time with the action, and he sighs softly as Dean claims his mouth. There’s still the faint taste of mint on his breath, the cool flavor making Cas’s lips tingle.
“Good morning, sleepyhead,” she smiles, pouring him a mug of coffee before he can get to the brewer himself. “I was about to send in a search party.”
He doesn’t see the other two guards before he reaches the room Cas saw Crowley in. It’s a large sitting room, ornately appointed and far too spacious for one person. Dean can see Crowley sitting in an armchair near the fireplace, sipping whiskey from a crystal tumbler. The sight of him fills Dean with rage, but this isn’t about Dean’s anger, this is about justice, so he is slow and careful and methodical.
Dean snorts, feeling not at all guilty when he shuts Cas right back down. Not even when he acknowledges that everything that came after St. John was ultimately just a mistake.
“Yeah ok,” Dean concedes, shifting his weight onto one arm so he can slide the other beneath his body and take his cock in hand. “C’mon Cas, is that the best you can do?” he taunts.
He turns around, frowning a little. Cas hadn’t mentioned any dinner meeting for tonight, and Dean just talked to him yesterday evening, albeit briefly. “Oh, he had a dinner meeting?” He could just be making conversation, but he’s not. Not completely. He’s fishing, he knows it, and it’s probably a shitty thing to do. Alfie’s gonna tell him where Cas is eating dinner, Dean can go surprise him there, and Cas will answer any questions Dean has. Probably this is just a last-minute thing, anyway, and that’s why Cas didn’t mention it.
“I think we’ll leave it at that.” Cas insists firmly, crooking his fingers and effectively ending the conversation. Pleasure whites out Dean’s thought process and turns the rest of his words into a groan he has almost enough presence of mind to be embarrassed about. Almost, but not quite.
Cas shrugs. “I’ve been staring at the same thing in this chapter for most of the day. It’s not coming to me. I need to go away from it and think about something else for a while. So I’m playing hooky.”
“You’re not coming?” Dean seems astonished at the revelation (and maybe, just maybe, a little disappointed). “I thought you might tag along. You know, do basically the same thing we did yesterday except in my room instead of yours? If you want, I mean. You don’t have to.”
But this isn’t other circumstances, and that means no romance. They agreed. Absolutely no making this into something it isn’t. Dean’s still on board with that.
Dean almost wishes he was Vulcan instead of Human so he could press fingertips strategically to Cas’ temples and just…give him the knowledge. Way easier than talking about his shit. Before Cas can say whatever it is he was going to say, Dean starts spilling.
Pleased with the results, Castiel sees no reason to let up. He presses a little more firmly, moving his fingers in tiny circles over Dean’s prostate, humming happily at the sight of Dean’s arms and gorgeous shoulders drawing tight with the effort he’s expending to keep himself still. He’s really such a good boy. He deserves something good.
“Is that…” Castiel asks softly, the confident sultriness suddenly gone from his voice. “Is that what you had in mind?”
“Oh you know me,” Dean postures. “I’m golden. Takes more than a little omega trouble to knock me down.”
“Haven’t seen you in like a month, kid. Thought I should stop in and make sure the parents didn’t traumatize you too badly in paradise. How was the wedding?” There’s the stick of a lollypop protruding from his grinning face, as usual.
“Ever the optimist,” Sam chuckles, impervious to the irony of that statement given Dean’s previous musings. “Have you eaten?”
His companion seems to feel the same way. His breath comes in harsh gasps, face a mix of desire and determination as he fucks into Castiel. He talks the whole way through, his deep and raspy voice uttering praise and filthy compliments. “You feel so damn good,” he says, and Castiel knows he means it because he whispers it almost reverently into the skin of his throat. “I wanna see what you look like when you come,” he demands, his tone stating clearly to Castiel’s ears that there is nothing on heaven or earth that would make him happier. “You’re so fuckin’ sexy,” he groans, and Castiel knows it to be true because you can’t fake that kind of desire.
“It isn’t,” Cas argues, shaking his head softly. “First of all, none of those things have any numbers associated with them. It’s certainly not math.”
Dean is half afraid that Cas is going to press his advantage, is going to seal his lips against Dean’s once more until he loses himself entirely, until he gives in and lets Cas do whatever he wants, despite knowing that it’s all a lie—and he’s half afraid that Cas
It wasn’t that he didn’t want to finish high school; he did. But holding down a job was a little spotty for Dad, what with the drinking, and Dean was determined that Sammy have stability through high school, so somebody needed to pick up the slack. He started short-order cooking at fifteen, taking his paychecks under the table since he was legally too young to work as many hours as he did. Rita, who owned the diner, had a soft spot for the Winchester boys. She didn’t mind when Dean dragged Sam along with him on his shift, just let the kid spread out his books in a corner booth and do his homework. She even insisted on feeding them both dinner before they went home.
awkward), he’d say that his companion’s exact attitude toward the situation is a combination of amusement, curiosity, and above all, arousal. There’s definitely a tent in his pants. That part isn’t up for debate. But there’s also a slow smile on his lips and his eyes are dark. It looks every bit like an invitation, and Cas has never wanted to RSVP more in his life.
“That you did, my friend. Well, let me see. What do we got here, Captain Kansas in the flesh!” Ash wipes his palm on his jeans and reaches out to shake Dean’s hand.
Dean takes pity on him and nods agreeably, getting on board. “Sounds amazing, actually. Honey-glazed ham and biscuits for both of us. And maybe some extra honey for the biscuits?”
” she repeats incredulously. “Benny, where did you find this one? Do I look old enough to be a ma’am now?” Dean cringes.
Like the infuriatingly proper gentleman that he is, Cas breaks the kiss just long enough to speak. “Your dinner is probably cool enough to eat by now,” he ventures, but they both have to know that Dean isn’t focused on dinner at the moment.
“I’ll remember that. Man, I gotta tell you, when Cas told me we were going to see his ‘guy’, I did not expect it to be you.”
“You should absolutely get a dog,” Dean tells him. “You’re basically a big puppy yourself. You guys will get along great.”
Cas laughs, a dark thing that sends shivers up Dean’s spine. “Oh, I remember,” he assures Dean, kissing his mouth, his cheek, his throat. “I just didn’t expect you to show me, not after I blew you off like that.” The tip of Cas’ finger teases close to the head of Dean’s dick, barely contained in the pink satin, but he doesn’t touch yet. “It’s a very pleasant surprise. Take your jeans off so I can see you properly?”
Cas has been working so hard, bordering on exhaustion and testing the limits of his stamina for weeks now. He deserves a nice surprise. He deserves a boyfriend who’s supportive not merely over the phone but in person, too. And he definitely deserves a killer blowjob or twelve.
“Remind me not to cross you,” Dean shoots with a laugh, setting his beer down on the table. He disappears down the hallway towards the bathroom, and as soon as he’s out of earshot, Charlie’s entire demeanor changes. Her mouth, previously sporting a broad grin, flattens into a tight line, and the sparkle goes right out of her eyes, replaced by a dead-eyed stare that, in Castiel’s experience, only truly formidable women can ever properly master. He is not a man easily frightened, but it occurs to him that Charlie might be worthy of terror, or at least startled awe.
First thing in the morning, way earlier than Dean would be awake back home even on a work day, he rolls out of bed and stumbles to the coffee maker. Out of the goodness of his heart, and not at all because he’s worried what kind of an attitude Castiel might have without caffeine in his system, he makes as much coffee as the thing will hold, fills a travel mug, and heads outside. Sam made him stop to grab bait worms at a gas station back towards town, and there’s a couple of rods on the wall, and he hasn’t been fishing since Dad died, so why the hell not. Even as a teenager he found it relaxing, just sitting out on a dock or drifting in a small boat, sun climbing up above the tree tops. Didn’t even matter if they caught anything, which is good because they rarely did, it was just a nice escape. He’s hoping for the same thing now.
"Yeah, but we wanted to surprise you", Dean explained, taking Cas' hand again and pulling him towards his parents.
Anyway, I hope you'll like this new chapter. It's short but I wanted to give you something and I'm still struggling with the first meeting between John and Sam so...enjoy!
"Because I'm awesome, that's why. And I already told you, just consider it my wedding gift. Of course, you're gonna have to share with Sammy, but I guess you'll deal. I'm sure Cassie will be able to tell you that she's real. Now, Dean-o, if you don't mind-"
The Empty started rubbing its hands as it considered Jack’s suggestion. Jack looked back at his fathers to see if his suggestion was acceptable to them as well. Both Sam and Castiel nodded. Dean shrugged. He might be a temporary Angel, but he wouldn’t mind letting the Demons experience a little hell after they died.
Castiel raised his head, looking offended that his head’s peaceful resting place was shaking beneath him, even if it was from joy. “What’s so funny?”
Dean slowly stood on his legs. For a moment, he feared that he would give Bambi a run for his money, but he caught himself on Jack’s shoulder until he found out where he had put his balance.
“Come on, Sammy. When have we ever worked with good ideas?” Dean turned to Jack. “We are going to need some transportation.”
Dean kissed the top of the Angel’s head, where Castiel was leaning against his shoulder. It was a silent ‘thank you’. He could feel Castiel smile against his arm. The mentioning of Castiel’s previous training made Dean think. “Don’t take this the wrong way. But how did the Demon get the drop on you? You’re back on full Angel power, right?”
Dean finally stopped. Cas couldn’t possibly make any sense of what he had just said. It didn’t even make sense to him.
“What is it, Dean?” Castiel suddenly feared that Dean’s previous advancements were keeping him awake. Maybe he regretted it so soon? But it didn’t correspond with Dean’s relaxed state.
When Dean started talking about clowns, Sam cut him off. “Right, right, enough about that. What about you two…” He gestured at the celestial beings. “What have you been up to? How are things working with New Heaven?”
“Because even though we cannot create a brand-new Archangel or bring back one of the original four, there might be a way to… ‘remodel’ an Archangel.” Jack answered carefully, eyes glued to Castiel’s.
Dean tuned out of the Angel-grace-channel and finally focused on Castiel’s face. He felt a cold hand grip his insides. Cas had a bruise with a small cut from where the Demon had hit him. It must have hit him really hard to draw blood. Jack really hadn’t been holding back. Dean raised his hand and tenderly traced the bruise with his thumb.
“If you don’t mind. But take care of yourself first, will ya?” Dean nodded his head towards the bloodied bruise on Castiel’s forehead. He looked on intensely as the Angel’s skin glowed and left no sign of ever having been in contact with the asphalt. Dean let a small laughter slip, but quickly stopped as the movement pulled at the wound “Heh-ah-son-of-a… Damnit. I should be able to do that, right? Heal myself? So why am I slowly bleeding out here?”
“Why did you even keep sleep in Heaven? It’s not really necessary, is it?” Dean yawned again. “It’s annoying.”
When he could finally catch his breath, the severity of the situation hit him, and anger settled into its familiar place in his stomach. He turned it on the kid in front of him. “But you said no more interferences, Jack. You didn’t even tell us that Cas was back! That he was alright! And now you are talking about bringing me back to life? And turning me into a freaking Angel? How the hell is that ‘hands off’!?”
Dean and Sam shared a look. They were outnumbered. Sure, they had God on their side, but they were playing on the Empty’s turf. And for all they knew, Jack and Dean were the only ones with a chance against the Empty Reapers and the Empty itself.
The lightbulbs gave a sudden burst of light, and the bedside lamp broke into pieces, scattering to the floor. They both stared at the now empty spot, wide eyed and out of breath. Dean looked down at the Angel, one eyebrow raised. “That you?”
During one of these drives, Castiel leaned in close to Dean, his warm breath sending thrills down Dean’s spine. “Do you remember the memorabilia in my room?” When Dean made an affirmative sound, Castiel continued. “I kept something from my time on Earth with you as well.”
“Easy now.” Jack laughed. “You should probably get acquainted with your grace first. You don’t have Michael to rely on this time to control your power.”
Castiel was ready to hand in his wings. This made him feel weightless in a way that flight never had. He had been told of the difference between casual hook-ups and love, but he didn’t truly understand the difference until now. Sex with April had been genuinely nice, but he would give it up in a heartbeat for just a second of this. Dean was clearly skilled and attentive, and he already yearned for more.
“No…” Castiel cocked his head in contemplation. “When I first met the Empty, it asked me; ‘What was there before God and the Darkness and creation?’. I answered, ‘nothing’. The Empty is nothing. So, the opposite would be ‘something’.”
Castiel put down the cutlery he had been holding, the fork slightly bended where he had gripped it tightly. “Dean, please. This is none of your concern. You are here to be at peace, not to be caught up in Heaven’s affairs.”
“Dean. You deserve peace. Heaven will be safe now. Don’t worry about it.” Even though Castiel said ‘Heaven’, what he truly meant was himself. And Dean knew that.
Dean continued. “We went on a few small hunts. Guess we couldn’t just quit from one day to the next. But things seemed to slow down when Jack took over. We had whole days as civilians. Finally went to see the Grand Canyon, and - Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh! Dude!” Dean put a hand on Castiel’s arm, stopping to face the Angel, eyes even brighter than when talking about Miracle. “We went to a pie festival!”
When Castiel could no longer hold back, no matter how long we wished this could last, he grabbed Dean’s shoulder. Despite the scar no longer being there, it sent a bolt of electricity through both of them. That spot, where Castiel had first touch Dean, had touched him many times after and had last touched him when alive. It was so casual, and yet so significant that it brought both of them over the edge.
Castiel looked down. That was never a good sign. “What were you thinking when you tried smiting the Demon?”
Another issue for me was that I don’t think that Dean was in love with Castiel throughout the show. He loved him, yes, but he was not
Castiel laughed. The rumbling in his chest tickled Dean’s arm and he couldn’t help but to smile as well, seeing his Angel so happy over something so simple. When he caught his breath, Castiel stammered; “N-No. You said… You called me ‘love’. You said, ‘Wake up, love’.”
“Yes.” Castiel simply answered. He was more worried about the bloodied hand that Dean was still pressing to his side than showing of his living quarters. “Do you need me to heal you?”
He tried to envision it. Suburbs and lawnmowing and a nine-to-five job. He could imagine it, and yet he was unsure if he could have found peace in it, knowing that monsters were still out there. He couldn’t find that peace when living with Lisa. He tried, but one whisper of clatter in a dark alley, and he had gone back into the darkness, gun raised. He never even left the gun behind, not for a single moment.
“Cas… I’m not good at this. And I don’t want to hurt you. And I have no right to ask.” Dean’s voice was muffled by tears and the trench coat. “But if you can find it in yourself to give me a chance… I wasn’t ready before… But I think I am now.”
Dean was sure some telepathic domestic fight was going down right in front of them. “Alright, you two, break it up.” Dean tried a lighter tone, though it fell a bit flat. He focused on the Angel next to him. “Like I said, we want to know what’s going on. And if there’s anything we can do to help… Well, I don’t really know what we can do, being dead and all, but we can still help strategize, you know? This is not the first Big Bad we’ve faced.”
“We don’t know for sure.” Castiel answered. “But as you know, souls are immensely powerful. Our theory is that it is either trying to weaken Heaven and Hell as punishment for my resurrection by taking the souls for itself, or it is trying to collect enough power to attack Heaven.”
“Well, if you are part of ‘The Squad’, I am sure you can fly there yourself.” Castiel corrected his trench coat.
Dean kissed the Angel’s cheek. It was chaste, but Castiel’s heart fluttered, and he once again lost his train of thought. That devious hunter was using unfair tricks.
Dean swallowed for a moment, reining himself in. He wanted to scream it to the world, but he was still nervous if this thing with Cas would work out in the long run. Luck was rarely on his side. “I went to see Cas.” There, no need to elaborate.
If Dean didn’t know any better, he might say that he was getting restless. But you don’t get restless in Heaven. Right? But it was becoming clear that he needed to see Cas.
Dean started to leave but was stopped by his father’s quiet voice. “I know I was hard on you. On both of you. But especially you, Dean. All the things that you and Sam have hunted since my death, are so much bigger than I ever imagined. I’m sorry that you got mixed up in all that.” John looked up at his son’s back. “I am so proud of you. And all I want is for you to be happy. If… If you want to do this… I won’t stop you. And I will help you in any way I can. I’m just… I don’t want to lose you again.”
They all looked up then they descended. Sam was still smiling widely when he looked at them. But it became clear that the youngest Winchester had not told the others anything. Dean watched as each hunter went through the process of putting two and two together, reacting with a mixture of raised eyebrows, grinning smiles and dropped jaws. It was far from the first time Dean and Cas had walked next to each other. Cas could just have popped into his room this morning, couldn’t he? But there must have been something different about them to make everyone react this way.
Sam ignored him. “If nothing predates the Empty, then where did God and The Darkness come from? Did the Empty create them?”
. Neither Winchester brother had demonstrated much dating either. He guessed that Sam had sort of dated Eileen, but Castiel had naturally not been involved in that.
Castiel smiled before continuing, nervously. “However, this is still different from adopting a dog. Though I am indifferent to notions such as gender and sexuality, you have displayed clear preferences in the past...”
The dog had been a comfort in the night. A silent sounding board that Dean bounced his thoughts off when he couldn’t sleep. He was never a guy for therapy, but that damn dog had him talking for hours, turning his nightmares and feelings over like a teenage girl.
Dean nodded, pulling himself together. He stood straighter, preparing himself to try to deliver the words he had been turning over in his head. “Okay. Just promise to hear me out.” Cas nodded his promise, though still not meeting Dean’s eyes. “When you told me that… That you love me… I couldn’t say it back. Because it wouldn’t have been true. Not love in the sense you were looking for, anyway.”
Dean barely registered what happened next. Maybe Cas zapped them somewhere. It didn’t feel as uncomfortable as when he was alive. Maybe this grace thing did have an upside after all.
“What about us?” Sam cut in, looking worried at Dean. He didn’t want to lose him again. Everything had just come together.
Castiel actually blushed at this. “I have not told him yet. For some reason, having this conversation with Jack feels…”
But Castiel cut him off, lights in the dining room flickering from the wrath beneath his short, simple words. “Jack.
Dean reached forward and grabbed Castiel’s hand, caressing it with his thumb. “We’re here. We’re good.”
“Yeah…” Dean leaned into the touch and let his mind drift back to the fight. “I think I get it now, Cas. Jack said that this grace is mine. So, it doesn’t work like an Angel’s grace. It works like me.” Castiel leaned back to watch the hunter as Dean continued, lost in thought. “And I’m not in control. I’m pretty damn far from calm and collected. I try really hard to be. But I’m not. I act before I think. Hell, I rarely think at all. I just go with my gut and run ahead guns blazing. And my grace is no different. It runs on instinct and emotion and… its unstable. The complete opposite of control. When the Empty Reaper was about to attack you again, all that went through my head was to keep you safe. And boom. The Reaper was splattered on the wall. So… The only way for me to control the grace, to make the grace a part of me, as you keep saying… is to let it react to my emotions, instead of trying to bottle it up until it blows up in our faces.”
His father was sitting on the same log that he and Sam had occupied earlier. Dean quietly sat down next to him. He waited for his dad to speak first. Dean was not in the wrong here. He had nothing to explain.
It took his breath away to see himself lying there. The same clothes as the day he died. As if he had just dropped dead on the floor. He was sure that if he were to go and turn over his body, he would see the dried blood from wound in his back. He couldn’t help looking at his brother, but quickly looked away when he saw Sam’s wet eyes.
“Yes.” Castiel answered, not meeting Dean’s eye. It was not like he was completely inexperienced anymore, but for some reason this felt different than with April. It felt important. He quickly added; “If you-“
Dean winced internally at the pain still audible in Sam’s voice after all these years. When they had discovered that he had Demon blood in him, he had felt hunted for how he was born, despite it being of no fault of his. He wasn’t even born like that… but he had felt like it. Hell, Dean had even told him that if he didn’t know him, he would have wanted to hunt him. Those words made his throat burn, even so many years later. Dean swallowed. “You’re right. But we can’t risk the whole freaking universe for this. So, what do we do?”
“Uhm…” Jack looked back at Dean. His facial expression made it clear that he had not thought this far ahead. Of course, the Angels would sense the grace of an Archangel among them. The power must have rippled through Heaven. Jack seemed to make a quick decision. “Yes and no… I will inform you about the details at tomorrows information meeting. I promise. Until then, please return to your duties.”
“No problem.” Dean answered automatically. He looked over the Reaper’s shoulder at the balled-up soul of the shooting victim. “Hey pal! Piece of advice? Go with her.”
The Empty Reaper was clearly visible to the Reaper, who desperately launched at the shadow with a small scythe. But the Empty Reaper just let the weapon hit and go right through it, leaving a rift in the blackness for a moment before closing again.
What if Cas had told him earlier, or in a non-life-or-dead situation, what would he have done? Probably laughed it off to begin with. He would have pushed Cas away, been an undesirable ass. Before Cas’ sacrifice, he would probably not have been able to accept anyone’s love. He had long ago given up on that. After Lisa… Hunting and love just didn’t go hand-in-hand. But now? He could still not make himself say that he was actually worthy of this kind of love, or any kind really. But he could admit that he wanted it. And looking back, he could see how happy he had been with Cas. How they easily laughed together, how exciting it had been to introduce the Angel to the world of man. How he had often admitted things to Cas that he could never share with Sam or anyone else. But was it enough? It was hard feeling in love with someone when he had not been open to the idea at the time when he had the chance.
Castiel sensed the rise of panic in Dean. He could see how Dean desperately wanted to say something, but as usual, words did not come easy when feelings were attached to them. Castiel therefore clapped Dean’s hand on his left shoulder, practically tapping him out, letting him know it was alright. With a knowing smile he said: “Let’s go for a walk.”
Lastly, in the preface I mentioned that I liked the ending of the show. I do, except for two things; 1) Mentioning Castiel so casually and meaninglessly. I think I already fixed that in this fic. 2) Sam’s aging. Wow, time was not kind to him. Saying that, I completely understand when fans reacted with saying “They deserved better”. Damn straight, our heroes deserved better. Beach, Hawaii shirts, the whole nine yards. But. Sometimes life just sucks. I lost my grandmother two months before watching the finale. So, when I watched it, I just thought: Yeah. That is what life is sometimes. It is not always fair, it is not always happy and you don’t always get what you deserve or need. Our boys have been fighting for all their lives and died multiple times already. At some point, something had to give. So, no, it is not the ending I wanted or hoped for, but I think it was brave and true to the show. I guess I sort of hate-loved it, because it spoke to me and understood me at a dark point in my life.
Jack happily started relaying about the changes they had made, most of which they were already aware of through personal experience. He told them about creating new Angels, both from human souls and from scratch, how it was a complex process, but very fulfilling. He told them about a new, promising cooperation with Hell with Rowena as its queen. The witch drove a hard bargain but was not unfair and understood that a good relation with Heaven good secure her a long reign.
Dean swallowed and nodded his understanding. Well, he guessed that he understood what Castiel meant but how it was going to work in practice was still a bit foggy. Still, he remembered how Jack has wrestled with his powers when he was born, and how he had hurt people without meaning to. He wanted to avoid that at all costs.
Castiel told him that he could move into a heavenly room of his own and decorate it however he liked. “You wanted to move out from your parents’ house. This is probably not what you had in mind, but none the less, it will be your own.” Castiel blushed and avoided eye contact when he continued. “Or… you could move in with me. If you want to. I mean… We don’t really need a place to sleep, but a place to rest is nice. A place to just be… us.”
Human Heaven was not the only thing that had changed. The throne room was no longer a throne room, and it was no longer serene, cold, and white. It was now a circle of comfortable chairs, a warm, round wooden table in the middle. The walls were filled with bookshelves with old volumes of classical literature and tomes of long-lost history.
“I’m alr-…” No, stop. Bad, old habits. “I… I don’t know. It’s all a bit fuzzy.” Dean blinked, tried to focus.
Or maybe Dean didn’t need him anymore. Miracle had been a reminder of the good in the world. That good things still happened. That even though most people were a little messed up, there was still pure, good beings on Earth, when Dean thought that he had lost everything but his brother.
Dean was shocked. Not only was Jack asking something huge of him, something that he for all in the world wanted to decline, but his dad had just stood up for him. Sure, John Winchester had always had his son’s backs, kept them alive, but he had never been one to keep them out of the line of fire. Hell, the man had raised them – especially Dean – as hunters and soldiers. Instead of throwing ball in the park, they spend their weekends practicing covering their tracks in a forest, picking locks and cleaning weapons. ‘Werewolf in Virginia? I’m busy, but I’ll send my 16-year-old kid to help. No problem.’ Now, his dad had listened to God ask for their help and pretty much told him to stick it where the sun doesn’t shine.
“Yes, but the Seraphim were created from the energy of God. Our smiting abilities can only hurt but not kill these Empty Reapers, neither can a normal angel blade.” Castiel explained, a spirit of inadequacy settling over him.
“Hi Jack.” Was muttered by the group. Everyone was too focused on the body in front on them to make a real effort.
“And you are too stupid to pray to him because you are already panicking.” Damnit, did Sam have to be so insightful?
“Sam.” Jack said in a warning tone. They had not had a lot of time to plan this alternative counterattack, but they had gotten what they came for. They just needed to agree with the Empty not to interrupt each other anymore and go back to Heaven, safe and sound.
Before Dean could shake it off, the Empty Reaper attacked again, this time sending a black, solid, thin spear at him. Dean ducked just in time, but the spear still grazed his side. And sonofabitch that hurt.  He growled in pain and grabbed his side, feeling warm liquid covering his hand.
This small noise was enough to wake the sleeping hunter, trained through a lifetime to react to even the smallest of sounds and changes around him. First, his eyes snapped open. In less than a second, he registered Castiel’s tense body and how his eyes were glued to the door, and then he reacted by quickly turning towards the door himself, one arm roaming under his pillow for a gun that was no longer there.
Eileen and Mary agreed to help as well. As everyone dug their noses into a book, Dean pulled Cas a bit to the side. “Cas, can we talk?” He didn’t wait for an answer but started walking towards the stairs. Cas quickly followed.
“That... was two questions, Sammy.” Dean teased, pointing a finger at his brother, receiving an exasperated look in return.
Suddenly, every hunter and ally they had ever known popped into the Empty. The desolate darkness was immediately filled with people; filled with colours from their clothes, with sound from their chattering, and movement from their studying of the strange place.
Dean looked down between them and was hit by a wave of nerves. This was uncharged territory and they had to agree on some… boundaries and logistics. One look at the Angel, and Castiel just smiled. “You won’t hurt me.”
He heard steps behind him and looked up to see the Reaper approaching. She looked confused, apparently still unable to see the Empty Reaper, even if it was just black batter sliding down brick. “Is it gone?”
Something was different about sleeping, though. He didn’t dream. It was like closing his eyes, and just waking up seven hours later feeling well-rested. It might have worried some people that they didn’t dream, but for Dean, it was a relief. Not even overthrowing Chuck had taken away his nightmares. He was still haunted by the people that he couldn’t save, the wrong decisions that he had made and the friends that he had lost along the way. Sometimes it got so bad that Miracle would wake him in the middle of the night, worried so much about his distressed owner that he would crawl into the bed, even though he knew he was not allowed - unless Dean specifically allowed it, which happened more than he would ever admit.
Jack turned back to the Empty, but he let his tough exterior fall and instead asked calmly, almost pleadingly: “Can we talk? Please?”
The Empty Reaper turned towards him. Despite its smooth, featureless surface, it seemed to be contemplating him, wondering how he could see it.
Everyone seemed to forget about the Empty, even in these black, bare surroundings. They were all here, together. They were all that mattered. A family unrelated by blood, whose paths had crossed because of a pair of wayward brothers. They had all amounted to something much bigger than themselves due to the sacrifices and bravery of the Winchesters. So, when asked if they would come to the end of the universe to raise a little mayhem, they had had no doubts nor hesitations.
“You collected them on Earth?” Dean looked down at the grace shining into the wound in his side, erasing cut, blood, and all.
And here he was now. Looking at his little brother for permission to do what would grant him peace. Because he knew his decision would disappoint his family. But if his little brother would be okay… then everything would be okay.
“Amen, brother.” Dean finally stepped away from Sam. He hadn’t realised how close they had been standing. Was this another Angel symptom? Erasure of the concept of personal space?
Dean pulled back with a small smile. “I know, Cas. It was written all over your face. I won’t lie. I was a bit angry… still am… but not because of the Archangel thing. But because you didn’t tell me about the Empty and the Empty Reapers sooner. You were out there, fighting them all this time, but you didn’t tell me?”
At that moment, everyone around the table seemed to erupt, as if their reactions had been delayed and finally caught up to them.
“Yeah, but how-“ Dean didn’t get to finish his sentence. One moment he stood talking to Jack, the next he opened his eyes looking up at the ceiling. He took in a desperate breath, filling his lungs in what felt like the first time in forever. His muscles felt odd, sore, unused.
Castiel’s smile turned sad. “I’m sorry, but I didn’t hear you. Prayers do not reach the Empty, and Jack has decided to be less hands-on, including shutting down communication between Heaven and Earth. For now, at least.”
“Then how about we make a deal?” Jack asked with a friendly smile. “Allow me to take my Angels home. I will provide a new, peaceful resting place for them. But I don’t have the power to take in all these spirits. So, we will let the Demons and celestial beings who lost their way come to you. You will have fewer spirits in your realm, and hopefully it will be quieter for you. But you will not show them any more regret or despair. Just… just give them… nothing.”
Dean reciprocated but removed both the trench coat and blazer in one smooth movement. He then proceeded to remove the crooked tie, untying the knot, and sliding the tie slowly around the Angel’s neck. Castiel blinked at the movement. It was not the first time that his tie had been removed, but this time, it left tickling electricity in its way.
“I’ll get it.” Sam jumped up from his seat. First, they just heard Sam’s steps moving towards the door, but as soon as the door handle turned, it was replaced by a loud, happy exclamation.
“Alright, I’m going to stop you right there.” Sam retreated his comforting arm and replaced it with a pointed finger that he used to emphasise his statement. “You two have been to Hell and back, like, literally. You have hurt each other, and not always seen eye to eye. But no matter what, you always forgive each other. I have never seen you care for anyone like you do for Cas. This development between you doesn’t even surprise me, because, seriously… No one has ever understood each other like you two do. And don’t get me started on all the staring and silent communication that went on between you two all the damn time.”
Castiel laughed heartedly as Dean in detail told him about the day at the festival. He could hear that it was not just about the pie – though Dean in detail rated each tasting that he had had –  but had also been a step towards normalcy. Civilian life, as Dean called it. Doing something normal together as brothers. A day without monsters and worries.
“So, God might just be a… mutation of this force? And not actually be made of the force itself?” Sam thought out loud.
“I should have died back then.” Dean stated matter-of-factly. Castiel whipped his head up, about to disagree, but Dean continued. “It was the first time I was given a death sentence. I mean, I had close calls before that. It’s just part of the job. But this time, they told me that I was actually gonna die. Or at least I should have until Sam heard about an actually functioning faith healer. He pretty much carried my ass to one of the sessions, and I couldn’t keep my mouth shut because it all seemed so stupid, you know? But Roy picked me and healed me. On my first day there. Other people had waited for weeks. People who deserved it so much more than me. I was just running my stupid mouth…” Dean cleared his throat and licked his lips before continuing. “There was this girl with a brain tumour. I don’t even know if she made it, found another cure or something. We stopped the preacher’s wife before she was healed. I almost didn’t do it, but… Someone else was going to die if we didn’t stop the healing. This girl actually believed in God, in Chuck. She believed so much. And he just screwed her over like that. Just to mess with us.”
But more time to himself also meant more time to think of Cas. He started debating whether or not to try to pray to the Angel. It had seemed easier when he thought the Angel was dead. Painful, but easier. To speak into the emptiness, quite literally. Even though his time after the Angel’s sacrifice had been fairly short, it had been plenty of time to think about his dying words again, again, again and again. And plenty of time to come up with hundreds of could-have-should-have-would-have-answers. He still felt confused, and maybe a talk with the Angel would help. Maybe it wouldn’t.
Jack sent a flash of light at the Angels, healing their wounds and boosting their graces. Then, he snapped his fingers and the library appeared in front of them.
It finally hit Dean. He was the only one who could see the Empty Reaper right now. It must have hidden itself from the others when Cas arrived. Jack’s assumption had been right. Finally, something was going their way. He turned towards the solid shadow. “Hey! Ink spot! Get the hell away from them!”
The Demon pulled its head away and turned around, grinning. “What’s the matter, feathers? Can’t get it up?”
It had all taken so much work and diplomacy that Castiel had not yet truly considered that he would one day have to face Dean again. Dean was going to live a long, happy life. He had plenty of time to not worry.
The peace was abruptly broken by the bedroom door carefully creaking open, revealing the younger Winchester with a grin and a tall glass of water. Judging by the condensation on the glass, the water must have been freezing cold. For a fleeting moment, Castiel wondered what Sam was doing with this glass in Dean’s bedroom. He could not remember Sam ever bringing his older brother such a beverage before in the morning.
Things calmed down after the big reunion party. Dad took Sam and him fishing. They all went hunting for non-monstrous game, like ordinary civilians. They visited old friends. He and dad took long drives in Baby, just for the enjoyment of the ride. They would tinker with the engine late into the night. Sam and he would sit out at night watching the stars, sharing a beer. They had family dinners.
John had been remarkably quiet during the whole exchange. Now, he slammed his fist down on the tabletop, making porcelain and cutlery rattle, and effectively silenced the room. He fixed Jack with a piercing glare and hissed. “Enough! I’m not going to listen to any more of this. I don’t care about your celestial war. Me and my family have done more than enough for this world. We have fought and died for the cause.” Now he pointed a finger at Dean, anger immediately replaced by something softer. “My boy… My boy already gave his life. He’s given everything! So don’t you dare come drag him back in just because you pissed off this Empty thing. That’s on you!” John pushed back his chair and stood. “I think you should say your goodbyes and leave.” He looked pointedly at both Jack and Castiel, then left the room. The backdoor slammed seconds later.
