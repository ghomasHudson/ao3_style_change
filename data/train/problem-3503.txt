“Sam, I found something. I think I found something about Cas and Dean,” Eileen signed earnestly.
Dean reached out and grabbed Cas’s wrist. The machine monitoring Cas’s heartbeat was still beeping away but the pulse beneath his own fingertips felt strong. He knew in that moment.
“You’re secretly a Disney villain and know that the mouse doesn’t allow for on screen murders anymore?”
Cas had bad days too. He was entitled to a few of them due to his age Dean would joke the next day when Cas walked around on eggshells. When the look of distance and being lost began to cross Cas’s face, Dean would do everything in his power to stop it in his tracks. Sometimes he wasn’t successful and was left picking up the pieces of Cas. Sometimes he was successful and Cas would lean on Dean when he needed reminding that things would be okay. Maybe the same way Cas would save Dean, Dean could save Cas.
Dean was nervous and he wasn’t even apologizing to the actual Cas. Historically, Winchesters weren’t used to giving apologies but if he continued on the path he was on he was going to lose Cas for good. That was a pain that only came second to Sam dying in his arms many years ago and Cas laid up in the hospital bed almost dying. Dean Winchester may suck at apologies but maybe Dean Smith did apologize when he was wrong.
With the cold, early winter air nipping at any exposed skin, Dean ushered Cas and Sam inside. They needed to get things unloaded and were able to get most of the boxes and furniture into the house before the sun started to set. They then ran into town to get a few more things from the local thrift store including a cheap couch and the basic necessities from the local grocery story. The night was spent organizing, adding wards, and getting Jack set up.
Dean was confused now and asked on instinct, “Hurt your family? What are you talking about?”
“Damn straight. Baby appreciates your apology. You still didn’t answer my question about what is so important that you absolutely need the truck tomorrow.”
“Wow, thanks Jack! This is a great gift. Why don’t you get back on the field and play soccer?” Cas said with sincerity as he held his little dandelion with care.
Shame instantly creeped into Sam. He felt bad for interrupting Eileen. He wasn’t that type of guy but the words just came out. He looked at her apologetically and she smiled at him. Eileen knew he was flustered and he hadn’t meant to interrupt her on purpose.
“Listen to me, Castiel. I introduced you to my family. I met your friends who threatened to kill me if I hurt you. And I believe they would. I spend every weekend and most nights in your apartment with you. I text you everyday and everynight. I love hearing you talk about things you are passionate about including your work. I love your cats like they are my own. Since I met you, I haven’t thought of or so much looked at another person. From the moment you said my name in that bar, I've been lost to you and only you.When you told me you were going on a date, I thought you were breaking up with me. I want to start or continue to date you or whatever this is as long as you'll let me. I fell hard for you, Cas, and I'm not about to lose you again. I love you and I want to date you."
“Oh Dean, you poor, feeble-minded boy. I was just popping in for a visit before the real action started. You know when the demons finally get in or whatever is waiting on the other side of that catches up to your friends, you’re going to need a reaper or two. But that won’t include me because I’m no longer just a reaper and that’s all thanks to you”
It had been hard to forgive him for a while but they had long since moved on. Dean had betrayed and lied to Cas plenty of times since then including the particularly painful moment when he kicked the first human iteration of Cas out of the bunker. Dean still blamed himself for Cas nearly dying for good when April stabbed him. Cas really needed to stop almost dying on him. Dean would saw off his good leg in his freshly cleaned car right now if he never had to watch Cas almost die again.
“How much did you, uh, read?” Dean asked. He silently begged she had never read about any of his full-frontal encounters.
Dean thought. He could admit that maybe good wasn’t the word for it but it was better than the past few days. Yet, Dean and his stupid leg had ruined it.
Sam disagreed. Whenever Dean or Cas mentioned the honey and bees, it was always mentioned together. Cas never mentioned it as solely being his and said that Dean helped a lot. But Dean never was one to take credit no matter how involved he was.
When they entered the garden and plant section that was nestled in the outdoor section of the store, Cas was immediately drawn to some sort of plant near the edge of the fence. It was quiet outside and Dean was surprised that their little family was the only one in the garden section. Cas started ignoring Dean almost immediately as he read the label and requirements on the pot. He slowly moved down the line evaluating the quality of each plant until he was about 10 feet from where Dean had stopped with Jack. Dean lost interest so he let his eyes wander as Jack started using his little hands to play with Dean’s. Dean let him play and glanced outside the fence to the parking lot. He caught sight the Impala and the Mustang still waiting patiently in their respective spots. Dean squinted trying to see if other cars nearby were properly spaced apart.
“I’m Dean. This is Jack,” Dean returned with a nod down at Jack.
“Too bad,” Dean bit out.
Everything about Sam said he wanted to argue but resigned himself, “Fine. I came by to see if you were back and give you the itinerary for the next week. You don’t have to do anything that you don’t want to do. It’s up to you but if you want to help and give your experience to the new hunters I would appreciate it. If you want to do none of it, I also understand. One favor I do need is I need your opinion on a case when you got time. It’s the first case I’m sending some of the new hunters on and I want to make sure that they won’t run into something unexpected. I didn’t want to ask but it’s a safety concern so…”
“That’s it, Dean. Maybe they don’t have to
Time ticked slowly as Eileen read his writing and then reread it. She had a look of concentration on her face.
Dean let out a sigh of relief, “Well now that that’s settled. Who wants breakfast?”
“Oh, thank you.”
“Barely,” Sam replied.
Sam thought with an immense feeling of guilt.
“You don’t have to make a decision right now. Just promise me you’ll think about it. Really think about coming with Jack and me,” Cas’s eyes bore into him. He looked timid but hopeful too. It was like Cas was worried about rejection.
Dean did however keep his cool. They were expecting him to freak out which is why they had gone behind his back again. It was why they planned it before talking to him. It was why they cleared the room. His family thought he was a bomb waiting to explode.
Welcome to Chapter 2!
“Alright, that’s enough of that,” Dean interjected as Cas opened his mouth to answer. Dean snatched the phone from Cas’s hand rudely.
Charlie and Bobby had seventeen others with them in the room including Perla for their faction. They all looked much better since most of them had a chance to shower and change into the cheap sweatpants and shirts Donna had purchased at the local supercenter. She had wiped out the entire section and it still hadn’t been enough. Then again, they brought twice the amount of people that had been estimated. For the most part, he trusted Charlie and Bobby. Charlie had already gone to bat for them. Bobby seemed to have the same core values as their Bobby. Faction two understandably put a lot of distance between themselves and the third group in the room.
Dean rubbed his hand through his hair and looked to Jack for a moment. He could lie and say that they landed there randomly. Cas deserved better than that though. Guess it was time to let the cat out of the bag.
The next dive down Cas gathered 40 more angels who had been tried and tested with fire.
Sam watched the scene carefully. It wasn’t often he got new learning experiences of the non-deadly, non-trying-to-eat-you-alive type. Dean had put on a pair of well-used and thick gloves to pull the new hive out of the back of the truck. It looked like a larger than an average two drawer filing cabinet but it was made of wood. It appeared to have two handles could pull open the respective drawers but that wasn’t what they were. The handle was a wooden piece screwed into the box and slightly above that was a metal sliding component that could open a door small enough for bees to crawl through when in the open position. The bottom appeared to be a removable tray.  The top of the box was a large and carefully crafted lid that could be pulled off the top.
“Yes, and any unused vegetables we produce.”
“When things get more settled, then I can come back here more. Or when you need me, I’ll drive out here sooner than planned too.”
Checking his outrage at people who didn’t even exist, Dean wanted to make sure Cas was certain of his decision so he said, “Dude, that’s so depressing. Are you sure that’s the route you want to take?”
The thing about Cas and Dean was that if they were Cas&Dean then Sam thought he would have at least heard about it at some point.
Not surprisingly, everyone at the table had picked up on Dean’s foul mood and quickly shifted to talk away from the hunt. They must have though Dean was jealous of Sam returning to hunting. While there was some bitterness still there from that, the truth of the matter was that Sam got to leave and come back and his title never wavered while Dean was with Jack everyday and was still nothing as far as Cas thought.
Jack looked tired but made happy noises when he saw Cas. His little arms moved excitedly and a bubble appeared on his lips from babbling. Cas positively beamed at Jack in his arms. The blue in his eyes seem brighter and the skin around his eyes crinkled. Cas brought Jack closer and pressed a kiss against Jack’s temple. Dean shifted closer to Cas to get a better look at Jack which Cas mimicked in response to let him see Jack easier.
“She was like our little sister.”
Cas shrugged noncommittally so Dean pressed, “Cas, I need input here. Yes, no, maybe. I’m not building this fake life alone. You get a fresh start.”
"Wow. So all of that had to happen just so you and Sam could stop the apocalypse and meet Cas one day."
Naomi eyes flashed in irritation, and she looked at Charlie on the table before he waved her hands for the angels to take Eileen and Charlie away. One of the angels holding Eileen pushed her forward in a gesture for her to lead while the other gripped her arm tightly.
Cas nodded and Dean felt his should relax a little under his fingertips. The guy was still on edge despite Dean’s assurances so Dean held his shoulder a little longer before letting go.
Dean knew she wasn’t actually flirting with him and recognized the flirtatious behavior as nothing more than attempt to get someone to do something you want. Dean used it while hunting to get people to talk to him. He would do this with people he met at bars who took an interest in him even when he wasn't dressed in his FBI getup. Mackenzie was using it to get Dean to listen to her. Maybe Mackenzie had more going that head of hers besides her upbeat attitude.
“Rowena, we may have a spell from the Demon tablet, it needs four ingredients. Three of which we don’t have here in the bunker.”
“For everything. For taking Jack’s grace. For running-”
“In my defense, we were running out of time and I apologized later.”
Two months in and it was practically a weekly neighborhood event with Bruiser and an embarassed Dean serving as entertainment. Neighbors would come out to their front steps to watch Dean and Bruiser on their path of destruction. It was unusual but most people seemed to enjoy watching the bulldog in his element.
Every glimpse burnt his brain like a red-hot brand. An arm here, a claw there, and so many colorful wings would filter into his field of vision before disappearing just as quickly as they appeared. Their wings were so different from Cas’s. They were full like the first lightning show Cas had shown him in the barn. Their true forms were bright like the sun and Cas’s form seemed much dimmer in comparison. Nothing in their true forms called to Dean.
Jack blew raspberries when Dean’s phone pinged stopping their conversation short. Looking at his phone, Dean said to Cas, “Sam wants a meeting in the war room at 3pm. He asked that we both be there. He apparently wants to debrief before that too so don’t make any plans today.”
Pretending to make eye contact with Cas without looking in his eyes, Dean spoke calmly, “Is Jack good for the night?”
“We were attacked by some punk angels who were here to kidnap Jack.”
“I’m good, promise.”
some demon in Dean’s brain said to him forcing him to sigh with resolve and begin to gently shake Cas awake.
Dean glanced around to check his surroundings. His eyes landed on Cas and Eileen still in line at the concession stand and he smirked dangerously. Sam felt that he was being let in on a juicy secret and leaned forward to listen.
Dean choked on a piece of licorice when Mackenzie said screwing and unscrewing. She held out a water bottle for Dean to take. He unscrewed (ugh) the lid and took a few long swallows. He didn’t like the sound of at home-care but he wasn’t going to argue until he heard more about it.
“I heard.”
Dean wanted to talk about Jack too and was tired of being left out of the conversation. Mackenzie kept accidentally sending Dean into a tail spin and Cas had pulled the wool over his eyes with the "partner" thing. Jack was easy to talk about. He knew Jack and Jack didn’t confuse him.
The hardwood floors were salvageable but needed some not-so-gentle TLC which Dean had all the time in the world to do now that he was retired. YouTube became his best friend and most opened tab on his phone as he learned how to replace crumbling boards, seal cracks, and refinish the hardwood to make it shine. He also found a channel for how to fix the small things around the house by a dad who wanted to teach everyone small life skills. He even ended up watching videos for repairs he would never do simply because the guy was awesome to watch.
Dean turned and picked up a glass of water. He held it up to Cas’ lips. Cas drank deeply, starting slightly when a few drops fell onto his bare skin. When he finished, he glanced down at his naked chest, with the blanket coming halfway up his torso. He looked back to Dean with a smirk.
“Benny!!!!” All four of them chorused.
“No, Cas, you don’t. If you aren’t where I need you to be, I’m going to expose you and your current work to Interpol.” Cas’ face dropped. “That elite Triple A status that you want back so badly, I’ll make sure you never get near it.”
“I’m not offering, I’m telling you. I have a job I need you to do.” Dean closed the bathroom door.
Cas glanced at him briefly. “It itched.”
Dean went from tree to tree along the street, dropping multiple bad guys as he went.
When Dean was completely spent, he half collapsed onto Cas again, still gasping. Dean wanted to stay buried in his Cas for as long as possible, so he didn’t pull out just yet. His lips found Cas’ skin, pressing tender kisses everywhere he could reach. Dean felt Cas’ shaking arms still around his head. He leaned up to look happily into Cas’ eyes, when he saw something there he couldn’t quite place. Dean looked at him in confusion for a second, leaning on both elbows beside Cas’ head so he could peer down at him properly, cocking a questioning eyebrow as he ran his fingers through Cas’ sweaty hair.
The lift pinged as he reached his floor. Away with his thoughts, he didn't notice Charlie and Garth or the smile they exchanged as he entered his office. He quickly ducked back out to marvel at the beautifully decorated main office. Charlie and Garth had really outdone themselves, the place was fabulous. The budgeting for such a display was not his problem so he gave a happy sigh before heading back in to finish off his last few emails and signing offs so that it could properly be Christmas.
“I believe I know where Winchester is.”
Dean laughed, “Naw, I’ll shoot you with this one.” He pulled out another small one in jest, just as the spare arsenal of weapons in the boot of Cas’ car started going off from the heat of the fire, shooting out towards them. Cas and Dean immediately dropped to the ground, unsure at first of what was happening.
“Where—“ He made to sit up.
A mini-bus came out of the darkness behind them, the driver pulled up with the window already down. “Need a ride?”
This earned another sigh as the guy closed his eyes. “I was afraid of that.” He flinched as Garth scared the next round of visitors.
Dean knelt down, chin on the blanket, looking Cas in the eyes, giving his best puppy dog stare and pout. He stroked Cas’ intertwined fingers with his free hand. “Will you wait for me, Cas? Even though I don’t actually know how long my sentence is….. But Gabriel should be able to tell you that.”
“Are you ok?”
"Oh, yeah, sure, here you go."
Rowena smirked at him, kissing him on the cheek. “That’s not all he’s got. Now go! Come see me again when you’re out of prison.”
Gabriel nodded. “Yeah.”
“No. I saved my client.”
Once they had deemed enough time had passed to evade any suspicion or accusations of collusion, six months to be exact, things swung into motion. The little family took a trip to Cuba, ostensibly to set up a new company field office HQ there for any Latin America jobs that swung their way.
Cas got up and walked away, his conscience getting the better of him, much to his own disgust.
“I’m sorry, Cas, that you’ve had a rough patch.”
All four helped Cas from the hospital on the day of his discharge, Cas glaring at Gabriel when he managed to somehow get his wheelchair up in a wheelie. Cas and Sam got on very well, feeling like they already knew each other. Sam especially felt this way, after hearing about Cas for several years. They all went back to the UK, where Dean was now in prison.
“Motherfucker please. I’ve eaten hamburgers that know more about human interaction than you. You, my friend, are a close relationship idiot.”
The guy looked around, noticed Dean staring at him (Dean hadn't been quick enough to look away) gave a little grin and blush to himself as he continued looking around. As Dean came back to himself, he saw that Charlie and Garth appeared to not notice his open-mouthed lapse. Fantastic.
Dean felt around Cas’ back where the bullet should have come out. “Fuck, there’s no exit wound. That bullet’s still in you.” He had lifted his hands to get a better look, ripping open the shirt a little. Dean swallowed uneasily when he saw how deep the wound was. “Cas?”
Chuck Dukhovich and his personal army arrived at a remote run down house. They began searching and trashing the place as Garth Asimov sat shaking at the kitchen table. A guard stood at each shoulder. Garth began to shake even more as Chuck sat across from him, staring at him without blinking.
The agent wiped his nose, staring at Dean with fury in his eyes.
The other goon came at Dean with a knife, who dodged easily, caught his wrist, broke it, took the knife, punched him, and shoved him face first into a large metal pillar. Dean then stabbed him in the back for good measure, pulling out the knife with satisfaction.
Almost on cue, Rowena burst into the room with a loaded tray. Her vibrant red hair flowed freely, as she wore a long red silk robe with black fur trim.
“Interpol protocol. When that phone rings and nobody answers, they’re going to send officers to the door.” He looked out to see lights and then heard the sirens. “And there they are.”
“What happened? Lose your edge? Drop focus? Did you slip up and let a client get popped?”
Chuck looked between Metatron and Zach, eventually giving a tiny nod, taking the pen. Zach broke into a wide grin, looking to Metatron gloatingly. He opened the folder to the right document. Chuck moved like an animal, grabbing Zach’s hand, plunging the pen deep into the flesh behind his knuckles. Zach roared in pain. Chuck kept a tight hold of his wrist, keeping his hand in place while he dug and twisted, his face right up to Zach’s, boring into him with crazed eyes.
“Cas, buddy, you with me?” He patted Cas’ cheek slightly.
“Ok.” He grabbed the gun from Dean’s grasp, tossing it onto the unconscious bad guys. “That’s very loud.”
Alastair stepped over his friend and leapt through too. He swore when he saw the metal tray discarded on the ground. It had stopped all of his bullets. He looked around, but Cas was already most of the way down the block, ducking into another doorway. Crowds milled about, screaming. Alastair shot in the air a few times to get the people out of his way.
Cas raised his eyebrows, turning his gaze to the car next to it. Dean followed his eyes, his face falling as Cas had clearly chosen the very non-Jaguar, very plain Ford next door. “Awh, no, Cas! Really?”
Gabriel looked away, setting his jaw, scrolling through his contact list.
“Yes it does.” Dean rubbed along his own scruff. “How far we going?”
“Well, that’s true.” Dean leaned down just enough to ghost his lips along Cas’, earning him a desperate whimper. Dean watched Cas’ scrunched up eyes and breathless pants as he trailed a tongue along his lips softly. Deciding to take pity on him at last, Dean simultaneously snapped his hips forward and met Cas’ lips hard. Cas moaned into Dean’s mouth in unabashed desire, meeting Dean’s tongue thrusts as he rutted back. They were unable to stop their desperate kisses this time, devouring each other like life itself.
“That’s what she said!”
Kurasawa nodded at him with a smile.
Cas looked up to the sound of a car horn. Dean was grinning at him from the battered car through the open door. He looked unscathed, bright and cheery, unlike the car. “Hey! You about done? Tick tock, Cas!”
Gabriel was standing nearby, arms crossed, frowning down at Cas. “If Dukhovich is acquitted, he’s back in power next week. I won’t let that happen.”
Cas quickly came to an underground metro station, running down the steps. He ran through the subway tunnel, looking back over his shoulder to see three Belarusians chasing him. He vaulted over the ticket turnstile like a hurdle.
“Shit! He didn’t expose your client.
She ushered him back into the room, closing the door after him.
could you have known that..? You were protecting him? But I didn’t see you there that day. Cas…?”
His eyes suddenly snapped up to meet Dean’s. Dean swallowed hard, but didn’t look away. Cas looked back to his phone without comment, then pocketed it and continued to dress, much to Dean’s chagrin.
Diane jotted everything down. “It’s apple today.”
The convoy arrived at an empty runway at London City airport, where a private jet sat waiting. Cas pulled right up to the stretch of blue carpet that led to the plane. There were four more Triple A Protection vehicles, with six more of Cas’ team standing in front of them, flanking the length of carpet. The helicopter hovered nearby. Cas killed the car engine, turning to his client. “Shall we?”
“In this trial, the world community is attempting to make a statement, well now, I would like to make a statement of my own.” He ignored the constant banging of the gavel.
Dean smiled at him gently as a chorus of “awhs” came from the back seat. Cas blushed and looked at his gift bag that he was hugging to himself again.
Cas nodded to him. “Thank you!” He slowly bent down, picked up the gun, and lined up his shot on Alastair’s back without looking. He shot him three times. None of the bullets came out the other side. Front facing body armour, amateur. Cas left go of the chain, Alastair dropping heavily to the ground. Cas tossed the gun behind him, doubling over in pain and collapsing onto the ground on his hands and knees. He was panting deeply, chest heaving, arms shaking.
“Lovely. How about some proper chow?”
When they reached the parking lot, he saw Sam, Jess and Charlie near a big black muscle car. Dean swept his hand towards the car majestically. “Castiel, meet my Baby. Ain’t she pretty?”
Several agents went for their guns, some caught Cole, while others roughly took hold of Dean.
The firing soon stopped, but Cas still looked back at his boot distrustfully. Dean surfaced next to him. Cas gave him a defeated look. “There goes the guns.”
Cas burst into a small restaurant, panting, sweaty, eyes roving the place wildly. He moved back into the kitchen, cursing when he saw there wasn’t a back door or other way out. He picked up the closest thing to him, a rolling pin. He gave it a twirl in his hand, loosening his neck and shoulder, getting ready behind the kitchen door.
“One more in the east office on the 6th floor, under construction…” He remembered shoving a face into the hanging reams of plastic sheeting, flipping him over and kneeing him into the face.
Dean was happy to sit in relaxed silence too, but the road was straight, the Netherlands flat. Windmills and tulip fields didn’t have a patch on the smoking hot bodyguard sitting next to him. Dean’s hand twitched, wanting to reach over and grab Cas’, but he kept stopping himself. Cas had only just believed that Dean liked him, but it didn’t mean Cas liked him back. Cas needed to figure this out, and Dean was happy to wait. If he spent the time stealing prolonged glances of Cas’ handsome profile, lingering on his beautiful neck when Cas wasn’t looking, that was entirely his own business.
When they were done, Cas sat back with a happy sigh. He refilled his cup, gulping it back. Dean used some bread to wipe his plate, moaning around the final bites. Diane was over like a shot. “And how was that? Ready for your pie now, honey?”
The door opened but no sass followed it. Puzzled, Dean looked up and gave a little flinch. Cas was standing there nervously holding some prints. "I'm sorry to disturb you but…."
He could see now that he knew the truth, how their past encounters had been wrongly interpreted by him. Dean had indeed looked absolutely horrified when he’d skimmed Cas’ shoulder with his shot in Prague. Dean hadn’t ever attacked him directly, not once. He had just kind of been there in certain situations before disappearing without a trace. Cas had always assumed he had won or scared him off. He laughed slightly at his own misplaced pride.
Cas grinned. “Oh, is that so? You sure?” Dean nodded again.
“Just a whole load of Dutch buildings, although the Rijksmuseum is right across the canal from me. With its massive clock. Exactly what I need right now.”
Cars came up behind Dean, already shooting at them both. Cas took off like a jackrabbit in one direction, Dean reversed and drove off in the other.
“Oh ho ho, did your little research, did you?”
His shoulders slumped again as he righted his head, wiping his eyes. Dean ignored the little thrill he felt at the gravel tone of the voice, instead trying to concentrate on the guy’s well-being. “Bad day, huh?”
Sam nearly died laughing when he discovered they’d lost Dean and wanted his help to find him.
Alastair phoned Chuck as he and his goons set their remaining vehicle on fire in the warehouse district of Amsterdam. “We have Winchester’s travelling companion.”
Zach gave him a friendly smile, sending him on his way. Gabriel took his place in the middle van with Dean, sitting as close to him as he possibly could with the bars. Other armed agents piled into the remaining seats. The convoy of three vehicles started up and began to leave the garage.
“Get to the Hague, see what you can get out of Dukhovich.”
“All right. I appreciate you.”
“I hope you know, you brought this rather rude awakening on yourself.” Dean proceeded to tickle down Cas’ bare sides without mercy.
Behind him, Dean tentatively came through the door of the building, carefully looking about.
Cas ran down an escalator, pulling and knocking people out of his way. The Belarusians hopped the turnstile at the top. Cas made it to the platform, dodging people. There was a train waiting there with open doors. Cas ran three carriages up, risking a quick look back. He stepped on and flopped into a seat, keeping his head down and away from his pursuers, discreetly rubbing the blood off his brow from the car crash.
“I didn’t want to do this, Gabriel. I swear to you.” Gabriel was turning purple, spluttering for breath.
“Fuckin’ hell, I know it’s you. I got caller ID. Such a fucking dick.” Cas closed his eyes in irritation. “You got a pick up for me or wha’?”
"So warm.....so soft...They fit perfectly!" He waved his hands in front of Dean to show him.
Elsewhere in Coventry, Jody’s team were frantically trying to pin down Gabriel and Dean’s whereabouts. She was on the phone to Zach as he checked in from the airport, asking, “Where are you?”
“SON OF A—“
Chuck held his upper arm, staring back at Dean, who hobbled towards him slowly, gun up. The sound of a helicopter grew louder. They both looked behind Dean to see the red and white medical chopper, just as it opened fire on Dean. “Oh fuck!” Dean dived for cover, as it hit a nearby unit, causing a massive explosion. The chopper stopped shooting momentarily as it eyed the damage and smoke, looking for Chuck.
“And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam. Have them triple the guard around Dean Winchester’s brother.”
Cas walked up beside the car to survey the destruction. “Yeah, I guess so. And they just got lucky with checking the back roads, knowing the direction we were going in. Fuck!” Cas kicked the burning car door closed in frustration, frowning at the blazing shell of their car. He headed towards the enemy vehicle.
Dean kicked him brutally in the chest, sending Chuck clean over the edge with a yell. Dean peered over after him. “And that was with my bad leg too, you fucking bitch.”
Cas smiled again, and looked a little happier. "No Dean, they mean the world to me, thank you. Can I put them on?"
Cas sat up properly, still staring at her. “And you are?”
Gabriel’s voice was devoid of emotion. “I’m texting you an address in Coventry. You need to get there immediately with three units of O negative blood.”
He could hear the sigh, smiled and took that as his cue to leap into the room, badly singing the Indiana Jones tune at the top of his voice.
Dean rolled his eyes. " 'Beloved holiday tradition' my ass. It's not like it's the night before my wedding or something."
“Really, Cole. REALLY?”
Chuck turned off the TV, eyeing Zach up silently. Metatron came up behind Zach. “You’ve come here to lodge a complaint?”
Alastair kept shooting at the Interpol vehicles, causing one of them to crash into the water on a bend in the canal. It crashed so close to Dean’s boat that he momentarily crouched down.
Suddenly, two hands grabbed his hips from behind. Cas could feel a warm body pressing all along his back, a chin on his shoulder. Frozen like a rabbit in headlights, Cas turned his head, relaxing when he caught sight of the hot guy in his periphery. Cas could feel delicious breath on his neck, gasping as the hot guy leaned into his ear, whispering, “I’m Dean. Would your date mind if I had this dance?” He leaned his ear in to Cas’ mouth. Cas gathered himself enough to answer with a terse whisper, “No, my brother won’t care. I’m Cas.”
“That’s a good idea, oh yes.” Dean knocked his seat back, settling in gratefully, sighing deeply. “Oooh smells like ass back here. Bet that Jag never smelled like ass.” Cas briefly closed his eyes in frustration, knuckles white on the wheel.
“Prosecution exhibit 17D, palace security logs. Did he offer you employment then?”
Mercifully, they soon pulled up to the ferry terminal. “This is your stop, boys.”
Cas sat back, sipping at his tea. “But Dean, you’re gonna go to jail. For a long time. And you might be killed on the way there. So why?”
Cas laughed at that, pulling Dean into another kiss.
“Could Winchester have gotten inside?”
As he reached out, Dean caught him softly by the wrist. Ignoring the thrill that swept through him at this first piece of physical contact, he began, "No Cas, you misunderstand me. I was going to say that I can't just take one. I must have them all for the feature, and more. When can you get them to me?"
"Oh Cas, I'm so sorry, I couldn't check if you were ok with this because it was a surprise but your photographs were so exquisite I thought the world should see them, so I got this printed. The publishers loved it and would happily work with you to get it properly printed and out there. You should share your talent with the world..."
“We’re a couple minutes out.” Dean and Cas were driving down an elevated highway leading into the city. Dean didn’t like how exposed they were, but they didn’t have a choice with so little time left.
Cas watched him for as long as he was in sight, sighing heavily as the paramedics wheeled him to the ambulance. After everything, he was going to miss Dean a lot. He had loved having him around. Cas smiled at the realisation, still feeling giggly. The paramedics loaded him up, but Gabriel, Charlie and Kevin got into his ambulance with a flash of a badge before the doors closed. Dean watched with a soft smile.
“Hi, this is Castiel Novak, I’m an executive protection agent, fully licensed and bonded within the EU…”
“Agent Novak’s gone.”
Dean grinned at him, switching on the radio, loudly singing and dancing along to whatever obnoxious bullshit that started playing, swigging from the hip flask the whole time. Cas frowned at the road, willing this trip to end. He mentally went through all of his past transgressions, wondering which deity he’d managed to piss off this time, and how badly.
Dean spotted Cas’ phone discarded on the passenger seat. He picked it up, frowning at the name ‘Pure Evil’ on the screen. He put the phone to his ear with his shoulder while changing gears. “Who dis?”
Dean looked very very worried as he turned his focus back to driving down the canal. He set his jaw and glared murder at the water in front of him, death in his eyes.
Dean was laid out on an armchair, still passed out, hooked up to a blood drip.
Cas watched Dean without seeing him, settling his gaze on a spot behind him. This allowed him to keep a close watch on the main door with his periphery while running the plan through his head again. He didn’t notice Dean eyeing him every few seconds. It felt like no time at all when Diane was back with their plates and a full coffee pot.
“So I’ve gotta risk my life protecting this coffin magnet over here? No no no, you’ve gotta put something in the pot for me.” Cas glared down at his big brother.
Cas undid Dean’s handcuffs, and withdrew his drip, put a plaster on the wound, and hauled him to his feet. “Come on.”
Despite his leave of absence, Gabriel scored a promotion in Interpol. Dean had been placed in solitary at his own request. His cell was at the far edge of the prison, as far as possible from any mobile phone blockers. Gabriel, one of the only people allowed to see such a high profile Interpol prisoner, never missed a weekly visit. He also smuggled Dean a charger and phone doctored by Charlie so that he could keep in contact with everyone, especially Cas. They texted each other constantly, getting to know each other better over the weeks, with Dean latching onto this lifeline from the outside world. He firmly believed that this was the only thing keeping him sane, as he wasn’t doing so well after coming so close to losing Cas.
“Pull over, I need a piss.”
“Me weak? How about you!” Dean snarked to him as he passed. Benny guffawed and shoved Dean inside.
Every Wednesday, neighbors would move their trash cans and recycle bins to the curb for trash day. Every Wednesday evening Bruiser would tackle every trash can and recycle bin he would come across on his evening walk. Dean would hastily collect anything that fell out (trash and recyclables were collected in the morning thankfully but sometimes one or two were accidentally skipped) and right the trash can. Well, as much he could anyway. Bruiser would tackle it immediately once it was upright again.
“Cas, I’m not following.”
Dean wanted to go. It made sense the instant Cas said it. Even though the bunker had become his home in the last few years, like so many other things in his life lately, even that had shifted too. Sam was making it the headquarters of whatever his version of Men of Letters was. Scratch that, he was making into something better than that crummy organization.  Dean was a just guest now to something building that was profound and world changing. Something bigger than both of them combined.
“This doesn’t make any sense,” Sam said because it didn’t.
Two hours, a thick stack of paperwork, one check large check and several smaller checks later, and the house officially belonged to Cas and Dean.  The kids agreed to knock more money off if Cas and Dean agreed to file all the paperwork with the town because they didn’t want to drive back to file with the county since they lived hours away. They seemed to be in a hurry until the oldest grandson went to hand the well-worn keys to Cas. The grandson paused and frowned before looking around the dining room they were in. The sale of the house became real then.
The nurse left him not long after to the mountain of paperwork. Dean carefully filled out the forms. The truths were easy enough. Jack’s birthday took him a second to remember and it blew him away when he realized that Jack was eight months old. Eight months old and living in their new house for six weeks now. He skipped his social security number because Jack didn’t have one. They had to make sure whatever lies he put down they would be able to continue and protect Jack at the same time.
“Was it on the ass?” Eileen asked.
Sam watched her walk over to the various bags hanging up on a rack with bright letter markers. Bianca the nurse made her way to the section marked “S”. She grabbed two paper sacks and before making her way back. She waved them goodbye and they quickly departed the still crowded clinic.
Sam had been their rock the last few months and he deserved more than anyone to have this moment. Sam ran his arms up and down Eileen’s as she started trying to sign to explain her absence through hiccups and sobs. He pulled her close again and held her tight not caring for an explanation.
His shout was desperate, loud, and pleading prayer in the silence of the aftershock of the defibrillator. His shout took several members of the team by surprise as they spun around to look at him before refocusing on Cas.
“You got stung? Where?” Eileen asked.
Mackenzie was standing in front of him chirping away and then began to actually swing her arms in a circle while clapping. A literal round of applause. Where people like this come from, Dean didn’t know. Dean was still dumbfounded as Mackenzie grabbed two water bottles and a hidden bag of licorice off the counter. She gripped the nearby stool and pulled it across from Dean who was sitting on the physical therapy bench.
His leg was stiff and throbbing which Dean added to the Not-Heaven list. Unless Heaven was needlessly cruel in forcing Dean to still have to deal with a bum leg. The brace creaked as he stood and Dean noticed the second band on his thigh appeared to have lost the a loop resulting in that part being loose. Good thing the brace was black because if he squinted at it too much he would definitely notice more blood than he was truly comfortably with. Heaven was seeming less like a possibility every second.
Whatever test Mackenzie was running, Dean didn’t understand it. But he got up anyway and walked across the rug again, leaving the folder on the bench. The drawer he opened had medical supplies and no pen. He rummaged a little when he heard the loud click of something he didn’t recognize behind his back. It didn’t sound like a gun but Dean knew better than to take chances.
“Dean, before we start to settle down for the night, can I ask you something?”
“Yeah, you?”
Dean sternly told his exhausted self.
The Doctor’s inability to look Dean directly in the eyes for more than a few seconds when talking confirmed his worst fears. The damage to the femur and knee was too extensive. Dr. Sands pulled up the x-rays on his tablet as he began to speak. The femur had healed the best but it had “aligned abnormally” during the process. There was also unusual crystallization around where the pins were placed because he body had tried to reject the pins. The femur was going to cause pain in his future but it wasn’t the primary focus of their concerns. The doctor didn’t offer more explanation on this.
“Hello Hannah. Hello Muriel, Duma, Balthazar,” Cas replied nodding at each in turn.
When Sam came over three hours later, Dean was waiting onside on his front step absent-mindedly scratching Bruiser's head with one hand and holding his leash with his other. Dean silently handed Sam the leash when he approached and held up 1 finger as a signal to wait. Dean dragged his large green recycle bin from it's location in the garage near the Impala to the middle of the driveway.
For the first two days, Dean did not emerge from his room. Cas, Sam, and even Eileen left food outside the door when Dean refused to open it. Sam noted loudly through the door Dean didn’t seem to be taking the pain pills he had left for him on the rare occasion he had eaten. At that, Dean pulled on a pair of headphones to drown out his brother and the throbbing pain in his leg.
Sam looked over at Dean before continuing to dress the cut on Bobby’s arm. “Bobby, how bad is it really?”
His temper bubbled back up to the surface. Dean knew he was being shitty to Cas. He didn’t need to be reminded and that he hadn’t done a damn thing but be useless all day. Dean wasn’t holding up his end of the bargain. He didn’t hold Jack once to help Cas out so what kind of shitty father figure was he being on top of that. His head hurt, his leg hurt, and he was exhausted both mentally and physically.
He found himself on unsteady legs when he pushed himself off the couch. The painkillers had fully kicked in now but the day had still drained him and left him feeling weak. Giving himself a moment to get steady, he steeled himself for the task ahead. Cas was probably up in Jack’s room hiding from his bad attitude.
“If we’re somehow still on Earth, Mackenzie is going to be pissed that I screwed up my leg so bad,” Dean joked to help lighten the mood. Cas smiled and looked down at his hands.
Sam nodded immediately, “We still have people to find beds for tonight plus make sure everyone got their medications and treated for any injuries. You guys are probably tired. Let’s talk tomorrow. “
Dean tapped the folder against his leg and waited for Mackenzie to do anything. She was sneaking glances at him like she was expecting him to do something.
Unfortunately, Dean didn’t answer when Cas called. He even called a second time and asked Dean to call him back ASAP. His phone had been damaged when it fell out his pocket at the stadium and Cas hoped unrealistically that maybe that was the reason Dean wasn’t answering. That or he was in deep wilderness.
Dean watched this little internal battle with amusement, smile growing wider when Cas stopped straining his head up. “Are you going to play nice, Cas?”
Cas paused, letting the gravity of what he was about to do sink in. “Right, well. I’m calling you because I’ve been thinking. Some things have been put into perspective for me recently, and…. I forgive you. Yeah. Feels good to say that. I forgive you, Gabriel.” Cas gave a little laugh to himself, hardly believing the relief he felt. It felt good. Real good.
“The court’s deadline is at 5pm Friday. Although you can testify whenever you get there, that gives us a maximum of three days to covertly transport you overland from Manchester to the Netherlands.” Jody stepped right up to Dean’s face. “That’s not that much time, given the danger, and the need for covert travel. If you want to help your brother, you should get moving.”
“So, what happened to your fraternal bonds then? Did your tight ass, boring is good, look before you leap, put your seatbelt on, shit finally get too much and he dropped you?”
Cas tickled along Dean’s upturned ribs. Dean gave a startled cry as he turned quickly, grabbing both of Cas’ wrists, yanking and holding them onto the pillows on either side of his head with an iron grip, all while straddling him firmly. Dean moved his face down very close to Cas’. “I’m sensitive, there’s a difference.” His voice was a low rumble.
A rather disheveled Cas was sitting alone in his car, unshaven, hair a nightmare, staring off into space with a blank expression. The time of smart suits was most definitely long gone. His face changed slightly as he finished up and closed the bottle he had just peed into, tossing it into the backseat. Then he zipped up his pants. He exited his tatty car, showing him to be in the business district of inner city London. He leaned tiredly back against the scratched door, checking his battered watch. He huffed as he stared up at the skyscraper. His light grey Henley, long black overcoat and dark jeans had most definitely seen better days.
“Yes, yes! Now get ready and go, Dean. Take that bastard down and get Samuel back. We miss him.” Rowena stared up at him critically. “Sure I can’t send some extra help or back up with you?”
“Here, we’re going to load all these into the car, ok…” He indicated the sizeable display of air fresheners. “..and then we’re going to take the car out the front and we’re just gonna burn it.”
Dean held up Cas’ pee bottle from earlier in the day. “Oh! These your electrolytes?” He tossed the bottle into Cas’ lap. Cas glowered as he tossed the bottle out the window, nostrils flaring. They drove off into the night to the sound of Dean’s happy laughter.
Dean moved to help as Cas ran up. "I did. I wanted to thank you guys for being so great since the trials. Cas, you gave up the last of your grace for me. I can never repay that. Dean, you've looked out for me forever. I just wanted to do something nice for you guys, even though this is only a small gesture. But seeing as how this is Cas' first real Halloween, and we didn't get to celebrate properly every year growing up, I thought I'd pull out all the stops. You don't get to ask me about the preparation, and I'm fine. I was just trying to get rid of you guys for a while today. And you don't get to say you're not playing. Now, do you like it?"
that would put up with it.”
“Good morning Mr. Novak. I trust the pick up ran smoothly.”
Dean paused a moment to look into Cas’ pleading needy eyes. He swallowed hard, nodding briskly. “Holy fuck, yes!”
Once Cas had ridden out his orgasm, still thrusting shallowly into Dean, he felt Dean’s twitching subside. Cas lowered Dean’s leg gently, carefully removed himself from him, and pushed the plug back into Dean’s hole. Dean melted back against him with a shudder. He didn’t notice the brief silence between the songs as he softly said, “You kinky bastard.” Cas couldn’t help but snarking back, “You love it.”
“What??”
“And how is the patient? Aha! Awake at last. Let me have a look at you.”
Dean smiled widely, leaning up to kiss Cas sweetly. He pulled back, grinning into Cas’ face, then snuggled down into his neck again with another happy sigh. Dean resumed his finger tracing, noticing he was now causing goosebumps along Cas’ flesh as he strayed towards his nipple.
Part of Dean hated the newborn from bringing so much pain into their life. First, the half-angel had brainwashed Cas and taken him away for weeks on end. Then, his father who was THE actual devil himself nearly killed them all in an attempt to take his own son back. Sam and Mary may have been cooing over the devil baby but Dean didn’t even want to look at Jack. He was his father’s son and there was no way Dean was going to forget that.
First, he searched information about the clinic and Dr. Mackenzie Peterson. He read the entire website and the packet he had been assigned. Dean found that even though the clinic was focused on new-age methods for physical therapy and healing the doctors created these new treatments with the support of science. There were seven different links talking about the benefits of massage therapy alone. Some of the articles talked about the benefits of working on healing health with a partner.
Sam didn’t budge though and apparently the fear of getting hit by Dean was outweighed by the pity he felt. The standoff continued for a few minutes before Dean accepted Sam’s help. Once upwards, Dean used the crutches to drag himself, his useless leg, and monster brace out of the garage and to his room. Sam followed closely behind with the second brace, bag of reusable pads and wraps, and new prescription silently.
Bobby was tough as nails but softened more and more each day. He eventually got comfortable enough to quip at them in his signature grumpy tone. He joked more and listened to Dean tell stories about his Bobby and Rufus getting into trouble with a knowing smirk. Sometimes, Bobby even corrected Dean about the misadventures of the two old geezers.
Cas let a long sigh and responded, “I never meant to tell you this but when you were living with Lisa I would stop in every once and a while. To make sure you were safe and happy. Sometimes, I saw you at work or cooking breakfast. Once I was going to ask you for help with Raphael but...”
Thunder and lightning clapped overhead. As they crested the hill, Dean glanced back and saw Billie break through the door at the bottom of the hill. No demons were behind her but they wouldn’t be far behind if they were chasing the grace like the last group.
“Are you okay?” Cas asked curiously from the passenger seat one they got settled in. He was trying to gauge something from Dean who had been pondering his own reaction in the store. Dean just didn’t get why Chad got under his skin so much.
“He didn’t have to say it. I know he’s going to miss you but I can tell he’s more happy for you than anything. You better get going, don’t want to keep Cas waiting.”
“So new in town, visiting, family or just passing through?” Natalie asked trying to make conversation. Dean knew he wasn’t one to start one and the damn announcement was lodged in his mind making him wary to give too much away.
Dean and Cas continued bickering as they moved the hive from the truck to the small stand on the side of the barn. They bickered when Dean moved a few feet away and Cas used the sugar spray to calm the bees. They bickered when Cas carefully extracted the queen and let the hive have her back. They bickered as Cas slide open the small doors and bees began to explore their new home. They bickered as they moved away from the hive now that it had been established.
He had never planned on bringing this up but his jealousy and feelings were swirling in a confusing mixture of emotion. Cas settled back in the chair and appeared to think deeply about his answer before speaking.
HE HAD BEEN THE ONE TO CONVINCE DEAN TO STAY IN THE DAMN HOUSE FULL-TIME TO BEGIN WITH. DEAN DIDN'T FOOL HIM FOR A SECOND DURING THAT CONVERSATION.
Dean had been given a horse-sized pain anesthetic injection to numb his entire leg while they sawed off the extra thick cast. Apparently, the night Dean had undergone surgery to repair his leg and place pins, the hospital had run out of normal cast material and had to use some experimental cast material dropped off by a new pharmaceutical company earlier in the week on Dean’s leg .
Eileen had woken up after sensing movement in the bed. She smiled that beautiful smile at Sam before smiling at Jack who dove on top of her when he noticed she was awake. Eileen let out an “oof” as Jack collided with her. He planted a wet kiss on her cheek and she let out a laugh that sounded like music to Sam’s ears. She tickled his stomach and Jack giggled in delight.
Sam didn’t say anything. His gaze shifted and he appeared to be thinking hard about something.
Stewart whistled in appreciation, “Not many people have skills like that. Take it you’re a mechanic?”
Their angel doctor didn’t know why Jack had a flare up but stated it appeared human and the wound from ripping his grace was not reopening. She mentioned asthma or he might have a developmental delay since he was born early. She even said that if Jack had been born a regular human he likely would have had this problem anyway. His grace still hadn’t returned and couldn’t help keep him healthy.
Dean nodded in agreement before Mackenzie continued speaking.
“Oh no, they suck.”
Instead, he launched himself so he was standing mostly in front of Cas. Hands held up, Dean yelled, “Woah!”
it. You deserve a life and a family. Cas, you deserve happiness.”
Four, thank you for the nice comments and thank you for reading. I appreciate you all so, so much!
The grace flowed through him and it nearly overpowered him. Every fiber of his being vibrated. Grace normally felt good as it stitched his skin back together or healed a broken bone. Now it made his body feel like it was a star waiting to explode. A long minute later, hands fell from him one by one and the flow of angelic power eased. Dean drew in a deep breath as he mentally prepared for what came next. Slowly, he leaned into his knee. The brace gave a small creak as a small jolt of electricity shot from his knee and up his leg.
Once Dean even asked Rowena to hold Jack for a few minutes because he had to grab something from another room for the plan. She looked uncomfortable holding Jack but Dean had assured her that she could handle it for a few minutes and left with a roll of his eyes. When he came back, he found her cradling baby Jack in her arms, eyes warm and nurturing. She moved his shirt down a little because he stomach had been peeking out and patted his stomach soothing. Rowena immediately softened to Jack and Dean let her have a few minutes before pretending to come back later. When Dean actually came back in, she pretended to be disgusted but Dean knew the truth. Still if Rowena had been this soft with Jack, what had gone wrong with Crowley?
“You want me to avoid talking to Sam on a technicality?”
“What do you mean ‘no’?”
Whether it was feeding, changing, or soothing, Dean stepped up in helping Cas care for Jack. It didn’t take long for it to go from 20 minutes here and there to Dean being responsible for about half of Jack’s daily care in the span of 4 weeks. Once while watching Jack sleep in his crib when they were alone in his room, Dean thought back to his plan to pretend to care for Jack. He had never had a plan fail so spectacularly.
“Oh,” Cas echoed.
“You’ve never watched him before. You’ve never spent any time with him. Are you sure you can handle a whole night?”
If the angels were split in two, Dean was just thankful the Hannah seemed to be favored.
Cas nodded in understanding and shifted to pull the torn flannel off. His face twisted in pain and Dean saw him grit his teeth. Dean leaned forward and helped pull his arms through the sleeves. As the flannel came off, the sleeve of the t-shirt came off too and exposed his left arm completely. Dean ripped the last few connected strands of the left sleeve off the flannel and used that to wrap a makeshift tourniquet around his leg.
“Earth to Dean.”
It wasn’t long before Mary, Eileen, Sam, and Bobby were dressed and ready to go back. Mary and Eileen both hugged Dean. They had said goodbye to Cas before he had passed out. They both stepped into the rift and disappeared. Bobby gave Dean a firm handshake before turning to make his departure as well.
Cas hated the wing burn. In the hospital, Cas wouldn’t look at the thing and turned his eyes away from the burn every time the doctor had him remove the gown to check his chest wound and other small injuries. Other times, when Cas thought no one was looking, Cas would study the burn with disgust and sadness. Most of the time, Cas adverted his eyes away from his left arm when he changed his shirt.
“What are you doing tomorrow?”
Sam continued talking when they didn’t respond, “Listen, you’ll have four days to come up with a better plan if you don’t like this one. I would rather not use Jack either. I would never do anything to hurt him or put him in danger. You know how much I love him but I think this is the best chance we have for saving all the people from dying in the other world and protecting Jack from being a pawn. Promise me you’ll think about it.”
Dean thought sarcastically.
“What do you mean?”
The cotton swab entered Jack’s mouth and he began to sputter. Dr. Stern stuck the cotton swab even farther towards the back of his throat and Dean felt Cas’s hand clamp down over his own. It was a desperate hold that was hard and just the wrong side of too tight but Dean understood exactly what Cas was feeling. Cas’s hand started to tighten and cut off his circulation so Dean gave a reassuring squeeze before he refocused on Jack.
And wouldn't you know it, the neighborhood grew attached to Bruiser and his quirks too.
Dean tried to be productive, he really did but as the hours tipped by Dean couldn’t bring himself to pretend. He found himself in a position he never was before. He couldn’t stop holding Jack. Others offered to take Jack but Dean would politely rebuff with a joke which became a simple shake of his head. People stopped asking and gave him space to hold Jack.
Eileen was shaking her head as soon as Dean started talking, “We’ll be fine. Cas and Jack are probably hungry anyway.”
Mackenzie cleared her throat and said, “I asked Dean to prove to me that monsters are real.”
Cas felt the smallest crush forming in the back of his mind at the cute scene. He brushed it off because his likely hood of seeing Dean again was slim to none and this was just his hormones running high after having sex. Dean had thanked him for the hook-up before stepping out the door. He even had gone on to say that he usually didn’t see the same person twice because he didn’t date but Cas was simply too “awesome” to miss out on. Dean rubbed his neck when he admitted that and looked confused by his own statement. Nothing left to say, Dean departed and Cas was left feeling weird.
He had done everything right. He let Cas in and grew more attached. He tolerated and then loved Jack just like they asked of him. He went to physical therapy like they wanted him to. He manned this side of the portal while Sam was gone and pulled Jack’s grace like he had been instructed. He was helping around the bunker with the new hunters and still caring for Jack because that was what was expected of him. Dean had done every damn thing he had been asked and then some. There was anger building and he was about to burst. He was going to let his temper fly because they deserved to hear it. They thought he was a bomb so he was going to be a bomb.
There was no way Cas could have known that the spell would rip the grace out so violently until Jack started having problems breathing. Another example of bad luck. Cas stared at the floor during that part of the story and Dean leaned into him a little to offer some comfort. It wouldn’t matter what Dean or anyone said, Cas would likely always blame himself for what had happened to Jack.
Dean’s mind flashed back to their escape from purgatory when Dean left Cas behind after spending a year fighting to get him back. Part of Dean still didn't believe Cas's version.
For the first time in a long time, Dean would get to make a deciding factor for life here in the bunker for himself and everyone else. If Dean was all in, he could say that. If he wanted out, Dean could walk away. He could walk away from Jack and Cas.
Jack looked exhausted and like a little lost puppy left out in the rain. Running the afterlife wasn't an easy feat even for someone as powered up as Jack. He currently sat slumped at the table with his head resting on his hands.
“Okay, why don’t you go talk to Cas and text me when everything’s done?”
As always, I live for your comments :)
“And judging from your looks on your faces she isn’t alive in this world anymore.”
“Oh, right,” Cas said blushing. Dean didn’t know why he was blushing. It wasn’t like it was a well-kept secret or anything but Cas seemed flustered by that.
Before he could finish his thought, he was gently pulled by something into what can only be described as bright sunshine. Then, he felt nothing.
Dean hadn’t been so lucky. His adrenaline had acted as a dam and been responsible for holding back the flood for the three or four seconds as he looked around the clearing and located Sam and Cas. Then, the dam inside him burst and he was hit with an explosion of pain like one he had never experienced before.
Time lost meaning. Jack’s steady breaths came over the monitor and Dean didn’t let go of Cas until his tears had dried up and his breathing was stable. Only then, did Dean help Cas back into their house and into his bed.
Cas’s left hand finally left Dean’s back as he rose to his feet and he immediately missed the sensation. Dean tried to stand but found his leg locking up and grimaced in pain. Cas gave him an understanding look. He gestured to let him take Jack so he could help Dean to his feet for the second time that day. Dean handed Jack up to him and let Cas pull him to his feet without a thought. Even without his grace Cas was remarkably strong and his grip was firm and warm on Dean’s wrist.
“I’m the only one who needs to sign. My… husband is watching Jack.”
Brandon sighed loudly likely from having to watch his brother flirt with two married men. Dean grabbed the bags off the counter and started crowding Cas to get him to move towards the exit and out the door. Cas willingly went though he appeared slightly flustered at both Chad’s comment and Dean’s flurry of activity.
Balthazar and Meg should share the blame for forcing him to sign up for the damn app too.
Dean brushed him off, “Don’t apologize, we are happy you guys came early. Hell, stay as long as you want to. We love having you here.”
Cas took Dean’s words and digested them one by one before speaking, “I guess it’s not the first time we’ve seen the same situation differently.”
Bobby let out a sigh before he spoke, “Michael found out that your Lucifer entered and exited our world. For some reason, the thought of another world not under his thumb and where Lucifer was still kicking scrambled whatever was left of his featherbrains. He’s been on human killing spree. A band of us went out to rescue Charlie when she was taken. The bastards got us all ‘cept for me and Charlie on the return. We lost them two days ago but we got ambushed by a scout a few hours back and the car got destroyed. When I saw the rift open ahead, I took it as a sign and brought her through. Wasn’t expecting to encounter you but I guess it’s better than a random Wal-Mart where we would traumatize people.”
It wasn’t long before news spread through the bunker and beyond about Papa Dean. Surprisingly, no one made fun of Dean for his new title. Sam smiled that stupid goofy grin when he found out. Eileen hugged him in the kitchen without saying or signing a word. Even Claire didn’t joke about it. Jody said it fit. Donna thought it was sweet. Garth had the biggest reaction and sobbed into the phone for ten uninterrupted minutes when he found out. Maybe he avoided ridicule was because even if he couldn’t physically catch them, he was still a damn good shot and had a good memory Dean had joked to Sam one evening. Sam rolled his eyes and didn’t say anything to that.
“I found more inconsistencies and evidence that they are hiding something. This room isn’t right, Sam. I thought it was a little off when we first got here and then Cas said the thing about it being a guest room. It got me thinking. What do you see? Better yet, what don’t you see?”
A small smile tugged at the corners of Cas’s mouth. Cas had said that so softly and quietly that Dean almost wondered if he heard him correctly. Cas looked up and met Dean’s eyes. They say everything without saying another word. Cas forgave Dean like he always done when Dean is being a jerk. Cas wasn’t going to take Jack and leave or send Dean back to the bunker. Dean promised to do better. A lot can be said with eye contact alone and Dean is thankful for that because words often failed him when it came to Cas.
“I’ll have to talk to Cas and we have family in town but I don’t think we have much going on this week.”
“Cas took it to draw the demons away from Jack and the library.”
“Well then you should try it once. It doesn’t taste that different from actual milk.”
Cas would narrate the story from a rocking chair a few feet away. Dean made sure that the few hunting duties he still did around the bunker never interfered with Story Time or anything Jack related for that matter. If Jack or Cas needed anything, Dean was there and Story Time fell squarely into that category according to Cas. Sam had gotten the gist quickly thanks to a snappy Cas and rarely ever asked for anything after 6pm anymore on order to give Story Time and Dean’s physical therapy a wide berth.
To make more room at the front of the stand, Sam took a step backwards and collided with a frazzled woman who looked uneasy. She muttered an apology under her breathe before shifting her flighty gaze back to the stand. She looked behind her and Sam followed her gaze to a man who looked agitated on the far side of the little path.
Sam wasn’t an idiot.
“That sounds good. It's probably not a good idea for people to think you didn’t like your adopted son in our fake-marriage.”
“Yeah,” Cas said as he moved down to look at the pepper plants.
“Fergus,” Rowena stated simply.
Rowena’s eyes lingered on the fully formed rift for a moment before turning towards Dean and Cas who stood anxiously waiting. Jody and Donna had reappeared exactly once each helping an uninjured person through and into Alex’s waiting arms before disappearing again. Alex escorted them down the hallway.
One week and three days ago, a small knock sounded on Dean’s bedroom door. It was four days after Cas’s initial announcement and at 1PM Dean was busy ignoring his responsibilities. He had just settled with his laptop on his legs and the opening credits to
Sam raised his eyebrows in surprise and a little disbelief, “Really how?”
“Dean, what are you looking for?” Cas asked from the passenger seat as he mimicked the lean. It was the first time he had spoken in hours after talking on the phone with Sam. They had spoken about the case and the case only so Dean could focus on keeping them from hydroplaning off the backroads to the rundown town they were in now.
Cas hadn’t noticed him so there was still time to escape the kitchen but inaction rendered him immobilized. He promised he would start trying but he wasn’t sure he was ready for this. He wasn’t prepared to dive in first thing. Not with things like feeding. He wanted to start with maybe hanging out with Cas and Jack being in the same room. The promise he made to universe rung in the back of his mind like a gong in contrast to his protests.
Jack's eyes lit up, "Yeah, I do."
Hannah was the first to speak, “Hello Castiel.”
“I work on Wall Street. Those guys you see yelling in the movies wish they did as well as me. You?”
Dean turned to the sound of his name. Cas was standing there with Jack perched on his hip clearly waiting for Dean to finish admiring the car. He had stolen Dean’s sunglasses for the ride over and those now hung from the front of his t-shirt. He was looking at Dean curiously. The look suited him well.
“That dose is quite high for that medication long term. Normally, I would be worried about the lack of forward progress coming off the painkillers but given your status… I think it’s fair. I going to prescribe some new, equally powerful pain killers to help the transition and pain. I’m not sure how much you’ll need to have an effective dose so take them slowly and don’t overdo it to start with. They should help reduce the pain immensely, maybe even moreso than your other ones, and you can be on these long term without any lasting damage. They may cause tiredness and nausea among other things so no driving or operating machinery until you have firm control over your dosing. The most important thing is they cannot, under any circumstances, be taken with alcohol because alcohol weakens the binding agent in them and can cause some severe side effects.”
Dean looked up at Sam from his conversation and Sam gestured down at the woman standing near him. Sam could read his brother like a book and saw the change in his demeanor right away. The tension in his brother was instant. The flash in Dean’s eyes and shift to stand straighter meant that he knew this woman and it was not the friendly vibes that his brother had been giving off all morning. It was the opposite. Shut off and reserved.
“Could you at least try?” Dean was almost ready to beg.
“Yes, yes, Samuel told me the three of you were moving out. If that’s your idea of hot gossip, then I’m going back to the party where I can get an ice cube to warm me up.”
In the end, Cas made the decision to stay. Sam let out a relieved sigh and Dean thanked the Heaven, Hell Purgatory, and all the places inbetween. Time was a funny thing and it was rare anybody got granted a second chance like Dean just had.
Sam opened his mouth to ask a question, but Cas spoke up first, “You’re probably wondering why the hive is going over here instead of the yard?”
Sam thought.
“Hello, and you must be Jack’s other parent,” Dr Hines started. His voice was deeply soothing and practiced as if he already knew that Dean was about ready to break. Dean felt calmer and tried to steady his own thoughts to focus on the doctor.
Brandon was actually a mostly decent guy in Dean’s opinion. Just homophobic enough that being in small town middle America gave him a pass but not homophobic enough to where if they couldn’t chat about daily life. Dean thought they may even be approaching “friendship” territory because both Brandon and Jaqueline went out of their way to chat with Dean and Cas now. Brandon had no problem complaining about his nuisance of a brother Chad to Dean when he quickly figured out how Dean felt about the guy.
“Is that another decision you are making for me,
Dean shifted his eyes down to the water bottle. He began to crinkle the paper and struggled to recall when he was told he would have to bring a partner. Cas and Sam hadn’t said a damn thing and they had made the appointment. Mackenzie must have been sensing his confusion because her smiley demeanor slipped for a second and a brief frown graced her face. Fixing the smile back on her face, she continued speaking.
“Samuel, what did you do?”
That is how Cas found them five minutes later, Jack listening quiet while Dean talked to him. He didn’t say anything as he joined Dean along the crib side. Their arms brushed as Dean continued his story. When Dean got to the part about playing their roles, Jack fell asleep. Maybe his old role as a hunter was over but small moments like this could be part whatever roll his future held.
Cas had collected more plants for his garden it seemed while Dean had been preoccupied. He briefly said hello to Chad and Brandon before flashing a smile at Dean. Dean smiled back, relayed information on the status of Better Boys, and began to help Cas unload the cart onto the checkout lane.  Brandon rung up the purchase and gave Dean the total.  Jack was talking and babbling at Cas who was nodding very seriously in response. Chad raked his gaze over Cas unabashedly, lingering on the waistline of his jeans where a sliver of skin was peeking out when he reached over to grab something out of the diaper bag. Dean thought about taking out his gun Just Desserts style and ending his issues with Chad right there.
When Sam and Eileen weren’t in the bunker, they were assisting on hunts or hunting themselves. Part of Dean ached watching Sam with his new hunting partner but Dean had to admit he positively adored Eileen and she was far too good for Sam he would joke. Sam had never been happier than his time spent with Eileen. Dean was happy that Sam was so happy and Eileen seemed to get Sam and his weird quirks.
Dean glanced at the clock. They had a while before dinner would be done so he had plenty of time.
“Kaia, open your eyes! NOW!” Dean yelled at the exact moment that Claire shouted, “Please!”
Dean turned to look at Cas with disbelief on his face. Cas had said that so casually and acting as though it was a perfect normal request. Like Dean would be doing him a favor. Cas looked a little too chummy and happy at his concocted plan. He looked like he was proud of himself too. He wanted to help Dean, that much was obvious. Even if Dean could only admit it to himself, he needed some help. He needed to do physical therapy and it would be nice to take the night off baby duty if he was jumping back into his PT.
A feeling of relief swept over Dean. He relaxed and rolled his shoulders to smooth out the tension. The heater of the Impala hummed as the conflict eased.
Cas, Dean, and Jack made three.
Mackenzie spoke so fast it made Dean’s head spin. It took him a solid 30 seconds to realize she had apologized to him in the middle of talking to Cas for assuming he had a female partner. She had looked from Cas to Dean back to Cas then down at her phone. Dean wondered briefly if he should be offended that she thought Cas was his partner before she swung around to show him a photo on her phone.
Dean had been transferred to a new doctor closer to the bunker to remove his cast and place a temporary brace. Dr. Sands was a polite but non-talkative Orthopedic Surgeon built like a runner and with a military haircut. They had met him once before at the eight-week check-up and he hadn’t said much then except keep resting.
The first demon came at Dean so fast that Dean used his momentum against him to throw him down the hallway to focus on the other demon rushing him. Dean blocked the second demon’s knife strike with a block of his forearm before using the angel blade in his hand to stab her in the center of the chest. Dean turned to look at Cas but heard another set of footsteps approaching at the other end of the hallway the last demon appeared to be reaching for the gun that Dean had lost curtesy of the first demon. Dean flicked the angel blade in his hand in a simple rotation and threw the blade before the demon had a chance to pick up the gun. The blade sunk into the demon and dropped it to the floor. The hallway appeared demon free for the first time since Dean had stumbled upon the ambush.
Instead, he heard Cas let out a loud sigh and felt Cas guide his leg back down to the bedside. Dean let out a breathe of relief and moved to prop himself up on his arms. Cas offered him a hand to help him to a sitting position which Dean gladly took.
“Well let’s start with the basics. Instead of Build-A-Bear we’re gonna do Build-A-Childhood. Jimmy was a few years older than me so we could stick to that if you like.”
, thought Dean.
Dean thought before the light bulb went off in his head
“Cas, I’ve got this. Why don’t you make yourself a cup of coffee and I’ll feed Jack. You look dead on your feet.”
Meeting Ketch outside the ballpark was nice enough. He was shorter than Cas expected. His hair and eyes were darker than Dean’s too. He was handsome but not as handsome as Dean. They made their way inside and stopped at the concession stand to get food for the game before heading to their seats. Ketch complained about everything from the price to the smells to the low quality of the American food. Cas tried to brush it off without thinking how much Dean would love all the food there.
“There may be something we could do.”
All the talk of Cas and Jack needing him less was bullshit. Absolute trash.
“The ocean? That’s so… that’s a great idea.”
“Sam ate the last of my honey and hazelnut spread?” Cas asked suspiciously.
“I have a proposition for you.”
Things were not fine. The thirty-minute car ride back to the farmhouse was silent and a chill not belonging to the winter weather hung in the air. Cas never looked Dean’s way and his hands were closed tightly around the folder in his lap. He was pressed as close to the passenger side door as he could be but to Dean it felt like miles between them. As the pulled into the drive, Dean shifted the Impala into park in nearly the same spot he had picked Cas up that same morning. It felt like a lifetime ago. Whatever was happening, Dean needed to fix it. Now.
The ever compassionate and tolerant doctor must have seen the panicked looks on their faces and with a gruff laugh switched gears. With many years of experience under his large belt, Dr. Stern took their hesitation in stride.
Sam watched Dean carefully, gauging his reaction further. Dean knew exactly what he had been looking for, a reaction from Dean. Any big change in their lives and Sam would glance at Dean to see how he was doing. Dean found himself doing fine. Doing better than fine even.
"Promise?"
In that moment, Dean felt his heart falter and imagined Jack and Cas leaving him here in the bunker and returning to Heaven. Cas may have been lying to start with but the temptation of a safe place for Jack to grow and the promise of being an angel again could cause Cas to switch sides.
“I’m perfectly capable of driving my own truck,” Cas would mutter just enough under his breathe that Dean would have to focus to hear it which Dean always did. How could he not listen?
Dean reasoned that the burn was a permanent reminder of how many times he fell as an angel including his final fall. The only thing Dean could remotely compare it too was if he were walking around with the actual scars from the hellhound that had shredded him. Thankfully, when Cas rebuilt his body the claw marks that ripped apart his stomach were washed away. Dean wouldn’t want to look at those either but that didn’t stop Dean from sneaking glances at the feathers anytime he got the chance. He couldn’t help it, they were calling to him.
He immediately tried to give off calming and caring vibes to keep the woman at easy. He didn’t want to scare her off by intimidating her on accident. Years spent working with victims, Sam knew that he could make himself appear helpful and friendly despite his stature. It was his specialty and he was good at laying it on thick if needed. It was a point of pride of his not that he tried not to brag about.
Dean took the phone and put it down next to Sam, “Hey Kit, Dottie’s on deck and your turn to pitch.”
Dean thought rising from his bed. He opened the door to see Sam standing there when he was expecting to see Cas. Cas would have been expecting Dean to be at Story Time. Sam gave a nervous smile. Dean didn’t return it. Sam tapped the papers in his hand against the palm of the other as Dean waited for him to speak.
and now you’re putting me on
He was lying in a meadow. Tall brown grass surrounded him and green vegetation poked through the dull grass with vibrant colors. He could hear the putter of water of the nearby stream. The tree he was underneath offered some shade with its star-shaped Maple leaves but sunlight peaked through and landed upon him as the breeze shifted the branches. The sun was low in the sky and the color of the sunset was beautiful. He knew where he was. It was peaceful. It was like Heaven.
Dean hadn't been sure what to think of Bruiser but Bruiser clearly liked him.
, rang a voice loud and clear. Dean did not talk about his feelings.
“First things, first Dean. I need you to show me the spell and the last ingredient.”
Cas spoke this time, hesitating at first to bring his eyes from Jack to the doctor, “When Jack was five months old, he stopped breathing one night. About a month later he had another episode but it was minor. A… doctor that night recommended we have one on hand just in case something like that happened again. The doctor then was worried about asthma.”
Typing the buzzwords from Mackenzie’s explanation of massage therapy led him quickly to websites talking about intimacy’s effect on healing, feeling better, and overall health. It kept going. Best ways to produce those hormones. Their healing powers. Dean was reading articles about cuddling with a friend or partner created even more benefits. The articles about sex promised even more. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had sex. He was deep in the thought of wondering when he last even thought of sex when the knocking interrupted him.
The only time Dean found a moment of peace and quiet was when he was finally able to retire to his room in the evenings. On the nights Cas had Jack, Dean would struggle to find excuses to retire early and slip away. He would spend all day talking, reading lore, and teaching that he needed time to decompress. He was also trying to do his part for Jack even on nights that weren’t his. It was understood that 7PM was story time followed by PT and he was pretty much left alone after that. For that, Dean was grateful.
After a long time, Dean wasn’t sure how long and he didn’t want to get caught sneaking a glance at his watch, the party of angels had enough. Naomi spun Dean around and he was shoved into the wall by another angel. Her voice was steady but her eyes held nothing but impatience and anger.
“Nah, think I’ll stretch my legs before I have to sit in this chair for an hour. Jaq, do you care if Cat comes with me?”
Sam flipped the rug and noticed a faint demon trap painted on the underside.
Sam never mentioned meeting his new neighbor but then again sometimes Dean didn’t always listen the best after his double shift. Usually, Sam would drone on and on about how great Bruiser is, the boring cases at his law office, and that Dean needed to get out more. Most of the time Dean would try to listen before zoning out and nodding occasionally.
Comply and help the angels find Jack and Cas.
“Listen Cas-“
Dean tightened his grip on Cas’s waist as Cas pulled his hand from his bloody side and grabbed Jack’s grace with it.
Speaking of house guests, there was a surprising lack of people hanging around. Usually, there were people milling about wherever Dean went but they were completely alone in the kitchen. All three of them noticed Dean but Eileen was the only one to give a little smile and wave. Pushing down his anxiety for what came next, Dean took the seat next to Cas. He carefully clasped his hands in front of him and looked around. They were trying to act naturally but all of them were fidgeting. Dean decided to project a lot more confidence than he was feeling
Cas didn’t fall for the bait and rolled his eyes at Dean’s antics, “You were never the last resort. I’ll wait and walk with you, Dean.”
"Wait, you said you were going to tell me how you met Cas. You never even got to that part," Jack said with a frown on his face. He looked like he was worried he was being duped.
Now, it was Cas and Dean’s home. A home for them to raise Jack right and give him all those little experiences the grandkids got that neither his Daddy or Papa experienced. They locked the doors silently and made their way back to the bunker not long after they cleared the pizza boxes. On the way, they got another dozen pizzas for the hunters waiting at the bunker who likely knew about what Cas and Dean had spent the day doing.
“Hey, I’m walking here!”
“Hey guys, I may have something over here.”
“Sam, we don’t have to do this,” Eileen said besides Sam, startling him back to the present.
Cas looked down at the floor for a second in concentration and Dean’s heart stopped.
"Cas, most people’s partners end up doing this for three reasons. The first is usually the person doing the PT is a little tired and sore and they may not be able to reach the affected area. Second, it’s hard to effectively massage yourself. Everyone in the world knows its better to get a massage from someone else instead of yourself. No research necessary on that. It will also be hard to get a good massage with the brace covering such a large portion of your leg. The brace will need to come off so Cas can reach the entire knee and thigh unrestricted. The brace goes on immediately afterwards."
Seven days ago, things changed again.
Owl hoots sounded off in the trees nearby and the moon illuminated the pathway from the house to the barn where they stored the cars. The snow crunched underneath his feet. Baby was parked in the first stall of the partially decrepit barn. Cas’s truck was parked next to the Impala in another stall. Dean climbed into the driver’s seat and barely allowed the ignition to turn before he was pressing the accelerator to the floor and maneuvering the car to the front of the house.
“Well, that’s a little rude don’t ya think.”
Sam was having a great time as the parade winded down. Music drifted away from them and the street was growing quiet. The official end of the parade was signaled by a friendly golden retriever wearing a t-shirt that read “Come Back Soon.”
Dean was officially released from the hospital 7 days after waking up but that didn’t stop him from being an annoying presence at the hospital. Upon his release and with clear instructions to rest so as not to damage his leg further, Dean did the most Dean thing he could do which was not listen to a damn thing anyone else recommended and do whatever the hell he wanted anyway.
He yanked the covers off himself and swung his legs off the bed, feet landing heavily on the floor. A jolt of pain shot through his leg. He gasped and nearly reeled back onto the bed in pain. He couldn’t think, he could only feel-
“Here’s the thing, we found the perfect house for Cas and Jack. Big yard, acres of land, sturdy old house, no emf readings, the whole shebang. Old man didn’t even die on the property. But it needs a lot of repairs and Cas can’t fix the house and raise Jack by himself. Since you’ll be training the new recruits for a while, I was thinking of splitting my time between the house and the bunker. I was thinking two to three days here and the rest of the week with Jack and Cas. I’m there fixing the house and helping with Jack then I’ll be here doing whatever you need me to do.”
“It has nothing to do with hockey!’
When the others weren’t holding Jack, Dean was. Late at night, when all the women had gone to bed and leaving Dean and Cas alone, Dean would just hold Jack. He tried to memorize the way his face bunched up when he was about to cry and the way Jack moved his arms when he laughed. Cas didn’t protest when Dean brought Jack to his room every night and Dean would fall asleep listening to his breathing. The late-night bottles were no longer a bother and Dean found those quiet moments of feeding Jack uninterrupted in the kitchen in the early morning hours to be a blessing. Dean could feel his heartbreaking and the kid wasn’t even gone yet.
“We’re good. Just looking for someone,” Dean said as he glanced around again hoping to spot Cas and escape this overly friendly conversation he hadn’t wanted to have.
“Turn around,” Mackenzie ordered.
“Tell you what, we’ll take care of that here and get you connected to a doctor in town who can take good care of Jack. I think I may even know the town doctor and if he’s who I’m thinking of then you couldn’t be in better hands. Good guy, great with kids and families of all backgrounds, and an old friend of mine. Jack should probably be put on a vaccination schedule too if he isn’t already when he is feeling better. I think I have everything I need to get a treatment plan created. One of you will need to complete the intake paperwork and you can you sit at that table over there. The nurse is setting everything up now.”
“Don’t you dare compare this hunk of junk to Baby,” Dean replied with no heat. It felt good to bicker with Cas about nothing.
For the first time in what felt like a while, Dean told the whole truth. He hated the loud bunker and had been trying to be a good friend by pretending to be happy to try to cheer Cas up. Sure, he liked the people but he didn’t like living with them. He ignored the part about Sam.
She looked around the room before landing on the grace vial on the table. Her eyes calculated something quickly. Billie turned her head back towards Dean and let her body language relax. She was trying to pass off the air of someone who didn’t truly care but her eyes were as hungry as a starving wolf. She spoke slowly and without much emotion, “How about this: Jack’s feeble life in this moment for that archangel grace-“
Dean hadn’t thought about that. It would be nice to get out and do work with his hands especially on classic cars. Stewart definitely seemed interested in talking to Dean more. “You sure about that? I promised I would be here for you and Jack”
As Dean learned about more about Cas, Dean found himself learning to like Jack too.
Dean could tell that they had practiced before giving him the news. They spoke to him like he was a flight risk who wouldn’t understand if they didn’t talk to him like toddler. Even Dean’s GED brain could understand this. Cas was leaving. Cas was leaving and taking Jack with him. Dean wasn’t invited.
He lowered the notebook slowly and gave it a soft push across the table. The notebook slowly slid to the middle of the table before stopping without a sound. Eileen had to lean forward this time to get it.
Sam didn’t deserve to have to cry over another lost love Dean had told Cas who had listened intently as Dean ranted on and on about the situation that night while playing pass the crib. Cas asked with a raised eyebrow if he was actually mad that Eileen had faked her own death to protect herself or if he was worried that she would break Sam’s heart if she left again. How was that damn angel so perceptive sometimes when it came to Dean’s feelings but had to be taught to refill an ice cube tray yesterday was beyond his mental abilities. He chose not to dwell on it.
“Fine, good to know I’m the last resort. I’ll meet you in the garage in a few minutes.”
“Cas?”
In day-to-day life, Dean was able to work through most of the pain that came with his shattered knee and femur. But on Dean’s bad days, he wanted nothing more than to down a whole bottle which is why he always tried to grit his teeth and push through it. Dean had gone as far as to force Cas to hide the pills somewhere he couldn’t find them and only Cas had access to.
“I can’t believe you would
“You told me boring is lame.”
Cas looked confused and wary at Dean’s response. He tried to meet Dean’s eyes again but Dean wouldn’t let him. One of the seats on the other side of the table creaked and Dean saw Sam shift uncomfortably out of his periphery. His vision focused back on Cas when Cas leaned forward towards Dean. Dean put more distant between them by shifting away from Cas. He needed space. He needed space now.
Sam clenched his teeth and brought a deep breathe through his nose, “Yeah.”
“You’re telling me you’re fine with everything I just told you?”
“Yep! Aunt Ei, what’ you favorite dinosaur?”
Mackenzie said the most important thing Dean should bring was a good attitude and willingness to try when she introduced herself. Mackenzie said she was going to make him work to better himself. Mackenzie said that they would go easy on their first visit together.
The time read 7:48 when Dean cut the rumbling engine in his spot in the garage. Cas let out a big yawn which Dean mimicked seconds later. Jack had fallen back asleep an hour ago and was conked out with his neck hanging in a position that made Dean’s ache in sympathy immediately. He was getting old when a day of easy driving made him sore and when he thought about sleeping on his neck wrong made it hurt.
“Why did you look at Cas before you said that?” Sam said with a laugh at Dean’s forthrightness.
Dear old Cas didn’t care about that at all. Blew past it twice when Dean brought it up as a matter of fact. Cas’s attention was focused on the small reminder that the town’s farmer’s market was inside the elementary school’s gymnasium for the winter. Every day that was brought up in conversation until Cas asked if Dean would be interested in going Saturday night.
Dean couldn’t believe it and asked in disbelief, “Why? Did you have a death wish?”
Dean looked up and was met with an intense stare from Cas. They silently conversed for a long moment before Dean nodded and Cas spoke again, “We will follow your plan unless we can come up with something better in the meantime.”
“Dean, that’s not-”
Two weeks ago, everything changed again. Dean had been attending Sam’s mind-numbing Intro to Ghosts lecture complete with corny jokes. He had fallen asleep head on his hand towards the end until the question-and-answer segment at the end where he gave practical advice. That part Dean enjoyed because he got to be more hands on.
I want-”
“I think we can all agree that Dean’s injury and Castiel’s… Castiel’s current status are likely permanent. Whatever happened in that clearing the day Lucifer died, despite our efforts, cannot be undone. If anyone has a better idea or thinks of something later on, we can try again. But at this time… things will remain as they are. Sam and I have only one matter to discuss privately,” Hannah said miserably. She didn’t look at Cas as she spoke. This was a small battle lost out of the mighty war won for all sides.
“Dean, we are family. You taught me that. You and I sharing a last name would never be a problem, now or ever. Especially when it comes to Jack. You are too important to us.”
“No, we need him now. Heaven’s restoration needs to begin immediately.”
Until Day 6: Trash Day. Then, Dean understood.
The garage was at half capacity with the new hunters beginning to go out to explore the world filled with pizza, people, and movies. Baby sat there in all her glory shining like a beacon. The keys jangled as he pulled them out of his pocket and unlocked the door. The door creaked in a familiar way that sounded like music to his ears. He went to slide in when his false tranquility was displaced.
Cas was directed to follow the nurses on duty to the back who had stopped everything to help them. That was where Jack would be immediately seen. A small hand stopped Dean in his tracks. The nurse running the check-in asked him to fill out an intake form. It wouldn’t take long she promised when Dean cast a worried glance after Cas. He watched Cas disappear through the doors and nodded in acceptance. Dean swallowed down the feeling of fear and tried to clear his mind.
Dean looked up and met Cas's eyes. Cas raised his eyebrows at him. The story he had told made Mary and John heroes and less like their flawed, human selves. It certainly was a contrast to the John that raised Sam and Dean on the road.
Bending low to get in the oven and reaching tall shelves were still hard for Dean to get things out of with the cast so Sam was frequently playing fetch for him. He didn’t mention it but his leg was killing him. Dean also recognized that if they didn’t soothe Jack soon he was likely going to be headed towards a full scale meltdown. Whispering calming words and praise, Jack quieted almost instantly and began to fall asleep in Dean’s arms.
“Fine, I’ll do whatever you want. Just let the girls go. Also, don’t you angel dicks have any manners? I don’t even know who you are.”
“Did you mean it?”
Dean took a step back from Cas, “Uh, here?”
“You’re just looking for a hook-up, Clarence. Not a marriage. As long as he wraps it and isn’t too creepy, why not try to have a good time. The best way to get over an ex is by getting under someone else,” Meg said waggling her eyebrows suggestively.
“So how did we end up there?” Cas asked again which reminded Dean of the entire point of the conversation in the first place.
Sometimes, Cas would sit on the floor with Jack trying to coax his first official word out or just talk to Jack as they watched Dean work. Jack’s incoherent babble was adorable but watching Cas trying to convince Jack to say “Daddy” or “Papa” made Dean’s heart full. Most babies didn’t start speaking until they were about 10-12 months old Dean had learned in several of the childrearing books Cas had made him read. Cas was insistent that Jack would be an early bloomer, even without his grace. He was making syllable sounds like “Da” and “Pa” so it was a real race to see who would win the first word. His first official word came when he was ten months old and it was “Dada” which had Dean and Cas bickering about if he was trying to say Papa or Daddy.
“Goddammit.”
Dean couldn’t believe that Cas was rolling over so easily. In all the years Cas had stood by their side, he had never witnessed Cas go down without a fight.
Cas blinked at the doctor. The pain from thinking about Kelly was clear.
“Yeah, surprised you knew that.”
Questions about Jack’s diet and growth were all answered. Even their recent move into the house in a new town was discussed. It felt like Dr. Hines wanted to know every intimate detail about their life so when the next question came, Dean couldn’t say he wasn’t surprised.
It was when they were sitting on the floor as Jack crawled around chasing blocks in the early afternoon after their visit to the ER that Dean brought the topic up. The wooden alphabet blocks were brightly colored and Jack loved when they were spaced out. He would crawl to them before bringing them to his mouth to slime them. It was as gross as it was cute.
It got worse when Dean realized that the reason the hunt went sideways was because the spell hadn’t worked properly. Cas had sent a picture of the witch stopping spell to Dean’s phone but the picture had distorted and cut off the last ingredient necessary to make the spell work. You would think sending a picture from a magical bunker to the middle of nowhere Montana wouldn’t be too much for modern technology. Thankfully, Dean was able to reach his gun while the witch was busy tossing his brother. Two witch-killing bullets later, she was dead.
Sam took a shuttering breathe before saying, “I didn’t want to bring the one to bring this up but we don’t even know if Cas is still in his vessel. There are no signs of any angel grace left. There were two wing prints in the clearing. Mom seems to think that Cas somehow survived because he has heartbeat and brain activity. Jimmy is in heaven so that is a good sign that something might be in there but he still hasn’t so much as stirred...”
“What did you do?” Duma asked accusingly.
If he had shocked Dean by having two cats, that was nothing compared to the horror Cas felt when he turned around to see his tortoiseshell next to Dean on the couch and sniffing his outstretched hand.
Taking his time to stand, Dean carefully leaned his weight to his right side. He tried to pretend that the stiffness from the lack of PT and spending most of the last few days hiding in his room wasn’t there. He had also skipped his session with Mackenzie for the week. If he pretended to be fine long enough, then Cas wouldn’t notice.
Short and fluffy Sam chapter where we get a lot of Dean and Sam before some long angsty Dean chapters. Sam chapters will get longer as the story continues and I swear things start going down at the farmhouse very soon!
Dean found Cas trying to scrub the dirt from under his nails in the kitchen. He went to open his mouth to make a joke about the dirt clogging up the sink when Cas’s stomach gave a hungry rumble.
“What’s the phrase, ‘a dime for your thoughts?’”
Maybe Dean finally went camping with Sam and Eileen since it was late summer and Sam had been begging him to go. The good big brother Dean was promised to take his fully-grown adult little brother on a long camping trip before the summer was through. Dean said Cas would be free to come if they went they last time they had talked about it but Dean must not have invited him knowing he was busy. That was what Cas was telling himself because why would Dean go so quiet otherwise.
Dean made his nurses’ lives hell over the next few days. He would escape his room the second a nurse turned their backs to read a chart or respond to a code. They would try to force him back to his own room only to find he escaped again 10 minutes later. Dean would steal crutches or a wheelchair to get to Cas’s room with his morphine as his only companion. Once he even locked himself in Cas’s room when they tried to take him away for the third time that day on Dean’s fourth day in the hospital. Sam had even berated him for that one. All he did was sit next to Cas’s bed but the nurses seemed adamant that he return to his room.
Cas didn’t ask what happened when Dean said he needed to be picked up. He just showed up with his truck and Jack in his car seat. Cas put Jack in the back seat of the Impala, helped Dean slide over to the passenger side, and drove them home. Sam picked up Cas’s truck on their way back into town. Cas never judged him and Dean was forever grateful.
“I think I’m good actually. I have this book. The weather is warm and I parked in the shade. I’ll just hang out here.”
The next thirty minutes or so Dean spent limping slowly around the bunker much to the growing impatience of the angels. The nudges forward when Dean would hesitate at a turn grew more aggressive and one nearly knocked him off his feet.
That morning the kitchen was busy. He had tried to swing by like it was a normal day and found six women mass preparing breakfast. Flour and bacon grease flew through the air and it looked like a war zone. One older Mexican woman thrust a tray at Dean and told him to take it to the library. When Dean didn’t fight back, she put her hand on Dean’s face with a smile and said, “Thank you, mijo.” She turned her back to Dean in a clear dismissal and Dean followed her orders with a small smile at the thanks.
“I don’t think that’s necessary-“
“And the wee little Winchester clan would like me to do what exactly?” said Rowena slowly, annunciating every word like she couldn’t believe they were dumb enough to call her about this.
Bruiser was 60lbs of low-to-the-ground mass. A white stripe went down the left side of his face which offset the snaggle tooth poking out from his underbite on the opposite side. He breathed loudly, snorted often, and waddled like a pregnant penguin. About 2 minutes into meeting Bruiser, he flopped on Dean's feet with a big huff. Drool trickled out of his mouth onto Dean's shoe. Bruiser wagged his stumpy tail as both Sam and Dean bent down to give him belly rubs.
The hallway still had people wandering around but Dean walked past them with his eyes focused ahead. Nobody tried to stop him. He heard footsteps following behind him but pushed those back and just focused on moving forward. His brain was surprising numb and he let that feeling spread throughout his body to smother any other feelings who thought they were worthwhile enough to make an appearance. Frank’s words about faking it rang in his head clear as a bell.
“I have a video of him laughing at it,” Dean said quickly.
Cas glanced up at Dean. His blue eyes were wide with panic and had a glossy shine to them. His hair was wild with disarray. He was wearing one of Dean’s oldest and most holy Metallica t-shirts and a pair of worn blue sweats. He looked frazzled and like he was coming undone.
It became immediately clear to Sam that as much as he wanted to raid his brother’s room to find answers to the questions he had running through his head Sam would not do that. It had taken years to fix broken trust between him and Dean that they both had built. There would have to be another way to find out what was behind the door.
Kaia swallowed nervously and glanced at Claire before meeting his eye, “Claire did… force me into the car. But we really did talk and she explained everything to me. The other worlds are scary and I hate going into them but I am willing to try. I think. Claire offered to let me go but I told her I would go with her.”
Sam thought. It warmed his heart to know that they wanted Eileen and Jack to be able to communicate. Not that he ever doubted they would but knowing they could be doing something and actually doing it were two very different things.
Dean spent the day learning how Cas liked caring for Jack and more about Jack’s signals and favorite things. When the night rolled around, Cas wheeled Jack’s crib from his room to Dean’s and shuffled about nervously before Dean forced him out the door an hour later so he could get some sleep. Jack gave a small cry the second Cas left and Dean’s anxiety about the night to come amplified now that they were alone.
The anger came rushing back. Dean never stood a chance. He would never win this fight. Cas didn’t respond and that was all he needed for an answer.
Biting the bullet, Dean answered honestly, “Cas is thinking about moving out with Jack.”
“I’ll take what I can get,” Sam said gratefully before rising to go pack his bags.
The grace sprung from the vial and spiraled all around them. It slowly rose and encased them in blinding white sphere. The sphere shielded them from the rain and casted a white glow. Dean noticed how bad Cas looked now that they were no longer in the dark hallway of the bunker. The scar from the angel blade peaked out over the partially torn collar and his burn was almost fully visible. He was pale from blood loss. Exhaustion rolled off him in waves.
Dean thought desperately.
The ever polite but socially awkward Cas greeted the women before asking to sneak in to grab one of Jack’s sippy cups out of the cupboard. At one point, he bumped into the backside of one woman and apologized profusely. The older woman winked at Cas whose blush deepened further as the woman laughed and told him he was fine. Dean tried not to laugh loud enough that Cas would hear him.
His wife Jaqueline was much easier going in nature. She didn’t seem to care that Cas and Dean were “married” even with the matching cross around her neck. She smiled at them every time and Dean once even caught her elbow Brandon right in the stomach when he grimaced when Dean called Cas “babe”. He apologized to his wife and Jaqueline smiled brightly at them.
“Don’t even worry about it. I hope you have better luck find something you both like this time.”
Cas had clearly rehearsed the reasons he wanted to sell honey. Dean couldn’t help but think that part of Cas’s pitch sounded like the MLM schemes that bored housewives do. He wasn’t trying to stop him but he wanted to make sure this was something Cas was going to do because he wanted to, not because he was worried about their living situation.
“Cas.”
“You know that means I’ll be spending most of my time with Cas and Jack to start with? I’ll come back here on the weekends.” Dean said as he tested the waters.
“Do you really believe that Sam or are you just trying to make me feel better?” Cas asked.
Cas paused to consider for a moment before releasing the bottle to Dean with a great sigh. He slipped the burp rag off his shoulder and gently placed it on Dean’s left shoulder (gross). Cas rested his hand on the shoulder where the handprint all but faded away in a way to say thanks. This sent a buzz through Dean’s skin directly into his brain. Cas slowly retracted his hand and offered a small smile to Dean.
“All the angels heard it. They only sent four to scout. It could have been a trap and we should have heard something-”
The second week, Bruiser did the same but this time he tried to run away with it and Dean had to trap Bruiser between his legs to free the poor bin.
“She did.”
“Cas…”
“Sam, I need to see him.”
Sam gave him the sad, closed mouth frown that showed he was trying to sympathize with Dean and knew if he said anything Dean would likely bite his head off. He didn’t want anyone’s sympathy. Least of all Sam’s. Jody didn’t say anything but she squeezed his should for a moment when he rejoined their side. Mary looked at Dean and her eyes said it all. Dean couldn’t even look at Eileen or Donna. They were all sorry Dean was still broken.
“Are you guys having fun?”
“Our goal next year is to clear space out behind the barn and create an herb garden. We are already planning the layout and fencing. That way we don’t have to buy the herbs or spices we use for flavors in the honey. Won’t be able to do all of them but it’s a good start. Most fruits we’ll still have to buy elsewhere but Natalie may be able to get us a deal from her supplier,” Dean continued on.
Dean thought as he forced a happy and endearing smile on his face. He was going to lay it on thick.
“It’s really too bad you’re retired. I’d offer you a job right now if I think I could get away with it,” Stewart said jokingly.
“Yeah, I heard from Cas. The second one this month.”
“Does it have something to do with your suspicions?”
When Dean didn’t respond, Cas continued a little more nervously this time, “Dean, there is no pressure for you to decide how and what you want your relationship with Jack to be. If you need to take some time, please do. Jack and I will take you anyway you’ll let us have you. You could be an Uncle. You can be nothing. You could be something else completely… You could be Papa if you want even though, unlike the story, we are not romantically involved. You are basically his other parent already but if that isn’t what you want then I understand completely. Jack and I both would love for you to be Papa but the only important thing to me and to Jack is that you’re here.”
Billie met Dean’s eyes with an intense gaze before turning away. She pulled her scythe from the wall and it scraped against it in a terrible screech. She walked away for a few moments until sudden requests bombarded her.
Between each band was approximately two to four inches of space. The bands were cushioned on the inside and had industry strength Velcro adjustments that connected to the plastic/metal skeleton of the brace so Dean would be free to adjust the tightness of the bands based on the pants he was wearing. The stiff plastic/metal skeleton ran from the very top of the first band down his leg all the way to the bottom of last band on both sides of his legs.
Dean let Sam’s words wash over him. He glanced over at the playpen where Jack was sleeping. It all clicked into place. They would have to use Jack’s grace in some form to open a dangerous portal to another world long enough to bus an undetermined number of people through.
said demon number 1.
“Oh, right.”
“It sounds like she loved you just as much.”
Sam hadn’t been sure what he was fishing for by asking Dean about their attendance with their doctor but he hadn’t found out any information that would swing his mind about the room situation one way or another.
“I couldn’t let anything happen to you again.”
“No problem, babe. Anything for you. You know I would do whatever you asked.”
Try as he might, Dean couldn’t keep a smile off his face. He grinned at Cas who looked even more suspiciously at Dean.
A Land Before Time movie was played for Jack who watched the movie wide eyed on the floor. Like the first night of their visit, Dean and Cas were sitting on the smaller loveseat while Sam and Eileen were snuggled on the opposite couch.
The nod came slowly from Claire before Dean forced himself away from her and Dean felt himself for the second time in six months being pushed forward. His knee creaked and complained immediately. Dean ignored the pain as his leg adjusted to him trying to run when he took off after Cas, slower but still in pursuit.
Years of things like Cas growing closer to his charges (mostly Dean), Cas doing everything to stop the Mark of Cain, Cas charging Lucifer giving Sam time to drag Dean back through the rift.
He just nodded in response to her instructions. Dean needed to keep her talking until he could disarm her or fight back. He silently cursed himself for having only his pocketknife on him.
Cas must have surprised himself with his outburst because his eyes went wide. His words shut Dean up too. The idea immediately sparked in his mind like a match in the darkness and the idea spread like a gasoline-soaked forest. Dean felt like he got smacked by another semi.
“What about me?”
That had become abundantly clear the previous weekend when they had one of their few adventures out of the house and into the small town. They had gotten a town newsletter in the mail for the first time a few days before. It was a detailed little thing. Full of gossip, birth announcements, marriage proposals, and other small-town what happenings.
“You mean that? The whole Papa thing.”
Natalie gestured to all four of the kids as she spoke. The twins were talking with an older white couple who Sam assumed to be grandparents. Wallace was setting up the eggs on his portion to sell them and was wearing a t-shirt that talked about video games. The youngest kid was coloring in a unicorn coloring book.
Maybe the rain wasn’t drowning them after all, maybe it was washing the slate clean for the first time.
He would not give them the satisfaction. He may be broken and useless but he wasn’t completely stupid. He wasn’t a bomb. This was just another decision since the day of the accident where Dean wasn’t even consulted until the decision had been made and Dean was expected to go along for the ride.
“Something you did, something you didn’t do, either way a cranky angel is a cranky angel and it always has something to do with you.”
“What do you think the rug is for?” Mackenzie asked cheekily.
Unfortunately, x-rays to check his progress couldn’t occur because the risk of Dean catching on fire was “not low” he had been told. Apparently, the company was already getting sued they found out weeks later when eight separate patients at other hospitals had caught fire while having x-rays done. Lawyers had been sent to serve papers to said company but they disappeared off the face of the earth like a ship in the night.
Dean felt offended at that, “Hey now-”
Dean didn’t have any words for that. Charlie was right. He was worried about Jack growing up in the bunker. He had been for a long time. Jack shouldn’t grow up in the center of an organization surrounded by nothing but problems, monsters, and death. Not if they could help it. He deserved a normal life with a normal yard that had a regular swing and homework.
An explosion rocked that little clearing sending out a blast of pure white angel grace in all directions. Later, Sam would tell him the explosion caused power outages for a 60-mile radius and the equivalent of a small earthquake was detected. In the moment, however, it felt like an atomic bomb had gone off in that clearing.
Dr. Hines narrowed his eyes at this. For the first time, he appeared disappointed in their answer and Dean couldn’t help but feel bad. He felt like he was failing Jack as a parent for not having a doctor ready and waiting in the wings.
Instead of punching Chad, he shifted his eyes down to his wallet for his card and replied, “Jack was asking Cas for some juice.”
“No problem, you’re staying in Cas’s room. We thought you would two would be more comfortable in an actual bed instead of the pull-out couch in the office that we are still fixing up. It’s a disaster in there. If none of those work, you and Eileen could share Jack’s crib that I have disassembled in the basement. I’d love to see Cas tear you a new one for breaking that.”
Dean’s response was curt and short, “Hi Sam.”
Dean felt himself bristle unintentionally.
“I still think we should try it. Worst thing that could happen is I’m wrong and we are stuck walking to town.”
Dean didn’t have time to think more than that before one of the other monsters made a grab for this other arm. Dean instinctually swung the crutch at the monster who ripped it out of his hands before shattered the crutch over her knee. The third monster rushed him and punched Dean in the stomach hard enough to knock the wind out of him but earned a punch from Dean in return. The fourth monster had snuck around Dean’s back and grabbed one of his free arms as the first monster did the same.
There were two hardware stores in town: the big box store and the local one called Jefferson’s and Sons’ Hardware. Dean preferred the local one despite its use of apostrophes. Sure, the big box store offered anonymity but the local hardware store felt cozy and made Dean feel calmer. More adjusted to normal life. They were trying to assimilate after all and they needed to do the best they can. If the local store didn’t have what they needed, then they would need to swing by the other but Dean was trying to make as few as stops as possible because he wanted to be outside and take a long drive if time permitted.
“Heres ya go, Uncle Sam. Daddy plays with this one, but he said we need to share. Right Daddy?”
Dean felt his chest tighten and he held his breathe. Cas would be worried about their friendship suffering or Dean stepping out on Jack because Dean had the potential of being an ass.
Dean expected a lot of answers but a dramatic eyeroll was not one of them.  Sam responded, “Sounds perfect to me actually.”
Cas already felt dirty from the hours of scrolling, swiping, and getting terrible messages that he almost force closed the app at the sight of something somewhat normal. He decided that’s exactly what he would do after looking at Dean’s pictures.
Satisfied he gathered the first round of angels, Cas’s thoughts brushed against Dean’s telling him it was time to go and they began to pull the 12 angels away from the nothing back into their normal plane of existence. It felt to Dean like they were pulling them out from a thick tar pit below the earth until they reached the surface and, with a sudden snap like a taunt rubber band, the angels were free. Cas gently placed them on the ground of their plane of existence before launching back up.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“How did you even hear that?” Dean asked.
Eileen must have read his mind because she told them what happened. The stitches had partially ripped when Charlie had been roughly moved after the initial fight. Eileen had stitched Charlie back up while Dean and Cas had their standoff. When the standoff was over, one of the angels guarding Charlie and Eileen came in and healed her internal wounds, including her massive concussion, only in order to save her life not that long before Cas and Dean had arrived. The angel left the stitches and let the rest of the wound to heal naturally to conserve grace for their return to Heaven.
Only once did Dean not take Bruiser on his evening walk on trash day and it was then that he discovered another one of Bruiser’s “quirks”. When the bulldog had figured out he wasn’t getting a walk that evening, he started screaming bloody murder and did not stop until Dean picked up the leash.
Third, lots of callbacks and scenes from other seasons of SPN, even season 15, so hopefully it isn't too cliche.
Dr. Hines returned two hours before they were released. He suspected that Jack something similar to an asthma attack like they had all pretty much assumed. He assured them that infants almost always grow out of their asthma phases or at least get better control over it as they grow. Diagnosing an infant with asthma was difficult and Dr. Hines didn’t want to do it but so far their treatment strategy had proven effective so they would continue on.
Before Dean had a chance to ponder that further, Cas wandered up with few plants in his arms and set them in the cart.
Dean turned to find a brunette woman looking at him in earnest with a baby in her arms. The woman was behind the table for a bakery and had an apron wrapped around her waist that was clean and neat. She smiled at Dean when he looked at her and the hint of a Southern drawl underlaid her words. The baby in her arms was mixed race, stinking cute beyond belief, and around Jack’s age.
Bobby had taken that particularly hard and it was when he was drunk that evening they found out he had lost his only son to the war. Dean caught Charlie crying in her room that night after spending the day comforting the others. He held her through it when she sobbed into his chest about missing Kara and her parents. He hoped Charlie’s parents in this world’s Heaven would want a second daughter.
“Don’t worry about me.”
“Sam is taking most of the hunters out for a field exercise and all of the cars are going to be in use.”
“That doesn’t mean-“
Six days ago, Dean approached Sam with a plan.
Dean thought,
Sam swallowed nervously and nodded.
“Cas, we can watch Switchblade Sisters with Claire when she gets here. I’m sure she’ll like it.”
The store was now run by one of the sons, Brandon. He was the God-fearing type who wore a cross around his neck, went to church every Sunday and Wednesday, and clearly didn’t believe in birth control because he regularly brought his wife Jacqueline and their five nearly identical, bleach blonde sons into the store. It looked like each kid had been copied and pasted two years apart. When they first met shortly after moving in, he told Dean once that he didn’t have a problem with his “lifestyle” but asked that he not kiss Cas in front of his kids. Brandon then invited him and Cas to church which Dean managed to wiggle his way out of only barely.
Dean deals with the aftermath of his fallout with Sam and Cas until an argument sends Dean spinning in a new direction. Two redheads knock some sense into him.
“I think I do. Please tell me more,” Cas said. His voice sounded… robotic. No inflection of emotion. Stone-cold. Controlled.
Cas talked about the angels breaking down the door to try to take Jack. Eileen told them about them trying to take on the angels and their quick defeat. Dean didn’t meet Sam’s eyes at the mention of that. He had failed to protect all of them, especially Eileen, in that moment. It was then Dean’s turn to tell about him leading the angels on a wild goose chase until they lured Cas out. Cas took over the story after that.
There were three regular attendants to Story Time every night: Cas, Jack, and Dean. Dean rarely read out loud despite how much Jack liked his voice so more often than not he would hold Jack and bounce him on his lap as he sat the floor. Part of the reason was he didn’t enjoy the pressure of having to perform for Jack and the other is he liked listening to Cas’s deep voice tell the story in a tone way better than anything he could muster up. Who knew the former monotone warrior of God was good at creating character voices?
“Dating is stupid anyway. You were right not to date anyone and only hook-up. I get it now.”
“I don’t know, Dean. Probably the ER. He’s human now so I think they would be best suited to help him. Angels can’t fix this. Nobody at the bunker can fix this. He needs a real doctor.”
Dark circles under his eyes made him look older which was certainly saying something since he had been alive since the birth of the universe. A burp rag was thrown over his shoulder haphazardly but Jack had clearly spit up on Cas earlier if the crinkled state and stains on his shirt were anything to go by. He was wearing a pair of raggedy sweatpants and an old Henley of Dean’s that must have gotten mixed in with Cas’s clothes.
How could it not be more after everything Sam had seen the last few days?
Cas and Dean didn’t say much when the nurses left. Cas pulled out his keys and handed it to Dean. Dean played with the shark keychain Dean had bought him when they went to the aquarium for a brief moment before saying goodbye. Two hours later, Dean sent him a picture of a happy Dr. Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm sitting on the couch with a text saying Dean would pick him up at 8AM like the doctors had wanted.
She swallowed and nodded in response. It took the rest of the appointment time after Hannah and Balthazar left for Mackenzie to come out of the daze. She had been asking questions about monsters, demons, and angels, had a minor religious panic about her lack attending church (Cas assured her she didn’t need to worry, Chuck didn’t take attendance, Dean said he didn’t give a shit), and a small fear for her lesbian sister’s eternal soul (Dean said that wasn’t a concern either and told him about their Charlie kicking it up in Heaven). When her phone buzzed in her pocket, she told her dad who was chief of police for the town that she was fine and the stalker hadn’t appeared.
Mackenzie eyed the newcomers. She must have known she was outnumbered but still held the bear spray in her hand. Mackenzie sternly said, “Make them do something,”
Sam registered the conversation moving forward but something was sticking in the back of his mind. The thought was poking at him relentlessly in a desperate attempt to tell him a piece of pertinent information. He took another bite of his slice of cake when the thought exploded. It was the recognition was he had never seen their office after Dean painted it the first time. Or the second time. What else had he missed? Then, it dawned on him and the force of the realization felt like a punch to the gut.
“Want to talk about it?” Eileen asked.
Dean eyes darted from Cas to Sam. Sam was shaking his head and waiting for Cas to stop talking to reply. Cas was fuming at the thought of subjecting Jack to that kind of treatment but something wasn’t sitting right with Dean. Dean thought back to their conversation, Sam wanting more people, his comment on Jack being strong, the question about the cars-
The high school football, soccer, and volleyball teams walked past and handed out flyers to their events, stickers, and temporary tattoos of the local mascot. Soon enough, Sam was roped in to helping Eileen and Jaqueline press these temporary tattoos onto Jack and other kids who lined up for their turn. The marching band was fantastic and Sam enjoyed their rendition of the Ghostbuster’s theme song.
A few minutes later and much too soon to Dean’s humble opinion, they broke apart.
Also, thank you for the kind comments. They keep me going.
This time the notebook slid a little too forcefully and nearly flew off the edge of the table. Eileen had to scramble to catch it. She read over his note and frowned in confusion. Dean realized his mistake immediately. Gesturing for her to return the notebook, Dean carefully wrote his response.
He wasn’t going to mention Jack at all. She was smart enough to connect Jack’s age with the date of the accident but he wasn’t about to lead a horse to water. Dean was compromised, Cas was likely going to be compromised if he came in, the last thing Dean would do was risk Jack’s safety too.
“You sure you can get all that and get here in time?”
Jack had woken up around 7AM and Dean had intercepted Cas on his way to feed Jack. He sent his friend back to bed for a few more hours of sleep before Cas finally woke up for good. Despite how truly exhausted he was, it was nice to get back to something simple like feeding and caring for Jack even if Rowena watched him with an unreadable expression most of the time.
“So, the ALH. Isn’t that something to do with hockey?”
"I'm fine. Just wanted to make sure you didn't stink up your room so much that Eileen was forced out. I know how you get with Mexican food."
There was a pause and the papers stopped ruffling together behind Dean. Sam stopped what he was doing for the first time and Dean saw him replay the conversation in his mind before responding, “That sounds like a lot of back and forth.”
Charlie spoke slowly and caringly, “Listen, I don’t agree with Cas moving out right this second but he is right about not raising Jack in this life. Pretty soon hunters are going to go out and come back beaten, bruised, and bloody. Sometimes they won’t come back at all.”
Dean thought to himself.
Dean knew as the grace faded that everything else had healed except his stupid leg. Any hunger or thirst faded immediately and he felt a rush of energy. The truth settled over him immediately. His leg was beyond angelic repair for some reason.
Plus, it’s not like Dean wanted to come back to the bunker anyway! Dean wanted an out. He wanted to be with Cas and Jack. Rowena had used her big favor to try to get Dean to see what he wanted by trying to force his hand. Dean wanted to be with his two fallen angels and he needed a push from Sam to do it.
When Dean finally made it the kitchen, he was still grouchy. He ached all over and he was bone-tired. Jack had screamed loud enough last night to wake him up despite being a few doors down with Cas. He had gotten up to check on the pair and found Jack wailing.
“Fine.”
Dean and Cas had always had a close and, dare he say, more profoundly bounded. In the years that followed their initial meeting, they had grown closer. Purgatory increased that ten-fold and when Jack was born it practically went off the charts. When they started physical therapy, Mary had been the one to note that they were somehow even less hesitant to touch each other which Sam had to continually bite his tongue to keep from talking about. Cas had lost all reservations about touching Dean at all once that started. But Dean especially was less hesitant.
Cas squinted at Sam suspiciously and Dean grew a little more annoyed, “Yeah, we were there. In the same room and everything.”
It was that moment that Cas reappeared near Dean’s shoulder. He had gotten distracted back at the goat pen and wanted to talk to the family about raising goats much to Dean’s disgust judging from the groan he had let out when they had been shooed away.
Jack sat raptured at the story of how Mary Campbell and John Winchester met, fell in love, and kicked ass in between. Dean played it out, letting the Jack dangle on cliffhangers when Dean had to take a break to do something in the kitchen.
The other thing he noticed was the pain in his leg faded too. The spills and falls from running and fighting yesterday were gone. Disappointment coursed through Dean when he realized his leg had returned to his new normal. The pain was still just as it had been a week ago. Dean stamped down his experimentally and nearly bent over double when the jolt of pain ricocheted from his knee to femur and back. He grit his teeth and saw Cas’s hands reach out to grab him from the corner of his eye.
“Sam, can you check out Bobby’s arm?”
As the consultation was ending, the doctor started speaking again. Dean didn’t look at him or acknowledge him as he spoke. Turns out he didn’t need to because Dr. Sands plowed along anyway.
“Why are you here?”
Cas and Dean bickered for a bit more and Sam just watched as the two friends became so wrapped up in their own little world that they stopped noticing anything or anyone else. Eileen nudged herself into his side so he wrapped an arm around her pulling her closer to him. His stomach was full and he felt himself relaxing more into the comfortable couch. There was a certain amount of contentment just hanging out and watching the events in front of him unfold.
“It’s time for stretches.”
“See everything’s fine,” Claire said with false positivity.
“Here I was thinking that I would call somebody that would smite you on sight. Silly me,” Cas said sarcastically and a roll of his eyes.
“A job?”
“I’m going to look at houses tomorrow.”
Once sitting, Dean rubbed the back of his neck. He waited for a minute before he gestured vaguely at the door and said, “Well that was about as much fun as getting frozen in carbonite but we should probably call it a night.
“I told you about it,” Dean said defensively when Sam broached the topic. Dean seemed a little offended that Sam thought he should be paying.
The bottle had drained and Dean shifted Jack so he could stand and grab a rag for burping. Not even a few minutes later Jack was sitting on his lap happy as a clam. He was at the stage where he was sitting mostly upright by himself and he reached his chubby little hands out to grab the cloth someone had put on the table in front of them. Jack started babbling.
“I’m taking Jack and we are going back to the cabin. Jack’s presence is obviously making you uncomfortable.”
“I knew there was a reason I liked you,” Dean said with a smile which Eileen returned.
Dean was prepared for Jack’s attack. He caught Jack midjump who laughed as Dean carefully tossed Jack into the air above him before catching him again. He tossed him a few more times much to Jack’s glee before lowering Jack to sit between his legs so they could watch Cas together. Dean opened the container for Jack who immediately began to eat. Cas had paused to watch Dean and Jack at the edge of the garden but returned to his duties once Jack had settled down. Jack settled into eating his snack and even feeding a few pieces to Dean. Slowly, Jack ate less and calmed down which meant that Dean got to watch Cas more and more.
Dean, Cas, and Eileen filled them in on the bunker attack. They all pulled up chairs around the nearest table. Cas sat next to him and Dean gestured for him to hand Jack over for the millionth time that day. Cas hadn’t put Jack down since the rift opened and had turned Dean down every time before. Even when they were waiting for Sam and Mary to come back through the rift, Cas didn’t set Jack down while he fed him.
Cas slowly opened his eyes and Dean could tell that he was forcing his emotions back. He looked to the ceiling and let out a long sigh before turning. He met Dean’s eyes and Dean saw layers upon layers of shame and hurt in Cas’s. The blue eyes that were usually happy or tired or content were trying desperately to hide the sorrow he felt for himself. Dean let his own disappointment and grief for Cas show. Cas only held the gaze for a second longer before looking away. He walked slowly away from the angels and back towards the human faction. Away from what he was no more.
Once the meeting wrapped, he slipped away from the handshakes and back pats, into the safety of the corridor outside. With head down and his index fingers rubbing circles into his temples in an effort to thwart the threatening headache, he longed for the peace and security of his own office. He had lots of emails that needed his attention. He headed through the cubicle farm praying he wouldn't get stopped for a signature or some other stupid reason.
“Don’t you listen to him, baby. You’re perfect just as you are.” Dean grinned at him with an already full mouth of crust and apple.
“Oh you mean the guy you snatched in the bush and the two you left knocked out in the park? Like I said, I appreciate you.”
“You haven’t seen anything yet, Cas.” Dean promised. Cas whimpered when Dean surged, attacking his lips, rutting harder. Cas couldn’t help himself, moaning into Dean’s mouth at every thrust, painfully hard in his pants. Dean eventually pulled back to find a gasping wrecked Cas with kiss plumped lips, heaving in gulps of air.
Cas pulled himself up and hobbled out of the shop, leaning heavily on the door, allowing Dean to see his state more fully. Dean’s face fell in concern. He dashed out of the car to Cas’ side, cupping his face to look at his bloodshot eyes closely. “Jesus, fuck, Cas. What the hell happened? How many did you take on? Fifty?”
Dean leapt up. "No no I have to apologize for last week. I have been under crazy pressure. I didn't drink much, but I was so tired it went straight to my head and made me weird. I swear I'm not normally like that. I'm so sorry."
Cas nodded, waiting longer than was strictly necessary to follow, as he was afforded such a nice view of Dean’s ass in those jeans. Snapping out of himself, he carefully carried on after Dean, missing the muffled laughter of the girls below him.
your car??”
Gabriel ran and caught up with Zach, he grabbed him by the shoulder from behind. “Show me your phone.”
“Get a team over there, now! And where is Agent Novak??”
“Good?” Cas cocked an eyebrow in disbelief. “Well, that’s subjective. Nice? Maybe they were nice?”
As soon as Dean stepped into the room, Mick revealed himself, in Freddy Kreuger make-up and gear. “Dean-o! How you doing? Know i can’t frighten you.”
“I got this!” There was a brief lull in shooting, Cas stood up to fire, but dropped down again immediately when several rounds were fired back at him on sight. “There’s more than one.” Cas admitted sheepishly.
Linking arms with him and guiding them back to Garth, she excitedly flailed her arms as she said, "Come on now Boss, you know you couldn't do without my designer skills. I keep this place afloat. You don't have to do anything except look pretty. Everybody wins!"
After two rounds, Dean's eye was drawn to the opening door. A guy walked in, bundled up with a hat against the cold. He was after disappearing so far into his scarf that only eyes were visible, but what eyes!! Even from this distance he could see their electric blueness. The guy looked athletic, not built, but he could very well be hiding some lean muscles under all those clothes. By this time he had unwrapped the scarf from his face and removed his cap. His pale face and black hair were probably adding to the impact of his eyes, but damn he was gorgeous! He couldn't ever remember being stopped dead by seeing a person like that. He took his breath away.
While pondering his options, Cas opened a few shirt buttons, rolling up his sleeves to the elbow. Fuck it was warm in here. He came back to himself, bringing his beer to his lips, glancing to the dance floor.
Cas parked his silver Ford in the car park of a sleepy B&B. He opened the boot to retrieve his things. “They’ll have identified the car with the traffic cameras by now.”
Cas ran off with such force that as he looked after him, Dean suspected he may still have his wings. He turned and saw that Sam was also gone.
Back at the attack site, Alastair surveyed the burnt out vehicles with distaste. They searched the area for footprints.
he goes again.”
The bike slowed to come around the back of Dean, coming right up to his drivers window. With his eyes on the road, Dean simply reached out, caught the guy’s jacket, yanking him off balance. The bike careened away, almost taking out one of the enemy cars. The guy was now being dragged along, legs screeching through the dirt, held in place at the neck by Dean. He grasped at Dean desperately. Dean cocked an eyebrow at him, angled the gun in his lap up, and shot. Dean then let go. The car right behind panicked, not wanting to drive over their fellow soldier. They pulled to the side, hitting the sloped wall, the whole car tipping over onto its roof.
The days leading up to Halloween had Sam making trips to the nearby town to slowly gather what he needed. He was trying to keep this as much of a surprise as possible. The bunker had lots of rooms they never used so he hid everything in one of those. On Halloween itself, he sent Dean and Cas on a supply run, claiming he needed certain items that couldn't be found in nearby Lebanon. Dean grudgingly agreed to drive to the next town over. Cas automatically volunteered to go with him, as Sam knew he would.
Rasputin moved around Cas, nodding to his colleague from earlier who had just brought in a full bucket of water. The third man was nowhere to be seen. Cas almost laughed. “Waterboarding? Really?” The goon started to put on thick gardening rubber gloves. “You know, I was in the CIA and we don’t do that anymore.”
“As the ruler of my nation I will do as I wish, without exception and without apology!”
Ten minutes left. The tension grew within the courtroom. Metatron pulled off his glasses and stood to address the judges. Garth watched with contempt.
“Your name is Dean Winchester?”
Gabriel smirked at Cas. “Well, we’ll figure it out, Cas.”
Gabriel put his head down, wiping his own eyes, before looking back at his brother. “Me too, Cas. Don’t worry about it.” He wiped Cas’ eyes, noticing him shift in pain.
“Why am I here, Gabriel?”
Cas smiled at him sweetly, taking a deep breath, pulling Dean’s face to his so he could whisper against his lips, “I love you too, Dean Winchester. So fucking much.”
Cas was so relieved he left out a big laugh.
“Yes! April 17th 2012 he invited me to his palace.”
The other agents whipped open the side door, which was now angled directly upwards, and returned fire to the balconies. Once clear, they climbed up and out, joining the fight. Gabriel still rolled on the floor in a daze.
“Okay, about 60km to the courthouse, almost an hour’s drive. Buckle up and get comfy.”
At the street level exit, Cas slammed into the wall at the turn of the stairs by accident, unable to stop. He turned and legged it up the last short flight of stairs, coming to a shopping street. He sprinted along the road, tie flapping in the wind, blood leaking down his face. The two Belarusians weren’t far behind him. Again, Cas pulled everything he could into their path: boxes, racks of clothes, more bicycles. The Belarusians dodged as best they could, but one did run head first into a clothes rack on wheels, falling back.
Zach joined in. “We have taken every precaution to make sure that your involvement is completely classified.”
Cas turned his head with a cocked eyebrow to answer, just as he heard Dean snore softly. Cas put his hand on top of Dean’s on his chest as he drifted off again.
he did, I’m merely perusing the reasons why, and there’s a plethora of those bastards.”
“You know, he really cares about you.” Several picnickers struggled to jump out of the way. “He just has a hard time processing emotions and shit. Whoa!” Dean ducked as another bullet came much much too close. He glared back at the other cars, crashing through a line of parked bicycles next to a playground.
Cas closed his eyes, wishing for strength. He gave a small sarcastic smile with gritted teeth. “Buckle up.”
The vendor shook his head, throwing his tea towel over his shoulder.
Cas stood back as Sam and Jess posed for a few photos. Charlie stood for a costume specific pic. “Put those glasses on, Dean.”
Dean smirked before suddenly dropping to his knees, fumbling at Cas’ belt. Cas’ head thumped back against the door in breathless anticipation. Dean took out a very hard Cas, giving him a few solid strokes for good measure, mouth watering at the sight of such a beautiful dick. He leaned forward to press his tongue into the pre-come covered slit, smiling as he felt Cas thrashing above him. Dean didn’t have the patience for teasing at this moment, so he deep throated Cas with ease, amused when he felt both of Cas’ hands shaking in his hair. Dean sucked and licked and teased as much as he was able before Cas had to grab the base of his dick. Dean looked up at him with hooded eyes, delighting in the sight of such a dishevelled Cas, breathing deeply, eyes clenched tight as he willed himself to not come. Not yet anyway. Again, Cas was glad the loud music covered up his needy whimpers.
Cas again ignored him, turning around fully. “We’re going to take the north stairwell.” He moved past Dean, who stood his ground until Cas was past, then he ran for the fire escape door. Cas rolled his eyes as he turned back. He should have anticipated this, thinking that’ll teach him for giving Dean some good painkillers earlier. “Fuck!” But it was too late.
Cas leaned forward, getting his lips around the spoon, slowly pulling back so that his mouth would catch everything. No sense in starting a fight if he could avoid it.
Dean huffed a laugh, heart almost stopping when he spotted the wide toothy grin Cas was giving his brother. Cas then looked up to him, smile growing even wider. Dean truly didn’t have the words for all of the love and relief coursing through him, so he just squeezed Cas’ hand instead, hoping he’d understand, and hoping he wouldn’t notice how much Dean’s hand was still shaking.
Dean groggily came to, head back on the armchair, staring up at the blood bag. He righted his head to see Cas bare chested, one arm in a clean shirt, distracted by his phone in the other hand. Dean didn’t move, eyes roving up and down Cas’ firm chest and abdomen, smiling slightly at Cas’ adorable frown, perfectly tousled hair, bulging biceps. Even his facial scruff and hint of chest hair were sexy. Cas licked his lips, with Dean following every minute movement.
Crowley’s tears bubbled up for a moment, and he looked away with emotion. Eyes still on the moving numbers, Cas mouthed to himself, “Soon”.
“He didn’t drop me.”
Cas pulled a bag from the back seat, heading up the steps, knocking on the locked door. A dark shape filled the glass before the door opened to reveal a big burly man. He nodded to Cas, opened the door wide to let them in, locking it after them. He wordlessly went behind the desk, took a key and handed it to Cas, who passed him over an envelope.
“Shut up.” Cas laughed as he stretched slightly. “What time is it?”
Cas fished the warm chicken rolls out of the bag, tossing one and a water bottle at Dean. He caught them enthusiastically, tearing the roll open and wolfing it down.
“Yeah? Thanks so much.” Cas made to open the side door before Dean stopped him with a hand to the shoulder.
