Even though Dean wanted nothing more than to have Cas next to him, the thought freaked him out for too many reasons. It was one thing to fantasise about a dude, another completely different thing to actually spend the night or some hot hours with one, and yet another, absolutely terrifying thought, to wish for far more than that – body and soul. Or was it grace? Body and grace, then – whatever, it never would happen, anyway. And he certainly
He was sure her laughter would haunt him for the next few days. “I’m fine, Sam. This ain’t my first rodeo. Remember, it was me who took care of the witch while the three of you were still licking your wounds.”
Though, as always, he had done the only thing reasonable and retreated. Quickly closing the bathroom door behind him, Dean rested his back on the cold wood to steady his nerves and to fight off his body’s reaction to waking up to a view like
Actually, there were no words for it. There was no hope, no happiness. It was worse than everything he had ever imagined. That was Chuck’s ending? Hell, in that case he had liked his discarded drafts a lot more. What Sam had told him about his dreams, they had all ended in tragedy, but at least they had made sense. This though? Over the years, he had imagined a lot of endings for himself. Hell, he had stood in front of a frigging shelf of books about the death of Dean Winchester. Death had a fine collection. Until now, he always thought he had mastered undermining his hopes and dreams. But this? This was the worst. Vamp-mimes? Yeah, granted, it sounded a lot like him. He shuddered when he remembered there even was an entry in Dad’s journal.
It's kind of fitting that this chapter falls on this day. It's probably one of my favourite chapters of the fic, if not the favourite.
Dean couldn’t believe his ears and barely managed to keep his breath steady. “Moron!” He cupped Cas’ cheeks in both his hands and rested their foreheads together. “
Deep down during his dream, Dean could still fell the explosion and the heat, the adrenaline rushing through his veins, always accompanied by the world-shattering horror that embraced him the moment he realised his mother wasn’t there.
Dean pushed him away. “Shut up! That’s enough feelings crap for now.” Despite his obvious gruffness, underneath Dean seemed to be sorry about his own ingrained reaction. Well, if Castiel was right, and he profoundly hoped to be right this time, they had their whole lives to work on that. One day Dean would be able to accept praise without the immediate need to talk it down.
“Maybe you wanna put the windmill in your garden. You know, the garden you always talk about. Flowers for the wild bees and insects, and rabbit food to feed the moose…”
“Oh!” Jack’s surprised reaction sounded through the finally bright lightened library and startled them.
A shudder ran down his back when Dean cupped Cas’ face with both hands, his thumbs still brushing away residual and newly fallen tears. Without another thought, Dean dove forward until his lips found Cas’.
He tilted his head and stared back at Dean who was still grinning at him, as if knowing a joke Castiel didn’t get. It wasn’t anything new, granted, but Dean’s behaviour suggested that he wanted to share it with him, that this was something of importance for the hunter. Dean was giddily waiting for him to catch up.
angel,” Dean insisted, but he started to pray to him anyway. “Cas? Castiel? You got your ears up, buddy? Get your newly feathered ass down here. The ladies wanna talk to you.”
“Dean, you needa tell him.” Donna was frustrated. She couldn’t believe Dean, after everything that had happened, was still too chickenshit to talk to the angel. “You can’t ignore it. You can’t ignore
Their eyes met. After all these years, he was still mesmerized every time it happened. Seconds passed with neither of them breaking their connection. Taking a deep breath in anticipation of what he now knew would be happening once Dean closed the distance, he finally nodded.
Witnessing his friend’s breakdown firsthand, unable to help, Castiel acted out of instinct. “Dean.” He closed the gap between them and slung his arms around Dean’s shoulders and kept him in a fierce hug. “Shh!”
“Oh, there it is. Wondered where it had gone. Tried to get us back to sleep. As if I’d go back. Tsk! Look at this!” He pointed in the dark void around them. “There’s so much potential.” When Gabriel snapped his finger, a brightly lit spot with a chair in its centre appeared behind him. Immediately, he let himself fall down into the soft cushions, just to jump up again, pointing. “Hey, that Cassie?” He knit his brows. “Poor fellow doesn’t look good.”
Although he couldn’t see it, he imagined the frown appearing on Cas’ face. Glancing over for a short moment, he saw that he had won the bet. Cas was frowning at him, glaring at him. “I don’t understand.” Yep, head tilt – there it was.
There he was, fallen, his powers decreasing, facing the two most powerful archangels in existence. He knew it was suicide, but this was where he had to be right now. Stull Cemetery was the only place he needed to be, the only place he wanted to be. Right here, helping Dean and Sam and Bobby to stop it; to stop the Apocalypse. After all, Dean was only human and he was right in the middle of it. No, not
Two heads shot up in the corner behind a shelf, one barely able to look over the top of it. Moments later, Sam came running towards them, Jack walking behind.
“Aren’t I? What a shame. I was looking forward to it.” The witch drawled and she even had the nerve to wink.
As soon as he saw what was inside, he knew he had to thank Sam and Jack for their choice of wardrobe. It might not be typical wedding attire, especially not for the beach, but this wasn’t a typical wedding. This was exactly what Dean needed. It would certainly help him to calm his nerves. And it carried some of his best memories of them. “I’m your huckleberry,” he mumbled.
After sharing some more kisses and cuddles – sue him, those were awesome – Dean eventually headed to the shower, alone, which actually had been the right decision. Taking the shower gave him some much needed time and space to process this morning’s developments, though processing was the wrong word. It all still felt like a hell of a dream. Cas had already shattered his world with a simple hand job and his angel was open for more. And so was Dean. So fucking much. Not that sex with Cas was everything, it was just the icing on the best cake he ever had. Especially when the cake was pie. Then again, icing wouldn’t be appropriate on most pies.
For the second time within minutes, Sam crushed Dean with a hug, burying his head on his older brother’s shoulder, sobs shaking his body.
... You died. Cas, you died right in front of me and I couldn’t do anything. I ... uh ... I can’t do that again. I fucking lost you ...” Dean’s voice broke.
“I’ll try. Don’t worry, Sam ... Dean.” A figure was kneeling right in front of him, and Dean pulled his bent legs even closer to his body, making himself as small as he could. “Dean, look at me.”
Everyone had given up on Cas. Sure, they had helped, nonetheless. After a month, Sam had accused him of being obsessed like Dad. Eileen had looked at him with sorrow in her eyes, pitying him. Somehow they had looked right through him, put the pieces together and knew exactly what had happened back in the dungeon.
“Shut up!” He couldn’t have this conversation. Not now. Gladly, Sammy seemed to get it and kept his cakehole shut.
Dean came to the same conclusion. “So, technically, you’re still in charge. You always can change things when they don’t work out. ‘Hands off’ or not.”
“I love you, Dean Winchester. Don’t you dare die again.” Castiel took Dean’s hand in his, intertwining their fingers, and brushing his thumb over Dean’s knuckles, before he brought their joined hands to his wing, inviting his friend to explore.
“Seems valid. I can live with that,” Dean mumbled, swallowing the last bite. “Though, you know what I like even better?”
Taking a deep breath, he got up, ready to get on with the pyre. A flap of wings, a sound he hadn’t heard in years, brought a smile to his face.
They couldn’t get all four of them into Baby and drive down to Garden City, hoping they would find a solution there. He would never forgive himself putting Sammy in danger during a hunt. All his childhood he had been drilled to keep his brother safe whatever the cost. And he had done it over and over again.
“No.” Dean raised his arm behind his head, scratching his neck and contemplating how to explain the concept of fiction to the kid. Why was this so difficult? Why hadn’t his nerd of a brother or Cas already dealt with this? They were the brains after all. “No, they didn’t lie. There’s a difference between a lie and fiction. People like stories. They like to tell stories. Some people invent whole universes, fill them with characters and give them a history. Those stories are told from one person to another or they’re printed as books. Other stories become plays in the theatre, movies or TV shows. Hell, some authors might even take a real event or person or place and tweak a story around them. But it ain’t a lie. It’s just a story for entertainment or education or whatever they intent to convey with their stories.”
Castiel had listened with a heavy heart, especially to Dean’s inner musings and hopefulness that were broadcasted loud and clear through the dream. With a last look to each of the Winchesters – Sam trying to read his textbook, but being too absorbed in his brother and father’s conversation to actually follow the text, John driving on and looking tortured and obsessed as ever since the night that had changed his life, and Dean being Dean, doing everything to hold his family together, always trying to keep his hopes and dreams hidden from everyone, even himself, pretending not to feel a thing, though silently suffering deeply – Castiel concentrated on returning to reality.
Remembering what had happened earlier when he had left, he turned fully towards his friend. Brushing his ear with his lips, he hugged him, whispering, “I’ll be back. I’ll always be back.”
“Sammy finally ran away with Sully, that’s what happened. He nearly it did back in the day. So why not now?” Dean shrugged, hating himself for even telling Cas as much. As much as Dean had tried to compose himself, he knew he couldn’t hide shit and wouldn’t last any longer. Loosing Sammy because Dean had gone on a hunt and left his brother behind was the universe telling Dean he had screwed up on the big scale.
“I thought you’re ‘hands off’,” Dean asked gruffly, yet Castiel heard the warmth underneath. Whatever was going on between them, he gently squeezed Dean’s hand, and was rewarded by a gentle flush and a shy smile.
It broke Castiel’s heart to see what Dean usually hid from himself and everyone else and Castiel wished he could observe his friend more often in this serene state. However, he had given his word all those years ago. He had respected Dean’s request ever since, for almost a decade, and he wouldn’t break his promise now.
“So, what do you think, Cas?” Dean grinned. “Burgers? I need Sammy to be fed properly for once.” He wiggled his eyebrows at him and Castiel couldn’t help to comment with a full-body eye-roll.
“It is?” How should he have known? It wasn’t that he had been in his right mind when he stormed into the library. “Whatever, brinner anyone?”
Releasing his brother from his grasp who rolled his eyes at him behind his back as soon as he couldn’t see him anymore, Sam turned towards Castiel, hugging him too. “Thank you,” he whispered in his ear. “He needs you. You’re good for him. Almost too good.”
“Shuddup, Gollum. Heard you the first time. But guess what?” Dean took another step in their direction. “I’m here to take him back where he belongs.”
“Jack?” Dean huffed. “You barely stopped him from disappearing after Dodge City. No surprise there either.”
“I can help you with that. I’ll fly you back to the bunker and return here so Dean and I can follow as soon as we are finished.”
Dean looked at the angel next to him, still unable to comprehend he was really his. Seeing that Cas was also zoning out, he squeezed the hand that had never left his since they had come to the library. “Whatcha thinking?”
Of course, this was the moment the Shadow chose to interrupt, this time they looked like Meg. “Thief. He’s mine. Go away! You woke him up and made it loud. You don’t belong here, human.”
Severing the connection finally, Castiel let his gaze wander down along Dean’s body, only stopping right in front of where he was kneeling. A tiny smile flit over his face, and when he abandoned his pants for a short moment to let his fingers brush over Dean’s erection, he looked back up at his gasping husband.
Donna had been next. She had already checked with Jody and the girls and everyone was safe and sound in Sioux Falls, celebrating a new start.
He could feel it. Sense it with every fibre of his being. This place was danger personified and yet it felt far too familiar. Memories transported him back to the stream, to the moment Dean Winchester had found him. There he was, the man he had left in order to save him. At least that was what he had told him, what Castiel had to believe himself. And it was the truth, part of it anyway. Leviathans were hunting him. There was a target on his back and a bounty on his head. He who had freed them from their eternal prison and encaged them again, was the biggest beacon inside Purgatory. Far more interesting than the human he had left behind.
Cas just stood there in silence and Dean could feel the angel’s unwavering eyes piercing through his whole being, judging him for not believing in his words. But how could he? Dean knew for sure that he wasn’t the person Cas saw in him for whatever reason.
Sam tried to suppress his grin. Cas never failed to deliver information in the most complex way. He complemented Dean perfectly. “Cas, that’s brilliant! Finally, we have a decent lead. Do you think all this is connected to a preschool?”
From there on, it all went by in a blur. Sammy was standing behind him as his best man, tears in his eyes. Claire had volunteered to do the honours for Cas, and had teased Dean from the very first moment they stepped before the altar. Jack had decided to do the ceremony by himself instead of kidnapping some random priest or registrar. That meant they were married by their three year old who also happened to be the new God. It wasn’t the weirdest thing that had happened to him in his life but it came damn close.
Eventually, after minutes, hours, or days had passed, Castiel wasn’t sure, Dean whispered, “You serious? You’re really interested? In
“Like that?” Dean, whose mouth had wandered even further south, looked up through his eyelashes, a grin splitting his face. It was an incredible sight and certainly didn’t convince Castiel’s human heart to pump any slower.
“Thanks, sunshine.” Dean tried to turn around in Cas’ arms and glance at the angel but failed. So instead Dean clung to the strong arms that held him and looked up in front of him where he was facing his younger brother’s amused demeanour. Or was it bemused?
Castiel glared at him and Dean lowered his eyes probably knowing he deserved it. “However, neither is this body incapable of nor am I averse to sexual intercourse. It’s a concept worth of examining with the right person. Actually, I believe it would make me very happy to give my partner what they want and need, and to let them take care of me. I just don’t feel an intrinsic desire for sexual contact as I understand most humans feel when they think of those they are attracted to. I would be more than happy for you to be that partner. Especially since you are the only one I ever thought of in that way.”
Images reappeared in his mind’s eye. “I remember that place. It was lovely. That’s the place where I returned to Earth after the Shadow let me go.”
“I have no intention to stop, Dean,” Castiel replied, “You’ve just to be patient a little bit longer.” Turning towards his own pants once more, he finally got rid of them in a swift move that took care of his boxers as well, relieving his arching erection from the too tight space it had been enclosed in far too long.
Dean uncocked his gun and slipped it into the waistband on his back before he squatted down and lifted his little brother into his arms. Who'd thought just yesterday he would be able to carry him so easily? Actually, it never had been so easy to carry Sammy around. Dean brushed his brother’s tears away with his thumb. "Come on, buddy! That's no place to rest. Wanna stay here with me tonight?"
The moment the words of the prayer hit him, Castiel was yanked back into the Empty. His eyes flew open and he awoke struggling, trying everything to reach Dean. He needed to save him. Dean was dying and he had to help. Yet he was unable to move, still bound by the Shadow’s clutch.
“Try it,” Jack replied enigmatically, a twinkle in his eyes. Dean would almost say Jack was excited. He could picture the boy seesawing in anticipation. What was that about?
“Cas, please,” Dean pleaded, coughing blood, “Lucifer. He– he is out there. Couldn’t stop him. Sam. You need to stop him. I– I won’t make it. I–” Another coughing fit stopped him. Raising his eyes for one last time towards his, full of emotions he couldn’t decipher, life went out of Dean Winchester.
“Wait! Let me help you, dear.” Why hadn’t he noticed his angel was sitting right next to him on the floor, caressing hiss head in a way Dean could get used to, and who now pulled him towards his lap? Cas helped him up, placing Dean between his legs, so he could lean heavily into the angel, half sitting and half lying, resting his head and weight against the muscular chest. If the situation hadn’t been this fucked up this would certainly feel kind of nice.
“Oh, come on, Cas,” Dean complained, but a shudder of anticipation, his gleaming eyes, and the beaming smile were indications of how much he enjoyed the ample attention he had rarely been given during his life.
Dean was the first one who cleared his throat and broke their gaze. He pointed with his thump back over his shoulder. “I ...”
Being the coward he had always been, however, he would chose nothing any day, just to keep their friendship alive. And how often had he even failed at that? There was no place in this universe, probably any universe, where they stood a chance. After all, he was Dean fucking Winchester, the personification of screwing up anything he touched with a speciality in relationships. Cas was too good for him, and the guy had already lost more because of him in the last ten years than in the billions of years before that. Dean just wasn’t made for relationships, but it didn’t mean he did not secretly dream of them – or rather one in particular. The one he wished for and could never have.
Sam grew squirmy in his arms, so Dean let him down. “Why don’t you two look for Jack while I cook? Sounds good?”
“You two were idiots. Not sure if that has changed now, though,” Claire chimed in, shaking her head.
When he started the motor Castiel thought of the last time he had driven Dean’s precious car. It had been during the time Sam and Dean had vanished without a trace after Kelly’s rescue. He did not like to be reminded of that trying time with no leads for weeks and the fear of having lost them, having lost Dean forever.
“If I understand the double entendre right, wasn’t that your intention the whole time?” Cas deadpanned, his eyebrows raised, but his thumb still brushing softly over Dean’s lips.
“And I woke,” Castiel finished the story, astonished. He had always wondered what had woken him. All these years, he had thought it had been Jack on his own, unaware of the role Dean had been playing.
It had been so easy to say the words to a lifeless body. Now, his mouth moved but his tongue seemed to be stuck in his mouth, leaving him once again staring at Cas, completely unable to form any words. He cursed himself internally and just acted. His hands cupped Cas’ face when he yanked him towards him, finally bringing their lips together. It was kind of rough and far too short but he hoped his intention was clear. Cas’ hands wandered to his collar and now Dean was pulled towards his angel. Cas’ kiss was tender and light and everything he could have wished for. He could feel his own broad smile mirrored on his best friend’s face. Dean’s hands found Cas’ neck and the short hair in the back and buried into it. He wouldn’t let him go ever again.
“Hell, yes!” Dean grinned against Castiel’s skin. Castiel could feel it. “If you show me how to fly, angel.”
Stumbling back, he could feel his knees giving up and he slumped to the ground, unable to breathe under the weight pressing onto his chest. His phone was ringing in his ears. The cold of the dungeon’s stone floor seeped through his body. Cas was gone. He had seen it. He had been there. And he had never told him. Cas never knew. Cas never knew how much he loved him.
And then suddenly, they were married. The first kiss they shared as newly wedded husbands was incredible, yet far too short and a mutual promise for later. Everyone rushed towards them to be the first one to congratulate them.
“It ain’t done yet. The pedestals are still missing. It’s supposed to be a tripod. With that height, I have to make sure it’s standing safe and not tumbling over with the first breeze. Even then, I’ll need concrete to anchor it to the ground.” Dean evaded looking directly at Castiel. At least that was Castiel’s impression. Kicking a loose screw across the garage, Dean mumbled, “Besides, it’s supposed to be a gift … you know ... for you.”
“Damn it, Cas,” Dean cried out. “Open the fucking door. This ain’t funny any more. It’s freezing and your stupid anchovy pizza is getting cold. Not to talk about me.”
“I prefer the word ‘oblivious’. Less dumb, less ass,” Cas deadpanned, still brushing the hair on top of Dean’s head. “Though now we’re two dumbasses who are still standing in the corridor in front of your room.”
Castiel loved the view on Dean’s face when his friend finally caught up with what he had said, his ears turning beet red. “Shuddup! That’s not what I meant and you know it ain’t.” Although the angle was odd, Dean gave Castiel a friendly shove in his side. On far more serious note Dean added soberly, “Do you really think it’ll work? That we actually have a lasting chance?”
Cas was dead. He was, wasn’t he? Dean had seen him taken by the Empty. Had he really come back to him? This still had to be a dream.
Dean paced up and down the library aimlessly wanting to hit something, anything, and resisting the urge with all fibres of his being. Alcohol was out of question, too. Not when Sammy was ... He would not turn into Dad.
Dean turned in his arms just enough to be able to look at him. “Did you just sniff me?” a broken, yet still challenging voice enquired.
Suddenly, his nerves caught up with him, and he stopped in his tracks. Cas took another few steps until he was held back by their still joined hands. He couldn’t do this. It was too much. Bloody hell, he was shaking. At once, all of Dad’s snarky remarks hit him, all the rejection he had been forced to experience ever since he had realised he wasn’t as straight as he had everyone let known for years and years.
It wasn’t as if he hadn’t successfully stimulated this body before but this was different. Something he hadn’t expected to this extent.
“What ‘what’?” Dean asked. Having started to knock at the door, his friend almost fell inside when it gave way. Still, Dean looked ridiculously hot, even more than usual, and especially with a frown on his face. Getting back on his footing, he was glaring at Castiel.
“What?” Donna shrugged. “Look at him. Look at Cas. They’re both very easy on the eye. Not that I would actively chase any of them, mind you, but a girl is allowed to watch some steamy stuff from time to time.”
“Okay,” Dean said, nodding, stealing a kiss from Castiel. “I’ll be waiting for you,” Dean whispered into his ear.
“Cas? You coming?” Sam called. Castiel sighed and walked in Sam’s direction, but not without another glance at Dean who was still sleeping peacefully in his car.
“Boys, get a room. There are children and a Zanna present.” Sully shook himself exaggeratedly and Sammy laughed about the Zanna’s silly antics. Okay, Dean had to admit they were funny, kind of, though he would never spill. Sue him.
“Stop right there with your shit-eating grin, Cas. I ...” Dean took a deep breath, “I love you, okay? Have for long time. You happy now?”
“Yes, Dean. Yes!” Tears, he couldn’t stop falling, were streaming down his face. “This is real. We’re real.”
The bastard had the nerve to look completely unfazed. But Dean knew he wasn’t, not after what had happened earlier in the car.
“Nothing?” Sam gestured up and down their attire, and Castiel remembered that they still were clad only in the clothes they had slept in. “You two
“Cas, he doesn’t think he deserves you, and the part of him that probably still tries to please Dad knows Dad would never approve of you.”
The kitchen fell silent at once. Dean nearly choked on the fries he was eating. He felt heat rising in him and supposed his whole face was burning red hot. In another world, another life, there would have been only one answer:
Castiel’s fingers gently brushed through Dean’s hair before he lifted him in his arms and carried him towards the Impala, wishing their physical closeness originated from happier circumstances. It was a strange caricature of the day before when he had left the scene with the other Winchester in his arms. How could this hunt have gone so wrong for the second time? Tonight hey had outnumbered the witch three to one and still she had not only managed to escape again, but to take out Dean.
No, now he was ridiculous but he still doubted their newly found closeness. He doubted the reality of their romantic relationship. Being honest to himself, the doubt that this was real would not leave his mind. He was still nurturing the thought that this was some kind of dream. It had to be because it was the most logical conclusion.
“Oh, I will be back when you meet the others. Don’t worry.” Jack smiled. “They are waiting, but they will have to wait a bit more.”
“You like it?” His friend sounded unsure and scratched his neck. It was a gesture Castiel knew all too well. Over the years, he had learned how to interpret it. But he still couldn’t fathom as to
Dean spoke quickly to answer the question before Cas could start with a lecture. “The piece inside you that makes you feel all kinds of emotions: love, anger, sadness, all of them. Without it you were just a robot, Sammy.”
Castiel didn’t need more to understand his intention. Heat was rising through his body, his grace unable to control its reactions any longer. It took all his willpower not to tackle Dean right here, in the middle of the field.
“Dean,” Cas said, trying to reach out, only stopping mere inches before he touched Dean’s arm yet again. Dean didn’t know how his friend managed to sound chiding and begging at the same time, mixed with a note of a broken heart underneath.
Listening to the hushed singing sounding from the bathroom, Castiel counted himself lucky to be as close to Dean as he let him, though it never would be enough. The one thing he wanted was something he knew he couldn’t have.
“You did, but I’m under the assumption that you were talking about getting to know my body. I would like to give you the release you’re craving. But if you want me stop, just say a word and I’ll stop.”
They both leaned in at the same time, bumping their heads together, before they managed to find an angle that worked. Still, their noses were in the way and they shifted again, until Dean’s lips brushed over Castiel’s. The kiss was sweet and chaste. Dean was smiling and Castiel knew he was too.
Reluctantly, Dean got up. Scratching his neck, he evaded looking at Cas for as long as it was possible. When Dean’s eyes finally shot up, both men were staring at each other. The whole table fell silent. Donna knew instinctively that this was it. She was witnessing something enormous and probably world shattering.
They headed down to the library and found Sam and Eileen huddled together over some ancient looking books. Well, if that was their idea of fun, he wouldn’t stop them.
“Cas, did you find him? Get this...” Sam looked at Castiel, before his glance shifted over to Dean, and back to Castiel. “Oh ... My bad. I’ll be in the library, in case you’re looking for me, which I doubt. Just remember, there’s a rugaru on the loose.” And with that, the younger Winchester was gone.
“You think you can crash Ladies’ Night without repercussions? I know you love chick-flicks, old man. Now act out your own,” Claire, who was sitting next to him, nudged Dean. “And don’t deny it. I’ve ransacked your DVD collection.”
Dean felt his face flush with a combination of anger and embarrassment. "Of course we'll have more kids if he wants to," he said, barely restraining himself from growling the words. "But they won't be Jack. You can't just replace one child with another."
Dread curled in the pit of Dean's stomach. He pictured Michael introducing Cas to some rich, handsome, nice smelling alpha, promising that as soon as they mated and married, he could have Jack to raise with his new husband. Or wife. From Cas' stories about his childhood, Dean had gathered that his family were old-fashioned. They would probably prefer to see Cas mated to a female alpha if it was up to them.
home. He won't want to give it up any more than I want to sell this place. And if I ask, he'll either do it just to make me happy, and then
Ms. Mills smiled. "While we were waiting for you, I gave Claire some crayons to pass the time. She drew this."
Castiel tilted his head. "Is this an actual concern or are you being dramatic? Because if you're really worried about the mating bond negatively impacting our sex life, that is definitely something we should discuss."
“No, but that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. I … I trust him, Sam. I don’t know if I love him, but I definitely trust him.”
At the end of the album there was a sudden time jump. On one page Jimmy and Castiel were eight or nine, and on the next they were all grown up, dressed in tuxes, and Jimmy had one arm around the waist of a beautiful blond woman in a white dress.
but only the original with John Wayne), childhood dreams (Dean: fireman, Cas: veterinarian or unicorn), and celebrity crushes (Cas: Brad Pitt, Dean: Christian Bale, Both: Harrison Ford), and had now moved on to siblings.
Her eyes widened as she chewed her first bite. "This is delicious, Castiel. Is that rosemary I can taste?"
"Neither did I. Didn't even know it was recorded." In contrast to the voice on the tape, Dean's real voice was small and soft. "Cas, I —"
"Maybe I'll just pay up anyway," Dean purred, nudging Cas's head back and nuzzling under his jaw, "and we'll call it a reward instead of a bribe."
She held out one of the drinks, and he accepted it with a soft "Thanks." She seemed so at home here, such a natural part of the family. He'd forgotten that she must once have been in his place.
Castiel nodded. "I think they would. Either way, it can't hurt to ask." He leaned into Dean again, exhausted and heartsick just from thinking about this awful scenario.
Dean lapped at the underside of Cas's cock, following the throbbing vein up to the hypersensitive nerve cluster just under the head. "Ghuuuh." Cas tipped his head back and moaned with abandon. Their upstairs neighbor was probably going to complain about the noise (again), but he couldn't care less. The familiar feeling of Dean's tongue combined with the new sensation of wet, chafing silk was indescribably good.
It was just Castiel today. Dr. Bradbury had wanted to meet with him privately to get some context for Claire's situation before they officially started treatment.
Castiel pursed his lips disapprovingly but obeyed. Much as he hated lying to Sam, the younger Winchester could be no help to them in his current weakened state, and if he got worried enough he might … no, he would
Before he could muster a defense, she was already turning back to the sink and saying calmly, "Would you mind giving Jack his bath and putting him to bed? You know that when you're here he won't go down unless you tuck him in, so you might as well do the whole routine."
my Christmas present, I do think it should be properly wrapped." He flicked his gaze pointedly down to Dean's cock. "May I?"
"What do you want us to be, Cas?" Dean asked. "You pick any label you like. You make up the rules and I'll follow them."
Before they had even gotten their overnight bags out of the trunk, the front door opened, and framed in the square of warm, golden light, Castiel saw Jack jumping up and down while a smiling Hannah kept one hand on his shoulder, restraining him from running out into the snow in his socks.
The movie was still playing, but the volume was low so it wouldn't wake Claire, and the wet sounds of lips and tongues getting thoroughly acquainted, plus the occasional moan or whimper when one of them found a particularly sensitive spot, effectively drowned out everything else. Those big hands that Castiel had been secretly (or apparently not so secretly) admiring for weeks slid under his shirt, and they felt exactly as good as he'd imagined, rough but gentle and undeniably masculine. A calloused thumb rubbed over his nipple, and he gasped, sucking breath directly from Dean's mouth which tasted like chocolate and caramel.
“Whatever!” Sam rolled his eyes and threw his hands up in resignation. “Just keep your hands by yourselves during the drive home. At least keep it PG. I need to keep my sanity. There’s only so much I can unsee until I need to bleach my eyes. And my brain.”
Although he still seemed anxious, Sam nodded again and watched Castiel expectantly. Castiel merely brushed the broken skin and sent some grace into the tiny body until he felt that Sam was fully recovered, though he still remained a preschooler. That was a problem Castiel was not able to solve alone. He had to inform Dean and let him decide. For now, Castiel was responsible for this little human. With a child it was impossible to stay on the hunt. And Dean couldn’t leave the bunker without bringing Jack or leaving Jack alone behind. Both options were not feasible right now. He had to return to the bunker with Sam so that he and Dean could find a way to restore Sam to his normal self, probably hunt the witch, and do all that with a new-born nephilim and a preschool-aged Sam to look after. Castiel really looked forward to it.
"Serves you right," Castiel said, grinning. "Thinking back, the story was never funny. How could I have known that Gabriel had left one of
If Cas only knew what he did to him every time he looked at him like that. It was like drowning in an ocean without knowing if one would ever hit the bottom. The sheer vastness of them never let him forget that despite his stunning outside appearance Cas wasn’t human. Cas was so much more, so much more intimidating and completely out of his range. And yet, every time Dean drowned in those eyes he wanted to let himself fall and completely give himself over to his best friend.
While Sam was driving, Cas skipped through their gathered information on the senior citizens turned toddlers. “Sam, we might have overlooked a vital piece of evidence. All of the victims, at least those of whom we have the necessary information, came to Garden City no later than at the age of preschoolers, which is exactly the age they were transformed into.”
“Oh, I believe Dean would love to find that out on his own,” Claire deadpanned and Dean blushed in the reddest shades.
Dean would never know what else Claire had nicked from the Impala’s trunk last night, not until he did a thorough inventory. It had been worth the few minutes she had lost in the witch’s pursuit. With the transmitter in the witch’s car, Claire had known she wouldn’t lose her.
“I am, especially if you are. And I would love to rediscover every inch of the body I once rebuilt atom by atom.”
“No!”–he wouldn’t stop here–“I want this. I want you.” Abruptly he sat up, kneeling on both sides of Dean’s thighs, and opened the fly of his pants with a smooth movement that betrayed his internal uproar. Dean was staring at him with wide eyes, his mouth partly opened, and Castiel was staring right back at him, lost in his husband’s eyes, too mesmerized to look away.
Whether this was another cruel dream, a hallucination, or whatever, Dean didn’t care. His hands grabbed his angel’s jaws and he kissed him, throwing all his love into the kiss, hoping Cas would understand, before he laid his head on his shoulder, gripping the coat tightly, and inhaling his scent, never wanting to let go. Sobs were running through his body but this close to Cas his breathing finally calmed down.
Following his gaze, Dean grinned. “Oh! I totally forgot. That’s the best part.” He ran towards the box, still on bare feet. Sam hadn’t brought them any footwear, though it was probably for the best on the beach, anyway.
“Sorry, kid. You did well, Jack, really. Keeping your distance and practicing on tiny things. That’s the right way. It’s still a hard way. But I’m sure you’ll make it. It’s baby steps, but one day you will know how to control your powers completely. And you can always build a new kite.” Cas’ approving tap on Dean’s hand lifted his heart a bit.
“He won’t stop as long as there is hope. And he still tries to win you over, you know? Show you he’s worth your trust.”
“Straight, huh?” Dean just couldn’t keep a straight face, all puns intended. “Besides, that ain’t true. Those fuckers brainwashed you before.”
Not wanting to lose another precious moment to be lost in explanations of why and how he was here, Castiel touched his friend’s forehead with two fingers, sending him into a deep sleep.
“And then I prayed. I called you. I called your name. Your full name. For the first time since– since–”
Yet, at the same time, as long as the Shadow tortured him, it meant he was still partially awake. Somewhere deep inside him, there was still a tiny spark of hope he couldn’t ignore. Something was still out there. Someone hadn’t given up on him. So he wouldn’t give up either.
“Yes,” Cas answered while chewing on, smacking in delight. Dean couldn’t blame him. “I still can distinguish every single molecule but it seems that I have human taste too.”
“Besides Sammy. There is no either or. It will always be the both of you.” Hoping he had made himself clear, Dean took a deep breath. “So, yeah, I don’t want to mess this up, even though it took us almost ten years to get to this point. At least it was that long for me.” Repeating his earlier moves, Dean absent-mindedly drew little circles on Cas’ shirt-clad chest.
Cas stopped and Dean could see he was struggling how to introduce himself nowadays. “Cas is our personal badass angel warrior, slash best friend, slash brother.” He grinned at his friend who now somehow looked a bit ... sad?
Dean stopped shovelling food in his mouth, looked at her. “Jodes lets me use her garage. She knows what’s best for Baby.”
“They’ll know soon enough. There’s no need to wake them. Normally, I don’t need sleep and, therefore, would be awake when the first of them gets up in the morning. But since I used my power to heal you ...”
Geez, that was some deep shit, but fucking adorable. He felt lightheaded and a swarm of butterflies was stirring in his belly. This was so Cas and one of the many reasons why he had fallen for his fallen warrior angel who had fallen for him. “Love you, too, sunshine. So what? To infinity and beyond?” Dean grinned happily, snuggling deeper into Cas’ embrace.
“It’s okay, Donna. I know Cas isn’t Dad. Just the thought of him getting it on with Dean.” Claire shuddered.
“Are you okay, Dean?” Cas looked at him questioningly, his voice sounding too worried for Dean’s liking.
Looking at his brother, Dean rolled his eyes. “Sam, I’m fine. Now take your flight home and make Eileen happy.”
Cupping Dean’s face, Castiel still feared Dean would run. But, instead of fleeing, his friend closed his eyes and leaned into their connection. Castiel felt a weight lifting from his shoulders. And yet, Dean still hadn’t reacted. “I love you,” Castiel repeated.
Dean’s anger drained from him. “Shit!” His friend took a deep breath. “Who wouldn’t gift you stuff? You deserve everything. You’ve given everything. It’s time to give something back to you. Besides, you stay in the Bunker. Ain’t you?” Dean almost whispered the last words.
“I am,” the boy stated, smiling, talking and signing simultaneously. “Heaven is fully powered now. That was one of the things I had to take care of. With far too few angels around it was still in danger to collapse which would have set all the souls free. But with me and Amara up there, we prevented that. She's back in her own body, by the way. Solving that problem, she helped me find a way to reopen the gates, so all fallen angels can use their wings again.”
After another extended kiss, Castiel’s sight fell on the box that was still lying near the shore where Sam had left it. “What’s that?”
He needed to keep his fucking shit together. Keeping himself from bursting through the door, afraid of startling Sammy, Dean slowly opened it and peeked into the dark room which was empty. Of course it was empty, unless he counted the books.
Jack looked helplessly at each of them, confusion on his face. Could it be that the kid actually didn’t know what he had asked? After all, this was Jack, an innocent toddler in the body of a teenager who had the knowledge of an adult and the power to take over the universe without lifting his pinkie. The kid was able to kill anyone without as much as blinking an eye. But most of all, Jack took everything literally, hell, even worse than Cas when they met.
And suddenly, Dean couldn’t stand it any longer. Taking a step back and brushing off Cas’ hand, Dean looked up and shouted at his angel. “Damn it, Castiel! Of course, I want you to stay. Don’t you get it? I’ll fuck up our friendship because I want you! Hell, I want you! I want you more than anything in the world.”
It was both too much, simply overwhelming, yet still not enough. He wanted more, so much more. All of Dean. Everything the man he loved, who he had loved for years, was willing to give him.
Cas kept on talking. “Or we find someone you trust enough to watch over the two back here. Then we’re free to go on a witch hunt. The decision is up to you. However, we’ll need to act soon.”
“Mary Poppins is a Zanna, too, Dean. Did you know?” Sammy kicked enthusiastically, bouncing on his shoulders.
Dean moved his lips over his teasingly, before he turned his attention back to his feathers in childlike wonder, his hand hovering right in front of them, eager to touch yet holding back, unsure if he was allowed to.
“I take it you want me to continue,” Cas deadpanned, knowing full well what he did to Dean. This big tease.
Castiel watched Dean, a habit he had started so many years ago, though never with the premium view he was offered now. Not after Dean had told him off early in their acquaintance. Softly caressing his friend’s – boyfriend’s, Castiel corrected himself, – back, Dean’s breath grew steadier. Like before, he placed a kiss on the hunter’s head, still having trouble believing that all this was true. When Castiel’s lips touched the crown, he suddenly felt something pulling at his mind, at his angelic being. Even though it could not be, as it had been years since he had used this ability and thought it long lost because off the fall, he closed his eyes and let himself be swiped into Dean’s dream.
The rural landscape was passing by in front of the window. Castiel watched it, but today his mind was occupied with something else. Listening to Dean’s regular breathing while his friend slept on the passenger seat was all he needed. He would prefer to watch his friend during their whole trip, but with Sam driving, he didn’t dare.
Cas’ words had triggered something in him. Somewhere between the dungeon and Chuck’s defeat, his words had settled in, changed something deep inside him. Cas had changed him. Of course he had.
“Look who’s talking.” Dean stared at him, grief flickering in his eyes, while he stretched his index finger and hesitantly brushed with its outside over one of his secondaries.
“What are you waiting for? The next apocalypse?” Jody challenged him. “With Jack running things that’ll be a long wait. At least let’s hope so. Don’t waste any more time. Call him.”
“Quarter past four, though I think you might rather sleep in your own bed than to spend the night in the car.”
“Really, Cas? Ain’t it obvious, Mr. ‘I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition’?” Dean was agitated.
“Dean’s fine.” As if to prove his statement, Dean seemed to mark his territory by sucking his neck. “Uh, he’s fine.”
And surrender he did. No way could he resist his brother when the kid looked at him like that. Not now, not ever. “’Kay, okay. Just lemme get up.”
Sam shrugged. “Yeah, you’re probably right. They just drove me mad for years. Can’t believe that after all these years all it took was me as a preschooler.”
There he was himself, a brainwashed instrument of Naomi’s, killing Dean, following Heaven’s bidding, unquestioning and ruthless. And there was Jack, bringing chaos to Earth because he didn’t know better, because Castiel had failed in his role as a father. And then there he was again, Castiel, as the new God, creating an Earth that was a place without hope, without happiness, without humanity, only ruled by fear and despair.
“Cas?” Dean sounded confused, but Castiel still didn’t react. Everything blurred in front of his eyes.
Cas broke away from their kiss, and when Dean stared at him, the angel grinned, happiness evident on his face.
Reaching the car, he pushed Dean with his back against the front door, crowding him. His hands were on Dean’s face, in his hair. Their mouths found each other and this time, nothing stopped them.
Castiel still couldn’t believe this was happening. Dean had asked him to stay forever, to marry him. He didn’t want to lose another moment. “Let’s do it now.”
“That’s exactly what you did, Dean.” It wasn’t fair that Cas was even hotter when he was angry with him.
Dean was also surprisingly tactile, often bumping into or nudging Castiel. A few times, he’d even but his hand on Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel hadn’t experienced this easy physical contact and affection before. Although he enjoyed it, Castiel knew it was unusual for two people who had just met to walk this close together, to be this easily affectionate. Fine, Castiel knew that, but Dean didn’t seem to mind the lack of personal space, so he stayed as close as he could.
“Yes” was all he said, not moving his eyes from the beautiful erect sign of Dean’s arousal. With his now free and clean hands, Castiel started reaching for it. Dean stopped him on his way by holding his wrists and pinning them next to his body.
“And no, I can get it up whenever I want it to, thank you very much! She wanted me to be her trophy boyfriend. To just shut up and be pretty.”
Dean then inched even closer, put his arms around Castiel’s waists, and slid his hands up to the back of his shoulders. They stayed like this for a few seconds, Dean looking into his eyes, practically hugging him, with his hands not moving from the back of his shoulders.
They went and grabbed food from the table and sat next to Ash and Jo. A few minutes later, Meg showed up.
“I just want you to know that he was invited. I don’t know why he’s not here, but maybe he’ll come later. I’ll be on the lookout for you. If I see him, I’ll let you know. Try to have some fun though, okay?” With that, she got up and walked to some other guests.
Was he flirting with him? Castiel couldn't tell, he had no experience with that kind of thing. He didn’t know how to react, so he mumbled “Thanks” and took a bite out of his own food. After a few moments of silently eating their lunch, it occurred to him that he was very rude to Balthazar.
Castiel remembered that day. He saw Sam making tomato and rice soup alone in the kitchen. Tomato and rice soup was what Mary used to make for Dean when he was sick, and what Dean made for Sam when he was sick since Mary had died. When Castiel thought about it, he didn't see Dean the whole day. He put two and two together and came to the conclusion that Dean must have fallen ill.
They lay there in comfortable silence, Castiel still floating in his afterglow. Dean was the first to break the silence.
Castiel took off his clothes as fast as he could, not wanting to lose his courage and back out. All the while Dean kept his back towards him and looked at the shower wall. Naked, he walked in behind Dean, who moved a little closer to the wall, and closed the curtain. The shower wasn’t big but was big enough for the two of them to stand comfortably without needing to touch each other.
He didn’t know if Dean heard him get in, or just sensed his presence, but without turning around or looking at his direction he said:
Jo ran to Ash as soon as he got out of the bus, not caring that his parents were there as well. Dean, on the other hand, went next to the bus’s trunk and waited. When Castiel came to collect his luggage, Dean was there to hand it to him. Castiel smiled and was about to say thank you when Meg came by and Dean went off to find her luggage as well.
Meg, with her black hair, black clothes, and black makeup, looked unnerving and blunt. And that was exactly who she was. It was refreshing for Castiel to meet a girl that didn’t give a fuck about being nice or polite. Castiel could definitely see why Jo liked her so much.
“So, come sleep in my place. It’s closer to here and my bedroom is clean—sort of,” Dean grinned. “And the best part is that it’s nail-free.”
Today was the day. He had to do this. He was practicing his abilities for a while now. He knew he could fly. He knew that no one in this place could see him. He was here merely to watch, not to be watched. He knew he couldn’t go through walls, but he learned he could go through nets, like screen doors. He studied this place, this building in the middle of nowhere. So he thought. He never managed to see the outside. The ventilation came from somewhere down below. He decided that going down is the way out.
Dean didn’t understand why Novak took his fingers away until he heard the familiar sound of a condom packet being opened. The realization of what was going to happen hit him at the same time he heard Novak's question about wanting his cock. He was so on edge that he didn’t care anymore. Novak was asking permission, in a very degrading and humiliating way, and was waiting for him to answer.
But what does it mean for Dean to love him? Love can be many things. Suddenly, all the previous contemplation and worries came back with vengeance.
At the exact time the meeting was set, Ms. Mills, the head of the delegation, entered the room. As she was about to close the door behind her, Balthazar pushed it open and slipped in.
Castiel expected Dean to blindly hand him the soap, the same way he did with the shower head. He was not ready for Dean to spin around and face him. He was not ready for Dean’s eyes to lock with him with a glint of mirth and challenge, but also with a question akin to ‘Is this alright?’ while his soapy hands hover inches from his chest.
Castiel cradled Dean’s face in his palm. “Dean, I’m fine. Taking it slow was your idea, remember? I’m happy to engage in showering with you whenever you deem appropriate.”
Castiel was still trying to process the information himself. This was real. Dean loved him. Dean had saved him. Dean. Closing his eyes, he let the feeling of their closeness engulf him.
Dean was out in a moment and Castiel’s heart sank. The hunter had probably spent more hours sleeping or knocked out over the last two days than he usually allowed himself over the span of a week or even more. The sleep was necessary for his recovery and yet seeing Dean this vulnerable and hurt only kindled Castiel’s fears and self-doubts. What if it had all been just a fluke and an illusion? Would Dean still want him when he woke up, when he eventually recovered? Yes, Dean had still flirted with him right now after the incident with Sam. Their evolving relationship still seemed natural and true. What Castiel had learned over the last years he had spent with the Winchesters, though, was that moments of happiness were fleeting.
He let his palm touch Dean’s cheek and stroked the tender skin with his thumb, relishing the touch of finger tips against the firm jaw line. Dean’s eyes were back on him. All this shouldn’t have taken more than seconds but even for him it felt like an eternity.
Dean tried to evade the enquiring eyes anyway, knowing that, if he didn’t, he would break, again, and spill, being already too emotionally shaken to contain the truth any longer, the truth he had managed to bury deep down for so many years. Eventually he failed and met the ever staring glance of the deep blue eyes. “How long do you have?”
Yet the best thing was Cas. The smile on his face was bigger than Dean had thought possible, tears of happiness flowing down his face. Cas’ eyes were gleaming, enhanced by his grace that shimmered through. It was a constant reminder of his true form. There he was, an Angel of the Lord, standing right in front of him and marrying him, Dean Winchester, of his own free will.
“What are you afraid of, Dean?” Stepping closer, Cas didn’t let him off the hook, touching his chin and guiding his face towards him until they were once again looking at each other.
“It’s okay, angel. It’s okay.” Dean’s movements became gentler, and he pressed a kiss on his temple. “We can take it slow.” His voice was rough, and he was still breathing heavily, while sweat was covering his forehead and chest. Every time they moved, Castiel could feel Dean’s erection pressing against his own, still hidden behind layers of cloth, leaving beads of pre-ejaculate that smeared over the bare skin above Castiel’s waistband.
“Think of that, dude,” Dean finally chimed in, enthusiastically, “you see Eileen a lot sooner that way. Hasn’t she returned from her hunt while we were gone? You two could spend some really nice hours alone in the bunker.” He wiggled his eyebrows, shooting finger guns towards his brother. “Just keep it in your room. No defiling anything, especially not the War Room table.” Sam glared at his brother. “Don’t deny you never considered it.”
“I still don’t see why I shouldn’t return to Garden City on my own and try to hunt down the witch. At least, let me attempt to get on her trail. Otherwise, we might lose her. We already lost far too much time since our encounter yesterday.”
“March 14th. 3.14. Pi,” Dean shrugged. “It’s something I saw on the internet. It’s stupid. But it reminded me of you. And me. You and me. Us. It reminded me of us,” he rambled on, lowering his eyes and scratching the back of his head nervously.
They both immediately stopped in their tracks and sat upright, starring at Jack who was standing at the end of the bed, smiling, his hand raised in his usual manner of greeting.
There's a jump to the scene in the cabin in "Dark Side of the Moon" and another jump to the Winchester's drive back home after they met Sully in "Just My Imagination" where Sam tells Dean he wanted to run away with Sully.
Castiel wanted to touch him, reassure him that he was okay. But there was a fine line he didn’t want to cross. Not intentionally. So he just smiled and squinted. “It’s a pi pie.”
“Dean, the word you’re looking for is ‘come’,” Sam shouted after them. His damn brother was lucky that Dean had other things in mind right now.
The moment it happened, they both shared a gasp that encompassed over a decade of unresolved tension and accumulated lust between them. It was almost too much to bear. Castiel had to close his eyes for a short moment, just to look up and meet Dean’s, who was staring at him, his mouth opened slightly.
Holy shit! If the eyes didn’t kill him, this voice would be his downfall. Now he could die happy. Aware that his brother and Eileen were still around, witnessing the whole scene, he needed to keep this thing under control, especially since he still didn’t know where Cas stood in regard to everything. Almost everything. Although the little shifts of his body were promising, very promising.
Straightening up, Dean searched Castiel’s eyes, trying to understand. “I still don’t know what that means for ...
“Do I have to remind you that I’m not a woman?” Castiel replied. Even saying it hurt. It always hurt, knowing Dean would never be his.
“Fine,” Cas grumbled, “That might be part of it, but ultimately this is about you finding a sense of community. Sometimes you need others to lean on while you figure yourself out,” he paused for a moment, planning his next words carefully,  “I hope this isn’t too forward because I know we just met, but I’d like to be part of that support system if you’d let me.”
“We manage,” Dean bit his lip, looking anywhere but at the other boy in an attempt to get his beating heart under control.
“Alright, well you get them set up, and I’ll handle sleeping beauty over there. Just be careful not to wake him when you go back to your room,” Gabriel said as he glanced at Jack who was now dozing on the sofa.
Upon their arrival, there was a long line of students outside the door, waiting to turn in their tickets for entry. The three of them joined and were pleasantly surprised when the person at the table sped through the crowd in nothing flat.
“Bring him too. Charlie won’t mind. In fact, maybe we can form a little group with some of the club members. That could be fun.”
“It doesn’t matter anyway. You are you regardless of how you are perceived,” he said comfortingly. “However,” he grinned a little, “Tonight, you do seem pretty queer.”
When parade day arrived, Cas’s heart was practically in his throat. He had managed to keep it together all week for the sake of the team, but now all he could think about was Dean, and he was on the verge of panic. In addition to his rapid pulse, his stomach cramped, he was sweating profusely, and his thoughts were swirling like a tornado in his head. This anxiety ridden mess is ultimately what stumbled into fifth period, and just as Cas feared, it was the first thing his friend noticed about him. Dean opened his mouth to say something, but Cas quickly shoved himself into his desk, facing forward to avoid his friend’s gaze. Such a move was foolish in retrospect because it only made Dean more concerned. Cas cursed under his breath when he felt fingers tapping on his shoulder. He reluctantly turned.
“Do you remember how I said I’m a very specific type, but I never went into detail about what that meant?”
As Claire emerged, all heads turned towards her. It was rare that Claire wore anything other than a T-shirt and her signature leather jacket, so her being dressed up was certainly a sight to behold. That said, she looked pretty damn good. Huge smiles spread across everyone’s faces upon seeing how surprisingly comfortable and confident she appeared. Kaia, especially, was very impressed with her girlfriend’s selection. Dean watched, fondly, as she kissed Claire’s cheek and whispered something in her ear that made her blush. He’d never admit it, but he admired those two and their relationship. Maybe one day he would have something like that too.
He held the piece in front of him for a moment, admiring his handiwork. This was a project he began early the day before when Sam dragged his ass to school to ask the pottery teacher if they could use some of the paints. Now, Dean didn’t have time to actually learn how to make pottery, but Sam had been working on a pot as sort of a side project because he was an overachiever and always got his main assignments done before anyone else. This pot had already gone through the kiln, but Sam hadn’t painted it yet. He didn’t have any specific plans for it either, so when Dean asked for his help, he offered it to him. As soon as he saw the pot, Dean knew what he wanted to do. It was a two day affair as he had to do a base coat of white paint over the pot before he could begin the design. The decoration was fairly clever, Dean thought. Towards the top, he painted the outline of something dripping down the side and then proceeded to fill it in with the colors of the rainbow pride flag. This wrapped all the way around the pot. As for the main event, the front had Cas’s name and a heart that was filled with the colors of the Ace flag. The backside had the word “honey” on it, but it was intentionally misspelled in accordance to the storybook from which it was inspired.
“You can’t tell Dean, but yes,” Cas carefully opened the box to reveal a silver ring with a sparkling blue crystal in the middle and some unusual symbols along the band.
On his way out, Dean could’ve sworn he caught Sam winking at him as if to say “good luck.” Butterflies settled in his stomach.
Biting his lip, he thought about Cas and how much he wanted this to work out so that he could become closer to him. Whether or not it would evolve into anything romantic, he wanted to know everything there was to know about that kid. Something about him was just so damn intriguing, and Dean couldn’t get enough from the few minutes of socializing they had available before fifth period (technically they could talk at lunch, but Dean could never find him in the mass of people). Also, on some level, he sensed that Castiel might need a friend too. The guy spent all his time trying to make his brothers proud and taking care of his peers that he rarely had the opportunity to relax and vent his problems to someone that cared. Earlier in the week, he had said something about how people sometimes needed a shoulder to lean on, so why not lean on each other? That thought kept him going until the end of the day.
Dean sighed. Every source he found said that the specifics could vary from relationship to relationship which meant that essentially he had to be prepared for any outcome. He wanted to be supportive, so the best thing he could do was open up the conversation. Cas didn’t have to answer everything at once- maybe they could even just take things as they come- but Dean wanted to show him that he was serious about respecting boundaries. There was one small problem though, and that was his own libido. He was pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes his body acted on its own. Of course, he had ways of handling it when alone, but he didn’t want Cas to feel grossed out or insulted in any way if he accidentally popped a boner or something when they were together and had to deal with it. Even more horrifying, what if it happened, and Cas felt bad? The guy already was struggling with guilt for the situation, so seeing a physical reaction from Dean may make it worse. Fuck, how would he navigate that?
Cas figured what the hell? He still wasn’t sure what was going on, but they were together, the setting was lovely, and the pie did look delicious. Grabbing his fork, he scooped up a small section and brought it up to his lips. It nearly melted in his mouth.
There was silence for what felt like an eternity. A bead of sweat formed on Dean’s brow, and his body started shaking from anticipation.
“I do trust him. I never said I didn’t. It’s just that this is all unfamiliar to me, and I don’t know how to approach it. I figured the safest bet was to revert to the classic boundaries set by parents. Not that I’m his father because I know I’m not, but I am responsible for him.”
Castiel laughed a little: “I mean, kind of. It’s not exclusive. Pride Alliance is a student organization that celebrates people of all sexualities and gender identities.”
“Elijah was a friend of mine from right after I came out. We were really close because we used to walk home together every Sunday after youth group and then hang out at my house. He was queer too, but he was deeply closeted which made things awkward with Gabriel, as you can imagine.”
Cas wasn’t on the floor. Instead, he was in bed with Dean. They were sleeping soundly which is exactly what Gabriel assured him they’d be doing. A small smile tugged at his lips. He shut the door.
“Yeah, I could use some fresh air, and it beats sitting with Sammy and his debate friends. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad he’s found his group or whatever, but it’s kinda weird hanging out with a bunch of freshman all the time. I never know what to talk about, so I usually end up telling jokes about Sam from when we were growing up. He never says anything, but after a few weeks of it, I’m sure it irks him. I figure he will appreciate the time away from me and my embarrassing stories.”
Summary: Dean struggles with his feelings after sharing an intimate moment with Cas a few days prior. The Pride Alliance gang goes to the mall.
“Me? You’re the one who’s on thin ice here. After last night, you’ve got some balls bringing him here,” John stepped forward a little.
“Ok,” Dean wasn’t really convinced, but perhaps on one condition he’d be alright with it. “But if anyone is sleeping on the floor, it should be me. This is my fault anyway.”
“I have to get to class. I love you,” and with that, he walked away, leaving Dean alone with the realization that Cas did this because of him.
As they entered the restaurant, Cas felt his heart rapidly beating in his chest. He had managed to keep himself relatively calm for most of the day, but then he had felt himself losing his grip in the car from replaying his speech too many times in his head. Dean had snapped him out of that mini panic (thankfully he didn’t pry too much), but the reality of the evening was truly sinking in now, and the anxiety was creeping back. He wasn’t sure if he would have the guts in the end to pull off this proposal. He glanced over at his partner. He looked so handsome, so put together. The way his hair was slicked back and the way the candles in the room reflected off his eyes was overwhelmingly beautiful. Not to mention, just standing there, Cas could feel the warmth and purity of the other man’s soul surrounding him. The love, the devotion, it was like nothing else Cas had ever experienced. He felt honored to even be in this man’s presence, and the idea of actually forming a life with him forever and always...gosh, the angel had never wanted anything else more than this. He couldn’t afford to screw it up. He had to keep it together.
Taking one last look at Dean, he smiled again before leaving the room. Dean glanced back at Jack who appeared almost proud of himself. He raised an eyebrow, curiously.
“I wouldn’t be against it. He’s a good guy. Awkward, but sweet. And I guess I can see how he might be attractive.”
In the end, nobody could choose a winner. Both performances had their own special aspects, and both were fun to watch. Of course, Crowley argued about it, but in the end, he conceded and shared the glory. After the competition, everyone just swayed casually and talked. By this point, more people had arrived, and it was becoming more difficult to move around without accidentally bumping into somebody, so it was best to keep things simple. Suddenly, Cas tapped Dean on the shoulder and told him that he needed to use the restroom-too much soda at the restaurant. Dean wanted to go too so he wouldn’t just be standing there by himself, but that would probably be insinuating things. Plus, he didn’t want to be the clingy guy who couldn’t be apart from his boyfriend for five minutes. So, he nodded and proceeded to make conversation with Kaia while Cas slipped out of the gym.
“It’s suppressed, not gone. You made me so happy, I guess...I don’t know. Energy boost?” Cas muttered.
“It’s an acquired taste, I guess. Then again, this is the cheap stuff. You’ll have to try some of the higher end liquor dad keeps for special occasions.”
The other boy nodded. He fished out his keys from his backpack and motioned for Dean to follow him to the front porch. Before Cas could finish unlocking the door, it swung open, causing him to stumble. To his relief, Dean caught him by the tail of his shirt before he could face plant into his brother’s crotch. There was a chuckle from the man as Cas cursed under his breath.
Dean was taken aback by the power of Sam’s words. He had been so preoccupied with his own problems that he neglected his brother’s. Sammy had his own bones to pick, and Dean was proud of him for speaking up, but now he felt bad for silencing him earlier. However, that was something the two of them could discuss another time. Right then, Dean let Sam have the floor.
Feeling a bit adventurous, Dean made a motion for Gabe to pay attention before laying one on Cas’s cheek. Gabriel raised an eyebrow and looked to Cas for confirmation of his suspicions. Cas shrugged and laughed as his brother started clapping and cheering. Dean laughed too. This truly was one of the best days of his life. The only thing left to do was to tell his dad...
“He pulled me aside earlier because he wanted to talk about something that happened on Saturday back at the house.”
“Right this way,” the woman led him to a line of display cases at the back of the room. “We have quite a few designs available right now, but we can also order from the catalogue if you don’t see anything you like.”
I'm sorry it took so long to update. I meant to get this chapter out a few days ago, but some stuff came up, and I didn't get around to it.
“I guess that’s not so unreasonable,” Sam began, “but was it something specific he’s worried about?”
“When we moved here, I told myself I was going to make a new start,” Dean continued, “I wanted to open up more, make new friends, and try new things. I wanted to explore and indulge the persona I had been suppressing. For the past two months, I’ve been doing that.”
“Technically it’s not over until nine, but the energy is going down in there. Jo and I were actually thinking of taking off ourselves, and so were Claire and Kaia. Although, that might just be so they can go home and make out.”
Before Sam could retort, there was a knock. They all turned to see Gabriel in the doorway, only half awake and looking like a zombie with his crows nest of hair and his pale complexion. He yawned and scratched his head.
“Fine, I guess,” Dean yawned, “Classes seem manageable so far...at least on paper. All they did today was go over the schedule of assignments for the semester. Kinda dull.”
“Don’t chicken out on me. I’ve been waiting for you two dumbasses to tie the knot for years,” Sam grinned, cheekily.
“And that’s great. I’m happy for you guys. Believe me, I’m thrilled, but why didn’t you just tell me that’s what you were doing?”
Cas didn’t say anything. Instead, he knelt down next to Dean and hugged him, tightly. They stayed like that for awhile before Dean finally spoke.
Dean had to keep himself from saying “fiancé” no matter how much he wanted to. That would be getting ahead of himself. The thought was nice though. Fuck, it was exhilarating.
“So not only are you gay, but you’ve been lying about where you’ve been every Friday afternoon. Great…”
“You haven’t really cooked in years,” Dean said as he reached for the rolling pin. “Not since mom anyway…” his voice trailed off.
“I’d like that!” the boy had finally freed himself from Miracle who was now sitting at his feet. “Afterwards, do you wanna join me and Cas for a movie?”
“My thoughts exactly,” Sam replied. “Plus, those skills won’t be in isolation because a big part of debate is working with ideas that may be different than my own. My ability to listen and adjust my own arguments to accommodate for new information or for a varying perspective is critical to reaching the most logical answer which ultimately would win the debate.”
John starts off unusually friendly because it’s a rare occasion where he isn’t drunk, but he turns into a real dick later on. Just writing it made me want to punch him. But Dean stands up for himself which is what matters.
Cas’s smile grew larger at the second use of the word “Dad” in only a few hours. He could get used to it.
“Sam, I don’t understand why we’re doing this,” Dean slumped in his chair with his arms crossed. “I don’t even think Cas can dance.”
“I mean, if you need someone, I don’t think I have anything going on that afternoon. I know it’s a few weeks out, but most Fridays me and Sammy just spend watching tv anyway while our dad is off god knows where.”
“No,” he paused, “I do have very warm, non-platonic feelings about you, but I’ve been trying to suppress them. However, they come out now and again unintentionally which can make things difficult. The other night being a prime example.”
“Oh, right. I forgot about that table and paddles he bought at that garage sale a few months back. He hasn’t had anyone to play with, so I’m sure he will like that. He’ll be back here soon. He went to the dog park with Miracle, and then he was going to swing by the pet store on the way back to pick up some more kibble. And Sam went over to Eileen's. I wouldn’t expect him back until dinner.”
Dean grabbed Cas’s hands and set them on his shoulders while resting his own hands on Cas’s waist. Cas flinched a little at the contact, and Dean quickly pulled his hands away.
“I guess you’re right. Maybe we should start. We could have an every other week deal. That way you can have some weeks where it won’t interfere with your social schedules.”
The boy was already gone. When he returned, the saleswoman was at his side. By then, Cas was out of his dressing room in his normal attire. The woman gave him a once over, and then turned to Jack to indicate that he was right coming to her for help. He grinned.
“I know, but like I said, I need to face reality at some point. Might as well do it now before he finds out on his own and resents me for lying to him.”
“You’re sweet, thank you,” he said. “I promise it won’t be long. Meetings rarely last more than an hour, and then we can do whatever you want.”
(Sam: "Ok, now I want you to let go of my waist. I’ll let go of your shoulder. Keep holding my other hand. Now, stretch that free arm out to the side. I’ll do it too but opposite of you. So essentially, you’ll be standing side by side with hands clasped on the inside and one arm out. You can make it a bit fancy by sort of swishing your arm in the movement. Now, you’re going to want to do this part fairly quickly because you need to swing back in and grab his other hand. Pull him close to you, foreheads touching.")
“Bottom line, I don’t feel comfortable with sex,” Cas continued, “I don’t even have those types of feelings about people. When I like someone, I like them for their heart, not their body.”
As they approached the school, Dean’s belief dwindled. Unlike many of the previous institutions he and Sam had been enrolled in, this one was much nicer and the crowd on campus appeared to be composed of mostly rich, preppy kids. Immediately, he felt out of place. Sammy, however, perked up a little. He seemed to be intrigued by the student organizations that had tables set up outside.
When the final bell rang, Dean slammed his gym locker shut, and quickly typed a message to Sammy to wait for him by the cafeteria before their respective meetings. He didn’t have anything particularly important to say to him that would require this, but a part of Dean just wanted to see his brother one more time before engaging in what could possibly be a life-changing interaction. Well, maybe he shouldn’t play it up that much...it was going to be something new for him, he’d leave it at that. At least seeing Sammy would help calm his anxiety a bit...or maybe it’d make it worse. Dean supposed he would find out when he got there.
“Hm?” Castiel rolled over and wrapped his arms around his partner’s torso, pulling him in so that he could take in his scent. “Morning.”
“I care about Dean, I really do, and I want to be in a relationship, but I’ll just be a burden for him.”
“Disapp– Cas, you’re kidding.” Dean glared at him, searching Castiel’s face for answers, and caressed his cheek with gentle fingers.” You are kidding, right?”
“Yep. Jack’s special,” Dean confirmed. “That’s why we need someone special to keep these two company when Cas and I are gone.”
When the portal opened in front of him, like the one to apocalypse world years before, he looked back at his found family.
Moreover, I'm working on my story for a bang and I would like to concentrate on finishing and editing that fic.
“It worked, Cas. We won. Jack defeated Chuck.” Even though Cas didn’t answer, talking helped him to stay sane. Hell, he didn’t even know if he had stopped praying since Cas had been taken from him.
Castiel had spent the night in the library, researching everything he could find on human adults transformed into children. There had been several short accounts over the last centuries – no more than one or two sentences at most, mainly mere subordinate clauses or a throwaway line – though none of them had broached the issue of reversing the spell. One of the reports merely mentioned a successful age transformation of rodents. When he had just closed the last tome of many with useless information regarding their current situation, and had settled in the kitchen, he was surprised seeing both Winchesters emerging at such an early hour. Sam was towing a reluctantly shuffling Dean behind him.
For once, Castiel forewent their usual disposal of the body. There were other priorities. Picking Sam up, the pair made their way through the school. Sam seemed to be fascinated by Castiel’s coat lapels and his tie, constantly fidgeting with one or the other. Sam laughed when pulling on the tie strangled Castiel but it was nothing Castiel couldn’t endure. He assumed it more like a fly buzzing around a human. The happy sound coming from Sam made more than up for it.
They had baked pie together once before, a few weeks ago. The following night, Castiel had used exactly this wordplay in a conversation with Dean. Both events had finally lifted the strain that still had been clouding their newly mended relationship ever since their latest trip to Purgatory, even though his treacherous hope had sparked after Dean’s prayer. He had had to stop Dean before he might have said too much. As much as he wanted, going there was far too dangerous. Not with the universe at stake.
Later, a long time later, they were lying in the grass and sharing a piece of pie. Or rather, Dean ate the pie and Castiel watched, delighted.
When Dean finally looked up, Castiel lowered his hand, losing their connection but hoping his friend would stay and listen. He needed to make sure his next words were not only heard but understood. It might be his only chance to explain himself.
“Have for a long time,” Castiel admitted, repeating Dean’s earlier words. He felt elated and couldn’t help the grin that split his face.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “Dean, I’ve hunted on my own before.” His friend’s illogical attitude was irritating.
Suddenly, a four-year-old crashed into them, jumping between them into his brother’s lap, and hugged both of them as tightly as his short arms allowed it.
Castiel observed his friend’s underlying vulnerability simmering through his usual bold demeanour. He was always bemused that Dean couldn’t see what a great influence he had had on Sam becoming the man he was today. That meant usually, when he wasn’t transformed into his younger self.
“Those two idiots need all the help they can get,” Sam said, shaking his head in disbelief over his brother and Cas, but couldn’t help the smile that crept across his face.
Taking a step back, Dean took the phone and turned it to speaker. “Have we ever? Besides there’s no need if it’s true.” Though he couldn’t believe what he was hearing, Castiel frowned, instantly missing the warmth pressed against his body, and closed the gap, inviting Dean back into his embrace. His friend accepted happily. Leaving a chaste kiss on his cheek, Dean snuggled into him, clearly enjoying Castiel placing his hand on his back.
Ignoring the moose, he tugged at Cas’ hand who immediately was closing in on him. Placing a chaste kiss on his boyfriend’s cheek – damn, this term nearly gave him a heart attack – earned him another sigh from his brother. It was so worth it.
“Shit! Sorry Sammy.” Dean chided himself. He tried. After– after Cas words, he really tried to do better. Taking a step towards his brother, he opened his arms. “Come here.”
Despite the gigantic hole in his heart, it had helped. What they had done mattered for their friends. Their wellbeing had been worth fighting for. There were still people around who cared for him, for whatever they saw in him. Maybe, just maybe, Cas had been right. Those were people, family, he couldn’t let down. If not for himself, he would at least try to keep living on for them.
Another thrust, and with a startling crack, his wings materialised on this plane again, crowding the space that was already too small for two large human shaped bodies. Defeated, Castiel let his head fall on Dean’s chest and groaned.
“Sully?” Dean stared at Cas. “You want me to ask Sully to babysit Sammy and Jack? Sam’s invisible non-imaginary good weird Mork from Ork friend? Dude, that’s ...” Frightening was probably the right word for it. This idea was completely out of question. No way! No fucking way would he trust that Zanna, but to his horror Dean heard himself saying, “... both genius, and absolutely terrifyingly crazy.” Dean wanted to kick himself for his mouth’s betrayal. Seriously? This was so not right on too many freaking levels. But Cas nearly beamed. That sold Dean because he liked his angel happy. If the idea of inviting the Zanna brought a gummy smile to Cas’ face, Dean simply had to relent.
For a fraction of a moment, Missouri vanished and a pair of blue piercing eyes always capable of starring right through his shit replaced her. “Cas,” Dean mumbled half awake. Sighing, he turned around and slowly drifted back into his dream.
“I’m aware of that, Dean,” Cas deadpanned, only increasing the stare before he turned it once again at his burger. Finally, he took a bite. Immediately, his eyes widened. “Oh! I like that!” Taking another bite, a gummy grin split his face. “I like that very much! This makes me very happy.” Some of the burger sauce was running down the corner of his mouth and Dean used the chance to kiss it away. “This, too, makes me very happy.”
“Seriously, Cas? Didn’t Metadouche cover that with his update? How much TV did you binge and you still don’t know
How could Dean have been so unconcerned, so credulous? He knew he probably shouldn’t worry, but then again his life had taught him differently. Over and over, and over again.
“Don’t be too confident and be careful! You witnessed firsthand what she did to us.” Dean obviously had found his words again.
They all turned at once, staring at the intruder. Castiel's heart leaped. Whatever Dean’s intentions when he ordered Jack to Earth, it had worked.
Finally allowing himself to close his eyes and to give in to his body’s primary demands, Dean was asleep sooner than Castiel could cover him with his wing.
“Uh, a witch turned Sammy into Shirley Temple. ... What? No, not a girl, just his preschool self. Cas let her escape. Brought Sammy back here instead.” Dean covered his eyes with his right hand, a silent sigh visible in his appearance. “He’s fine.
For a fleeting moment, Castiel marvelled at his ability to read his friend. But then Dean turned and spotted him, and Castiel was distracted by the smile on the hunter’s face.
Castiel was tempted to roll his eyes towards all the sass thrown at him, but Dean was in no state for that.
Dean tried to remember the previous conversation that led to this moment. They had talked about Adam and Michael, about angels, and about their vessels. Well, at some point Dean must have turned off the chatter, too engrossed in the food in front of him: a hearty steak, some bacon, lots of fries, and enough vegetables for his liking in the form of ketchup, and well, roasted corn on the cob. It had been a peace offering to his brother due to the lack of anything else that remotely resembled rabbit food.
“Not to help with the spell,” Dean mumbled through his breakfast. “Thought we’ll need someone to keep an eye on Sammy. Can’t take him on a hunt.”
“Yep! For whom else would I make such a thing? You think Sam would appreciate it?” Dean stopped and frowned. “Nope, scratch that. The nerd probably would. Look at all the rabbit food he’s gobbling down. But, that ain’t the point.”
Cas was gone. And he was utterly alone. He’d loved him. Cas had loved him. The asshole had loved him and now he was gone and everything he had ever wanted had vanished with him.
Yet, he didn’t want to leave him here with someone to look after him, either. He just couldn’t do it. It was something Dad had done to them all the time. He would drop them anywhere and leave them for good and might not return for a few days, a week or a month.
“You don’t believe me.” The witch actually sounded disappointed. “Of course, you don’t believe me. You’re a hunter and I’m a witch.”
There was no way to hope for Rowena since her fiery run-in with Lucifer, so for now, at least one of them would be stuck in the bunker. Maybe one of them could go on the hunt while the other stayed back to babysit his brother and look out for Jack.
Dean just stared and suddenly burst into roaring laughter. Tears were running down his face. His hands had found the plumage at the wing joints on his back, petting feathers and skin alike.
There was the whooshing sound of wings and, all of a sudden, Cas was standing directly behind Dean. Only a few inches were keeping them apart. “Hello, Dean,” he greeted his friend, only to correct him immediately, “You are mistaken. My ass is not feathered.”
Sure. That certainly wasn’t a word he would use to describe their lives. Nothing for them had ever been easy.
Her smile lingered a bit longer before his eyes when he woke. “I’ll do that. I’ll promise I’ll use my words,” Dean muttered in his waking state, knowing deep down exactly whom he finally needed to talk to.
–: Cas, Jody, Crowley, Rowena, Lee, Charlie, Benny, Cas, Charlie and Gilda, Alex, Claire, Garth and Beth, Mom, Donna, Meg, Ceasar and Jesse, Pamela, Charlie and Dorothy, Ellen, Jo, Patience, Missouri, Cas, always Cas.
“Hey, nothing’s happening,” Dean chimed in. “Even if ‒ big if ‒ I talk to him, nothing will change.”
Trying to keep the rising panic at bay didn’t work. There was nowhere he could run. Cas was in his bed, his arms around him, their legs tangled. Actually, despite his mind screaming at him to flee, he didn’t want to.
Suddenly, the witch’s expression changed, hate in her eyes while a crazy grin spread across her face. “I should have known. People who are close acquaintances of Rowena’s always reek of trouble.”
Cas’ hand rested on Dean’s back. It was a soothing presence and even though he would never admit it, he would miss the touch instantly. Dean had been too distracted by Jack’s words constantly replaying in his mind to even notice Cas’ hand before. Shaking his head to clear his still too vivid imagination, Dean forced himself to focus on other things.
“Awesome. Hell, the girl’s really great at what she’s doing but this witch messed with Sam and Cas. Sam
Finally, he looked up. Sam, on the other side of the table, wheezed. Tears ran down his face, new laughter erupting constantly.
The dinner and party went on until late in the night but at some point in the early morning, Cas took his hand and led him away from the others. They walked along the beach and settled down on a patch of moss and grass on the other side of the small island. It was still dark, and the stars above them were shining brightly. Dean was sitting next to Cas, his head resting on the angel’s shoulder.
“Are you certain it is a witch, Sam?” Castiel asked, wanting to make sure that they wouldn’t be surprised. For Dean’s sake he needed to keep Sam safe. If anything happened to the younger Winchester, Dean would never forgive him. Not this time. His friend already had forgiven him far too much, far more than he deserved and certainly far too many decisions and actions he would never forgive himself.
Shaking his head, he tried to process what he’d just read, at least those parts of the mail he could decipher. Geez, what did half the words mean? He was sure it was some kind of English, but it sounded gibberish. It reminded him of the times he and Sam had dived into the vast spaces of the
“Is– is it a problem? Is my body a problem for you?” Castiel had often wondered about it, had always dreaded the answer. In the end, the fear had vanquished all hope.
“What else would this conversation be about, Dean?” Cas frowned and tilted his head, but Dean could have sworn there was a twinkle in the angel’s eye that gave him away. The fucker knew exactly what he was doing.
“Uh ... Yeah. Guess so. Dude, he accidentally killed a man. We don’t know what else he’ll do when he’s actually threatened.”
Their usual visit at the police station and the coroner’s office didn’t help Agents Swift and Plant in their investigation. They were still as clueless as before, although they had gathered a bit more intel on the victims. After they had been found, most of the kids were now staying at the same place: a local children’s home.
When Castiel finally arrived at the scene, he just caught a look of Sam hugging his brother’s legs before the older Winchester picked him up.
Suddenly, a vuvuzela sounded. The entity screeched, turning once again into a black puddle, letting go of Cas.
Behind the trees was a meadow. Even better, there was no one in sight. “This will do,” Dean grumbled and took the cake from Castiel, setting it down on the grass. He let himself fall beside it and pulled Castiel down.
Reaching the gate, their escape finally in his grasp, he didn’t see it coming. The harpoon pierced through his body and suddenly, they were falling. Falling back into the deepest pits of Hell, their fate sealed, the righteous man forever lost.
“You’re hurting. Do you know your devastation woke me up? You broadcasted your feelings through the bunker. So don’t tell me you’re fine. We’ll find them, I promise.” Cas took a step towards him, barely keeping an acceptable personal space between them, even less than usually.
Dean had blushed adoringly and hadn’t complained any longer. Castiel even would have sworn that his friend had nudged the fries towards him afterwards, watching him in reverse when he stole some more.
Jack had left them after bringing everyone back. He was eager to put the universe back in order and sort out Chuck’s mess with the help of Amara who was back in her own body. Thankfully. Before he had disappeared, though, Jack had promised to visit. He still felt uneasy to leave two pre-schoolers at the helm of the universe. Hell, Jack was a three year old and Amara might be an ancient being, though technically, she had grown up in this world only a few years ago. And yet, they were the best and only shot they had. Then again, Jack and Amara at least weren’t Chuck. That alone was hell of an improvement. For once, he needed to trust Jack. Trust Cas. It was all they got. With Rowena running Hell, Heaven needed some redirection itself. And Earth? There were still monsters loose. Nothing had changed. Not yet, though Jack was thinking about it.
“I don’t know for sure. My best guess is he found someone with a strong enough bond to summon them.” Jack shrugged.
Cas looked down at Sammy and back at him. “Dean, I am not qualified to deal with human needs. They irritate me. I never got used to urinating.”
While he was still held by Cas, he heard a bark coming from the venue. Looking up and turning towards it, Miracle was running at them, jumping up their legs as soon as he reached them. “Hey buddy!” Dean kneeled down and invited Cas to do the same. Cuddling the dog and scratching his ears, Dean talked to Miracle, “Look who's back, buddy. I really got my miracle.” Grinning, he turned to Cas. “Cas, meet Miracle.”
“Ugh, same.” Dean scratched his neck with his free hand. The other still held onto Castiel. “How long?” Dean asked.
Somewhere in between, the fighting sounds stopped and only Sam and Dean’s voices could be heard but Castiel didn’t pay attention. He was too absorbed into the words of Dean’s prayers. What did it all mean? Could it be? Could it really be? Could he have been so wrong? Had there been hope all that time?
“Yeah, dumbo! I have eyes. You two were the only ones too blinded by love not to notice anything. Besides, I once was Cas’ vessel. Remember? I was too young and he was too much an assholy angel to understand his feelings or feelings in general, but yeah. That stuck with me.” Dean gaped, completely speechless.
The line of students was organized by an alphabetic order of the student’s last name. Castiel joined Anna in the middle of the line. He had to let go of Dean’s hand. With ‘Winchester’ as a last name, he had to go almost to the end of the line.
Suddenly, using the hand on his ass, Dean drew him tight against his body, spun them around, and pushed Castiel against the shower wall. He pinned him there, using his body as a wight and kipping him immobilized.
"Well, you never talk about girls you like and when we watch movies, you always say stuff about the guys’ appearance, not the girls’. I just figured you’re attracted to men, but not out yet. I wasn’t going to mention it, but man, that drummer is in a whole other league. I couldn’t not say something."
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “They never allowed us to come to school with dyed hair, it’s considered not “proper appearance in a school environment”. It’s in the school rules and regulations.”
He would feel embarrassed by how quickly he was going to come if it wasn’t for the knowledge of what Dean made him go through in the shower, and the fact that Dean’s reply to his broken sentence was:
There was also Balthazar. Balthazar was something else completely. He was in Ash and Victor’s homeroom class, and shared math class with Castiel. He was tall and had blue eyes and was the most stunning human being Castiel had ever seen. Although they didn’t really talk, it wasn’t like they necessarily avoided each other either. Balthazar was snarky and witty but was also distant. It was like he was living in his own world, and sometimes graced all the others with his presence. Castiel couldn't take his eyes off of him. He would look around at lunch, while talking with his friends, hoping he might catch a glimpse of the mysterious guy.
“I was in the middle of rearranging my room when you called me earlier, so there is a pile of stuff on my bed—including nails and books and clothes. And it’s late and I'm tired, but I can’t really go to sleep when I get home. Kill me now,” he groaned.
They got back to the lodgings around 17:00. Dinner was at 19:00, and after that they had a party planned out for them, so they had two hours to rest and get ready. They got to their floor and each went to their own room.
The funny thing about high school and their little gang, was that instead of mocking them for being different like he was used to, other kids seemed to fear them. Three months in, and no one dared to approach them during recess. They were still ‘the freaks’, but on one wanted to take the risk of being kicked by an army boot.
“No, you’re alright.” Dean put his arm over Castiel’s shoulder in a tight hug “Your sneakers are fine. Don’t ever change.”
“You tongue will swell after all of this; it’ll give it the space it needs. After a month of taking care of the piercing the way I’ll show you later, you’ll be able to change it to a shorter one. Do you have more questions before we do it?”
"No, I’m not!” Castiel dramatically put his hands over his heart, gasping in mock hurt, “I just happen to prefer romantic period novels. It gives me hope."
Disappointed and heartbroken, Castiel decided to go to his old room before… what? He didn’t know what he would do now. All he wanted was to see Dean, but he was gone. Maybe Castiel will travel the world searching for another sign of him. Maybe... Now, though, all he wanted to do was lie down in his old bed and cry.
Castiel was in his room and he was angry. He wanted to break something - anything. He looked around him, at his room, a place that was supposed to be his safe space and hated what he saw. The walls were full of pictures that he didn’t like. The furniture was all set wrong. He started to feel like the room was suffocating him. Without too much thought, he started taking the picture frames off the wall, yanking the nails they were hanging from and throwing them on his bed. He pulled out all the clothes he had in his closet and all the books in his bookshelf and put them on this bed as well. Then he started rearranging his furniture.
Castiel was very happy the day he got his ID, a week after his 16’s birthday, and he was even happier to present it right now.
He didn’t even have a chance to gloat about his victory when she continued in asking, “Is it because Balthazar isn’t here?”
That made both girls laugh. Castiel smiled to himself. He really liked his friends. A feeling of gratitude filled him. He had friends who looked for him in his free period and wanted to be with him. Which made him think, “Why were you looking for me?”
He thought about himself with an eyebrow piercing, but he didn’t like that idea. He had thick eyebrows that made himself conscious as it was, adding something that’ll draw attention to them wouldn't be wise.
At 16:00 sharp Dean was in front of Castiel's door. By 16:20 they rang Balthazar and told him to come meet them at the bus stop.
“All I know is that I prefer my first time doing anything with a guy to be with you.” He paused again and took a deep breath. “I know I can trust you. I know you won’t judge me and you'll tell me if I’m doing something you don't like. I can be myself with you."
Castiel let himself float up in the air. He closed his eyes, like he remembered from Dean’s story, and let his thoughts drift to better times. He saw Dean’s eyes, deep and green and shining. He saw Dean’s smile, warm and sincere as it lit up his face and made his eyes crinkle. He saw Dean’s body, tall and toned and young.
School had been tough for Castiel. His other classmates thought he was odd, and he’d always struggled to fit in. Even his interests were different - Castiel liked to listen to rock music while most of his peers liked pop music, his wardrobe consisted of almost entirely black clothes, and he painted his nails a different color each week. He preferred to spend his recess inside, working on schoolwork or reading instead of out on the playground with the other kids.
“I’m going.” Meg lifted her hand like she was still in class. “Are you going as well?” She asked him after a bit.
Dean said it in such a low voice that if Castiel wasn’t sitting right next to him he’d probably wouldn't have heard it.
Balthazar didn’t look at him when he said that. He was looking at his food and took a bite out of it the moment he ended that sentence. Castiel blushed and had to look away from Balthazar. He didn’t want to betray just how much what he said affected him.
"Hey, Cas, I forgot to take the shampoo out of my toiletry bag. It’s the purple one hanging on the hook near the door. Can you get it for me?"
Castiel spent their walk explaining what he did and how he’d thought he’d have time to clear it all up before bedtime. Dean seemed amused by the whole ordeal.
After the initial shock, Castiel burst out laughing. That was the last thing he expected to be asked about, and leave it to Meg to ask so bluntly. God, he loved Meg. He tried to calm himself enough to talk. He took a couple of deep breaths and dried his eyes that were watering from his laughter.
Dean started moving to the direction of the right screen door in front of them. They all followed him. Led Zeppelin’s ‘Immigrant song’ was in full blast. The floor was filled with people jumping to the beat. It wasn’t a very big dance floor, enough for approximately 40 people to dance without feeling like sardines. On the far end of it was a small bar that tonight served nonalcoholic beverages for double the retail price.
A few minutes later a cab arrived and picked them up. A few minutes after that, Castiel was back in his room with the instruction from both Dean and Balthazar to call them if he needed anything.
“If you need another blanket, there are more on the left side of the closet, okay?” Dean’s voice interrupted Castiel’s thoughts, his voice slurred from exhaustion. “I’m so tired I can’t keep my eyes open. Good night, Cas.”  With that, Dean turned on his belly and snuggled into his blanket.
Meg and Jo got up, took their bags and started rushing to their next class. Castiel put his book back in his bag and, shaking his head at the girls, began walking in the opposite direction to his next class.
“Yeah. For some reason I’m tired too.” With that, Dean did something he had never done before. He leaned dawn, put his head on Castiel’s stomach, and closed his eyes. “Your belly is so soft and warm… It’s like the perfect pillow… We can talk later...” Castiel didn’t know how to react so he just laughed awkwardly and stayed still, looking at the wall in front of him.
At one of the stops along the way, he and Dean got into another of their silly banters, shoving each other and trying to soak one another with water from their water bottles. Castiel got the upper hand at some point and stood over Dean, who was lying on the ground, and poured what was left in his bottle on him. They were laughing so hard they almost missed that everyone was starting to move again. Castiel helped Dean off the ground by holding his hand and pulling him up to a standing position. Dean thanked him and then said on a teasing voice:
To that, Castiel made the impossible effort to move his hand a little and flicked the closest part of Dean he could reach, which was his thigh. This made Dean laugh even harder.
He flew around the big building looking for some sign of life, something to let him know that he was not too late. One of the windows was broken, shattered by a tree branch that somehow got jammed through it. The room it belonged to looked dark from where he hovered, but Castiel knew by its location that it was John and Mary Winchester's old bedroom. Their room was located above the Winchesters’ family garden. They received the fountain with two angels holding hands as a wedding gift from both their parents, according to the inscription on a plank attached to it. Castiel’s father told him once that the tree in front of the window was the one Mr. Winchester planted on the day Dean was born, and the one right next to it was the one he planted on the day Sam was. Mary put the bench under them, in front of the fountain. After Mary died in a house fire that started in Sam’s nursery when Sam was 6 months old, Mr. Winchester and Dean planted a Forget-Me-Not plant in her memory. A few days later, Mr. Winchester left for one of his long business trips for the first time. Castiel once heard Dean tell Sam that their mother used to tell him that whenever he is sad, he should come and sit on the bench and everything would be all right because angels were watching over him there.
There were the guys from the volleyball team, the girls from cheerleading, some of the stoners, and some of the kids that had no special designation but were friends with each other.
Through the haze of his post orgasmic bliss, he felt Dean let go of his Cock. He heard Dean moan, and the sound of fast flapping skin to skin. Castiel opened his eyes to the sight of Dean jerking himself off while looking at the mess of cum on his belly.
“We just had sex, after we showered together, and now you’re messy again. I don’t know why but that thought cracks me up.”
“Times have changed, Dad. It’s different now. My school even has a club that celebrates queer people. That’s actually how I got involved with Cas. I just said robotics because I was too scared to say where I really was.”
“Cas, that’s not…it’s an expression” he shook his head, but as always, his boyfriend’s cluelessness made him melt a little (it was so hard to be angry when this doofus was beside him). “The point is, it’s all starting to hit me. The stress of it all. I guess I was distracted before.”
At that moment, Miracle decided to enter the kitchen and started barking, excitedly. She also wanted to show her love, so she ran to jump on the back of Dean’s legs. The sudden bump sent Dean flying forward a little and further into the embrace of his loved ones.
Spinning around, he found himself a few inches away from the most beautiful pair of eyes he’s ever seen in his life-pools of crystal blue that sparkled in the morning sun. Attached to them was a boy around his age with fluffy brown hair and a pearly white smile that made Dean’s heart flutter.
“Hello!” the child raised one of his hands in what Dean assumed was a wave, despite the lack of movement. “My name’s Jack.”
“But Dean, you know how Dad is about that stuff,” Sam warned, “He used to get on your case from just sitting too close to another guy. And there was that one time with your friend…”
“You knew,” Dean repeated, “and that’s why you were always so strict about the people I hung out with growing up. You didn’t want me to get too close to people you thought might be like me.”
The longer he stared, the more his heart raced, and he came to the conclusion that he could not keep this up much longer. Images of his and Cas’s almost kiss were flashing through his head again, and it took everything to keep from exploding in a fit of emotion. He knew he had to talk to Cas and soon.
“It’s not about that. I know you didn’t mean anything. I just get anxious about my body sometimes. It’s nothing to do with you.”
“Well, it’s because I’m sort of embarrassed. I know I shouldn’t be, but it’s hard sometimes,” he lowered his volume some more, “You see, I’ve never been in a serious relationship before because every guy I’ve ever liked has turned me away after realizing that I can’t give them what they want. Even when I try...it just isn’t what they’re looking for.”
“Michael,” Cas appeared surprised. “What are you doing home? I thought you were going out with people from work tonight.”
“Wait, you think I meant that I wanted to….” he stammered, “Ok, you may be skipping a little too far down the line here, Cas. I just came out, so nowhere near ready to have sex with a guy. As much as I like you, that’s just not within my comfort zone right now.”
He had lost Cas far too often. Every single time had left him more heartbroken than the ones before. It shouldn’t even be possible, and yet it was true. Never again, he wanted to wake up alone in a world without Cas, where Cas wasn’t around, wasn’t by his side.
What he saw was worth the effort. Cas had already lost his coat and jacket and was now stripped down to his boxers, his fingers working on the buttons of his shirt. It was a hell of a sight, and yet it still took all of Dean’s willpower to keep his eyes open. He wanted to burn this sight into his memory. For years, the guy had been technically naked when he shed no more than his coat. Whereas this ... This? This was blasphemy and would reserve Dean a special place in hell. As if Cas had read Dean’s thoughts – he actually might have – his angel turned and spotted him watching.
For a short lucid moment, he remembered. Before the nightmares would start again, he needed to remind himself that Dean Winchester was alive. Dean was alive. That was everything he ever wanted. At least, everything he could hope for under the current circumstances.
As if he only had waited for permission, Dean’s body convulsed and white streaks of ejaculate shot over his chest. It was all it needed to take Castiel over the edge too, unfamiliar feelings crushing through him, freeing him in a way he had never anticipated, and taking him to another plane of consciousness. He had witnessed the birth of stars, had been present when the first animal set its feet on land, had seen the rise and fall of civilisations. In this very moment, he experienced everything at once – the entire universe at every point in time. He could see everything. But his world was orbiting around the human he was finally allowed to call his, the man he had loved for years and who had upturned his whole existence. The brightest star of all.
Castiel didn’t lose any time. Instead of taking the long route through the doors, he flapped his wings once and was sitting perfectly clad on the passenger seat, before Dean even had finished his sentence.
It took them a while to get up after Dean had initiated a full-blown tickle war. Eventually, Cas lifted a giggling Sammy to his shoulders, before he helped Dean to his feet.
“She’s still heading east. Just passed through St. Louis. Don’t worry, I won’t lose her. The bitch is history.”
Letting go of his shoulders, Castiel took both of Dean’s hands in his. Thinking back, he tried to remember yesterday’s events. Slowly, he started to speak, “I had a dream, another nightmare. It was different from the other ones but it had the same outcome. You were dying.”
His heart stopped and immediately raced towards some kind of panic he couldn’t stop. Only a few hours ago, if it even were hours, Dean had talked about taking it slow, just to be betrayed by his own dick. And now? Even though Cas had assured him of being interested despite his obvious asexuality or whatever this thing was called, Dean didn’t want to freak him out when they just got together. Time to play it safe. “Hey, sunshine.”
Over and over he could feel the cold rising in his body, the hopelessness and darkness. Again and again, he drowned. Every time it was the same routine, yet every new nightmare was worse than the one before. There was the Apocalypse wrecking the Earth. Hell was raised and Heaven had fallen. There were Leviathans roaming freely over the Earth, breeding and feeding on humans. Metatron enthroned in Heaven as the new God. All of creation devoured by the Darkness, or destroyed by Chuck. Everything they ever fought for, extinguished.
Dean returned with two identical cowboy hats. “Look at these beauties.” Placing it on top of Castiel’s head, his eyes grew wide. “Damn! I’m a lucky bastard.” Suddenly, he dropped down to one knee. “Cas. Castiel, angel. Will you marry me?”
Dean chuckled, and placed a chaste kiss on his jaw. “Give me some rest, sunshine. I ain’t twenty anymore.”
Gabriel spread his arms, grinning broadly. “The kiddo’s explosion started up some life up here. Or so they say.”
“Do I look as if I don’t know what I’m doing, old man? Hell, I thought I learned from the best. But I must have been mistaken.” She shook her head.
And as if he was fully on board, Dean heard himself planning ahead with Cas. “No. You call him. This is your crazy idea. And he has this telepathic link thing going on. Don’t think it’ll work with me. But with your angel mojo it’ll do for you. And so you know, I totally blame you when anything happens to Sammy.” Dean pointed his finger at Cas. “Or when we return and find out the bunker turned into unicorn sparkle world.” A shudder ran down Dean’s spine. “Scariest crime scene ever.”
“Kind of. One day you’ll remember again.” Hopefully, Sam would. They still hadn’t heard from Claire, but then again Dean hadn’t checked his phone for hours. Too many things had happened since then. “Hey, Cas. Any news from Claire?”
But it was a hunger Sammy didn’t need to know about. “Nah, we’re good. We’ll just head over to my room, getting some shut-eye.”
How the fuck could Jack know? Nobody knew. Nobody was allowed to know. But if Jack knew… Dean refused to think about the implications. His heart raced. Still coughing, he finally took in his environment.
“Dean,” Cas screamed, his arms held behind his back by the entity, but still struggling with it. “Let me go, you ... you obnoxious slime monster.”
Finally, Claire laughed. “Give my regards to the two lovebirds when they once again emerge from their nest.”
Suddenly, the fog lifted and a wooden wall of a building, a barn, appeared in his view. When the fog was gone completely, everything started to blur for a different reason when he assessed the situation. His worst nightmare was coming to pass.
So, all Castiel allowed himself was sitting close behind Dean and listening to his breathing. It was more than Castiel could wish for, more than he was usually allowed, and more than he usually allowed himself. Still, it wasn’t enough. It would never be enough.
Castiel took the change of atmosphere as a sign they stopped playing and turned away from Dean in order to hide his reddening face.
The video ended, and Dean was looking for another one to watch. It was quiet in the room, and Castiel’s mind drifted. He thought about the weekend he had, which he spent most of with Dean, and how much calmer he was in contrast to the rest of the week.
In the bathroom, he got into one of the stalls and locked it. He set on the closed toilet, not caring about hygiene, and tried to stop crying.
Two hours after they got home, Castiel was already after a shower, a meal, and unpacking his suitcase. He was just finishing putting his dirty clothes in the washing machine when he heard a knock on the front door. He heard his mother open the door, and then her calling “Castiel, you have a visitor!”
The studio was well lit and smelled of disinfectant. There was a treatment bed on one side of the studio, a chair, and shelves full of boxes. Rufus told him to sit on the bed while he gathered what he needed. He put a metal tray next to him on the bed and put some tools and things in sealed plastic bags on it.
He entered the room through the broken window. After being in the sunlight (was it morning or afternoon? Castiel wasn’t sure), it took him a minute or so to adjust to the darkness inside. The bedroom looked like it hadn’t been used in a long while; cob webs and a thick layer of dust covered everything. The door to the room was open and Castiel floated into the corridor that led down to the main hall of the place he used to call home. Everything was dark. The big sofa that Dean used to read stories to Sam on was still there, standing in front of the fireplace, but it was the only furniture there. All the chairs, the table, the pictures, everything that made this hall what it used to be, were gone. Hope was starting to drift away from him. No one was here in a long time, Dean was probably gone too. With the little hope still left in him, Castiel decided to check upstairs again and floated toward Dean’s and Sam’s rooms.
