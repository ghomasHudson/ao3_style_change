Steve gave Tony a soft smile and then nodded. “Brooklyn, born and raised. Yourself?”
“Aw pet, that’s a shame. We’ll wait for you at dinner.” She went over to place one sandwich in front of Steve and gave him a kiss on the cheek before she left with Tony and headed home. Nowadays it was usually just her and him during lunch, especially seeing as Tony was still not back to work by order of the big boss himself.
‘What’s that about?’ Clint signed as best as he could and James shrugged, his hand on Clint’s back as he guided him to the living room.
His hearing aid battery had died on day two and since then he had been in total silence. It was nearing the two week mark and Clint was slowly unraveling. He hadn’t been without hearing aids since those first weeks coming home from the war when he and Natalia were trying to earn enough money to buy him a pair.
And she had the girls. She had even gone for lunch the other day with Maria and Natalia, who would be staying at James’, Steve had found out, which was perfect because it put them even closer to one another. So she wasn’t alone. He would still worry as any son would about their mother and he would worry about Benni. This would be his first time away from his big brother.
“Thank you.”
“Tony,” Steve called, unwrapping his sandwich. He looked up again, expression unreadable. “Not much of a fighter?” He was looking at the wounds he could see, the bruising and the bandages. “Or a klutz?”
Clint nodded.
Sarah leaned down to them, gently pulling Benni away and making him drink a bit of water which helped the boy to calm his breathing, though he was still holding Tony’s good hand tightly.
James led Clint back over to the couch and maneuvered them so that Clint was in his lap sideways, his head still resting on James’ shoulder and James’ arm tight around him. His other hand was gently stroking Clint’s cheek as he whispered reassurances.
Dmitri have to teach you to use it before you ever take it out of the house.”
Natalia looked over at James and he did his very best to hide his smirk but in all honesty he wasn’t trying very hard.
“If you’re the good one, I’m Japanese,” Sarah said and James’ mouth fell open briefly before he went back to eating, defeated.
It was a companionable silence, though. It still seemed too intense for Clint but Tony’s presence made it slightly more palatable. When he had been alone, the silence was too much.
Sarah smiled but didn’t look away from the
Monday came quicker than Steve wanted but work was a welcome distraction. Lately, he’d been trying to push Tony out of his head. To not think about the somersaults his stomach did when those brown eyes fell on him or how perfectly Tony fit in his arms when he hugged him. And especially not how Tony looked when he was laughing or teasing Steve.
“You will speak up when he asks you a question or your tongue will be the first thing I cut off.”
One Thursday, after counting only about twenty-eight dollars in the box, he had fully resigned. There wasn’t much he could do anymore, was there? And so he went to the kitchen, filled a can with fresh coffee and made sandwiches, closing the store and going to the address he knew so well. Maybe it was the cold, maybe it was the hunger, maybe it was the exhaustion but the way seemed much longer than before.
Clint was rubbing blood out of his eye that was dripping down from a cut on his forehead when a flash went off. When Clint looked up they were laughing, saying something about him but he couldn’t read their lips. He assumed it was a different language or maybe his brain was just too worn out.
He dragged his hands down his face again, groaning into them. “You inched your way into Tony’s life to help and it turned into more. I forced my presence on Clint because I was heartbroken and miserable over your pasty ass.”
He looked up from his bowl to see Tony watching him as intently as always. Steve felt the butterflies in his stomach fluttering much more furiously now, making their presence crystal clear.
“I don’t know. He won’t tell me. I’m guessing he wants it to be private and knowing Sam, he’d prefer that.”
“To Clint. For the diner incident. Pretty sure Natalia hates me.”
“Basic human requirement,” he supplied.
“So, I’m glad we had yet another house rules meeting but I think Sam and I have some unfinished business,” Bucky said, standing and leading Sam off to their bedroom.
“Well, that’s—”
Steve chuckled again but Tony’s words saddened him a little. Or a lot. The way he spoke about her. But Steve was happy he had someone in his life even if he didn’t realize it yet. “Hm, sounds like a good one then. Those are rare.” He moved his half-finished plate of eggs onto the counter beside the sink. He might come back for them later but his appetite was gone as was his desire for company. “Have fun, I’ll see ya when I see ya,” he told him with a light pat on the shoulder as he left.
“I am
“Show me the rest.” Everyone after that were underlings. Errand boys, the ones he sent out to pick up protection money or make deliveries to the other mobs. No one high up with access to much any of Steve’s life, business or private. Dugan was the only one with a key to his home, which did beg the question how Falsworth might’ve gotten in, and Dugan told him he had locked the office on the way over.
“Sir?” Tony asked confused and looked down on the plate. “I shouldn’t be gone for too long. Pepper can’t run the store alone around this time.” He appreciated the gesture but he simply couldn’t stay to eat. At least he had the foresight to change into better clothes this time around and he was grateful for it, even though it was simple black pants and a black sweater on top.
With help from Natalia’s girlfriend, Maria, who worked for the phone company as a senior switchboard operator, they had managed to get through the calls at a pace that kept Steve and James from losing it because, as it turned out, not only was Queens bigger than anyone needed it to be but also had more warehouses and restoration companies than any of them thought strictly necessary. The fact that they didn’t even know what kind of restoration made their search incredibly broad.
“This is Dugan, where’s Dmirtri?” The man apparently knew who he was and answered him immediately.
“You’re taking care of yourself now?” Tony asked and sat down on his bed. “You don’t need me anymore, eh?” He gently pinched a cheek and kissed it.
He opened the door and looked around the hallway to make sure that no one was there.
James was worried, honestly. Some days Clint seemed to be getting better—cracking jokes and teasing them—and others, worse—silent, kept himself away from everyone. He hadn’t opened up about what they’d been through but James knew he had to give him time, he couldn’t force it out of him. Clint would open up when he was ready, like when he had told James more about his home life and the war. Clint Barton was not a man who shared his deep thoughts and emotions readily.
“I’m not sure I want you to. Just don’t make it quick,” James said. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, opening them again and looking over at Steve with a cold, emotionless gaze. “Let’s go see if our delivery boy is ready to talk.”
“Did James’ folks ever know?” She asked. Steve shook his head.
He also thought about how difficult it would be to survive this situation all by himself again, should anything happen to Clint. It was a selfish reason, which made him feel bad, but now that he knew that it was easier with someone there to talk to he didn’t want to go back to being alone.
Clint looked around, taking in what Tony was saying and only pausing to readjust his crutches and then continue after him.
Rationally he knew that healing mentally and emotionally, as well as physically, was the main goal here but Clint was a guy with a very attractive partner and he wanted to do hot and steamy things with that partner and not have to worry about Tony’s minor-aged brother hearing it or Steve’s mother. Sure, Tony had said Benni knew to knock but knocking was not going to save him from hearing James and Clint’s bed knocking against the wall.
James pondered it for a minute, tapping the knife to his own chin, his forearm pushed painfully hard against Howard’s neck. “You know what, I don’t think any, Steve.”
“What’s the next move?” Dmitri asked and James turned to him, not used to hearing him actually comment during discussions like this. Natalia didn’t really have a place in the hierarchy of it all and while James didn’t see Dmitri as lesser or an underling, Dmitri had always been more of the sit and listen type.
“I told you, as long as you carry me around, I’ll be fine,” he said impatiently. “Come on, Mr Rogers. Don’t make me beg.”
“Yes, but he also doesn’t have to. All I need is one look at you to know how you’ve been. I know Tony’s not here but you think you could talk to James? At least tell him a little bit. He’s really worried about you, Clint, and he doesn’t want to push because somehow you managed to find the world’s most patient and understanding mob boss.”
When he had no tears left, a wave of exhaustion came over him. “Is it… do I have to stay here long?” he asked, with what little strength he had left. He didn’t want to sleep again. He needed to see Clint and make sure that he was okay.
Tony shrugged. Maybe. Maybe not. He didn’t really do relationships but he thought Steve was cute and sweet and anyone who responded that way to a drunken break in, Tony definitely needed to get to know better.
“You should eat it yourself. You didn’t sleep.”
Clint laughed. “Easier? Alright, in what normal way did you have your first kiss with yours?”
“Are you planning to catch your death?” Sarah scolded Tony, coming to close the window. “Sitting right there, wind in your face. Is your list of injuries not long enough yet?” She scoffed and shook her head, making Tony feel awful for what he had done.
Tony managed to stay as neutral as possible, not giving away anything and keeping his hands in his pockets just to make sure he didn’t do anything by accident. Once they were in the car and far away from the house they had just left, he couldn’t hold back his laugh anymore.
“I don’t know. I just woke up too,” Tony answered, finally letting go of Clint’s hand so he could focus on Steve. He combed through Steve’s hair with his now free hand. “Sarah and Benni are making lunch.”
The deli wasn’t far from Steve’s office. If something like that existed there, others would know Steve was allowing it. Maybe it was time to be more open in his support, come what may. He would have to think about it.
“Sounds like,” she began, straightening her blouse again, “he’s got you wrapped around his little finger.”
Tony didn’t have to tell Benni to help the others clear the table and once again he was quite proud of his brother. He hadn’t realized how grown he really was and that he didn’t need constant reminders for everything.
“Hmm,” Steve hummed happily when Tony shifted, the sound becoming a soft chuckle. He craned his neck forward and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “I think we’ve officially made this place ours.”
“Thank you,” he said, his voice still thick with sleep and more gruff than usual. He headed for the stove top and grabbed a plate, loading it up with food and taking a seat beside Tony. He poured himself coffee from the pot on the table and nearly finished it before starting his food, saying his own small grace when Sarah looked like she might throw her eggs at him if he ate without.
“I’m pretty sure it is,” he said, looking down away from Tony, ashamed. “You’d have to ask Winter just how over it is. I wasn’t much help to anyone.” He took another bite of the fruit salad in front of him, purposefully focusing on it. He hadn’t explicitly promised Tony he would bring Steve home in one piece but he knew it was an unspoken promise and he hadn’t been able to keep his word.
“You’ll watch that language with me, Steven.” He apologized. “With the lad? How bad?” He shrugged and she stopped him in the middle of the staircase, taking him by his arms. “I know there’s a lot you’re keeping from me and I don’t know why,” she admitted, searching his face.
Sarah had hoped for this, though with Tony not a lot could really be expected. All she did was pull him even closer to her, one hand on the back of his head, gently stroking his hair and the other on his back, rubbing comforting circles the same way she did with her other boys.
“I think I could do that but one word about how small I look in a pair of your sweats and I’m out of here, Rogers.”
“Yes, because we have feelings for each other.”
Suddenly it hit him how ironic this situation was. All he had wanted was to be with Steve while he went through this dangerous phase of trying to find the person threatening them. Now he was the one who had been so stupid to distance himself from the security measures Steve had put in place, which was how he ended up in this cold, bare room far away from Steve.
Steve pulled off of him but kept kissing and licking around him as Tony was coming down, and only a few minutes later, Steve himself came, quicker than he had in years and it was so good watching Tony watch him.
Tony pulled his hand away, a bitter smile on his face as he shook his head.
“Ummm,” he said, thinking back over his day. “We did lots of math.”
There was a knock and then Sarah opened the door when Steve said she could come in. “Hey, pet, everything a’right?” she asked in that soft, soothing voice of hers. She came in further, shutting the door behind her and sitting on the bed, her hand dropping onto Steve’s foot and she gave it a reassuring squeeze.
Upstairs Tony and Benni went through the usual evening routine and Tony read him not one but two chapters in his book. It wasn’t intentional at all but it felt good to read what was written and not let his mind wander.
Clint wasn’t afraid to answer the phone because he knew only a handful of people had that number and he knew all of them personally. He just didn’t know who
“Maybe I’m a little like Benni and need time with new people too,” Tony said with a small smile. “You know… last year around this time they had the man who raised me as their prisoner.” He didn’t know where the urge to talk about that came from but he simply had to.
Everyone’s home.
“Where’s Benni?” He asked, looking at Tony now. Once Steve knew that all of his family—Tony, Sarah, Benni, James, Dugan, and Jones—were alright, he could rest again.
?” Tony smiled at the second word and looked at Benni who smiled right back at him.
“Are… you oh… okay?” He asked, panting. “Too much?” He threw a hand over to land on Tony’s forehead, moving his hair away from his sweaty skin and brushing a thumb over his eyebrow. Tony was so beautiful.
“Oh? Like what? You know you gotta give me something specific if you want a treat before dinner.”
“They loved him but they were always talkin’ dirty of the ‘deviant’ people,” he said, doing air quotes with one free hand. “His sister knew before she passed. She didn’t care, loved her brother.” James’ sister, Anna, caught him and Steve one day and she had more questions than anything else. She really liked Steve and was just happy that it seemed he’d be around for a long time. She passed in a car accident along with his parents. James loved his parents but losing her had been harder on him.
James hummed pensively.
“Smart,” Clint said, although not sure he would’ve been able to do the same thing if the situation was reversed. He had nothing of James’ and he wished he did. “There’s just so many people I wish I could say goodbye to.”
“Yes,” he admitted, resting his hand on Tony’s slim waist, loving the way Tony always looked at him afterwards. Steve did feel better
Clint and Natalia heard from the hallway. They listened as Lucky’s taps got closer again because there was no sound to be heard from James’ approach.
“Have you been good? Are you eating properly?” He asked and combed through his hair. The boy pulled away and wiped his tears, nodding. “Good. You’re so brave,
in love with.”
Two large plates with appetizers and two plates with small sandwiches were placed on the counter next to the register a few minutes later and Tony moved to fix up some coffee when he heard Howard speaking in his customer-friendly voice, inviting them in. Tony quickly brought the can with fresh coffee to the front and saw the small group of men standing around the counter, trying some appetizers while Howard explained to them what they were eating. He got at least two wrong but Tony wouldn’t dare to correct him in front of the Irish. Instead he filled cups with coffee and offered them to the men.
They were spotted by one who fired off a shot, quickly alerting the others but thankfully, by that time there were only four left and only two had guns, the others knives. Within a few seconds, the men were down and the room was silent.
“You’re more than welcome,” he told him, drying out the empty sink now. They were done washing up. Steve took the teatowel from Tony and hung them on their hooks to dry and stayed there for a moment, debating. He walked over to Tony with determination, acting while the impulse overpowered his rationality. He pulled him into a hug and stayed there for a moment. Longer than the last time he’d impulsively hugged him—tighter too, even letting his head drop onto Tony’s for a brief moment. He hadn’t noticed that their height difference was so profound until now. “We’re all happier with you around,” he told him again.
And they still didn’t know if they were being kept separate. The last thing he wanted was for Tony to be going through all of this on his own. To not know why he was taken. He hadn’t even been given the opportunity to talk to Steve like Clint was. Granted, Clint hadn’t even been able to hear James. That must’ve hurt.
“Speaking of… well, nothing I just wanna ask how the tour with Stark and Rhodes went,” Bucky said and Steve rolled his eyes.
“I know, Tony.”
“You don’t have to do it alone. I know that’s grand coming from me but I don’t want to hurt you more.”He hugged Steve, resting his cheek on his sweaty chest. There wasn’t anything else he could say, so he focused on hugging Steve until he felt him relax some.
Steve started doing the washing up and without being asked, Tony came to help. A part of him was appreciative of how easily Tony and Benni helped out. Another part of him was disgusted by how they just wordlessly went to work, assuming it was their job.
“Such a pompous know-it-all.”
“I swear I won’t tell anyone.” Benni scooted closer and held his pinky finger up to Tony, which he accepted. Afterwards Tony pulled him in for a tight hug and kissed the top of his head.
“Alright.”
“Ugh, Steven, you need a bath,” she said, pinching her nose and pretending to wave away his smell. He finished the glass and turned to give her a look, all in good fun. She looked him up and down and added, “Maybe even two.”
“America is the promised land. You people win fights without bringing them to your own soil,” Bakuto said with a smile that made Steve want to bash his face in. “The girls are all only too happy for a chance to experience that promise.”
Steve chuckled. “What? Why not?”
It wasn’t so much the stinging or the slight discomfort Tony was feeling, but the heat that surrounded him and was now pressing into him as well. For a brief moment he wondered if this was normal and healthy but that thought was quickly discarded. He forced his eyes open for just a second and what he was seeing was worth everything. He simply nodded and moved his hips slightly, gasping when he felt Steve even deeper.
lettuce = 1940s slang for money
“A true friend. So when’s the second date?”
Tony did not see that coming. He was so startled by Steve’s words he didn’t even know what to think, let alone how to react.
“I know. It’s a risk I’m willing to take.” He squeezed James’ hand. “What about you?”
James laughed and nodded. “One last thing before we go back out.” He glanced back to the far corner where Howard was, assuming he was unconscious but on the chance he wasn’t, he continued in Russian, “
On Saturday before Christmas Eve Tony hadn’t seen Howard in two days, which also meant a whole day of income that wasn’t being taken away. He was sitting in front of the box, the letter Mr Rogers had written, next to his phone number to his right while he was counting and counting again, calculating expenses and costs. Benni was fast asleep in his bed while Tony was lost in thought. Twenty-six dollars and thirty-eight cents. During the holidays train tickets were more expensive but if only he could make it to Florida, maybe Texas. Somewhere warm. Somewhere far away. He had no idea how much it would cost to get a place anywhere but Brooklyn. He had no idea about life anywhere else. He looked to his sleeping brother and sighed. Anything was better than staying though, right?
Clint turned his face away, burying it in James’ shoulder because he assumed it was Steve, and James looked up and gave Tony a soft smile but his eyes went to Tony’s hands and he decided against actually asking for anything.
, I never got to thank you. This was your idea and now it’s really happened.” He tightened his grip around the cup of black coffee and stared into the dark liquid. Why was it so difficult to use his words sometimes? “You once told me that your number one priority is Steve and that you’re protecting your child.” After another short pause he managed to look up again into her eyes. “I just hope you know that he’s my number one too.”
can have dessert.”
?” He said, holding a notepad and James put in a breakfast order for his chef downstairs. Dmitri nodded and headed off.
Pepper smiled as she reached out to accept the record. Her smile grew wider and she ended up chuckling to herself, shaking her head.
“Okay,” Steve said, writing it all down and listening to James talk to someone else. He assumed it was either Clint or Dmitri but he knew neither of them had any plans to tell Tony about Steve looking for a ring. “Alright, got it. Thanks.”
“It was nice to see a movie again,” he admitted and looked down. He was about ready to go back and sleep some more. Why he was so tired that he didn’t know, he just was. And out in the open he felt even more vulnerable. He wanted to add something about the movie as a couple passed them and Tony smelled the man’s cologne and he froze. It was Howard’s. He’d know that smell anywhere. Only Howard’s was usually mixed with the stench of booze. Tony stared at the man and moved closer to the houses behind him. It was cold. There was the smell and suddenly Tony’s whole body started to ache again.
“Yes?”
“Thank you,” Clint said softly. It was far from over. He knew the thoughts would come back to plague him the next time he was brushing his teeth and staring at himself in the mirror, particularly if James with his perfectly sculpted body stood beside him. But he could also tell that James was far from done convincing him otherwise.
It had been so long since he’d tried speaking consolingly to someone or tried to be gentle. He and his mother were rarely gentle with one another as was their way and he and James had such an understanding of one another that it wasn’t necessary. It was easy with Benni because Steve knew where he stood with him. He was a big brother figure. It was not easy with Tony because a big brother was the last thing he wanted to be but he also realized that it might be what Tony needed.
“But love is invisible.”
It was a hellhole of a place on a good day but try mid-December stripped down to the bare essentials—pants and an undershirt, no shoes—and tied tightly to a metal chair, a faulty pipe located right above your head that dripped on you constantly at a steady rhythm, preventing you from sleep or a moment’s peace.
“I’ll see where Steve is and then we’ll come down too,” Tony said and watched Benni leave the room. Just as the door closed, there was a faint knock on it. “Yes?”
Pakhan (Russian) - boss
Clint was at the table, his hands raised and mouth opened as though he were paused in the middle of telling a story, which he was, and Tony was at the table with him, a cup of coffee in front of him while he listened to another of Clint’s shenanigans.
“Can I see him? Tony?”
“What good can possibly come from me telling Steve I’m in love with him?” He dragged a hand down his face. “We can never be together anyway because of who we are but more than that, I’m not the one
“Huh, very cool. Maybe I’ll bring my car by sometime.”
“I… I’m not bored,” he told him, “I feel
“Good morning,
“You think Steve would like me with a shaved head?”
“No.” Steve knew he was telling the truth. Tony wouldn’t. He didn’t seem the kind.
After they had eaten and cleaned up, Steve had a few more calls to make but nothing requiring him to leave the house. He did go in his office and close the door, though. Some of the calls were in relation to their trip, some were business, most were about a few rings he had found, and the last call was unexpected.
“Cap, wait,” Rhodey yelled, swinging an arm out in front of him to make him stop. “Can you hear that?”
“Your stupid boyfriend jumped in front of a bomb for me,” Rhodey said and Tony laughed but it was wet and strained. He felt the tears welling up in his eyes. He knew that Steve was just generally a selfless person but he also knew Steve had done what he did for Tony as well. He knew Tony couldn’t live without Rhodey.
“Four o’clock? Why don’t we just talk about this right now. I can be there in thirty minutes. It’s been long—”
“She’s not my bird. She’s a friend,” he said, making the other two laugh.
He had his good days and his bad days, as he always had, but naturally the bad days had become more frequent since James and Steve had brought them home. And since Tony and Steve had left for their vacation to Ireland, he had been especially sensitive.
His heart nearly skipped a beat and he took a deep breath.
After breakfast on Saturday Tony and Benni got dressed to go out. Steve was gone, his bedroom door closed, so he decided to leave him a note in front of his door, saying: “Out with Benni and Pepper. Will be back in the afternoon -TS.” Why he put his initials there, he didn’t know. Wasn’t like Benni or Sarah would leave him that kind of note but there was no changing it now.
Clint nodded along, having concluded that it was something like that. “I’m here for you, you know? To tell me this stuff before it keeps you up at night.”
“I don’t know yet.”
,” he said over and over again.
“He won’t get to you either,” the boy said with a maturity that didn’t really surprise Tony but was still amazing to see. “Cap promised that.”
Pepper met with Tony at the Owl’s Head park together with two of her younger siblings who were eager to have a new friend to play with.
Steve chuckled. “Guess I’m just used to them,” he answered, reaching up to straighten Tony’s tie as he got closer to him. His hands moved out from the tie to each of his shoulders and he gave him a light squeeze, unsure how much was still sore. He couldn’t help but look him up and down again. “You look grand.”
“We keep blaming Bakuto but you and I both know we are just as much at fault. We dragged them into this life even if they came willingly. Doesn’t mean we aren’t still accountable for allowing it.” He sighed, letting his head fall back. “I should’ve never let him out of my sight. I should’ve given Bakuto what he wanted and got Clint back.”
“And France,” Clint continued to pry once James was reading his paper again.
“Eh, I’ll make an exception and I’ll make you something sweet and non-alcoholic,” Clint told him. “Don’t like the taste or just very good about obeying the law?” He found himself laughing as he asked his question. If he were good about obeying the law, he would probably not be with Steve.
“I’ll surprise you.”
“Leave some for the boys. You’ve had at least twenty,” she teased.
“Point taken.”
“Listen,” Jones said slowly, “Cap needs to know about these.”
“Oh, right. Nice to meet you, officer.”
Clint shook his head. There were many voices that piped up when James asked him that question, all with conflicting reasons for saying no and then one small voice at the back being drowned out as it cried ‘yes!’ but was ignored.
“All of this. It’s just so different from the things surrounding my and Tony’s relationship.” He was referring to Clint’s bar. Tony’s family-owned establishment hadn’t been something he wanted to revisit. It was not a place where he and Steve went to relax but it was clear by James’ posture and conversation with Phil that he and Clint were here often.
“Is that all you were worried about?”
Sarah rinsed her hands under the water and placed a hand between his shoulder blades, not judging Tony for flinching at the unexpected touch.
Tony wrapped an arm around Benni and kissed his temple.
“I don’t think Steve’s impromptu visit really hurt customer turnout,” Clint argued.
“Today was the longest Tuesday ever,” Sam said, sitting on the couch in the communal room and leaning back, his eyes shut. “Buck, what’re we having for dinner?”
“I think I’d rather have a gun.”
might finally die. And it got worse. And then you came.” Tony moved to look at Steve again. “You’re the answer to my prayers.”
Clint shrugged. “I’m a wildcard thrown into the mix. I’ve upset your usual way of life.”
“He does not have me wrapped around his anything,” Clint countered, groaning when he heard the double entendre. Natalia grinned and leaned further forward on the counter to take in his embarrassment.

“A’right, fine,” Steve said, his accent slipping more and more away from Irish-American to simply Irish. “I see how it is.”
“Look at this and tell me what you see and be careful because I already know which answer is right.” He had the paper with the missing amount in his pocket, having swiped it off the desk before O’Shea made it over.
The door was forced open and then James and Steve were standing in front of them and Clint wasn’t sure if he was dead or alive.
“We’re taking a break,” he told him and Falsworth nodded and took back his hand, shaking it to make it stop throbbing.
to help. I’ve said this before, love, you’re no burden.”
With the handkerchief in his pocket he cleaned the names written on the stones and placed the bouquets in front of them.
“Listen, baby,” James said and his voice went softer than Clint had ever heard it. “I’m not going to push you to tell me how you feel or what you’re thinking. I just want you to know that I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk, no matter what it’s about or when it is. Even if you think it’s silly. I know I don’t understand the way Tony can but I am here for you.”
“I can see why,” Tony said and looked at all the books. He could spend a lifetime reading and he’d probably still not be done with the amount of books in this house. “It’s absolutely beautiful.” And it reminded him of his own new bedroom.
“Well… yes.” That wasn’t the only thing but it was definitely a large, deciding factor. It’s not like sex was the
Tony waited until everyone had their food in front of them and Benni took his broken hand very carefully, signaling to him that they would say grace first. He hadn’t done that in years and he truly hoped no one would ask him to do it.
“Hey, guys, let’s refuel,” Steve said as they headed back after a relatively light call.
He sat down next to Steve and watched his chest rise and fall slowly. He knew he should tell Sarah that everyone was going to sleep but he couldn’t bring himself to get up. Even though there was no danger, Tony felt the urge to protect his sleeping man at all costs. Keep him safe so he could sleep peacefully like he deserved. He was determined to stay up and watch over him like a hawk if he had to, but soon enough the steady sound of Steve’s breathing made him fall asleep too.
“I can’t do this anymore,” he whispered and shook his head. “I want to go home.”
She reached up to move his hair away from his forehead and spoke even softer than before, if that was even possible. “When you see him next, ‘cause I reckon he’ll be a wee bit scarce the next few days, talk to him. I know he’d appreciate it.”
,” Steve swore in Gaelic. “I didn’t want you to be frightened any more than you had to be.”
“Yes, good help is hard to come by these days and I’ve seen the way you clean the dishes,” Steve teased back. “But after so long on the boat, I wouldn’t mind just a little time at the cottage. We’ll probably stop to pick up some groceries first.”
“In Russia.”
it’s Tony by the way
“He had a lick of Falsworth’s coffee and figured drinking any more of it was a worse fate than braving that deli.” She chuckled. “He and Falsworth went to get some things.” She hummed.
“Yeah, Steve… what’s his deal?”
“Why are you up here?”
James pushed his chair back to follow. “Let me make sure he doesn’t leave out the ones where he looks terrible,” he said with a laugh, following after Steve.
“What do you want?” he asked between hungry kisses.
“Please don’t let that name catch on,” he groaned and Steve laughed, going over to give him a hug. James pulled him into a tight, crushing bear hug.
James nodded slowly, understanding sinking in. He also felt a flash of fury directed towards Fitz but he knew the young man hadn’t
He couldn’t see himself, there was no mirror, but he knew he had lost a few pounds at least already. Between the stress and starvation, he hoped there would be something left to him by the time James found him.

“I’d slip her a note,” he stated simply with a shrug. “Wait for her in the morning when she’s headed out and accidentally walk into her, slip the note in her pocket and make a run for it.”
“I’m not telling you again.”
“In all the time you’ve known me, have you ever seen me cook more than toast?” Steve asked, slowing at an intersection before continuing down the country road. “With ma and James around, I suppose I never really sharpened my kitchen skills and now I have you.” He looked over at Tony and winked.
He held Tony’s face between his hands and pressed another quick kiss to his lips. “I needed that,” he said, touching their foreheads together. He sat back and said, “It’s James. There’s something important he’s not telling me.”
. It fit him so well even though it was so ordinary. “I’ll make sure to ask him when I see him the next time then,” he answered and looked back out the window.
Tony was even getting used to going out more. Every now and then he went with Dugan or Jones to pick Benni up from school and make a short stop to get a treat, a new book, or drawing materials. Sarah made sure that Benni never left the house without money.
Clint thought that was Phil but he couldn’t lift his head to be sure. His body was tense and buzzing with energy. He felt ready to run but at the same time knew he couldn’t, his legs heavy like lead.
Steve looked over at Clint and gave him a nod, turning back to Tony. “Shall I carry you, love? Or are you still awake enough to walk?”
“Of course.” He nodded to confirm it again. To have more people here was scary but also exciting, especially since one of them was Clint. “I trust you. If you say Lucky is nice, I’m sure I’ll like him. Benni always wanted a pet.”
“Cap,” Dugan said, knocking lightly on the door before sticking his head around, “there’s someone here liked to see ya.”
“Thank you.”
“Out of curiosity I’ll have to ask what the obvious is to like about Steve?” he asked with a smile.
James pulled Tony aside gently, far enough away that Steve couldn’t hear, and pretended like he was explaining something on Steve’s chart, keeping their backs to him.
“It is,” Steve said, looking down at Tony with all the love he felt in his heart. Steve had done a lot in his life but right now and forever the only goal he had left to achieve was to always make sure Tony was happy.
And neither had slept a particularly large amount. Steve’s body gave out on him and they found him knocked out on the couch at one point but thirty minutes later, when Dugan re-entered to cross off another warehouse, Steve was up plotting points on the map as they narrowed it down. James’ body was only slightly more used to being treated terribly and only Dmitri had caught him close his eyes for a few minutes—seven, he counted—so far.
“This one,” James said, tapping the point of his knife to a neighborhood they had circled.
“It’s eleven thirty, where have you been?” Bruce asked when Tony walked into the garage.
“Mr Romanov,” a man said, coming over to James and extending a hand. James eyed it but did not take it.
Benni had just asked James if he knew that the moon wasn’t a planet when Tony felt Steve press his leg against Tony’s. It was too much teasing. Not that he didn’t like it but he didn’t want to be rude or distracted from the others. As inconspicuous as possible, Tony got up to give Steve a second serving, giving him a minute without that unbearable heat. When he sat down Steve made everything worse by putting his hand on Tony’s thigh, very far up and giving it a squeeze.
He looked around the room, feeling a stinging pain behind his eyes. The room was dark and for the moment he was grateful because of the pounding he felt in his skull but he knew that darkness was intentional. He wondered if he was somewhere surrounded by other buildings that blocked out the light because he could see a tiny barred window at the very top of the back wall with very little light coming through.
“I’ll explain later.”
James pushed his hair back out of his face and sheathed his knife; Steve holstered his gun. They made a beeline for the hallway where they assumed their guys were being kept in one of the rooms. They weren’t sure where Bakuto was but they figured he wasn’t at the warehouse at night but that was alright. Their hostage hadn’t spared any information.
He took a moment to think back to waking up, noticing the curtains that weren’t open when he’d gone to sleep and then he remembered Tony’s voice. Sarah must’ve sent him up but he’d run out before Steve could get a proper look at him. Why?
“Maybe some jewelry. A solid gold watch. A ring,” Steve added, almost as an afterthought and he smiled imagining a world where he could buy Tony a ring to let everyone know whose he was.
James went to take a nap in their room, Steve headed to get changed, which left Clint, Lucky, and Tony. They moved to the kitchen where Tony started preparing a pot roast and gave Clint the easy task of chopping apples for the pie.
James said, smiling now. Sarah’s cooking was always a reason to be excited.
While Sarah and Benni prepared everyone’s plates, Steve lifted his arm to rest on the back of Tony’s seat, his fingers wandering lightly up his back and scratching gently at the soft baby hairs at the nape of his neck. His hand then rested on Tony’s shoulder, his thumb still caressing the back of his neck because he needed and wanted the touch as much as Tony did.
“It’s nice seeing you again. You make this big house feel full even when it’s just me and you. And with the boys, it’s lovely, but without you it still felt empty,” she said softly.
“Why so mysterious?”
“He sure did. And you know what? I felt proud?”
He was so focused that he didn’t hear Sarah coming down with Benni to get him ready for school.
He missed their home. Steve’s was alright but damn he missed their home. He missed the easiness of it and not having to think before he did something or went into a room. He missed—
Penultimate chapter, folks. And this one’s all Stony. Enjoy! (Next and final one’s all winterhawk)
favorite dessert?” Steve asked, whispering it quietly in Tony’s ear before pressing another kiss just below his earlobe.
Benni reached his hand out and led Tony to the car, staying close to his brother the whole ride until they were back and Tony was on the couch. Sarah didn’t like him in his street clothes in his clean bed. She covered Tony up.
Steve took out his checkbook and wrote off the price that Monet told him, handing it to her without a second thought. While she got everything ready, he went over to James.
“We refueled and Cap’s…” Sam hesitated, looking at Steve.
” He repeated in Italian.
“You and I both know that honor belongs to the
He trailed off and James waited, holding his breath, for a solid minute to see if he would say more. Clint was asleep, snoring now, and James released the breath, feeling cold all over. Clint thought he was going to die. Did he think James had given up on him? Or traded him for what Bakuto wanted?
“I can give you a key. And it goes without saying that you’re also welcome to just stay there while we’re away. If you’d like.”
“No, I will always need my big brother.” Benni insisted. “Will you read to me?”
“And how did you pay off your gambling debts?”
Tony looked at him and furrowed his brows and asked “Second big brother? Who’s that?”
They headed to Clint’s room and as soon as he was close enough to him, he took Clint’s hand. “If I didn’t hate hospitals so much I’d stay to keep you company.”
“How are you now?”
“Cross my heart,” Tony said, doing the motion as he spoke.
“Whatever it is that you’re going through, you don’t have to do it alone, you know.” Tony said, his voice deep and low but sincere.
He took the stairs two at a time, his heart racing and palms sweating. James couldn’t remember ever having been this nervous in his entire life but he knew a lot was at stake here. He pushed Steve’s door open to see him stood at the shelves where he kept his pictures and books, searching for the photo album in question. Steve turned briefly.
He turned to look at Tony, frowning at how little space he now had on the couch because of Steve’s presence. “Here, stretch out,” he told him, putting a cushion on his lap for Tony’s feet. “Really, I don’t mind. I’d tell ya if I did.”
These meetings used to excite him but now he found them tedious and unnecessary. He didn’t care to know what the others were doing so long as they stayed in their areas and did it. He didn’t care to see them either. He had cared to see James, however, and wished he had stuck around for even a minute longer so Steve could talk to him.
James said, looking for Clint while Dmitri greeted Natalia.
. Everything will be taken care of.” She held his hand and gave it a small but reassuring pat. Even though she meant well, Tony felt awful and heavy. He couldn’t hold still while strangers were walking around him, touching him, turning him and measuring every inch of his body. At one point Sarah stopped them and told them to continue with Benni while she looked around with Tony. She didn’t mention how jumpy Tony was, how he couldn’t trust those people, didn’t make him feel bad for his stern and sad face. Nothing. She simply held up different undershirts to see which one might fit him and used his good arm to carry everything.
“Not right now.” He shrugged and caressed his cheek softly. “Don’t worry about me. I’m helping around.”
Steve moved around the table and sat in the chair beside Benni, resting a hand on his head and ruffling his hair playfully. “Does Miss Monaghan ever call on those kids?” Benni shook his head no. “Do those kids ever raise their hands?” Again, he shook his head no. “Well, then, lad, don’t bother with ‘em. They’re just jealous because
“Anyway, you two apologize for embarrassing my f—my, um, my Sam,” Bucky finished, clearing his throat. Sam lifted his head, despite his embarrassment, to give Bucky a weird look but he wouldn’t meet his eyes.
Steve pulled back, staring in Tony’s eyes, still swaying. He smiled, staring at Tony’s lips for much longer than he should’ve. He ducked his head slightly as if to kiss him, so close, just one kiss. Maybe he could play it off like an accident.
did that mean? Steve’s heart rate was picking up again and he knew better than to get his hopes up over some ill-phrased sentence. He took a deep breath and cleared his throat, looking up to meet Tony’s eyes.
Sarah sat the food down and then turned to give Clint a look that made him laugh. “You call me that one more time and this’ll be the last meal ya get from me, lad.”
were.
“Then talk to Mr Rogers. I’m sure he’ll help you. He helped before,” Pepper said and reached out to touch Tony but he moved away so she couldn’t.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and almost fell asleep right then and there. “Wait. Clint, do you need anything?” Everything in him demanded warmth and rest but at the same time he couldn’t just leave Clint there.
“You didn’t do anything,” Steve heard Clint say on the other end of the line and laughed.
“Fix up the joe?” he asked Pepper and she was right on it. “I’ll be just another few minutes. I’m sorry, sir.” He looked to the other two apologetically and went back to fix the sandwiches. To his surprise, Dugan and Jones sat at the other table and Mr Rogers was on his own. He was served first of course and then the other two.
The rest of the drive they spent chatting and sightseeing. Tony would point to something and Steve would do his best to explain what it was or where they were. They turned the radio on for a little while and hummed along to the few tunes they knew and before they knew it, they had arrived.
He listened for someone—anyone—and headed towards the heavy breathing he could hear coming from upstairs. He rounded the corner into a room and stopped dead. Tony was on the bed, beaten black and blue, and Steve was so angry he almost didn’t register the scene in front of him.
“Why?”
“It’s not but you’ll always come first,” he reassured him. “A lot, so much. So many places and foods for you to try. But first, I’m going to find you that ring.”
“I don’t want to bother him on his holiday. He deserves peace,” Clint had said and as much as James agreed, Clint deserved peace too. But he didn’t press. He just suggested something else that Clint turned down but at least he didn’t seem as irritated about it.
Steve kissed him, reaching up to wipe a thumb underneath each eye. “Oh no, love, don’t cry,” he said gently, not understanding what he did but it didn’t matter. If it made Tony cry, it was wrong. “I made improvements, sure. At ma’s request,” he admitted. “She helped me. James helped me. I’m helping you and there’s nothing wrong with that and it doesn’t make you any less of a person or someone worth lovin’. I should know.” He smiled at him and said, “I can’t imagine ever lovin’ you less but everyday I love you a little bit more.” He tilted his head up and kissed him and it was passionate and full of love and like last night’s kisses, speaking for him instead of words.
How did he explain that it wasn’t a matter of having nothing to do but doing nothing of importance?
“Good, good,” he said, nodding. “A whiskey would be nice but I’ve the feeling that request would be denied. I’m good, lad, cheers. And again, how are you?”
“What did you say?” He handed him the phone and Rhodey sighed again, giving Tony one of his signature ‘really?’ looks. “Do you think you should maybe say more? Maybe even your name since he didn’t take your number?”
Steve looked over at James, raising his eyebrows and James nodded, understanding.
. He would talk to him. He wouldn’t push any personal agenda, just… talk. “I remember reading it when I was Benni’s age. Always liked it.”
In Tony’s room, Dugan was bringing in a tray of breakfast foods for Tony and Steve. Steve thanked him, shifting carefully but it woke up Tony.
“And about—”
“Sounds grand,” Steve added, finishing his second plate. He leaned back, satisfied and unconsciously reached out to rest an arm on the back of Tony’s chair. “What did you have in mind?”
“I can’t even begin to imagine. Steve has spoiled me in so many ways. I got carried away and too used to being safe because of him.” He reached up to wrap his hand around the dog tags only to find nothing there again. Out of frustration and hunger he couldn’t think of anything else to ask or say. His face felt sore and he just knew he had a black eye now.
.” She shrugged. “Now? Now he’s got stability and is therefore in a position to provide it.”
Steve sighed. James’ hand moved up to rest on his head, tilting it up so he’d have to look at him.
Tony pushed himself up to look at Steve. When that didn’t seem enough he sat up and crossed his legs underneath him. “I’m never doing that again. We talked about this! I’m not going to leave you alone. Lock me in here but don’t ask me to do that again. One phone call a day isn’t enough! Send your ma and Benni away, but not me!” His voice was shaking again, now out of desperation and anxiety.
Thankfully his door at the end of the hall was open so he pushed it open with his back and then shut it behind him, locking it, holding Tony to him.
Steve had told Tony that he had something that needed taking care of and he’d be back at the office sooner or later that day. Even though he left with his usual men who would protect Steve at all cost, Tony couldn’t shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen.
He got up again to make coffee for himself and Clint. The smell of it filled the kitchen and mixed together with the smell of cinnamon, apples, and the meat and vegetables cooking. It was warm and comfortable, what else did one need?
“My name is Tony.”
Or maybe he really wasn’t.
“You know, I really wanted to go on vacation with Steve somewhere far away one day. It’s a shame we didn’t do it when we could have.”
Steve stared into Tony’s eyes, searching, trying to understand what was going on in his head. “Don’t leave.”
. Are you guys done talking?” Tony asked, clearing his throat because his voice was still thick from sleep. He leaned into Steve’s touch, looking at him with all the love he felt. When James spoke he looked at him, still smiling. “Force of habit,” Tony answered, feeling bad that James thanked him for something he didn’t do on purpose.
“I’ll see her out.”
James sighed softly. “We were never staunchly orthodox but… a synagogue was the first thing my parents looked for when we came to America. We observed Shabbat every week. It’s just—”
“Mr Rogers said he’s gonna be here? I don’t know what to do about the order Dugan placed.” Pepper chuckled and gently pushed him towards the kitchen and told him to go for it. She didn’t react to Tony’s flinching and gently patted his cheek.
be repercussions.”
“Let him come home first,” Sarah said and put her cup down with a smile. “There’s plenty of food ready for you.” Tony moved to stand behind the couch to calm his fast beating heart and his treacherous body that was way too sensitive when it came to Steve.
“I am,” he reassured him, giving Tony’s hand a squeeze.
James smiled, locking eyes with a waiter as he came out of the kitchen. The young man hurried over.
“What about me?”
On the way to the kitchen, he could already smell apple and cinnamon which only intensified the closer they got.
Steve gave him a sad look, a tilted head and worried eyes, but then it was followed by a small smile. “I’m glad you came to me. It’s a relief knowing you’ll talk to me when you really need to.”
Steve’s eyebrows pulled together and he knew that his face had reacted faster than his brain could catch up. How could he ever feel bothered by Tony seeking him out to talk to him? If anything, he felt privileged. So he ran with it, hoping Tony wouldn’t read too much into his words.
Steve was almost completely out when he reached out and found Tony’s other hand, resting his on top of it and then he was out, snoring lightly.
“What the actual fuck, Rhodes?”
“Uh-huh.”
“Nothing to apologize for. I’m no stranger to sibling spats. I’m a baby brother,” Clint said, even though he and Barney had a very different relationship to Tony and Benni. It hadn’t always been bad, it just ended that way. “Most important thing here is that Benni likes Lucky, so that’s one worry I can throw away.”
James and Steve had each taken some time apart when they received the photos yesterday. Clear-headed and somewhat calmed, they had rejoined the group that afternoon. Steve’s knuckles were scraped and bruised and he had snapped at Sarah when she insisted he clean and bandage them. This one time she had left him alone, understanding that the last thing he needed was his mother nagging him.
“Can we go to the movies? I’ve never been before.” Benni looked around and everyone agreed. Steve wiped his mouth on a napkin and got up.
By the time dessert rolled around, they were all sitting around the table with half-finished apple pie slices from earlier chatting.
James’ eyes slid to Tony when he spoke, and he raised an eyebrow. He’d never really interacted with him so this made for a wonderful first impression. He chuckled.
“How bad is it?”
“I think so.”
best friend’s job?”
Upstairs, Steve was brushing his teeth, watching Tony beside him doing the same. The alcohol had completely worn off and now he was full and exhausted. It had been a mentally and emotionally draining day and he just wanted to curl up beside Tony, press his face against his chest, and slip away into unconsciousness.
Steve helped Tony back into the bed, happy that the visit seemed to have done him some good. “I did. Smart move, love,” he told him, pressing another kiss to his forehead. “You want them now?”
Steve pressed himself into the recess created by a back door, hidden in the shadows despite his large frame. The kid poked his head around the corner and then further when he saw nothing. Steve drew his gun. Three shots to the chest and he hit the ground, his own gun skittering across the sidewalk.
“Hot damn.” James laughed. “It’s terrible that you’re scared and all but this is really exciting. Will you need me to wrap my big strong arms around you? Because I can do that, no problem.”
“I’m thinking chocolate lava cake, you?” Tony said from behind his menu.
“Nothing to thank me for, Steve. Just have Sarah stop calling me Jimmy.” Steve was not in the mood for jokes so he nodded and stayed by Tony’s side, using the handkerchief in his pocket to clean away some of the blood. He barely recognized him.
Once the other two had left the room, Dmitri closed the door and came over to sit in front of James.
“I’m guessing that was Stark’s son,” Dugan said knowingly.
“No, don’t go! Please!” Tony reached out to take Steve’s hand and clung to it. The thought of not having Steve around him was scary. Or did he
James didn’t add anything, sensing that what Clint needed right now was just to talk and for James to listen. And slowly, Clint did talk, opening up for the first time with James about the day he and Tony were taken. About those first few hours after he woke up, the things that went through his mind and how he felt. He talked until his voice sounded hoarse which was probably also due to the crying beforehand and when he stopped, he had told James all about the first few days in captivity when he was alone.
It had hurt him to realize that his intentions, his motives, weren’t clear. That Tony thought he wanted something from him when really he wanted something
“N-no,” Howard finally answered, looking at Steve.
“There ya go!” Bucky cheered, reaching over to slap Steve’s arm. “So?”
“Yes,” Steve answered without hesitation. “His family all fell ill, didn’t make it. Except for his younger brother but he’s got school to finish before he can go traveling.”
“You’ve known them a while?”
Steve watched him. A part of him felt bad and another part had to bite back a smile at his frustrated and dramatic little fella.
“Food. Clint, they brought food.”
“I love you. Thanks for the coffee. Need or want anything from the city?” he asked, his fingers scratching lightly at the back of Tony’s neck, moving up into his soft baby hair and back down.
“Steve.”
“Do I need to be jealous?”
It was absolutely unreal to Tony that he had killed Howard. He knew he had practiced shooting, he knew Steve and James had been keeping him alive for this, he knew he had spoken to him. He had seen the blood, heard the gunshot, felt the recoil, smelled the gunpowder. It was over. And yet…
“Do you want to hear my life’s story and how I realized my feelings for Steve so you can be sure that I mean it and that I’m not just using him? For whatever reason that would be.”
Steve blew out a deep breath, his heart slowing but only a little. “Alright,” he said, taking in the information. “Everyone still okay? Dugan? Jones?”
“He did,” he said with a smile. If Steve hadn’t kissed him they would still be pining after each other, that much was clear.
“All done?” she asked.
“You have a bite mark on your collarbone.” Rhodey’s nose scrunched as a very brief mental image of his Captain and Tony together flashed across his mind.
. Tony thought of him as being treasure. “I love it.” He stroked his fingers lightly up and down Tony’s back as he spoke, a little nervous. “
This last week, ever since Tony and Steve had left, his mood had been on a gradual decline and nothing James had done yet had helped. He had offered for Clint to call Tony but Clint had shaken his head and seemed almost annoyed that James would suggest it.
He backed them into the wall in the hallway and his hands dropped from Tony’s face to his body. Steve’s hands held Tony’s waist and he was desperate for more of him but he knew he was already pushing it.
He came around the corner and the kitchen came into view. Tony was at the table beside Clint, chatting and showing Clint some spices. Clint must have asked about Italian food. Benni was still playing with Lucky, trying to teach him a new trick it seemed.
“Because he lets me know if he thinks I should know. I don’t ask, I don’t question. He said he had business to take care of.”
“I know, I know. I may be joking and carrying on right now but don’t let it fool you. I’m serious as a heart attack. Only reason I’m making it into a joke is to underline to you just how hilariously wrong you are.”
Natalia chuckled softly, resting her head on Clint’s shoulder again. “You’re my family too,” she said quietly.
Steve came out of the room, fastening his belt buckle, flushed but smirking. Dugan was sat not too far away reading a paper and he looked up, jerking his chin up as if to ask ‘and?’ Steve made a face that said all and Dugan chuckled, shaking his head. Steve’s partner couldn’t leave the bed just yet.
“And this wasn’t information you thought should be shared with me? Do you not see how this affects me?”
have time for this and Steve should’ve picked up on that.
“You’ve been warned. Don’t hurt him. He’s had enough of that for one lifetime.”
Dugan turned to Tony. “Want some of this? I can’t imagine you’ve eaten since hearing the news.”
“Seems like you didn’t come over with good news there, pal,” Steve told him, searching his face. James’ eyes slid to Dugan who wanted to step away but controlled himself. Steve followed his eyes and said, “I trust him. What’s the story?”
Clint was at the bar. James was impressed by how quickly and easily he had gone back there and fallen into his familiar work pattern. He didn’t work quite as long as he used to, giving Phil more responsibility, but he was there in the morning and left in the early afternoon most days.
“Why that one?” Steve asked, picking up one of the documents from Gao.
“I hate it,” James admitted, hoping to kill two birds with one stone—distract Clint from having any flashbacks and get him away from snooping about their holiday.
“I think it’s time to let you go, little man.” Dugan smiled and together Benni and Tony left and headed back to the house.
Tony immediately thought of ten different occasions when he was hurt all over, tired, and hungry and still had to do everything around the house and the deli. What difference did a few cuts make? He could feel how bitter those thoughts made him.
Clint watched Benni come into the room without bothering to speak to his brother. He knew that look, he’d worn that same expression plenty of time after a telling off from Barney.
“So I bought Clint a present,” James began. The last time he and Natasha had spoken about Clint had been about two weeks ago at his bar. He’d ask her how he was and her assessment was positive. He had been on a slow but steady decline since. “And I’d like to get your opinion on it.”
With a blanket around his shoulders he sat on the couch, staring at the flames and listening to the crackling of the wood and the soft noises the flames made.
Right now, Clint was still in the numb, mute stage so James continued to fill the silence with whatever he could, even at one point talking about an article he’d read in the paper that morning about President Truman.
“I don’t see how it matters who you’re with, as long as everyone is happy,” he said more openly. “I’m just sorry they had to sneak around because of Benni and me.” He wanted Steve safe and sound as much as Sarah, that was for sure. “Since Steve never said anything I’m not going to ask him either. They shouldn’t be taking any risks though. So if they need time alone, just tell me and we’ll be out of their hair for as long as they need.”
Natalia raised one perfect eyebrow, her lips quirking up into a tiny smile.
?” he asked lovingly.
that Clint hurt so bad and James couldn’t actually stop it or fix it. He hated that anything or anyone had ever made Clint hurt like this; he hated that something was currently making him hurt. James almost felt sick with how angry he was and he wished he could kill Bakuto all over again. Make it even slower, even more painful.
To arrive and see Clint sitting there on the couch, struggling to catch his breath and red in the face stabbed James to his heart. He needed to do more for Clint.
Steve leaned all the way back, letting his head fall as he stared at the intricate ceiling. All his efforts were only making things worse as far as he could tell. Perhaps it was time to stop.
“Do you want me to get Steve?” James asked softly. “Or Clint?”
A month went by and Tony was back to taking each day as it came, facing it with less and less strength. The medicine Mr Rogers—Steve—had given him had helped a lot with the blisters and wounds, as well as any new wounds that were inflicted upon him. With Howard drinking more and more Tony had to use the saved and stolen money to pay for necessities and with each dollar he took, his heart broke a little more. Every dollar less was slimming his chances of ever getting away from Howard, from this life.
“Yeah, actually,” Steve said, his hands resting on Tony’s thighs. “It’s a serial arsonist we’ve been after for a few years and a recent fire matches his style. We think he’s going to hit another place here in Brooklyn soon.”
It took him a moment to realize that nothing was happening and that it was Steve there with him. “Did something happen?” Tony asked, his voice still raspy from sleeping. “You okay?”
“How can I—” Steve began, turning when he heard footsteps to see Tony passing by, his hands bloodied. “Tony, what the—Clint, I—”
“Maybe we should start with dinner and see how that goes first.”
“He’s right. Ma’s making something delicious. Hey,” he added as an afterthought, his eyes roving over Tony, “you feeling up to a tour? The kitchen is downstairs. That way I can help you down anyway.”
“Tell you what.” Tony leaned in to whisper in Steve’s ear with a seductive voice. “As soon as we’re home again, I’ll do
“Well, you know my ma,” Steve said fondly and Pinky’s answering smile was just as fond.
“Edward, I’m hungry!” The man barked and staggered into the kitchen, nearly missing the chair as he sat down.
Once Steve was in the bathroom, Tony headed downstairs and helped set the table. He talked with Benni and Sarah but his focus was on Steve. Especially when he saw him tired and damp-haired standing there.
“Tell us where they are or I’m going to slide these one by one under your fingernails,” James said, his tone still incredibly casual. “I’ll give you one chance before I insert the first one.” He grabbed the man’s hand despite him trying to wriggle away and lined up the needle with his index finger. “You have ten seconds. Where are they?”
Clint knew in that moment that he owed it to James to share. James never pressed, he never nagged, he never got frustrated with Clint for being so emotionally constipated. He was always patient, gentle, and kind and, really, Clint knew Winter and James were not one and the same but to see just how different his version of James was even from the version he gave to Steve or Natalia only motivated him more.
“What’s going on, love?” As much as he wanted to sleep, he knew it would be a while. Something was bothering Tony and Steve wouldn’t be able to rest until he knew what it was.
about the books since I came back.” He lowered his voice even more.
“Where’s your room?” he asked. Tony pointed and Steve scooped him up as if he weighed nothing and carried him there
.” Steve thought about it for a long second and then nodded. It was true. He’d follow James anywhere just like he did when they were kids and James protected him from bullies. Being three years older than him and much bigger, he was a welcome ally and had taken pity on the small kindergartener getting pushed into a bush.
Steve gasped, clapping a hand to his chest and glancing over at James where he sat at his desk, a smile on his lips. “You’re an asshole, James.”
Tony accepted the hot dog and looked at Steve. “Can’t wait to get out of here,” he admitted and got up slowly. His movements were stiffer than ever.
“Because of who I am... because I wouldn’t even be here without you...”
“His son,” was all Steve said and James nodded. He wasn’t sure which of the reasons Steve had just thought of was making James nod but so long as he didn’t need to go into more detail, he was fine.
“Was I out long?”
If he asked, he’d tell him the meaning—the thought alone making Tony blush—but it was probably clear.
“It has my blessin’, dear boy,” she said, her hand moving to his cheek. “Only thing I ask is you keep it down or use one of the guest rooms on the other side of the hall.” Steve couldn’t help but grin, still blushing. “Has he always been…?” She didn’t know how to phrase it and they’d never really come up with a term. Most of the commonly used ones were derogatory so they avoided them.
know what I’m planning. About everything but this holiday, that is. I know how you hate change. I wouldn’t just move us without telling you far in advance and without cause,” Steve said simply, cutting the cake as evenly as possible. “No. It’s just sitting at the moment. Is there something you want me to do with it?”
“So, since nothing is on fire. I’m guessing… hot date?” Bruce grinned.
Someone left a can of propane for their restaurant in direct sunlight, someone’s delivery van overheated, someone’s baby was in a parked car. The list went on and on. There was no such thing as a restful season for them but some seasons were definitely worse than others.
“Welcome home,” Tony greeted his brother and helped Sarah unpack everything. “Anything I can help with?” He didn’t know what to say to James. Steve told him things about him and Tony didn’t even know if he should know. He probably wanted to talk to his best friend anyway.
When he was sure Tony was gone and wouldn’t be back for a moment, he opened his drawer and pulled out one of the letters, reading over it. He felt the slightest twinge of fear and then he pulled out a box of matches and burned it, holding it in his hand until only a corner remained and he blew it out, tossing it into the trash.
Clint didn’t turn, sure that it was Natalia or Dmitri and he just wasn’t in the mood for company but with them he knew they would understand that he still appreciated their presence.
Their luggage was loaded onto the ship and they took with them their carry-on items, Steve carrying both and Tony holding onto their tickets. He gave them to the man who requested them and they made their way to their room.
“That’s difficult for me to believe since you’ve been nothing but.” With the light coming from behind him Tony couldn’t really see Steve’s face but he didn’t want to turn on the light either. “Not talkative. Now that’s something I’d believe,” he said with a soft smile, now fully awake.
“Maybe.”
They took the stairs in pairs, Steve and James in front, Dugan and Dmitri behind. Once inside they made quick, silent work of the few men, picking them off one by one.
None. They had no more options.
“I love you two,” she said as they took the last step onto the landing. She looked up at Steve and then up at James. “I know it’s been hard.” Steve’s gaze fell and James swallowed. “But soon you’ll have ‘em back. And despite what you two might be thinking, they’re lucky to have you.”
“Just trying to provide, huh?”
like that I’m your first. And hopefully your only. Relationship-wise, bedroom-wise…” he trailed off, a subtle blush creeping onto his cheeks. “There’s nothing about you I would change. Does it bother you that I’m older?”
“Well, your math whiz isn’t here to check my calculations but I wouldn’t say it’s complete shit,” James said and Steve gave him an unimpressed look. “Look, we have four potential buildings within this area and one just on the outskirts. These others would take at least another thirty minutes to reach.”
“We should definitely have breakfast,” Clint said.
Steve nodded thoughtfully. “You don’t. Stay with me. Benni’s happy, no point in uprooting the wee lad again. I can send some fellas to get your things.” He leaned back, arms crossed over his chest, watching Tony’s expression and trying not to think about himself saying
James nodded in return. “It has been nice. A better turnout than I had expected.”
Tony kept his arms around Steve, wanting him close. “Like the best little brother in the world,” he said with a smile. “He thinks kissing is disgusting though.”
“I’d like you to eat something first. Would you want to try to wash up a little? There’s only so much you can do but it might make you feel better,” James asked.
“What? What is it?”
“I can’t be in love. That’s it.”
“You. Before Tony came into your life in the manner he is now, I knew there were still feelings in ya for James. That you still held out hope.”
Natalia reached for it and James rested it in her open palms. She turned it over in her hands and then wrapped her hand around the handle and gently pulled it out. It was beautiful. Bright, shiny silver with very subtly serrated edges for maximum damage.
He waited outside until it was almost seven and one of the people at the door approached and asked about his party.
“Jimmy?” Tony repeated, absolutely confused. Where did that come from? What was that supposed to mean? He didn’t know a Jimmy. He knew a James. Did he mean him? “And the magic coffee maker does the rest?” he tried, hesitating and still careful. As if he had anything that could protect him.
“To talk. Also I have a request.”
Steve nodded to Clint, jogging out of the room to find Tony as James dropped down beside Clint, checking his leg. He looked up at Clint who was biting down on the inside of his cheek.
“Yes. A lot.”
James is gone. Steve plays the piano. Tony hears the music. Even mob bosses need hugs. Pepper teaches Tony some life truths.
“Aw,” Clint teased, “you kinda like me, huh?” He gave Tony’s hand a quick squeeze for both of their sakes. It was already strange not seeing Tony at all hours of the day but now he would be miles away and he wouldn’t even be able to see him a few times a day.
“What do you want to call me, pet?” She asked with a smile and wrapped an apron around him to keep his clothes clean while helping out. When he didn’t reply she looked at him while the sink filled with water. “Why don’t you call me Aintín for now, hm?”
He turned his head to see his sleeping fella beside him, cradled in his arm, his face pressed into Steve’s side as he continued to sleep. Steve was determined not to move so he could bask in this moment a while longer.
When Tony woke up he found it difficult to move from an unusual weight on his chest. Usually he would move around in his sleep, if he was able to sleep through the night without waking up at least once or twice, but after last night he had been able to sleep through the night and without moving even a little. He rested one hand on Steve’s back, feeling his heartbeat against his palm and the other combed through Steve’s soft blond hair.
that he’s really good and wants everyone to know.” He took another sip of coffee. “Which, you know, would be fine if in doing so he didn’t explain basic car parts to me like I have tires for brains.” He scoffed. “Jackass mansplained an alternator to me the other day.”
Steve nodded, exhaling shakily for the fourth time that evening. “Yes, okay. Yes.” Steve pulled Tony closer by the hand he was holding and kissed him roughly. “Thank you,” he said, leaning their foreheads together.
The car was outside when they stepped out and it was nice and warm inside. Sarah told the driver where she wanted to go and he took them there. It was in a corner of Brooklyn Tony had never been to before. They stopped in front of a menswear store and Sarah told the driver to make himself comfortable.
Natalia said.
James took the folder, not opening it yet. “I agree.”
small, aren’t they?”
When they reached the hospital the hallways had been cleared for their arrival and a gurney was ready for Steve out front. He was admitted for the second time in what was too few weeks, and rolled inside. James walked at the head of the gurney, pushing it and snapping at anyone who tried to offer to do it instead.
“You don’t need to apologize. I can buy ma ten more cups and she’ll never notice one missing. Not that she cares anyway, I’m sure.” He moved closer. “And I’m sure they
“I’m Jewish,” he repeated simply. Clint let go of his hand to push himself up into a sitting position so he could better stare at James in shock.
Clint grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him forward, sliding himself to the side and forcing the man’s face into the hard wall behind him. He slipped his hand around while the guard was trying to push his face off the wall and snatched the keys, slipping them into his pocket (hopefully) quietly.
Three days he got lucky having Pepper to work with even though she complained jokingly about the amount of work. Despite what his freedom during the day meant for his nights, Tony considered himself lucky.
“I’m right here and you know it,” he said comfortingly because he knew where that fear came from. How many times had Tony turned down Benni and spending time with him over wounds that he needed to take care of? Or errands he had to run? Clothes to stitch up? “Nothing happened to me and nothing will happen to you either,” he promised his little brother, still hugging him tightly.
Hope you enjoyed it!
He couldn’t say how much time had passed—he had left his watch on his desk at the office—but finally the door opened and a nurse came in, telling them a doctor would be with them shortly. Barely seconds after the nurse had left, a man, putting his white coat on, came into the room.
“Just really tired,” he admitted and she leaned in to give him a kiss on his forehead.
Clint helped. Clint helped when Steve couldn’t or wasn’t available and he should be
James plopped down beside him, taking the seat that was previously Tony’s after he too had greeted Sarah, and Benni properly.
James put a hand on Clint’s arm and raised an eyebrow questioningly. Clint signed to him that he just wanted to be sure first. Tony wouldn’t be leaving his home, not giving up too much more than his space and even then not really because James would keep to himself and Clint would only go where invited.
“And if you don’t eat those,” Sarah mock-threatened, “I’ll just have to give you all another fresh batch.”
James smiled, still surprised when Clint so easily got on board with his job and all its requirements. He looked over at Natalia and Maria but they were having their own conversation and he suspected they would not care much either.
“Right in front of you is dinner,” Tony answered without looking at him. “And you’ve still got enough to drink in that bottle.” He scoffed and looked at the water that was obviously now hot enough to do the dishes with.
Steve hopped gracefully over the ropes and landed on the ground, coming towards Tony. Dugan left and took Falsworth with him, leaving the gym empty besides the two of them. Steve looked him over, this time not hesitating to touch him but with extremely gentle fingers, avoiding his arm in its entirety.
Based on where they took him after dragging him out the back door, he would say they were headed up Madison Avenue. It felt like ten blocks? Maybe even fifteen, so they were still in Manhattan when they took a right. They definitely stopped at each light after that, putting them on Second Avenue and that’s where things got fuzzy. Clint knew Manhattan like the back of his hand. He was starting to get to know Brooklyn fairly well. Well, south Brooklyn where James and he lived but if he was right, and this was one of those times when he wished he weren’t, they were on the Queensboro bridge heading into a borough Clint knew next to nothing about—Queens.
Pepper with her strawberry milkshake and Tony with his black coffee sat next to each other in a booth at a nearby diner and he stared into the dark liquid in his cup.
“Where is
“Go in and see what the hold up is.”
Steve copied, liking how that sounded. “I’m starting to get a vague idea that you like me.” He was grinning now, chuckling against Tony’s chest. “
