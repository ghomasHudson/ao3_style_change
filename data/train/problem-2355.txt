“Um, Dean?” Charlie ventured.  “You really need to consider what everyone’s saying.  I mean, what if our positions were reversed?  I know you trust me, sure, but if I was the one sitting here at this table, and I was telling you this story, what would you think?  You’d have to wonder, after I’d spent all those weeks and the way this guy just suddenly decided to join up out of the blue, what’s in it for him.”
“Yes, but we knew it had to be somewhere in my section, so you weren’t angry. You actually never asked about it.”
“Fine!” Gabriel snapped.  “You and Raph hang out and wait for the final confirmation that it was the Huis rebels, which we all already know.  Meanwhile, Luc and I will take Cas to see his bodyguard.  Come see us when you get your results.  We can make that vote right there in Dean’s hospital room.”
He opened his eyes, blinking in the light.  The ceiling was definitely not that of the bunker.  The beeping sound, he realized, was a monitor, measuring his heartbeat.  Dean tried to raise his arm and found he couldn’t.  Something caught his wrist.  Trying to lift the other arm produced the same result.  He looked down and saw cloth restraints had been fastened around both of his wrists, trapping his arms at his sides.  Panic rising, he frantically looked around.
Bobby turned, staring wide-eyed at the angel.  “How did...?  I thought you said an angel couldn’t take a vessel once it got knocked out of it!”
At least I was able to help out a bit.  I put on my sunglasses and took a peek at how the card readers worked.  Then I took Bobby’s plastic card, linked up through my fingertips with the chip imbedded in the end of it, and altered it.  It was ridiculously easy.  Bobby didn’t seem to understand what I’d done, and I didn’t feel the need to tell him, but his card now looped right back to the credit company, dutifully paying for everything without actually putting any charges on Bobby’s account. Sure, it was probably not legal, ethical, or moral, but personally I didn’t give a shit.  Someone like Bobby was worth more than money anyway.
“I can’t promise that,” the angel growled.  “It’s my mission to bring you to Heaven to become Michael’s vessel!”
Dink and Fop were sitting in the living room, trying to look important.  Both were frowning in disapproval when Dean came in.  He smiled.  “Hi.”
“Hold on!”  Gabriel quickly moved to block Dean’s exit.  “To anyone but you, it’s a mildly interesting conversation piece. So I guess for you I should make a special exception and not charge you too much for it.”
Fuck.  Dean didn’t have to turn to know whose powerful hand had just landed on his arm.  His heart sank.  “Fancy meeting you here,” he grumbled.
That made Chuck smile.  “I suppose not.  Alright!”  He clapped his hands.  “It’s all settled, then.  Off to bed, and tomorrow’s another day.”
Dean’s hand shook as he poured a drink.  He fought to control his breathing.  A 30% increase?  That meant more people sent to the camps, where the death rate was nearly three people every two weeks.  An increase in the rate of convictions.  How many of those people would be as innocent as he knew Sam had been?  How many people would be sent out to die whose only real crime was being poor, living on the outskirts?  Already, Dean knew the poorest sections of the outskirts had large areas that were completely deserted.  Soon, they’d be picking off people just outside the rim.  It was where he’d been arrested, after all.
Dean didn’t know what to say.  Cass rubbed at his eyes and looked hopefully at him.  “Nothing else is real, but you and I?  We are real.  I can do this, as long as I have you.”  He reached out and took hold of Dean’s hand.  “Being with you anchors me the way nothing else can.  You’re the only thing that makes the voices stop, the only thing that makes sense.  If I lose you now, I’ll fall completely apart.”
“Have you ever considered tasting the food?” Cass wondered, still staring at Dean.  “Or perhaps breathing?  I have never seen anyone eat so fast!”
“No!  Your contract was sold under his name.  I thought I was buying him!  When I saw you for the first time and realized who you were, I was very surprised.”
The instant his hand touched the bottle, the silver wire securing the cork snapped like an overtightened guitar string.  The end scored a cut on his finger.  Dean yelped, stuck his finger in his mouth and sucked.  Withdrawing the finger, he glared at the little cut.  “Son of a bitch!”
“What?!” Raphael exclaimed.  “That makes no sense at all!  Any sort of deal like that would have had to come through me!  I’ll do some digging.”
The gold level angel cleared her throat.  “Now that Uriel has joined us, let’s get started.  Balthazar, please have her brought in?”
Dean twisted his neck to see.  He blinked in surprise at the sight of the blinking black pyramid.  “Holy...!  Wait, you keep it in your bedroom?”
Dean scoffed.  “No shit!  This is crazy. Bad enough the angels want me, but now the fucking demons...?”
That had won him five minutes of blessed silence from his new companion.  Dean had just started to relax when Angel announced, “There is an article here about you.”
Dean rolled his eyes.  “You were saying something about your secret underground angel boy’s club, and how I was somehow a threat to it?”
“I heard.”  Lucifer tutted sympathetically.  “Wiped out your base and snatched his vessel back.  Pity, really, but honestly?  What did you think you could achieve by stealing that vessel?  You must have had to chain it to the wall to keep it from running to its precious archangel!”
“No, Michael!  Angeli Quinque hired me to do a job.  Let me do my job!  Castiel got hurt in more than just the physical sense.  To be fair, Lucifer was just the last straw.  This has been building up for a long time, alright? Castiel has been complaining of headaches, he’s been crying himself to sleep at night, he’s a wreck!  And that was even before Huis tried their shit! What he needs the most is quiet, away from the stress of Angeli Quinque and everyone constantly making demands on him, so he can recover!”
“Because my life is missing the best thing in it!”  I dared to move closer, but didn’t quite dare to touch him. “Dean, I spent my entire life learning how to be an Angel.  You taught me how to be human.  You taught me love, free will, empathy, the best parts of being a human being!  Even this!”  I pointed, indicating an angel in lights.  “Christmas.  I couldn’t stay away.  I had to take the chance and come to see you.  And you were right here, living just a few blocks from the Heaven building!”
“Because Roman wanted him,” Novak explained.  “I suspect he’d been looking for you, Sam.  From the moment he saw Dean, Roman wanted to buy his contract.  I was a fool for bringing him to the office.”
And you did all of this because the first man made some inappropriate remarks to the waitress after she scorned his advances?”
Bobby nodded towards Ketch.  “What’s going on is that Ketch here has the best plan I’ve heard yet for finally finding a way to free angel vessels.”
“I said no!”  Dean was twisting his wrist in the cuff, still staring wide-eyed at Castiel.  “There is no way in hell I am letting you put that kinky shit on me.”
“So you could go to jail, learn how to be a better criminal, and go on to commit more crimes?”  Cass shook his head.  “No, Dean.  You don’t know it.  You may not believe it.  But I’m your guardian angel.”  He leaned closer, putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder.  “You asked what I’m going to do with you?  I’m the one who’ll grip you tight and raise you from Perdition.”
“Home?”  Castiel looked hard at the other man.  “What home?  When I left my home five years ago, I was eighteen.  I had a house that I inherited from my parents, a new wife, and the promise of a new future.  But something went wrong.  I ended up a prisoner and went through sixteen months of Hell before I managed to escape.  I made it through debriefing, got discharged with commendations, but the only thing I wanted?  The only thing that kept me alive in that cage they locked me into was the thought of home, of my wife and the family we’d start, the happy future we’d have.  Imagine my surprise when I roll up to my house, only to find strangers living there and the neighbors telling me that my wife had sold my home, married another man, and was starting a family with him!”
Dean couldn’t be bothered to care about the looks Dr. Jones was giving him for holding tight to his angel’s hand.
Moving away from the car, Castiel pulled out his cell phone.  The only numbers in his contact list were his ex-wife, which he now deleted (she’d changed her number anyway), and the base.  He called the base first and told them what he’d found out about Amelia.  Unfortunately, his story wasn’t that uncommon.  In a few minutes, Castiel had a new account where all of his back pay would be sent at a bank with nationwide branches.  All he had to do was go to any branch with his military ID and they could set him up.  He’d be referred to legal, who could help him reclaim at least half of his assets.  Meanwhile, they’d send him some emergency funds.  With that settled, Castiel called 911.  He quickly explained that he was the man who had been carjacked.  The carjacker had forced him to drop him off about a mile away from the scene and had ordered Castiel to get on the freeway and keep driving.  He’d been terrified by his ordeal and had been driving for hours, just to be sure he was away.  Of course he’d be willing to come in to the closest station and make a statement.  He was on his way right now.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably.  “You’re all too aware of how corrupt the program is.  Sometimes, though?  That corruption can work to our advantage.  Sam will be safe.  You’ll both be safe.  And after five years, you’ll be free.”  Castiel raised Dean’s hand to his lips and kissed it.  “We can be together.”
Dean hadn’t said a word.  He’d come out, hastily dressed and with his hair still wet, and gone running out the door. We all split up and went racing through the woods frantically searching before one of the perimeter guards radioed that Dean had found our missing Angel.  Cas had wandered clear out to the road just inside the perimeter and had been walking on it, straight down the middle of the road, lost in his thoughts and completely oblivious to any traffic there may have been if the perimeter hadn’t been detouring it.
“Fine!  You want to know where your hub is?”  Castiel stormed towards the head of the bed.  When he reached towards Dean’s face, the laborer winced before he realized that Castiel’s hands were reaching just above his head.  Castiel slid aside a wooden panel, revealing a small, hidden cubby built into the wall.  “It’s here.”
“Um, I’m still in the room?” Charlie’s voice called.  “And just how old are you, Mr. Know-It-All?  Because this happened to me when I was two!  Think about the time frame and you’ll see it was just about the time you six were finally showing what you could do.  Everyone wanted to make more Angels, including your own board of directors. But Chuck Shurley said no!  He didn’t want Angels running around that he couldn’t control.  So they went through one of their affiliates, one that had a stellar reputation, the technology and skill to replicate Shurley’s little experiment using poor kids. Guess what, I’m the only one who survived!  And it’s a damned good thing my dad worked for Heaven’s Angels and was a blacked-out veteran, because that’s the only reason he was able to steal me back and get away!”
“Then you’re an even bigger fool than I thought.”  She looked at him with worried eyes.  One hand reached up to touch Dean’s collar.  “You can’t get away from them.  That means no matter what they do, you’re trapped here.”
“He’s right,” Uriel agreed, his voice soft.  “All he had to do was take control of Samandriel’s vessel once he was away from other angels, find Dean, and take his arm.  He could have instantly transferred into Dean at that point.  Dean wouldn’t have had so much as a chance to blink before it was over.”
Dean wasn’t sure what to expect from a lounge for executive laborers.  He’d imagined a small room with a few vinyl-covered couches, a table with women’s magazines, and a vending machine filled with bagged junk food.  Instead, he was facing a spacious room.  Comfortable chairs, sofas, and recliners were placed at various intervals, facing either the massive television screen on the wall or the windows.  The windows were floor to ceiling and covered one entire wall.  Off to the side was a door leading out to the veranda.  Picnic tables with umbrellas were visible outside, although the umbrellas had naturally all been folded closed and secured for the cold weather.
The green eyes flicked in his direction. Dean nodded, moving his hand away from his weapon.  He continued to circle away from Lucifer, but where could he go?  Outside, the shouting was louder.  Somehow, they’d managed to get through some of the security barriers. Now they were closer.  But how could they get there in time to save Dean?
Dean groaned.  “Keeping under cover is going to be hard as hell if I make the news every time someone recognizes me.”
“No, nothing’s wrong.”  Dean came a few steps closer, stopping a couple of feet from the bed.  “How’s your arm?”
That got a reaction - a raised eyebrow.  Dean suddenly remembered himself.  He looked away, focusing intently on arranging the groceries.
“A false Angel?” Raphael asked.  He was still holding Cas and looking upset.  “This is what you wanted us to see?”
By conveniently ignoring posted speed limits and the occasional stop sign I made it out to the field in record time.  By now, the sun had gone down and it was dark and cold.  I saw Lenny, standing next to his ATV parked at the side of the road.  The lights on his vehicle were directed back towards the field where a figure was approaching, stumbling through the field on foot.  Lenny had an odd look on his face, looking from me to the figure and back. “What the hell?” I called as I climbed out.  “That field’s a muddy mess!  Why didn’t you ride him out here?!”
Dean sat down in one of the antique wooden chairs in front of Crowley’s elaborate mahogany desk.  The chair creaked alarmingly under him, making Dean afraid he was about to be spilled down onto the floor.  No doubt the lawyer would then sue him for the damages.
Then there were the other signs, like the faded bruise on Dean’s cheek, or the reddened marks barely visible on Dean’s arm in the clear shape of fingerprints.  Castiel’s eyes flickered over Dean, noting the small scars that told of a rough, painful existence as much as the gauntness of his cheeks, the prominence of his ribs, shoulders, and hips.  He’d initially thought Dean was much younger than he was, but now it was clear that they weren’t that far apart in age.
“I find it hard to understand that line of reasoning,” the angel grumbled.  “I am staying with you because it is still my mission to bring you to Michael.  But I have difficulty understanding why, exactly, you wish to take me along to wherever it is we’re going.  If you are so concerned about me taking you, then why keep me with you?  Why wouldn’t you try to escape at your first opportunity?”
“I don’t know how far she’ll go, how much access she’ll give him to the company,” Sam admitted.  “But she’s already tampered with the Angels, and I believe he’s already inside with a false ID.  I can’t prove it, but someone’s inside the company pulling strings besides Naomi. And when I started poking around too much in the personnel files, that’s when I must have drawn attention to myself. Because when I started really looking into the Chimera mission files, poking my nose into classified files from the Defense section I know I shouldn’t have been accessing, I got caught quick.  I know Gabe tried to cover for me at first, but Naomi came to him as company spokesperson and said his actions to protect me violated international laws and jeopardized the company.  She said the company would cover for him, but he needed to either put me on some sort of probation and make me prove myself, or call for a vote to fire me.  So that’s where I’m at.”
“So you really are a family man now,” Ketch observed.  “If I hadn’t seen it, I wouldn’t have believed it.”
Dean nodded.  “Exactly! Samandriel works his mojo, and Gabe goes from puking his guts out to feeling down about losing his husband. Gabe, you got upset enough over Chimera that you went to Alfie about it, right?”
“I was in with Gordon, helping him work over the Trickster,” Cole added.  “The same thing happened.  A flash of light, and I woke up on the floor.  The Trickster was gone, Gordon was gone.  I had no idea what had happened until I heard Gordon.”
“Because you’re wanted for murder.”  Cass’s voice was slow and patient, as if he were explaining a difficult mathematical formula to a young, slow-learning child.  “Right now, you are the last person on Earth that any foster parent or guardian of children would want near a child.  I have to say, I’m against it myself.”
Thinking of Cass was like a blow to the stomach.  Lucifer, who had been leading Dean into his office, looked over in surprise when Dean suddenly stopped, wincing.  “You ok?”
“It looks like some targets escaped through a hidden tunnel,” the leader continued.  “The prisoner we found with Novak was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when we captured him.  Apparently, he used some sort of explosive device to get into the room, probably the grenade launcher we found in the hall.  He then remained in the room to try to revive Novak.”
He nodded.  “I’ll need to reset you by hand, Dean, so I have to do that now.  But I won’t activate Chimera until I have to, alright?”
The handlers were dragging Gabriel back, despite his resistance.  “You know you can’t get too close to him, Angel Gabriel!”
Harper was smiling his soft, obedient smile, but Dean wasn’t paying attention.  Forgetting himself, his eyes were boring into the side of Cass’s head.
Dean was kissing along his jaw, moving up it to nibble on his earlobe.  Castiel sucked in his breath.  “Oh, you bastard, this is cheating!”
Castiel flinched.  He’d never seen his bodyguard quite so upset.  The cameras and excited people that now swarmed around Castiel now no longer bothered him.  But Dean was furious.  He threw an arm protectively around Castiel and actually swung at the crowd, driving the people back.  Then he was moving, pulling Castiel away as the Angeli Quinque security team descended, forming a protective circle around the two of them.
“She gave him some mysterious mission.  He didn’t come with us.”  Uriel looked hopefully at Castiel.  “It’s true, then?  The four really exist?”
Dean got glomped by an emotional ginger the instant he appeared.  “Hi Charlie,” he squeaked through her tight grip.  “Missed me, huh?”
I wasn’t sure what I could do for Cas.  Just like he’d done in our own time, the only thing he really seemed able to focus on was work.  He spent a lot of time out in Bobby’s private garage, doing God alone knows what.  When I’d go to see him, he’d be surrounded by various bits of hardware, everything from car computers to the diamonds from his cufflinks to calculators to my disassembled cell phone to a broken laptop to Bobby’s microwave.  I’d had to apologize profusely to Bobby about that last one after I’d discovered Bobby, red-faced and silent, staring at the empty spot on his counter with a plate of food he’d obviously intended to heat up in his hand.  But while the mess in the garage continued to grow, Cas stayed withdrawn.  Mostly, he seemed lost in his thoughts.  While he was unfailingly polite, he rarely spoke to anyone.  If Bobby and I hadn’t been there, he would have neglected his personal well-being as much as he’d ever done in Angeli Quinque.
“Stop being such an idiot!” Castiel hissed.  He gave his brother a shake.  “This is important to me, Gabriel.  I swear, if you do anything to mess this up, I won’t speak to you for a week!”
Castiel did not care for the sound of that.  He frowned, seeing Dean stiffen.  “I know you want to change my bodyguard, Naomi.  But you know I don’t do well with sudden changes in my personnel!  Besides, no one else wanted to care for me!  That’s why Dean was assigned to me in the first place, remember?”
“Convincing other angels is precisely my plan.  Working together, however?”  The Trickster shook his head.  “It’s too dangerous.”
Making an Angel isn’t easy.  It’s more than just implanting a computer into someone’s head.  Mom and dad made me out of desperation, then created my brothers once they’d realized my potential.  But until we’d proven our worth, and even afterwards, our lives were shadowed by controversy.  Castiel and I had been babies and had developed fairly well.  Raphael and Gabriel had some issues, but generally did well.  Michael, who had been nearly seven years old when he became an Angel, had so little of his natural brain that he only suffered some minor issues as he developed. But Lucifer, only four months younger than Michael, had responded poorly to the implantation of his computer.  The earliest pictures of us as a family showed dad cradling my brother’s flaccid body in his arms, tubes running from Lucifer’s stomach and throat leading to the machines that fed and breathed for him. The enhancements that made Lucifer so powerful were originally developed to try to keep him alive.
“You were certainly quick to get rid of them,” Castiel retorted.  “The neighbors said you had a ‘For Sale’ sign in the yard two days after my memorial service.”  He leveled a glare at his ex-wife.  “Would you like to know what else they told me?”
“Martha, that information is being tightly controlled,” John explained.  “The witnesses we spoke to couldn’t say with any certainty as to whether or not the Senator was shot, but it does seem clear that he was the primary target of this attack.”
Castiel abruptly straightened, his breath catching.  “Your human brother was able to wrestle control of the vessel from Lucifer?”
“Damned right he doesn’t,” Bobby said.  “But you don’t deserve it, either, and neither does that brother of yours.”  He quickly finished his coffee and waved a hand over the table.  “Since you offered anyway, how about you clean up?  You any good at cooking, Dean?”
Dean gave a long-suffering sigh.  “Alright.  It stays for now, only because it’s pretty clear that you’re just way too fucked up yet to understand why what you did was wrong.  But we need to have this conversation eventually.  Alright?”
The other demon regarded the trio of angels with narrowed eyes, crossed arms, and a deep scowl of disgust.  “Look at you,” she sneered.  “Coming out here to grovel to Lucifer because Michael outsmarted you.”
Dean seemed to be about to say something.  But when he looked over again at Castiel, he paused.  Instead, he took a deep breath through his nose and let it out.  “Alright.  Fine.  I’ll let everyone think I’m your personal twink if it gets me out of the house, I guess.  But I swear, if one of those entitled bastards touches me...?”
“I’m sorry, alright?  I kind of went into shock when he first showed up out of nowhere, grabbed my arm and did his ‘Congratulations, blessed candidate’ speech.  Everyone around me started going nuts.  Wasn’t exactly time to get on a first-name basis with the fucker, alright?”
But Cas is tied up in a heated, whispered conversation with Bela. She notices Dean’s attention, and quickly shakes her head at whatever Cas is saying before standing up, brushing dust off the back of her skirt. “You kids are playing a little too clean for my tastes,” she purrs as she leaves the circle to head back upstairs, boots clicking on the concrete staircase. Cas bites his lip as he watches her go, and Dean feels something hot and painful in his chest at the concern in Cas’s eyes.
Dean pouts down at the car hood, absently wiping at his reflection with a clean rag, like it’s a spot he can get out with enough elbow grease and Windex. “I know.”
That was the one that bothered me the most.  I lay in the bed on my right side, looking into the exhausted eyes of my brother as he lay facing me.  My right hand was clutched tightly in both of his.  My left hand rested on his plate, my fingers gently stroking the golden surface.
I felt cold.  Lucifer was normally very perceptive and a fantastic judge of people. But here he was, letting Dean touch his plate, asking my brother to join the highest ranks of security, when he’d just admitted to me that he’d come in to steal Gabriel?!
I smiled and gently stroked the pads of my fingers along the engraving on his plate.  “I love you too, Castiel.”
But somehow, even as Azazel forced him into the car and drove off, Dean’s pain-numbed heart couldn’t find the will to care.
Fortunately, Dean apparently mistook his reaction for something else.  “That’s right angel,” he cooed.  “You remember, don’t you?  That first night, the way we made love?  You remember how good I made you feel, Cas, how much you loved it when I’d touch you!”
“Yeah, but I think she’ll say it’s worth it.”  Benny gestured with the spatula towards the table.  “Stow it, Winchester, this is almost done.”
As the day Sam died grows nearer, discussions center on how to save him.  Gabe finds something interesting in Castiel's memories.
“He’s lying,” the Devil called.  “He’s a spy, and he’s brainwashed your brother.  Now he’s trying to trick you!”
“Don’t worry about it,” Castiel said through clenched teeth.  “I only knew Sam for a year in school...”
“I know what you mean.”  Dean was proud that he’d managed to say that without a trace of irony.  He gave his trapped wrist a little shake, making the chain on the cuff rattle.  “Listen, I really need both hands to eat.  Do you think you can let me go?”
Had circumstances been different, the way Cass was being all dominant would have been seriously hot.  As it was, his biggest concern was that he not piss his boxers from sheer anxiety.  Here he was, in the middle of a heavily-guarded rich Senator’s house, with a guy who had somehow managed to break in without anyone the wiser.  Now that same guy was trying to break back out with Dean?  Damn!  He’d known Cass was some kind of bad-ass motherfucker, and part of a group that had been trained to bust hostages out of compounds way tougher than this house.  But Cass had been a sniper, part of an entire group of guys just as badass as he was.  Sure, Cass would have had the same kind of training as the guys who actually did the breaking in, but he certainly wasn’t specialized in it, right?  How could Cass possibly pull this off?
“What the hell?!  Dammit, your eyes, you’re near capacity!  They must have seen you from the street and made the bus stop!  I’m an idiot for not putting sunglasses on you!” Dean snarled, pushing Castiel back behind himself, and grabbed his own phone, quickly dialing up security.  “What the fuck are you lazy bastards doing?! Who let a fucking tour bus through here?!  We need an extraction, right now!”
So I think the best I’ll be able to do is remove the, um, feathers, set the bones, and do a half-assed cast of the upper surface, with some reinforcement in the plaster to support it.”
Novak groaned and buried his face in his hands.  “I only just bought that property,” he mumbled.  “I’ve had my eye on it for a while, for the reason I just told you.  But I couldn’t convince Aaron Jacobs to sell until Dean told me something that changed his mind.”
That was definitely weird.  Even as I nodded in agreement, I saw Sammy and Gabriel exchange puzzled looks.  But Raphael, Michael, and Lucifer had all taken oddly-defensive postures.  Lucifer was actually pushing me, steering me towards not Castiel, but Dean.  Dean gave a slight smile and put his arm around me, but his eyes were hard as he looked at Lucifer.  Lucifer refused to meet his eyes.  I glanced at Castiel, but he looked as confused as I felt.
Always before, the sound of Dean saying his full name had been enough to bring Cass back.  But not this time.  The eyes that turned on Dean were ice cold.  “You are in my way.”
“I said that, too.  But he is right.  That’s a decision Dean has to make.  We can probably convince him to stay away for a few days, but if he really wants to see Novak?”
Dean looked up at the mirror.  He saw his own face, pinched with fear, eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep.  “I’ve got to get out of here,” he whispered.
“Some do, yes,” Castiel admitted quietly.  “I hope you know, I won’t expect that of you.  But having an attractive laborer does give the contract owner a status boost.”
“Gee, Cass, do you think?!  How many times do I have to say it?  You own my contract.  You don’t own me.  How the hell can you try to say you care about me while you take all my choices away?”
“You’re such an ass,” Cas grumbles, but when Dean glances over, there’s a tiny, satisfied smile on Cas’s face. The sunlight pours in through the window, golden like honey, and Cas’s eyes look somehow darker, soft shadows highlighting all of his best features.
“Press the red button,” Castiel responds, slipping his phone into his back pocket as Mary sighs at him.
“Charlie?” Dean opens the door and studies her carefully, tightening his jaw. “Are you gonna hit me?”
Three, Mary tried to ground him again this morning, giving him a lecture about being a good role model for his brother, and attempting to express her own disappointment.
"Yeah? What are you up to? Is the senator still there?" A small voice pipes up in the background, interested in the senator, and Castiel smiles as Dean tells his brother to shut up and go away.
The lights go up as that weird little band exits the stage, and the roadies come in to clear their equipment. Conversation buzzes through the crowd, punctuated by the occasional scream or chant from over-excited girls. Jo and Anna have managed to befriend each other once again, chattering to themselves about set lists and stage decorations and costumes. Dean turns to Cas, about to ask if he wants to go buy a few bottles of water, when he feels his phone start vibrating in his pocket. When he pulls it out, the name on the screen makes his blood run cold.
Castiel hesitates again, but only briefly. Within a few seconds, he rights the chair, and slumps down into it, staring at Dean. “Are you going to…” His face flushes pink, and he gestures lewdly with his fingers, “Again?”
“I’m serious!” And it’s not Dean’s secret to tell, he knows that deep down, but he’s also desperate to make Lisa understand. He can’t lose her, especially not over Cas. “Charlie’s gay. A lesbian. She wanted to kiss Jo, but she wanted me to kiss Cas first so that people wouldn’t be dicks and freak Jo out.” Lisa is silent, outside of her heavy breaths, as she stares down at Dean. “That’s the gospel truth, I swear.”
Castiel doesn’t even notice that another song has started playing until Dean’s hips start moving again, a much sharper, faster rhythm. Dean steps back out of his embrace, grinning so wide that Castiel almost doesn’t notice the red on the edges of his eyes. “I love this song,” Dean says, his voice raw, and this exaggerated, silly dancing is more what Castiel expects from Dean, so he lets the sentimentality slip away. He tucks their love away, somewhere he can cherish it privately… but leave it to Dean to tear that apart, to express himself in a multitude of ways and leave every second colored by every part of his personality.
“Our fault,” Charlie chimes in, offering a sweet smile. “We would’ve sent a messenger ahead, but Dean was the only one who knew where to find you.”
“How’d you guess?” Lisa teases. She takes Cas’s hand to shake, though there’s something off about her smile. Dean blinks and decides it doesn’t matter as Lisa slides in next to him and leans in for a quick kiss. “This guy hasn’t been telling stories about me, has he?”
“He’s a pill, I know,” and Dean jumps when he notices Bela standing at Cas’s side, that ever-present red smirk on her face. “But this time it’s not his fault. Charlie didn’t want this to turn in to the kind of party that you and I are more used to.”
But Dean doesn’t want to hear it. He doesn’t want to hear that he can be saved, that he’s worth something. He doesn’t want to be told that he’s loved and needed. He wants everyone to leave him alone, until he’s swallowed up by the black hole in his chest, so that he never has to deal with any of this again.
“I would’ve been happy with the phone call,” Dean says, completely sincere. Their phone calls over the school year had been few and far between, but Dean had still been delighted every time his phone lit up with Cas’s name. “Besides,” Dean adds with a smirk, “I don’t think you have any idea how talented my hands are.”
He struggles out of his shirt, then pulls his boxers off, tossing his clothes on the floor next to his bed. His cock is already drooling pre-come onto his stomach, and Dean hisses when he finally wraps a hand around himself and starts moving. He’s close. Of course he is, he was just the victim of a particularly vivid dream that he’d rather not think about when he’s consciously stroking his dick.
Dean sobers immediately, staring up at his alpha, who smiles gently back. Dean’s dad says stuff like that all the time, about Dean being strong-willed and bull-headed and unable to take orders, but he always says it like it’s a bad thing. This alpha doesn’t seem to mind, though.
“Well,” Dean sputters, moving his hands up to Castiel’s fists, trying to work himself free. Castiel takes the hint and lets him go, shoving him gently when he does so.
Dean takes a step back and bites his lip nervously as Missouri’s expression actually turns to surprise. She glances at Dean, then gently takes the frame in her hands, studying the painting inside.
e-mailing Bela, hm?” Dean manages a saucy grin, wiggling his eyebrows until Charlie rolls her eyes and steals the deck of cards from his hands.
But Dean bristles. "He misses Sam's sometimes too," he says, and seems to realize too late that it's not a very good defense. "Look, he's got a lot going on. Life's been hard on him."
Dean startles, genuinely surprised that that’s all Sonny has to say on the matter. As if he can read Dean’s mind, he smiles, sets the painting down, and claps Dean’s shoulder again. “You ever hear of Andrew Wyeth and his Helga paintings?”
“You pointed me in that direction,” Castiel corrects him, annoyed. “I got myself on the track team.”
Cas doesn't even answer. He just stands and leads the way to Dean's basement bedroom, without even waiting for Dean to follow. Like he belongs there. Something about that thought warms Dean from deep inside, and he's still smiling when he reaches the bottom of the staircase and finds Cas studying his walls.
“Cas will probably be there too,” Anna says, suddenly staring at the ground. “If there’s a Roadhouse booth, he’ll probably want to stop by, so. I’ll tell him about it.”
?’” Dean makes a frustrated noise, kicking at Castiel’s shins. “So, she’s way out of my league. She hangs out with this football dude Victor and his friends all the time, and they run the student council and have their own table in the cafeteria and, y’know, then there’s me.” Dean shrugs, frowning. “I draw Batman and read Tolkien and quote Star Wars and hang out with nerds. Because I’m a nerd.” He runs a hand through his hair, leaving sand behind as he turns back to the ocean. “And that’s not even mentioning the rest of what you already know.”
But it’s nice to dream. Dean already knows that Castiel would be a better mate than any of his current options. He considers being honest and telling Castiel that he’s a prince, and then offering him the opportunity to mate… but Castiel is skittish. He runs to avoid his attraction and arousal, and if Dean being an omega in heat wasn’t bad enough, then being a prince in heat will just scare him off for good.
Anna studies him for a moment, still chewing on her lip. In the quiet, with the waves crashing in the background, Dean wonders if this desperation is why he feels sympathy for his dad, when Sam and Mary don’t. Dean gets it. He wants a second chance so badly, he’d crawl on his hands and knees to get it. So even though John isn’t exactly crawling, Dean still wants to put forth the effort. So maybe John doesn’t have to feel quite as bad as Dean does whenever he thinks about Cas.
The omega blinks blearily up at him before turning his nose into Castiel’s chest and inhaling his scent, making a soft noise in the back of his throat. He’s burning up, soaking through his clothes, and Castiel swallows, realizing he’ll have to undress him.
And Dean has to think about it. Has to remember that, yeah, this whole summer, whenever something went wrong, whenever he needed rescued, Cas was the one he turned to. Even near-blackout-drunk, with Lisa at the same party, Dean had curled up on the floor and called Cas. But he’s never really thought about
Lisa looks at Hannah again, then nods curtly. “If it becomes more than needless gossip, however, I have no problem spreading it,” she warns, turning to descend the staircase once again. “Sleep well.”
“Lose the sass, Winchester,” Jody says, rolling her eyes. Dean’s still grinning, even as Castiel makes a face at him. “Your cheek is not appreciated this time of day.”
Castiel thinks of that messy sketch of Kyriel and smiles. “Probably. He writes under a pen name though, and I’m not going to tell you what it is.” Dean’s pout is very convincing, but Castiel shakes his head, refusing to be swayed. “No. We Miltons like our privacy, or else Mother would still be working under her maiden name.”
“I’ll see you around, Cas,” Dean says cheerfully, gliding up to the open window as Castiel closes the car door.
“It’s hard enough keeping up with you,” Cas says, and he turns to meet Dean’s eyes, his own crinkled by a smile. Dean stares at him for a moment before clearing his throat, jerking his gaze away and landing on Charlie, all the way across the room.
Dean makes a face at him, but carefully peels the paper off the package to reveal a Wacom tablet. Surprised, Dean turns to Castiel and sputters for a moment before managing to say, “This… thank you, but I don’t think our computer can support something this advanced.”
His phone shakes in his hands, and he realizes that it’s because he’s trembling. Anna appears at his side, blinking up at him, and he jumps when he notices her.
relationship for a while. And I don’t…” Castiel clenches his fists here, runs a hand through his hair before turning to look at Anna. “I don’t know if I want to be with Dean in a world that will just try to drag us down for being happy.”
Dean pulls his phone away from his ear and scowls at it, only returning it to say, “You’re not Cas.”
It’s true that that might have set up a roadblock between them, slowed them down somehow, but Castiel thinks it still might have taken an incident like last night to get him here regardless. He explains that to Dean, and adds, “You’ve met my family, you know how they used to be. I’ve been dealing with them, and trying to be like them, my whole life. That might have more to do with it than your poor decision-making.”
Dean’s answering grin is glowing with so much adoration that Castiel’s heart joyfully skips a few beats.
Castiel looks at the box in his lap, surprised that he’s surprised to have been included. Of course he is. Inclusion is the Winchester way. He glances at Dean, who’s smiling like he knows what Castiel is thinking, and again, that warm happiness that he’s so unused to fills him to the brim.
The next day, Dean takes the gift card Sam gave him to Wal-Mart and loads up on as many colors of paint as he can.
“Don’t tell me not to worry about you, Castiel,” she says. “You were practically frothing at the mouth defending your right to be with him, and now you’re pouting around the hotel room all day and I haven’t heard your phone ring since that night. I’m not blind,” she snaps when he raises his eyebrows. “I notice these things.”
O’Hare is far from his favorite place, but Castiel isn’t really fond of airports in general. Too many people, most of them rude, and the ever-present possibility of being poked or prodded or asked probing questions. He doesn’t mind flying, not the way Dean does, but he does wish sometimes that he had access to his uncle’s private jet.
They stare at each other for a long moment, and Castiel’s not sure what to think. It’s difficult to reconcile a Dean who breaks noses and leaves bruises with the clever, artistic, compassionate Dean he thought he knew. It occurs to him, again, that they’ve only known each other a few weeks, and realistically, he can’t know which is the real Dean. There’s an ache in Castiel’s chest, a bruise blossoming from when he stood between Dean and that poor boy, and he rubs at it absent-mindedly.
There’s a spike of protective alpha pheromones, and Dean rolls his eyes, waving a hand in Benny’s direction. “Don’t listen to him. You’re fine. That’s not at all why we’re here.”
Dean really wants to walk away. Just keep his mouth shut and leave. That would prove her wrong, prove that he’s not obsessed, that he can just drop this and move on.
Now, the sun is not-quite-set, bathing everything in orange and red and casting long shadows. Dean is leaning over the barrier in front of a rickety stage, Lisa on his left and Cas on his right, with everyone else crowded behind, trying to have a conversation over a terrible cover of “Barracuda.” Every once in a while, Jo or Charlie or Dean will pull themselves up on the barrier and scream “Freebird!” at the stage, only to earn a slew of drunken glares from the crowd and be ignored by the band. Still, they howl with laughter every time, and while Lisa and Cas don’t seem to get it, at least they’re smiling.
Castiel blushes pink and stares resolutely down at his melting ice cream. “Don’t be overdramatic,” he mumbles. The idea that he could be the love of Dean’s life is terrifying and ridiculous - they’re
“I think I found my brother,” he whispers. Dean frowns, watching Cas’s face, but when he turns to the screen and sees the picture, he remembers everything that went down last summer. Cas sobbing on the phone about his runaway older brother, Dean sneaking down to the bungalow in the middle of the night to read Harry Potter and watch Star Wars in an attempt to cheer Cas up, the two of them waking up spooned together on Cas’s tiny bed.
“Cas!” Dean’s voice is sharp, and his hands are gentle when they wrap around Castiel’s wrist. “Breathe!”
Dean hates her so much in this instant. Hates her perfect wavy hair and her perfect cheekbones and her tiny waist and tiny hands and pretty feet in pretty shoes. He hates her snobby attitude and her money and her loyalty to Cas and her complete assurance that Cas cares enough to forgive her sins.
Castiel wakes up the next morning when Anna bounces on his bed and starts shaking his shoulder with one hand. Her other hand is busy holding her phone away from her ear, and though Castiel can’t quite make out what’s being said, he recognizes Jo’s volume and tone immediately.
But sometimes, when it comes to Cas, he can't find the words. He stutters and stalls, like his brain isn't connecting properly. And Missouri waits patiently, watching him, ready to try and sort through whatever word vomit he's going to give her today.
“Yeah, I got that from our first meeting.”  Dean jerked his arm free, taking a few steps backwards.  “How about you don’t touch me, ok?”
Ok, wow, I did NOT expect that kind of a reaction for the first chapter of this story!  Really encouraging, ta so much!
Rufus turned out to be a greying black man with a sour face and a worse disposition.  “The fuck are you doing, Novak?” he’d asked after banging on their door.  “You just got back stateside and suddenly your ex-wife is dead and you’re on the run?  And what the fuck is this?”
Dean even had to quickly order the curious angel away when Castiel attempted to peek in on him in the shower.
Castiel ignored the round of groans and cursing that came with his order and called up more holograms.  These he manipulated with his hands, forming an entirely new component.  “I want to use this in its place,” he called.  “It’s got an alloy finish, which should resolve the corrosion issue.  And the components are all reinforced, which will hopefully help with the vibration issue we discovered the last dry run.  You’ll need the following...”
Alright.  All he needed to do was keep Dean from getting upset enough to tell his secret.  The evaluator for the Convicted Laborer Program came around once a month or so.  Castiel was expecting him in a couple of days for the initial visit.  There was time.  Today was a good start.  Despite the circumstances that had triggered it, Castiel had moved Dean into the house.  Dean had a closet and dresser bulging with clothes.  Castiel had real plans about what Dean would be doing.  Now he had to move forward.  He would treat Dean well.  His father would help keep his brothers under control.  He’d done it with Ellen, even going so far as threatening to cut Michael, Lucifer, and Naomi off if they hurt her again and taking away their remotes.  Castiel knew he could count on Chuck.  Gabriel would help.  He should be back tomorrow from his business trip.  Castiel would enlist him.  He could talk to Dean, keep him calm. Gabriel would be able to tell if Dean should become suspicious.  And if that happened, well, they’d cross that bridge when they came to it.
“The public doesn’t know him like we do.  But Cas is a prick, too!  I cannot believe he’s with your brother and he didn’t tell me!”
Lucifer spread his hands.  “I’ve taken this place and made it prosperous and crime-free!  That was just an example of what I can do for the whole world.”
“Is that so?”  Ellen looked delighted now.  “In that case, I might just let you in my kitchen after all.”
“He’s back at the bunker, Dean.  Now please, just be quiet!  I told you I have a headache, and your questions are only making it worse.”
Blue eyes flinched.  “That was a mistake.  I shouldn’t have left you.  I thought, at the time, that it was the right thing to do.  If I had known that they would come for you, I never would have left your side.  It won’t happen again.”  Cass had stopped rubbing.  Now his hands gripped Dean’s wrist, eyes probing.  “Can you ever forgive me?” Cass pleaded.  “I got Bobby killed, I got you taken away, God only knows what you’ve gone through.  You must hate me.”
The Trickster sighed dramatically.  “Humans.  Must be their short lifespans, because none of them seem to have any patience.  Why, just the other day...”
Michael shrugged.  “We only beat him because we didn’t have the remotes.  Now we have them, we should get along just fine.”
Gabriel, late to arrive as usual.  It was a testament to how upset he was that he’d actually called Castiel by his correct name.  Gabriel had moved to the edge of the roof, looking like he was about to charge forward and grab Castiel before Lucifer extended a hand to keep him back. “Dean, don’t hurt him, please!”
“That’s good.”  Dean drew him closer.  “Because I intend to be with you for a long time.  Marry me, Castiel Novak?”
They’d scouted the location, everything from satellite images to staking out the bunker.  They’d searched for blueprints, which had been surprisingly difficult.  The bunker had been built without filing any permits, on land owned by a non-existent company.  The only stroke of luck they’d had was learning that Singer’s father had been listed as one of the company’s board of directors.
Uriel put an arm around Samandriel and looked at Cass.  “I’ll get him healed up,” he offered.  “Why don’t you fill in Winchester?”
Castiel didn’t answer.  He couldn’t.  He stood in the darkness of his closet, surrounded by his own clothes.  The darkness pressed in more than the garments.  “So, I didn’t do anything wrong?” he whispered.  “When Dean attacked me, it wasn’t anything I did at all, was it?  It was all about the Convicted Laborer Program.”  He shook his head.  “All these years.  All this time, I wondered why, what I’d done wrong, what happened that Dean turned on me like that.  But it was never about me!”
“I know the feeling,” Angelo grumbled next to him.  The man looked as uncomfortable as Dean felt.  “You really think it’s necessary that we share a room, give up all our privacy?”
It was, when it came into view, an old-fashioned truck, complete with a malodorous combustion engine.  It belched clouds of poisonous fumes right into the atmosphere from its rear as it slowed, the operator bringing it to a stop in front of us. The glass window came down.  “Hi there!  You folks break down or something?  Can I offer you a ride into town?”
“Actually, I do.”  Cass tightened his grip.  “I’m sorry, Dean.  But you’re my laborer.  I decide if I want to give up your contract.  And I won’t do it.  We’ll find another way to help your brother, but this isn’t it.  All this will do is either get you both killed, or trap you both in Dick Roman’s security.  Not even the two of you combined could get out if that happened.”
“Dean!”  Cas had my shoulders.  “You’re so pale, all your freckles are standing out!  Are you alright?”
“I don’t want you to do anything!  This isn’t what I wanted.  I’m not here to force you to perform any kind of sexual act, alright?  All I wanted was for you to know that I’m attracted to you.”
“That prototype is worth millions!” Raphael protested.  “It’s almost ready for marketing, and Mike and I have already hammered out contracts! We’ve got factories set up to start mass production as soon as the final government clearances come through.  It’s set to change the lives of thousands of people! You can’t compare that to the well-being of a single man!”
“Time dilation.”  Castiel had called up more holographic figures and was manipulating them with his hands as he explained.  “Time moves slower when you’re moving, and the faster you move, the slower time progresses.  And even my most top-of-the-line computers have limits on their processing speed! In order to fold time and make Project Samandriel work, I’ll need time itself to slow down just a fraction, enough that the components can function.  For that to happen, the minimum speed is fifty miles an hour.”
With a sinking heart, Dean realized that Dick Roman probably knew everything.  He’d been the one who had made the Shurleys disappear and created the Novaks in their place.  He likely knew why the change had been necessary.  That meant he knew about John Winchester.  An idiot could have made the connection.  Immanuel’s medical records and police reports would have told any details of the story that remained.  Dean’s shameful history was right there for anyone who knew where to look.  He had no doubt Dick Roman had known exactly where to look.
“Son of a bitch!  You said you’d leave me alone if I talked to you, and I did!  Now leave me alone!”
Novak groaned.  “Sam, if that’s what you want to believe, then there is no way I can convince you otherwise.  Here.”  He rummaged in the bedside stand and found a pen and a small pad of paper.  Then he quickly jotted down the override codes and handed them to Sam.  “I’ve told you the truth.  Your brother can back up parts of it, but I get it.”
“I assumed as much,” Lucifer replied, irritated.  “I’m reasonably certain you would have mentioned it well before this if he had.  Don’t worry.  Keep shaking trees, and he’ll go there eventually.  Then we’ll have the bastard.”
Dean was still trying to pull away.  Castiel carefully gathered him up and carried Dean up the stairs.  Ignoring the spare bedroom, he pushed through the door to his own room and put Dean down on his own bed.
“Which is why Angeli Quinque was what it was in my time,” Dean growled.  “With Alfie gone, all he needed was that special jack hooked up to the replica of Alfie’s computer.  In my time, the company wasn’t even trying to pretend it was about anything but conquest anymore.  And the only ones who didn’t know it, at least according to Cas, were you guys.  By the time I left, there were only two major hold-outs left before your company had pretty much the entire world under contract - Purgatory, and a country called Huis.”  He held up his right arm.  “I lost this defending Cas when rebels from there attacked us, trying to steal him. At the time, I couldn’t figure out how they knew where we’d be.  But I get it now.  Bartholomew was already on Luc’s staff, and had actually already been assigned as Cas’s bodyguard until Cas protested.  Naomi would have told her darling son what was happening, and probably where.  Gabe made the arrangements, but it was Bartholomew who set us up!”
Balthazar nodded, glanced briefly at Uriel, and went to the door.  A moment later, a pair of guards dragged in a battered, chained demon, throwing her roughly to the floor.  “Ow,” she complained.  “No way to treat a lady, guys!”
Time to take inventory.  Dean had his pistol with the serial numbers buffed off.  He’d conveniently forgotten where he’d obtained that.  Digging through a bunch of junk produced a pair of brass knuckles.  He honestly did have no idea where they came from.  They went into his pocket.  But he found nothing else of use.  Frustrated, Dean paced around his small apartment.
“I do,” Ketch agreed.  “Whoever was running Novak wanted him to be activated there.  Whatever condition he arrived in, he had everything he needed to recover and prepare for his mission to assassinate Senator Rooney.  Turner was accounted for, with programming in place to consider him an enemy if he tried to interfere with Novak’s mission.  I imagine Singer would have faced a similar problem.  His former wife was removed, he was driven out of that cabin, and he was cut off from his friends.  Every variable was accounted for.  Except for one.”
“What’s the connection?” Cole wanted to know, frowning at the two pictures as he moved back and forth between them.  “These two guys don’t seem like they have anything in common, other than the angels.”
Meet John Winchester?  He hadn’t even been born yet.  I snorted. “That’s going to be a little hard, since he’s not alive right now.”
“No, I will accept the blame for that,” Ketch said.  “I knew the angels would put every effort into trying to protect him.  And as a copper level angel, I expected he’d be able to fight off whatever the King of Hell threw at him.  I never thought he’d be this weak, that the demons would actually be able to capture him.”
“Jo,” Dean says, but Jo just shakes her head again and storms away from the table. Charlie’s breath hitches, and she wipes the dampness from her eyes before chasing after her, yelling Jo’s name as she slams through the door.
When no response comes, Castiel leans back in his chair and opens the photo albums in his phone. This isn’t a habit he’ll admit to having, but he takes pictures of every sketch or doodle or painting Dean sends him, and likes to scan through them when he’s bored or upset or lonely.
“Why do you want to watch a movie about lesbians?” Dean frowns, flipping the case over in his hands. “How did you
date, Winchester, so you don’t get to decide that. And I was under the impression he already knew about all this, just for the record.”
Castiel blinks his eyes open to find himself in a pile of sleepy, whining teenagers. Charlie is spooned up behind him, with Jo on top of her, and Castiel’s head had at some point made its way to Dean’s chest, Pam’s hair tickling his nose from where she’s still waking up on Dean’s stomach. A whistle blows, making Dean jump, forcing Castiel to sit up and shake Charlie and Jo off as he turns to find the source of the noise. An older woman in a police jacket is smiling down at them, tucking the whistle back into her chest pocket.
. And his touch is hardly gentle when it grips Dean’s hair, pulling until Dean’s neck is stretched taut, and suddenly, Castiel’s nose is pressed against Dean’s scent gland, inhaling deeply. When he growls again, a dark, possessive sound, that’s it. That’s all she wrote. Dean comes there and then, an embarrassing high-pitched noise wrenching it’s way from the back of his throat as visions dance through his head: teeth piercing the skin of his neck, leaving a mark for the whole world to see, and a sweet, apologetic alpha nuzzling the bruise and leaving kisses on his shoulders while they wait for the knot to go down.
Dean tightens his jaw, but Cas just returns his glare until Dean finally submits, leaning back in his seat to wait for the lights to go down. Cas resumes texting, but keeps his phone in tighter, harder to see. The rest of the group are chatting amongst themselves, laughing and throwing popcorn and sharing candy, so Dean retreats into his own mind, to pull apart his memories of kissing Cas and try to figure out what had really happened, what Cas’s reactions had really meant.
"Just be there. It's the arcade on Main Street, we're meeting up at 7:30, and Pam said she'd bring pizza, so don't be late."
“No, ma’am,” Dean says demurely, struggling against the urge to lower his head and shuffle his feet.
For the first time in a while, Dean remembers that he’s supposed to be finding a suitor. That his father wants him to get married and go be a trophy omega in some other kingdom, even though Dean has been training to take over the throne since he was just a pup, and Sam has no interest in anything except studying with the Men of Letters. So Dean isn’t sure what John expects to get out of marrying Dean off.
“Where the hell have you been, Cas?” There’s a headache forming at Dean’s temples, so he pinches the bridge of his nose. “I’ve… we’ve been worried sick!”
Dean chuckles, running a hand through her hair, adjusting the ribbon over her ear. “Better,” he says. “It was Cas.”
Longing tugs at Castiel’s heart, when he realizes that he’ll only get to enjoy this for a little while longer. He scoots back until they’re pressed firmly together, wanting to make the most of this while he can.
He checks his luggage and picks up his boarding pass from a woman whose smile is far too big for a high-traffic customer service position at this time of morning. Kids and confused tourists walk at a snail’s pace across the concourse, and Castiel finds himself silently thanking the heavens that he bought first class tickets and doesn’t have to wait in the longer security line.
Castiel rubs at his temples and takes a few deep breaths to clear his head. Dean’s scent still lingers at the window, and, as if to confirm his utter weakness, that’s what drives Castiel to step inside the cottage, strip out of his clothes and climb into the bed behind Dean.
Dean’s whole body still feels heavy and overly warm, but he manages to sit up, throwing his undershirt aside and taking a few deep breaths. That smell is embedded in the walls, and it’s overwhelming but makes it easier to breathe at the same time. Late afternoon sunlight is coming in through the windows, and when Dean hears the sound of humming and buzzing, he pricks his ears towards the open window.
“You’re the only one I want staying here, all right?” Dean sounds almost angry as he says it, but Castiel had expected nothing less. “There’s a new Hampton just up the street, everybody else can stay there, or go to the fucking resort or what the fuck ever. I want you under my roof.”
“It’s so weird that your ex hangs out with your girlfriend,” Dean mutters, eyeing Sam with the rearview mirror. Sam snorts.
so you can follow and message me there if you like! I'll probably be promoting this on Tumblr, so if you message me there within the next couple weeks I might respond! But after that, I can't make guarantees. Twitter is definitely the best place to find me now.
They don’t speak for several moments. Dean is practically vibrating, shifting and fidgeting as he struggles to hold his silence and not look at Castiel, while Castiel sits calmly, taking in the view. They’re several yards up from the road, and the beach is visible just beyond the second row of rooftops. The night is clear, stars sparkling overhead, but the wind is starting to pick up off the ocean, and will probably bring a storm with it sometime before morning. The town spread out before them is a beautiful picture, and even with Dean being antsy, sitting next to him is comfortable. It’s not grating, the way it was last time, but Castiel doesn’t have time to wonder why.
“Besides,” Dean continues, oblivious to the simmering heat in Castiel’s belly, “there’s a couple people waiting for us that I kind of want to make a good impression on. Rumpled jackets and sex stank ain’t gonna help me there.”
Dean holds up their entwined hands and makes a triumphant expression that Charlie just waves off. They approach a round table near the middle of the restaurant, and Dean uses his free hand to wave at Mary behind the counter while Charlie pulls out a chair. “You just kissed him in the rain,” she argues as everyone takes a seat. “Classic Ross and Rachel, case closed.”
Dean shushes her. “I have to cleanse my ears before and after exposing them to your bands. Metallica is perfect for this.”
Cas smiles slightly and glances at Dean. “You are the type to dance like a fool just to help a friend,” he says, and there’s so much affection in his words that Dean can feel his own cheeks heating up.
It’s the second time this morning someone has brought up what Castiel did to help Dean get out of his downward spiral, and isn’t that funny?
The elevator dings, and Castiel follows Dean inside before asking, “How did you get my siblings involved in this, anyway?”
She freezes, clearly blushing, and Dean remembers what Cas had said at Jo’s birthday party, about Anna wanting to marry him. He can’t help giving her his most charming smile. “Um,” Anna stutters, turning to keep her eyes on the stage. “They’re called the Hush Sound. I can, um…” She bites her lower lip. “I can burn you copies of their CDs if you want?”
It took two police officers, three bystanders, and the bar tender to get you subdued to the point you could be cuffed and arrested.
Unable to convince Dean to move willingly, the cook had resorted to dumping Dean over his shoulder.  “What the hell are you doing?” Dean yelled.  “Put me down!”
Castiel’s frown deepened.  Turning his back on his giggling siblings, he quickly headed upstairs for Dean’s room.  He stopped at the door and knocked.  “Sam?  May I come in, please?”
“Or worse.”  Dean shook his head.  “He already wants to use you to make some sort of example.  You know, ransom you back to Roman Enterprises in exchange for them releasing a bunch of laborers or something like that.  If he learns the truth?  He’s more likely to torture you until your dad comes out of hiding to take your place.”
“He’s got a private island, Purgatory, that’s completely secure,” Rooney explained.  “You can stop worrying.  Lucifer adores that boy, can’t stop talking about him.  He’ll take your brother to Purgatory, and he’ll be safe.  He won’t let any harm come to Sam.”
“Why would you say that?”  Those eyes seemed to bore into Dean.  “You don’t believe you deserve to be saved.”
“I know, and I’m grateful.  Oh!  You got a package today,” Dean said suddenly.  “I forgot to tell you when everything else happened.  It’s from one of your labs in Ohio.”
His eyes fell on the door leading to his own bedroom.  And his mind went back over what his siblings had said.
Naomi sputtered.  “You mean you’re not going to make him give me back my remote?  Ugh, this is so unfair!  And dangerous!  Dad, this is crazy!”
Even with Ash’s help, it was a hell of a job.  Dean was in danger of faceplanting cross-eyed into the book he was looking through when Ash exclaimed, “Found it!  Angel of imagination, right?”
Cass immediately nodded and went back to work, trusting Dean at his word.  Dean’s heart swelled.  He looked around, determined.  By the time Cass finished and closed his computer, Dean had a plan.
“You don’t want me,” Castiel said, trying to sound casual.  “I get that. I don’t blame you.  You never wanted me in the first place, after all. And it’s simple now.  We’re right here, in the Defense section, about to talk to Lucifer, who is head of security.  It’s the perfect chance to ask for a transfer!”
In retrospect, while we’d all praised Charlie for her discovery, privately we’d agreed it should have been obvious.  Every processor Heaven’s Angels produced all had the same signature, a tiny bit of code that identified it as coming from our factories.  For the most part, even today the world believed it was there to prevent pirating, and that was partially true.  But Gabriel had confirmed what it really was - a tightly packed bit of code that was capable, for a short period of time, of opening a secret back door, allowing anyone who used it the ability to alter the base program of any tech that used the hardware.  Every processor we’d ever designed, built, and sold had that secret back door.  And Gabriel, who’d seen it before, recognized what it was - Samandriel’s brain patterns. Gabriel claimed, with a bit of work, he could have replicated it, unlocked that back door that allowed Charlie’s program entrance.  He probably could.  After all, that’s why, in the other timeline, the Hunters had sent Dean to steal Gabriel. But Samandriel had needed nothing more than his own thoughts.  Once we’d connected Purgatory to the Heaven’s Angels network, Samandriel had linked up with Charlie and pulsed her signal through the entire network, to every processor. All over the world, those processors had responded.  Most of them were unaffected, Charlie’s program only acting to close that back door forever.  But the tracking capability, as well as the ability of the Chimera implants to take people over, was completely shut down.  It didn’t even matter if the veterans were blacked out.  If the processors existed, they responded.  And now they never would again.
Ketch rolled his eyes.  “While I’m sure you have all the faith in your friend, we’re going to need a bit more than the word of a mechanic who just happened to be chosen by an archangel.”
Luc let me go and helped a groaning Dean get back up.  His confused blue eyes were moving between the two of us.  “Um, do you guys need to talk to Samandriel?”
No, the worst came the next day, when Dean learned what had brought John home unexpectedly, and where John’s hatred of Immanuel’s family came from.  Mary Winchester was gone, dead at the hands of the abusive man who’d bought her contract, only months before her sentence would be over.  His mother was dead, and now John had a new mission.  He’d take down the Convicted Laborer Program.  He’d dismantle it, one laborer or official or factory at a time.  His sons would join him, of course.  And together, they’d find a way to get to the one man ultimately responsible.  They’d take down the genius behind the shock collars that had turned the system into reality.  Carver Shurley had grown rich off the backs of people like Dean’s mother, and now he’d pay.  Him, and his entire family.
Cass gave her a murderous look.  Dean braced for yet another fight between the siblings when someone clapped his hands sharply together.
A small yet powerful hand seized Dean’s wrist where it rested on the table, pulling Dean to his feet.  Dean turned to see Hael smiling at him.  “It’s time,” she announced excitedly.  “Samandriel, your Grace should be back enough by now.  Give him to me.  Quickly, Michael anxiously awaits his vessel.”
“Help me!”  Cas was rising slightly, pushing himself up on his elbows.  Even though I knew it was a hologram, I recognized what was coming and couldn’t stop myself from grabbing Alfie, turning him away as though I could shield him as Castiel’s hologram drew back and slammed his Angel blade forward.
“Not anymore, dude,” Ash explained.  He jerked a thumb over his shoulder.  “She’s right outside.  I drove her here.  Sweet ride!”
“Stop fighting.”  Castiel dragged the struggling, cursing candidate back towards the porch.  “I’m sorry we’re having communication problems...”
Dean was swearing softly at his weapon.  Out of ammo.  He fumbled in his pockets for more, only to come up empty.  “Shit!”
“Hey, now, that isn’t fair!” Jeff protested.  “She’s a beautiful woman in her twenties, Castiel.  Did you expect her to act the grieving widow forever?”
“Ok, that’s perfect.”  I took him by the hand and led him to sit on the couch.  “I need you to sit here and go through those files, try to figure out what happened.  Because I don’t think we came back to the point in time we were supposed to.  This isn’t the week we spent at the cabin, which means it’s either after we left, which I doubt because what you carved under the bed isn’t there, or before we got here.  Something went wrong.  So I need you to puzzle this out as much as you can, off-jack, while I try to figure out when, exactly, we actually are.”
Uriel knew there was trouble when he was summoned to Naomi’s office.  He’d been expecting it for some time, ever since that disturbing news flashed through the ranks that Michael’s new vessel had gone missing, along with the collector assigned to bring him in.  Uriel had done all he could to help his friend, but Samandriel had failed, and failed spectacularly.  Now all of Heaven was in an uproar, demons were crawling all over the Earth, the human population was completely confused, and worst of all, no one knew where Winchester or Samandriel were now.
“Because Dean’s not all bad,” Castiel admitted.  “There was one redeeming quality that Dean had in school.  He loved Sam.  He would have done anything for his younger brother.  It’s why Sam was able to get him to stop beating on me.  That’s why I’m surprised Dean would switch identities with Sam.  He had to know that if anyone found out, Sam would immediately be under suspicion of all the crimes Dean did.”
“We’re talking about your mom,” Dean told him.  “She says she only dropped you twice.  It’s not her fault you turned out to be such a bitch.”
Dean grinned and started plating the food.  The grin faded from his face.  What was he doing?  Playing
There, on the side of the Heaven building, an angel made of glistening, multicolored lights soared.  Castiel’s eyes immediately were drawn to the violet lights.  “It’s beautiful.”
“They’ll never trust your family, especially not your father!” Dean protested.  “Cass, they kept you locked up for how long, and they didn’t even know who you really were.  What makes you think...?”
Dean was seated in an uncomfortable chair, his wrists tied to the armrests and ankles fastened to the legs.  He’d long ago gone hoarse.  All he could taste was blood.  His nose was swollen, maybe broken, making it hard to breathe.  Blood trickled down his throat, making him choke.  His ribs throbbed, restricting his breathing even more.  He’d already thrown up all over himself.  At least it had been washed off, somewhat, with more buckets of cold water, thrown into Dean’s face any time he’d passed out.  More blood dripped into his eye from a cut on his brow.  He couldn’t see much of anything through it.  His entire body ached from blow after blow.
“Hello, Cassandra!”  Lucifer was frowning, tapping on Castiel’s forehead.  “Come back to Earth, please, your people need you!”
Dean had gone still.  He stayed as he was for a moment.  Castiel stared at his own folded hands, his heart pounding in his ears.  But then Dean’s hands reached out, covered his own.  “I won’t let it happen,” he assured.  “I’ll protect you.  And you can be yourself around me, alright?  I’m not here to judge you, and I’m sure as hell not here to laugh at you.  You’re amazing, alright?  And it’s a damned honor to work with you.”
Statistics flashed through Dean’s head, numbers he’d prefer he hadn’t known.  Sam might never recover.  He could end up with brain damage and live his life as a vegetable.  He could die.  Which would be worse?
Castiel stared out the window.  “He’ll be alright.  I just need to be there when he wakes up, in case something goes wrong or someone says the wrong thing.  I’ll make him understand!  And once he sees how good my prototype is, he’ll be happy!”
“You got it.”  From somewhere in the distance, Baby’s engine roared, and then it was nothing but static again.
I’m not talking about this with you,” Castiel groans, sliding off his stool. He’s about to go commandeer the television and drown out Anna’s teasing, but he freezes as soon as he turns around.
“Sure.” She shrugs, looking anywhere that isn’t Dean’s face. “I mean, he is still talking to Charlie and Jo so he’ll definitely want to see them, and he knows they’re your friends too, so if you happen to be there, he can, y’know. Deal with it.”
“You’re more important. You and Sam are so important, and your mother is important, and I want to be there.” Again, silence is the response, but this time it goes on for just a little too long. “Dean?”
Now Charlie’s face lights up like a stop light, and it’s Dean’s turn to laugh at her. Charlie’s relationship with Gilda is still in its infancy, but Dean likes her well enough. She’s a pretty ballerina from Seaside, who Charlie met when she decided to give Dungeons and Dragons a shot, and the infatuation was almost immediate.
A few hours later, Dean emerges from his room. He avoids Sam’s gaze, well-aware that he looks like hell and unwilling to talk about why.
Charlie sighs, rolling her eyes. “Fine. Fine! I was thinking I’d have to tell you anyway, because of her birthday party coming up soon, and I was hoping you’d-”
And it’s probably a bad thing that he keeps thinking he could be happy with Castiel as both prince and pauper, so he tries to ignore it.
text him. They haven’t spoken since the night of the storm, and while Castiel appreciates being given a little space, he still misses Dean. He knows he’d crack and agree to join them if Dean would just
“Are you sure you want me to drop you off at the beach here?” Gabriel says, startling Castiel out of his reverie. “‘Cause I’m starting to consider taking a trip out to Portland, and you could come with. We could even go back and get Anna real quick.”
“It’s Jo?” And Dean manages to suppress a wince, but he still reaches over to gently grip Charlie’s forearm, unsure of what to say. Jo is a year and a half younger than they are, and while Dean thinks he might like to see her with Charlie, that they could make each other happy, he also knows that Jo has never shown an interest in girls. At least not to him, anyway. She’d had a crush on Dean when they were younger, but outgrew it while he still lived in Topeka; other, closer boys were much easier to fall for. Granted, Jo may just not have realized anything yet, or she may not feel comfortable talking to Dean about it, but Dean can’t shake the feeling that Charlie will only end up hurt.
Ellen’s other eyebrow raises as she glances across the table at Cas, who is staring out the window at the ocean down the hill. Dean laughs abruptly. “Jesus, Ellen, no! We’re meeting Lisa here.”
His phone is out and pressed to his ear before he even reaches his truck. It rings twice, then goes to voicemail, and that’s when Dean realizes he’d called Cas, and God, why does he do that? Without even thinking about it?
“No,” Cass grumbled.  He was already crouched down with Dean, trying to gather up the lost paperwork.  “Sam didn’t do anything wrong, and I’m not shocking him.”
“We’re listening now, Luc,” Michael encouraged, leaning forward in his chair.  “I should have listened to you before, but I’m definitely listening now.  You’re in charge of security.  So tell me.  How dangerous is he?”
“It’s a failsafe,” the Lead Handler explained without looking up.  “It activates if you try to remove the jack before we’re finished.”
Naomi still didn’t look up.  “Some of us have work to do.  We don’t all get to work from home and get waited on by our pretty laborers all day.”
Next thing he knew, he sensed movement. Someone was carrying him, he was resting against a broad chest.  Then he was put into a chair, padded, perfectly sculped to fit his body... Ah.  The chair in his lab.  He rarely used it, preferring the antigrav belt so he could float around, but that was the only thing it could be.  Why was he in it?
Dean’s throat felt like it was on fire.  He’d screamed himself hoarse some time ago.  Now he could barely manage a whisper.  His shoulders ached.  His hands had long ago fallen asleep.  His legs were cramped.  His feet throbbed from kicking at the trunk.  He was exhausted.  He was overheated.  Now all he could do was lie in the dark, wincing as the car bounced and aggravated his many injuries.
“I won’t, brother.”  Lucifer was so gentle, supporting him as he stumbled, even shielding Castiel’s face from curious onlookers.  “Shh, it’s alright,” he soothed.  “I’m right here.”
“Well, I won’t lie.  I’m definitely a little sore in the back door, if you know what I mean, but don’t you worry, angel.  I’m just fine.”
“So he’s somewhere else?” Dean called, hurrying after the Senator.  Angelo was waving them forward in the hall.  The intense look on the aide’s face drove home the seriousness of the situation.
“I know more about Sam Winchester than you can imagine.”  All traces of the joking, irreverent clown Dean had met were gone now.  His own image stared back at Dean, eyes serious and somehow full of pain.  “You see, Castiel is not the first angel in modern times to have encountered the soul that matches his Grace.  When Lucifer first came to Earth, I disguised myself and got close, trying to see if I could find out what his end game was.  And the moment I sensed your brother’s soul?”  He shook his head.  “I never felt anything like it before or since.”
Azazel made good on his promise, pulling off onto a side street and dragging Dean out to force him into the trunk.  Dean managed to get a few more good kicks in, got punched in return, and succeeded only in earning a split lip and throbbing jaw in the cramped, suffocating darkness of the trunk.
“Of course not, don’t be a fool,” Crowley responded, still chuckling.  “I’ll be the one doing interviews.”  He sighed, smiling as he tapped a finger against his chin.  “I shall have to order more business cards.”
“Then frankly, you’re better off,” Ketch retorted.  “If he’s not dirty, then Lucifer Nicholas is obligated to provide for you and your brother.  Either way, you’re ahead.  Sign the bloody papers, and call me when you have some actual information!”  He hung up.
“Of course it is!  It’s been so long since I could work to capacity and I’ve got so many ideas!  Dean, let go of me.  Samandriel, I’m a year ahead!  I can do so much, make so many improvements...”
“Rooney wants you to stay with him, but I imagine, once Nicholas is made aware of where you are, he’ll take you first.  Again, keep your eyes open.  There are a lot of people who would benefit from having Rooney gone, but not all of them have the kind of access to the Senator that would be needed to pull something like this off.  It’s someone on the inside, someone who had the access and the clearance to pull all of this off.  That’s a very short list, Dean, and Nicholas isn’t even on it.”
“Dean, how long have we been unconscious?” I asked.  “Their indicators were full when we left, and now they’re almost at zero!”
“That’s right.”  Castiel absently turned as Dean moved around him, sending him down a different path away from the security perimeter.  “Once it’s launched, the whole thing will work automatically, dozens of different computers activating components in various projects all over the world.  I’ve even arranged for back-ups of every part of the system, just in case one of them should fail or go off-line.  But I can’t do anything about myself, and that’s the problem!  Working on the project requires a massive amount of processing time on the jack.  And I max out my security limits fast!  Over and over again, I’ve come so close, just to hear those stupid chimes, and next thing I know, I’m getting kicked off the jack!”  He kicked a hydrant in frustration.  “The only way I’m ever going to get this project off the ground is if I can somehow convince Lucifer to raise my security protocols.  Even one day might be enough!”
Dean moaned.  “I don’t know where Cass is, I swear it!  Yes, he kept me with him for a while, but it wasn’t like you think.  He was trying to help me.”
“I know,” Sam interrupted.  “Dean’s in trouble, too.  But he didn’t murder anyone.  He’s smart.  He’ll find a way to clear his name.  And then he’ll come for me.”  He offered Luc a small smile.  “I want you to know, I appreciate everything you’ve done for me.  I’m really flattered that you think I’m someone you want as part of your family.  But you can’t keep me, Luc.  Sooner or later, I’m going back to my family.  I’m sorry.”
“Good morning, Dean.”  Castiel poured himself a cup and took a drink.  He grimaced.  Even black, the coffee was terrible.  He indicated the pot.  “Would you like some hot turpentine?  I’m fairly certain that is the main ingredient of this monstrosity.”
“And that’s why Azazel was so determined to find him?” Dean asked, incredulous.  “Because if Cass isn’t found and brought in, some fucker can just set up a billboard or something that will trigger him into killbot mode?  That piece of shit was going to watch me being gang raped because some prick named Lucifer...  Yeah, Senator,” Dean confirmed, seeing Rooney’s face go white.  “That’s where things were heading before your boy Ketch showed up.  So if Lucifer’s your attack dog?  You’d best put him on a fucking leash!”
Castiel’s eyes moved to Gabriel, widened in alarm.  He stepped forward, took the jack I still held, and plugged it into his plate.  I breathed a sigh of relief, transferred control to him, and removed my jack.  And a moment later, Gabriel gasped.  “Rebooting.  Rebooting.”
“That will change.”  Her voice was suddenly colder than I’d heard it in years.  “Samandriel, I am your mother.  No one on this Earth loves you more than I do, no one knows you better, and no one has fought and sacrificed more for you than I have!  And I will
“No one instructed me to bid for you,” Cass defended.  “My father suggested I look for a new laborer with mechanical skills, but I stumbled over Sam’s name by chance.  I wasn’t even looking to buy.  I couldn’t sleep, so I took my father’s advice and was looking at listings for laborers with mechanic skills.  His name came up.  There was no conspiracy there, Dean.  It was pure chance I saw and recognized Sam’s name.”
To his complete and utter shock, both Naomi and her tech ignored him completely.  “Basic diagnostics looks normal, but there’s something off about the baseline readings,” the tech reported.
“Cas!” Jo crawls over and puts her hands on Dean’s shoulders, shaking him. “Cas can keep you company at the concert, that way you won’t be so bored you ruin everybody’s good time!”
Dean lied too. He lied about the sex dreams. He lied by omission, keeping all those little desires to himself, about playing with Cas’s hair or liking the way he smells. He lied about the kisses, because they do mean something to him. He lied about being completely honest with Cas.
But for some reason, Lisa can’t help correcting her: “No, he only did it for Charlie, so she could-”
As they head down the hill, Dean stumbles a few times too many. Lilith and Ruby laugh at him, then turn their backs. Considering Alastair is informing Azazel on who to collect from, it’s a little surprising to feel someone attempting to support his weight.
“Dean,” Castiel says firmly. It’s not Alpha Voice, but it’s close enough that Dean decides to shut up and listen. “I must insist. I refuse to hurt you.”
As always, thank you guys for reading! Please let me know what you think, and pass the word around about this story if you like it! The bigger the audience, the faster I write!
. He’s afraid of having Dean. Afraid of losing him. Of hurting him, or being hurt by him. Of getting too close, and not being able to be close enough. Castiel wants Dean but he has no idea what he wants from him, and that makes him afraid as well. He’s so conflicted by Dean, and no matter how much time he spends on his own, he can’t sort this out. It’s too much. And all of this on top of what’s going on with his mother and Michael, and Castiel feels like he’s about to burst from his own overwhelming confusion.
Castiel shakes his head, because while he does want to share his epiphany with Dean, he wants a little more time to process it himself first. To calm down and express his feelings clearly.
"Shit," the boy says again, softer this time, as Cas winces and brings his hand protectively to his chest. "I'm so sorry, man, I didn't see you, I swear, I'm sorry." They manage to right themselves, and the boy reaches to pick up the frisbee he must have been chasing when he tripped. "Seriously, sorry."
But Jo just raises an eyebrow, studying his face. “Look, I know a little something about obsession,” she says seriously, brushing hair out of her face. “Between Panic! and Fall Out Boy, I’ve kinda got it figured out. And I’m telling you from experience, you’re obsessed with Cas.”
But it’s harder with Dean here. He’s a warm, unavoidable presence at Castiel’s side, constant and grounding. If his soft breathing is distracting, his perfect profile is even more so. He’s clearly content just to be near Castiel, and it’s disconcerting that Castiel doesn’t feel the same way. Dean is beautiful and kind, but that beauty and kindness is just annoying right now. Castiel doesn’t want to talk and he doesn’t want to be distracted. He wants to sink into his head and pick apart every detail of what happened with Michael and his mother until he fully understands it.
Cas purses his lips, then sighs. “Sure,” he says, shoulders stiff. Dean only just starts to feel relief when Cas clarifies, “I guess I can stomach it for Charlie.”
It can be that simple, if Castiel lets it. If they can work through the rest of it, maybe someday, that’s what it can be.
Dean runs a hand through his hair and lets out a long sigh. It’s nice to hear the words, to know that Lisa doesn’t begrudge him anything from their youth, but it does little to lighten the emotional load he’s carrying.
“I’m going to Gonzaga and she’s headed all the way to London. We’re both young and there’s lots of opportunities at college, so we figured, why limit ourselves?”
“‘Shit happened?’” Castiel frowns, ready to ask what that means, but when Dean’s eyes narrow, the words die in his throat. It means that Dean has shared enough for today. “Okay, okay. Fine.”
Dean is trying to respect Castiel’s decision, he really is. But all he wants is to be held down and knotted and knocked up, and he’s pretty sure that during his less lucid moments, he may have actually asked for those things. Or pleaded. Whined. Those might be better words for it.
Then, Cas smiles. Huge and warm and welcoming. He steps away from Jo’s grasp and walks towards Dean, who can’t help flinching a little bit as Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s shoulders and squeezes gently.
Cas’s smile softens into something content, and he swings an arm around Dean’s shoulder as they head back to the room. If just for this moment, Dean feels confident that no matter what else happens in his life, at least he’ll always have Cas. And that’s better than nothing.
,” and forces a smile when the alpha king silently turns back to the table. “Please have a seat, Castiel. I’ll try to keep him in line.”
“That’s probably a good idea,” Castiel says, jerking his chin towards the shed. “We should all get inside anyway.”
He stops in the open doorway, as Lisa steps aside and sweeps an arm out, gesturing towards a new bed. More white, everywhere, sheer and lacey, and curled up in the sheets is another figure, though Dean can’t see a face. All he can see is skin, just a few shades lighter than Lisa’s, barely covered by white sheets… and wings. Coal black wings tucked up as close to the torso as possible, fluttering gently as the rib cage rises and falls..
also, i wrote the last few scenes on an airplane and am posting this from an airport, so if you spot any errors let me know! i did some editing, but it was rushed and in little bursts so i'm pretty sure i missed some things.
Charlie laughs outright, completely missing the way Dean’s grip tightens around his pencil, the way his lines suddenly go dark and thick. “I kinda want to thank this guy for helping us out so much. Is he on MySpace?”
Castiel lifts his hand and points at the back wall, towards a figure brandishing an oddly-shaped machete. “That too?”
Dean nods slowly, then pulls Castiel into a warm embrace. It should be soothing, a promise of good things to come, that everything will be okay.
What, Castiel wants to ask, but Alastair and Azazel are making approving noises, trying to stand on their own. Bela smiles at Castiel as she stands, and she exchanges an amused look with Lilith when Castiel struggles to find his balance. Did he really drink that much? Each girl grabs an arm, attempting to pull him up, only to end up laughing when they inevitably fall backwards.
“Good luck, Spock!” Dean says cheerfully, and Castiel can hear laughter before the line cuts off. He’s smiling to himself, unconsciously, as he tightens his laces, changes into a lighter shirt, and slips out of his room. With Gabe occupied, he’ll have to run out to town, but that’s not a problem; he runs through town every morning for practice, and before Lucifer ratted him out, he would typically run out to see his friends later in the day. His time is already much improved, and it hasn’t even been a month.
“I’m shocked to hear that he’s attached to his girlfriend,” he says, rolling his eyes before leaning in to nudge her shoulder. “Don’t tell me you’re jealous, sweetheart.”
the king by requesting Dean’s permission to court him instead… this would never have been allowed in Cielo.
Charlie scoots her stool closer to Castiel, just so she can lean over his back and watch Dean and Pam over his shoulder. “Just let her read your palm, Dean. It’s not like it hurts or anything.” Dean scowls, but Charlie just hooks her chin over Castiel’s shoulder and wraps her arms around his waist, snuggling in. Castiel blushes slightly, surprised at her warmth. “And Pam’s right about people falling in love with Cas. He’s so dreamy,” Charlie giggles, toying with Castiel’s hair..
“You think I haven’t?!”  Castiel is a little shocked by the pitch of his voice when it breaks, but he’s so angry about this that he just clears his throat and continues, “I knew this would happen, I knew you’d be like this, so I
), but maybe if he keeps reminding himself that he’s little more than a doll to her, he’ll still be able to respect himself in the morning.
Bela’s lips form a red little ‘o’ when he emerges, as though she hadn’t expected him to clean up nicely. She quickly collects herself, however, standing up and hooking her arm through Castiel’s. It’s the same gesture Jo used the night they met, but Jo was attempting to be warm and inclusive. Bela is only putting on a show. For the millionth time, pain rings in Castiel’s chest as he thinks of his friends.
He could stay in Winchester, and run the kingdom like he was always meant to do. The villagers don’t have any issue with Dean being an omega; they like him for so many other reasons that his gender is practically irrelevant. John is the only person who seems to have an issue with it, and the more Dean and Sam and their mother fight him on it, the more insistent he becomes.
Castiel shoves his hands in his pockets as he steps through the front door and goes to stand at the curb. One of the valets asks him which car is his, but Castiel waves him away, clarifying that he’s just waiting for someone.
“It’s not too dangerous for you,” Castiel corrected.  “There are others of far more importance to my plan that I cannot let you interfere with.  That is why I will be keeping you here, where only I can find you.  You need to be kept safely out of the way until our plans are all in place.  Then, assuming you can prove yourself worthy of trust?”  The blue eyes darkened with doubt.  “Then perhaps we can consider what we can do with you.”
“Nice work,” Dean said.  “Thing is, you’re not going to be able to fix my life as easily as you just fixed this television.”
Bobby was shaking his head as I turned the car off and returned to him.  “Dean, I sent you out here to keep you busy.  These two cars, I brought ‘em in here intending to tear them down for parts. Then a cyborg mechanic comes along, and they’re both running!  Is everyone in your time, how did you put it, cybernetically enhanced?”
Castiel didn’t answer.  The exit led to a long stretch of poorly-maintained road through a densely-wooded area.  Castiel took the first side road he could find, drove for a bit, pulled over, and got out of the car.
“Anyway, I realized pretty quickly that he’d been telling the truth,” Sam continued.  “What I saw in the back of that distribution center, the crops, the honey?  Honey!  It took me a moment to really understand what it was, what I was looking at.  Once I did, I realized we’d all been lied to.  Because I’d found out a lot more was going on than just the farmlands outside the domes.”
“My brother.”  Dean looked at his hands, ignoring the surprised look Castiel was giving him. “I know, as much as I wish you could, that you can’t actually help with Cas.  I’m the one who messed that up, and now I gotta prove myself.  And it’s bullshit, because Cas is the one who’s gonna suffer most for it!  But talking to you about that was actually just my excuse to get him to bring me in here. What I really need to talk to you about is Sammy.”
Gabriel looked at his brother in awe.  “Cassie, you’re a genius!  We can’t talk to Dean, but we can certainly talk to Sam, especially if we send someone he can’t connect to us.”  He rubbed his hands together gleefully.  “I know some people.”
“Two, something is wrong with this company.  I came in thinking it was the Angels.  Now, I have no idea what it could be.  I don’t even know where to look!”
You have no idea what that fucker gave the cops, but he obviously told them who he was trying to blackmail.
Even shielded by Bobby, Castiel felt it.  A force like a mighty wind raced over him, threatening to tear him from his vessel.  For a moment, it nearly succeeded.  It took all of his strength not to lose his hold.  If his vessel hadn’t been empty, Castiel thought as he settled back in, he might have been forced out.
“Yeah.  I need to.  I can’t stay here for fifteen years, alright?  I need to get out there, do my job, and find out what’s really happening with my brother.”
“That’s my Sammy.  We lost our mom when he was just a baby, house fire.  And dad wasn’t around, so I pretty much raised us both.  That kid, he never should have gotten into this life.”
The sheer volume of good produce at the warehouse revealed the lie.  There was no way that much good farmland existed in the rim territories, the only place bees flourished in the dome.  It had been as though the best of the land’s bounty from multiple domes had all been gathered there.  But Castiel, in charge of inter-dome transport, knew that wasn’t possible.
The six of us were taking the stand, taking turns repeating how wonderful the two of them were.  Raphael was up there now.  The fact we were all sticking up for them had probably been the biggest factor in keeping Dean from exploding.  But the problem was that no one was disputing how well the brothers cared for us.  Over and over again, mom’s lawyers focused back to the same thing.
“No, Luc, I do not!  I’m talking about Cas!  We all know why, but facts are facts.  He very much does need a babysitter, one that can be trusted to care for him, protect him, and keep quiet about Angeli Quinque business.  With this being our Lead Researcher we’re speaking of here, that trait, trustworthiness, becomes especially vital!  Now the only thing that we need to decide here is one question - is Dean Winchester trustworthy?”
“Um, Angel Castiel, you, of course, are welcome to sit wherever you wish!” Her dazzling smile was back.  “We have an open booth right over there, in front of the window!  I’d be happy to act as your personal server, and...”
“I will address that momentarily,” Gabe continued.  “Because it brings me to the second reason I didn’t tell you. While I have no doubt you would have kept the source of your information private?  I also sincerely believe that you would have urged others to bring this news to the general public.  And that, dear brother, would have been a disaster.”
“Good,” Cass replied.  “I really have to go to the bathroom.  I have for a bit, but you were sleeping so soundly and had me wrapped up so tight that I couldn’t get out of bed.”
Dean looked over at Angel and found he couldn’t say the words.  “I’ll tell you later, ok?  My point is, I can’t imagine how my brother felt, watching himself doing those awful things.  Everything he was, it’s gone, trapped inside of his own mind.  He’s been trapped for a year.  I have to save him!”
“Cybernetic enhancements are worse,” I explained. “They’re super expensive, so the only way you get them is if you’re rich or you’re in the military.  If you’re rich, you can get private, untracked enhancements.  But if you’re a dirt-poor slob like me, you pretty much have to join the military to get ‘em.  And not many do that willingly anymore, not once word got out about the enhancements. That’s why nearly all of the veterans from my generation forward were drafted, like I was.  The only way to get out of a draft was if you bought yourself out, which meant, once more, that nearly all the active military was lower income bracket.”
At the sound of Castiel’s gravelly voice, I immediately popped up, smoothly banging my head off of the bottom of the hood.  I winced, rubbed at the bump, and managed to smile.  “Hey, Cas!  You need something?”
Hello from COVID island!  Out of the hospital, woop woop!  One unfortunate side effect, of the disease or the meds who knows, that I have noticed is memory issues.  I had no idea what day today was.  I thought it was Wednesday.  It's like the days in the hospital didn't count.  Granted, I'm sleeping around 16-18 hours a day, so give me some credit here.  Anyway, sorry for the delay.  Have another chapter!
“Alright.”  Beneath him, Dean felt Cass’s body relax.  Based solely on Dean’s word, Cass was trusting him.  It made Dean’s heart ache.  “How did that go?”
I closed my eyes and sighed.  “I’m fine, Sammy.  I just needed some time to decompress before I go back in there, apologize to my brothers, and figure out what I can do to make sure Castiel doesn’t feel like a prisoner in his own home despite being exactly that!”
Dean laid back and closed his eyes.  His thoughts were moving a mile a minute.  Over and over, they returned to a single target - Alistair.  Cass had certainly put the screws to the corrupt cop.  But was he really out of commission? Just how much reach did Alistair have?  A fellow cop, just as corrupt, would be able to trace Baby’s plates if Cass was seen.  Cass’s name would have been on the police reports, too.  Had everything that happened at the cabin, all the stress Cass was under now, been because of Dean?
“Well, yes.  I’m in charge of transportation outside the dome.  All of the tunnel systems between the domes, as well as any movement above ground, all comes through me.  If Roman Enterprises wants Naomi’s labor camps moved to a new location to start on a new project, I’d be heavily involved.”
Castiel’s head was starting to ache.  He let Dean go and moved back.  “What’s wrong?  You found someone else?”
Silence.  Then Gordon began to laugh.  “Oh, that’s perfect!  He knows you’re after him, Ketch.  That means he’ll be prepared and ready to meet you in that barn.  You dumb son of a bitch, you don’t stand a chance!”
Michael had been right.  It was freezing on the roof.  He was wearing his trench coat, but the frigid air whipped through it, pierced the suit he was wearing, and chilled him to the bone.  He wouldn’t be able to stay out here long.  Oh well.  He couldn’t hide out here forever.  He knew he’d have to go back in and face whatever plans the others had made. But the truth of his situation was starting to sink in.  Castiel was once again without a capable bodyguard.  That meant he wouldn’t be permitted to leave the building.  He’d be shut away again, with only the rooftop as a poor substitute for the freedom of movement he’d gotten accustomed to with Dean.
Dean told him.  “Bobby, listen, about this plan you had,” he began.  “Angel’s just about come around now, and...”
“It’s not so bad,” I assured him, slipping an arm around his shoulders as we started walking back towards the bar.  “You can keep working on it, and we’ll stay with Bobby until I can get us a place. That is, if you want to stay with me?”
Crowley rolled his eyes.  “You realize you’re going to be charged for this service?  Your current control hub was included with the original cost of your laborer’s contract.  But a new hub will be extra.”
“Quite a few, I’d imagine,” Balthazar said.  “Naomi had a demon captive that actually helped us get through Crowley’s defenses.  I released her as payment when we were finished...”
Dean had no warning.  He’d been standing back near Ellen, watching everything Crowley did and trying to pretend he wasn’t wondering where Cass was.  Then suddenly he was falling to his knees, his nerves sizzling from a level two shock.
That was how Charlie Bradbury ended up trailing slightly behind and to the right of Gabriel Novak, her hair dyed chestnut brown, wearing a repurposed laborer collar, heels, and a hastily-acquired dress skirt as they walked through the doors of the main office headquarters of Roman Enterprises.
“Thank you,” Castiel said politely, accepting the keys.  “It’s nice to know that there’s one thing you thought was worth keeping.”
“And how do you propose to do that?” Ketch asked, raising an eyebrow.  “You were quite adamant that you didn’t know how to find him.”
The night seemed to press in.  The road they traveled was dark, and all but deserted.  That raised another question.  “Hey, Cass?” he tried again.  “Where’s Rufus?”
A sudden force threw him violently to the side.  “Castiel, I’m surprised!” Lucifer called.  His eyes were still glowing a baleful red.  “I suppose it was too much to wish that you’d stay out of matters that don’t concern you.”
“Because if the angels currently fighting our guards have their way, we’ll have little time for that to happen,” Castiel pointed out.
“No.”  Dean stared into his glass.  “He never should have had this life.  It’s pretty much all I’m good for, but Sammy should have been more.”
Novak rubbed the back of his neck.  “Dean had, um, problems at the house with some of my siblings.  I didn’t want to leave him there with them.  And I wanted him with me.  Your brother, he means a lot to me.  He always has.  Bringing him to the office, making him an executive laborer?  Not only did it mean I could keep him with me, but it also gave me a bit of a status boost.”
Dean shook his head.  “Look, Cas.  You know so little about the world.  You don’t understand people.  Touching you, kissing you the way I did, making love to you, how could you ever consent to letting me do any of that?!”
“Dean, think!  Charlie made sure that your auction would draw minimal attention.  What the hell was a top-level executive doing even looking at an outskirts laborer auction?”
Dean didn’t look happy, but he nodded and stood up, keeping between Castiel and Lucifer while Lucifer continued to struggle. “What’s the casualty count?” he called.
It certainly put a big enough hole in the wall above where Dean was trying to crawl into a better position.
“It is,” Dean confirmed, taking the flowers.  “I’ve never really been a flowers guy, but I do appreciate the gesture.  Come on in.”
“I did no such thing.  Had he simply greeted me, I would have spoken to him, answered what questions I could before I took you.”
“Not really,” Dean admitted.  “And if Cass is as big a threat to Rooney’s ambitions as you think he is?”
Dazed green eyes blinked open, fixed on me. The pale face went even paler.  He made strangling sounds and clutched at my jacket.  “You... You’re...!”
Thinking of Dean made Castiel look around. There.  The gorgeous bodyguard was sitting on the floor in the corner, watching Castiel work.  His shining green eyes were full of wonder.  “I will never get over watching you work like this, Cas,” he called. “You, flying around through all this glowy stuff?  You really do look like an angel!”
Dean grabbed for the box of kleenex on the bed and handed some to Castiel.  Castiel mopped his face, blew his nose, and got a hold of himself.  “The problem is this,” Castiel began.  “Letting you go isn’t going to be easy.  We’re moving in two days.  Crowley will be coming back to take charge of your hub.  That means you’ll be linked to me.  We’ll remain here, helping with the packing while he installs it in our new home.  Then we’re expected to follow.”
Watching Dean and Mick trying to fit load after load of clothing and other items into the car, Castiel had been forced to admit that he might have gone a bit overboard.  Dean probably didn’t need the nail grooming kit.  But on the ride home, the rest of what Dean had said finally sunk in.  Where, exactly, would Dean store all of his new belongings?  There was a small closet in the room over the garage, but it wasn’t nearly big enough.  Well, Dean could store most of his everyday things there, especially if he had him bring back the dresser from the spare bedroom.  He’d have to have Dean bring the bed back over, too.  Which meant he’d have to have Dean bring Castiel’s office furniture back into the spare room.  But then, wouldn’t Dean wonder why Castiel didn’t just house him in the room?
“Alright, we’ll start there.  Breakfast bar, please?”  Michael nodded in thanks when he was handed an opened breakfast bar, waving off the staff member who explained she’d been trying to get Castiel to eat for half an hour.  Still forcing a reluctant Castiel forward with an arm around his shoulders, Michael put the breakfast bar into Castiel’s hand.  “Alright, you eat this,” he ordered, physically lifting the hand with the breakfast bar towards Castiel’s mouth.  “I will get your things and help you get ready.”
His old trench coat still fit well.  Castiel slid it on, picked up his bag, and headed out.  He got a few more hugs from some of the staff, some more well wishes exchanged.  Then he was outside.  He had no idea, really, where he was going.  The staff had given him some possibilities, a couple of halfway houses and the bus schedule.  He’d manage, he figured.  He’d always managed before.  He’d take a bus, get settled down somewhere, get a job and get back on his feet.  After that, well, he’d go where the road took him.  After all, he had nothing left to loose.
Gabriel lifted the bottle and held it to the light, much like Dean had done earlier.  “For an empty bottle, it sure seemed to give you a start.”
“...But we don’t have to be enemies!” Ketch insisted.  “I know that you oppose the rule of the angels.  That’s why you want Winchester, right?  Because he’s Michael’s chosen candidate?  And now the King of Hell has your friend.  We can help each other.”
Despite there being a wide variety of potential projectiles in her office, she had yet to throw anything at him, even when Dean himself would have given her a free pass.
“Winchester, that is enough!”  Now Michael was yelling.  “I understand you’re upset.  It’s clear that you honestly do care for Castiel, and your actions recently have earned you a certain amount of leeway.  But you know that someone in your rank and position does
Dean looked at Ketch.  The bodyguard or whatever he was had gone back to his stiff posture by the door.  Dean eyed him.  “So, you got any cards?”
“What do you think?” Azazel asked.  “Novak got a thing for the guy?  We didn’t have any indication he was a homo, but Winchester’s a very pretty boy.”
At first, he was sure it couldn’t be the same Sam Winchester.  But a quick check on the ID number confirmed it. This was Sam Winchester, who had briefly attended the same school as Castiel.  The same Sam Winchester who had stood up for Castiel when no one, not even his brothers, had been able or willing to do so.  Sam Winchester, who had vanished as mysteriously as he’d appeared at the end of the school year.  Sam, his friend for one year, one brief moment in Castiel’s life that he’d never forgotten.  Now here Sam was, convicted and sentenced for burglary, assault and battery, extensive property damage and weapons offenses all related to drugs.  Castiel’s heart had ached.  Brave, strong, gentle Sam, brought so low over drugs?  Up for auction as a laborer for anyone to buy his contract and work him into the ground?  What if he was bought by one of those unscrupulous types Castiel had sometimes heard about on the news, the ones that used, exploited, and abused those under contract, even forcing them into outright slavery or prostitution?
“Why not?” Cass challenged.  “It’s perfectly clear that you’re not comfortable with me.  It’s best for both of us if you went away.”
Dad Shurley took us to, of all places, the roof.  Summer was rapidly coming to an end, and the wind had a bit of a bite to it.  It stirred his snowy white curls and beard, put roses in his cheeks, and caused all three of us to huddle into our company jackets.
The resulting screams made Dean’s ears hurt even through the ear plugs he’d put in under his balaclava.
Castiel had been paying no attention to anything being said.  His eyes were fixed on the wireless jack in the other staff member’s hand.  He plugged in quickly once it was handed over, activating his lab, and rose into the air to start to work.
It wasn’t an idle threat.  Samandriel had been starved when he’d been first captured, left weak and fainting from hunger.  It wasn’t until he’d also lost control of his bladder that the demons had finally believed he’d been telling the truth about just how weak he really was.  Now, somehow, that had changed.
“It’s a walk.  There shouldn’t be a right or wrong way to take a walk!  Bartholomew, are you satisfied, you prick?!”
In the corner of his vision, Castiel could see his indicator bar.  Already it was at two-thirds capacity, and visibly rising.  Alright.  He focused, feeling the familiar warmth as his augmented nervous system fell in line. But over and over again, each new configuration failed.  The answer was eluding him.  Castiel ground his teeth.  What was he missing?
“Hold up,” Sam said.  “I’m still not convinced that a direct attack is the way to go.  Chuck, you said there were two ways to do this?”
She pinched her lips.  “That’s not our Angel Castiel!  I did notice his hair was a mess, but I assumed it was because he’d been lying down. What kind of readings did you get?”
“I got it.  Lips sealed, and go along with whatever he wants.”  Dean sighed.  “So when do you think he’ll take me?”
“What are you doing, Cas?”  Dean, coming in to check on him.  “Dammit, would you get off the jack?!  You’re supposed to be resting!”
“Shit!”  Dean was climbing out of bed, ignoring the pain of his just-healed injuries in favor of getting to Castiel.  “Cas!  Ok!  Ok, calm down!  I’m sorry I yelled at you.  Come on, don’t go out on me, just, I don’t know, come up onto the bed, alright?”
The amber eyes were troubled.  “I know you two quarreled, Samoose, but he’s your brother! All those things you’ve said about him, how great he is?  We could really use his help, especially now!  Did Luc tell you what we found?”
“Roman himself, of course,” Novak said, thinking.  “Michael could have done it.  One of his high-level workers, because they run the closed auctions.  But that’s unlikely, because Michael would have had to authorize it.  The only other person who might have been able to do it is...”
Castiel looked away, and I nodded.  “I’m sorry, buddy,” I said softly.  “I know this has to hurt, and I’m sure it’s the last thing you need right now.  But the sooner you face facts, see the other Angels for what they really are?  The sooner you’ll realize that this is the best thing that ever could have happened to you!”
Castiel tightly gripped the arms of his chair.  “You know what those drugs do to people.  Sam would never hurt anyone if he wasn’t under the influence.  He’s not violent, he’s just an addict.  He doesn’t need beaten, he needs help!”
“I know, but I had to do something, didn’t I?  I couldn’t let you go in there!”  He sighed, casting a worried look at the door before returning his attention to Castiel.  “I know, you’re worried about him the same as I am.  Your feet are going to find their way here because for some reason you are out of your section.  I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that Gabe and Raph are roaming around down here, too because we’re all worried!  But our favorite pain in the ass negotiations specialist Angel has been jacked in, busy working with Huis, all day.  You know how long we’ve been working for this.  He’s pushed himself too hard, and he ended up going into overload.  And now I have to deal with it!”  Lucifer indicated the wireless jack that protruded from his temple.  “And of course he’s resisting control, as usual.  And that means that any minute now...  Yup, there it is,” he called as his eyes turned glowing red and the sound of “Music Box Dancer” again played from the speakers.  Now the red indicator above the doors was blinking along with the white.  Lucifer winced.  “Gotta love it!”
“Good choice,” I called.  “We’re all basically in mourning for our brother, taking time to get used to this new version of Castiel.  The sooner we acknowledge the differences, the better.”
Dean was fast alright.  He had Castiel out of the car and was not-quite-running with him through the narrow channel the security team had created through the crowd. Flashes were all around them. Shouted questions assaulted their ears. Getting into the relative safety of Heaven’s lobby was a welcome relief.
Rooney shoved him into the car, dove behind the wheel, and immediately started the engine.  Although he triggered the garage door, he didn’t bother waiting until it was fully opened.  The engine roared, shoving under it with a scream of tortured metal and continuing to move.
Balthazar shrugged.  “Even she knows when she’s outmatched.  I suspect she’ll go running straight to Michael, start organizing an attack.  So don’t worry, Mr. Winchester.  Your big angel battle is sure to come soon.”
“...And no one was the wiser.  Until now.”  Angel shook his head.  “That’s why it doesn’t make sense!”
“Dean,” Castiel began, “you and I are going to be spending a great deal of time together.  We should set some ground rules.”
Luc grabbed the camera and tossed it to one of his men in the back of the truck.  “You do the filming.”
Castiel waited until Dean had finished eating and was washing up.  The candidate had been quiet and sullen as he’d cooked and eaten breakfast.  He still was now as he cleaned up.  When Castiel had mentioned stepping out, Dean had only grunted something about not letting the door hit him in the ass.
“Yes, yes he has.  But it’ll be just fine in a minute or two, now the handlers are in there.  Mmm, yeah, the sooner the better.  But meanwhile, let’s talk about you, Cassie.”  He tightened his grip on Castiel’s arm and started walking, leading him away from Michael’s working and living quarters.  “Tell me, how the hell did you get over here?! Where’s your bodyguard?!”
“For now, I just want you to keep your eyes and ears open, and report everything you see and hear back to me, no matter how innocent it may seem,” Ketch ordered.  “Don’t trust anyone, not even your brother.  He’s been with Nicholas long enough that he trusts him.  I’m sure he’s a wonderful boy,” he added, seeing Dean bristle, “but he’s a child, Dean.  Nicholas genuinely wants to adopt him.  Your brother shouldn’t be in any danger,” he leaned closer to Dean, “unless you put him into danger.”
Once he was safely inside and sitting on the hotel bed, the angel had poked forlornly at the cast, realized he couldn’t easily remove it, and focused his attention to the splint on his wrist.
“Um, ok.”  What the actual fuck was happening?  This was the perfect time to be honest with Cass.  He needed to tell Cass that he’d only said what he’d said to Gabe because he’d believed, at the time, that Gabe was also threatening Sammy.  Now he was fairly certain neither of the youngest Novak brothers were any threat to his own brother, Dean needed to clear that up.  It wasn’t fair to lead Cass on.  The poor guy needed to know Dean wasn’t batting for his team.  But instead, Dean found himself nodding and heading into his room for a clean shirt.
“Then what’s your problem, boy?  Castiel would love you if you’d let him.  Do you have any idea how much I’d give for that?  How dare you, Sam?  You think I haven’t seen the way you look at him?  That isn’t friendship.  That’s something else.”
Luc smiled.  “He’s completely out of overload, but he’s exhausted.  Alfie’s staying with him, and Raph, of course.  We put him in bed to rest, listen to music and finish calming down.  I actually wanted to talk to the two of you, but especially you, Dean.  Can I call you Dean?  Great!  Dean, look at me.”  He jerked his head back towards the cabin, his expression serious.  “Today my second youngest brother disappeared from a moving car. And when we found him, he was in overload, and worse.  Alfie’s got him over the worst of it, but he says that there’s something seriously wrong with his mind.  His Angel blade is missing and that’s bad enough, but Gabe said he actually tried to stab him?!”
“Exactly.  Sam could pass as Dean to any normal scrutiny, but look too hard?  Too much about that identity would not match.  We’re talking physical descriptions, fingerprints, photographs...  That’s why dad had such a hard time making us new identities.  I was just a kid, but I still remember all the phone calls and secret meetings and moving from one safehouse to another...”
“Professor Kevin Tran.  Sorry, I should have told you that when you gave me your name.  Now Dean...”
Cass jerked him close and kissed him again.  “I will get you out of this,” he vowed.  “You and me.  We’ll do it like you said, smart, so no one catches on until it’s too late.  But if there’s any chance at all that your cover is blown?”
“Cas?  Cas!”  He twisted, strained around, and then froze, staring wide-eyed at the still, silent group of Angels around Castiel.  “Holy fuck, they’re all in overload!”
Lucifer chuckled.  “Why Cassie, I’m surprised!  I’ll admit, I always thought you were rather dull.  Wouldn’t have imagined you to have it in you to be all plotty and sneaky, trying to steal Michael’s vessel out from under him!”
“I’m sorry, Sam,” Chuck apologized, pocketing the remote.  “But another laborer can’t be present for this.  Mike, Luc?  Get him upstairs, please.”
After all these years, he could still perfectly picture the blue eyes, deep and beautiful and looking right at him.
“Except you found him,” Cass theorized, “and they knew, if he survived, he’d be able to tell someone what really happened.  So they arranged to have him arrested, and you took his place.”
“So it would appear,” Dean noted.  Cass’s arm around his shoulders was making his heartrate spike.  He licked his lips.  Time to think of something, anything, else that could distract him from just how close he was to Cass right now.  What had they just been talking about?  Oh, right, food.  That was good.  He’d think of food, and not how close Cass was, or how good the aftershave smelled on his neck.  “What are you hungry for?” Dean asked.  “We’ve got...”
But then Dean was holding a door directing Castiel into a Biggerson’s restaurant and com center, and Castiel’s anxiety returned.  “Dean, what are we doing here?”
“Of course.”  The lawyer rolled his eyes and returned his attention to Dean.  “I think the best advice I can give you is to keep those pretty lips together.  It’s been my experience that every time you speak, you dig yourself deeper into a hole.”
“I’m his bodyguard,” Dean confirmed, not looking at me despite the look I was giving him.  “The way Cas is now, he needs constant care.  I provide that.”
Movement from the corner of his eye.  With a gasp, Dean shoved Cass as hard as he could, falling to the ground on top of the startled soldier just as the thunder of gunfire filled the hall.  Bullets flew over his head, barely missing a startled Rooney.  Then he heard a cry of pain, and looked over to see Ketch fall heavily to the ground.  “Dammit!” a familiar voice shouted.  “Mikey, what the fuck?  Novak was supposed to kill Rooney, why the hell is he so focused on that kid?!”
He opened the door and came face to face with the frowning, bearded face of his father.  “Castiel, what’s this I hear about you buying a laborer contract?”
“You’ll be driving me to formal events,” Castiel explained absently.  The emerald green tie went into the cart. “Naturally, you’ll have to look the part.”
Dean twisted free and caught Cass’s shoulders with both hands.  “Listen to me.  Is there a valid reason you might have been called in here today?”
“Yes, thank you very much.”  He dared to touch Dean, grasping the laborer’s bicep.  Dean froze.  “I don’t want you to be hurt.  I don’t want my brothers to beat you, or my sister to do anything you don’t want.  I’m the one who owns your contract.  So ultimately, you answer to me, not to them.  If you have any questions, any concerns?  Please come to me.”
