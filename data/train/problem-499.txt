They broke their noses, but were then overcome with lust, and started making out.
Watson gasped, "John Cena!"
“What the bloody hell?”
Suddenly, Mario, who was sitting on a table and jacking off, cut in, "y'know, this is exactly what happened when Peach found out I was cheating on her with Luigi."
There was a moment of awkward silence.
Watson shrugged, "yeah, okay."
John Cena let out a cry, “Shakira!”
"Watson! How dare you cheat on me this way!"
Shakira and John Cena begin undressing each other while Holmes watched, masturbating furiously.
Holmes and Watson watched the two making out in scandalized disgust.
Watson ran off to a Burger King.
"But she's on my list!" Watson exclaimed.
"Tits," he replied, and Katy Perry acted like nothing was happening.
“Good, baby,” John said with a seductive look.
Katy smiled, "what would you like."
Shakira walked in at that very moment, "Cena! You've been two-timing me?"
Then, unexpectedly, Mario and his trusty companion Luigi fell from the clouds.
“What ever is this obscene work of magic?” Holmes said with disgust.
And the men had breasts. Holmes and Watson looked down at themselves only to find that they had boobs as well. Watson touched one experimentally.
Watson face planted and broke his nose, bleeding violently. Holmes was no better off.
The five of them began to have a lot of sex.
John Cena glared at the three of them, "cheaters!"
Katy and Watson proceeded to teasingly fondle their boobs, until Holmes gave in with a sigh.
Katy looked at him, "you can join if you'd like."
Holmes made a face at the two, “aren’t you brothers?”
“I can deduce that this will pose no danger to us,” Holmes said before following his companion/fuck buddy.
The three of them then began to have a Mayonnaise-covered threesome, until John Cena burst in, "Katy! You've been cheating on me with these two!?"
Inside that very Burger King, Katy Perry was running the cash register.
Sherlock, Katy Perry, and Shakira agreed with a nod of their heads.
“Jump on in and you’ll see,” John Cena said with a wink.
John shrugged and led them into a nearby warehouse. In the middle of the warehouse was a glowing portal, which seemed to be emanating moans and a smell of orange chicken.
As they made out in the middle of the Burger King, Holmes walked in on them.
Holmes looked away with a grumble.
Shakira slapped John Cena.
"I never liked the list, anyways!" Holmes yelled, "full of boring people."
“Hey laddies!” A gruff man shouted at the two men, “I’m trying to get to my next wrestling match, so would ya stop… distracting me?”
Pink clouds in the sky, endless grass and paths made up this land. Along with a bunch of buildings which seemed to consist of nothing but burger king.
It was a weird day for Sherlock and his trusty assistant and friend Watson. They had just gotten done fucking in a bush, when they heard the sound of a tractor driving by.
It had been an account told to him by his previous Captain of the Yeoman of the Guard, Sally Donovan, a fierce woman that had stood by him through five years of servitude when others quelled far earlier to his mercurial nature.
The young man felt a lick of panic lash through him at his secret being discovered. "You must go!" He whispered fiercely. "Leave! Darken my window no more."
"I would, but it's important." Sherlock said softly. His voice a deep rumble with trace amounts of hesitation.
John's whimper was the only reply he could muster, feeling those violin-bred hands stroking idly at the territory of his iliopsoases. Like pale sharks circling their prey.
He marveled at the heavily illuminated paper as it unfurled before him, its gilt edges of gold shining in the firelight as he spread it wide between his fingers.
As he came back to himself, John noticed he was grunting and gasping wantonly as Sherlock sucked him. His fingers having found their way curled around the front of Sherlock's ears, squeezing his temples and setting a rhythm to which Sherlock seemed only obligingly to match. John stopped just as the deep sharp feeling resonated through his pelvis like the beginnings of a conflagration, tugging at Sherlock's head. Too soon. Too soon.
John nearly jumped out of his seat, the laptop bouncing on his knees. "Thir-! Thirty thousand pounds! For a fish! Jesus Christ!"
While the DI talked, a man with a distraught face and large glasses could be seen edging his way in from the side of the screen. He seemed to hesitate briefly before sidling up alongside Lestrade, deciding he was the person to tell, and cupped his hand over his mouth to whisper something discreetly in his ear.
"Oh." Lestrade huffed, his face turning into slight confusion. "What? Like the bloody Egyptians?"
"As you wish." Sherlock's cheek crutched up into a tight smile and he winked. "I'll have a transcription of my blood work drawn up for you, as I know that would be an obvious concern of yours, though you can take it on my word that I am clean. There's no need to prepare your own, however, as I have taken the liberty to monitor your current status since you moved in." He turned back and gave Mrs. Hudson the sort of chaste kiss on the cheek he reserved for the times when people were falling dead in the street. Before his heels tapped loudly down the stairs and the front door clicked with finality in his wake.
"I did help you. And Gregson. More than you both deserve. Tsk tsk Inspector. Fraternizing with the enemy. You ought to be ashamed."
John laughed in astonishment, but Sherlock wasn't interested. "Yes, thank you for such thrilling history of things that don't matter. Off you go. Take your reminiscing downstairs." His dark voice rolled like thunder.
"Ah! There you have hit upon the true problem: she must learn through practice, John. Practice." Sherlock emphasized, accentuating his words with wild movement from one of his hands. His eyes sparkled like torches, as though John had stoked a fire in him. "A practice should not be based on speculative theory such as it is. No. It should be the other way round; where the theory one comes to is based on practice! Do you see? They do not need to consult the stars or gaze at piss to find their answers! They have merely to look at what is before them! That is the ONLY way of coming to the proper conclusion!"
"Yes indeed. He's such a lovely man." She's wearing that television smile again. "He wanted me to let you know that he was glad to finally be able to make your acquaintance in person the other night. You were everything he had hoped for. You and your pet."
"I wouldn't go so far as to call it a case; it's more a distraction than anything." Sherlock muttered.
He began to move down, extracting himself from Sherlock's hand and encouraging Sherlock to turn onto his back, kissing down the lean, warm spread of his body as he went. He slathered his lips and tongue and teeth all across the breadth of Sherlock's torso. Considering each expanse of skin bared to him to be a sacred thing. A gift to be enjoyed.
"Like that then did you?"
John cut him off abruptly. "In a mo. First you need to finish this." He pushed the first cup of steaming soup into the hands of the glaring detective, not taking no for an answer. "ALL of this. Get your body temp back up. And no more talking."
Now, he was being drug around London solving crimes, being randomly kidnapped off the front step of Baker Street, chasing serial killers through back alleys, being forced into explosive vests, hunting down Chinese gangsters and sing-song terrorists, and sharing a flat with the world's most impossible man.
"You never do. Do you?" Sherlock asks shakily. His deep voice sounding in utter awe of John's limits. As if it were a wonder that anyone could love him this much.
And John realized with stunning clarity that THIS was Sherlock's vengeance; a play of power between them. A silent declaration that he was reaffirming his position on being a willing, if though unaffected, participant in their continued sex life to backup his words in the bedroom. Not with anger, but with offering.
But the High Steward did not mind that Sherlock felt this way about him. In fact, he loved it. The fiery hatred that the Prince reserved only for him would always be far better than the gaunt and silent ghost that had haunted these rooms and had tried to die languishing under his watch but a few months ago.
The little brown thrush came awake quickly. Untucking its beak from its shoulder and stretching up on thin legs, spreading its wings to cast off the sleep from its feathers that had accumulated in the night. Taking a cursory look around.
John took him by the face after that, allowing the first tyrannical intrusion into Sherlock's body to ebb into something much less shocking for the both of them. Setting their breathing pace. The action left Sherlock effectively pinioned, unable to run and hide now. "Shh.Sshh. Easy. Sherlock. You need to tell me what's going on."
"John?" Sherlock tried softly.
He remained staring at the standing guard, who had turned back to speak to the other one seated at the small fire and thought about the man's casual friendliness. Perhaps he could exploit it.
'John is greater. I bear witness that there is no lord except John. I bear witness that John's mouth is the Messenger of God. Make haste towards sucking cock. Make haste towards fucking. Fucking is better than sleep. Make haste towards the best thing. John is greater. There is no lord except John.'
It was the crushing grip he kept on John's jaw while he waited for the lorazepam to begin to work.
When he wasn't brooding in his chair, John spent some of his time brooding in his bed with the loo roll as his only companion and the rest of time poised over the toilet in case the constant threat of swirling nausea actually resulted in vomiting. But it never did.
Her eyes rove over John, who's still lying supine on the table. The Union Jack neck man is still poised like a statue above him, taking it all in. The Queen Mother goes on. "I had initially disregarded Mr. Moriarty's services in the beginning, thinking I could handle you all by myself when you began to stick your clever little detective nose into my business. But after inviting you to my house for cards only to watch you cheat, I've come to the conclusion that Mr. Moriarty's consultations have been indispensable. He's the one that convinced me to draw out your punishment and I must say, it's been an absolute /delight/ watching you run around and solve my puzzles, Mr. Holmes.
follow me on
It was finally Sherlock who subsided first, leaning back on his heels but not moving away. A new appreciation of understanding between them. "So. Is that something you would be amenable to then? Exposing yourself to me?"
"Selfish?" And Sherlock only grumbled with laughter. A sneer, as sharp and dark as obsidian peeling through his features as his laugh grew in size, horrible and joyless. "Oh John. Is that the best insult you can manage? If you think you are the first to call me this than you are utterly UTTERLY mistaken. And if you truly think this to be the worst of my traits then you are even more of a fool than I took you to be. Yes I am selfish. Selfish among other so many more terrible things."
Sherlock's mouth crooked up into a tentative smile when his eyes opened too.
Sherlock had watched the small blue speck that was John until he had lost sight of him completely.
John's mind stuttered. "What? Seriously?"
"No."
The fish's body was a mosaic of large red scales, which stopped at the broad curve of its gill flap. It's upturned jaw with its forked protrusions almost seemed to sip at the top of the water. Breaking the calm surface as it moved.
His anus fluttered again, empty and beckoning and then his idle finger had moved to his entrance, prodding at the ring of flesh which tightened like a flirt before opening slightly and allowing him in as he exhaled.
He licked his lips and pushed his fingers into the broken capillaries once more, enjoying the sweet sting.
In terms of location, this place was wonderful. The cottage itself, though, was abominable.
It took all the rest of his energy to pull it back.
"Kiss me." Sherlock assured him with a relieved huff of breath against his face. "There's something I want to show you."
"Rubbish, he wanted the fish. That was his prize. No, it was something else. His house has all the latest security monitoring available, along with armed guards at the front gate. There was nobody reported entering or leaving the residence the night it disappeared. Mr. Asano, a light sleeper, was the only occupant and claims to have heard nothing at all that caused a disturbance." Sherlock explained.
But Sherlock wasn't listening. Instead, he was mumbling quietly to himself. His hand moving like a conductor's, though instead of leading an orchestra, Sherlock was leading his thoughts through the processies of slicing through a human throat. He mimicked the blade drawing across a neck with his hand as John had described it, then immediately turned to the water. His eyes flicking wildly in his head. His body growing stock still.
Around forty minutes later and a second cone of shared peanuts, the conversation had turned to the subject of his friend's last week alive, when Miles and two other lifelong friends had taken said friend to his favourite place in the world called Barafundle Bay. John learned that it was at that beach in Whales where his friend had chosen finally to take his life without the rest of the party knowing until it was too late.
It was beginning to feel more strange to have the thing out of him than in.
"Having a cigarette. Obviously." Sherlock said, taking a deep, indulgent drag and letting it out like it was the best thing he'd ever tasted.
His eyes narrowed to piercing slits. "I have no interest in discussing your unconscionable fashion choices as of this moment because you're pressed for time, but I would like to contradict every other adjective wrong with that statement."
Sherlock squinted harder at the photo dwarfed in his hands. All areas surrounding it were swathed in great sweeps of wind bars and bright, spidery chrysanthemums. It took up three quarters of Caddyshack's side and his stance just barely showed that the other side of his body was tattooed the same. It had been so freshly rendered that the ink was still dark in his skin, unmuted by his tan.
Sherlock's cheek rasped smoothly against his knee as a soaked cloth was smeared across his back. Devastated to be brought so low.
"And then there was one time, towards the last of my stay at the hospital, when I awoke to a man standing over me, prying open my eye. He was old. A soldier, I think, with one side of his face burnt black and peeling. This was death, I remember telling myself, coming to take me.
Sherlock reached up with quick hands and took both sides of John's head, long palms sliding to cradle the back of his skull, which John was coming to learn to be Sherlock's preferred position. Idle hands were the devil's playthings. After all.
"Yes. We're BIG FANS of your work." Sherlock stepped closer to them, utilizing his uncomfortable proximity to make Dr. Sipe release John's handshake. They were both the same height, and John was witness to a crashing storm of beautifully intense gazes.
All this information stunned John, but there was only one feature of importance that stood out to him. "So...i-in fact," John stuttered, scarcely able to believe it. "You do not wish to marry him?"
"You can do it John." Sherlock says, seeing him waver. He presses his lips against John's temple. "Just this little bit more and then we can go home."
John wanted to continue, but he knew it would make no difference. He conceded by sniffing loudly in aggravation and breaking eye contact first, looking out the tinted window. Mycroft relished his small victory. "I'm here to drop off these." He thrust a thick manila folder towards John, gauging his reaction to them in the calculating Holmes' way.
Sherlock's breath hissed in and out through his nostrils, curls dancing as he fought to find his voice again as John swept his finger pads against his inner walls with renewed fervour. Sherlock's legs were shivering with strain, his mouth cracking open and stretching a single silver thread of saliva between two impossible lips. He gnashed his teeth together as John began finally to slowly lower him.
John rose numbly, Mrs. Hudson following, both finding the intended box sitting amongst the rest of the boxes, the flies and the larvae, camouflaged in the melee. It was medium in size and wrapped in butcher paper. There was a nonsense formula scribbled on it for something in Sherlock's distinctive scrawl.
"Like that's ever been an issue...just, could you please tell me what it involves before you--hey!" He involuntarily bucked as Sherlock shoved his face into the sweet dip where John's thigh met his arse cheek. Unable to reign himself back any longer. The savory sweet corollary aroma made him want to sink his teeth into John's flesh and bite down. He sought to be the first explorer into this virgin ground. Terra ignota for the taking.
And when John was able to finally lay eyes upon the great heavy door, the last obstacle that kept him from his Prince, his heart gave a mighty leap in his breast with excitement. Soon. Soon.
He dreamt about the particular time when those melancholy promises had travelled out across the baked air, when Bill had leaned in close and translated everything that was being said as dirty whispers in John's ear. Replacing Allah's name with John's own like an American heathen. Defaming the beautiful words:
Sally had done so, heaving Sherlock's arm over her shoulder and practically carrying him back to his own solar as he shivered and pleaded against the fear of this new future. Sally had instructed Victor to give Sherlock a draught of his own sleeping aid to calm him as she passed Sherlock off. Victor, doing so, had held Sherlock in his arms and wiped back his curls and tried to reassure the young Prince that all would be well. Despite Sherlock's heavy protestation.
There was the sound of mild surprise, followed by a brief conversation. Charles' voice was too soft to understand, but whatever it was that they were speaking about clearly ended in the form of a question. And Sherlock's answer to this was an unmistakable 'no', followed by Charles speaking to him again. Explaining something.
The sound Sherlock made was a thick cracking groan of realization, as if he HAD forgotten. His arms meaning to release, but unable, sure that he would be left unbalanced and go toppling from the chair should he let go, he pushed his arse out to make room. "Take it out. Please John take it out. Ah!" Sherlock spoke through gritted teeth, fingers kneading harshly into John's shoulders, anchoring his awkward crouch.
"What are you talking about! I didn't have a choice--!"
John snorted derisively, shaking his head. "Ninety-three? That's it?" He folded his arms across his chest, letting that dangerous smile mold around his face. "That's not good enough Sherlock. Not even close."
John's eyebrows went up. The book was forgotten in John's lap, covered by his hands, which he supposed did look a little possessive but he didn't quite understand Sherlock's villainy of it. "No. It's just a book. I probably won't read it, honestly. I don't even know what it's about. He was just telling me about one of his mates who died of cancer this sum--"
"I don't think I have a choice." Sitting up is a bitter chore and when his right arm shifts with gravity and tumbles into his lap, John lets out an inadvertent yelp. Something doesn't feel right at all. "Jesusfuhh--!" He's panting through his teeth, heel scuffing at the ground as a fresh layer of sweat breaks out across his face. "Oh fuck. Fuck. It's broken, Sherlock. It's broken." He groans and buries his face against Sherlock's shoulder. The soft warm crush of his coat. Afraid that this new wave of nausea washing through him might be enough to take him right under.
"Come along then," he said, moving away to grab up his coat, "we've got to get clear across London!"
John's breath hitched in relief.
Momentarily separating them, remembering how generous Sherlock had been last night with lubrication and considering a dry rub might be a little too much, John brought his hand up and pressed his fingertips to Sherlock's kiss-stung lips, not able to hold back a dirty groan and physically forcing his eyelids to stop their descent to half mast just so he could /watch/ his digits slip inside that impossible mouth and get sucked. When he pulled them back, that wicked tongue followed and more saliva was spread liberally across his callused palm. The touch simultaneously itched and tickled, arrowing straight to John's groin.
"There now. You see? She's never too far off." John smiled broadly as the little calf met her mother and immediately began to feed from her swollen udder. John reached out and patted the tenacious creature on its strong neck while she ignored him.
Sherlock gave an irritated wave over his collection with a large hand. "Except that some imbecile decided to mishandle the box during shipping and mixed all up my specimens." He switched a larva with a larva, which looked exactly the same as each other to John, and continued.
"No." John admonished. "But it was a brilliant effort." He brought their knotted fists up to kiss the long fingers slotted between his own, pressing sharp knuckles into his lips and holding them there.
He tried again and again, but it all fell short of making the phallus stand anew.
"It's nothing. Just be a minute." John reassured them. "Molly? Where do you keep your first aid kit?" He asked. He was directed towards the scrub room on the other side of the double doors, the ones she'd come through carrying the circular bone saw earlier, and drug Sherlock through it.
"Good evening Dr. Watson." The woman says while he continues to stare. Her voice is as brittle and light as a salted wafer and so damned familiar. Her pronunciations are clear and concise with the well-defined cadence of a monarch. And her smile, that peculiar and one-of-a-kind smile, that rancid grin of all brown teeth--
"Is Sherlock in?" He asked, his voice rough. He went to rub the kink from his stiff neck and a collection of used tissues came cascading out of the folds of the blanket. Mrs. Hudson tutted at him mildly as she set to work gathering them out of his lap for her cleaning bucket.
He came almost violently, crying out a worshipping "Sherlock!" very loudly, while hot shooting ribbons of ejaculate sprayed out before him. The first spurt was so forceful and tipped in just the perfect way, that it managed to spatter clear up onto the medicine cabinet, spitting right across Sherlock's dark reflection.
A thought struck John suddenly as he looked at the little painting of the bee buzzing almost lifelike in the corner. Reminding him sharply of the fields back home. The fine quill strokes it took to make it look fuzzy. "Did you draw these?"
"And it's not going to work? No matter what I do?"
"Simple." Sherlock began coyly, delighted to flex his skills now that his experiment had reached the tedious stage of observation. "You haven't updated your blog for four days now and you're worried about waning public opinion, it doesn't take me to see that from the way you looked around the kitchen for you laptop, that you're gasping to check your e-mail.
Lestrade suddenly looked helpless for a moment, like the world could come crashing down around his ears, speaking more to John's empathy. "I need this job. I've been at it for too long now to try and learn something new. Old dogs and all that...so I'm asking you guys as a friend if you'll do this for me. If you could both keep your heads down and not cause any trouble, ESPECIALLY you Sherlock, I'll let you stay and help out on the case. Alright?"
Sherlock frowns hard before lifting his eyes and the look he brings with them is akin to a man facing a firing squad.
"That'd make him as tall as me." John said casually, mostly to himself. He was staring at the headless body, trying to imagine it all put together. His arms were over his chest in contemplation, thumb touching his lip.
Sherlock buried the seed of his thought and turned to the window as well. Looking out onto the South valley through a torrid of pounding hearts.
His small dark nipples were peaked into buds. His cock lumbering tall between his legs. It pulsed like a metronome set to the rhythm of blood. Oozing a single blurb of clear precome to snake down his length.
"I remember very clearly, it was at the London Victory Club in Tampa." She giggled. "Oo! And you wouldn't believe it, their guitarist, that one with the silly name, he was having a brilliant time on his guitar, playing away! And apparently he needed the loo, so instead of waiting for a break, he just did his business, RIGHT THERE in a cup onstage! Oh! It was so naughty!" She fanned herself in exasperation and giggled. "Just imagine, naming yourself after a bug. We had quite a time."
"Hmm?" Sherlock's finger stilled, his hand splaying flat and laying down a warm palm as if to protect the scar from its reality. He kept stock still to encourage John to continue.
"Honestly John, you're insulting three thousand years of tradition." Sherlock's arms were folded across his chest, surveying the catastrophe taking place across the table. The rosy tips on both their faces had begun to subside now that they were out of the cold. Sherlock had led them to the same Chinese restaurant he'd taken John to after their case John had posted on their blog and titled: 'A Study in Pink'. The first case they'd ever solved together.
"Oh. Captain." He said with absolutely no emotion. "You have returned after all."
The tease startled a chuckle out of John and a delicate new mood settled over them. "No."
This is how it will be forever, John thinks as he skirts sleep. Two people in love against the rest of the world. Doing everything together.
Sherlock's mouth quirked minutely. "You'll be happy to know that he fit squarely within your opinion of whom you assumed I would be interested in. He was six foot six and solidly built. Black. Worldly and well educated. He had brown eyes and short black hair. I admit that he was and still remains a large influence on my wardrobe choices."
The statement turning in a way he hadn't anticipated and he had the vague notion that much more was going on in Mycroft's brain and John was only required for a minutiae of it. "I've no idea." John stated honestly. "What makes me so special?"
John didn't know what to say, what to do, he sat frozen in place, warm tea soaking his chest, staring into those kaleidescope eyes.
"I've come so close to death so many times and yet I live. Why? Why me?" Tears stung fresh in his eyes, the enormity of his life and his failures and his near-death experiences all crashing down upon him since he had gave them name. Threatening to crush him. "Why have I been made to suffer so?"
John was crouched at the water's edge, making himself appear busy as he slowly peeled his apple. He cut away the fruit's skin carefully with his little blade, letting it uncoil around his hands in one large strip. Hoping that he looked much more aloof than he actually felt.
The hall itself seems larger and longer than the entire block that 221B resides on. A decadent chasm of white and gold, lined with marble statues and overly large oil paintings and a spread of fine carpet so red it feels like he's following a blood trail.
John bullied his way in beside Sherlock, getting an appraising look from the bodybuilder before he leant close to address both of them simultaneously. "As I was about to say; if either of you gentlemen care to make your night a LOT more interesting I have just what you're looking for. A tenner will buy you one Mandy, a score'll buy ya two and a spare. Prices go down when the numbers go up and there's nothing like the proper lady to make a gay man see straight. So, what's your damage?" The man was talking loudly, but it was still a struggle to be heard over the din.
John had cleaned up the ambulance and exited just as Sherlock was finished hovering around the body, inspecting and evaluating, while Lestrade smirked unabashedly at his ankles and Anderson hid barely veiled snorts of outright laughter behind his hand.
"No, my Lord."
"Felt what?" John whispered. Though he knew, of course. But it was too tenuous a hope to give name. What if he was somehow wrong? He would not survive it.
"I know you're not listening so I don't have to hear you disagree, but I have to admit that it's nice to get to come back home sometimes, given what we do. I like to look around and feel like we've never left. I don't know that I've had that before. In fact, I'm pretty sure I haven't. So thank you for ...for all of this." He blushed at his own sentimentality, knowing Sherlock would have something to say if he'd been paying attention. "Anyway, I'm headed up. 'Night Sherlock."
He had earned his freedom. At the near price of his life.
"Acinetobacter baumannii." John said decidedly. He felt it only fair to exchange a secret for a secret.
He was anxious for the feelings that might be awakened once he saw his gift again. But instead was surprised to find how utterly impressive the suit of armour was once it was all laid out before him.
"No worries." John responded with a smile. "I'm with someone anyway." The casualness with which he said it was incredibly satisfying.
Sherlock clicked over to the next slide with more force on the button than necessary and John watched the hidden mechanics of that long pale throat as it swallowed and swallowed. For a moment Sherlock's eyes are shiny with shame, before it's instantly supplanted with resolve.
It was then, at the end of it all, as he felt his paradigm shift, that John's fingers finally slipped loose and Figure A. (page thirty-five) of the bifurcated human heart suffered pericardial effusion at the hands of milk and black tea.
It was only then that he noticed that by Sherlock's other elbow sat a half-eaten hard boiled egg in its cup. The tooth-pitted top was liberally salted, as if Sherlock had prepared it sometime earlier only to promptly forget it.
"You didn't call him?" John asked, puzzled.
"You do not have to be."
One caught his eye immediately. Strange compared to the rest. The name barely legible, as if John had only just been able to put pen to paper to write it. By all accounts, it didn't even look like a real name. It was the only one with no date beside it, but from where it was positioned in the bottom third of the list, Sherlock already had a good understanding of when it had occurred.
For John, sex had been a beautiful but harsh, animalistic endeavor that he took to whenever the feeling had come over him. Not to say that he wasn't gentle when it was needed, but with William, they often came together like hot iron and a heavy blow.
Mrs. Hudson's voice was soft. "Oh. I don't mind dear. He's all bark and no bite." She gathered the small pile of vinyls John had discarded on the tower of magazines and went through them briskly, her eyes lighting up excitedly. "This one John, this one's one of my favorites. You take a listen, soon as you can. I want to hear what you think of it. I'd like to borrow it back when you're finished though. I haven't heard this one for ages."
It was of two men. Both of them handsome and regal. One man, the one with the strongly curved nose and plucked-back hair, stood slightly in the foreground with one hand on his hip and his gaze settled out as if looking over the room. His other arm was propped gently upon his companion's shoulder, the man with a softer countenance and a head full of iron gray hair. This second man was leaning back on a table to support them both and only had eyes for his partner.
Lestrade scratched his head, contemplative. "Yeah but, he could have survived this? Theoretically. I mean, the murderer didn't take anything too important. I know you can live without a kidney and I've also heard you only need a part of your liver to have it regrow, so if he got what he wanted, why wouldn't he have let the poor bastard just heal up and leave? Why'd he have to kill 'im?"
John was too consumed with feeling the shape of the word on his tongue to notice the structure of his broken sentence.
"Uh, yeah. Maybe a bit." John bit out sarcastically, sighing at the prospect of Sherlock having sold someone else drugs, but as it was the ultimate outcome, he much preferred it. "Is that where we're headed then?"
"Did Eric or Victor ever know that you felt this way? About sex, I mean?" He kissed the clavicle beneath his face in supplication. It was probably bad etiquette to discuss your significant other's previous partners the morning after you'd been shagged rotten and fallen in love with him. But Sherlock Holmes was hardly one for decorum.
Sherlock spun on Lestrade, practically vibrating with pleasure. "I assume that the victim had his back turned towards the tunnel when he was shoved, yes? Possibly engaging in conversation with the disguised man?"
"Were you thinking about me while you did it?" Sherlock asked, finally breaking the silence. He reached out and took John's hips and tilted him a little higher, seeming to have found something interesting there and wanting to expose it to the light. It put John further up onto his toes, his calves straining. His sex throbbing anew.
He took the recommended dosage with a shrug and stripped himself naked.
John had confronted him in the orchard shortly after hearing of the wedding party to be held in their honor in a few short days. So beset by rage was he that all he could do was take a swing as he approached and clocked William hard in the face.
"Shut up." John warned against the harmless insult, the tip of his tongue was pressed against his bottom lip, his hands fumbling around a pair of wooden chopsticks that kept slipping loose of his grasp. One too many times it seemed finally. "Sod it all! Christ. I'll never get it. I'm going to bloody starve to death."
He picked up another dish. And then another, holding them up. A couple more dishes deep and John was greeted by the sight of a strip of sellotape reading 'MAG 22:12' and another called 'FAUC 21:56'. John felt a lead weight drop into his guts when he looked down and spotted the one scraped dish he'd carelessly noticed before his shower still left open to the room. Still left with the knife gleaming nefariously across its open surface. He wondered /really/ how long that'd been sitting there like that and that ominous feeling grew ten-fold.
But that had been so long ago.
"When we were walking out the bloody door! That's hardly enough time to process it. Especially when it involves my well being."
"Turn away." Sherlock said and John only blinked at the pearl-encrusted bust of him that rose above the elaborate screen. Sherlock was looking from John to his waist, trying to do something there. When John still did not move, his displeasure grew. "Have you become deaf Captain? I said turn away."
"Kuru?" It's barely a whisper.
"Yes. I got that much." John crossed his arms, licking his bottom lip. "What about the fish though? Some elaboration might be nice."
So shattering that John couldn't keep himself from falling right into the plushness of that slack mouth curled around sharp teeth. Those ice-coloured eyes boring into him while that hot silken tongue worked him towards devastating completion.
"Indeed. He was in London for the day and had a bit of an issue involving his salt water hobby. He was recommended to me from a 'third party'. Though I heavily suspect it was Mycroft dropping my name."
"We're just having a chat." John warned.
So, when he recovered, he had decided to keep it (in part to hide the gaunt of his face) but also to remind himself how close he had come to losing himself to devastation before a new chapter of his life could begin. How foolishly unwilling he had been to hope for the dawn through the darkness.
"I want some." John hears his mouth say with a shiver and his arsecheeks slide slickly as he moves to let Sherlock tip over him. He licks at the seam of Sherlock's lips until they open and a warm wet wash of liquid comes rushing at him. He swallows it all, moaning wantonly and not at all embarrassed for it.
It took Sherlock a long while to regain his composure as well, for he stood there like a statue staring at the place that John's face had vacated and tried to understand what he had just heard.
"I had to be certain," came Sherlock's small, baritone voice.
"Christ John, you could have left /something/ for the busboy to clean." Sherlock paid and they left, having to remind John not to leave his shopping behind.
John smirked at the effort and rounded onto their drinks cupboard instead of going directly to his seat. "Care for a drink?"
He ached everywhere.
As he knew it would, saying this rouses Sherlock enough for him to shift over and create a perfectly-sized hole with his curled body to accommodate John sitting on the bed. John does so and waits until Sherlock squirms close enough to be pressed fully against him.
John set out their nice tea set, admired his roaring fire, and heard the kettle boil just as the doorbell downstairs rang.
"Like I told you before, you are still owed happiness John Watson. And I am here to see to it that you find it."
Or perhaps if they were very, very unlucky, they may die of the singular death that Sherlock had nearly succumbed to mere weeks before: a death from boredom.
But to do that willingly to the soft flesh of your throat...John could only imagine.
The cow gave another great bellow as they came to a stop and John smiled a crooked smile at her impatience. "She's around here somewhere. Just hold on." He assured her, before cupping his hands and calling out, "heya!" He pressed two fingers against his bottom lip and whistled loudly.
"So, you find yourself in a bit of a spot. What will you do this time? There are no fire alarms to pull here. No where to run. Not without leaving your friend behind. So I'll be taking both your kidneys Mr. Holmes. Along with whatever else I'd like. Does that suit you?" Her small eyes glitter in victory. Her quarry trapped in a kill jar. "Because that suits me just fine."
The noise resounded in the empty waiting room, following him into the break room where the vending machine buzzed indifferently. He rummaged through his pockets for some pence and in the final crescendo, Page moaning in ecstasy, John looked over his meager choices of crisps versus crisps and decided on crisps.
If he'd held out any doubts as to what Sherlock's true intentions were in coming here, or the fallacy of his own assumptions, they were vaporized when the man behind the counter exchanged their jackets for invisible stamps. Stamps which only exposed themselves when John lowered his hand to the bar's purple black light on a resigned whim and a glowing bulldog's head sneered plaintively back up at him. John sighed.
His silk shirt was practically painted onto his thin frame, his trousers sticking to every curve and bump. His hair was a wet mop atop his head, giving him the appearance of a six-foot drowned cat. And it was precisely that visage that had John twisting out of Lestrade's grasp, handing him Sherlock's stuff, and about to tread deeper into the muck when some younger and more intrepid Yarders beat him to it.
Sherlock's head only tilted inquisitively, to which John merely raised up and kissed him full on the mouth in apology to keep him from speaking. "I'll be at the bar, blocking the exit if you should need me." He had to get out of here, make himself useful and only necessary when it was valued.
"Read it now." Came the challenge.
"Are you going to be using Lorazepam?"
"Are you certain about this John?" Sherlock asks, almost ironically, as he's forging John's signature perfectly onto the discharge papers as he asks it. But there's a seriousness to his face that leaves John just blinking at his profile in  confusion.
"I think the term your looking for is /your doctor/. And if that's the case, then I'll be both." John said shamelessly, not at all shy to watch Sherlock sitting there on the gurney getting redressed, figuring Lestrade wouldn't be too pressed to get his clothes back after Sherlock wore them commando.
"This is beautiful." John said reverently, too engrossed in the illustration to see flattery flutter across Sherlock's features. He gently touched a finger to the drawing, feeling the indentations the quill had made in the page, as though he could feel the ridges on its cap.
John rubbed at his shoulder again, unable to help it.
"So it's only a natural progression to conclude that you would have been more at ease to indulge in this previously ignored side of your sexuality given the circumstances at hand. Far away from all previous prejudicial expectations. Free from prying eyes.
Given the castle's inauspicious nature already, it seemed almost theatrical that at the forefront of the balcony a large wooden pillory had been erected. The three large holes cut into its face seemed to yawn portentously for a transgressor's hands and neck.
"I was just going to get some coffee. Would either of you care for some?" John tried a last-ditch effort for affability.
But the opening and the shutting of the medicine cupboard, however, does call the Propolis Elixir to his attention.
Sherlock blundered for a moment, making him look all the more endearing before he clasped his fidgeting hands behind his back in an effort to stem his coltish behaviour. "I, uh, you'll be pleased to know that the goose has been removed and returned to the Oakshot sisters while you were away. It had *ahem* coughed up the goods shortly after you left. The reward money should be wired into our account by the morning. Mrs. Hudson took the liberty of cleaning your floor and all your bedding has been replaced. The soiled ones have been thrown in the bin."
His ultimate humiliation was known now. He was weak. He was low. And it would only be a moment before his Prince would banish him from his sight. Sickened by this pathetic little man who had murdered in cold blood. John of North Umberland was no knight at all.
He knew precisely where the Lord of the Manor was. How could he not? That man had stolen away the man he loved and John had done nothing for the past half year but to pine and drink and obsess.
Sherlock lets John into his world.
John listens to them for a while. Falling into their rhythm before giving a necessary squeeze to Sherlock's fingers, an appreciative smile to the cosmos, and slips off to sleep on caramelized bones with the love of his life pressed in closely.
John found his calm voice hiding deep within his chest. "No, no. I didn't say 'no'. I just need...to think about it. Alright? Just let me ...get a process on it."
When the doors shut again to keep in the heat, Sherlock was practically buzzing, having moved on from being flirty, apparently. "Oh, J-j-john. Do you und-d-derstand the sign-n-n-nificance of this? Hand those o-o-o-over. I must get b-b-back out th-th-th-there. I hav-v-ve to--"
"The second and last person to which I attempted to form a relationship with was a man named Victor Trevor. We attended the same university."
John watched his narrow arse round the edge of the mattress, heading towards his bureau. When he tried to move himself, his skin felt shellacked and his limbs leaden. "Could you get me a towel? I can't get up." His legs still seemed to be trembling.
"Is there a way for it to not feel like that?"
A stunned silence follows, before she throws up her chin in offense and goes stomping up the stares all the same. John flashes Sherlock a look.
The Cross seemed just the place to provide a wanting man anything he could ever need.
'Radix pedis diaboli' is from "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot" which i turned into a mushroom cause i think that's cooler than just a plant.
"Oh." Dr. Sipe looked back to John from fishing through the drawer. "Well, of course. We have other methods of sedation--"
John sighed down at his phone, which was hardly a unique reaction to the device, but at two in the morning it carried the extra weight of hunger, fatigue, and the cauterized edge of raw emotion.
Nervous people began to speak of spies as they crouched over their tallow candles in the dark and ate their pottage. Serfs far out in the fields, breaking their backs, talked of lies and deceit and wagging tongues. Old maids with herb-stained fingers spoke of witchcraft.
He set the coffee down at Sherlock's elbow, pre-mixed with sugar and milk, and allowed his curiosity to overtake his caution. If Sherlock hadn't blurted out something by now, either he wasn't in the mood to talk about it, or he didn't find it important enough. Regardless, John was relieved.
AND beware of the TRIGGER WARNINGS AHEAD: non-consensual drug use, non-consensual undressing, violence and whump, graphic descriptions of first aid, posthumous slander of real life person, snowballing, and sex!
Words from a lifetime ago come floating back to John, conjured up as if by ghosts: '/when you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield/' It strengthens the resolve in his plan.
He stared at the unmade bed with its pile of Lestrade's shed clothes and felt like an utter tit. How long had he actually been alone?
"Same." Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock squirmed under such tender scrutiny. "There are many who blamed me," he whispered. "They said I was a witch."
This could be good.
And soon the thrush was the closest it had ever been. Tilting its large black eye at him.
"Certainly not. You showed all the signs of wanting to be kissed so I obliged. I simply took advantage of the opportunity."
The motion caused John to finally release the air that he'd been holding in his chest. His jaw working open and shut like a landed fish.
"What the fuck was that about?" Lestrade asked.
Eventually, he took his hands away and looked down into his wet palms, flexing his fingers before clenching them tightly, as if he could grasp his emotional turmoil and solve it with his fists. It was with his sadness held so tightly that John Watson revealed that which he had not ever revealed to ANYONE. The source of a guilt so deep, it had given him a psychosomatic limp to the bewilderment of every doctor he'd worked with post Afghanistan. "I wasn't there when he died. He took a bullet right through the femoral artery. Bled out. I didn't get to...I should have...If I'd just /been/ there, y'know?...I could have--I don't..."
It was a list of names and beside each one was a date. There were fourteen in all.
Sherlock took a deep breath, reaching out through a broken out piece of glass to pluck a soft white feather from the sill. He twirled the delicate thing back and forth in his long fingers as he recounted the tale.
Charles' body would always be so heavy on top of him. So immovable. No matter how much Sherlock fought. The unreal mass of him making it impossible for Sherlock to breathe, let alone break free, only pushing him deeper into the mire.
"Revenge?" John suggested. "You said that Mr. Jones had a relationship with the pusher. Maybe they were unfaithful?"
"Hang on a minute. I assume it's this program then? Alright. Go ahead."
It was a bit like stepping into a misty technicolour jungle, he mused.
"Hang on. Moriarty? What are you two talking about?" John loathed being out of the loop, especially when it involved the likes of that bastard. He made himself be heard. "Who's Gregson?"
"Please John. Will you do this for me?"
"You forget too easily about the Battle for Umberland of the North. Where Lieutenant Moran's head was cleaved clean from his shoulders before the fighting had even begun. Moriarty's Crusade was stopped in its tracks by little more than two hundred townsfolk. Hardly unassailable." Sherlock continued, eyes narrowing. Scoffing with a certainty he was no longer sure he felt. This shard of hope had begun to lose its luster the longer he clung to it. The battle itself having happened so long ago -- nearly two years now -- he secretly feared that it had been nothing more than legend. But he clung to it all the same.
"Mhm. Just fine. Have you been up to your room yet?" Sherlock's eyes, of course, fell briefly onto the folder, but said nothing about it.
It was so alike in everything but name that the letter could have been a carbon copy of the first, had that one not currently been buried under aluminum powder on the kitchen table. But of course the dusting had turned up no finger prints and they both knew without trying that this one would result in the same.
John found himself grasping at ghosts suddenly. An icy cold blooming in his guts as he thought back to his last days in Afghanistan. Those last moments of clarified consciousness that felt like they'd happened a lifetime ago, to somebody else even, ones he'd fought so hard not to think on. And he decided immediately that if they started down this particular path tonight, it was certain to ruin their evening. John decided he didn't want that at all.
He was lining the hemispherical fissure up with himself when John turned back to his paper, reading captions and skimming through paragraphs, pointedly ignoring his flatmate's preoccupation with some poor sod's gray matter for as much and as long as he could.
And just like that, the three men were left alone, allowing the silence to creep and fill into every space that was left in this pitiless room. John was helpless, Sherlock was helpless, and the High Steward was inordinately pleased to have brought both men so low in one single morning.
"Give me a minute, yeah?" John begged, shaking out his hand and unable to throw that little niggle of confusion at the fact that Sherlock was over what had just happened betwixt them so easily.
It certainly didn't feel like that long. He felt like he had just blinked or maybe slept a whole night. "I don't know if I told you before, but that was bloody amazing."
This doorway was the only way to reach the North and rarely opened its doors except to those of the most import. The only other choice was to go several hundred miles out of the way to where the cliffs no longer stood sentinel over the land and should any such attacker choose these alternative routes, they could be seen and dealt with by the castle's far reaching eyes long before they ever posed a threat.
CHAPTER NINE - The Adventures of the Demonstrative Man
Sherlock's hands stopped chopping the air and he turned, considering her truly for the first time now that she had something important to contribute. "Interesting..."
Sherlock shook himself once more from the cobweb of his thoughts, pulling his chin from Charles' hand, only because Charles let him. It would not do well to dwell on these things now. "I grow weary of this conversation. Have you brought me something interesting today? It is part of the arrangement." Sherlock's eyes had reopened to a spot on the wall behind Charles' shoulder, not willing to let him see the sadness that had refilled his heart to the brim.
Anderson gaped in insult, before turning to Lestrade. "I don't know how they got here before you did sir. I didn't notify him!" His drawn face screwed up in irritation as he turned back to Sherlock. "I didn't text /you/! You're not suppose to be here. How did you even know to come here?"
The last prospective folder had been the one to keep his attention. The landscape paralleled how he looked (how he felt) scarred and isolated with its soft stone cliffs slowly eroding through time and weather. As if one day he might be able to look out his window and topple off the edge of the world. Fairly certain he'd let the ocean just take him.
'Dear Mr. Watson,
"Well that was...quite an experience." Sherlock gulps in sympathy. He's sucking in air just as quickly as John. Tipping his neck to look down and watch his sated, glossy cock pull back slowly into its foreskin.
And suddenly it all clicked into focus. The names and the timestamps scrawled on the sellotape: DOOR. MAGAZINES. FAUCET. Sherlock had willingly gathered samples from the place John /worked/ and brought them home to /study/. As an EXPERIMENT! Because he had nothing on better to do.
The woman is short and a little stout, swathed in a light gold dress suit and standing perfectly prim before the curtain a few feet away. She's old, with curled white hair and a softly powdered face. But in her shoulders and demeanor she states that she is anything but fragile. Her crepe paper hands are clasped before her suit jacket and a string of pearls with a matching brooch lay against her lapels.
Looking down, he scowled at his cock, as if it had started all this, finding it not nearly so flushed and salient as it had been, but still refusing to lose the last of its full arousal. As if it wanted to punish him. Expose him.
John shoved a single ibuprofin and a glass at Sherlock forcefully, gathering up his supplies with a lot of noise and throwing it onto the table on his way out. "Take that. I'm going to bed. Wake me up if you go into shock."
When we both reached the edge of the bed we froze for a moment. His face looked almost pained, his breathing shallow. “John” he said with intensity, and the look in his eyes melted into desire. He grabbed my face roughly and brought his lips toward mine. My head was swimming, but I stepped off the bed and reached my arms around him, one hand on his shoulder, one hand wound in his hair. He moved both hands to my back and pulled me flush with him, groaning when we made that more intimate contact. His body felt so sweet, so delicious, so perfect in my arms, and I moaned as I got harder.
“The best man…” I smiled back, and gently turned him aside to begin my tale.
Time stopped. The moment seemed suspended in mid-air, the whole universe boiling down to just this space between us.
I gulped oxygen. I was stunned. I misheard. Wishful thinking.
It was a bit overwhelming. John had gone for so long impatiently standing behind the wall erected by the enigmatic detective, for a long time not even realizing how much he’d hungered to peer over the top, to pierce through the mystery and see who Sherlock actually was. And now, to be abruptly facing into this rare window onto the life of his beloved, it was almost too good to be true. But to be sure: there was Sherlock. The curly dark hair was unmistakable, the pale skin, ethereal eyes, the beginning of those cheekbones, but the face softer, rounder, the eyes open, searching, and just slightly, sad.
“No, no!” I shouted. “Please no dress. Please, please don’t put the dress on.” My breathing coming fast and hard, my chest tightening, my head pounding. “I’ll be there soon,” I gasped out, and hung up.
“Ah- man of few words, are you?” John said quietly, curious, careful. “What was going on then?’
All night, and if I’m honest, on and off for a while, some amount of confusion had been buzzing around inside of me, because of Sherlock. Just because Sherlock was…..well, Sherlock. Only dimly aware of this, it was also true that at times, a certain pang of clarity cut through the confusion, seeming to light up something I was supposed to see, and then the light again doused abruptly by the confusion, before I could get much of a look.
Clear?
This line of thought wasn’t helping at all. My breathing got faster, my heart was pounding like a jackhammer, I was dizzy and coming closer and closer to throwing up. I gamely kept focusing on the breathing, remembering the PTSD specialist saying that the breathing will work no matter what you’re thinking, or you’ll faint, and then your breathing will go back to normal on its own.
I squared my shoulders, straightened my coat, and strode into the entrance of the church.
The first was that, for a long time, I had been almost completely unaware of the feelings I’d had for this army doctor who’d changed my life four years ago. To be sure, throughout our time together, there were always these sparks of attraction, jolts of arousal, moments of innuendo. I’d look up as from a day dream, consider with the barest awareness the possibility of taking things further with him, and then tuck the idea away again, certain that “there’d be time in the future” to pursue these fantasies. Alas.
I swallowed hard. I hadn’t actually expected to have to be honest with others that day. I looked sheepishly at the floor, and started in.
Apparently able to regain use of his body, Sherlock again rose slightly over me, his eyes beautiful, but sill hazed by the evenings imbibing. He kissed me gently on my eyes, nose, lips, and i let our a small sigh. He cocked his head slightly, and looked at me so…lovingly? and then with sadness in his face. I thought I could see a tear.
“Ah!” Sherlock snapped up a book from one of the stacks. “Success!” He rifled through the pages and drew forth a 5 x 7 photo which he stared down at momentarily. Perhaps too late, he remembered this photo did not always have a such a good effect on him.
Second problem: hubris.
“That would be nice,” Sherlock said, falling onto his side, seemingly lost in thought. After a moment, he said “all the other kids are mean too,” his voice hitching in his throat. “They laugh at me, and say I should go away, that I don’t fit in, that I make them mad. So I just have Redbeard to play with..” He began to cry quietly.
“And what are you dressed as?” John said, grinning with glee at their game.
He released my hands and put an arm on either side of my head. His kisses had become more frenzied, more impassioned, his mouth roaming over my neck, my shoulders, my chest. He’d stilled his hips for both our sakes, but the pent up sexual energy seemed to need some outlet, which it found between his mouth and my skin. My cock may not have been getting direct stimulation, but it did not get that memo and increased its pulsing, throbbing, in a way I found harder and harder to control.
“Listen..” I was crying, my chest heaving. “Listen…” I huffed out, but that was all I could do. I ran to bathroom, slammed the door behind me, and vomited.
Thank god she’d changed out of the dress. Her distress and mine raged up and down, into every color of emotional pain there was, for what seemed like hours. I did throw up (again) but had the presence of mind to actually brush my teeth after (my toothbrush staring at me from her vanity, chastising me for my abandonment). Still it was the first normal human thing I’d done all day, and it calmed me strangely. I think I’d never felt more exhausted.
John: soldier, in every sense, brave, wise, doing the right thing, proceeding as any straight man might, to the altar, with his bride.
Overall, I felt well in control of this fantasizing throughout the night, he and I teasing each other, laughing—up til the point when for some unknown reason he seemed about to come to blows with some git, about what? ash? I got us out of there, and we headed home.
I couldn’t help but shed a few tears. John was as good a lover as he was perfect a man, and I felt again astonished at my good fortune. Tears of gratitude, then? Love?
I felt hot tears. This was undoubtedly one of the most tender moments I’d ever experienced during sex, and this…what? Being both dominated and adored? Not something I think I’d ever had before. Nope. Never had this before. I loved it. I absolutely loved it. I would not have predicted this about myself, but it seemed to be a day for me to be smashing through expectations, definitions, categories.
My eyes were a dead giveaway, I knew it. I tried to look sternly, then I melted into humor, then lust, then love, now grief—
do tears,” John scoffed gently. “Everyone does tears some time.”
I emerged from the loo, with my doctor still deeply asleep. Not looking good. I strode bravely to the armoire, and drew forth the suit, the sartorial backdrop to my demise. I despised the thing. Nonetheless, I proceeded and dressed in all too short of time.
“This” John said. He turned Sherlock so that he was laying in his arms, almost in his lap, and he began kissing every part of the detective he could reach. He started off with his lips, a gentle brush, then worked his way down his throat, his shoulders, his chest. “You taste so good” John groaned between kisses.
“Listen, its complicated,” I continued. “I am
About ninety minutes in and my head was buzzing with confusion. Most of it pleasant enough, surely due to my careful and steady imbibing, but perhaps not all alcohol related, if I’m honest.
“Yes, I know,” I hissed irritatedly, glowering at him. But then even he began to smile. “About bloody time, I guess.”
Sherlock reached back and canted John’s hips slightly more off the bed.
I could not bear my uncertainty one more minute. I pulled back abruptly, both of us gasping for breath. “Don’t……..” he started, my heart screeching to a halt, anguish rising up. “…..stop,” he panted, “god, don’t stop.”
He abruptly pulled away, throwing me into confusion.
Now they were in Sherlock’s bed, (what used to be Sherlock’s bed), but they’d had sex in every room of the flat already, against and on top of all the surfaces John had ever imagined them against or on top of, and a couple he had not. (“The stairs up to my bedroom? Really?”) Sherlock leaned over him now, his forearms on either side of John’s head, a look of such passion, longing (and love?) in his eyes, gently rocking into him, groaning as he seated himself deeper and deeper into John’s body.
There was a rumble John felt when he was closing in on coming. Did Sherlock feel such too? His breath became even more shallow; the ecstasy of going toward this inevitable crescendo, while not quite being there, in the neighborhood of the divine, knowing you’d arrive soon. Such bliss. “God, Sherlock, I’m close,” his breath coming in fast bursts; “so close.”
I returned to my place on the sofa, sprawled out, my head leaning against the back. Relief again coursed through my body, and I laughed through the tears I was still shedding. God, I couldn’t wait to hold him. I breathed, trying to calm myself. I wasn’t even sure John would want to have sex, so getting myself all worked up was not necessarily advisable. My body wasn’t really cooperating with this sound advice. I felt my cock harden just at the thought of being with him soon.
I lay with him on top of me, struggling for breath, and feeling such a kind of joy, contentment, satisfaction.
“What…?’ Molly whispered.
Tears came to her eyes. “But I, uh, I had sex with Sherlock last night…”
My mind continued to race, remembering more of last night, trying to sit up, laying back down, at once racing a hundred kilometers an hour and completely immobilized.
Sherlock does a bang up job
“You’re amazing…so gorgeous…. perfect…” I whispered to him.
“That Mycroft..” John said with gentleness starting to mix with tension. “I hate that he’s mean to you. I think I’ll go punch him in the nose for you” He reached his hand to hold Sherlock’s, continuing to talk to the picture.
For putting himself in this position.
It was hard and tedious work to be sure. But it was work that equaled reward now. So it was welcome.
"Would 'lovers' be an appropriate description?"
The minute breadth of a single finger did all it could to electrify the nerves around his hole. Lighting him up like a switchboard to transfer waves upon waves upon waves of sensation up his spine and out into his fingers. He had to come back to himself twice before he lost his balance, reminding himself that there was nothing solid to grab onto should he capsize and the thought of being sprawled out in exploit was sobering.
They managed a few desperate grinds before John could stand no more of the utter claustrophobia of his position and, uncoupling them under intense protest, ushered them to the floor. He used the blanket as bedding as he pressed Sherlock's knees back into his shoulders and pinned him as soundly as a /Acherontia styx/ would be pinned to a collector's spreading board, sliding back inside.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed into slits, their sharpness tempered down into a mutinous shine. "That's NOT what I said, if you had even BOTHERED to listen to me John and hardly practical in a romantic relationship! But most of all it's certainly NOT what I require. Don't try to coddle me with your misplaced sense of munificence!" He bared his teeth as he hissed.
Sherlock's hands squeezed minutely. "But I do much prefer this." He whispered into the tumult of John's hair, so quiet that it almost remained a secret.
"Tell me, love. I need to know. What is happening?"
He did not remember how it had begun exactly, what day he looked up from his emptiness and despair and saw this little creature there upon his sill. He only knew that this was the single secret he possessed that had remained truly his. And he was careful to do all he could to keep it that way.
With whatever air is left in him, John screams.
John smiles. "I'll raise a glass to that." John muses, "if I could raise my arms at all."
Sherlock sniffs. Hands clenched at his sides as if he isn't allowed to touch John right now. Not while he is so vulnerable. "I just wanted to know...at least once...what it felt like."
A series of floodlights and a large tarpaulin had been erected down the street, blocking whatever had happened to the smattering of gawkers collecting on the pavement around him. A clutch of constables made an odd shadow against the screen and from among them, a man with a tired face that was becoming more and more a friend began the long trek towards him.
And suddenly, with a shocking deep breath and wide wet eyes, John KNOWS what he has to do now. To stop this outside threat. To mend what is broken between them. To accept and reciprocate what strange confessions of Sherlock Holmes has pronounced for the likes of John Watson.
"It was not wholly objectionable." Sherlock admitted vaguely.
enjoy!
The torrential downpour had forced most of the sellers who worked from tents and wagons to keep their businesses closed and wait for the storm to pass. Those in buildings fared a little bit better. But not by much.
A young community support officer in a neon yellow coat reached John first, holding up a hand. "Sorry, sir. You'll need to move along. There's been an accident." He looked absolutely miserable, with his nose and ears bitten to a bright red, trying to wick what heat he could from a paper cup of coffee. John could already tell that he'd started to shiver.
John whimpered when Sherlock sat up on his knees, wiped his chin with the back of his hand, and looked down to admire his work. In a momentary panic, John found he couldn't face him like this. Meet his eyes. Feeling a bit pathetic by having to turn his head away. But it was just /so/ much.
