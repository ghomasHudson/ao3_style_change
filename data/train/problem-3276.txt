He leaned in and captured Cas's mouth in his. He kissed him with the intensity and attraction he had come to feel for him in the last month. He let his thoughts about spells and Hell fall away and he just poured himself into Cas, who kissed him back with equal passion. He ran his hands over Cas's bare back under his clothes and then pulled off his shirt. He rolled over on top of Cas and moved his mouth down to his throat, sucking and biting on that sensitive place between his shoulders and neck that drove Cas crazy. Cas moaned and gripped Dean's back, digging his nails into his shirt. Dean ripped his own shirt off and leaned over him, resting on his elbows, returning to Cas's mouth, that mouth that he loved, with its full lips and its tendency to turn red after too much kissing. Dean ground his hips into Cas's, wanting, needing skin-on-skin contact. Cas was letting out all of these little gasps and moans that were almost too much for him to hear, because God was it hot. Cas circled his arms around his neck and pulled him in close, kissing him fiercely, all tongue.
"Cas, you are such a dear." She said. "You are just the cutest thing! I am so happy you are Dean's tutor!"
"Jo!" Charlie cried, leaping up to help her.
"Cas." He said simply.
"What is it? Cas, what's wrong?" He said, his voice thick with sleep.
He stood up, trench coat whooshing, and put his hands on his face. Dean heard him muttering in a strange language that was either Latin or Enochian or both. He paced back and forth around the room, with his face covered, his voice getting gradually louder and harsher. Dean realized that he was summoning, except he hadn't set up a circle, or anything. He was just chanting into the wind.
"So I should let them out of the cage out of the goodness of my heart?" Crowley said. "Oh come on, Castiel! You can do better than that!"
Jason movie in the series. Now, you want camp? Freddy versus Jason. I actually got a kick out of that one."
The Winchesters never went about anything normally, not even courtship.
"Pretty bored." Charlie admitted, grinning at them. "But isn't it fucking awesome?"
"I thought I trusted you with my life, my body, heart, and soul. But after that… after seeing Crowley standing in our barn, you pleading for yet another deal, despite everything finally coming together for us after all of that shit, I just don't know." Cas said, shaking his head.
Mary winced again and didn't respond.
"Oh." Castiel shifted in his seat, his eyes darting back and forth, as if he were suddenly nervous.
Dean was sure trusted Castiel enough at this point to take his word about the angel.
Dean didn't say it out loud, but he was realizing that maybe him being an asshole wasn't something that really bothered Castiel all that much.
"We'll get him back." He said again, his voice sounding like rocks and glass.
"Boston." Castiel said, staring into his coffee.
"Castiel, I don't mean to put it in those terms. But it was you who inspired the angels to think for themselves. Then when Raphael made you human just to torture you, many angels realized that he wasn't who they wanted in charge." Gabriel said.
"But… Metatron…"
"You loosen up? I get weird?" Castiel said, as if he were entertaining a dog.
"Nothing bad about you. I was right about him though. He worships the ground you walk on, wants to be just like you. Wants your life, except the whole having sex with men part, which he made very clear." Cas said, chuckling a little.
"Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, a Cast was stirring, like a really annoying mouse." He muttered.
"CAS, are you crazy? Put me down. PUT ME DOWN." He choked.
Despite the hand-holding, after the day in the park, the physical element of their emerging relationship came to almost a grinding halt. Dean didn't touch Castiel too much out of fear of triggering some sort of negative reaction in him. Dean knew innately that this is exactly what Castiel expected to happen, because he didn't push it. He let Dean initiate everything and he didn't react with too much enthusiasm, even though Dean saw the discreet boners and heard his breathy little sighs every time they kissed.
"I didn't know."
Castiel slept with his knees curled up to his chest, in almost a fetal position, spooning a pillow. Dean chuckled, because that was exactly how thought Castiel would sleep. It was strange, but it made sense. His brow was even furrowed in his sleep, something that only someone as tightly wound Castiel was would do. He chuckled and bent over and kissed him on the forehead.
"Your mom called." Castiel said, as if it were an afterthought. "Don't be mad, I tried to wake you up, but you were passed out."
"The angel tablet." She says simply.
"Do you want a beer?" Castiel asked, changing the subject. "I don't drink much, maybe a beer or two after a long day, so I have some in the fridge."
"Do you have any pictures of her?"
Balthazar raised his eyebrows and looked directly at Dean, then at Castiel. He could tell that the angel was bracing them both for the answer he was about to give.
Charlie's conspiratorial look changed to one of surprise when she saw the sketchbook. "Whoa, you like Melt Banana?" She said, her voice rising. She leaned forward, long red hair obscuring Dean's view. Dean cleared his throat, but Charlie ignored him.
"That's why I'm switching to beer for the next 10 minutes. Two shots, beer, two shots, beer, and so on, until I can't fucking feel anything." Dean muttered.
This time too, Dean told her everything.
The four of them met at a Mexican restaurant in the center of town. They walked because the town just wasn't that big. Sometimes Dean went on drives in his beloved Impala just to remind himself how much he loved driving. The place was popular because it was notorious for serving underage Oregonians huge margaritas.
"I am gross. I need a shower." He muttered.
Dean just nodded. Castiel slipped the photos back into the sketchbook carefully and put it back in the trunk.
Cas crawled into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin. Dean started to walk out, eager to read more.
"Sammy." Dean said quietly. "Happy birthday, Sammy."
By the 900th Dean, Castiel no longer feels anything.
"Duh. Charlie insists there is something we have to see and we had such a good time last time, then why the hell not?"
"Nice to meet you, Cas!" Ellen said jovially. She patted him on the shoulder heartily.
"You see, Cas, I used to own a salvage yard before I opened up the auto body shop. I had cars everywhere and naturally these kids turned one of my old trucks into a fort. They used to say it was perfect because it was by the creek, which they referred to as 'mud river.' For years, I didn't pay it any mind, cuz hell, they were kids! But they kept going down there, into that damn truck as teenagers! One day I went down there to check on 'em and you will never believe what I found!" Bobby said.
"Cas… why didn't you try harder to wake me up?" He groaned. "Christ, what time is it?"
Cas softened when he said that. Maybe the days of getting the shit kicked out him by the nerd angel were finally over. Dean couldn't deny he was happy about that.
"Don't feel sorry for me." Castiel commanded, as if he were reading Dean's mind. "I'm happy where I am now. Happy to be sitting here with you, more buzzed than I have been in months, happy not to feel like a fucking freak for once."
"Winchesters are freaks." Dean added. "Except I guess now she's Campbell?"
On cue, when Dean felt the mantra no longer working, Jo came into his bedroom.
Finally he said something. "You cleaned." He whispered.
Dean rested his head on the steering wheel. He had no fucking idea what to do. It was over and he had no clue what his next move was. He didn't have it in him to call 911. So he did the only thing he could think to do. He gave up.
"Making up for lost time? Sam told me you two were like dogs in heat and he eventually had to wear ear plugs to bed." Jo said, her smile becoming more Cheshire cat-like and evil.
"Turducken slammer with extra pickles and ketchup." Castiel clarified, smiling a little.
"Yes you were. That's what it felt like. I just wanted to make you happy and you wouldn't let me."
"I think I could oblige that." Dean said, grinning and rolling over on his side and propping himself up on his elbow.
Later that day, Dean met his best friends Jo and Charlie for lunch, as he did almost every day. Jo was Dean's world, his best friend, his closest confidante. He had even followed her to college, which was strange because he was three years older than her. Charlie was her closest female friend on campus and over the last four and a half years, the three of them had become an unlikely trio who did nearly everything together.
"Mom, are you okay?" He asked. She sounded terrible.
Dean snorted. "So, about that… uh, look, I don't know how you feel about it, but do you think it was a mistake?" He asked.
Sam nodded a little. "But still."
"I'm going to get a restraining order and I'm going to get a lawyer to force him to sign the papers." She muttered. "I can't do this anymore. I can't keep holding onto something that was lost to me years ago. I talked to someone awhile ago who said he can push it through without John's cooperation."
"Why is this happening?" He asked.
"Don't do it, man. Don't stoop to his level. Stay here, be the man. Be the man for mom and me. Mom doesn't need to deal with this right now and Cas doesn't need to see you like this. Come on, dude, let's just… chill. I know it's hard, but please, for us, don't do this."
"Cas, baby, you can relax. It's okay. We're okay." He whispered.
Castiel rushed into the kitchen and brought him another beer. He handed it to him and Dean took it silently.
Castiel smiled serenely. "You don't know the half of it."
Cas was talking about him like he was a science experiment. Dean found it exasperating, but also slightly amusing. And Cas was right… sleeping was non-sexual. There were a few times when he and Sammy had slept in the same bed when faced with no money or tight quarters, and it had happened even as adults. Cas was basically his family, just like Sammy had been. What harm could it do?
Dean quickly got up and pulled on a pair of jeans and Cas did the same. Sam came into the room. He was already fully dressed and he looked grave.
Two days after their first kiss and his conversation with Sam, Castiel invited him over to study while he graded papers. It was the first time Castiel had ever invited him over directly. Castiel sounded totally normal over the phone and that made Dean feel better. Maybe it wouldn't be weird.
"Do you see why I didn't come back for two years?" Dean said sarcastically.
"Raphael is dead." Castiel said numbly.
"Good going, Winchester." He muttered to himself. He knocked on the door. "Cas? Buddy? I'm coming in."
"What's that?" Jo said.
"I have no idea, Dean. He's your brother."
"Sam and Adam are in Hell, Dean. What Crowley just told you, it's probably the least painful torture they are receiving at Michael and Lucifer's hands. They've been down there for 40 years. You can't imagine it. Maybe this is why I was brought back, really. I was brought back to save Sam and Adam. Brought back to prevent you from doing something stupid like killing yourself before this could take place." Cas whispered.
"The time you had me torture the son of a bitch? When your angel buddy let him go and then he almost killed me?" Dean asked, shuddering at the memory of disemboweling Alastair while Cas watched.
"At least he wasn't seeing Ruby." Dean whispered to himself.
Dean gulped. He hadn't known that. He decided not to mention browsing through them as if they were an issue of Busty Asian Beauties.
"I don't want to go." Dean said to his brother. "I could try to change the ticket, leave on the 2nd or something."
LARP and the Real Girl began the chorus to 'Sweet Transvestite' and Charlie actually winked at Cas from her spot behind the microphone, which made him light in a way that made Dean swoon. He was getting drunk, and Castiel's huge smile and fishnets were doing a number on him. He didn't even notice when another "Janet," who mercifully wasn't Jo, came up to him and started flirting with him. He only had eyes for the ridiculously awkward sociology professor in the corset.
"So… let me just put this in simple terms, so I can get my head around it. Cas, you're human, well, mostly, anyway. Crowley is in charge of Hell. Heaven had a civil war. Gabriel is alive and is the new head of the pack. Gabriel brought me back and there were no demon deals involved at all. Adam is back with his mom with no memory of any of this. You two are a couple. And finally, I could be a drooling mess, but I'm just me. Dean, you're not hunting anymore and you two live in Bobby's house." He said.
"What do you mean by that?" He asked ingenuously.
Castiel laughed a little and sat down. Dean slid him the newspaper and reopened his laptop. They sat there in comfortable silence for awhile, reading the news, drinking coffee and eating breakfast. Castiel disappeared for awhile, showering and getting ready. Dean thought to himself about how domestic the entire scene was, and he didn't mind it at all.
Castiel pressed his fingers a little harder into Dean's neck, and then moved them to his face. Dean felt the worry in the angel's touch as he ran his fingers over his face, pressing down harder. Nothing was happening. Dean didn't even feel the rush of warmth, cleanliness and light that he usually felt when Cas worked his angel mojo.
Finally, exactly two weeks after their initial encounters with Crowley and Gabriel, a familiar face appeared back in their lives. It was a face that Dean had to restrain himself from pummeling.
Balthazar stared at him for a minute, looking bewildered and slightly disgusted.
"I'd prefer not to let him out of my sight looking like this." Dean joked.
"You're not going to like…" Dean started.
"Cas, that shit, my family shit, it's not your problem. You don't need that hanging over you too. You have enough to deal with yourself." Dean said, more sharply than he intended.
Dean ambled out to the kitchen and made himself a pot of coffee and pulled out his laptop to catch up on football scores and maybe less important things, like the news. Castiel padded out of his room an hour later, looking absolutely miserable.
Dean gulped. "I'm sorry."
"Did he quit taking his meds?" Dean asked.
This time it was Dean who blushed. Leave it to Castiel to get the last word.
"What changed?" Dean asked, taking a long swig of his beer.
"I already did and I'm sure I made their day. I'll be over in 15 minutes. I got you lunch."
"I don't have any family." Castiel tightens the grip on his glass and takes a long swig, waves of resentment suddenly coming off him like heat.
Charlie looked horrified and everyone, even Castiel, burst out laughing.
"Hello Dean." Castiel said, smiling at him.
"It was the third one in less than a year. You don't know what that's like. They kept moving me because the foster parents didn't like me, or they had too many kids already, or because I didn't fit in at school. They kept moving me. I just wanted to be done with it."
"I love you, Sammy."
"Angels follow American movies?" Dean asked, genuinely interested. He didn't think angels gave a crap about pop culture, especially movies made in the last 100 years.
She shrugged. "Plus, Dean, he was looking at you like you're a piece of steak too." She added.
"Castiel, come on, man. Let's cool it. Let's take a walk. You and me." Jo said, standing up and tugging at his sleeve.
"You bitch!" The Dean screams. "You fucking bitch, what did you do to him?"
Dean softened. "You're not strange. You just have this way about you, this wide-eyed, intense look, and when you talk, it's nothing like that. You shouldn't feel uncomfortable around me. We're friends, right?"
Dean snorted. Usually he was the one to ruin a beautiful moment with an ill-advised sarcastic comment. Clearly, he was a bad influence on Cas.
Dean was driving them town to Bobby and Ellen's house, where they were meeting the entire Singer family for brunch. Mary had opted not to come because Bobby was constantly harassing her about filing divorce papers. Dean agreed with him.
I am going to fucking kill her.
"Bobby?" Dean whispered. "Who took Bobby?"
"Then what is it?" Castiel sighed.
By around 11:00, the party was in full swing, with Rocky Horror playing on every wall, although you couldn't hear it over the people singing along with the songs and the yelling partygoers. Dean was content to sit on the couch, sipping beer and snuggling his Frank-N-Furter. Anna and Jo were sitting on a nearby loveseat, whispering to each other and making out every few minutes. Dean was happy for her, because his friend was picky and had only found women she liked in nearby cities, which were too far away for anything lasting. Meg had moved onto Nick, which seemed to suit the devilish bassist just fine.
"Not much to tell." He muttered.
they do.
"My blood." Dean finished. "We summon the new King of Hell tomorrow morning."
Cas stood up and stretched, doing a few of the yoga stretches he'd learned from watching Youtube to get rid of the kinks created by a night of sleeping at a table. Unbelievably, Dean felt something in his pants stir. For some reason, bitchy Cas, their "fight" from the night before, and the sight of the drowsy ex-angel stretching and showing off the lithe human body, which apparently was all his now, made Dean kind of hot. He knew the timing was all wrong, that Cas was pissed and that they were about to summon Crowley and possibly die, but hell, what was another hour?
"Her parents, Bobby and Ellen, own the auto shop where my mom worked as the clerk/accounting person. Her family kind of looked out for me and Sam when we were growing up. Ash, Jo's younger brother, is actually Sammy's best friend." He said.
Castiel shook his head. "Dean, there's a reason I don't do what you're doing right now. I don't drown my sorrows in liquor for a reason. I can't handle it. I get angry at everyone and everything."
Dean and Cas expected Gabriel to check in with them about his trip to Hell. He had appeared and disappeared so quickly, talked so large, that they half expected Sam and Adam to appear in their living room that same day. Dean knew they were idiots to believe in miracles, or at least idiots for expecting them to happen quickly. The day after Gabriel's visit, with no word for over 24 hours, Dean began to feel uneasy again.
Castiel didn't say anything and Dean still felt like dying. He knew he was being cruel, but Cas's new go-getter attitude was really bothering him. Cas had never been an optimist and that was something that Dean liked about him. Him talking about bringing Bobby and Sam back, about fighting some new evil, gaining back his access to Heaven, well, Dean knew Cas was putting up a front. The angel might have been able to sense Dean's general hatred toward life and himself right now, but Dean could sense things too. Cas was wearing this new attitude, this fake face because he was terrified and bewildered; cut off from heaven and his full divine powers. Just like Dean, he was cut off from everything that had made him who he was. Dean's mission had been protecting Sammy and saving the world. Cas's mission had been to serve God and to stop the apocalypse. Now all of these things were gone. They really were two peas in a pod right now. They both had no purpose. No reason to live. No idea why they were still here.
Castiel is currently being faced with the 300th version of Dean that she has conjured.
"Your neck." He said softly, running his fingers over the fan shaped bruises he'd left on Dean's throat during our altercation. "I did that, didn't I? I apologize, Dean. I was very angry. I forget that I'm… stronger than most. I don't feel like it anymore."
Dean couldn't help it; he reaches across the table and takes Castiel's hand. It's warm and surprisingly calloused, probably from all of the drawing, and surprisingly, Castiel doesn't pull away.
Somehow Crowley laughing in their faces made him less afraid, more ready to kill. He glanced over at Cas, who was so tense that he looked like he might pop. He knew Crowley's reaction had readied him too.
over and over again. He bends over and grabs the angel blade from the copy's hand and quickly stabs it in the chest, ending its pain. The copy howls one last time and dies.
"It could be worse. At least we're here together." Castiel said, smiling feebly. His right eye twitched.
The four of them walked into the bar, the only place in town with a dance floor, immediately ordered another round of shots. Charlie and Jo were out there immediately, putting on a show for all of the men in the bar, who just assumed they were drunken college girls trying to get men to buy them drinks, which was about half true.
"My life… well, it has not been easy. Remember I said a lot of terrible things happened to me when I was a kid? Well, they did, and these things have stuck with me. They've fucked me up." Castiel said thickly, his voice on the verge of breaking.
"Cas, answer your damn phone!" He yelled into the receiver.
"Fuck this." He slurred. "Bartender! Close my tab please."
Jo and Castiel were dead.
"You are what changed, you moron. I met you, and then I met your friends and your family. It brought me out of this self-imposed seclusion. You brought me back into the world, made me see that there is more than school and loneliness."
He sat there, took the drink in one shot, and suddenly he understood Castiel's utter desperation and sense of loss and he remembered why he had so desperately wanted to be dead when the battle with Satan was over.
Jo nodded. "What about his… um… baggage? I mean, I really only know what you've told me and what I can glean from being around him, but I'm kind of under the impression that the guy has a few issues."
"He agrees with you." Dean said, smiling at Bobby. He reached under the table and took Castiel's hand. "We're Pacific Northwest kinda guys now."
"Cas, buddy, it's cool. They aren't going to bite." He said, smiling at him.
"Cas pulled me out. It was Cas and no one else." Dean cried. "And you've got archangels on your side now! Sammy and Adam have been down there for decades!"
"I have a BA in psychology and an MA in sociology. Both from Collins College. I'm pretty much a slave to that place." Castiel said wryly.
"Gabriel has succeeded in his task. Dear Sammy will be back in your life soon enough, Dean." He flashed him a smile.
Dean had never had a normal sleeping patterns due to years of keeping watch over Sam while his parents were gone and four and a half years of doing most of his studying and reading at night. Since he'd met Castiel, his hours had become more regular and he'd gone from his normal four hours to six or seven hours. He wasn't sure why having Cas nearby had made him sleep more. Maybe it was because he didn't have to look out for Castiel like he'd had to look out for Sam. Maybe it was purely comfort. Maybe it was because Castiel was somewhat of an old man and spent hours in bed, sleeping, grading papers or reading. He didn't know why, but he certainly didn't mind it.
"Sorry." He muttered, and returned to his work.
Minutes, later, Cas finished chanting and unsurprisingly, the barn began to quake. Dean felt sick. He hadn't missed this at all.
"This is purely a physical sensation." He replied.
"Gabriel will do his best, but we will have to be here. For both of them." Castiel said. "I told you when we summoned Crowley, that the peaceful part of our lives was over. It appears that I was right."
Dean swallowed. His entire reason for majoring in biology, going into research, his determination to search for a cure that probably didn't exist was Sam. Yet, Dean hadn't been home in years and he hadn't talked to Sam in weeks. He was a dismal excuse for a brother.
The guy was Castiel. Dean couldn't exactly see his face because his vision was so blurred with booze and tears, but the strangely literal way he spoke gave it away.
"We will find whatever this is, Dean… and we will bring Sam and Bobby back. This I swear to you. This will be better, Dean." He said in a determined voice. It was the second or third time he had said this, like it was his new mantra. Yet he couldn't say how the two of them would do any of this.
Castiel shrugged. "I don't really have many plans. I used to go home and spend them with my last set of foster parents, the ones I told you about, but they're older now. They go to Michigan to be with their grandchildren. I mean, real blood is thicker than state-sponsored blood, I guess."
It was true. The dude didn't look old enough to rent a car or possibly even drink a beer, let alone teach the malleable minds of American youth.
In a way though, he was glad that Castiel had stood up to him, because it was finally starting to sink in that his Castiel wasn't made of glass. More than likely, he was made of stone. He'd proven that to Dean the night before. Just like he'd proven it to him time and time again just by existing, just by smiling, despite all of the terrible things that had happened to him.
Tears welled in Dean’s eyes and he wiped them away roughly. Miracle jumped off her chair and moved to Dean’s side, nuzzling at his hand. He held his breath to hold back a sob as he scratched her head.
to where all the action happens. That’s just pervy.”
“An accident? What—what do you mean? What happened?”
Castiel shook with laughter. “Is she always that intense?”
“It’s Charlie,” he said in explanation as he looked at the screen with a snort of laughter. “She’s going out with Jo tonight.” He leaned in close and held the phone between them so that they could both see the message Charlie had sent to both Dean and Sam.
The party took a definite upswing now that the group was gathered together. Gabriel and Meg fit in surprisingly well, and Castiel’s chest swelled with happiness at their inclusion. He’d worried that they’d be a bit much to handle, but Gabriel had already won the friends over with his humor, apparently becoming fast-friends with both Charlie and Sam. He suspected that the low bar that Meg had set while meeting them all the first time around had something to do with their acceptance tonight. She seemed much less cold and guarded around Gabriel and it was a nice change of pace.
He climbed into the center of the nest and fell down to his knees, wondering whether Dean had gone to tell Sam what he’d discovered. That question was answered a moment later when the door re-opened.
He let out a surprised gasp and Dean could feel him squirm beneath him for a moment. Castiel had propped himself up on his elbows, watching with hooded eyes as Dean’s tongue slid slowly up and down his shaft. Dean was thoroughly enjoying the sight of Castiel’s parted lips and darkened eyes and enjoying the feeling of his breathing changing from heavy sighs and little gasps to not breathing at all when Dean traced circular patterns around the tip with his tongue.
Dean laughed and turned leave, but Gabriel’s hand grabbed loosely at his arm before he got too far. “Hey, Dean?”
Eileen had been working a case east of Atlanta when she got Sam’s text. He’d be passing through town with Dean and Castiel on their way back to the bunker, and in true Sam fashion, he wanted to stop and check-in, though Eileen suspected some ulterior motives. With a few ulterior motives of her own, she agreed to meet at the shabby diner on the edge of town.
He realized that they were still staring, so he reached for Castiel’s hand once more. The movement seemed to draw him out of wherever his thoughts had carried him off to as well. They made their way inside, both wearing shy smiles. Jo was behind the bar, and she waved them over when she saw the pair enter.
“Dude, no. This is a plastic douche-mobile. It’s a computer with wheels, not a car.”
Castiel leaned against the kitchen counter, eating one of Dean and Jo’s waffle-cookie concoctions. Sam had fallen asleep half an hour ago with his phone resting on his chest, and Jo and Charlie were slurring drunken whispers to one another beneath the blanket on the couch. Dean set a few empty beer bottles into the sink, laughing to himself as he looked around. Game night always seemed to end this way—drunken bodies sleeping wherever they landed at the end of the night and a mess to clean up the next morning.
In response to Dean’s tone, John stood up straighter as he addressed his son. “Last time I checked, this was my house.”
He washed his hands and turned back to watch the man that had undeniable captivated him toss the burgers into a pan. He sat in a happy silence, letting the possibilities flow through his mind as Dean artfully twirled his spatula.
“Nice guy,” Sam chimed in. “You’d like him, Ellen. They’ve only been on, like, one date and Dean’s already hooked.” Dean’s eyes stung with realization as he finally caught his brother’s eye. Not only did Sam understand now, he’d understood when he told him on Saturday night.
It was nearing 3 o’clock in the afternoon when Dean’s phone vibrated in his pocket.
“Nope.”
A light rain had begun to fall when Jo pulled her silver Honda into the gravel driveway. Charlie was initially surprised to find that there were no other vehicles around, but then, it was quite possible that Dean had parked Baby inside and out of the rain.
Castiel tilted his head slightly in confusion, and it was the most adorable thing Dean had ever seen. “Ship us? I don’t understand.”
He felt a sudden urge to be present when a hand touched his own. He wanted to latch onto that hand and drag himself back to consciousness, to let them know he was there with them, but when he gripped the hand that touched him it was no more than a weak squeeze.
He wasn’t sure if his father’s disappointment was directed at his decision about school or about the truck, but John shook his head as he climbed the porch steps and made his way inside the house. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, unclenching his fists where his nails had dug into the heel of his hands.
“He’s pretty great, actually. Physical therapist, works with kids, nice guy, funny,” she listed. “Gay.”
Castiel remembered the way Dean had jumped after he’d sent the message and the corner of his mouth curved into a slight smile. It steeled his confidence to hear that Dean would have been willing to take the initiative and ask him out first. He may not have been out of the closet yet, but it seemed, or at least Castiel hoped, that he was ready to open the door.
"You’re… more."
some things!”
In the next few minutes, they had their sleeves rolled up to the elbows, and Dean rolled the dough out flat. Castiel mostly watched until Dean put him to work trimming the dough around a large plate and fitting it to the tins. When they were set, Dean skirted around Ellen to put them in the oven for a few minutes before adding the filling.
“Quiet, handmaiden,” Charlie quipped in return. "I'm wearing her down."
“Mmh. Good.” Castiel sleepily smiled closing both eyes again. “’M’all yours too.”
, I said. No way. He wouldn’t just
.” That drawling voice could only be one person. Castiel cringed.
“He was excited to get to ride the Harley one more time before putting her away,” he said solemnly. “All for nothing. You know what she wanted? She wanted to tell me that I should be with
Dean huffed a laugh. “Yeah, you got that right. And the next step is convincing you to go on that real date with me on Friday,” he said bravely.
Sam slammed the heavy passenger door of Dean’s ’67 Impala as soon as they were parked in the lot beside The Roadhouse. He stomped off toward the door, clearly relieved to have finally escaped the confines of the vehicle.
They reached the edge of the parking lot that led to the bar’s entrance, but Dean stopped walking, staring at the green door thoughtfully.
“I KNEW IT! I FUCKING KNEW IT!” Sam yelled, laughing as he approached. He shook his head with laughter. “God—how long—when—,” he stopped to let out an exasperated sigh, eyeing his brother’s shocked smile and handing over his key cards. “Enjoy your haunted honeymoon suite.”
bed, he remembered, letting himself bask happily in the thought. He smiled up at Dean who was walking alongside him as Meg steered his wheelchair toward the parking lot.
“And if he doesn’t accept you, you still have people—
“The Impala.”
“Alright, then...” He gestured at the people that crowded the barroom. “What’s your type?”
Sam pointed tellingly at his brother.
“Uh—thanks?” Dean rubbed at his eyes with some pressure, attempting to calm the spots that were swirling before him. When he could see again, he raised a brow as he took in the man’s appearance. His hair was combed back neatly, and he was wearing a burgundy button down with intricately embroidered details on the cuffs and collar. “Looks like Cas and me aren’t the only ones heading out tonight.”
Dean could tell that the confrontation with John was weighing on Bobby. Having noticed Dean watching the man, Castiel bumped his knee with his own, giving him a meaningful look. The corner of Dean’s mouth tipped up just a bit as he wondered how Castiel did that—how he could just tell Dean what he was thinking with those stunning blue eyes. He nodded, giving Castiel’s knee a squeeze as he stood to follow Bobby who’d gone into the kitchen for a fresh beer.
“I’m Dr. Hendricks. So, Castiel… he’s suffered a concussion, a pretty bad one. He did regain consciousness for a bit, which is a good thing. But he’s also got three broken ribs, a broken ankle, and some pretty gnarly road rash that’s going to need to be watched for infection, so the meds may have him out of it for a while. I know it doesn’t look like it, but he’s very lucky. His helmet definitely saved his life today. We’ll still have to monitor him for while for any internal injuries, but so far from the looks of the scans, he’s gonna be okay.”
Castiel broke into a smile, “Perfect.”
Two years ago, Sam and Jess made the decision to break up. Though they had planned on going to Stanford together, Sam reluctantly decided to stay in Lawrence after graduation at his father’s behest, and after a year of trying to make it work, they decided that neither wanted to put the other under the pressure of a long distance relationship fresh into their college years. So they decided that parting on good terms would be better than the slow suffering.
He moved down the driveway between the vehicles, turning his attention to his truck. He opened the door and climbed in, starting the engine and shutting the door without saying a word. When his truck backed out and sped off down the road, the noise in Dean’s ears began to fade.
Dean tore his eyes away from the tubes and wires to look up.
“Welcome to the Rosemont Motel, gentlemen. My name is Marla. How can I help you? Are you here for the festival?”
that he wasn’t there when we needed him… I
Castiel tilted his head to touch Dean’s. “She’s beautiful. I can see you in her smile.”
“Are you a relative?” the driver asked, confirming John’s dreaded suspicion.
“What, your big brother can’t come to check up on you?” Dean retorted, avoiding all the reasons that were currently swimming around in his head for coming to see his brother. He pulled two beers from the green cooler that sat just behind the cab of the truck and offered one to Sam. “You were kinda down when I dropped you off last night. Just thought you might need some company.”
“Uh, yeah, Cas and I—we, uh,” Dean reached over to thread their fingers together and the corners of Jody’s mouth quickly turned upward in surprise, “we’ve been together for a few weeks now.”
,” he said, retrieving his shirt from the angel’s hands. “Just don’t—don’t mention it to Sammy. Or anyone. Okay?”
Castiel grinned at his success and Sam chuckled at Dean’s obvious inability to resist him.
“She invited you to dinner, though, so it must have went well,” Dean said brightly.
But still, the shape looked familiar.
“So, Illinois, huh?” When Castiel looked up, he caught Dean’s green eyes staring back at him. “I, uh—I’m born and raised here. Still doing the whole family dinners on Sunday night thing with my Uncle Bobby and Jo’s mom, Ellen. Bobby practically raised Sam and me.”
“Well, it’s been a couple of weeks, so far,” Sam said, “but he told Ellen and Bobby about the meetings. They’re helping him.”
Castiel’s fingers curled around Dean’s palm in a soft squeeze and Dean bolted upright. “Cas?!”
“Dad’s not home right now,” Sam assured, though it seemed to have the opposite effect on Dean that Sam had intended. It took him only a moment to realize his mistake. “I mean, he’s not
... I’m ready.”
“Okay, okay, I’m sorry!” Dean relented, now standing shoulder to shoulder with his victim. “Okay, so you just want to kinda squish it up, mix everything up like this...” He placed his hands over Castiel’s, sending a wave of electricity through him as he guided him in blending the spices. "Then you’re gonna flatten it out like this.” He took a handful of beef from the bowl, forming it into a neat patty and presenting it to Castiel. “Got it?”
When Castiel turned to look at Dean, he was already looking back at him, holding up the silver angel keychain that now had a familiar old key added to it. “How about we go for a ride?”
She let out a long, slow breath. “Yeah—yeah, I’m good. What about you?”
from me?”
It took a moment for Castiel’s statement to wash over Dean, and when it finally did, it hit him like a tidal wave.
They held one another as though the world would tear them apart if they loosened their grip. It wasn’t until Dean felt Cas shivering that he finally released their hold to pull him back toward the open garage. They were both still reeling from the shock of it all when they sat against the hood of the Impala in the open doorway, huddled close. They didn’t speak, but there would be time for that later.
“I don’t remember my mother,” Castiel offered gently. “It’s just been us and my dad for as long as I remember. I’m the youngest, so Anna and Gabriel have some memories of her, but as for me—nothing.”
“So, what’s the plan?” Dean asked through a mouthful of food, waving the remainder of the pancake around with one hand while he poured syrup over the plates with the other.
“Hey, stud,” she countered, “Good night?” She wiggled her brows suggestively.
Castiel looked up into hopeful green eyes, his brows raised in response.
He stepped forward, close enough to feel warm breath against his jaw. He slowly slid his hands from the former-angel’s hands, moving as though time didn’t exist anymore. His fingers traced the bones of his wrists, the muscles of his forearms, the crook of his elbow in an unhurried reverie. They swept over biceps and shoulders, sliding across a now wingless back, before fitting neatly below his ears as he cupped Castiel’s face. Just as slowly, just as gently, his lips found Castiel’s.
“He’s great, Donna. In fact, he made a special request for one of your peach pies, so I’ll have to make sure to get one before I leave here.” He gave her a wink and a grin. “For now, can I just get my usual?”
Castiel leaned back to see Dean’s face, eyes narrowed. “What’s happening in an hour?”
“I think so,” she answered, as she looked between the two worried men. “Just gotta wait for him to wake up now to know for sure.”
He and Castiel leaned into one another on their wicker loveseat, fingers intertwined, and Dean decided that if he could choose one moment to live for the rest of eternity, it would be this one. And as the countdown began, he closed his eyes.
Dean thought
“Cold sandwich in the garage office,” Dean answered, hoping for a better offer.
When Dean and Cas finally made it to the kitchen in the morning, Sam was already there, bent over a newspaper and nursing a mug of coffee. They shared a glance before they began moving around the kitchen, Cas pouring two mugs of coffee while Dean pulled a box of cereal and a pair of bowls from a shelf.
The rest of their meal was quiet. Castiel seemed distracted and Dean seemed anxious, but Sam was in a great mood. Once they were done at the diner, they double-checked the Impala for their supplies and headed out. The ride, too, was quiet, though Sam caught the lingering looks being passed between Dean and Castiel through the rearview mirror.
He wasn’t prepared for this yet, and scrambled to think.
He slid his key into the lock but paused before turning it. He quirked up one corner of his mouth in an attempt to lighten the mood and gave Dean his best puppy eyes. “You know, it’d be a shame for you to have come this far for nothing. Would you like to come in?”
“You know what—yes. I do need your assistance with something. Give me a few—I’m gonna go, uh, get some stuff ready.” Dean stood up with resolve in his eyes and started moving backward toward the hallway that led to his bedroom. He looked at his watch. “Meet me in the garage in about an hour,” he said as he disappeared through the doorway, only to peek his head back in a moment later. “Oh, and, uh, wear the FBI suit. The nice blue one.” And with that he was gone again.
With a nod, the paramedic climbed into the ambulance as John jogged back to his truck. Giving up on the main road, he sped off down a side street while he dialed Dean’s number. No answer. He tried again, but to no avail. He knew that Dean wouldn’t answer his calls.
Dean cleared his throat. “I, um, told her that I’m—that I’m bi.” He let out a quick puff of breath. Even though he and Charlie had talked about it at length today, it was the first time he’d ever just stated it outright. “And that I’m kinda into… well, you.” He stood up, pacing toward his kitchen, thankful that Castiel couldn’t see his red face. “She’s going to help me tell Sammy. I, uh, tried telling him first, but I guess I probably wasn’t clear enough.”
ever be this happy. This is new ground.
“Dean—”
Dean smiles back. “A family?”
awake?”
Cas’ smile turns a little sad. He moves forward to rest their foreheads together.
“Cas?”
“Please.”
kid. Bobby smiles.
“Yeah, Bobby. I freakin’ hope so.”
SEE? SEE THE  CW???? WAS IT THAT FUCKING HARD????????
“I think we might be.”
He digs the palms of his hands into his eyes, a little.
me. Right from the damn start, you’ve had me, Cas. I may not have admitted it to you or Sam or even myself but for God’s sake…” He moves them forehead-to-forehead again. “Cas, I love you too. I’ve
“Really though, Cas. You never even asked. I had no idea it was even on the table. I didn’t know angels could feel love like that. Y’know… romantic love.”
Castiel smiles gently.
“Man, I— I don’t even— how are you—”
Dean gazes into Castiel’s eyes.
A bright grin is plastered across Jack’s face, and he raises up a hand in greeting.
Cas looks down, bashful and maybe a little scared. “I wasn’t sure you’d want to see me.”
Miracle is back. Dean throws the ball. He chuckles lightly to himself, but there is no mirth in it.
“Hi Dean! I heard your prayers!”
“You sprang that on me at the worst possible moment, man, and I’m sorry I froze, I’m sorry I didn’t answer but that was a hell of a lot to spring on a guy all at once.”
“Heaven’s meant to be paradise. I’m meant to be havin’ my eternal peace right now. I gotta say, it’s pretty good so far. I’ve got Baby. I’ve got Sammy. Sammy’s got Eileen. Bobby’s down the road.”
He turns the radio back on and keeps driving.
“Indeed. I believe we have waited far long enough.”
He wipes at the tears quickly, like if he can remove the evidence quickly enough it will be as if it never happened.
Cas laughs.
“You said — dammit,” Dean presses another kiss to Cas’ hair. “Cas, you said you couldn’t have what you wanted.”
“Twelve damn years.”
Dean shakes his head, still chuckling, “It’s great, kiddo. Better than last time I was here, for sure.” Once again, his smile drops. “Hey, how’d you get C— How’d you get his help on this if he’s…”
“Dean,” Cas tries to pull away. Dean holds him tighter.
Castiel smiles widely, throwing Miracle’s ball to the other side of the park again.
He smiles now, tears still spilling.
“Hey, angel,” he murmurs. “What do ya say we go find Sammy, huh? Him and Eileen have gotta be around here somewhere.”
“I can dig that.”
“... too?”
He sighs.
Dean cannot believe his eyes.
“How is this possible? Cas- Cas you died. I saw you die. How are you here? Not that I’m complaining but… How?”
“It’s like you just decided for me, man. I know that’s not what you meant to do, of course I know that, but all this time… Team Free Will…”
Dean looks down at his lap, smiling faintly as he shakes his head in wonder. He gazes out to the world in front of him, and the smile slips. His hands shake. Bobby reaches over to pat him on the shoulder.
Dean looks embarrassed.
A deep, familiar voice speaks, “It wouldn’t be the first time I annoyed them into letting me go.”
the having. If Cas’ deal with the Shadow was still in effect, the pair of them would probably both be taken. Neither of them have ever been this happy. Neither of them thought that
Dean nudges a little closer, tilting his head slightly.
“Wait, kid, so you’re saying—”
“I’ll come visit you sometime. It’s damn good to see ya, old man.”
“Hello Dean.”
When they pull back again, Cas rests a hand on Dean’s cheek. He strokes his thumb gently over Dean’s cheekbone, brushing over the freckles there as his eyes move slowly all over Dean’s face. Dean stares back unabashed, finally allowing himself just to look as he has always wanted to. No excuses, no throwaway jokes. He just stands there, taking in the beautiful view of the man he loves.
“Castiel.”
Jack holds up his hands placatingly, seeing the oncoming anger.
“We’re a love story for the freakin’ ages, sunshine.”
Dean Winchester… doesn’t know what else to do at this point.
After weeks of making breakfast with his brother, taking care of Miracle and pretending everything was okay, he finally breaks. He sits forward, head in his hands, and begins to sob.
"Jack did all that?" he marvels. Their kid.
Dean looks around Bobby's yard, amazed. He had expected... something else. The Greatest Hits of Dean Winchester for the rest of time — but this was better than he ever could have dreamed. Bobby. Rufus down the road. Mom and dad, just a few miles away.
“Yeah, Cas. Every life I’ve had, except maybe that first one before we’d met. But ever since then, Cas. Ever since. Twelve damn years.”
“Take care of yourself, idjit. This is heaven, damn it, and your kid is literally the new God. You’ll find a way to get your angel back.”
Cas’ smile widens.
Dean Winchester is sitting on a bench in a park in Heaven.
A calm settles over him.
He lets out a soft grunt as Dean slams into him, holding the boy tight to his chest. Dean is crying again, this time for much happier reasons, and he begins to laugh.
He can’t make out the person’s face, but they begin to walk over, shaking the ball at Miracle to get him to follow. The closer this stranger gets, the more certain Dean feels that he has fallen asleep at the bench. He must be dreaming.
“Dammit, kid. I missed your stupid face.”
“You’re the love of my goddamn life. Of my death too, if you’d get your feathery ass over here already.”
Castiel rubbed his eyes with his free hand. He knew it wasn’t likely that the bike had made it through the accident in any better shape than he was in himself, and yet the idea of it just being gone hurt.
“I told her she can go to hell. I already have my happily ever after. I have you, Cas. And no one—
It fell quiet again as they simply smiled at one another until a slight cough from behind them finally broke the silence.
Dean groaned. “Ugh, I forgot about game night.” He could hear Sam laughing on the other end of the line. “What time is Charlie gonna be invading my place?”
With another laugh, Dean pecked a kiss on Castiel’s forehead and managed to slip free from his grasp. Cas let his head drop on the pillow and covered his head with the blanket. “There’s extra toothbrushes in the cabinet,” mumbled the lump.
Having postponed the inevitable long enough, Dean made his way back to the waiting area, holding his breath as he pushed through the door. He was hit with a small wave of relief when he found only Gabriel and Meg in one corner of the room, waving him over.
He turned to face Castiel who was licking the crumbs from his lips. Dean couldn’t pinpoint what it was about the man that called to him, but just watching him standing here so casually in Dean’s own kitchen made his heart skip a beat. He positioned himself in front of him, placing a hand on each side, pinning him to the counter.
“I don’t mind, Cas. I, uh… I’m not really in any hurry to go home,” Dean answered somberly, his eyes on the floor.
come. He blushed as he thought about how he’d allowed himself to gush a little during Jack’s appointment this week, a reward for the progress that Jack had made with Claire’s persistent help. He hadn’t told them who he was dating and had figured that there would be no harm in it. Though, he hadn’t planned on standing face-to-face with them either.
“I, uh, like you too, Cas.” They stared for a long moment with smiles in their eyes. “I, uh, guess you wanna get home soon, huh? I can give you a ride if you want.”
“Hospital cafeteria food isn’t much of an upgrade, but if you’re interested, maybe you can finally ask me on that date in person,” Castiel said, optimism lacing the words.
“They were right, y’know,” he whispered, breathy and low. “You’re good for me, Cas. You’re so good.”
“’Morning,” Sam greeted, not looking up from his paper.
well. We—”
The closer they got to leaving, the more anxious Dean grew. He paced around, checking and double checking the room, making sure they’d packed all their belongings that had migrated to the hospital over the past week. He wrote notes about Castiel’s medication and he studied the physical therapy schedule they’d been handed that morning.
Dean looked between them curiously. “What’s up?”
He pulled out his phone as Dean sat down, realizing that Dean, too, was staring at his own phone with an interesting smile.
, had taken to following Dean around the bunker, watching him from afar at first, tilting her head in a way that made Dean’s heart ache. He considered all the mistakes he’d made throughout his entire adult life, pushing away the people he loved, when he found her watching him sleep, resting her chin at the edge of his bed one morning. And finally, he reached out to her. He pulled her up into his arms and ran his fingers through her fur as she curled up beside him. And from that moment, they became inseparable.
, but that ass is mine later.”
“You boys mean everything to me.” Bobby said as he scrubbed his hand down his face in an effort to wipe the emotion away. “I just… want you both to know that.”
Castiel’s head dropped. His chest felt heavy, like it was being crushed under the weight of anger and fear. Dean slid across the bench seat in an instant, reaching across to cup Castiel’s face in his hands and lock eyes once more.
Dean gave a nervous laugh, ducking his head again. “Yeah, I guess I am.”
As Gabriel followed Dr. Hendricks back into the room, Dean stepped back, reclaiming his hold of Castiel’s hand. The weak squeeze he got in return filled him with relief. He knew Castiel wasn’t out of the woods yet, but it still felt like a win.
—but, I mean, yeah. If you’re happy, I’m happy. And Cas definitely makes you happy.”
The words echoed in his head every time he looked at Cas. Except now—
“Good, I don’t wanna be worrying my boyfriend is laying in some patch of ice on side of the road—" Dean froze, his mouth still open but no words escaping.
“He freaked out about telling
“You don’t understand, Cassie. She’s a total bitch. She drives me crazy. She’s bossy. She calls me on my shit. We fight like cats and dogs. I’m pretty sure she set my bed on fire
“Hey, Sammy. I, uh—I hope you weren’t busy. There’s just—I had this idea that I wanted to run by you.”
They sat in silence for a while in which Sam stared blankly at the dashboard, thinking about the kind of life he'd once wanted.
“Official business, baby bro,” he said, patting his camera bag. “Gettin’ paid the big bucks to be on call to document the miracle of birth.”
Dean grimaced. “Yeah, me too. But he loves it.”
“Should I be jealous?”
John looked back and forth between his two sons. “Can we talk? Please.”
time, he swore, although that wasn’t the truth.
better with you.” His voice shook, but he was smiling. “Your shitty date with Meg is the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you, Cas.”
Sweet.
Dean’s muscles contracted as he spilled over his own hand, and Castiel came crashing right behind him. Arms weak, he dropped to the bed, immediately pulling Castiel down into a long, deep, and meaningful kiss that took his breath away. This may have been his first time with a man, but he was no stranger to sex. And this… This was more than that.
He considered Sam’s words as a wave of relief slowly washed over him. The weight of years of secrets lifted from his shoulders. He was lighter, happier—giddy with the freedom as he threw an arm around Cas’s shoulder and kissed him.
Dean stopped and sighed. "Okay, God, man. I am sorry. I just… I was hot."
"They do that." Dean admitted. "As fucked up as my family is, they're actually pretty great with new people. Especially Sammy. I know I've said this, but that son-of-a-bitch can read people. I'm glad my dad isn't here though. This would have been a totally different experience if he were hanging around for some reason."
Michael Myers dragged the woman by her hair down a flight of stairs, while she screamed in a fake, exaggerated way.
Castiel nodded and smiled feebly. "Does it make sense now?"
"What about those paintings? The ones you shredded? What were those all about? I liked them." Dean said.
"Thank you." Cas said hoarsely, his face still buried. "Dean, I am so lost."
"Your dad's a cop?" Castiel asked.
"She sucks." Dean said, taking a swig of his beer. "I mean, seriously, she was just stabbed in the heart and now she's being dragged the stairs to a certain death. You'd think she'd have more terror on her face."
"You didn't have to cancel your class. I'm fine." He lied.
"I know. You are not ready. But you will be."
"Where's the fire?" He said, still looking annoyed.
Across the room, Castiel stood there, watching them with a strange look in his eyes. Dean remembered their conversation the day before about the Singer family. In a moment of strange clarity that almost made him laugh, Dean hoped like hell that this fucked up family scene wasn't making his boyfriend nostalgic for parents he'd never had.
Castiel shoved her, sending Jo toppling to the ground. "Get off me, you fucking dyke!" He growled. "I'm out of here."
"Now, don't laugh, but I'm thinking about getting Princess Leia in a slave bikini straddling a 20-sided die. Maybe on my ribs or my thigh." Charlie said, tucking a piece of red hair behind her ear.
"Things are going well?"
"I don't know why she just won't leave him completely. They haven't even been together in years. Sam said that he heard that he's dating women around town and has been since she threw him out for the last time when she came back from Ohio."
"You're a trooper. I'm sorry to put you through this." Dean said, almost begging for his forgiveness. "As soon as my mom gets back, we'll go home, okay? I'm sorry, Cas."
Sam smiled. "So I'm allowed to do that now?"
"Dean." Castiel breathed, almost moaning. "We should go to the bathroom."
Dean didn't say anything. He simply pulled Cas in closer, into sort of a half hug. He threaded his free hand into Cas's and tried to give it a reassuring squeeze. He felt Cas sigh into his chest and then he turned over so he was half facing him. They lay there for awhile like that. Dean felt how tense Cas was, how when he breathed, he shuddered. He could tell he was trying to hold it together.
"I'll come with you. If you still want me to come, that is." Castiel said, looking down a little bit, smiling shyly.
Dean clutched Cas, grateful to be back in Bobby's house, back in Cas's arms, grateful to be out of his own head.
Castiel reached up and planted a kiss on his mouth. Dean kissed him back as chastely as he could, even though the room was dark, the other man was warm and relaxed against him and Dean couldn't help but notice how Castiel looked , how he smelled, and how badly all of these things were making him want to touch him all over.
"Maybe he's like me." Dean said, smiling a little bit. "Bad at this stuff."
Castiel grins. "I love the Birds. Hitchcock is amazing."
"Yeah, I guess I got you out of this whole debacle. Not a bad gift at all." Dean said.
"My brother is crazy and I can't stand to be around him. I know that's horrible and it's not his fault, but God help me, Cas, just talking to him on the phone is impossible. Just hearing his voice makes me feel like I was run over by a train." Dean said.
"Where is he, Dean?"
Castiel stares at him. Naomi stares at Castiel and he can feel her revulsion toward him and Dean coming off her in waves. She keeps her back and her face completely straight though.
"I'm mean? I'm the nicest guy in the universe." Dean slurred. "So fucking nice to put up with this bullshit."
They got into the car and drove. Dean put on some Zeppelin and they didn't talk. Castiel looked out the window, looking pensive, but less broken than he had when Dean had arrived at his apartment. They drove out past some cornfields and finally, Dean pulled into a park on the side of the road.
They went up the stairs to the room they had been sharing since they'd moved into Bobby's house. He wondered if Bobby would mind that two dudes were sleeping together and slowly progressing to a full-on sexual relationship under his roof. Bobby had nearly killed Dean when he found him in bed with Rhonda Hurley. Bobby had never been fond of sex happening under his roof.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Just because it had been a couple of years since I'd hooked up with a dude doesn't mean it was a 'phase.' You of all people should know this." He said, actually feeling rather hurt at her insinuation.
Dean thought for a second. He wasn't sure how to answer that without lying or making Castiel angry. He did feel pity for him, but it wasn't in a negative way. He was actually impressed with the way Castiel had come from a background like that and done so well for himself academically and economically. He knew he had to choose his words carefully.
"I love Halloween." Castiel said, watching Michael Myers stab a woman around their age in the heart.
"He keeps repeating 'I know it's not real' and he recognized me." She said.
"Just because I don't like the equipment doesn't mean I can't appreciate beauty. I can appreciate art. This boy is a piece of art." Charlie said, licking her lips and winking suggestively at Jo, who in turn just stuck her tongue out at Charlie.
"His outfit is rather Spartan." Castiel said, raising an eyebrow.
"Crowley knows about it, because of Samandriel. He betrayed us. But I know you won't. Not this time. You are meant to protect it, Castiel. It is written."
"Cas, Cas, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just can't lose you. I cannot lose you too, Cas. I couldn't bear it. I need you, baby. I can't live without you. We will find another way." He sobbed, clutching him close.
"Honestly, I'm surprised the visit was pleasant for nearly two days." Dean said, shrugging. "This is what it's like. This is what it's always been like. Hell, I'm used to it. Sam's used to it. I'm just sorry that you have to get used to it."
"I'm Magenta, you moron. Haven't you ever seen it?" Charlie said. She turned to Jo. "Is he putting up a fight?"
"I will recover." The man said, his voice all gravelly and coarse. He locks eyes with Dean. His eyes are a stormy blue, deep and intense, almost
"Cas… I don't know…" Dean breathed. Cas interrupted him by kissing him again, moving against him in a way that was unbelievably tantalizing.
It was one thing to choke him, one thing to kick his ass until he was a bloody pulp, but another thing
Jo chuckled and poured herself another glass of wine. Dean reached his glass across the table and she obliged him by refilling his and Mary's glasses as well. She glanced at Sam, who was drinking a Pepsi. Sam was essentially a 60-year-old woman when it came to many of his food and beverage tastes, so he loved wine. Dean and Jo could basically read each others' minds and Dean knew she wanted to offer Sam a glass. She didn't. She seemed to realize that Sam couldn't drink alcohol, under any circumstances.
Dean just let out a strangled cry and stomped out of the bar. He tripped on the way out and someone yelled "GOOD GOING, CASANOVA!" which was hilarious to him for some reason, because of Castiel's name and because of the entire situation. He plodded up the road, laughing and almost crying at the same time, trying to pretend Castiel wasn't behind him. About one block into the walk, Dean felt his insides turn over. He stopped at a telephone pole and bent over and threw up all of the whiskey and beer he'd drowned his sorrows in that night.
"Sammy told me to go to Lisa and Ben, Cas. Should I? Is that what I should do?" Dean asked the angel.
"Sam…" He began. "Castiel has some issues. Like serious, bad issues. He's not schizophrenic, but the dude's been through a lot. More than I can tell you and more than I can even imagine. Needless to say, it's left him with some war wounds. For a long time and even now, he was…"
"I almost had sex with Cas." He said casually.
Balthazar groaned and sat back down. "Let me guess: Sammy?"
He sounded like a Pitchfork review. Charlie would be creaming herself right now.
Dean hadn't used the Colt since their disastrous meeting with Lucifer that had resulted in the deaths of Ellen and Jo. Cas had insisted they bring it since it had two bullets left.
"I'm sorry." He whispered. "I can't… I hate it when I get like this."
"Hell no. Social sciences are actually my worst subject. It's the political science version of the course, 'Social Theory of Political Thought' is actually the course title, and it's ridiculous as it sounds. Also, not a grad student."
"You don't understand, Dean. You know almost everything about me. You're so strong for me, for everyone. I want to know all of you, even the bad parts. I want to be strong for you too. Especially right now. I know you need someone."
"So, Cas, do you have a girlfriend?" Jo asked, shooting a conspiratorial look at Charlie.
Dean awoke on the couch in the living room, an ice pack on his face. Cas was seated across the room, in the loveseat.
"No more hunting." Dean said firmly. "At least not for awhile. If you do hunt, it'll be with me. Anything else you want to do though, it's fair game. Your life is yours to live now. We've paid our debt to this world. Can you handle that, Sammy?"
"What do you have for me?" Cas interrupted. I need to see your notes, textbook, graded tests, and any study materials so I can glean how much time this will take for the two of us."
"Thanks, Cas! I think my outfit is a lot of fun. You'd look awesome in a tutu." Jo said, sounding genuine for once.
"I was younger, of course. I was 12 the first time… after…" Castiel shook his head. "I was in and out of state-mandated therapy for awhile, and then a couple of years ago, while I was getting my master's, well, let's just say I had a bad period. I was in and out a few times that year. That's when I saw people like Sam."
"We never do things the normal way." Sam says, shrugging.
"That's horrible."
"Sammy, it's going to be okay. It'll be okay this time. We're in this together." He said, trying to be soothing, trying to keep the rage from bubbling back up to the surface. Mary, so clearly heartbroken, was keeping his rage down, but he knew he could resurface at any moment. He didn't know where Sam's mental illness came from, but Dean knew deep inside that he had inherited his father's temper.
Yep. Most humiliating brunch ever.
They walk up a flight of stairs and walk down an unremarkable hallway and Castiel unlocks the door to his apartment. Once inside, Dean recognizes it as having the same basic set up as Jo's apartment: four walls, a narrow kitchen, a small living room and a bedroom the size of a refrigerator box. Dean walks in and observes the walls, which are covered with horror movie posters and a series of large paintings that are awash in varying colors of dark green and crimson. Castiel has a respectable leather couch and an even more respectable sound system, and a TV that looks like it has been around since the 80s.
"So he likes to write? And he's well rounded? Athletic
"Shut up and get dressed." She said, still smirking at him.
Castiel snaps awake. True, he doesn't sleep, but suddenly, his consciousness comes alive, and it's as if he's waking up for the first time in weeks. His eyes widen and he looks all around him. Wherever he is, it feels familiar, yet he's never seen it. It feels like home- a perverse, terrifying version of home. He's standing up, in a large, white room. Everything is white, the walls, the tiles, the ceiling. It's cavernous. It reminds him of a hospital or an arena.
Castiel glanced up at him and gave him a devious smile. "Fishnets?"
Castiel just shrugged. "I was brought up in the foster care system. I was bound to meet someone like that.
Crowley wiped his eyes. The demon had actually been laughing so hard he had shed tears. He attempted to step forward and then stopped.
"How long was I gone?" Sam whispered, his voice cracking a little bit.
"The feeling's mutual. You know, Dean, I…" Castiel mumbled into his mouth. "Dean, I think there's a 99% chance that I might be in love with you."
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said all that to her." He said.
"Okay everyone! We are 'LARP and the Real Girl' and I'm your hostess for the night, Magenta! Everyone give a big hand for our very own sweet transvestite, Gabe for hosting this beautiful gig!" She cried.
“She’s coming back to Lawrence for a few weeks for winter break. We’re gonna get together then—talk some stuff out.”
Everyone nodded. Sam grabbed a bottled water from the refrigerator and joined them at the table, chuckling as he watched Castiel move a few pancakes from his own plate onto Dean’s.
“Mr. Novak,” Dr. Hendricks greeted cheerfully. “How are you feeling?”
“Hey, you never know. Twenty years from now, I might need evidence of that one time you woke up before me and cooked breakfast. Plus… you just look so–” He gave up talking and instead moved quickly into the kitchen to sweep Castiel into a long kiss.
Castiel moved slowly and deliberately behind him, and Dean was suddenly grateful for the calm pace. He felt at ease in his arms, knowing that Castiel would be careful with him, would never do anything to hurt him, and that feeling filled his chest with warmth. There had been an initial burn when Castiel’s cock had filled him, but the man’s patience and praise soothed him, helping him relax until the pain quickly subsided into a pleasure, growing with each thrust.
Well, I hope you've all enjoyed this journey. ❤ I'm so happy that it's complete, and yet, so sad that it's over! I miss my sweet, fluffy boys already. 😭
“You okay?” he asked.
“I know,” Dean cut him off. “And I get it.” Castiel could see that there was more that he wanted to say, but he didn’t seem able to get the words out yet. “I, uh—I’m gonna tell Charlie tomorrow.”
Dean slid back into the booth with a mischievous grin. Castiel narrowed his eyes in suspicion. Before he could ask for an explanation, their waitress set a plate in front of him—a slice of pie with a single lit candle.
“Dean, I told you, I didn’t mean—”
“Anna!” He beamed, straightening up. He winced as he felt the pull on his sore ribs. “I’m… well, a mess. But a well-medicated mess.”
Dean gave him a mild but telling smile and nodded. With that, Bobby left the kitchen, tightly clutching his beer bottle and leaving Dean to ruminate.
“Dean, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean—I didn’t know—Dean, please, I’m sorry,” Sam pleaded.
“STOP! Stop right there! I don’t wanna know!”
—him back in his arms already. Once they were clean and the towel had been tossed aside, they lay together quietly, contentedly holding one another. Dean’s mind swam with thoughts.
They ate their breakfasts of muffins and pastries, laughing about the night before, and then worked together to clean the mess they’d left behind. When the place was tidy again, they sat around the wooden dining table beside the rain-soaked windows. Dean sat close to Castiel, holding his hand beneath the table. Sam filled the girls and Castiel in on his conversation with Jess and Charlie was embarrassed to learn that a fresh bruise on her elbow came from falling off the coffee table, though she had saved herself from a potential concussion by wearing Castiel’s motorcycle helmet most of the night.
Castiel gave him a wicked smile in the mirror until Dean snatched his comb away with a pout. “Fine, we’ll go… but leave the hair.” He leaned forward, nosing at Castiel’s ear to whisper,
Sam recognized Castiel’s puppy eyes technique and silently commended him on his exceptional pouty face. It didn’t take long for Dean to melt.
“Morning,” Sam greeted as Dean and Castiel exited the Impala, both looking tired and grouchy. He climbed down from the open cargo area of the rental truck where he’d been organizing a few of the boxes he’d already packed.
A Christmas tree had been set up in one corner of the living room since last week, and Sam, Jo, and Charlie were currently fussing over boxes of garland and ornaments. Dean cleared his throat to announce himself, but because Sam was currently distracting Jo by wrapping silver garland around her head, Charlie was the first to spot the new arrivals.
“Oh, no—no!” Castiel laughed, but it was too late. He was surrounded by his siblings, wrapped up in a tight hug and being kissed all over his face. He could feel Dean shaking with laughter beside him, and though there was a slight pinch of pain in his ribs, he did feel better.
“Where is it?” Dean repeated. His eyes were a dangerously dark shade of green and Cas had to swallow hard.
“I called Jess this morning,” Sam said, drawing Dean’s attention away from the recliner.
Dean grinned. “I’m not always a morning person. Just when I bump into you, I guess.” He winked as he made the corner, pulling up in front of the hospital’s main entrance..
He glanced in the rearview mirror at John’s truck parked behind him. He’d have to wait until John moved it before he could back out of the driveway. He planned drive it back to Bobby’s tomorrow night and catch a ride home with Dean after dinner, and the thought led his attention back to Dean who was now loading his toolbox into the Impala’s trunk.
“I definitely wouldn’t say no to that.”
He’d said these exact words before, and from the smile blooming across Castiel’s face, Dean knew that he recognized them.
“I guess my brother didn’t tell you that he lives next door to me,” he explained. Dean touched his forehead to Castiel’s shoulder, trying to hide his face as he attempted to contain a new wave of giggles. “And we were actually just heading out,” he added, placing his palm on Dean’s back and steering him toward the stairs as Meg let out a noise that sounded like a growl and moved on down the hallway.
John paced around the waiting room. He’d been doing so for a while now, much to the annoyance of the woman with the ‘Missouri’ nametag at the registration desk. Sam and Jess arrived shortly after Dean had gone back to see Castiel, and John filled them in on the accident. When Sam and Jess crossed the room to sit against the opposite wall, he didn’t follow them.
Dean froze, hurt. “Is that really what you think?”
“You’re right. You don’t deserve them.” John hung his head, but Castiel continued. “I’ve only known your family for a few weeks, and they’ve been nothing short of amazing. You have no idea, do you? No idea how brave and strong and smart your sons are? Sam is ambitious and loyal to a fault. And Dean—Dean is—is the kindest man I’ve ever met. He’s sincere and sweet. He’s funny, and he’s strong. And he’s brave. He’s
Castiel groggily turned to face Dean with one eye open. He slid his hands around Dean’s slim hips, taking firm hold of his ass. “All mine?”
Ellen was quick to catch on. “Yeah, I think we’re gonna head out, too. Jo? You and Charlie want a ride?”
No. Fuck, no. Not now.
On the twenty-first day, Dean didn’t tiptoe into Castiel’s room. There was no warm mug of coffee waiting on the small table beside the bed. The chair sat empty in the corner of the room. The bed remained cold and empty.
, and Dean was going to enjoy every second he could spare.
“I dunno. But I’m gonna get through this one way or another,” he answered, flexing his hands nervously.
“So, definitely not a morning person,” Dean said as if committing the fact to memory, watching Castiel with mild amusement. Castiel’s cheeks reddened under his gaze.
Dean choked on his beer. “That—That’s, uh, not exactly what I expected,” he coughed, “but, uh, go on.”
“Dean?” There was a swirl of doubt building in Castiel—a worry that Dean may be having second thoughts about the two of them entering the Roadhouse together. The Roadhouse—a place where Dean and the people he cares most about gather. Maybe this was too much. “Is everything okay?”
“I dunno where they are, but they’re—oh, look.” Jo pointed as the Impala turned off the dark road onto the long gravel driveway. It skidded to a stop behind Charlie’s Volkswagen. “You boys are laaaate,” Jo said, waggling a finger at them.
Dean bristled, reading the panic on John’s face. “What are you talking about? What accident?”
Charlie and Jo were busy hanging garland from the bannister of the stairs while Sam wrapped a string of lights around the top branches of the tree. Of course, he’d been assigned this job. He was at least a foot taller than the girls and Dean and Cas had gotten tied up with Ellen. Sam wondered how that conversation had gone, though he knew that Ellen and Bobby would be nothing but accepting. Just as the thought circled his mind, Bobby came in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of beer and seated himself on the couch.
Sam climbed into the passenger seat of the Impala and waited for his brother. Dean stood in the parking lot a few spots away where Castiel’s motorcycle had been parked, the glow of his phone illuminating his face. After several minutes of Dean just staring down at his phone, Sam finally reached over and punched the Impala’s horn. The sound seemed to effectively get Dean's attention and he slid the phone back into his jacket pocket as he opened the car door.
He wandered down the hallway, listening for trouble. When he didn't find any, he knocked twice on Dean's door before opening it.
, that bike! I knew it was a fucking death trap! I shouldn’t have—I have to—I need—” Dean paced back and forth like a tiger in a cage. He was panicking.
When the tense movements subsided, he allowed his finger to breach Dean’s body. The moan the man released was stimulating and Castiel could feel it reverberating through his body. He worked Dean open slowly and carefully, studying his face with every movement. He relished the way Dean’s breath caught and his eyes closed in pleasure, indicating he was ready for more.
While Castiel didn’t get to see his sister often, the two kept in close contact, promising one another a call at least once a week. And while it wasn’t a closeness like having Gabriel next door, it still made him feel connected.
After he’d signed the rental agreement, it had been Jess that suggested they celebrate.
She reached over to pat the teenagers’ joined hands lovingly. “Yeah, they really are. They’ve both come a long way.” She tilted her head a little as she looked between Castiel and Dean. “I didn’t realize you two knew each other. Small world.”
“Hey, barkeep,” Charlie winked. “How’s it going?”
He chuckled as he leaned back into his seat. “Dean’s finally back. Only took him three hours to drop Cas off at his apartment that’s about 10 minutes away.”
she signed.
“Dean?”
“No, they’re magic served by the food gods,” Castiel replied, closing his eyes dramatically.
Charlie shook her head as she picked at a banana nut muffin. “You two were definitely made for each other.” Dean shot a grin at Castiel, only to find him grinning back.
. We’re gonna be
After a few seconds of standing, Jack leaned heavily again on the rails on either side of himself. “So, did you go on that date with the nurse?”
Dean didn’t need to be asked twice. "Hell, yeah. Let’s go.”
“Doesn’t seem fair, does it? He’s not here to see it. But he’d be proud, I think.” Bobby speaks softly, as if he doesn’t want to spook Dean. Then he chuckles. “Man, I didn’t know him all that long but — damn. He sure meant a lot to ya, huh kid?”
“You buddied up with the bastard that took him? That tried to take you?”
Cas nods, bringing his eyes back up to Dean’s and leaning in for another tender kiss before stopping to stay with their foreheads touching and noses brushing.
Dean gets four minutes down the road before he has to turn the radio off. Something about hearing Steve Walsh singing “
“He heard all that?’
Dean huffs a laugh with no humour in it.
Dean’s eyes widen.
(See the end of the chapter for
They pull away for a moment and are unable to stop themselves from grinning again. Dean lets out a noise that is dangerously close to a giggle. They lean back in for another soft kiss, unhurried and content.
Cas bumps his nose against Dean’s.
Cas doesn’t react. His eyes are shut now, just taking in the feeling of being so close to the man he loves. Dean pulls him into another hug, kissing his temple as he tugs the angel forwards.
Dean lets his hands fall to Cas’ waist and he pulls him closer again.
“You took away my choice here, man. I’m not angry about you loving me, Cas. I’m angry that you didn’t let me make up my own mind on this.”
Bobby smiles sadly. “You’d better, kid.”
Castiel gazes back.
Jack’s eyes cut to something behind Dean, grinning bigger than ever.
They grin goofily at each other for a moment, taking in the feeling of the being, the saying, the knowing,
lovin’ you, man, I just didn’t think I had a chance. I didn’t think I was allowed to even wish for a chance.”
“I made a friend! The Shadow really only wants to sleep, you know, and Castiel was really messing that up for them.”
He takes a shuddering breath.
“Yes, Dean. Now that Chuck is gone, the Shadow is calm again. Only problem is that Castiel didn’t actually die, he was just taken. So he was awake in the Empty, again.”
His voice breaks.
“You can have it.”
“Yeah, Cas. Yeah.” He bumps their noses together again. “I love you.”
Castiel smiles back at him.
Cas laughs at him. “Jack brought me back when he came to heaven. He thought I might have some ideas about this place.”
“I don’t know why you ever thought you couldn’t.”
The man with the dog smiles.
“Jack… what do you mean he
A matching smile creeps onto Dean’s face.
“I need you, Cas. I love you.”
He tucks his face into Cas’ neck, breathing deep. He laughs quietly, disbelieving, and burrows in a little further.
“You said… that I love you ‘too’. ‘Too’ implies that you…”
And they kiss again. And again. And then whenever they feel like it for the rest of time.
“Hello Dean.”
Dean makes it another couple of miles before he has to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting a person standing in the middle of the road. He gets out of the car, slamming the door and ready to rip into this dude, but then the person turns around.
“No, man, no way. Cas you have to know. You’ve
He looks out across the grass. Miracle comes bounding over with a tennis ball in his mouth. Dean takes it and throws it as far as he can. Miracle turns and runs.
He closes his eyes and rests his head in his hands.
Surprisingly, Jack’s grin only widens.
Dean opens his eyes. “Huh?”
Dean pulls back to look Cas in the eye. “Cas… it’s been weeks. You didn’t think to come and tell us you were alive?” There are tears in his eyes, barely held back. “To come and tell me?
He scoffs. He doesn’t acknowledge the tears welling up in his eyes.
“There’s a few houses, a little way further down this road.” He ducks his head, suddenly shy. “We could make a home there. The four of us. We could be…”
“So, you like what we’ve done with the place?”
Dean’s arms fall from where they were wrapped around Cas’ shoulders. He can’t believe what he’s hearing — does Cas really not know? It doesn’t seem possible, after his big speech. Except… “
Cas’ face shows the beginnings of a smile.
Cas smiles happily.
Dean’s face darkens.
“Finally.”
Castiel laughs quietly.
Miracle’s ball falls to the ground in front of Dean and bounces a few times before stopping at his feet. Miracle comes sprinting after it, excited that he’s found someone else to play with. The dog picks up the ball in his mouth and runs back over to a figure on the other side of the park. Dean squints, trying to work out who the hell is playing with his dog.
It isn’t the crash either is expecting. There is nothing rushed or violent about it. Their teeth don’t clank together, their noses don't knock uncomfortably. They fit perfectly together. And they kiss softly, sweetly, for the first time. It is calm. It is loving. It is breathtaking.
“We finally caught a damn break,” Dean continues, “I thought we’d finally freakin’ won for once. For good.” He pauses and looks down at the ground, catching his breath. He scrubs his face, wiping the tears away. “There’s always a damn catch.”
Dean spins around so fast he stumbles, until he is caught by a pair of strong arms in a tan trench coat. Hardly believing his eyes, he looks up into Castiel’s face.
"Cas helped."
“Twelve freakin’ years, man. I don’t know if I can ever thank you enough. For coming back to me every time I screwed up.”
“But I don’t know if I can ever truly be at peace, or whatever the hell. Not without you here with me.”
He looks down at his hands. They are shaking. He cannot stop shaking.
He sniffs. The tears are falling down his face now. It’s making it harder to ignore them.
Dean has never blushed this hard in his life. He is ready to let the earth swallow him whole but Cas steps closer and his brian short circuits.
They take a moment to breathe together. Their noses slowly touch. They tilt their heads. Their lips meet. They kiss.
Dean launches himself forward.
Dean throws back the rest of his crappy beer and starts towards Baby.
Jack grips him back just as tightly, grinning all the while. “I missed you too, Dean, even though it’s been less than a month.” They pull back and take a second to smile at each other before Jack perks up and speaks again.
“Cas,”
“It’s not like that, Dean. The Shadow’s only dream in life is to sleep. They exist to keep dead angels and demons safe, that was their only purpose.” Jack’s face is solemn. “When Chuck needed a new ‘big bad’, he wrote them into your story. You’ve complained about Chuck pulling our strings but you forget that means he was pulling everyone else’s too.”
It’s breaking Bobby’s heart to see his kid like this. He goes to wipe a tear from Dean’s face but the hunter shrugs his hand away and stands up to pace.
Dean woke in the morning to the smell of coffee. He sighed happily when he opened his eyes, finding himself still wrapped up in Castiel’s arms. He could lay here all day, but if there was coffee being brewed, it meant that someone else was already awake. It definitely wouldn’t be Jo, because she was nearly as grouchy as Cas in the mornings, and Dean suspected that Charlie would be having a rough morning after the shots she’d done the night before.
“So, will you be bringing Castiel to the Christmas party?” Ellen asked Dean, drawing his attention away from the others. His face must have showed some confusion, because Ellen added, “The Roadhouse Christmas party? You boys are coming, right?”
“So, Cas,” Dean began, “First date?” The three men glanced toward the bar to see Jo pouring Meg and Ruby each a shot of some dark liquid.
He stepped out and leaned on the doorframe, toothbrush in hand. “Hey, Cas. You, uh—you always keep extra toothbrushes handy?” His attempt at keeping casual was thinly veiled, but luckily Cas was still half asleep and didn’t notice.
“Cas, I’d, uh… like to take you out… on a date. I mean, if you’re not into it we don’t—”
likes you.”
at the mere idea of seeing Cas, as though they hadn’t seen each other almost every day for the last week. He rolled his eyes at himself as he pocketed the phone and headed into the garage to gather up his tools before heading over to Sam’s.
Dean narrowed his eyes, waiting for it. Surely Sam was setting him up for some wisecrack or one-liner, and Dean wasn’t going to indulge him.
“You know, you’ve got it all wrong, Cas,” Dean said as they rounded the duck pond. He appreciated that Castiel wouldn’t bother pretending not to know what he was talking about.
“Yeah, okay, I guess. Give me a minute.”
Baby was starting to look like herself again, as Dean danced his way around the side of the car to hang the hose up on its reel. The song trailed off while he found the special towel that he used to clear the water spots from Baby’s paint.
Dean held up his hand to stop him and flashed one of those half-smiles that always made Castiel melt. “Just open it.”
“I know I’m a little early,” Dean said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I couldn’t—I mean, I was ready early, so I figured I’d come hang out here. I hope that’s ok.”
He pulled his hand out of hers and glared at her. He felt like his skin was on fire. He couldn’t speak. He was vaguely aware of the buzzing of his phone, so he pulled it out just to have something to focus on other than the blinding rage that was creeping down his spine while he tried to compose himself.
He turned, following Dean’s eyes, and his heart dropped. Sure enough, their father was standing just behind the screen door, keys in hand.
And then she was gone. The dog was gone. Cas was gone. Everyone was gone.
At that moment, a whistle and a loud series of pops filled the air. Blue and white sparks exploded to life from the other side of the property, flying high and then showering down until they faded into the darkness again. The darkness was short-lived, though, because more fuses had been lit during that first display and the air around them filled with sparks and explosions. They ranged from colorful fountains to massive repeating bangs that revealed rings of color as they fell from the heavens.
Charlie had planned on prodding at Dean about his possible bisexuality, but she definitely was not expecting him to come out to her in the first two minutes of their lunch date. Once the news sunk in and her brain was kicked back online, she had run to Dean’s side, there for him as she promised she’d always be.
it? Why is it so
“Oh my God, his brother and Meg?” she laughed. “Wouldn’t that be fantastic? And he’s texting you from work? Dean, he
“Aww, you guys make me so happy,” she cooed. Castiel grinned. “Now go make sure he’s not still bleeding or eating all of the food. I’ll go check on Sam.”
“Charlie, this is Castiel. He’s here with Ruby’s sister Meg,” Sam gestured toward the bar where two women were giggling flirtatiously with the man Meg had been talking to earlier. The man seemed to be paying for another round of shots they were sharing, sliding a few bills to Jo as she poured.
“Mm. Well, I broke in and stole all your food just to make sure you’d come. I’m very thorough.”
“Boys, I don’t expect you to want anything to do with me right now. But when—
, this might be the last New Year’s Eve we spend together.”
So, instead, he drank. He drank to numb the pain, to dull the images of Cas being swallowed up and dragged away, to quiet the echoes that rattled in his skull all day and night.
“That’s great, Sam,” said Castiel with a kind smile, but Dean looked torn at the idea.
Dean raised a finger as he stepped closer. “Look. Whatever you think you saw here—you didn’t.”
—did you see him?” His face broke out in an astonished grin. “I’ve never seen him like that.”
“Look, this whole thing—dating guys, coming out,
He knew that Castiel would be at lunch at this time. They’d agreed to meet for lunch three times already this week, but tonight would be their first official date. They’d been getting to know one another a bit over their casual lunches in the hospital cafeteria (where Dean supplied homecooked leftovers, much to Castiel’s pleasure), however they could hardly be called dates. They hadn’t ventured past flirty banter, both anxiously awaiting their “real date” to explore romance. Dean’s stomach knotted at the thought.
“Oh, the pleasure is mine,” he told Ellen. “I’m very happy to know Dean has such a great family.” Her eyes filled with sentiment and she hugged Castiel once more before moving back to her chopping board.
—it took a moment to realize that Jess was now staring at him.
“—enough?”
“Bitch!” Dean shouted back. A neatly dressed man sitting alone on a bench beside the entrance chuckled at the exchange, and Dean grinned smugly, pleased with the fact that even a perfect stranger could see the amusement in his brother’s annoyance.
we haven’t been able to depend on him or to trust him for
“Aw, Cas. You can’t just claim a dude’s ass with that damn sex voice and then send him off to dinner with his family,” he complained. “There’s gotta be some kinda rule about that.”
He entered the lobby and climbed the stairs to the third floor, following the directions that Castiel had given to find Apartment 3C. But before he could reach Castiel’s front door, he was stopped short. Gabriel was leaning against the doorframe of Apartment 3B with his arms folded across his chest, one of his cameras in hand and wearing a mischievous smile.
Dean gathered the clothes that were still scattered around the room. He dropped Castiel’s clothes and the towel into the hamper and slipped into his own boxers and shirt. He stepped into the bathroom, closing the door halfway to relieve himself, then opening the cabinet while he washed his hands. Sure enough, there were several unopened toothbrushes lined up in a box off to one side. Looking at the stash, Dean wondered how many times Castiel had supplied toothbrushes after impromptu sleepovers. He tried to shake the thought from his head, deciding that he shouldn’t ask questions that he didn’t want the answers to, but it nagged in the back of his mind as he squeezed toothpaste onto a new green toothbrush.
He knew he had to return her. There was no other option. He was too aware of the pain that comes from knowing that something you love is out there. He knew the pain of wanting that something to be returned to you. He felt it all the time now, even in the moments when he thought he was coping.
They worked easily together in the kitchen. Dean supposed it might have something to do with the way they had always been able to move around one another in a fight, each having the other’s back while staying out of the way. Dean manned the stove while Cas dipped the tomatoes between the bowls of egg and flour, covered to his elbows in batter. When the first tomatoes were done, Cas craned his neck to get a look at them.
“Aw, c’mon, Cas. What about you? I mean, look at you…” Dean had to stop himself from adding
Castiel arched a brow curiously as Dean disappeared back into the bedroom for a moment and returned with his phone to snap a picture.
“Well,” Dean said with a grin and a quick kiss to the side of Castiel’s head as they crossed the threshold. “Welcome home, Cas.”
Dean grinned. “Memory foam. It’ll never forget you.”
He looked thoughtfully at the man, still hiding from the day in his cocoon of blankets.
, he admitted to himself after a deep breath, butterflies in his stomach at the thought.
Dean laughed. “That’s it, huh? You just want me for my memory foam.” Castiel made a face as though he were deep in thought. “Shut up, you like me,” Dean said with the most adorable crinkled eyes.
I don’t even know if this
As they pulled out of the parking lot, Sam braced himself for Dean's I-told-you-so lecture about Ruby.
Castiel’s face was stoic and his stare was strong and intense. Sam was impressed at the man’s solidarity and grateful to have him beside his brother.
“Oh, um,” he rubbed the back of his neck in a very Dean-like fashion. “Yeah, we’ll be there,” he answered.
“I should be asking you that,” Jo lilted, nodding toward the group at the booth. “What are you guys doing hanging out with those bitches?”
Dean covered his face in laughter then shook his head. “I think my empty fridge had something to do with it, too.”
Bobby got to his feet to stand beside Sam. “You’ve got no right to hold this whole family business bullshit over the heads of these boys—” Bobby added in a dangerously low tone.
As he finished the last and most important sigil in the center of the floor, he took a deep breath. His human lungs reminded him of the astounding effort the humans put forth just to
“What are we cooking today?” Cas asked, following right behind Dean and rolling up the sleeves of the blue flannel that had likely once been Sam’s.
Once Jo was free from the confines of the bar, the group of friends managed to snag the only extra-large corner booth in the place.
When Dean finally opened the door to the warehouse hours later, the streetlight cast a long strip of light across the floor. The warding sigils painted across the door gave him hope, and he followed the illuminated path through the dark.
Dean froze.
“You live in a garage?” Castiel asked as the Impala rounded the curve of the long driveway.
“Jerk!” Sam yelled back before swinging open the green wooden door and disappearing inside.
“Dude, chill. I’m just messing with you.” Ruby laughed, though Dean suspected that she hadn’t been joking at all. “I didn’t even know she was bringing a date,” she shrugged, “but that’s Meg. She likes ‘em rich and pretty. If they're rich enough, pretty is negotiable.”
—he didn’t care.
“Hey, take it easy there, champ,” she said. “What’s going on?”
Dean grimaced at the sudden emptiness as Castiel moved away to change position. He pulled Dean up to his knees, turning his away to face the headboard. However much he wished he could watch the heave of his chest and the flutter of his lashes, this would be more comfortable for him right now. There would be time for the rest. There would be more of this in the future, he was certain of it. He tore open the condom, slipping it on one handed, and generously slicked them both with lube.
Sam ran his hands through his hair, pushing it out of his face. “Um, actually, that’s what I was coming to tell you. Lauren and I are gonna take off. I, uh, I’ll meet up with you guys in the morning. Don’t wait up.”
Dean paused to consider, studying his father’s face. He seemed sincere and a little hopeful.
Apparently home cooked meals were a direct path to Castiel’s flirty side. Dean could feel the heat of a blush creeping over his face. “Back at ya, Cas,” he reciprocated, “I mean—you know what they say…”
“Well, what are your plans for lunch tomorrow?”
“I’m proud of you, Dean. I’m proud of all of you. You have the most amazing family right there inside that house,” he said, gesturing over his shoulder.
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel nodded, still looking a little unsure. “Uh, did you—,” he pointed over his shoulder, “did you want breakfast?”
“Oh, come on, you’re traumatizing him,” Anna scolded her father and brother before turning fully to Dean. “The doctor came in. They’re planning to move him into a room soon. He asked us to send you in.”
He paused at a stop sign, trying to decide what to do next. Maybe if he could get through to Sam, he could get the message to Dean. He dialed and Sam picked up on the second ring.
“You ungrateful—,” John lunged toward Bobby, but Dean and Castiel were too close. Castiel grabbed John around his ribcage, while Dean wrestled his swinging arms. Sam hurried over to help, but before he could reach the scuffle there was the sound of a punch landing and Dean stumbled backward with a bloody nose.
Dean sighed, recalling his brother’s reasons for wanting a new car in the first place.
Dean rocked his hips back, ready and imploring Castiel to move.
As soon as the door closed behind them, Dean crowded into Cas’s space. Their chests pressed together as they lingered close enough that Dean’s nose grazed along the side of Cas’s. He was close enough to feel the angel’s breath on his own lips, a magnetic aura, pulling them together. It was a pull that had always existed, but from this distance, was infinitely stronger. When they finally gave in to it, it was gentle and slow. Their lips just barely brushed together as their hands explored. Hips… sides… chest… neck.
“Yeah, you guys go make your rounds. We won’t be finished here for a while anyway,” Sam said with a genuine smile. “We’ll be right here.”
Sam smirked, turning to Castiel. “You’re gonna have to teach me whatever magic it is you do to make him do what you want.”
Once convinced that John would make Dean follow through on his promise to eat and shower before returning to the hospital, Gabriel and Meg bade the rest of the group goodbye. Sam and Jess were the next to leave, promising they’d return once Castiel was settled tomorrow. When Dean climbed into the passenger seat of John’s pickup, a heavy tension settled over him.
“He’s been holding back for a long time. It’s like he’s the old Dean again.”
“Yeah,” Charlie agreed. “Emergency meeting. Tonight, Dean’s place. 6-ish. I’ll bring Jo, too. Can you make sure he’s there? And don’t let him cancel on Cas today, because if he starts to freak, he’s gonna try. Tell him it’s a game night.”
Sam had tried, too. Dean had watched his brother’s heart get broken too many times. He’d been there to witness Sam’s hopes for happiness get crushed by death and darkness, and while Dean might put on a tough act, he knew it’d kill him to fall in love just to lose that person.
“Funny, scary, or… actiony?” Sam asked as he grabbed the remote and started flipping through menus.
“Yeah. Candles, oil, tequila, set off the fire alarms—it was a whole thing,” he said in a rush, as though this were not the important part of his story. After a small pause, realization formed across his face and he sat up to face his brother accusingly. “By the way, you would have
Dean managed a smile, his first smile since Castiel’s texts about pie which seemed like days ago now, though really it had only been a couple of hours. He reached forward to gently take Castiel’s hand, then leaned forward to kiss it lightly.
Cas simply laughed and handed it over willingly. “I assume this stays between us.”
tonight.” He held up the camera he’d been holding out of Dean’s sight and winked. “Not
Ellen ventured out from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a towel and addressing the room, “Dinner in five. Girls, would you mind setting the table?”
But it didn’t come. Sam turned his attention back to whatever website he was browsing, commenting vaguely on possible cases they could take on this week. Dean looked over to Cas who only looked back with a little twitch at the corner of his mouth.
Sam shook his head. This wasn’t about the truck. “No,” he said, maybe a bit more aggressively than he intended. “I—I want to get my own car. I just—I want something that’s
“So, you’re the guy in the sweet black Impala,” Gabriel said. Castiel watched as Dean visibly relaxed and gestured toward his brother.
Sam hesitated a moment before answering, “Jess.”
“I think we’re on our own for Sharknado 2.”
“Hiya, Dean! How’s Mr. Novak? Haven’t seen you boys for a while now.”
On the opposite side of the fire, Chuck sat chatting with Bobby and John while Anna and Ellen sipped cocoa beside them discussing Anna’s recent promotion. She looked excited about the news and Ellen seemed to be oddly enthusiastic about it as well. Castiel had initially been a little disappointed at the thought of his sister and father’s departure, but Dean was pleased to see the way he lit up with happiness when they extended their stay by a few days to be here with them tonight.
His ears were ringing. Buzzing.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said as he looked up from his coffee.
Sam raised his brows in question, looking between the two of them, though Dean thought he saw the subtle hint of a smirk. “Oh? What is it?”
“Is this—is it what I think it is?”
Castiel woke a few times during the night. As Dr. Hendricks promised, the hospital staff had rotated through every few hours and though they tried to be quiet, Castiel woke each time until the next dose of meds kicked in. Dean, however, had crashed almost immediately after the pair had indulged themselves in celebratory pie and had somehow slept through the entire night in the chair beside the bed, bent forward to rest his head on Castiel’s side. It was as close as they could get, considering Castiel was stuck in the narrow bed.
Claire had once mentioned that her mother was a detective and suddenly it seemed quite obvious. Castiel looked to Dean, hoping that he would step in to respond. While Dean had come out to his immediate family and close friends, there were still a lot of people in his life that didn’t know, and Castiel didn’t want to cross that line.
He immediately sent a message to Castiel who responded with an enthusiastic
He’d been in charge of closing the garage on Friday since Bobby had taken off early to help Ellen prepare for the Christmas party. Of course, just minutes before locking the door, a customer rolled in with an engine that whined and squealed. Normally Dean would have told the customer that they were closed for the weekend since he’d already sent everyone home, but the woman had a toddler in tow, and she seemed desperate. There was no way he could turn her away.
a blanket hog.
The moment that Sam said goodbye to Jess, he began to regret all of his decisions. He felt as though his life no longer had direction. The images he’d had of a happy future all hinged on graduating from Stanford Law, marrying Jess, and starting a family. Instead, Sam spent the last three years studying part time here in Kansas while helping out on his free days with the family business, restoring classic cars at John & Bobby’s garage.
Dean kept his eye on his cup as he sat in an empty chair. “So, you’re saying you’re cool with--,” he pointed a thumb over his shoulder toward his bedroom.
Dean secretly didn’t hate cooking with Cas.
“I’d say in about an hour, so, uh... you guys make sure to wrap things up before we get there, ‘kay?”
“So, what do you want?” Dean finally asked flatly. Sam glanced at his brother before sitting up straight and turning his attention back to his father.
going to sit here and pout and overthink.” Another kiss. “You’re going to have a fun night with your friends playing games, though I assume there’s more to game night than games, based on your fear of it.” Another kiss.
Every morning he went to Castiel’s apartment and every morning Castiel fought for a few extra minutes of sleep. Dean found it endearing, and didn’t mind when Castiel would get grumpy, moping around wrapped up in his blankets.
Without another word, John left.
Dean sighed with a soft smile. “I swear, Cas, for as long as I live, I will
Dean laughed, covering his face with his palm. Something about that dorky sense of humor just made his heart flutter.
He was stopped short by the arm of a police officer. “Sir, please, let the paramedics do their job.”
The pair made quick work of collecting the ingredients for burgers along with a few things for Dean to restock his empty refrigerator. Before heading to check out, Dean grabbed a case of beer and stood staring between a selection of fresh apple and cherry pies for several minutes before Castiel suggested he just buy one of each.
Castiel sat up, now staring into green eyes. His own eyes burned with threatening tears as emotions crashed down over him. This was it. This was the end of the process. He kept his eyes on Dean’s as he carefully stood, stretching what was left of his wings widely before they burst into brilliant white flames.
He gave Dean an appraising look, determined to make his first time as gentle and pleasurable as he could.
Dean stared, stunned silent. He couldn’t determine whether his brother was being awesomely cool about this or completely dense. He decided to let it simmer for tonight, hoping that it’d dawn on Sam sooner or later if it hadn’t quite sunk in already. He planned to talk to Charlie tomorrow and he had confidence that she would be his key to navigating this whole awkward experience.
“Dean... there’s been an accident.”
“Hey, uh, you been back yet?” Dean asked, fiddling with his fingers. He didn’t know what to do with himself here in the waiting room. He was already starting to feel like he’d been away from Castiel for too long now, and he wanted to be back in that hard chair beside the narrow bed.
“Does frying them make them taste different?” he asked, casting his sticky hands a glance.
Dean smirked at the screen as he awaited a response. He laughed out loud when he received a selfie of Castiel in black scrubs with a honeybee embroidered on the breast pocket. He was pouting at a forkful of pinkish-grey something.
“I won’t get in your way, Sammy,” John continued. “Go. Go live your life. You—you’ve always been so smart. I’m sorry I’ve held you back, boy. You’re your own man, now. When did that happen?” He laughed to himself sadly.
A group of paramedics just beyond the wrecked bike lifted a stretcher.
attractive,” Castiel finally said, eyes still squinted in her direction. “But the man she’s talking to has much more attractive qualities.”
Castiel averted his eyes as Meg walked into the cafeteria and past their table. Gabriel, of course, pointed this out, much to Castiel’s annoyance. “What’s that about, ladykiller?”
He returned on the fifth morning, this time not panicking when Castiel greeted him with a gravelly “Hello, Dean.”
At first, he thought it was Dean, and he fought to open his eyes, but his eyelids were heavy.
The road was smooth and empty, the sun was out, and the asphalt was dry. He’d been right when he’d thought that it would be a good day for a ride. As they cruised on, he felt Dean sitting closer, shifting from a nervous grip to a warm embrace. The cold bite of the air countered by the warm rush of adrenaline and the feeling of strong arms wrapped around him made Castiel wonder if this was what flying would feel like.
“Um. Thanks. For today, I mean. I, uh… I don’t know what I would have done…”  The words
“But Dean—”
Dean flushed. “Uh, yeah. Yeah. I mean—Sorry it didn’t work out with—” He let the sentence trail off, waving a dismissive hand.
Castiel let out a content sigh. “I think I love him.”
Dean felt the truck sway slightly when John glanced toward him. He looked like he could burst, though he contained it well, simply nodding, reaching across to pat Dean’s shoulder. “’Course, son. Knew I had to get you to him, that’s all.”
“I can’t wait to get my mouth on those,” he whispered, surprising even himself.
He smiled at the way Cas bundled his blankets around him, imagining that he’d probably be a blanket hog. Not that he imagined sharing a bed with Cas, but maybe someday Cas would share a bed with someone. Dean’s brows reflexively pinched together and his stomach turned at the thought. Shaking his head, he decided he’d just let Cas sleep in.
“C’mon, Cas…” Dean gave him his best guilty puppy eyes, a trick he’d learned from Sam. “I’m sorry.”
“Are you okay? You look a little… pale,” she said, concern written across her face.
Dean groaned, sitting up to collect the fallen bottles and line them up with the empties already on the table beside him. Miracle didn’t bother lifting her head as she watched.
“I could have told you that,” Castiel answered flatly.
Dean watched with bated breath as Castiel and Meg slipped their coats on and stepped outside to talk. He wondered how the conversation would go. Would Castiel ease into it and let her down easy? Would he just bluntly say it?
“Well I see you two are getting along pretty well. Maybe save that for the bedroom,” Dean said with a grin as he and Castiel perched on their barstools across the table from them.
“I’m so happy to meet you, Castiel. Dean and Jo have told me so much about you.” Castiel smiled as the woman wrapped him in a hug. He immediately understood that Ellen wasn’t just Jo’s mom or Dean’s Uncle Bobby’s girlfriend; he looked to her as a surrogate mother.
“Thanks,” Dean grunted as he sat on the stool and dug in. He didn’t care what he was eating but was he glad that he didn’t have to waste the time cooking it himself. The fact that his father remembered how Dean liked his sandwich was just a bonus.
Were it not for Bobby and Ellen, the boys would have probably disassociated themselves from John Winchester long ago, but the pair did their best to keep the family intact. When they were old enough, Bobby brought the boys in to work at his garage, a business that had once been John’s passion. But when the time came for Sam to head off to Stanford, John made an emotional plea for his son not to go, imploring him to stay and be a part of the family business. He'd promised that this time he'd make it right, he'd stick around, if only they could be there for one another. However, after Sam agreed, sacrificing his own plan for the start of his adult life, John fell back off the wagon, and was once again gone more often than not.
“First of all, you guys are adorable. And I don’t mean ‘aww, look at all the gay’-dorable, I mean like tooth-rotting sweet-sweet fanfiction adorable. I totally get it, though—the not being out thing is a big red flag most of the time. He’s a good guy for giving you a chance.”
“For guests,” he responded, voice muffled by the blanket.
Dean gave Sam a look and Sam nodded. Dean turned back to John, holding his head high.
Castiel had been his rock tonight, keeping him grounded and present through the whole ordeal with his father. His family and friends had accepted him whole-heartedly. Then he’d been so gentle and so soft… Dean had to remind himself that it was too soon to think that he could fall in love with this man. He was just basking in the glow of good—no—
family. We can finally be happy together.”
Thirty minutes later, he returned with a large bag of muffins and a box of pastries. Charlie was awake again, now seated at the kitchen island with a bottle of water while Sam was disposing of the bottles in the sink. “’Morning, Officer Bradbury,” Dean greeted Charlie with an amused grin.
Dean tilted his head to one side with a half-smile, looking up through his lashes at Castiel. “Keep kissing my neck like that and I’m gonna have to cancel for a whole other reason,” he whispered gruffly. Castiel grinned and placed one more kiss.
Above him, a handsome doctor’s mouth was moving and Castiel realized the doctor must have been talking to him. It took a vast amount of effort to focus on what the man was saying.
“Promise?”
Sam lounged on the leather armchair while Dean sat in his favorite corner of the couch. Castiel settled on a pillow on the floor between Dean’s legs, and Jo took up the opposite end of the couch. Charlie started the game and passed out controllers.
By the end of the week, Castiel’s wounds were healing well, and except for the occasional dizzy spell, the lasting effects of his concussion were minimal. On the morning that he was set to be released, Dean had watched with rapt attention when the nurse gave him a lesson on the proper way to change a bandage. Castiel tried to hide his grin as he watched Dean practice, tongue pinched between his teeth as he carefully wrapped gauze around his arm, tight, but not too tight.
“Oh—I, uh—sorry."
,” he breathed.
“He’s good,” Dean said, pointing a thumb over his shoulder. “Asleep right now. Everything okay with you?” His brows pinched together as he tried to see through his brother’s skull to figure out what was really on his mind.
The man had Gabriel’s boyish looks but Castiel’s disheveled hair and blue eyes. Combined with his scruffy graying beard, he had all the intimidation of an old cocker spaniel. Dean felt like an idiot for being so nervous to meet this man, but then again, he hadn’t exactly had the best relationship with his own father and hadn’t really bothered to meet the families of most of the women he’d dated. None of those relationships had ever been serious enough for that—even with Lisa. But with Cas, it was different.
“Well, I’m glad to see you’re getting out there again after Lisa. I’ll let it slide this time, but next week I’m putting you to work in the kitchen.”
He needed to think, but he just couldn’t. His mind was somehow spinning out of control and completely blank all at once. His body ached with tension. He slouched onto the plush leather couch that he loved, pulling a blanket over his face. He could feel his phone vibrating in his pocket, surely Sam calling to check on him, but he ignored it. He just needed to
“Lisa stopped us when we came in. She… didn’t seem very happy. Dean went to talk with her.”
“Handmaiden?” Castiel asked with a teasing smirk, turning to lock eyes with Dean whose ears had quickly turned a brilliant shade of red.
“Dean, I’m sorry.” He looked up to meet her apologetic gaze. “I guess I just didn’t want it to be true. I thought—I just wasn’t what you wanted. I was just being selfish. Maybe I need to lay off the eggnog.” She gave him a weak smile which Dean returned. She stood to leave the store room but paused before she opened the door. “I can only hope I’m as lucky as you someday. Maybe I’ll find
“I think that TV is older than you are, buddy,” Dean said, finally sliding back on the bed to lean against the headboard beside Cas. “Wish I knew what they were saying,” he said mostly to himself.
“Mornin’, sunshine,” Dean greeted with a smirk.
He pocketed the chip and started the engine, guiding his truck out of the parking lot. Traffic slowed to a crawl, while the working citizens of Lawrence made their way home, but today was even slower going than usual. He supposed that maybe with Christmas being just a few days away, people were travelling to visit family and friends. At that thought, he pulled the chip back out and gave it another squeeze.
“I know, I know. C’mon, let’s get in there,” Dean said, ushering the group toward the front door.
Dean didn’t really have anywhere else to go, but he knew he didn’t feel like sitting in silence in this busy bar anymore, and he wasn’t ready to go back to the motel yet—it was promising to be a long and awkward night without Sam as a buffer. When they reached the parking lot, instead of heading to the Impala, Dean led Castiel toward the sidewalk. The angel still looked curious but didn’t comment as they walked along the dark street and into a well-manicured park down the block.
Meg and Ruby finally returned to the table, each carrying a fruity cocktail. Instead of sitting, Ruby stood at the end of the bench, frowning at the sight of Sam with his arm still draped over Charlie’s shoulders. She allowed Ruby to reclaim her position at Sam’s side while she pulled up a chair at the end of the table, ignoring Ruby’s contempt. She was too absorbed in the way Dean was watching Castiel at the moment to address it, because Meg had now pushed herself onto the opposite bench, crowding Castiel into Dean's space. For the three to fit, Dean raised and rested his arm on the back of the bench behind Castiel’s shoulders. Meg had placed herself practically in Castiel’s lap, ignoring the look of discomfort that instantly crossed his face.
