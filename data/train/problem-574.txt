"Sherlock."
Then John said, "See? Drool doesn't matter, you look adorable when you sleep."
"We need to get up."
"Yes?"
Sherlock was already dialling Lestrade as he ran out the front door of Baker Street.
"That won't be a problem."
John sayss, "I;ll let Lakitu know, he should hace them sent to the winner's circle at Peach's castile."
2) Sherlock's panic attack is based on my personal experience with having them, so I really tried writing it in a way that people who don't experience them might know what it feels like and what symptoms I feel would manifest for him specifically.
"But we kind of did. Our address is online, which is fine for regular clients, but sometimes we get the occasional revenge visit."
Sherlock said, "You set an alarm on your mobile before getting in bed, but most telling is that it's not even ten yet."
Sherlock held him back and placed one hand on the back of his neck. "Yes I'm fine. Everything is okay."
Sherlock went into his mind palace and ran through a multitude of scenarios. Scenarios ranging from the worst possible case to the best. A couple things crystallized as the best course of action.
"I don't know! I lost it!" He yelled.
"We need to talk."
~~~~~
"Thank you," he sighed in relief. "If there's anything else I can do, I want to help. I need to for them. For Laney."
The two startled and sprang apart, as if the phone were a person pulling them. Sherlock walked around the table and mussed his curls in frustration. How could he forget himself in the moment? Let himself come so close to revealing what he's successfully kept buried for years?
"Of course."
Mrs. Hudson was done waiting for a response. "You two drive me mad, and not with the messy flat." She kept muttering to herself as she walked up the stairs. "Men, hopeless, the whole lot of them."
The killer's fists clenched, but he tried to remain otherwise unaffected.
"Well stop thinking and let yourself rest. You'll think better once you've had some sleep." John placed his phone on the side table and plugged it into the charger.
At the second floor window, Sherlock pulled out his lock picking set. At John's confused look, he explained. "Old window. The lock can be reached from outside, if one has a long and thin tool."
The fact that Sherlock had done this for him, for Mrs. Hudson, and even Lestrade, without sparing a thought toward his own safety, was absolutely heartbreaking. He cared so much for the people in his life, and in the end John had repaid him for it with several punches. True, he hadn't known yet. But he did know Sherlock, and he should have assumed from the very moment he saw him in The Landmark that there was a reason for all of this. Never cruelty.
"Since you came back. You've gone soft."
The song began and the two followed the arrowed beat.s Sherlock was beteer obviously but John tried his best. They kept going, John being seduced more and more by Sherlock and and Sherlock seduced more and more by John's charming inability to dance.
“That’s a surprise.”
John followed him to Sherlock's room and watch him gently lay the baby on his bed. "Get her into pyjamas while I make the cot."
Sherlock sighed but did get out of bed. He stood up and stretched while peering at John.
He looked at Sherlock, but Sherlock's face was an unreadable mask besides the slight downturn of his mouth. He didn't know what to do and distractedly noticed his hand was grasping the elbow of Sherlock's coat.
Sherlock listened to him, and wondered if John really hadn't noticed that he placed a comforting hand on Sherlock's arm. That hand was everything to Sherlock, but he had other things to focus on right now. "I know, it's just tedious. We'll have to go to them instead."
\((Its’ time tmo say a hAil Mary)) OHMYF od not that mary))
Sherlock scowled at the reminder of Eleanor's imminent departure. What did that matter? He still needed to do his best, especially after all he
Sherlock left the room and went into his bedroom and stripped out of all of his clothes. He then put on the second pair, the bees one. He came out of the room and walked to the kitchen.
Sherlock looked from the gift to John, then back to the gift again. He reached for it slowly, almost as if he expected it to disappear or be taken away. Once in his hands, Sherlock began to peel away the blue wrapping paper (a small part of him noting how it matched John’s eyes).
THE END>
He shook his head in amusement and mouthed the word "later" at Sherlock, before going back to his task of making tea for the evening. He also noticed that the bottle warmer was set up again near the toaster. How in the world were they to deal with this?
The laptop was handed off to the cyber team, but Sherlock didn't have much confidence in that. The password was random characters, and depending on how long it was, it could take months or years to crack. He had higher chances just talking to Brown directly.
"Bit not good, I know. Any information could do anything, without a motive we have nothing to decide on."
Sherlock huffed. "No." Yes.
"He and his boyfriend gave me a little visit before your department searched Logan's flat."
"Today, with Eleanor, you just seemed so..."
Sherlock thought for a minute and came up with a solution. "Come."
"How did you get here faster than us?"
"Shhh, no reason to fret. I'll be feeding you as soon as google tells me how to make formula."
One episode of a show turned into two, turned into three. And lulled by the noise, alcohol, and mental exhaustion, Sherlock felt John's head fall to his shoulder. He was loathe to move them or end their contact, so instead he slowly laid down and pulled John with him. They lay side by side now, with Sherlock's back pressed against the back of the couch and John plastered against his front. He'd wait until the morning to worry about their positioning and what it implied. For now, he would feel loved.
"He doesn't have a password John. What kind of moronic murderer doesn't keep a password on their computer?" He looked seriously disturbed by this.
John gawped when he saw him. Sherlock looked more amazing than he thought he would. Sherlock was clad only in the panties. His skin was normally pale, but now held a blush from his cheeks down his collarbones and to his chest. He wasn’t posing, but rather seemed to stand still with hands wringing in anxiety. Or insecurity, John wasn’t sure which though they’re synonyms.
"What matters is that he's caught.
John groasned and latched ihs mouth on Sherlock’ s collarbone while one hand raached down and pulled the pants down. Sherlock lifted his bum and then feet off the bed so John could pull them all the way off. JOhn thew the bee pants away and cupped Sherlock’s now bare ass with his hands.
When they pulled away they looke at each ohter in awe, wonderng if the other felt the sparks, though they could tell once they obsered the stars in the others' eyse.
John said, "How should we go about this then?"
"This will take no more than a minute."
should get it by the time I'm done with this guy."
John beamed at him, "Oh so you
Without looking away, Sherlock asked, “What is that?”
Sherlock's musing was interrupted by a furrowed brow forming on John's face. His face grew pinched in confusion as his eyes moved under his lids. Sherlock felt the urge to smooth a finger across the little wrinkle but refrained from doing so. Instead, he turned onto his other side and scooched backwards until John's chest was almost pressed against his back.
Once he was out of earshot, John asked, "How did you know, actually?"
stare at the exposed thigh muscles. On top of that, the boxer brief style only confirmed what Sherlock deduced about John's size based on his gait.
"Are you serious?"
They stopped talking once they reached the ladder. It was important not to alert the landlord of their presence.
"Yes, actually," he said while putting wrapping his hands around the handle of his umbrella. "I came by to make sure this whole thing isn't just charity or some twisted form of penance you've brought on yourself."
Once she was gone, John moved in front of Sherlock and placed one hand over a clenched fist and the other against the side of Sherlock's stony face.
John stood taller at Sherlock's praise. To be trusted so fully by this man, when he thinks of himself as useless and merely a backboard for Sherlock's deductions during cases. Sherlock felt he was capable, more so then trained officers who hadn't gone through career ending injuries.
SHerlock tired quickly tucnking himsefl away when he simultaneouesly took a step away from the tub and over his trousers, falling starhg t intot he shower wall.
Sherlock scrolled through and sure enough, they were. He grinned, tugged John up from the chair, and begun spinning him around by the shoulders. "John, you are magnificent. I knew you were smarter than most! All we have to do is go down there with a warrant and get a list of names and cross reference them with our files."
"He?"
The bitch being sexI better be blackout drunk right nown
They would see to having Mycroft's people remove all of Eleanor's things soon. Preferably tomorrow so they could sleep in the same bed again.
"Exactly!"
"Who?"
"I'll get the bottle ready if you fetch her?"
John signed off on the remaining paperwork and the two left the building.
Sherlock went through the write ups, looking for anything to stand out. This quickly proved fruitless and John suggested they start by sorting everything. Sherlock agreed, knowing it would make it easier to find patterns. The deaths were sorted by drug used, body found inside or outside, and whether they were an addict or recovered addict at the time of death. It took until the sunrise ended, but they eventually had a full index. With only two victims to profile, the scope of other overdoses was too broad to search through. At this point, any one of them could be a murder victim.
John smirked and resumed eating himself.
Brown's eyes widened at the picture, and still, he denied it. "It was just me."
Sherlock's mouth formed a silent 'oh' and he sat back in his chair. "You want to know about my past. More than what I've told you."
They both knew they'd be unable to rest, but it was the principle of the thing that mattered.
~~~~~
((No joke this was like 3 months after writing this fic, while in that very inebriated state I gasped and had an epiphany that I could write my first sex scene ever.)) BUT WAIT THERES MORE , hello this is me again , Iaccidentally drank on an empty stuomach and it feels like a very different kind of drunk. Point is imma write this bitch.
The baby was down for her nap, so Sherlock and John were able to open everything and organize unimpeded. They didn't talk much during the work, but at one point John held up a yellow striped onesie with a cartoon bee in the front. Sherlock feigned nonchalance and John raised an eyebrow. Sherlock got up and moved the now constructed cot to the bedroom so John couldn't see the blush now staining his cheeks.
Sherlock cleared his throat and said, "Thank you. For last night." Forcefully nonchalant.
John froze, and his lack of response must have been noticeable because Sherlock stared at him.
~~~~~
He made a dissenting noise, "Best not to come to conclusions without the evidence."
The tube ride and subsequent walk home were uneventful and John liked the small bit of exercise.
"Right," John frowned but kept going. "He targeted victims through a patient list at his job as a counsellor, and his reason for doing so is stupid."
John cleared his throat. "
Sherlock stayed still for a moment. Unknown to the others, he was utilizing the frustration room in his mind palace to scream about what an idiot this man was. He took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly. The man had basically admitted to the contents of the file and never flat out denied guilt. He got the response he needed for the most part, so his work was done. He turned to the mirror and said, "That should be enough." Sherlock exited the room quickly with John trailing behind.
Lestrade was obviously caught off guard, though he should have guessed Sherlock dragged John to a breaking and entering sooner. "This is irrelevant to your confession. What I need to know is your motivation."
John pictured a happy kid Sherlock, running around and crawling through the dirt with a bucket to put worms in.
John knew he was right when Sherlock's eyes widened and he leapt over the coffee table onto the floor. "See, this is why I need you." He said as he pulled out his phone and began texting.
Sherlock retched a couple more times before wiping his mouth with toilet paper and flushing the contents. Exhausted, he leaned against the bathtub. He kept his eyes closed to avoid whatever expression was on John's face.
Sherlock sat up and bent down to transfer the baby back to Emmett's arms, careful to support her head during the movement, then joined John in the other room. Sherlock pulled his phone from his pocket and read the text from Lestrade (he felt the vibration earlier, but hadn't wanted to disturb the baby).
side, pulling the covers on the other side back to leave an open invitation for John. John smiled and slipped into bed beside him. It was easy really.
"Hmm? Oh, I'm good." John wasn't thinking about himself right now.
After a couple weeks, John moved from his depressing bedsit back into 221b.
John placed a comforting hand on Sherlock's shoulder and squeezed. "What now?"
Sherlock and John started walking down the street, waiting for the click of the door shutting. As soon as it was heard, Sherlock dropped his hand from John's back. He didn't want to make him uncomfortable. Unbeknownst to him, John already missed the contact.
"Mycroft?" John sounded skeptical.
Now it was Sherlock's turn to grimace. "I don't need to and won't explain myself to you. Just put in the order and leave."
John swatted at Sherlock who smoothly stepped out of range. "Arse."
Unseen to John, Sherlock smirked. "Horridly, I can't seem to ever get away." He'd had enough time to reign in his emotions and react to John like his proper self again, rather than some sentiment ridden fool.
In a high pitched lil bitch baby fboice Lakitu sayid, "Everyone crossed thie finish line exceot PEach. PLease help ius find her kiler so he cn bte disqualified form the race."
He put his computer away and went to the kitchen where the man himself was measuring out an unknown substance with a micropipette.
The DI crossed his hands over the top of the case's file folder and leaned back in his chair, shoulders purposefully relaxed. "You've denied the presence of an attorney and affirmed that you know your rights. Please state your name to proceed."
The flatmates ate in comfortable silence, broken only by the babbles of the baby sat in Sherlock's lap.
The song Sherlock plays actually exists and is wonderful! My description pales in comparison to the real thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPiCqKXkww
He spoke around a forced yawn, "Mmm, yes. I'm a bit tired still from last night."
One day, after coming back to Baker Street from the surgery, John placed a wrapped box in front of Sherlock next to his microscope.
The small group made their way to interrogation room B where Donovan was already set up at a table with a clipboard for writing down the killer's confession. She eyed the baby skeptically and said, "If she cries, you're out."
What it says on the tin.
Sherlock's pulse sky-rocketed for reasons completely unrelated to the case. John was staring at him, at his
Sherlock's sardonic response remained internal as John saw his mouth open and elbowed him. John spoke instead, "It hasn't been long, don't worry."
When Sherlock went to his mind palace, John took the trash out and settled himself in his chair with his laptop. He had no desire to type up a draft for the case, however, he thought maybe he could write a post about attitudes toward people with substance abuse disorders. He didn't want to give this killer any direct attention, as it's one of the things he wanted. Instead, he'd use the anger to fuel the spread of information and hopefully inform people about what those disorders are like and what recovery looks like. Anything to help get rid of the general public's myths about such things.
Sherlock nodded to himself. "That's not what I asked."
I'm sorry this is late guys, I had a lot of shit to get done for my university and was also experiencing a severe depressive episode. I wanted this chapter to be longer, but I also wanted to get something out. Anyway, hope you enjoy!
He felt mildly better once everything was complete and the baby was happily snuggling into the crook of his arm. But he had research to do.
"Oh shit you right. Well, it wasn't our idea so."
~~~~~
Babyproofing is hard. Mycroftproofing is harder.
In bed, John waited until the lamp was turned off to speak.
The landlady tsked at Sherlock, but complied, handing the baby back to its father and closing the door behind her as she left. The man took great care in stepping around the coffee table and sitting himself in the wooden chair, cautious of the sleeping baby.
Growing up in a ho-
They left the arcade hand in hand, never to be aprat again.
Pants number two were a panty style (he would blame Irene’s tmi stories for that knowledge) that were predominantly white with yellow ruffled trim. Different tiny bees were scattered around the fabric, making it an apiarist’s wet dream (also Sherlock’s who was he kidding).
The two boys arrived and JHohn went to get ride tickeys for them.
A whimper woke John later, five hours according to his phone, and he quietly but swiftly made his way out of bed so as not to disturb Sherlock. He tiptoed to the dresser and kneeled down, making soft cooing noises so Eleanor would know someone was there. He picked her up and cradled her in one hand so the other could grab the nappy bag on his way out of the room.
~~~~~
John sighed and sat forward in his chair and placed one hand on Sherlock's knee. "I'm just worried that you'll leave again or go galivanting off during a case and get yourself killed for real. It's not your fault, at least not completely. I should take your word for it that you won't do it again, but I know how that brain of yours works and sometimes you do things and think later. This is just an aspect of our trust that I have to regain."
~~~~~
John grabbed their coats from the hanger by the door and rushed out to meet him and caught the tail end of the call.
Sherlock bobbed his head, deliberating. "Probably not."
John bit his lip, "You sure?"
John went to the bathroom while rolling up his sleeves. There he turned the water on and plugged the drain. He thought about adding Sherlock's favorite bubble bath but decided against it because he wasn't sure if the smell would overload his senses right now. Better to be safe. He watched it fill for a minute then went back to where Sherlock was.
This time he keyed u[ the song I bet YOU Loook Good On The Dance Floor by ARctive Moknekts , and before he hit play, he inserted coins into the second player slot.
Sherlock travelled to his leather chair and held Eleanor at an angle, along with the bottle at the perfect angle he memorized from that first time John instructed him. She quickly latched onto the teat and began sucking.
"Hungry?" He called from the kitchen.
Emmett picked Eleanor up from the floor and bounced her a bit on his hip. "It's all good, your landlady made scones to hold me over. She's very nice."
. "Because I'm Sherlock Holmes."
"Sherlock, she's to go into foster-"
At that, John closed his book silently and placed it on the side table. He made eye contact with Sherlock and looked sheepish at being accurately called out.
"Sherlock." John chastised.
"How did you know I slept with you?" The connotation of those words brought a flash of embarrassment to him.
"Not with
"Probably." No. "Why?"
The boys have a talk.
Mycroft grimaced. "Are you sure Dr. Watson wants to take care of two babies?"
And it was that same cover of darkness that led Sherlock to open his mouth instead of falling asleep like every cell of his body begged him to do instead.
"Their brain needs to develop more, it's just how it is." He found his quite amusing.
"Thank you."
He purposey kept himsefl from looking at Sherlock the rest of the night, so he missed Sherlock starign after him in awe and fondeness.
Sherlock picked up the little girl and talked to her as he settled her into the carrier. Since she hit four months, she's enjoyed Sherlock talking to her greatly. She always responds with her own jibberish language, and Sherlock acts as if he knows exactly what she's talking about.
Sherlock's eyes shot open in panic. John couldn't leave him now, the thought alone was terrifying. He reached a delicate balance of peace with guilt bubbling just under the surface, and if John left it would destroy the surface tension and plunge him back down.
"Connor, right?"
The phone wasn't on speaker mode so John was unable to hear, presumably Lestrade, respond.
Then froze and turned slowly around.
"Not if i withold sex unless you tell me I'm funny."
~~~~~
"Stop playing stupid. We have more than enough evidence to have you arrested right now. You'll have a lighter sentence if you just confess."
John froze and then closed his laptop and placed it on the side table, giving his full attention to Sherlock. "I forgave you, you know that."
John was glad to feel the cool sheets against his skin and slid into a deep sleep.
“For god sakes John” Sherlock stomped off.
‘Thank you father’
“Plans for tonight?” SH
When Sherlock didn’t answer he said; ‘I know Sherlock, I knew all along, but when you came back from the dead I hardly could leave Mary for you could I? I’m not that kind of man. I just asked her to marry me, besides, I loved her too’
‘Where is he?’ I asked walking in while throwing my coat on the couch.
‘Hello Sherlock’, Mycroft said without turning away from the window. ‘Is that your doing?’, he said pointing outside at Sebastian and his friends who had taken the fight out into the yard.
‘Did you have a good visit with your mother?’ Sherlock asked.
‘Molly, wait here, I’ll handle it’ I said ‘I know it’s hard’
“I have champagne and chocolate” John breathed.
‘I feel that too’ John nodded ‘I sometimes feel guilty if I’m happy with you’
The next morning Sherlock woke up before it was even light outside. He had thought he heard a noise. He was lying still in his bed and listened, there it was again, a muffled sound. He got out of bed and put on his dressing gown. He walked out of his room and heard the sound coming from John’s room.
‘Ta, you’re reading my mind!’
‘That’s no deduction!’ the boy shrieked.
‘He is but nobody really knows what he wants after college’, Mrs Holmes said shaking her head.
“Sherlock” John’s voice came.
‘I just talked to Mrs H on the phone. She is delighted to meet you, her words. So, if you want, we can take the train and look at the flat today, and be in London for New Year’s if you like’
‘Your dad is what?’ John said walking in putting on his jacket.
‘But he promised, in the plane he promised’
“What was that?” John came from outside the store.
Sherlock wished him good night and quietly left the room.
‘Really?’
He heard Mrs. H. chatting with Rosie and he quickly put some pants and a shirt on and gestured Sherlock to get up as well.
“Well John Watson, you will see that there is more to me then you can imagine” Sherlock snapped his fingers and a violinist came to the table and began playing a romantic song.
‘You’ve been away for days on end, not letting anyone know where you are only to show up finally I might add looking like this?’
John and Sherlock go for a long walk the day after Christmas and have a long conversation about the flat in London, and love. Speaking of love....
‘Molly, don’t bother, really, I know’
‘Where is Mrs Hudson?’ he started to look around ‘Mrs Hudson?’ he yelled.
‘Oh, you know very well what I mean and don’t do that!’ John pointed at Sherlock nervously ruffling his hair ‘when you do that, you very well know’ John put his hand back in his jacket and wanted to walk away but reconsidered ‘Why, Sherlock, do you want someone to live with you? No, why do you want me to live with you in London? Is it because you want me to live there because you like my company or is it just to share the rent? I want an honest answer please’
‘Well Holmes’ Sebastian leaned against his door ‘you’re finally off for a holiday then?’ he grinned sarcastically.
‘Excuse me?’
‘I will make myself some tea and you just go back to sleep John, I will be fine’
‘Hey’ I said putting my hand over his hand ‘that one seems to be broken’
‘Oh…’ It clicked finally. Mycroft didn’t only want to give Sherlock a case he also wanted to stir things up a bit ‘you’re evil’ he grinned.
Sherlock’s eyes were now completely full of tears so that he could not see John’s blue eyes anymore who looked at him full of warmth.
“I’ve told Angelo we would dine there, I hope that’s alright” Sherlock said timid.
Sherlock ruffled his hair nervously, there it was, the moment where he would have to tell the truth and where John would walk away.
But they both knew that it would take a lot of healing for both of them to get rid of this scary experience. Nonetheless they also wanted to move on and leave this behind them and to do that they had to talk about it together and be more open about their relationship. Hiding it would do no one any good they thought.
John turned around ‘But not taking any chance at all, won’t that leave you empty Sherlock? Won’t that leave you like an empty shell living without love?’
‘Happy New Year John’
‘As an escape for what?’
‘Maybe that’s just a good thing, John. She’ll never know better. She will always have you and she will always have me, but not together in one home. You get to see her as much as you like, you know that. I don’t want to keep her from you. She’s just as much yours as she is mine’
‘Sherlock… I want to apologise. I feel I’ve done you wrong’
‘Ah, well, I will continue my search for one then’ Sherlock said with disappointment.
“Hello Rosie” John heard Sherlock say “How are you? Look I’ve bought you something. It’s for Valentine’s Day but dada and I don’t do Valentine’s Day but for you we make an exception” Sherlock took an elephant out of his robe pocket. It was purple with a big heart on its side.
Sherlock is going to stay with his parents in the country for Christmas holiday for a few weeks and he is running into (litterally) a stranger.
He held Sherlock’s head in his hands and tenderly kissed his lips, slowly. Sherlock kissed back, eagerly.
‘Poor thing’ Harry’s voice came.
“John go, run!” Sherlock whispered but John wouldn’t leave Sherlock alone.
‘God, yes I do’ Mycroft smiled at Sherlock ‘But that doesn’t mean that it isn't nice to be with family’
Sherlock walked back to John and when he was close to John, John pulled him even closer; ‘That’ he said ‘was the most beautiful letter I’ve ever read’
‘Sherlock?’
‘I am here John’ a soft voice came from Sherlock’s chair.
Sherlock shrugged ‘She thinks that you look like a sad puppy whenever she’s asking about Mary’
‘Oh you do know it’s Sherlock we’re talking about don’t you, John?’
The first guests started to arrive around three o’clock in the afternoon. His parents were greeting everyone, and Mycroft still had his Cheshire Cat smile prepared. Sherlock could not remember the cottage ever being this filled with guests. He looked out to see if the Watsons with their son would arrive, which they did half an hour later.
Mycroft smiled and walked out of the door. At the door he looked over his shoulder one more time and nodded, it would be alright, or so he hoped.
‘You never have’, Sherlock yawned stretching his arms above his head.
“Well brother dear, I must go, next time I will beat you”
‘God help me, I do’ John said.
Sherlock was lying on the sofa in his thinking pose. John knew very well not to disturb him when he was like this but Sherlock was lying like this most of the time these days. He needed to get out more.
John and Mary were just being seated at the restaurant when John looked at his phone again.
‘There are pictures on there of you with her’
‘Sorry’
“You can come in now” she said to someone outside the room.
‘Thanks for finally telling me dad’ she said kissing her dad ‘can I go to my room now?’
“No, having lunch”
Sherlock smiled ‘Well that can only mean that you are feeling better’
‘I told you she was a drunk! How could she embarrass our mother like that!
‘You know, the usual in quiet times like these, bored out of his skull’
Sherlock was pondering and so much in his own thoughts that he didn’t see someone was running in the lane next to him. It was getting darker and the runner hadn’t seen Sherlock either and when he went around the bend of the road he bumped into Sherlock who fell into the snow.
“Shut up” Sherlock gasped. “Would you rather have champagne or sex?”
They drank their last beer and put their coats on to go home.
‘That’s my girl’ John said with a lump in his throat.
He shook it off, he was surely mistaken. Sherlock was Sherlock, the man without the emotions. Of course John knew him longer to know that wasn’t true of course.
When he walked into the bedroom he saw Sherlock standing in front of the bedroom window staring outside to the falling snow.
Mycroft ignored him; ‘It is your last year here and I am not requesting this, Sherlock. I am coming to pick you up myself with the car, am I making myself clear?’
‘Too bright’, he mumbled.
‘I’m not going anywhere and neither is you brother. How on earth dare you to do this to us again? What gives you the right to let us search the whole city for you once more!?’
‘You know…’ John said with a smile ‘Now that Rosie is with my mum, we have all the time in the world and we can do whatever we want, all day, for a week!’
Sherlock smirked, he liked it when his mother got like this, with other people of course, not with him, plus the prospect of having John around for a bit longer made him happier than he would have thought possible.
‘Sherlock?’ John said but then he realised that Sherlock’s breathing had become more slowly and regular. Sherlock was sleeping. John chuckled, there he was having other plans with Sherlock’s body and he was now lying against him sleeping.
‘I know it’s been a year now’ Sherlock said ‘but sometimes I can’t help but feel that my luck wouldn’t have happened if she hadn’t died’
‘For god sakes Sherlock’ John shouted.
Sherlock looked behind him where Harriet stood with bloodshot eyes. She clearly had been drinking heavily.
‘You? Moving in with someone?’ John asked.
‘Sherlock?’ he wanted to get up again but Sherlock’s hand gestured him to be still.
“I love it John, thank you”
This took Sherlock by surprise and when he looked up to look at John, John said; ‘Come on, you’re not that hard to read, at least not to us’
When he was almost at the door he heard a noise behind him. He turned to look and saw Sherlock had his hands before his face. Sherlock’s shoulders shook. Was he sobbing?
‘Yeah okay’ John nodded.
‘Sorry’ Sherlock said ‘I’m used to be in the defence mode I guess, but honestly, I am used to being alone. My parents have their own life, always had, Mycroft is older and was living on his own when I was just a teenager, so I was alone quite a lot you know’
Sherlock just sat there his eyes fixated on John ‘why you are asking me that?’ he said with an ice cold tone in his voice.
Silence…
‘Bloody hell’ John whispered to himself ‘Bloody fucking hell’
‘I just brought you to school’ John said.
‘It’s alright, she clearly had too much to drink’ Mrs Holmes said ‘you just take her home. John can stay here as long as he likes’
‘See what I mean?’ Molly sobbed ‘He’s like this all day, every day’
John walked over to Sherlock and stood before him. He was slightly shorter than Sherlock was and had to look up a bit ‘Sherlock’ John said taking Sherlock’s head in his cold hands ‘I am falling for you’
“Sorry, but I wanted to ask you if you could babysit Rosie tonight”
‘I know shall we put a band aid on that?’
As Sherlock fell asleep, Mycroft whispered to John ‘I’ll stay here John, you go on home’
‘But what if…’ John tried but he was talking to a closed door.
He closed the door behind him and walked to the bed. John was dreaming it seemed. He had himself entangled with the sheets and was tossing and turning. Sherlock tried to feel his head, he didn’t think John had a fever but couldn’t be sure. ‘John, wake up, you are dreaming’ he shook John.
‘My parents?’
‘Happy birthday Sherlock, I love you’
Sherlock slowly sat up and looked at John ‘What gives me the right? What gives me the right?’ he hissed through his teeth ‘you gave me the right when you left me. You all did! You all have forsaken me!’ he shouted again and looked around bewildered.
Sherlock hadn’t moved an inch at all. He didn’t say anything so John got up and went to the bathroom where he brushed his teeth feeling rather sorry for himself.
‘You were screaming in your sleep again Sherlock’ John said. He sat on the edge of the bed. ‘Do you want me to make you some tea?’
‘Sherlock?’
‘I do. You know you are loved by many, not only by John and me do you?’
He looked at his hand ‘I’m bleeding’
“Better do it now, Dr Watson” a calm voice came from the doorway.
John could hear Sherlock’s teeth grinding.
They were quiet for the most part of the drive, which took almost two hours. Sherlock was looking outside where the first snowflakes were coming down. He sighed.
Mary blew a kiss to the screen and the screen went black.
‘You really should get out of those wet clothes, you’ll catch a cold. Sorry, bad habit, I’m a doctor, well, almost, erm I’m almost a doctor I mean, I graduate next year’
John handed Sherlock his package and Sherlock opened it to see a first edition of a Nikola Tesla book and was thrilled.
‘Feeling’ Sherlock mumbled drowsily.
When he walked out of the room to get Rosie he could hear John laughing and it warmed his heart. He finally had all he had ever wanted and more.
‘It must have been so difficult for you’ John softly said ‘I can’t even imagine and I’m so sorry to have put you through it all’
“That’s alright, thank you for watching Rosie last night”
“Quite so, but seeing that you have been up there…”
‘John, I know what to do, you’ve shown me a hundred times, you left notes everywhere plus she’ll always sleeps through the night, doesn’t she?’
“We might as well”
They walked down the stairs and went into the waiting cab to Angelo’s where the window seat table was waiting for them.
‘You know Mary would be the first to say we shouldn’t do this to ourselves’
“Oh god Sherlock” John swallowed hard. He searched for his phone and thankfully they hadn’t taken it. He rang Greg Lestrade.
John nodded.
After a while John said ‘You taste like cinnamon’
‘You’, Sherlock pointed at the redhead who blushed immediately, ‘You went home alone last night’.
‘You had a case for me?’ Sherlock asked.
“Sherlock, let’s get to the pub. We haven’t been out in ages”
Suddenly he felt someone holding him, hugging him even. He felt a hand stroking his hair, a soft voice whispering everything would be okay that he just had to wake up.
‘Am I disturbing you?’ Mycroft asked as if he was interested John thought.
‘I’m sorry Mary. What were you saying?’
‘He doesn’t know what he is talking about clearly’, Sebastian shrugged sheepishly and tried to grab the money.
John walked to the bathroom and Sherlock heard the water running. He quickly closed the window and walked to the bedroom to take off his clothes and fold them neatly. When John walked in he couldn’t help but smile.
‘Okay’ he whispered ‘okay I will bloody well go out there again and look for him’
‘Yes I know, it’s devastating to watch on all people but especially Sherlock who lived on solving difficult things with his mind’
‘Right Oh and John?’
‘Oh John, have some faith in Sherlock’ Mary said with a sigh.
‘Yes?’ John really didn’t have the time for Mycroft’s cumbrousness.
‘We’ll be staying here until we need to go back to college if that’s alright’
When John was grocery shopping, Sherlock was unpacking his suitcase in the bedroom. He looked at the big bed and started to doubt himself again. What if John didn’t feel what he felt? What if he had read the signs all wrong again? John would need the extra bedroom, he was sure of it.
‘Is he sleeping, Sherlock?’ Mrs Watson asked.
“Oh” John said looking around for the exit of the park that led to their home.
The other four held John and made him look how Sherlock was beaten to a pulp. He had been hit in the face when he fought to free himself and now they had put a knife on his throat.
‘What was it this time Sherlock?’ Mycroft gently put a blanket over his younger brother.
‘I took the bus back home’ Rosie said ‘You had the puppy eye look again. I told Sherlock about it and when I left Sherlock had the look as well, no Sherlock had a different look…’ she thought for a moment ‘Sherlock had a very pensive look’ she concluded.
‘You just don’t know it, do you?’ Sebastian looked at his friends with a grin.
‘We have a whole week still’ John whispered ‘plenty of time to make love’
“No” Sherlock said again.
‘That’s my queue’ John smiled ‘I’ll be back tomorrow, alright?’ He squeezed Sherlock’s hand
‘Or it’s for Sherlock and I’m opening his mail by mistake’
Sherlock’s voice trembled.
“Nothing, breakfast is ready”
‘Yes but…’
“Why, what’s wrong?” John asked.
‘You are friends right? For a long time now, mum is dead and someone (not Sherlock) shot her. So who should feel guilty? The one who shot her!’
‘Right’
‘It is about time, I’m bored out of my skull’ Sherlock said while stretching his long arms above his head.
John looked at Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock noticed and quickly took his hand off John’s arm.
‘For making you feel like we weren’t there for you, for making you feel alone’
John took both Sherlock’s hands in his hands and asked Sherlock to look at him.
“I’m sorry John”, he started “I’m sorry for being such a …”
‘Sweet dreams Sherlock. I do love you, little brother’
‘Is this real?’ Sherlock asked, ‘am I not dreaming?’
“Yeah you were late last night, best let you sleep”
The next day Mycroft came as promised with the American ambassador. John hadn’t told Sherlock who the client was. It was much more fun to see Sherlock’s reaction when the man started to speak.
After finishing his tea he tried to go back to sleep again. Hoping the dreams would stay away this time. But as soon as he had fallen asleep the dream returned; the bullet coming slowly at him, closing in and suddenly Mary jumping in front of it. The crying out started all over again, the shrieking in anguish, he heard it from afar and couldn’t seem to stop it.
Of course Mary had urged him to go after Sherlock, she would he’d known that. He even felt a tiny bit of guilt. What if he had gone to Sherlock sooner, would this have happened? He had looked all over London in all the places he could think of only to end up in Baker Street again. Mrs H hadn’t seen him for days she’d said. So John paced up and down thinking of where he might be when all of a sudden the door swung open and Sherlock swayed in. His hair was messy and his clothes dirty. He had bags under his eyes and his pupils were dilated.
John stood up and walked to the sofa to sit next to Sherlock.
John stood there looking at him ‘Sherlock? What is the matter? Why do you have that look on your face?’
“No you may not”
“But you could have considered for one second that I might have!” John practically screamed now. “That is what relationships are about you know, caring about the other person, thinking about someone else than yourself for a change!”
‘You didn’t sleep well’ Sherlock simply said ignoring John’s mood.
He gently planted a kiss on the curly head and tried to get as comfortable as he could in a bath with a sleeping Sherlock on his chest, smiled at Sherlock’s sleeping body and quietly said; ‘Christ, I love you, Sherlock Holmes’
Brown blinked a little too long to be normal.
((bruh idk what drink i’m on i got distracted and watched youtube for four hours))
John looked at the caller ID, Mrs. Hudson, and answered the phone. His voice came out hoarse so he coughed then tried again. "Hi, is everything alright?......tell him we're not taking cases right now.....I'm sure it is but ours is probably more important." He sighed, "I guess just, we'll stop by." He hung up his mobile and looked at Sherlock who had a question in his eyes. "There's a new client waiting for us, he says it's really important, that the police won't listen to him and he won't leave until we've seen him."
Sherlock cried out :”Again!” and “More!” and John complied.
A few beats, and then, "Very well. I'll send a car to transport you two."
Emmett was dead.
~~~~~
He unswaddled the now restless baby and made quick work of the nappy, and set the dirty one aside for now. They would need a proper rubbish bin for them, otherwise, they just had the regular bin which contained no odor eliminating properties. The thought stalled John for a second, who then wondered why they never had one in the first place. He constantly had to take out the trash when it was barely full due to Sherlock's disposed of organic matter and noxious substances. It was a chemistry professor's worst nightmare.
Part of Sherlock wanted to complain about John acting that way toward others, and the other part wanted to kiss him for making the idiot secretary willing to cooperate. When doctors and therapists began coming in for the day, Sherlock left John to wait for the patient list and started meeting with each individually.
Sherlock just looked bewildered now.
Sherlock continued carding his fingers through John's sandy hair. He felt a twist in his stomach at John experiencing such pain, and sick that taking on this case was probably the cause of it. His nightmares had mostly seceded, and it was obvious to him that this case was a trigger for their return. With this guilt, he couldn't lose himself in the feeling of John holding onto him. He wished more than anything John would just choose to do this instead of needing it as an anchor for staving off a panic attack.
Sherlock blinked a few times then leaned away from the table, looking at John. “For me?”
The sound of John's footsteps up the stairs pulled him from his thoughts.
John ignored the tickle of Sherlock's curls against his cheek and focused on the words in front of him instead. Sure enough, in order of date, the names of each victim were in succession. He noticed something else too. "Sherlock, Emmett's name is next."
Frustrated with the case (and himself if he was being honest, which he wasn't), he stomped down the stairs and into Mrs. Hudson's flat. His eyes quickly observed that they were having tea at the dinner table and fresh scones.
"That absolutely cannot happen again, not with Eleanor here. It was already too much risking Mrs. Hudson like that."
There was supposed to be story progression but I got really soft with my boys instead uhh, I'm not complaining.
‘Won’t your parents mind that we aren’t here?’
‘Hmpf’
‘Bloody hell, it’s hot outside’ he said stating the obvious.
‘No, thank you, we’ll be fine’ Sherlock smiled.
‘Oh god Sherlock I’m so sorry. I’m such a cock. I really shouldn’t have said anything’
John repeated the kiss, this time it was longer, more tender and John pulled Sherlock toward him, holding him close. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock took John around the waist after some hesitation.
John started to read;
The violinist finished playing, Sherlock thanked him and John said “I won’t ever forget this evening”
‘Happy Christmas to you as well, sweetheart’, his mother smiled and walked over to his bed. She sat down and brushed her fingers through Sherlock’s luscious curls. ‘You need a haircut’, she said knowing very well he would never agree to that. ‘Will you get up soon, dear? Breakfast is ready and in a few hours the guests will arrive’
‘How did she…’ he started.
‘Pardon?’, the man asked.
John went to sit in his chair and pretended to read the paper but he was watching Sherlock. Something was bothering him, if only he knew what it was.
‘Yes, but when I ask dad he looks at me funny’ Rosie put down her spoon with cereal which was half way towards her mouth.
‘John, when you started to kiss me, all those emotions came rushing out all at once and I did not know what to do with them, I could not control them, they were controlling me. I have never done this’ pointing on John and himself ‘before, not with a girl and not with a boy’ Sherlock sighed.
‘I, Sherlock, what are you talking about?’
‘Hurry up Mycroft he can be here any minute!’
“That is exactly what I tried to tell him, little brother but he still feels guilty” Mycroft came in.
Ugliness only comes out in darkness when you give it a chance, hate feeds hate, so they decided not to think about the kids who attacked them and let Lestrade deal with it this time. Which he did and it didn’t take long before the group of haters reared their ugly head again and they were all arrested.
Sherlock looked at John; how could he ever tell John what his nightmare was about? He felt guilty enough as it was.
Sherlock just stood there completely baffled.
‘How do you feel about that?’ John asked.
‘It is due to the dry wintery weather’ Sherlock started to explain. ‘That and our clothes (you are wearing a jumper) are rubbing against our skin and they are charging electric pulses or are getting static’
Greg looked at John; ‘Come on John, do I really have to spell that out to you? It’s obvious right?’
‘Well, stop it and come and help with the tea will you?’
They both went upstairs and started packing their suitcases. Sherlock was finished quickly and went downstairs to see if everything would be as his parents left it and when John came down, he went back up to check the bedrooms again.
After breakfast Sherlock longed to go outside for a walk but he knew he would not get a change today. He helped his mother with the dishes and his mother prepared for the guests to arrive that afternoon. He played some chess with Mycroft (and won of course).
The group had surrounded them and four were starting to beat up Sherlock and knocking him to the ground, kicking him wherever they could. They trampled on his face, stamped on his cheekbones, he felt his lip split, he tried to protect his head by holding his arms above his head but it was no use, the four against him. He tried to fight back, kicked some, hit some but the more he fought the more they hit back, some even with bike chains it seemed, until one of them took out a knife and held it against his throat. “Stop fighting or I’ll slice you open and you’re sissy boyfriend too” he hissed.
Sherlock nodded again.
‘I am falling for you as well’
‘Yes, sorry Mycroft’ John said ‘I’m just shocked’
John felt uneasy all of a sudden ‘No, I haven’t, why?’
‘What’s wrong Sherlock?’ John asked touching his shoulder.
‘I am used to it really’, Sherlock said ‘See my brother over there, normally he is pretending to be a very important member of the government, but mother has told him not to talk about work this Christmas. He doesn’t know what to do with himself and he (we both do) hates Christmas. So now he is looking like the Cheshire Cat all day’
Mr Watson took Harry by her arm; ‘You listen to me, have you been drinking?’
‘He is in fact, our John is becoming a doctor if you believe it!’, Mr Watson laughed ‘Sherlock is graduating as well then?’
“Yes, I think so, still a bit confused”
John looked at Sherlock’s luscious curls, his long eyelashes, his gorgeously curved mouth, his bare chest. He was his, John thought. He never in his wildest dreams could have imagined it but they’ve been together for little over a year now and every day with Sherlock was special, even the simplest things as having a cup of tea together and now just sitting here in a bath together.
‘I appreciate that you think so but still I am not the one to tell you that, your dad is’
‘I will, thank you’
Love is love and no matter who loves who it is a gazillion times better than hatred.
‘Shall we go outside for a walk?’ John asked ‘It’s so warm here, I need some fresh air’
‘Oh’ John looked at Rosie ‘What did you hear?’
Mycroft turned around; ‘Actually everything you do is my business, Sherlock. It all reflects on me and the family. But that is not why I am here; I am here to tell you to come home for Christmas.’
‘Yes, does our boy even know or is there a ‘slight’ chance he will run when he sees all this?’
‘Bloody hell’ John sighed but that was all he could say as Sherlock’s mouth covered his again as they plunged onto the bed.
“Hello my darling”, he smiled to his daughter who gave him a big toothless grin “ready to get a wash and get dressed? Oh you want breakfast do you? We have to be quiet though, love, Sherlock is still sleeping”
‘I will do that and much more’ Sherlock growled taking off John’s shirt.
“How on earth do you know all that?” Greg asked “he hasn’t even given me an official statement yet!”
Before John headed out the door he peaked into the bedroom. Sherlock hadn’t moved an inch. John felt a bit disappointed. He knew Sherlock had been working until late but still he’d hoped Sherlock would have been up and would have remembered. He shrugged and softly closed the door and left with Rosie.
‘Well… let’s see, have I?’ Harry tilted her head ‘Perhaps a teensy-weensy bit’ holding her thumb and finger an inch apart. She started laughing maniacally when she saw her mother’s face ‘Oh come on mother, like you never drink when daddy is away on ‘business’. You know’ she whispered to Sherlock ‘our dad is an adulterer, ssshhh’ she put her finger to her mouth.
‘What John?’
‘You are a mess Sherlock’
He sat there letter in hand, the dried flowers on the table.
‘Me? No, it’s just the damn heat!’ Sherlock said
‘Right you are sonny’
‘May I come in?’ Mycroft made the decision for him.
“Don’t shout dear” Mrs. Hudson said “you can always come down if you need me you know” she shook her head.
‘Let me try’ John put his hand on Mycroft’s arm.
And they kissed, champagne glasses still in hand, holding each other tight with the other.
‘Hmm?’
“Me?” John laughed “I wouldn’t dare to”
John looked at Sherlock knowing how much recuperation he had to do still, physically as emotionally and leaned in for a kiss.
‘Mycroft…’ Sherlock hissed a warning.
John couldn’t help but feel guilty all of a sudden. When was the last time he had seen Sherlock? He couldn’t even remember! He felt the guilt sweep over him when he thought about how a moment ago he was judging Mycroft in his mind about a monthly appointment when he couldn’t even remember when he last was in contact with Sherlock.
John and Sherlock are going to look at the flat in Baker Street for the first time and stay in London for New Year's
‘Will it be alright?’ John wondered.
‘You should be thankful your father and I are not taking you to church’
‘You can’t believe what?’
‘I do. Living with him does have its perks believe it or not. I don’t think he’s fooled but we can always try’
Sherlock walked up the stairs to his room which was indeed just as he left it, tidy but with his science books still open like he had been reading them just the night before, which he found odd. He put his clothes away in the closet and looked out the window. It would be dark soon and he really would love to go for a walk. His parents would never allow him to go now. The next days would be crazy with Christmas parties and people and too busy for his liking. He walked downstairs and put his coat and scarf on.
‘What do you mean?’ Sherlock asked.
‘I don’t have one now. You know it’s fascinating’ Sherlock rambled on still under the influence of something or other ‘your hair is glowing’
‘No, packing’ Sherlock said looking stern ‘I have seen your room but that alone will take two hours’
‘So’ she said when John was finished ‘mum shot Sherlock, Sherlock nearly died, then when that woman pointed her gun at Sherlock years later mum jumped in front of the bullet and died’ She looked at her dad and Sherlock who both nodded.
‘Really, now come here you’ John pulled Sherlock close to him put his hand on the back of his curly head to pull him down to kiss him.
‘What took you so long?’ Sherlock sighed. ‘I have loved you for so long John, I have waited for so many years. I’d do anything for you, even see you get married’ a single tear rolled down his cheek.
All he heard was a soft moaning. When he was close enough he saw Sherlock’s bleeding face, his cheekbones were bruised and his lip cut open, one eye was swollen and he seemed to have a head wound because under his curls blood was dripping.
‘You know what I mean John Watson, don’t pretend. I’ve know it for a very long time now. I probably shouldn’t marry you to begin with’ Mary sighed ‘Yes I’ve seen you look at him more then I care to remember. I don’t mind so much anymore now, but when we just were together, when he just came back from…’
Sherlock took a small package from his jacket pocket and looked John in the eyes; “Happy anniversary John”
John looked over his shoulder to Sherlock; ‘Is something the matter Sherlock? You are so quiet and that isn’t like you, or at least… I don’t know you for that long yet, but I do know you like to talk about things. So, let’s hear it, what is bothering you?’
Rosie began to stir and mumble at that moment. “Wait here”, John said “I’m right back”
Sherlock tried to smile but again that hurt.
John shifted in his chair; it was now or never.
“I’m coming Mrs. Hudson, one minute” John said.
‘So?’ John sighed; get on with it he thought.
“You shouldn’t make promises for other people, haven’t I taught you anything?”
“You were having a nightmare Sherlock” John tried to comfort him.
‘I wouldn’t ask if I thought it was’
‘Putting your coat collar up all the time’
“Afternoon, sorry am I disturbing you?”
‘Putting everything to his hand you mean’
‘Shh, you’ll wake them’ John softly said.
‘You haven’t even heard the rest yet’ Mycroft said ‘just let him speak’
“You look like hell” Greg said.
‘No, no, we want you to’, some redhead friend of Sebastian said. Sherlock didn’t know half of these college students. He didn’t care to either. He knew Sebastian because he had some classes with him, but he didn’t like him very much.
Of course it was only a matter of time before Sherlock would notice. One morning when John walked in after yet another night of little sleep, Sherlock looked at him while John was pouring coffee in his mug.
John and Sherlock turned around quickly shocked that Rosie stood there and had listened to their conversation.
‘I mean it Sherlock. We may act all tough like emotions isn’t for us, but you and I both know it is or you wouldn’t have done what you did’
‘What?’ John snapped.
“Soldiers”, she swallowed and tried not to cry all over again.
‘Mycroft, don’t go sentimental on me, please’ Sherlock felt a lump in his throat he didn’t want to admit was there.
‘How are you feeling?’ Sherlock asked.
‘What?’ John asked.
‘Well perhaps I should explain whom it concerns first’
‘I do not think I had another choice’, Sherlock sulked.
‘You did what?’ the friend screamed, making the blonde girl turn around.
After dinner John cleared the table and Sherlock just sat in his chair, his hands folded under his chin in his thinking pose.
When he opened the door to 221B Baker Street he was welcomed by Molly and Mrs Hudson who was holding Rosie. He felt happy to be home again. The stairs was a bit of a climb with a painful knee but he managed and when he sat down in his own chair again he realised how much he missed being in his own home.
‘I am expecting you in fifteen minutes, young man’
“Sherlock, Sherlock wake up”, John was shaking Sherlock who was clearly having a nightmare. He even had tears on his face.
‘But you didn’t’
The men were screaming at each other with all the other friends standing around them. Sherlock smirked and took the money from the table and put it in his trouser pocket. He walked away to his room. Stupid Sebastian, god he hated stupid people.
Mycroft was just stepping out of his car in front of 221B Baker Street when he saw Dr Watson close the front door and try to walk away.
‘Everyday’ John sighed reaching to kiss Sherlock’s lips.
Mycroft shook his head and with a sigh folded the piece of paper and put it in his notebook.
‘You needed us Greg?’ he said.
‘So, Sherlock, how is college? You’re almost done, aren’t you, I mean just six more months, right?’ his father tried.
‘But John perhaps you have an admirer’
‘Mycroft’
‘Greg, No you’re right on time, you can help with the decorations. Mycroft here is only complaining’
Not that John himself was feeling angry, oh he was and lots of it. It was Valentine’s Day after all and they were supposed to be spending the evening in a whole other manner than sitting opposite of each other being cross. He had asked Mrs. Hudson to care for Rosie just because he wanted to surprise Sherlock with a night out but then the case got rid of that idea. He had a present for Sherlock in the bedroom, a bottle of champagne, some chocolates, all that typical Valentine’s Day stuff and they would have made love all evening and night. But the mood Sherlock was in now or the mood he had brought John in, there would be no love making whatsoever!
John nodded in agreement and they walked through the park.
“No to be honest”
John dropped his paper. He did not see this coming at all; ‘What?’ he asked.
‘Really Sherlock?’ John’s eyes turned a darker shade of blue.
“Not that I mind” John softly said “Somehow you’re much more loose and loving when you’re drunk”
Sherlock put the tape in, switched on the telly and they sat on the bed to watch the tape start.
‘If you are going to argue any louder he can here you outside and he won’t come up at all’
‘Oh for god sake, if it’s his you’ll get the blame’ John said while opening the envelope.
“Soldiers”, Sherlock whispered and tossed and turned in his bed “Soldiers, Rosie”
‘He’s always looking at you, mate. You are both my friends that’s why I never meddled with what I think is your business and yours alone, but since you ask…’
‘Of course not John, don’t be silly, I would love you and Rosie to live here, and I am her Godfather after all!’ Sherlock smiled.
John looked at Sherlock for a moment he couldn’t find the words but when he saw Sherlock’s face he said; ‘I blamed you for a very long time’ When Sherlock wanted to interrupt him he raised his hand ‘No let me finish please. I blamed you for what happened to Mary. But she was right all along. She was the one with the past, the deep dark secret which was bound to come out one way or another. It wasn’t fair to blame you. It was in her nature to save you, a payback of sorts perhaps for the time she had shot you. The fact is no one really knew how things would have played out. If it hadn’t been Norbury it could’ve been another one. She would have always chosen to save you, or me, or Rosie or whoever if she could. That time it was you, she loved you too Sherlock I hope you know that and yes you are right I have to tell Rosie. She can’t be asking you all the time because her father is too scared of her reaction. I have wronged you Sherlock, I was angry at you for so long but in truth you weren’t to blame. You are still the best friend I have ever had. You have been there for me all those years, helping me take care of Rosie, who’d do that? Only someone who cares deeply and I think you do, you can pretend you don’t, but I know you, you do. Will you stay when I tell Rosie? I don’t think I can handle it to tell her alone’
‘Sherlock he won’t ever tell me! You must tell me please! I must know! You are always honest with me, treating me more like a grownup than anyone else does and I am 12.
“I was? You’re not dead?” Sherlock carefully touched John to see if he was real.
‘Have you ever been in love? I mean really loved someone up to the point you would do anything for them to be happy?’
Sherlock mumbled something but John couldn’t hear him because of the sobbing. ‘What’s that Sherlock?’
‘I promise, try to enjoy your evening’ Sherlock said before closing the door before John could say anything more.
“You know I have to take your statement eventually John, the sooner the better” Greg Lestrade watched John pacing up and down the hospital corridor waiting until the doctor came with news about Sherlock.
‘Haven’t got one’
“Yes? What can I do for you?”
‘There is no girlfriend then who is waiting for you?’ Sherlock heard himself say.
‘Please don’t talk too loud or shout out of anger, everyone is still asleep’ Sherlock warned.
‘Don’t remind me’, John said shaking his head. ‘I don’t know where she is now, but I bet you she took the first bottle of liquor or wine she saw and is now somewhere drinking off her hangover from Christmas Eve. She’s a drunk, my sister and my parents are very good at pretending she’s not’
‘We really would love to see the flat first, Mrs H’
‘You know me so well’ Sherlock mumbled.
“I know” John took Sherlock’s hand, kissed it and they started to walk again.
Sherlock turned around slowly ‘What?’
They started giggling. John reached out for Sherlock and Sherlock grabbed on like a life-jacket and just held John tight.
John started to kiss Sherlock’s neck and got rid of the shirt. His hands were all over Sherlock’s bare chest. Sherlock moaned softly.
It startled John.
‘You weren’t surprised at all were you? You were just playing along’
‘I… I really don’t know what you mean, Sherlock’
He shook his head. Not now, not tonight. “Go away”, he said with a loud voice. He startled an elderly lady who passed him. He didn’t care. His mind sometimes played tricks on him, still. He needed to get rid of the thoughts inside before they took over.
Weeks later John was a different man, he lived back on Baker Street again and it felt as if he had never been gone. He felt so much happier.
Suddenly he grabbed my arm clinging on to it; ‘John, what is happening to me? I am losing parts of my life, my memory, I don’t recognise things anymore. John, I am losing my mind and it’s frightening’
‘He is not coming to pick me up himself?’ Sherlock asked surprised. ‘That’s a first. But I am quite capable to go back by train, mother, there is no need to send his car. I’m sure he needs it himself’
“Say something damn you!”
“Whoohoo” Mrs. Hudson said knocking the door on cue.
“She…! Rosie stretched out her arms to be picked up by Sherlock. Sherlock picked her up and her tiny arms held him around his neck. “I missed you too” he softly said to the blonde curls against his chest.
‘Good morning, Sherlock’ John smiled ‘I already started breakfast if you don’t mind, I’m famished!’
Good, he had a little more than an hour, he thought. He walked outside and breathed in the fresh crispy air of freshly fallen snow and frostbite. He put his gloves on, put his coat collar up and with a quick pace started to walk.
“But Sherlock I promised Greg we’d help out”
‘Are you still there Dr Watson?’ Mycroft asked.
John woke up stretching his arms. Oh, today was a special day, he thought with a smile. He looked over to Sherlock who was still fast asleep. Sherlock was working late again last night on some case. He came home very late when John was already sleeping. It would be cruel to wake him. John watched Sherlock sleep; his curls hung over his forehead, his mouth slightly open with those luscious lips. His long fingers were besides his head. Of course he hadn’t bothered undressing. He lay on the bed fully clothed like he just crashed there. John sighed; he would really love to stay here next to Sherlock in bed but he had to go to the surgery and drop Rosie off at the sitter.
‘List Sherlock’ Mycroft said.
But before Mycroft could finish the ambassador took Sherlock’s hand, shook it and said; ‘Nice to meet you son, very nice. So you’re the famous detective?’
After a while John stopped to get some water out of the rucksack. He drank a few sips and offered the container to Sherlock. Sherlock never took anything with him when walking but he took a few sips of water anyway.
“Wait what?”
“Nothing much”
John bent over to kiss Sherlock, a soft kiss on his lips. ‘I love you Sherlock Holmes, don’t you ever think otherwise’
Mrs Holmes walked with them to the door. More guests were leaving now after that incident, talking about what had happened. Sherlock saw his mother patting Mrs Watson’s arm before she got into her car. In the car there was a heated discussion with Harry and Mr Watson going on.
‘Redbeard’ John said.
‘What?’, Sebastian quickly turned around facing Sherlock.
When the ambassador was out the door he could hear him make a phone call; ‘What do you mean she isn’t there anymore? She quit? What?’
‘No Sherlock I won’t leave it, this is important’ Mycroft pulled up a chair and sat next to Sherlock ‘you almost killed yourself. I wouldn’t know what I have done if I had lost you’
‘Well’ Sherlock said when they stood in front of the flat ‘here it is, what do you think?’
He practically shoved John and Mary out the door.
She hugged him tight and Sherlock smiled ‘Hello Mrs H, how are you? This is John Watson, I told you about him’
He cleared his throat; ‘Sherlock can we talk?’ he asked softly.
Sherlock swallowed away his toast before answering; ‘Yes, father, almost done’
They sat down at the kitchen table with tea where John told Rosie everything that had happened before and after her mum’s death.
Sherlock looked up; ‘Is there any reason why they couldn’t tell me themselves?’
‘Why are you doing that?’
‘Ah, I see, well one must always do as his doctor says’, Sherlock smirked.
‘God no’ John said.
‘Yes but do you remember what to do when she wakes up? Oh if only Mrs Hudson was home!’
They started giggling.
They started kissing and didn’t hear a knock on the door but the sudden; “Woohoo, are you awake yet?” got them startled.
“Yes, we will come” and in a low voice to Lestrade “just give us some time alone, we will come I promise”
“Are you on a case?”
“Rest now Sherlock, you can give that statement after you’ve rested”
Sherlock
‘The one thing that lifts his spirits is this’ she said and she turned on a cd player.
Then they got up to put on their coat and help Lestrade solve another case.
‘Wow’ John said when he came up for air ‘if I knew you could kiss like that I wouldn’t have waited this long! Now you said something about a haven and a bed?’
Sherlock’s eyes were still wet but he stopped crying.
John looked up, his eyes filled with tears. ‘I’m at a loss Sherlock. It’s so lonely and empty in the house, too big for Rosie and me, so cold. I don’t want to live there no more; I just can’t live there anymore’
John walked up the stairs with his hands full of groceries when Mrs Hudson called him from downstairs.
‘Mummy told you to come, did she?’, Sebastian laughed about his own remark.
‘John’ she nodded, she walked to the bathroom ‘here is the bathroom and this’ opening the bedroom ‘is the bedroom. Upstairs is a small bedroom, but this is a big bed. Well, there are all sorts here you know’
John nodded and walked Mycroft to the door. Damn Sherlock, he thought.
‘No thank you. I will come straight to the point’ Mycroft stood in the cosy living room, umbrella in hand even though it was a bright sunny day.
‘Mike! Is that any way to great you mother and father? Give us a kiss!’
‘Let’s walk back home. Here a sandwich’ John pulled a sandwich out of the rucksack and gave it to Sherlock. ‘You will taste of strawberry marmalade later’
‘Don’t you touch that!’
Sherlock cleared his throat and whispered; “I will Greg, but talking is hard”
‘Hmph’
Sherlock snorted.
“Ah Dr Watson, back already?” Mycroft asked.
‘Sherlock’
‘Promise Sherlock?’
“Well John Watson, you don’t let some thugs spoil a night out on the town with me do you?” Sherlock smirked.
‘Oh please indulge me’
John looked at his watch; it was 10 o’clock already. Outside he saw snow falling softly in the lamp lights. He sighed; “I’m off to bed” and folded his paper.
“Mrs. Hudson” he yelled when he walked to the kitchen.
‘I don’t mind, thank you for pretending’
‘And you still feel guilty of mum’s death’ she said pointing at Sherlock.
‘He doesn’t seem to recognise me’ Mycroft turned to John. He looked worried and years older. ‘I just can’t bear it to see him like this. He is filthy and totally out of it’
“I don’t know what to say” Sherlock softly said “You are right, as always when it concerns matters of the heart I am a fool, John. I didn’t know this was important to you and I’m sorry, I should have been more thoughtful.” Sherlock walked away from the window and towards John. He stood close to him and with his large hands he took John’s face and held it. He looked into his eyes and said with his deep baritone voice; “Don’t you ever think that you don’t matter to me John Watson. You do. I am nothing without you”
‘Bring my harpoon will you’
It started to snow again. Soft snow falling on his curls and coat. He put his coat collar back up and hunched his shoulders. He was getting cold and his mood did not improve either.
“You must know by now I have my ways, detective inspector” Mycroft rolled his eyes at Greg “about that; do give the detective your statement John. It’s imperative those thugs are caught as soon as possible”
Caring may not be an advantage, pretending not to care isn’t either. Or feeling not cared for…
When he sat on his bed drinking his tea while watching a sleeping John he smiled. If only, he thought only to dismiss the thought immediately. John had just become a widower furthermore he had never indicated as much in that direction. Sherlock sometimes had thought there were some looks, and of course he had sometimes hoped for his secret (very secret) feelings to be returned but when he kept them hidden… no it was for the best. He didn’t want to lose John as his friend.
Sherlock looked at John “John” he said but stopped.
‘Are you sure you’re okay? Do we need to call someone else, Molly maybe?’ John turned to Mary ‘I could still call Harry she’d love to babysit her niece but it’s a Friday night and she’s probably in the pub by now…’
“Most considerate of you on the other hand you can always wake me for morning sex” SH
Sherlock opened the door to a cosy furnished living room with a fireplace. Two chairs on each side of the fireplace and a sofa on the opposite side of the room. A table under the window and a small kitchen with a table and two chairs.
“I just saw Dr Watson leave”, Mycroft said.
“Sherlock!” John giggled, was it the wine or the atmosphere, he didn’t know but he knew this night was perfect.
‘I will tell him the next time I will speak to him’ Mrs Holmes said.
“There is a first time for everything I suppose” Mycroft said cynically. “You don’t look very well John”
John knew he had to push through this time ‘Sherlock’ he said leaning forward towards Sherlock ‘I don’t want to pry in your personal life or your emotional one. It’s just that, and please correct me if I’m wrong, every time you look at me; I see a storm in your eyes. I can’t think normally, I feel like time will stop just for me to look in those eyes, to get lost in them. That the clocks will reset to the moment when we first met and we can start all over again and do it properly this time.’
Sherlock felt relief, John was okay. His face was bruised but he was okay.
‘Do I need to call Mycroft?’
‘Oh, no I don’t, I think it’s a great idea!’ John sounded all excited.
"We're not actually leaving, are we?"
So John prsesed in, slowly still. Gently. HE wathce d SHerlock’s face to make sure tha t he wasn’t going int too fast. Slowing sdown if he saw any pain or cringing. And moving when he saw anticatpinion and pleaseur. Nice.
Sherlock looked down at Ella and gently ran one of his hands through the short smattering of brown hair on her head. "It was both of us, John. Do start realizing how much you contribute to the work."
"Oh. Well, there's just a bit more incentive when the person I'm making the changes for regularly soils her own pants."
"We have things under control right now, there's no immediate danger for you or anyone else tonight, but that won't last. Tomorrow we're going to the rehab center and we'll get protection for every potential victim. Just focus on yourself and that little girl."
"Thrilling."
"About Eleanor." John sat down at the spare chair and Sherlock finally put his tools down to give John his full attention. "You know how Moriarty came here once? And the bomb across the street?"
Sherlock took a mental inventroy of his position. He was leaning agaisnt John's chest, wrappe dinn his arms, and frese of his trousers and pants whic fell compelte ly off in the scuffle.
With that, he backed off and left the room. Sherlock and John met him in the hall where he was informing the security guard to leave him in there until the search was completed. It would be an attempt at further intimidation.
His favorite consisted of the two of them, a locked room, and no surveillance.
John handed Sherlock the now heated bottle, "I think that means yes actually. Though I doubt she'll remember anything we said when she actually is old enough to say her first word."
Before opening the lid of the box, he looked at John who gave him a reassuring smile and crossed his arms. Curiosity definitely piqued, Sherlock opened the lid and pulled out…pairs of pants.
~~~~~
John smiled to himself, "Eggs on toast then." One day, he thought, Sherlock would admit he had an appetite.
Eleanor even seemed a bit sad when they left.
Sherlock knew how difficult the journey of sobriety was and still continues to be. All of the victims were just past one of the hardest parts. His worst cravings occurred just out of rehab, and he's certain these victims, like himself, were doing their best. Only to have their hard work cut off so cruelly from a couple uninformed and vicious morons. It made him sick.
~~~~~
The boys deal with Eleanor's departure in different ways.
Sherlock hadn't meant to let it slip that he'd also sleep in the bed. He was just going to slip in unnoticed after John fell asleep. He must be more tired than he thought. "Shut up before I change my mind."
John walked over and strapped the baby in her carrier, taking care to make the straps secure but not too tight.
Acid churned in Sherlock's stomach the entire ride to Baker Street. Ella's terrified cries echoed around the halls of his mind palace, so he couldn't even retreat to there. How was he to protect her now? She was alone, without connection to the remaining few people she trusted. He knew logically she would gain trust of whatever insipid adults she was placed with, but how could Sherlock know that for sure? There was always a possibility that she would be placed with a family that didn't treat her with the care and attention she needed.
"Mr. Brown named you as an accomplice in the stalking of six victims, and sole perpetrator in the murder of all six. Is he lying?"
"I've never thought for a second you actually were a sociopath. You weren't trying very hard."
Brown gulped.
John just smiled harder and finally left the room to get the takeout.
The bits and bobs they purchased for the baby were mostly on his bed and in the cot. He approached the cot and began rifling through the items, analyzing them based on how much they used or didn't use an object. A plush bee stood out from the pile, and Sherlock took it and sat down on his bed.
That night, Emmett already went off to sleep by ten, which left Sherlock and John alone. Sherlock spent some time intruder-proofing the flat. He tied a trip wire across the bottom of the doorway and secured it to the couch and a desk which he'd moved to the right position. Then he tied several cans filled with coins together and positioned it so that the string tying them all together, was held in place by the door latch. If opened, the cans would crash to the floor and surely wake up everyone. To top it off, he shoved the client chair under the door handle so whoever tried to get in would have to force the door loudly. He didn't bother with the windows because the fire escape led to his bedroom, and the others were on the second floor with no easy access.
Sherlock easily deduced what they were and his face morphed into one of loss. He tamped it down quickly, but John already saw it.
John felt confused. "But he has me, I'm not going anywhere."
Brown looked as if he was about to cry. Pathetic. "I didn't mean to. Really, I swear, I wouldn't have gone after a family. I- Do you really think he'd kill a baby?"
"Sherlock, I am so sorry. You have a huge heart and deserve so much happiness, and you got all of that pain instead. I wish someone, or me, had been there to tell you you deserve better than Victor and that you were good enough, and
"To Lestrade?"
Evans smiled, "Yes."
Sherlock got out of bed quickly and tripped when he pulled the duvet halfway off the bed due to its being wrapped around one of his legs. He pointed toward the cot with one hand and answered his phone with the other.
Her departure made John realize how late it had gotten. "Sorry I didn't realize the time, you must be starving."
As he left to go upstairs and change, he heard Sherlock say, "Only because there are no baby monitors and I'm not getting up every time she cries."
"Right, okay. So where does this put him? These factors."
The drop off at the adoption center was...distressing to say the least. It only took a few minutes, but it was enough. John kissed Ella goodbye while she was enveloped in Sherlock's arms. And Sherlock kissed her goodbye as well, but haltingly handed her over to the awaiting worker.
They spent a nice long, hot shower pressed to each other and getting off. They'd talk more about feelings once they got to bed that night.
John rmemoced his own trosuers and panst and then--
"Okay?"
The last few interviews were conducted over the next few days, and in the end, it wasn't surprising. Sherlock messaged Connor that they were hired, and somewhere in London Connor excitedly showed the message to their flatmate.
At least John understood him. He always had, even if he disagreed with the practicality of it. Anyway, it was clear to him that whoever the killer was, it was someone working in the rehab center. They knew names of patients and addresses. Could it be a doctor or psychiatrist, someone specifically in the field to get close to the very people they loathe? He was certain he'd determine exactly who it was once he was able to interrogate the employees.
For lunch, he went with some quick sandwiches and a box of Sherlock's favorite biscuits. Strategically, he only made the sandwiches for himself so Sherlock would be more tempted to eat by stealing them off his plate. He also brewed fresh tea and carried it all upstairs on a tray, because unlike Sherlock he wasn't a heathen who tried carrying everything in his hands and then playing stupid when it eventually dropped to the floor.
In the end, he shouldn't have been worried. Sherlock rocked the little one to sleep and got in the bed on
"Yes, that is...a problem."
Sherlock didn't wait for a response and headed to the bedroom only to find her cot empty. His eyes scanned the room, and he noticed that the nappy bag was missing too. Promising. A killer wouldn't take supplies if they planned on just killing the baby. Ransom maybe? Leverage? Not important. He failed Emmett. He didn't investigate hard enough he didn't...He didn't.
As soon as the doors opened, Sherlock expected himself to stride over and take the baby girl out of the nurse's arms, but instead, he hesitated. This infant was now an orphan, because of
He spent the better part of the last hour trying to decide what he could do for Sherlock until a memory came back to him.
"Yes, I'm going to conduct an experiment on your daughter so if you could place her on the blanket in front of me that would be swell."
Sherlock took a shaky breath and wiped away the stubborn tear that managed to escape. "It's possible I do something like that with Ella. That's why Mycroft is right."
"She'll need to come with us to the station."
Donovan finished up her notes and clicked the pen closed. She was supposed to make sure the consulting detective left the room and returned to Lestrade's office, but John shook his head at her once. She looked between him and Sherlock and decided against an argument, and left them alone.
IMPORTANT: NOT A NEW CHAPTER
John frowned, "That's...okay." He turned back to the laptop's screen.
He snapped his gaze to John. "Hmm?"
"I have a shift at the clinic tomorrow, I already took off too many days for this-"
~~~~~
When Sherlock looked back at John, he found John giving him the warmest look. One which brought blood rushing to the surface of his cheeks. "What."
John returned the embrace tightly, and leaned back a bit to give Sherlock a proper kiss.
One side of Sherlock's mouth quirked up. "Continue."
Around a yawn, he said, "Sorry for trapping you here last night."
"Obviously not, otherwise we'd be reading the files."
Guess who's back after an impromptu month long hiatus? It's okay if you lost faith in this WIP, however I haven't and should be back to my regular once a week schedule because exams are finally over!
He ignored the whispers gnawing at his heart that declared him too volatile and inconsiderate to care for someone. For once, he wouldn't believe them.
The disruption allowed the anger between them to simmer down. "Mycroft has the flat bugged I'm sure, we can both go and have one of his minions monitor the entrance. No one besides those we know are allowed entry."
Sherlock manually pulled the contents of the drawers out and crumpled them up, leaving them in a pile on the ground. The final file he grabbed belonged to the killer himself. The label on it was blank and if he looked at it too closely he would be able to make out indentation of a name, only the letter 'Z' was discernible. It seemed the quick deletion he made during the interrogation was successful in keeping the man's name out of his head. That man didn't deserve a name or any recognition at all.
He didn't think they would come across someone better in their list, but the scientist in him meant he had to interview everyone anyway. So Connor was sent out with a "we'll be in touch if you're chosen."
Sherlock nodded once and the two made their way back to the main room. John stood off to the side where Lestrade was overseeing the investigation and tried examining the room without looking too closely at Emmett's body. No point in removing a person if they're already dead.
John did his best to look non threatening, he didn't want to pressure Sherlock but he also didn't want him to think he couldn't open up.
"Of course."
John wasn't a fan of this Victor guy who was obviously the cause of Sherlock's distress.
"Offering." He looked as confused as John felt. He turned and marched into the kitchen before John could say anything else.
The panties clung to the shape of his bum.
Important conversations are had.
John wasn't sure what they were looking for. Syringes maybe, or drugs?
The three, well three and a baby, shared a cab back to Baker Street. It was cramped with Emmett and the baby on the driver's side, John in the middle, and Sherlock against the other door. John of course, was in the middle due to being the smallest, though he would outlive God arguing that he's the average male height in the UK and Sherlock is just unnaturally tall. In any other situation he would complain, but not this one. This one gave him the perfect excuse to press fully against Sherlock without restraint. He could feel his best friend's warmth from foot to hip and all the way up to his bad shoulder. Though calling it his bad one feels like a misnomer right now due to the almost therapeutic warmth.
John was about to ask how he got in when he realized Mycroft probably had a key to most doors. "Morning. Sherlock isn't awake yet."
Sherlock just kept reiterating that he was doing it to keep himself busy because otherwise he wouldn't stop thinking about how much time they were wasting. This was partially true, but of course wasn't the real intent of his booby trapping. He wanted to make sure there was no reason for him or John to stay awake tonight. If they both went to sleep, then they would both be in Sherlock's bed. It was his only opportunity and he was not going to lose it.
Sherlock grimaced at the feel of saliva and used the bib around her neck to wipe off his hand once he pulled her away.
"Oh my god."
"It's. He's gonna kill me if you catch him. He'll know."
Self-edited as always, I hope you enjoy the chapter though I feel weird saying so after a tw.
The girl turned her face to look at him and gave him a big toothless grin as if to say she knew exactly what she was doing.
John came over to watch and sat in his own chair. "When she turns one."
There was a brief argument over which store to shop at (John wanted somewhere cheap because she would grow out of everything in a couple months, Sherlock wanted somewhere expensive because the material was higher quality and therefore more comfortable.) Sherlock won, obviously, but John worried that Sherlock would end up being one of those posh people who dress their infants in stiff formal wear all the time. Luckily this wasn't the case.
Mrs. Hudson coddled the baby while Sherlock and John put all of the new supplies they purchased away. They didn't need to make much extra space for Eleanor's things, however, that would change the older she got. For now, they simply had to clear off counter space in the kitchen, clear out a couple drawers in the bedroom. The final touch was setting up the video monitor in a way that angled it at the cot. John hoped it would be broken and therefore postpone the sleeping arrangement change, but as expected, it worked perfectly.
"Yes, I suppose that played a role as well." Sherlock rolled his eyes to avoid maintaining eye contact.
Sherlock contemplated the options. Honestly, not much from their plan had changed. "We question him at work, get an answer that indicates probable cause, then we'll have a search warrant and the cyber team can open the file."
"Good." He stood up and clapped his hands together. "What should we do today?"
The man blinked. "Who are you?"
“Just look at them.” John interrupted him.
SHerlock merely said , :"I have to urinatte." Before pulling his trousers and pants down ans doing just so.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but got into the vacant side of the bed. (His preferred side, John must have noticed.) "Yes, doctor."
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
Sherlock parades back in forth in front of them for a hot minute before John iterrupts ans says "that's enough, drama queen."
John snorted and followed Sherlock to the back of the complex. He thought his friend must be looking for the fire escape. "So you really think he's the one?"
"'Cause they're a drain on society. They're a danger to others and they're a burden to everyone. Even the people who claim to love them would be relieved if their junkie whatsit or other disappeared."
With that, the man collected his things and left his number with John before leaving, comforted in the fact that his daughter and him would be safe tonight.
While he'd stopped paying close attention to her, said baby decided his hand was much more fascinating than the bear. She bent forward and latched her mouth to the side of Sherlock's thumb and gurgled.
"Good idea." John took his laptop out and began composing a post which said just that.
The beat of the DDR machine where the crowd is gathered pulls John from his thoughts once more. He looks over and sses one lanky boi o n the blue and pink arrowed flor hitting eahc beat with ease and grace.
Prompt was that Sherlock and John have sex on an amusement park ride, wowee wubbzy my first sex scene.
John fell over him in sa satisfied heap and SHelrock hummed and wrappe dhis arms tighetly around Jphn.
He knew Sherlock would take to this well, and surprise probably all of their coworkers in the process. But ultimately, Ella would never feel alone again, never experience such dramatic changes in her life again. She could have stability now, and this way the two of them could also talk to her about her birth parents when she got older. Any other adoptive family would know nothing about them besides an old yellowed newspaper clipping,
John sat back in his seat and rubbed the back of his neck. "I'm not angry about the fall."
You could call it a sleepover.
Sherlock leaned into John but kept contact instead of just bumping back. "I promised."
Given confidence from Sherlock's bravery and the alcoholic buzz, John leaned forward placed a hand on Sherlock's knee. "I think I do."
"See?"
"The laptop. What's the password?"
Sherlock's eyes traced the watermarks in the ceiling rather than turning to face John. "He was an Irish Setter, a dog my mum got me when I was in primary school. She thought I should have a friend, and I suppose she was right. I didn't have any because I didn't speak until I was seven. I'm not really sure why I didn't. But having him, I spoke immediately to teach him tricks."
"That was rather rude."
who abandons the story, but here we are! May someone else write the world's best parentlock fic that has a conclusion, laterz!
tHe end.
Sherlock kept his face turned toward the window and stared unseeingly at London. If he let himself look at John at this proximity, he worried he wouldn't be able to control himself. Control his desire to lean even closer, or control his face to not give away his feelings for the good doctor. What he could do is close his eyes and pretend they just finished a case and were cuddled up on the ride home, ready to collapse into bed together.
"You're okay."
"That is correct."
"We're waiting at home. At least there we can rest."
Sherlock kept asking more questions and Connor answered most of them in a way that suited Sherlock's requirements, while also showing a willingness and understanding to correct themselves if the answer wasn't exactly what he wanted. The entire process took around half an hour and they both met and exceeded Sherlock's expectations.
As they walked out, John joked, "We're not the royal family, we don't have to dress her as such."
By the time John got back, the tub was full and Sherlock was in it with his legs stretched out as much as they could in the short porcelain. John placed the cup on the ground near Sherlock's upper body and turned off the tap.
John pulled Sherlock in for a nice snohg before they made their way to the steret for a cab.
John was mostly startled by their positions before moving. He must have curled against Sherlock in the night and his body still radiated with lingering warmth.
~~~~~
Mrs. Hudson said, "You saved that man's life, and his baby's. I'm proud of my boys."
Their kissing got really heated, and tey realized they didn't ahve enough time fbefore they fot off the ride to
He lost himself in the search instead of thinking about it longer. John opened and closed the drawers of every desk, dresser, armoire, and anything else he could find in all the rooms. He found a laptop under the bed though, so that was promising. He took it to Sherlock, who uncovered nothing except a hidden compartment in the floorboards which held a couple butt plugs.
"Only you three, got it."
"Okay." John smiled and stood up, though he took Sherlock's hands and tugged him up as well. "Come here."
Ella interrupted with a cry.
"We have no idea what we're doing."
"Alright alright, we'll take this back and have the cyber team open it." He turned to the room. "Anderson, you lead the clean up."
Sherlock threw several notes at the driver and jumped out, followed closely by John. No personnel were outside by the cars, so the two of them ran inside and John collided with Sherlock who stopped suddenly just inside the door.
"Is she harmed?"
The ENd.
Sherlock took another sip and scanned the files on monitored locations to find the holes. "Parks, the docks, most small residential areas."
"Yes, but Lestrade has backup and doesn't go gallivanting off on a lead without telling anyone."
"You okay?"
His thoughts were interrupted when the landlord they met earlier walked down the stairs. "Why did you two lie to me if you were working with the police? I would have answered any questions."
Sherlock bent down to give Eleanor a kiss hello then faced Mycroft. "This is why we need better security."
"that's what I thioght?."
Also I just saw Arctic Monkeys last night and they played Arabella which is actually where the name of this fic comes from!
John raised his brows and put his laptop away. "I'm going to pay Mrs. Hudson a visit."
Sherlock scolwed. "That's literally the most disgusting thing I ahve evber hear din my life John.:"
Mycroft cleared his throat to take John out of his thoughts. "You have complete control over his heart. I advise you use that control to avoid breaking it."
Brown was visibly anxious and trying hard not to show it. Which of course, inadvertently made it more obvious. (Unwavering eye contact, leg tapping, nose scratching). Instead of answering, he simply shook his head.
But Sherlock was already waltzing away, so John answered for him. "Mind palace."
Sherlock sighed. "You created it, and you didn't write it down anywhere so you memorized it at some point."
, you git. The murderer."
"Hey." John moved his hands underneath Sherlock's, who let him. With both hands now carding gently through his curls, John said, "We're still going to get him. No one lost here. You're not slow."
"Doesn't matter." He marched to John's closet and grabbed the first suitable outfit he could find. Turning, he threw it towards John, smacking him in the face.
"I'll ask for Evans to email us a list of those not here right now. Do you think our killer will catch on and leave now that his pool of victims is gone?"
Sherlock said, "The moron doesn't have a login password, but somehow managed to encrypt this file."
Inside the room, Sherlock slid a photo of Emmett and another of a baby, to Brown.
"They usually aren't."
"Sherlock."
They couldnt be separated by ant force.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and looked to John for help.
John stood up and caught the terrified look on Sherlock's face. His stomach dropped and he took Sherlock's hand. "No Sherlock you didn't do anything wrong. I only know because I'm a doctor and teach some patient's about SIDS."
I just made up the name Greyson St so don't @ me if one exists and it's not in London.
" the idiot said.
John said, "That sounds a bit far fetched."
Sherlock got his breathing back under control by matching it with the steady, slow blinks of John. He couldn't tell John that he stopped believing he was at fault, but he would try. "Sleep in here tonight."
, we can just go there and slip in between appointments."
"No, not at all. You're my faborite person." Then John puled him closek, cradling his head and lower back then pressed a gentle kiss to his lips.
Sherlock knew she couldn't move around much at this stage to actually play with the toy, so he picked her up and settled her upright in his lap. He placed one hand on her belly to prevent her from falling forward, and the other hand on the bear to snuggle it against her. He didn't feel self-conscious as he noticed the girl's father leaving the room earlier to talk with John in the kitchen.
"Sorry. I'll stick to the couch tonight." John's voice was clipped and embarrassed. He made to stand up and leave the room when a hand grabbed his wrist.
Sherlock was observably attached to the little girl, and more than a bit intrigued by her. He could only hope Sherlock didn't grow too emotionally attached. A voice that sounded suspiciously like Mycroft's whispered the word "Redbeard" in his ear.
John yelped and surged forwards to catch him about the wasite .
John moved closer and spoke again, calmly and softly. "Sherlock, can you take a breath in while I count? In one, two, three, four, five. Out one, two, three, four, five, six, seven." He kept the repetition going and eventually Sherlock must have heard him and tried following along because his breathing grew less rapid and his fists slowly relaxed. They did this for around five minutes before Sherlock abruptly looked panicked and fled to the bathroom.
When John made it back downstairs, the tea was indeed made, and the two of them settled into their respective chairs quietly.
Sherloskc stared at him in awe and then John pushed down his trosuers and pants the rest of the wat and tuggetd his wrists so he'd be pulled in to the shower if he so please.d
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock muttered under his breath and went to go take a quick shower. He normally slept in only his pants, but that probably wasn't proper bed sharing etiquette if said bed sharer has only a platonic relationship with him. He certainly didn't want to misstep in such a precarious situation. (Well, precarious to
"Sherlock."
Why does it take them so
"Your lack of alibi combined with the timing of your departure, and your occupation and relevant access to patient records, gives us more than enough evidence to search your home. If we find something direct, you will be prosecuted for these seven murders and get life in prison. If you cooperate with us, I can make this process go by much quicker. But right now you don't have any options."
"She can't speak anything yet!" John laughed.
"Mycroft."
Sherlock met his gaze but didn't say anything. He didn't want to lie to John (who would see right through it anyway), but he couldn't bring himself to admit that he wasn't okay either.
Lestrade readjusted in his seat by crossing his legs the opposite way. "So you admit to killing all six?"
The walls were slightely lit up to show hearts and flowers and shit. Sherlock and Hohbn oooekd at each other then started making ot. They don't have time for this shit, y=they just wanted an excuse to kiss on a ride.
John's fist clenched around the fabric of Sherlock's shirt. "No, Mycroft is fucked up for making you think this. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that you'll never do something careless like that. Because you will, we're human. There's a possibility that either of us does something like that. The chances of that mistake harming her are very small though. And it's just a possibility parents have to accept, okay? We're more likely to get carried away watching telly and she starts screaming to let us know we forgot her lunch."
Sherlock tutted, "No this won't do, the lock on the door isn't even functional. Pack a bag for Baker Street."
John was relieved as well, though his was written all over his face. "Where is that?"
"OH, so you are a fag."
Sherlock relented to this advice when he let the next person in, someone nonbinary if the they/them pronouns listed on their profile was anything to go by. They were in their early twenties and dressed, not casual, but efficient for that of babysitting. Material that wouldn't pick up stains easily and was comfortable enough to crawl around in after a child who'd just learned mobility. They pulled a file out of a small tote bag and handed it to Sherlock while reaching to shake his hand with their free hand.
Sherlock was in that scarily pliant state he gets when he was too inside his head, following John and not registering where they were going.
"Alright." He steeled himself to begin.
"Mycroft will install a state of the art security system, video surveillance, alarms on the windows and doors, something stronger than a basic lock."
Thankfully, she was sleepy from the bottle and went straight to sleep. John thanked whoever was out there and climbed back into bed on top of the covers. He was too tired for much more than that. He fell asleep quickly to the sound of his flatmate breathing deeply.
Sherlock slammed a fist down on the table and levelled his face with the man. "Stop it just stop lying. We don't have time for this. Your partner just killed the next person on the list, the one single father with a baby remember?"
I tried doing research on England's court system and was thoroughly confused so don't look to closely at the details for accuracy. Also that whole bit at the end with John confronting Sherlock was going to be in the next chapter, but I felt too mean making people wait a week for more Sherlock/John soft angst!
"-send everyone back into protective custody immediately and have an ambulance sent to Emmett's address."
This time he grunted. "Oi, do you want me to come or not?"
His silence was answer enough.
The boys meet their client and make more progress on the case.
Sherlock envied their client for getting to stay in John's bed, but comforted himself in the fact that Emmett probably didn't care how John's scent lingered behind and would be the perfect opportunity to catalogue it uninterrupted. His next thought however, was realizing that this was the perfect opportunity for John to sleep in
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. "She proved to be a good research subject, that's all."
"What I mwnat was, you solvin gcases makes me aroused."
Right. "I may have forgotten. But John, I'm not going to stay here and ignore the case just because you're unnecessarily worried. I don't think you've thought this through."
Inside the room, Lestrade placed each file folder on the table spread out, so all seven could be seen. He opened each and placed photos of each victim on top. He stood with his hands on the table and leaned forward a bit to tower over the killer, giving off an air of authority and aggression.
Once Ella's needs were met, John went back to sleep with her while Sherlock stayed up doing God knows what to work off his impatient energy. John wondered if maybe not all of Sherlock's frustration was caused by being unable to confront the killer, and was perhaps also partially caused by the sudden imminent departure of Eleanor.
TW for brief mention of SIDS and infant death in conversation. I can put stars before and after this part if anyone needs to skip it, just dm me on twitter @221gaykerstreet.
So lkitu holds them there while sHerlock and John go abck to teh lab and compare the sizes. Sherlock says "AH-HAH" out loud and they go back to the suspects.
Sherlock and Joihn went off to Sussex to go to a county fiar. Sherlock's parents had tickets and had to conacel, s they gave them to Sherlock instead.
"Well?"
It only took a minute for Lestrade to escort the killer into the adjoining room. The man looked as unassuming as he had when John spoke to him the day of the search warrant, dressed in a cardigan and loafers with no sense of urgency about him.
Sherlock stood on the couch while John stood in a socially acceptable way, behind the coffee table.
John smiled and Sherlock said, "Just business as usual, don't let sentiment get the best of you."
Once inside the unntyle. everyheitn was black and ark. I've never been inside onw so i have noidea how they look.
"I'm Sherlock Holmes, and this is my partner Dr. John Watson. We're investigating the murders of several people who are former patients of this center."
~~~~~
smile in return.
The verse "My days end best when this sunset gets itself
"Hmm? Oh, the milk." He'd completely forgotten, stuck as he was in his thoughts.
in that sense. But John thought maybe running a bath would be a platonically acceptable alternative.
Sherlock hailed a new cab and furiously texted Mycroft once they sat inside.
John chuckled, "You talk to me when I'm not here, so it's quite possible that's the result you favor."
John stood back up and took Sherlock's hand to pull him all the way up. Sherlock still looked confused. John rolled his eyes and took Sherlock's coat then led him to the bathroom by a hand on the small of his back.
"No, I was just going down a list someone gave us. Even Anderson could do it." Oh how he desired to flip his hand over and interlace his fingers between John's. Did he have any idea what this did to him? Did he even realize how long they'd been touching?
that.
John suggested sectioning the interrogations into covering those who were scheduled to work at the center today versus those who were scheduled on other days. They made it through several staff members, some being discredited immediately by being on maternity leave or out of the country during the time of the murders. To John, they made progress. To Sherlock, they didn't make nearly enough progress.
Sherlock rubbed his hands down the suit jacket, making sure it was straightened properly, and reentered the living room. John was sitting up on the couch and rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
"You called her Ella."
Jon replid, “I don’t kneo w why you say that after every time we have sex.”
After a couple more, the anxiety that Sherlock was going to leave again had mostly dissipated. Thanks in part to him promising that he would always involve John if people were threatened again, but also in part to Sherlock confessing that he realized while he had been away that they are much stronger together than they ever could be apart. And perhaps the whole fall could have been avoided had he involved John in his plans from the second Moriarty was released from prison.
"I best go downstairs now or I'll miss my soaps."
And now she would be handed off to some parents who may or may not be good people. Most people weren't to be trusted in his experience. The thought of Eleanor going off to some random people filled his gut with nausea.
Sherlock didn't see the other messages as he had already set his phone on do not disturb and tossed it across the room onto the couch. "You should probably inform your followers that we're on a 'vacation' for the next two weeks. That should be enough time to find a suitable babysitter."
"With heroin. A high enough dose to be lethal, and there appears to be some amount of effort to make it look self-induced. Clearly the murderer isn't very bright as he didn't make sure someone left handed used their left hand to inject themselves. The edge of the palm has ink smears, obviously from writing, probably notes at university. He used to be an addict, but hasn't used in some time. He must have left school during the worst of it and re-enrolled recently now that he's clean."
John groaned.
"What about when she needs her own room? There's only two in this flat."
"Obviously."
Dawning panic took over Sherlock's face and made John's heart drop into his stomach.
John cut in, "Nah, that's just the entitlement."
"Sherlock."
OH Ymg od why did i choose th ebees underweart they’re forever tarnished.
That night, when they went their separate ways to bed for the first time since the case started, there was a lingering moment in which they both stared at each other after uttering "goodnight."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have, just accept the apology."
"Oh, silly me." Sherlock chuckled. "He was my counselor at the center and I wanted to surprise him." Here, he placed his other hand on John's bicep. "This is John, my fiancé. Just engaged!" He even bounced a bit on his toes for added affect.
It was bright enough to see inside just from the daylight, so Sherlock immediately started analyzing everything. It was sparsely furnished, with used furniture probably found in thrift stores. The personal touches were minimal, including a few framed paintings and some fiction books on the coffee table. Maybe the man spent most of his time elsewhere, or just hadn't planned on staying here long.
. John knew he was awake. Damn. But he still didn't move? What Sherlock wouldn't give to know what was going on in the man's head.
Sherlock was texting Mycroft about the security details, but still had one ear open for John. "What do you mean?"
Ella's attention was immediately diverted to this and she stared at the object in wonder before grabbing it. She realized that moving it produced the sound, so naturally she started shaking her fist and let out a series of vowels in excitement. She'd never heard this sound before.
Self-edited to the best of my ability, I hope you enjoy!
Ignoring him, Sherlock turned and walked out. John could hear him call out "You've got ten minutes, it's a serial killer."
The victim was a male, late twenties, dressed in cheap but clean clothes. A discarded hypodermic needle lay in his right hand, and the sleeve on his left arm was rolled up, revealing a fresh puncture wound. Gloved hands pulled up the other sleeve, this time revealing many healed over track marks. Sherlock examined both hands closely, as well as the position of the body. He stood up when John came up beside him.
She walked over, brushing her wet hands against her skirt. "You can do the rest, don't be lazy dears."
Mixing random kitchen chemicals didn't help ease his anticipation or any of the many thoughts rocketing around his brain. So Sherlock was relieved when John finally woke up and came into the room with Eleanor wrapped in the plaid blanket.
"Anyway, just letting you know I'm ordering Indian. You're going to eat, so I'm ordering your regular."
"You're my best friend John. And this
There he saw the curly headed boy and some greasy haired, bug eyed frat boy staring at each other. John's crush wa s standing there trying to look indifferent but faililng , and the greasy guy was grinning like he just kicked somone's puppy.
Sherlock and John waited in Lestrade's office for him to come back and give the green light for another interrogation of Brown. During those few hours, John managed to coax a full cup of tea and a few crisps from a bag he got in the vending machine. He felt the success was due more to Sherlock being in another world than it was Sherlock actually conceding to the consumption of food.
Still clutching the bee, Sherlock pulled his phone out of his pocket and dialled Mycroft's number.
John stood quickly, "Everyone is still in danger- Emmett is still- Oh god."
His hand was laying across Sherlock's chest, so he tapped his fingers a few times and puffed out a sigh. "I'm gonna go cook something and bring it back up, yeah?"
Trigger warning for a brief mention of bad therapy geared toward "fixing" autistic symptoms like stimming for example. It doesn't go into detail though.
It wasn't long before John's body sensed his and John threw an arm around the source of heat. John shuffled closer and sighed into Sherlock's neck.
John sighed, "He thought they were wasting the NHS' time and would always turn back to drugs, and wouldn't get jobs, and hurt people."
John frowned, "What if he kills again tonight?"
"There was a bit of drool, sorry."
Of course fantasies are only that and sooner rather than later they arrived at Baker Street, the familiar red awning of Speedy's welcoming them back. Sherlock and John carried Emmett's bags while he held Eleanor, and he was careful not to jostle her as she was mercifully silent the entire ride.
Self-edited to my best ability, I hope you all enjoy!
John informed Emmett and went to remove the night's DIY burglary alarm. He'd already gotten dressed before making breakfast, as some attempt of distancing himself from the way he woke this morning. He woke exactly as he'd constantly imagined, enveloped in Sherlock's warmth. However, it wouldn't do to think Sherlock 'I'm married to my work' Holmes liked it in the same way he did.
Sherlock straightened his suit jacket and walked to the newest filing cabinet. It was dark in color, almost black, and the paint was scratched and dented all around. The tracks on the drawers were rusted and bent slightly out of shape, making it difficult to pull them open. He had to wrench them open.
Mycroft humored him. "Hmm yes."
The boys carry on the investigation.
Sherlock switched the score to be higher, "Yes, actually. Mrs. Hudson here is my landlady and is always allowed, there is also my friend and flatmate John Watson. You will meet him if you're hired."
: Iknw it's not." Sherlock said and stared at him, eyebrows furrowed, ytuiogn to understand what Kohn's intentions were.
Sherlock bit his lip, frustrated. But he knew, however begrudgingly, that Lestrade was right.
He then set the tray on the comforter and sat cross-legged on the bed across from Sherlock. They didn't talk as they ate, there was no need. Sherlock nibbled on the biscuits and John ate his sandwich. John pretended he didn't notice when Sherlock started breaking pieces off and consuming them as well. Maybe, John thought, Sherlock was actually hungry. He would be too if he'd expelled anything left in his stomach from the night before. Regardless, the fact he was making an effort filled John with warmth.
Several times during this process, John made a comment. "Is this really necessary? I don't mind switching off guard duty with you. I was a soldier remember?"
~~~~~
John covered the hand that was still on his arm, with his own. "It's okay
Sherlock was the first to break the silence, "As Mrs. Hudson no doubt informed you, we aren't taking new clients." He glanced up from his phone to give a quick fake smile, then froze, brain processing the data. The man's eyes were puffy and red, a crumpled tissue lay in his hand. Dried spit up stained the shoulder of his shirt, unwashed and wrinkled. The short sleeves on his shirt bared the healed track marks on his arms to Sherlock's flitting gaze. All points of data led Sherlock to one conclusion.
When he passed through the doorway, Sherlock's voice stopped him.
However, the quote from the therapist, in a different context, seemed useful. Like right now, where he couldn't find a way away from the inner turmoil over Ella. Perhaps the only way to move on was to confront the feelings head on.
John shrugged and made to leave, but was stopped with a hand on his shoulder.
SHerlocl rolls his eyes at him and faces the green bitches. "OUt of my entire analysis only one of you had scales large enough to match the ones found on Peaches' body."
Sherlock noted this and asked the rest of his medical questions. Connor moved through them with ease, so it was obvious that they remembered whatever was taught on that subject at university. He moved on to security questions.
"I suppose I should start at the beginning?"
Sherlock burst in to tears immediately and John dried them and shushed him ans the y drifted off into sleep.
He walked over to the cot and said just loud enough to go through, while not waking the baby, "John." He hoped his meaning was clear, and climbed back into bed and faced away from the door.
Afterwards, Mrs. Hudson rose slowly from their spot on the ground. John helped her up, as she groaned from the strain it placed on her hip.
She gave him a kiss before responding, "Oh, you know how siblings are."
When he grew older he understood what the woman was trying to do. She wanted him to act
“Thank you,” he said into John’s ear, before placing a kiss upon his cheek.

Sherlock opened his own box and picked at some of the curry covered chicken. He sighed when he noticed John glaring at him and deliberately put a bite in his mouth, raising his eyebrows to say, "happy?"
Sherlock felt guilty by the time the door shut. There was nothing for it. John would come back when Lestrade texted back new information.
Sherlock gave him a dubious look, "Do you hear yourself speak sometimes?"
He sighed, "Okay. I'm going to make breakfast."
"I was very distractible as a kid," his tone changed. "Out of sight was literally out of mind, which is dangerous."
"What?" John quickly rounded the couch to look at the screen.
. He couldn't get the words out.
John mirrored his position. "I see."
Sherlock was pacing back and forth and muttering to himself in the foyer of Brown's flat building. He wasn't allowed in until the police completed the official search, after all he was only a consultant. But that left him moody and impatient. He'd already checked on Emmett and Eleanor's status at Baker Street, so there literally wasn't anything to do.
Sherlock was already halfway down the hall, "She's not an object John."
Sherlock and JOihn wal k uo and asee Peach layinf on the ground covered in blood. Sherloc deduces that Bowser knocked her the fuck out iwith his thorny vokcock because wounds. Also my friend tod me that as a joke buy /I made it lietral.
John ignored him and just kept whispering the same phrase over and over. "You're okay. You're okay."
Sherlock was tall enough to jump and reach it, pulling it down with his body weight as he landed. He climbed up, and John followed closely behind. He would never make the same mistake as he did during the blind banker case.
Though Sherlock still felt he deserved any ill will, he conceded to John's command to make him happy. "Fine, it's- I accept."
John finally moved into action and picked up Eleanor, rocking her so she would calm down.
~~~~~
"He won't, he's waited at least a couple weeks between killings so far."
did that. He would never have stopped killing."
The door was frosted fflass, but since John was in the shower theres was nothign to see besides the vagues dark shape of clothe ing on the flor.
He may have tripped on the edge of the rug on the way and the others may have hidden their laughs. He wouldn't know, he was busy trying to remove himself from the situation and bury himself in a non existent experiment.
"We're to take clients on a set schedule, that way there is stability even with the use of a babysitter. And we take them on a case by case basis. High profile cases are out the door, too much room for blackmail and psychopathy. I take it you're as keen as I am to never encounter another Moriarty?"
"You're right, it has to be two people."
Sweat began forming by his temples. "I don't know what you're talking about, what files?"
Emmett nodded and began crying despite his best efforts to hold his emotions at bay. The baby in his arms stirred at the shaking, and made distressed whimpers, feeding off its father's emotions. John stood and gently took the baby from his hands, then he turned and passed the bundle over to Sherlock who stared at him like he was being handed a live bomb. John handed their client a box of tissues and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder.
Sherlock didn't feel like replying, he was busy staring at John's hair and thinking about how it would smell if he stood and pushed his face into the crook of his neck. He'd have to settle for inhaling the scent from John's clothes later, once they'd been discarded in the bathroom's hamper. That was probably, most definitely, frowned upon for flatmates to do.
The rest of the day went by slowly, as they had to reestablish a routine with Eleanor. They learned to take advantage of her naps by using them for experimenting (Sherlock) and finishing a blog post (John).
Sherlock shrugged.
"Yes. How could someone as inept as him successfully plan and murder six people over several months and still maintain enough anger to follow through?" Sherlock stole a part of the scone on John's plate and chewed on it while thinking. "That's the least of what I'm confused about. He's a moron. I really doubt he has the intellectual ability to pull this off and I don't mean that as an insult or an exaggeration this time. He's proven this with the laptop, but he's also simultaneously proven himself a capable serial killer?"
‘Right’ he finally said ‘I clearly was wrong. I’m sorry’ he stood up and started to walk away but then turned around and said ‘Please forgive me for what I said. I hope we will stay friends, although I understand it must be awkward now’
“You know I don’t care about things like that”
‘I will drink to that’ Sherlock said holding up his own glass and added ‘here is bumping into someone and falling for them. I love you too, John Watson’
When their mouths touched it felt as if time stood still and everything around them vanished.
‘Have you ever noticed something about Sherlock, I mean has he ever looked at someone… I mean not to deduce them but in a more romantic way’
‘Mycroft, a very thin line…’ Sherlock warned his brother.
“I’m sure.”, Sherlock just said and gestured to the empty chair.
‘No she sleeps through everything’ John smiled.
‘Don’t even mention it John. This will always be your home too’
‘Your breakfast’ Sherlock pointed out but they were already out the door.
They walked along the meadows for a while not talking, each to their own thoughts. The sun made the dewdrops glisten and the crows in the fields were searching for food.
‘I can’t wait’ John smiled.
‘Redbeard’ Mycroft suddenly said.
‘Yes I am too’ Mycroft sighed ‘I am scared John that he is using again’
“I do? What?”
He was a bit shorter than Sherlock was, perhaps a bit older too, not much though. But Sherlock liked his face, he had kind eyes.
‘Well, you know, the look’
“I will see that he does” John said resolute.
‘Of course,’ Sherlock replied.
‘This is the most fun I had in days’ Sherlock said.
John got back on the bed with Rosie and she crawled to Sherlock and climbed on his chest “She…” she said.
‘I know’
‘London? But you need to pay for that, with what?’
‘You know the look, Sherlock. The puppy eye look, the ‘please let me in I’m so sad’ look, which puppies can have when they have to wait outside a store’ Rosie pulled a face to demonstrate her words.
‘No, but apparently you are’ John replied closing the fridge.
‘Happy New Year Sherlock’
‘You know what?’
‘Do you have any idea how hot that is? Of course, you do, you must know. You do it all the time!’ John stood before Sherlock with his hands in the pockets of his jacket against the cold.
Sherlock looked at Mycroft; ‘You hate Christmas as much as I do’, he said.
‘Do you like it in London?’ John asked
‘Gladly’ Sherlock said.
Sherlock stopped again and said; “It’s just that I still have to get used to expressing my feelings for you because I held them in for so long, John. It will get better I promise” He kissed him again, longer this time until he heard voices behind them. At first they were in the distant but now they were coming closer. “John, we have to go, now” Sherlock whispered.
“She…” Rosie said.
Sherlock laughed and Rosie started to laugh with him.
“Sherlock, staying busy is good for you”
“Yes well, I always knew it would come in handy” John answered.
‘Here are your keys and I’ll be downstairs if you need me’ Mrs Hudson said waving and she closed the door behind her.
“Can I go in now?” Greg asked.
‘Right, yes, of course’ John opened the door ‘Mary isn’t home right now but she will be shortly. Can I get you a cup of tea?’
They got startled and John got up to open the door. It was Mrs Hudson with a package.
“Dr Watson, a moment please.”, Mycroft said in a demanding tone.
John’s day at work didn’t go as quick as he wanted to. He was tempted to text Sherlock several times but didn’t. Sherlock would be busy anyway, he thought.
Sherlock didn’t reply to that, he just put his hand on his brothers and held it for a little while. His eyes were getting heavy, he was so tired.
John nodded, he knew all too well. He had been there, done that. No more he had said after he had gotten married to Mary. Even when he saw Sherlock on the plane, it shocked him. He wanted to distance himself from it, it hurt too much. But if Sherlock was out there somewhere…
‘What’s that?’ Sherlock asked.
‘Where is Sherlock?’ John asked with a hoarse voice.
‘Have you seen Sherlock lately?’ Mycroft asked ‘or talked to him?’
‘I will muddle through for John’s sake. Who will be there?’
‘Hm?’
“No I’m not dead. You were dreaming I was dead?” John looked shocked.
‘I’m sorry to disturb you boys but I just got back in and I found a package that was delivered at the wrong address; it’s for you both’
John was startled by this; not only that Sherlock hadn’t been home for over two weeks but that he was the last one to call. How did this happen? How could they have drifted apart so much?
‘You always say that’
‘I guess so’
‘Yes, John said he’d asked them to come’
‘I heard that’ Mycroft said walking in.
‘Hmm’ he nodded ‘More than okay really. I’m happy I moved back here’
‘Yes, Mrs Watson, he immediately fell asleep’ Sherlock answered.
‘Right that’
‘No surprise parties?’
“Yes Sherlock, sshh, quiet” John put his finger to his mouth.
‘Yeah, sure’ John smiled ‘It’s okay to miss her Sherlock’
“Shall I start dinner then?” John said.
‘But some days my mood can get very dark, like dark weather and I can feel forlorn. On days like that I am hard to deal with’ Sherlock said.
‘Mummy and daddy decided to stay home this year for Christmas and need you to come home. There is going to be a Christmas party with some of mummy and daddy’s friends or daddy’s business partners. I think the Watsons are coming as well’ he said raising an eyebrow, ‘I don’t really know why though’
‘I know’ Johns face looked pale when he thought of it but he also knew there wasn’t another option. ‘Where will you live?’
Sherlock looked at John’s chest. He went over it with his hand. “You had a gunshot wound and you died”
It was a pleasant spring evening which brought more people outside than on every other Tuesday evening.
“Can we walk back through the park?” Sherlock asked “I love the park in spring”
‘Mr Ambassador please have a seat’
‘Oh leave it Mycroft, this is tedious’
They all sat at the table to have breakfast, something which Sherlock could not remember they ever did or at least not in a very long while. His parents seemed always in a hurry to go to work and Mycroft, being older, was either in college or working as well. It seemed a bit awkward for everyone, being together for breakfast for once. The conversation seemed stuck somehow, Mycroft was sitting there with his idiotic grin in between bites or sips of tea and his mother or father were trying to keep the conversation going, whether they liked to or not.
Sherlock leaned over and kissed John. A long kiss where there could be no doubt in John’s mind that Sherlock didn’t love him. Then Sherlock said with a hoarse voice: “I love you John, don’t you ever forget that”
John put his hand on Sherlock’s arm, and felt that electric spark again and giggled. Than he got serious and said; ‘Sherlock, you can trust me. Is it the thing with the flat you are worried about? Because I have thought about it and it sounds like a wonderful idea, that I have something to come back to I mean after I come back from where ever they are sending me. A place I can call home’
“Rosie” he said “Rosie was all grown up”
“Not a big lunch?” SH
“You are insatiable Mr. Watson” Sherlock smirked turning around.
‘In London’
“Of course” Mycroft and Greg left the room.
‘John!’ Sherlock carefully walked over to the ditch and stretched out his arm to reach John’s. He pulled John out of the ditch and to the side of the road. John was all wet and shaking like a leaf.
John came back in and started to unpack the groceries in the kitchen.
Finally Sherlock heard them walking down the stairs and the front door closing. He made himself a cup of tea and picked up his book. This would be a lovely quiet evening in, he thought. Amelia would sleep through the night as she always did. John was worrying for nothing. He sat down with a sigh and started to read.
Sherlock put his coat collar up and wrapped his scarf around his neck.
Sherlock put down his paper and smiled “Hello Watson, how was your day?” he stood up and leaned over to John to give him a kiss “hello John” he said in his low baritone voice that made John shiver.
‘Are you sure? I can stay if you want me to. You can finally tell me what your nightmare is about’
‘So, you have a sister?’ Sherlock asked.
‘Mycroft ate it’
Suddenly they were surrounded by 8 young blokes who were calling them names; ‘Aunties, get the fuck out of here. Fucking piece of shit, stupid queers, just out of the closet are you? Shall we put you back in then? Fucking nellies, out with your bum chum? Trying to bang in the park were you? Well not here you don’t, let’s give some to them boys so they won’t forget!”
‘It’s not that, Sherlock, I know I can but …’
‘It’s a door’ John said.
“What, are you serious?” John was stunned at this sudden enthusiasm.
‘I’ll ask Mrs Hudson to watch Rosie’ John said knowing she would be happy to.
“Yes, I know, I haven’t forgotten that”, Mycroft rolled his eyes.
Sherlock chuckled. He went back to the bedroom to fetch his phone and made a few phone calls.
‘How so?’ John asked.
“It’s Valentine’s Day” John said.
‘Oh come on, I was on vacation. I can have a bit of fun on my own vacation! We took those pictures for the fun of it and forgot to delete them’
The ambassador stamped down the stairs and left followed by Mycroft who apologised for his impolite brother.
‘Happy birthday Sherlock’
Sherlock looked at John “You didn’t think I had it in me did you?”
Suddenly Sherlock came to life. He sat upright and his eyes lit up. He smiled a warm soft smile of recognition. He turned his head to us, nodded and closed his eyes to enjoy the music. After a few minutes he was sleeping peacefully with the faint smile still on his face.
‘I miss Mary’, Sherlock said softly turning his head toward John.
‘Sebastian’, Sherlock said, ‘why the girl of your best friend? The blonde one?’
John looked at Sherlock and cleared his throat; “The case went rather well didn’t it? It took a bit longer than we thought but…”
John stammered ‘I… I really don’t know what to say to that Sherlock’
‘Yes I’m here’
‘Good well how are things with my little brother?’
I should have been there, I could have stopped it’
“Do you really think so?” Mycroft didn’t seem to know what to do with that information.
“I take it you like the watch?” Sherlock grinned.
“I’m sorry” he whispered and held out his arms. Rosie crawled on his lap like she was a child and they both cried together, for the loss of a father and a husband.
Sherlock shook his head which hurt like hell so he stopped and closed his eye (what was wrong with his other eye?).
‘John?’
‘John, I…’ he started.
‘We wouldn’t want to miss it for the world, dear. So very sweet of you to throw Sherlock a birthday party’
he could hear Mycroft say in his head.
‘Oh come on Molly, don’t insult my intelligence’
‘I can’t believe it’ Sherlock whispered ‘I can’t believe it’
“But Mr Holmes, I urge you to do the exercises we gave you here. If not you may have a very long way ahead of you”
‘I’ll be needing that after all this’ John said sitting down in one of the chairs facing the window. ‘We will need to get some groceries before the shops close though, I will go get some after I’ve finished my tea’
Sherlock nodded “Can you give me a moment with John?”
‘Jeez Sherlock give me the damn list!’
‘Yes, coming’ John said while he walked up the stairs panting.
‘Sebastian, do you really want me to?’
‘So I have something to do, it’s so boring here!’
Sherlock looked up ‘Not good?’
‘Yeah, that case from last week, we’re at a dead end, can you both come down to assist?’
‘Are you sure?’ John’s eyes lit up.
Sherlock closed his door with a bang. Idiot Sebastian with his idiotic friends, he thought. He was glad he was rid of them for a few weeks.
He watched Sherlock interact with Rosie as if she was an adult and he smiled. Her first word would probably be ‘Sherlock’ or ‘Obviously’ instead of ‘Daddy’ he thought and he didn’t even mind. Mary would think that was hilarious. He stopped to think for a while; it was the first time in weeks since he lived here that he thought of her, of Mary. He smiled, it was a good sign.
John looked at Sherlock ‘Where did that come from?’ he softly said.
‘What time is it?’ Sherlock asked.
‘How can I help you, Mycroft?’ John stood in the doorway of his home not knowing whether to let him in or not.
“Of course not, what was I thinking!”
‘Of course, it is, dear, I’m away to a New Year’s Eve party but you’re welcome to come!’
‘Yes’ John sighed ‘we all did. Mary knew too you know, she knew we’d end up together if she would be gone one day, she told me once’
They played a game of chess and when they finished (Sherlock won again) there was a knock on the door and Lestrade came in.
“Oh right”
‘Who was the other one?’ John asked.
Sherlock turned around, his face lit up a bit John saw.
