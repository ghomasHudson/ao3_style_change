“You don’t want me to go slow, sweetheart?” Steve taunts, thrusting shallowly.
“Good boy.”
“Of course I do.”
Maushmi sighs. “No, I like
“Have breakfast with us,” Tony says, unable to help the glimmer of excitement that rises in him.
Agent Carter hauls off and punches him in the face. Hodge goes down like a sack of bricks, dropping down in a heap, eyes watering, blood streaming down his face.
Tony nods. “Of course.”
“Can we expand this?” Steve muses aloud.
“So, I went to his apartment, and we talked,
Steve rubs at his back, holds him close, and Tony, well, Tony thinks that he might be able to stitch some of the pieces that his insides are strewn in, just in Steve’s arms alone.
“You’re flushed, but you’re not running a fever,” Steve murmurs. “What’s wrong, baby?”
“I did,” Steve agrees. “I even mourned him, because I think that’s what you want to ask me, but I would never lay that on your head, Tony. My brother did unforgivable things to you. I have no right to ask for your comfort, your understanding, and nor shall I.”
Steve swallows, visibly. “You’re right. You’re right. I should have told you the second that I found out. You deserved to hear it from me, especially since we were–”
Steve and Tony spend the whole seventy-two hours of his heat in his bed, except for a once on the table, which breaks under their weight and the force of Steve’s thrusts, and a few times in the bath.
He tangles his hands in Tony’s and Bucky’s.
Steve cracks a smile. “Sam and Tony.”
Tony looks at Maushmi, who looks so uncertain, so unsure. “Yeah, baby?”
“A disservice?” Tony asks, flatly.
Tony spits in his face and smiles.
“That we’re brother and sister and that we shouldn’t argue,” Maushmi says, sullenly.
Natasha looks relieved, and she nods.
He settles between her legs, lifting one of them up so that he can suck a mark into her calf.
, I can see you,” Toni says, fondly, pressing a swift kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth, and then, to Bucky’s as well.
“Come where?” James asks, confused.
Eshe’s lip curls over her teeth, thoughtfully, gazing at Steve for a moment. She turns to Tony. “Tony, if Steve had told you, when you first met, when you first started to fall in love, that he had been in love with someone else, that he had lost that person without ever having the chance to tell that person, but that he still loved you, that him loving this person had no bearing no how much he loved you, how do you think you would have reacted?”
“Yeah?”
“What?” Steve’s voice is soft, unbearably soft. “All of us? Because your mother said that we all corroborated what you said, Tony.”
“There you go,” he says and gives him the phone back.
Steve’s shoulders slump. “Oh,” he murmurs.
“Well, at the same time that Bucky and Steve asked me to marry them, they also asked whether they could adopt you.”
? What’s going on? What’s
“Tony,” Steve murmurs, climbing onto the bed, his hand closing around Tony’s ankle, dragging him along with a yelp. “Tony, strangely enough, as attractive as you seem to think we are, we think you’re just as attractive.”
Tony looks at Steve. “He just moved me with his hands. He manhandled me,” he says, seething slightly.
“You always did like a good bar fight,” James says, quietly.
Tony smiles at him as best as he can, picks up his bag, and heads out the door.
Tony nods, and a knot forms in his throat, but it’s not painful, not aching, not like what it was before Eshe delivered her explanation – he feels more content now, content that he has confirmation that he

“He was sorry about it,” Tony feels the need to defend Steve. “And then, I left the room, went to bed, and when I woke up, he was gone. I just figured he went to work, so I came straight here to pick the kids up.”
“What if they need you for something? What if they come down here?” Steve asks, the look in his eyes sharp.
A dozen Nazis spin and look at the mine car.
“I love you too,” Tony replies, with a laugh in his voice, especially when Steve climbs all over him, their legs tangling together, and kisses him until the ache in his chest starts up all over again.
Steve grins, satisfied, and leans back on his heels. “Have to keep things interesting, huh? Can’t have you getting bored with me.”
Steve closes his eyes. “I regret it all. I wish… I wish I’d done better. I wish I’d told you the truth from the moment that I found out.”
Toni’s throat flexed.
Peter and Maushmi are up in bed, their sheets tucked up to their chins, and looking equally miserable.
The door’s locked; he hauls on it in desperation.
Steve’s face crumples into something melancholic in nature. “I’m so sorry, kid. I just… I had to work.”
“Are you okay, Tony?” he asks.
Steve tugs at his hair. “I
“She has a concussion. Sam was pissed, but I explained everything. I think… I
He peers out of the window, seeing Steve down below, waving his hand frantically at Tony.
James puts his hand up, hesitantly.
“No offence, but if you were pinning him as a mark from that night itself, you wouldn’t have jumped into the fray with a broken beer bottle.”
Grant smiles, a mysterious smile that makes Tony’s heart pound in his chest (they are so very similar, his alpha and his brother). Tony opens his mouth to say something, but a quick look over his goodbrother’s shoulder silences him.
The speed and the velocity and the acceleration and the weight of the cement air track underneath them, and the likelihood of fuel staining the ground lighting up when engine of the plane fucks up.
Grant slides his fingers inside Tony’s body, still finding him dry – Tony is determined to never be wet for him; he can only ever be wet for his alpha (that’s a lie; sometimes, he’s wet, and he promises himself that it’s just his body failing him, that there is no sin on his part, that there is no part of him that wants Grant or his violence; it’s just his stupid, pathetic body).
She smooths her hand over his hair.
“I’m going to take a photo too, so that whenever I want, I can look at it and know that this is my fucking cunt; it fucking belongs to me,” Steve growls. “You have a problem with that?”
It’s almost a blow to the face.
Tony collapses against James’ chest, fisting his hand in his shirt, deflating like a tire with a hole in it.
“Would you like to sit?” Tony offers, gesturing to the chairs in front of the roaring fire.
Tony scowls absolute murder. “I am
The door opens, and Phillips enters, along with Senator Brandt and his aides on his heels.
Tony leans forward, slanting his mouth over Steve’s. It’s different to the way that he kissed him before the battle begun – his lips are thinner, his skin softer, and Tony can feel his jawbone and cheekbone against his beard.
“I’m going to sleep in the guest room,” he says, after a moment.
“What the fuck kind of name is Steve?”
“Okay, fine, you want to keep going?”
“So, what are you going to do about it?”
He finally makes it to Sam and Wanda’s house, and he parks outside, climbing out of the car and rushing up the steps to their little cottage of a house. He pushes the door open, the hinge barely hanging on its screws, and the house has been completely ransacked, furniture thrown everywhere, things crashed and broken on the floor.
When they make it to the entrance of the second train tunnel, they struggle to lift the chest into a mine car. Tony has the submachine gun slung over his back, and the chest drops heavily into the bottom of the car. However, the noise attracts the attention of five water-carrying Nazis, who come to see what is going on and reach for their side-arms.
James just stares at Steve. “Who the hell is Bucky?” he demands.
“We can’t go back to the hospital,” he insists. “Not yet.”
Peggy steps forward. “HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It’s led by Dr. Erskine’s first test subject, Johann Schmidt,” she explains.
Steve grabs the remote off the bedside table, flicking the television directly opposite the bed on. “What episode were we on again?”
you or cut off your limbs and your ears and nose and bludgeon you until you were unrecognisable, and they would’ve made me
Wanda’s mouth twists, not a smile but close. “It was touch and go for a while,” she tells him in her soft, scarred voice.
“We do, Peter,” Steve says, his voice grave like he’s swearing a vow. “We love you so much. We already think of you as ours.”
my heart. You fucked me, and then, you left, which tells me that you didn’t love me, that you cared about me, maybe, that you needed my help, sure, and maybe you had no compunction with sleeping with your hacker sidekick, but then, when shit got real, I wasn’t important enough for you to keep with you.”
Tony’s brow furrows. “Did you draw the short straw to pick me up?” he asks, dryly.
is the conversation that we’re having right now,” Tony insists. “Don’t you want to talk about this? About what Loki said?”
There’s a man there, reading a newspaper.
James guides him onto his cock, happy to take control for a few moments, as he feeds his cock into Tony’s mouth, fucking his face, but then, Tony pushes his hips back onto the mattress, keeping him pinned there, as he licks a long, lazy stripe up the underside of his cock. James rocks his hips, sending his cock deeper into Tony’s throat, and Tony’s throat opens around him, convulses around the length, making him throb within the confines of his mouth.
“I will beat the shit out of you,” he calls out, his voice sharp around the edges. “I swear. Now you might as well come out from wherever you’re hiding. I’ve already called the cops.”
“Gone,” Tony says, adamantly. “I sold it all, It was all junk. The junk he wasted his life and my mother’s life and my life on.”
Tony cants his hips up, just as James snaps his hips forward, and the stretch and burn drags the air out of his lungs. He can’t help the frantic roll back against his cock, just as Steve’s hips stutter and snap forward against James’ ass, lacking finesse. Steve keeps going, keeps rutting into James’ body, a savage, desperate, wild look in his pale eyes, and James begs him for more, for
Tony lifts his eyebrow, pointedly.
He feels like a newlywed, like they’re still on their honeymoon, and when Steve pulls back, there’s a certain, smug edge to the way that Steve observes him, like he was trying to prove a point and succeeded.
Tony drags his foot absentmindedly across the carpet. “You did,” he says, woodenly, and he’s having flashbacks to Howard, to how it felt to be Peter and Maushmi’s age and have the sudden realisation that his father doesn’t love him, not really. “You did make them feel like that.”
“Now the lion below, being attracted to the glow of the gem, picked it up and carried it away. As the lion walked away with the gem, Jambavan, the King of the Bears saw him. Being seduced by the glow of the gem, he attacked the lion and killed it and took the gem to his cave and gifted it to his infant son. Prasena did not return to Dwārakā, and so, people were wondering what had happened to him. Satrajit suspected that Krishna might have killed Prasena in order to attain the gem. Krishna, in order to prove his innocence, gathered a search party, and went into the forest.”
This is the first time that Tony has felt whole, whole with Steve, because it’s been hard,
Realisation dawns. “You’re dating Toni?” he says, his voice rough.
“Is it because I haven’t been around the block like you have? Is it because you want someone who has more experience? I can’t help the fact that you’re the only one that I’ve been with, Tony. I can’t help that you started having sex when you were fourteen and had a five year head-start on me. Is it because I’m not kinky enough? Is it because I’m not listening to you in bed? Is it because I’m boring, that I’m not satisfying your fetishes? Is it because you don’t find me attractive anymore? Have I outlived my usefulness, Tony? Has the novelty worn off now? Is it because you’re stressed at work? Is it because I don’t get your motor running enough before we have sex?”
Steve’s eyes fly up to him. “That’s not you at all,” he insists, his voice careful and weighty.
“You don’t want to know,” he drawls. His eyes settle on Tony’s hole, tilting his head. “You look like something I should have paid for.”
again?”
“There are cameras all around us. We just have to know where to look,” Tony murmurs.
“Yeah, I slapped you,” Tony snaps, switching to English with a quick snap, his gut churning. “You think women hit like that because it feels like fucking cotton candy?”
“Is it an extra-special weekend?” Peter asks, hopefully.
“No, we know, thanks to your own testimonies that she was locked in a room with another girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag,” Coulson snaps.
Steve flinches, but he recovers well. “That’s fair,” he says, with a nod of his head. “I just… you deserve an explanation. I didn’t get a chance to explain in Siberia. It wasn’t exactly… the moment to explain.”
“Why do you need pictures? He’s right there.”
“How’s that?” Steve pants.
“I… I guess I wanted to try a different bed,” he offers, helpless, schooling his face into an appropriately light expression.
“I think so,” Steve agrees, without flinching, without taking it badly at all. “I think we definitely need… some intervention here.”
Tony grins to the empty room. “Because I have a surprise for you.”
“Okay,” he says, blowing out a breath between his teeth. “Yeah.”
“No, that’s okay,” Steve replies, absently. “I’m pretty starving. We might as well just get a main.”
“Tony,” someone whispers, a sad, thin pleading.
“Tony,” Tony says. “My husband, Steve.”
Stane doesn’t appear behind him to stab him in the back.
To be fair, there is Steve, ahead of them, struggling to do a push-up.
Peter swallows. “Can you check under the beds?”
“I can feel you everywhere,” Toni moans, the tendon in her throat taut against her dark skin as she tips her head back.
“Tony,” James begins.
“You can’t be here,” he stammers, laughing nervously. “You can’t. This isn’t… My kids are right inside.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Tony huffs.
“Daddy! Appa!” Peter scolds, standing up, hands planted on his hips.
You have to take care of them, he told himself, even as they all died around him.
Tony’s relief is instantaneous.
“Please, get back in your car. It will be sorted shortly,” the crossing guard says, sternly.
Tony pauses. “Just to clarify, when you say that your mother threatened to remove the use of his tongue, she meant just making sure he couldn’t speak, right? Not actually cutting out his tongue or anything? Because while I’m all on board for extensive punishment, I also don’t support human rights abuses.”
James snorts. “Of course.”
. But my parents know something.”
“Do we really have to fight about this right now?” James asks, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Because the two of you are giving me a headache, and we need to keep watching if we’re ever going to find the kids?”
Eshe shakes her head. “It’s not about you fucking up,” she says, firmly. “It’s about what you do from now on. Your kids are young. They’ll grow from this, and you have the opportunity to change things, to make yourself look much, much better in their eyes.” She pauses. “Might I suggest you take some leave from SHIELD, spend some time with your family, the four of you, get to know each other again. Go on a holiday, play board games, watch movies, build memories, find your comfort zone, the four of you. You don’t know how much it will help.”
“He’d… there was surveillance footage,” Maushmi says, carefully. “Your testimony. Virgil spoke to you, and it all came out. And well, the kids,” she looks at Steve, “all of you, you’d seen things, nothing awful, but enough to put a picture together.”
“For months, I helped you.
Miss Lewis is surprised when she opens the door and sees him on the other side.
Tony clears his throat. “The hat, though.”
“That’s great; we’ll take it,” Tony replies, easily, with an old, snug smile plastered across his face.
Natasha seems taken aback by his anger. “I-”
James reaches for him. “You deserve better,” he says, solemn as the grave, as he tangles his fingers with Tony’s.
“That’s the guy.”
that tight little cunt of yours, not inside it,” Steve muses. “I’m going to keep fucking you, and when I’m ready to come, I’m going to pull out, and you’re going to spread yourself for me, show me that fucking greedy hole of yours, and I’m going to cover you in my come. And then, you’re going to keep spreading it for me, so I can look at you as much as I like. How does that sound, baby? You like that idea?”
“Excuse me?” Lord Steven replies, his brow furrowed, the question clear in his voice.
There is silence.
Steve’s jaw clenches hard, because he’s thinking about all the fairs that he and Tony went to, how that’s no longer
“I must say, that was irresponsible of you, sir,” Jarvis says in that soft, disappointed voice that never fails to make him feel like a piece of shit, unlike his parents, even if he knows that he’s in the right this time around.
“It is the Syamantaka gem, if it is there, in Dwārakā, it is not something man was meant to disturb. God made sure that it would not be touched when Dwārakā was submerged. Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth.”
“Not always.” Steve’s voice is grim.
Tony spends that entire night not sleeping and pacing, because he thinks that all it takes is one phone-call, one accusation that a monogamous, polyamorous relationship means that he and Steve are unfit parents for CPS to show up on their doorstep and take the kids away.
“Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma,” Dr. Banner explains. “Don't worry, they go away.”
Is this it? Is this where she tells him that she’s sleeping with his husband and that they’re planning on running away together so he should get used to the idea of being used-up and alone and a single parent for the rest of his life?
“Yeah, of course,” Tony says, cheerfully, walking over to her.
The man lifts an eyebrow and clucks his tongue. “Such a change in attitude.”
When Steve sees him, he drops his bag by the door, as he always does, and moves over to Tony, loping like a wolf, with all that grace and strength, and seizes him up in an embrace, kissing him swift and deep and hard, the sort of kiss that sucks the air right out of his lungs, makes him want to tangle his hands in Steve’s hair and purr like a kitten, let him stroke his hands all over Tony’s body like he’s coming.
And just like that, the fire dies in Tony.
Tony’s smile grows.
“And Natasha? What is she? I’m thinking that she’s not just a fucking receptionist, right? And James told me, he told me that a redhead was following him. That was her, wasn’t it?”
“According to Shakespeare, there was something operating in nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that was rotten–a canker, as he put it.”
Steve gives him a weak smile. “As I’ll ever be.”
Tony bites his lip. “Yes,” he says, helplessly.
James shouts and lurches up, and his hand flies to Tony’s hair. He tightens it against the scalp and mutters out a strangled apology, ready to draw it away, when Tony reaches up and keeps his hand there, just as he feels the hand loosening its grip.
Tony blinks, not quite processing what she’s just said. “I’m sorry, did you just say that my husband picked the kids up?”
Halfway down the aisle, the power shuts off. The whole pharmacy plunges into darkness.
“Those are bold words coming from someone who isn’t capable of making that car stay in the air on his own and has to rely on his omega son to do his work for
“Maybe you should let me drive then,” Tony offers.
Tony lifts an eyebrow. “You’re happy that I enjoyed them?” he quotes, slightly derisively. “Rogers… come on, can you please not bullshit me? I think we’ve both had enough of the bullshit by now.”
“I don’t want it,” Tony whispers, and then, with a surge of courage, he picks up a penknife that he sees on the table against the wall, brandishing it like a sword. “I don’t want you. I want Steve, and he’s the only alpha that I’ll ever want. I didn’t want
Tony shrugs, not willing to put voice to words.
Tony falls off the chair, climbs into his lap, and slides his tongue into Steve’s mouth, tangling it with his.
the answer that comes to mind, but he doesn’t dare voice it.
them; they were the first people he loved, after all, after Jarvis, the ones who had no blood ties to him but still stood at his side.
that with me right now. I was fucking worried about you, okay,” Steve growls. “You weren’t here; JARVIS didn’t know where you were. You might have… you might have had an accident or ended up in hospital or something terrible might have happened to you, and I wouldn’t have known, so, yeah, I was freaking the fuck out. You don’t get to stand there and pretend like I’m overreacting.”
“Do you know what you look like?” Steve asks him, his voice no higher than a growl.
Tony is wiping down a puddle of whiskey when, in a corner near the fireplace, a glass shattering against the ground alerts him to a fight breaking out between two drunk soldiers, or rather, two drunk shadows in the low light.
for SHIELD.”
Steve looks at him, understanding. “HYDRA?”
Tony glowers at him. “Shut the fuck up,” he mutters.
“He loves me,” Tony repeats, insistently.
But the problem is, and it’s the worst problem for someone in his situation, that he loves Steve.
“Pass me that,” Steve murmurs, taking the condom from him. “Let me do it.”
And just like he thought would happen, Steve’s face curdles at the mere mention of his name.
“Is it about the new ring that you’re wearing?” Peter asks, guilelessly.
Steve shakes his head. “No, no, Tony,” he says, sternly.
Tony pauses, his hand over the dial, because that’s Steve’s voice, coming from inside the chamber.
“If this is some bondage fantasy, I’m not here for it,” Tony hisses.
He doesn’t put himself out there the way that other omegas,
Lord Steven is at the head of his party, and he brings his horse to a stop, a great, heavy courser, almost as large as a destrier but looking much swifter. Lord Steven jumps down, briskly, feet landing in the dirt, and he sweeps his hand down the side of the horse, soothing it as it rears up in bad temper.
“Steve, wait,” Eshe’s voice is quiet but it’s firm enough that Steve does as she tells him to do. “I want Tony to talk. Is there any reason why you feel that way, Tony?”
“And that was the reason that you weren’t interested in this relationship anymore, this too-boring family that we’d made, right?” Tony asks, the rage a fire in his throat, leaving his mouth dry as sawdust. “And maybe you still are, but the reason why you were gone so long isn’t just because you were bending her over the fucking table, was it? I mean, I’m sure that played a part in whatever the fuck you were doing, but those late night, those weren’t just late nights, were they? They were late nights for SHIELD?”
Tony steps away from his table, making his way over to an unattended part of the café, all the while his phone vibrating in his hand, and he answers it, putting the cool screen to his ear.
Tony is hot, hot all over, and when he stretches, there’s pain but a good pain, a pain that tells him that he’s been ridden hard and put away wet. He can’t bring himself to be unhappy at that. He touches the bruises on his thigh, the imprint of teeth on his shoulder and his pectoral, which throb, and he remembers Steve’s hands there, pressing him open, and he shudders, slicking the sheets underneath them. There’s come staining his belly and his thighs, where he hadn’t cleaned up, and Steve is asleep beside him, snoring into the pillow, a muscled arm slung over his waist, fingers absentmindedly dragging back and forth across his hip even in sleep.
Steve takes a step forward, closes the door behind him, so that it’s just him and Tony, with a dead body lying beside them.
God, how had he not realised that they weren’t enough for him? Had he just assumed that Steve loved him as much he loved Steve? Had he thought that no matter what deficiencies may exist in Steve’s feelings, Tony’s feelings would make up for it?
They are not ending over this; he is not losing Steve or James over this; he is not losing his children over this.
“Have you ever thought about the fact that clearly it’s not enough, whatever it is you’re doing to him over there?” Tony asks, casually.
“I don’t want a divorce either.”
“Fuck,” he says, decisively.
He turns around and walks away.
“I have to tell Steve everything,” Tony repeats, wrapping his arms around himself.
“Is that why you went to Bucky?”
Tony rounds on Coulson. “Were you using me as bait?” he asks, livid.
Tony whines when that same hand cracks down on his ass, a sharp sound of impact echoing through the room.
“The fourth one was in Poland, here, not far from the Baltic–”
Tony lifts an eyebrow. “Oh?”
His husband lies to him.
“You slapped me,” Steve says, dazed “Did you just
“And the owner’s kid, real weisenheimer that one, he used to make fun of the fact that you couldn’t see over the top of the counter.” James laughs, a bold, bright sound that makes his entire body shake, that makes Tony’s entire form flood with warmth. “Because of him, you used to put newspapers in your shoes, remember? You were so careful with ‘em, the way you folded ‘em in your shoes to give you that extra lift. But then, it rained the next day, and you had to walk around with soggy shoes for the next two days.”
Pain explodes all over his body, leaving him breathless.
“Oh, so, what, I’ve been imagining the way that you
James nods. “Definitely, but only if you want me to.”
“She’s okay. They just knocked her out with something,” Sam says, his face drawn and thin. “So, uh, they want to keep her here overnight to observe her, just in case she’s got a concussion. She just got to bed.”
“You know,” Steve begins, casually. “Natasha was in charge of monitoring the surveillance devices, but I was the one in the car outside the guy’s apartment. I know exactly how often you went, how long you stayed, and the look on your face when you came out. When I first saw you there,” he shakes his head, “when I first saw you get out of your car and walk up those stairs and go into his apartment, I just about died.”
“Peter drew two?” Tony says, absentmindedly.
“I don’t why this is hurting me so much,” Steve whispers. “I don’t think know why this is so hard. Why is this so hard?”
But while it makes him feel soft and small, swallowed up by Steve’s muscles, today, it turns him cold from the inside-out.
“Hi, Mom.” Pepper pushes the ‘play’ button for the TV. “Yeah, out here at Hope’s.”
Tony’s throat flexes. “I’m worried about this. I think there’s something going wrong, and you know me, Steve, you know that I don’t say shit like that without a reason.”
“Really?” James asks, sceptically. “You, in bar fights?”
When he comes, he comes to the sensation of Steve’s hand cracking down on his ass. He bites down on the muscle of Steve’s shoulder, and his eyes are burning like they’re full of acid. Steve’s hands tighten on his hips to the point of pain, and then, his hips stutter and snap forward, and he’s coming in a warm wash of heat inside Tony that makes him shake and let out a grunt that is soft and long and a release of so much more than just physical pleasure.
“Quill, Star Lord, he was… he was from Earth, half-human or whatever; he found out that Thanos had killed the woman he loved – that was Nebula’s sister, Gamora, and we… we almost had him. Mantis had him under, and Peter and I,” the lump swells fully in the pit of his throat, “Peter and I, we almost had the gauntlet off, and then, Quill realised that the only reason that Thanos came back alone from getting the soul stone was because he killed Gamora. So, he freaked out, attacked Thanos, bashed him over the head with his ray-gun-blaster thingy, and it pulled him out of whatever spell Mantis had him under, and he… he won that fight. He won, and he won because Quill loved someone so much that he couldn’t keep his shit together, and I was pulling him back, because I knew… I knew what that was like. I knew what it was like to lose my shit because I loved someone so much and they were dead and the person that killed them was standing right in front of me, and I… I tried to stop him. It didn’t work. We failed.”
, again, I will hurt you,” he says, softly. “You do whatever the fuck you want when you leave this house, Steve, I don’t care anymore. I don’t… I don’t have the bandwidth to care anymore, but if you bring your whore near me or my kids, it won’t end well for you, I can promise you that. You won’t like what I do at
“Don’t deny it. I mean, yeah, those guys, they knew who I was, but they knew who
“No,” Maushmi says, firmly. “You have no business going to school. I don’t even think you slept last night.”
“How are you, how are you feeling?” Steve asks, braving a step forward beyond the threshold of the room.
Tony rubs at his arm, a red mark showing even through the dark skin.
“We wouldn’t,” Tony says, the words coming out dully.
Tony knows a dismissal when he hears one, and he heads out of the tent, shooting one last look at the alpha on the bed; the scent flares between the two of them, and Tony turns back, his neck hot.
Tony lifts his head, sending him a false, thin-lipped smile. “I believe you.”
The anxiety clamps around his body like a vice, his eyes fluttering shut, and then, he shakes his head, wills the nerves to ebb, and makes his way to the staircase, praying that the stairs won’t crumble under his feet.
He sways forward, keeping a hand on the door frame. “Hi.”
“Was he the…” Tony flounders for words, pointedly, gesturing his head.
“I learned it from her,” Pepper tells them, solemnly. “We had a lesson plan and everything.”
“Perhaps,” Tony agrees – it would be unfair if he doesn’t give Steve that much, “but I didn’t know that until tonight. After all, what alpha would side with their defiled omega over their own sibling. No, it is not done, and I could not be sure. So, I did not say a word to anyone. I was glad for your intervention, though, as unassuming as it was; it gave me some brief respite from Grant’s unwanted attentions.”
“Tony’s reaction, even if it is exactly what you feared, does not give you the excuse you need to make that decision for him,” Eshe says, simply. “It is up to him to react the way that he does, and even if that reaction is not what you want, you don’t get to
“Seltzer.”
“Hey, you taught me how to fight, remember?” Tony points out. “I just used that skill and expertise and technique against those dumb frat boys who were roofying drunk chicks in college bars because they couldn’t get laid with consent.”
He shudders down to his fingers and toes. He stops himself before he goes any further, terrified of even invoking those words, terrified of putting them out into the air, into the universe, something akin to shame and embarrassment twisting in his chest like a living thing.
“I’m going to get that truck. I’ll meet you there, at the university, the square outside the main building. Be ready for me. We’ll leave as soon as I get there.”
“You stupid fucking cunt.” Grant’s free hand tugs at the knot of his robe at his waist. “I was hoping that you would come to me. In fact, when I heard the knock on the door, and I saw you on the other side, I thought you’d come to your senses. I thought you’d realised that we could be good together, but clearly you’re just another bitch who doesn’t know his place.”
that I would say that shit to you?” Steve asks, incredulously.
“Oh, my God,” Tony says, fisting his hands in his hair. “Oh, my God.”
“She was testing me?” he says, his voice flat, gravelly.
Tony removes his clothes, one by one, until he’s standing in their shared cabin in just a loose shirt and his pants, his boots untied and sitting by the door.
Tony imagines it, imagines all the people that have been hurt, killed, brutally murdered by these people, imagines all of the people that
“I do,” Nat knocks her hip against Steve’s.
Tony thinks, venomously.
He slides his hand up the bony spine of the boy, and it fists in the boy’s hair, tugging his hair up.
Shame prickles at the back of his neck, as he realises that, that he’s gotten fat in all this time.
“Yes, Steve. I
“That’s not what you think,” Steve says, quickly.
Steve stares at him, half-horrified, half-furious. “Where is this coming from?” he asks, his voice biting.
Tony notes that he doesn’t hesitate to include James in that list.
“Okay, Appa.”
Tony wonders if that’s just charisma, if that’s just how it is, if his hard work and his hungry, desperate urge to be worth a hundred of the father that Howard Stark was will inevitably amount to nothing in the face of Steve’s charisma.
And so, Tony makes the choice to break it wide open.
Steve winces. “I do,” he says, cautiously, “but that’s something we do talk about with each other. I talk about you and the kids, and she tells me about the people she dates. That’s… I mean, that’s literally the extent of our social conversation. We don’t really delve into… troublesome details.”
“Oh, and why is that?”
“You feel better now?” Steve asks, when they’re done, sweaty and sated, lying on top of his sheets.
“I’m not ready,” Tony murmurs. “Sometimes, despite my best efforts, I look at you, and I see your brother instead.”
side,” he snaps.
Grant mouths at his throat.
“Steve–”
Steve’s eyes darken, and the way that his cock jumps between Tony’s long fingers tells him that Steve definitely likes that thought. Tony plants his feet on the mattress and opens his knees wide. His free hand pats for the table beside him, and inside one of the drawers, he finds a vial of oil that he pulls out with a shout of triumph, dragging it back and forth between Steve’s eyes. He shoves it into Steve’s hand.
He goes lower, forcing himself.
Tony shrugs. “Avalanche. Up there in the Himalayas. He spent his whole life digging. That was all he ever wanted to do. Dragging me all over this goddamned earth. For what?” he says to himself, bitterness leaking through his voice. “And he had to go and take my poor Amma down with him.”
Tony’s throat flexes, and instead of dread, it’s rage that’s opening up in his belly. “Oh?” he says, his voice thin and taut.
The heat rushes up Tony’s body, settling between his legs, and he’s wet, his thighs slick, and Steve exhales, breathing him in deep.
thing.”
Steve glowers at him. “I think I understand pretty well.”
Steve’s hand cups the slope of his hip. “Did you want me to treat you rough, sweetheart?” he rasps, his voice dark and promising.
He finishes his words heavily, folding his hands in his lap.
“Very well.” He pauses. “What am I right about?”
Tony had let himself go, let himself slip into the house husband routine of Jane Fonda video workouts and running after five-year olds as his main exercise regime. His face was thinner with age, cheekbones showing, and he had new bruises under his eyes from the workshop and raising children who are too energetic for their own good, and there are wrinkles around his eyes. His belly is still flat without the definition that it used to have.
? I think it’s
Tony pauses on his way around the bar, his interest piqued. “How much?”
Tony and Steve exchange a look, before Tony turns back to the twins.
The door closes behind her, and he’s alone.
“Does that mean that you want to marry us?” Steve asked, hope shining across his handsome face.
The killer manages to snare him with his other hand, and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.
Tony touches James’ cheek, his chest hurting. “I know you would, but I don’t want you to. I don’t want…” he swallows hard and looks away, letting out a low, shuddering exhale of air that is almost painful. “It’s too late,” he says, almost regretfully.
“Can I come in?” Natasha asks, rocking back on her heels.
Tony ends the call.
Tony reaches out, and his hand covers the back of his neck.
Lord Steven joins him moments later, thrust into the bedchamber as well, with scraps of his clothing hanging off his broad, muscled shoulders and hips.
Tony stares at him, and there’s a shuddering sort of stillness in the air, as he sucks in a deep breath.
Rumlow’s face curdles, and he motions for the Nazis to drag him out.
, because she knows this, and I know this – she and I were meant for each other. She will always come back to me. I know it hurts, man. I know it sucks too, ‘cause you’re willing to do all of this for her, but come on, you didn’t really think that the two of you were going to end up happily ever after.”
“Lube,” Steve says, stretching out a hand.
Toni’s smile widens. “Thank you for saying that, but when I first found out that you were growing inside me, I thought I wouldn’t be a good one. I was so scared, and then, when they put you in my arms for the first time, and you looked at me–”
Steve?” Tony asks, sceptically.
When Tony gets home, the house appears to be empty, dead silent.
“I… I don’t think I’ll ever stop loving you, James,” Tony confesses, with sad, burning eyes, as the shame prickles at the back of his neck. “I loved you when I was a boy, and I… even after all these years, and I haven’t… fuck, I shouldn’t be saying this, I shouldn’t be saying
And then, he slides three fingers inside Tony, still stretched, still dripping with lube, and Tony cries out, almost throwing himself off the bed.
Tony glowers at him. “What is
Peter scowls and sniffs, haughtily, turning his eyes back to the road.
It makes his throat flex, and he looks away before James can see how his face cracks open in agony.
Toni allows herself calm down, and she pinches the bridge of her nose. “Okay, keep going with your explanation,” she says, faultlessly polite.
She’s beautiful, Tony thinks, with a terrible pang in his chest.
Steve tilts his head. “How does it feel?”
The next morning, Steve leaves.
A panel in the machine slides back, revealing a carousel of vials containing the serum, gleaming blue. Abraham and the nurse inject all of the vials into the injectors as part of the machine, and he then nods at one of Tony’s employees, who deploys the injection pads, which bristle with hundreds of tiny needlepoints. They close over Steve, pressing him to the table.
“You are the important thing in our life, okay?” Bucky says, firmly, and Toni feels her lungs constrict in response.
“Come to my house for dinner,” Tony says, suddenly.
“Well, it’s not like you’ve fucked me in
“You don’t have an explanation for that, do you?” Tony says, almost satisfied, if it wasn’t for the dread sinking into his stomach like stone. “You can’t. You can’t possibly justify giving your husband and your
“I wanted to see you before tomorrow,” Tony says, casually, padding over to him.
“Oh,” James says, lamely. “You want to come inside.”
“No, it’s already late. Might as well let them sleep until dinner time,” Steve says, the lines in his face softening when his eyes drag over the twins. “Come on, you can’t be comfortable on that carpet.”
Steve swallows visibly. “So, what’s the problem?”
“I just… I’m scared for you.”
“Mouse? Peter?” he calls out.
, the perfect idiot househusband who cooks for you and cleans for you and takes care of the kids for you and hell, even makes billions of dollars a year, because it was a great cover, right? You were using me this whole time, right? Who the fuck would expect boring, old insurance worker Steve Rogers to be a secret agent in disguise? Now, who’s the fucking beard?”
“No one’s marriage is as perfect as others think,” Wanda says, solemnly, a strained quality to her face.
Steve looks at him, his eyes large, widened in obscene awe. “What?”
Tony shoves him back, shoves him into the chair, and now, he’s faced with two catatonic men who may really fucked him over.
“He can’t be in a relationship with the two of you until he feels the same way about you the way he does about Tony. Otherwise, that’s what’s called a V-shaped polyamorous relationship. And with you having feelings for him, it will create issues, feelings of jealousy and low self-esteem, and create primary and secondary relationships that will confuse things, make it more difficult. Besides, Steve-”
them to happen,” he snaps.
Tony winces when the other nurse rubs antiseptic over the cut.
He’s glad that he didn’t at least pass that onto them.
“I’m sure,” Tony says, patiently, soft.
Toni’s smile widens around her teeth sunk into her lower lip. “That’s good, because I’m definitely a
A frown tugs at the corner of Steve’s mouth, and Tony knows that nothing is resolved, that there is still so much for all of them to talk about, and Tony, Tony knows, despite what Steve may think and say with his words and his eyes, that Natasha Romanoff is a problem, and that to Steve, despite what Bucky Barnes means to him, James is also a problem, the sort of problem that doesn’t go away if you close your eyes to it.
He’s not sure if he’s fooling himself, but if he buries his nose into the pillow, he can still smell Tony’s cologne, and it’s as though he can allow himself to believe that Tony’s just getting ready for bed, brushing his teeth, changing into his night clothes.
Tony has a few of those himself, which is also why he’s a little hesitant to tell Steve exactly what the extent of the conversation was between him and Loki.
. You’re all that I’ve ever wanted.”
He wraps his hand up in a tea towel and grips the pot by the handle (it’s strange, the idea that Tony is an accomplished engineer, a maker of robots and artificial intelligences, and he does metalwork on a daily basis, which requires welding and brazing and soldering and riveting to say just a few of his tasks, but he has an irrational fear of hot things in the kitchen, especially things on the stove or in the oven), and throws the contents into the bin, asking JARVIS to remind him to throw it out once he’s done having great sexy times with James and Steve, and he lets the water run in the pot so that he can soak.
Maybe, things can be better between them now, he thinks, hardly daring hope. Maybe Steve is ready to leave Natasha behind, give up whatever it is that she gives him. Maybe all that Natasha was a necessary distraction, something to make him realise what he has at home, that Tony loves him, would do anything for him. Maybe she can be a black mark in their history, known to all but never given life or light. Tony can live with that; he can live with the terrible, awful thought of Steve losing himself in someone who isn’t Tony, as long as he comes home to him and never speaks of her again. Tony can forgive that infidelity, as long as it’s not thrown in his face, used to shame him and humiliate him, as Howard did to Maria all the fucking time.
“My own brother, and I lost track of him. I didn’t know where he was, what he was doing, because I was so concerned about getting myself a good life, a life where I didn’t have to struggle or fight for what I needed. And then, I got the call, one night, in the middle of the night, from one of his friends. I was sleeping, and the call woke me up. They tried three times, because I hung up the first two, thinking it was just some scammer, because I didn’t recognise the number. And then, I finally picked up, and this stranger was telling me how my brother had checked him into hospital because he was having stomach pains. He went in for an angiogram, and he never woke up. They had him on life support.”
“Who’s fighting to keep you safe at home?” Steve calls.
He emerges out of the bathroom in his night clothes, nothing similar to what he’d been wearing the night before. Jarvis follows, as he plods obediently through the wing to his bedroom.
to be sure–”
“So, I can kiss James again.”
Tony blinks hard, his eyes damp. “You should have told me this back then,” he says, quietly. “You should have told me this before we had sex, James, actually before you left, so I would’ve known, so I wouldn’t have driven myself crazy and insecure over why you left and what I did wrong to make you leave and overanalysing every single interaction between you and me, whether I’d forced you into something, whether it’d just been an one-night stand-”
“I know, I just…” Tony closes his eyes. “You’re my friend, one of my closest friends; hell, you… I drop my kids off here constantly, and I didn’t have the presence of mind to find out what was going on in
when I got home, that’s it. I was
“So, she’s content with being your mistress? Not very ambitious, is she? And not very smart; after all, we never got a pre-nup. If you divorce me, you get half of everything; you could keep her
true, right?” Sam says, slowly.
The pieces of paper scratch against his thighs, but he doesn’t bring them up.
Tony doesn’t move to run or scream, even as he hears several people passing by them on the nearby sidewalk.
It’s changed in the last few months, maybe even years.
James snorts. “That’s what you think.”
Dust is billowing out of the mine tunnel at a rapid rate, choking up the air, and then, the clouds turn grey, matted, swollen and thick, the heat-haze fading almost rapidly, as if a switch had been turned on.
He looks over to find Maushmi standing in the doorway of the kitchen, rubbing at her eyes.
Tony blinks and surveys each of the recruits.
“My apologies, Tony,” he drawls. “I did not expect to see you here at this time; otherwise, I would have… relocated for my liaisons.”
Tony sniffs. “Wow, diamonds look good on me, don’t they?”
so? So, does that mean if Steve and Bucky adopted me, they would be my daddies too?”
“I’ll explain everything, I promise,” Tony says, in a low, rushed voice. “Uh, Wanda already knows some of this. I told her before I left earlier today. So, basically, a long time ago, when I was a kid, I met a man… he, he was complicated, I guess. He was an assassin. They called him the Winter Soldier.”
“You like that?” Steve says, amazed, and he reaches out, smoothing his hand up the inside of Tony’s thigh. “You like it when I say that I should have paid for you?”
“Minus the decade of misunderstandings and separation,” Toni said, dryly.
The twins cheer and rush back inside, and Wanda laughs, her clear, bell-like laugh, rubbing her hand over their heads fondly, as they run past her.
James ignores her and kneels in front of both of them, drawing them into a tight embrace that makes them squeal.
Tony opens the bottle before the small man, who watches him intently.
“You can’t seriously be expecting me to allow you to do this,” Howard says, crossly.
So, Tony does the only reasonable thing in the circumstances.
It should sting him, the condescension, the idea that Steve thinks he can be treated like the kids, he can be cajoled to some realisation about his own mental health.
He even climbs up to the ledge one night, deep in his cups, and sways, before the drop between the window and the ground frightens him and he retreats back to his bed.
It is very much like the real one, except that the colours are off, brighter, and the furnishings look much newer.
.” Maushmi even has the audacity to wag her finger.
“I… I didn’t deal with Pietro’s death very well,” Wanda says, honestly. “I was angry and erratic and there were days when I didn’t want to get out of bed, that I wanted to crawl into bed and never wake up again. Sometimes, I thought I should have died,” she confesses and almost seems surprised by her confession. She shakes her head. “I loved him, and he loved me, and we came into this world together, you know? It didn’t seem right, it didn’t
Tony takes a deep breath, ignoring the stinging, biting shame that prickles at the back of his neck. “I could get out those red panties that you love so much, or that schoolgirl skirt?”
So, he’ll keep going.
“I remember.” Steve’s voice is low, as he bites his lip.
Tony rocks back on his heels. “Colonel, Rogers is only on loan to the USO,” he points out. “Officially, he is still SSR.”
He looks at the clock.
Tony parks outside the hospital, waiting for Steve to disappear through the double doors, a baseball hat hiding his face from view. He waits a minute, and then, two, and then, drives off in the direction of his house.
“She… her name is Natasha,” Tony tells him, with a certain cracked quality to his voice. “Natasha Romanoff-”
“The redhead?” Tony clarifies.
“That’s not exactly the best attitude to have,” Tony points out.
“It is.”
“Fuck, fuck,” Steve curses, breathlessly, and he’s pulling out of him, fisting his cock with a damp, loud sound that makes goosebumps flush all over his body. “Come on, baby, spread yourself.”
in a better place, we can love James just as much, but I am
“You should put it on your to-do list.” Tony pauses. “I went back home.”

Steve’s fingers work their way between his legs, and Tony exhales, when a finger slides inside Tony’s body, stretching him dry.
Tony clears his throat. “I’m sorry,” he says, quietly.
“Appa, I’m hungry,” she whines.
“Because I want you to be happy,” he says, fervently.
“I had to. I didn’t have anyone to protect me.”
Steve stares at him for a moment, unable to process exactly what he is saying, and then, his expression twists up in agony. He rubs his broad palm over his face, and his throat flexes.
“What could they possibly find in Dwārakā?” Tony says, confused. “Is this like when they stole the
“I guess,” Peter says, scrunching up his face. “But can I have with chocolate milk instead of normal milk?” he asks, hopefully.
Steve hums his agreement. “This is Bucky,” he says, gesturing to James.
For love and lust, perhaps honour and duty is the price to be paid; to have an alpha like Steve Rogers, like Captain America, perhaps that is the omega he needs to be.
Steve rolls his eyes and kisses him again, gentle and lingering this time. His fingers grasp and pull at the thin shirt that Tony is wearing, until Tony is raising his arms above his head so that Steve can remove it. Steve’s mouth travels down, finds the spot where his pulse throbs fast and wild, and mouths at the warm skin there, his knuckles dragging back and forth along the length of his arm.
Steve stomachs the accusations, the shame that lands at his doorstep with a stoic face, never letting an inch of emotion slip.
Their eyes widen with fright – wow, he’s going to hell for deliberately frightening children, isn’t he?
“The second that the ambulance comes over here, the police will too. We’ll never find the kids if we do.”
“Tony,” Wanda groans.
“Okay, put me through.”
Tony plasters a faux smile on his face. “Hi, Wanda. Thanks for taking care of the kids last night. I just came to take them off your hands.”
“You exist separately to me.”
“Yeah, I can imagine you just about died with humiliation. Were any of your SHIELD pals around when you saw me? I can imagine the shit they said to you. Were they appalled at your abysmal attempt to control your husband? Did you have to bluster and pretend like you knew exactly what I was doing the whole time you were away? God forbid if you turned your back on me just for a second, who knows what I might get up to behind your back?”
“It’s okay,” Steve says, fiercely, dragging his hand over his face. “I love Tony; I love Bucky, and I… I know where that conversation was coming from. I’m not… I’m not
Steve laughs and stretches out, draping an arm around her shoulders. “How was your day?”
“You hurt Toni; you hurt the woman I love, and I’m gonna kill you, and I can’t think of anythin’ more reasonable than that. I love her, I love her more than anythin’ else in this fuckin’ world, and I would burn the whole world to the ground if it means protectin’ her. As long as you’re alive, I can’t protect her. You’ll haunt her as long as you’re here, and she deserves better than that. She deserves someone who would kill
Steve seems to realise that he’s said something to upset him, and he doubles-back, the colour brighter in his face. “I’ve… I’ve upset you–”
“You’ve seen it all before,” Tony drawls, goosebumps rushing across his skin. “Both of you. Don’t look so surprised.”
you. You mistook fear and discomfort for lust, but that is on
Steve winces.
Tony settles back onto his feet and gives him a trembling smile, backing away until he can open the door to the driver’s side from behind, his eyes still intent on James, as if he thinks that if he blinks, James will disappear, disappear like he did from that bed that terrible morning all those years ago.
“Fuck off. I don’t care about the traffic laws,” Tony bites out, pushing forward on the gas.
“Oh, my God, shut the fuck up!” Tony lunges for him again.
A snake slithers towards him on that upper level, inches from Steve’s straining face. Steve manages, somehow, to turn his head so that the torch in his mouth can burn it, causing the snake to fall from the pillar.
“You gonna come, baby?” he says, softly. “Come all over my face?”
Oh, God, is this what he’s been reduced to, feeling sour and angry over the fact that his infant children don’t seem to realise that his marriage is crumbling and in fact, cheerfully advocate for his husband who is the cause of all of his problems?
He finds them two cereal bowls and pours a generous dollop of milk in it.
“You okay?” he says, worriedly.
It’s James’ turn to give him the finger.
“I’m fine, I don’t need anyone to stay with me, I’m fine,” he stresses, something like acid churning around in his gut. “I’m fine,
Steve startles, and he smiles, slow, like a honey dripping from a spoon. “You hungry?”
“Of course it does, but we can’t argue–”
The words make Tony’s chest hurt, but he ignores it, shoves it away, and he looks down at Steve’s face. “Where would I go?” he asks, rising and falling down on his cock.
Zola, hand covering his eyes, aims his gun blindly at the scuffle, but Tony pushes one of the guards at him, who fires on impact, killing the guard. Tony swings his fist again, knocking out Zola as well.
“I just…” Steve looks away, staring daggers at the wall, and Tony can see the sheen of tears in his eyes. “Is there any way we can come back from this?” he asks, honestly, his voice soft, unsure. “Is there any way that this can be fixed? Can we start over? Or at least… see if there’s still something that we can salvage between us? I mean, it’s… it’s
–” Tony cuts himself off. He closes his eyes. “I don’t think we should talk about this.”
“Huh,” he says, wrestling with the words to thoroughly describe his surprise. “I was not expecting that. God delivers when you least expect it, I suppose.”
“It’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.”
He feels something warm touch his hand, and he startles, looking over at the couch to find that Steve is holding his hand, fingers threaded through his.
Rumlow sighs. “I cannot control them,” he stresses.
“He’s not leaving, is he?” Peter looks up at James, horrified. “You’re not going anywhere, are you? Don’t go.
, excited look.
“You’re wet,” Steve murmurs, “so wet.”
to see him, Steve. I don’t. I don’t want him to ruin our lives, because that would be unjust. Him, who should have no effect on us at all. It would be unjust.”
“I’m sorry,” is the first thing that Bucky tells him.
The next day, the twins demand that James drops them off at school, and it’s all forgotten.
“Howard loved him, loved him like a brother,
“Lovely,” Steve sighs. “You’re so good for me, Tony. You’re such a good boy.” He leans down and presses his mouth to Tony’s, sliding his tongue inside his mouth. “I think…” he says, thoughtfully, mulling each option over carefully. “I think I’m gonna fuck you.”
“Like you’ve seen me naked.”
Tony looks down, and he sees the fuel staining the pavement underneath the plane, the engines roaring in his ears.
Steve doesn’t love him, and if he needs to keep reminding himself of that fact to stop himself from doing something stupid like abandoning all of his dignity and self-respect if it means getting an inch of feeling from Steve in comparison to all of the love that he bears him in return, he will.
He hesitates for a moment before laying his hand on Tony’s shoulder, worried that Tony might react in fear or anger – after all, it makes sense, considering that he is the spitting image of the men that had raped Tony over and over again.
Steve’s smile tilts upwards into his cheeks, and it makes warmth roll out into the pit of Tony’s stomach.
He goes down like a sack of potatoes.
Steve’s face begins to shine with hope.
“No, Steve, it happens to humans too,” Tony insists. “Or, or, maybe there was something in the water last night, and we all drank it, and we just had… like a communal nightmare experience or something.”
“She beat the shit out of them last night. She was my guardian angel, and I hate saying that because I should be able to take care of myself,” Tony’s lip curls, self-deprecatingly, “but if it wasn’t for her showing up at the right time last night, who knows what would have happened to me?”
James says his name in a way that makes Tony feel two inches tall, like he’s completely and utterly pathetic.
“Someone else was there,” Natasha insists.
“What do you want?” Tony asks, coldly.
“What does she want?” Tony asks, carefully, his voice measured.
“That’s what my bearer thinks that I’m here for,” Tony corrects. “I, on the other hand, couldn’t care less.”
The maids come, Tony hides, and when they leave, he climbs into the bath, which is boiling, steam billowing from the top. It scalds at his skin, burns it, but he finds it somewhat comforting. He sinks down completely, disappearing under the water, and for a brief second, he wonders what would happen if he just didn’t rise to the top; would Natasha pull him up, would she just let hm die? It seems like such a sweet option.
Wanda doesn’t have an answer for that; she doesn’t know how to justify Steve’s neglect over the last few months.
Maushmi clears her throat. “Alright, that’s enough.” Her hand tightens around Tony’s shoulder. “The police have heard enough from these boys. They have gone through something awful tonight. They need rest,” she says, sternly, as if telling Howard that he better be prepared to go to war with the entire Timely police force if it means that Tony and Steve will be allowed to leave the station that night.
Tony turns back, chewing on his lower lip. “Hey,” he says, awkwardly.
He knows what he looks like, mouth full of his cock, as his eyes fly up from James’ pleasure-stricken face to where Steve is watching like a turned-on sentinel from the foot of the bed, and it’s a sight that Steve’s seen a hundred, a thousand times, but never with Tony’s mouth on someone else’s cock.
“It’s entirely possible,” Ms Lewis says, slowly. “But I meant it more in a way that I don’t think you should be too worried at this stage. He’s young; it’s very likely that Peter will get over his shyness, and even if he doesn’t, it might just be his personality in the end. That’s not a bad thing.”
Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees Peggy rush out of the booth and down the stairs.
Tony is immediately delighted. “Really?”
Pepper switches on the television. “See, I’ve got a cousin who lives near the airport, and Mom said it was okay for me to stay over for the night. So, I figure, we replay the airplane noises from a movie while I’m on the phone with her, so she knows that I’m there.”
Coulson glances at Steve, as though he’s the reasonable one.
Steve just smiles, pretending like there isn’t something crumpling in his chest at the heavy weight that his wedding band leaves on his hand.
“Well, I don’t need it, okay. I don’t,” Tony says, fiercely. “I know what I saw, and she was… God, you should have seen the way she was touching him,” he says, his voice barely a whisper. “His collar and his chest, it was like… it was like she was trying to stake her claim. And I hadn’t even
Zola backhands him, splitting open his lip, with a surprising amount of strength for a man that just a little over half Tony’s size
“You… you, she talked with you on the phone, and I would think that you were happy to get out of here, get away from your boring husband and your boring children to
“He hurt you,” James says, with a savage edge to his voice. “What else am I supposed to say?”
is on the tip of his tongue to fling at Steve, but he thinks it would be too unkind, not when Steve is sitting here and acknowledging that he’d been a shitty father and hating himself for it.
Tony smiles. “Who said that I intended to escape from this base? Let me be very clear about something. I will kill us all before I let you or that diseased, genocidal lunatic that you call a leader touch what is in that chest.”
“You ready to go?”
“What’s… where are the kids?” Tony asks, warily.
“Hi…” Tony trails off, her name not springing to mind.
“Tony, of course it’s not because you’ve put on a little weight or that you’ve got wrinkles, both of which, by the way, I hadn’t even noticed until you said it,” Steve says, helpfully.
being thrown around until Rumlow turns a fiery gaze on them.
“Tony,” Steve says, worriedly, padding into the bathroom on bare feet, because he knows that Tony prefers it when people leave their shoes at the front of the house, “honey, what’s wrong?”
“Hey, are you deaf man?” he calls out, stalking out from around the bar. “I said get out, and I meant
“If that’s what you want?” James offers.
The winds are howling, and there’s a demonic looking dog in one of the yards, barking at them. On the street, a long streak of blood runs like a line parallel to the curb.
Steve nods, a jerky motion, and he’s not happy about it, but he understands.
“Come on, let’s go,
“But why? I still don’t understand,” Tony says, running his hand through his hair. “You… you say that you and Steve are friends, good friends, that you love him, and you were hurt that he was keeping his family separate from whatever the fuck he was doing with SHIELD, but
Tony can’t help the smile that curls the edge of his mouth. “Okay, then. Why don’t you two sing with me, huh?”
, but I drift out of their heads just as quick. Plus, uh, even with all of these muscles,” he pokes at his own bicep, “I never stopped thinking myself as the guy who couldn’t go out without a whole host of vaccinations because everyone thought I’d keel over and die. You, you’re different. You’re… so much more, and I think… I think back to that night at the bar, and I wonder… I wonder what made you look at me, made you want me, because all I can think about is that I’m still

His aide hands over a copy of the New York Examiner, the headline of which reading
The recruits scramble up a cargo net, but Steve’s foot gets tangled in the rope, and Hodge climbs over him, laughing, smashing his face. Tony winces, but Steve grimaces and hauls himself up.
“You need to face facts,” James tells him, leaning forward, his eyes sharpening with awareness. “You’re married to a shit guy that uses you as free childcare and a fucking hooker when it suits him.”
And then, he drops.
“And you’re both in love with this man?”
“I’ve always been possessive,” Steve says, stiffly.
“He doesn’t remember, sweetheart. So, I need to be able to show him, to prove that this isn’t just some trick.”
How can he not go and see her, after everything she has done for him?
“James,” Tony whispers. “James, you showed me a universe I didn’t even think was possible; you made me
“He’s five,” Steve says, flatly. “He likes Teenage Mutant Ninja Hurdles.”
Tony’s head sinks again, eyelids drawn down as if held by some enormous weight. By the time his cheek is pressed against the desk, Thor’s voice is muffled in his ear, like they’re underwater.
Tony flinches; Steve looks down at his shoes.
“I suppose we shall have to see,” Tony murmurs.
“I’m sorry,” he says, softly.
. That’s not…” Steve looks away, his jaw clenching down hard. “I love you. I love you so fucking much. And maybe it sucks, maybe it’s really fucking terrible for me to tell you this, but I love you enough to lie to you, just so you’ll be safe and the kids will be safe. I’d do a lot worse to keep you safe and alive, Tony, even if it means you hate me by the end of it. I don’t…” He rubs his hands over his face. “You and the kids, you’re everything to me.”
Natasha cradles his cheek, kisses him on the forehead, and she leaves.
“You’re a penetration virgin.”
tired, but he’s absolutely not tired enough to say no to Steve. His sex drive hasn’t slowed down, even after two children and all these years he and Steve have been married. In a complete role reversal, it’s
Steve clears his throat again, sounding as though there’s something stuck in it. “No, no at all.”
“-you wanted to go and get your kids,” Sam finishes for him, his voice quiet.
“Hey,” Tony says, softly, and lays his hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing tight.
Steve’s mouth lands on Tony’s, swallowing up the moan that rises up in his chest and his throat, his hand curling around the back of Tony’s neck. He kisses him so firmly, so thoroughly like Steve is trying to tear into the seams that keeps Tony’s body together and stitch them together so that they’re one and whole.
“There’s a street sign there,” James murmurs, suddenly, pointing at one corner of the frozen image on the screen.
Tony approaches him. “You need medical attention, soldier?” he asks, softly.
Pepper is busy blushing, and Tony immediately understands what they’re getting at, his face scrunching up.
The kids are at the kitchen counter, wrist deep in raw broccoli, and when they see him, grins brighten up their face, and they’re rushing up to meet him at the same time that he is. He catches them in his arms, presses his mouth to their hair and then, their cheeks in turn, smelling their warm, clean scent.
Pepper’s expression is soft, when she lays a hand on his shoulder. “Of course we are.”
“And Natasha,” Eshe points out. “Even… your suspicions about the Winter Soldier.”
.” James bares his teeth. “I turned my back on HYDRA a long fucking time ago. The only thing I’m interested in right now is burning them to the ground for everything that they’ve taken from me.” He pauses, meaningfully. “And it looks like you’re part of that.”
Oh, wow, now
“We mean
Eshe smiles, sharp at the edges. “Usually, yes, but when my clients are making backward steps, I like to nudge them in the right direction. I think you’re hiding behind the rule, because it explains and excuses your actions without you having ever to do so. I think that rule allowed you to make a decision you wanted to make for Tony, not because you think he’s stupid, but because you wanted to protect him and you thought, even above Tony, you were the only one who was capable of making that decision, making the
“No, no,” Howard says, sternly. “I don’t want to hear it. I know you’re going to say something to try and change my mind, and I’m not having it.”
Tony’s jaw clenches, and he turns around on his feet, smooth, walking away.
“-and I don’t need to hear any more because I already know what’s going to happen next,” James says, thin and taut at the edges.
Obadiah’s going to be dead by the time this night is over.
He shuts his eyes to them.
realise that and you just decided that I was more trouble than I was worth.”
“Tony,” Steve says, carefully.
Steve helps him out of the pharmacy and into the passenger seat of the car.
“It’s five in the afternoon.”
Steve lifts an eyebrow. “I’m sorry. Have you met me?” he asks, dryly.
James shudders, and his cock seems impossibly hard within Tony’s body.
Coulson stares back at him. “We knew that Miss Romanoff would contact either you or Mr. Rogers sooner or later. We wanted to ensure that we got a dangerous person off the streets. Rest assured, your father consented to this.”
He’s in the shower, resting his forehead against the tiles, so drowsy that he can hardly rinse without wanting to fall asleep. His eyes droop, sliding down to the tiled seat that juts out of the wall, resting his elbows on his thighs, his hands in his damp hair.
Steve’s face shadows. “He’s got a point.”
Steve prepares him quickly and deftly, enough to make him gasp and pant and claw at the couch, until Steve’s naked body is settling between his legs, and Tony can reach down between their bodies to fist at his cock, adjusting himself so that the tip of Steve’s cock is nudging at his rim.
Tony closes his eyes. “It has to do with that dangerous thing I was helping him with, so I believe him.”
They come up close to the school, where a number of parents and their children mill about, saying their goodbyes and handing out their kisses liberally.
“I didn’t think alphas did such things to omegas,” he says, breathlessly.
He sees Steve turn around.
“I’m not lying,” Tony says, his voice sliding high, hurt that Steve would even say that.
Eshe even lifts an eyebrow to this effect. “You do realise a lot of these issues that the two of you have had over the last few months may have been solved if you’d just talked to each other.”
them. Are you trying to say that when I put on lingerie and pretended to be a rent boy at your service and you fucked me with a vibrator and filmed me on your phone, what, you were being
The man’s smile fades as quickly as it had ever been there, and there’s a new look in his eyes, one that promises violence. It makes something crumple in Tony’s chest, and he makes his way to the shelf of bottles behind him, reaching high for a bottle of whiskey. Unbeknownst to the others, there is a Baretta hiding in the same alcove, but Tony’s hand only withdraws the whiskey bottle, just as one of the Nazis walks towards him behind the bar.
That’s all it said, so I figured you’d gotten everything you wanted from me and ditched me like day old pizza.”
Tony laughs. “I love you,” he says, full of fondness, “and if you think even for a second that I’d walk away from you, because you look like this, well, you’re a total moron.”
Tony lifts his head and twists it to look over his shoulder, only to find Steve standing there, sweat dampening at various spots all over his front, from his run.
Tony watches the way that she touches him, touches him like she owns him, smoothing down his collar, touching the shade of stubble growing on his jaw, and feels something curl in his belly, hot and mocking and feeling a lot like jealousy.
He doesn’t have any definitive understanding of what this is anymore.
“Not like me,” Steve says, grimly. “There are no men like me, Tony. Just me.”
The kids are at school, and when James knocks on the door, Tony thinks that he waited until they were gone before coming anywhere near the house.
He’s fully aware that they might want this time for themselves, and yes, it hurts, it gnaws at his insecurities, like he thought it would, but he wants the two of them at the end of everything, and if it means setting aside his own self-gratification and his desire to be close to them for one morning, he can do that, he can be brave enough for that.
Steve laughs. “His name is James Buchanan Barnes,” he tells her fondly. “But I called him Bucky.”
“Hey, baby,” Tony says, slyly, as Steve dodges opening the car door and just makes the leap, landing in the passenger seat.
Steve looks at him, his smile growing, showing teeth. “Are you game?”
felt like you were doggin’ her footsteps. No, as long as you’re alive, you’re a threat to her, and who knows when you might decide to go back on your generosity, like using your company to fucking blackmail her into meeting with you today.”
Tony’s throat flexes. “I was looking. I got a few hits on a birth certificate from back in the sixties, but nothing else.”
Peter nods. “You’re like that, uh, you know that thing with the black and white swirl in a circle, Appa.”
Pepper looks as though she is about to protest, and Tony shakes his head. Pepper sucks on her teeth, disapprovingly, with a cold look Lord Steven’s way, before she disappears around the corner.
“Yeah, I did,” Tony says, heavily, annoyance bleeding into his tone. “Until I didn’t. Until you started lying to me and hiding from me and suddenly, there was this hot redhead on your arm that you talked to constantly, and I thought,
“Have you sufficiently proven your point?” Tony asks, slowly, repeating each word with emphasis.
“Do you have to… do you have to use those kinds of words?” Steve asks, wearily. “Weren’t you the one that said that slut-shaming was demeaning to people who exercise their sexuality in a healthy way?”
Tony is taken aback. “Sure,” he says, hesitantly.
“What if the kids see?” Tony demands, only half-taunting.
“First, they are Steve’s kids too, and he’s fully capable of picking the kids up and delivering them to their extra-curricular activities, so you can have some rest or a break,” James tells him, patiently. “And if he were here, he’d be telling you the same thing and you know it.”
“Stop talking,” Tony warns.
Steve swallows hard. “I’m glad you came to the show.” His brow furrows. “Even if I’m not particularly stoked that you saw me like that.”
“No, of course not,” Eshe says, almost immediately, shaking her head. “But your children have the idea that you’re not around, at least in a way that’s significant to them. Steve, I wholeheartedly believe that you love your children, that they are the most important thing to you, but I find with parents, especially fathers, who go out to work – and I’m sorry if it sounds like I think you don’t work, Tony, because of course I appreciate how difficult it must be to take care of the children
The sudden touch to his dick makes Steve startle and drop the book, staring at Tony, over the rim of his spectacles, like he’s a pod person lying in bed with him.
“In the headlines this morning, a local teenage girl was brutally murdered during an all-night party.”
Rhodey is the last, and that makes sense too, because Rhodey had loved Tony first and probably even loved him best, had stood by him through everything and fought with him and protected him and saved him, and maybe years ago, Steve would have been jealous, would have resented the bond that Tony and Rhodey had, but now, he’s just glad that Tony had Rhodey, even when Steve himself wasn’t there.
not-”
“It’s bullshit,” James says, fiercely. “It’s fucking bullshit. They would’ve come for us, for
Steve thinks it over for a moment and says, “No.”
Sam’s brow furrows. “You mean when Steve jumped in when you were getting harassed by those frat boy dicks, and we had to fight our way out of that place?”
“Oh, my babies, I missed you,” he sighs. “Were you good for Uncle Sam and Aunt Wanda?”
, and James came over.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he keens, making a little gasping noise, still shuddering from head to toe, his pulse pounding in his ears.
“So, where is Dwārakā then?” Steve asks, looking between the two of them.
Steve startles, and his empty goblet falls off the table with a clatter. He doesn’t bother to pick it up; he stares at Tony, his eyes wide.
you; that night was the most amazing night of my life. Every night, when I close my eyes, I think of that time I spent with you, Tony. So, you don’t get sit there and pretend like I
“Steve, I always knew what you thought of me,” Tony replies, his voice unbearably soft.
Steve starts laughing properly this time, the sounds wracking his body, and then, as if there was switch that finally turned on inside him. He heaves, his hands shaking atop his thighs.
you. You could’ve stayed, and you didn’t, James. That’s not my fault.”
“What?” Tony asks in a small voice.
Tony makes a soft, desperate noise. “Yes, yes,” he hisses. “I want more.”
“Because you’re having an affair!” Tony shouts. “Because you’re fucking someone else, Steve, and you’re hanging onto this family by a thread, that’s what you’re doing here. Why the fuck would I tell you all of these things? Why would I stand in front of you and point out all of my flaws? Do you really think I need more reasons to feel shit about myself by having you
,” Eshe stresses, “that doesn’t make what you
Suddenly, Steve stops moving, and Tony squirms unthinkingly on his cock.
“Tony, do you even realise how fucking insane that sounds?” Howard demands.
Tony lifts an eyebrow.
Wanda smiles, just a hint of her pearly white teeth. “Don’t think that therapy isn’t a way forward. It might actually help, being able to talk to someone who doesn’t know either of you. It’s worth it, you know, trying to fix your relationship before you take the nuclear option.”
he’ll forgive us one day. Wanda was much more understanding when she woke up. She was more concerned about the kids.”
, you might feel the same way, but I was never sure-”
“We’ll go down that side.”
“I dream about you finding me like this,” Tony tells him. “In our bed, touching myself. I dream about you storming in and finding your husband riding some fake, plastic cock like a slut.”
“Away from the rest of the family?”
Tony drags his hand across his face.
Tony slants a disbelieving glower over her shoulder. “Who do you think you’re talking to?” he demands.
“Will you come to my chambers tonight?” he asks, his voice soft.
When they’re all dead, Tony and Steve hop into the mine car with the chest.
“Since, it is your intention to enter into the covenant of Holy Matrimony, join your right hands, and declare your consent before God and his Church.”
“No, Stevie,” Bucky’s eyes are dark and hollow, “you’re not.”
Tony turns his head into James’ shoulder. “You did great. Thank you.”
be attracted to you?” he demands, gesturing with his hands at Tony’s body.
“I’ll call your mother,” Ms. Hill says, firmly.
Steve doesn’t love him, and that’s just a fact.
Then, Stone has the temerity to laugh.
“Hey, you,” he teases.
Tony’s face contorts with disgust. “This isn’t exactly what I thought you meant.”
, Tony. How could I
Tony’s nails dig into Steve’s shoulder at the sensation, and he lets his head loll forward, breathing sharp.
Steve’s face sets in resolve. “What about the hat? It’s the hat the guy in the boiler room wears, right? I’ve seen him,” he clears his throat, “I’ve seen him wearing it.”
He slides two fingers up inside her, and she moans, her thighs twitching, fucking his come back inside her, before he slips out and licks them dry. He settles back onto the bed, breathing hard, just like he is, ignoring the pain in his ribs, in his sternum.
“You lied about
“It’s not enough,” Steve says, shyly. “Sorry, I should, uh, I might just get something from the vending machine, like a candy bar or a bag of chips or something.”
The bile tastes sour and bitter at the back of his throat.
“You have to know that I’m not going anywhere, not anymore. I’m here for the long haul. I’m staying.
Eshe leans back, gives them both a weighty stare, a stare that makes Tony feel like he’s in school and he needs to shift in his seat, thinking that he’s done something wrong.
“It amazes me how you always seem to have the most perfect speech right on the tip of your tongue.”
Natasha grimaces. “The police were all over my house.” She shudders. “They’ll kill me for sure.”
It’s been almost a year since Steve picked the kids up from school; hell, he didn’t think that Miss Lewis even knew what he looked like, having only met him at orientation.
“Do you mind…” he hesitates. “I know I shouldn’t be asking this, but can you please stay? Just until I come back?”
“Absolutely Everybody?” Tony guesses.
“Shit, shit, shit!” he cries out, banging the heels of his palms against his forehead.
He wants out now.
Steve nuzzles at his throat, his teeth finding Tony’s shoulder, and his fingers prod at Tony’s rim. He slides in with ease, and Tony makes a soft, pleading sound, lifting up onto his knees. The pressure is filling, satisfying, and soothes the cramping in his belly, and Steve slides another finger in, watching Tony’s face with keen interest, his thumb rubbing at his perineum.

Obadiah stares at his bleeding, deformed forearm in horror.
“I don’t need anyone to reward me. All I need is for you to know that you have me on your side. Just tell me the truth, Tony, and everything will be fine. You don’t ever need to hide anything from me in fear of judgment.”
They end up settling for string cheese, and from there, it becomes a competition as to who can peel and eat the quickest.
“Steve, Steve,” is all that she can say, over and over again.
“Where did you go?” Tony asks, softly.
Tony follows, shuffling back into his embrace, shoving the pieces of paper under his thighs.
“I think so too.”
“And you didn’t.”
Steve turns around, his eyes bloodshot, his hands clenched in fists, trembling.
“Steve,” Tony says, desperately, his mouth falling open, red and bruised and slick, his brow damp with sweat. “Steve, don’t
“It’s all I want,” Steve says, passionately.
Steve’s face crumples so quickly and so painfully. “I know, sweetheart, I know,” he says, roughly. “But it’s okay, you’re safe now. Your Appa and I are never going to let anything happen to you.”
Tony reaches back behind him and spreads himself for Steve, showing the rawed, fluttering rim that he’d just been fucking, and Steve groans, coming hard and wet, painting Tony’s hole obscenely with streaks of white, making Tony shake from head to foot at the warm wash of heat between his legs.
“Tony, you would’ve taken fucking scraps from me, and you know it,” James says, his voice practically a taunt.
The recruits whisper, loudly, behind her back, and only the alpha from the fair looks especially pleased.
“Wow,” Tony’s face flushes with colour, “well, thank you for saying that. You made me feel a whole lot better about myself. So… Rhodey told you to stay away from me?” he clarifies.
Steve’s eyes fly towards her. “What? Yes, yes, of course I do!”
Tony nods, dully.
But all he can hear is Steve’s distant snoring, deep enough that Tony knows that he won’t be waking up anytime soon.
Phillips steps forward. “I took a chance on you, Agent Carter. Now that boy, and a lot of other men, are dead, because you had a crush.”
Steve laughs. “Couldn’t have done this before the serum,” he says, a little sheepishly, as he walks them out of the lift, without any struggle at all, as though Tony’s weight is inconsequential.
Ms Lewis looks uneasy. “Look, I do need it for their portfolio, but I can give you a copy. There’s a photocopier in the anteroom. Give me a moment.”
Steve had forced another pill down his throat, one to sober him up rapidly, and when he wakes up next, he’s more alert. He realises quickly that he’s tied up, his hands knotted behind his back, and there’s Steve, sitting opposite him.
He lunges, and Tony shouts in surprise and pulls back, dodging out of the way, as Steve knocks James to the ground with all of that muscle, and both men start rolling around on the floor like a pair of animals, and Tony, Tony is so fucking tired with all of this.
“I didn’t, yeah,” Steve says, quietly.
Sam chuckles.

Wanda sighs when she looks at him, hooks her arm through his. “Come,
“Take off your clothes,” Steve orders.
Tony imagines how Hodge would sound if Tony showed up in his bunk that night and burned him alive in his bed, the laughter shifting into screams.
Tony sits there and watches both Peter and Maushmi, interjecting himself when he thinks they need some assistance. The knives and forks clang against the plate with a dull, heavy sound, and Steve is lost in his own world, thinking about something or another, not quite engaging with the world around him.
“Sex with people?” Steve clarifies.
Tony shrugs. “Not officially.”
, with everything, with Steve and James and fucking Natasha Romanoff and even the kids that he loves with everything in him, and it’s taken everything inside him not to drown himself in a bottle of vodka or take a fucking machete to Steve’s lying, cheating head or cry himself to sleep or drape the covers over his head so he never has to push himself into the world again.
Steve takes Tony’s hand in his, and his free hand flattens against the arc reactor, which is still flickering bravely.
Steve tells her about when he and Natasha were put on the Winter Soldier’s surveillance. He tells her about the day that he was in his car, outside James’ apartment, and watched as Tony drove up and entered the apartment and didn’t come out for hours. He tells her about the primal fear so raw, so intense that it had taken his breath away, how his hand had gone to his gun, ready to intervene and to get Tony away from such a monster, and then, he’d watched as the door opened and Tony reacted like he knew who the Winter Soldier was, that it didn’t bother him, that somehow he knew in his bones that the Winter Soldier, scourge of free nations all over the world, whose kill counts linger somewhere in the thousands, probably the most competent assassin of all time,
Tony turns his scowl on James. “Seriously?”
“Fuck, you feel good,” Steve murmurs.
“Yeah, in the first draft, you were completely scribbled out in a fit of rage,” Tony says, coldly, unwilling to spare Steve’s feelings any longer. “But in the second draft, you did feature, just at the other end of the page, just like Maushmi's.”
“That seems a fair decision to make,” Sam offers.
Maushmi sniffles, equally affected as her brother. “You really promise?”
Her hands slide down his bony chest, and her breasts bounce a little. He can’t help himself, and his hands close around them; he runs his thumb over her dark nipple, a darker shade of brown than her skin, but not too different, and she bites down on her lower lip.
“Sir,” Barnes inclines his head.
Tony nods to himself, almost absentmindedly. “This is all your fault,” he realises, suddenly.
“Why not?” Tony demands.
“That’s not what? Not true?” Steve mocks, and he coughs again, wrapping an arm around his ribs, his fist pressed against his chest, before he lifts his head, his expression momentarily irritated with himself. “At least be honest with me.”
Steve picks up his glass again, drains it dry (funny, he’d never been much of a drinker when Tony had met him; had
Their car looks almost sluggish compared to the pursuing Nazi car as they both make their way into an unusually long straightaway. Tony discards his empty submachine gun as Steve kicks at the throttle and casts a worried look back at Zola, who can see victory kindling right in front of him, smiling with a cruel edge and carefully taking aim.
James’ face cracks wide open in a brilliant smile, showing his pearly-white teeth. “You came,” he says, so rough with emotion.
“–and you killed Thanos,” Tony finishes for him. “Yes, Rhodey told me.”
“Nice shower?”
He makes his way through the corridor to the door. On his way, he finds a heavy candelabra sitting on one of the hall tables, and he wields it like one would a weapon.
“No, I’m glad you did; I’m just saying that your premise is faulty,” Tony growls. “Anyway, back to the happy memories, you dragged me into one of the rooms and asked me not to call the cops because he was going to force himself on that girl, and I agreed. I left the frat party, and you were waiting for me in my apartment, which was no small amounts of creepy.”
Look, honestly, the timeline in this might be fucked. If it is, I'd probably just ignore it.
thing, that
Bucky and Steve had proposed – well, calling it a proposal would be overselling it, frankly, because it happened, while they were fucking, and Bucky’s hands tightened on her hips, a sign if anything that he was about to come, and his mouth was a slack, wet smear against the bare curve of her shoulder, and then, he said it, he said, “let’s get married.”
“They wanted her to let me go. She and my da fought over it a lot. They didn’t want my parents to get attached to me, because they were so sure that I was going to die. After a while, my da started to believe them, because I got sicker and sicker. But I’d always get back up again, and Ma believed in me. Ma believed I was strong. I wonder if we fed each other like that, like it was a vicious circle. I’d get sick, and then, she’d pray, and then, I’d get up again, and it happened like this over and over again.” He looks away. “Maybe it would be better if I’d just died.”
That is a crushing, nauseating weight in his chest – the idea of having to tell Steve the truth, this horrible, awful secret that everyone had kept from him, that he’d forgotten, and to have him turn away in disgust.
Natasha comes to him and asks if he’ll go and put all the infinity stones back where they’re supposed to be, like they had always planned when they embarked on this ruse.
Peter laughs, and then, he pauses. “Do you think MJ will dance with me at the wedding, Amma?”
Tony holds his breath, knowing that there’s something wrong with this picture.
“No, I just…” Tony closes his eyes, willing his pounding heartbeat to slow in his chest, “I want the main spectacle,” he explains, a little embarrassed.
“I know you said that one day, you’d be able to forgive me, and I’m not… I’m not rushing you or anything, because I know you said
“I’m a grown-ass adult, Steve,” Tony reminds him, mouth a flat, unwavering line. “I know when to drink and when not to drink.”
“This is not rent boy sort of treatment,” Tony points out.
“But yeah, I don’t think Steve wants to believe me. And we just… we got into a massive fight about
you-”
“Did you hit her?”
A scream echoes from the speaker, and the fear is bright and sharp in Tony’s chest, as his head snaps up.
“Alphas maybe don’t,” Steve replies, kissing him again, and Tony whines at the taste of his own slick. “But I do. For
Steve’s eyes widen. “Sir–”
“I just want to protect them,” Steve offers, lamely.
“I do, sweetheart, I do,” Steve says, fondly, staring down at him with so much love in his eyes.
Jarvis cracks a smile in the darkness. “It’s just for a few nights. I’m sure I’ll survive.” He purses his lips. “If you need anything, you’ll call, of course?”
Lord Steven and Tony bond, the day after Lord Steve gives his assent to the match.
“I don’t believe you,” Grant tells him, his voice soft. “I think you’re just like all of the other omegas that I know, desperate for a good fuck and not knowing where to get it. I can promise you, my brother sure won’t give it to you. He’s as green as you are, and I know what omegas are like, dear Tony. I know they pretend to be virtuous creatures, but once you get them into bed, they become sluts. You need a firm hand, an alpha who knows what he’s doing. That’s me. I can give you what you really want.”
Steve stares down at the hat, horror etched into his expression. “Where, where did you get this?” he demands, his voice going hoarse.
“Now, Mr. Stark.”
“Will it?” Steve says, disbelievingly.
“If you want to kill Loki, well,
Tony shrugs. “I’ve always had it there.”
“Come on, baby doll,” he says, his Brooklyn accent thick. “You have school tomorrow, don’t you?”
in love with you,” he says, quietly. “That didn’t… those feelings didn’t go away.”
Between Bucky and Steve, they gather up the body on the floor, and Natasha wanders into the side room where Tony is hiding. She remains silent, as she helps him to his feet.
“Do you,” Steve looks uncertain, “I mean, do we need something? To, uh, protect us against–a rubber or–”
“Really,” Natasha sighs and climbs onto the couch, so that she can snuggle up against Pepper’s side.
He fists his hand in Steve’s robe, presses himself against Steve, and then, Steve moves away. There’s a new heat to Steve’s eyes, a heat that Tony hasn’t seen before but likes, wants.
“Sam,” Tony says, relieved. “Sam, it’s Wanda.”
“Even if… I believe you, and I do believe you,” Tony begins, his brow furrowing, “James, we’ve slept together, we’ve… we loved each other once, and you told me… you told me that you still love me, and I… I won’t stop loving you, James, which
“Tony,” Eshe says, softly. “Tony, I think, or rather, I have a feeling that the reason why you think you’re undeserving of Steve has a lot to do with something that happened before you met him, probably before you met James even. Am I right?”
“The guy from my dream the night before,” Tony says, smacking his lips to rid himself of the dryness in his mouth, like sawdust. “The guy in the dirty sweater, with knives for hands, the same guy that Pepper saw in her dream as well. He stalked me through the boiler room, cornered me in this alcove sort of thing, and he was, he was about to kill me, and I burned myself on one of the pipes; it was so hot that I burned myself, and I woke up in the middle of class and look–”
“Maybe,” Steve says, vaguely.
“I think they love you too. In fact, I don’t think anything. I
As Howard’s talking, as he straightens, Tony sees him, sees Obadiah in the mirror behind his father.
“He…” Jarvis clears his throat. “I know it doesn’t mean much, sir, but there is a lot about your father you don’t know.”
Steve blushes hotly from hairline to collar. “I mean, I didn’t mean to overstep or assume that we were–”
But it’s an intact pillow, and there isn’t a feather in sight.
The pantry is quiet and dead-silent when he steps in, and the lights switch on after they track his footsteps when he gets closer to the wine that he has stashed behind a dark wicker basket full of pasta. He pulls back the basket, so he can reach behind, wince at the skin of the basket’s bristle against his bare skin in that tank top he’s wearing. He almost shouts with a thrill of triumph when his fingers curl around the neck of the bottle, and he grits his teeth a little when he tries to pull it out, without toppling over the entire basket.
?” he asks, innocuously.
“You son of a bitch,” he snarls.
He squeezes the children’s feet, before making his way to the door, where James is lingering.
“Bye, Appa,” Peter and Maushmi chime together kissing his cheek and running off inside, determined to find their friends.
,” Tony’s throat flexes, “well, you don’t want to know. Let’s just say that most prescription painkillers don’t work at all, except for fentanyl and only in small doses – that’s for end-of-life cancer patients – and I’ve just learned to live with it.”
“Hey,” he says, softly.
Steve rears over him, fucking him with unbridled enthusiasm, and Tony just lies there and takes it, each thrust ripping another surge of pleasure from his body. He’s filling Tony deeper and rougher, and Tony’s heart is in his throat, and he can’t say anything. There are a million words that he wants to say, but they’re all lodged in his throat along with his heart, and he doesn’t think that Steve would want to hear them anyway.
Tony takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. Slowly, his breathing relaxes, and when he wakes up, he’s in a coffin.
Steve leans down and licks up the warm crease between thigh and pelvic bone, making Tony squirm. He sucks in a deep breath, when Steve presses the blunt end of the vibrator up against his swollen rim.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m just…” he takes a deep, steadying breath, remembering how it had looked, these two men that he loves more than life itself holding these two children of his that he loves like he loves nothing else in this world. “I’m just
, you tell me that,
I’m from Brooklyn. Why the fuck would I lie about that?”
Tony wants to say,
First, he seizes Steve’s gun and plants his hands on Steve’s shoulders, pushing him down to take a seat on the couch before his legs give out from underneath him. Steve goes willingly, and his legs grumbling, and he settles heavily on the edge of the couch. Tony turns on James next, and James begins to back away.
Ship/Main Pairing: Tony/Steve
“One, two, Obie’s coming for you–”
Steve blushes. “Okay, maybe not my most perfect compliment-”
And then, he grabs Hodge’s dinner knife and slams it right between his legs, slicing through the seam of his fatigues around his crotch, but avoiding flesh.
“I’m not discounting him,” Tony says, defensively, rubbing his sternum in a nervous gesture. “I’m just pointing out exactly what the others, like Phillips, are going to point out. He is not their chosen, their favourite. They won’t see what we see.”
Steve’s brow furrows further. “Tony,” he says, gently. “Hey…” he wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him against his chest. “If you’re sick, you tell me, okay, and I’ll… I’ll make some arrangements, okay. Someone, we can get someone to come and stay with you, today, help with the kids. What about Pepper?”
He makes his way out of the workstation, up into the proper levels of the house and to the front door, throwing it open.
The adults turn around, seeing Tony enter. Tony looks at the TV, stops.
But then, Steve would find out, and that might actually push the man over the edge and pack his bags.
Tony bristles. “You don’t get to say that to me. You don’t know me. You don’t know our marriage. You don’t know
“I am afraid, sir, that the doors are as locked as they were five minutes ago,” JARVIS says, primly.
The heat of his lust overtakes any shame that might have seeped into his body like a disease without the kiss, without the arousal.
He’s not Steve; he’s not the type that leaves his family behind, his trusting husband and his loving children to go and fuck some random redheaded co-worker because he wants something new, something exciting, something that isn’t his boring, stalwart husband.
Tony had made the choice to work from home because he didn’t want Peter and Maushmi ever looking up one day and wondering where he was. This way, he attended every single parent-teacher interview, every play, ever award presentation, every single school event that the administration insisted on having for children too young to know the difference.
He’s devoid of tears, like they’ve been squeezed out of his body.
One night, he begs Sam and Wanda to babysit for him. Wanda takes one look at him and gives him that sly, cocky smile of hers, stretching across her beautiful face, and asks him in a provocative voice, “Big plans, huh?”
“Thank God,” Steve declares.
“You’re in no condition,” Natasha repeats, her arms folding over her chest.
Sam tilts his head. “What makes you think that there are consequences?”
ended as well, and Dwārakā was submerged.”
Tony digs his hands into Steve’s shoulders, and Steve lifts him onto the bar, sliding between the space that Tony leaves for him with his legs spread. Steve continues to kiss him- slides his tongue into his mouth and curls it behind his teeth, and all the control that Tony had assumed in this exchange goes out the fucking window as Steve destroys him, sets a fire in him that he hasn’t felt in years, makes his heart thunder in his chest as if it’s about to burst. And then, Steve pulls away, and Tony heaves an unsteady breath.
“So, why didn’t you? Because Natasha stopped you?”
Romanoff is at the door.”
“But you love Steve and Bucky.”
the reactions. All you can do is give him all the information and allow him to have the reaction for himself.”
Tony’s tongue is dry and stuck to the roof of his mouth, and he processes it, processes it as quickly as possible, and then, he looks around, searching.
wants me. He still fucking wants me, and you
It’s even Indian gold, which means that Steve had to trek all the way to Iselin to the good jewellers to get it for him.
With a firm hand on Tony’s thigh splaying him wide, he shifts his fingers, the next thrust dragging so relentlessly against Tony’s prostate that the knot tightening in his belly bursts apart in a melting of sensation, and Tony’s coming, coming with his cock not even hard, and he feels it everywhere, behind his eyes, his toes curling, in the pit of his throat and his belly and in the notches of his spine, and he’s suspended in air, light cutting through him at different points, before that too shatters, and he’s falling back against the bed, his chest burning and his arms and legs tingling.
Steve tells her about how it felt like something died inside him, his voice pitched low, a bleak, hard look in his eyes, as he says,
He thinks of Maushmi, sweet, bold Maushmi, strapped to a table, chained to a bed, and the desire to destroy something raises its ugly head within him, beats to life in his chest, and God, he can’t imagine what it was like for Natasha, to go through something like that.
The alpha from the Stark Expo is there in the line-up, standing at the end, a head shorter than the rest, and Tony smiles at him, when he catches his eyes.
Tony follows him.
Beside him, Pepper is sobbing, and so is Peter. Rhodey is on the other side of Tony, and he’s looking away, as though looking away will do away with the fact that Tony is dead.
And then, he looks at the chest.
Steve hurries himself when he sees what Tony is doing, undressing, his clothes falling by his feet, and then, he even bends over, picking them up, folding them neatly and placing them on a nearby chair.
“Surrogate,” Tony says, shortly. “My friend, Pepper. She agreed to be the surrogate. It was, there were complex stem cells involved, so they look like both me and Steve.”
“That’s really what you think, that she set you up with these?” Steve asks, waving the photos around. “That she… she wanted to subsume your life, or whatever insane idea that you’re thinking about over there? Natasha isn’t that sort of person; she’s not trying to steal your life.”
“I did. I didn’t realise that was such a crime,” Steve says, defensively.
“Hey,” Bucky says, gently, and his big, warm palms land on her shoulders, his thumbs dragging over the sharp curve of her collarbone. “Look at me.”
like that, a woman you never even mentioned to me, Steve. You have never mentioned any of your fucking work colleagues; you have never mentioned that you are particularly close to any single one of them, but
“Excuse me?”
“Nothing. That’s the way it is,” he says, his voice cold and clean and sharp.
, fucking
Tony climbs into the bed, which has been changed with fresh, clean sheets – it almost seems like a dream, after everything that has happened, to fall asleep in this bed, as though not an hour or two ago, Grant had slid into his chambers and climbed on top of him only to get a knife in his throat for his efforts.
“You don’t even
“I was so angry at everything,” her mouth curls up, ruefully. “So angry at my brother, angry at Sam, but I was angry at myself more than anything. I was angry that I wasn’t there for him, that I’d abandoned him, left him for greener pastures, you know? I was angry that I hadn’t tried to help him, loved him through everything. I should never have left him, and I couldn’t help but think that if I had been there, he might not have died. Sam… he became a face for my anger. He became the reason why I left my brother, even if that wasn’t true, even if I was just blaming someone else for my problems, my issues. I was constantly starting arguments with him, fighting with him, and he took it all. He stood there and took it all. In hindsight, he should have acknowledged that it wasn’t healthy for him to sit there and take all of my shit, that he couldn’t just
Tony twists his head so that he can prop his chin on Steve’s breastbone. “What do you think I should do?” he asks, quietly. “I could… I could lock it all up and drop it into the bottom of the ocean, or we could, we could head over to the Compound tomorrow, talk to Bruce and Lang and see if we could build this, build this machine, and maybe…” he trails off.
“Rhodey knew how you felt about me; he also knew how I felt about you. He spoke to me one night, after you’d fallen asleep over your computer, after we’d spent like six hours decoding that message about which treatment plant HYDRA was going to use to disseminate the poison? Remember that night?”
“Things didn’t even need to change,” Grant goes onto say, as he spreads Tony’s legs wide, fitting himself between them.
Steve leans forward, the look on his face suddenly vicious and defensive. “That’s different though. You have nothing but suspicions and you’ve looked at what I’ve done over this last year, and you’ve… you’ve put two and two together and come up with fifty-three. I get it, Tony. I lied to you. I should’ve told you about SHIELD, and I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry, and I know,
Tony’s face must betray his surprise.
“Thank you,” Tony says, his voice shaking with gratitude.
tired now, because you didn’t care enough to tell me the truth as to why you were tired. Instead, you let me go on thinking that you didn’t want me anymore, that I had to beg for your attention, that you were screwing someone else, that you wanted pussy now that you’d had your taste of cock.”
Each of them taking an end with the poles, they left the chest from the altar and lower it to the floor. Between the two of them, they manage to drag it in the direction of the second train tunnel.
,” Steve insists. “I haven’t given you many reasons to trust me, Tony, and if what I fear has happened here, you owe me nothing, but take this, take my sword, and if I judge you, if I treat you unkindly after you have told me the whole story, run
“Listen to me. Fall, and I’ll catch you.”
“If we were in normal times, I would absolutely leave you alone,” Tony begins, and he can see Steve already puffing up in anger, readying himself for Round 2, “but I feel like if I do, you’re just going to stew in more of this shit.”
Tony scowls. “You are not helping this situation,” he grinds out. He shakes his head. “What we wanted to talk to you about is James, him and me and your Daddy.”
There is a third question the priest is supposed to ask, about accepting children and to bring them up according to the law of Christ and his Church, and Tony knows that his mother would literally set him on fire if she were alive and were capable of hearing the priest ask him that question.
“Hold it,” he calls out, a little shiver of pleasure curling in his chest. “Come here.”
Steve looks earnest, the kind of the way that white All-American Boys are automatically believed. “Listen, sir, this is serious. Tony had a nightmare about Nat being in danger, or something,” he falters, “and so he thinks–”
White cliff falls away into the turbulent sea, which spits up a waterfall of water, sending birds screeching and soaring away from the land that looks like it might not survive the impending destruction.
“Do you have a good German Riesling?” Tony asks, curiously, without even touching the wine list.
“You can’t give me orders!” Tony shouts back.
She must get all sorts of information on peoples’ sex lives in her profession.
Constantly.
Natasha rubs her hand over her face. “Thank you for hearing me out,” she offers, sincerely. “For what it’s worth, I do feel awful about all the confusion that I caused, and I’m glad that you and Steve were able to work things out.”
“I wouldn’t lie to you about that,” Tony murmurs.
“No, no,” James says, quickly. “No, I’m not going anywhere, guys. I promise.”
Tony thinks he might be an idiot.
“Stop,” Steve tells him, his voice firm.
He made a promise, and he’s going to keep it.
Tony steps into the field of tents.
When both cars are in the same high section, the Nazis blast away at them. The noise is deafening, with barking guns, splintering rock, and twanging ricochets contributing to the din.
“I… you… I mean, we’ve both been tired-” Steve tries to argue.
“Excuse me?” Tony asks, uncertainly.
“Would you just…” Steve flounders for words. “Would you just let me talk?”
“But you were able to live without me,” he says, woodenly, nodding to himself, as if acknowledging some terrible reality.
“Gentleman,” the alpha female drawls, confident and self-assured in a way that Tony finds incredibly attractive (his mother would disapprove, though; a white alpha is tolerable, but a white
Tony chokes. “You swear?”
“Oh?”
“James?” Tony says and turns, so that his back is to his family. “James, what’s going on?” he asks, his voice low and hushed.
Tony’s throat is almost too full of words, and he offers Sam a slight, pained smile, before going ahead with his story.
“You’re not leaving me this time, are you?” Tony blurts out, his hands shaking.
Tony considers him for a moment. “I shouldn’t have… attacked Barnes in Siberia,” he says, and honestly, it’s annoying having to loosen his pride for this.
Tony’s throat flexes. “I…” he flounders for words.
. I’m just saying that shit isn’t fucking simple, okay. I love you, I do. In general, yes, I am happy with our life. I love you, I love our home, I love our kids, but yes, I was struggling with what my life is, but that doesn’t mean that I was fucking unhappy. I am happy, Steve. I want more, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not happy. I was
Tony drops the photos back onto the table as if they’re poisonous.
“It’s not just me,” Toni said, quietly, staring down at her lap.
“I need some help here!” Steve shouts, carrying Tony in his arms.
Peter and Maushmi stop playing almost immediately and turn to look at him in an eerily similar action.
, Steve,” Tony says, his voice turning fiery.
“She has left now, sir,” JARVIS offers, softly.
Tony holds a hand up to stay whatever protest is going to fall out of Steve. “I just…” he swallows against the involuntary tightening of his throat. “I just need some time, Steve. I need some space.”
But it’s too late. Steve is running back through the path of flames to the centre of the room. Snakes strike at his flying heels. Steve reaches the base of a pillar, and he uses the torch to clear away the scattered snakes climbing on it. He pulls out his whip, drawing it back, then wrapping it solidly around the pillar around fifteen feet up.
He finds her in the living room, reading a book, her skirt riding up her knees, her legs up on the sofa.
It spreads into his eyes and his mouth and his ears, and he can feel it everywhere, a sickening throb that almost feels like his mother’s embrace in some strange way.
“It’ll protect you,” he insists.
“So, what did she say to you?” Steve asks, curiously, flopping onto the bed.
Hearing his voice, Peter and Maushmi abandon the safety they feel in Steve’s embrace, and stretch out their pudgy little arms for Tony, who carefully lifts them onto his hip. He makes his way out of the warehouse, kicking the door open, towards the car, and Steve’s already there, opening the back door, so that Tony can place the kids inside.
His fingers find his nipples, thumbing over them as they turn diamond-hard, gasping a little at the sensation.
Peter and Maushmi look up with confusion at the stranger walking into their living room.
remember what Stane did to me back then?” Tony demands. “Because I sure as hell don’t. So, isn’t it possible that we, that I, some of us, all of us, we lied. The only evidence that would… paint him as this child abuser are those tapes, our testimonies, our voices. If we destroy those tapes, maybe, just maybe–”
“She’s got a point, honey,” Tony says. “You sound like a cat dying when you sing.”
Whether she or he like it or not, she is the face of his nightmares, the beautiful, seductive shade that stalks him, ready to slip a knife into his back.
“Like a million bucks, little man,” Rhodey declares, offering Peter his fist to bump.
“Oh,” Maushmi says, lamely. “Where’s Daddy? Isn’t he with you?”
“We can’t get married, remember. They’d kill us for it, most likely,” Tony teases around the lump that forms in his throat.
Initially, that had bothered him, especially when a game of Truth or Dare at Team Game Night had led to him and Steve making out in front of the team, plus Rhodey, Pepper and Coulson – he’d wondered if this was some latent daddy issue of his, wanting to be with Steve Rogers, whom his father loved so much more than he loved Tony, and he wondered if it were smart, stupid, messy, all of those things to get involved with the other man.
His body is heavy like a graveyard, and slowly but surely, Tony collapses under its weight.
“I have no idea,” Tony exhales.
Tony rolls his eyes. “When we get home from school tonight, the two of you are going to clean this place up. This is a bathroom, not a pigsty,” he tells them, firmly.
“It was a great first time, though,” James teases.
“I should be heading out. I don’t want… I don’t want to cause problems for you by being here,” James says, quietly.
“Tony, Tony,” Thor soothes, “injuring my brother will not help you now.”
Tony holds his hands up in surrender. “Sorry, sorry.” He surveys the wounds, the bandages clean and bright. “Good?”
“I’m worried about you. I’m just… look, there are reasons why you’re not telling Steve about James, and I think you kind of hit the nail on the head, about how it looks. It does look bad, the secret-keeping, and you know what it feels like to be on the other side. So, I just don’t want you to make the same mistakes that you’re vilifying Steve for. Emotional infidelity, that’s a thing.”
