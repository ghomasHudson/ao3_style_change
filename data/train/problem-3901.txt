“I think so. One of them, Ellen, said she knew some hunters who specialized in them that would want to be made aware.”
"I don't have one," Cas says. The growing fire plays across his face, going between orange-red and shadow. "Do you remember that time I called you?"
he snarls, turning around. He can tell from the way the angel looks at him, that his eyes have turned black. “In fact, I’d say having some extra tricks makes it
There’s another case waiting for him, because there always is. Unlike always, Dean decides to come along. The hunt goes - smoothly. And Cas confirms the slowly rising thought that people tend to eat way more than he does.
"Yeah, not a fun surprise for me either. But the real kicker?" He can feel himself grinning, the type of smile that can only be read as a threat. "I'm the one meant to 'finish it'. But the angels were all
“What band, what band,” Dean says, flicking through the cassette tapes. The stereo Dean put in has room for cassettes
*Jerry Maguire is a movie wherein Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger fall in love amongst some sports journalist drama and part of the romance subplot occurs when Cruise's character bonds with Renee's character's son. This was in the OG episode but I have not seen Jerry Maguire so!
” He twists his mouth, looks at the thing sharing the motel room. “I’m still more of a man than you.”
Bobby tosses Sam the rings, and Lucifer stalks over to him, the intent to kill, to crush, or worse. His brother is pressed against the side of the Impala, one fist holding the rings and one trying to hold Lucifer back. The psychic shield is powerful, but Lucifer can break through it with just a bit of effort.
If his last year on Earth is hard to remember, hell is just as splotchy - it all ran together like oil paints left in the heat; some parts melting, a few shining with unexpected clarity in the aftermath. Sometimes Dean thinks that if he were still a man, the memories of what he did would leave him catatonic, or worse. These days it fuels him, pushes him forward, and he thinks of the torture, the mind-numbing terror, as tools of the trade to getting what he wants.
Cassie doesn’t mention Cas and they keep going out. Dean isn’t sure what, exactly, Cas is still doing in Columbus. He figured out the shapeshifter thing a few weeks ago, and even John seems to be thinking they should be moving on soon. Cas doesn’t mention any hunts, and Dean doesn’t bring them up either. They talk about movies, and the strange music collection Cas is amassing for his car that Dean can’t listen to for more than about twenty minutes. They meet up for drinks or he'll pair him up with one of Cassie's friends so the four of them can go out or they'll just sit on the quad and watch the students pass by.
Dean doesn't know who he means until he catches Cas's anxious, wide-eyed expression, and then he very much does. "Angels?"
"I'm checking out," he tells the man behind the desk. He hands the motel key over. "Do you have any atlases or maps?" The man nods and heads to the back, coming out with a thick book and charging Cas six fifty for it. He pays with the cash. "Thanks. By the way. Where are we?"
Dean gets home from his shift at the garage and John’s at the rental house, takes a look at him before turning away to the bag he’s filling up with clothes. He says they’re moving on the day after tomorrow and to start packing.
“No,” he says, putting the blade back into the sleeve of his coat, somewhere hidden. The three witches responsible for the storm are dead at the altar, and Dean kicks the remains of the cauldron away with his boot.
They pour over old newspaper articles, scan different web forums and search about the town’s history. Dean’s eyelids feel like sandpaper. They even go back to interview some of the victims’ family members again. They find the same shit they found last time: absolutely nothing.
“Dean, just - don’t -” Dean waits. His brother, or the man who had once been his brother, however it works, just sighs and says, “try not to die. Again.”
“Like I said,” Cas returns, “I have faith that he can make it right, as our Father said so long ago.”
***My Own Private Idaho, while not an explicitly queer film, definitely became a cult classic due to a lot of its queer themes in having River Phoenix be a sex worker with primarily male clientele while also having some level of unrequited feelings for Keanu Reeves' character. This, combined with being in a lot of ways a roadtrip movie through various parts of the US seemed to be something Dean could've gotten talked into seeing and then would have just Thought About For Six Months Straight.
Sam says, his hand out, blood dripping from his face, and Dean can sense the power behind those words even though they're not directed at him. It's most likely no more than a nudge to two archangels, but a nudge is all they need to be forced into the Cage, shoved deep inside before it all snaps shut again.
Hookman is such a whatever episode in the grand scheme of season one. All I remember thinking when I was rewatching it while writing the season 0 stuff was 'Taylor didn't deserve that' and, well. Especially as one of the few POC we see in the early seasons um. Yikes. Anyway yeah so in my mind this chapter became a very important emotional linchpin for the s1 rewrite (next to Scarecrow and Hell House) which I just think is very funny. Enjoy!
“The fact that half this town has a few screws loose. There’s four thousand people here, max, and a mental institute’s
“Eh, you know, running around in the woods, felt like a real Van Helsing.” His face must go into a grimace when he strips out of the flannel, because Cas sets his beer down and gets closer.
Also I will be out of town this weekend (and I do mean like a town over, no crazy travelling, and I'm just seeing another fully vaccinated friend, promise!) but I won't have my laptop so next chapter may be updating on Monday. We'll see! :)
The spray is hot and soothing on muscles that don’t ache anymore. He soaps up his body, double checking his nails really are clean. He thinks about the bag that’s still out by his duffel, if Cas is going to go through it and think about - he swallows. It’s fine, really. Cas has seen him at his worst - bleeding out, waxing poetically about Dr. Sexy reruns, on the verge of death, admiring the thread count on t-shirts when they go thrifting - sex is sex, is the thing. Sex with Cas should be simple.
Dean swallows. Nods, though his dad doesn’t see it. He leaves the motel room, puts his bag in the car. There’s no other car in the parking lot aside from his dad’s.
Dean sighs. "Look, man, I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you something else, but. You're a good guy, Cas. And a good hunter, too, for what it's worth. I'm uh. Glad you convinced me to go back to that house. Dad could've gotten hurt if we didn't, you know?"
Dean and Castiel don’t have an official signal, exactly, no words or gestures. But Dean’s expression shifts just so, and Castiel knows what the demon wants from him.
“Just the shoulder,” he admits. Cas puts a hand on it, closes his eyes, breathes out through his mouth. The ache dissipates into nothing, but he circles it experimentally, just in case. “Thanks.” Cas’s hand trails up from the shoulder to his neck, his jaw. He kisses him and Dean’s heart squeezes for a second before he remembers it’s just them, in a locked room, with no one he knows around. He leans into it, eyes closed, runs a hand through Cas’s hair. It always ends just short of where Dean’s mind thinks it will, and he’s left touching along the bare nape of his neck instead.
“Cassie,” she says, throwing her arm over the back of the chair to really show that she's settling in. “I have a name, you know, and it’s not ‘look’.” She logs on and pulls up an internet browser.
The next time he eats something is at a tourist trap diner in Oregon at two in the morning after another hunt. He doesn’t know what to get. Dean, the hunter across from him, gets a burger. So he gets a burger.
Which is why it’s so terrible that he can’t absorb a thing of what Dean’s saying when it comes to cars.
no longer having to be pinned in place. In this form, he can see the blankets of Grace, the beings above who want Castiel. They’re all chanting for him, and Dean catches snippets of their conversation, their thoughts, their disgust at the sight of Dean, the Righteous Man twisted and broken until he’s no longer even considered a man.
He’s not sure if Anna genuinely wants to come with him, but perhaps what she sees in Sam is too questionable, compared to the essence of a fellow angel. They’re nearly ready to leave, route planned out, when Bobby’s phone rings. It’s one of many, Castiel notes, sitting on various tables, presumably with various numbers and aliases behind it.
Her eyes slide across the two of them, and Dean wants to say they’re not doing anything, even though, really, they
Dean had thought friends were things he doesn't get to have anymore. Hunters have sources and allies, but not friends.
“You too, Sammy. And you better bring the car back.” He hands up, tosses the phone in the passenger seat for Sam to track. It’s not like he’ll be needing it for a while.
Dean glances at the possible banshee case that was probably benevolent anyway, and flips the newspaper closed.
“So you fell,” Castiel says, after an hour into the trip. The roads are flat, and Anna is not the conversation partner that Dean is.
ANYway - this was a very fun rewrite for me, personally, as someone who was a Dean girl until I saw Cas onscreen and shifted gears immediately afterwards. Hope you all enjoy as well!
“We’re getting you a cell phone.” Dean’s voice is on the other line, rough and annoyed. Castiel feels his mouth pull to the side. “Do know how many demons I had to bleed dry before I figured you got pulled away by -”
of victim that a monster goes for, or some type of pattern. This is just people dying over and over again.” It looks like the deaths started back during the Dust Bowl, or maybe even earlier, but that’s all the library documented.
” Dean says, grinning. Castiel's mouth does something, and he ducks his head. Dean thinks it might have been the grassroots attempt at a smile. He leans a little closer, and throws his arms over Cas’s shoulder. The angel tenses up, looks at Dean, frowning.
“Demon - dude, what the fuck? I bring you up here because you went Girl, Interrupted on me and then you just take us on some weird side quest that pissed my dad off.”
"You think she'd be safer in a kitsch little apartment by the bay? We'll finish this and keep looking for dad in the meantime. Maybe he points us to some other hunts, maybe he doesn't. But you can't just stew in it and hope this blows over in two weeks, okay? This is big. I know it." His brother's jaw works, eyes back on the treeline.
for her? She messed with shit she shouldn’t have messed with.” Dean thought about laying them out more properly than how they died entwined and soaked in each other's blood, but it didn't really matter, in the end.
He had seen what other demons did to his fellow soldiers. How they would rend their Grace apart, shred it into ribbons, mangle and crush it even as it burned the demonic souls to even touch it. Dean doesn’t have quite that reaction. Instead he holds the weak, blue light, passes it back and forth like he’s examining, playing with it.
"Sap," he says, voice almost breaking. Cas comes after him, putting an arm over his middle, cheek on his shoulder. He doesn't ask if that's alright - thank someone. Dean doesn't think he could survive the embarrassment if he did.
Whatever his brother may have said next is cut short. The room they're in is warded to hell (hah) and back, but his brother didn’t quite make it in terms of heaven-proofing. Dean sees a few Enochian sigils around, but nothing concrete or complete enough to stop Castiel from bursting into his holding area.
"Thanks," he says, because he can’t think of what else to say. It's a blue book with 'The trouble with nature' on the front, with more text along the bottom of the cover. It doesn't look how he'd expect it to, a book that has information about… that sort of thing. He tucks it inside his jacket to keep it out of sight. “Listen, Cassie, I…”
Cas turns, touches Dean's temples before he can loll back against the car. He opens one eye to watch Cas. He looks like he's concentrating all his energy on his brow bone. His fingers are warmer than the cool metal of the car. His ring and pinkie fingers are embedded in his hair.
when he says it. It feels both correct and misplaced, a perfect fit and badly sized. He frowns at the bag, then glances around.
“Hmm. Alright.” She hits the ‘print’ option on the paper that's displayed and stands up. “Watch my spot,” she says, brushing against him as she moves past, “don’t want anyone taking it.” Dean tries not to react, but it's a losing battle.
manage to cook up is not going to be nearly as poetic as the 'two brothers killing each other' motif they were going for." Sam scoffs.
Cas brings it up next time, a month later. Dean is stuck over Cas’s prone form, the guy knocked unconscious by a vicious shapeshifter wearing Cas’s face. It’s weird to see it all twisted up like that, micro-expressions turning his placid, content face into one of contempt.
They stop in Chicago. Dean had been before, a few times. Cas takes them to the Art Institute because it's free the first Saturday of every month. They stop in front of that bigass painting made up of dots that the kids from Ferris Bueller stared at. Dean buys the postcard, scrawls out a message. Debates sending it. He makes them eat deep dish pizza and laughs at the journey Cas’s face goes through when he realizes the sauce is cold.
When I first started this story I had faint memories of this episode. Mostly that Cassie was fun and cool. Actually watching this episode back (compounded with 15 years of spn canon not treating like, any of its characters from any minority group well?) Yeah. Like, I tried you guys, I went to the drawing board with this one quite a bit, but in the end it's a bit like 'put lipstick on a pig it's still a pig', you know? I know I've mentioned before trying to take the characters we've already seen in spn and giving them a better handling (hopefully) than they got in canon. For this rewrite I felt one of the more important aspects was giving Cassie more agency in terms of handling the case. It fleshes her out as a more three-dimensional character beyond Dean's old girlfriend, and I think having a diverse cast that is full of well thought out characterization is more important than diversity for the sake of diversity that doesn't, you know, say or do anything with it? Anyway if you do see something in here that is pretty egregious let me know and I'll see what changes I can make! Fandom should be a space for everyone, not something that runs on contingencies. Stay safe out there! :)
“I think some people could say the same thing about you.” Sam flinches back, and Dean smiles. “I can practically taste the demon blood from over here, Sammy. Thought I told you to stay away from other demons. You don’t know where they’ve been.”
He wakes up, turns over in bed to wrap blankets tighter around himself, and dozes. The room is pleasantly cool, the air conditioning unit kicking on in the window providing comforting background noise. When he opens his eyes, he sees the ugliest floral wallpaper he's ever laid eyes on.
Dean’s face is inscrutable - or maybe that’s because the sun is behind Cas’s head and it hurts to look that way. “I, uh. I mean. Hey man, as long as you’re cool with it, I’m cool with it.”
“This doesn’t change anything,” Michael spits out, and he takes the blade in his once-limp hand and runs Dean through with it. The pain hardly registers against the force of Lucifer wrestling for control back. He feels blood bubble up his throat.
Cas sticks with Dean for a few weeks. The thing in Minneapolis is a Rawhead, stealing children, hiding in the dark corners of abandoned buildings. He got to use a taser for the (presumably) first time.
he tells himself. He tries to make it good for him, tries to ignore all the other shit that’s been buried in his brain, needling its way up to the surface.
The form that is not human, is not kind, is perhaps not really even Dean Winchester anymore, smiles at him. Bone and blood. “Okay Castiel. I’m listening.”
He blinks. "Dean's my friend." She frowns up at him. Her name’s Beth, she’s known Cassie since they both started school and they live together in an apartment off campus. She’s studying English and wears a lot of eyeliner. She gives him a look similar to the one he gives to family members who lost a loved one in a supernatural attack.
“You’re very distracting,” he says, distinctly realizing that now would be a great time for the ground to swallow him up. Dean stares at him. “I’m sorry. I try to pay attention, really, I just -”
Dean is stronger than the garden variety demon - something in his blood, about destiny being turned and pulled taught by his own defiled existence. Castiel as he is now is weaker than him. Dean still turns his back.
“If you turn her in now, with me,” Uriel says, addressing Castiel once more, “then perhaps the rest of heaven will rethink your ultimate punishment.”
I may not be able to post again until next Thursday due to being away, but we'll see. Hopefully this is enough to tide you over till then ;)
"I mean I'm trying not to be a jerk - this looks like it’s kind of a big deal for you," she says, crossing her arms, "I’m pissed we’re breaking up, don’t get me wrong, but after seeing what my parents dealt with from being together back home… it's shitty, judging people for who they love.” She huffs, running her hands through her hair, shaking it out. Neither of them say anything for a minute. “Actually, um, I think I have something I can give you… yeah. Here." She digs out a book from one of her desk drawers and hands it over. "Part of my gender and sexuality class last term. Maybe you'll get some use out of it."
Demon Dean would be a switch and I've literally never written breathplay before but I just think he'd be into that too.
*Veronica Mars started in 2004 and is about a teenage girl in California who uses her plucky personality and fast thinking to solve various mysteries, is PEAK 2000s culture and you know what? Early season Dean and Veronica are like. Not the same? But also the same.
There’s another seal in Cairo. Dean thought that meant Egypt, but it’s actually an abandoned town in Illinois. Dean’s used to fighting demons, but this time around, they see an angel. Dean thinks he can kill it, it doesn’t seem as self-assured as Cas, but when it spots him, it lowers its blade. “Castiel?” it asks.
"He'll be good," Cas tells Sam. "Or however a demon passes for good." He takes his hand from his pocket and holds it out. "Thank you," Cas tells his brother, "for everything."
She licks her bottom lip like she’s thinking, but then she peers a bit deeper and sucks her teeth, disappointed.
While Lore Podcast is my favorite spn podcast bc it makes me laugh, Carrying Wayward is like. A podcast about spn for people who like spn on a more genuine level. Anyway the hosts had a moment in covering the Salvation ep where  they were like 'Dean tries to tell Sam it's not his fault [that the demon killing people] and John is *there in the room* and he doesn't say *anything* to try and parent him'. And I had to  go lie down. So the real reason this chapter was late was bc writing John is taking years off my life. Rowena torturing Cas is just like. 9.09 Holy Terror inspired Hot Girl Summer.
"Guess so," he says, leaning over just enough that Cas moves in to meet him; simple, sweet, heat under his hand and Cas's fingers playing with the hem of his shirt.
Cas hates Guinness more than he hates gin and tonics, but he chokes down the pint and Dean drinks enough to block out the burning Gillespie house and the look in John’s eyes and the thought of his brother until it’s just him and Cas stumbling down Market street and arguing over whose car to sleep in.
A spirit hasn’t manifested yet, but it’s only a matter of time. He keeps moving through the darkness; distantly, something else begins to move with him. “If you’re trying to attack me, you’re taking your time,” he says, frowning out the dirty, barred windows looking down into an overgrown courtyard. Thick fingers curl around his shoulder, and he slowly turns.
“There are rumors,” Castiel tries, “within that tablet, within other magic rituals, of restoring a demon’s humanity.”
She looks up at him, dark eyes giving him a ‘no bullshit’ look that he can’t help but like, even if she’s stealing his spot. “I think we both got here about the same time,” she replies, sinking into the chair and crossing her legs.
“Yeah?” Dean says, stretching his arms over his head, twisting this way and that, “want to take it for a test drive?”
“Dean.” John pulls a book towards him and opens it, reads through a paragraph. Dean shifts on his feet. His dad finally looks at him. “You know I only want what’s best for you, right?”
“Well, that’s more for me than anything,” he protests. He feels Cas smile against the skin of his shoulder. Dean turns his head to glare at him, and his smile goes even wider until it’s a full on grin. “Shut
He was never a good man, not really - he’d dress up his selfish wants in a brand of selfless sacrifice, but he only ever really held back due to guilt, expectations. Now there’s nothing that can stop him, and as Cas breathes into his mouth, scrabbling at his arms, his shoulders, trying to get them all-encompassingly closer, he knows that he’s going to finally, finally get what he wants.
“Since before you were even born, it was written.” The space between them pulls, like an invisible, gargantuan hand is stretching his plane of vision, and for a moment, Castiel thinks he sees something golden and shining, something like -
Shoutout to @posyfoot on tumblr for suggesting a crocotta as a monster as it sounded like Dean may have hunted one before the series!
"They're saying..." Cas blinks, once, twice. He doesn't usually do that. "They're going to destroy the town."
Cas’s case doesn't sound like doppelgangers or anything else. Witchcraft, maybe, but even that doesn't seem to explain it. "Say you're like Heather,” he starts, talking a turn onto the main drag and tapping ash out of the rolled down window. “You get raised by some magic mumbo jumbo or whatever. Usually whoever did the raising makes contact pretty damn quick. You've been driving around for over a year at this point, nada. And this evil clone -"
“Sometimes,” Cas returns. Dean breathes out, once. Hits the gas and goes, Cas riding shotgun until he can’t anymore.
“It wouldn’t serve our purpose,” he says. Dean moves over to the window, checking the runes they carved into the wooden sill, more out of habit than anything else. “It’s to save everything,” Castiel persists, “this form works well enough for now, but eventually you’ll hit a wall.”
He doesn’t bring Cas into the room, doesn’t want him dealing with John. Instead he says goodbye and hints that maybe he should make himself scarce as soon as possible, just in case his dad wants to scare him away or something.
“Maybe the land’s cursed?” Cas says. They’re at an internet café the two of them camped out next to each other to see if they can find anything useful. “Walking in it is like a trip mine.”
“They were going to take me away. They were going to… make me forget.” Cas shakes his head, brows furrowed. “Forget
Dean keeps thinking about it. He sits and looks at Cas, whose face is cut by the neon lights flashing in the window they’re sitting by, features playing out in interesting and new ways in the red and blue and shadow, and he wonders.
Perhaps there would be some nobility if he died fighting, here, even against the Righteous Man himself. Or what remained of him. But instead Castiel gathers himself through the growing pain and asks, “do you truly wish to stay here? In hell? Forever?”
Cas gets an iced mocha this time around and a breakfast sandwich. Dean gets a large hot coffee and a sandwich and two chocolate glazed. They eat on the drive to wherever Cas parked. Dean gives him the second doughnut.
Righteous Man at all is because when he speaks his name, 'Dean Winchester', the creature turns towards him, and the moment of recognition pierces Castiel through. He staggers with the weight of it, of what his charge has become, and all the demon does is consider the being of alien light before him and says, "haven’t heard that name in a long time."
He paces the summoning circle, notes the advanced spell work he hadn’t seen in ages, the salt ring around that, the iron circle built into the concrete floor below. Even if he could call up an earthquake, the iron might manage to hold.
Cas doesn’t have to even say what he wants to do. “Fine,” Dean says, goes to the bathroom where their newly bought trunks are drip drying in the shower stall.
“Listen, there’s a difference between watching Britney Spears dancing in some skintight spandex on MTV and saying she’s your personal life coach, okay?” Cas just keeps staring at him. Sometimes Dean tells him about stuff that he should and should not like, and Cas can never really understand why, despite asking questions to parse out the answer. The same thing happened last week when he and Dean were trawling through a thrift shop together and he spotted a turtleneck that looked to be his size.
I ended up flip-flopping between whether this fic was going to have sex scenes or just do a fade-to-black. I ended up putting one in that is pretty short and not overly indulgent just so it kind of fits with the relatively brief writing style. Also? Isn't it crazy that they just hooked up without discussing or resolving any of their issues? Yes. Is that also the more in-character option than having them hash things out like normal, healthy adults? Also yes. Enjoy!
Dean wants to burn down the whole fucking house. John makes them search for the grimoire first. His dad takes a collection of occult books and then tells him to finish the job. When he gets outside, Cas is there.
Dean tries to remember what he was going to say. Can't. He closes his eyes and zones out enough that he's resting his head on Cas's shoulder. "'M gonna be so hungover tomorrow."
Cas comes out a few minutes later, nestled in a crowd. Dean spots the same woman pressed up next to him at the same time Cas notices him and starts to pull away. “Hey,” the woman says, “call me, okay?” Her friends laugh in response and drag her away.
The last few sparks of his garrison went out - either he was too far to sense them, or they, too, had fallen. Castiel condenses himself, to protect the shreds of his Grace and to try to remain as inconspicuous as he can.
They don't speak for a while. Dean wants to offer up an explanation, even though Cas seems fine without one. His heart thuds in his chest as he searches for the words.
I know we were all hype over Bobby - I promise he'll be back next chapter, but instead you get a Cas & Pamela sleepover where they talk about boys and try to predict the future - SPN God/Chuck is OUT. It's all about the nebulous forces of the universe, babeyy.
Dean could just not look the damn gift horse in the fucking mouth and leave it at that. He really, really should. "Why're you so damn nice to me?" he says instead, sitting up and crossing his arms, trying to hold himself in place.
“Ruby told me about what you’re doing,” he starts. “You and that - angel, or whatever - stopped three seals from breaking last week alone.”
When he was a human, money had been an issue. Never having enough to stretch between him, Sam, and John, then just him and Sam. There were credit card scams, hustling, gambling, tricking when he needed a lot and needed it quick. There were weapons and ammo, gas, food, clothes, rooms to be put up at, repairs, maintenance, one bullshit bill after another.
About four days before posting this chapter I had a thought of *why* didn't we get a long cut of Sam and Dean in some laundromat silently watching their clothes spin?? we were ROBBED. So I shoved that in here, too. And hopefully everyone reading this also knows what a trip to Sioux Falls means...
“Stay here,” he orders him. Dean feels the air deflate out of him. “I’m going to finish this.” He stares at Cas. “And you should get going. Make yourself useful somewhere else.” He takes a duffel bag and walks out of the room. Dean watches him go, listens for the car to start up and drive off. He grinds his teeth, whirling around just to see Cas looking over the notes John had left behind - the things his dad was going to tell him so they could finish the case together.
Sam hesitates, then walks over to a small stand on the other side of the room that Dean’s being held in. “Run of the mill demons don’t have a lot they’re attached to,” he says. “Most of them can’t even remember what it’s like to be human.” He digs something out of the altar’s bowl and shows it to Dean.
"Come on, Cas, really?" he says it like they're talking about a girl Cas adamantly refuses to pick up, like he should be elbowing him in the side and leering.
“That is not what the instructions say.” Dean turns from where he’s been buried in the wires of Cas’s dashboard for the past twenty minutes.
presses down around  him. He shakes his head, forcing an amused scoff. He'd always been good at pressing Sam's buttons; he tries to remind himself that now isn't the best time to get back into practice. “There
“An old friend, perhaps,” Castiel says. He speaks humorlessly, but the words themselves make Dean smirk.
This is one of the first chapters I'm kind of 'eh' about - it was originally going to be a lot shorter, but since a lot of this is set up for future s1-s2 shenanigans, I wanted to add a bit more in terms of character growth and stuff. As for what Jo and Jess talked about while Cas went off to chat with Ash - Jess POV fic coming soonish, I imagine.
Got any requests?” She has a boom box sitting on her dresser with a stack of CDs next to it. “Please don’t say Metallica.”
The only thing they had concluded were those that were hospitalized seemed to last longer than victims who were out in the open, but the end was the same, and the cycle was left to repeat itself over and over again.
“It’s weird being here so long,” Dean adds. “Haven’t stuck around in one place since I was in high school, and never a city this big.”
He walks further into the field; Dean had figured there would be an entourage, an army. A few knights waiting in the wings. Instead it’s just them, some farmed-over, tawny stalks of wheat. There’s no sound of bids, no insects, no wind. Nothing but them.
"There's no pleasing you," Dean says, before sitting up at his seat. He leers, playful on top, a seriousness simmering underneath. "Unless...?"
"Imagine that," Dean echoes, and he gets off the next exit and heads west, following the setting sun.
Dean wants to stay angry. Maybe he still is. He wants to kick Cas out and mull over his mistakes until John comes back. Apologize, wait for the next hunt so he can prove to his dad he’s not a fuck up.
right. Dean trusts his dad’s judgement about 90 percent of the time. When he doesn’t, he’s smart enough to not say anything. But instead of hanging up, he rolls his eyes. “Man, shut up. Where are you?”
“No it’s not. Not with her, I mean. Not exactly. But with…” He looks over his shoulder at the two girls still at the bar, drinking something red and sweet. They’re his type. He doesn’t know if Cas has a type. But maybe… “I mean, do you ever think about. Just.” Words dry up in his throat.
?” Cas’s lips press in a thin line, eyes darkening at the thought. “Who’s going to protect me, angel?” He says, insultingly sweet. He holds the Grace out, letting it slip down between his fingers and hang in front of Cas’s eyes. “Open.”
“Need a drink?” It takes him a second to realize someone next to him is speaking. He glances over at the bartender. Swallows.
They make decent time and camp out for the night. Dean sketches out protective sigils in the dirt with a stick, the black earth kicking up the scent of mulched leaves and whatever else has been left to decompose on the forest floor for decades. Haley's guide, Roy, laughs at him and wanders off with a shotgun over his shoulder. Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes - if only guns could protect you from everything out there.
"I'm the one with presumably illegal firearms in a car that's registered to a fake name, Dean. I'm probably the evil clone."
After another moment of prolonged eye contact, Dean sighs in defeat. “Whatever. So what else did you do?”
“Someone else?” John asks. He’s leaning up against the counter in a way that seems casual if you didn’t know him.
"So could you," Dean challenges, "or did you forget all about that cute 'boy king' nickname the demons like to throw around?" His brother chews on the inside of his cheek, and it may be Dean's imagination (it isn't), but the room seems to darken, the corners fading out as
Keeping the book open on the passenger seat, he starts the car. He doesn't remember driving, but he pulls out of the parking spot and onto the lonely two lane road and gets going, anyhow.
“Never?” Dean asks. Castiel doesn’t touch him, but he stares at that part of him with a dark intensity that has some of Dean’s baser instincts sitting up and taking notice.
So if you came here from tiktok you know I had a joke about Cas listening to Quirky Weird Girl music produced in the 90s-2000s. Aka Fiona Apple, which is how she was always described to me growing up. Anyway I made a Spotify playlist for this fic, as you do, and realized I probably ought to listen to some Fiona Apple. Now I really really like Fiona Apple. I honestly don't know what I expected. And you can listen to the playlist here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4VaaFaHZ9mWHJ8PhEQKUbz?si=o0OAAn8URfG1HtpU2uBH0Q
It’s not that he doesn’t trust Castiel. When he was a human, he had a good gut instinct. Right from wrong, legit from sketchy. The guts got ripped out by hellhounds, but the intuition is still in there. And that old sense tells him that out of all the other angels he’s met, this one’s special. Dean wouldn’t have gotten out of hell without him, that’s for sure. Any other angel - if any had even survived to get down to where he was - would have seen what had become of the so-called Righteous Man and fled. Not Cas, though. So plucky, so brilliant, so adorably naïve. He trusts him and his socially awkward earnestness more than anyone in heaven, hell, or earth - but.
"I'm sure there will be splinter cells from heaven and hell that will want to kill us," Cas offers, "so part of our time will be spent focusing on self-defense."
Their silence lingers, the sun setting on the horizon a good enough excuse to end what had been an afternoon of companionable conversation.
“We thought - we all thought. When the Righteous Man…” It trails off, attention flicking to Dean. Its dressed in a cream pantsuit. A lot of the angels Dean's caught glimpses of or heard descriptions about were into the business professional look. So was Cas, until the holy tax accountant look got too blood spattered and he had to be outfitted in Dean's wardrobe.
Sam's gaze is fixed on him, and Dean feels a pressure at the base of his skull. He dully realizes Sam’s using some of that psychic mojo on him. Maybe as a built-in lie detector, or just an intimidation tactic. He isn’t sure, but eventually the strange feeling abates, and Sam looks down.
Cas spends more downtime in between hunts. He reads things beside the paper and tomes on witchcraft. Wandering out from the campus library, he ends up in lecture halls, sits in the back and listens to professors talk about biology or philosophy. Gender studies and math. He finds a big hall that shows foreign films every Tuesday at three o’clock. He doesn’t pick up on everything, but he tries.
“You forfeit your agreement,” Lucifer says, gripping Cas by the throat, “and you can say goodbye to your prize.” He slashes the angel’s throat with his own blade and drops him to the ground like a discarded doll.
“A land fought over, divided up, and fought over again ad nauseum,” Castiel says, “it is a place stained with blood.”
Anyway, I wasn't going to write out an entire flashback so instead we get this :) I hope you enjoy :) also RIP but shtriga is THE hardest name I don't know why my brain would NOT remember how to spell it, and I have to run off so if there are any glaring typos I apologize. I'll also be away this coming weekend so if the updates are a tad late, that is why!
Abruptly, the wind flowing through the room stops. “Heather?” Cheryl talks a step forward, then another. “H-Heather, this isn’t funny. I -” She rushes over, jostling her sister. There’s more blood, and her head lolls in a way that only means one thing. Cheryl screams.
“At a crossroads. Heather said she walked home after she reappeared, so we took a drive around and found this buried.”
Dean shrugs. “Enough to let me do my own thing. I’m not asking to share motel rooms and go on hunts with you anymore, am I?”
again, the one that says he’s kicking his puppy or wrenching his still-beating heart out from his chest and crushing it in his fist. “What?” he snarls, fixing Cas with a scowl. The dreams are getting more vivid, and he didn’t get much sleep last night. Or the night before. It’s definitely showing.
Cas just rolls his eyes, stupidly fond. "Thank you, Dean," he says. Dean thinks its unfair someone can just cut through him like that, see to the heart of him with just a side-eye glance.
“I can tear you apart,” he says. “You angels have been causing a big clusterfuck up there. But you’re the only one left. You’re so weak that I could put you right on a rack. Make you scream until you come apart. Until you're nothing. I could swallow you and your Grace whole. I bet it’d make me stronger.” Like this, Dean doesn’t have a mouth, not really. He still manages to grin. “How would you like that,
“Not too sure,” Dean admits, “but there’s plenty of angels on earth. We can find one and see what it knows. We’ll figure it out.” Cas doesn’t move. “Right, Cas?” Cas stares up at Dean, lips parted, no words coming. Dean rolls his eyes and moves forward. “Got you a souvenir,” he says.
“Been there, done that,” he mutters, tugging the hem of his shirt up, jean's waistband down. He takes a breath and slashes the sigil.
“The main group that traveled to this town at the turn of the century were from England. It’s possible, but most ritualistic practices died out there centuries ago.”
“Yes?” Cas says, voice going higher from the strain. Dean starts to smile, and it goes wide fast. He crooks his finger at Cas, gesturing to come even closer than where they are now, not even a foot apart.
It’s bad, he knows it is. Dean usually does a good job listening to him. He’ll drag his feet and groan and complain, depending on the topic, but he
“When this is all over,” Castiel says, finally, “wouldn’t you want to go back to how you were before?” That gets Dean’s attention. He looks at Castiel again, waltzing to where the angel is still sitting.
"Fuck yeah they were." He sits up, takes off his jacket and bundles it up as a pillow. "Night, Cas."
Cas stares at where Dean and Cassie are connected, where they touch because they both like it and want to and because that seems to be the norm in any romantic relationship. Did he do that with anyone before?
“Can’t you?” Sam glowers at him. “Dean would ask if you were too busy gallivanting with that demon.”
“I just wanted us to be sisters,” Heather pleads. “Not this - this fucked up, codependent bullshit! I had dreams! Denise and I were gonna -” She sobs. “Why do you have to ruin everything for me?”
His observation can go to other people, too. He likes them. People. Preferably when they’re nice. They don’t elicit the same reaction that Dean does, but he enjoys it all the same. The librarian at the help desk who can process his obtuse requests, the people he saves, Cassie and the friends she brings along that try to talk to him.
When he emerges, skin pink and pruned at the fingertips, Castiel twitches, this way and that, and Dean smiles at him, at the beige coat that’s been thrown over the nearby chair, the suit jacket and tie that joined it. But then he catches a glance at the angel’s face, and he frowns.
He’s the good looking one - that’s what people told him, growing up - still do. Delicate features, too pretty to be a hunter, less of a dirt-smeared, devilish rogue and more like someone who ends up on his back. But this is Cas, he reminds himself. Cas is the one who likes collecting soft sweaters and drinking fancy, caffeinated drinks with made up names. He's the one that reads Cormac McCarthy novels back to back with Nora Roberts. He kills the monsters and heals Dean, endless power neither of them understand flowing from the same hands; wide palms, long fingers, cupping Dean’s jaw.
“We thought you had died, Castiel,” the angel finishes, “none of us could sense nor hear you.” Dean and Cas’s argument seems to have taken the wind out of its sails.
Cas is stoic, always has been. Dean’s been needling him for months - years, with how time works downstairs, actually - and he’s only just started to pick up on a flash of sarcasm if he’s paying attention. But as the TV screen flits over Cas’s face, the angel looks terrified.
They're in the basement of the house. Somehow, it isn’t as charming as the ye olde New England farmhouse that’s on the floor above. This is rough, cobbled stone, cold and lined with older hunting equipment left to rust next to a few chest freezers. Which are leaking a questionable looking substance. Awesome.
Dean has to leave early to make his shift at the garage, so he gets Cas and piles them into the car. He gives him a bagel from a shop close to Cas’s motel. It’s warm from the toaster and slathered in cream cheese. Cas decides he likes bagels.
Dean’s soul, this deep in hell, has been here for decades upon decades. Centuries, perhaps. He is a demon, no doubt, but he hasn’t existed for quite long enough to be stripped of his identity - perhaps he will never be. Surely turning someone of his importance into a foul, evil thing is seen as a triumph, and his human name is still spoken if only to brag and tout hell’s true power.
Anyway, he calls Pastor Jim because maybe he’s bored, and he hears about what might be a kappa or a water spirit or something in Oregon and decides sure, why not.
Unfortunately not every chapter can be an 8k monstrosity but!! Pamela is back - something I had no idea so many people would ask for :) Do Pam, Jess, and Cas do a karaoke night? Also shoutout to @memfys23 who suggested Jess listening to Linkin Park. If Cas can listen to 90s indie girls and early Beyoncé then she can listen to alt rock/nu metal (and early Beyoncé). Oh yeah, also, something something angel language.
I really like the idea of Cas and his relationship with food throughout hfym. I held back on posting this bc I'm tempted to do a more fleshed out fic, but idk if I'll have time now that I'm trying to write more for the main story so take this <3
Dean’s fingers twist along yet another wire, trailing along its length. His head is tilted towards Cas from where they’re both pressed in the front seat, and Cas can hear the rise and fall of Dean’s voice as he talks, explains what he’s doing. Cas glances at him from the corner of his eye, catches that easy smile on his face Dean gets whenever he’s absorbed in something he enjoys.
Dean has a pair of aviators in the car’s glove compartment that he tosses to Cas, sliding another pair on before he pulls out of the parking lot. “What I don’t get is the funny farm thing.”
Dean reaches out a hand, inhuman eyes locking on what had been shown to him in the light. “Looking good,” he says, and his fingers brush against something that zings against his nerve endings, making them feel like they’ve been numbed and zapped with a static shock. The wings flutter and Cas sends a warning look over at Dean. He grins. “Real good.”
He plunges deeper, and deeper, until he’s forced to wonder if hell has an end, a bedrock foundation.
“I didn’t even know we were coming out here till yesterday,” he says. “Sir.” He doesn’t make a habit of lying to his dad. Not about important stuff, anyway. The only exceptions were usually when it came to Sam. He had known about Stanford for months without saying anything to John. But this isn’t like that. John’s dark eyes slide across his face, and he hopefully realizes it too, because then he punches the radio back on, and doesn’t say anything else.
"Are we friends?" he asks abruptly. Cas couldn't get into the gin and tonics but they're both lukewarm on Ketel One. Dean's been hitting it hard enough that he bums a cigarette off a girl passing by and starts smoking at the tiny outdoor table they commandeered.
“Of course not. But they’re… extenuating circumstances.” He briefly explains what’s happening, and then Dean replies with a new destination - a motel address in a small town one state over. Then the line goes dead. He hands the phone back to Bobby and looks at Anna. “We can leave now, if you wish.”
me do anything.” The signs lead him to a place in Kansas called Lebanon - center of the country, apparently. Not much to look at, but Dean supposes it must mean something, to get started right in the middle of it all. “Alright. I’m going in.”
“Dean.” He turns from his seat and Dean puts out a hand. Case shakes it, looking pleased as pie when Dean pulls up a chair and settles into it. “It’s good to see you.”
Sam had tried to exorcise him, so he took that as his cue to nab the Impala’s keys and get out of there.
The Home rewrite is Done. Next to the Pilot I think this was one of the first eps I started writing scenes for - specifically when Dean tries to call John, can't get through, and calls Cas. Like your absent god-father figure isn't here! But your boyfriend definitely is. Next chapter? Cas's B plot begins in earnest >:)
“Listen. I get it - it sounds horrible. No idea who you are or where you came from. If you have a family or not. But uh,” he swallows, “you’re doing good out there, Cas, alright? I mean, I know we make a good team when we’re together. So uh. If what happened to you before - if you feel that way again. Just call me, okay? Promise you call instead of doing that.” He flicks his gaze over to Cas, who’s watching him with an unreadable expression. “Promise me.”
First of all - thank you so so much to everyone who has read this fic! I literally never thought this would turn into this epic length story, or that so many people would be reading it as I wrote it. It's been so much fun, and even if I don't reply to your comment, know I read them all and cherish them, and they all have helped me keep going!
Second of all - yes, this fic is getting a sequel! I'm making a new fic bc if this story grew to like 400k I'd lose my mind. So subscribe to this series and keep an eye out! I will be taking a longer hiatus this time. I have to focus on some real life stuff that got put on the wayside (writing almost 250k in like 7 months is a lot of work, who would have thought?) so while I'll be posting some smaller stories for this au over the summer, the actual sequel (and definitive end of the series rewrite) will be coming some time in autumn.
Dean trips over air and lands on top of the skeleton in the field. The creature descends and sinks beneath him. He feels icy tendrils grabbing at him - wrapping around his leg, his wrists, his neck, trying to pull him under.
“Already the end of the world,” Dean says, and he breaks off a piece of Castiel’s faltering Grace. Castiel crumples in pain, watching Dean hold the glowing blue light in his hands, wonders why it does not burn him. Perhaps there is still enough humanity, enough righteousness, left that he can handle it.
"Found some buried treasure?" Dean comes over and takes a look. The box is an old decorative tin. When Cas flips the latch open, he sees a picture of Cheryl cut out from her yearbook. There's a small draw-string bag and what looks to be a rib bone stuck inside. "What the hell is this?"
There are some bags at the small table across from the bed, so he looks through them first. He finds clothes - all that seem to be for him, or someone else his size - toothbrush, toothpaste, a few other toiletries. Deeper down, in a false bottom of the bag there's a gun. It feels… not completely foreign in his hands. There's other strange things, too: licenses and credit cards and other documents, featuring his face - he checks in the tiny bathroom mirror to make sure - but different names and too many titles for one man to have. There's rock salt and charms and some old looking tomes depicting the occult, magic, and other things that he knows the identity of, but without any specific memory attached to them.
“Is it? So different?” Castiel asks, glancing back at Dean. The look is loaded enough that it makes Sam's eyes widen, his frown deepening into a scowl. They both watch each other, proverbial hackles rising. The part of Dean that itches for a fight, for blood, for the sweat-soaked rush on endorphins that comes from tearing into something visceral, is tempted to watch Sam and Castiel duke it out.
“It’s a sweet piece of ass,” Dean had said. Castiel wasn’t used to human customs enough to know to roll his eyes, but Dean could feel the frustration emanating out of the angel in delightful waves.
“You too,” says the clerk, eyes drifting back to her magazine. Dean puts his stuff in the passenger seat, fuels up, and gets going. He makes it twenty minutes before he cracks the window and breaks open the Marlboro pack.
He does his best to shake off the thought of this probably dead hunter and asks Pastor Jim about the details of the case in Oregon, and Blue Earth, and whatever else. Their conversation is winding down but Dean’s curiosity is just under the surface, so he forces another question. “How’d you hear about this guy anyway? Thought you mostly stayed in state these days.”
A shorter chapter this time - as far as psychics go, don't think I'm sleeping on Missouri! We just know that Bobby knew Pamela before 4.01 so it made more sense for her to get brought up first.
“More than that,” Castiel says, ignoring him, “it keeps you tethered to this plane. It’s imprinted on your very being. Even if this seal is broken, or your body destroyed, you won’t go back to hell.”
I also had to do some serious Investigating about the popularity of iced coffee 17 years ago, but Starbucks has had frappes for ages so I was like 'give Cas the iced coffee' - also Pike Place wasn't actually its own roast coffee until like, 2009? So I guess Dean's just referencing the flagship coffee shop in Seattle. This was information Very Pertinent to the story, obviously.
Dean went into this with low expectations, kind of have to, when the world is ending. Things had still devolved faster than he could have imagined.
'The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture' is a gender/queer lit book that was published in 2003 that potentially could've been taught in college classes. I haven't read it personally but it seemed like a book that wasn't bogged down by too much social theory that a more Average Joe type could get through it. It was surprisingly hard to find a book like that published prior to, say, 2010!
"I'm sure there's enough demons and angels who would like to see Michael and Lucifer duke it out that it won't really be
Cas watches him grab an oversized yellow bag of peanut m&ms. He can tell they’re high in sugar, and they’re colored pieces of chocolate. He doesn’t know the taste. Dean holds the bag closer to himself and says he’s not sharing.
"I don't know," Cas says. He stands up and passes the box to Dean. "Magic, I'm assuming. A dark kind."
So! Big clue to what/who Cas really is... I don't title these chapters but sometimes I put in little notes on the headers so I know what is going on in each section. This section was just 'RIBS' in all caps lol. Also happy v-day and also deancas wedding day? Good for them, good for them.
They take the Impala south. “Car's fine, body's set, we're both alive and kicking. We deserve a vacation. Maybe the beach, some clubs, you and me. We could do Miami,” Dean says, “what do you think?” Cas is silent. Dean sits with it for a while, lets the car roar around him as he tears along the highway. “Or are you still set on turning me into a squishy human with all sorts of soft feelings?”
Hell was maze-like, an ever-morphing cacophony of blood and malice that functioned on entropic laws that angels were not made to comprehend, and one by one his brothers and sisters were slain, or lost.
But being the one prophesied to end the Apocalypse gave him some credence, even in hell. Cas was nearly without Grace, by the time he had reached him. But Dean was brimming with power, more than Yellow Eyes, maybe even more than Lilith.
"Miami sounds fine," Cas manages, turning to look at him. "But I think I'd like to see the Grand Canyon. I remember the angel who made it said she was quite proud with how it turned out." His mouth pulls, just in one corner, and it's not really a smile unless you know how to read between the lines.
“Tell you what,” she says, “let me print this out, and the computer’s all yours.” He’s tempted to agree, but the edge of playfulness that’s been threading through the conversation and the way she keeps stealing glances at him gives Dean the impression that she’s not
*Dean's quip about vampires being in San Francisco is a reference to the 1994 movie 'Interview with a Vampire'
Grace flows inside him and Cas coughs, sputters, eyes flaring blue as the new power seeps into him. Dean waits, paranoid, but then Cas calms down, looking at Dean with tired eyes.
They don’t meet back at a motel - they don’t meet back up at all. John said he had to finish this thing tonight, get going to Wisconsin. Following the trail of something he never lets Dean see.
Dean walks to the car and gets a bottle of water. Chugs half of it and pours the rest down the back of his neck, the grey cotton of his t-shirt going dark. “Fuck, it’s hot.”
**OKAY I remembered so a lot of you enjoyed Dean and Cas's phone calls (of course) and it was just like, a fun call back to them chatting and becoming friends way way back in chapter 6. Originally this chapter was going to be only phone calls like that chapter, but I guess I ended up not having enough s1 eps I didn't want to write out so! We got this instead <3
They can’t dig up the bones and burn them in broad daylight, even if the road’s practically a formality for all the traffic it gets. Dean spends a few minutes trying to find a stone to use as a marker, can’t, so he digs out an axe from the trunk and swings it into the dirt a foot in front of the body.
“Why are you doing this?” Sam says, harsh. “You could’ve had a cushy position in hell if you wanted.”
In hell, breaking him had been a victory. They had gloated and cheered, and some in the know had waited for heaven to come for him. But he was too deep in the Pit. It took decades upon decades of him torturing souls, marring himself in the depravity of that realm, and when Castiel, the one surviving member of that suicide mission, had laid his hand upon him, there was nothing human for him to save.
“Our specialists can work with this one. Do you really think angels haven’t defected before you two?”
Wordlessly, they go to the Impala. Dean pops the trunk and they grab salt, gasoline, a box of matches. Dean opens the freezers and salts the parents, the sisters. The gas makes his eye water. He feels a headache pounding behind his eyes by the time they’re done. They hike back up the stairs. Dean lights the entire row of matches, staring down at the basement. He tosses it in and the fire starts immediately.
**The French movie 'without any samurai in it' was Le Samouraï, a 1967 neo-noir crime French film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, who was an inspiration to the later French new wave.
The demon, this close, squeezes at Castiel’s insides, peers into his innermost self, and sees these thoughts as if they were his own. “Not so fast,” he says. “You came here to do something for me.”
I'm posting this chapter a little early because I'm getting a minor procedure done tomorrow and idk if I'll be up to writing/editing anything when I get out of it! It should be pretty routine but I'm a little nervous about it and maybe reading some nice comments first thing will help? Anyway more indulgence because this is a destiel fic right? And then - we all know what ep is next, right? >:)
Lucifer tilts his head to one side, and it’s so like Cas Dean feels his chest constrict. “That’s true.”
"I woke up in a motel room in… April last year. I had clothes and fake IDs. I had weapons for hunting. I knew how to hunt monsters, but… that's it. I don't know who I am, how I got there." His mouth twists. "I don't even know if my name is Cas."
is what Dean thinks to himself, once John fires the last silver bullet into the last of the hulking beasts. It was something John told him when he was a kid, something he himself told Sammy before going off to help dad when he was fourteen. The alliteration makes it catchy, reminds him of those rubber bracelets with phrases stamped into them that stack up on people’s wrists. He can see it in his head -
Cas opens the door and he heads inside. “Brought provisions,” he says, setting down his stuff and tossing Cas a beer. The TV is on low, a book face-down in the messed up covers of one of the beds.
His brother takes off, and the few boaters and people visiting the dockside bar filter away. The sun starts to dip low. "Have you looked at your wings lately?"
Dean Winchester is his own beacon, of sorts. A being not meant to be kept in hell like the rest of humanity that have been doomed there. But the signals are confused, and bounce off the features of this realm, turning Castiel in circles.
“We have work for you,” Castiel says. And Dean’s form roils and shakes and Castiel thinks that just maybe, Dean Winchester is laughing. At him.
Cas gets out, walking to the four way intersection like something’s leading him there. The foliage is pretty dense, but there's no rustling in the bushes like Dean expects. Not even the buzz of cicadas.
He stops at a gas station, scrubs his hands in the bathroom before going inside. He buys beer, peanut M&Ms, waltzes up to the counter where a clerk is flipping through a magazine.
“I distract you?” Dean says, clearly delighted by the idea. He drops the pliers, not caring that they’re falling into his toolbox in a haphazard way. Then he kicks the box further towards the brake pedal and Cas thinks he might be in trouble.
He assumes that John would be happy about the additional clue - whatever this is, it suggests that there is magic afoot, and maybe they can figure out what kind.
“You can’t dream about something if you’re awake, can you?” Cas doesn’t look as hot as Dean feels. His body doesn’t need to sweat in order to cool off. His body doesn’t need to do a lot of the things it should.
He holds up another finger. “To the winner goes the spoils.” Lucifer laughs, a sharp bark that makes Dean freeze as the fallen angel waltzes back into his line of sight.
The weather gets nice enough that Dean decides to sit out on the quad. He doesn’t have any research to do, but it’s Sunday and the shop is closed and Cassie said she wanted to finish up a paper before going out, so he decides it’s as good a place to wait as any.
Cas just takes one of his hands and turns it, kisses the dry skin along the back of his palm, and Dean dares to admit in some secret part of himself that the thing he maybe dreams of, above AC and good beer and the creature comforts he can wrangle out from this life, is this, this, this.
“I need your help,” Sam tells him, from the other side of the fire. Castiel isn’t sure where, exactly, Sam got access to holy oil, but he stays on his side of the room.
“So did you two hook up or what?” Cas tilts his head. Being around college students, he’s come to realize ‘hook up’ can mean basically whatever you want it to mean.
If you would like any added pain in this story, just do a ctrl+f search for 'love' and see how/when characters use that word in this fic. Especially this chapter :)
"Yeah, uh. We can - I just - give me a sec, okay?" Cas takes his hands away and Dean tries not to be so obvious about the deep breaths he's forcing into his lungs. They're in their motel room. He knows their toothbrushes are stuck in the complimentary plastic cups by the sink. A pair of Cas's jeans are still in his duffel from the last time they went to the laundromat. Cas is wearing a pair of socks Dean let him borrow. They're stretched out, close but not even touching. It should be fine.
John’s scribbling something in his journal when Dean opens the door, puts his hands in his pockets. All coiled up for a fight. “It’s all set. We might wanna leave before word spreads about the fire.”
Maybe one day he'll get a call and fly off to wherever and that'll be that. In the months between them working together, Dean liked the fact that Cas was a hunter, like him. Getting dumped by Cassie still stung when he thought about her, and leaving towns or friends or girls he liked sucked. But they were all rooted to that town, that state, that month he passed by. Cas isn't locked in like that. He can follow him anywhere, untethered, apparently unburdened by his past.
Dean feels sweat dripping down his chest through his t-shirt, the gel in his hair no match against the ruthless heat and humidity of the gulf coast in the summer. He drops his bag down and makes a beeline for the AC unit, turning the temperature as low as possible and leaning up against it. Cas is at the doorway, watching him. “I’ve dreamt about this all day,” he says.
“Raise me…” Dean’s ever shifting form turns considering. Any other demon that had gotten this close had rendered Castiel’s Grace apart - or tried to. Dean pinches and pulls, considering the options, playing with his prey. “Like this?” he goads, “how?”
“You need to head to Minneapolis. Old friend of mine contacted me about some missing children. He should call you with the address as you get closer.”
"I thought I was supposed to be the belligerent one, remember?" Dean drawls, wiping his hands together, feeling the soil and grit under his fingernails.
Cas reaches forward, holding Dean's hand in both of his own, thumb brushing along the cut. Dean wants to pull back almost as much as he doesn't want to move at all. He watches Cas caress that aching part of him and only manages to jerk back because Cassie of all people is coming up to them.
They're in the northeast corner of Nebraska. It’s the middle of summer and the air conditioning in Cas’s car leaves something to be desired. There’s a long stretch of road between soybean farms and unoccupied fields where people keep dying, and the town that the road runs through seems to have a higher rate of mental illness than anywhere else in the Midwest.
He sits on the bed and thinks. He closes his eyes, trying to remember where he was, who he was, but it all escapes his mind like sand through his fingers. There's moments where he thinks
He moves around the perimeter of the place; a few women at the bar catch his eye. He glances over and sees one of them wrapped up with Cas. Well. No. That’s not
They leave her at the motel room and get going. Dean sticks Anna’s Grace in the warded glovebox, then looks over at Cas. “What did you two talk about?” Castiel tells him. Dean snorts, starts the engine of the Impala. “No sex? Really?”
“Every angel is on a mission from god,” Cas murmurs, “but how we act it out…” The skin around Cas's eyes tighten, pink lips pulling into a frown. He looks around the parking lot, the dead husks that had been demon puppets a few minutes ago. “Let’s get moving.”
The sun sets, and they pick their way across the beach. Even in the dim light of the condos and hotels and restaurants, the string lights and solar powered white bulbs, Dean can see the pink flush of Cas’s shoulders from where the sun had beat against them all afternoon. Dean presses his finger right at Cas’s spine, between two vertebrae. The pressure makes it pasty white for a moment before the burn seeps back in.
“Dad says it’s a poltergeist, but in a city this big I bet there’s plenty of nasties between us to share.” He wasn’t expecting to see Cas in person, and for some reason he has to put some conscious effort into tamping down his smile. “Did you get to spread word that Buffy’s not out of a job?”
I feel like this chapter was a tad self indulgent - did we really need Dean making Cas bend a spoon and also hint that he might have a bit of a celebrity crush on Keanu Reeves? Or a little origin story of Dean's bracelets (and how Cas I guess just has way too many like a beloved camp counselor at the end of a week long session?) Or the charged scene of Dean staring at Cas's tattoo??? Perhaps not. Did I enjoy writing it? Absolutely.
how many times are you going to look me in the eyes and lie to me? (takes place around chapter 24-25)
Folks! We are back! This month passed by both so slowly and very quickly but here we are with Sam, Jess, a Pilot rewrite, and many unfortunate implications. I hope the wait was worth it! I'll be sticking to the Thursday/Sunday schedule again - as always if you liked this I'd absolutely love to hear any feedback. I know writing Sam has been a very... interesting experience for me, he was my OG fave spn character when I first watched this show in high school and I hope to do him justice.
Sam stans I AM SORRY. Jess stans please enjoy :) And to the two people that were like 'Cas using Elon Musk's credit card? Comrade Cas??' I hope you liked that one line of his.
His perception stretches farther like this, and he can sense the angels in far flung battlefields, the demons that swarm them, the power running across ley lines and weak spots in the veil between earth and other planes of reality. But nothing is targeting him or Castiel. Not anymore. He turns himself back towards the ground, and he brushes his essence through Castiel’s, feeling the condensed, angelic form shutter at the contact. Only then does he re-enter himself.
“Just admit it, Cheryl! I died, okay? I died because I wanted to and I wasn’t supposed to come back.” Through her tears, Heather notices Dean. She turns and lunges for his gun. He’s caught off guard enough that she yanks it, shot going wild.
Cairo is a wreck, but yet another seal holds. It should be a celebration - drinks and a night full of pool games Dean can rig, playful winks thrown in Cas's direction until the angel gets visibly flustered, but Cas is reserved that night, even after five Tequila Sunrises and a Strawberry Daiquiri.
He finishes washing up, puts on some underwear, and opens the door to the motel room. The plastic bag is on the bed Cas is on, M&M bag open, the other box by his thigh where his book is resting.
Human Dean knew how to stretch the last five bucks in his wallet, and as a demon, he gets a masseuse sent to his room, almond-sandalwood-scented bubble baths, and ten thousand thread count sheets that he can grab onto while Cas fucks him. Or he fucks Cas. Honestly, he’s not picky, and while he’s long past caring about any type of judgement system that talks about right and wrong and punishment and justice, part of him thinks that he really,
Alcohol is different. It’s bitter, it burns, more than the beer ever does. If he drinks enough of it it makes his senses just fuzzy enough to be annoying. He’s dug up bodies and set mysterious creatures on fire, stumbled across fresh scenes of macabre death by something supernatural, but Jack and Coke makes him gag like nothing else.
Castiel told him that there were seals to Lucifer’s cage, to the apocalypse. He didn’t get a briefing of all of them, before he was sent on the ill-fated mission to rescue Dean, but he has enough of a list that they can blow through. There’s a strange plague in Rochester, a false prophet in Tulsa, a skulking canine creature circling Reno. Dean always enjoys the look on the faces of the demons that try to stop them. The momentary confusion and panic that passes through those soulless eyes before he kills them.
Dean wonders if he should be worried, too. Whatever is affecting Cas is probably big. Bigger than anything he’s ever dealt with. He glances at Cas, who’s just fiddling with his cell phone, looking out the window. He looks like a man to him. Sometimes hunting partner. His friend.
“Did you want to join me?” he asks him as he sinks into the water. His hand goes to the binding sigil on his hip, and that’s when Castiel finally looks away, maybe thinking he’s touching somewhere else.
Dean looks into the fire, ears pricked for anything that's going on outside of their circle. "He's probably never even been out here," he admits.
He grins, knows his eyes are black and empty as they peer at this angel. “Yeah, hi, so-called Righteous Man here, took the fall for all you feathered assholes and now I’m stuck like this.”
He ends up searching through the stacks for an open computer for a good ten minutes. Just when he’s about to drop himself in front of one, a woman tugs out the seat and moves to sit down. “Whoa, I was gonna use that.”
"Are we looking for anything in particular?" Cas asks. Dean takes a turn down a windy road that's more dirt than anything.
He swears he can hear a buzzing of lights anyway, and his shoulders hitch up, he doesn't realize they are until Cas has to lean up on his elbow.
Also - as you can see this fic is now part of a series! For the most part this story is going to be self contained and I just plan on putting up some extra oneshots to either showcase characters that aren't POV characters, orrrr some destiel bits that don't fit into the main story (which is what the one other oneshot I have up is about, so feel free to read it as well!)
Isaac had told him he had to live, to make hunting worth it. The words have been swimming around in the back of his brain for months. He thinks about him and Tamara and the daughter that was killed. He thinks about family. About love. He isn’t sure he has those things, knows what they are.
They go on a few more hunts before John hears about an apparent lead that’s too important for Dean to come with. He takes his things and heads off in the truck he bought a few years ago, and Dean entertains the thought that he might come back for about a week, kicking around in a motel room with sticky walls and loud neighbors before he decides, fuck it, John knows his number.
**Jesse Owens is a famous track and field Olympic athlete from the 1930s. Usain Bolt was my first choice, but he didn't become a household name until the 2008 Olympics. I can't believe this is the second time I had to use an older Olympic athlete for Dean to make a fun quip to Cas.
In hell, Castiel had said he would save him. It was a notion not spoken in words, but it hummed through the blood-soaked plane of existence, a truth forced to be acknowledged as they dragged themselves out of the muck. Castiel still says it, speaks with the unfailing faith he has in the once-Righteous, once-man.
Thirdly, same as when I went on hiatus before s1 started, if any of you had any ideas/concepts/fun asides that you'd like to see in season 2, feel free to leave it as a comment! Sometimes they sneak their way in here >:) I'll also be on my tumblr at schmuzz1, and am always ALWAYS down to talk about this fic, so if you need a fix in the meantime hit me up there! Have fun and stay safe y'all!
"I've never been to Chicago." He licks chocolate frosting off his fingers. Dean watches him suck at his thumb, wipe the residue away on a napkin. “Are you sure it’s alright if I come with you?”
