“Whatever… keep talking and it’s not going to stay on long enough for me to care what fucking colour it is, or any of the rest of it either”.
“Do you know where I can find him?” Sherlock tried again “He still works out of your club, doesn’t he? That bloke on the door said he’s a friend of yours, I need to see him, today”
Sherlock stubbed out his cigarette irritably against the wall and reluctantly picked up some pieces of drum kit. He was nervous. He couldn’t remember the last time he had been nervous before a gig. It couldn’t be the performance, that never worried him. He could just forget the audience and lose himself in the rhythm of the music, adding his own chords and variations to Greg’s simple arrangement. But last night he had happened to look up for a split second to scan the crowd in front of him. Piercing eyes had stared back and his mind had temporarily parted company with his fingertips. John Watson made him feel nervous. The thought that he would see John again, very soon had him thrumming with nervous anticipation, and that had led to his third cigarette in half an hour.
he gasped as he writhed, desperate for friction that he couldn’t find. He didn’t care anymore, sod dignity, he just wanted a cock in his arse and a good solid fucking.
John scrambled up the bed and dove under the covers as Sherlock leapt across the room to snap off the light, returning to see only the top of an ash blond scalp peeping over the covers. He grabbed a corner and yanked the whole thing back and John yelped as six foot of long lanky Sherlock dived on him from above.
Sherlock’s lip curled slightly as he shook the proffered hand, releasing it quickly. He surreptitiously wiped his palm off on the side of his leg and toyed with the idea of excusing himself to wash his hands.
Sherlock could only stare as words failed him for once. John Watson was the opposite of dull and the prospect of sharing his room didn’t seem to be quite so horrifying after all. John flashed him a dazzling smile which released a swarm of butterflies in his stomach and chest.
“But why?” I said brokenly, unsure of the answer that I sought. “You’ll see soon enough” he said archly, “Are you ready? Shall we go?”
“Again, she’s never at the club, a sleeping partner she said, we can find out much more here, believe me, and if someone is planning a hit, we need solid evidence”
“Right Sherl….don’t think about it….I count to three and you kiss whoever you fancy the most….one….two….three…go”
Sherlock rolled his hips, not moving forward, just undulating around and began to pant again hard, while he sloppily fisted John’s cock.
He bit his lip and squeezed his eyes shut as Sherlock stroked his thumb firmly down John’s trapped erection, swirling it over the head and catching the leaking beads of precome. He held it out towards John’s face, and feeling thoroughly dirty and desperate he lifted his head from the pillow and sucked at his own bitter fluid hungrily. Sherlock simply stared, open-mouthed, his body giving a gratifying shudder at the suck and pull of John’s tongue on his flesh.
His voice was low and gruff, a Londoner born and bred by accent, as he offered up his hand for us to shake in turn. The grip was firm and sure. He looked between us both, to satisfy himself as to whom he addressed and turned his eyes on mine, the intensity such that I was the one to break off first, and he smiled satisfied, but with what I could not tell. Could he read a shady past in a face or the cut of your coat? One could only hope not, in consideration of my late profession.
for god’s sake, and more to the point was absolutely fine with it. So, could John simply be embarrassed on Sherlock’s behalf thinking he might be offended?  No. That couldn’t be it surely. Hadn’t he made his preferences clear? Perhaps he had been too subtle and John was wary of crossing an invisible line, then. Sherlock admitted confusion. If John had taken the trouble to introduce him to his father, and in doing so, had willingly endured what he knew would prove to be an uncomfortable encounter then why try to brush it off as some kind of misguided joke? Clearly they'd discussed this at some point, the real possibility that one day John might bring someone home in a romantic capacity who was…not a girl.
Sherlock gasped…oh god. He held out his fingers and John took those too, tongue working over his blood soaked skin until every trace had disappeared.
“Fair enough. I’ll hold you to that.” John knocked down the visor on his helmet. Belatedly, Sherlock remembered to do the same, and felt a momentary surge of claustrophobia as his own humid breath ghosted back in his face. Appalling dietary habits aside, he was thankful not to have eaten since breakfast when his empty stomach gave a lurch in protest.
“In fact, as I seem to recall, you just about ripped my clothes off there and then, we almost gave Mycroft a proper eyeful”
“You’ve just suffered a blow to the head which rendered you unconscious for almost two hours, for god’s sake Sherlock stop behaving like a damned spoiled brat for once in your life and bloody well lie down”.
He sat on a bench in front of an all-night Tesco and shoved his hands between his legs to keep them warm, while he tried to think of a place where he could go and crash for the night. Someone pulled into the carpark beside him and he automatically put his head down, his heart slamming hard against his chest as the driver’s side window wound down.
“So, I take it you store it in some secret underground lair like the bat-mobile then?” Sherlock said with an arch of his brow. He’d dropped the guard again. The careful construction - prickly with a dash of arrogant - he’d so been at pains to display back there in the gym had all but gone, leaving behind something softer, playful almost, with some of the sharper edges pared back.
He expected a blushing virgin if he was honest, some hesitation once it came down to it, not a one-man fucking tornado who shoved him back on the bed and pinned his arms above his head. Sherlock kissed like he wanted to taste you from the inside out, his tongue searching hungrily around John’s mouth.
John had sent out at noon that day for clothing from his father’s house, to arrive by messenger by nightfall, having nothing more than the garments he had worn since the start, our very first meeting in the hallway of Mrs Turner’s. I wondered at their tolerance of his continued absence from the family home, but found he was much indulged in this way and had scarce spent a night in his childhood bed these past six months and so his removal to Duke Street was unquestioned. In fact I am inclined to believe that his father was relieved that he had settled for a while, instead of hopping from tavern to tavern with a band of carousing friends.
He stared at the number on the screen, the one with no identifier and asked himself again why he couldn’t just delete it and forget, even though he knew that was useless, because five years had passed and there wasn’t a single day when he hadn’t thought about him, even if only for a moment.
“All done?” asked a second, almost identical lady, as John jerked his head up in surprise. He handed the form back dutifully. To late to back out now. “I’ll take you through," she said.
But of course. Mrs Hudson may have sworn not to tell, but the rest of her harem had not, and it would not take long for the sisterhood, such as it was, to turn up with the name of John Watson, he and his friends being known in the area.
John placed a warning hand on his arm whispering “It’s okay, she won’t come in”, just as a tentative tapping sounded at the bedroom door.
“Hey there Dad, you working a late one?” John said to the man huddled over the desk. His face was buried deep in a mountain of paperwork and he looked up, startled, at the sound of John’s voice.
“Bloody hell”, he gasped when Sherlock drew his hand up in one long, teasing pull, “No problem, not at all, how about you show me what that pretty mouth can do?”
Mycroft Holmes awoke to the rather musical sound of breaking glass, somewhere on the floor below. He sat up abruptly, and dislodged Greg’s sleeping form with a groan. It was Sunday morning, about seven a.m., and he had only been in bed since three, giving in to fatigue for once, before Sherlock and John had had a chance to appear, last seen entering Powerhouse nightclub so he had been told… ah, the joys of youth.
He sat for a while on the dusty oak floor, turning the packet over and over in his sweating palms, heart racing slightly with anticipation and dread. If this didn’t destroy him, then Mycroft would for even thinking about it again, if he imagined for one second that Sherlock had actually gone as far as to buy cocaine after very nearly destroying himself, whatever the original intention might have been, then he would probably wish he was dead anyway.
Sex with Sherlock, in Sherlock’s house with his brother probably just metres away, it was ridiculous.
He settled in a corner booth and waited for Sherlock to wobble back over balancing three pints of lager in his hands while holding three packets of prawn cocktail crisps in his teeth. He opened his mouth and they dropped onto the sticky table top with a splat.
He made his way back to the men’s room and pushed open the door to see the evidence of his violent outburst still swaying on buckled hinges, two drag queens in long sequinned gowns sharing a lipstick by the mirrors, stared at him curiously, he must look a fucking mess, he knew. He cast his eyes up and down the row of empty stalls.
“Perfect….shall we?” he holds out his arm like a gentleman and waits, huffing with impatience as she takes the damn shoes off again to walk down the stairs.
‘Are you by some chance part camel?’ the boy called from beyond the closed door, in part-amusement, part-sarcasm. John decided to just ignore him, and ducked his mouth under the stream from the cold tap, drinking deeply in an attempt to clear his head a little and dilute the effects of an imminent hangover.
After much sweet assurance of future delights on his part on that particular Thursday in the month of May, we found ourselves, John and I, rapping smartly on the door for admittance. The air was warm yet, and the last rays of the early summer sun still heated our backs as we waited there, my lips tingled yet from the numerous whiskery kisses received on our journey and the kerchief at John’s neck concealed a most startling bruise that I had placed there. The breeze caught the edge and raised it, exposing the mark I had made and I turned to him and gestured that he secure the silk a little more.
Sherlock sank down onto the soft cushions, pulling John with him, spreading his legs to let John stretch out between them. They pressed together, kissing hungrily, cocks aligned, hot and velvety, leaking with precome. John moaned into Sherlock’s mouth. He wanted him so badly, to kiss him and mark him and own him and he was scared, scared of the strength of his desire, the sheer want, to be inside him, their bodies fused together, to fill him with his seed. The thought was hot and filthy and wonderful.
“Frank is trying to cut the supply, or limit it in some way, I don’t know the details, it’s not my scene, to make everything more expensive at this end, to ramp the price up for Doug’s boys, and he’s been accused of” she glanced around uneasily as she ushered them over to the edge of the floor, “watering down the product” she searched Sherlock’s face for answers, only to be faced with blank mask of concentration.
Sherlock stiffened, then jerked forward, collapsing against the cushions as ribbon upon ribbon of hot, sticky semen striped the olive green leather and coated John’s fingers and hand. The sight of it was just so fucking hot, John thought, that two more erratic thrusts and he followed, tension ramped up to an impossible degree before freefall, balls emptying and cock pulsating as Sherlock’s internal muscles squeezed and contracted around him. He slumped heavily over Sherlock’s back, breathing hot air into the side of his neck. Sherlock twisted around, straining to find John’s mouth.
Shit. Should he cross the street, turn back, or just keep on straight? John hovered on the edge of indecision, instinct screaming at him to run, a nagging voice in the back of his head that had followed him across town from the club. He let out a sharp breath as the drivers’ door opened and a man jumped out, white overalls almost glowing in the dark, just a builder or plasterer, most likely and not a shady member of the criminal underclass after all. He crossed to an all-night café and didn’t even turn his head.
“I don’t think so, now get your hands off him or I’ll hurt you, you know?” John mimicked Trent’s own words back to him sneeringly.
“No sir, I assure you, I make no mistake, he’s a damn little swindling trickster of a whore…and you found him in a brothel sir….do you dare to deny it?”
“So” John began “Christmas, two whole weeks of too much food and snow, playing wizard chess and exploding snap with Professor McGonagall”
“Shall we stay here a while?” John pulled me into his arms as the sound of Tom’s footsteps receded down the staircase. “I must confess, I had truly feared you would be angry, that all my plans would come to nought. I was sure you would find me out, you know, but you’ve been most distracted of late.”
‘Sir, allow me to present myself’ said the first young man, staring clean past my protector to lock eyes with mine, leaving no room for question as to who he addressed.
He didn’t know what to do now. It was freezing with the window open, but he didn’t dare close it either because what if they’d come in the room that way? It was possible, they were on the ground floor and he hadn’t passed a sole in the corridor outside. It was a crime scene, not just an accident and god knows what evidence he’d be destroying if he touched the wrong thing. So he left it for now, concentrating on Sherlock instead but scared to touch him too much, for much the same stupid fucking reason.
“You have questions?” he looked at her with wide, compassionate eyes, her distress now palpable, a visible entity like white puffs of freezing breath.
John stopped at the point his temper began to spiral again and bit his lip just a touch too hard. He pulled in a few deep breaths and silently willed himself to just shut the hell up.
He patted him on the shoulder with a grin, as the shouting continued inside, well, Sherlock was shouting, Mycroft was trying to placate, like a horse whisperer faced with a particularly tempestuous thoroughbred stallion. John knew who the saint was, no wonder Mycroft was losing his hair at the age of twenty-four, he could feel his own follicles dying with every second that passed, or at least turning prematurely white. But such was his life now. The one he chose.
Well, it was a start anyway and this was never going to be an easy conversation, admitting to your best friend that you wanted to do all manner of disgusting things to him, and hoping to god that he quite fancied the idea of doing similar things back to you.
“Can’t find Anderson” Greg reappeared five minutes later with an assortment of Scotland Yard’s finest trailing behind.
“No” Mycroft cut in, “that was obviously my initial thought, but the terms were clear, they were aware that I would end them if they pursued things any further”.
It was all going far too smoothly, John thought, until sometime close to lunch break it all started to go tits up.
The frame creaked madly with the motion, the unmistakeable rhythmic squeak of bodies engaged in sexual activity, the sound you dreaded as a child, clamping hands or pillows to innocent ears to block out the thump, thump, thump of a headboard on the wall in your parents room. He grasped John’s arse, bucking up hard into him and thinking about how later he would take him again, what he’d thought about so much all week, his cock inside John’s hot, tight hole thrusting like a piston until his balls tightened and he came, hard, inside him, no condom, enveloped by his own warm, wet release.
“Ermm” John’s eyes shifted uncomfortably from the pre-schooler on his knee and his frowning mother by the door.
He paused at the entrance to John’s building and waited for a group of scantily clad girls wearing far too much make-up to open the door from within, giggling and holding onto each others arms as they tottered on ridiculously high heels. Who the hell designed those things, he thought wonderingly, they looked more like instruments of torture than actual shoes. One of the girls caught him staring and gave him an appraising glance.
“John, John, we need to stop, just for a second” he gasped out, pushing up on John’s shoulders as he wriggled underneath him.
“Then she is not ill?” I spat, “And so you sought to deceive him in the only way sure to draw him back here. I put it to you sir that you deceived us both, you peddled lies and
I opened the door and entered the silent room, a frozen tableau of the debauched scene from the night before greeted me, having yet to be cleared for the coming day. My eyes adjusted to the dim light, picking out the outline of the outer door and I made my way across, stepping carefully around the debris. Two armchairs sat in front of the hearth, large and squat, framing the last of the dying embers in the grate, and there, in one, my eyes discerned a figure stretched out, legs laid one upon the other quite asleep, abandoned no doubt by his companions as he drank himself into an insensible state. It had happened before, and my mistress was want to leave them be as courtesy, unwilling to throw them on the mercies of the street in such a condition, but with no beds to spare they would rest where they fell and be glad of it.
And while he looked like he’d been dragged through a hedge, Sherlock looked as perfect as ever, without a single curly hair out of place.
My own knowledge came from a lazy summer evening by the pond at the borders of my father’s land. I lay, hidden in the long grass at the edges with the express intent of avoiding a bath which many a small boy was want to do. The air was thick with midges in the clammy air and there hadn’t been a breath of wind for days, the sign of an imminent thunderstorm. I remember quite clearly the sensation of my white shirt clinging hotly to sweaty skin and hair that stood out from my head in a fuzzy halo of curls from the humid atmosphere. I was lain on my stomach, head resting on folded hands beneath my chin, idly swinging my legs up and down, crossed at the ankle as I contemplated the progress of an earthworm retreating back down into the damp earth from whence I had extracted it. My attention was arrested at the sound of a rumble of laughter from a most familiar source, so I forgot my wriggling companion, and remembering what curiosity did to the cat I lowered my legs and settled silently into the grass, turning my head to face the direction from whence the sound had come. It was the butcher’s boy a strapping strong lad, six foot tall, come as was his habit on a Friday evening to bring a fresh shoulder of lamb to cook. He would always stay a while, to sup ale and share news from the village with the kitchen staff, but this, this was far beyond the hour at which he should depart. Two pairs of feet drew close, and I could tell from the direction of their steps where they would be going: the shade of the willow tree, the long flowing tendrils best served to conceal those who wished to stay hidden from prying eyes. I crawled on my belly, using elbows to propel me forward, and felt the damp edges of the mossy ground near the edges of the water soak through into my clothes. It would mean a most vigorous scolding from mother for the ruin of good linen, but I cared not, the beat of my heart pounding in my ears as I inched closer. The light was fading fast, and shapes which had been distinct not an hour before were as but murky grey outlines which I could barely make out. Still, I squinted against the gloom, and jumped a little at the tickle of a water beetle as it ran across my flattened hand, so intent had I been on my silent observations, and there, between the trailing fronds I saw, pressed up against the twisted trunk my brother, with his face mashed full onto the other lads’, groping at his arse over his breeches. They did not talk or laugh any more, just rocked up against each other in short sharp jerks, grunting and panting from some unknown exertion (for how could they be so breathless when neither had been running).
“Hey you”, John said and bent forward hands braced by Sherlock’s head and kissed him. He dropped the used flannel on the floor and climbed back beneath the sheets where they kissed, slow and unhurried now, John dipping his tongue back again and again to swipe across his piercing. “You could stay…if you want”, John said hesitantly.
As I was yet to discover, Mr Weston was famed for his premature explosions having yet to get his cock inside a single orifice and more often than not, unable to get it up at all. This only served to increase his frustration and anger throwing the blame at the object of his unwanted affections for the failed attempt, at times acting violently against them in anger at his impotence.
“Fuck off you poncey toff” John hissed under his breath as he struggled against the boys’ implacable hold. Christ, he was a damn sight stronger than he looked.
For the duration of our journey Irene acted towards me as both mother and protector, although barely of an age herself she vowed to defend me against any unwanted advances from our fellow passengers, who she said would love nothing better than to lay their hands on a young, sweet thing such as myself.
Sherlock pressed down his thumb and watched, as John’s naked cock and bare arse whooshed off into the ether.
“Yeah…today” Irene broke off from her flirtathon with Greg, eager to get back on the gossip track “…I saw the house-elves bringing his trunks in, but I don’t think he arrives until this afternoon, and you just missed the announcement too, there’s to be a sorting after dinner this evening, so it looks like he’s here for the long haul”
The restlessness within me caused me to cant up my hips again, eager for more but afraid all along it was too much to bear. He reached out with a firm hand to press me back down to the bed, pulling his mouth away with a final languorous flick of the tongue. Warm soft waves of hair brushed against the skin of my thigh as he laid his head down to breathe a little at last.
“God no”, he said, glaring at a tall boy with auburn hair, standing near the bar nursing a pint glass in his hands. He was fit, Sherlock would give him that, tight black t-shirt over lean, defined muscles and artfully ripped black jeans. His hair was cut short at the nape exactly the way Sherlock preferred it, he loved the way it felt like velvet when he stroked it upwards with his fingertips. But no, in this case appearances were extremely deceptive, unfortunately. They’d shared a rather heated snog last week, until they reached the point where things naturally went further, progressed from tongues to biting, a hand under the t-shirt, loosening the belt buckle to pop the button on his jeans. And then the boy had panicked, backed off, protested he was straight and had a girlfriend, had only wanted to see what it was like to kiss a bloke, and Sherlock was hot and all that, but I’m not gonna get my dick out mate, sorry. Sherlock rolled his eyes. He didn’t have the time or the patience to be some bi-curious, confused, drunken idiot’s boy- on- boy experiment.
I went on carefully with no wish to rouse the sleeper until lo!, who should it be but the object of my most unspoken desire, the young gent who had wished most ardently to talk with me and given a name to my instant passions – John.
“Oh don’t look so dour. You will hardly miss me I’m sure,” he said, fishing shoes from beneath the bed and sitting by me to pull them on. He knew well that I had set the day aside to look through all the papers I had gathered on my brother’s disappearance. There were the dailies to scour, which we often did together, and if the weather held, a trip to the dockside markets to speak with the urchins who would play my eyes and ears for a penny. But John was wrong. I would feel his loss keenly as I always did, this time with an edge of concern that some harm may befall him at his father’s hand. Such fears kept at bay only by the thought that even a monster such as Weston would balk before duelling over his own mother’s deathbed. John, I was sure, would never seek to dishonour her in that way despite what he had said to me.
“ I’m Sherlock, and the ill-mannered dog over there is Redbeard and we were supposed to be at the other side of the park by now, until we were side tracked by this beautiful girl” he paused to scratch behind Dawn’s ears, which earned him a sticky, doggy kiss on the nose.
Sherlock curled up under cool cotton sheets and John curled around him from behind, cradling his body, their legs tangled together. John had left him for a short while afterwards, and he had lain blinking up at the ceiling covered in sweat and come and wondering how the hell he had ended up here and why he was pretty damn sure he’d just had the best sex of his life. John came back with a warm damp flannel and wiped at the mess on Sherlock’s chest, stroking gently, and Sherlock reached out a hand, because he had to, and ran his thumb across John’s soft lips.
There was a brief moment of smug satisfaction when Sherlock was rendered temporarily speechless, as John’s hand curled under his body and finally, finally, wrapped around his cock, already slick, working him in long slow pulls. Sherlock shivered and arched his back, cat-like, and John realised, too late that that had been his plan all along, the sneaky git!
Fuck. John felt ill, but he had to detach, try not to see his boyfriend lying there, who’d had his legs wrapped around him just minutes ago, told him he loved him, kissed him, bit him, been fucked, shit…he had to think this through.
He sat down on the bed, now downstairs cause mother couldn’t manage the stairs anymore, and propped her up again, holding the slight weight of her on his left side, lifting careful spoonfuls to her mouth. When the bowl was empty he tucked her back in again and followed Harry up the stairs to bed, a rough sackcloth mattress on the bare floor, snuggled up together to share body heat.
“Oh, right, okay then I’ll leave you to it” he hoped the note of disappointment in his voice didn’t come through as he crossed to the door and made his way back down to the common room. It would have been nice to find out a bit more about him, seeing as they were going to share a dorm, but it sounded very much like a dismissal as Sherlock turned his back and began exploring the rest of the room.
I could not answer, for I barely knew how this came about myself. It could be a look, the way a person held themselves, an item of clothing, a gesture, a moment’s hesitation in a pattern of speech. They spoke to me, these human puzzles and I could see in my mind how all of the disparate pieces came together to form the picture, the whole. It had grown, this knowledge, these feelings, every day we spent wandering the streets of the city and could feel it in my bones now, this filthy and glorious place, every scent on the wind, every sight and every sound, knew where we were eyes closed through the soles of my boots and could feel every pulse of its beating heart.
The effect was almost immediate, the dark cloud and heavy weight of depression and anguish swiftly obliterated, swept away, like sunlight chasing shadows across the earth, body thrumming with a new found energy and purpose as he chased another line, revelling in the sharp, eye-watering sting in his nasal passages and throat. His heart rate increased, there was a brief moment of agitation as his body adjusted to the chemical onslaught and he realised the enormity of what he had just done.
“Why should I mind?” John was a little puzzled, not quite catching the implication at first. His head snapped around at the sound of a brisk knock on the door and it opened, two paramedics entering with a portable wheeled stretcher and a bag of medical paraphernalia. He stood uselessly to one side while they fired questions at Mycroft and bent over Sherlock, checking his vitals and god knows what else until a warm hand curled firmly around his shoulder making him jump again.
“We’re to leave our clothes outside the bathroom door, they’re to be washed straight away to get the mud off before it stains”
“And your solution is to jump right back into bed with me? If you love him so much then why the hell are you here…doesn’t he give you what you want?"
“She’s called Dawn, my mum said it’s cause she’s the same colour as the early morning sun” John blushed, because he hadn’t really meant to tell him that and when you put it like that, out loud it did sound a bit ridiculous.
The carriage pulled up then, hooves scraping as the horses jostled against the pull of the reins. He dropped my hand and slapped a hand against my knee. “Come, let us not dwell on that which we cannot change, we have much to rejoice this night”.
‘And is that what you will do?’ I said, my mind still fixating on the words of our esteemed landlord, as John sat by me on the bed and gave over the uncorked bottle into my hand, ‘get me roaring drunk and grease me up like a suckling pig afore you bugger me senseless?’
John dragged me away with that parting shot to the sound of her incredulous snorts. “She was a whore Sherlock, they flock here in droves…for what is the price of a ticket compared to payment for a fuck or two with some rich, drunken fool?”
Sherlock sucked in a shaky breath, his pulse raced with fear and excitement at what he had just dared to do “because while you were beaten half to death that night… you already know I got high…but I also got off with my ex”
“Harriet Watson was an alcoholic who died at the age of thirty three from irreparable liver damage, after spending the previous five years living in various hostels and homeless shelters. She never had a brother called John to tell her when to stop, to say ‘enough is enough’, to care for her when the demons came calling. An only child, a string of unsuccessful and abusive relationships, alcohol was her crutch…but you already know that part…it would be the same in any universe….some things are just inevitable….you see John?"
“Well you ‘aint built for heavy work lad, that’s for certain, hands as soft as a girls you ‘ave” said the large, florid woman in charge of the employment ledger, “pretty face though, very easy on the eye, I must say Miss Irene you do know how to pick ‘em”.
Mycroft disconnected and calmly examined a sheaf of papers on his desk as if he hadn’t just ordered what amounted to a massacre. Sherlock was appalled. This was so far beyond the brother that he knew and….loved? He shuddered at the thought that he, of all people would succumb to sentimental feelings regarding that fat, annoying oaf.
The next few minutes were a blur. John tried to stop him with a hand curled around his upper arm, he shrugged him off roughly and stumbled over a tangle of legs and bodies as he fought his way towards the door. The sound of raised voices echoed down the hall as he pulled his coat from the pile on the floor by the staircase and shrugged it on, still with the presence of mind to fish the scarf from his pocket and loop it messily around his neck.
He jumped slightly at the sound of Sherlock’s voice, so raw and husky with emotion, and knew right then that he would never refuse him anything, not now, not ever.
He flashed John an innocent smile before turning around and flouncing out, the little silver bell on the top of his hat jingling madly as he went.
“Don’t you fucking dare pull out” John growled “Just do something…start fucking me for god’s sake…I’m not going to fucking cry Sherlock…just move”
The conversation continued in much the same derogatory fashion, trading insults and barbs all the way into New Cross. The large pub which they were booked to play, the Amersham Arms, was a popular music venue, catering to a mixed crowd of arty types from the nearby Goldsmiths College, and music loving locals, it was considered young and vibrant. The manager was also particularly enthusiastic when he learned the band members included two police constables (Anderson didn’t count – he was forensics), even if they were strictly speaking, off duty.
Her fat clumsy figure flopped down against the edge of the bed, heavy with drink and laughing uproariously at some shared joke with her suitor, although there was little I could find to laugh at here, with a full frontal view of her singular charms on open display. The man, a soldier it would seem sat by her, hands already thrust into the depths of her bodice to disengage those bountiful mountainous breasts from the confines of her stays where once free from their shackles they sagged down low almost to the naval and swinging pendulously. Even in my limited experience of the female form I could find no beauty in the sight before me, but her paramour seemed most content with the treasure he had uncovered as he pawed and toyed with those flagging orbs, laying her back against the bed and hoisting her petticoats up to her blushing cheeks flushed from brandy not from modesty,( that particular horse having been kicked in the face countless years ago in the days of her now distant youth).
Victor broke away and paced the floor in agitation and utter cold fury, face ashen as he muttered variations on the theme of ‘oh god, Jesus Christ and fuck no’ as Sherlock stood frozen in front of a growing puddle of his own blood, still dripping freely from his recently abused nose, reminding him exactly why he had started to inject instead. Victor stopped pacing only long enough to hurl a large box of Kleenex across the room at his head shouting “Clean yourself up for god’s sake Sherlock, you’re an absolute fucking mess”, before stalking out of the room and slamming the kitchen door so hard that it rattled in its frame, way past caring about the noise that they made.
He straightened with a groan, feeling the pull of wrenched abdominals from the force of the attack. (Sort it….sort it now…I have to go…) John’s final words reverberated in his head, mocking and accusing, spiteful and cold… not his John, who just last night had given everything to Sherlock, all that he had and all that he was.
Mycroft Holmes sat, immaculate and poised, back poker straight on the black leather seat. He regarded John owlishly.
Sherlock sniffed and flinched away from John’s probing fingers, huffing in irritation as John grasped his chin anyway and tilted his face from side to side, taking in the full technicolour horror of a bust lip and black eye. This was nothing new either. Nearly every week after Redbeard, since they were thirteen years old, Sherlock had turned up on John’s doorstep unannounced with some newly acquired injury and they had long ago given up the pretence that he acquired them by accident. John would just usher him in and take him upstairs to his room where Sherlock would perch on the edge of the bed while John played doctor with the contents of the bathroom medicine cabinet, cleaning and swabbing and patching him up.
He allowed John to lead him through the foyer, past faces some curious, some indifferent, down a corridor to the right which led to his allocated guest room. John’s hand slipped into his pocket, drawing out the key-card and swiping through the door-lock with a click.
It was all like a bad dream, the air thick around him like time had slowed down and he was wading through some twilight world that made no sense at all. He’d walked back to the room, harms full of snacks from the machine, knowing he’d been gone longer than he’d said, but didn’t think it mattered at the time, because it really didn’t, did it? Now he wasn’t so sure, his mind racing back over the past ten minutes and wondering how the hell things had all gone to shit so fast.
“Oh, I don’t think that was a choice do you? I thought it was more of a summons” said Sherlock, draining the awful dregs from the bottle and hopping down off the stool. “Don’t worry I’ll play nice even if she won’t”, he added, and John just shook his head, the indecision of whether to come or stay seated, playing across his face. He hovered, and sat back down again.
“Ah Ah!” John scolded, moving back, teasingly out of reach. Sherlock whined and made to grasp him round the back of the neck to pull him down. John laughed softly, enjoying his power and Sherlock’s complete lack of self-control as he pinned his wrists down , breathing deeply through his nose to calm his own pounding heart as Sherlock, bucked and writhed driven to the point of desperation by the lack of friction.
John slowed down, almost crawling along a road which, from what he could gather in the dark amounted to little more than a dirt track or a bridle-way of some sort. It was bordered on both sides by a stretch of unkempt hedgerow, and this far out of town the only source of light came from the single bright beam of his headlight. It danced across the uneven surface ahead of them so that the various pot-holes and furrows, so easy to pick out in daylight made for an infinitely more dangerous journey at night.  Nothing that John couldn’t handle of course, but that had been a solo ride, while this time, he was achingly aware of Sherlock’s solid presence at his back, and the way he held John’s waist in a death-grip.
“Come”, he said, “You are vexed, I can tell, tired and hungry also, for you scarce ate a bite that I observed. I have called for the carriage, we will go home, call for supper and not speak of this again tonight”.
The boy leant back against the headboard and smiled. He fished in his pocket for a lighter, the end of the paper sparking red and curling inward at the first inhale. A sweet cloying scent filled the air.
“And you my lad, I was thinking about an apprentice in time as neither of my sons have shown the least inclination for the life of a lowly doctor…but not as yet, you have to complete your education first….. I have some sway with the Board of Governors at Sherlock’s boarding school, I would like to sponsor you, and we may be able to enrol you in time to start back with Sherlock after the New Year”
“How did I know Mr Watson?” Mycroft turned to address John instead, anticipating his question, “Elementary, I can assure you”. He directed his attention back to Sherlock, “When I arrived you were resting your left arm against your body, palm up, fingers curled inwards – and you forget Sherlock, Greg has observed you under the influence almost as much as I have, and however little you took it did not escape his notice…”
“Hey there John…what are you doing back here this early, I thought you were staying at Sherlock’s last night?....Jesus fucking Christ John, what the hell happened?” Mike’s eyes went wide.
“As you wish Sherlock. You will do this for me, or does an extended period of study in France sound appealing?”
“No, dead serious, I’m vertically challenged you’ve just got a skinny little arse, so we’ll just count as one large student anyhow….get on …now!”
Tom dropped my arm, lest that draw undue attention, though I knew it would not. Not here in this bohemian enclave. I was not so naïve, as once I had been , and now knew of these places, where men could go and be together, and not just as drinking companions, I meant in the fullest most explicit of ways. And so far this place had escaped any unwanted attention, from Bow Street from the magistrates from disgusted citizens and those who failed to understand how the heart can crave such things. But crave them it does, and such are the myriad ways in which a human can show love to another. I would not be ashamed for my heart had overflown with the purest spring of happiness from the day I had met my John.
Charlotte looked positively gleeful, Sebastian looked triumphant, and John looked…far too interested.
Why the hell had he said that? To a stranger aswell…it was one thing to think it in the darkest corner of his heart, but another level of awkward to blurt it out like that. Christ, he needed to call time on the drinking, or he would end up an alcoholic like Harry.
“Oh, right, um, if you take the ten sixty-eight towards Farnham, about two miles on you’ll see a turn-off, left. It’s says private road, but just ignore that, its fine.”
“Go? I’m not going anywhere Sherlock , you prat! The only reason I’m out here is because if I had to sit there and listen to that smug oily bastard for one more minute I would have ripped his fucking head off his shoulders…and if I did that…” he trailed off, his voice trembling with emotion, but which emotion? Why couldn’t Sherlock read him?
Shit, that sounded a lot like really bad poetry. He was such a blithering idiot. But he really did mean it.
He plucked a light blue crew neck out of the drawer and held it up against his chest, peering into the mirror in the hope that this time it would look right (he would settle for okay at a push). The colour picked out his eyes and didn’t make his skin look so deathly white and with dark indigo jeans it might just look alright.
“Such a clever boy Sherlock, come see me when you need to scratch that itch dear, and remember, you owe me a favour now beautiful” she sashayed away around the outer edge of the room and disappeared through a concealed black door marked ‘private’.
‘You are so beautiful…how could you not know, how did others not see before me? What power is this that brought you to me, for I swear Sherlock, no man on god’s earth could be as fortunate as I just to look upon you’.
The hall was full again as they walked out on stage. Sherlock had to turn away, bending over to faff around and avoid peering out into the crowd in search of that one particular face. Fuck, he wished he could sneak back out for another cigarette, as the craving for nicotine made his fingers twitch, and the blood pound in his ears. It was ridiculous to feel this way. Another, deeper craving knawed at the edge of his brain as he sorted through the tangled leads on the floor, but he angrily pushed it away. It would be a few more hours until his next hit, he only hoped under the circumstances, he could find the strength to wait.
Sniff the flowers, blow out the candles is a prompt for many patients with respiratory distress that helps them focus, take slower and deeper breaths. It does often relieve some of their symptoms temporarily. Variations abound: sniff the soup, blow on the soup. I don't think this version, the sniff the corpse one, will catch on.
The respiratory therapist adjusts the oxygen again, and considers the portable pulse oximeter. "Might be good to keep this on a bit. And I'm not saying wear it continuously, but use it as a gauge if you can. People wear oxygen at home all the time, of course, and titrate by symptoms or number." He takes a listen again to Sherlock's chest. "You're at four again. Number's just over ninety." He adjusts the incentive spirometer again, setting the target a little higher. "When you're done visiting, use this again, check your number. Have the nurse call me if you're uncomfortable, or you can dial the oxygen down by half a liter if you want."
Sherlock answered faintly with a nod of his head, exhaled, and after a few moments, some breathing and John's slow massage, John could see that he was more fully boneless again under the weighted blanket.
Those talented fingers, long, slender, confident ... Had it been something John was prone to, susceptible to, he might have blushed at the intimate way Sherlock's fingers could press inside
But no one was really sure of anything anymore. The virus that had knocked the world on it's arse really had no history, no critical pathway, no depth of how long and when and what if. It was still very much a work in progress. It was hard to predict how long the symptoms would linger, at the organ involvement months or years down the road. No one knew.
Heading out of town for the rest of the weekend. If there are edits, anything unclear, be assured I'll be getting to that in a few days. Wanted to get this out there anyway, thanks for reading!
He didn't pull away, enjoying the warmth and the show of affection, even being sort of ambushed, but he didn't engage yet. "I have to work this morning --"
Age four, his music teacher coming to the house, the stand and the one-quarter size violin. He recalls being corrected on his posture, on playing in front of a cheval mirror, of seeing approval in his music teacher's gaze as he repeated a segment until it was correct.
For a brief moment, John imagined the satisfaction of being a real, paid referee. Like the ones in the football match he'd watched the other night with Greg Lestrade. He wished he had a black and white referee shirt, whistle, and a yellow card to hand someone. Or both of them.
Again, he didn't give the specifics, the struggling, the fear, being alone. "She was going to call another family member, talk it over, call me back." He took a moment, shifted his knees to rest more comfortably over Sherlock's, to swallow. "Never got a chance, he kind of suddenly, lost heart rate. And of course we needed to code him, and the nurse, and the respiratory therapist, are at the door, gowning up, all the layers, trying to hurry without compromising of course, all of it is one hundred percent necessary. Masks, bonnets, gowns, double gloves, eye shields, and we're watching the monitor because we can see it from the desk."
There's not enough time left. There will never be enough time left, but this is the hand they have been dealt and John actively pursues giving them both the best they can manage with what remains. They spend time with family, close friends, and a lot of time together savouring what has been so good, so right, and so very beautiful. They reminisce, they touch often during the day, and fall asleep in a gentle embrace. They are mindful of precious moments.
"To a certain degree, yes." He sat a bit taller in the chair, wondering about the impetus for the question. "Perhaps this time he'll pay attention. Get help to stay clean."
John had barely darkened Sherlock's patient room door when he was besieged with the demand. "Nope. I'll get you fresh, soon as you're allowed."
I can totally see that Sherlock's inability to actually wash his hair would have been very dissatisfying.
3. Companionship - he will vehemently deny that this is even remotely important to him, but trust me: at times, underneath the rudeness, he is quite lonely.
"I am helping you." His voice dripped with emotion mixed with a little bit of raspy charm. "And then later, apparently Rosie has a dinner and sleepover all planned with a couple of friends, and we'll have the flat to ourselves." With another huff, Sherlock glanced at the floor again, the papers, the empty files that stood in his way. "Looks like this might not have been the best of available choices."
And now, he realised, taking a deep breath, he needed to make bloody sure he didn't just lie to one of his friends, one of his co-workers, a fellow human being who was suffering. Because - and they all knew it - the virus didn't discriminate, and fine was not always going to be fine.
There is applause after a moment, during which time John finds his seat and Mike comes back to the front of the room to introduce the next person, knowing even as he did so that it really wasn't necessary. The evening could end right there, complete in a sense, mission accomplished, exactly what they'd set out to do. It was already a rousing success.
For some undetermined reason, there is someone at his side. He does not want to dig too hard at this. She sees his wounds, wants to help despite their presence.
"It doesn't matter at all what's in there. It's just another way of you feeling superior, of finding something to lord over me, keep me indebted to you."
Dinner ended up being more lighthearted, and eventually, the evening progressed with typical busy-ness. Eventually, the kids were in bed and the kitchen was cleaned up, the flat restored to order. John sighed as he sat down, relaxing finally, enjoying the stillness and peace of those moments when they had the flat to themselves. And were still awake.
A quick trip into the loo, the disposable wipe pack discarded before it could get anything inappropriately wet, and John lowered the thermostat again and extinguished the lamp as he climbed into bed. There was just enough faint glow of the street lamp coming in from behind the drapery that he could see Sherlock's open eyes, watching him as he settled into bed, sliding the cover up to get into the bed next to him. The fleecy weighted blanket was plenty large enough, and John had actually not been under it yet, not like this. But before he could stop to savour it, he slid a hand up to Sherlock's stubbled jaw.
He muttered a rather emotional phrase in Dari then, which brought both John's and Sherlock's heads up tall in surprise. Sameer didn't get aggravated too often, but apparently he didn't like other people maligning his family. "I don't know how ... I want  ... why didn't you ...?"

Specific things, circumstances, I don't want to particularly forget - although I don't especially enjoy remembering either:
"John." Despite the personal nature of John's description, Sherlock couldn't stop the amusement from his voice. "And that accent wasn't at all bad."
"Gotcha day is perfect the way it is." John glanced at Sam. "Do you understand what gotcha day might be about?"
He worked hard, lifting crates and boxes, moving inventory, kept his head down and his eyes and ears open, and was beginning to think that the problem had solved itself when one evening he noticed two of the workers moving boxes to a more remote area of the loading docks. He snapped a few photos with his mobile, paid attention even as he kept to his own task, and watched discreetly as papers were switched, a small truck arrived, materials were offloaded, and the workers returned to the main storage area. It was low-key, involved minimal people, and he'd been in the right place at the right time - and mostly, vigilant.
"It's a different culture now." He took a small breath, hesitated, hoped the charge between them lessened a little. "I have too much at stake, you, Rosie, to risk not gearing up. And I'm not going to lie, there is still a little bit of a risk. But there's risk at the store, anywhere. And we have PPE to protect ourselves."
Sherlock was studying the aides, and leaned in, "If you want, I can give you some ... information on the taller one, in case you ever need some extra leverage."
Sherlock did then reach out to pull John's tense body up against his own, to ease him against him, tucking his chin into John's hair, wriggling his knee so that John's legs rested up against his own, twined and together and intimate. "I can't imagine," Sherlock finally breathed against John's head, meaning it. "And I wouldn't want to listen to it."
Sherlock stood ramrod straight, facing John for the moment with an almost aggressive carriage, wordless, before turning toward his brother. "You referred to him as 'my' doctor." His words were clipped and said with attitude. "Apparently, given that he's leaving - finally," he added with a vindictive hiss, "nothing could be farther from the truth." With that, Sherlock stalked off down the hallway, the door to his bedroom closing with a thud.
Sherlock seemed to be waiting for one of them to laugh, admit they were just kidding, and get on with it. When she snapped on gloves and unrolled a tourniquet, he protested. "Wait." All of them looked at him expectantly. "Another IV?" She nodded. "So conceivably these medicines mix just fine in someone's vascular system." Her nod was a little more timid. "They circulate together in my blood. But they don't mix in IV tubing?"
He tugged at the olive drab tee shirt, worn and faded as he left the unit hospital, sand crunching under his boots. The shirt was soft from use and laundering, but it still annoyed him and he considered ripping it the hell off his body. John knew it wasn't helpful, knew it wouldn't necessarily help the coiling of ... energy, of rage, of ... unstoppable emotion in him, and slammed the door to his barracks behind him. Flopping onto his narrow canvas cot, he shut his eyes, let his arm fall across his eyes.
Over the course of the next few days, he picked up some extra shifts, trying to more evenly distribute the load on the physicians in the covid unit. Daily, he updated Dan's wife, and they discussed the plan. Remdesivir, the antiviral medication. Convalescent antibody rich plasma was pending, although John wasn't certain it was definitively helpful anyway. Feeding tube and famotidine. Proning. Paralytics. Sedation. The chest x-rays that seemed to be unchanging, still diffusely abnormal.
"Yes he is." John could hear noise inside the flat again, chattering, the sound of regular activities, music playing. Sam was speaking, and Rosie responded, then both of them could be heard laughing. "You've traveled a long way. What exactly do you want?"
"-- husband." John clarified, overruling his less volatile description. His word was a statement without being aggressive, and it was followed by a moment of eye contact between he and Sherlock and then he turned to watch Sonya for her reaction. She smiled, a little tightly, but a smile none-the-less.
Sameer's head had raised almost immediately when he'd heard footsteps on the stairway, and he was watching expectantly. An eye narrowed as he saw Sherlock enter alone, close the door, hang up only one coat, and look to find him, their eyes connecting. Sherlock took in the state of the table - only a few pieces placed, others just rearranged - and that of Sameer: anxious, on edge, distracted. Sameer's hands fell to his lap as he sensed that something was greatly amiss. An ominous announcement was on the horizon.
"Mr. Holmes," the voice said quickly, "Just because the odds are somewhat against, does not necessarily mean that Sherlock will --"
John watches the telly with half an eye, thumbs through his mobile, picks at a stray thread on the throw pillow. It doesn't take long before he hears a sharp curse from down the hallway. Ensuring that he is not smiling, not even a little, John goes after Sherlock, finds him tugging at the oxygen tubing, which is caught on the bottom edge of the door into the bedroom.
"Well, as I told you last time, I only complicate matters and ..." he mumbled a few more things then, about being worthless and a hassle for everyone.
"They'll do a good job, you know. It involves a little sedation and is not unpleasant, as best as they can. The testing, I mean." John also knew that Mycroft was already many steps ahead, wondering, probably thinking about results. "And it very easily could be negative, you know." He didn't wait for Mycroft to answer, but he shrugged as he kept his tone light. "It'll be worth it for the peace of mind."
As he paused gathering his thoughts, his eyes wandered into the kitchen again, only this time, he saw a man with Rosie instead of a woman. He leapt onto his feet, drawing a small gun from the handle of his umbrella, pointing it at the man.
She tried to pull away, more so as Mycroft held the door open for them. John looked to her before letting go of her hand, and walking over to Mycroft.
"Hey!" He snapped, climbing to his feet before grabbing her hands again, forcing them down between them, looking her dead in the eye. "I'm not him, I don't hate that you're trying to fit in, I like you for it... You know what's needed more than he does, he's jealous that's all. HE is, not me, so don't take it out on me."
For Mycroft, it was a question of would it turn into a full-on war with the people hunting down Missy. Which side would the machine be on? Could she be turned into a mindless weapon, reprogrammed into the world’s worst nightmare? He gave the machine a backward glance, holding all his disdain for the abomination within it.
The android leaned against the wall outside two two one b, sighing heavily, shaking her head, glowering at the taller man. They were being delayed due to Mycroft’s private car being caught in traffic.
At this Euros thought better than to hang around and risk her mother recalling anything else and stomped off upstairs.
“Making shortie here, Dr John Hamish Watson, PhD and MD, former member of the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Born on the eighth of September, nineteen seventy one. Has one younger sibling, Harriet “Harry” Watson. Widow of Mary Morston, real identity…” Her head twitched to the side, a fleeting expression of pain coating her face.
Aurora rolled her eyes and head, pressing upon her cheek where she had hit on their sister, shaking her head as she pointed to where the other marks had been, before pressing against her eye lids, tapping her head.
The little girls face scrunched up, the tears having stopped during their mothers reading of Aurora's story. She leapt to her feet, glowering at the two
The two spun around together, beaming at each other, Sherlock vocalising a few of the notes he read in her face. He smirked as he decided to spin her off, making her face near crack with glee.
Their parents had brought her to see a child speech therapist, who spent a good few hours working with the little girl, while her parents waited outside, the only sounds they heard from inside was that of the therapist speaking, and laugh.
"Come in Mike, nothing to be afraid of dear," Mycroft cleared his throat, straightened his back and made his way into the room.
Across the city, Missy sat in the livingroom as John tried to put a very distraught and overly tired Rosie to bed. The child's screams and wails painfully clear to the android, who hung her head feeling like shit for causing the little ones to become so upset.
!” The kidnapper spat at the mention of the android’s name. She sighed, rolling her eyes as she shook her head.
While Sherlock was searching for this name in his archives, John took the initiative to clean out the android, placing it on the floor while he threw out the packaging scattered all over the kitchen floor.
"Why, I do not intend to give in as easily as you..." He brushed passed her, walking straight into their home. Aurora looked to Victor, her eyes welling up,
"Yes, really... Oh don't do that... I don't care that you don't talk, you don't need to with me I can tell what your trying to say without stupid words, but other kids pro bob lie won't, and it'd just make it easier for you..."
"Ah Mike, thought we heard you..." His father said, his face seeming to brim with joy. "Come upstairs with me for a moment, your mother wants to see you."
John held the door open now with one hand, the other was extended towards Missy, a small smile on his lips.
"He's alright," at this she lowered the sword, somewhat reluctantly, rolling her eyes at her brothers foolishness.
"You're having another baby... Great," Mycroft cut in, growing bored of this pandering styled announcement.
The android glanced at the group, eyes focusing on the older Holmes, her system went through the choices of reactions. She noticed little Rosie pulling tongues at him, smirking as she copied the child, earning a little giggle from her.
However their was the clear signs of a deeper bond, if either of the twins were upset the other would either suddenly reach the same levels of emotion even when not in the same room, or go to their sibling and try to comfort while also defend them.
Left alone with the android, Sherlock asked every question he could think of. What he found out was intriguing- its creator, Karen Schmidt, was a German inventor who was a high functioning sociopath just like himself, married to an unknown high profile government official.
The older daughter looked at her mother, narrowing her eyes slightly, sucking her lips in before relaxing and nodding, walking towards the stairs to obey, her twin close behind her.
“You don’t need update though… Just say sorry to daddy, he is as silly as you, and dada always love him.”
"She should learn not to go where she's not wanted. Does mum know that you followed us?" Sherlock snapped.
"No!" He whined, tugging harder, "wanna play with Aurora and only twinny," he said, kicking her in the shin, taking both of them by surprise. His mother let go of him, gasping in pain as he took the chance and ran to his sister.
At his words, she nodded, hanging her head as she prepared herself, she slowly began to walk forwards, till she was able to put her hand in John’s extended one. The doctor carefully led her through, keeping a firm but gentle grasp on her hand as he led her along to where Karen lay.
Sherlock hadn’t realised, but John was right. Staring straight into the android’s face, the detective found himself looking at an exact replica of him, minus the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes, as well as the difference made obvious between the genders. He shrugged his shoulders, and looked back at John, meeting his eyes and held out the note into John’s face.
As long as Karen was safe, it didn't matter what would happen to herself, even if they did decommission her for good.
“Rosie! No!” John yelled as Rosie threw the skull across the room. She had been annoyed by Lily’s presence and went against everything John said. With a loud sigh, John watched as the skull, Billy, shattered into pieces against the back of the fireplace. Lily started squirming in his arms when Rosie tried to climb over the baby fence.
He slowly parted his lips, in turn parting hers they were pressed to his so tight. When she didn't stop or protest he slowly slid his tongue into her mouth, running it over her teeth and insides of her mouth until he found her tongue.
Yet when she seemed not to rise to any of their remarks or actions they had quickly lost interest, some even treating her friendly, inviting her to join their games as they saw she was capable and willing to play.
"Oh mein Kleiner... ich wollte dich nicht anlügen, nicht immer... es kommt früher als ich gehofft hatte..
“Please… Please wake up… I don’t like this game, it’s not fun or funny… Please, it isn’t time to sleep… Mutti… Bitte Mutti… ” (Mama… Please Mama…)
She knew that he'd been reading some of Mycroft's books, and from what she had heard about boys their brothers age, they were not something any lady should read. However, if they were where Sherlock had learnt to do all this, maybe they weren't so bad. Maybe she wasn't a lady, a princess after all, maybe she was pirate just like her brother, who seemed to be stealing the air from her only for her to in turn steal his. Yes, she was not a princess or a lady, she was pirate, a pirate queen to her brothers king.
Prepared to retreat, Mycroft tilted his head, ready to cut his losses, to surrender. "John," he said in farewell, and turned to leave.
"We already talked about poles, about the strong magnetic forces. Here is a small magnet, not specifically one of the strongest or biggest. I have a small container of rod-shaped metal shavings, slivers if you will. Watch the screen as I demonstrate the pattern of magnetism and the alteration in positioning the two objects have on the other.
"That too." John didn't mention that, with the low blood pressure, he wouldn't be getting anything strong anyway, even if it had been available. "Can you drink anything?"
"I know, you said, but trust me, a stroke would be devastating. And it would possibly change everything."
"No, I'm fine. It's just, like you said, I'm overthinking. Overanalysing." He snorted, then blew through pursed lips. "It's just, the faintest little twinge of anything, and you're ..." He shrugged, a small crooked smile. "It's hard not to immediately imagine the worst."
While they were outside, Sam holding the leash this time, he did fall into step beside Sherlock, taking his elbow briefly, a gentle squeeze, a reminder, an assuring presence.
John sips at his tea, lamenting inwardly that the tea doesn't taste all that great in the flat either. He knows deep down that it is the company, the missing piece that is across town in a hospital bed, that would greatly sweeten the day, the tea, all of it. "So, the swing?" Rosie waits only long enough for Lydia to unzip her coat until she is scampering across the room to John. He swoops her up, pressing his nose to her cheek, "You smell like fresh air." And when he nuzzles at her neck, she giggles, presses away.
Across town, the government executive issued a few orders that included car, driver, laptop, and the rest of the day off. He sighed, a deep, broken inhale, exhale, feeling very distantly grateful that it seemed there might be a second (eighth, ninth perhaps?) chance. Sherlock'd gone off his radar the last few days, although that wasn't unusual. Most of the time, he never stayed missing too long, so he hadn't begun worrying too much. Yet. He'd completely missed Sherlock's ridiculous stunt on the roof of Barts, finding out about it the following day and Sherlock had already disappeared again.
This was when the well behaved Rosie’s eyes went wide, her jaw dropping open as she looked at the android she adored in stunned disbelief.
“Don’t shush me. That was really loud if you didn’t realise it already. We need to move quickly before someone realises we’re here.”
The two walked up the stairs and towards his parents room, where his mother spoke softly and the unusual noises were coming from. Mycroft stood still as his fathers grasp on him shifted so as to open the door, the sight which greeted him unnerving him.
“Sherlock Holmes. Are you home?” John poked the detective’s waist, “Oh god you really need to eat more.” John gasped as he felt Sherlock’s rib bones against his fingertips.
At first this worked like a charm, until he realised too late it shone a brighter light on his still seemingly mute twin, who was soon receiving the extra attention he had been given when their parents had first heard him speak, much to Rosa's disdain.
As soon as he heard the door to his flat closes, he leapt from his position on the sofa and stomped towards the package in the kitchen. The mention of Mycroft’s name earlier drove him mad.
She rolled her eyes, reaching forwards, she took his hands in hers once again and kissed him lightly on the lips, holding there for a few moments, till she felt him relax and return it. Victor cleared his throat, his face bright red as he looked down. Aurora was smiling somewhat smugly to herself, pleased to see that she had the same affect on other boys as she did on her brother.
"Yeah you two don't get on, but knee tear do we... Not like we used to... I just wish you hadn't said it was just you... I know it's not that bad after all but..."
The red haired boy stepped forwards and embraced her, stroking her hair as she lay her head upon his shoulder.
However, as their little sister grew up she began to try and join in on the twins games, something Sherlock was appalled by, his fascination with their older brother having died when he had begun high school, seemingly becoming far too busy for his little sibling.
“I am sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you, or overly mock you… Honestly, I’m glad you can read Rosie as well as I seem to be able to… She needs a real human to know her, and not just her biological one.”
How Sherlock had spent days studying skid marks after one particular case where his doctor was kidnapped by a passing vehicle, and he couldn't determine the skid marks of the particular model that took John. They almost lost each other that time and the detective had taken months to stop berating himself over it.
“You no need update… You make me happy all the time,” on hearing this she looked down at the little girl, stunned yet again by her attitude to everything.
"But I don't wanna play with her! I wanna play with Aurora!" The curly haired five year old boy protested, as he tried to squirm out of his mothers grasp to join his twin, who stood just outside of the garden gate, watching silently.
They were pulling faces at each other! It started with a tongue out leer from Sherlock, Missy copied him and added wriggling fingers next to her face. It had soon evolved to flipping each other off. With a quick swat, John slapped Sherlock’s hand down and told Missy to put hers down too.
“That one is currently deactivated. It is supposed to contain some information on Doctor Schmidt’s activities while I was powered down. You’ll need her to activate it...” She held her right palm up and showed Sherlock a biometric scanner at the center and a small tip of a syringe peeking out of her index finger, “blood and DNA identification.”
Aurora rose an eyebrow at him, as she leaned her head forwards, pointing to herself and shaking her head.
He looked up at her, nodding before his eyes went back to the things. His father came over to them, sitting on the bed as he carefully shifted the blankets to reveal two identical babes. Both had slight mounds of dark hair upon their mostly bald heads, ones eyes were closed where as the others were open, revealing a deep dark blue.
“However it seems to only do this should it decide that it is able to gain something from it, this is its primal function, self satisfaction,”
“Not my smartest move…” The android muttered to herself, her posture changing as she stood in front of John, eyes scanning through the darkness, making a count of those hidden in the dark.
"What if... You fought me, for dis on earing your lady?" Victor asked, looking past him slightly to see her reaction.
Sherlock watched her for a few moments, entranced in the story that he could read in her expression and actions. Since she had heard that Sleeping Beauty was called Aurora like her, she had taken to playing Briar Rose when it was just the two of them.
She pulled back, eyebrows raised and eyes wide, as she pressed her lips into a thin line. She shook her head as she looked away, jaw clenching ever so slightly.
She blinked furiously, her eyes blurred with water, she could still however make out the figure, the figure of a stranger, and it was touching her!
The red chip was revealed to Mycroft, and they agreed that finding Karen would now be their number one priority. Karen had built Missy to jolt a thousand watts through the chip, enough electricity to power a computer for five hours, but would melt the chip to a fine but useless liquid. Any attempts to access the chip would activate this protocol, or if Missy determined that she had no other choice.
John held the bridge of his nose and shut his eyes tight. As if two was not enough, now he had three emotionally immature beings to take care of. In that moment, he had an idea.
Although he would never admit it to himself, Sherlock was slightly annoyed at how well his twin had taken to their new environment at school. He was the one who had done all of the reading, studying, trying his best to prepare for any and all possible interactions that could happen within the six hours they now spent away from home. Yet it was Aurora who seemed to blend in better than he.
She grabbed her brothers sword once again and made her way quickly towards the red head, lifting it high, ready to strike. Victor slightly paled on the quick change in the girl who seemed to have been... Flirting, with him.
Sherlock turned to face his sister, their eyes met as she she had done the same. A small smile brushed her lips as she nodded her consent to this agreement, before going to take a seat upon the large rock once again, to watch the fight.
"I say it only because I don't want anyone to pick on you... You're different but you're brilliant... Not all kids are gonna be like Victor, most will see you as a weird girl who doesn't talk and hangs around with just her twin... And if anyone was to hurt you..."
He heard the sound come from somewhere else, not her... But him. It almost seemed like this had been his whole purpose, why he was so different, so curious and desperate to learn everything. So that he could find out how he and his beloved twin could become even closer than he had ever previously imagined.
What she had seen however was it seemed to Rose stopping her brother from talking, whenever it seemed like he was about to, he would look to his twin and stop.
“I think it’d upset Rosie if you didn’t,” he said, making her nearly grin, though she suppressed it to a small smile, barely. “But no more threats of death.”
Aurora sat upon the large rock, watching the two boys bash their wooden swords together, dodging each others strikes. She began to run her fingers through a piece of her hair, smiling softly at the red haired boy who had tried to drown her.
“I was under the impression, Mr. Holmes, that you played a hand in her design,” one of the heads said, eyebrow raised.
As of this moment, he knew he had to find Karen, and there was no other way to do it but to ask Mycroft. He needed to know. Karen Schmidt.
"Well... At least mums gonna kill both of us now," Sherlock said, earning a light thump in the arm off his twin, though she couldn't help but nod, sighing.
“In that case you shoulda been called grumpy…” She muttered, tilting her head as she looked at the little girl who was now in her arms, brow creasing as she took her in. “I’ve never seen one of your lot so small…” She said, drawing her head back as Rosie went to grab for her hair, “does explain how they fit inside the females during the gestation period… And why so many of them died in the past…”
Now Sherlock wanted only to be with Aurora, never leaving her side, even less than when they were toddlers, trying to not only keep her to himself but to keep her away their younger sister, as if she would poison his precious womb mate.
He knew it, but for the life of him couldn’t find where. Rosie’s fault, making him sleep on the sofa rather than his own bed.
Sherlock spent the next five minutes explaining the series of events that unfolded that morning. Mycroft sat in silence, looking at Missy in the kitchen, studying her every move intently. John noticed Mycroft’s shoulders tensed when Missy carried Rosie.
At her words her hands splayed, fingers aimed at each man's hands, before the same laser which had opened the bolt shot out, over heating their guns till they were forced to drop them rather than to scald their hands.
He stood up and reached out to hold Sherlock’s face in his hand. Pain shot through his shoulder when he lifted his hand and he hissed. Sherlock came out of his thoughts when he heard the hiss, took a step towards John and held the doctor by the back of his neck. Gently he bent down and gave John a chaste kiss on the lips before reaching out to pry Lily out of his arms.
“I’d say bye to Rosie of course, before we went… It’d only be fair to the little one…” This caused John to chuckle, patting her back, “would I be permitted to see her still, even after I go home with Dr Schmidt?” She asked, eyes begging him to agree.
," she thought, fluttering her lashes at him when their eyes met, causing him to smile brightly at her.
"Visitor to see you," his father said, beaming at his mother. She raised her head, her usual gentle smile on her lips.
“We really need to talk to her about turning her hearing off at some points… God, she could make our lives hell with what she has heard, and no doubt seen…”
“I can’t believe you just told a four year old to get over it…” John said, before forcing a laugh, “what am I saying, of course I can, it’s you!”
He turned to face the two, John seemingly having taken what was his usual place with Sherlock with Missy, rather than be near the outsider to their home.
John reached his hand and held Sherlock’s, letting him know that he was there to support in any way possible.
“What is going on?!” Sherlock scoffed when he repeated John’s question back at him. “You should ask this piece of metal here what is going on! I had it, I ALMOST HAD IT!”
Four days. It was a five when he arrived at the scene, but it turned out to be a ten! Oh glorious days! A beautiful string of serial murders that seemed to be unrelated, but if anyone could see the pattern, it would be Sherlock.
"So... To ensure I have this right, you and Sherlock were playing together, when someone new came along. They knocked you into the stream where William helped you out, the two then began playing as you watched, when your sister appeared," Aurora nodded, along with this, "she then began to... Pick on your new playmate, making a unpleasant comment about them. This was when you, not Sherlock, threw the small stone at her in order to tell her off, to which she came running home. Is that right?"
Sherlock's mind raced through what he had read, leading him to slowly lift his hand to cup the back of her head, tilting his so he captured her lips properly, smoothing out the kiss and giving it purpose.
Missy, walked along side the two men, eyes locked upon the older Holmes, her lip curled as she snarled slightly, even before catching him looking at her.
John was peeking at the card held in Sherlock’s tweezers. He hadn’t used German for a long time, but it wasn’t difficult to pick up words that he recognized, and piece the note together.
“Go home, Sherlock. There’s nothing more.” Greg hung his head between his shoulders, exhausted from running around with Sherlock the past three nights. “How does John do it?”
She reached for Sherlock, who took her hand and pulled her close, with her snuggling close to him, before she pointed to Sherlock and where the invisible stranger was stood in her staging of this, and pretended to have a sword fight with them, indicating she was sat the side.
The question for the eldest Holmes child was whether this would get worse as she grew or would she lose interest in it, Mycroft was resigned to wait and see for now.
This dampened his mood more so than having to adapt to his new situation already had, with his parents sometimes leaving him with the twins for appointments, though this was only when there was no one else free to and/or they wouldn't be gone more than an hour (he now regretted getting caught studying up on babies and their ways by his father), with this only confirming his suspicion.
"Lessons are getting harder now... Just in time for Christmas too... Must be some kinda weird plan to torture the fun out of us!" He declared, as she nodded enthusiastically, Sherlock however kept his eyes dead ahead. "I mean... Not too hard, least not for you two, brain box's that you are and all..." Still nothing. He looked to Aurora, shaking his head, "I think I best head straight home today, A..."
Twenty minutes later they pulled up at the hospital, Missy leapt out, quietly thanking the driver, before opening the door for the doctor.
This was when she lifted her hand and pointed to their sister, jumping forwards before taking a back in surprise. She began to walk around the "occupied" space, scrunching her face up and sneering at them, before pointing to their face.
Leaving Sherlock to read the note, he went to the fireplace and pulled the knife from the Cluedo board, before he began to carefully slice through the seals on the box.
Mycroft shook his head slightly, how his parents could see these interactions as cute rather than creepy was beyond him.
“I think it might be best if I took it from here… She won’t want you near Dr Schmidt after what happened… Wait by the car, or leave… I couldn’t care less, to be honest.” John stood in a stance, seeming to grow so he was eye to eye with the older Holmes.
Sherlock however now seemed willing to approach, his eyes wide as he took her in, reaching forwards her ran his fingertips lightly over her legs, a small smile on his lips.
,” Mycroft hissed under his breath, “He’s the chief council of ministers in Germany, my counterpart.”
“Sherlock dear,” she said softly, “something special’s arrived for you dear, from Germany… I didn’t know you had any German friends… I could have guessed Mycroft had, by his men delivering it but… Wake up dear before little Rosie opens it,” she said, teasingly.
The smell of something burning threw Sherlock off the sofa and ran towards the stove. John heard a few whispered profanities and the click of the stove before Sherlock walked back towards him.
He sighed, deciding he may as well open the box for the big baby. Sherlock pointed at the envelope stuck on the box, hinting that John should read that first. He pulled the envelope loose and retrieved a card from within, Sherlock was cautious, worried that the card could be laced with poison or hallucinogenic. He grabbed a tweezer from his pile of experiment tools across the table and pulled the card from John’s hand.
"...Yes dear, of course... Now, no doubt you little eagles have noticed a change in mummy, less of that missy," she gently scolded as Rosa tried to roll her eyes. She didn't appear to like the use of the word mummy.
Aurora gasped as she felt unfamiliar hands pushing and pulling at her clothes and herself, it was definitely not her Sherlock.
“Well that’s a nice little… Quirk…” He said, before his eyes focused upon the box contents, and at this John couldn’t help but gasp, taking a step back, trying to ensure he was seeing what he thought he had.
Sherlock moved quickly and sat down on his own chair, pulling it closer so he could reach John by stretching out his arms.
Not long after their sister was born a change was obvious in their youngest son, for one he had started to speak in a desperate attempt to gain more of their parents attention from the baby.
“That piece of sh-- metal tidied up the flat! While I was working! You should’ve been here to stop her!”
“Thank you. You may leave now.” Sherlock said as he exhaled sharply, receiving a sigh in return from Mrs Hudson.
She closed her eyes as she spun, thus didn't see the little boy until she had fallen into him, knocking the two of them into the little stream, her twin only able to grab and tear a piece of her dress off.
“If you cause anything to happen to Dr Schmidt, fatty, consider it you signing your own death warrant… All these delays… I could have found her and be back home by now… Fatty is as slow as his body says he is.” She shook her head, earning a disapproving look from John, where as Sherlock couldn’t help but smirk.
“So... That’s what this form was based on… Hmm… I suppose she could have had worse blueprints to work off…” She said, as her eyes scanned over him, brow creasing ever so slightly, “though she seemingly got a few details wrong…” She said, looking down at herself, poking her breasts, before meeting his eyes again, “mine are bigger,” her eyes going to his chest.
Aurora just wept silently as she looked lovingly at her twins empty bed, she picked up her piece of paper and began to tear it to shreds, her bottom lip shaking as her jaw clenched, in an attempt to hid her tears from Victor.
“However, this does not mean that I cannot prepare my hands for when I find a new source which Shor… Dada agrees to…” She yelped slightly, glowering at her hand, sighing as she reconnected the outer covering of her palm.
Sherlock had had words with him, about how he should and should not treat, act or talk to his sister when he wasn't there, Victor wasn't sure what he had meant or where it had come from, but rather than cause a fight he'd agreed. Now he was beginning to understand just what his friend had meant and why. His parents had always talked about this sort of thing as something older kids did or felt, kids like Myrcroft. Yet here he was, feeling beyond lost around one of his closest friends.
Missy stood from her seat to turn around and face Mycroft. She had Lestrade’s face now, only twenty years younger. Looking over Mycroft’s shoulder, she looked straight at the DI and smiled, he had lost all the colour from his face.
She brushed past him, heading up to the little ones room, to take her usual place, watching over the sleeping child, keeping her safe from anything.
She lifted his head slightly at this, looking him in the eye she nodded, making his grin grow. He suddenly felt his heart race at what he felt he was reading in her face.
Once Rosie was asleep Missy made her way downstairs, finding Sherlock alone, laying on his back upon the sofa, reading.
“Yes I am, actually… But when you go to sleep only to wake up miles from home with no familiar faces, it puts you in a bad mood… As for you, it’s funny…”
Rose seemed to be the leader of the two, or at least was the mastermind behind all of their antics, being the only one of the family who could control her twin without trying. However, this was returned by him being the only one she was willing to give in to, to keep him happy. As mentioned, she seemed to take pleasure in causing her older sibling annoyance of any kind, Mycroft could have sworn he'd seen her smirk at him when their parents were attending to her twin.
” (Retreat! Retreat!) The once armed men of Mr. Schmidt started retreating, heading for the underground door that lead back to the ground floor.
The three were walking to the twins home together, as they always did after school, however this time there was not a single word uttered. Victor looked between the two, Aurora was looking at her brother with her brow creased, eyes going to Victor she shrugged, he merely sighed.
When Aurora had found the perfect spot the two stopped, with her sitting upon a large rock, as she began to play and smooth out her hair, looking at her reflection, sitting tall, acting out her fairy tales in her head.
The android paused, looking intently at the little human before she seemed to hear his question, or at least decided to respond.
“Meaning curly wurly here is none other, than William Sherlock Scott Holmes, the world's only official consulting detective. Born sixth of January nineteen seventy seven, one older sibling, Mycroft Holmes, and one… One… One...” Her head twitched to the side again, pain covering her face briefly.
"She's wha, William?" A voice said from behind the two, making them jump slightly before turning to see their aforementioned little sister.
“Du kannst Hitler Hallo sagen. ” (You can say hello to Hitler.) She twisted his head near clean off, blood bursting forth, coating her in it.
“I give up. I. Give. Up!” He laid Lily down on his chair and locked Rosie in her playpen. The children were wailing, screaming and crying, but John couldn’t do it anymore. It had been four days alone with the kids and he had taken time off the clinic.
Missy continued to analyse situations before she was switched off, searching for the reason why Karen changed her mind… or did she? She had her suspicions as to what may have changed her mother’s mind, but could not come up with anything solid.
A rapid series of knocks jolted Mrs Hudson from her chair, almost knocking over her cuppa in her hands. She was having a restful afternoon, enjoying a quiet day after baking scones for the boys that morning.
“No it’s not over, you idiot.” John said but he was still staring straight ahead at the window behind Sherlock’s chair.
“Yes, John. I also believe she has a limited memory capacity for emotional intelligence. We need to do this slowly, otherwise she might overload. We also need to find out where Karen is…
"I know that it was the truth but... What if mum hadn't believed you? What if she thought you had thrown a lot of stones at Euros, just for fun... She had more than one mark on her face," he looked her in the eyes.
” His sentence trailed off in a whisper when he opened the door and found John with both children in his arms, all three asleep in his chair facing the door. He walked slowly towards John and traced his jaw lightly with his palm.
Aurora stood still, seemingly ready to strike should she wish to, however she nodded and lowered the weapon, going to her brothers side once again, clearly content with his explanation though she still kept hold of his sword.
She had the brain capacity of a supercomputer, peaking at ninety PFLOPS, just a little short of the fastest supercomputer in the world. She was able to attach her mind to any wireless network within a two kilometer radius, encrypted or not. With the entire internet within her reach, she could source for information and process them quickly to get what she needed to know.
Sherlock continued to stare and grumble at the android, then, something happened between the two, something John would not believe it had happened if he wasn’t there to witness it.
Just as she was leaving, she stopped at the door upon hearing the youngest occupant cooing to herself from the bedroom. No doubt the reason why Sherlock was sleeping on the sofa rather than in bed with his partner.
“John!” He yelled while taking the stairs two at a time, hoping to find John awake, and apologise before he gets mad.
"You should unt have done that, Rosie posie," Euros said as she turned on the tears in and instant and began to run towards their home.
She walked back, looking to their mother, hand on her chest nodding as she picked up the "pebble", pointed to Sherlock and shook her head while pointing at the not present stone in her hand, before pointing to their sister and mimed a big creature, domineering over the invisible boy.
He looked down before, he undid and, took off his shoes and socks before doing the same for his twin, earning a light peck on the cheek, along with a caress, her usual way of thanking him.
He slowly lowered the book, eyes locked upon her, watching her closely. When she didn’t appear to squirm or shift in the ways a liar would, he nodded. She sighed in relief, smiling softly.
However, it became all to clear to him that along with having two unwanted siblings dumped on him at once, his mother was behaving in a similar way to how she had in what Mycroft had now come to realise were the early days of pregnancy, having read up on it to ensure he was not taken by surprise again.
As he felt her respond to his actions, he reached his other arm around to cup hold her waist, pulling her body even closer to his, when she shifted herself so that she was in his lap their bodies pressed together so close the only thing separating them was the clothing they wore.
She was sitting up slightly, supported by cushions and pillows, her eyes tired but bright as she held two carefully wrapped things in blankets on her lap.
She looked to John for a second, eyebrow raising as she pressed her lips together, as he smirked slightly at her.
Missy turned her head, a small smile on her lips. She could hear them as well as if they were sat right beside her, no doubt Sherlock was aware or at least assumed this. His tone of voice didn't match his words, it wasn't cold or detached, it was like… Like her lady’s.
If John had a choice, he would have stormed out the flat and went to Rosie, leaving the two to sort themselves out. He was so wrapped in this ideal scenario he hadn’t noticed they had stopped verbally insulting each other and had progressed to a glaring match.
Silence filled the air as the android wept as long as she could, tenderly stroking her human’s hair, her cheeks damp and sticky.
Sherlock was tearing through all of the piles, looking for his latest and most relevant clues. Missy had taken it upon herself to organise everything into what she saw as obvious headings and subheadings, so obvious to the mechanical girl that she had forgotten to label them.
“Erm… Sherlock, she… It’s awake,” he said, slightly panicked now that the woman-- machine was conscious. A low hum of machine booting up resonated through the quiet flat. Sherlock stared at it as John took a few steps closer to his partner, subconsciously protecting him.
“Thanks, but you’re not my type…” Earning a disapproving look from her doctor, she hung her head slightly.
“I do not mumble, Lestrade.” Without another word, Sherlock ran out of Lestrade’s office, much to the DI’s delight.
They sat in front of the fireplace in silence until the door to their flat opened. Mycroft walked in with Lestrade right behind, they both sat at the sofa, each waiting for the other to start the conversation.
“I could have gotten here in two second… Three if there were small humans crossing…” She looked to John, before saying softly, “children, not small humans, children,” he rolled his eyes, but nodded. She shrugged, going to his side, “Rosie does not mind me calling her mini human, she prefers it more than Rosie… However that name easier for her when she’s older... “ She smirked, her eyes going to gage Mycroft’s reaction, “Sherlock works too, Mycroft… Well, there is always one regretted naming when it comes to siblings.”
“Sherlock, please come back. I need you.” He whispered as he reluctantly carried Rosie with him on one arm and Lily in the other, gently shushing them both to sleep.
"My what? She fell into me! And.. And then she hit me! So, why don't you ask her?!" He snapped back, pointing to Aurora.
One of Mycroft’s armed guards broke the lock, and led the group into a large ground floor with mezzanine levels. There was only one main entrance and one elevator that led down to the basement.
He bowed his head, blushing as he grinned, reaching out he ran his fingers through her hair, making her giggle silently as she went back to her make believe.
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, let me help you please!" They pleaded, as they grabbed at her, so now she at least knew it was a boy. The little devil!
The two were drawing, Victor designing his and Sherlock's ship, while Aurora was doing their flag, or at least had been. The six year old girl now sat there, staring at her brothers empty bed, which had been made up by their housekeeper, tears welling up in her eyes. Victor lifted his head up, beaming as he showed her his work, only to see tears rolling down his friends cheeks.
Her hair was made from a variation of graphene. Despite its strength, it is extremely flexible and could stretch by twenty percent without any damage. It was also a superb conductor of electricity, and was the best conductor of heat on the planet. She could change the colour and length at will, with a maximum length of her body, though this could also change to fit any persona she wished, within reason.
John felt a slight shiver going up his spine at all the information that the machine had access to, her attention now shifting to Sherlock.
“You, upstairs!” John pointed at Missy and up towards the ceiling. “And you mister,” he gently slapped the back of Sherlock’s head, “are coming with me. NOW.”
"Yes, but you were being a bully to another child... Also I don't recall saying you could leave the grounds."
She tapped his arm, brow creased in bemusement, before tapping in the air in a flowing pattern before crossing her hands and swiping across it, making her brother sigh.
“A month?! Four whole weeks?!” She had cried, Missy now regretting teaching her how many days were in a week and in a month.
She led the way up, opening the door to the kitchen and gently shoved aside the mess. The two laid the box upon the kitchen table with a loud thud. The table surprisingly was able to take the weight of it without issue, much to the landlady’s surprise considering it took two well built men to carry it up.
At his words and gentle touch she could feel the “miswiring” settle slightly, only confusing her more so. However she nodded, gently squeezing his hand as she looked up. Her eyes went large and wide as she saw the doors which led through to morgue.
Her brother smirked, laughing slightly at how easily his sister had been won over by Victor, she could be so foolish.
She looked down at him, brows knitted together, scanning over him to see if she could find out why he was being so… Loving and patient with her at this moment.
At the bottom was a handwritten note, though he had not seen it before he immediately knew it’s owner.
“Running off like that. I thought you came with me. Didn’t realize you weren’t there until… an hour ago?” Sherlock raised his eyebrows, questioning himself and avoiding eye contact with John.
She nodded, though wavered her hand as she gently pushed Sherlock back, tapping her chest before shaking her head and pointing to Sherlock. She sucked her lip in as she thought, before continuing on.
I had contemplated to add on at the end of this chapter to bump the rating to E... but ultimately decided against. Dear readers, please feel free to explore your imaginative minds. xx WH
She had been permitted to return home while training, where she had gone through the changes in the small families living situation, or at least how her new role may affect them.
She sat, back arched slightly, relaxed. Her knees bent and drew into her chest, arms wrapped around her legs as her head rested slightly against her knees, her dark curly hair flowing down meeting the table. She was completely still, and without a shred of clothing.
Sherlock now knew that Missy had some form of capacity for emotions, watching how the machine had almost instinctive knowledge on and interact with Rosie.
"I do wish you'd learn sign language or speak..." She couldn't help but chuckle as Aurora shrugged, her face making it clear she had no intention of doing either. Their mother cleared her throat slightly, "none the less, you know better than to throw thing's at people, so I want you to go to your room until dinner."
“Stay out of this, fatty.” Missy growled in a very low voice, eyes fixed on Mr Schmidt’s finger on the trigger.
“It was just a suggestion… If you’re so desperate to find out where she’s from why don’t you just call… Mycroft…” He went still as his eyes met with the androids, their eyes meeting as she had been looking around the room. Her stare was intense, piercing, as if it could slice right through him.
She stepped back, tapped her chest before bending down and throwing something at the empty space, waving a disproving finger at where her sister was in her mind map, before moving to stand their, glaring at where she had been standing before running to the edge of the couch.
Why was he having so much trouble asking him? He’d known this man for years, sharing practically everything, and as of relatively recently literally everything, he’d seen him order worse things than sex toys.
“She hacked Q’s security and left a note. It’s in the file. I’ll leave you to it.” Mycroft nodded towards Anthea before she left the room quietly.
“Hello Sherlock, you may or may not be aware of my existence, but I have been following your work throughout the years. Very impressive work, even inspired me to do this for you… us. I am very much like you, except I’ve applied my intelligence towards a different sector of work altogether. Also like you, I’ve suppressed my innate human nature deep within, until I met the love of my life. I wish this may never arrive at your doorsteps, because when it does, I am either missing or dead, most likely the latter. Please, do not let this fall into the wrong hands. Signed K. Schmidt.”
Once the last piece of plastic had been sliced, the box blossomed out like petals, almost seeming to sigh with relief, revealing the form of a young woman.
“In short, any one working in politics is too dumb to like me…” She ran her eyes over Mycroft and the man who was pointing the gun at Schmidt, “also they need to go on diet…”
It was the evening of the twins first birthday, the five of them sat together in the living room, mother and father upon the sofa, side by side. Mycroft sat upon the floor, leaning against the sofa, his nose buried in a book as he munched away at some of the twins birthday cake.
Mycroft repressed a glare, watching as the room slowly became filled with the remaining guests discussing what they had been shown and told, people ending the video calls, before the room began to empty, till he was alone. The meeting hadn’t gone as well as he predicted it to be.
Their mother sighed, running her hand over her face, trying to hide the small amused smile on her lips as she looked at her, Aurora now standing tall, hands behind her back, with a content smile.
Greg led Mycroft’s men on the ground floor clearing every nook and cranny, while the brothers followed John down to the basement.
“Ich weiß, ich weiß... Aber wir können nicht nach Hause gehen, nicht zusammen... Dieses Land ist jetzt zu Hause... Der Arzt und sein Detektiv deine Familie... ” (I know, I know… But we can’t go home, not together… This country is your home now… The doctor and his detective your family…) At this Missy closed her eyes, lips pressed in a thin line as she shook her head in defiance.
She thanked them as they left, before looking for any sign of its recipient. She sighed when she saw him curled up in his favourite pajamas and robe on the sofa. She smiled to herself, ignoring all his nonverbal cues.
A knock on his door snapped his attention back into the present. As Anthea closed the door, she held a MI6 classified file in her hand and handed it to Mycroft.
“Of course I am! You just… left! What were you thinking Sherlock? You are aware that we have additional responsibilities now, do you?” John motioned towards Lily, and found Sherlock frowning when he looked up.
"You two are weird..." Victor said, instantly gaining the Holmes children's attention, though where Sherlock look hurt Aurora looked murderous.
"Yes... They definitely are... Maybe they'll be interested once she's here... Make more sense to them." Their mother said, biting her lip to suppress a grin which threatened to burst through, as Rosa snuggled closer to her twin, laying her head on his shoulder, as he lay his head against hers.
Though still clearly identical, her face was beginning to to change in the way he had read that girls faces do most of the time when compared to boys.
John led Missy and Rosie into the kitchen and sat the toddler into her high chair. Missy was doing a great job taking care of their child, he kept them in his line of sight as he pulled a chair, sitting next to Sherlock.
" (Oh my little one… I did not mean to lie to you, not ever… It is coming sooner than I had hoped…) Missy shook her head frantically, running her hand over her creator's mouth.
She indicated that the two had been playing when a new boy had turned up and joined them, before falling back as she began to splash in the air, tugging at her clothes.
She had tried to get them to bring her twin and friend into the games, and with some of the boys it worked for a while, but the girls seemed to see this as a oddness in addition to her silence, and distanced themselves from her whenever she decided to hang around with the two.
“Who is it?” She called, with no response at the door, she left the latch on and took a peek out the door, seeing two well-dressed men with a large sealed box in between on her doorstep.
At first, as he had predicted, she had been targeted by the older children, as well as the "Normal" ones in their class, leaving the twins as each others only source of familiarity and comfort, along with Victor who they soon found out attended the same school.
Then he heard it, the strange sound that he'd only read about to this point, though in fairness this whole situation was something he'd read about and none of the books had said it was possible to do with ones sister.
Moving out into the street towards the Tower of London, everyone was silently pondering the possible outcomes of this.
“Not enough data, John. But Karen’s intentions are quite clear. She needs us to protect Missy, and the red chip.”
Rosie leaned in, watching the android work on her hand intently, now able to see what made her hand work and how.
The little content that he extrapolated from the note gave him the impression that it wasn’t anything too dangerous, and it would be safe to open it.
She looked at him, eyes scanning over his face as she took in his words, it struck her sometimes how mature he could be when it came to problems between she and her sibling, seemingly always able to play the role of mediator, never taking a side, stating things as they were.
"Throwing stones!" Their mother cried, as the twins stood before her, Aurora now changed into pyjamas, her hair in a towel. Their father and Euros sat beside their mother, their little sister curling into their father, tears flowing, his arm loosely around her, his eyes on his older daughter.
“Well… She can quit, and find a new job!” The little one’s eyes were now welling up, bottom lip protruding. Missy was about to jump in and prevent what could, and this case would, most likely happen when Rosie throws a major tantrum.
They seemed to ignore her until Rosa turned her head slightly, looking at the three sat behind them. She seemed to sigh as she nudged her twin. The two looked at each other, rose to their feet, going to their parents hand in hand.
She looked down to his hands, which were still holding hers. He followed her line of sight and quickly dropped them, putting his behind his back as he looked away.
"Father will drive you," Sherlock said, as their home came into view, "no point turning around now..." His sister walked in front of him, stopping him in his tracks.
Slowly, Missy wrapped her arms around the toddler in return, holding her close, kissing the top of her head.
, John thought to himself while pulling Sherlock upright. “There’s nothing wrong with doting on Rosie. Just… less sugar next time.”
The description of Sherlock and Mycroft's costume was inspired by the following : https://www.deviantart.com/madmoro
"Oh, of course not, how rude of me to suggest such a thing..." She noticed his eyes were locked on the bundles, "would you like to meet them?" She asked softly as he had leaned in curiously.
He slowly sat down beside her, not wanting to disturb her, smiling softly to himself, biting his bottom lip.
“We need to do something about sound proofing our bedroom… I don’t need Missy acting almighty because of what she may or may not hear…”
At first he stumbled, unsure of what his twin was up to, but slowly he began to follow her, reading her movement like it was sheet music.
John hushed Rosie as he carried her downstairs to Mrs Hudson, promising her a nice brunch coming weekend, and a whole weekend with Rosie. Mrs Hudson absolutely adored the child, and was more than happy to babysit her for a few hours while the boys figured out what was going on.
“No.” He cut him off, finger pointing at him accusingly, “you promised you wouldn’t do that again. You do realize now we have Lily, yeah? Our baby, you said. I needed you, Sherlock. I almost gave up. I almost… the thought of not having you around anymore… I just… can’t.” John bit off a sob, but Sherlock knew what was going through his mind.
"Foolish boy, letting the lady disk track you!" He cried, before going to his twins side, "she aids me, not you," he said, looking to her to confirm this.
At this Aurora threw a pebble at her arm, shaking her head in disapproval, though instantly realised what she had done.
Euros stepped out from where she had been watching, seeming to have a glare off with Sherlock, where as Aurora went to her side, taking her head as she gently bumped her with her own, her usual greeting.
"Maybe you should consider doing the same... I mean... With you not talking, it'd make sense to know how the other kids will think..."
“Have a heart, Mycroft, she had just lost her creator… From what my sources say she was practically the poor thing’s mother, we all know you’re not very good at handling such… Intimate matters,” The head of MI6 now spoke, rose to his feet, a beige folder in his grasp.
Sherlock leaned in and kissed her softly on the lips, rubbing noses with her. Instantly she felt calm, snuggling into him again.
The eldest Holmes sibling stood before a large projection at the head of a long table, on the screen was an image of the machine in the form she had first arrived in.
“It speaks… “ John said, unsure in himself if he was really surprised by this, considering she looked like a real woman it would make sense that she could talk.
She leaned in, brow creased slightly, his reaction to something that had yet happened were so heavy that she wanted to know more, out of slight ego but also curiosity.
At this he looked away, the mere thought of some other kid causing her actual pain or upsetting her, hitting him harder than he had expected. He felt deep set anger, an inner want and desperate need to beat up the hypothetically child.
“So… Going by the fact I’m awake and out of that box not where I was put into it… My Lady, Dr Schmidt to you, must be… missing... if not deceased…” She said, the coldness in the delivery of her words hitting John, as it had when Sherlock had done it in the first few days of their friendship.
The contempt he saw in Sherlock’s eyes made him shudder, John straightened his spine and marched over to him, grabbing his arm, he pulled him away from Missy and into the kitchen.
“As I have explained, the android is able to seamlessly blend in with any surroundings, as well as turn invisible to the human eye,” he pressed the button and the image changed to footage from inside Barts, during John’s stay there while recovering. The recording showed Mycroft’s people marching behind him, at the back one of the people suddenly went limp and were dragged off by an invisible force, only to reappear moments later, easily catching up with their colleagues.
William seemed to live to make his sister happy, rarely ever leaving her side apart from the rare occasions. At the same time he wanted to be around, or near, his brother whenever he could, this usually leading to Rose being forced to do the same, as the girl clearly was not as big a fan of Mycroft.
"Well, at least we know she had a career lined up in theatre should she choose it," their father said, smirking at his wife who tried to give him a disapproving look but failed, their attention going to Euros.
Aurora's eyes widened as she grabbed her brothers sword and pointed it at the boy, with both hands holding it tight.
John read the note again, this time racking his brain for every piece of German he had learnt twenty years ago. He translated most of it in his head, making up bits and pieces as he went, but there were still words he couldn’t understand.
The men stood by, watching the scene, none daring or wanting to intrude upon this moment. John leaned into Sherlock, sighing heavily, his heart aching for the robotic girl, his eyes growing damp with unexpected tears.
Just when John thought everything would get better, the next few days snowballed downhill. Lestrade called with a case and Sherlock left without saying a word in the middle of the night, leaving John with a two year old toddler and a seven month old baby.
"I know it's ob fee ice that they didn't look the same... That only the one that wasn't self in flick ted, but... Surely you know by now that what's ob fee ice to us, isn't always to other people..."
“ Sonnenaufgang Sonnenuntergang, Sonnenaufgang, Sonnenuntergang. Schnell fließen die Tage, Sämlinge drehen über Nacht zu Sonnenblumen, blühen, auch wenn sie... Sonnenaufgang Sonnenuntergang,... Sonnenaufgang Sonnenuntergang, Sonnenaufgang, Sonnenuntergang! ” (Sunrise sunset, sunrise, sunset. Swiftly flow the days, seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers, blossoming even as they gaze… Sunrise sunset,… Sunrise sunset, sunrise, sunset!) Missy joined in with her, keeping her voice as gentle as she could, as to not overpower her. Karen patted her hand and she took over, holding her closer as tears flowed down her cheeks.
"Shelly, please... Perk up," Aurora signed, eyes pleading with him, he merely scoffed at her, rolling his eyes.
The birthday boy and girl sat away from the rest, upon the fluffy rug in front of the fire, an activity it had taken their parents much stressing and observing to realise was not dangerous for them, as the two seem fascinated and content to just watch the dancing flames, without having to be told not to touch it.
She was still shaking her head, clicking her jaw slightly, back slightly hunched as she looked away from her twin in disbelief of what he was saying. He may be right, but for HIM to say it... She'd have expected it off of Mycroft first.
“Sherlock, it's all yours. This Schmidt only addressed it to you. I’m going to leave you two to get acquainted. Just don’t blow up the flat again.” He waved his left hand in the air saying goodbye to his partner and the new toy, trotted downstairs to join Rosie and Mrs Hudson for tea.
“It’s not a she John, it just happens to have the physical traits of a female human,” he said, now going through his physical collection of people, as so far his mind palace had pulled up absolutely nothing on the name on the letter. He looked up at him, brows creased in a look of disdain.
“File unavailable, access denied…” Her voice changed slightly, seeming more artificial, before she lifted her head and resumed in her previous voice. “Biological father to one child, female, aged three years, four months, two weeks and five days, named Rosamund Mary Watson. Currently in a relationship with William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
He watched her, waiting and trying to read the perfect time to step in, to comfort her. Although she had began to "normalise" herself within their school time, outside she was still an enigma to the little boy, yet that was part of the reason why he liked the pair, they were who they were. Odd, but together, or at least used to be like that before they began to attend school.
She narrowed her eyes at her brother, indicating her now drenched and ruined hair, along with her soaking and torn dress, lips pressed together as she crossed her arms, daring him to disagree with her.
“ Fliege schnell die Jahre, eine Saison nach dem anderen, beladen mit Glück und Tränen... Eine Saison nach einem anderen... ” (Swiftly fly the years, one season following another, laden with happiness and tears… One season following another…) She felt her creator draw in a shaking breath, before her body went limp, “ Laden mit Glück und Tränen... ” (Laden with happiness and tears). The android held the woman close, her blood spreading and smearing onto her, sobbing heavily.
“I didn’t get a good look at you, Detective Inspector, but I found a nice photo of you on the internet. Rosie seems to like that face… So does Mycroft. Dilated pupils, increasing blood pressure… Oooo such… Hidden desires.” Missy said to Greg, while her face morphed into someone else, her hair extending down to her shoulder, “this is her face, Dr Schmidt's... I will stay in this state until we find her. Last thing we need is a distraction.” She said winking in Mycroft’s direction, smirking towards Lestrade.
“Forgive me, your highness, for taking care of your transport in this crucial hour,” John said sarcastically and mocked a bow, “you were both working so well together, I thought it’d be safe for me to pop out and get some food.”
Inwardly Aurora was screaming with uncertainty, yet she didn't stop him, didn't even try to. No matter how unsure she was of what was happening she didn't want it to stop, her heart felt like it was about to burst from her chest.
She closed her eyes and drew in a slow, deep breath, nodding as she released it, looking at him, her eyes softer, back to their normal state.
Was it that obvious that she was having a similar wiring issue to that she had had on the night her mother had been taken from her? She had meant to do a diagnosis and repair on herself, but had gotten distracted by hiding, and then by Rosie.
When Rosa had began to join in with this, he decided that it was only fair that he did the same with her, calling her Aurora. This however had received only ever so slightly more acknowledgement as his attempts for his own name, but it amused his twin so he was satisfied to carry it on.
John heard Missy yelling out loud, and clicks of various firearm’s safety going off. The doctor opened his eyes, seeing at least six rifles pointed at them, the others still hidden in the shadows. He felt a slight movement behind him and heard Sherlock whispering unintelligible words.
"I'm home," to anyone who was there. He stood silently for a few moments, hearing soft voices from one of the upstairs rooms, along with odd noises that he didn't immediately recognise, he hadn't heard them in his home before.
Sherlock thought, before he shouted for John, only to hear a soft cooing from the now open flat door. Rosie was in John’s arms, smiling at the android and struggling to leap towards it. John felt the wriggling and held the toddler out, reaching towards the android.
She grasped hold of his hand, and the two rushed off towards the small stream which flowed by their home, neither noticing their four year old sister follow after them.
Her brother took the distraction and struck his sword hand hard, disarming him with ease as he held the tip of his weapon to his throat.
The only thing that was now causing their parents concern now was that the two seemed to be mute, hardly even crying.
Missy shot him a look, the same snarl appearing on her lips as when Mycroft was speaking, or just generally in the room. She put her fists on her hips, turning to face him.
"Victor Trevor, I was gonna ask if I could play with you, I've seen you two play together and... I like pirates too," he said, smirking slightly at the sword, drawing his own to show he was telling the truth.
John rose to his feet, picking up his daughter, carrying the screaming child straight upstairs, giving a look to his partner, Sherlock got to his feet and followed, leaving Missy alone.
John spent the next hour hushing Rosie to sleep, pacing around the kitchen before rejoining the group, unaware that Missy had been watching them, biting her lip. When she could sense only Rosie’s eyes on her, she waved, mouthing ‘night night’, earning a small tired wave from the child as her father carried her out the room.
“Is it a computer?” He asked, offering what to him seemed a fairly reasonable observation considering he’d just been woken up over a buzzing, possibly vibrating… A slight blush filled his cheeks, his eyes going to the other man, relieved that his attention seemed to be upon the item on the table.
Missy was more advanced than any technology available at the time. She could morph into anyone, as long as there was enough photograph references, or if she could analyse the person up close for at least two seconds.
“Is she ok?” Missy asked, slowly standing to her full height, eyes filled with concern for her beloved child.
This usually seemed to be initiated by William, who either dragged along or was followed by Rose, wanting both of his siblings attention. Although less than a year old the twins personalities shone through, the only way to tell them apart really due to their still near identical appearance.
John couldn’t help but roll his eyes at this, his attention going to the reason he had been so rudely awaken.
"We've been together forever, why wouldn't we get on? We have another brother and sister though... He can be alright, when he's not being an arse," he said, making his sister bite her lip to suppress a laugh at him using a "naughty" word, "but our little sister... She's..."
No one was going to ask how Sherlock figured that much out from just a skidmark, just to avoid his ‘people see but do not observe’ lecture, but John knew full well how.
At this she stopped, turning to face him, seeing that he was looking down. She looked at her reflection, tilting her head before nodding.
Missy ran into the back room, found the metal door going down to the basement, she had downloaded the schematics of the building so she knew where the best place to keep a hostage.
Aurora's eyes widened as she felt him shift in ways he'd never done in previous pecks they'd shared. She swallowed hard before she lifted her trembling hand up, copying his as she pulled him closer, turning her head the other way.
“Put the child down, and step away from her, now!” Mycroft was now standing next to the man, pointing the gun to his head. Sherlock pushed the gun down towards the floor, staring at his brother while John picked Rosie up, bringing the now wailing toddler into the room.
“He’s not here. You came to the scene alone four days ago… Oh Jesus, Sherlock! You actually thought John was here! I thought you were just mumbling to yourself all the while!” An exasperated sigh left Greg lungs as he slapped his palm on his forehead and held it there.
She looked to him, nodding ever so slightly as she rose to her feet, walking over to Sherlock, eyebrow raised.
He inwardly scolded himself. Yet, machine or not she looked real enough and was prodding at herself as she looked at his man.
"Do you even listen to yourself?" Sherlock let John pull him to his feet anyway. "Next you'll be making comments about safety in numbers and circling the wagons."
His smirk was in realisation that she knew he was considering giving token agreement then skating by this assignment. "Mike. Med school buddy." His brow furrowed, knowing Mike would likely be busy. But the phone call was the point which was ... okay. "And my sister, I guess."
"Yeah, well, I try. Especially in front of Rosie anyway." Also teasing, John made a pointless reach toward the empty plate and faked being disappointed that he was too late. "And my middle name, Hamish...  I don't think Hamish has a meaning."
"Borrowed cabin up north somewhere. A cottage, one of John's friends or something." Molly is uneasy and vague. He squints at her as a means to checking out her story and she blushes, looks away.
"Yes, I miss you when you're gone so much." There was another teasing smirk, one that lasted a long time. "And you know, after the ninety-seventh day in a row of you working." John had been working going on six weeks now for four days on, three days off, usually.
The older couple keeps walking, sturdy shoes crunching on the gravel path, their smiles also kind and shared on the journey of their own. Their hand-holding remains, a symbol of togetherness, of the innate attraction, their connection. It represents their choices, their promises, their commitment. They don’t even have to think about it as they hold hands while walking, their statement, this second nature behaviour. It is their affinity, their natural expression of their attraction, their belonging, one to the other. Seeking, finding. Comforting, comforted.
“Well I must say you had a small stroke of luck when you met my son today, let me introduce myself, I’m Doctor William Holmes, Physician, of Harley Street”
“Lady Watson…forgive my intrusion”, he gasped, bowing to the lady at my side, “Master Watson and Master Holmes”, he went on, “You are wanted in the library….My apologies sir”, he bowed a little to John this time, “Your father has requested that before you dine you must speak with him first”.
“Stop....I will hear no more…Sir”, I turned first to Mr V, “I am indebted to you for your kindness and assistance…I was not in control of myself and am grateful for your timely intervention….John, “I turned again, “If you choose Mary I will not stand in your way…It is an advantageous match…and I will remain your friend always, for you saved me, and for that I will love you always”.
He would have known in heartbeat if John were still here in this room, his presence filling up every available space, a pull at his very core, but the emptiness was suffocating and John was his oxygen, he needed him to breathe. He had gone, he was sure, left him, driven away by the incontrovertible truth.
“John said just go straight in, don’t wait for anyone to answer the door cause he can’t hear shit in there with the crap music Harry put on” Mike laughed and reached by him to open the door, giving him a gentle nudge over the threshold into the cosy hall.
“Hmm” John hummed in approval, “as tempting as that sounds, and it does, believe me, we need to be ready in half an hour” he pulled away reluctantly, nipples dark and hard from where Sherlock had pinched them.
It felt wrong. John shifted uncomfortably, overcome by a weird sense of guilt, and pushed her hand off his chest, digging in his pocket for his phone as an excuse to step away.
He walks across to her desk, completely devoid of anything school-related and picks up his jacket and keys.
They all nodded and murmured. Sherlock would have to get his pretty little arse over here as soon as possible to scare them all off. The thought made him laugh to himself when he finally wandered back out to the bar.
“Make of it what you will…my private affairs are none of your fucking business…and besides, you haven’t a single shred evidence”
“In Florida” Mabel began, and Sherlock let out a shaky exhale, a new life in America didn’t sound too bad and Mrs Hudson had often expressed a burning desire to live abroad, not that she would of course, being the very bones of Baker Street.
Only two hours ago he had been cocooned in soft, velvety warmth, roused into consciousness by steady puffs of warm breath on the back of his neck. It had taken a minute or so to orient himself as he blinked his sleep-blurred eyes, peering at the unfamiliar surroundings. Sherlock’s house. In Sherlock’s bed, naked, no duvet, so why the hell was he so warm? The reason of course, had been the fact that he was completely draped in a Sherlock blanket, squashed on his stomach, face smushed into the pillows, pinned by a surprisingly heavy body draped almost completely over his back, star-fished inelegantly across the bed.
A glow spread through his chest. In another time and place perhaps, he’d kill to have Sherlock say his name like that, with that tiny, exasperated, slightly pleading edge to it. It felt as if they’d been doing this for years. “You’re almost there,” he said in encouragement, “just have a guess.”
“I take it back…change it back please….I’ll take everything, getting shot in Afghanistan…all the rows with Harry….Mary….everything….just not him….please….I can’t let that happen to him” he was pleading now, the sound of Sherlock’s rapid shallow breaths as he lay passed-out on the bed echoed in his ears.
Sherlock stretched out his arms and stifled a yawn, bones clicking in his elbows, before hunching back down in front of the flickering screen. He logged out of the website and closed the laptop down. “Dalton Road, that’s where the big fire is, so that’s where we need to go. Billy will meet us there, well as close as he’s willing to get with the high police presence”.
“What?...” he shook his head, all stuffed with cotton wool, brain-fog, as clumsy fingers reached for the phone.
He was about mid-twenties John guessed, with dark auburn hair, already receding at the temples and a longer, more pointed nose which he was currently looking down in a distinctly condescending way, as if John was a particularly unpleasant smell.
“Can I have your attention please” her soft Scottish brogue belied the steel and authority in her tone and the room immediately fell silent as hundreds of eyes turned to watch the new boy climb the steps to the stool and stand expectantly, looking out over the room, a cool confident gaze sweeping over and assessing the faces staring back at him. He was, quite frankly, gorgeous, John thought.
His age shouldn’t matter, it was less than two years, but he was thinking in terms of relationships while she still thought he was just a friend, even so it should still be irrelevant.
It was now 7.15 and John had done every possible thing he could think of to fill in the intervening hours, but his nerves were jangling once again. He wanted to wait until the last possible minute to dress, because at this rate he was sure he would sweat through any outfit in seconds even after half a can of deodorant. John was seriously considering another quick shower in a mild state of panic when his phone rang out from the bedside table An unfamiliar voice called out, brisk and efficient.
Not far enough. He swung back again, building up momentum like the rhythmic swing of the pendulum, and in a leap of faith or of recklessness, his hands parted company with the lip of the sill, his body twisting through the air to land with a clatter on the scullery roof. It sent broken shards of slate skittering down into the yard. A dog down the street began to bark at the noise. John crouched, cat-like and panting hard, waiting for the animal to calm before drawing himself up to his fullest height once more. He stretched out his arms to me, and beckoned. “Sherlock, come!”
The truth was, it was worth it just to feel Sherlock’s arms tighten around his waist again and his breath, heavy against the side of his neck and face. The air rushed past his ears and blew the short, blond hair back from his face as they climbed higher and picked up speed, the rushing snowflakes turning black against the night sky. They rushed past a window, at least five storey’s up on North Tower, and there, reflected in the leaded panes were the shadowy shapes of two birds, a small one in front and a larger one pressed in close behind.
John smiled in return, hearing Rosie's pleased exclamations and Sherlock's voiced approval. "There's a contingency, in case either of you hated the idea, but I was kind of hoping ..."
Which put John a little on egg-shells later that evening, after light meals, catching up on rest, and Sherlock wordlessly - and somewhat with attitude - swallowed dry the evening dose of his anticoagulant. John nearly bit his tongue at that, hoping that Sherlock didn't do something else unplanned like choke on a dry pill that got stuck sideways. The telly droned on a bit, until Sherlock declared John's yawning "dreadfully annoying" and insisted it was bedtime.
Mrs. Hudson had arrived in plenty of time to mind Rosie while John, Sherlock, and Sameer went on their outing. A brief tube ride, a few blocks' walk, and shortly they were ushered into an office. As they'd done previously, they sat opposite a small table and a smiling young woman.
The report from the interventional radiologist is ... disappointingly without much information. "We'll keep going. And look again tomorrow." He mentions that they have again used some direct bursts of the medication directly into the clot as they have it under fluoro, which he tells John can often help and set the stage for the infusion to make some progress, interrupt the fibrin processes, so it was not a waste of time to come back down.
John thanks her profusely from both of them, then smiles affirmatively and she returns it, wishing them both the best. The flat is still and heavy after the door closes, and he takes Sherlock's hand. "Nervous?"
It was easy enough, later, to find out from one of the nurses who attended him overnight, that he'd been the sole survivor of the ambush, the attack. Although he knew it was likely his own disordered thinking, it occurred to him that he'd been taken out of the action and as a result, unable to help, unable to render aid, unable to save even one of the men in his squad who'd depended on him. Who'd trusted him to take care of them.
Without sighing audibly, John patted Sherlock's hand again, reassuringly. "They're done. Went great. Sinus rhythm. We'll talk more when you're ... yourself."
"I guess I should put that back on?" Sherlock finally asks in the dark room, the question more of a disappointing observation.
Sherlock, quite well within arms reach of the cake, reached out to pluck out a few others, and between he and Rosie (with John grabbing the final lit candle) they rescued the cake from the perils of hot wax and oral bacterial contamination.
A cloud passes behind Sherlock's eyes, stays there, and John knows that Sherlock has something to say so he waits.
It was somewhat to Sherlock's credit that he didn't try to hide his absolute shock at that third option. "In case you're wondering," he finally said, aloof, "I was called both oppositional and defiant by many therapists, educators, and psychiatrists from about age eight."
"Show me," Mrs. Hudson said as Sameer took the book from her. They'd been talking about Afghanistan, and food, and Sameer had been reminiscing about something he used to enjoy, a dish his mother used to make, and in the telling, he'd recalled the book that Sherlock had ordered a while ago. "What shall we make for dinner?"
Greg cast a frustrated glance at the constables who had their hands full assuring scene safety. The assailant, already hauled off for processing. The location, something of a mess after a scuffle, a burglary gone awry with a definite drug-dealing and drug-seeking component, uncertain motivation, and then more. To top it off, they'd run across some young, overly tall impertinent rascal of a kid with big feet, cheekbones that he hadn't quite grown into, and an even bigger attitude. Impaired, almost assuredly. Had to be. Pointing out connections that were so improbable that initially, Greg had been inclined to discount everything he was saying. Until one of his deductions was uncovered and proven true. And another implication, confirmed. And it was uniquely intelligent, almost brilliant, despite the complete lack of tact.
The look Sherlock pinned on him would have been frightening if John didn't know better, that Sherlock meant him no harm. "What are you saying: Bribery? Extortion? Hostage-taking?" Sherlock growled, though he did frown at how the youngsters had figured their solution out rather peaceably.
"It's okay. There will always be criticism or something. It doesn't bother me, exactly." John tried to downplay it.
For as much as Sherlock John and Rosie can provide for Sameer, there is still something sort of specific that they can't exactly give him. Molly is summoned.
"Thinking we'll be heading to the A&E." John spoke quietly to Sherlock, and Sam simply lay there, trying to curl up, really not paying attention anyway. He mouthed the word 'appendix' and Sherlock nodded.
The resultant swallow was loud in the room, and John's dry mouth mocked him. Better to share and give the situation severity and meaning, or keep it to himself and fester. Even though he could never actually turn the thoughts completely off, he'd chosen to distract, avoid, project, and deny the issues by keeping conversation deliberately, painfully, on any other subject. It had run the gamut between holiday plans, the weather, conspiracies about frankly ridiculous claims from the US, and their futures. Distant plans like retiring, Rosie's university education, and other very remote ideas. Of course, Sherlock had seen through it, watching, listening, sensing.
"Chickens, sheep, and cows are expensive, though," John said carefully. "Not only to purchase, but to house and feed them." He pushed back from the table then as Rosie came back over holding her blanket and a book. "Are there other things you can think of that would be more like teaching someone to fish?" John snuggled with Rosie but did not interrupt their discussion, and she thumbed through the book while tucked under his chin.
"John Watson," he said by way of introduction, holding out a hand. "This is Sherlock Holmes. Our family: Sameer, and Rosie." They'd chosen this as the simplest way to explain things without getting too complicated.
"As if. Just ..." Sherlock glanced up, the frustration within building, and John thought perhaps another tirade was coming.
John second-guessed himself all the way to his tiny bedsit, Sherlock leading the way like a hyper dog on an imaginary leash, pulling him quickly as he forged ahead - and at times lagging behind, figuratively sniffing at something that caught his interest as they walked.
John couldn't stop the somewhat surprised snicker. "He's your uncle. You don't need to call a meeting to talk to him."
The officer mumbled something of his own into his radio, Sherlock couldn't tell as his ears were buzzing some, his vision blurred and shaky. "Come on, you." There was tugging and lifting, and Sherlock was surprised that the officer had split into two and there was a waiting car, lights flashing. He considered shaking them off, running away and didn't think for a moment that he couldn't do it if he wanted. Instead, he thought that he was too tired to argue, to escape. "What's the point." The garbled words were nonsensical.
John, whose umbrellas usually came from the lost and found bin at work, wondered what constituted a “regular” umbrella, and silently marveled at the idea of a bespoke one at that.  He decided Mycroft’s “irregular” umbrellas were useful for more than just sudden rainstorms.
“I’m telling you, Mike.  The song is perfect, oh and the way Sherlock DANCED!  I’ve never seen anything like that either, it was raw, it was passionate, it was perfect!  Call me back when you get this.”
Mycroft stopped in and tried to get John to go home.  “There’s nothing you can do here, he’ll be unconscious when he gets out of surgery, and the medical team here can take care of him.  If you wanted, we could helicopter you back to Wight and you could finish your mini-break with Dr. Sawyer.”
“Not food shopping, you idiot. Clothes shopping. There is no way I’m letting you wear that dreadful brown suit to dear Mummy’s party.”
John awoke, a little disoriented at first- strange bed, strange room.  Sarah was cuddled up behind him and he sighed, remembering.  The mini-break.  The Isle of Wight.  He snuggled back into the embrace and closed his eyes again.
“You daft git.  I don’t need you to change.  I like you the way you are, though if you wanted to, you could wash the dishes more often.”  John smiled.  “My relationships haven’t been all that stellar either.  I’d hoped to fix that with Sarah, and if you hadn’t gone and gotten yourself kidnapped, I might have made a good show of it.”
This was all wrong.  It threw off his equilibrium and jumbled the discussion he’d already had with Sherlock in his head.  “Sherlock.  Did you make tea?”  It wasn’t the best opening for a conversation of this magnitude, but it was all he could think of to say.
After dinner, they stood on the balcony of their room and looked out over the Channel.  Sarah’s summer dress floated in the breeze, and John got a wicked gleam in his eye.  He moved back, then knelt behind her.  She started to turn, but he wouldn’t let her.  She laughed and kept looking out over the water.  Slowly, he began running his hands under her skirt, up and down her legs, just skimming over her skin.  She shivered at his touch.  After a few minutes, he reached up and pulled off her panties, and she protested.
With the power outage the night before, they couldn’t charge their mobiles.  While they fed each other grapes and  giggled over glasses of wine, they plugged in their dead devices.
John closed the front door with his foot, his hands full of Tesco bags. All in all, it had been a decent trip to the store, even with the texts from Sherlock asking for lemonade, 4 glue sticks, and “as many Brussels sprouts as would fit in a miniature horse’s mouth.”  (John guessed eight)
Sherlock was asleep, as he was when John left earlier, but he looked better.  Not so pale, not so clammy.  He’d regained some color and his breaths were even.  John released the breath he’d been holding, and sat down.  He reached for Sherlock’s hand and brought it to his forehead, holding it there for a moment before resting it back on the bed in both of hands.  He leaned over and put his head on the rail at the side of the bed.
John nodded, steeling himself.  He was a doctor.  He was a doctor and he’d be providing care to a patient.  Nothing more.  He went to his room and got out of his clothes and into his dressing gown.  He kept his pants on.  By the time he made it back downstairs, he heard the shower running and heard Sherlock call.
Sherlock pushed his strong thigh insistently in between John’s legs, bringing their rapidly-swelling cocks into contact with each other.  Both men groaned at the sensation.
“I’m going.  Get Mycroft to fix it if you have to, but I’m Sherlock’s doctor, I’m his friend, I’m his…  I’m going.”
John nodded quickly- once, set his mouth and swallowed.  Captain Watson, hardened combat veteran, had arrived.
He was bored with the tiny ballerinas and their severe hair and their painted faces.  They were strong, yes, but they lacked the passion he felt.  Maybe one or two prima ballerinas in the world could match his spirit, but for whatever reason, history or spite, they refused to dance with him.  So he was left with boring painted dancing dolls and he hated it.
Back at 221B, Lestrade told the cabbie to wait and propelled John up the stairs.  It was rough going, and by the time they’d reached the landing, Greg wasn’t sure he could get John up to his room.  He pushed the door open, thankful for small favors that it was unlocked. With John’s arm around his neck, he staggered into the parlor.
Dinner at the Fisherman’s Cottage was exactly the right way to start the weekend, as far as John was concerned.  Small and rustic, just romantic enough to hint, but not too much.  He hadn’t gotten very far with Sarah, and didn’t want to scare her off.  He grinned at the thought though- she’d proven to be much tougher than most, on their disastrous first date to the Chinese circus.  Kidnapping, attempted murder, police involvement.  Sometimes John wondered why she agreed to see him again and again.
She crossed to him and smiled back, and they leaned gently in for a kiss.  A first, gentle, mouths closed, just testing.  John wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer, the second kiss was much different.
“Well for somebody that’s not interested in Sherlock, and who isn’t gay, you sure sound jealous.” Greg ventured tentatively.  “Wait.  Rhys is that ginger from Carnaby Street?”
Another flash and bang of lightning, and that seemed to signal the right moment as she put him into position and let go.  God how he wanted to just slam inside her, but he held back, moving slowly, allowing each of them to feel every inch as he slipped inside.  He pushed in, momentarily overwhelmed by the sensation, but still able to control himself and the pace.
John was amazed.  Sherlock was light and graceful and smiling like he was having the time of his life.  He twirled the umbrella, then leapt up onto the base of the lamppost and spun around it like he was a born dancer.
The show progressed slowly.  Each act was “sponsored” by a company or organization, and the amount donated was based on the volume of applause the act received.  Harrod’s ended up donating £2,500 for
Molly pursed her lips, just a micro-expression, but Sherlock read it anyway.  “Well, it doesn’t matter if I do or not, it’s the song that I want to use.”
After a minute, Sherlock began to move.  He ran his nose up and down the crease where John’s leg met his hip.  He nuzzled John’s balls, he nipped gently at his thighs, all the while avoiding the place John most wanted him to touch.
Sherlock complied eagerly.  He could feel John straining to stay still, his muscles quivering as he tried to keep from bucking his hips.  Sherlock continued to lick, nibble and scratch until John lost control and Sherlock could no longer keep his mouth touching skin.
“Sherlock- you are a grown man, genius and innovative.  If there’s not a case, you can call Lestrade and ask for a cold case.  You can call Molly and ask for a corpse.  You can lay about and think about the universe, I don’t know.  But I am positive that you can survive on your own for 48 hours.  You did it the entire time before I showed up, I know you can do it now.  I am going to Wight with Sarah and I am going to GET BLOODY LAID.  Now.  Do you want curry?”
Karen slowly lifted her hand to caress her android’s cheek, gently shushing her, a small smile on her lips, her eyes meeting with Missy’s.
With the new information of Mycroft being involved from the beginning in the know, the three worked separately, well at least Missy did, John needed his lover's help as he still was not at the same level with deduction or using his mind palace.
“Yes, you have, several times in the last few minutes. I see my brothers habits are brushing off a little too well on you…” He smiled smugly as the car pulled up, the door right in front of him.
“An android. Interesting,” Sherlock hummed as he peeled off the rest of the packaging stuck around her body, and bits of foam stuck to her hair.
“We get a sent the first android of this level of detail, and you want it to do dishes and nappies… Think bigger John,” he said, before going back to what he was doing.
…” he glanced over at Missy again, who flipped her hair back, staring back at him till he looked away, taking a deep breath before he continued, “we subjected the package through a series of deep scans and determined that it was safe. There was something that we noticed in her head, but I’m sure by now you would’ve noticed that it is capable of learning, evolving.”
“ Ich will sie nicht... Ich möchte bei dir bleiben, bitte... Sie fürchten mich... Hass mich etwas... Ich will nach Hause gehen, unser Zuhause... ” (I don’t want them… I want to stay with you, please… They fear me… Hate me some… I want to go home, our home…)
Seven year old Mycroft Holmes sighed heavily as he walked into his family home, which he assumed would be as quiet as it was when he had left for school that morning, none the less he called out his usual.
He sighed heavily, closing his eyes as he did as he had been told, trying to reason to himself that he had to, and was not beginning to take orders from his brothers pet bot.
“I’m not afraid of the box, John…” He said, as if speaking to a child, walking towards the box slowly, holding back the urge to open it himself, his curiosity peaking as he went through his collection of handwriting samples and their corresponding owner within his mind palace.
“Sh’rlock?” John mumbled as he slowly roused from sleep, eyes still closed and pulled the children closer to himself.
She rose up to her feet, putting her hand on his shoulder, he looked up at her as she carefully took hold of his hands she pulled him so he was standing as well. She beamed at him as she began to guide him around, dancing to music only she could hear.
“Missy has made a mess, between your daddies,” she said, eyes zooming in on a certain wire, “so, I am trying enable my touch to calm them… Only trouble is I am not allowed to touch Curl… I mean, daddy’s stuff…”
“Seriously John, not everyone's world revolves around procreational acts,” he said, making his lover raise his eyebrows high.
The two could crawl around, walk well but better when holding hands or generally side by side, pick up items as well as identify them when asked about them, drink from cups, everything relatively advanced toddlers could.
"Didn't look like playing, Rose was sitting on that rock watching you two fight... You know mummy doesn't like you fighting, William"
