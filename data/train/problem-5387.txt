“Yes. I told you why last night and it wasn’t a bluff. I have a friend offering me a place to stay until I leave for college. We’ve packed my stuff and were leaving.”
“Man, that’s so creepy. You sound just like her.” Charlie smirked at Dean. “Fine.  I will stay, but I am going over to that coffee shop down the street to get a coffee. I’ll be back.”
He was just sitting there with a shy smile on his face as he looked up at Charlie who was standing in front of him, energy overflowing as she bounced in place while he signed her book. “I am such a huge fan…” He could hear Charlie talking to him but it was like it was all in a tunnel until suddenly everything snapped into focus.
“Thank you.”
He continued gently biting and kissing at his neck as Cas rumbled an answer. “….I…uh…I wanted to know if they’re everywhere and not just across your face…”
He had to stop himself from gasping loudly at what the drawer contained. Old faithful was sitting right there on top, but surrounding it was what Cas was sure was half a porn shop of different types and sizes of toys. He couldn’t wait to try them all. “My, my, Dean….look what we have here, quite a little collection you have huh? Imagine all the things we could do with these…” He had to peruse through half the drawer to find what he was looking for.
Castiel never showed. Dean wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, since he hadn’t seen a light on in his living room after that night. Perhaps he had to go care for his sick grandma…  or perhaps he just hid in another room hoping to ignore Dean for long enough to move pass the whole episode.
She sighed. “Fine. Fine. BUT this is me warning you…I am about to open a can of worms and I can’t put the lid back on once we have this convo, capiche?”
“More like incorrigible.” He sighed and looked at his half eaten eggs. “I’ll make you a deal.” Bal perked up at that. “If, and I mean a huge if at that, if he so much as puts on gay porn – I’ll talk to him. But otherwise, this is just going to go down as a ridiculous fascination with my hot new neighbor. I’ll buy blinds instead of flimsy curtains and keep them closed at all times to resist the temptation to look.”
Cas and Dean worked methodically. They managed to fill up the two suitcases he had. He also borrowed one from Gabes room that he would return to him at a later date. Dean took those downstairs and loaded them into the car while Cas put miscellaneous clothing, towels and such on his bed, folding them up in his bedspread using it like a make shift tote. It took both Dean and Cas to lug that heap down to his car.
"Uh...hi..." he nervously waved at them, "Guess you guys would all like an explanation huh?"
“Dean….” Cas whisper. He looked over to find the angel gazing at the Jinn with his head tilted to the side. “I don’t think he means to kill us. He would have already.”
But Dean also knew he was lying to himself. Not like he wanted Eileen for himself. No, she was actually rather perfect for his dorky little brother. No, Dean wanted Cas….as hard as that was to admit to himself.
I only have a few more chapters left to post that are all written/beta'd already so posting may slow down a bit soon. I am continuously writing and trying to stay ahead of posting though. Just FYI. Thanks for continuing to read! :)
Dean nodded his head. He agreed of course but he hated admitting it to his best friend.
“Cas…” Dean croaked out. His eyes shot to Dean, almost like he was afraid of being caught looking. If you later asked Dean who moved first, he honestly wouldn’t be able to tell you. He thinks it was probably himself. The tether between the two of them, keeping them constantly in orbit of one another of the last couple weeks, finally yanked them together in a clash of hands and lips. Cas pushed him back on the couch, wasting no time with climbing into his lap as Dean pulled him closer, hands burying themselves in his hair, finally getting a chance to yank on it. Which was apparently the right thing to do because it caused Cas to let out an ungodly loud moan. He was suddenly extremely happy that Sam was not around to hear or witness this.
“Really Cas, all is forgiven. Truthfully. I believe you and given everything I witnessed today, how could I not. I’m just glad that we have finally met up again. The last time we were this close together, your friends were talking up a storm about your new condo while you just kind of stared.” He laughed. The day he met Cas on the sidewalk just outside their building was interesting. Cas hardly said more than two words to him but his friends wouldn’t shut up. Not that Dean minded. He was instantly attracted to him and was over the moon when he discovered his voyeuristic side just after that.
“Wait, what wish? And are you forcing us to have this so called wish come true against our will?”
She took a shaky breath, swiped away a tear, and held her hands up as she took a step closer to Dean while glancing at Sam and then leveling Dean with a solemn stare. “I don’t know.” She took another breath, glanced over at Sam who was still kneeling. Sam was unable to believe it was really her but wanted more than anything for her to actually be real, that she had come back to him much like Cas came back to Dean. “All I know,” she continued, “is that I died from that Hellhound attack in South Carolina. I woke up in this beautiful cottage somewhere in Ireland. It was so peaceful that I knew it had to be Heaven. I don’t know how long I was there, but I heard this rustle behind me one morning, and this beautiful creature-man-thing, I don’t know what he was, but he touched my shoulder and said, ‘Your destiny is not this, not yet,’ and I awoke in that same forest in South Carolina.” Dean lowered his gun slightly. “It took me a while to get my bearings but I didn’t know where else to go. Do your tests, please, make sure I am human, because I don’t want to hurt anyone.”
“Well, I am nervous…b-because I don’t know how to say this or how you will react, or… I don’t even know if I am right, but it feels like I am, so I came to you because you should know….”
“Quiet down.” He hissed as he looked around to see who heard. There really wasn’t many people on the patio of the restaurant, but he noticed one guy in the corner on his laptop give him an annoyed look as he continued working.
“Now…I have answered him. I told him that all will be well. I know, I know, cryptic again. But you are going to march your happy ass home and talk to him. Like adults. Clear the air and lock yourselves away for the weekend. Bump uglies and be all happy joy joy with each other. Tell him what I did, its my fault for this hiccup between you two. I’ll never stick my nose back in where it isn’t wanted again.”
Sam and Eileen had been making themselves scarce. Not because Dean or Cas had said something to them, nor hopefully because they made them uncomfortable or anything, but because they were in their own little honeymoon stage. Sam had come to Dean earlier that day to let him know that Eileen and him were going away for a couple days and to not call Sam about anything unless they found a way to Mom, or the world was actually ending, and Dean and Cas couldn’t handle it themselves.
“No. I do not take away your free will. I just….heavily encourage events to happen before they would have naturally. But you have the choice to not allow those events to unfold. I am truly at your mercy in this scenario.”
Without answering his mom, Cas reached back and grabbed Deans hand, interlacing their fingers together. Dean took the half a step forward that put him squarely at Cas’ side.
“NO NO NO WAIT!” Dean yelled as he stood up quickly and started pacing the room. Did he actually want to know? The moment of truth. What if Angel was…..what if Angel was what? Angel was
They had started this series together that Sam swore they would love. Some series about eight people being connected telepathically. But they were just getting ready to start episode six which would ultimately be the catalyst.
“Actually mother, I was talking about myself, but trying not to say the actual words. But since you can’t read between the lines I will actually say the words now. I am gay and this is my boyfriend who I love with all my heart.” He was having a hard time keeping his words steady. Dean’s hand squeezed his reassuringly. “Your life and my life are no longer going down the same path and I need to go because I should be able to hold his hand all the time but instead I am holding onto shame and I shouldn’t be. Love is not shameful and I won’t let you try to change that for me.”
....and finally the conclusion to my little fic. Thanks for reading!!
“Yes.” She jumped up off the couch and walked into the kitchen, returning mere seconds later with her phone in her hand. “You see, I was of course with Dean the entire trip to Vegas so I was privy to the fact that you guys were texting each other
Castiel finally makes it over to Deans apartment.
“Let’s take a break. We need a bit of rest on the research. Maybe we’ll be able to hit the books again tomorrow morning with clear heads.”
Unbeta'd and no pre-read by someone else before posting because I'm impatient and wanted to post, just fyi
Cas hummed around him and pulled off with an exaggerated pop, “Would you like me to stop? You seem to be having a hard time making up your mind tonight.” He paused; Dean had a smattering of freckles on his hip. He dropped a quick kiss to them before engulfing him again.
“Very smart, Angel.” The creature snapped his fingers and they all felt the pressure of their bindings release. Shuffling quickly to his feet, Dean reached out his hand to help Cas up, turning in time to see Sam already standing warily next to him. Dean didn’t even realize that he had yet to release Cas’ hand when the Jinn started to speak again. “You will go from here, and live your lives. I mean you no harm. And if reality comes to pass and your wish-” He paused and let an almost sarcastic grin cross his face. “If your wish does comes true, than I will be quite pleased.”
The stranger put up his hands in a placating manner. “No…sorry…you don’t understand.”
“WHAT?” Charlie really did screech this time.
Cas laughed, “At what? Having to give a speech where every eye of our classmates, all their families and distance relatives are on me and only me and hope I don’t fuck up?” Dean laughed. “Or do you mean after when our whole lives change and we get thrust out into the real world?”
Cas took the stage and gave his valedictorian speech. Dean had heard it so many times by this point that he kind of zoned out. He was being allowed to stare at his boyfriend in public. They had gotten lucky that their cap and gowns were black this year instead of red, and Cas made the required outfit look good. He had a jubilant look on his face; obvious nervousness about giving this speech had disappeared. His voice was steady and deep and so very hypnotizing. It made Dean flashback on their impromptu rendezvous after moving Cas out where he had taken charge and a submissive side of Dean came out that he didn’t know he had. They were both surprised by the shift in them and that dynamic. Dean couldn’t wait to get some time alone together uninterrupted so they could experiment a little more.
Cas stopping sucking his cock and pulled back with an obscenely loud ‘pop’ much like the noises you would hear in overly exaggerated pornos. “That’s the point Dean,” he said as he continued tugging on him. While looking Dean in the eye with such confidence, Cas stuck his finger in his mouth, wetting it before he lowered his head back down, bring his mouth back to Dean’s cock. That’s when Dean felt his other hand slide between his legs, light touching the wet finger to his opening and just barely pushing in.
“Which means that Jo knows exactly what I am going to say right now, right sweetie?”
“I know, I do, but I want double assurance because I might do something stupid tonight.”
“My name is Castiel,” He stuck his hand out for a handshake, “I figured I should introduce myself if we’re going to talk about your nude dad and moms sudden branching out of art subjects.”
“Cas…I’m sorry – I shouldn’t have…” Cas stopped him from continuing by slotting their lips together again, harsher and far more persistent than he did inside. His body was flush with Deans, holding him to the side of the car. He hoped one of the neighbors saw something. Let them talk.
Dean took advantage of his distraction, reaching down to take him in hand, jerking up in quick strong strokes. Cas groaned as he slammed the drawer shut on the nightstand. “Mmm enough with the talking Cas, or do I need to put that mouth of yours to work in order to shut you up?”
“No Dean…I can’t possibly impose on family dinner. We just met, that would be so rude of me.”
Dean kissed him quickly, “Me too.”
Cas laughed, “No, you like anyone and everyone – especially if they call you daddy. Which, by the way, your kink is not my kink and I am perfectly ok with that but, no Bal. Just no. You are one of the few that I have meet that has said, and I quote, ‘I have no preference, I’ll get off with whomever’ and that is just not the standard thing with most people, remember?” Cas took a deep breath trying to put a damper on his rising emotions enough to continue. “Enough. So who was the latest interest last night, huh? You aren’t looking as hungover as usual today.”
He made it no more than twenty feet away before he heard Charlie yell his name. He turned around and looked at her expectantly,
“No Sam. Its Angel’s place to tell me who he is. There’s a reason we are being secretive about our identities. He’s not ready. I might not be ready.”
Sam laughed. “Yeah, well, I could see it. You two. Together. It would be a good fit. I think you guys probably have more in common than you even realize.”
"Joooooo," Charlie whined, "I love you but please shut up. I'm dying of curiosity over here." Everyone laughed as the tension in the room broke. After getting assurances from all them that they would keep his identity as secret as possible, he quickly filled them all in with the cliffnotes version of his life. Coming out, his parent’s rejection, college, work, Balthazar and then ultimately his books. He knew some day everyone would finally know who he is and what he writes but he figured that he'd have to gamble at some point with his alias and trust someone other than just Gabe and Bal with it. Something told him that Dean was worth the risk.
He added another finger as Dean breathed out a curse. “Christ, hurry up Cas, I’m not going to last that long tonight.” Cas rolled his hips on the bed putting much needed pressure on his aching cock. Deans grip in his hair had become painful while he scissored his fingers in earnest. His mouth still continued to slide up and down his prick and if he wasn’t careful he’d set Dean off before getting a chance to get in him.
He heard a whistle behind him as he entered his room and Dean followed. “Wow Cas…” A few years ago his parents finally budged and let him and Gabe paint their bedrooms. They had been bugging their parents to let them do that since they were little kids because the whole house was just several shades of beige and white with black accent pieces. Gabe always complained about how boring it was. So Gabe quickly painted his bedroom in a garish display of every bright color imaginable with no rhyme or reason. It took two days after he moved out before his mother painted it back to white. But Cas had painted the walls in his room like a sunset with it ending with his ceiling as a night sky. He had spent weeks on perfecting it, and Gabe was surprisingly helpful in making his room turn out so good. He helped him paint it too after school since his parents basically refused to help besides purchasing the paint. He hoped his mother wouldn’t paint over it because he was actually going to miss it. But he figured once everything came out, she would erase it much like she would him.
He had called Gabe the night before to let him know what was going on. Though he was upset by his parents’ behavior, Gabe wasn’t surprised. He had even offered to drive down and help him move but Cas begged him not to. He wanted to be able to ask for his help in the future if need be and besides, Dean was there to help him in the meantime.
“I will not tolerate this perversion in my family. Consider yourself not my son anymore.” Her icy words washed over Cas, physically knocking him back a step. He knew it was a possibility. He had read others stories online about their parents disowning them after coming out, but he had always held out hope that his parents would just not talk to him except at family functions or holidays. To actually hear the words come out of her mouth was like a kick to the gut.
“Why Cas, I think your romantic side is showing.” Kissing him again quickly, Dean continued, “…which is fine by me, but still I would like to take you out do this properly. You know, dinner, movie, meet the friends and family eventually…”
After that the blonde man leaves and Dean lets out a deep breath he didn't realize he was holding. Takes a few more after that to just calm himself. He texts Sam, tells him work is going really well and asks how are him and Eileen doing.
"What was that earlier today?" Eddie asks out of nowhere. Buck knew his best friend wanted to ask this for a while, he was kind of off since dinner and he was wondering what the hell was that about. And he's still confused.
"Goodnight Chris, love you buddy" 24 hour shifts usually end up with Buck sleeping over at the Diaz household, and he doesn't mind at all, he loves spending time with Eddie and Chris, the kid is so special, he knew from the moment Eddie showed him a picture and after knowing him for so long Evan can say that he's never met anyone as strong as this kid and his father, they've both been through so much and now here they are, both happy, or at least Buck likes to believe they are, and that part of it is because of him.
Buckley slowly lets go of him, and for a while they just stare at each other, it's awkward really but Dean really appreciates it.
here’s an update, i’m sorry if any of this seems out of character, i started this mainly for my own comfort so yeah
Dean wakes up sweating, he has no idea where he is, only that he feels somone's hands on him, someone is trying to talk to him nut he cant listen. In this moment hes back in the bunker right after he lost Castiel.
Eddie doesn't take long and soon they're both seated on the couch, in comfortable silence, watching whatever is on the tv.
"Not really, but seriously, thank you so much"
"Wonder who that is..." Eddie thinks out loud.
"Dean? I know its hard right now and I'm probably not the person you need right now but try to focus on the sound of my voice... It's Buck, this is the year 2021, you're in the LA fire department, you were having a nightmare, everything is okay" The voice repeats this a few more times until Dean feels himself come back to reality, he's no longer seeing a black goo on the wall, he's staring back at Buck's light blue eyes, an amazing contrast to Cas' dark blue ones, he misses Cas, so much, much more than he lets himself admit most of the time, it's so hard without him... It doesn't feel like living, just surviving and he tries so hard to be okay, to move on, but sometimes it's just so damn hard. Buck repets once again, probably because he could feel Dean slipping away too. He nods at the younger man to let him know he's here and better but he can't bring himself to speak just yet.
"Yeah me too... maybe it's the guy he mentioned last night at the bar? I don't really know, I didnt want to push and he didn't want to talk about it" Both men shrug it off and drink one more beer before Eddie goes to bed and Buck takes over the pull out couch.
"Dean? Oh that was nothing really, dude had a nightmare and i just helped him, we're not «besties» but he does seem like a cool guy. You're my only bestie." Buck says and laughs, Eddie apparently doesn't think it's funny.
"Don't mention it" Buck smiles "I'm gonna leave you to it but you better hurry up if you want to eat whatever Cap is doing for dinner"
"You and the new guy... you guys seemed super close, took way longer for you to be okay with me in the team but suddenly here's this guy and you're already besties." And Buck wasnt expecting this... Is Eddie jealous of Dean? Because first of all Dean isn't Buck's type in the first place, but he also didn't realize they seemed so close for Eddie to even say something like this.
"So you're first names with him already? Forget, nevermind... you said he had a nightmare, is he okay?" Now here's the man he knows and loves. Buck seriously wonders why he seemed so defensive about Dean in the first place bur brushes it off and tells him what he knows which is not much. Just that Dean was having a nightmare and that he was screaming the name 'Cas' over and over.
Hey guys, first of all i really wanna say thank you for the amazing amount of support i got on chapter 1, I didn’t expect it at all
He lets Eddie say goddnight to Chris on his own and grabs two beers while he waits for him to come back to the living room.
Buck's POV
"Thank you, seriously. How did you know to do that?" Usually it takes him so much longer to come back to reality after a nightmare like this.
"Goodnight Bucky, I love you so much" Christopher hugs him really tight and Buck can feel himself get emocional. He wants this, not just tonight but every night. Buck always knew that there was something between him and Eddie, even when he first met the guy and he didn't like him , there was something there and after they became close friends it just got bigger and bigger and for the longest time Buck couldn't figure out, for the life of him, what it was or what it meant. Then the tsunami happened and there Eddie was not blaming him for losinh his son but also telling him that there was no one else in the world that he trsuted more with his kid than Buck and thats when he realized, he was in love with his best friend, and how did that even happen? He has no idea. He tried pushing it off, and the whole lawsuit happened and he tought Eddie would never forgive him or that things between them would change, anything really... but it happened the exact opposite, they became closer, if that was even possible, and ocasionally Buck wonders if his best friend might feel the same. But if he did wouldn't have anything happened by now? He feels like they've been dancing around this thing of theirs for years, and he wants to say something but the fear of losing Eddie is bigger so he keeps his mouth shut.
A part of him still can’t believe that he’s here, with the man he loves… the man he’s loved for over a decade.
“We’ll need some furniture.” He announces as they approach the small town his cabin is near. He’d bought it years ago, when Sam had run off to Stanford. Never in all those years had he told a single soul about it. Not Sam, not his dad, not anyone. It had remained derelict for more than a decade. That cottage was meant to be his getaway. His normal. But he’d never found someone to share it with.
“Dean I don’t think my technique is right at all!”
“Sam?” she calls, nearly hysterical. “Where’s your brother?”
“I won’t forget what’s real.” He growls. “No matter what you show me, no matter what you do. I’ll fight to get back to the real world.”
“Mom.”
notice, because you’re looking for something to be wrong but no one else cares.”
“He’s been chill so far, but that’s only because he isn’t totally sure.” Dean explains.
“That isn’t what I saw.” The words come out unbidden.
“It was dark and the earth burned black. Sulphur and ash clogged the air. It was rancid. Even for an angel. I wanted nothing more than to leave… but I was lost. Lost and as I thought, alone. I wasn’t alone. There was something there. Something that shouldn’t have been. It was bright and more beautiful than entering through the gates of Heaven. It was exactly what I had been looking for without even knowing it. And in its presence I felt safe and at home. I stood at the shrivelled heart of a barren horror world but I felt safe.
Adam considers his question for a moment before nodding slowly. “Just for an hour or two. I need a break. A drink.”
“Dean?” he asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Besides… it’s not like they’re
“Dean!” Sam calls, essentially shutting him up. “Have you ever tried on sexy lingerie?”
All of this could have been avoided.
He opens his door to find Cass lounging against the opposite wall. He’s changed too into white scrubs with the coat over it and of course the crowning jewel. Beige cowboy boots. Dean lets out a low whistle. “Lookin’ good Cass.”
“You did take care of me,” Cass whispers. “Sam told me. You never left me, even when you should have. Even when I was hurting you.”
“It’s not like you haven’t ‘seen the goods.’” He does air quotes at the end.
the one who will decide whether we try this or not.”
“I can’t believe this. You betrayed me and let a monster into our home.” He growls.
Cass won’t appreciate him reading about him any more than he had appreciated Dean snooping through his box. He knows what he needs to do.
Dean holds up a hand to silence him before looking up at Cass again.
Cass’ eyes drift down to the plate, his hand clenching on the door.
His grace was no longer kicking like a bull in a pen and somehow along the way he’d completely forgotten the purpose of this endeavour. Castiel’s smile withered and he felt himself withdraw. He should tell Dean. He never wants this dance they’re doing to stop but he doesn’t want his first time with Dean to be something coerced due to misplaced gratitude.
I know I promised the date in this one but I got carried away with the Sam and Dean interaction
It’s terribly fair. To do this now of all times.
“Cass.” He whispers. “Almost there.”
Those women had gotten to experience something he hadn’t though. True intimacy with Dean.
Then his finger brushes a jagged edge; sparking pain. He yanks his finger back he pushes it in his mouth hoping that he hadn’t stained Dean’s clothes. The object didn’t feel like any knife he’d ever seen. It was unbelievably hard. Thick…
“Hmm.” Dean says not really concerned about the designs of anything at the moment. “That feels nice.”
“Like lubricant.”
“I love it.” He groans, his voice garbled from his full mouth.
They won.
“Gee. That clears it up Cass.”
“Basically.” Dean nods.
That’s what Dean wants.
He fights the urge to tease him further. ‘Yeah Dean, one half of a mini-burger is real food.’
He wants to scream and bang on the box. That had been his plan. At first he thought having Cass here would make things easier, but somehow they’re almost worse. He can’t let out any of the stress he feels and neither does Cass. Does he even have stress? He’s been alive for much longer than this. It’s probably just a vacation for him. He’ll probably think I’m a wimp for breaking so soon.
Damn it, Cass!
He gathers his sheets and hightails it back to his room.
“But-”
Sam presses his lips together but remains silent.
It breaks his heart even as it brings out his own need to kill.
He wants this to continue as much as Castiel does. But he’s too scared to ask. Even as Dean hovers above him, Castiel can see the shame swirling in his eyes, filtering back into his brain like poison. Dean will destroy himself over this whether or not it happens, at least going along gives him a chance of finally finding peace with himself.
“I’m sorry.”
“Castiel.” The angel before him seems smug. “You seek Dean Winchester.”
“So, I want to let you know that you can talk freely here. Tell me the truth and if you don’t want to answer, that’s okay too.”
Her eyes widen and she gapes widely at Cass.
Sam missed most of the episode and now he just watches Dean panting, clawing lightly at the carpet.
As much as Sam’s on a diet… he kind of… maybe… misses Dean’s cooking.
Way to butter me up, Dean thinks.
Dean remains in his spot, sitting there in the darkness in a trance like state. The only thing that brings him back to reality is the soft padding of feet.
“Hello Dean.”
Dean narrows his eyes. “You better make sure I hear you.”
Cass smiles at him and he feels some of the tension abate. “I told you Dean, you should have taken off your clothes.”
Though, Dean hadn’t heard the one thing he wanted to.
Snuggling down into this bed once more, he tries to latch onto his fatigue and let it drag him into unconsciousness.
Dean’s breaths come faster. Because Cass
They just need something – or someone – to remind him about all the reasons why they should.
Cass touches his shoulder gently, breaking him out of his own mind.
“How do we know it even worked?” demands Dean, once more looking at him with concern. “You don’t even know for sure? Let’s just finish what we started.”
Crowley raises a brow at his barrage of questions. “I’ve already answered all these questions.”
“I thought the same thing right up till he kissed me.”
“Sam.” Dean calls. “Come play with us.”
“Castiel was so… uptight.” Lucifer cracks his back. “Oh yeah! That loosened me up.”
“You enjoyed that.” Cass says lowly, his voice no less surprised than Dean’s.
He manages a small smile. “Thanks Sammy.” He nibbles on his lip. “It’s not great. Michael is using this against me. He’s banging up a storm.”
He seemed to buy the ‘human experience’ thing, but Dean doesn’t want to take any chances. If Sam finds out, he’d be incorrigible.
Lifting his arms up in the universal sign for ‘pick me up’, Dean smiles innocently at him.
“I scared myself.” Dean grits out.
Realization strikes him then. Dean is hiding his face behind his jacket, to make Castiel feel more comfortable. He snatches his hand back and takes a breath. Of all the emotions coursing through his veins, sorrow is most prominent. Of course, Dean would feel responsible for some monster wearing his face, for ‘not saving’ Castiel. In typical Winchester fashion, he’d drawn into himself and tried to fix things. It’s appreciated but unnecessary.
“I’m endangering Dean.” He says plainly. “I was being selfish and I almost killed him. Again.”
So that means those constipated looks might actually be constipation. Dean has a field day with that, diving into the mechanics of angel digestion. Cass is surprisingly animate about it.
Cass sends him a bland look.
Two. At this point, Sam is tired of all the ringing.
Castiel’s shoulders fall at the accusation. “But you will allow me to remain with Dean.”
What the fuck?
Aziraphale hums in approval. “You certainly do look spiffy.”
“Did you hear me?” he tries again.
But Dean can see it – he can hear it – the raucous yet soothing sound of:
die then.
“My bookstore is right across the street.” Says Aziraphale. “It has all sorts of texts on the occult.”
As much as Sam wants to know what Cass told Dean, he doesn’t want to prolong this experience.
His hand tightens around the handle. “Of course I am… and feel free to tell him that.”
“Yes,” Cass says, answering for him. “And I begged Sam to keep it a secret.”
No movement.
Dean rolls his eyes causing Cass to glare at him.
“It’s not the same.” Cass says.
“Ahh! Cassss.”
Castiel slowly finds his way back to himself. For a short moment he thought that he’d been banished.
Castiel closes his eyes, relaxing into the water. He has to admit, the steam does well to numb his face. He suddenly understand why Dean had remained in here for so long. Thinking of Dean, his mind leads him along a dark path. One where he realises that he’s now sitting in the exact spot Dean had been in when he’d –
then.”
Castiel worries at his lip.
Cass winks at him. It’s so out of character and so cringey that he can’t help but laughing.
His tongue is caught in his throat. "Keep praying to him. It helps trust me."
Dean feels something wet on his hands and he hears some metallic clanging, but he feels as though he’s still attached to Cass.
His miracle.
“No.” Sam repeats, aghast.
‘Dee’ sighs, making his way over slowly to pick up the artefact and sets it on his bed. Right next to Dean. Now that he has a closer look, Dean can’t deny that this Castiel is hot.
“What?” Sam steps closer.
Castiel flushes. “Well, yes.” He agrees, “But sometimes it’s nice to –”
At Cass sharp intake of breath, his eyes snap open. “But-”
He’s about eight percent sure of Cass’ feelings. Just thinking about it makes his head spin. He’s going to have to
Guilt swamps him as Cass throws him a backward glance as he slips out of the car. Dean squeezes the wheel,  frustrated with himself.
Dean’s sincere expression draws him in like Icarus to the sun. His wings have already caught aflame, so he has nothing to fear.
“Thanks man.”
He’s still undecided on reading Chuck’s book. It doesn’t feel right.
When Dean looks up at him next, his eyes are hooded. “That’s good.”
By now his room sounds like a porno studio. Cass’ moans and pants stretching from wall to wall.
Dean would never forget that…Castiel knows full well that he knows every Zeppelin song that ever existed.
“He won’t stop copying me.” Cass’ lip warbles, like he’s almost near tears.
“Do you know what my plan is?” The other Dean murmurs, hauntingly. “Cass is tethered to me. So when he feels himself slipping away… I’m putting a bullet in my brain and blasting us into oblivion.”
“Dean!” Sam collides with him in a bruising hug.
Dean raises a brow. “Kid Cass was stingy with his burgers, huh?”
He doesn’t like lying to Adam. So he just goes with the truth. “I was ashamed.”
Dean shakes his head. Cass is full on beaming now.
If he says this, it can never be taken back. It’s a part of him that once he gives to Dean, he knows that he will never get back, ever. Not if they break up, or grow apart or fall out of love.
. Sam squeezes his eyes shut, trying to think about a time when things were better. When Dean was here, by his side, ready to face all of heaven and hell with him.
Dean remains seated in the dark, mulling over his mom’s words long after she left the room.
Crowley wedges his way past the grinding, sweating bodies of the snivelling teenage humans, cursing all the way. Of course!
Dean shrugs. “Then I’ll pull a Cass: run out of the room silently.”
Cass shakes his head slowly. “You know that just not true.”
Minute four.
“Really?” Dean says uneasily. He still isn’t comfortable about
Could an angel die from acute panic?
Dean took several large steps to bring back to his car door. He wrenched it open and grabbed the book off the seat, flipping to the front to see what Cas had wrote. ‘Dean, my apologies for missing out on your previous invitation. I would still very much like to take you up on it. Old faithful was quite… stimulating the last time I saw it, and I would love to see it in action in person if your offer still stands. And since I got you in hot water with your friends, I would be happy to explain. Text me, and hopefully we can work something out. -Your Hot Neighbor.’ His number was also written down below his signature, and Dean couldn’t help but to beam. Oh yes, the offer still stood.
He couldn’t breathe. He had to be dreaming as he watched Dean as he paused in his stroking to crack open a bottle of lube and coat the toy and himself. Once Dean got resituated with his feet on the coffee table, legs spread and hands once again disappearing between his legs – Cas couldn’t take it any longer. He moaned loudly once he had stuffed his hand into his sweats, taking himself in hand. His other hand smoothed over his naked chest to pinch at his own nipple. He had to bite his lip to keep from groaning any louder, not like he had neighbors that could hear him. But since he could faintly hear Deans TV through his cracked window, there was always that chance that he could hear him in return.
“That’s all we ask Dean.” Jo was eying him with satisfaction. She was his rock. She was steady and always able to get him to slowly step out of his comfort zone to see the possibilities of things. Whereas Charlie was like a wrecking ball and just liked to knock him over and drag him into things. He loved them both so much. “However…” Jo hesitated. “When I was passing the line by the entrance, I heard some people say that only the first 100 people were going to be allowed to stay for a reading.”
“The Pagan deity.” Cas intoned. “Your kind are…”
“Yeah…” The stranger looked relieved, “My mom told me that a few of her new works were going up this week here. I come see them every time. I thought she was only doing like trees and shit. Not my dad in all his glory!” He laughed awkwardly.
“Oh pssh…don’t give me that crap Cas, I’m smarter than that. See I figured it out a la Sherlock Holmes style. You conveniently stopped texting as much the same night that I took Deans phone from him and texted you myself. You know the night. At the strip club. The one I dragged him to. And I figured that you thought Dean must have slept with someone on that trip.”
When it looked like his mother wasn’t going to say anything Cas just sighed. “I love you and thank you for everything you have done to raise me, but it’s time for me to go. Please give my best to Dad. Goodbye Mother.” She didn’t stop them as they walked out the front door, down the steps and to his car. After throwing their bags into the backseat with the rest, Cas spun Dean around and pinned him to the side of his car.
“Hey Dean, what’s up?” It was a good thing Eileen could read lips as well because as Sam was trying to sign while speaking and Dean was pretty sure that wasn’t what he just signed.
“Well…you kind of look like shit Cas…” Charlie was leaning on her door frame as he approached, clearly, she had seen him pull up to her place.
He had received a few more drunken gibberish texts that night but it had felt like a punch to the heart at the time.
“Ok…well, first things first, I know you are like madly in love with Dean.” He froze. Ok, so he was right, he didn’t hide that as well as he had hoped. “Oh don’t look so frightened! I figured it out about six weeks after Dean moved in with you. I’ve been there, remember? I moved in with my friend Alicia, fell ass over tits for her and that like ruined our friendship because she was straight-straight and I was in love-love. So yes, I noticed the signs with you and just zipped my lips. Besides – Dean has been a totally different person since he moved in with you. Better, actually.”
“That’s the thing though – I didn’t know that you and Dean aren’t dating.” His head snapped up to look at her. She looked to be sincere. “So a little back story on mine and Deans friendship…I knew I was gay right off the bat. But Dean? He was the straight playboy in high school when we met. It wasn’t until like five years after school ended that I found out he was bi and that was by pure accident. As in, I accidently walked in on him making out with a guy in his office at the auto shop. He is like totally tight lipped when it comes to guys he’s dating. I blame that on Daddy Winchester and his backasswards upbringing.”
Thankfully, Charlie and Jo waited until they reached his car before they pounced on him. Obviously they knew that whatever association that “Jimmy” had with Dean was something he didn’t want all the fans surrounding them, listening intently, to know.
________
Cas took his time here today. He had decided to stop in after getting off work early. It was a Friday, he had no other plans than cooking himself dinner and settling down with a new documentary to watch, but he was glad he decided to stop in. A good 10 to 20 minutes or better was spent looking at each painting on the wall. He lamented to himself once again how he wished he could afford to purchase one of these artworks. It would be displayed in pride of place in his living room. But alas, he wasn’t to the point of being able to afford an extravagant purchase like this. It was a goal – someday.
It was quiet for a heartbeat too long. His mother was glancing back and forth between Cas and Dean as if she was finally putting all the puzzle pieces together. Once they clicked into place, you could visually see the change on her face take over. Puzzlement became anger in a split second.
Sam took a deep breath, rubbing his hands together trying to work up his nerve. “Soooo… I think I know who Angel is.”
“Hey!” Dean yelled at the figure sitting in the front seat. They couldn’t see her face, but as the figure got out of the car, hands held up high, all the blood drained from Sam's face as he fell to his knees. “This is impossible. Eileen?” Dean stepped closer, hands still held high keeping the gun trained on her. He had to be closer so she could read his lips but he wasn’t going to trust that this was her. “How are you alive?”
Jo nodded her head in agreement with her girlfriend. “Really Dean, Charlie is right. I thought the name and premise was horrible and clichéd too, but because I love my dear girlfriend so much, I gave it a shot and read the first book, and I got hooked too.” Jo leaned over and pecked Charlie quickly on the lips. “It’s really a monumental thing, this series. It’s one of the most popular fantasy series on the market right now and the fact that the main character Credence is gay, plus the inclusivity of all the supporting characters, is a big deal in the industry.”
He groaned as he watched Deans head fall back against the couch as he slowly inserted the toy. The look on his face was one of pure ecstasy. He clearly liked using the dildo while he get off and Cas wanted nothing more than to go over there and help him out. Bend him over that couch, or have him sit in his lap, hell, he would even leave the porn playing if Dean wanted.
Jock.
Cas let out a shaky breath as he smiled, “God I love you.”
Really, Sam was just looking forward to being back home. They still hadn’t been able to figure out a way to get their mom back from the other world. And he knew Cas was starting to get antsy about Jack being stuck there as well. With the recent problems with Lucifer, even Sam felt like time was running out to get to them before he, or the alternative Michael, started causing serious problems. He wanted to get back and throw himself into research, hoping he could find something, anything to change this situation.
Cas leaned back on his heels, swallowing quickly as he pulled away from Dean. There wasn’t a moment’s hesitation before he reached down, taking himself in hand, quickly stroking his own cock, desperate for his own climax. Dean didn’t give him a chance to bring himself off. He swiftly sat up and brought his mouth to his while abruptly taking over stroking Cas. He lasted barely a minute before coming, painting Dean’s chest with his own come.
Unbeta'd and no pre-read by someone else before posting because I'm impatient and wanted to post, just fyi
“Cas?” He sounded hesitant, unsure. Not the happy, self-assured Dean he was use to hearing. “Uhh…Charlie just said you were on your way home.” He rubbed a hand across his face, “What, uh, what were you doing over there?”
“Ooohhh fuuuuck…” Cas had leaned forward and engulfed Dean’s cock, swallowing it almost whole with no warning. It took everything Dean had to not blow it all right then and there. Slowly, Cas pulled his mouth up and then slowly back down his dick as he started a slow tortuous rhythm.
Now, after living in his new dream home for a month, his world got flipped completely on its end. Cas put his book down, stretching lightly, realizing he was getting too old to stay in one position reading anymore. Switching off the lights he made his way over to the window, grabbing the curtain to pull them closed quickly and he briefly glanced across the way to Deans living room. He froze. There, playing clear as day was porn on Deans TV. His big, at least 50 inch, TV. And Dean….Dean was not only watching it – with his blinds still half open – but was apparently enjoying himself greatly while doing so. Cas sucked in an unsteady breath as he found himself pulling the curtains closed enough that he could hide behind them and still watch.
“Ow! Ow! Owww…. told me what?” He flinched away.
“Good afternoon sir, welcome in.” He heard the friendly voice at the front desk, one he had come to recognize. He didn’t really stop to socialize with the people that worked at the museum, but he had come in so much over the last year since he moved here that they were all quite familiar faces by now. He supposed he was too. And though the museum was free to visit, after his third trip back, he started dropping money into the donation bucket at the front of the building. He didn’t feel right spending so much of his time here, enjoying the beautiful art work for free, and not purchasing it, to not drop a few extra bucks when he was there and could spare it. He waved a quick hi to the woman at the front desk as he passed into the room with all new paintings.
Cas was barely two steps in his front door before Dean was standing there, suddenly next to him and obviously worried. He had been so preoccupied with his own perceived heartache that he didn’t take the time to really notice how Dean was acting. He could kick himself because Dean was plainly not well.
Dean laughed. “Sure man, if that’s what you want to do. I’m gonna go change and get comfortable, be back in five.”
“I don’t understand – if you knew, and you know that we are not dating, then why would you send that text to me?” He looked down, picking the invisible lent from his pants. He couldn’t look her in the face with all his tightly kept secrets abruptly on display.
“Anyhow, when Dean moved in with you, I noticed an immediate change in his behavior. You only know the Dean that lives with you. He’s always been open and tactile with you right?” He nodded. “Well Dean before he moved in with you was rather closed off and hesitant, with almost everyone except with Sam and me. After seeing him interacting with you and you being all moony eyed over him – I just assumed that you guys were secretly dating and that you guys would let us all in on the news when you felt comfortable with it. I thought, rather erroneously now, that you were keeping it a secret because of Daddy Winchester.”
But this? This was amazing. Cas fit perfectly between his hips, lips attached to his own as he dragged his hands up and down his back. The slow drag of his cock against his own was sweet torture. He didn’t know where this would go, or even if it would go any further than this, but he never wanted it to stop.
“In the….oh-h-h” He arched his back, he was getting close. “…the nightstand with the condoms.” Cruelly, Cas broke away from him and leaned over to the drawer, wrenching it open to get inside.
Things are going to start getting heavy. Homophobic behavior, slurs, etc etc. I don't think like I write, just FYI. I am gay myself, and writing a gay story obviously, soooo....heads up. This chapter is the kick off for some bullshit conduct. But all in all I prefer to write HEA/ "this aint how the world actually is but wouldn't it be nice" type stories so yeahhh
He had been attracted to Cas since the very first moment in the barn all those years ago. How could he not when Cas had those crystal clear blue eyes, sex hair and a voice that Dean wanted to hear on repeat in the bedroom? And with his damn near unwavering loyalty to them, his friendship, and his obvious love for them had done nothing to stop Dean from developing feelings.
Within weeks of meeting Bal, his creative juices flowed freely and before he knew it, he had outlined an entire series and had a good half his first book written. Luckily he had found a publisher willing to let him hide his identity. Apparently it was more common than he thought in the industry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“-you need to get out of your apartment and out of the auto shop. Man does not live on porn and cars alone, you know?”
Chucking, he wriggles his fingers, “Ready to get back to business?”
He looks pointedly downward trying to act natural in the presence of Cass’ erection.
“Sam.” He says in greeting, as he ambles into the kitchen.
It’s unusually hot and Sam tugs at his collar almost immediately, his body wanting to get away from the heat.
Only a few minutes later, he can’t take it much longer, “Faster.”
“That isn’t in the cards for me man.” He rubs his knee, “I don’t want that hassle. I’m content with just you and me here. Maybe Sam if he comes to visit.”
“I thought Castiel was sent to kill us.” Aziraphale says sheepishly. “Then we realised that you don’t bear the markers of this world.”
“Don’t worry,” Sam assures. “I’m going to deal with Crowley.”
“Do you know what that means?”
“Shit.” She exclaims, “Dean is okay. I mean… the blood… but everything is… where it’s meant to be. They’re both out for the count though.”
He slowly drags himself lower on the bed, kissing Dean on whatever patch of skin hovers over his mouth. His wings are once more stowed for convenience. Castiel had a plan, something that would distract Dean from his worries about their situation. Despite himself, Castiel feels a touch of awkwardness as he comes eye-level with the pink head of Dean’s penis.
“I know.” He says, while Cass is simpering in his anger.
He presses a hand over his mouth, burying his head further between his knees.
Sam can only guess where his eyes are focused… or on who.
She gestures to the parcel in her lap. “I didn’t forget the pie.”
“Look man, I know I’ve been … nosey and unsupportive recently. But I want to change that.”
“Castiel.” His head whips around.
Chuck.
Castiel’s eyes are wide, no longer filled with longing but with fear. It makes Sam realize that he needs to cool it. Dean doesn’t know and Cass doesn’t want him to know. There’s nothing he can do about that. What he can do is try to help curb Dean’s flirting in front of Cass.
As he comes down, he sees how flushed Dean is, how close. Castiel reaches forward, gripping his ass and dragging him closer. “Now it’s your turn, Dean. Come for me.”
Just before Dean’s seizures… that’s what he said.
“Cass…” Sam trails off. “You used salt instead of sugar.”
All of a sudden the weight over him vanishes, along with the wound on his chest. Panting, he stares up at Cass in shock.
“He’s not leaving you.” Sam assures, “Dean adores you but he just… wanted you to spend some time with me. I thought we could read. Well, that I’d read to you.”
“Dean?”
“Buckle you in?” Mary cocks her head.
Dean sighs. “Then why won’t you tell me anything?”
“There was a djinn too,” Cass says, wanting to distract them both from his almost slip-up. “Who kept me locked in a dream world. I– I still don’t know when that happened. If it was from the start, or if it was after the shifter and the siren.”
Castiel gives himself a moment to register the shock on Dean’s face, to see that his words had broken ground and registered in Dean’s mind. Then he walks away.
Saying nothing, he walks a few paces over.
“Say that again Cass.”
“If you want to end this just say so.”
Cass’ door is already ajar when he gets there. He knocks lightly before poking his head in. The room feels dark and sad. Cass is on the bed, looking like a lump covered in the comforter.
He glances back at the door. Standing here with Cass and the machine filled with their come stained stuff makes him feel like he’s at the scene of a murder. And not in the calm way he feels when they’re actually
“I wish you’d never told me those things.” His voice is harsh. “You were right. We do need each other, but I need Dean far more than he needs me. I can’t risk telling him about – my feelings.” Shame lowers his voice at the end.
“We’re here.” He says, unnecessarily.
do better. “Okay,” He says instantly, causing Dean to pause with shock.
“I love you.” Dean says, once he’s all settled in. “I always have. I’m sorry I never said it.”
Tenderly, he lowers them both to the ground, stroking a hand through Cass’ hair. Cass’ hand is still clutching his own tightly, as though afraid to let go.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s always held a smidgen of hope. Tormenting himself with it for years. Now, maybe it’s for the best that he has a clear answer. He can stop making a fool of himself. Stop holding out hope for something that would never happen.
Leaning forward Castiel swipes the pie off Dean’s fork. His mouth freezes mid chew as he fully assesses what’s actually in the pie. “This is… pleasant.” The molecules are by no means complex and they slide across his tongue in a familiar dance.
“You and Cass are not?” his voice is surprised.
“Hello.” He says cheerily, doing that one handed wave.
Maybe Cass just needs a confidence boost, he tells himself. Some training wheels before Dean lets him ride solo.
Lastly, enjoy and expect more updates in 3-5 days!!
“That’s over now.” Dean says sternly.
“Cass!” Dean yells slamming the bunker door shut.
So he admits it, all of it. Dean sits there in stunned silence and Castiel fears he may just leave him here all over again. Then he would really wish for the Empty.
Oh no. Panic grips him. Baby’s don’t speak in deep voices.
“Dean, I need to talk to Cass urgently.”
“I could banish you before you ever got the chance.” He retorts.
“Dean?”
“I made some waves that rocked the ship that had just set sail.” He says, seeming proud of himself.
If it was anyone else, he’d just make a joke and brush the entire incident aside, but this is Cass. He’s asking him for this one thing after months of torture, he’d do it. Cut back for a bit. “Okay. I won’t go cold turkey… but I’ll slow down a bit.”
Wide eyes and pointing an angel blade at them.
It’s unbelievably good. Somehow the angel has no gag reflex and doesn’t even graze him once with his teeth.
Sam sees the pearl gleam past his stubby little fingers.
He’s here for a few last moments with Sam.
There’s a short silence before Jody scoffs, “That’s impossible, Sam. I spent the last week up in the mountains with Claire and Alex hunting some Wendigos. No reception at all.”
It takes Sam a moment to connect Dean’s guilt-ridden face with something he should have paid more attention to from the start.
“What do you want?” Cass asks in exasperation, still refusing to turn over.
“Yeah, I don’t know if I can sleep here.”
Dean hasn’t acknowledged his apology. He’s completely ignored it.
But then it’s back; the cheeky smirk and the twinkle in his eye. “Love me some pie.” He says, stabbing the perfectly crunchy crust with his own fork.
He can’t remember the last time he heard to Dean taking anyone home. Sure, he still flirts relentlessly, but he doesn’t make it past groping in an alley.
So what is he supposed to do? Without Dean and Sam he has nowhere. He’s been cast out of the bunker just as he was cast out of heaven. But this time the fall from an even greater height.
Maybe Dean just didn't get the reference.
Smirking, he glances down at the tent in the blankets. “I’ll give you a real wake-up call Dean.” He says as he slithers down under the blankets.
And rude it is.
Cass looks wrecked. “You told me that I was your brother too.”
Cass doesn’t listen, content to suck on his head like a goddamned lollipop.
Crowley could have healed Dean ages ago, yet, he’s just hung around, preying off of his weakness. He isn’t Dean’s friend, no matter how much he has Dean fooled.
He highly doubts that one. After all these years, he thinks Cass is over serving.
Castiel retreats to his room, replacing his box and the chit from the Ferris wheel.
Dean’s hand trembles as Cass makes his way back up his body, licking a path over his sweaty skin. His neck and chest are doused in a film of sweat, but Cass doesn’t seem to mind. His body is still sensitive, even as he comes down and he finds his hands struggling to stay still.
Dean’s hand stalls.
All of a sudden the mattress under him now feels like an uneven stone.
“Shit.” Alternate Dean presses his head against the door frame as a female figure comes into view.
“I’ll make you a special one,” Dean promises.
“Man, you’re fun.” It sounds lame and he knows it, but it’s the best bit encouragement he can offer.
“I knew it wasn’t Jody.” Dean says.
“Oh. It’s fine.”
Drinking in the last sights of the placed he’d always dreamed of calling home and the mementoes of the people he wished would call him family. He heads to Dean’s room first. Luckily the door is already sprawling open; that doesn’t make him feel less guilty though. He knows exactly how Dean feels about his privacy… about his personal space.
A sheen of tears fills Cass’ eyes.
Dean sighs, he knows that tone. The silent yet judging tone that tells him just how pissed Cass is with him. Which isn’t even fair because
“Wait.” Dean’s voice isn’t hard and cold, it’s breathy and panicked. “I can’t talk about this right now.  I’m too angry.”
All the trying of the past few weeks was wasted… on someone who wasn’t even real.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Castiel is looking at him with hope, so Dean tries to stall his freak out session. “What’s the deal?” he asks instead.
Cass looks up catching Dean’s eye and stilling. “You’re close.” He observes, discretely palming his own cock.
Another sound Castiel will never tire of hearing. His eyes are crinkled as he grins up at Castiel. Castiel startles as he feels Dean’s fingers wrap around his own erection, taking the lazy approach and stroking him gently, letting the pleasure build up.
In that moment it’s pure instinct that makes him rip the door open and stare at his friend.
She glanced at both boys one more time. They were both still red in the face and pointedly looking away from anyone else. And who was she to stop young love? She hadn’t seen evidence of their puppy love, but she was not their teacher anymore and didn’t see them every day. She couldn’t help but wonder when this had started and how it would continue.
“Where should I start? Take a seat.” Cas gestured to the couch.
be getting to work.
“I wish I could tell you I’m surprised, but I’m not,” she told him directly.
“Also, you got really defensive really fast about Dean,” Jo pointed out. “Maybe you should think about that and what that might mean, too.”
Castiel is turning out to be a really nice guy and Dean can't figure out the type of person that would spread these malicious lies about him. Or the reason why. Dean recalls the look of recognition on Cas’ face when he heard all of the rumours. Cas must know something about the origin of the stories. He figures that Cas will tell him when he's ready to, if ever, but the more time goes by and the closer he finds himself to Cas, the more upset he becomes over the whole situation. The terrible rumours aren't dying down, they're still spreading. Someone is keeping them alive and Dean wants to find out who that person is.
“But I like it better when you talk about it,” Castiel complained.
Cas has just taken a turn, he’s spun to face Dean, arms raised in celebration because he’s just knocked over three entire pins in a single hit, Dean’s own arms are trapped on Cas’ shoulders where he’s let them fall. The pose is probably more innocent than it might look to an outsider (Dean just can’t tell anymore, Cas is just warm and soft, and everything feels good right now), but he could see how it could be “intimate.” Cas lowers his arms and focuses singularly on Dean and the bottom of his stomach falls out and he can't hear the noise around them anymore and all he can see is blue. He can't actually tell how long they're standing there for, but it feels like forever and it might not even be the beer.
“Uriel,” Cas grits out. “What are you doing here?”
“Good night, Dean.”
saying?”
“Castiel!”
Dean pours the wet ingredients into the mixer and Cas sets it to a medium high speed.
Cas lays out the plan of attack for the evening on their way to Cas’. They would bake four batches of cupcakes, two vanilla and two chocolate, then four batches of classic chocolate chip while the cupcakes cooled and then were frosted.
Once the doors shut on the bus, it lurches into motion making everyone sway and stumble. Dean tries to reposition his stance with his limited range of motion and clings onto the bar.
Bart stopped pacing and spun around to face Castiel. “Cas. It’s not your friends. It’s just Dean. You only talk about him now. It’s “Dean this” and “Dean that.” I’m just tired of it, Cassie.”
Castiel froze.
“I thought we might go out on Saturday night,” Bart moaned. His tone changed quickly to something more flirtatious. “It’s been so long, Cassie. I miss you.”
Dean looks back to Castiel after Eleanor leaves. “What was that?”
“Then I guess that’s it,” Bart repeated, “I’ll just head out then…”
Dean and Castiel were closer than ever and Donna could barely remember a time when Dean was without Castiel. They may as well had been joined at the hip. They were found at recess playing soccer and tag with the others, their classmates embracing Castiel fully, though Castiel now always played on Dean’s team.
“I don’t know who you are, and it doesn’t matter. I don’t like you.” And that’s all the warning Uriel receives before he gets a fist to the face.
“I'm fine, Jodes. Got me thinkin’ of love, is all. And I’m just ready for my vacation with you.” She pulls herself from her chair and closes the distance between herself and Jody. It's just a quick kiss, they are still at school after all—but it leaves her wanting more.
Dean puts it down again and goes back to the kitchen. He opens the fridge and thinks about dinner. He has ketchup and half a can of beans. There is nothing he can make with that. He checks the cupboards. A dented can of soup. Yes. That means it’s pizza night.
Charlie rolls her eyes. She knows Becky has several wedding scrapbooks.
“Jeez, Cas, lighten up. It's just a job,” but Dean couldn't help the flush in his cheeks at the compliment.
Bart nodded and headed to the door, gathering his coat. “Good luck with Dean,” Bart said before shutting the door.
“What?”
“And Dean can be a pretty good loser! He’s used to it, anyway,” Victor teased.
Maybe not.
It’s a couple of weeks later when something happens.
Dean thought there was more time. There was this cute girl in his class, Stephanie, with dark gently curled hair, big blue eyes, and a great smile. He’d invited her back to the room for a little bit to “introduce her a great show he’d just found and she would love.” Oh, there is no show, they both knew it. Dean had casually mentioned that his roommate had class until four, leaving them with a solid two hours alone. Her eyebrow arched at the suggestion and simply told him to lead the way.
“You’re going to have to read it anyway for the report,” Dean countered, grinning. “But we could read it together. Do you want to come over after school today? You could meet my mom and dad and my little brother Sammy. I could read it you and Sam. He loves the Hardy Boys, too! And I have more that you could borrow if you want. They all used to belong to my dad when he was little.”
“And they're happy,” Ms. Hanscum says with conviction. Ms. Jones nods with a grin.
tongue. “I work at the library three blocks away from here.”
Castiel barely had a chance to think about a reply before a third text came through.
Cas suddenly looks very confused and Dean can't figure out why. “Someone you like?” he questions.
Dean tries to take as good of a look around as he possibly can. Wagging his head around to try and see between all the standing people, he isn’t able to make out the dark hair, blue eyes, or tan coat of the man from the last couple of days. Dean sighs to himself. No awkward glances or butterflies in his stomach today. No accidental hits or kicks either. He's undecided whether he's happy about that.
Dean thanks her and shoots her his usual dazzling grin. She looks momentarily stunned before she is able to smile back. He feels slightly comforted by the fact that he can shake someone up with just a smile. He can’t be nervous if he can still do that.
“Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?” Cas asked after they left.
“Awesome. Thanks,” Dean responds. Blue eyes bore into his. He takes a few seconds before he decides to continue. “Sorry again about yesterday. The bus just goes in all directions and all the people shove and--” Dean can feel himself rambling at the intense gaze directed at him and is grateful when he gets cut off.
Cas couldn’t remember the last time he’d been so happy. It had been a month since Dean was back in his life and it was like they were never apart. It helped that they spent nearly all their free time together. Cas had become a fixture for the Friday night not-a-study-session movie marathons with Jo and Alex and he was happy to count the two women as friends as well.
“Can I get your number?” Bartholomew continued quickly, whipping out his phone and unlocking it. He handed it to Castiel and read it aloud when it was handed back to him. “Well, it's been nice talking to you…Castiel. I'll text you and we can set a date.”
“Oh, god, Dean…” He looks up and Cas’ eyes are wide, hand over his mouth. “You’re bleeding.”
“Is that what you were wondering?” Cas turned thoughtful. “He’s probably still teaching. He loved it, even if he pretended to hate it. Maybe he finally decided to try writing his own textbook, seeing as he was always correcting the one we had to use.”
“Sorry,” Cas said, rolling his eyes. There was something about Bart’s attitude tonight that had Cas completely put off. “I’ve been spending a lot of time with him the past few weeks, so of course I’d talk about him.”
Dean looked confused at the thought. “But I like sharing with you. That's what friends do!”
The toast pops and Sam looks over his shoulder away from the stove for a moment and warns, “It’s hot,” before turning his attention back to scrambling the eggs.
“Thank you for inviting me over,” came a deep, rumbly voice from behind him. “I didn’t know what to bring, so I bought several flavours of chips.”
“You might be a better teacher than I thought.” Dean gives Cas a Look before letting him continue. “I think you need to keep teaching me.”
“Castiel and Dean.”
“Is everything okay?” Dean asked, concern evident as he entered the living room and headed right to the couch.
“Is this your stop too?”
They chatted a little bit longer before Bart ended the call to go back to studying. Castiel felt a little guilty for the sigh of relief he exhaled when he put his phone down. He couldn’t pinpoint what had him on edge, so instead he opened his current sketchbook to a blank page and began a few warm-up sketches.
She turned to face Dean and watched his face as she lifted her bottle to her lips. His eyebrows furrowed, “I’ve told you, he’s not my boyfriend. And he’s busy. I’m not his keeper.”
“I’m really feeling the love this morning,” Dean cheeks, as he surrenders the cup to his husband.
“It's nothing really,” Charlie says casually. “But maybe youandMsMills.”
“He was whiney. I didn’t like him.”
Cole answered on the fourth ring. “Hey, Deano. I was just thinkin’ about you.”
“I’ve felt like something has been missing since I moved away all those years ago. And I didn’t feel complete until I walked into your apartment and realized it was actually you.”
“Well, I think you’ve been spending too much time with Dean, for one.” Bart crossed his arms with a frown and Castiel couldn’t help but think he looked like a child.
Cas looks to Miracle for good luck before looking to Dean. "I'm baking you a pie. A pecan pie."
“Uriel came back a week later with a friend to help take the rest of his things,” Cas continues, derailing Dean's train of thought. “He said he couldn't be alone with me because he couldn't trust me with his back turned. It was then he implied he'd start rumours about me so it really wasn’t a surprise to hear them.” Castiel pauses and a funny quirk appears on his lips. “Though I was impressed at how creative some of them were.”
“Because you’re the one that told me all these rumours in the first place!”
“I went to the fancy donut place. I got eggnog, London fog, hot chocolate, lemon shortbread, winter vanilla, and toast and butter.”
"We did, but this is a bit of a gift for everyone, if you choose to share," Cas tells him with a grin. "Do you want to know what it is now?"
, he repeated to himself.
“There's going to be another one, too,” Castiel told him. “My Uncle Balthazar sent me this one from England. I could ask him to send a copy for you, too…if you want.”
Thanks for reading! <3
Dean decides to get the other two out at once. “I also heard that you host orgies. And that you're a pimp.” Castiel freezes at the words, eyes sharp in recognition.
“Hey, Cole. What’s going on?” Dean said into his phone.
“You ‘don’t think’?” Jo urged.
“Romantic?” Cas asked in shock. This was not where he thought this conversation would go. “There’s nothing romantic there. We’re friends and it doesn’t matter anyway because I’m with Bart. Bart is my boyfriend. I don’t even know why we’re talking about Dean!”
“Please don't let the threat of Uriel upset you any longer,” Cas tried to placate Dean, voice soothing. “When I filed my complaint about him with the school, I told them everything. I just asked them to not record the details. I also told them that he threatened to start rumours about me. They know to take what they hear about me with a grain of salt, at the very least.”
“We're friends?” Castiel asked in surprise.
“Good. I'm going to start measuring the chocolate cupcake ingredients now.”
“Is it?” Cas asks, confused. “It’s not our wedding anniversary. That’s months away.”
“You’re right,” he conceded. “We’ll make it work.”
His arm goes flying to grab the nearest pole, but instead collides with the man’s face. Dean feels his stomach drop.
“Sleep.” is all Cas says.
“Sure, Dean. That sounds like fun.”
The next time movie night rolled around, Dean couldn’t attend. Cole snagged them tickets to some show for the night so the three of them were in Jo’s dorm, crowded together on her single bed, Arrested Development playing on the TV in the background. It was the perfect opportunity for Castiel. Jo passed him the bowl of popcorn during a lull in their conversation and he decided to dive right in with his concern.
“Yes!” Dean exclaims out loud. He gets a few glances for his outburst before he realizes that he should probably text his
It was another work period, and the two boys were talking about Dean’s book this time.
She was really not a fan of supervising at recess when the weather got too cold out, but seeing the kids bundled up and playing was enough to keep Donna warm when it was her turn. That and her travel mug of fresh coffee. She was circling the field where she could see Dean trying to convince Castiel that soccer was fun.
“Well, Cas never talks about him. Ever. I've tried to be subtle about it--”
Donna was supposed to have a free period right now, but the district couldn’t find a sub, so in a scramble the staff were filling in with their prep time. She had lucked out on her assigned period because they had a test coming up and they had been directed to have a study period. The only real sounds were the turning of pages, the scratching of pencils, and the scuffing of feet. If they were passing notes, they were at least being quiet.
“When we were ten?”
“Well, I had to,” Dean defends. “I didn't like his attitude and I couldn't let him talk like that to someone I like.”
Victor took a big breath before starting. “Dean slept over and we watched all the Star Wars movies and ate popcorn and candy and we ate so much Dean almost puked but he still fell asleep first.”
Dean sits looking at him for a moment. Cas can practically see the moment on Dean's face when all the pieces fall into place. “Oh, are you gay?” Dean asks.
Dean was trying to change the topic, so Castiel let it happen, the awkward moment left behind. “I can’t just tell you the surprise twist.”
“I told you you didn’t have to bring anything,” Jo laughed lightly. When was the last time Dean had ever heard her use that placating tone? He didn’t think he’d ever heard her use it before. She must be really concerned about scaring this guy off. Maybe he should play nice for the evening. Maybe.
“Sure.” “Okay.” said Jo and Alex at the same time.
Dean is finding the process of measuring out the ingredients to be a soothing one. Scoop, pour, check, sprinkle, check, perfect, pour. He can't help but be satisfied at the times he gets the weight correct on the first attempt.
“Well, I will get out of your way. I'm sure you two would like the time to settle Dean in. I have to get to the library anyway.” Castiel grabs a backpack and is out of there before Dean can even get out that it's no problem for him to stay.
You can find me on Tumblr wasting my life
"My gift?" Dean asks, still confused. "I thought we all agreed no gifts."
“It’s a different kind of looking forward to, though, isn’t it?” Jo persisted, eyebrow raised.
“What’s that, dear?”
Donna glances at the clock behind her. She might have drifted off for a few minutes because fifteen minutes have already passed since the bell rang.
“You remembered that?” Dean asked in surprise.
“A pimp,” Dean says. It’s not even a question. “Sammy, you think that kid is a pimp? I guess he’s hiding the fur coat and chalice under the bed, huh? Come on, Sam. Did we even see the same person when we walked in together?”
“Can I kiss you?” he asks.
“Yeah, yeah,” was all she got in response.
“Yes,” he says simply. “I might have only just realized how I feel about you. And I mean
“And they’ve been together ever since,” Ms. Jones tells them.
“Dean,” Cas chastised. Dean gives Cas a look and he knows that Cas can tell because he's watching the red stain his cheeks.
‘That is great! When are you done work?’
Cas is still standing by the door. Now that Stephanie is gone, he looks a bit more rattled by what happened. “A drug addict now? Seems almost repetitive since we already heard the drug dealer gossip,” Cas says.
Krissy speaks up from the back, phone forgotten on her desk. “You mean you can’t finish it?”
Almost like the stranger can hear Dean’s thoughts, the hood comes down. Into Dean’s face. It would have been okay. Dean realizes that there is no space on the bus. And really, where would it have gone other than into his face? But this hood. It has the largest amount of fur trim. And it settles perfectly under Dean’s nose. Nearly immediately, he feels the urge to sneeze. He cranes his neck into an unnatural angle to avoid the fur. There’s no way he’ll be able to maintain this pose for the rest of his ride.
They leave the room, Donna getting the lights, and they leave for the night side by side.
“Okay, none of them are great,” he starts, patting Castiel awkwardly on the shoulder. “But it's hard to compare which one is the worst. They're all on different scales, really,” Dean tries to calm Castiel down.
Cas gives him a strange look that Dean can't quite decipher. “It's okay, Dean. You're right though. We never talked about this. Will you be bringing… people back regularly?”
Bart looked to Castiel sadly. “Maybe there’s nothing that can be done.”
“Well, hello there, Ms. Mills,” she greets with a grin. “Fancy meeting you here.”
“Oh, already? Amazing!” Cas perks up. “I have the electric mixer set up so we can start making the batter now.”
Dean bolts out the front door the next morning, quickly doing up his jacket.
“I guess I should get going. Don’t want to keep you from all the work you have.” Dean stands up and picks up his coffee cup. There is still a large amount of donuts left, but Dean decides to leave them all with Cas. He can share them or take them home.
Dean gasped in mock offense. “I will always need a babysitter. Especially the sexy kind.” He waggled his eyebrows, which just set Cas off on a laughing fit.
, read Dean's messy scrawl with a lopsided heart underneath.
Cas looks a little uncertain, but he says okay. They program their names into the computer and get ready to start.
When she saw Dean that day in the halls, his side looked empty without Castiel there, and he didn’t seem to have the same spring in his step as he once had.
“That’s cute--nice. Very nice.” Dean can feel himself start to panic. He changes the topic in the hopes that it will calm him down. “I brought your coffee. And some donuts. I didn’t know what kind you would like, so I got a few different ones. I like all of them, so you can have first choice.”
“But, it’s our anniversary, dear,” Dean says. “You don’t want to sleep through it.”
But he glances at the faded outline of the heart on his palm for the hundredth time today. He can do this. He can text Castiel.
“What about Bart? Has he been trying to make the time?” Jo prompted him to keep talking.
“Only if the feelings aren't returned, I'd guess.” Cas says nonchalantly.
he is offered and reviews it. “This doesn’t look too hard. Where are you?”
“I’m not about to shut him out of my life again to make you feel better, so I don’t know what you want me to do about this. I’m just not making that choice.”
The third day of Dean taking the bus was freezing--well below freezing, in fact. He had thrown on an extra sweater and wrapped his scarf around his neck and chin twice. His walk to his bus stop was at a brisk pace to warm himself up.
“So Cas,” Dean starts.
“Dean, didn't you see the sock?” Cas asks. There's a tone in his voice that Dean just can't quite place and he's still just. What. What just happened.
Dean falters at the question. He’s supposed to be asking the questions here. “Uhhh,” he says instead. “What have you heard?”
Cas snaps a photo of the last cupcake. Dean gives him a confused look. Sure, it was a nice cupcake but…
with me? I have it on my laptop.”
It only takes two minutes for everyone to leave and Donna is left alone in the room. She sighs in relief. Boy, she does love teaching, but she sure is ready for a break right now. And maybe a milkshake. She leans back in her chair and shuts her eyes for a moment.
Looking back, Dean can't recall exactly how he thought it was a good idea to coach Cas in such a physical way; he's not typically a touchy feely kind of person. Alcohol is such a peculiar thing. Dean's arms feel heavier and looser than they usually are and Cas is just so warm. Is it hot in here? Dean feels hot. And if Cas is warm and Dean wants to keep touching him, well, he's gotta get less warm. He peels off his sweater and goes in for another swig of beer while he's at it. Cas is looking at him kind of strangely when he turns back to their lane.
“Hey, Cole.” Dean took a deep breath and just went for it. “Listen man, I’m sorry, but this thing we have  isn’t working for me.”
“Hey!” she greeted warmly.
With the ease that Dean presented, one might have been concerned with him overshadowing the quiet Castiel, but Dean had a natural knack for knowing when to stop talking because Castiel had something to add. Donna couldn’t quite tell if it was because Dean was a natural at presenting or if it was the affinity he had developed with Castiel.
“Thank you,” he feels the words fall out of his mouth.
“Don't do anything stupid, Dean. You can't get kicked out of residence too. Then
The day her students were scheduled to present their work was always an anxious one for them. She could feel the apprehension when they came in from recess.
“Orgies and a pimp. Why not? Anything else I should know about?” he asks eerily calmly for someone that was a breath away from a panic attack a moment ago. Dean is startled at the change in demeanor and simply shakes his head no.
“Yeah, I think I am,” Bart told him and Castiel felt almost buoyant with the confirmation.
Castiel startled from his focus. “Sorry?”
“You’d have heard them eventually anyway! Jess doesn’t even go to your school and she heard them. This is big,” Sam says.
? The last episode was a cliffhanger.”
The two jump apart and look at who the voice came from. Standing just behind their table is a tall black man with a large smirk across his face. Dean has no idea who this guy is, but he can feel Cas tense up beside him.
Cas laughs before asking, “Why would that be something I wouldn't want to hear?”
“So you remember that they got married last year, right?” Ms. Hanscum asks.
Castiel pauses what he's doing to carefully grab the toast and butter the slices. Sam is on breakfast duty this morning since Dean decided to do a full Christmas dinner for them, Eileen, Jack, Jody and Donna, and their girls. Cas, newly human since his rescue from the Empty, still doesn't know much about cooking but he's proving to be a quick learner and he's always ready for the next lesson. This morning, in addition to helping with breakfast, he's working on his Christmas surprise for Dean.
When the end of the year came and she saw her class off, it was always a bittersweet time. She was definitely looking forward to relaxing, but she knew she would miss having a group of kids to smile at her every day.
“All right,” Castiel agreed quickly, putting his backpack on.
Jo laughed too. “And which do you want to do first?”
Dean showed her one more drawing of the two of them. This time they both had wands that were pointing at glasses filled with brown. “We can turn water into chocolate milk. It’s both of our favourite drinks!” Dean told her. The two boys smiled at each other.
Last week, they had spent an hour in the school library looking at books to choose. This week they were spending class time dedicated to the assignment.
“How about we finish the outline of all the areas we want to hit, then we can crack a beer while we divvy up who does what?” Dean suggested. Cole nodded petulantly and they actually got a little bit done. For the next five minutes. Dean did, at least. Cole moved his mouse and deactivated his screensaver.
Ms. Hanscum continues to look confused for a moment and Charlie could swear she saw the gears turning in her head and the exact moment it all clicks. She throws her head back and laughs, “Oh, that's the most popular topic. I didn't know people called it ‘shipping.’ We just call it regular ol’ gossip.”
Cas sighs in relief. “I guess that gives you a pass. But it’s not in my hand yet, so...” His hand appears from the depths of his blanket and makes a grabby motion.
It's only when Miracle starts licking at his ears (and he does
“Stop calling me Sammy. Someone else said they heard he was hosting orgies. He did seem a bit uptight for that though.”
