Sherlock gathered dishes and loaded them in the sink, but Mrs. Hudson chased him off. “You go spend time with John, dear. I know you want to.”
John pulled Sherlock’s shirt off and tossed it on the bottom of the bed, then nudged his jeans down until they sat low on his hips. He turned his palms toward Sherlock, fingers pointing down, and slid them inside Sherlock’s underwear toward his hips. “Tell me more about the magazine. Did you learn anything?”
Sherlock sat still as stone for the next several minutes. When he spoke, his voice was thick with anger. He spat his words into the space dividing them. “And then what would you have me do, John? What would you have me
John studied Sherlock’s face for a moment, smiled, and said, “Mi a 'smaoineachadh a tha thu àlainn.”
language, and Sherlock smiles and laughs as Ariki and Kahu’s eyes go wide with realization, and immediately begin trying out new signals on each other.
Sherlock shuddered, tensed, and pulsed. John thrust in, pulled almost all the way out, paused, and slammed back in, pulled almost all the way out, paused, and slammed back in, then one last time, called out
“Nope. And maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but she didn't ask about you at all, either, and I don't remember a single time in the last however many years that she didn't ask about you. She's always liked you more than me.”
Sherlock sucked in air, and John dived, a flash of strong back and firm ass before he sliced through the water.
“You look gorgeous in this light,” John said, trailing his fingers up and down Sherlock’s arm. “The way your hair shines and picks up the colors, the way they look on your skin, like you’re being painted. See there?”
Sherlock wrapped one calf and foot around John’s ass and rolled his hips up, pressing them together as hard as he could.
John hums and stands up tall to look Sherlock in the eye. "And that's what has you so flustered? You look like you just raced the length of the island and back." John presses himself up against Sherlock's chest. "And your heart is racing. And you feel warm. Are you getting sick?" John runs his wing over Sherlock's forehead. "Open your bill."
They headed north on Hyde Park Boulevard until they found Sip and Savor, a fair trade coffee shop popular with University of Chicago students. Paintings and photographs by Chicago artists hung on the purple, grey, and orange walls, and trays of locally made pastries were arranged on the counter tops. John refueled with a blueberry scone, and Sherlock recaffeinated with a large caramel royal latte.
Mrs. Watson was waiting for them. The F-100 hadn’t rolled to a stop yet, and she was coming down the brick house’s porch steps, waving with both hands.
"I'm fine," he answers, standing up and shaking himself back to order. "I trust you're fine, as well, since you saw me coming, and moved directly into my path?"
He is flush against the keel now, and he prods at the caught material with his bill. Definitely seaweed, and Himantothallus grandifolius to boot, the same type they collected for Cetus, to augment his healing supplies. This seaweed appears to be wrapped in a tight ball, and wedged into the narrow space.
They have not been back to their ice cave since Moringa’s surprise visit. There is little opportunity for free time, and when they have it, they cannot justify the potential risk. Even if, John tells Sherlock, they stand on opposite sides of the cave and take a nap, Moringa would be able to spin a tale of the two of them sneaking away, unchaperoned, to be adultish.
John pried Sherlock’s cheeks apart, nudging them open before repositioning his hands to get a firmer grip. Sherlock lowered his chest to the bed, rubbed his nipples over the sheets. He was fully erect now and throbbing, beading at the slit. John’s hands were warm and firm on him, a doctor’s steady touch, then they were ghosting over his skin, his fingers drawing circular designs over Sherlock’s gooseflesh. When John removed his hands to reposition himself on his hands and knees, Sherlock looked back over his shoulder. He needed John close, wanted him close.
John shot Sherlock a look over the top of his mother’s head, and Sherlock bit his lip to keep from laughing.
“Stephan may have deserved it, but it’s still technically an assault. I’m willing to keep my mouth shut, as are Mike and Phil. I was hoping Stephan wouldn’t make a big stink about it, but he’s Stephan, so he’s making a big stink.”
“Talk to your mother about it.” The woman with the clipboard flipped her hair over her shoulder and disappeared down the hallway.
“Your feelings are natural. You are an adolescent now, changing rapidly from a chick to an adult. The changes in your outward appearance are mirrored by changes inside your body, as well, and these developments are rather drastic at times.
“How convenient for him. How very thoughtful of you. But why on earth wouldn’t he try to call you before coming here? Why wouldn’t he ask if it were okay, first?”
They spend that night at the edge of the shelf, within sight of water. They discuss the plan for the morning. Upon waking, Anahera will fetch a strand of seaweed capable of securing the stone to Sherlock's body. Tui and Sherlock will assess the distance to Pobeda from their vantage point, and determine the best way to approach the island, weaving through any remaining floes. And then they will leave. They will leave the Shelf behind, and they will swim home.
John circled his fingertips around Sherlock’s knuckles, then drew his hand up in a straight line from the back of his hand, over his forearm, to his bicep. He stopped there and squeezed, humming. Sherlock wondered what was so interesting about his bicep. He wasn’t sure, but neither was he sure why it felt so good to have that bicep stroked and squeezed. Nor was he sure why just a little bit of kissing and attention to his arm would cause his penis to thicken the way it was. He shifted just enough to free it from where it was trapped against his pyjama bottoms and felt it continue to fill.
She has to extricate herself from his grip before she can ask what, exactly, she has done that is so brilliant. Tui seems as perplexed, although she would never question Anahera's brilliance.
“Off you go, then. I'm sure you have some important experiments to do, people to harass, laws to break.” He gave Sherlock a little nudge, and Sherlock grabbed a fistful of John's shirt to keep himself from falling onto the floor.
Moringa is too busy to get into trouble, Mycroft explains, and if her current duties do not soften her, if the sheer numbers of pengs in need of parents do not ease her worries about the future of emperor families, there is nothing left to be done for her.
Sherlock cannot stay if John doesn’t hear him, and he begins to drift back. The last glimpse he catches is his Johnling entwining his beautiful neck around Maryle’s. The storm disappears, as if sucked through a hole in the sky, and he sees white, all white, and then he hears a voice, coming to him from someplace beyond his heavy eyelids.
Anahera leads the way, Sherlock behind her, Mycroft behind him. They weave in and out of other penguins, everyone intent on carrying out some task. The calling has started, only a few voices to begin, but then more and more join as mates try to find each other. Those who were able to stay together throughout the migration did, but many were separated as they swam those long distances, chasing food, escaping danger.
John positioned himself on his hands over Sherlock, with his knees planted between his spread legs, then lowered his hips, brushing his erection down over Sherlock’s. He reached down, took his cock in hand, and touched the leaking head to Sherlock’s body. He guided himself in until he could let go, then lowered himself down to his elbows, and drove into Sherlock in one, long push.
, is the result of a "dramatic clash of galaxies." I prefer to think that it's Kororā, Pono, and their egg.
"Pāpā, you went to the Shelf and you just happened to meet a peng the color of a star, who just happened to have a same-peng
There was a loud clanging sound from the kitchen, then Kevin’s voice, louder than it needed to be. “
Sherlock tried to hang on to John through both their orgasms, tried to hear and see and touch all of it as it crashed over them, but the rush was too strong, the waves were too high, and when his mind came back to him they were both shaking and trembling, gasping for air, and then John, his beautiful John, burst into tears.
“Yup. Still talking. Leaning toward each other, smiling. Sipping wine. More smiling. More talking. Kevin just reached over and brushed some lint off Greg’s shoulder.”
John sniffed and laughed and shook his head. “You didn't hurt me. You obliterated me, but you didn't hurt me. I can't even tell you how good that was, how intense.”
Jimmy Somerville’s voice was hypnotic, rising higher and higher through the refrain, the words doing half time to the faster back beat.
. It did not matter to them that he was not the least bit interested in females, or that he didn’t feel the need to reproduce, or that he was resolutely, irrefutably, in love with Selvic, and Selvic with him.
Sherlock stretched out on the bed, pushing his fingers and toes in opposite directions as far as he could. He arched his back and rolled his head from side to side, circled his ankles, flexed and relaxed his quads and calves and ass. He smiled. He yawned.
Emperors really do parade around the colony after selecting a mate. I finally saw Snow Chick, and also learned that when the females come home after the eggs hatch, the males stand in a long line so that the females can walk past and better identify their mate. It's kind of hilarious, because they all look so much the same.
“I'm still mad for you,” Sherlock says, biting on John's earlobe and slipping a hand into his pyjama bottoms.
“It’s okay. It’s kind of nice, actually. You looked like you were going to go hunt down ‘this Kevin guy’ and tell him to stay away from your man. Kind of hot.”
The brothers treat their limited time together like a favourite gift, something to cherish, and not take advantage of, lest it become common. By the time Mycroft departs, Sherlock has many more memories for his ice palace, and a few words of wisdom from his older sibling.
“Yeah. The church is having their annual rummage sale and my mom is volunteering again. The more she donates, the bigger the discount she gets at the pre-sale.”
They ate their chili in the moonlit kitchen, chased it down with glasses of cool water, and went back upstairs.
“Anyone’d have to have been blind and deaf around here this summer to not see what was going on. What with all the half-watched movies, and messing up the hay loft every other day, and sneaking blankets out of the house. And the laundry, my dear lord, the laundry.”
“I let go and fell back into the water, and had to stay there. I think you went to lie down in the sun, or get dressed, and I, well, yeah.”
The house is quiet when he returns, and for a moment he misses Imi, with all her giggling and imagination and energy. He puts his keys, phone, and wallet in a ceramic bowl that she made at school and shrugs out of his jacket. He hears water running in the kitchen and the washing machine in its final spin cycle. Through the windows at the back of the house he sees sheets hanging on the line, each one precisely pinned as if measured with a tape laser and leveling device, each side the same length, each clothespin equidistant from the next. He has to laugh. Only Sherlock would turn the laundry line into an exact mathematical equation.
The parade feels like an interminable crawl and a ride on a shooting star, all at the same time. Sherlock’s body buzzes with John at his side, walking in unison as a newly bonded couple. As they make their way around in a circle, with dozens and dozens of other couples behind them, the rest of the colony calls out sounds of celebration. All eyes are on them, but Sherlock hardly notices. His eyes are fixed on John, who holds his head high, and puffs his chest out with pride.
He came to stand near Sherlock and swiped across the screen to show him the first photo. In it, Sherlock stood in profile and was leaning close to the mosaic. John had filled the left side of the frame with a close-up of Sherlock; the mosaic spilled over every other border. Unaware of John taking the photo, Sherlock was focused on a group of musicians holding string instruments, his gaze slightly higher than eye level. His chin was tilted up, and his jaw was a strong outline beneath the shadows cast by his cheekbones. His cheeks were pink from the cold, and his lips were slightly parted and shiny from having just licked them. His hair was mussed from the wind, and one lone curl curved across his forehead near his temple.
Sherlock wanted to tell him he could have anything, everything. Instead, he nodded his head toward the dresser, and John went over, opened a drawer, and pulled out a plain white undershirt. He closed that drawer, opened the one underneath, and retrieved a red, long-sleeved shirt that said
She has tears in her eyes when she rights herself. “Well,” she says, sniffing into the underside of her wing. “She scared me half to death, but I must say, this is an outcome beyond what I could have imagined.”
“All right, then. Let's do it. Let's start with the positives. Number one. Mary is never coming back. Unlikely as it was that she ever would, and as insignificant as it would be now that Hannah's an adult, it's nice to know that she really can't do any harm.”
Tui comes around to face him, holding out more snow. He eats from her wingtips, grateful for this unquestioning hospitality. Anahera trusts Sherlock, and Tui trusts Anahera. He trusts them both.
Sherlock pulls his phone out of his pocket and John immediately says, “Oh no, no you don't. No photos, unless it's of the three of us.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock dragged his fingertips to John’s sides, and ran them through the hair under John’s arms. He applied firm pressure, not wanting to tickle, but to explore. He pressed his fingers into John’s lats and delts, cupped his palms against John’s armpits. He smeared his hands down John’s ribs to his belly, traced them over his hips, then slipped them down and around to his ass.
"A Christmas Story" is a 1983 movie set in the 40s, and if you've never seen it, you should. It's hilarious.
Erebel lifts her head and shoots Sherlock a woeful look. He clears his throats and nods his head toward Janine, encouraging his little one to pay attention.
Sherlock traced the slope of John's nose with the tip of his, and whispered against his lips, “Then I think you'd better hurry up and get me naked.”
Sherlock maneuvered himself onto his back, despite John’s death grip around his waist, and then rolled over onto his side, facing John. He had every intention of explaining to John why they needed to get up, but first, he needed to stare at John, because John was beautiful. John looked tousled and puffy and pink with sleep and shared body heat. His eyes were closed, and his lips were forming the tiniest of smiles. John’s naked shoulder and chest were visible above the duvet, which had slipped down when Sherlock had rolled over. John was so beautiful.
He pulled at a loose thread on the blanket beneath him. “There was no need for you to sleep on the floor, John.”
"Tiny Bat John, you must admit, you've had quite a hand, em, wing, in the condition of my erectile tissue."
John laughed and held his hands out to the sides. “Same guy, still attached to his hip. I’m not sure I remember you, to be honest. Must’ve been a long time ago.”
Sherlock is swirling his wine in his glass and looking at John from under long lashes, a telling smirk on his mouth. He hooks his ankles around the legs of John's chair and pulls him closer to the table, then plants his feet on either side of John's and presses his knees into John's thighs.
Sherlock shrugged and looked past John's ear. “The physics of it may make it difficult. Or,” he said thoughtfully, “the physics of it might make it amazing.”
Sherlock lifts his head and tries to swallow back his tears. John’s precious face is wet with tears, his eyes flooded with them, and yet he is trying hard, so hard, to buoy Sherlock, to give him the love and courage that he needs to do what his father has asked of him. He will try. He will try to be strong for John.
John giggled and grabbed Sherlock’s jaw so he could pull him away from where he was nibbling on his neck and give him a kiss. “Mmm. Come here. I need to kiss you now.”
“No. Everything I said, it was all true. I don’t need the tooth. I need you. I can’t do this without you, John. I won’t.”
There is a hush over the assembly now. Sherlock is not surprised to see that the other chick is standing as straight as he can, his eyes forward, his bill slightly parted in concentration.
“‘Well, you should have seen her face, Sherlock. I'm sorry, I hope she doesn't take it out of John's hide, but I'm not going to pretend that the two of you aren't together. Anyway, she went real pale like, and said she'd really love the recipe for my apple tart, even though she's the one who gave it to me, fifteen years ago if it was a day, and she just turned around and walked downstairs and out the front door.’
Thank you, happierstill, for seeing this through with me. You said you weren't a beta, but you totally were.
Now my negative emotional statement is followed by a positive (or at least a neutral). It's a more balanced way of thinking.
“That’s a good question.” Sherlock got up and poured more coffee into both their cups. “What did we do here, last winter? It’s so boring.”
John moved slowly. He licked slowly, slid his lips up and down slowly, stroked slowly. Sherlock’s breath seemed to pick up exponentially and in direct contrast to the pace of John’s mouth, but when John released Sherlock and hovered, the tip of his tongue a hair’s breadth from Sherlock’s frenulum, Sherlock stopped breathing altogether.
John and Sherlock stood and thanked her for helping out, then sat again as she bumped and jostled her way through the crowd and disappeared.
. Eventually they stopped exchanging pleasantries, and Sherlock grabbed John by the hand and dragged him away. “I’m going to show him all the changes you made to the new bedroom.”
“I can’t ask him to go, Sherlock, not knowing his life’s in danger. I don’t think you would ask that of me, and I don’t think you’d do the same, yourself. Sherlock?”
John inched his foot forward, inhibitions lessened by the drink, and rubbed his toe against the arch of Sherlock’s foot. “Maybe you’ll come with me.”
Sherlock braced his feet on the edge of the bed and slid one hand down his chest and stomach. He reached inside his shorts and palmed the head of his cock, spreading the leaking fluid over his rigid shaft before taking himself in hand. He began rutting into the channel of his fingers, gasping, while John murmured encouragement in his ear. It took just four, five, six slick, hard tugs and he was there, legs tensing, neck arching, mouth frozen open. Coming.
“I know you are. I didn’t mean to worry you. It wasn’t really a big deal. I was taking a shortcut to the lab and saw this guy coming out of the back door of the Baker Library.”
John leaned down and kissed Sherlock, kissed him all over his face and mouth. Sherlock put his hands on John's waist and kissed him back, and John rolled his hips and lowered himself until his balls were resting on Sherlock's shaft.
When they are done with that, they fulfil their pengsitter duties together, watching over curious hatchlings as they wander farther and farther from the safety of their mothers’ feet. The single emperors of the colony work together to keep the chicks safe from overhead birds, or straying too far, or slipping into cracks in the ice. Several times already, Sherlock and John have reunited lost chicks with their mothers, turned wayward fluffballs back toward the colony, and pulled wobbly walkers back to their feet.
"He'd surprise you, Mrs Hudson. I was just telling him he could have been a doctor, what with the way he took care of me just then when I was hurling into the toilet."
Making John lose his mind is one of Sherlock's most favourite pastimes. John is his rock, his anchor, his ballast and bower, and taking him apart, reducing him to a mess of mindless panting and whining, is insanely satisfying. Sherlock plays it out now, fucking John's cock into his mouth until John is close, then backing off and kissing his hips, blowing on his wet flesh, whispering into his thighs. John begs and pleads, prays
John came back to bed with a wet flannel for Sherlock and after Sherlock had cleaned himself up and flung the flannel over the side of the bed, he curled himself around John’s body and sank toward sleep. Maybe his brain had stopped fighting him, and maybe he needed to stop fighting his brain. Maybe, with John, he was finally finding peace with himself.
Mrs. Watson scurried around the kitchen, pulling out napkins and forks and putting them on the table, before rushing off to get the next thing she needed to feed her boys.
John kissed his inner thighs and soothed his palms over Sherlock’s hips and lower back. When he could, Sherlock rolled onto his side, and stared up at the ceiling.
Sherlock was aware of everyone’s eyes on him and John, but he kept his own eyes forward and concentrated on the feel of John’s steady arm against his and the progression of their footsteps. The music swelled and receded as they reached the altar and took their places facing each other. Sherlock heard his mother sniffle and rummage through her purse, probably for a tissue.
John turns his face to the side, and sighs. Sherlock knows he has seen what Sherlock heard only a moment ago. They’re coming.
Victor's mouth was tight and wet and his fingers were long and slender, and Sherlock would writhe and whine until Victor pulled his hair, hard, to still him. Sherlock would freeze then, and spread his legs wide, hold his breath, and wait for the first breech. Afterward they would fall asleep wrapped up in the damp sheets, the scent of their shared sweat and cloves lingering well into morning.
He had to prepare for the possibility that that was exactly how he'd spend the rest of his life, dejected, rejected by the only person who would ever matter, and so he spent the last ten days of the bet lining up his queue with pictures of hedgehogs and otters in all manner of embrace. Really, it was remarkable how clever people on Tumblr were, and also slightly preposterous, but if people wanted to waste their time drawing pictures of otters in blue scarves and hedgehogs in cream jumpers, who was Sherlock to fault them?
“I really, really am.” Sherlock reached down and spanned his long fingers over that ass. “Do you want to go? We probably won't have a lot of other options on a Monday night. But we don't have to, if you don't want to.”
“Now that I’m looking this stuff up I realize what you’ve been doing for me all the time, before, you know, to get ready.”
over there, there, yonder, used to imply distance from the present time, that, which, who, I wonder, to wed, marry, sun, day, sail, by way of, via
Sherlock steps back and undoes his own belt, buttons, and flies, while John takes off the rest of his clothes. He’s done before Sherlock, and he leans back against the dresser and absentmindedly plays with the tags hanging around his neck, watching Sherlock reveal more and more of himself.
Sherlock watches as John looks anywhere but at him. His Johnling seems so uncomfortable with the compliment. Is that it, Sherlock wonders, or is John uncomfortable about something else?
"Hey there, listen to me, okay? Imagine if the story ended here. That truly would be an awful ending, wouldn’t it? That’s how it ended when Pāpā and I were your age. It has a different ending now, and I promise it will get better."
Sherlock smiles, lost in his thoughts, and dabs on a bit more lip gloss. He sweeps all of his preparations into the drawer, glides it shut, and fluffs his hair with his fingertips. He dims the bedroom lights and checks that the candles aren't burning too high, he plumps the bed pillows and closes the bathroom door, then he scoops up his discarded clothes and tosses them into the hamper. He is ready for John's birthday, ready to give himself.
“I rather think our offspring is the result of a great amount of love, Erebus. She most certainly does belong to you as much as she does me.”
. He settles on an answer that he hopes will serve him better than it will Nikau. “What do you know about them, the Rūnanga?”
“Remember when we helped Greg move into Kevin’s place, and I was a filthy mess, and you were really turned on and said you were going to get me really clean, and I said that cleanliness was next to Godliness, and you said—”
Sherlock tried to keep his eyes open, because John's eyes were still open. John's eyes were open, and they were looking at Sherlock, and Sherlock didn't want to miss one second of those eyes on him.
Sherlock turns to John, squeezes his hand, studies his face. John knows this expression, the one that means that Sherlock is sorting words, slotting them into space, figuring out how to deliver them in the best possible way.
“Erebus. You must have considered your own battle over a long time ago, and I am sorry to see it rekindled now, especially so soon after the loss of your beloved Selvic.
And now here they were, and sexy-as-fuck John wanted to tell straining-shirt-Sherlock exactly how gorgeous he was, and Sherlock wanted to hear every word.
John's belly is tickling Sherlock's back, and Sherlock wants him to never move. John lets Sherlock's wing down and lifts up the other. "They move just like a skybird’s wings, though, the exact same movements."
“I’m on duty until midnight. Meet me in the cherry bar a little after then, and I’ll take you up on your offer.”
The vinyl seat stuck to his shoulders and the backs of his thighs, and the steering wheel scorched his palms, but the anticipated relief of the quarry was salve enough. Maybe the water would wash away the weight of his self-imposed isolation, and maybe it would steel his resolve. Maybe it would shake free dreams of his best friend's chest heaving against his splayed fingers, and his tongue in his mouth, and his ass set down in his lap.
Then John slides down Sherlock’s body, he runs his hands down Sherlock’s chest, pushes his shirt up as high as he can, strokes his fingers across Sherlock’s nipples and pecs and down his ribs, into the shallow bowl of Sherlock’s belly, trails his fingertips down into Sherlock’s nest of hair, and he shushes him, tries to settle him, and then when he’s done all he can do, he takes Sherlock in his mouth, and holds him there, willing the daft genius to breathe before he passes out, because passing out after an orgasm is quite acceptable, but passing out before you get there is a bit not good.
“Apologies. Apparently I said, in the tone of a wispy little feather floating on the wind, that it must have just died, or it'd be completely covered over by now.’”
"Your seams are perfect, as always. Be good to this one, he is in desperate need of connection, the poor man."
“You are the most special thing in my world, Sherlock Holmes, and yours is the only name in my little black book. Just your name, over and over and over on every single page. I will respect you and love you and make it my life's work to make you happy.”
Italian Christmas cookies. I have no faith in a small Midwest town’s ability to produce an authentic platter of these, but it’s my fic, and I want them to have Italian Christmas cookies. The best are from the Bronx.
Sherlock woke up with his hand trapped between his cock and the mattress. His hips ground out short and shallow thrusts into sheets; he stilled them. His heart was racing and he was breathing fast, but the subject of his arousal slept peacefully next to him, unaware of what he’d just been doing to Sherlock in his dreams. Sherlock rolled over and withdrew his hand from his pyjama bottoms. He cupped his balls with one hand and let those subconscious images replay in his mind.
He handed the envelope over to Sherlock, who swallowed his molested strawberry, and wiped his hands on his napkin before taking it.
Lestra nods in agreement. "Yes, that's correct. And honestly, I can't imagine the others will take any of this seriously."
Sherlock pressed a quick kiss to John’s lips, then excused himself to get to work. He had a life to save.
Anahera is already there, a beacon of white in the dark depths. There are tendrils of red curling around them, slick blood spreading slowly through the water. Anahera has Tui grasped in her wings from behind; she wriggles her body and kicks her feet, fighting toward the surface. Sherlock arrives in a heartbeat, slips his wings around Tui from the other side, and working together, he and Anahera climb toward safety.
“SHERLOCK! Have you completely lost your mind? It’s two o’clock and here you are, covered in … in …”
“No. You will be most helpful here, now. When I get back to Pobeda I will tell Māmā and Pāpā what has transpired. They will be so very proud of you. And you will come back, when you are done here, and then it will be your turn to tell us all the news, and what has been decided. Yes?”
Sherlock watched John as they moved from room to room, observing as he picked up various objects and inspected them as if seeing them for the first time.
“Ready to go see the tennis hut?” John stepped into the bathroom and wrapped his arms around Sherlock from behind, pressing his cheek to Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock poured more syrup on his waffles and nodded. “One hour. We need to talk about Chicago, too.”
“Easy enough. Are you sure you don’t want to do it sooner? We could go back to the hotel right now and I could—”
The second morning they found Sherlock atop a strewn stack of newspapers and magazines in Daddy's den. This, too, was worthy of a fond chuckle, because the thought of baby Sherlock escaping his cot to read up on international foreign policy was simply adorable.
John hangs on every word, sometimes nodding in understanding, sometimes shaking his head in disbelief, but always staring right into Sherlock’s eyes, and always touching Sherlock as he speaks. Those touches are very distracting to Sherlock.
. My brain just scrambles. All the different levels of analysis and observation get confused. Things come up that should stay down. Things that should stay on top disappear. I say things I shouldn’t say, so I can only assume I’d also not say things maybe I should say.”
“You will.” John smiled and stood up. He walked to the fireplace and rearranged the logs with the poker, set the tool back with the others, and returned to the couch. He sat at a respectable distance and squeezed Sherlock’s ankle.
Sherlock keens long and low in his throat, and his fingers grasp at the air, and John reaches down and rolls Sherlock’s balls and that does it, that does the trick, because Sherlock is coming, coming hard, coming around a bit off cry and through the rigid set of his shocked limbs and past John’s tongue and lips, and when it’s over John wipes his mouth on Sherlock’s shaking thigh and kisses his hip and says, “We’ll humanize each other, love, yeah?”
Sherlock finished jotting notes in his notepad, swung the cover shut, and slipped it back into his pocket. John experienced a tinge of déjà vu when Sherlock turned around, seeing before him a younger version of the man, one who lit up like Christmas over a locked room murder, or an impossible hound, or an ancient cipher that spelled out corruption. Switched on, that’s how Sherlock looked right then. Enjoy it while it lasts, John thought. This next bit might not be as delightful.
“It was torture. I wanted to bend you over, put your hands against the wall, and kneel behind you. I could imagine it, you know, your balls hanging there, dick hard as a rod, and you begging me, absolutely begging me to do that to you.
“Hey, no, it’s all right. But can I answer your question with another one? Why would tonight be our last date?”
John kissed the damp curls on the top of his most extraordinary person’s head and ran his hand down the back of his soft pyjama shirt. “Mmm. It’s a good story. We’ll edit in more kissing when you’re feeling better, all right?”
Rudy nodded. “Yeah, that makes sense. Anyway, we convinced Kevin to have the party anyway, and we all brought a friend or two. Maybe he’ll meet someone new. You never know.
The drive was uneventful, the trip made easier by the car’s DVD player, comfortable seats, and functioning heaters. They took turns driving, John doing most of the run until they hit Milwaukee, then Sherlock taking over for the last two and a half hours. They passed the outlet malls, the miles of forest preserves, and the industrial parks, and when 294 split, they followed the signs for 94 and found themselves in the northern suburbs of what locals called Chicagoland.
“No, but I don’t want to cause mass hysteria on the streets. Too much Watson on view could drive the crowds wild, you know.”
Sherlock had considered how John’s parents might react. Would it make it better, or worse, that the man involved was Sherlock, their “other son,” their son’s lifelong best friend? Would they feel betrayed?
“I didn’t tell you because I knew you would say no. I thought if I didn’t tell you until this morning you’d, I don’t know, have less time to say no.”
Ignoring John, he listed off more mundane details regarding window treatments, shower curtains, and a new sterilising system for his test tubes. He wanted the flat to be perfect for John when they moved in, not a chore for him to have to deal with. By the time they’d reached the pinnacle of Fonab Hill, both out of breath but still able to comment on the stunning landscape laid out before them, they’d mapped out a thorough idea of what needed to be done to make 221b more comfortably habitable.
Each morning, John and Sherlock take turns keeping Tui company, while the other goes afield with Anahera. At first, Anahera resists leaving her
Sherlock’s ability to make conversation with his older brother stalled at that point, but after a few awkward seconds John took control and got things back on track.
“It’s fantastic. Your style is minimalistic without being sterile and you have tons of space, which is somewhat rare for modern construction. And who wouldn’t be impressed with the views?”
Sherlock lets John go, knowing that there is nothing in the world that can separate them now. They have faced what they thought was an insurmountable obstacle, reconciled themselves with a difficult path, and have come through on the other side even stronger than before.
Far below him John sleeps, unaware that he is now cuddled up to Molling instead of Sherlock. The sun will rise soon, and Sherlock’s plan does not include being yelled at by one very
“Sounds delicious.” John was staring right at Sherlock and licking his lips again. Sherlock had a vision of cream smeared across those lips and briefly wondered what would happen if he had a coronary at the table.
“You seem like an intelligent young man. Let’s review, shall we? I’m a heart surgeon. I earn an excellent living. I own the penthouse floor of a luxury building downtown. I drive a jag. In comparison, your current companion is a pale, skinny drunk in need of a haircut. Am I making things any clearer?”
John came back into the living room, carefully carrying their coffee. Had Sherlock already had the coffee in his hand, he’d undoubtedly have spit out a mouthful as John’s rear end came into view, with one corner of the blue dish towel tucked into his left pocket, and another corner tucked into his right.
“No. I want to make you so warm.” John kissed him again, sweet and slow, and then sat up, hopped off the car, and opened the back door.
Neither of them had explored the gay nightlife in their respective college towns, and both were wary of doing so on their own. Chicago, they thought, the first officially recognized gay village in the United States, would be the perfect place to experience the broader social tableau.
“Noo-o-o-o,” Sherlock chuckled. He crossed the room and pulled John close to him. He pressed his lips to John’s temple and said, “John, I can’t seriously condone violence against pompous surgeons who are stupid enough to think they can woo you away with the promise of a ride in a fancy car.
Sherlock did as told. John ran the bottom of the spoon over Sherlock’s lower lip, smearing the pudding as he went. He slid the spoon into Sherlock's open mouth, and let it rest on his tongue. Sherlock licked, sucked, and swallowed. John stared. Sherlock winked.
The Reliance Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970; and on January 7, 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.[2]
“But does that mean we must involve them in all such matters? If there is not already an emperor law banning some sort of egg-by-proxy, then perhaps it serves us best not to bring it up at all, and let each couple choose their own way.”
This time, Kevin and Greg stood so that John could shuffle out, and the four of them shook hands, hugged, and promised to be in touch soon. Then Mycroft stood, and Sherlock and John repeated the process with him.
John had left him a message. John had called him an Adonis. John thought he was the luckiest man in the world. John needed to be naked two hours ago. John had better be standing, zipped up, and ready to go right this very second.
John and Sherlock stare at each other, and the seriousness of the topic settles over Sherlock. This isn't about Maryle, or Janine, or John, or Sherlock. This is about all of them.
“John and I found an ice cave halfway up the berg. We go there sometimes to hang out. We like to bring special items we find –”
John had come home and found Harry even worse off than she’d been when he left. He couldn’t move her into his small army bedsit, but he could check her into rehabilitation, and so despite her arguments and resentment she eventually agreed and allowed herself to be admitted. Sherlock wanted to believe that he’d be as selfless as John when it came to caring for a sibling in such distress, but he couldn’t imagine Mycroft ever asking for help, let alone needing it. Mycroft had always been in control and in charge of those around him, whether they wanted him to be or not. Sherlock had been on the controlled end of things many times and would prefer to never be there again.
Erebus smiles. "When it is time to mate? You will know, Sherlock. Your feelings for John will guide you, and you will learn together."
“Should one ask a question, consider it asked by all. Should one allow an answer, consider it allowed by all. Should one announce emperor law, consider it announced by all. You shall address each of us the same,
“You are such a lying sack of shit.” John giggled after he said it, and God, Sherlock loved that giggle.
John shrugged. “I cleaned up best I could before the ceremony started, so I doubt you’ll see my pants hanging off a bedpost or anything.”
“Oh, right.” Sherlock felt John’s hands return to his thighs, up high, near his balls. "So the captain of the fire department figured out who did it and took him back to his room to talk to him about it. The college guy was thinking about how hot the captain was in his uniform, and how fit he was, stuff like that. When they get back to his room the kid tried to apologize, thinking maybe he could impress the captain with his honesty, but the captain just sat on his bed and told the kid to lie over his lap with his underwear down around his thighs. He didn’t even have him take them off, he just wanted them stretched tight under, under his ass.”
Mycroft tapped his index finger on the file folder and pushed it across the coffee table. He picked up the tumbler of whiskey John had poured him, leaned back against the cushions of the armchair, and let out a long sigh. “This was incredibly foolhardy of you, Sherlock. Of both of you.”
“Bees. You’ve frequently said how much you admire bee society. The segregation of the Queen? Drone death after mating? Communicating through dance?”
They were quiet then, John stroking Sherlock’s arm while Sherlock resumed his place tucked up under John’s chin. He could hear John’s heart beating, steady and sure like John himself.
Losing control of himself, Sherlock arched his back off the bed, seeking as much of that hot wet mouth as he could. John went up on one arm and moved back to give Sherlock space but Sherlock closed the distance by rolling to his side and coming up over John, placing one hand on the back of John's head and pressing his chest down against his open mouth. From that angle, he could see over John's shoulder, and what he saw was that John had removed the picture of James from his bedside table.
“Dorothy, this is a fine spread you've cooked up for John's last breakfast at home. Why don't you go get yourself cleaned up, and come back down when you're ready. Harriet, get your elbows off the table.”
John started to put things away with more force than Sherlock thought was entirely necessary. Fix this, he thought, fix this.
John heard the bees before he saw them, and shortly after he heard Sherlock. “Bees? You found bees for me? Hives? Oh. Oh, John.”
It was Sarah, over chicken salad and cheeseburgers, who slapped the table top and said ‘enough is enough.’ John wasn’t going to bring it up at all, but after telling Sarah all about their trip to Chicago, she had asked if his mom had warmed up at all to the reality of their relationship. Sherlock had listened while John told her about his mom’s religion-based arguments and what he assumed were her fears that his behavior would reflect badly on her in their small town.
“This is amazing,” John said, holding up an antique ceramic dish with his family crest painted in the centre. “She’s completely kept the essence of the house but made it more livable, less stuffy. It’s like it’s the same place, just … lighter, more us.”
James reached across the table and grabbed the bottle of wine. John pushed an empty wine glass toward him and watched as James poured himself an inch of wine and downed it in one gulp.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and smirked. “Well, I can think of some things we can do. And I swear to God, if anyone knocks on that door, I’m not answering it.”
“I have another instrument I’d like to you play. Like this one, it’s long and hard and has a place at the top for you to place your mouth.”
He knew that John would not lie to him, and therefore he could trust that 1. John was not happy that James was here, 2. James did not know that the house would be occupied, and, 3. James did not come for John. What else did he know? He knew that John wouldn’t turn away a friend in need and, if he were honest with himself, he respected that. Also, John loved him. And he loved John.
He slid down John's body and let John arrange his legs against Sherlock's back and between his calves. He rested his head in the hollow of John's hip and nuzzled into the soft cotton under his nose, where John smelled like sweat and musk and that very best thing of all, John. He rested his free arm on the top of John's thighs, elbow bent, and slipped his hand under John's pants, with his thumb in the crease of thigh and groin and his fingers splayed toward his hip.
Sherlock smiled at John, who thought he’d found a way to get around this, a way to prove something to Sherlock. Oh, John.
Sherlock took a deep breath and made himself keep going. “The kid was so desperate to get off, oh God, John, please, he was bucking his hips up and down, and the captain told him to behave or the spanking would just get worse, but the kid couldn’t control himself. He dropped the glove and started begging the captain to touch him, to please let him come.”
“The miscommunication was only that, Sherlock. I knew what she intended to do, but did not think to ask where she intended to do it. She assumed I knew. You thought the plan involved a different solution, and so had no reason to believe she would leave Pobeda. We were all acting without full information. Anyway, all is right again, yes?”
“All right then, that’s settled. Mycroft cannot accompany Velo and Pavo to the Shelf as his presence is required on Sherlock and John’s
Sherlock makes tiny adjustments, rolling his hips and arching his back, and John knows he's found that sweet spot when Sherlock jerks his head back and hisses
“Before they left dinner tonight Daniel told James he hoped he wasn’t being presumptuous, but that he’d made a reservation for tomorrow night at Caffe Scozia. It’s right in the centre of town, surrounded by other buildings, and only a three minute walk to the train station. Plus, I bet if we checked we’d find out that he’s booked a table by the front windows.”
“I mean, I know we’re going home for the winter break in a couple of weeks, so we won’t actually be here for Christmas,” John continued, “but I figured we should decorate and enjoy the run up, right?”
Sherlock sees in her eyes the broken shell lying at their feet. He sees her stretch out her glossy black wing to bring him in close, and hears her promise him magnificence, and bless him with strength of heart. He sees her study his shell, and he hears her speak of a long path, and of trust, and love. He, his
I hope you all like this chapter as much as I do. Once again, Sherlock went where he needed to go, and did what he needed to do. I just sort of wrote it down.
Cetus takes a deep breath, humming in consideration when he exhales. His expression is a study in focussed concentration.
He turns with as much regard for the slippery path beneath him as he can, and retreats toward the last turning point in the path. He has explored as much of Cassiopeia as he can, one nook and cranny at a time. If he couldn’t find a way to continue, he figured that no one else would be able to, either, and rules that part of the berg out of consideration. He hasn’t found a thing, but the pinnacle of the mountain remains unexplored, still out of reach, perhaps forever unattainable.
Ever since they parted ways with Erebus earlier in the day, John has been perseverating on their brief contact with absolute, unmitigated power.
“I don’t know. Shame you’ll never find out,” Sherlock mumbled into the sweat and salt covering John’s neck.
“It’s like my nervous system recognizes your proximity before my mind does. My stomach pulls up, tight, and my breath catches, and my heart skips, and then starts racing. I get this quivering feeling, like a shot, right through me, head to toes. And I want to reach out for you, but I’m temporarily paralyzed by this massive surge of adrenaline, and when it stops, I feel like I’ve been electrocuted.”
“This house doesn’t meet your specifications, or you’d have already seen it.” She stuffed the papers back into the folder, ready to call it a day.
“Nah, I know you are. It’s just, um, amazing to hear you say it. Those words, your voice, yeah. It’s good.”
They review the distances they’ve travelled, and what remains. Mycroft teaches Sherlock sophisticated methods for mapping their precise location in the sea, triangulating themselves in relation to the stars, the Shelf, and Pobeda, and Sherlock listens, rapt, hungry for new knowledge now that his Junior Council training is over. He consumes new constellations, new combinations of clusters, new ways to read the blackness in between.
Sherlock was dying. He was going to die, and John would have to tell Mrs. Hudson, and his parents, and everyone, that he'd rimmed Sherlock to death.
Sherlock hummed deep in his throat, rubbed, and licked, and John’s entire body spasmed, his torso curling forward, his legs coming up and off the mattress.
Sherlock doubts this very much. He is no more a hero than John is a rockhopper. He’s about to argue his point, but John keeps talking. “Sherlock, you stabbed that seal in the eye to save Tui. And have you already forgotten about your journey? About delivering the tooth to the High Council, and finding the heartstone? I killed one stupid skybird with a stone. You have delivered justice to an entire species. You’re the hero, not me.”
Sherlock got up to pour himself another cup of tea, turning his back, but not his ear, on the conversation. He could feel his face flushing hot and his heart rate speeding up, felt the prickles of fresh sweat under his arms. He couldn't help but think of the very things that John did to Sherlock that made him sleep, exhausted him, reduced him to a trembling, gasping heap of incoherence. John touched him and kissed him and stroked him and … he felt the burn spread down his neck and over his chest. John … John
He was good at everything, perhaps, except relationships. John didn’t need to know about that, though, and he most certainly didn’t need to know about Victor. That was all in the past.
Sherlock shuddered. The chances of him falling back to sleep while in this state were slim, especially with John lying right there, solid and warm and delicious. If John woke up right now, if he turned around and wrapped Sherlock in his arms and pressed them together, tight, Sherlock wouldn’t be able to stop himself. He squeezed John’s hip a little harder and kissed a small kiss onto John’s shoulder.
I'm posting this from my phone while sitting in a pub on Achill Island, Ireland. Remote doesn't begin to describe it.
“So you’re saying it might have been windy enough to shift the car? That makes no sense,” John continued.
“Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson cooed. “I’ve finally met your young man and now I’m even more upset with you for having kept him hidden away for so long!”
“Oh, yes, of course. I’ll just, em, go have a chat with John, then.” She glances at Lestra as if to say something, shuffles on her feet a bit, then looks back to Sherlock. He bends to remove some nonexistent fluff from his leg, and sees their shadows bump together in a quick kiss before she moves away. When he stands straight again Lestra is watching her go.
John gapes at him, confusion clouding his eyes. “What? If you’d… If you'd never been… Why would you think of such a horrible thing?”
“I don’t mind. I’ll take you any which way.” John threw his leg over Sherlock’s, and pressed his face into the space between shoulder and chin. “You’re warm. You smell good to me. Maybe I should get you a little dirtier, you know, really make that shower worth it.”
“You need to come?” John whispered, moving to sit next to Sherlock on the bed, leaning onto one hip and propping himself up with one arm. He cupped Sherlock’s face with one hand and leaned down to suck on his earlobe.
“She’ll be along shortly, young ones, do not fear. She is presently attending to a different matter, but should be done momentarily.”
represents peace for the whole. And that’s what we need, if we are to love who we want to love, and not be condemned for it. So I’m going to find it, and bring it back.”
Sherlock sighed and tugged his scarf closer around his neck, looked up and down the street, and nodded toward the stoplight. “C’mon. Let’s go get a drink and I’ll fill you in.”
He had also packed a pair of charcoal grey dress pants that hugged him just so, sat low on his narrow waist, and flared slightly at the bottom, breaking perfectly over well-shined black leather Chelsea boots.
John leaned forward and plucked the laminated card from Sherlock’s hands, then handed it to her. “Sorry,” he said. “He’ll be more responsive after he eats.” He winked at Sherlock and Sherlock’s shoulders released some of their tension.
He pivoted on his heel and saw barista-John jogging up to him, his long black barista apron flapping against what appeared to be extremely sturdy thighs.
They sat in silence for a moment, one reflecting on the insufferable arrogance of America’s most highly esteemed architect, the other with an unreadable expression on his face. Sherlock didn’t like unreadable expressions.
John, with his messy bedhead and his sheet-lined cheeks and his furnace-warm body. John was not calling to tell him about his new boyfriend. John was not breaking up with him. John was here, and Sherlock was here, and they were together. Very much together.
“Mycroft, there won’t be a council meeting until the hatchlings are old enough to attend, and that won’t be until after they actually hatch, and that won’t be until after they’ve incubated for two moons, and that won’t be until they’ve been laid, which doesn’t happen until after they’ve been conceived, which is some time after courting takes place!”
He showered for a small eternity, spent extra time on his hair, and found the suit and purple shirt. He spent the afternoon letting Mrs Hudson fuss over him while she pretended she wasn’t dusting and cleaning and he pretended he was listening to her as he flipped through a box of cold case files that Detective Inspector Lestrade had dropped off the last time he visited 221b.
The hostess seated John in a large, orange leather booth facing the bar, set a stack of menus down, and walked back to the front. Sherlock passed her on his way to their table. John raised an eyebrow as Sherlock scooted all the way over to sit thigh-to-thigh with him against the far wall.
“Sherlock. Trust me. If you can’t believe in yourself right now, believe in me. Just believe in me, okay?”
Sherlock spins endless scenarios for their reunion, each one more alluring than the one before. Every once in a while he acknowledges that he will have to introduce Anahera and Tui, and deliver the heartstone to the Council, and debrief with his father, and tell his mother that Mycroft is well, and – and – and, but all of that is boring. The only thing that is not boring is seeing his Johnling again. Beautiful Johnling.
, whatever is within my power to give, they will have. Rest now. There will be much work to do when the others return.”
“John, listen. Those were the best of times, but so are these the best of times. It's you and me, still, and our family, with years ahead of us to enjoy each other and eat ice cream for lunch and look back on the past from where we are now. It's a good vantage point, you must admit.”
Penguins really do release bubbles from the tiny filaments of their feathers to reduce drag and increase speed. You can read about it
Sherlock dressed while John showered, then slipped downstairs to see what awaited him. He crept into the kitchen, not wanting to give James a heads up that he was coming, but what greeted him was more a scene of quiet domesticity than creeping ex’s and assassin’s death threats. James was seated at the kitchen table, a cup and empty plate to his left, his phone in his right hand. Annette was standing across from him, scrubbing a stack of copper pans that she’d taken down from the overhead rack.
“Little help here?” Annette said, grunting as she pressed the struggling woman’s squirming shoulders against the floor.
John shrugged. “I don’t mind going to hang out with friends, but I don’t have any burning desire to frequent them regularly. Our time together is short. I don’t want to waste it.”
"All right then. Do you remember the part about Kororā’s brother, Ika? Well, Ika bid one of his sea creatures to go find Apo and the heartstone in hopes of helping his sister and her family. That sea creature was a mighty seal named Pōrangi, bigger and fiercer than any seal that had ever existed before or has ever existed since. Ika took half of all his godly power, and he put it into one of Pōrangi’s teeth. Then, he sent her off to see what she could find.
“I have no doubt, Sherlock, neither in my mind, nor my heart. The moment I met Selvic, I knew it was forever. I just knew. But I can’t put myself in other pengs’ heads, and know what it feels like for them, or why you feel differently now that you’re bonded with John.”
“Yes, Sherlock, I see that.” She laughs and taps him affectionately on the shoulders before lowering her wings. “Your father told me everything about your arrival yesterday, but warned me not to wait up for you.” She winks in John’s direction, and Sherlock pretends he has no idea what she is talking about.
Sometimes I sit down to write, knowing what I'm supposed to write, or what I planned to write, and then something else, something entirely different, comes out. All I knew when I started this chapter is that these two pengs were going to this particular place. I didn't know what they'd talk about on the way. They knew.
Sherlock squeezed John’s hand, leaned in, and whispered, “I would’ve told her that she doesn’t have the necessary equipment to engage your interests. Then, I would’ve grabbed my crotch and given her a meaningful look.”
“I texted James the name. He’ll know what it means.” Sherlock’s fist sent a ripple through the water as he tugged their foreskins up and down.
John watched as Sherlock squeezed some of the clear gel into his palm, watched as he coated John’s cock with it, watched as Sherlock reached behind himself, as his arm tensed, as his eyes fell shut, as his mouth fell open.
Sherlock was either going to come or hyperventilate. Maybe both. He dragged two lungfuls of air in through his nose, and tried to hold onto it for more than three seconds.
John stopped talking. He licked his lips, took a long drink of water, and swallowed. He hadn’t taken his eyes off Sherlock’s neck for several seconds, and Sherlock distractedly stroked his fingers over the tendon that ran from under his ear to his collarbone, then traced his fingers into the notch at the center.
“How do you feel about bathing together?” he asked when John came back to the car with a grocery bag and a wine carrier.
“You’ve been teasing me, driving me nuts, all day long. Now it’s my turn. The second we’re alone, the second that door shuts behind us, you are mine. I’m going to take you apart, John Watson, piece by piece, breath by breath, until you are begging me, until you are crying for it, do you understand? You’re going to be so fucking hard, John Watson, you won’t be able to see, won’t be able to talk. All you’ll know is my mouth on you, my fingers in you, my tongue, teasing you, holding you, until there is nothing left in the world but you, me, my dick, and your ass. Are we clear?”
“I didn’t give him any financial information, but I did tell him that you come into your trust next year and that Mycroft wants you to think about what you’d like to do with the place when Mrs. Hudson can no longer manage it. I told him that Mycroft doesn’t want his share and that you won’t need to keep it for the income.”
That he was able to do that while being as guarded and private as he always was remains a mystery to Sherlock. John says that one need not mimic a chattering therapist to care for and cherish someone, and Sherlock thinks that what John means is that you can love someone deeply without making a huge dramatic fuss about it. He thinks that John's quiet act of loving Sherlock is what saved them both when they both needed saving.
John peered over Sherlock’s shoulder again. “They’re sitting very close to each other, and looking at something on Kevin’s phone. Greg just pointed at the screen and asked a question. They’re looking at each other. Their faces are about four inches apart.”
“Hey,” John said as Sherlock wrapped his arms around him from behind. “You never went back to sleep, did you?”
John nodded and started rubbing his thumb over Sherlock's nipple. “Remember in gym? You'd always hit the showers before me.”
"John." Sherlock turns to press his belly against John’s wing. He runs his bill down John’s neck and slides it over his shoulder. "I have to leave in a few days. I’ve missed you."
On the ground, Mary sighed. “Had it been you or him,” she said, nudging her chin toward John, “I’d have copped on. This one, though? She wasn’t worth noticing.”
And suddenly, Sherlock understood what John was trying to say, that the way John held himself, the way he moved through time and space was indicative of who John was, that although his physical body wasn’t something he’d had a say in creating, the way he lived through that body was very much a conscious choice. Sherlock loved John’s body because of who John was inside that body. He looked down at what he could see of himself in the tub, at his nipples and his knees, and he decided that self-acceptance was also a powerful aphrodisiac.
This chapter isn't beta'd, and I have a feeling you'll find typos and whatnot. Point them out, and when I'm over my jetlag, I'll fix them.
Erebus stands again, breathless with his exertion. “I am more well than I have been in a long time, dearest Sherlock. The last eggs will be arriving, and you will leave soon, with the others. Remember what you have learned, my friend, and it will serve you well.”
Sherlock shuddered and put his glass down with a thud. “But I don’t want to pick up anyone! Why would we do that?”
Sherlock cannot imagine what it has taken from Erebus to share such an intimate memory with him. Having heard it, Sherlock feels both drained, and exhilarated.
Hello pengs! I'm on vacation, and I've been writing this in fits and starts whenever I can. I wish I'd had a longer period of time to focus on this chapter for more than thirty minutes at a time, because it's an important one, and very different than the 56 that have come before it. Hope you like it.
“Shh,” Sherlock whispered. “Easy. Tell me if this will work.” He lifted John’s hand from where it rested on Sherlock’s hip, brought it to his mouth, and slipped John’s first two fingers inside to the knuckle. Mouth still open, he rolled his tongue over the pads of John’s fingers, flicked at them, licked them.
“I haven’t been to the Keys, but I’ve heard spring break on Key West is basically just a giant orgy.
Sherlock closed his eyes and exhaled, loudly. “Must I be the subject of your tedious, mundane conversation about my sleep habits? How's Daddy?”
Sherlock’s pout was exaggerated by the flush of champagne in his blood. He’d never handled alcohol very well, but John loved the way Sherlock became more fluid, the way he would lean into John’s personal space, and stay there, when he’d had a few drinks. He would murmur deductions into John’s hair, and brush specks of lint off his shoulder and lower back.
Half an hour later he was too distracted by his own arousal to continue reading. There was a whole world of sexual pleasure out there he’d never stopped to consider. He put the phone back on the nightstand, turned out the light, and tried to think about assassins and death threats instead of some of the sexual activities he’d just read about. It was futile. He was mentally cataloguing a list of acts he wanted to try in order of priority when he finally drifted off to sleep.
John let go of Sherlock’s cock and pulled back enough to look him in the face. “What’s wrong? What is it?”
“Yes. With paint on him. I figured it couldn’t hurt to call the police, then I waited outside his apartment until they came. Turns out, the broadside was from the Kress Collection, and they didn’t even know they’d been broken into. He’d taken books, prints, and broadsheets, all of them French, worth several hundred thousand dollars.”
The others begin to arrive later that day, as Sherlock said they would. Those who have not left eggs behind make the rounds, greeting family and friends and checking on the status of others’ eggs. John and Sherlock receive their visitors as graciously as they can, but Sherlock is never far from asking everyone to leave so that he and John can have these last moments to themselves.
The back of the truck was filled with snow, so John pushed his duffel bag between them on the front seat, started the ignition, and put the truck in gear. As soon as they were moving along in third, he reached over his bag and grabbed Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock squeezed back, and looked out his window.
John ran his hands up under Sherlock's T-shirt, the pads of his fingers rubbing lines and circles over his back.
“What things did you like?” John started on his own jeans, then pulled off his socks and stood in front of Sherlock mostly naked and hard with his hands on his hips. Oh, Sherlock liked that, he liked that quite a lot.
“I assume you’ve been employing short hedges to lock in the price of corn at the time of sale. Based on the price of the corn at that time, you either make a profit or incur a loss.”
He felt John’s shoulders nudging the insides of his spread legs, felt a warm breath gust over his belly, felt time come to a standstill as he waited for the rest of his life to become defined as
Sherlock reaches over the side of the bed and tugs the other side of the duvet up and over them. John pulls him back and wraps him up in his arms, holds him like a treasure, and Sherlock knows he is loved.
"Traditionally, to seek, to search. But, also, in more modern times, lunacy, madness," Sherlock explains.
Sherlock wonders if she’s referring to the same social revolution that Nikau mentioned, but his thought is fleeting. He cannot help but stare at her.
“Yeah, I did. It was something like, ‘X equals one wall plus a naked Sherlock multiplied by my dick. Solve for X.’ I just solved it.”
His heart speeds up in that moment just before he acts, and the dream changes. He and John are alone. There are no eggs. They stand on the Pobedan ice, their backs to the sea, and they observe the colony swell and swirl around them.
"No, but we can glide!" Sherlock quips, pushing John onto the sloping path at their side. John squawks in surprise, then reaches out a wing and knocks Sherlock's feet out from under him. They tumble back down the incline, rolling and skidding and sliding for the exact amount of time it takes Sherlock to fall desperately in love, which is not very long at all, considering the height from which they started.
Sherlock is heady with the relief of John's enthusiasm. He rummages around in the cupboards for two flutes, then twists the metal ring off the top of the bottle and pops the cork. He pours slowly, letting the foam rest before pouring again. He tucks the bottle under his arm and picks up the two flutes, eager to join John in the bedroom.
They clung to each other, tight, not the casual lying together of postcoital satisfaction, but the clutching of overwhelming emotional awareness, everything raw and fragile and exposed, laid bare by those three unspoken words.
As he approached the edge, hovering on the brink before being flung out over the abyss, he experienced a profound gratefulness for John, for all he saw in Sherlock, for how long he’d loved him, for how much he gave. When he couldn’t hold on one second more, when John tipped him over and out of control, his mind went blank, everything wiped clean but for one thought.
“I've lost three followers overnight.” John turned his laptop to face Sherlock and started laughing. “Look at what that means.”
Soft wings are running down the length of his, again and again. Something touches and clacks under his bill, and prods his head up. His heart makes so much noise. Maybe that’s the problem. Maybe he needs to turn off that noise, so that he can focus on opening his eyes, instead. He’ll just turn it off. He’s not sure how, but surely that’s the answer.
He popped a bit of scone in his mouth and tugged his bedsheet tighter around his waist, then settled into his favourite chair and turned on the television. Any hopes he’d had that common sense would prevail flew right out the two tall windows overlooking Baker Street. The Cabinet had met and heard from the Arranged Marriage Programme Committee. They had already voted, and arranged marriage was now a requirement in England. Further news would be forthcoming about who this affected, and when, and how, but for now it appeared that those who did not choose a spouse through the Programme would have one chosen for them through some sort of algorithm that matched candidates by class, race, income, and other demographic variables. There would be countless hours of commentary by pundits both for and against the legislation. No doubt there would be protests and parties, celebrations and calls for action.
“Did you know about this?” John whispers. He need only look at Sherlock’s gobsmacked face to know the answer.
"Would you think differently of yourself if you had a red mark on your chest, the way it is said Aumārire did?"
John wriggles under Sherlock’s back to help him stand, and when they’re both relatively composed Sherlock calls back, “No, brother mine, I’ve nothing to share, and no questions to ask. Do carry on.”
Bottom line: getting a university education in the United States is expensive. Please, those of you in other countries, refrain from expressing your disgust/disbelief and from writing heartfelt essays about how glad you are to live in a place where university education is free, or costs next to nothing. We've heard it all before, believe me.
Sherlock squints up at the ceiling, pondering the possibilities, then pronounces that bananas foster would be the very best thing.
Sherlock lifted his hips a few inches off the bed, unabashedly exposing himself, vulnerable, wanton. He felt the mattress shift as John lowered himself down again, then heard him say, “Hold yourself open for me, Sherlock.”
“I’ll try the pepperoni.” Sherlock ate his pizza, trying to figure out what he should say, what he should talk about. In the amount of time it took him to come up with exactly no ideas, John finished his first slice and reached for a second.
“Forgive me if this is too personal,” Sherlock said, taking great interest in the crease of his trousers, “but do you think you’re ready now? To date?”
“It’s not a riddle, Ma. I’m in love with Sherlock, and he’s in love with me, and that’s why I’m never going to date Sarah Sawyer, or anyone else you try to set me up with.”
“My goodness, yes. You have set truly wonderful dynamics in motion, my son. It is history in the making, and I feel very fortunate to watch it unfold. Selvic would be as proud of you as I am, you know.”
“You both need to know that I am highly suspicious of the story Lestrade gave me this morning, but I’m not going to ask for proof of anything he’s said so far.
Sherlock nodded as he manoeuvred the car into traffic. “Very much so. I’m looking forward to seeing Annette again, and the changes she’s made to the place.”
Sherlock jerked his head up and met Mycroft’s eye. He was sure he wasn’t imagining the hope in his brother’s expression, and yet Sherlock felt caught off guard. He might as well have found himself at a fork in a road he had always believed to be going one way and one way only. To choose a new direction now, without considering his options, seemed foolhardy. On the other hand, what options did he have but to take Mycroft at his word? Mycroft absolved him of any of the blame he had carried for the last ten years. But was that relevant? Could he absolve himself?
Sherlock sank back against the cushions and pressed himself up against John, tucking his legs up to the side, his knees on John’s warm, solid thigh. John ran his fingers up into the curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck, combing through them, gently tugging and twirling them. Sherlock sipped his champagne and wondered if it was possible for a human to start purring. John’s fingers dipped under the collar of his shirt, his nails tracing patterns over smooth skin.
“So good, so good, so good –” Sherlock's heart pounded against the hotel sheets, and his eyes squeezed shut, and his mouth fell open.
“And your cock is dripping all over the seat, and you're thrusting back, trying to get my tongue where you want it.”
“Hold on, I’ll get it,” he called. He opened the door as John was fumbling his keys back into his coat pocket.
“No, I don’t want to stop.” John sat up straighter and held out his hands, and Sherlock took them in his own and wove their fingers together. Palms pressed flat, Sherlock bore John's weight as he tilted forward, spread his knees on either side of Sherlock, and pushed down.
Thanksgiving passed in a haze of gold and yellow light, sterling silver clinking against bone china, voices rising and falling in conversation and laughter. Platters and bowls were passed, hand to hand, and plates were filled with the comfort of tradition. Chestnut and sausage and celery stuffing, mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans with pearl onions and tarragon. Cranberries, apple, and orange zest, cooked together with sugar and cinnamon and cloves, and served only this one day each year, and orange pecan biscuits, dusted with melted butter and cinnamon sugar. A fifteen pound turkey, roasted for three hours and basted in its own juices, holding court at the center of the table, and corn, and sweet potatoes laced with Jack Daniels and topped with maple syrup.
and I whisper in your seashell of an ear an instruction to rut and thrust and grind upon my thigh as I negotiate our purchase
“Don’t ask me that, Sherlock. I’d never stop,” he said between kisses, “not until I had you saying a hell of a lot more than ‘oh.’”
Sherlock touches his bill to the centre of the wrapped stone, and then straightens up tall and gives Lestra a short nod. Lestra doesn’t say a word. Sherlock holds Lestra’s gaze and wishes he knew how to impart even one snowflake of the storm of thoughts swirling in his head. But, maybe he does know how, because Lestra holds Sherlock’s gaze and opens his bill as if to speak, then closes it again. Instead of using words, Lestra bows to Sherlock. Sherlock bows back.
"I didn't. Then you showed up, flashing thigh and calf all over the front room, like some kind of blogging harlot, and that was the end of that."
Anahera grins at him from where she holds up her end of the seaweed, and calls over, "I'm partial to 'scenario fifty-two,' myself, if you can manage to glide that far without crashing."
“What about Harry?” John’s hand slipped down to Sherlock’s inner thigh, a few inches from where Sherlock’s penis lay, soft, but awake.
In front of them, where the outdoor tables to the restaurant would be during the summer, was an enormous outdoor ice skating rink. Taking up at least half a city block, the rink sat directly in front of and slightly below the Bean. Across the street was Chicago’s skyline, stretching to the south and north on either side of them.
Mycroft's closet was mostly empty, save for a few winter coats he'd left behind, and a stack of yearbooks and debate club trophies he'd put in an old cardboard box and shoved in a corner. There was nothing in his nightstand drawer, but his desk was still crammed full of mechanical pencils, chewed up erasers, bookmarks, cracked plastic rulers, dried out markers, and a couple of combination locks that were locked shut on nothing at all.
“And, if we are kind, generous, and community-minded, as we are taught, wouldn't we continue to share our resources, and care for others, anyway?"
It escaped him. He rubbed a hand over his face and through his hair, grown too long after a semester of ignoring it, and rolled over onto his back. He tried to guess the time without looking at the clock. He calculated when he’d got into bed, how long he’d read, and when he most likely turned out the light. He noted the position of the moon through his window, the curtains left open for moments like this.
"If I understand correctly, Sherlock, your requests are trifold. You wish safekeeping of the tooth, so that it does not fall into the wrong wings, and continued study of its validity and value to our kind. I can assuredly grant you this.
“I need to get it ready for me. I need to prepare you, Sherlock, and get you ready for when I put my fat cock up inside you.”
A reminder that emperor pengs reach sexual maturity at about one year of age, but don't reproduce until they're at least three, and often older. I'm interpreting this to mean, in the case of Sherlock and John, that their bodies are adult now, but not capable of everything yet.
“Seriously, love. It’s sexy as hell on you but you naked and hard for me is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
“No, you’re not, at least not in the way that most people would describe someone as being sweet. But you are very … something special. Unique. At least, you are to me.”
Sherlock pivots on his toes, hands flexed out to the sides. He hears John let out a long breath and something that sounds an awful lot like a moan, and then he pirouettes back to face John, who steps forward and cups his jaw with one hand and kisses him, soft and lingering.
He stopped at the top of the landing and peered into his bedroom. His old bedroom? Was it still his bedroom? Mrs. Hudson had assured him it always would be his, but the new bedroom made more sense for his current sleeping arrangement. His old room was just as he’d left it, bare of clutter and those things he’d outgrown, either in size or purpose. The bed was made, and the candles he’d lit for his first time with John were gathered in a cluster on his desk. He could feel the heat of them on his face now, warm with the memories of that incredible night.
All eyes were on them as they wove between the tables and made their exit, all but those of one Dr. Stephan Laffitte.
,” before going shock still. Frozen, he began to spurt long and hard through the circle of Sherlock’s fist.
A short while later they'd picked out two delicious-looking sirloin steaks, ingredients for jacket potatoes, a couple handfuls of green beans, and a ruby-red cabernet sauvignon. Neither had wasted a second thought on whether or not they needed dessert. They didn’t.
“Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock, yes.” John was picking up momentum, and the force of it was driving Sherlock farther and farther into John. The friction was delicious, the grip of John around him building a steady, delirious pressure through his genitals and thighs and abdomen.
"The six-inch Louboutins, I think," she mused, and he nodded, lifting the hem of the dress away from his ankles, slipping long, slender feet into the patent leather heels. He swiveled on one toe and pulled the dress up further, looking at her over his shoulder.
“I wish I could have had your sight, Sherlock, to see and understand so much. Perhaps I could have done more when emperors so needed it.”
“Thank you, both of you,” John says as he pulls Sherlock away by the wing. Sherlock takes one last look over his shoulder at their two mini-pengs, and presses a kiss to the side of John’s neck as they walk away.
John followed in his wake, the manic energy radiating off Sherlock electric and invigorating. It was affecting John, making his own heart speed up in sympathy, adrenaline pumping through him in a buzzing current. Sherlock seemed like he was in his element, dissecting the room for details John couldn’t fathom, just like he’d done earlier, taking himself and Molly apart. He was dressed in tight jeans and a grey shirt, unbuttoned at the throat, with a charcoal-grey tweed blazer pulled on to ward against the chill. He wore a pair of smart leather boots and smelled deliciously posh. He was obviously public school with his cultured, dulcet tones, Harrow to John’s Cobbe Hill Secondary. And yet here he was, flirting John up, helping John’s friend, and telling John that he didn’t mind it when John touched him. That’s what was happening, right? John wasn’t going mad? No, definitely not.
Another moon has passed, and the colony is preparing to leave Pobeda for the summer months of feeding. Most will return to Cassiopeia, and her waters teeming with shrimp, squid, and silverfish. Not all of them, however, will head west. A small band of pengs will swim east, to the Shelf, and the High Council.
Sherlock’s mouth tilted into a smirk. “I bet Mycroft just loves knowing that his newest operative calls her workspace a hut.”
“It’s looking quite well, don’t you agree, Maryle? He really has been most fortunate. Not all wounds of that nature heal as nicely. Cetus must be quite pleased.
Eventually, Mummy caught on and started to schedule appointments without telling Sherlock. Then, she would wait for the candidate outside the front door of the manor and when the unlucky fool arrived, Sherlock would be called down for some errand or another. She fooled him twice that way, but there was nothing she could do about his boorish behaviour, and after that Sherlock simply stopped showing up when she rang for him.
“Mm,” John croons into the soft curls pressed against his cheek. “You must be ready to burst by now, so hard for me.”
In all that was yet to come, he would keep his eye on John and let the rest fall away. Mummy would march him up the aisle and insist on several hundred photographs before serving a seven-course meal, but as far as he was concerned, this was about him and John, and only him and John.
“A drink! Yes. Excellent. I’m pretty sure my parents left some Scotch or something around. Let me look.” Sherlock fled to the kitchen and rummaged through the cupboards until he found something that looked drinkable. He fetched ice and two tumblers as well, and then set it all on a tray and carried it back to the front room where he set it down on the coffee table.
