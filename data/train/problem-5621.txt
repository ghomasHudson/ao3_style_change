The Commander glanced at him before looking back at Toni. "Do I need to knock you out or do you promise not to scream, Ms. Robot?" she asked.
When Savin was final upright, there was a large, bright (No, really bright) smile on his face, and he didn't look unhappy in the least. He looked glad that Harley blasted him and got away, which was strange. What was his end game? "You're so much trouble, Doll Face." he said.
Like the sick mind that he was, Zola adds, "Accidents happened." The computer screen flashed to new sets of images; however, there was a single picture that caught Steve's attention.
Shaking his head, Barnes smiled. "I thought that there was no need to forgive me as you didn't care about me."
Laughing, she asked, "Is it working?" She pushed off slightly, unable to push away completely as he had wrapped his arms around her.
Toni let out a heavy sigh. Leave it to Steve to explain what happened, leaving out the juicy parts. That man was so much more than that. He was a deadly assassin, who was- for lack of a better word- missing a few screws in his head, though he could still kill you from a mile away. Yes, that metal arm was impressive, and she just wanted to explore every inch of it if she ever got her hands on it. "If I didn't know any better, I would say he was Super Soldier strong. He tossed the Iron Man suit like it was nothing." The idea still pissed her off. Eye twitching, she could remember how it felt when he tossed into a wall. It didn't feel good.
There's a reason why Tony Stark is hidden away in his lab, and it isn't because there's a former brainwashed, ex- assassin upstairs, though he's okay with everyone thinking that. He's okay with everyone thinking that he hates James Barnes, though that's furthest thing from the truth. He doesn't hate the man, though he did at first. Then again, he hates everyone the first time he meets them. It was the same with Rogers, though that's no longer the case. Everything is different than when he first met the members of the Avengers, though he denies it to everyone around him.
With her stomach growling in her ear, Toni ordered a meal fit for two, which had Steve guessing her second guessing her sanity. He gave her once over. Granted, she could say that she was guessing his sanity, as he ordered less than her. When she teased him—asking him if that was enough, he responded saying that he would just eat hers. "OH, hells no, Rogers. That's how fingers get eaten." She countered, putting away from him.
Did he just call her Lady Toni? Not only was Thor the only person who was allowed to call her that, she hated to be called Lady anything. Sure, she was a woman, but she was not a lady in any fashion. She was too ill-behaved and loud. "Why do you care?" she asked. She was unsure of what her dream was about or what it meant. Why would she dream about being pregnant?
She tried to pull away but she couldn't break away from his grab. "Let me go," she ordered.
"N…N," Toni said, trying to speak; however, she couldn't get anything out as her mind started to jumble. She tried to wake her mind by doing something, but she couldn't even move. Everything she was feeling started to disappear and it was only a few seconds later that Toni felt herself drift off into darkness.
*O*O*
Toni wanted to laugh because she knew the future. She knew the outcome, but she couldn't bring herself to laugh as she noticed the murderous look in his eyes. He meant it. "I like it when you talk dirty," she said, drilling into his eyes. Madame Hydra had been correct that Toni used her words to hide, but she wouldn't admit that to anyone. She could barely admit that to herself.
"I thought Hydra was keeping a low profile," the Senator replied, as he tried to control the shaking in his hands.
"You have a dirty mind on you, Mr. Barnes."
"Like a weekend getaway?" Toni said smiling. She knew how to get on CEO's good side, well some times. Right now, Pepper was stressed and needed time off, which was why Toni wanted to give her a vacation. When Pepper didn't respond, she added. "A week?" Still, no answer. "…A month?"
Toni looked at him. "Good, question. I don't know but this present me is," she laughed.
Why did all the bad guys get all the awesome abilities? She would kill to have that power… Maybe, not kill but you get the idea. However, she could add something like that to the Iron Man suit, and it was totally possible. There wasn't anything that she couldn't do. Even if with the world exploding around her, a smile appeared on her face just thinking about it. She looked devilish as Steve got to his feet and turned to her. With her genius mind spinning, she totally forgot that she was mad at the man for daring to show his pretty face.
Tony's insecurities are a curse, filling his head with doubt, and he doesn't know if he should believe them. "You left me alone," he says softly, almost too soft to hear. "You two would rather sleep together than with me." He knows his pain is visible in his face.
All that Toni could recall was pure and complete darkness, and for a while, she thought she was dead. She thought the Arch reactor had stopped and she had gone to hell. She expected nothing else, as she was the reason why so many people were suffering. She deserved this punishment. She deserved to suffer for the pain that she had caused.
Not caring if Rhodes was still on the line or not, Steve took off the headset, handed it to Natasha, and gave Rumlow a harsh look. He did trust the man, unlike Toni, but he had to admit that there was something off about the man. "Just drop me off. You don't need me for the debrief," he replied.
There was something in his tone. "We can fix that," he replied as he spun her to look into her eyes. Placing a gentle hand on her chin, he tilted her face up and claimed her lips with his. He pulled her tight against him as he sucked on her bottom lip. Toni could feel a groan form her in throat as his worked hands up and under her shirt, caressing her back.
Colonel Phillips wasn't a fan of war, but there were parts that he enjoyed more than others. What he was working on was not one of them. He was writing letters to the loves one of the soldiers who were MIA or killed, and it was a draining experience to say the least. Though he knew they couldn't win them all, it cut at him to write these letters. These men were someone's sons. How could he tell someone that their son was dead? What could he possibly say to make it better? There was nothing. Nothing at all. To him, they were an insult…but they had to be done.
"She hadn't stir."
Annoyed and frustrated, Toni pulled from Steve, but she kept a good grip on him. "What?" she asked, her lips swore. Again, where did Roger learn how to kiss? She needed to thank that woman, unless it was Peggy. If so, it would be weird. Really weird.
Natasha gives him a hard look, as she places a warm hand on his arm. "You can't expect Steve and Barnes to react differently. You did break up with them."
Toni took a deep breath as she went to meet up with Rogers and the gang. She was all geared out in army gear with her military belt heavy with two canteen, binoculars, and a small first aid kit. In a small bag that she had draped across her body, she had a compass, a Swiss army knife, and a pocket watch. On her back was a small bag, which held a few items that Howard had given her. Unlike regular soldiers, she did not have a rifle, not that she would know how to handle it. Instead, she had a hunting knife hidden in her boots and two hand guns in two leg holsters.
Bucky eyed his roommate as he knew something was up. "Is that it? Or did you try and enlist again?" He stood up annoyed. "Why do you keep doing that?" he asked, trying to keep his voice down as not to wake the girl. "You're just going to hurt yourself."
"Are you okay, Stark?"
"Look, I'm sorry about that little show back there… but we thought it best to break it to you slowly," said the man with the eye patch.
"Are you okay?" She asked, annoyed. Her arms strung from the cuts, but they wasn't as painful as the bruise on her face.
Toni squeezed her eyes closed, forcing herself to take few deep breaths, as her heart was off to the races, threating to pop out of her chest. In her head, she yelled at herself that this wasn't real, repeating it every few seconds when he didn't disappear. This wasn't real. Barnes wasn't real. He was dead, and no matter the tech invented, the man wasn't going to come back to life. He was
"Rogers, relax." Barton stated as he eyed the stilled Captain.
to answer. She wanted to be open with him, but she didn't want to open herself up at the same time, considering it would end up in pain. She knew she sounded like an idiot, not knowing what she wanted or what she didn't want. However, she knew she had to or else she would go crazy. "Are you ticklish?"
"Stark," Natasha answered, her eyes glued to Steve. Worried stretched across her face as she took in the super soldier. "We haven't been able to find her."
As for Toni's age, I am making her younger than MCU Tony. I believe i mentioned this before, but I will state it before. No, she isn't some 20 year old, but she isn't as old as RDJ. In my story, i am making her around 35.
"What?"
"Not yet." Schmidt dragged her toward Zola, who was checking out one of the glowing cores, which Toni eyed. That was all that she needed.
"I don't know about the Capsicle part, but I would love to get back to my own king size bed," she said, kicking her feet over the side. "And a nice large steak with a glass of whiskey."
"I can handle Nat. She-" Romanoff glared. "-Okay, she'll totally kick my ass." Clint admitted, looking away. "Geez, you guys are no fun."
"Why don't you stop this and get me out of here." Toni snapped. "You owe me…after everything."
A rush of anger boiled up in Steve at the thought of Hydra used his best friend's face to destroy Toni. Bucky would be rolling in his grave if he knew… his ice grave. Shit, he thought, as cruel, bloody images pop into his head. God, he couldn't handle this. He really wished Bucky was here. God, he just wanted Bucky to be alive and together be with Toni in the Tower. That idea didn't last long, the nightmare of the situation destroying it. There was this terrible, panic feeling in the pit of his stomach. When they got Tony back—not if, when-, would she be the same woman that he fell in love with? Would she be okay?
"Oh, God, get a room!" Clint cried as he dropped a box of whatever he was carrying. The Box clanged as it hit the floor, shattering whatever was inside. It sounded like a box full of glass.
"I am not-"
"Colonel," Peggy greeted, interrupting. She took a seat across from Salty and Toni. Her glare had changed to a smug look.
"Sark? Yea, my cover."
Making her way toward the kitchen, she could smell the food, which made her stomach growl more. She knew the smell of Pepper's food, having eaten it for years. Sure, Toni could cook as she had to fend for herself since she was a small child, but Pepper was always the better cook. She didn't know what Pepper did to her food, but she could morph it in something, something more than food. Toni smiled as the door to kitchen came into sight.
Howard laughed as he straightened himself up. "If I'm wrong, you'll think I'm crazy," he said, with a smile.
"What about us?" Rogers asked.
Natasha narrowed her eyes as she stared at the screen. There was something spinning in the Assassin's head, as she listened to the news. "Some City Senator this time."
"Well, how could they live without me?" she said with a wink. "I'm brilliant."
Hola, Yes, I know. I had been awhile, but I couldn't get the pen to paper. It was a struggle and I am sorry for that. I hope I can do better for the next chapter. I just didn't know how much time had passed.
Not giving him a chance, Toni leaned toward him, grabbing onto his arm—not that there was any away he could escape from her unless he jumped through the glass. They were in the corner of the diner. "I'm stuck to you like glue."
If she didn't find that completely sexy, it would be totally annoying. She shook her head as she tried to clear her mind of the dirty images that flooded it. There were so many things that she could do to that man, and she wasn't sure if half of them were legal. "So why did you bring me back?" she asked, changing the subject. She didn't want to answer his question.
"It's one thing to be introduced to her, but you can't just walk up to her. Steve, you can't. You have to wait until she comes back from the past and you can't tell anyone. I need you to promise me this." He took a deep breath. "I know it'll be hard for you, knowing how much you care for her, but you can't. If your paths meet, then so be it, but you can't go to her. Promise me this."
"So what are we watching this week?" Sam asks, breaking the deadly silence. He's standing next to Clint, making no movement to sit, and he's still rubbing his shoulder.
Allowing the door to close behind her, Toni fell hard to the ground, not bracing herself from the fall. Her head banged hard against the wall as everything disappeared around her. She could feel herself struggle to breathe as she couldn't catch her breath. It felt like someone had their hands around throat, choking her, and for a second, she wished that it was true. It would make everything simple. It would solve everything.
"No," he stated. "She won't open up or reveal anything to us."
Toni's head felt like it was on fire, while her lungs felt like there was a brick on her chest. "Urgh," she muttered painfully; her throat felt like sand. Every part of her hurt and she thought she was going to die from the pain. She was familiar with pain as she had experience it before, but this was something different. Something completely different.
His tone pissed her off. They didn't need her on that mission, which Director Fury had confirmed when she requested she didn't go; however, Rogers thought she was being lazy and selfish, thinking only about herself. In order to avoid a fight with him, she had left the room and went straight to her lab, where she had been ever since. Rogers had tried to come down to talk to her, but she had told him to fuck off, which he did.
If he doesn't know any better, he would think that he hears pity in the AI's voice, and that makes it worst. He feels like an idiot and now everyone will know it. "Thanks, FRIDAY," he says sadly.
"It's different then I remember," Toni distantly heard Peggy say. The agent was speaking softly, but her voice drafted through the air as there was nothing to drown out the sound. Phillips said something in reply, but Toni paid no attention as she stared at Peggy.
"He's gone." He looked down at his hands, which were balled. "I couldn't protect him like I couldn't protect you…" He glanced at her before looking back at his hands. "I failed… again. I thought I lost you too."
Toni glared. "Listen, Bucky. I almost got it. You don't need to baby sit me. I'm pretty tough," she said while flexing. "And if you don't, I'll hurt you." She couldn't let anyone get hurt while they were protecting her.
*O*O*
She took a deep breath as she tried to clear her minds of the negative thoughts. This reminded her of one of those scenes in a horror film. The type where the viewer says, 'you're an idiot for going into that dark alley alone.' Shaking her head, she put on a smile as she tried to hide her fear. She exhaled slowly as she walked pass a dumpster, which was only a few feet away from the back of the alley way.
Steve snorted as a huge, Chester cat smile appeared on his face. "Trust me I know," he replied.
With a deep breath, she met his glare with her own, though that was harder to do than she expected. She hated the look he was giving her. With his glare, it was hard to imagine him as her shrimp, a guy that she had spent nights talking to. It was hard to see him like this, as at one point, she played his wingman, a friend, but she had no one to blame to herself.
"What do you mean that wasn't your first time that you hadn't been tortured?" Rogers asked taking a step toward her. His hands were balled, and there was a hint of emotion in his voice that Toni couldn't figure out.
in front of her was Barnes! He didn't look the same, looking like he had just survived a month in the wilds. His uniform was completely worn with holds throughout his jacket, shirt, and pants, revealing his gray skin. His dark hair was longer and ratty, looking like it had been years since it had seen a brush; plus, he was covered in some kind of slug and mud. Nevertheless, it was him. "Y-you're d-dead."
"Well if the shoe fits wear it." The three avengers were glaring at each other.
Toni put on the biggest smile she could muster. "Oh, we can still fight, but now, there'll be make-up sex and angry sex, which are the best kinds of sex there are," she said, as she stared at the Archer.
"Rhodes and Stark out." Rhodes replied, terminating the call with the Vice President.
However, he didn't have time to think about his pain as there was a Strike team hot on his tail, and they looked ready to kill. If they caught him, it would all be over. Whoever this was would win, and the world would be in danger. Everyone and thing that he ever cared for would be in danger. Innocent people could be hurt, and with Toni missing, his mind couldn't help but drift to her. Could these people be after her? Somehow, she wasn't hit by those bullets that killed Fury, and the way that Assassin hovered over her, he wanted her. But why? Besides her being Iron Man.
"Some things never change," Steve sighed, allowing her to put him away.
His eyes flicked. "Toni," he muttered as he opened his eyes. "Are you okay?" He pushed himself up into a hitting position and it was clear by his stiffness that his back hurt. "Toni," he stated as he reached for her. To both of their surprises, she let him put a hand on her shoulder.
Steve let out a playful sigh. "Only if you listen." He replied. "You know we should listen to people, when they tell us things."
"They only wish to show their-"
too, even if his heart doesn't want to. He can't be doubting the decision he made, wondering if it was a mistake…even if he is. Too hasty? Is he just being emotional? Barnes and Rogers do seem to care about him and they're correct that he's riskless. Plus, he has a huge ego, disobeying every order, and he's not the easiest person to get along with…
"Besides, Toni won't like it if you worry yourself to death."
Steve had come to that conclusion on his own, but it was hard for him to grasp that. "I don't –"
Jones chuckled as he stepped toward the end of the bed. "Hey, now," he said, also unsteady on his feet. "I was quite a catch back in the day."
"Miss."
Steve rolled his eyes as he pulled her flat against to him. "For that, I'm going to find something from the 40s. Be like old times." He placed a kiss to her forehead as he held her close, not giving her an inch.
The room started to close in on her as Steve's grip tightened around her. Her panic started to grow as her nightmares replayed in her head. Sweat ran down her body as she yanked her leg away from Bruce, whose eyes widen at the sudden change in her. Before Steve's grip could tighten more, the genius ducked out from his arms. She pushed herself as far as she could from Steve, and before he or anyone else could stop her, she was on her feet, her unsteady feet.
With a pang of pain, a memory flashed before her eyes of Barnes kissing her, telling her that he wanted her. His tone then had been close to Steve's tone now, but there was something desperate in Steve's voice. "What are you saying?"
"A hero, like you? You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle," Toni snapped, getting into Steve's face even if she was a foot or two shorter than he.
"Don't," she warned, softly, as she twisted away from Jim. She shoved away his hand and scooted the chair away from him. All of the sudden, it felt really warm in Pepper's office as everything came rushing back to her. The room felt like it was on fire, and she felt like she was going to die as she struggled to breath. The room felt like it was closing in on her, and she needed to get out. She needed to get away, before she lost it.
Steve glanced toward the clock, wishing she was as well, but knowing Toni, she probably wasn't. Even if he hated himself for it, he kind of hoped she was, so he could see her face. He loved coming back to the tower and having someone waiting for him. He loved the look in her eyes when she saw him. He felt at home. "I hope so," he said, slowly.
Tony looks between the two, and he sees nothing but fondness in their eyes. "No," Tony says, pushing away from them. What's going on? How can this be happening? Why aren't they mad at him? He doesn't understand. "Why are you here?" he asks. "I thought you wanted me to leave you alone for being an indecisive jerk?"
"No!" She protested strongly. She didn't need him to come and get her. She could and would get herself back to the town in one piece, and she didn't need him to come save her. "I got it. Just send the suit."
"You better behave, Stark, or follow us," Natasha ordered, giving her a knowing look, before she sped off. The tires squealed as dust was kicked up into the air.
"So am I!" he said with a smirk, only sparing her a small glance.
Bruce took a deep breath. "On that, I'm not sure. Toni's hard to read."
He chuckled. "I thought you didn't want me to baby you," he said, stepping away from Rogers with Toni in his arms.
Toni felt herself shake as she backed into her father's headstone. Why was he doing this? Why couldn't he just let things be? Did she want him to leave her alone? She wasn't sure, because she wasn't sure if she could handle all of her guilt on her own. "No."
"You joke a lot," he reasoned. There was an annoyance in his voice.
"Not just his," she replied, thinking back to Rogers and Barnes. She couldn't help but feel guilty and self-hatred, but she had to keep up her mask.
She held her arm tighter. "I bet."
Forcing herself to take a few deep breathes, Toni could do nothing but hate herself as guilty took over. She hated this woman, but she didn't want the woman dead. She didn't want any of this but she could do nothing as Maya tumbled down the steps face first. Toni could do nothing as Maya's head hit the ground hard and she stilled. She let out a soft moan, but other than that, Maya was quiet. It was disheartening. "Maya," Toni called, forgetting the pain in her back.
She knew he wanted an answer, but she wasn't able to answer him right now as she wasn't sure what she was feeling. She also wasn't sure if he meant physically or mentally, because she was hurting emotionally, and it was centered on her father. She couldn't handle questions, especially if she had to answer questions about her father. She couldn't believe she had hated him for so long. Why was she so stupid? "Why don't we make sure I don't die first before you ask me question, Brucey?" she said, trying to put on a smile.
The man, who were holding her, slowed down his pace. "Toni," he stated softly.
How could he be making a joke about this? "I wish I had a book," she replied, sadly. "I would've known what to do."
And She didn't need Steve…even if he did protect her from a fire ball. Okay, maybe that was a plus. Because! Hello, fireball. Like what the hell?! A fireball, seriously?!
Toni glanced back at the shadows. "You won't know what hit you."
She thought, listening to them fighting about their 'relationship.' When did they get into a relationship? She kind of felt bad for Peggy, because that was one relationship that wouldn't last.
"Don't worry about," Bruce waved off. He didn't need a pissed off Captain America, because they had other things to worry about. "I'm not an expert in portals. I think we'll need help with this one."
"Are you okay?" Dugan asked. "What got you so scared?" He followed her glance into the tents, trying to figure out what she was looking at that scared her so much.
"You-" The Super Soldier started.
"Miss Stark! Are you okay?"
That startled Bruce. "She connected it to the reactor in her chest?" he asked. He didn't think she would take a stupid risk like that.
Natasha shook her head as she watched the two. "You two are going to make me sick," she replied as she headed toward the gate.
"Or does he still think you a saint? Poor Stevie in bed with a demon."
"I'm sorry," she suddenly said.
Wanting (needed) to do this herself, she had told Rhodey that she didn't want Steve here, and she meant it. She didn't need him, even if she felt like death. After he finished saving the President and she had taken care of all these fire people—she so needed a name for them-, she was going to kick his ass from here to Mexico while she was still in the Iron Man Suit. The place didn't matter as Rhodes went against her wishes and called the Captain. He was her best friend. He wasn't supposed to go against him
*O*O*
"Steve."
Steve smiled at her as he reached down to all of the wet clothes, gathering them. He could see her eyeing his every movement, and he could feel her fear as he stepped to the bathroom. He could tell she didn't want him to leave, which he didn't planned in doing. He wanted to stay, which was what he was going to do. His chest may be beating rapidly in his head, but he wasn't going anywhere.
"You need to rest," he said, using his free hand to keep her down. His voice was trembling.
Toni could almost feel a weight lifted off her chest as she stared at her device. It was an amazing feeling to know that she would be home soon, and she couldn't wait to take a nice long warm shower in her full body wash. She also couldn't wait for some actual food and not this military crap that they were trying to pass as food. However, she had to remind herself that she mustn't get her hopes up. This could still blow up in her face or she would end up somewhere she didn't want to be.
JARVIS turned off the music completely and turned on the speaker, so Toni could speak with them. She wasn't going to let them in, even if she wanted the food Pepper had.
Hello!
(See the end of the chapter for
Peggy slid a bag toward Toni. "You are free to go. Here're your things."
Schmidt turned back to her with a smirk on his face. "She speaks."
At the moment, Toni was sitting at a base of a tree on the edge of the camp. In her hands was a stretch book, which she was using to stretch possible ideas for getting back to her time. She had a few ideas, but she had no idea if any of these ideas would work. All she knew was that she would destroy her stupid device as soon as she got home. She was going to take a few tons of c4 to it.
Sam looked just as alarmed as Natasha did at the sight of a raging Rogers, but he was just as angry. This man worked with vets all the time, helping them with PTSD along other things. "I get it. As someone who wrong with vets, this pisses me off too, but we have to keep our heads."
Clint's hands went to his ears. "I so need to live somewhere else. The images! Where is the bleach?"
"Oh, yes, because I have the Dad Card. That's one of my father's wishes. Are you going to go against one of the last wishes of a dead man? If so, you are a heartless bastard," she teased.
"Toni," Steve muttered, warning softly.
"That might take a while," Bucky stated, as he eyed Steve.
There was a chill in the room and the thin fugly sweater Toni was wearing wasn't keeping her warm. Her hair was standing up on her arms and she had the goose bumps up and down her body. She had tried to adjust the sweater, but she couldn't with a broken arm and the other handcuffed to table. She couldn't move her chair either as it was bolted to the ground, which annoyed her, but it didn't annoy her as much as them, the Colonel and company, their stupid tactics Sure, she was their prisoner, but they couldn't- wouldn't get under her skin. She was tougher than some cold room.
"I think I grew on you enough for that not to happen." Toni wanted to laugh, but she couldn't as it didn't feel right to laugh, not after everything that had happened, but why was it so hard not to?
Toni did want to eat, but she couldn't just take food from them without getting an earful. She stared at the door, wondering if they liked her artwork, which she was very grateful for at the moment. "Tell them I want to be left alone."
She was too tired to be angry with him, but she felt a bit annoyed. "What are you doing here?" she asked, feeling frustrated with herself.
After making it to the control room, Toni took a seat at the control panel and started to touch things in a random pattern, trying to make something happen. There were so many random and weird switches that Toni didn't know what to make of them, and she couldn't figure out any logical behind anything. However, there was one thing about Toni that she couldn't deny: at times, she was the luckiest person on the planet and she was lucky then. She was able to hit the right switch and was able to find a video feed.
"How could you let her come?" he snapped.
End Game may kill me... so you don't hear from me. you can blame that movie.
"Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven't been...fonduing?"
Tony stiffens suddenly, as he recalls their sudden abandonment. So why do they want him now? They didn't want him before. Are they feeling guilty? "And they haven't come rushing in?" he asks, knowing they're the type to do so… though they're here just out of guilt, so that 'protectiveness' is probably gone. No need for them to rush in.
"Well I am an American," she snapped.
Toni's eyes widened before she buried her face in his chest. "Steve," she cried. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean it."
Barnes stepped between them. "You know you two are ridicules," he stated. "You didn't need to fight with each other."
The Asset's hands balled at his side, ready to fight, as the familiar man took the woman into his arms and kissed her. He was to about snap and hunt this man down, as she was
Sharon flipped through the phones on her phone, looking for something. "Even if you had been in love before, it isn't something you can describe. There're poems trying to do just that—girly crap, but nevertheless." She let out a chuckle. "Puky at times. But hey, they aren't wrong. The feeling you get in your chest isn't something you can put words to, no matter how hard you try. Poetic or not. I know what it felt like for me: like I was walking on air. I couldn't get enough. He could just look at me and I smiled." There was a warm smile building on her face. "Butterflies in your stomach. When they hurt, you hurt. You would go to war for them, and just standing by them, you feel at your best. They lift you up without wanting anything in return." The smile took up her entire face, finding the picture she wanted. "Sure, you may fight. You may not agree, but that doesn't mean shit. People fight. It's normal. It's about respect and how you treat that person in those moments."
So here you go. Let me know what you think. Reviews are now.
*O*O*
Seeing Steve pull back the little black box, something inside of Toni broke, and she snatched it, holding it against her chest before he (or even, she) knew what happen. She held it tightly, refusing to let him take it back. His expression turned to confusion, as neither one of them knew what she was doing. She had paused for a moment as she reached up to take off the necklace. She had fumbled with it a bit, taking a few long seconds to unclasp it with one hand. Once she had the long chain off, she took the ring out of the box and slipped it on the chain all without saying a word. Before Steve could move, she clicked it back on and held it tight, blocking it from view.
The genius went silent as she didn't know what to say. She didn't want to answer, but she didn't want to
Leaning her head back, she focused on freeing her hands from the ropes, though it took only a few seconds to realize that she wouldn't be able to break free of her restrains. It didn't mean she wouldn't look for a way out, because there had to be a way. She refused to believe that there was none. If she gave up, she wouldn't be a Stark.
There's something in a voice, a clear sign that he
"I had read my father's will," she replied, coldly. It was the first thing she did, when she had learned of her father's death. It had been callous of her, but she had to learn what had happened to his company. At that age, there was a part of her that wanted nothing to do with it, but there was a different other part of her that wanted to best her father at every turn. "Everything he had was already divided out
"I said really. How are you
"You have also given me bruises, you know. Then, there're the injuries from my tech. Sometimes my inventions get out of hand. Plus, we can't forget about U and Dum-E. I'm lucky they hadn't killed me yet." Toni interrupted again. "Heck, there're times I just walked into things because I'm too busy being awesome."
, there's no way that Rogers and he would work. Again, Rogers would have to like him first, which he does not and will not, and the second something would go wrong (and it will), the super soldier will go running back to the other super soldier. Then, once again, he'll have two angry soldiers coming at him again, ready to kill him, and he cannot take that again. Not again.
Toni exhaled. "So I hear," she muttered. She was a mess, both physically and mentally. She hadn't washed up since getting back to camp, only using wet towels. She couldn't bring herself to take a shower or turn the water on. She couldn't even look at a faucet, without going into a panic attack. However, she told herself that she should be happy as she wasn't thinking of her stalker. If he could get her now, she would award him.
Tony tries to hide himself deeper into Rhodey's chest, as Steve steps away from the glaring Bucky and the pouty Sam. The Super Soldier stops a few feet from Tony before he crouches down to get eye level with the mostly hidden Stark. The Captain is silent for a few seconds as he stares at the balled up genius, only able to make out his eyes. "How are you, Tony?" he asks, his voice shaky.
*O*O*
"And you're the whiny type," she added.
Toni glanced toward Skully and Rogers, wondering what Rogers was going on about. It sounded like he had a plan, though she had no idea of what kind of plan that could be. Getting captured couldn't be it.
"You're injured," Rogers stared as he stepped toward her. "You shouldn't be up."
"Walked in on something you didn't want to see?" Clint asked, laughing.
"Killing…me," Toni said softly and slowly. It was difficult to make out what she said, as she was fighting to stay awake.
Toni shook her head. "Don't need to worry about little old me. Not like I don't already know," she uttered. Both allowed silence to fallen upon them again, and it wasn't until the rain stopped completely that Toni spoke again. "At least, you enjoyed it."
"Then how?" she asked, clearly confused.
Blinking a few more times, Toni, annoyed at herself and live in general, willed her senses back to normal. She would not allow herself to be weak in front of him. God, what was that device? Whatever it was, it didn't matter as it would never work on her again even if it was the last thing she did. "What do you want?" she demanded, looking up at the long hair man. There was someone about him that struck her, but she could not place it.
However, just as she turned from the lab to get a breather, Bruce turned around, and his eyes immediately locked onto her. She could feel his surprise as he suddenly dropped the tool in his hand, and though she couldn't hear him, she could make out her name coming off his lips.
"Stop, Rogers. Stupid doesn't look good on you," Tony snaps, coldly.
"Not let," Schmidt said. Steve let out a smile, which the mad man didn't like, and it only served to anger the man more. "Erskine resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?" Skully snapped.
happen again. I… g-grabbed her thinking a fan has broken in," He paused, taking a deep breath, "but regardless, I shouldn't have reacted like that. I'll have to live with that, and by chance it happens again, I give your permission to use that on me." He pointed toward the knife. "You can cut me like a fish."
As the voice made Toni's skin crawl, she tried to ignore the man and walk deeper into the park. He was like everyone else on the street, throwing catcalls at her, but she didn't care- refused to care. They were just words, meaningless words, and they would not break through into her mind…though it might be a good thing. A distraction she needed.
The genius was still having a difficult time putting things together. She wasn't sure of what was happening, besides the cold water running down her warm face.
That concept was a new thing to her, never experiencing this before with anyone, and it scared her at times—well all the time. How could this have formed so fast and she not know? It grew like a wild vine without her knowing, and it was strong like a steel cable. There was no cutting or fighting it, as it grew like a rose torn. Again, the idea of it 'cutting' it made her ill—more so than she cared to admit, but it still was a shock to her brain to realize how she far she had fallen for the super soldier.
"Ouch, Stark, even Rogers?" Clint replied, with a chuckle. "I guess he isn't getting any."
"Well, I got I got to go!" She waved before bolting to into the tent.
And I did see Civil War, I won't say that I hated the Movie, though Winter Soldier is still my favorite. However, that movie made me angry. I went in wanting to be Team Cap, but I came out, wanting to beat someone. The Movie made it seem that Rogers was willing to do anything to save Barnes, which kind of shows why the Accords are needed...
Toni's whole world spun on that and black started to pierce through her vision. "What?" She uttered, her throat feeling like tight. "How?" She could barely recall anything, just remembering Barnes's cruel smile. She remembered agreeing. She remembered feeling this trepidation bubbling inside of her, but this
"I'm fine. You can go tell Colonel Salty that."
*O*O*
"Just keep talking. It doesn't matter what you say," Rogers said. He paused as he glanced toward Toni, who had stiffen as Madame Hydra continued to play with her hair. "You hadn't seen anything yet. If you think you won, you have another thing coming."
Now, the rest of the avengers were fucked. Well besides Bruce and Steve. She would make sure her science buddy and heater were safe, killing anything that came close. Now, the rest of them be damned. Okay, Barton may last for a while. Men with arrows seemed to last long in a Zombie apocalypse, while Romanoff might not be as lucky. No, it wasn't because the Black Widow couldn't fight like the bad ass that she was, but she was a close combat kick ass spy, and that meant she would probably be bitten as she fought them off. Now, Steve was close range fighter as well, but he was-
He shook his head, because this couldn't have been a coincidence. There was no way that Howard would have known his daughter would look exactly like Toni.
"Toni, I got you," he uttered, softly, as he started to rock her tenderly. "I got you."
Are there bad guys in Rose Hills?" The boy paused as he stared at Toni. "Do you…do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?" Harley could see her struggling as she used a brick wall for support.
He was a man of little words and it annoyed Barnes. "Is it permanent?" he asked, trying to get something out of him.
Bien plus qu'un joli visage : More than just a pretty face
Pepper was annoyed. "How can you people be a team?" she asked, moving out of the way. Something was going to happen and she wanted nothing to do with it. One, it would be deadly, and two, they weren't her responsibility; Toni was.
His statement about someone following her hit her like a ton of bricks. "That was your guy?" she asked shocked. She never expected his man to attack her. He could have killed her; he would've killed her if that mystery hero didn't jump in. "You had your man attack me?" she asked as she slammed her fists down on the table.
Steve glanced at Toni for a second before turning back to operating window. "He's fast and strong. He had a metal arm."
For the next few minutes, Steve watched her interact with Banner. His jaw was locked in place as he eyed her hand resting on Banner's arm while the other rested on lab table. They were looking at something chatting away, and even if Steve wouldn't hear what they were saying, he doubted he would understand what they were saying. It was another thing that he hated. There was a part of her life that he would never understand.
He had an accent, which Toni of course knew of, but it caught her off guard. It made her feel like she could trust him…What was it about accents that drew people in? "I don't have anything to tell."
Steve laughed. "Maybe, but not in the living room. Don't need Barton to come walking in here."
Toni narrowed her eyes. "Oh, yes, I do, you asshat."
Out of mental exhaustion, she fell to her hands and knees, resting her head against her cold, shaky hands. As she knew that Barnes was going to die, she didn't think his death would destroy her like this. And how could she move pass this when she was the reason he was dead? She could've warned him. She could've done something.
"Oh, look, it's Stark," Sam say, painfully loudly. "Is he cuddling with Nat and Jim?" he asks, innocently. There's a fucken smile on his face, a clear sign of what he's trying to do. The ass! "He lo—OUCH!" he yells as Barnes punches in the shoulder. The Falcon is almost knocked to his feet by the force of the punch, and it takes all that he has to remain upright. Rubbing the already bruising shoulder, he adds. "Hey, man! Not cool. Not cool."
She was hoping that she could run those feelings away, but she still felt like she was falling. Falling to her death. Free falling was one of the scariest things in Toni's opinion, because it was a total loss of control. There was nothing that anyone could do to stop themselves from falling to their deaths. The only thing a person could do was watch, watch him or her fall, and while they fell, they got to imagine what their death would feel like before truly feeling it. For Toni, this nightmare was the worst, because she had experience it before. She had free-fallen over New York, and she had been completely helpless, unable to save herself. Unable to do anything, and that feeling was worse than death itself.
"Maybe, you should rest," he stated as he stepped toward Rogers.
So instead, she was on the top of the tower with a blanket around her, staring at the lit dark sky, as she counted the stars she could not see. One of the downsides of living in the city, you can't see stars, due it being too bright. She could compare it to a Christmas tree, as everywhere you look, something was lit. This was a one of a kind view that she couldn't get anywhere else. At her former beach house, she would sit on her porch over the ocean and stare at the blacken sky, as the cool breeze hit her. Wrapped in a light blanket, she could just stare out at the murky sky, listening to the waves as they hit the cliff. She couldn't do that now. Though she loved the city, it wasn't what she needed now.
Toni was so close to him that she could hear his breathing change and it made her wonder if she had gotten to him. Sure, she had insulted him, but she didn't think those insults had affected him as much as that statement did. It made her feel guilty, and she hated to feel guilty.
Toni glanced at Rogers before giving a hard push to Barnes. "My stalker and yes," she answered, hating that she had to admit that she had a stalker. "And I don't want to talk about it." Before they could say anything, Toni bolted into the bathroom. She locked it as soon as the door was closed. "I really don't want to talk about it!"
moment, she was replaying the nightmare in her head, recalling the hatred in his eyes. God, was she loser? Was she crazy? She knew she should tell them the truth: Barnes was haunting her. She should tell them that she broke the lamb as she threw it at the ghost.
With her eye twitching, there were a few things that went flying through Toni's head, and each were nasty comments that she struggled to keep down. These comments were the type of comments that would start WW3, and she didn't need that. In fact, she could see Steve at the back of her mind, giving her the Cap's look. "I see I wasn't the only one you took from," she snapped, barely keep the insults in her head. "And here you are, nth years later in a dungeon. I'm surprised I haven't see any whips."
That was just disgusting to say the least. Was this something that the pirate got off on?
"You should be resting," Peggy said, eyeing Toni's sluggish movement.
"Just keeping it coming. I can handle it."
She groaned, not understanding why they felt the need to force Rogers and her together. Seeing him was the last thing she wanted. She didn't want see his face, his understanding….his…love, though she doubted he could ever truly love her. How could anyone? She didn't think she could take it, even if he did. How could she explain to him that she let his best friend die? That she allowed her father to die? And on top of that, she left him frozen in ice for over 70 years instead of returning him to his rightful time to his rightful person.
The glowing man didn't reply immediately, as he kept walking to her. He waited a few seconds as he smiled down at the genius. "Oh, Toni. It seemed like everyone wants you, not just my boss."
With a deep breath, Toni smiled slightly as she glanced down at the photo of her fifth birthday. Granted most of her memories were clouded, it was to forget how different her father was in the beginning of her life, and this photo was proof to that. This letter was proof that her loving father was still there through it all. He was always there, when it didn't look like it. It was-
Clint walked into the room. "It's who she." He eyed Natasha, as she walked to the chair beside the couch and sat down. She had a drink in her hand. "She isn't use to having so many people, who would care if she died, looking out for her." He crossed to the bar to get himself a drink.
"Y-you gone all Brooklyn, Cap," she said, into his chest. "I like it. Now go put on that sexy, 1940's desk uniform then slowly take it off."
Toni closed her eyes as she counted backward, trying to force this ghost out, but it was too hard to think. To do anything. Her head felt like someone had taken a hammer to it. All she saw was his wrathful grimace.

Sharon give her a soft look. "Do you want to marry him?"
Granted, i might have gotten this out sooner if it wasn't for all of the stories popping up in my head. I have so many ideas that keep playing in my heads. If I don't get them out, they distract me! Which is why i probably have so many unfinished, non published stories on my computer. Writing just gets them out. Haha
It was at times like this that he wished Bucky was here. Bucky, who wasn't always levelheaded, was a voice of reason to Steve. He kept Steve's head on straight. Bucky would know what to do, know what words to tell him, even if Bucky cursed every five seconds.
*O*O*
Toni narrowed her eyes. She hated when people checked up on her, and it just made her want to punch something. "I'm fine. You can go tell Colonel Salty that."
Letting go her of ankle, he tossed the wet pants away toward the other articles of wet clothing. "Are you okay up there, Doll Face?" he asked, slipping into his Brooklyn accent.
Toni violently shook her head, trying to get Barnes' cruel voice out of her head. Why did it have to be him? Why did he have to be the one haunting her? Why it would be anyone else? Granted, she supposed she knew the answer to that. He was one of her greatest regrets. "Stop it," she yelled at herself, as she got to her feet. She needed to get out of here before she went crazy. With this nasty voice in her head, it was only a matter of time.
? He hated that she thought of him of that. He was anything but an old man and he wanted to show her that; however, he wasn't going to fight her, not her. She was the last person he wanted to hurt in the world and he would do anything to protect her. "Well, it wouldn't really be a fight as I would fight a woman. I would let you win."
"…You knew, didn't you?" he asked. His voice was soft.
Jim's expression hardened just a bit. "We have to do this now, because I can't have you freezing on me. With everything going on, I need to make sure-"
Toni felt her heart race. How did her father know that she was going to try to do something? How the hell did he know? Why did he keep besting her every freaking time? Why did she always lose? Even when she won, she always seem to lose. She was meant to be alone in her pain, wasn't she? "Selfish Asshole," she said, hiding her pain with her anger. Why didn't he let her save him? Did he hate her or something? What was it? "Did he not think I could do it on my own? That I couldn't do the impossible? I wish he was here so I can punch him. He denied me of my greatness. The asshole." Her tears were close to the surface, but she refused to let them out.
However, it seemed to have worked, because the assassin groaned and dropped her. Not wasting any time to thank whatever god was up there, Toni got to her feet. She didn't care that her body was on fire. As soon as she was on her feet, she bolted. She didn't look back to see if the metal armed assassin was back on his feet. Though, she did hear Rollins, who seemed to have picked that moment to wake up, in the background.
Someone in the room coughs and mutters, "Skynet." But it doesn't cut the tension in the room.
Natasha looks at him one last time before she gets to her feet and walks to the door. For a brief second, there's a change in her expression, but it's gone in a flash. "If you say so. I don't want to see you hiding in your lab again," she said. "And I'm not alone. Remember that, Stark. Remember that."
Rogers looked at him shocked. "But if you know where they are, why not at least…?"
"Boss," JARVIS called, "You have gone twelve hours without eating. It will be unwise not to-"
It annoyed Toni that Peggy was able to get to her. "Fine."
A blushing Steve placed the two glasses on the table before he took the popcorn from Toni. "…So why does
"I'm aware," she replied, thinking back to her childhood. Whenever her father spoke to Peggy, it was always Peg with the rare Peggy. Her mother wasn't a fan and always making a face whenever he called Peggy that. Toni was aware why her mother made that face, not trusting her husband with Peggy. However, even as a child, Toni knew there was nothing to worry about.
Clint gave Bruce a look before he glanced toward Steve, who was still glaring at him. The archer would've flinched under the stare if it wasn't for the fondness in Steve's eyes that followed as he glanced down at Toni. "Is this how it's going to be for now on, Rogers? Stark's ever present protector?" he asked. "Leave me unable to prank her again? Unable to do anything to her? How unfair is that!"
That had been one of Toni's fears, which was why she hadn't tried it yet. What would she do if it didn't work? "How did you come to that idea? You have no idea of what I'm trying to do," she replied.
While kneeling in the cold mud, Steve mindlessly looking through the wreckage, but he wasn't really looking for anything. His mind was on Toni, not on the scene in front of him. After finding the single piece from the Iron Man's hand blaster, it meant she was here, but it also meant she was in a fight, which didn't sit well with him. It meant Toni had dug herself a hole, and Steve had no doubt the Mandarin would strike while she was down. They would see it as a challenge. "Barton," he said, placing a gentle warning in his voice. "Not now."
"She's in her lab," Pepper stated in annoyance. "She's always in her lab."
Toni let out a sigh as she sat back in her seat. "Geez, Romanoff, did anyone teach you how you shouldn't interrupt a make out session?" she asked, putting on a goofy smile. She didn't want to think about the 'party' that awaited her upstairs, knowing it wasn't going to be any kind of fun. Plus, she wasn't emotionally ready for that conversion. She was still struggling with her guilt. "Kill each other?"
Anyhow, I hope you enjoy this chapter.
She really hated to be handled things, but Steve wouldn't listen. She glared at the glass before grabbing it out of his hands. "Thanks," she muttered, annoyed. As their fingers touched, she felt her heart skip and her annoyance die.
"The Serum," he replied. "And there was some ice."
The Genius had always thought that Harley was a pain since the second that she saw him. Really, she thought he was a pest, but there was a small part of him that grew on her. He was a brother that she never wanted, but that didn't mean she wouldn't protect him like a brother, an annoying little brother…Again, she didn't want a brother…though her younger self might have. However her younger self was an idiot, even if she was already inventing at that age.
"Toni," he said, clearly not believing her.
And now? He was on the run from SHIELD. He was a criminal and Toni was missing. If they were declaring Rogers a criminal, what did that mean for the famous Iron Man? Was she dead? Was she being tortured? Where the hell was she? Sharon didn't like this feeling bubbling in her stomach. Was she working for the bad guy? She had to be, because Captain America was not the bad guy.
Toni snorted. "And you want me to join you after you said that, Asshat." She wondered if she would turn out like these mindless idiots. She would rather die than be one these thing, because they weren't human anymore.
Toni, who was still wearing Rogers' coat, was eyeing Barnes right back. She had no idea of why they were having an eye staring contest, but she wasn't going to lose. She didn't lose often and she refused to be beat by James Barnes, even if he was a delicious eye candy.
Toni let out a chuckle as she tied a light scarf around her waist to give the illusion of hips. "Do you think my face counts as credits?"
Toni stared at him, because she wouldn't put it pass Salty; however, he was against it. He didn't want her anywhere this man, as he didn't believe it was worth the risk, but it was. She needed one of those hydra cores. They were the only thing in this time period that would be able to power the device, being created from the Tesseract. She knew she couldn't get the cube, but those cores might be close enough. "You could be right," She stated as she watched him cross to the door. "But that isn't it."
Pain was coursing through her, sending tremors down her body. Toni just wanted- no, needed it all to stop somehow so she could rest; however, she did
"But she doesn't need an arc reactor, right? I remember her once telling me she was once hooked up to a car battery." Bruce took a seat as he tried to figure out if there was a way he could save her.
"You're disgusting, you know that?" he said, looking at her as she wiped her mouth with a napkin.
She thought about Clint and Natasha, but they were most likely with Steve, and like him, they would've their phones off.
He stared at her for a few long seconds before he answered, "Phillips told me I did a great disservice to my best bud for kissing you, and I couldn't disagree. I knew how Bucky felt about you, and I didn't want to betray Bucky's memory. I didn't want to dishonor Bucky by going after you."
She clicked through her scanner/hack, while trying to figure out a way to distract the man in front of her; however, while doing that, she did found the exact location of her unnamed device.
After putting on the white undergarments, she slipped her arms through the off-white blouse and buttoned it. Before putting on the skirt, she put on a slip, an article of clothing she didn't understand the point of. After tucking her blouse in the skirt, she took a seat and put on a pair of kitten heels, another article she didn't understand. Standing up, she wandered back to the mirror and glared at her reflection.
"Toni, what happened?" Barnes asked, in the softest voice he could muster.
And geez, everyone thought Toni was beyong cruel in the last chapter. I must say there was part of me that didn't think she was cruel enough, and was tempted to make her more cruel to him.  I guess it is good that I did not.
"You just like to hear your own voice," the woman stated as she let go of Toni's collar and grabbing her neck.
"Why can't you take the hint? He doesn't want you here, and why would he? I was his best friend. You let me die!" His voice was cruel and angry. It was dangerous.
"I won't do it," she protested, kicking the blankets off of her. She was tossing and turning wildly. "Stop it. Just stop it, please." Her voice was weak. "…Please."
With some kind of mad ninja skill, Steve blocked the pillow without moving, though Clint was not so lucky. However, as the weapon was just a pillow, it just felt like a light slapped to the face. On the other hand, that pillow did nothing to stop the kissing couple, which Clint couldn't stop whining about.
"Yup," she stated. Maybe, I should just cool it. "If I insult you, I'm sorry. It's who I am or so I am told….a lot of people call me an asshole for my teasing. That I don't take anything serious." Maybe, that was why she couldn't keep friends. She took a deep breath. "Any help would be great though."
The woman in front of Toni may be one of the smartest woman that she knew, but she was also one of the stupidest too. She took senseless risks without a care in the world. She didn't care what happened, granted the same could be said about Toni. However, Toni could admit it, even if she didn't want to, and she felt
"When Howard wasn't at your side, he was messing with this device," he replied. "He believes the Tesseract will help you get to your time."
"That's won't do, Salty. I need to get it myself," she stated. She couldn't risk someone else getting it. Besides, she knew no one was going to make it back; the only way to ensure its return was to get it herself.
from him." He growled, as he took another step forward.
What made him fall hard were the memories of her in the 1940's, which kept appearing in his mind. Though she still had a smart mouth then, there had been something different about her. She was willing to let him in, unlike in the present where she had shut him out. In the present, she had let everyone else, including Romanoff, in but not him. Why in the hell would she let Romanoff in over him? Romanoff barely liked Toni. Yes, he was jealous over that as it wasn't fair! He had tried to connect with her, but she couldn't have it. It frustrated him to no end. In the past, she allowed herself to have some fun and she included him in it. He had no idea what changed, but he wanted that Toni back. It was hard to remember they were the same person.
She took a deep breath. "It's a long story, but that's why I'm here with Stark," she answered. It felt so weird way to refer to her father by Stark.
For a second, Toni stood there, fighting back her flinch at the loud roar. She glanced toward the loud, bright sky, wondering where this sudden, craze storm came from. She could see the ocean come to life as the waves started to reach high in the sky. They crashed down hard as another thunder roared in the night sky. The rumble was almost deafening as the windows shook slightly under the intense storm, which Toni didn't really care for. It reminded her of something else.
"Miss Stark?" the man asked as he put a hand on her shoulder, drawing her attention to him.
Phillips stepped toward. "Easy, Sark," he stated as he grabbed hold of her shoulder. "Though he should reframe form making absurd comments, he meant no harm."
"Then you should let me go?" she asked.
"Go where, Toni?"
The Super Soldier gave the genius a look before tightening his hold on her. "I'm a super Soldier. Why would I be ticklish? That seems like something stupid. A flaw, ready. Imagine being tickled in a battle."
"Agent Carter," Rogers greeted. His face practically glowing.
"You don't give yourself much credit." His expression fell slightly, but he still looked at her fondly. "I don't want easy, and yes, I know this won't be easy, but if it was easy, it wouldn't be worth having. I want you, because you'll challenge me. I know we'll fight, but everyone fights. It's normal, and I look forward for that, in fact," he said with a huge smile
"The idiot got into a fight with Toni after you left," Clint answered.
Toni thought as she pushed herself up from her seat. She had drifted during her shift and almost passed out, which would've been a bad thing. One: she didn't trust the guy she was working with, and two, she didn't need to have a nightmare in public where everyone could see. She was already the talk of the camp and she didn't need anything else added to the rumor mill, which was worse than the present day tabloids. These damn soldiers sure liked to gossip and Toni could've sworn that they were all teenage girls.
Rogers turned to her and took a deep breath. "You just like to poke fun at everything."
Steve only glanced at Bruce before he glared at the assassin, not caring about her annoyance as he was annoyed himself. "I will
"Miss, I would recommend r-"
"Tell me it's gone," Toni said into his chest. "Tell me it's destroyed." She needed it to be destroyed- needed it gone.
to see it. She didn't want to be forced back into a hospital bed, because that sleep was not restful, even if she needed it.
"Why would he pick up? He doesn't want to be dragged down with you either. He wishes he left you in that desert." Barnes sneered. "You're nothing but trouble."
The Commander pressed the blade tighter against Toni's neck, drawing blood. "No one cares for your mouth, but that does not seem to stop you," she replied angrily.
"You even gave one to Schmidt, but not me," he whined, playing the hurt card with his hand on his chest.
Natasha sounds worried, and Tony doesn't like that. When she's worried—well when she shows it, it's never good. If she can't handle something, you know it's bad. Making sure the comm is on mute, the genius asks, "FRIDAY, how bad is it?"
Howard let out a chuckle. "You're something else." He went to grab her arm to look at it, when he was pushed out of the way.
Toni glared at Barton as she noticed another box in Natasha's hands. Narrowing her eyes, she stepped away from Steve. "What's in the box, Tashie?" she asked, pointing at the box. "I don't like surprises unless I do them."
Loki finally reached her, standing inches from her, as he stared down at her. "You'll find breaking one of my deals is harder than it seems."
"I don't remember that," Toni stated.
"What's in the box?"
"Shu-" Her stalker started. The Commander put her hand up to silence him. "You can stall all you want, because no one's coming, not even the love sick Captain, and you made sure of that when you sent him away, so very heartbroken."
Why must he keep doing this? Why does he do this to himself? Does he like hurting himself? Is he a-
"You have a broken arm and leg," Steve states, plainly, his eyes falling to the boot on his foot and the cast on his arm. He's glaring at them as if they're the devil.
and doesn't that just hurt? Besides, he isn't in the right mindset for a battle right now. His emotions are all over the place, and there's no telling what riskless thing he might do in battle.
She took a seat across of Phillips and leaned forward. "I have no idea, but I can't sit here anymore and do nothing," she said quietly.
"I think you can agree, sometimes the best ideas come in the middle of the night," he replied, picking up the device. The Core fizzed in his arms but didn't activate in his hands. It was like the device was flexing its power.
"Well, I think that was meant for you." Banner said, pointing to Toni. "Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news."
"Only the ones from the future, who aren't really soldiers and had been tortured recently," he responded. "I don't need you freaking out or changing the future by doing something stupid. If I have to play therapist, I will."
Clint slammed the glass down, careful not to break it. "She isn't a child. Stop treating her like one."
Toni couldn't help but feel that there was more to this, but she pushed it away for now. To be honest, she wasn't sure she could trust herself at the moment. She was seeing ghost and panicking in the hallway like a crazy person. Her judgment was off to say the least. "And the nurse's uniform?" she said, giving Sharon a once over. The woman was once again in a Nurse's uniform. What was the point? Toni knew the truth. She didn't need the show. "And why that? You could've been anything. I would've picked a race car driver, but hey, that's me." A small smile formed on the genius' face. "And does this undercover work require you to change adult diapers. And give baths to creepy man. Because man, sucks to be you." With the blanket still around her, she kicked her feet over the edge and got up.
had happened. "What's wrong? Is there something wrong with Toni?!" he asked, his concern leaking through.
Toni let out a small chuck. "I look better than Agent Sassy Pants in there," She said, looking back at the door. "I think she's going through the ringer."
"Why don't you ask Stark? He would have access to them."
*O*O*
The man didn't respond, just stood there like a towering statue. It was creepy to say the least. It reminded her of a scary story, and it only got worse when the man took a step forward. He looked like Michael Myers as he stomped toward her.
"Runs in my family," she stated as she thought back to her father. He was the most stubborn man that she had ever met, and even now, he was one of the most stubborn person she had ever met and that included Barnes and Rogers.
"You know, I was jealous at first seeing my boyfriend checking out another guy, a guy that I thought hated me. I thought…" Bucky starts but drifting off. He pauses as he smiles. "Doesn't matter, but I decided to get to know you, even if I knew it was an uphill battle. I wanted to know why Steve cares for you so deeply, and you know what? I fell in love with you. Sure, you push me away like the punk that you are, but I could see it all. I saw how cute and caring you are- No don't deny it. You are-and with each second you let me stayed with you, I knew I wanted to know you more."
"Shut it," Barton ordered. "I agree with Pepper. Let's change the subject." He lowered his voice. Toni inched closer to the door, because he was still talking. She wanted to hear what he was saying, but she couldn't make it out. Why would he lower his voice? Did they know she was listening?
Before Steve could answer, Dugan asked, "Come to watch her beat us, Rogers?" He turned to Gabe, who had yet to show his cards and was the only one who hadn't folded. "Unless Gabe has something up his sleeves."
"He only wishes to check on your status," the AI answers. "We have been researching the effects of prolonged separation."
she told herself. She shouldn't be angry at him for getting in her way as he didn't know she was following someone, but it was hard, very hard. "I'm fine," she said harshly.
*O*O*
Bruce stepped to her, reaching for her bad ankle. Toni expected him to ask her how she got it or say something about what lead up to it, but he didn't. In fact, no one did, which was fucken odd. She expected lecture from everyone in this room, telling her how stupid it was to be out in Central Park in the middle of the night, but no one did. No one gave her any kind of talking too, and that made her nervous. Were they waiting to jump her? Or did they just pity her? She didn't—
Toni's hand dropped to Steve's knees. "You can't believe that. If you do, I'll beat you," she threatened as she lifted up her arms.
Refused to show an ounce of emotion, Toni took a few deep breath as she tried to calm herself. With anger growing inside, she needed to calm herself, because she would be
The genius from the future looked at Peggy from the corner of her eyes. She wasn't sure if she liked this friendly Peggy, though she supposed it was better than the bitchy Peggy. "Just tired," she responded as Peggy packed.
"As for the tracker. In one of your better moment, you decided that a tracker would be unethical. I was quite proud of you in that moment and pleased that I did not have to report you to the authority for stalking."
"What the fuck is that?" Clint asked as he covered his ears, and he wasn't the only one.
The word 'Tower' echoed in her head, and there was no denying how
He turned back. After a few seconds of silence, he spoke again, "Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about." He poked at the core again, but this time, it poked back. The core sent out a pulse that shattered everything in its path. The glass could not withstand the wave and it splintered, sending glass everywhere. The pulse also threw the techs and Howard several feet.
That was it; he was Rogers again to her and she was going to find some way to beat the living shit out of him. "It is because I'm a woman?" she snapped.
The AI's respond was quick. "Yes, Miss."
I hope I didn't make Future Steve seem too OOC, though I think if anyone went without sleep for a few days anyone would seem out of Character. It is like those Snickers commercials.
The Super Soldier froze, unable to process that new info. How in the hell did Howard marry Toni, when she couldn't even stand to be in the same room as him? Yes, she was less hostile to him as time went on, but there was no way that she would've married him. She just wouldn't have.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Geez, Carter," Toni utters, taking a few deep breaths. "When did you become so soft."
Tony groans loudly, cutting off the AI, as U places a shady looking smoothie in front of him. "So let me put everything in prospective: one crazy robot, who thinks he's a guard dog, and another insane bot, trying to kill me with poisoned smoothies," he says, slowly, as he rubs his chin. Just when he doesn't think anything can get worse, it does.
"Ms. Robot?" she asked, eyeing Jones as he ran up to her.
Toni froze and didn't answer right away. "What I put you through? You act like I did that on purpose. Trust me, Rogers, that experience was the fucken last thing that I wanted. Not surprised that you think that, because you think me a sadist… Maybe I am, but screw you and your belief that I can never do anything right," she uttered. "Mr. Perfect. Fuck you."
Pepper couldn't believe any of this was happening. How could they lose her again? Was this all Steve's fault? "And this is why!" She snapped turning back to Clint. "This is why I am bringing Toni back with me. This act of hers only got worse."
Two unknown, elderly men were nestled on a couch next to Steve, and just like Steve and Bruce, these two men were quiet, watching the room. One of the old men was eyeing Steve, while the other scanned the room. The man with a worn cane smiled at her when he noticed her in the doorway.
"Why do you have to ask the hard questions? I didn't study for this." Her throat felt extremely dry.
"Sex?" She asked, looking up at him. There was something in her eyes that made Steve chuckle. "Because I would be up for that. Have you seen your abs?" she asked, as she un-balled her hands and softly ran her hands down his chest, tracing his bodily lines. "I would like to lick each one."
"I know." She stated. "But it doesn't change the fact that he wanted to use me. He thought he could convince me to join him." She tried to force out those memories out of her mind as she could feel still the cold water hitting her face.
With two plates in hand, Sharon returned to the oven. "I doubt he doesn't know," she said, honestly, as she removed the pan from the heat. "He probably knows what I'm cooking right now, though isn't that an uncomfortable thought." She glanced at Toni, studying her with her eyes. There was something there, just behind her eyes. It wasn't quite readable to the genius, but it was there. "However, my job is Rogers. To watch and protect him if needed. Nothing else. What you do is not a part of my assignment. Fury won't hear about this from me."
"Oh, look who's here," he said with a smirk.
Toni closed her eyes and forced herself to look away. She was seeing things; there was no one watching her. There couldn't be. Taking a deep breath, she put the clipboard down and nodded to her replacement, who had arrived. Not a second later, she took off. She didn't want to be there anymore and she wanted to get out of sight. Even if her stalker wasn't here, she couldn't help but feel eyes on her, and it sent chills up her spine. She felt like a coward, who couldn't do anything and that irritated.
"All due respect, Sir, but horrible things had been done because someone thought it was for the best."
Toni let out a huff. "That was the main purpose of the device," she answered. Howard was too damn smart to fool and Toni wouldn't even try to lie to him, as it would be a waste of both of their time.
Clint stared and laughed. "He's sincere. I love it."
"Well, dear O', Dad," Toni started, "I take after you." Her mind started to drift toward future Rogers and wondered whether he had seem the similarity between her father and her.
The contact made her want more. "I dislike people." It was the truth. She had never gotten along with other people, and it always got her in trouble. She had learned that it was best if she was alone, and that was why it was hard for her to be on this team. She wasn't use to the backup.
Rogers didn't answer her right away as he stared at her like she was going to disappear any second. "You're awake. That's all that matters." He squeezed her hand harder. His other hand dropped to the upper part of her left arm and his thumb spiraled gently on her skin.
"She just-" Howard started.
Toni didn't have time to think or do anything as the wet cloth was placed over her face, and the bucket of cold water was dumped on her. She tried to scream as the ice water strung her burnt face, but nothing came out; instead, the water filled her mouth, choking her. This time, she thought she was going to die.
That wasn't what caught the reader's attention; it was the stains on both the letter and the photo. Besides the yellowing, there were dark spots on both. There was no pattern to these darken spots, but it was clear to what they were. The writer had cried as he wrote the letter; he had exposed himself in the letter, to the reader. He had given all that he had to write the letter.
Toni felt her heart stopped as her whole body started to shake. "What?"
She didn't know what to make of his tone, but he was correct. She sounded like a frog. "You aren't a shrimp a-anymore," she muttered, making out his large form. He was Captain America again-which meant he was an asshole again.
When the Captain saw Banner picking up the Sector, Steve's mind almost instantly let go of his anger and frustration that he had. The instant he saw it was the instant his mind went into overdrive to protect the brunette next to him. Without really thinking about it, he stepped in front of Toni, blocking her view of Banner. He wasn't going to let anything happen to her, even if it pissed her off.
"Aw," Toni uttered.
was not a traitor, even if her commanding officer was telling her so. "With all due respect, if SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why," she demanded, thinking back to the look on Steve's face when he asked her where Toni was. He was worried, and that hit her harder than he expected. He didn't trust SHIELD. He didn't trust that they wouldn't hurt her.
Toni was petite, barely weighting 100 pounds, and was only about 5 foot 2 inches. In a physical fight with a man who was twice her size, she would most likely lose; however, her brain could even the playing field. "Don't count me out just yet," Toni replied. Careful, Toni, she warned herself. You don't have the Iron Man Suit. "I can take care of myself."
"Let's getting going before the handsome Shield Agent gets bored and leaves without us," Toni said, getting to her feet.
Toni's eyes go large, noticing Steve and Sam looking at her with a certain look. "Steve." When did Sam get this close?
Toni felt her eye twitch. "And are you going to send me there, Rogers?" she asked, still playing the game. A game she would win. "And leave yourself alone? Maybe, I'll have some fun in the brig, while you're all
He watched the type again, but this time, he watched it at 3 times its normal speed. He was studying's Toni's movement, as the jumpy footage was the key. "Could this even be possible?" he asked himself. It was the only answer possible; the Device was jumping Toni back in time.
Kill me!
"I'm afraid I don't understand." She was scared of him and it showed but she forced a smile onto her face. She took a step back to put some distance between them. She had something in her hand and she held it tight.
"Still dark outside," she muttered to herself as she slowly made her way to the kitchen. Her bones ached, and she wanted nothing more than to sleep. "Start the coffee for Momma, J?" she asked, feeling her muscles twitch.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve recognized the voice belonging to Pepper Potts, who he had seen a few times since Toni had disappeared. Pepper didn't like to be in the tower lately, calling it haunted, and Steve would have to agree. Even if the tower lacked a homely feeling, Toni's present was everywhere in the Tower. There wasn't a room in the building that didn't feel like her and her huge ego.
"Steve, calm down," Barnes stated. He was standing on the other side of a table, staring between Toni and Steve. "I think Toni is going to kill you if you don't."
Virginia "Pepper" Potts walked in, wearing a silver top and a lace pencil skirt. Pepper could always pull off the pencil skirt, unlike her. Toni couldn't really pull off the girly look, which was why she stuck to jeans and t-shirts. "Are you okay?" she asked as she noticed Toni's badly wrapped hand.
"I have."
Steve took a deep breath. "That stupid cube." He hated that damn thing with every fiber of his being. It was the cause of everything that went horribly wrong.
"Can I help you, Salty?" she asked, looking over at him.
"Oh, are they?" he asked, giving her a playful look.
With a smile, Bruce leaned forward in his chair and took a deep breath. "The three of us made a bet of when you would snap and reveal your love to Toni. Clint had already lost. He thought you would've done it when you saw that centerfold of Toni. He was being overdramatic for a reason."
Toni's eye twitched as the screen flicked on. "JARVIS," she called. "I have to update your security that was way too easy for Fury."
"You know it was all an act, right? Me like you? You're pathetic. Do you know that? I gave you a bone, and you went crazy. It's sad. It really was." She was angry. "However, I will say it again. There was nothing ever between us.
Arriving outside of the robotic lab, Toni stood there for few minutes just staring at Bruce's back. Though she couldn't see his face, she could tell that he was exhausted by the tension in his shoulders. She could see his exhaustion in each of his steps. Had he not slept since she was gone? Had he stayed in this lab the whole time working on that device?
"And a mouth."
"I just knocked her out." Toni raised her right arm in a sign if surrender. "I didn't beat her up."
It felt strange to be here, even if this place was her home. It was also weird to see all of the bright colors and moving signs after being trapped in the 40's for so long. It was bizarre to see how differently people dressed and acted. Granted, she grew up and created the technology around them, it was strange to be around it again after being stuck in the past for so long, but it felt nice being back, even if she felt out of place. "Oh, you're pulling that card?" she asked, laughing hard. "Never thought you would do that,
She refused to show how scared she was so she focused on the smell of the nasty trash and not the emotionless voice. Maybe, the smell would put some other emotion besides fear in her. She shook her head, trying to free her hand. "Or smart," she retorted back, knocking his hand away.
After getting over her shock of him pulling her into his arms, she relaxed into his warm arms. "Steve," she mumbled back, thinking she had sent him to his death. There was no way that she could deal with his death so soon after Bucky, and he wasn't supposed to die.
"Seeing me tried up? Interesting?" She said, trying to play it cool. She did not like him this closer to her, especially when she couldn't do anything. And if he was behind the stalker, she really had no interest of being this close to him at all.
Toni's eyes flew open, feeling Steve's ruff hands on her waist. Again, she eyed him as he gently lifted her up with one hand, while the other tugged at her running pants. Luckily, he didn't have to worry about any kind of buckle or zipper, as he pulled them down; however, the water was acting like a glue, making it difficult but not impossible. Steve's fingers gently grazed her lower hip/upper thigh, as he curled his fingers in the fabric. He held her up by her waist until he had pulled the pants past her butt before gently setting her down. The Captain shifted again as he glanced up at Toni, who was eyeing him intently. He wasn't sure if she knew how turned on he was, though he expected teasing if she did.
"No, it isn't. I would be an idiot if I thought that." He took a step back from Toni and looked into her eyes. "I'm just worried that's all." He paused for a second. "You are important to…" He let himself drift off unable to finish it
"I'm pretty good at poker." Toni boasted. "Maybe-" She jumped when she noticed a shadow change.
So, why was he still here? Did he want something? His future Best Friend just left. Was he looking for something? She didn't have to ponder for long, as he held something out to her. "You aren't giving me your number, are you?" she asked, eyeing the card. "Not that I can blame you. That way you can say you tried."
Tony blinks for a few seconds as he pokes at the food in front of him. "Oh, is that tonight?" he asks, truly forgetting in his angst. "Sure, why not." He knows he shouldn't have said it, but he can't help it.
She pulled away slightly. "Now get going," she ordered. "I have to get ready for the sunny skies. I can go outside in my bathing suit in December, which the media will love. They love to see my skin."
"We do not have time for fun."
Toni gave him a look before she turned back to Rumlow. "So why do you?" Her eyes started at the top and worked their way down his heavily armed body. Her eyes reaching his chest, she noticed a patch on his uniform. Her heart beat against her ribs as she noticed what it said: S.T.R.I.K.E. Even if those memories—if they were memories- were just a blurry mess, they came flooding back, though she didn't know what any of that meant.
When Tony's in pain, anger is his best friend, and he'll always go there. He'll always start a fight,
"Only with you," he said, smiling. "We're going to do this together."
"Why-" She couldn't finish her sentence as there was water, dripping off the table. There had been a glass of a water on the table, and it had tipped over when she shoved Howard into it.
?" he sneered, coldly.
"No, Boss," comes the AI's replies. "
Lifting his head, Steve glanced down at her, expecting some kind of respond from her, but there was nothing. He was shocked to find her passed out in his arms. He knew she was exhausted; he could see it, see that she was fighting it, but he didn't realize how fast she would fall sleep in his arms. And he couldn't fight his smile, knowing that she could fall sleep so easily in his arms. There was pride in his chest at the thought of her trusting him enough to do so.
Being frozen in ice for seventy plus years was a numbed experience in which he didn't feel a thing. It just went by in a blink of eye and he felt nothing. It was complete and utter nothing. He didn't dream, he didn't think. It wasn't even known if he was alive during that time. How could he have been alive? He was frozen; how could a body survive such harsh temperatures? No one should have been able to survive that, but he wasn't just anything one. He was a soldier… and not just any soldier. He was Captain Steven Rogers, a super soldier with unknown strengths and weakness; however, it seemed one of his strengths was that he could survive extreme temperatures for decades.
She didn't admit who
The Asset's eyes shifted to the Rumlow, studying his face. He knew that face, knew it well. It was the fact of a killer, a face that the Asset wore often. This would be the Senator's last night, as he could be dead in the morning. Now, the Soldier didn't find this odd, but he did find it odd that Hydra sent three to kill the senator. It was illogical and not technical as it increased the risk. They just needed to send him as he could've done it quick and fast without the Senator even knowing he was there. The reason he could think of was that Hydra no longer considered him their best weapon, and he needed hand holding, but if that was the case, they should do away with him, since he was only a weapon after all. There was no need to keep him away if he was not functioning at 100%. Was he in error? Why didn't they believe him now? Had he failed his handlers in some way?
Bruce chuckled, while Natasha just shook her head. Clint let out an annoyed huff as he eyed the Captain. "You, Cap," Clint replied. "But I guess we all know what your mind is on…or rather who is on your mind."
Fighting back her panic, Toni peeped out from the corners of her eyes toward the stranger, though unable to make out his face through her messy, fallen hair. The men's voice was weird, yet almost familiar, but the genius couldn't place it. "Sure," she croaked, though she knew she shouldn't take water from a stranger. Knowing today's world and who wanted her dead, this could be a kidnapping, though Toni doubted she was very useful in her current state unless he wanted to kill her. She could literally be knocked over with a stick...
Toni was lying down in a patch of dead snow covered grass, using her binoculars as she watched the two groups move toward the small well-guarded base. Her small form was almost invisible, while Barnes, also using binoculars, was kneeing next to her. He was only a few inches from her. "It seems like they're almost in place," she said as she stared at Rogers, who looked like an ant form this distance. He looks cute as an ant, she thought with a smile.
have daddy issues!
It was only ten minutes later that Fury returned with another folder, a newer folder than the ones that Fury had given him before. "Here's Toni Stark's folder. I don't know what you're looking for, but you won't find it with her. She won't be that anchor to the past for you."
The man pushed himself up, slowly getting to his feet. His eyes weren't on her, looking past her at something. He looked almost scared, but Toni didn't look back to see what he was looking at. He would probably jump her once she turned her back. "You're not worth it," he snapped, before he turned and walked away. Still not looking behind her, Toni watched him walk away, before she turned back toward Central Park.
She had one plan and that was getting home to her time. "Don't you think I'll kill you or something?" she asked, opening the folder he gave her. From the corner of her eye, she eyed Phillips, who had finally put the report away and she lost the will to read the file Howard gave her.
"Wait, what does Trip do? Maybe, he could take Rogers." Jones and Dugan gave her a look. "Geez, can none of you take a joke?" she said, letting out a sigh.
Natasha stopped laughing and turned her attention back to Steve. "Barton just meant you and Stark are leaders of this group, and it's not a good thing when you two fight."
Toni's eye was twitching, and it wasn't because she was bitter. It was because this man was an idiot and her holograms were so better. So much better. "No," she said as she crossed her arms.
"Come on. Talk to me, Toni," he asked, almost begging. Even with her struggling, Steve tucked her head under his chin and held her tight. "No, you aren't," he said, strongly. "When is the last time you slept?" he asked into her hairline.
looking for an anchor. He was looking for Toni, though he didn't know if this 'Toni Stark' would be helpful. Why would she be?
The genius laid there for a second, just laid there in silence. She wasn't sure if the Good Captain was awake, but there was no breaking out of his arms, not that she wanted to. She was okay with laying in his arms, even if it eleven am…
Bucky sighed. "I understand." He glanced back to the newspaper, which was laying overtop of something. Only a corner of a white envelope was visible. "But you need to think this through."
"Toni, fine, be stupid," Pepper yelled in frustration. "I'm not going to try then." She turned away and walked up the steps. It hurt to see Pepper work away, but Toni knew this was what she wanted.
"Ask your father." His eye was twitching.
Toni's expression turned hard, as she heard him ask that. Though it wasn't a serious question or even a question about her identity, it cut her to the core. Her relationship with her mother was cut short by Maria's death, and it still hurt, knowing she wasn't able to learn from her. There were points where Toni wondered what her life would have been like if she had a mother and wasn't alone with her father. "My mother died when I was young."
She patted herself on the cheek before running her good hand through her messy hair. "Stupid hair." It was a mess and she had no way to fix it. "Maybe, I should just cut it all off," she told herself as she combed her hair with her hands. Pepper wouldn't be here to stop her. She eyed a pair of scissors at the end of the dresser, and after a few seconds of staring, she reached for them. She brought it to her hair, but she couldn't do it. Sure, she didn't care what her hair looked like, but she didn't want to slaughter it, which was what would happen if she cut it herself.
"Toni," he said, looking at Barnes.
She walked toward him. The short sleeve dress went a few inches below her knees, and it hugged her body. "Can you zip this for me?" She asked as she showed him her back.
She gives him a look, mumbling to herself, but the genius can't make it out. She just stares at him for a few second before she speaks, "Are you sure? You hadn't spoken to anyone since you got back."
don't blame you."
"It's okay. I have you, Toni."
committed. "Sure, I am awesome and there're a lot of things why you should be worshiping the ground I walk on, but what did I do this time?"
Shaking her head, Toni pushed herself up and wiped her eyes. She didn't want to wait for that man to come back. She needed to get away, far far away. She didn't want to be here anymore and she just wanted to go home, her home in the future with the Avengers.
How the hell did they get here? Steve wasn't sure. At first, he wanted to hold her and never wanted to let go, but now, he just wanted to turn and walk away. "Me? You're the one with a chip on her shoulder." Maybe, she really didn't care about him. Maybe, it was all an act. Would Bucky get a kick out of this? He said it from the beginning that she would hurt him, but Steve never thought it would happen.
"Then you'll never get home." Loki walked back to the cot and pick up Toni's journal. "Don't you want to escape the guilt?" He opened the book to a random page and looked down as if he was going to read it. "You can't get over the guilt that you have knowledge that can spare these mortal's lives." He waved his hand in the air, motioning to the people in the camp. "I'm not sure why you're so guilt ridden over these pathetic humans."
Phillips kept back his snort in annoyance as Erskine was able to get her. "Figures," he muttered to himself. "Though, it seems like the silence is getting to her." He knew she would because the silence was maddening.
His mind flashed back to the man in the alley, hovered over the Toni like prey looking at his food. His face was hidden, but Steve knew the face. Knew what that might. The man wasn't going to kill Toni. "So, he's a ghost story?"
"Well, too bad."
Everything was pounding around her. It was pulsing, bumping like a speaker playing loud music, and all she wanted to do was cover her ears. Toni could feel the world around her explode—like bombs going off, though that could just be all in her head. Her head was pounding. Sure, she was in a middle of a battle, a fight with
"…You just found out that you're my father and you're already saying that? After everything? I know I pissed you off more times than not," she said, staring at him.
"Stop," she yelled herself as she took a step deeper into Steve's apartment. Just how she imagined it, the place was kept simple with only a few personal items. Besides a few pictures of his parents, Bucky, and her, there was no personal items. There was any color in this monotone room, which also gave it no personality. It was like he never moved in, only keeping what he needed to live. Toni could admit it that she enjoyed that fact, because that meant he didn't consider this place his home. This place was not his home.
Steve opened the door to the apartment for Bucky as he carried Toni in. During the walk up, she hadn't stirred which shocked both of them as they expected her to make some noise or something. "You can take her to my room and I can take the couch," Steve offered, as he opened the door to his room.
"You didn't beat me. I forfeited. There's a difference," she countered. "We can go another round if you like." She gave him a big smile. "Want to go?" She waved her numb fist at him as she hopped around like a boxer. Jones laughed. "It doesn't have to be a poker game. It can be anything else. A drinking contest? I can outdrink any one!" Toni had no idea of where this energy was coming from.
Steve forced himself to take a deep breath. "Because SHIELD isn't who we think they is?"
Toni sighed. "Turn on the speaker."
Harley Keener smiled up at her. "That giant wormhole, in um…in New York. Does it remind you?"
Toni picked up the paper. "These are enlistment papers," she stated, as she glanced them over. These papers belonged to Barnes, which wasn't all too surprising. Though the Captain didn't speak about it, she knew Barnes had enlisted and died in the war. It was the push that Rogers needed, but she wouldn't wish that on anyone. "You know you can change that," she said to herself. She had the power to rewrite history. Sighing, she knew she couldn't do that, and she put the paper down.
He gave her his signature smile. "Off putting my affairs in order." He had a way about him, which could calm anyone.
Hey all! Hey is the next Chapter for you. I hope you enjoy it. It's almost twice the size of the first Chapter. Didn't mean to make it so long, but I hope you enjoy it
"Why do I even try?" he asked, placing a kiss to her temple. He could feel her shiver as he kissed her, but he didn't let that stop him. If she didn't pull away from him, then he took it as a good sign.
"I'll be up later. Now, can you leave me alone?" he asks, as he pushes the plate away from him. He knows how broken his voice sounds, but he hopes that Steve doesn't call him on it. He hopes that he just leaves. He wants to be alone. Steve gives him a look before he pushes himself up onto his feet and turns to leave. There's a hesitation in his step as he moves to the door, but he does not stop as he leaves. His shoulders are small.
"I'm not a soldier," she protested, loudly, as she slowly took the card. She looked down at it, reading the heavy print on the card. She stared at the font, her heart racing. Why was this hitting her so hard?
*O*O*
The man stepped into the light with his hands in the air, revealing who he was. "Relax," Barnes stated as he smiled at her. "It's just me."
"Trust me, that isn't how," she snapped. "Just tell me where you want to do this, and I'll meet you there." She said as she turned to the door. She needed to get out as she was ready to snap at the next person who tried to tell her what to do. Her temper was getting the better of her, and her exhaustion was making it all worst.
"Oh, yes we do, Stevie!" Toni whined. Her voice, though loud, sounded forced, and it was clear that she was struggling to stay awake.
Steve took a deep breath as he made his way down to the lab that Banner had locked himself in. He should have told Banner the truth when he brought up the time travel idea, instead of keeping it to himself. It was important. He knew he was going to get a lecture when he told Bruce. How could he be that stupid and not tell him about the memories? Shaking his head, he took a deep breath as he arrived at the doors to the lab. The doors were, like Stark's own personal lab, made out of glass; however, they weren't given a horrible paint job. He entered without having to enter a code as no code was required.
Things felt better now that Toni had settle things with Steve, though things were still weird with Peggy. She wasn't her mean self at the moment; sure, she still told her what to do, but she was kind of nice about it and that stuck Toni as odd. She wasn't sure if this was a trick or whether Peggy was turning a page. Was she calling a cease fire? She hoped so, because she did not have energy to fight anymore. She had other thing to do like stealing a core from her annoying father. However, that was turning out to be a bigger challenge than she expected. She should've expected that since her father could always outsmart her.
"Because I realized that I don't know you, not really. Why were you in that lot? Did you ever get your memory back? Did you really have memory lost in the first place? Why are you here, fighting in this war?" he asked. "What happened to you to make you close out the world? And I know that this isn't about Bucky."
That was something Toni would normally listen to, but that did seem like something Steve would enjoy. And, judging by how he pulled out a tiny notebook, she knew he would at least listen. However, before she could make a comment, Steve's phone chirped—his horrible out dated phone, though she probably hated it for another reason.
Phillips, who was sitting across from her, eyed her; he was trying to read her. "I still have my doubts, but-"
"The pot call the kettle black," Barnes teased, walking back to her.
Both of them looked at her, as if they couldn't believe she was playing this game; however, it was Steve who spoke, "You're pregnant, Toni."
Toni spun out of his hands. "You have some dimples on you." She didn't want to talk right now.
"I swear I'm not a baby sitter, and I refuse to be one," Pepper stated as she walked to the door. "The Avengers are children."
"Toni," Phillips uttered
Nightmares plague his dreams every time he closes his eyes, but there's no one to see it, and he doesn't know if he should be happy or sad. He doesn't know if he can take someone sees him like this. He doesn't like the idea of someone seeing him this weak. He just doesn't. He can also blame his father for that, because his father had made sure he knew that. Knew that Stark Men weren't and aren't weak.
Toni's heart raced, not knowing that someone was in the room, and in her surprised, her arms gave way and she collapsed back onto the bed. "Shit," she cursed. Not wasting any time, she tried to push herself, but before she could, she felt a set on hands on her, keeping her stil.
"Too close to what?" Toni hated when people didn't get to the point and side stepped. Why couldn't he just say what he was thinking?
Wilson laughs. "How does your wife put up with you?"
"You're going to come out with me?"
"I would not suggest that," JARVIS stated, "There would be no telling what it would do to your chest piece if you increased the power."
"Yes, Miss Potts," he stated. The key pad on the glass doors blinked and the door flew open.
In the corner of the kitchen, the former Russian spy had the Captain against the wall with only a knife pointed at him. Like with Clint, there was a look on her face that Toni hadn't seen before. The woman looked down right pissed. She snarled. "I expected more from you, Rogers." She turned slightly, glancing at the broken lamp on the ground.
