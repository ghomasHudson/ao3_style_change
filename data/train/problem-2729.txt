“I’ve been uh… socializing some on weekends, thought maybe I’d give this a shot. Brought you something.”
When this first started, Dean had trouble saying anything. It’s a bit easier now, he’s getting more comfortable with the idea that here he can share things he might not feel comfortable having friends or family know. But it’s still a work in progress, which is why instead of telling Henriksen the truth, Dean says, “To see it through to the end, I guess.” It’s the truth, but it’s not the whole truth.
?” Claire says, looking affronted. “You know what?” she says, gesturing at Jimmy with a french fry, “I’ll allow it.”
Dean, apparently, does not need to be told twice. He descends upon Castiel, hands gripping Castiel’s waist as he tilts his head and moves in for a kiss. It’s good, wonderful, even. Dean may vacillate between moods with haste but when he kisses, he does so with his entire being. Castiel’s eyes drift closed, and he sighs into Dean’s mouth, shuddering when he feels Dean’s tongue against his.
“Present, huh?” Bobby hates presents, but he’s not going to turn down a gift from his long lost surrogate nephew, and they both know it.
He does, but he’s never told anyone here that. Gordon’s back in Lawrence, high school was a long time ago, and Dean hasn’t ever seriously dated a guy anyway.
Dean reaches out, putting his hand over Castiel’s phone. “It’s okay, Cas. I wanna go to your favorite place,” he says, smiling timidly. “Getting a whiff of some salmon or whatever isn’t going to kill me.”
“I’m listening,” Dean says. Castiel’s never seen anyone look so serious about pizza, including Claire.
Dean has a key to Castiel’s house, because Castiel gave him a key three weeks after the house became his. Why
They mostly chat about the house as they dine, improvements Dean’s made, what they’ll work on tomorrow, what they’ll do the next time Dean comes back. The conversation turns to family, and Dean’s really not sure how but he blurts out, of all things, “Did I tell you I have a grave?”
Sam stops talking immediately. He pouts, but nods. Oak tree is a sort of conversational safe word they came up with as kids, when talking about their parents and the divorce always seemed to lead to one brother storming away in frustrated tears. Since then it’s been used in other scenarios, like when Sam doesn’t want to talk about his dead college girlfriend, or when Dean doesn’t want to talk about the pair of pink panties Sam found in his dresser when Dean was in his twenties, or when Sam doesn’t want to talk about his thousands of dollars in debt for his unfinished law degree. “Oak tree” was chosen because when Dean was eleven he got so pissed about Sam’s questions about their parents’ separation he went out back and broke two fingers punching an oak tree.
Dean’s at the grocery store, staring in dismay at the list Sam gave him. It’s not the array of fruits, vegetables, and grains that bothers Dean, it’s the fact that Sam wrote “TWO SNACKS OF YOUR CHOICE!” at the bottom like Dean’s a fucking six year old that needs to be offered snacks in order to eat healthy.
By the time Dean gets to Crown Heights, he’s only got one thing on his mind, and that thing is lasagna. When Castiel answers the door, Dean bellows “Where’s my dinner?!” and grins wide. Castiel grins back, and that… well that puts one other thing on Dean’s mind. Damn, what a cute smile.
It’s not long before Dean’s pulling up in front of a welcoming looking brick house, where Hannah is out front, laughing and spraying a flailing child with a hose.
“I was before, and thanks to your rousing speech at the restaurant, I’m starting to think some day I can be one again.” They’re back in the living room now, and when Dean flicks on the light, Castiel is staring at him in a way Dean can only describe as intense. Dean slumps slightly. “Dude, I’m sorry, I was only kidding around.”
“We could exchange rings,” Castiel tries. “I know that symbols of commitment are often very important to humans…”
“I apologize,” Castiel says without bothering to feign empathy. “I’ll make sure to double check your order next time.”
Dean is. Two months ago he was a surly lumberjack looking man that spoke in tight, clipped sentences and seemed to have an allergy to smiling. Now… he’s easily amused, his floor is littered with cat toys for Sugar, and Castiel is starting to think Dean
Dean brings Castiel to his apartment, instructing him to sit on the couch before he disappears with his toolbox. The white cat is lying on the coffee table, sleeping atop an open book that Castiel can’t identify through all the fur.
Amelia doesn’t come around. After a week of drifting about the house like a ghost, she comes to Jimmy with a brochure, a place she wants to send James to for treatment.
“Wonderful news,” Castiel mutters. “Let me know if anything changes.” He braces himself over Dean, reaching for the button on Dean’s jeans. The sleeping bag they’re still under is hiding them both from view, but anyone looking would know exactly what’s going on. Dean doesn’t love that idea, but whatever, he doesn’t live here, and Castiel’s fence is pretty high.
“Not really. I wasn’t very social in my youth, so I didn’t have any old friends to come back to. I mostly spend my time with Hannah and Gabriel… Michael when he visits. Plus my niece. I suppose I’m getting along well with the odd woman who lives next to Hannah. We jog together some mornings. She calls me Clarence and insists on describing her romantic conquests in excruciating detail.”
Castiel tries to snuggle against his pillow as well, but his pillow case is on the scratchy side. “What?”
“Sure, but I’m gonna want something in return,” Ash says, and his voice is so suggestive that Castiel is certain he’s about to suggest Dean perform some sort of sexual act upon his naked body.
“That is not information I needed,” Castiel says, despairing at the mental images fighting to fill his mind.
It’s not long before Castiel runs out of “work safe” stories, and he eyes the two with the adult rating.
Thank you to everyone for your comments as I posted chapter after chapter the past few weeks, I know I rarely respond, but I always read them, I'm always jazzed to see those notification e-mails. Finding out a chapter had someone laughing their way to an asthma attack or hearing about a couple reading my fic together, or learning the story cheered someone up on a bad day, that always means the world to me. I don't say that enough, how grateful I am.
Castiel chews on his bottom lip, considering. It feels… odd. Not bad, but not quite sexual, either. He can’t help but worry that Dean is watching his reaction and finding it lacking, but he endeavours to relax as Dean starts kissing along his shaft, working the finger deeper in little shallow thrusts.
He starts to slowly scoot to the side, then stops. There are times, since Dean has returned, where Dean feels like simple social etiquette completely escapes him. Politeness, social intuition, shit like that, those are muscles that atrophied in Dean’s years of solitude. He needs more practice, he knows, which is hard when the only people he interacts with are his brother and his doctors. After another moment of pondering, Dean decides he’d be kind of an asshole to just leave a dude sleeping on the ground without a goodbye.
Dean’s making french toast pancakes when Castiel comes into the kitchen, shower fresh and eyeing the stove with interest.
Since then he’s learned to work the system a bit. He shares things he’s worried about, shares progress, but he doesn’t talk about a lot of the things he knows aren’t “normal”. Nightmares about the plane crash that he never had until he
Sam and Dean both look at Castiel, who’s staring awkwardly into space. “A human pregnancy often gives off a fairly distinct sort of energy,” he offers.
“Okay, so we’ve got the chairs picked out, shelves, a table, the end table, sofa… anything else? Beds? They don’t have mattresses here, but they have great frames.”
a lovely color,” Castiel says, holding up the swatch again and squinting some more. Dean wonders if squinting magically transposes the color onto the house in Castiel’s vision. “Perhaps Open Seas for the house, Blue Horizon for the trim, and…” Castiel flips back a few swatches. “Maybe Bungalow Beige for the porch?”
“I’m uh… I’m good, or like… the same as the last time we talked. I mean I sleep in a tent in my brother’s backyard, and the other day I started crying because I started thinking about Gilligan’s… uh I-Island, and how they never got off the— the i-i-island but at least they had each other… and, uh… I don’t know why I’m telling you this, Jesus fucking Christ.” Sam’s probably staring at him right now, but Dean’s not going to look, he’s just going to stare intently at the small puddle of butter next to his potato.
. His jealousy has been more about how much he dislikes Ketch and less about a fear of losing Tessa.
“I thought I’d gotten over that need for him to think something of me, I really thought I had, but I was so fucking wrong. After that, I dropped out of school, I enlisted in the army.” Dean’s face is in his hands. “Fucking dumb, man. Not enlisting… but doing it for
“When he saw me in the same aisle as him, he grabbed his son’s hand and rushed away as fast as he could.”
,” he groans in between kisses, shuddering when he feels Castiel’s hard length against his hip. Ten minutes ago he didn’t even know this was on the table, and now it’s happening. Castiel’s tongue is in Dean’s mouth. Castiel’s got one hand on Dean’s ass.
From Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:18pm: Compromise is important in any relationship, but so is staying true to who you are.
Castiel smiles. “I do. It’s not exactly cheerful dinner conversation, but if it will help you feel on more equal footing…”
“I was headed to a… lunch thing in this area… I saw your car in the parking lot. It’s very recognizable.”
“Hey baby, you looking for a good time?” Dean hollers from his car. Castiel glares at first, but when he recognizes Dean his eyes widen and he bites his lower lip. It’s probably not a sexual thing, but it’s making Dean have some sexual thoughts. He rises from the bench and comes to the curb. He looks to be limping a bit.
He’s just curious about Castiel dancing with this man. Curious about how their hips are moving in sync, and the man’s lips are starting to ghost up the back of Castiel’s neck while the woman practically twirls in a circle around them. Jesus, do these people think they’re at a rave? Who gets this into Garth Brooks? The song finally ends, and just like that, so does the dance. Castiel separates from his dancing partner, smiling something bright and carefree as he shakes the man’s hand, then the woman’s. Dean can’t hear what’s said, but Castiel doesn’t seem to actually know these people. In fact, the man and the woman both go sit down at a booth, and Castiel makes his way to the exit, stumbling just a little as he goes. All of forty seconds pass before Dean groans and follows.
His tone isn’t judgmental at all, but Dean still feels embarrassed. “I don’t think so, I’m fucking exhausted. It’s easy to fall asleep in my bed at home if I’m really
! All Castiel told us was that the package was lost in the mail and recently recovered, he didn’t mention you at all! What an incredible turn of events… to think you had that with you all that time, then brought it all the way here.”
Castiel gets Dean’s jeans open, and Dean’s entire body jolts when he feels Castiel’s hand over his growing erection, only a layer of cotton between them. He’s not totally sure what Castiel has in mind, but he figures he can only help the proceedings by reaching forward to pull down Castiel’s flannel pajama pants. He watches as he does so, and his face splits into a grin.
“There’s a glass angel in my mom’s house that I couldn’t stop staring at last time I was over, and after ten minutes I realized it was because it was the same color as your fucking eyes. I look at you and I want—”
“It was brutal, man. I’ve never seen two people with less chemistry, and I’m including me and my lesbian ex-girlfriend. And there was nothing wrong with either of them, you know? It just wasn’t there. I mean… sometimes it doesn’t happen right away though, there’s that to consider. But there’s no point in
Dean is asking, but he nods yes, and Dean starts pulling Castiel’s zipper down. He nods with a little more vigor.
Dean loved those chess pieces though. They all had names. Rook Henry, Knight Pamela, Pawn Jenna. His favorite was Bishop Virgil, because he always thought Virgil was a funny name when he was a kid. They had names, and they had personalities. They were his friends, even.
“Meatloaf and mashed potatoes? Did Dean bring more food over?” Claire says, already looking past Castiel to the kitchen.
” Dean says, nearly hitting himself with his palm at the obviousness of that answer. “I was thinking there was just
“Alright, cool.” Annnnd that’s enough talking. This part of the walk is just uphill enough for Dean to be getting a little winded. This was a terrible idea.
“I don’t want this to be a one time thing,” Castiel says suddenly, looking almost defiant. God he’s brave. Dean wanted to say it, but he wouldn’t have.
but good for uh… you. I’ll uh. I’m gonna go get the thing, see if it fits you.” Dean shuffles out of the room and comes back less than a minute later, holding a hanger with the waistcoat. It’s black, thin, and it looks like it might fit. “Haven’t worn this in forever, glad it’s not covered in cat hair or anything. Well, come on. Try it on.”
Dean hangs his head, huffing out a laugh. “I don’t care if you wanna feel me up, Cas. But…” Dean sighs. “Some people get kind of freaked out, uh… not that there’s been a lot of people, I guess. But. Some. And uh… yeah, they get freaked.”
Dean watches him walk away, gobsmacked, absently licking his lips. He tastes a Cosmopolitan, even though he wasn’t drinking one.
Lucifer wants to know who I’m buying a gift for, and you’re all bored enough to go along with him because it’s the end of the day.”
Castiel makes this soft, pleased sound, and the next thing Dean knows, there are two plush lips pressed against his.
“Are you one of those people that gets… super angry while playing? Last month Sammy was yelling all pissed off, and when I came to see what was up, he said someone had ‘ninja’d his loot’, I don’t even know what the fuck that
For the bed, Castiel plans to just hack down some trees in the forest, but for the rest they’re going to have to hit a Home Depot or a lumber yard or something. That means walking five miles to where the Impala sits by the highway, cloaked by Enochian magic.
“Right!” Claire shouts. “To put up his nose!” She grabs a backpack off the floor and dumps it on her bed while Kaia runs out of the room, chanting “
“Of course,” Castiel says, stepping aside to let Dean in. He watches Dean make a beeline for the kitchen, noticing for the first time that Dean is rather bow-legged. He watches Dean’s gait for a moment, and when he glances elsewhere, he realizes Claire is watching him from the couch, eyebrows arched. He looks away abruptly, turning to close the door to the apartment. He feels unsettled by the moment, but before he can dissect it, Dean yells “Are you assholes gonna come in here?!” from the kitchen, and Castiel and Claire both scramble out of the living room.
Amelia sucks in a sharp breath, clutching Jimmy’s hand in hers. Jimmy wonders if his son is about to tell them he’s gay. That would be—
as far as Dean can tell. Dean’s never really found polo shirts that exciting but the green one Castiel is wearing is kind of doing it for him.
When the evening rolls around, Garth and Benny show up, which actually helps Dean be a little more aware of his surroundings. He hasn’t seen too much of them in the past couple of years, but every time he gets together with them they fall right back into step like it’s the summer after senior year all over again. Garth’s married and running a dental practice in town and Benny’s a proud father to his daughter Elizabeth, but when they get together with Dean everyone’s collective maturity drops like a stone.
From Cas - 8/18/17 - 7:18pm: Hannah’s supposed to help out at a day camp tomorrow, and Hael is too young to come with her.
“Great!” Claire proclaims, surprising Castiel by latching onto him for a hug. “This is Kaia, and that’s Kevin,” she says, gesturing at the two newcomers. “They’re the leaders of the school’s Rainbow Alliance.”
Dean snorts. “Need a ride somewhere, cowboy?” he says, reaching over and shoving the passenger door open.
Castiel smiles and closes his eyes. He should really get up and stop listening, but hearing Dean talking calmly with his brother is a soothing balm to Castiel’s nerves. He relaxes, feeling his heart rate return to normal, letting the sound of their loving and annoyed brotherly banter wash over him. Then he hears his name.
Dean’s fingers tease along Castiel’s testicles, and Castiel shudders. “Hell yes, Cas. We could do it right fucking now. I could finger myself open while you’re trapped and waiting, then I could ride you, hard and fast until you’re shouting my name.” Castiel hears Dean’s zipper being opened. “You want that, Cas?” he says, thumb dragging through the smear of precome gathering near Castiel’s stomach.
“We text every day and it never fuckin’ feels like enough. When we talk sometimes the sound of your voice sends shivers down my back.”
“They told me about how he was all alone on a relatively small island for four years, no companionship, no medical care, foraging for his own food… surviving against crushing odds. Rachel tossed the newspaper in the recycling before she left, but…” Castiel grabs his wallet from the nightstand and takes out a somewhat worn, folded piece of newspaper. He doesn’t bother to unfold it, just holds it up. “I kept it… and I’d look at it and think to myself ‘he got through all of that and made it home, I can make it through today’, every day. Eventually I got off the Prozac and got on Zoloft every day, and Xanax some days, a sleeping aid most nights, and that’s worked a lot better for me. But I’ve still kept that article. I don’t know if I would have truly gone all the way and killed myself; at the time it sure felt like I would… but I do know how much your story helped me hang on just a little longer.”
“Uh… dunno. Bad breakup. Needed some distance, and my friend Charlie was here, so I moved in with her for a while, then I was on my own for a couple years, then Tessa… I go back to Lawrence a lot though, my brother and my mom live there.” Why is he telling his life story to this guy?
Benny lets out a loud snore. Oh good, their conversation isn’t interrupting his chainsaw impression.
“Uh, I took some Xanax like ten minutes before we left so I actually can’t drink tonight. And you’re my ride, so I hope
Castiel has this urge to cover Claire’s ears at the profanity before remembering that she swears up a storm on a daily basis. They check out the two bedrooms and the bathroom. A lot of the flooring, fixtures, and doors look new. The bathroom smells like Lysol and looks
“I should have prepared us healthy snacks for this journey,” Castiel says, gazing at their dinner with dismay.
There aren’t many people in the theater, Thursday evenings aren’t exactly big nights, so Dean has an entire row to himself. The movie is halfway through when Dean becomes aware that someone is moving through the row in his direction. His hackles go up a little, there’s plenty of space to sit, he doesn’t want anyone plopping down next to him. The person
He gets up off the couch and puts his shoes on. There’s a temptation to go and find out if Castiel has a spare blanket, but even after their conversation tonight it’s still hard to imagine going to him and saying “I need to borrow a blanket so I can sleep in your backyard”, so he’s not going to. He gathers some of his dirty clothes to use as a pillow, and heads out into the backyard.
He walks her up the cactus lined path to her well lit porch. He’s nervous. In this moment he’s not even sure he remembers how to kiss.
Outside of the ring of salt, there are animals. Quite a few, in fact. A couple of deer, four raccoons, three rabbits, a whole mess of mice. Some are asleep, some are watching him.
The next time Dean sees Castiel, it’s only two days later. He’s driving home from work, idling at an intersection when he sees Castiel sitting on a bus bench, looking annoyed. He also looks sweaty, he’s wearing jogging clothes. Snug jogging clothes. Ugh. This is fucking ridiculous, Castiel is suddenly
It’s a nice shade of blue, certainly nicer than the moldy-concrete-gray color the house’s previous owner picked. “I don’t know,” Dean says. He points to a color two shades down, this one just a little brighter, a bit more saturated. “I think I like this one…” He moves Castiel’s thumb from over the color’s name, grimacing when he sees what it’s called. Well, then.
“It’s harder to appreciate a gift when I have no one to direct my appreciation towards, and I keep worrying Lucifer Charleson is playing some cruel joke. How was your date?”
“So…” Dean says, drumming his fingers against his terrycloth covered thigh, “does this make you a fan?”
Castiel frowns, finally looking at Claire. “I’m sorry it’s been taking so long for us to leave, Claire. The court stuff took longer than I thought, and… I’m sorry.”
When they get back to the apartment building, Dean fetches a hand truck from the maintenance closet, which makes the shelves, chairs, and other bits far easier to move. The sofa takes some work, but Dean is very strong, and the two of them are able to get it into the apartment. Claire is nowhere to be seen, but it looks like she’s unpacked a few boxes.
Every other person Castiel’s seen in this building has been dressed like Castiel; business casual to business formal. But this man… this man has lime green nail polish on his toes.
The time before that was eleven months ago. The garage Dean was working at had folded, and Tessa had decided Dean should take an empty customer service job at her father’s company. Dean wasn’t into it, Tessa was insulted, and after a week sleeping alone on the couch Dean took the damn job.
boring. My bosses now are annoying, invasive brats, but I’d say it adds spice. I’m building friendships here, rediscovering old interests. Dean or no Dean, I like this life that I have now, Claire, and watching you blossom and improve so much in just a few months has been one of the greatest joys of my entire life.”
Dean’s not sure how he’s going to get out of this one. Things have been stale and strained for weeks,
“I’d still enjoy this more if they weren’t here,” Dean says, sighing as a deer emerges from the forest and starts walking closer, sniffing curiously at a nearby tree. Dean understands that; most of the trees in the forest are dull and dormant for the approaching winter, but the ones surrounding the house are much more alive.
Castiel hears the door close, and then Claire yelling “OH MY GOD KAIA KILL ME NOW JUST KILL ME RIGHT THE FUCK NOW” before their conversation slips down to a less audible level.
“Do you know how many dates I’ve gone on in the past several weeks, hoping one of them would make me feel a
“The thing is, sweetheart… staying with someone out of obligation, that’s not going to lead to happiness.”
Castiel gets under the sleeping bag with Dean, and Dean scoots to the side so they can share the duffel bag “pillow”.
“She gave me a pretty extensive list… places that cost less while you’re finding work, support groups, stuff like that. I have a really good feeling about Jasperville.”
“I should have napped before I left for the bus. I wasn’t even doing anything, just flopped over on my bed watching Frasier in my underwear.” Why did he bring up being in his
my boyfriend’s fucking father about that, thanks,” Dean says, oddly fearful as the sound of Castiel’s voice grows. “You going to send me back?”
Dean grins, relaxing in his seat and doing a little fist pump. Two teenage boys are giving him odd looks while they drink their giant cups of soda, but Dean doesn’t care.
Dean’s trying to look passive, but Castiel can see the trepidation there. He understands. It’s hard to be the first one to say it; Dean is a much braver man than Castiel.
Dean listens for the sound of Castiel’s office door opening and closing, but no sound comes. He sighs, frowning down at the congealing pot of macaroni and cheese. Good macaroni and cheese, with real cheese and cut up hot dogs and everything. Dean bought
Except Dean did tell Benny to take the couch, but Benny has a bad back, he shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor. Nothing hinky there.
“Yes, I guess we are.” Castiel’s scowling like a child, which makes Dean feel better about how petty he’s being himself. “I…” Castiel looks away. “I saw Tessa a few days ago. She asked me if I had seen you.”
and Castiel has given up all hope of following whatever it is that’s happening. Dean looks at Claire, who is still quite bare-chested but has at least stopped screaming. He opens his mouth, a confused look on his face, then closes it and looks down to where Castiel is still on the floor.
“Maybe,” Castiel says, shrugging. “But I did want it to be special. I don’t need fireworks, but I’d like to be fully aware of the act. I was in my house for fifteen minutes before I realized what I’d done.”
Castiel lets out a confused and startled laugh as his tattoos start to glow. “You are very sensitive, aren’t you?”
good feeling about Gadreel, but…” Hannah sighs. “He’s a big fan of that show Dexter, and he wanted me to role play as— you know what? It’s not important.”
“Sam said he’s working on the free apartment, try this one,” Claire says, pointing to the button labeled “H. Spangler & E. Zeddmore”.
“He said it was time for us to let you live your lives, even if that meant standing by if those lives came to a premature end. I honestly didn’t agree, but my kind are forbidden to meddle.”
in California,” Claire says, because Castiel apparently raised her with no manners. Their waiter bursts into startled laughter, loud, warm, and turning a few heads.
“I really do apologize for the commotion,” Castiel says, setting the pile of discarded clothes by the doorway, “I didn’t think you’d be back last night. You said not to wait up.”
for this. Castiel loves his macaroni and cheese. But apparently it’s not enough to lure him out of his office. He’s been working non-stop on his new series, and Dean feels like the only time he sees the guy is when he wakes up in the morning to go open the store, and Castiel is always asleep. They share a house, but Dean’s pretty sure they haven’t had a real conversation in two weeks.
Later, another time, Castiel will take Dean as Dean had him last night; fast, hard, sinful. For now, though, he’d rather be like this.
“I’m not trying to like… freak you out or anything, I just need you to know that you didn’t fail me— you helped save me.”
Dean gets that faraway look as he often does, a look Castiel finally understands. Castiel nudges him with his foot.
“You really do inspire me,” Castiel mutters, sleepy. The heat isn’t on in this room, and the chill is about the only thing keeping him awake right now.
Lunch is pleasant. Dean talks about how he’ll be able to tackle most of the stuff on his list today and tomorrow, but some of the bigger things will have to wait.
Before Dean knows it, he’s got Castiel strapped in the passenger seat and he’s pulling away from the bar. At least he knows where he’s headed. It’s pretty dark inside the car, but that doesn’t stop Castiel from attempting to rifle through Dean’s glove compartment.
“This one is called ‘Rest Assured’,” Castiel says as Dean approaches. He points to a shade of blue on the center of one of the swatches. “What do you think?”
From Cas - 8/14/17 - 11:14am: Believe it or not, laying around my sister’s house all day isn’t very fulfilling.
Dean chooses a motel far away from Castiel’s neighborhood, far away from his own neighborhood, the Palm Motel. It’s not the nicest motel, but there are no bed bug related reviews on Yelp, which means it’s good enough for Dean. He tosses his bag of clothes on the floor, sets the duffel containing his other shit on the table, and goes right to sleep.
“I have no earthly idea. She told me to pick her up at seven, and to dress sexy. How do I dress sexy? How did you dress on your date?”
“Har fucking har,” Dean says. “It’s a double date. This girl Sam asked out would only go if they could double with her
Dean doesn’t say anything, but Castiel can feel the responding grin against the skin of his shoulder.
“So, uh…” Castiel’s voice is loud, now, urgent and demanding as Dean fumbles for something to say to bring closure to this clusterfuck of a chat. “Do I have your approval?”
Castiel nods like this is a regular conversation or something. “Ah, I have brothers as well. Well, step-brothers, but we grew up together. One lives here, the other lives in California… then I have a sister, she lives here. My fathers live here as well.”
There were hundreds of packages on the plane, but only fourteen of them ended up with Dean on the island. Several were useless; divorce papers that would never get delivered, obliterated champagne glasses that probably wouldn’t have survived their trip to the states anyway, an MP3 player. Some things had their uses, though. The ice skates proved invaluable. The white terrycloth robe got filthy beyond belief in a short time, but it provided Dean with comfort. The chessboard… the chessboard was something to futz with, but Dean had never learned to play chess. He played against himself with made up rules, which was entertaining, but he often wondered if it was fast-tracking his emotional and mental deterioration.
What Dean wants to do is drive to Lawrence, get drunk with his brother, then see if his mother is in town so he can cry all over her without feeling judged. But all that means talking about what’s going on with Tessa, and Dean’s not really in the mood for that. Plus Dean’s mother never seems to be home when he comes looking. She’d be there if she knew Dean’s life was falling apart a little, but… then he’d have to tell her his life is falling apart a little.
Castiel is gone a long time. Dean fixes and cleans the gutters, confirms there’s a small hole in the roof, then patches the hole with materials he brought from home. In all that time, Castiel doesn’t come back. Dean’s taking a break on the couch when Castiel finally returns, and Dean sees why he was so busy.
Dean’s lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling and frowning as he replays his first date with Castiel over and over.
Dean is just deciding on whether any part of the damn bike is worth salvaging when Castiel comes out the front door. He looks slightly more put together, but still tired. Castiel can’t have been sleeping more than two hours.
“Welcome,” the man says, voice magnanimous as though Dean should be impressed with the fucking ice-cold cave they’re in.
Dean startles, looking down at their pool table. There’s three fewer balls on the green, when did that happen? “Bathroom, Vic can take my place,” he says curtly, handing his cue to Victor before making a beeline for the bathroom. Dean doesn’t actually have to pee, but once he’s out of the pool table’s line of sight he does creep closer to where Castiel’s dancing.
“Eat me,” Dean hisses. He can’t help but stare, though. Those are two really good looking dudes. Castiel glances in their direction as they pass, and Dean feels his insides do some weird god damn shit when they make eye contact. Castiel seems to slow, but maybe that’s just in Dean’s head. Then he hears it.
Dean lets out a soft, happy little hum at that, then Castiel feels Sugar being lifted off his stomach, and after a moment he hears the door to the bedroom close.
“Ain’t it? Last marriage barely cracked the one year mark. Can’t complain, though. Got the pipsqueak after all.” Mr. Charleson sighs happily. “Anyway, I was looking over your resume, and… you seem a bit overqualified for this job. This is a glorified assistant position… it seems, I don’t know… beneath you?”
Castiel shakes his head. “I don’t want to risk it. Besides, even if he did… people break up, and… and—”
in pleasure; Dean’s already wishing he had something to record the beautiful sounds he makes, the sinuous way his body moves between Dean and the shower wall. Dean finds himself sucking a bruise low on Castiel’s neck, and judging by the sounds Castiel makes, he’s into it.
Castiel frowns. “I suppose that depends on your definition of troubling. I certainly don’t have a criminal past, if that’s what you mean.”
“Who… who told.... fucking damn it, I really fucking miss the timid, terrified interns, you know that?” Lucifer storms away, continuing to rant as he goes.
Castiel looks amused, which means Dean’s about to eat his words. “A game? And what, exactly, is football?”
“Hey.” Claire is sitting next to him, Castiel has no idea when that happened. “It’s okay, Dad. It’s me, a kindly bisexual trans girl from Illinois. You don’t have to be scared.”
Castiel practically purrs, draping himself over Dean so he can whisper in Dean’s ear. “This moment is important, Dean, I want to savor it. Maybe we’ll have one night together, maybe thousands, but this will always be…” Castiel bites down on Dean’s ear lobe as he pushes the head of his cock past Dean’s rim.
To Cas - 9/01/17 - 5:36pm: you’re in luck, i happen to have just gotten cancelled on by my friend benny. his ex is in town, blah blah
Chuck’s shoulders sag in relief and he disappears back into his apartment. Castiel pulls his door closed behind him and sinks to the floor, leaning against it for support as he stares at Dean’s open door. His heart is still hammering away as he listens to Sam and Dean.
There's a moment at the end where Dean feels like maybe they should be exchanging phone numbers, or whatever it is new friends do after a pleasant interaction, but he’s not really sure Castiel’s a friend, and Tessa would hate it anyway. For his part Castiel doesn’t ask, just thanks Dean for a lively conversation, and goes back to his table, where his dining companions are still seated and apparently thumb wrestling with a disproportionate amount of passion.
Jesus fucking Christ, this guy is precious. “A raid, huh? You gonna take down the big boss and kick his ass with your uh… troll… magic…?” Dean tries.
“In the interview, you failed to mention that the four of you would be betting on whether or not I’m gay.”
“Of course not. Those gossiping fishwives will be insufferable when they find out you like someone.”
“Uh, anyway… within months I had nothing left to learn about the... the island, nothing left to explore, nothing to do; just killing crabs with a spear I made from an ice skate, fucking around with the few treasures and knickknacks and chess pieces from the packages I’d opened, and finding things to burn. I held onto it after I got rescued, because it was
“I take it Mick’s freebie list is just a paper with ‘Flo from Progressive’ written on it,” Dean says, grinning over at Mick, who shrugs.
Sam pauses in cleaning, looking up at Dean with too-keen eyes. Dean knows he’s looking at Dean, wondering just what, or
Dean will definitely take the out. He types a quick goodbye to Charlie and Mick, then closes his game. “Alright, but you’re buying.”
“So? So am I. He’s my ‘if I had to pick a guy’. No sex though, not even for Castiel Novak. But you know. I’d make out with him. A lot.”
“I take it you kept that info to yourself, since I didn’t have any visitors coming to make me eat vegetables and get some fresh air.”
“Hey, Dad!” Claire says, not looking away from the screen. “Hope it’s okay to have people over, kinda thought you’d be out longer.” Claire grimaces. “That came out wrong.”
“We don’t all know each other, you realize. There are hundreds of television shows in this country alone. But… yes, I did meet him once. We presented an award together at the Teen Choice Awards several years ago.”
Castiel nods slowly. He’s looking at Dean with something Dean can’t really put a name to, but he likes it. “In that case, let’s go get some dinner, Dean.”
“Beef stew. Not sure if that’s good date food, but it’s been in the slow cooker all day, getting warm and tasty.”
“I can see that,” Claire says, taking the pan off the stove and dumping the eggs in the trash. “Didn’t they make you take home-ec in high school?”
“Whatever you’re attempting to ask,” Castiel says, teeth nipping at Dean’s lower lip, “the answer is yes.”
Meg directs Castiel to drive to a lovely and overpriced French bistro a handful of miles away. She reminds Castiel that dinner is on her, then says “But if you get lobster, you have to put out.”
Here, Castiel wilts, posture deflating slightly as he awkwardly shifts a few inches away from Dean. An emissary for Death itself, shying away in embarrassment.
Castiel lets out a sharp laugh, face splitting into a grin that’s gummy and adorable. Damn it. “Yes, yes it is,” Castiel says, nodding enthusiastically.
Dean huffs out a small laugh. “Sparkle Junction is what happens when a nightclub, a strip club, and a rave get smashed into one place. I went from bowling a decent game with my kid brother to a damn
“I apologize, it’s really none of my business. I’m just here to see my brother, but if he’s occupied…”
“Right now, not really, it’s hard to picture. But that’s because I quit my job and things with Tess are a damn nightmare.”
The night ends in a slumber party, or whatever one would call five men in their mid to late thirties hanging out all night. Slumber party sounds a little like they’re a gaggle of teens braiding hair and trading Pokémon cards.
After the disastrous dinner with Castiel’s brothers they drove around and chatted for two hours. Dean showed Castiel where he lives, his old school, random shit like that. Then, Dean brought Castiel back to the Novak house, and Castiel promised to bring pie to the library tomorrow. Then, Castiel gave Dean a quick peck on the lips before got out of the car. After that, Dean drove home and took out the trash, did some dishes, and got in bed.
“Sorry to ruin your morning after bubble,” Hannah says with a yawn, “but I’ve got brunch with Hester, Benjamin, and Ambriel... and that means coffee.”
Wednesday is fairly busy. The biggest activity of the day is getting Claire registered at Jasperville High School, but there’s also trips to the local bank, three different counseling centers, the DMV, the grocery store, and a print shop for Castiel’s slightly updated resume.
Castiel glances to where Sam is swapping nametags with a blonde waitress. “Uh, I don’t think he’s quite my type.”
, but I certainly did not get the promotion. There was no staying together after that. He was apologetic, he said he got carried away, and… I feel like it was a sincere apology, but... it was such an ugly thing to do to a loved one, I couldn’t even look him in the face. I mean how am I supposed to trust someone like that?” Castiel shrugs and sighs. “Anyway, the friends I thought would be on my side turned out to be offended that I wouldn’t take him back, that I was willing to throw away three years over a ‘mistake’. I suppose I can’t blame them, they were his friends first. It hurt though.”
“I’ll give you four. I don’t want to hear you and your girlfriend having sex. I don’t want you to scream at me every time I walk through the house with shoes on. I don’t want to run into any of my exes while I’m slowly being dumped by my girlfriend. I don’t want to get a side eye from you if I feel like having pizza for breakfast.”
When Dean comes in through the back door, Castiel is seated at the kitchen table, clutching a cup of coffee tighter than Dean held onto that damn life raft in the ocean. His hair is in disarray, there are dark circles under his eyes, and he doesn’t seem to have noticed Dean walking in and standing next to him.
Castiel smiles, trailing his fingers up Dean’s sides and tickling. Dean yelps, rolling off of Castiel.
“I work in my sister’s stationery store. She’s eight months pregnant, so her attendance is… spotty at present. Some days I rather unexpectedly have to open and close.”
“I’ve had acting jobs before Halo Project, but this was my first starring role. I was in every episode, filming more than at least half the cast. It was… my show. Our show. And now that’s over, because I’ve gotten too old, because my character has grown stale. I thought of the show as my home for so long I suppose I forgot it was a business.”
“Then we tried it alphabetically, so it was the Agender-Asexual-Bisexual-Gay-Heterosexual-Lesbian-Pansexual-Transgender Alliance.”
“If you asked me at the time if they were all bad, if they all deserved to die, I’d have said yes. They were shooting at us, they were dangerous… but looking back, I gotta wonder how many really did have it coming.”
Castiel looks at the GPS on his phone, then back toward the street sign they just passed. “You missed the turn.”
“Done already?” Dean says, surprised. He figured he’d be in here watching Netflix on his phone for hours, maybe even pass out before Castiel came in to sleep.
of great ideas. I’m not gonna look down on them just because they didn’t worship me or my absentee dad. And I
Sam and Claire spend a few minutes working mousse into Castiel’s hair, twisting and smoothing until they’re both satisfied. Claire beams proudly when they’re done and snaps a photo with her phone.
friends first and foremost. Lines drawn in the sand, betrayed feelings, it was all very high school. It’s fine, this was over a year ago, I just haven’t really made new friends since. Except you, of course.”
The first thing Dean does is unclog the drain in Castiel’s bathroom sink. It’s a stubborn clog, but easily remedied with the heavy duty drain snake Castiel bought. There’s a lot of noise when working the apparatus, but it goes relatively quickly.
Claire smiles around a mouthful of pepperoni and cheese. “I can totally see you running a tea shop.”
Dean changes his clothes seven times on Saturday morning. Nothing seems right. What the hell does someone wear to meet their friend’s six year old niece?
“Looks good, huh?” Dean stands and sets a spoon on the desk. “I’m gonna head out, gotta pick up more potatoes.”
The apartment is fairly empty, save for a large, open toolbox and a short step ladder with a fluffy white cat curled up on the top step. The windows are open, probably to air out the scent of drying paint, and it looks like Dean is in the middle of ripping out the carpet.
. Either way, Dean’s noisier than he can ever remember being in bed, and he doesn’t have the focus to try to chill out. There’s a small crick forming in Dean’s back, but he doesn’t want to change positions, he doesn’t want to stop
Dean comes then, cursing and moaning into the side of Castiel’s face. That happened a little sooner than expected. It doesn’t matter though, because within seconds Castiel is chanting Dean’s name, voice pitching just a little higher each time he says it.
“I think we’re ‘bout to see Tessa and Dean fight over who gets to have a shot at him,” Ash says, taking a pull from a drink so purple it seems to be glowing.
“Hard to say no when you touch me like that,” Dean says, lifting his hips slightly and whining when Castiel pulls his hand away.
Castiel looks back at Dean, the arch of his eyebrow plainly visible in the glow from the porchlight. “That’s it?”
“Don’t even worry, we’ll clean up what we can and spill some coke on your clothes or something. People will just think you’re a klutz.”
“I know my couch is not the most comfortable, but surely it’s more comfortable than this,” Castiel says, voice bone-dry.
Castiel shakes his head. “I am not Pastor Raphael, I believe in a benevolent and loving God. I don’t think he would make you as you are and then punish you for it.”
As soon as Castiel closes the door to his apartment, he hears “DAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!” coming from Claire’s room. He makes a beeline for her open door. She’s perched on her bed, surrounded by several open binders and text books.
“She swears I can just come in my normal clothes. I think I’m going to have to wear glowsticks though.”
God, Dean fucking forgot about that. “Well… well I guess we’re even then!” he stammers, embarrassed.
Castiel sits back at his desk, unlidding the soup and eating a spoonful. It’s delicious, of course; warm and creamy, comforting; a baked potato in soup form. Castiel has a sandwich from the deli waiting for him in the breakroom fridge, but there’s no way it’s as good as this. He spends three minutes eating soup and not at all thinking about Dean Winchester before he sighs, places the lid back over his half-eaten soup, and walks over to Hannah’s desk.
“You know, that Italian restaurant down the road from the station is hiring busboys,” Victor says offhandedly.
In his brief time at the Charleson Firm, Castiel has learned a few things about the partners. Michael is stern and impatient, Raphael is blunt and unforgiving, Gabriel is energetic and chaotic, and Lucifer is a horrific combination of all of those things. Castiel doesn’t at all enjoy their company aside from Gabriel, so when he realizes Lucifer is lurking behind his chair during lunch, it takes everything in him not to turn around and throw something at him.
“I think so. Maybe. I hate to close any doors for good. I certainly don’t want to be one of those actors that makes a big deal about getting out of acting and then a year later they’re back booking jobs.”
Castiel smiles. “We’ll have to get some pictures taken then, because I refuse to live in a home that’s devoid of family photos.”
insufferable. Then there’s Malachai, who apparently strongly opposes same sex relationships and has been giving Castiel the hairy eyeball all day. People have been congratulating Castiel all day as well, which is somehow even less fun to deal with than Malachai’s festering homophobia. In the afternoon, Castiel texts Meg to say that he’s going to burn his office building “to the fucking ground”, not realizing he actually texted Claire until she responds to tell Castiel that his salty language is not a good example to set for today’s youth.
. Fuck. Castiel doesn’t seem to have noticed Dean, which leaves Dean plenty of time to do the adult thing: abandon his cart and go to another market twelve miles away.
He hasn’t stopped thinking about the kiss, though the memory has been examined both positively and negatively so many times that Dean’s not even sure he remembers it correctly anymore.
Dean finds his way into the kitchen while Castiel moves to what Dean assumes is his bedroom to continue the call.
Dean shrugs. “I mean the p-plane crash was hard, but it’s not like I had to battle wild tigers or anything.”
an arrangement Dean doesn’t love. Bringing Baby up to the house just isn’t possible, so instead she’s miles away, unattended and tucked into subspace or an extra dimension or whatever. The cloaking can only be removed by Castiel, but they’re attached at the hip anyway so that part doesn’t matter. But now Dean goes
Instead, Dean’s just looking at the server’s retreating form. “She forgot to take our drink orders, man.”
then. I’ve been with your mother just over half my life, and… that’s a long time. A long time to be with someone and then no longer have them in your life.”
“No, you’re just… part of a situation of my own making,” Dean says. “I mean I want to blame you, Cas. I really, really, really,
“I apologize, Dean, I got carried away on a web search, and I just... I’ve never read anything you wrote before, and I got so terribly curious.”
Nothing’s set in stone, Dean knows that. This thing with Castiel, though, feels a lot like what Dean always imagined
“That’s sweet. Yeah, Sammy could fuck up a lot and I’d forgive him for most of it. Aside from a handful of cousins in Michigan, he’s my only blood relative left. Got a bit of a surrogate family, though, so it’s not like I’m alone in the world. My ‘Uncle’ Bobby always says that family don’t end in blood.”
“What I’m saying is… if you’re ever willing… I mean it’d be cool to still hang out. Even when I’m in Lawrence. It’s not
Impala67: look it’s a delicate friendship... when things are more solid, I’ll see if he’s open to you slobbering all over him and asking for his autograph
“Darryl Eugene Strawberry, former baseball legend, current anti-addiction minister, three hundred thirty-five home runs, mess of drug charges, three marriages… yeah, I remember him.”
Dean groans. “Right. Okay, well… no t-shirts, I know that. And Sam practically cried when I showed up and he saw my jeans, so don’t wear pants with holes in them… I don’t know what else, man, I usually just show up in whatever.”
Dean glances at Sam, who still looks determined, but increasingly exhausted. “Then… then I’m happy for you, Cas.”
Dean doesn’t really get anything different than he would normally get, a couple of pairs of jeans, some t-shirts that are on sale, a couple of henleys, a pair of boots, some boxers, boxer-briefs, socks, a few plaid shirts… it ends up costing quite a bit and Sam is
Dean has to admit, that was the good thing about the divorce. He and Sam spent the rest of their childhood going between two homes, but the yelling stopped. Seeing his mother crying, that stopped too.
It’s when Sam is digging the grave for the mass of beheaded vampires that Dean finally senses another presence.
Half of what he’s brainstorming is for Sheriffs Hunting Evil book twelve, half of it is for the first book of what will be a companion series. Castiel hasn’t settled on a title for the series yet… he likes Wandering Daughters, but he’s not sure.
Dean’s sitting on the couch, staring at the battered and filthy package resting on top of his packed duffel bag. It’s faded in places, scratched and bent in others, and there’s a few drops of blood on the side from the day Dean opened the package that had the ice skates and got too overzealous fashioning them into weapons. There’s a slightly faded decal on the box that survived falling into the ocean and a buttload of direct sun exposure, a dove carrying an olive branch.
Dean’s not all that surprised to hear the back door open less than a minute later. Castiel approaches Dean cautiously, blanket slung around his shoulders. He’s wearing pajamas. Honest to goodness matching pajamas, like Dean used to wear when he was a kid. They’re probably flannel and comfy. He stands next to where Dean’s still lying on the ground. Dean half expects to look at Castiel’s feet and see big fluffy bunny slippers, but he just sees bare toes clenching in the grass.
Castiel, still half dressed and probably in need of some hand washing just like Dean, reaches for his notebook and pen. “We’re professionals, Dean. We get back to work.”
Still, Castiel’s heart beats harder while Dean manhandles him into position, while he trails kisses up Castiel’s chest and neck. He’s never had
Castiel’s still not making eye contact, but Dean can see the little smile forming. “You know, for a man that just compared writer’s block to delayed ejaculation, you have an absolutely wonderful way with words.”
He doesn’t realize he’s drifted until he wakes, still naked, Dean snoring gently on top of him. It’s been over a year since Castiel last had sex, but he doesn’t remember ever passing out quite so easily before.
Dean’s staring at Castiel’s mouth, so Castiel nods enthusiastically. Within seconds Dean’s back in Castiel’s space, and they’re back on the couch, back to kissing. This time Dean’s shirt is already off, so when he crawls over Castiel, Castiel lets his hands trail up his back, feeling the raised edges of his scars. The small, shuddering gasps Dean makes as he does so are like music. The urgency from before trickles back in easily. Castiel doesn’t know how far he’s ready to go, just that he hasn’t reached his limit yet.
“Yeah, but… sometimes people are… weird about this shit, Sam. Some people are cool with gay women but not gay guys… some people think bisexuality is like… made up.”
Yeah, that’s an eyecatcher for sure. Dean’s more comfortable in long sleeves when he’s out of the house; a henley, or his father’s leather jacket, but he’s gotten so comfortable here he forgot to even worry about hiding it. He wonders if Castiel will say something. He knows it’s upsetting to see, Sam even cried at the sight of it one night, but he was pretty drunk.
Dean’s never been to Pumpkin Grand, partly because he already has a bar he likes, and partly because of the dumb name. It sounds like a candy bar or a bakery, not a “nice” bar. They have to park two blocks away, and there’s a line to get in. A
“I was thinking it would be cheaper… we might not find a place in Jasperville right away, which would mean staying in motels… which would eat up my savings…”
“Sweet talker,” Dean says. He slaps Castiel’s backside and Castiel jumps, turning to glare at Dean’s downright
Dean’s wearing them the Saturday Castiel comes home from a long lunch with his agent, looking troubled.
At the end of the meal Dean pays, claiming he owes Castiel for eating the last raspberry creme out of that box of chocolates. A bit silly, but Castiel can go along with it.
Dean’s been sprawled out on the couch, mostly glaring at the blank document on the laptop he has sitting on the coffee table, but this grabs his attention enough for him to sit up. “Really?”
“Yes, I’m willing to come back to do a few episodes, but not an entire twenty-two episode season… or half season in this case.”
“I haven’t in eons, it’s been a busy and chaotic year. I don’t even have the supplies for it… but I do love knitting.”
Dean stares at Castiel’s mouth for a moment. “Man, I bet you’re a fucking nightmare when you have the flu.” He kisses the top of Castiel’s hair and heads out.
“He reached out to me. And he must have thought I… if this was his only attempt, he must have thought...”
“So, not quite as fast as ol’ Strawberry, huh?” Dean says as they both sit awkwardly on the couch. It’s time for the real world to come back, loathe as he is to admit it. They still have a script to write, a show to do, a meeting with Bobby in the morning.
“Guess I have to make an official ‘no sex in the elevator’ rule in the rental agreement, fucking Christ.”
,” Castiel says, “it just came so naturally at the moment, and I... I feel like we skipped something important there.”
and you let Jo name five from Avengers!” Dean grouses. “Okay Morena Baccarin, Gina Torres…” Dean pauses, because he really
“Don’t get him anything too fancy… he gets real awkward about it. Aim for thoughtful over impressive.”
The more Castiel’s tongue rubs against his, the more Dean wants to get his pants all the way off so he can spread his legs wide, let Castiel right in. He can’t though, not without stopping to take his boots off, and that sounds like something that would take far too long. So he rocks up against Castiel, and Castiel does the same, still kissing Dean, making all sorts of incredible soft grunts and groans as they move together. Fuck it’s good, it’s so good, but Dean wants just a little more. He reaches down, making sure not to break their kiss, and he wraps a hand around them both, holding their cocks together tight.
Castiel actually feels an emotional lump form in his throat at that. It’s a beautiful sentiment, really.
Castiel lifts Dean onto his kitchen counter, settling between Dean’s open legs and sliding his tongue in Dean’s mouth. Dean drapes his arms over Castiel’s shoulders, unaware that his robe has fallen open until he feels the slide of Castiel’s hands against his sides. His hands move slowly along the bare skin of Dean’s back and he shudders, gasping into Castiel’s mouth. His legs wrap around Castiel’s waist, bringing them closer together, and Castiel groans, rocking his hips forward just slightly, just enough for Dean to feel him, feel how hard he’s getting.
Castiel actually seems to be considering this. “I suppose if she were already undressed and sufficiently lubricated…”
“So, is Dean home?” Castiel says, trying and failing to sound casual. More ridiculousness; everyone knows about he and Dean anyway.
Dean is crouched by his linen-wrapped body, feeling a mixture of fascination and mourning. Maybe he does, just a little, wish he could have gotten to live longer. Maybe he would have kept hunting until his body refused to comply, or maybe he’d have found a way to have his dream bar, or maybe he would have had a family.
Dean nods sadly. “Yeah, I know. I think… I know I stayed in this for all the wrong reasons, and that wasn’t fair to you.”
“Well… I feel okay right now, but sometimes I kind of… crash after too much social shit, so we’ll see. Don’t worry, though. I’ve got my handy mobile pharmacy in my bag,” Dean says, grinning.
Despite what various lore says, Castiel is beginning to wonder if Barachiel is actually the archangel of petulance.
He spends his shift having an internal debate over his various gift ideas. It leaves him distracted to the point of incompetence several times. A few hours after lunch, Lucifer storms up to Castiel’s desk, slamming down a stapled set of papers on top of Castiel’s keyboard.
Tessa stops talking suddenly, and at first Dean thinks he maybe missed a question, but Tessa is staring past him, a frown on her face. Dean looks over his shoulder, and
Castiel runs a thumb along the jagged scar. “Please don’t think you have to justify yourself to me, Dean. I know what… I know what it feels like to feel like you have no other options.”
If he didn’t wake up next to a clingy unconscious octopus of a man every morning, Dean would be certain Castiel had actually died days ago.
orange,” Dean says, flicking a finger against the offensively orange boxer briefs clinging to Castiel’s hips. “What do you call this color?”
I am so sorry. Oh fuck.” He slaps a room key down on the counter. “Please, just… take it. Free of charge.”
Castiel takes his shirt off, and when Dean turns back around he’s holding three ties. Castiel is shocked, he had no idea Dean actually
Castiel, as it turns out, has a god damn impeccable poker face when he wants to. In fact, by the time midnight rolls around, he’s up two hundred dollars and so smug about it Dean’s not sure if he wants to punch him or kiss him.
any of them, so what is he doing? He can sit around in Sam’s living room just as well as he can here, and it won’t cost him sixty dollars a night. Plus, Benny and Garth are in Lawrence, they’d probably love to get him drunk.
Dean’s never lived with a romantic partner before. Things never quite got to that level with his other exes, except with Pamela, but Pamela kept putting things off, then she cheated on Dean with her ex, then she broke up with Dean. They’ve made their peace since then. Dean more or less forgave Pamela for cheating, Pamela more or less forgave Dean for burning her favorite leather jacket. They even talk if they spot each other when Dean’s in Lawrence. But, it’s fair to say that some of Dean’s insecurity and jealousy stems from that time of broken trust, years ago.
Henriksen glances at the clock that clearly shows they have fourteen minutes left, then back at Dean. “Good luck with your trip, Dean. Remember this office has an after hours line if you need anything, no matter what time of day.”
“Padded bra. When Muriel was still pre-surgery, pre-HRT… she loved her padded bras. But keep it tasteful, size wise, kiddo. And when you’re dating? Disclose safely. In public, or with a friend,
from the nearest school. What if you missed your bus and I was at work? How would you get to class?”
Castiel wakes alone in a comfortable bed. He hasn’t seen much of Dean’s room since he and Dean became acquainted, so he’s a bit surprised to be waking up in it. Dean must have carried Castiel in here after he fell asleep, which is… an appealing thought. He digs his phone out of the pocket of his slacks, noting that he managed to wake up five minutes before his alarm went off. He has a few texts from Claire that he missed last night, all of them about Claire wanting more mozzarella sticks. He smiles, shaking his head and pocketing his phone again as he takes in his surroundings. There are more of Dean’s paintings in here; a rosebush where each rose is painted with a palette one would more likely use for painting flames, snow falling on a desertscape, a koala playing a banjo. The eclectic mix of subjects makes Castiel feel warm.
The bike, as it turns out, is not actually fixable, not without getting several parts. Dean had been hoping he’d just have to deal with some rust and hammering out the bent wheel, but the thing is a mess of rust and whatever the hell damage was sustained when Castiel got hit by that car. A quick internet search on his phone tells Dean that the cost of fixing the bike will far outweigh the price of the bike itself. It sucks, but at least Castiel doesn’t
Castiel chuckles, rocking against Dean even though he can’t possibly get any deeper. His wings flex and fan out before curling forward and surrounding them, blocking Dean’s view.
“I’ll um… goodnight.” Castiel pats Dean on the shoulder and turns to go into his apartment, too terrified to see whatever expression might be on Dean’s face.
dress. We helped each other.” Jimmy starts trying to crack an egg on the rim of the pan, and Claire stops him.
Claire just grins. “I’m unpacking your room while you’re gone. Unless there’s stuff you don’t want to me to see.”
looks good. This is something Castiel has been aware of since they met, and yet it feels like somehow he’s just now realizing it.
” Castiel says, finally getting it. He reaches for a slice of bacon and makes a disappointed sound when Dean shoos his hand away.“As soon as possible? I realize there might be some things to work out now that I’m not
Castiel sighs into his coffee cup. He’s with Meg at her favorite cafe, and Castiel is completely unsurprised when the old woman at the next table gathers her things and moves to the other side of the room. Meg’s been going over the details of her relationship and breakup with Abaddon for over ten minutes, Castiel’s surprised she didn’t move sooner.
“I knew I was off the show, I knew that part of my life was now over… but seeing everyone and realizing they’re about to start filming, and I’m not… I worked with those people for eight years. It’s a lot to have change.” Castiel doesn’t sound drunk anymore, he just sounds sad.
Cas. I mean woodworking. It’s a good time-consuming, mind-numbing activity once you get used to it. Or Jo would teach you to play guitar…
He has a bag from a deli that Dean loves, but never goes to because their food is way overpriced. Fuck, he can’t wait.
“I’ve never felt like this before, Cas. I mean yeah I get all that cabin fever and gotta go out and hunt every few weeks, but this… I’m not used to feeling like this.”
“Sometimes I’m not sure that she and I really connected. I loved Amelia, of course, but I…. I’m not sure I would have married her if my mother hadn’t died. My mother
“Well, it’s movement. That’s good. More importantly, it’s movement spurred by your own decisions, so that’s
“What? No I— I did.” Castiel pulls over in the highway’s emergency parking lane, hands gripping the wheel tight as the car idles.
“I was just thinking about how you’ve completed your tasks here, and wondering what comes next, and I… I guess I wanted to see you.”
Dean is there, same old Dean. Same faded black Led Zeppelin t-shirt, same pair of dark blue jeans with a hole forming at the right knee, same devastating green eyes, but… no beard.
He gets to his feet and looks through the window frame just in time to see Castiel swing Sam’s old cast-iron pan through the visage of a very angry looking old man.
Castiel trails his fingers along a long, curving cut along Dean’s left side. “This was… what that man did to you?”
He runs for the front door, heart pounding, phone clutched in one hand. The first thing he notices when he opens the door is Chuck, who has the apartment next to Dean’s. Castiel doesn’t see Chuck all that often, he’s usually locked in his apartment writing and drinking. He looks at Castiel, face weary, tired. Castiel can smell the peach schnapps permeating Chuck’s ratty bathrobe from here. Chuck looks at the phone in Castiel’s hand and shakes his head.
“She said I could contact her for a… friend date sometime, so at least my social circle is expanding.”
Castiel spends the rest of the afternoon puttering around the apartment. He unpacks everything still in boxes and bags, does sniff tests on all his work-suitable clothing to make sure nothing needs washing, hangs his ties. His room finally looks lived in, though it could use some decorative personal touches. He wonders how amenable Claire would be to getting a family photo taken somewhere. Right now the only current photo he has of the two of them is a close-up of their smiling faces taken with his phone’s camera. Claire called it a “selfie”, but Castiel can’t bring himself to use that word.
The date with Ambriel is… nice. Castiel didn’t realize that she was only twenty-six when he asked her out, but the age difference is not an insurmountable obstacle… though they are both a little uncomfortable when Castiel tells her he has a daughter just nine years younger than her. It’s still nice, but Castiel’s not sure if there’s anything…
Dean’s not sure if Castiel means don’t stop fucking him, or don’t stop loving him, but either way he knows his answer.
He doesn’t know where to go. Lawrence feels more like home, but Dean’s still got a job, that’s not a good commute. Jo lives with her mom, Ash’s apartment always smells like old beer cans and pot smoke, Mick lives with god damn Ketch, Tessa is at Charlie’s, and Victor just flat out refuses to have guests over.
A lot of time passes between that day and the day they actually leave Pontiac. Paperwork is filed with the court for legal name changes, which takes time, newspaper notifications, meetings… but they’d both rather have their new identities
“That depends,” Castiel says, reaching forward to grab onto Dean’s ass, “what kind of pizza was it?”
Castiel refuses to look away from his grilled cheese sandwich for even a second, lest it burn. “That’s a character in Twilight, right?”
the ‘something in the air’ is probably in Dean’s head. They walk up to the house from the car, and Dean smiles when he puts his foot down on the second step and hears no creak.
Castiel stares, slack-jawed for a long moment. Neither his brain nor his groin is accepting that this moment isn’t going in the direction he thought it was, even as he hears the sound of Dean opening cabinets and drawers.
Castiel reaches out with an aborted movement, then drops his hand. He says nothing, so Dean continues.
and covered in cardboard imitations of candy canes and tree ornaments. There is a modest-sized live pine tree in one corner of the living room with an open box of ornaments next to it. Castiel’s bookshelves are covered in artificial poinsettias, his antique bookends, depicting various roman gods, are now wearing little red hats and scarves. It smells like gingerbread in here.
That’s when Castiel remembers a conversation he had with Dean two weekends ago. They were sitting on Dean’s couch, watching a movie that ended up being dull, and the two of them got to chatting instead of keeping up with the plot. Dean had been talking about making stew, and how he ought to get a slow cooker and see if it made his stews more tender and flavorful. When Castiel asked Dean why he didn’t already have one, Dean shrugged and said “You know what? I don’t know. I think about it once in a while, but haven’t actually tried to get one. I should look into that.”
He’s just decided to throw the food away and pretend he was never in here when two arms wrap around him from behind.
Mr. Charleson whistles. “Same here. Wouldn’t have it any other way. New wife’s a peach, too. Great with the kiddo, never throws dishes, and God
“No, Sugar,” Castiel says firmly. Sugar, of course, does not budge. Castiel tries to twist his body to the side to make her get up, but she just makes herself comfortable, purring softly as she curls up on Castiel’s stomach. He sighs, relaxing against the bed. Maybe he should just be grateful she doesn’t have her claws out.
Tessa is silent. Normally when she plays designated driver she makes a lot of jokes about crashing Dean’s beloved car, puts his radio on a country station, changes the angle of his seat and mirrors. Tonight she’s just driving, staring intently at the road.
The excursion to the mattress outlet is brief; Castiel knows exactly what he wants to get, though he’s delighted to see the mattress and boxspring sets are nearly one hundred dollars cheaper than at Crowley’s.
“I took my last breakup hard. Too hard. Almost ridiculously hard, I would say. It was frustrating because I wasn’t exactly irrevocably in love with him, and yet I was leveled by what happened between us. It didn’t make sense to me, all the moping I did over someone I probably would not have spent the rest of my life with. That’s when I went to my doctor, and said that I thought something might be wrong with me.”
“I realize this is going to feel condescending to you, and so I want to first assure you that it’s not.”
When he wakes up, they’re not holding hands anymore, but Castiel is lying on his side, watching him. There’s a lot of emotion in his eyes that Dean can’t decipher. He’s so fucking bad at reading people these days. He can still read Sam pretty well, but he had nearly twenty-six years to learn him. Castiel’s new, and Dean doesn’t “get” people like he used to. His eyes dart down for a split second, to Dean’s mouth, maybe.
“I’ll take it out in trade,” Tessa says with a wink. It’s a cute joke, but they haven’t had sex in… what, a month? But Dean smiles and plays along, because bitching about not getting any like some entitled punk isn’t going to do anyone any favors. “Just got off the phone with Ketch, he and Vic will meet us at Pumpkin Grand… I think they might pick up Ash.”
“Yeah, me too. Uh, so… uh, I’m calling because uh, we were supposed to uh, you know. Make plans. Uh for the work on your house? Unless you’re not into the idea anymore, because that’s cool too, I just wanted to ask, uh, just in case, no pressure.” Fuck, Dean’s never really been a “phone person”, but this is just pathetic.
“Okay, so… Castiel Novak,” Tessa says, leaning forward and away from Ketch, “Idris Elba… he’s number one. Number one, Dean. Dean, I’d drop you
“Just call him, Dean. If he doesn’t want to be friends, then you can deal with it and move on. Just get it over with now.”
“Uh… not much. Hadn’t seen you in a few days.” Dean looks timid, unsure. “Haven’t seen much of you in a while, really.”
“He might be… tempestuous, but he and my other brother and my sisters were there for me when my parents… and Gabriel were not, through some pretty hard times in my life. So, I can forgive him for probably messing up my door and then lying about it.”
“I uh…” Dean starts, smile slipping from his face entirely, “I don’t suppose you’re ready to talk about that yet…”
“Jack?” Dean asks. Castiel nods. “Must be nice to have friends in high places,” Dean adds, a little bitterly.
Which is why it catches him off guard when he walks into his small apartment on the afternoon of December twenty-fourth, to see that it is very, very much decorated for the holidays. There is rich green garland running along the edge of the ceiling of the kitchen and the living room, possibly into the other rooms as well, and that garland has silver and gold stars hung from it at even intervals. There are white icicle lights around the door frame and windows, cute snowmen magnets on the fridge, red ribbons tied on cabinet handles and table legs. The walls, which were definitely a mediocre shade of taupe when Castiel left this morning, are now
Dean’s expression is grim. “Been there too.” He looks a bit far away now, fingers absently stroking the cat’s belly.
It’s the first time either of them have said that name in ages… Castiel is surprised at how disconnected he feels from it.
“Maybe it just wasn’t there, Cas, it happens. I was with this girl Charlie long time ago… we made a lot of sense, looked great together, kind of balanced each other out personality wise, but god
Castiel’s a bit confused, but he presses on. “I really don’t know how this even happened. These feelings snuck up on me, and I ignored them at first because I didn’t really
after all, even if Dean only watches Halo Project when Tessa makes him. The writing on that show is… not great. Every time Dean watches there seems to be a new love triangle.
Claire and Castiel both yelp and jump back. The man in the doorway is tall, bearded, and frowning. He’s wearing a black and red checkered flannel shirt, blue jeans, and boots. He looks like someone Castiel would see if he typed “angry lumberjack” into Google’s image search function. All that’s missing is an ax or a chainsaw.
The one time he actually takes in his surroundings, he sees two older women gesturing emphatically at him from across the room at the bus station in Kansas City. Awesome. People recognizing him, just what he wants. They look like they’re considering coming over to talk to him, so Dean quickly pretends to take a call on his phone until the women lose interest.
“Don’t worry, Cas. I can keep a secret. Anyway, so your nose ain’t broken, but I want you to hold this here for ten minutes, then get one of the girls to bring you some Advil.”
“Sometimes I wish I could show you all that. I wish I had pictures. It’s weird, but…” Dean trails off, unsure of what to say next.
It’s bad enough he’s reading Dean’s stories without clearing it with him, surely Dean would have reservations about Castiel reading his
“No… and it was so long ago I probably wouldn’t recognize any of them on the street.” Except Gunner Lawless. That guy was built like a truck, fucked very much like an aging wrestler on steroids, and Dean couldn’t sit comfortably for a week.
“Dean is… gruff… but also very warm when he opens up. He’s a wonderful cook, a gifted painter… he loves his car. He’s kind, and shy...” Castiel finds himself staring off into space. “He has a lovely smile.”
Rachel smiles, patting Castiel on the shoulder. “Let’s just say if you’ve been wondering why this position comes with such great pay and benefits, you won’t be wondering that by the end of the day. Now, if they try to rope you into working for them in your off-shift time, tell them no. If they think you’ll be at their beck and call during non-work hours, they’ll be calling you at all times of the day making demands.”
“I’m allowed,” Castiel snaps, glaring and trying unsuccessfully to wrench his arm free. “May I have my arm back?”
Claire is still considering whether or not she’ll want to eventually tangle with things like hormones and surgeries, things to help her cope with what Jimmy’s read is called “gender dysphoria”. He’d tried reading up on the surgeries, but he got a bit overwhelmed and opted to worry about that later. Right now they can’t afford surgery anyway, and Claire decided she wanted to wait until her life was more settled before trying hormone replacement therapy that could throw her emotions into chaos. So, that’s all on the backburner. But what Jimmy
“No problem. I’m gonna head in now, Abaddon promised to break out the strap-on if I struck out tonight,” Meg says with a wink.
to reach you. Time passes differently in Hell, Dean... sometimes faster, sometimes slower, but never quite the same as here on Earth.” He sighs. “I was getting close to going down there myself to fetch you.”
but apparently not cold enough to dull Castiel’s erection. If some lost traveller or hungry deer were to wander by the door, they’d be able to see everything.
Then again, maybe he would have slipped on ice and cracked his head open when winter came this year.
“Love you Cas,” Dean whispers. Castiel has stopped moving, but Dean picks up the slack, holding onto Castiel’s hips and rocking up into him.
Dean has a witty retort at the ready, but then Castiel is getting a hand in the waistband of Dean’s sweatpants and the snappy comeback leaves his mind, pushed aside by anticipation.
Castiel fights the urge to back out right then and there. The woman that lived above them in their apartment in Pontiac had loud, frequent,
there it is. Castiel’s eyes light up as he pulls Dean into another kiss. “Say it again,” he whispers.
thing he does, and he’s missed a ton of work already. I’ll only be gone for two days, he’s mostly cool with it. He already gave me some money for the trip. I still don’t have much.” Dean’s been doing odd jobs he finds on Craigslist, but he hasn’t actually looked for gainful employment. Later. After Illinois. Probably not for a while, though.
“Damn, man. Damn. So,” he says, coming over and leaning against the back of the couch, “this whole camping outside your neighbor’s door thing… that something they just
Dean’s never actually seen Castiel fly yet, but he can imagine that looked fucking ridiculous. He’ll probably see him fly sometime soon, there’s no other way to get new furniture up here.
Castiel tilts his head to the side, brows furrowed. “You were so nervous when you arrived, and…” He gestures at Dean’s clothes. “This isn’t exactly you. Why try to impress a child?”
“That I’m still not sure of. Perhaps a show with a shorter filming season, I could see if any movies would have me, or I could stop acting altogether. When I was younger I wanted to be a florist.”
Dean pulls a sweater out of… nowhere. It’s not too bad, Castiel supposes. Bright red, white hems, a few snowflakes, snowy trees, and snowmen stitched on the front. At least there’s no patchwork. Castiel accepts the sweater, putting it on over his black t-shirt and waiting patiently when Dean decides it needs to be zipped up.
The stranger holding his future today is… peculiar. He’s the majority partner in the firm Castiel’s applying at, with a large office, imposing desk, high-backed chair… and he’s wearing cargo shorts. The feet he has propped up on his desk are bare. He’s drinking a
Castiel seems uncomfortable, so Dean fights the urge to giggle hysterically at the thought of this guy knocking on all his neighbors’ doors trying to fucking find him.
There’s a hitch in the soft, even breaths coming from next to him. Castiel doesn’t say anything, but his fingers cross the grassy space between them until he’s holding Dean’s hand, and they stay that way until Dean falls asleep.
“Don’t suppose you’re hungry,” Dean says, frowning at Tessa’s plate, then glancing over at Castiel’s table.
To Cas - 8/14/17 - 8:18am: and they wanted to make up for firing you so they had you playing three characters at once
Claire snorts, and Castiel glares at her before pressing and holding the button down. “Mr. Winchester?”
“Is this some sort of… office gift?” Castiel says to Hannah, who’s looking at his bear with a smile.
“It was horrific. I should have knocked. I just… assumed you were studying. Or talking. Or… not that.”
“I’m not saying it’s over, but… but I need a break. I need to rest, and sort myself out, and… I think we should take a break, see other people.”
not going to talk about Azazel. “I’m a human, so I think you can understand why I don’t want the approval of the fucking devil.”
By the time the evening rolls around, Sam has gone back to Lawrence, and Dean is back to watching cable. Now that he’s actually left the hotel for a couple hours, his room seems a lot more depressing than it did earlier. The palm tree wallpaper is faded and peeling, there’s a weird brown stain on the ceiling that looks too… viscous to be water damage, and the neighboring room has the volume on the television up high so Dean can hear the latest garbage FOX News anchors are spewing in perfect detail.
that, for fuck’s sake. There’s a bit of… yelling sometimes. Not often. And I’m just warning you because you’re going to be right across from me.”
Dean’s arms go around Castiel’s shoulders almost involuntarily. He groans, long and low at the slow, inexorable shove of Castiel into his body, toes curling as his voice cuts off on a high gasp when Castiel bottoms out.
“Did you say I was on your boyfriend’s freebie list?” Castiel says to Tessa. She’s blushing now, but she nods. “Ah, I see. That’s quite flattering, I should thank him. Is he here?”
this is not a good time for a fight. Everything will fall apart, like it did with Josie, and Pam, and Lisa back in Lawrence.
“I like how you taste,” Castiel says, words slurred just a little. Fuck, that’s a sexy fucking thing to say.
Dean drops the large mixing bowl he was holding, cursing when it lands in the dishwater and splashes his shirt. “A date, huh?” he says, dabbing his flannel with a kitchen towel. “You’re a hit already.”
still flinching, but Sam can’t see it, so he doesn’t have that kicked puppy look. It’s the easiest conversation they’ve had since Dean came back, and he thinks Sam knows it too.
. You know how Mom was about fast food. A few days or weeks of cheap food won’t kill us, I promise.”
“Cas, it’s okay, I’m okay. I promise, I was just kind of freaked out, that’s it. He didn’t hurt me. Or my soul,” Dean says emphatically.
Every time Castiel came in to the library and leaned a little too close as they talked. Every time he smiled at Dean. Every time he glanced up at Dean from behind the library’s giant illustrated copy of the Bhagavad Gita. Every time he'd said Dean’s fucking
“Yeah.” Dean doesn’t know why he’s telling this to a damn stranger. It’s easy, though. Easier than telling his friends and family that look at him with eyes full of pity, or Henriksen, who writes everything down because that’s his job. “But the package was more important. Anyway, I’ve been back a while now, and I figured I should bring this to the person it was meant for.”
Claire is gone, out with Kaia as she often is, so Castiel allows himself a moment to yell “UGH!” as loud as he can before pouring himself another drink, which he then drops as Meg suddenly bursts into his bedroom.
assistant. He’s to prioritize tasks by the rank of the person in need of assistance. If Castiel is filing five hundred documents for Naomi in legal and Michael Charleson wants a coffee from his favorite shop two miles away, Castiel is to drop everything and get Michael his coffee.
“Can we just... forget about Friday? The past few days have been miserable, and I miss you… can we forget about it?”
“I never wear these, it doesn’t matter if they get messy,” Dean says. Not totally true. He often wore these slacks to work, but he’s quit that job, so who cares if he gets glue or markers or whatever on them. “I just thought I should dress fancy to make a good impression.” Wow, why did he say that out loud?
Castiel looks down at the dish in his hands, frowning a little. “That was the ruse I had decided on, anyway.”
“That’s definitely true. Well if he does, no one’s going to care. Jo will swear she knew it, even if she didn’t, Vic and Ash will probably ask which of them you think is hotter, Mick will cry and hug you and tell you how proud he is of you, and that’ll be that.”
Lucifer’s eyes bulge, cheeks turning red almost immediately. Big Daddy Luci is what Lucifer made Meg call him during their night of passion.
Claire punches Castiel in the arm, as she has taken to doing when he accidentally misgenders or “deadnames” her. She said it was to create a negative association with her assigned gender and former name, but Castiel thinks it just makes her feel better.
like this vital piece of his origin story isn’t important information. “I just never brought it up.”
“When I was fourteen,” he says in between kisses, “I egged my math teacher’s house because he always pronounced my last name like ‘Weenchester’ no matter how many times I told him it was
“Yeah.” Claire pouts. “Anyway… sorry to pile on your date anxiety like that, sometimes I just get that… emotional diarrhea thing happening and it all comes spilling out.”
The door to 4F is slightly ajar, and Castiel reaches out to stop Claire just as she’s about to push it open.
Finally, on June sixteenth, James knocks on the door to Jimmy and Amelia’s bedroom and comes in, looking timid. Nervous. Jimmy sits up straighter in his bed, Amelia sets down her issue of Life & Style magazine.
“The neighborhood,” Castiel says, realizing a bit too late that the woman is flirting. “Uh… ah… not that you aren’t lovely, especially fresh off a jog you’re very… dry.”
“What?! She is?!” Dean stammers. It almost sounds like there’s an echo of his voice, that’s when he realizes Sam is in the kitchen too. “Jess is pregnant, Sam?”
Castiel makes some sort of grotesque growling burping sound, and Hannah rubs his back. “A few of his castmates blew into town this weekend, there was a lot of drinking. Our house looks like a bomb went off.”
This isn’t right, he knows. Devoting this much time to thinking of someone else. Walking on eggshells in a life he was building with someone. Obviously passion eventually burns away to something slower, more familiar, that happens in any relationship. But it’s never been like this, like Dean and his partner were struggling to act the part of two people in love. When Dean’s relationships died before, there was always a
Castiel huffs out a small laugh, resting his forehead against Dean’s. “In the interest of maintaining an equal footing, I should tell you that I cried watching How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.”
Castiel seems too shocked to do anything back, but Dean notes that time has started moving normally again. Sam is dragging Dean’s body to the pyre. It’s nearly time to go.
Dean covers his mouth with his fist. Castiel can’t tell if he’s horrified or if he’s about to laugh.
He scoots to the side, making room on the air mattress. It’s probably an awkward way to ask a question, but he’s not sure what will come out of his mouth if he tries talking again. When Castiel joins him, Dean’s entire body relaxes. Castiel lies on his back next to Dean, the air mattress dipping more with their combined weight.
“You do?” Dean asks, voice small. Castiel nods. Dean wants to ask, but he doesn’t. “It freaks me out, thinking how close I came to dying on that i-island. I never would have been found. No one would have ever even known that I survived the crash.” Dean shudders at the thought.
They walk out to the kitchen, which looks like it hasn’t been tended to yet. There’s dirt and discolored grout where the stove should be, and the fridge is in need of a good scrubbing.
Despite the awkward conversation, that statement has adrenaline rushing from Castiel’s chest to his toes.
The place isn’t too crowded, and Dean and Castiel opt to slide into opposite sides of a booth and spend a few minutes bickering over whether to get two small personal pizzas or one large pizza, then over which toppings to get when they decide on a single pizza.
“Well, it used to be very, very sad to have all that work be for naught. All the planning, and teamwork, and all that ending in a defeat was always a bit crushing. But that was back before I had a gorgeous boyfriend to soothe the ache.” Castiel sounds so smug, it’s kind of turning Dean on. Or maybe that’s the friction he’s feeling from Castiel grinding his hips down.
offended. “Good,” Castiel says, “I didn’t want to spend all night concerned over our budding friendship, I suppose.”
“You’ve come to the right man,” Dean says with a grin, “it just so happens I’ve spent a lot of years working in construction.”
The journey up the stairs takes a long time, there’s a lot of kissing and clothes shedding along the way. By the time they actually stagger into the guest room Castiel sleeps in, they’re both down to their underwear, and Dean’s only wearing one sock. Castiel is wearing long boxer briefs that are an absolutely eye-searing shade of orange, but Dean can barely speak let alone form a sentence that would enable him to give Castiel shit about them.
“I’m mostly over it. The loss of my friendships hurt more than the breakup. I really, really expected they’d be with me, and they weren’t. But… I mean I’m not
They’re parked on the side of the road, in front of a large wooden sign that’s been lacquered to Hell and back.
James flinches, and Jimmy desperately wants to understand why. “I thought about waiting until I was eighteen, but that’s like… nearly two more years of pretending that—” James sighs.
They kiss for another minute, maybe two, before someone in a passing car shouts “GET A ROOM, HORNDOGS!” and then they pull apart, panting.
They’ve finally come to a gap in the seemingly endless trees and the path that seemed to disappear entirely at times. It’s a clearing, technically, though it’s certainly not clear of mangled old bushes or overgrown grasses that are mostly dead because it’s god damn November. There is a house, though; not at all the dinky little shack Dean was expecting. It’s hard to make out the details of the house, there’s so much miscellaneous forest growth on every part: dirt, moss, fallen leaves from trees Dean can’t even see in the vicinity. As they get closer, Dean can see that the small porch has rotted away on one side, but the doors and windows all seem intact. There’s even a loft or an attic. How the hell did Castiel build this?
“I’m not letting my dick make any choices, Cas, you had me the second you said you wanted me to come with you.”
. Dean, who was so afraid his personality was scaring Castiel off when they started to become friends. What an unbelievably foolish and selfish oversight.
Castiel sets the plates on the table and grabs two forks from the kitchen before joining Claire, who is already lifting a slice of bacon.
balls, so…” Claire stares down at herself. “I feel like we’ve gone to a weird place, wanna pretend the past minute never happened?”
The oven timer goes off, and Dean sags in relief before practically running for the kitchen. Unsure if he should follow, Castiel remains standing in the living room. He listens to the sound of the oven being opened, and Dean taking a deep inhale. He definitely wants some of whatever cookies Dean made.
The journey to Champaign passes about the same as it did the first time. Lots of Dean avoiding eye contact, headphones on instead of earbuds, pretending the world mostly isn’t there.
Jimmy’s eyes are watering, just a little. “I’m… honored. Any other stipulations? Are names that are… uh…
Dean nearly spits out his drink. “Fuck, for a second I thought you were fucking hitting on me, man.”
Castiel shakes Meg’s hand, it’s cold from the water bottle, and that little shock of sensation shakes some of his nerves free. “I’m Castiel.” It’s gotten easier to introduce himself as Castiel and not Jimmy, but there’s still a slight urge to use his old name.
Dean looks around at his messy living space, realizing belatedly that his sweatpants are not only on backwards, they’re inside out. “I don’t handle relationship troubles that well.”
Dean leans against the door frame, grinning. He’s wearing a holiday scarf that suddenly surfaced a week ago. It’s green, the knit too close to be be handmade. It’s patterned with snowflakes and smiling snowmen, white like the soft fringe on the edges. Dean hasn’t explained the scarf, and Castiel hasn’t asked, but he’s quite curious.
Within five minutes they’re sitting on the motel room’s bed, Castiel’s laptop open. The screen is way bigger than the laptop Tessa lets Dean borrow sometimes, Dean’s jealous. They spend a few minutes deciding what to watch; Castiel threatens to leave when Dean suggests Halo Project. Somehow they land on Grey’s Anatomy.
“No, man, it wasn’t. It was just… a package. It didn’t have a name or a personality or anything.” Dean frowns when Henriksen’s pen starts moving. “Not that the chess pieces had personalities. I mean I know they didn’t.” Bishop Virgil wasn’t
Dean holds up a clipboard that he seems to have pulled out of thin air. There’s an application and a pen clipped to it. Castiel takes the clipboard, and Dean lets out some sort of grunt of acknowledgement before walking away.
Castiel nods. “Good. You’ve been working hard all day, it’s time to relax and have some good food. I haven’t been to my favorite restaurant in a while, I’d love to bring you.”
“Yeah? What for? Or is that rude? That’s rude. Sorry, my manners are somewhere in the South China Sea, I think.”
“Yeah, uh… it’s a… this is a little weird, but I’ve had it a long time, and I’ve never opened it…” Dean pulls the package out of the bag, handing it over to Castiel, who accepts it, awed. His fingers trace over the battered edges, the streaks of dirt, the dove decal, the ridiculously old packing information on the front.
Exactly one hour after the phone call, Castiel knocks at the door. Dean’s utterly baffled. Is that a coincidence, or is Castiel some sort of wizard with timing?
“Wonderful!” Castiel exclaims from behind him. Dean jumps, startled. “I spent my entire summer unable to have this screen door open, it was terribly annoying when I wanted to get more airflow in the house. Most of the windows don’t have screens on them, so if I want to get air circulating in my house during hot days, it means I’ll be letting flies and bees in too.”
They grin at each other, and Dean feels like his heart is about to sprout wings and fly right out of the room.
Castiel accepts the delicious smelling burden. “You could join us,” he says, walking toward the door, toeing his shoes on along the way.
Everything is tense now, though, which is a bummer. “Just for that, I’m keeping Novak on the list,” Dean says, trying to lighten the mood. There’s a chuckle from Charlie and a deep British sigh from Ketch.
Castiel and Kelvin both stop walking, looking at each other, then at Dean’s group. They both point at themselves, the “me?” of the gesture obvious.
Five minutes later, Dean’s running around the motel room, cleaning up all the beer cans and food packaging, and stuffing his dirty clothes back into his trash bag. He dives into the shower, scrubbing hard and fast, washing his hair with an unnecessary amount of shampoo. He loses nearly ten minutes trying and failing to find his clippers to get rid of his beard, so the beard has to stay. But he’s showered, his teeth are brushed, the motel room is clean, he’s wearing his last clean t-shirt and underwear, and he has a pine tree air freshener stuffed in the bag with his dirty clothes. He’s presentable.
“You were gonna. Dean you’re in your fucking thirties, this running away from home during a breakup shit isn’t cute anymore.”
an important part of me, and it hurt to have to let it go when my character was killed, but… but I did let it go for the most part, and it’s not what I want now.”
” Meg says, eyes roaming over Castiel. “I could climb you like a tree. But it’s no fun if I’m the only one into it.”
Castiel nods. “I’m sure you are.” He kneels and looks Dean in the eyes. There’s not enough light out for Dean to see the blue in Castiel’s eyes, he misses it a little. “I know you’re uncomfortable with me seeing you like this, Dean, but if it’s alright, I’d like to stay.”
They decide to go to Harvelle’s again after all, though their meal is decidedly less expensive this time. They share an order of mozzarella sticks and an order of fries, with water to drink. Castiel is pretty sure they were given way more fries than they paid for, but he’s not complaining. Sam isn’t their server this time, but when he spots them he grins wide and comes over.
black t-shirt. His arms are wet and soapy, and he looks so focused on his task, he doesn’t even seem to notice when Castiel parks a few spots away, or when Castiel walks up to him.
“It’s not fine, Amelia! It’s not fine. I’m so scared for James. I’m scared of what dating will be like for them, and the hatred they’ll face, and… and do you
There’s no reception out here, no tv or internet, no cell signal. If Dean wants to make a call or check his messages, he has to go all the way back to the highway, which takes nearly two hours. It stresses him out, not being able to check on Sam and the girls, but Ash is pretty sure he’ll be able to get hold of a satellite phone for Dean by the end of the month.
He arrives at Hannah’s house at just before eleven in the morning, because Castiel had said he wanted to take them to lunch.
Castiel sighs and rolls his eyes as he hands Claire a ten dollar bill. “Please order a side salad with your mozzarella sticks, Claire.”
Castiel groans and whines, and then he’s lifting himself up and grabbing Dean’s cock to hold it steady. He sinks down onto Dean slowly, warm and tight and too fucking good. Dean starts to thrust up into him, but Castiel is already on it, riding Dean with determination. He slows down as his wings close around them, creating a cocoon lit by the glow of grace light in Castiel’s eyes and tattoos. When Dean closes his eyes he can still see the light.
was justice. Obviously he didn’t give a damn shit about justice, he cared about covering his ass and getting on with the business of being a traitor.”
lives. He’s eyeing Castiel warily, as though Castiel might lash out at him, or run away. When Castiel does neither, Dean keeps talking.
“How awful,” Castiel says, wanting to reach out and comfort a version of Dean that likely no longer exists.
“You had such a hard time growing up, and I didn’t even see… I just want this new life to be perfect.”
“So…” Dean tugs Castiel’s hand, leading him out of the office and toward the stairs. “This is you with writer’s block, huh?”
Meg seems amused when they return to her house and Castiel offers to walk her to her porch, but she indulges him.
Castiel is annoyed but unsurprised to find Lucifer in his chair the following morning, feet propped up on his desk.
“I mean kind of, I don’t know. He was nice about it. We talked until we fell asleep and when I woke up he was all snuggled up against—” Dean cuts himself off, but it’s too late, Sam’s already perking up again.
“Well… I’d like to tell you Benny came to his fucking senses on his own, but the truth is he heard Alastair trying to bribe me. Heard enough to realize I wasn’t the bad guy. So… he got me out, we got Alastair subdued, arrested, shipped off to Gitmo-Lite, and… apparently now he’s dead. Died in his sleep… in his fucking
At seven on Friday morning his bus gets to Champaign. He sends a text to Sam, who doesn’t respond because he won’t be awake for another hour, then he walks two miles to a motel. There’s one close to the bus station, but it’s nearly forty dollars more. Dean can’t see dropping that much money when he has two working legs and he’s awake enough to keep going.
“No, but… I’m worried that I’m going to be terrible, so I would really like to get started so I can improve.”
Castiel showers, shampoos, and conditions until he feels scrubbed clean and pleasant smelling. He wears black slacks that closely match Dean’s waistcoat, which he wears over a dark gray button-up shirt and a black tie. When he comes out of his room, Claire is standing in front of his door, waiting… with Sam.
“I do, but I’m missing the hammer. And the pliers. And the level. My sister borrowed them and I never saw them again.”
Dean’s about to suggest they get started on painting the house when he notices Castiel staring at his hands… no, his arms, where the sleeves of his henley are rolled up, exposing the long, gnarled scar along his left arm.
Dating a minor celebrity has been weird, though. Sometimes Dean will completely forget Castiel is kind of a famous actor, and then some screeching fan will come barrelling up to them at the mall asking for Castiel’s autograph, or some total stranger with a Halo Project userpic will try to friend Dean on Facebook. It’s fucking weird, although Dean can’t help but slightly relish in the jealous looks fans sometimes give him when they see his arm around Castiel or something. He’s not really used to being the source of envy for anything other than his dashing good looks.
On day thirteen, Sam calls. Dean answers it of course, he’s not going to ignore a call from his brother.
There are several holes in Castiel’s wooden fence that Dean patches up with the particle board. It’s not pretty, and it certainly doesn’t match, but if they paint the fence it will look better, Dean thinks. He stands near the back door, squinting and trying to imagine what color would be good for the fence. White would be awful, the solid lattice would look terrible as a white wall… maybe tan? Brown? Something grassy? Dean should look at Castiel’s paint swatches.
” he says, louder this time. Castiel twitches and opens his eyes, and Jesus fucking Christ did they somehow get even
The bed dips with Dean’s weight, and Castiel feels his breath catch when Dean pops the button of his jeans. “Still ready?” he says, pulling the zipper down slowly.
Dean’s shoulders jump, but only a little. “Roger, Echo One, you are clear to engage,” Dean says in a very serious tone.
Dean moves back inside Castiel with a rough shove, and some high, desperate sound claws its way out of Castiel’s throat.
Dean doesn’t know how to respond to that. “I would have been really into the story too, I think. I mean if it had been someone else I was reading about.”
This is one of those moments when Dean wonders if he’ll still be hunting when he’s his father’s age.
“Forgive me,” Castiel pleads, pulling Dean’s hand to his lips so he can shower it with kisses, “I had assumed my wards were more than enough. They
“You never know,” Castiel whispers, “consent is important.” It’s not an inherently sexy statement, but Castiel’s voice is low and rough with sleep and arousal, and Dean’s definitely thickening in his jeans.
It’s Friday night, and Dean and his crowd are at Harvelle’s like always, sitting on the couches towards the back underneath the sign with “VIP LOUNGE” spelled out in glued-down beer bottle caps. Harvelle’s is on the ass-end of Wichita, thirty minutes from where Dean lives and even further from where he works, but he and his friends have been coming here for years. It’s home, like his car, his brother, and his dad’s old leather jacket.
“It’s not like that, Tess. All of my… my substantial relationships have been with women, and not once did I run off to go fuck a guy.”
Dean grins. “Figured since I’m the experienced one here I should tell you all the shit I wish I’d known when I started sleeping with guys.”
If he had the funds, Castiel would make this a real trip, with sight-seeing, tourist traps, the works. As it is, they’re mostly just seeing highways, rest stops, and fast food places.
“Important thing is she runs, and there’s a tarp we can lay out so your furniture doesn’t get old mud all over it.”
get comfortable. There was always something off. The grass was too itchy, the cave was too hard and lumpy, I was too cold… shit like that. When I got back home, I was so excited to be in a real fucking bed, you know? But I can’t sleep in one. It’s too comfortable. I like… I don’t know, got trained to have
“Nah, but I’m not going to just stay with her while waiting for something better to come along.” Sam’s expression scrunches up. “Uh, no offense.”
Dean’s body is warm, his left hand gripping Castiel’s hip. The soft, delirious sounds of pleasure he makes have Castiel shivering in a way the cold glass doesn’t.
So, Dean keeps talking. “It’s messed up, but I figure it’s like how sometimes convicts miss prison when they get out, or when people have Stockholm syndrome. I don’t get that homesick feeling anymore, but sometimes… sometimes I wish I could show it to you. The dry bed of grass and giant leaves where I slept, the charcoal cave drawings, I even had a favorite tree.”
“Well, go ahead and have a look,” Dean says, “I’ll be out here tearing out this carpet so I can fucking burn it in the parking lot.”
“I just don’t know how to make friends anymore, man. I thought I should wait for him to call. I keep thinking maybe I weirded him out.”
The final ingredient is a “battery”, as Castiel calls it but really it’s a mason jar with angelic grace inside.
“I do a drag show on weekends, and when I first got to Chicago I didn’t have anyone to help me with my look… but I found loads of great tips on YouTube.”
“I’ll get the hang of it,” Jimmy says, opening the cabinet to grab the cereal instead. “Didn’t you say you had something?”
From Cas - 9/01/17 - 5:35pm: Actually, I was going to see if I could come see you, but that works too.
“Sent in two-thousand twelve,” Castiel says, softly. “You’ve had this for four years, and you never opened it?”
“I didn’t, not when it was going to be full time for who knew how long, but this is ten episodes. Three months of filming, and I’m back to Lawrence.”
and then I quit my job because I wasn’t going to work for her fucking father every day while I waited to see if she’d take me back, and now I’m slowly draining my savings on this motel room and take out food. How is
Dean grabs Castiel’s hand and pulls him in the direction of the stairwell as the elevator doors close. Castiel has an odd and intense urge to lace their fingers together which he ignores until Dean lets go.
“I’ve died so many times,” Dean says to Castiel once they’re standing side by side. “Hundreds of times, according to Sam, but that was Gabriel being… Gabriel.”
Castiel is holding Dean’s right leg up for a better angle, and Dean’s thigh burns, and it’s hard to move enthusiastically because the air mattress isn’t as firm as a regular mattress, and Dean is still in heaven.
He’s not going to mention that to Henriksen, though. He told the last shrink that, and it made their sessions really fucking awkward. He could always sense the giant pause in Dr. Tran’s sentence, where she obviously wanted to congratulate Dean on making eye contact or something.
“Then Amelia… you need to understand that this…” Jimmy puts one hand on the brochure. “This is not what is best for him… for them.”
Claire beams. “I am! I’m excited to go to school, I’m excited about this apartment, I’m even excited to start with my new therapist next week. This is it, Dad, my life is finally starting, after months… maybe even
God damn, Dean hasn’t felt this scolded in decades. “Palm Motel… s’ here in Wichita,” Dean mumbles, feeling embarrassed. “Room sixteen. Don’t tell her where I am, Sammy.”
“Different job. I was a mechanic, but the company folded… that’s when Tess made me get a job with her dad. Well she didn’t
.” And Dean wants to reciprocate the statement but all he can do is moan, eyes hooded, moving closer and closer to flying apart. At some point Castiel must let go of Dean’s legs, because now they’re wrapped around Castiel’s waist while Castiel braces himself on both hands, fucking Dean smooth and hard.
To Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:25pm: and here i thought you’d be the voice of experience, you’re what, two years older?
” he hisses. Dean lets go of his own still twitching cock to take hold of Castiel’s, focusing on jacking him to completion. Castiel’s generally low and gritty voice gets higher and more desperate the closer he gets to orgasm, and Dean is greedy to hear more, clenching and twisting his hand with what little finesse he can muster until Castiel is crying out and coming all over Dean’s hips.
look him in the eye. He’s not jumping when Sam scratches his ear too suddenly, or flinching when Sam laughs a little too loud. Actually he
“We both should’ve. It’s… we learned something from the experience. That’s going to have to be good enough.”
“Cracks. It’s odd discovering your perfect life really wasn’t. I love and miss my parents dearly, but they would have been horrified by my divorce, and my bisexual atheist daughter.”
The stairwell door at the other end of the hall bangs open and Sam comes running toward them, barefoot and wearing a pair of Iron Man sleep pants with a bright pink t-shirt that’s at
Castiel’s looking off to the side slightly like he does when he’s lying to Dean. The fuck is he lying about? “You’re not feeling it right now? So, no one you’re interested in?”
Castiel sits back down next to Dean. “In retrospect, it’s a little silly that I didn’t recognize you the instant I saw you.”
Dean sighs, leaning against the desk in the room. “Okay, what do you want to know? I haven’t exactly known Cas that long in the grand scheme of things.”
” Castiel had honestly forgotten he’s been in tears this morning. “It did help, as did you. Although… something sort of odd happened.”
“I need a shower, Gabriel spilled orange juice on me and I’m still sticky,” Castiel announces to the room.
“Yeah, I know what you mean. I still miss Topeka sometimes. I mean, the move to Lawrence, my parents dying, that was over a decade ago. I don’t live with my aunt anymore, but I’m still in Wichita.”
He closes the door behind him, looking around the room with raised and probably judgmental eyebrows.
Hannah sighs, taking a heart shaped jelly doughnut from the box at the center of their table. “It was delivered by a delivery man that didn’t sign in when he came in the building, so I have no idea who he works for. I even got Virgil in security to send me a copy of the feed from this morning. Useless. He kept his head down, and the baseball cap and delivery uniform he wore didn’t have logos!” Hannah bites into her doughnut angrily.
Their first task of the day is to build a pyre for the corpse in Castiel’s living room. Dean clears away dry brush and uses water from a nearby stream to get the ground damp and less flammable. They’re supposed to have electricity and running water up here at the house, through a process that sounded an
“Call me Gabriel. And remember that gratitude when the other partners are yelling at you for not finding a typo in their monthly report or forcing you to drive back to the deli because their sandwich doesn’t have enough fucking pickles on it.”
There it is, that’s what Dean was saving his energy for. “Love you,” he croaks out, and then he can’t help but let go.
Castiel turns his head towards Dean, eyebrow quirked up like it does when Castiel thinks Dean is being obtuse. “Of course,” he says.
“I miss my marriage, I miss who she was before she found herself presented with a reality she couldn’t accept. I miss sleeping next to someone who loved me. But… after the things she said… what she tried to do… I’m not sure that I miss
about helping Dean pay what he can’t cover. Sam is fucking weird. Dean gets it though, he does. Dean’s back, and the “novelty” hasn’t exactly worn off. Sam’s excited to have his brother back, and Dean understands, which is why he lets Sam talk him into going out to dinner after they’re done shopping. And a movie after dinner. And then they go out to play pool and have rumless Rum-and-Cokes.
“I have to show you something,” Hannah says urgently. She grabs Castiel by the hand and pulls him towards her desk while Castiel looks longingly at the container full of soup he would very much like to eat.
The man at the check-in counter unsubtly eyes Claire up and down as he waits for the system to boot up so they can purchase a room. Castiel’s never really been in a fight, but he’s vividly picturing lunging across the counter and punching the man in the face.
and zone out or startle or whatever, but… I’m still your brother. There’s a lot of missing pieces of information, I just want some of it filled in.”
this out to Kaia in the middle of dinner, because I was scared and nervous… and she was so funny, and reassuring, and just… Dad, I can’t believe I get to go out with her.”
want to hear again, Cas, and then I went to sleep with earplugs in, and as soon as I took them out I heard you
“I think it’s gonna go well, Dean. I really do, and if not, we can get drunk!” Sam’s over-chatty as he drives them to Bobby’s house in southwest Wichita.
By the time Dean gets back to the bar, his friends are gone, and so is his phone. That’s fucking great. Awesome. There’s nowhere to go but home, and the chances of Tessa not knowing are slim.
Hannah laughs, then looks embarrassed. “Sorry, it’s just… that’s exactly what the last assistant did the day she quit.”
Dean almost makes a crack about flowers not being manly, but he sees the insincere deflection for what it is and discards the thought. “Well, if you’ve been saving your wages like a good boy…”
“It isn’t. It feels good, Dean, after all these eons I have found a true purpose. Not as a soldier or a pawn, but a
They end up chatting for over two hours, and the conversation goes far smoother than it usually does in person. Dean’s not feeling awkward for mostly not looking Sam in the eye, or worrying Sam is judging him when he
Castiel clambers into the tent, zipping the panel closed behind him. “No, but I think he’s yelling at Kevin in team chat, so Kevin is probably crying.”
Castiel smiles, warm, fond. “I can, but I think it’s pretty important that you say what you want out loud.”
Castiel does what Dean thinks is his version of an enthusiastic fist pump. It comes off looking awkward and half-assed though, which makes it even better, in Dean’s opinion.
When they finish dinner, Dean wanders around the house with a pen and a notebook. It’s a really nice notebook, actually. Leather bound and mostly full of to-do lists and reminders. There’s a lot about Castiel’s house that he’d fix, but he’s not sure how much of it
Dean’s posture relaxes a little. “That’s about the nicest way anyone’s ever told me I was unstable.”
“Claire…” Castiel honestly thought they were past this, but he supposes sometimes negativity refuses to fade.
The next time Dean sees Castiel is nearly four weeks after their odd dinner together. The Orpheum Theatre is showing Clerks, and for once Dean’s at a movie alone. Not a big deal, really, sometimes he just feels like being alone.
Dean rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed. “I yelled at a kid dressed as an astronaut for egging my car, once.” Castiel gasps and covers his mouth with mock outrage. Dean rolls his eyes. “Dick.”
Dean’s bus back to Wichita is at four, so after Dean finishes with the pressure washer they decide to stop for the day. Dean makes them pasta carbonara for lunch, heart thrumming with how damn
Dean’s a little taken aback by the change of subject, but okay. “I mean no offense, but it’s not my cup of tea,” he says diplomatically. No need to tell the guy to his face that his show kind of sucks.
“Are they still good for me when I add this much dressing?” Dean asks, drizzling a squeeze packet of ranch all over the exposed parts of his salad.
Clare sighs, eyes fluttering closed. “Best date of my life. Which… okay isn’t saying a whole lot, but it was awesome. Can I be TMI with you?”
” Claire says by way of greeting. “They smell so good, but I haven’t had time to try them, since I’m kicking everyone’s ass.”
did I not know this?” Charlie sounds pretty offended, which is fair. They’ve been friends since high school, when Charlie was in his class for all of two months before her parents died and she left Lawrence to live with her aunt here in Wichita.
“Gross. How about I make a breakfast with a long cooking time and you go take a nap?” Dean says, pulling the coffee mug away from Castiel’s hands.
On Monday, Castiel and Claire go to price furniture. Claire scoffs at Castiel’s diligent note taking, but these notes will make buying furniture this week much easier. Claire’s excited to get a boxspring and mattress set that isn’t used, unlike the ones at the last apartment. Castiel is likely going to hold off on bed frames until he has a job, unless he finds a good deal. They plan on getting two full size mattress sets, a bookshelf, a small dining table, chairs, a sofa, and a smaller bookshelf for Claire.
“Reading about the adventures of Jody and Donna over the past decade has brought me so much comfort, your books got me through some really tough times. If you never write another word again, what your stories did for me won’t magically vanish. I hope you know that.”
“Not a very kindly way to greet someone, chief.” The man has an accent, something southern. Louisiana, maybe… Castiel’s not sure.
The five of them spend the night drinking beers and playing poker while Dean’s Die Hard dvds play in the background.
“I consent to whatever it is we’re doing or about to do,” Dean says, shuddering when Castiel starts kissing along his jaw.
Castiel can feel Dean pushing, pushing, then breaching him agonizingly slow. He knows his own mouth is hanging open, but he’s forgotten how to close it. This is so different from Dean’s fingers, Castiel feels filled, surrounded. He breathes in Dean’s scent, trying to ground himself. He feels ready to fly apart. The restraints are too much right now.
Since Claire came out, Castiel hasn’t spent much time puzzling over what Claire and her former therapist might have gone over in their sessions. He’s been a little curious, but he assumed it wasn’t quite his business.
Claire leaves, and then Castiel’s alone in an empty and mostly unfamiliar apartment. It’s lonely. Castiel makes it all of forty minutes before he decides he ought to go about finding a job. He calls about the receptionist positions from the paper. One has already been filled, two are looking for someone with receptionist experience, one Castiel hangs up on after realizing the person is disappointed that he’s a man, and one schedules an interview for Monday.
Dean, I just…” Tessa looks up at Dean, and her eyes are so full of something Dean can’t understand. They’ve been dating for over three years and here in this moment Dean can’t even read her.
“I’m aware. I want you, Dean, but I’m worried I’ll do it… wrong. You’re experienced at this, and I’m… not.”
They travel for ten hours before they reach Lexington, Nebraska at eleven at night, hungry and exhausted. They eat their weight in curly fries at Arby’s before heading to an Econo-Lodge.
“Far be it for me to disrupt your newfound happiness by throwing you to the wolves’ den of office gossip.”
“It’s uh… baked macaroni and cheese with ham and some other stuff… hopefully nothing you can’t eat,” Dean says with a shrug.
Dean can’t believe he’s putting his Sappy Optimist hat on right now, but here he is. “You know how much hope that package gave me on the i-island… how it gave me reason to believe I had a future… it kept me hanging on. I think… dude I think it’s pretty cool that we had that impact on each other before we even met.”
Finally Dean pulls away, arms and knees aching. Castiel’s clothes are a fucking mess with both their come. Gross and thrilling.
Castiel’s a bit surprised. He knows Claire’s school has its share of intolerant youths, but Claire is careful about who she’s friends with.
Dean would very much like to watch Castiel get himself ready, but he can’t, because Castiel is determined to kiss Dean within an inch of his life. His kisses are needy, urgent. He has a good hold on the back of Dean’s head with his free hand, and he’s rocking just slightly in Dean’s lap.
couch that smells just a little bit like honey. It’s a weird issue, this inability to sleep indoors if his body meets some arbitrary threshold for “too comfortable”. He’s certain he would sleep better on this couch, or on a bed, if he could actually get to the point where he fell asleep. However, something about the comfort and the four walls around him makes his mind too active, makes him think about the rocks and sticks and moss and sand he slept on night after night. His mind rarely lets him settle. He wants to curl up in this sweet-smelling couch and drift off, but that’s not happening.
Dean’s expression twitches into an almost smile, then goes back to a frown. “Yeah, sure,” he says, stepping to the side.
? No, he’s going to use the name we picked out the day he was born. The day I screamed and I pushed until God helped me bring my son into the world. My
It means a lot to him, knowing he makes someone he cares about feel safe, even if it’s a little hard to believe.
The man turns a little, just enough for Dean to see— oh, for crying out loud, it’s Castiel Novak. Fuck, Dean’s never going to hear the end of this. “Not goin’ for
“I was just about to.” Castiel lifts the lid, there’s a delicious smelling helping of what looks like a thick potato soup, topped with melted cheese, chives, and diced bacon. “High marks for presentation.”
Those moments all pale in comparison to that first touch of Castiel’s lips, the stunned and relieved noise he makes against Dean’s mouth. There’s no hesitation at that moment, his arms immediately wrap around Dean, one hand smoothing from Dean’s back to grip the back of his hair. There’s a bit of shuffling and shifting and then Castiel’s all the way on his back, one jean clad leg wrapped around Dean’s waist. Castiel kisses like he does nearly everything else he’s passionate about; with focus, with precision, with his entire being.
“I think I finally realized that the other day. I saw that motorcycle, and… I wasn’t jealous. I just hate that guy.” Dean sighs. This is all so weird. They’re two people that care about each other, and yet it’s so, so, over. Arguably with a whimper, not a bang. “I’m sorry, Tess. You were
“I’ll say. Well,” Dean pats the foil with one mitt. “Enjoy,” he says, before ambling out of the apartment. Castiel watches him go, and when he looks back at Claire she’s already eating a forkful of macaroni and cheese out of the dish and probably burning the entire inside of her mouth.
a gift. Anniversaries, that was the more mutual exchange. I think my marriage leaned too heavily on traditional gender roles, sometimes. Silly, looking back.” Castiel sighs. “Can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul?”
Dean whirls around, startled to see his mom standing there. Jesus, when’s the last time he actually saw her? Six months ago? No, more than that, it was Christmas. Her hair’s shorter now, and she’s got a band-aid on her forehead. She looks happy.
Dean snorts, and socks Ash in his (naked) shoulder, and when they get out to the parking lot, Castiel sees why. Ash’s truck looks like it was pelted with stones, rolled off a cliff, blasted with a hose that only sprays mud, then left out in the desert to rust for about a decade. How does this even happen to a vehicle?
Castiel’s eyes squint in confusion. God, he’s adorable. “So you don’t want to be sore, but you don’t want me to make it go away?”
He considers cleaning up, maybe taking a shower, but he doesn’t. It’s Sam, Sam’s seen him in a worse state than this, and vice versa. He does brush his teeth and put on a t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants, though. Sam should be honored.
“Well don’t look at me,” Dean says, “I’m not going to be that asshole bugging a celebrity when they’re just trying—” Dean’s interrupted by the rarely-heard sound of Ketch laughing. “Dude, what?”
He returns home, haunted by the mental image of Meg being spanked by his least favorite boss, and immediately pours himself three fingers from the rarely opened bottle of bourbon he keeps in his underwear drawer. He downs the serving in one gulp, allowing his body to shudder from both the alcohol and the idea of facing Lucifer ever again.
“If you can keep a secret, why does the entire office know about Malachai getting food poisoning and ruining his pants?”
Sam smiles. “Dean said you have a date, and that I should make sure you were doing his vest-thing justice.”
Castiel drifts into the kitchen, wondering what he could make with his still incredibly limited culinary skills. He opts for bacon, eggs, and toast. Things that are hard to mess up.
“That got a bit bleak, I apologize. Now that we’re divorced it’s easy to look back at all the things wrong with our life together, but honestly I
To Cas - 8/14/17 - 9:51am: they all looked different too, one had long black hair and a scar down one eye, and then one looked like you and one had pink hair
Castiel shrugs. Dean can see something in his expression, though it’s hard to be sure in this light. He thinks he sees something like fear, though. Maybe sadness.
The restaurant is nice, although it’s pretty crowded with people eager for a Saturday night out. Dean’s been skimming the menu, but he has no idea what he wants to order. Something with beef? Something cheap? Is Castiel paying?
“If I might be bold a minute,” their server says, seeming to appear from nowhere, “perhaps you two should compromise and try something new together?”
point is there’s a two bedroom apartment available. Hasn’t been listed yet, Dean’s still taking care of the damage left behind, but… it’s a nice building, only seven blocks from here!”
Castiel practically throws himself at Dean then, wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders and squeezing so hard it makes his own arms ache. Dean doesn’t move for a long moment, long enough that Castiel is considering letting go, then he lets out a soft sound, maybe a sob. He hugs Castiel back, just as tight.
Tessa is all smiles when she answers the door, wearing the little black dress she borrowed from Charlie, who borrowed it from Jo, who borrowed it from Dean’s ex-girlfriend Josie four years ago. Not that Tessa knows that, and Dean’s sure as shit not going to tell her right now when they’re set to have a good night. Just the two of them, at a bar Dean never goes to because it’s expensive and he’d rather be in the pretend VIP lounge at Harvelle’s.
but that’s kinda it. My dad took it real hard of course, did a lot of drinking… he ended up in jail, and me and Sammy got shipped here from Kansas to live with my mom’s parents. It took a few years, but my dad did eventually get his shit together and moved out here too. He never had custody, but he lived pretty close. Sam and I got to see him all the time.”
“Oh!” Castiel says suddenly. “Where are my manners?” He gathers his grocery bags in one hand and tucks the package under his arm. “Please, come inside.”
“You get this constipated look on your face when you’re trying to think of something to complain about,” Claire says.
“Right. Anyway,” Dean shoves the containers into Castiel’s hands. “Pasta salad, peanut butter cookies.”
this. And finally I was into a guy that wasn’t an aloof prick, I wanted to chase that, and not have it fall apart. But the thing is, every relationship falls apart until you find the one that doesn’t. And us staying together, that was just holding us both back from finding the one that sticks.”
Dean makes breakfast, but when he peeks into Castiel’s room, sees him sprawled out on his back with his mouth hanging open, he can’t bring himself to wake the poor guy up. Instead he eats a helping of the breakfast casserole he threw together and then he goes out to fix Castiel’s bike.
. He’ll be leaving Jimmy behind now. He’d still been going by Jimmy at work, but he’d given his two weeks, left with very little notice from his co-workers, and now… no more Jimmy. It’s sad, like Jimmy Novak is someone that died, and it’s sadder still that there’s no one to mourn him. He hasn’t spoken to Amelia since before the divorce was finalized, every last one of his friends have forsaken him, he’s not welcome at his church, and he never really connected with anyone at work. Kind of pathetic, really.
Tessa’s smile freezes on her face a little, but it doesn’t fade. “More than one person paid to watch something that’s available on Netflix?”
“Not as much as I should have, I suppose, but certainly enough to start a small flower shop if I wanted.”
“Or ‘soul-suckingly-awkward’, you are a strong man, and I believe you will make it through. You have a lot of tools at your disposal, Dean. Things we’ve discussed here, medication, leaning on your brother, and you can always check in with my office for same day appointments. If you happened to go to that party Wednesday and found yourself not wanting to wait until the following Monday for your next appointment. Hypothetically.”
wanted or needed, I’m sorry about that. And… the other night… what you said about me waiting for you to be normal again… it’s not true, Dean. I’m happy to have you home, just as you are. You don’t need to be anything or anyone for me, okay?”
“D-do you have—” Dean moans when he feels Castiel’s tongue sweep along his left nipple, almost forgetting his train of thought.
Talking low in Castiel’s ear, kisses on the cheek, Dean’s hands on Castiel’s waist, Castiel tasting sauce from Dean’s fingers. They make a sizable batch, then they bring the mozzarella sticks and a few bowls of sauce over to Castiel’s apartment, where they’re hailed as heroes for bringing gaming fuel. No one mentions the Facebook statuses, so Castiel doesn’t have to answer any questions just yet.
the jacket. Dean doesn’t know why Sam kept it, but he feels better in it, like his dad is still with him.
