The combination on the next door proves troublesome. After the fifth try, Sherlock gives up. Most likely one his pet schnauzer's birthdays. Sherlock goes up on the roof instead, down the second access stairwell. This is sealed off from the main stairwell, but grants access to Lord Blackwood's living space. It seems the only way in for Sherlock is up to the roof then down through the left stairwell since the elevators in the center of the building are too conspicuous. The same combination lock is on this door, and Sherlock gets it on the second try. Grandfather’s birthday this time.
“And I would not want to do it without my doctor!”
"Sherlock, what the hell do you think you're doing? Why shouldn't I trust Moriarty?"
Sherlock reaches into his pocket for his skeleton key. As he brushes off the top of the chest and blows into the keyhole to clear it, it reminds him of another place, another time, but instead of his brother across from him on his knees, it’s John.
"Another one, as in another dashingly handsome genius?" James had responded. He leered at Sherlock as he spoke.
“We’re hardly competitors any more, and the world has changed.”
“Mycroft said we’d lock my memories inside. It worked. But maybe in the process, I pushed too many inside.”
“I do think it’s wise to stay the night. Listen to the doctors, that’s what I always say.”
And this note to me? She observed my problem: how to give me what I locked away. She is a Holmes. Like myself and Mycroft, she must solve and resolve.
"I used to love those—I still love the rhyme and meter in them. It's part of where my love for music and fantasy started. My mom read to my sister and me a lot when we kids. I used to beg her to read
All possible, all probable. Yet Sherlock knew that within these possibilities, there'd be some combination he hadn't accounted for, something that Sherlock couldn't predict. And that excited him.
"Quite the tale."
“I’d put down your gun,” Moran said. “I would love to have an excuse to put a bullet into his head.”
A great loss. Psychosomatic! Not survivor's guilt but the guilt an alchemist feels not being able to save someone one loves. I could blurt out my conclusions for verification, but I lack the energy. All I want to do is sleep.
John turned off the water. “I don’t want to ask, do I?”
As John comes closer, Sherlock becomes determined to dash the sad, pleading look from John’s eyes and replace it with fire and hope.
“Shut the fuck up!” He gives me a kick in my side with his ugly double-monk loafers.
“Um. Good morning. Bit early for orientation?” John attempts to refocus attention away from why he’s fallen asleep in a patient’s room.
“I don’t see that anything much has changed as far as power,” John says. “Sure it was chaos for a time, but no dictator stepped in. The world seems to be running much the same.”
She’s thoroughly enjoying herself with her sons if that crooked smile she’s wearing is any indication. John imagines many Christmases where she played referee betwixt the two.
John's head popped back as the door opened. Sherlock flounced through.
Mycroft clasps his hands behind his back, waiting for John to say more, but the painkiller has slowed John’s mind, and really, he has nothing more to say. Sophy, on the other hand, does.
Even as she says those, he thinks she’s really not.
“Very real. I’ve noticed this over the last days I’ve spent at the department with Lestrade.”
Although the throbbing spears of shooting pain through my head, neck, and shoulder bury all thought, I do grasp what the man wants. It's what most everyone wants when they realize I am an alchemist: riches, power. From me.
And Sherlock was the man John spent it with. How could he tear down a room with that inside?
This is it. I anguish over ending stories. It’s difficult to end something you’ve grown to love. I find it hard to let go, like a child you don’t want to grow up and move out of the house.
"I loved him?" she asked.
She scribbled it  down and ripped it off and handed it to him. Must be she was studying to be a doctor. Her handwriting sucked.
“Well, this has all gone to shite,” he says, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. Not the homecoming he expected, but he berates himself for not expecting something like this. He hands the violin case to Mrs. Hudson.
I stare at him incredulously and shake my head.
“I never thought I would be castigated for choosing the name of a pet,” Sherlock says, raising an eyebrow.
“Yes. I’m reheating it. It will be ready momentarily.”
Molly seemed a nice enough person. A part of him wanted to tell her more about Sherlock—his habits, his sly smile, and those sparkling eyes that changed by degrees as he spoke. But he didn't feel right about it. Or maybe he didn't want to share, which made John especially uneasy after that dream last night.
“It’s getting dark.” John said. He massaged the back of his neck. “I guess you should have clocked out an hour ago.”
He sits in the shade of a palm and watches what Sherlock refers to as "complex ecosystems" and wonders about her motives from the beginning. Was she as surprised as he that Sherlock was alive or had she been waiting for him to reappear? What was her interest in John? Was he just a way for her to get to Sherlock? Compliment him, spend time with the poor grieving sap. Bide her time, wait for Sherlock to come to her so she could put a bullet through his heart? But only after the wedding. She needed her wedding planner, of course.
“How about this?” he says stubbornly. “When she asks,
“First I’m kidnapped from the birthday party before they even serve the cake, then I’m tied up and thrown into the boot of a car and left there all night, and then they took me out this morning only to give these stupid instructions. They threw me back in the boot and let me out on the street. I’m to deliver a message.”
“I need to give Mrs. Roberts her things back. This is her wig as well?”
“Mummy!” Mycroft raises his voice, then downs the rest of his brandy.
shut the door."
“You boys!” she says as if she knows what John is thinking.
The door whooshed open again and the plastic sheets flapped.
“It’s starting to get dark and it’s lights out. I always pull the blackout shades down about this time.” Will helps him. They have actual electricity. No more candles.
“Correct. So you do remember him.”
A big thank you to hotshoeagain for the excellent beta!
"I can't tell positively what kind of whale from here, but I believe it's a humpback. They migrate through the tropical Pacific to feed up before breeding. It's magnificent."
He looked into James’ eyes.
"Yes. I'm done with them."
Sherlock still felt the guilt that he was cause for innocent deaths. At the first crimes, James was there beside him. He came to each crime scene to catch the maniac who did this. Later, after Sherlock revealed his suspicions to Lestrade, Sherlock was certain James was always there, watching them.
"I guess we should pack."
The man was a treasure! How did John understand him so, so well?
We're walking along Park Road, at the halfway mark to home. This time it’s John who grabs my hand. “Well?” he says, looking at me expectantly.
"If you are then prove it. Seems ta me the only thing yer good for is heats. Sorry Pink Wednesday Pants, unless you can turn this ta gold, this is your last stop. You show me now. Turn this stone here ta gold or diamonds or somethin' else of value, or I pedal yer pink panties to the highest bidder."
"Why Irene Adler?"
From there depending on how John responds to the initial kiss, getting John into bed might follow any one of three — no, four — sequences. However it might happen, getting John into bed is key: John is, Will concludes from the photographs, that John is a romantic and a bit of a traditionalist: sexual activity in bed is going to have a greater emotional weight than elsewhere in the flat. Also, bed will allow more flexibility in positioning depending on how dominant John wants to be during sex. Will imagines it's possible John, the caretaker, will reveal a desire to be taken care of: to have his lover to take initiative, dip gentle fingers beneath the waistband of his pants and palm his cock as if it was something treasured.
Maybe watching Sherlock lick his lips and fingers as he ate the Pringles was what had prompted the dream. Classical conditioning. He hoped a conditioned response didn't pop up when he next looked at that cupid-bow mouth, or, worse, a can of Pringles.
And he didn't, not at all. He wanted to know how Sherlock's mouth felt.
John never says a word and waits until Sherlock sets down his bow. He can’t believe how breathtaking Sherlock looks with the window’s night lights illuminating his profile.
“Oh, did I jab another soft spot?!” he giggled. “I need some of that passion. Maybe I should get myself a live-in.”
As soon as I start the task of washing the windows, John helps. It’s most distracting. His biceps and triceps flex. He’s toned in ways that make me ache to see what’s beneath the stretch of the thin blue T-shirt he’s wearing. And the way his arse wiggles in his jeans when he’s reaching up high makes me face the opposite direction so that John doesn’t notice I’ve taken a particular interest in his work.
He wondered.
“Part of this I learned when I was with Ms Kratide’s. The other? I think somethings may be returning from that night.”
“Interesting. Most interesting analogy. I thought you only had eyes for Dr. Watson.”
Equivalent exchange. The price is too high. In my current physical state, unpredictable.
I was halfway out of the box when the door cracked open again.
“Nice replacement. I couldn’t tell. Wait...she’s trying to frame you again! It’s a dangerous game she’s playing.”
"Is that some sort of threat? I don't think I want to tell you."
.  We carved it out together. We put the key inside, but I never had the book. Mycroft kept it.”
"Oh, well. I guess his sandwich will keep," he sighed to himself. John set the bag of sandwiches on the desk. Although starved, he needed to unwind and release some of the stress from the day. He sat heavily on his bed, sloughed off his grey hooded sweatshirt, and untied his tennis shoes, then toed them off.
"Let's hope she comes back for us. How much air do we have?"
“Why would you continue to insult someone who hit you in the mouth?” Johns says and Sherlock laughs. It comes from his belly and it’s long, loud, and it makes John feel like he owns the world.
He felt for the seal on the neck of the bottle with the pad of his thumb.
“This is untolerable! What ineptitude! Tell Crenshaw, Mr. Sherlock Holmes demands to see him.”
“John,” Sherlock moans. “Fuck me. Please, John.”
“Leave him out of this,” Sherlock hissed.
“I’m sorry. Do I know you?” Mycroft asks.
I scoff. “Not simple. I could not.”
Sherlock nodded. “Expected.”
How could he blame Molly for crushing on Sherlock when he had to admit that he did too? Sure the man was a giant dick, but those chiseled cheekbones, cupid-bow lips, and eyes that went from green to blue in a flash made up for some of his shortcomings. And that didn't even include his baritone British accent and those long long legs. Or that he really was an interesting person once he decided to let down his guard and open up like he did last night.
“Thank you. I think.”
“There was nothing to remember.”
“Prompted by an unexpected gift.”
"Right," I laughed. "And yours is a girl's name."
“I knew that you were going to ask me questions. I abhor questions. I hate this. Your answer? I took your money. Taking possessions from others result in negative consequences. I don’t relish being in the custody of the police, who I’m sure you’ve already called. It’s also a possible reason why you’ve kept me here. I obviously cannot pay.” He sighs and closes his eyes in dismissal. “The police will ask questions are far worse! So tedious.”
It was the third cigarette John had had that late night, but the nicotine that used to work its magic, stilling his jittering thoughts, was far from helping this time. He was nervous as hell. Blood vessels pounded so hard in his head they were echoing in his ears. If it continued like this for another minute, his skull was going to explode for damn sure. He knew he shouldn't smoke. But fuck, he needed it now.
“Thank you, Lieutenant,” Mycroft rasps. “We do make a good team.”
After his story, I knew I needed to share in kind. I began with just after my father’s death.
Suddenly the sky opens up and it's raining. Hard. It beats him and whips up the water, but it's not the cold rain of London. It's like a pummeling warm shower. He races back to his boat. The upside is that the rain has washed the sweat and sand from him.
Sherlock reaches into the pocket of shorts and removes his mobile and begins to tap with his trembling fingers.
He can hear John voice saying, “It’s
“As an elderly gentleman caller,” Sherlock says, simply. “For Mrs. Hudson.” With a stodgy mustache, fringe of grey hair, wizened face, gainly walk, and a too-large coat, Mycroft held no resemblance to the the man they were introduced to just days before.
"Sherlock? He'd understand. If our roles were switched, he'd do it to save John."
The cab stops, and they climb out into the three fresh inches that blanket the ground. The cabbie helps them with the bags from the boot. It’s almost a shame, John thinks, to leave footprints in the pristine snow.
My reverie is broken by a bang from the top of the stairs.
With those words, Sherlock knew he'd had to have a heart to heart with John after this conversation. He'd have no choice.
been using sunscreen. Not very effective. The burn is painful, but not nearly as irritating as these mosquito bites." He begins to scratch them at the reminder.
"Yeah? Thank you for that." John pushes aside some of the branches of what he recognizes as a native tree. Sherlock ducks to keep from being swatted by a branch's rebound.
“Let’s give you a quick checkup when we get to hospital.”
She laughs harder. “That would work. But it’s messier yet.”
I had wondered before. It is now confirmed. The folds. I read it again. A sudden panic washes over me. I recall how Mycroft and I desperately worked to understand the song lyrics to find Red Beard’s location. That was the cryptic riddle before, now it is a poem.
“Glad we cleared that up,” he laughs and kisses me again. “As much as I’d love to continue this, we need to strip you out of these clothes. You need a shower and help. I don’t want you falling.”
I am pacing in front of the fireplace, bare feet cautiously avoiding Rosie’s wooden alphabet blocks. I remain uncertain. Should I rush upstairs and tell him? I am about to do it when I get a call from Lestrade for a case. It’s a relief—a chance to return to our normal. Afterward, we can talk.
"John?" Sherlock calls from far away. "John!"
Only a few are. Like Moriarty.
“Good choices. You know my son well,” she says and stands up and begins to collect what he needs from the room. She hands him Benny Bear, then his violin, his real violin.
John begins to unpin them and take them down, but William places his hand over John’s. He flinches and pulls back. “Leave them,” he says. “They belong here.”
“I’ll talk to Lestrade,” John says, relieved that Sherlock hadn’t noticed. “I am a bit wound up that he tried to arrest you.”
The doctor actually smiles at me, but there’s guilt behind his eyes. I have the same look in mine. “I can attach it, that is all. I can’t do the seal. I could once but not now.”
-----------------
Mike ignores John’s protests. “The safety presentations are Molly’s crusade. We had a good blood-borne video, but it’s pre-epidemic. Molls wrote up some stuff about Pandora because NHS hadn’t put together anything new. Now they have, but Molly says it’s shite so she still gives her own talk and doesn’t trust anybody except Sally Davies to do it for her.”
she’s even his mum! Until that time, no more personal questions.”
“Not to worry,” Sherlock says, setting the laptop in front of John, “most of the sensitive posts I set to private; however, that will not stop Sophy from accessing the hidden posts and reading them, which is the true purpose.”
bother him? The fact that he didn't get into the work-study on his own merit. When he’d thought that Professor Doyle chose him to help in the research, it was the most bitchin’ thing that ever happened to him. Danged if it wasn’t the case at all. Instead, it was all some grand plan of assistant professor Moriarty's to get back into Sherlock's pants, or something more sinister.
"You really need to use some sort of sunscreen," John says. "I don't know why I didn't see you hiding behind all that green foliage. You're glowing like a damned red beacon."
"Well, yeah. I did sit with her. And walked her to her next class, but that's not who I ran into. It was the associate professor I'm going to be working with for the work study program," John had blurted out. "Along with Sebastian Moran. But he wasn't there...I mean I didn't run into Moran, only the associate professor. The one I'm going to be working with." John bit his lip. Why was he suddenly so tongue tied? "He's English too, well, Moran is,
“My only choice was to hide myself inside one of the twelve chambers of varied sizes that were neatly lined up in the laboratory. I hid in the smallest. I locked myself inside the air-tight isolation containment chamber, a remnant of my family's legacy, sealing myself inside. I held onto the hope that way they would not know I was inside, but they didn’t leave. I continued to hear the banging and muffled shouts as they searched.”
Sherlock sighs at the cliché comment, but agrees, more for John than for himself. He’s not completely sure John’s reluctance is about Sherlock. John has lost so much. He risks losing it all again if he puts his lot in with Sherlock.
"We can make it a game," John suggests, picking up the cords.
, he thinks. Of course.
“She’s dead. I saw her body at the morgue. It was her in the casket.
He leans on John as William shakes his head at him. “I can't stand being here.”
Sherlock paced the cabin floor. It was his habit of late. James and the others had tried to turn John against him. James had tried to manipulate John’s memories and thoughts and feelings. Most likely using suggestions in the beginning with Mary and Moran. Then hypnosis. Sherlock realized it the moment he saw James’ tapping. He wondered how much and how often they had tried to alter John’s memories, to manipulate him.
John’s eyes fly open. “I wouldn’t go that far. What kind of line of questioning is this?” he asks, then chooses to ignore her by turning his head toward the window and watch the countryside.
John snorts and raises his eyebrow.
John sat down hard in the desk chair. The enticing scent of pastrami made his stomach growl. He pushed the bag of sandwiches away to the other side of the desk.
When his true love follows Joe in his new body, Sherlock wondered if there was something in his eyes as well.
He dug his fingers into the tree bark, getting his breath under control. In a blink, he was there. That man. The right height. He could see he had light hair. His features were obscured in the gloom of the night, yet there he was, touchable and real. He stepped closer. Sherlock's body yearned and trembled to be consumed.
“Mr. Crenshaw says he has no appointment scheduled for you,” says the male receptionist. His hair is thinning and the comb over makes him look ten years older. “To what is this in regard?”
“What do you want the most? For Christmas?” Sherlock gasps, leaning closer to John’s ear. “Name it. Anything.”
“I’m doing what you asked,” Sherlock said. He stepped directly into Moriarty’s space.
“You said you didn’t know we were going to be roommates,” John finally said.
Sherlock closes his eyes. He’s trapped in the backseat with nothing to do except pick at the sleek dark rental car’s seat, which is certain to piss off Anthea. The sky is as grey as his own soul at the moment. He could talk to her. Find out more. Assess her. Deconstruct her. He doesn’t recall anything in his rooms about her at all other than she was an assistant to Mycroft. She is a name with no face, that’s all. The information is either not there, or the room is locked to him.
“Disguised? How?” John leans back in his chair.
“Mary didn’t have to worry about that since Eurus told us to only see the blood and Mary’s face. All that blood. It’s never like that when someone’s shot, but we ignored that.”
A deep moan escapes Sherlock as John strokes him, twisting and pulling. Tight heat, perfect pressure make Sherlock long toes curl and flex in time with John’s attentions.
“What now?”
John sighs as he knocks on Beca’s door. Although John doesn’t feel in his soul Sherlock’s moving out is final, John’s heart feels like its been replaced by a stone with his absence. He’s lost a best friend— or a least the nearest thing he’s had to one. He doesn’t look forward to going home to an empty flat.
"Because she wasn't who you thought she was."
Sherlock bit his tongue. Maybe if John wore one. Truth be told, he’d rather see him out of the uniform.
Over the last few days Sherlock has settled in nicely to John’s moods and rhythms. He loves reading with him by the fireplace in the evenings. When John’s at hospital, Sherlock has replayed in his mind palace John’s uppercut to Mycroft’s face. Each time he does, it has the most curious effect on him. He’s thinking of just that moment when John speaks.
Captain Obvious hands John the letter, and John's stomach drops when he recognizes the handwriting on the envelope.
“He still isn’t rubbish at it, it seems.”
“That’s better, but I’m still fucking cold,” Moran said, jerking Sherlock toward the rocking chair. His fingers dug into Sherlock’s shoulder as he forced Sherlock down to his knees in front of the chair.
“The whole meeting in the aquarium was staged to make sure they had plenty of reliable witnesses. They knew I would be right there … and you would come.”
“Really?”
“Hope you don’t mind, but I asked Gregory Lestrade to do some checking.” John leans on the counter. “Want some toast?”
"Hello?" she called again. "Hello?"
He washes up. He should be hungry, but he’s not.
"Don't be daft." He actually began to pull me along by the front of my jacket toward the old manor.

force.
"She's messing with you," Sherlock says. "Mary isn't anywhere near here."
“You’re saying that your brother put it there. In your room. That would mean...”
A violent tug of my hair brings me back. This time the pain does not cloud my senses, it heightens them. It all floods back, how I got here, where I am.
John shook his head. He didn’t ask why Sherlock would do it because he didn’t understand, he asked because he didn’t think Sherlock did it. Either he wasn’t dead or someone killed him. Sherlock didn’t jump. John didn’t believe that for a minute.
He hates to hit a woman, but he does. It's mostly reflex—he actually didn't intend to, but she jabbed him. He's almost out of her grasp when the second woman trips him and pushes him down. His knees slam into the pavement.
"It should be some sort of fantasy we could actually have some fun with," John suggests. "We could pretend that I am an alpha, you are an omega. You've just gone unexpectedly into heat, and I'm forced to knot you."
“You said there would only be four of them,” Mycroft says.
"It's called Michigan, the Great Lakes State—advertised as such on every license plate on every vehicle in this state. And I did no such thing! He followed me."
Worried that talking about Eurus without proper rest may well send Sherlock into a spiral, John’s reluctance is visible. He hesitates.
He'd read a book once on dreams and it said that dreams about sex really weren't about sex. He didn't believe it. Over the last few days, he'd thought about that reoccurring dream dozens of times. And about sex. With Sherlock. How could that be good? It was a bit not good, if you asked him.
him in the long term
"He said he told you two years ago that he'd been offered an associate professor position here," John answered.
It went to him.
“I would love to, but I drew the short stick and had to work here, so I could get the pleasure of seeing you sign the papers and toss your skinny little arse out of here.” Sister Katherine hands him the forms. “Not fast enough, if you ask me.” As she explains his home care instructions, Will gives an exaggerated sigh. “Keep rolling those eyes, and maybe you’ll find your brain inside there somewhere! You are like a child! Open your ears! You need to listen,” she says.
“I am so, so sorry. Really I am. The donations your brother Mycroft made were so generous, those of your wealthy following padded my pockets nicely, but not enough to make up for what  you’ve cost me on the streets. I was thinking of quitting my day job until you and John Watson decided to become such good ‘mates.’ I thought you might be around. But I never dreamed you walk right through my office door.”
“I probably should let Beca know I’m not coming in today,” John says.
He walked into the psychology building and went to the main reception office where the adorable Miss Stephanie handed him today's stack of folders and his job for the day. He’d have to be dead not to notice her. Hourglass figure, five foot two, eyes of blue, and she was always, always ready with a shining smile. It lit up the lobby. Everyone smiled back at her.
Like father, like daughter.
“You might not recall, but I do prefer calling or speaking in person, especially since there is much more to discuss. Now that you’ve cleaned this room proper, we can talk,” says Mycroft as he wipes off the kitchen chair with his hanky before sitting down.
She sits quietly for a bit, staring down at him.
“Maybe it’s both,” she suggests. “The world is messed up. I’m surprised more people don’t walk around without memories. I sure would love to forget the last two years.” The nurses at the desk listening in on their conversation nod in agreement
"And what?" Lestrade is watching him again. Must have heard something in John's tone.
“I thought this was a fitting place to meet,” she laughs.
"Let us out," I demanded.
“What? When were you planning to tell me this?”
If her clothing choices weren't enough to scare the dead, her vacant eyes and clammy handshake were. Sherlock introduced us and her surname was, indeed, Frankenstein. Her first name was Marilyn.
Oh, only four chapters left! We're getting closer and closer to our conclusion. This is exciting. This chapter begins  a bit differently from others. Our boys are happy and comfortable with each other (if you know what I mean). Maybe too comfortable because we all know just when you sit down and feel all safe and secure...
Sherlock came out of the mind palace.
There are still times I want to call him Willie like his Mum. I’m glad he’s here. It makes the place feel more like a home.
“We gain her confidence,” Sherlock sighs, putting on a bored face. “We find her connection to Pandora. We find out what she knows about Mycroft that leads her to believe he caused it. We stop her from killing again.”
“The victim is fastidious to a compulsive degree, yet he walked in his stocking feet. Where are his shoes?” Sherlock says, waving his arms above his head. “A button missing from off his sleeve? Must be recent. He has meticulously mended this shirt, quite expertly, here and here,” he says, pointing to two buttons. “Look at the thread, it does not match the other buttons. While the color is perfect, the fibers are less fine.”
“He said you should call me Ruth.”
“A respectable one-thousand hits in the first hour. I attribute it to the tags I added, but since then, people have shared, and you’re at over six thousand. Oh, now over seven!” Sherlock points to screen.
Sherlock makes shapeless sounds. It’s good. So good. Sherlock feels his internal muscles clamp down. He’s trying his best to relax, but can’t. John rubs his tummy with free hand, like he’s soothing him as he adds a two fingers instead of his thumb. It works.
Miss Adler visibly stifles laugh as one of the women grabs John's left arm and yanks it painfully back and up between his shoulder blades. In a blink, the motion is followed by a sharp stab in his thigh by the woman with the daisy tattoo.
William doesn’t understand why John wants to live with him, but for now, accepting his offer is the better choice. Not only is it more appealing than returning to his attic, but moving in with him is the best way to gather more data about what John's motivations may be.
His answer was, what if the files aren’t bogus? He’s gone through them over and over. He can find nothing that makes him believe they are not official.
At least they let me up topside now, even though I've threatened to jump overboard on more than one occasion. Why should I let them have all the fun?
I sigh as I put on my coat and scarf. I take a cab to the crime scene. It’s in a large three-story home in the Hampstead Garden suburb not far from the bird sanctuary. Police are fanned out in the front garden, taping it off to keep reporters from poking in. I duck through and go inside.
Sherlock takes his right hand from John's hip and cradles the back of John's neck. His other hand slips inside his swim trunks. The moment his fingers find John's cock, John groans. Sherlock wraps his fingers around him.
“It’s so hard to get things done in the limelight,” Mycroft bemoans. “It all went to Hell, when I became a public figure. It fell on me to run the country—  I’ve always preferred to work behind the scenes, pulling the metaphorical strings. As soon as I knew I could no longer hide behind a wall of anonymity, I had to seek other means to go about covertly.”
“You don’t understand. It’s
He goes in quietly— although he’s sure Mrs. Hudson has already seen him with Anthea in the black sedan. No doubt she’ll tell John when he gets home. He climbs the stairs and opens the door with his key.
He’s on the third floor when John notices an attractive woman walking down the hall ahead of him. She’s got long red hair, a bit unkempt, wearing a pastel-colored paisley dress with blue hospital slippers. Her dress is a bit tight in the bum, and she has a nice curve. John has to admit, he doesn’t usually go for women this much taller than him, but her bum is pretty cute the way its swaying back and forth when she walks. If he had more time, he’d stop and chat.
"No one you consort with does, but there are a few good Samaritans left in the world. He is one."
need to know,” Sherlock interrupts. “I need him to know. We will tell John it all. We have determined how to set the trap,” Sherlock begins as he turns to John.
Sherlock can feel everything as John buries himself inside. Sherlock trembles. He feels like he could be on an edge, but knows he’s not. Not yet. He feels as if he’s falling, down, down, down, heat and flames and blood rushing with white-hot heat before his very eyes. John moves inside him, and he’s brilliant. It’s better than any high he’s ever felt, and he’s beyond pleasure. What do you call a place like this? There’s nothing in his mind palace to tell him what this bliss is. Indescribable, undefinable, exquisite.
Impossible. That would require a decrease in entropy and violate the second law of thermodynamics. While I have always believed that laws were meant to be broken or at least twisted, this law cannot be broken: I go forward from the point at which I am.
“Discreetly, I might add,” says Greg. “In light what’s been revealed about your brother no matter how erroneous it is, there are still people who believe that rubbish. Consulting detective, is it? Interesting occupation.”
He was...yes. John had to be...wanking off in his sleep. And he wasn't one of those who jerked off sloppy and spasmodic. Slow and steady.
She looked up from her note.
He had promised John he wouldn’t lie to him again. This was the worst lie possible.
John stops. "We?" He scratches his chin. It was time to think about shaving. "Really. You and Mycroft? Greg? "
“It’s a cocktail,” he says to her. He needs to know of what drugs. His mind has found twenty-five possible combinations, but he can’t narrow down the data.
“Not with that thing in his head yer not.”
John scanned the list. Rifle, shells, rope, hunting knife.
“You need to rest. I’ll sit here.” He smiles, taking the chair next to my bed. “I don’t know if I could trust myself if I crawled in next to you.”
No, he didn't have to do this, but John knew he would. He wanted this, needed this—his mind and body yearned for this moment—it filled him, waking, and sleeping.
"And then there's the tedious job of keeping track of your fiancée..." She rolls her eyes and waves away several more mosquitoes.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says.
I knelt down to inspect the hair. Sherlock held up a bit of ripped flesh between his tweezers with his gloved hands. He bagged it and zipped the top with a flourish. How does he do that? He makes collecting evidence into some sort of game of being cool.
“You need to go, Mom. I’ll be fine.”
I attempt to sit up, and he gently pushes me back, his wedding band cool against my chest. Missing mate. I ponder on it. He is unattached, hence the intoxicating pheromones washing over me. Not divorced or separated, therefore, deceased.
"Then why was he there a full two months before you arrived for the summer session? I fail to see your connection with this."
"I know you are concerned that it may be Mary. Let me put your mind to rest. It is not."
“As if you care,” Sophy moans.
John winces and looks away from his fellow widower. Ever since the plague it’s considered fairly crude to make remarks about anyone's family, but people who run cities don't have to think about such things, he supposes. "Well."
____________
He knew it was past midnight, but he could practice a bit, quietly.
“What are you talking about?”
a sister!”
After snapping them around to get John's attention, he began with deft butterfly cuts before he rapidly shuffled them, flicking and flipping the cards between his fingers.
“John,” Sherlock whispered. This was a nightmare.
“Over the last weeks after I found out who I was, I searched for information about Sherlock Holmes. I could never find as much about myself as Mycroft. More curious was that although I found secondary references, such as mentions in private blogs, I found none of my personal accounts. I remember why now. Those were scrubbed from Twitter, Facebook, all social media. Mycroft did most of it. Stories from defunct news agencies were deleted. A few articles regarding me that were shared remained online— all of which would be impossible to expunge. But Mycroft’s machinations couldn’t account for every deletion...”
John swirls the last of his cold coffee in the cup before he gulps it down with a grimace. His stare out the Starbuck's window is vacant as people buzz like bees back and forth to work and appointments. He plops the cup on the table with a sigh and stretches his aching legs out straight beneath the table. He's not certain how Sherlock managed to convince him that he needs to relax. He's never sure with Sherlock, but it certainly wasn't at Mary's insistence.
He’s out of the loo and the git it sitting on the couch folded up as tight as some of the scrub he wears. John takes a seat across from him in his usual plaid wingback, hands clutching the arm cushions. He looks down at his lap, thinking. He’s still half awake, but he conscious of Will’s intense eyes on him. It’s hard to look into their depths and see such pain and confusion.
John shrugs. “Come on, follow me.”
“I was wondering how you were.”
He'd missed getting his heart racing. A motor service station where perverts got off seemed the answer. Just the sort of thing Sherlock missed. Excitement! Although in all likelihood, the only real peril was possible arrest or getting beaten senseless by some local, either for money or for fun. At least he'd get some sex. Not as good as investigating a murder, but it'd do in a pinch.
Sherlock pulled a small spray bottle dispenser from his pocket and tossed it to John.
“I knew you remembered.” She’s blinking and looking over John’s shoulder at Sherlock. “But not it all. Or else.”
“Didn’t Markham say something about swans being homosexual?” John asks.
John slid closer, till their knees touched. Sherlock's heart beat faster. His breath caught in his throat. Their knees were still touching as he flipped over the last card.
I prepare myself for his possible reaction. He destroyed the USB and told Mary her past was her business, but her future was his privilege. What will John do if I tell him that she planned to leave him?
“Oh fuck,” John says, as Sherlock begins to move inside him, slow calculated strokes at first, but progressing, lengthening into a long, deep tidal motion.
He took my hand and crawled out so quickly that I wondered if all the shivering and shaking had been an act. I pulled him up.
they are. A person needs to have a
“He carries an umbrella everywhere he goes. He says it’s in case it rains. That’s what he tells everyone. He
The reference to the swans is curious. Irene’s password? My name? A warning of what may come? Eurus knew so much about me. Secluded away, her time spent living vicariously watching what happened outside while kept in isolation. That’s not living. Did she deserve that fate? She was dangerous. She’d killed, burned Musgrave, our family home, with no remorse.
John clenches his fist, breaking the thought. He was about to write down. Again. This is no good. He's already written about how his wife and daughter died. He's gone over and over the sixteen chaotic days from when Mary first developed symptoms to when Rosie was taken away with Mary to one of the designated quarantine facilities. He wants to remember and write about the good in their lives. He starts to type again when he realizes he'd forgotten what Mary called Rosie's stuffed lamb. How could he forget?
“Fascinating. Envy is at work here. Not Mary’s,
“He came here? Yesterday? I thought he didn’t want to come here because he thought he’d be recognized.”
The knot in his groin said yes, he would. John shifted his beat-up Camero into third as he merged with the traffic.
"I doubt you have a signal." John sits up a bit more.
Moran roughly shoved Sherlock toward the fireplace, hobbling behind him. His boot left bloody puddles across the floor.
The call again.
They walk toward the apartment with the crates. As John unlocks the door, Will bounces with excitement, and when John opens the door, he takes up the stairs two at a time and waits at the top for John  They enter John’s living room, and he drops his crate and strides to the old comfy couch. He forgets the cards and magic and spins around then flops down on it like he owns it, taking the Union Jack pillow in his hands and pressing it to his chest. He stands back up and jumps on top of the chair’s seat cushions, staring at the wall.
"You took evidence to spare him from conviction."
Despite the growing evidence, I found it difficult to believe that Sherlock would pick such an unlikely spot for a tryst. Why not a warm room? With a bed? Even a locked broom closet would be better than this.
"It's about time you told me why we're here. I'm not taking another step until you do," I said as we continued walking through an old graveyard on our way to the manor. Why the place was even moated! All we needed now was the ghost of Ann Radcliffe to waltz out and greet us.
As they followed the gory trail and hastened toward the long, ramshackle of a building, Moriarty demonstrated to Sherlock his profile of the murderer. He spun around in circles with the grace of a ballet dancer, his flowing gestures refining each deduction.
John tries his best not to tug too hard on his bindings, but this is driving him around the bend. Sherlock continues by going back up to his cock and running the edges of his teeth gently over the tip. John does his best not to giggle, but can’t suppress it.
"It has always been my goal to perform as deftly as I play violin. Both are much like languages but instead of our mouths, we use the hands. You understand. It's the same with your guitar when you run through your blues progression."
They tell me they're about to drop me off on a small island. That's deserted. But not to worry! One of the crew (the only one who speaks English is the one who has been with me since the beginning, Irene Adler's strong-arm with the daisy tattoo) tells me a sailboat is docked there all ready to be my own personal luxury hotel. Which, by the way, she told me isn't sea-worthy. Bloody hell. She said the island is a paradise and a beautiful place for a honeymoon. Ironic since oh, that's right. I'M NOT GOING ON ONE. My bride is going to be left standing at the altar because of you unless you get your plotting arse in gear and come get me out of here.
“I thought
I was also rutting against him. I could feel my cock leaking against his hand.
“I’m going to kiss you,” John says.
“You are not to blame for any of this,” I say. “Put it out of your mind.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m sitting on the edge of the tub taking down my trousers when he returns. He’s brought two towels and a couple of flannels.
A sudden bang came from the floor beneath the rocking chair where Moran sat. He still held the gun on Sherlock, studying his every move. Then another thud against the wall near the fireplace.
“As expected.”
When I replied I’d clean them, she rolled her eyes and climbed off the chair, immediately foisting the window cleaner and a chamois into my hands. After, she crossed her arms and tapped her toe, expecting me to begin.
This chapter continues on with my fix it for the aquarium scene and delves into Mary's part in it all.
John clears his throat and grimaces. It is, he supposes. Most is about what happens at hospital. Often mundane entries. Memories of what he did day to day with Mary and Rosie. He suddenly doesn’t understand why he was so worried. It’s not like Will can’t just look at him and decipher what he wants to know.
“He called me shorty!”
“I don’t believe you.”
He returns to the laptop. He tells himself he’s not disturbed. She knows he has a dependency on drugs. She knows the damage it’s done to him. She also knows enough about Sherlock that he doesn’t give a damn about that either. Or so he likes to tell himself. She knows that too. He gets access and reads the trials and errors from the “experiments” alluded to in the files he read downstairs that Sophy so generously gave him. What he learns from her laptop tells Sherlock she has as little regard for human life as he does.
They row to the island across the long, pale sandbank until they come to a channel. John watches a fifteen foot shark swim by them. Nice place, he thinks. The channel is long and the tropical trees and plants are dense on both sides. It's like a jungle, or what John imagines a jungle would be. Hot and sticky. The channel opens into another large lagoon. The water deepens. They point to a modest-sized sail boat with two masts moored to a long rickety wooden deck made of boards salvaged from shipping crates and driftwood.
“The movie
Mike is knocking at the door, and John hollers for him to come in while Sherlock rummages through his mind and John’s pants drawer as to what he’s to do. What is the best approach to capture John’s interest? How is he to set Mycroft’s name right? Does John ever wear these red pants? Should he let John help him clear his brother’s name? Why should he even care to help Mycroft? John wants him to care. Sherlock is surprised to realise that he cares as well. He would also like to see John in the red pants.
He’d hurt them all. It doesn’t have to be with a gun or a knife. Just as easily be with hurtful words and deeds. He believes it.
“Ever the BAMF, standing guard,” I say and almost tell him to go to bed, that I’ll be fine. But he would stubbornly stay. He also needs to talk. He never talks. I figured when a BAMF finally has to say it, he just does it.
*So call me crazy but Mark Gatiss has always reminded me of John Gielgud.
“Are you going to tell me what that was all about?” John asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It would have been nice to let me know what you’d planned,” John says with a groan, then looks up at Sherlock with a pained smirk.
John Watson thinks. He licks his lips.
“That wasn't the reason.”
“We do. Although killed at another location, the body was found at his workplace,” Sherlock explains to Beca. “We confirmed what Molly determined immediately; he did not die of natural causes. Since he had a history of heart disease and had a heart attack in his office prior, co-workers assumed he had had a heart attack. There’s extensive damage to the heart— old and new. While the strangulation triggered a heart attack, he died from asphyxiation.”
“You said you wrote some of this as a joke to mess with John’s head? The poor bloke! We need to talk more about your people skills, but you do have John’s voice down well. I can’t tell what’s yours and what’s John’s. You could be a ghost writer.”
“The killer didn’t wear gloves?” John asks, thinking that would be the easiest way to administer it.
"We left her without options. She had no choice but to take the offer, considering the alternative."
Success.
So it was true. He did what Moriarty asked. This was his doing.
Sherlock hears John’s name uttered from his own mouth like he’s outside himself. John comes, pulses in his ass, but when his brain realizes what the rest of his body already knows, his orgasm: beautiful, slow, and powerful.
“You’ve got to be kidding,” John said.
“Where
He's avoiding her question, is all the answer she needs. She smiles wide. “I know my son. He repeated Mycroft’s words ‘caring is not an advantage’ so long and so hard that he thought he believed them. What happened with his sister as a child changed him. He withdrew more and more. It changed my eldest son also. He became harder.” She pats John’s hands. “But Willie, he never did become that way deep down. He’s always cared. As you said, he is a romantic at heart although he refuses to acknowledge this. He feels it’s too dangerous to care, but if anything, he cares too deeply. That is why he forgot his sister. You are right, Dr. Watson— that’s why he can’t remember who he is now. The weight of the world took his memory from him. He needs someone to return it, to make him whole. I think you are the man who will help my son return it, along with his heart.”
She took his coat, and hung it up on a hook next to her own blue jean jacket.
questions. It’s only been 24 hours, but he’s as overcome as she is.
“Next time you come to visit me, bring my Willie with you.” She kisses his cheek.
They pass one of the bungalows that are scattered about the island. They must not be far from the airstrip now.
“The one named Anderson. You should dismiss him immediately. And Donovan? She lowers the IQ of everyone in your entire laboratory.”
John rolled out of his bed in frustration. Feet planted on the floor, he stretched up to see a Sherlock Holmes, flat on his back with his eyes peacefully shut and fingers angelically steepled under his chin.
On to other more pressing issues. Sherlock spins around and inspects John’s dresser.
. That's where I got the name for the ketch. There were shipwrecks on the reefs here. They were believed to have buried their booty of silver and gold stolen from Incan temples somewhere on this island. The story has it that all of them died but for one survivor."
"She is in South America. Mycroft made certain."
There's no need to be quiet, no need to hide from the world. No need to cover his mouth to stifle
And when you’re done with my laptop, please turn it off and recharge it. Thank you.
As the cab rounds the drive to the front of the Holmes estate, John can’t take his eyes off Sherlock’s face. While Sherlock does his best to suppress his smile, it’s not working. His lips keep curling up at the corners and his silver-green eyes sparkle like the white twinkle lights winding through the evergreen garlands surrounding the entrance to their family home.
Unless this letter isn't from Sherlock and it's some sort of ruse instead. The Woman is clever. She could easily find someone to forge a letter.
He's had so much water these last few days he hasn't been thirsty. But now he is more thirsty than he's ever been in his life. These lips, this mouth, that tongue. He must drink them in.
The man foists his clenched fist into my face. He opens his fat, bruised hand to reveal a small stone in the center of his chaffed palm—a piece of white-grained granite to be precise. The distracting magic of its sparkle makes me forget my dilemma and my suffering. Mica, quartz, and feldspar winkle until my vision begins to whirl and blur like an exploding supernova.
John blinked. He should have known. Sure she liked John—but her interest was in Sherlock, not him. Now he understood the dress and pink lip gloss. John also supposed she just didn't happen to be sitting near the door at the auditorium: she was waiting for John purely to ask about Sherlock.
are."
“I need you,” John says, and his whole body shivers in agreement.
“Evening,” John read from a note in his hand.
“You said ‘you think.’ You never just think something, you know it.”
He sweats, thinking about how he actually joked about her shooting Sherlock through the heart. It could have happened. She could still do it.
“You know exactly what that means.”
John half-smiles at the tired non-joke. "Heard that one before. So you'll be trying to find out who he is?"
John decides the best way to get Sherlock to explain is to state the opposite. “There is no compromise,” John says.
He’s already making coffee when I stumble into the kitchen.
“Oh, I do want it, but not for the reasons you think.”
Sherlock stares out into the shimmering lagoon, but shifts closer to John. The nearly-full moon casts their shadows into the water below.
“Not funny,” I say, crossing my arms. “You may as well come all the way inside.”
Sherlock flinches. John leans closer, reaches for Sherlock’s other hand and holds it tight.
Our captive’s mouth opens and shuts. He looks more like a fish out of water gasping for breath than a bat. Or a kitty. I continue.
This simply can not happen. Rosie lives here with us. Lunatics are no longer allowed in our flat. Especially lunatics dressed in black tights, hood, and cape.
“Tanks,” Sherlock murmurs.
Did I say it? Another cliffhanger ending...and BAMF John to the rescue!
“I cannot fathom why Mrs. Hudson would allow this...
Only one more chapter, then the epilogue. At the beginning of the week when revising this chapter, I went in thinking of how to add to what our vision was for the ending of this story. We'd written this last summer, but revised much as we went, changing basic premises and points in the plot. As the story progressed, it's called for a lot more revision. All for the better.
“You’ve been doing well these last couple of days. No headache,” John says, setting his fork onto his plate. “The less stress you’re under, the faster you’ll heal.”
The cabin windows are crusted with salt, but sun manages to shine through. There's a generator for power and some petrol along with extra propane.
“Tut, tut! So bossy. And we’re not even in bed together!” James shot Sherlock a wilted smile.
Molly and Mike steal uncomfortable glances at John.
The cream interior of the mezzanine grates at Sherlock. It’s not just the clean, pointless color. Not that Sherlock thinks a building should have a personality, but nothing has been altered. The decor is unchanged from the photos Sherlock saw before Pandora. Between the ivory pillars, behind an equally off-white front desk, sits a man and a woman. He can work with them.
“Or not kill, isn’t that right?”
He’s cautious. He tacitly moves through Cardiff’s streets. He avoids attention. His years as a soldier, moving stealthily from building to building come back to him. He’s at Sherlock’s old bolt hole and makes his way inside, up the stairs and to the closest entrance to his attic. He knocks and calls out in a low voice. No answer. At first. Then he hears a scratching and clawing. He calls again and another scratch returns. It’s not locked. He pushes the trapdoor open. A meow? Sherlock has as cat? But that also means...John’s eye catches a movement on the cushion in the corner.
"There will come a time when you can't ignore it. I may be able to get some of those rare elements."
I am his and he is mine. He opens his mouth. His tongue is my center.
Then it all goes to black.
It’s scary to be in love. Terrifying. You have to put faith and trust in someone else. But he is. God, he is. He hopes that Sherlock can forgive himself.
"I'm afraid we're talking about a blood seal removal. Either way, I need an alchemist, and I can’t do it here," Dr. Watson says.
Almost.
“Yes. There was an enormous amount of your blood at the scene. We feared they dumped your body into the bay. We searched.”
“Sit,” he orders.
"So when do you think you can get this from Beca?" she asks as her hand brushes against the bench next to her.
"Mmm. Salty," Sherlock says after a moment. He tests the head of his cock with another long lick. "Very salty. And what goes with salty, captain?" He reaches across John and snatches the bowl of ice cream off the nightstand. He takes a generous dripping spoonful and holds it just above the tip of John's leaking cock.
John thinks he really doesn’t need this much attention. It’s not so bad. Swab his side with antiseptic, a few stitches, a plaster, and send him on his way. Sherlock, however, doesn’t seem to think so: he’s hovering. He reluctantly lets go of John’s hand one finger at a time as Art takes his vitals. When Lestrade says he needs to speak to Sherlock, he doesn’t want to leave John’s side, but John waves them away.
John isn't up to thinking too hard about a Sherlock Holmes who watches him skinny dipping in a lagoon. He's not sure what to make of it all as he struggles with the bottle. "I can't unscrew this blasted cap."
"And the body?" Sherlock asked.
“Much more. You can leave the dishes. I can do them later.”
And swans, I think. My eyes lift to reach for John’s blue depths. They meet. He’s swallowing rapidly.
“You, my little brother, provided me with the answer. Your disappearance proved advantageous. Once I knew you were safe and in hiding, I did the same. Beyond recall, as it were. I am so sorry to have caused you…”
he hates getting wet.” She sighs.
John is aware that he was leaping to possibly faulty conclusions, perhaps indulging too much in unkind thoughts about Mark Pelham and his apparent ability to forget, while defending his family while other people heartily wished that they still had families to defend. And perhaps judging Will (why was he "Will" so quickly, anyway?) too gently, reading too much into his seeming otherworldliness.
"You are not alone, are you little brother?" Mycroft said. "Keeping it from your new roommate. Tisk, tisk. Sherlock, this is no way to begin a relationship," Mycroft chided.
I reach out and give his hand a squeeze.
Aw, yes, now I remember him. He is my captor, and I, only tender for him to lend and spend. He's yanking my head, twisting it around like a cruel child would to as he or she removes a doll's head.
John spits in his hand then grasps Sherlock. “Fucking beautiful cock you have too.”
Then he sees the confirmation that she’s within the third building. A lighter flickers. A man lighting a cigarette, but the repeat one, two, three flicks count out in three-quarter time.
The muscle holding Sherlock’s fingers twitches as Sherlock’s tongue lathers the area.
. John said that lies are easier to believe with a bit of truth attached. From all that Will recalls, he’s never trusted. At least not until John. He knows he doesn’t trust Helena Smith. He’s not sure about this person calling herself Anthea either. Her veiled threats against John didn’t win Will’s trust at all.
About
Sherlock had taken his hand off John's knee and picked up the prescription bottle that John had left on the bed.
. She is asleep on the last page. I tuck the blankets under her chin, kiss her forehead, then decide to look over a few cases Lestrade gave me.
“Cool! I’ll give you a ring and let you know when.”
, he thinks, recalling a poem:
“Greg. His name is Greg Lestrade.”
. Except not. She walks around the bed and lifts the sheet. She plucks the mobile from his feeble hand.
My head shot up, but not before noticing the clotted hair next to the leg of the butcher block. I pointed to it.
“No, you didn’t,” John snaps.
I release him as John asks him why he's dressed like this, and the man flips around, hiking up his tights as he does. “They thought it was funny and wouldn’t let me change!”
My heart-rate speeds up and the monitor beeps erratically. Doctor Watson brows furrow.
She’s set it up so well, too. But he’s done better, or so he hopes. He knew she’d never miss the opportunity gloat over besting Sherlock Holmes.
“Oi! I do my bit. And ‘dated’ is a stretch.”
John thought.
It’s dark without intermittent street lights although a waning moon helps. Figures hidden catch his eye like fireflies. Some to the right of him, some to the left. He’s counting, assessing. Some are the homeless network, pretending to laze about, others are Sophy’s men. Since he’s slipped through her fingers once before, she’s brought plenty of support. He’s certain she’s already waiting inside, the same way he’s certain she was there when he lost his memory.
“I still have my cane. I use it to keep the closet propped open. I could dig out and lend it to you.”
It’s always something.
Later in the cab, Sherlock opens it. He shows John, who smiles. It’s yellowed and torn at the corner, but in Mycroft’s young hand, it’s clearly labeled
"John, never fear: of course I shall share with you."
I really didn’t think he was that much of a threat, but I do like the idea of John and ropes.
"More than willing. He said you had an addiction."
“It’s the purse,” he says.
I've decided to try going without the cane for a bit, after not noticing I'd run up the fire escape without it.
After Molly calls Lestrade, they eviscerate the body and remove the main organs and dissect the heart using Davidson’s technique. Sherlock cuts the ventricles transversely to have the view of endocardium, its color is normal, but there are scars and fibrosis evident. After over an hour examining the body, Molly and Sherlock reconstitute the deceased and wash, dry, then rewrap the organs in a fresh shroud.
“Dick.” Norbury punctuates his feelings for me with the butt of the Glock to my head.
“Nothing.” Lestrade shifts in his chair. “Have you?” Lestrade asks pointedly.
“Or searching...” John suggests. “I wasn’t just running— I was searching. For something new. You could be too.” He’s pleased when Will stops to ponder the possibility.  "
Sherlock immediately stepped back, relieved that he had the remote, but instead of angry, James was pleased. John's mouth opened in shock.
He wants to know where she is. At least she's intelligent.
“I should think a remote cabin on a lake in the woods is preferable. All this for John Watson.”
He can hardly believe he’s here after all these years. He’s happy to share it with John. Over the last months, numerous cases Lestrade has shared with them have been eventful. John has continued with his blog and although Sherlock likes teasing John about his case entries, he dearly loves John’s romantic sentiments. He’s certain this adventure, or at least some part of it, will find its way into his blog.
But I’m continuing down. I’m sinking, and sinking fast. My coat. I see nothing, only feel. It’s eerily white behind my eyes along with the pain in my chest. I love my coat, but it needs to be gone. Now. I inhale, and water drags through my lungs. It’s more agonizing than the shot to my chest. It’s a struggle not to panic and drink in more as the flashes of past torture threathen to overcome me. My underwater hell begins switching off the light and going black. I am filled with sudden regrets. My heart. I will never be able to tell John what’s in my heart. I hope he knows. I hope he understands.
are still wearing those gastly scrubs!”
“It should stay here. On the island.” Sherlock smooths out the sand then pats the top. “Maybe some pirate will dig it up someday. Or...”
The only solution was to take the evidence. Months passed and Moriarty did nothing.
John would say.
“It was just across the street here,” he had said. “So much pointless death.”
Moran snarled, but obeyed and awkwardly patted the top of Sherlock’s head, while his other hand nudged his gun so the muzzle scraped the back of his skull.
"The sand. It will get in everything," John says when they surface for a breath. "
“I’d like like to see his room, but not because I’m not convinced.” He winks, and this brings a smile to her face so much like Sherlock’s that his chest feels tight. He misses him and he’s worried. Before they go up to Sherlock’s room, she makes him more tea with delicious homemade scones that would put Mrs. Hudson to shame. They talk about his work as a doctor. Later as they climb the stairs to Sherlock’s room, she asks him how much her son remembers.
"The killer knew his victim well and intimately," Moriarty explained to Sherlock. "Splitting her in half was to disassociate himself. For him, it was about separating his seething lust from his chaste love. I find the whole Madonna/whore complex lacks creativity, but, to each his own."
“I’m afraid I had a disagreement with my roommate.”
So with a tear in my eye, I end this story. I have two Fandom Trumps Hate stories to write and another longer work that I started. I don’t think I’ll write another “by the seat of my pants” story again for a while. My next long work is plotted out completely, but only the first chapter is written. I hope to begin publishing it by the end of the summer.
“John, please view is as such: your blog is working. Soon those responsible for the horrors brought upon the world will come to justice.”
Then the alarm goes off in the building.
John wonders why Sherlock has waited to bring this up. Why wait until they were in the middle of the most heavily-forested part of the island to ask him this when he could have asked while they were shut in the boat during that monsoon of a downpour?
“I certainly do. For medicine.”
"You can't honestly believe that."
It all added up and the improbable became the most probable solution. Fate or no, his clandestine encounter was his roommate.
I do need more time in case I can’t get the gun.
“Please, John.” He lies Sherlock down on the couch and scoots next to him thigh-to-thigh. John fumbles at the waist of his trousers. It’s an odd angle, but he manages. He gets the button open and pulls the flies just far enough to get his hand inside. Sherlock's cock twitches beneath his fingers.
Mycroft believes I have gone insane. Maybe I have, but I heard John’s voice, or I thought it was his voice. It’s coming from the homeless man who now sits in John’s chair. He’s wearing John’s old tattered tartan dressing gown and ugly slippers. He’s drinking black coffee from John’s chipped Army mug.
I feel tears threatening to leak out.
“What
"But Mary did agree. How did you get him to drop it?" John notices Sherlock's shoulders have tensed and his jaw twitches. "I don't understand."
Sherlock doesn’t answer directly. “The owner wished to remain anonymous and wanted to make certain the island would remain open to the public and preserved as it is for future generations. No buildings allowed. Ever.”
"But John..."
I am happy he knows how I feel.
“I see Sherlock was put in charge of teaching the cat manners,” Mycroft sneers.
“Yes, yes. I promise.”
Sherlock blinks when he hears John clear his throat.
. Later, when times weren't so good, he had to settle for a job at the local Dairy Queen, working with his sister. He'd helped Harry get hired there. Harry could make a mean hot-fudge sundae and Mr. Wilson, the owner, treated John as a second son.
It’s not a prediction or a warning. It’s Eurus’ observations regarding love—mine specifically. How I’ve kept my true love locked, how it will make me cry again. I understand what she saw. She only understood that I wanted John. She’d seen the lengths I went to save him. Suffer torture, take a shot through the heart. She’d tested the lengths when she put John in a well to drown him like Victor. Eurus didn’t understand love. She observed it in others. She only knew I desperately wanted it.
in this very class," the professor continued, "a late-arriving John Watson who seemingly feels free to interrupt my lecture."
John was away. John was...
"And tell him we're locked in a walk-in freezer? I think I'll wait for Miss Frankenstein, thank you very much." I still pulled out my mobile. No reception. It wasn't even an option. I huffed and puffed into my hands to warm them.
John retrieved some rope from the garage, then paper-bagged it along with the ammo, pistol, and knife, then rolled it all up in an old blanket along with his granddad’s Remington  and said a silent prayer that Sherlock knew how to shoot it.
“At this point, I think I need it.”
Something was not right. John was agitated, distracted. He wondered if it had to do with his fall. Something
John sighs and searches in his desk for another pen. "What's this, then? Something to do with those murders?"
After that, his dad only worked odd jobs, if at all. His mother didn't plant petunias or marigolds because she was too busy working as a cashier at the local Kroger store. Life became a series of mindless habits. The entire family became a mirror of his father's apathy. The house was not a home. It was listless kisses on the cheek, obligatory goodbyes, and aloof I-love-you's. Still, they remained a family and his parents remained married. John couldn't figure out why. They slept in separate rooms and rarely spoke. She served him dinner, when he was around, in his thread-bare lazy boy in front of the TV, where he'd complain that his mashed potatoes were cold and the gravy lumpy.
Dr. Watson doesn’t go home. He does go to pay his tab at the canteen, to find out that the man had robbed him again. It’s like a challenge. He reaches into the man’s coat pocket and finds his money along with a few other souvenirs from the locker room.
“Here’s my dorm. I’m good here.” She stopped and reached into her purse and pulled out a small note pad and pen. “Want some advice?” she asked. She tapped the pen on the pad.
"There's no trail of anything," Anderson said. "I looked."
“You let your brother live in an attic without a memory or medical attention so you could play puppet master?!” John shouts.
"Ellen, sing for us," his father'd say to her.
“Please. Don’t you bore me too! You want to make sure I don’t spoil your plot to gain control of Cardiff and other grander designs you have.”
The moment Sherlock sits on the couch next to him, he goes right into his mind palace to try to find answers, and stays inside its walls even after John calls him for dinner. It’s only beans and toast, but it’s food. After another few hours, John finally decides to get some sleep.
Sherlock gave John a leg up, which pushed the snow out and inside the door, making a way for Sherlock.
“One strategic thermonuclear weapon. It would have killed what eugenicists made in their labs, and what was destined to be shipped off in Cardiff’s port. It was the only way to neutralize Pandora. I did not pull the trigger...push the bottom...blow us to kingdom come. I chose Pandora. I thought...I didn’t realize. I couldn’t do it. All I had to do was text Mycroft the key, and Pandora never would have happened.”
John stepped to the other end and rested his ink-stained hand on the faucet. The sinks were clean, water hot, and soap just refilled. John let the water run, steam billowing up into his face. It was a humid July morning, but the heat didn't matter; he needed the steam to clear his head. He scrubbed the evidence from his hands as best he could with the scalding water, but his sin-stained hands were like the stall wall behind him—there for anyone to read.
A few minutes later, John pulls back. “When do you think she’ll make her move and try to abduct me?”
He needed time to get into his mind palace and go directly to the room where he'd stored that night at the rest area.
“So, you’ve heard nothing of Sophy’s whereabouts?” Sherlock asks.
“Hmm. Four hours left before low tide. Private, you say?”
He was playing "Blowin' in the Wind"
John read that it was up to those administering to follow the script given them on how the misleading information was to be presented. That meant John would be the one administering this along with the woman he’d just met, Mary.
Fever: 41.2 C. Pulse: 110 beats per minute, elevated.
John blinked and wondered if any morsel of this was true. How well did he really know Sherlock? He
prosthetic arm—" I say. "Not just
"That would hardly be sanitary."
“Mr. Holmes,” Thomas says, “I must insist! I’ll ask Lt. Lestrade to escort you away if you don’t stop aggravating my patient.”
And he does.
John laughs through all of it, then his eye catches a photo at the other end of the mantel. It’s of four youngsters brandishing toy swords on a beach in pirate hats and eye patches. John doesn’t remember that picture from the last time he was here. It must be one she’s brought out of safekeeping, one of the photos of Eurus that she’d told John she’d packed away.
He watched as Moriarty left. He tapped the pen against the desk as he took a few moments to collect himself. He decided he might as well get back, and he put the pen in his backpack. As he walked toward the dorms, he thought about what James had said, juxtaposed to what Sherlock revealed to him. Something about Moriarty didn't ring true. He hoped it wasn't because he wanted so badly to believe Sherlock.
When Sherlock wakes, he’s first up and able to admire John close with a level mind. He’s on his stomach, arm under his head, face turned toward Sherlock. His back dips into two nice-round arse cheeks with cute dimples. He chokes back a laugh. He never would have imagined two years ago that he would ever admire a man’s dimples on his arse. John’s eyes flutter open at his suppressed laughter.
Of course he's heard that stupid superstition before. He's never believed it. Still doesn't. And neither does Sherlock, who rolled his eyes at her words. Sherlock did agree, however, that John needs to "step back."
“I may just bite off his fingers if he doesn’t stop,” Sherlock said.
John flushes. William realizes his mistake, but John says nothing since he regrets bringing up something William has never played— or at least doesn’t remember. “The colored pieces?”
, John thought.
From his time spent with me, I deduce he sees very few patients. His morning office hours take little of his time, and he devotes long stretches of the afternoon to his family business.
One CCTV camera merges to another as he continues to walk. It seems Mycroft’s men have spliced together the footage which follows Sherlock to a business near the harbor. He hides behind discarded shipping crates as three men pass by.
For this story, I needed to dig into research on the subject done during the 1970s. I was surprised how much there was. I strive to keep this story as historically accurate as possible. The study that John is asked to conduct with Mary is based on a composit of studies and my own imagination. I do have some background in sociological theory (yeah, I hear that it’s not a “real” science all the time) and conducted a few studies in college, but that’s my extent of knowledge.
his drawings?” John asks.
I always feel a bit melancholy when I end a story. I know I have readers who feel the same. I know I feel that way when I come to the end of fanfic I’ve followed for weeks and months (and in some cases, years as with Bittergreens’ Over the Fathoms Deep. I think I shall cry a river when that ends). At least let us wipe those tears and take solace knowing that in this version, Sherlock and John get the happy ever after they so deserve.
“Pandora left the world in chaos with some ready to step into seats of power,” Mycroft says. “While we did not stop Pandora, we can stop those who created it and coveted that power. We can possibly find an antidote if they try such a thing again.”
A mass grave. The dead had to be buried somewhere. This was one of the somewheres.
They’re over halfway to the flat when Sherlock brings up last night’s dream.
“Sorry,” John says, and nearly sideswipes a man on a bike.
Eyebrows grumbles as he opens Anthea’s car door.
He’s not ready to let Helena know. Not until he can think this all through clearly. These two must be anxious to speak to him, or maybe they just planned on taking him away.
“But I’m already dead. You know how that is, don’t you, brother dear?”
"Give me the damnable envelope and let me open it," John says as he swipes it back from Sherlock. He unclasps it, turns it upside down. Two long, silky black cords fall out along with a note that simply reads: "Let's Pretend."
“It’s been fifteen minutes,” says Calhoun. “Can we throw him in and shut him up?”
“These men wanted in on your lucrative endeavor, or so they told you. However, it isn’t as simple as that.”
“All children suck the life out of you,” she says, unruffled. “Never had a cavity until I gave birth to my twins. A full set of dentures is what they left me, bless their souls.”
That sounded like a hint to John. Beds? He might sit there. Normally, John would want to take advantage, but not tonight. He plopped down into one of the bean-bag chairs. She handed him his coffee in an old chipped mug. John took a sip, then another. It was bitter, but at least it was hot.
He had a special place in his mind palace. Not a measure one should take if one wanted to remain detached.
John shakes his head. “After the Upheaval, there hasn’t been any ceremony, no romancing the family. I’ve seen it so often how omegas are just taken against their will.”
“The footage and other materials will be in your hands before the end of the day.” Mycroft stands. “I am also grateful to you, Dr. Watson, for helping my brother.” Mycroft reaches out to shake John’s hand. John does so, reluctantly. “I do not hold that punch you gave me against you.”
Sherlock hesitated, then lowered the gun.
Over and over I wake unsure how long or where I am. At times I wake myself screaming. It's raw torture. Even my arm is on fire, not the flesh and blood arm that is no longer but the metal substitute. Despite this, the pain is real, very real. I scream, “Cut it off, chop from my shoulder, now! I'd do it myself if you won’t!”
was your favorite.”
But why and how then? Fate was not even a remote possibility to Sherlock.
He's treading water thinking. Where is Sherlock? He said he'd be here. Of course the wanker isn't. He wonders what Mary is doing. What she did when he went missing. What Sherlock told her. Why all the mystery? What is Sherlock protecting him from?Everyone agreed that Moriarty was dead and gone, so it couldn't be anything to do with him. So many questions to mull over, yet he remains aware of what's around him. He really doesn't want to meet up with a shark.
“John, yes,” Sherlock answers and rocks into him.
“How do you even know this?” Markham whispers.
--------------------
“How is she?” Mycroft asks.
All the evidence before me (and behind) led me to believe that he was the one who was delirious. Mutual hand jobs inside a walk-in freezer for warmth? Yet he was clearly in full possession of his bizarre but clever brains. This was planned.
I sit in the cold, hard chair. My mobile vibrates in my Belstaff.
The next morning after a fitful night John comes out of his bedroom to find Will already up. He has completely made himself at home. He’s dressed and sipping on coffee at the table. He’s left a mess in the kitchen: coffee grounds, water splashed across the counter and floor.
Driving down the interstate, John thought. In the end, though, did it matter who? An anonymous first fuck? It was a creepy feeling. He supposed he could wait and watch from somewhere—see who came to answer his message. If that person looked as creepy as the man in the car, he'd pass on it.
“Yes, fitting don’t you think?!” William places his hand over his chest. It beats. It doesn’t feel like it’s ever been broken. It thrums harder looking at John Watson.
When they reach Cardiff Memorial, Sherlock thinks he’s well enough to stand and walk, but Art refuses to let him. John appreciates how Art is as stubborn as Sherlock.
“These came for you special delivery.” Mrs. Hudson hands Sherlock a plain manilla envelope like it’s something she gets in the post every day.
When an arm wraps around my chest and slips up under my arm, it’s like a piece of heaven.
"Yes!" I barely choked out.
“But it’s real.”
“You have a lot to answer for, young man.”
"I seen some of em waltzin' out behind the back. Heard em gruntin' and moanin' and fuckin' away. Mos' disgusting thing I ever heard," said the other.
Work study!? With Professor Doyle? He could hardly contain himself. This would be a huge help in making ends meet. Before John could do the math in his head, he bit his tongue. Not certain how he hadn't managed to blow it with his grand entrance, he gratefully took the note.
After Mycroft leaves with our guest, I go online and delve into Abraham Markham’s history, and I find where he is employed.
“Little brother, you know I cannot. I never really had it.”
I may have done the maddest, most insane thing of my life or the most brilliant. Either way, my life will have changed after this night. I snogged Sherlock bloody speechless, and that’s an accomplishment.
Lestrade begins laughing. “I love the description of his first meeting with you. Chasing you down...hanging by his fingertips. A sort of metaphor for your whole relationship, wouldn’t you say?”
"Oh, no, you're hurt," he gasped out dramatically. He reached out and grasped John's hand, inspecting his knuckles. "You should get this cleaned up."
“I thought you hated this,” John says, looking down at it.
Eventually, the father John had loved, the one who played with him, danced with him, tucked him in bed, was gone forever.
. Beca, conversely, has discovered that John was in the officer corps, and he suspects she exploits his tendency to jump in headfirst when he thinks he's spotted an enemy to defeat.
. You did it.”
“I don’t know what my habits are,” he snaps, and is immediately sorry. John’s face falls, then quickly adds, “but I’m sure they’re worse than yours.” He bites his own lip. Like saying that will help! But it does. Will watches the corner of John’s lips curl up.
Sherlock's eyelids didn't flutter. Perfectly still. Like a corpse.
"You need to get your hands warm. Here," Sherlock said. He removed his hands from my back and held my hands in his, warming them. He gently tugged them between us in an effort to keep them warm—or so I thought. But he pulled them lower and lower still, until they came to rest on Sherlock's...cock.
since the copyright on this has been abused over the years and I don’t want to violate it.
“No hospital,” I whisper.
“Not much. Just that he was a handful, and that they’d had a disagreement.”
He brushes his index finger along John’s length.“And what a delightful effect my playing has on you.” John bites his lip and moans. Sherlock slips up between John’s thighs and then up to John’s lips and bites them too. John pushes up against Sherlock’s hand, every muscle in his body screaming, “touch me.”
“This is beautiful spot for lunch,” John agrees. The wind whips John’s sandy hair, and Sherlock thinks the colors echo the cliffs beneath them.
Non-con warning for ending in this chapter. Moriarty is a bad boy.
He waited for John to leave before going through his dresser, but he couldn't determine his middle name from anything it contained. He thought of asking Mycroft. Most likely his brother already had a file on his roommate, but Sherlock didn't want to ask Mycroft for any favours. Favours always needed to be repaid.
“What’s not ordinary,” Sherlock says, “is that there is an intact glasshouse that’s in the center of the block, hidden away and protected. It holds all sorts of exotic flowers and attracts bees.”
He’s a lean, striking figure. He stands tall, back straight, arms moving with aristocratic elegance and head up, chin held proud. He’s wearing a long trench coat over blue scrubs. Molly’s still pointing at the man as he glances back their way. John can’t define the color. Light and dark.
John’s hands were shaking, but he did it.
kept it all inside, their family secret that everyone knew. John started getting headaches. His mom stopped singing and his sister started drinking. John didn't want to admit to himself he hated his own father, but he did.
Thanks so much to hotshoeagain for the thorough beta!
“I believe I said that.”
“Well, that is a bit off.” William’s eye twitches. It’s obvious that Will is distressed relating this to him, not excited or inspired.
Sherlock's heart pounded. Fear made him brittle and cold. While it could confuse the senses and cloud the mind, once mastered, fear became a useful tool. He would use it now, but John was distracting him from taming it completely. Instead, he'd have to retreat into his mind palace in order to determine Moriarty's next possible move and plan against it. What was James planning? He was so unpredictable. Sherlock liked unpredictable: that was what had drawn him to Moriarty in the beginning.
"Please. It will be a mercy killing. After John and I are married, he'll begin using again. Once an addict, always an addict."
“Morning, love.”
“And not something he keeps. I’m not his cat,” John adds.
“What I mean is, I think it’s Norbury behind this,” I blurt out. It’s only a part of it.
The way Sherlock’s hands feel on him, it’s like everything good that’s ever come his way is happening all at once: that cup of tea at the right temperature with extra buttery scones, that sublime back rub, that steaming hot morning shower. It’s that perfect. And his body aches for more. He doesn’t think it could ever feel better until Sherlock pulls down his zip. He’s hard, so hard. His heart beats faster than hummingbird wings.
"How long have I been unconscious?"
"Yes, a dog. A murdered dog. Robbed of the best years of his life. Really, John, you should be more empathetic. They've lost a close and cherished member of their family."
"Hello? Are you in there?" Marilyn's voice filled the cooler.
Sherlock sneers at him a bit, then presses his is finger to John’s mouth to silence him.
“Purple prose is not a compliment, Sherlock,” John says straight faced, which worries Sherlock. He’d expected John to trying to throttle him at this point. Instead, John is eating his toast and sipping his coffee between intermittent outbursts and sputters.
A few CT scans and Dr. Watson determines the most probable cause. Severe head trauma. One old trauma, one new. Skull fracture. Past hemorrhaging and cerebral edema remain.  He’s seen men with massive head injuries walking around, unphased. He’s seen men with a bump, die. It’s all a matter of where and how the pressure prevents blood from flowing to the brain and how deprived of the oxygen the brain is. Swelling also blocks other fluids from leaving the brain, making the swelling even worse. The clots are another issue, but at least they are small This seems to be the case here. John doesn’t know what permanent damage that’s been done, but fortunately they can now give him medication to treat the swelling and possible clotting. A second MRI reveals the medication is working and the edema has lessened.
“This reminds me of the first time we met. No hopping rooftops this time!” John says watching Sherlock's are from beneath as they climb.
“Why, because she smiled nicely and batted her eyes?” I said, which made John angry.
“What?” Sherlock demands, mocking John’s pleading voice. “
“Justice,” she'd said. “I know you care little about that, but you do care about a good puzzle. This is the biggest who-done-it in the history of man. Most of the human race, dead. What you need to find out is if you did it.”
John wondered how he'd make it without an extra income.
John clears his throat.
John nodded. He watched her hand as she swirled her coffee around in her cup. She drank hers with cream.
While Sherlock admits to himself that he was more than a bit anxious about their trip to
That’s why while rushing down a narrow alley, dodging rubbish bins and boxes, and slipping on the wet pavement, John begins to admire the wanker. The man runs like a fucking gazelle. Just as Molly described him, he’s an oddly handsome tosser: too sharp cheekbones, shiny curls all wild and wet with rain and completely unruly.
“He is a pompous bloody arse is what he is!” Lestrade huffs, striding towards the nurses' station. John laughs sympathetically.
"They never found the other body."
In the morning he's greeted by Sherlock holding a plate full of beans and canned pears. He's wearing a silly camo sunhat that flops over his face. John blinks up into the light as Sherlock grips him under his arms to help him sit, knocking the hat off his head. Birds roosting in the palm trees outside sing out. At least someone is happy.
“No one is allowed to live here. We always walked across from where we stayed in the village of Swanbridge. Not the same place we’re staying. The couple who rented the cottage to our family sold it and retired over ten years ago.”
“I think you always were. Right.”
“It’s a common space for those living in the adjoining buildings,” Sherlock explains. “But there are a few older gentlemen who tend it lovingly. There are bee hives in the north corner.”
"I can perform the seal,” I say. “I have before."
He hears a woman call from the doorway. She’s dressed in a tasteful blue floral print dress. “John Watson, is that you sneaking your new roommate up the stairs without so much as an introduction?”
From beneath the ice came a familiar voice: “I am sorry to interrupt your date.”
I roll my eyes and I squeeze Rosie’s hand when John begins yelling. It’s followed by a loud bang. A few moments pass before we hear his footsteps coming down the stairs.
There I find myself in the place where my nightmare always ends, walking the path alone. The rare elements required for transmutation line the road, but I don't pick them up. I never do. They are there to remind me of what my actions cost my family. I have lost the will to transmute. I won’t do it. Not to open an escape or to find the right road. And never to bring back the dead. Not again.
"You'll be my prisoner of love then?"
a chopsy one, aren’t
“Refreshing not having to sneak in the back,” Will smirks when they’re at front doors.
Of course the bloody genius can look at old socks, bits of thread, missing buttons and missing shoes, then deduce where someone’s been! He grabs John’s hand and the next thing John knows they’re racing down the streets of Cardiff. “To where the murder actually took place,” Sherlock rumbles.
It’s ordinary street in an ordinary neighborhood, Sherlock explains.
Through it all, Sherlock just grimaces and acts a bit uncomfortable. John feels it too— not from sillys stories, but from memories of the night before and wondering what happens next. He thinks of ways he’d like to kiss those lips again. When Greg mentions some cold case Sherlock cracked, John switches to more current topics of interest, which unfortunately returns Greg to Anthea and Sophy.
That’s why he escaped into his music, humming and strumming a few Neil Young songs on his six-string. Easy to sing and not think. At least until his roommate decided to come closer. Sherlock was even humming along next to him. In his underwear.
Eurus knew my heart was folded and taken from me.
“That it is!”
“You as well as anyone know that it’s never foolproof, never infallible,” I say.
"Come on. Give it a go, or I'll make you share that ice cream."
“No telling what that madman might do next,” John said.
“Vivian told her that it was a message. It was to let you know that you weren’t untouchable and that others will know what you are.” John takes a deep breath. “How did Carolyn Norbury get the note?” he asks me.
Sherlock hears Sophy’s voice echo from the living area. She’s talking on her cell. He listens for a moment. “We are agreed then,” she says. “Fine.” Then disconnects. “Ross?!” she calls. He spins too quickly into the shadows and feels the familiar heat from a torn ligament, the joint throbs angrily.
Sherlock almost thanks her, but checks himself. He doesn’t want to seem too easy to please.
Even now it’s easy to close my eyes and see how John did it. It’s easy to imagine him. I’ve seen John take control so many times. John stealthily moves from behind, and before the suspect knows what’s happening, John has the man’s arm wrenched behind his back, and the suspect is flat on the floor. Then he snaps on the handcuffs he’s not supposed to have. My heart races everytime he does it. I’m sorry I had missed it.
“John! The Freudian implications are enormous!”
“Associate professor Moriarty gave me these for us to review,” she pointed to the folders stacked on the desk in front of her. “I was just reading them. You know what? I have an idea … instead of that cramped office, you could camp out here, and we could go over them together? It gets boring at the desk. Not much for me to do except twiddle my thumbs.”
“My son, the dreamer. Or at least he was before university. Then he tried so hard to hide it. I know at first glance Sherlock doesn’t seem a romantic, he builds his ideas sailing the seas, solving crimes, saving the world.”
Later that morning, as they watch Palmyra grow smaller behind them, John and Sherlock throw the bottle out into the ocean.
“Let’s?” William spits out. “
Mouths open, tongues war, John’s weight comes to rest completely on top of Sherlock, and John begins to rock into him.
He's afraid because so much could go wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
Never call John Watson shorty. :(
Sherlock could deny it all he wanted, but John knew it was true.
"John, no. Only a little longer," he called from behind me as I crawled toward Marilyn. The cold of the freezer floor burned my hands through the cuffs of my jumper sleeves.
"Why yes, or, at least, your equivalent of grade school. I was about eleven at the time."
John's stomach rumbled. He snatched the bag off the desk and took out his sandwich and unwrapped it. He needed a distraction from watching Sherlock lick his fingers.
“They do in my world,” John smiles and nods to Rosie struggling in his arms. “And Rosie and I know you’re no sociopath.” As if she understands his words, she reaches out to me. “See? And look at how you care for her and protect her. She’s proof of how you care.”
"Watch," Sherlock says, as he taps play.
me,” Sherlock continues his rant. “I can’t DO IT ANYMORE! I can't pretend to look at him all moon-eyed.” Each word he underlines with loathing as he spreads his arms and twists his body in disgust. Sherlock stops and bends over at the waist then straightens.
Sherlock looks up. “Now.”
"Close to it," Sherlock answered.
Sherlock rushed John. All those hours of practicing card tricks kept his hands fast and nimble. He covertly reached into his Belstaff’s deep pocket and retrieved a penknife from its depths. He swept his arms around John, tightly hugging him. One hand stealthily slipped open the penknife, and he hooked it neatly under one strap. With a flick of his wrist, he cut it clean through. Sherlock worked his act. A bit of misdirection was needed. His other hand swung the remote around.
“Forever talking in circles and pretending to save the free world. The key is a metaphor. Or not?” Sherlock notices something peculiar, as Sophy turns from Mycroft, some of the red dots on Mycroft have disappeared then reappear. “What a bother. No key? I guess you’ll have to kill him then,” Sherlock says to Sophy and gives an exaggerated sigh.
“No?” she laughs, then bends down closely, her face inches from his. “The great Sherlock Holmes says no to death. I’m so sorry. There’s no refusing death. Listen closely, you can hear him calling.”
“What are you saying?”
"One point I don't get is that she said when we first got here that her father had contacted Mycroft."
The beep, beep of the monitor speeds up with my heart.
That said, please forgive the longer gaps between chapters, but have patience. I am looking for this to be about 10 to 12 chapters. Also know that I am on the same quest as you are as you read. The setting is familiar to me, so I don’t have to do much research at all, which speeds up the process.
John’s real kiss is insistent. His tongue sweeps against Sherlock’s and slowly traces the roof of Sherlock’s mouth. The kiss is long, lingering and when John releases Sherlock’s lips, they remain parted in a gasp. His eyelids flutter, his face hot. Somewhere along the way Sherlock’s hands have twisted themselves tighter into the front of John’s t-shirt.
“And that would last but for a few years, then he would have returned and taken up the chase, wouldn’t you, Sherlock? Not that I mind the chase, but you’re forever in my business.” James looked again at John. “He’s obsessed with me,” he said conspiratorially.
"I need to do
John has his sketch pad. It’s as if  John has read his mind. “Is this her?” John asks, flipping to a page and showing him.
“Really, which one? Wait, let me guess … the study on Alpha Inhibitors.”
“Ahhh, but she isn’t one charged to uphold it!”
He knows she’s saying this and withholding the file to pique his interest. It’s working. Too well. What bothers him more is that she’s asking a sociopath to keep an open mind. It’s laughable.
I yawn. “But you decided not to do it.”
John shakes his own. "So all he held over people was locked away inside his mind? In what, some sort of Mind Palace like you have? Hardly something a person can use as evidence."
“And she’d seemed so innocent,” John had said to me later.
Sherlock glances back up for permission, and John gasps approval.
sealed."
With trepidation, Sherlock stepped behind James inside and the lights flipped on overhead, one-by-one. James always had a flare for the dramatic. Relief filled him to see that John wasn’t floating in the water.
"Wait, how do you know he calls?"
“If he had done as you demanded, you and Sherlock would be dead and not my sister.”
"No, I stopped in front of you. I'm the one who should apologize. Are you okay?"
"As I said, he is clever! I'm certain he told you that along with other sordid stories. He applied here because he knew I was offered this position over two years ago, but I turned it down. When I told him I was leaving and putting distance between us and accepted the position, he applied here. It was my mistake. I never should have told him."
"Come in," she said and motioned us in as she swung the door wide.
I rub my hands up and down his thighs to calm him.
Will takes a second to answer. "I know it's fine." Will holds up his left hand. “No trace that I ever wore a ring. Doesn't prove anything. I feel as if I have not. Along with the scars I’ve garnered over the last two year, I have ample older ones. One from a gunshot that grazed me here,” he points to his left forearm. “A knife wounds here and here.” He points to his chest and other forearm. Will frowns. “I have thought about the circumstances in which I would acquire such wounds. Most scenarios are not...good ones."
John was not only a constant reminder of his encounter at the rest area, but also of one of the most perplexing mysteries he'd ever encountered.
He finished and had just slipped the slide in and adjusted the coarse focus when the door hinges groaned. Sherlock didn’t even have to look up from the microscope to know who entered.
“What are you implying?”
“I should think that is obvious, but it doesn’t preclude the fact that they may be waiting for us.”
Sherlock takes it from him, unscrews it, and and thrusts it back. "Drink," he orders.
“Please. I was never humane! Ask my brother.”
“This keeps getting worse and worse.” John rubs his face with his hands. The last thing he ever wanted to do is to get Greg caught up in all this. Greg is a detective, but involve him in this craziness?
“Sherlock? What the …?”
He turns off the telly, then goes to bed. Blackbeard follows. He pulls off his jeans and jumper puts on his well-worn sweats and t-shirt. He lies awake staring at the ceiling, thinking how empty it feels without Sherlock. Blackbeard seems to think so too and cuddles up next to his side. He finally falls off, but his mind is waiting, waiting for the door to open. A door that may never open again.
John is gone. He kisses Sherlock, all inhibitions down, want open and acknowledged. His tongue flicks around the corner of his mouth until it opens in welcome, then he pummels the inside and flicks its tip against the roof of Sherlock’s mouth, sending a shiver through the man. He pulls his mouth away and nibbles his chin, his neck, then takes his mouth again.
“You’re thinking so loud, I can practically hear you. Worried about your roommate, Sherlock?”
"He was most attentive, and I was very flattered," James said. "But as time passed, his attentions became … suffocating. I broke it off, but he refused to accept it was over."
“Mary needs to stop improvising.”
Back then, every weekday evening seemed a celebration and every weekend a vacation.
Robert Crumb’s poster 1968 single Zap comic sparked many reprints and new creations on his part, including the font.
But that was not what was happening. Sherlock removed the warmth of his arms and coat from around me. Instead, he got on his hands and knees and shimmied inside the box. That was the second time today I'd seen his arse in the air.
Sophy is beside herself with glee and motions to her men, but some of them have already scrambled for the doors.
And the Winner is: Chriscalledmesweetie's Blackbeard (we included what you said about the name in the story).
“Oh,” John said. He felt his face get hot. That was why everyone was laughing. Well, that was a relief. “Thanks.”
It was not knowing a soul that bugged him most. John always had had a lot of friends. Here, he'd had to start over. Sherlock didn't seem like someone who had many. As John had wandered the university yesterday, he’d observed the self-assured way upperclassman moved about. John watched as groups met for the first time after the long summer break—guys back-slapping, girls jumping into waiting arms. He wondered if next year that’s what his life would be like.
He’s had a hard time with this idea of spying on Sherlock. He’d turned his mobile off after Lincoln returned it to him, feeling like he was betraying Sherlock on some level. Still, as he said to Anthea, he’d rather it was him, but it seems that’s not the case. Everyone has the app!
“So right, Dr. Watson! Maybe he is good for something besides being a crack shot and personal physician. You may keep him little brother.” He raises his eyebrows suggestively.
“True,” Mycroft says.
The stairs groan, a signal that John is home. He comes in through the kitchen carrying two bags. He sets them on the counter, and a quick look inside each tells me he has forgotten the milk and eggs. I immediately see dirt on his shoes.
“You said it was popular,” John says.
"James Moriarty, Consulting Forensic Psychologist, at your service, Mr. Holmes."
John laughed. “So you realized you were committing fashion crime wearing last year’s suit?”
“Vivian said she switched them, but it is also possible that Mary only saw what Eurus wanted her to see. Eurus got to us. She got to you, and she got to Mary. She probably believed they were blanks. It may well be that she tricked Mary into loading the gun with the live rounds herself. Think, John! We can’t believe what we think we saw, not when my sister is involved. Use logic. We ignored so much, and the plan worked until now. Eurus suggested it to you and to me. She had us only believe what she wanted us to see or not see. She made me believe. There was no glass barrier between us. Eurus made me overlook the obvious. We were to believe their plan, her hoax. The irony is that the gun was loaded. What I am uncertain about is if that was Eurus’ plan all along.”
"What about one hundred and one creative uses for ice cream..." Sherlock hums.
“When we’re at the morgue…”
"We're doing an experiment in biology and comparing the decomposition of five different types of organic matter," John blurted out.
“The letter,” I demand.
Much of what I’ve read about in the research our own labs have duplicated. To think of the time we could have saved and the progress made if we’d worked together. I recall suggesting this myself to Mycroft, but he said it was a poor business practice to do so.
Sherlock thought.
.” Moriarty spoke as if he were addressing a room filled with people. “You want
John laughs. “Is that the pain meds or you speaking?”
“I’d like that,” Sherlock says, and winks.
"Follow me, please. I'll take you to where it happened," she said.
“Not well enough to call him James!” And another bubbling burst of laughter erupted from her. John thought it was sort of cute.
His roommate had come to college prepared. Sherlock slipped the capo and pick inside the compartment, replaced the guitar, and shut the case. He carefully returned it alongside the dresser. Not exactly in the same spot.
(See the end of the chapter for
She slid her chair closer to John and sat down.
He likes him, and that’s more than he can say about most people he’s met thus far. John is intelligent and compassionate. He’s rather ordinary looking in extraordinary ways. It's possible, though, that his attraction to John is in fact Will's strong preference for living in a perfect flat with an interesting person rather than an attic by himself.  He decides he needs more data: more observations of John, and of his reactions to John.
I learned months ago that I will never get answers from Eurus directly and no one ever will.
He wished he would have tasted that mouth last night even if it meant becoming more intimate.
“We have Sherlock’s mobile located and can now listen,” she says. “Please use the app that Lincoln took the time to install. You will be able to hear and evaluate his progress. We’re been following his movements for over the last hour.”
. I packed the book for you along with those on flora and fauna. I'm surprised you found time to read it with all of the distractions."
If one could suppress the base desires driven by the hindbrain, there would be no need to suppress heats. While electro stimulus is akin to the old electro shock methods, when targeting specific receptors, the study shows a dramatic diminished primal urge in every one of omegas and alphas. What if one could use alchemy to achieve this?
Anthea gives them time alone together. This woman, who calls herself Sherlock’s mum, looks like him. She’s a mathematician. Retired professor. His father, also a professor, but of literature. She tells John, he passed away during the epidemic. Her simple yet elegant dress expresses her childlike love of colour. She wears no jewelry. Her white hair is cut short and curls the same haphazard way as Sherlock’s. The home is what he thought it’d be, aristocratic, but not overstated but with splashes of colour like her dress. Antiques mixed with modern done tastefully with more of an eye for comfort than show. What does surprise John is how warm and homey it feels. A colorful Durham quilt is balled up in a wingback chair near the fireplace, which tells John it’s her favored spot. Although Mrs. Holmes has that same aloof manner, beneath there is the same heart. Hers is of a caring mum. When she speaks of her sons, her eyes water a bit, and love aches behind every word.
“Drop it,” John barks out.
I remember who the man is, and I'll be damned if I'm going to give this man what he wants.
“Drinky!”
“Or Eurus’ impression of us,” I correct.
"I noticed Sherlock wasn't in Chem lectures at all last week."
He decides either way— with these two or with Helena— he’ll be far from John, and John and everyone else will be safe from him and these people who are after him.
"Look, John," Sherlock points out at the ocean. "There it is again! Do you think it's swimming off to its mate?"
“An eight,” he answers.
Sherlock had spent the first few days cleaning the cabin. It wasn’t because he hated disorder. He could live with disorder, and dirt. It was a fact that he rarely worried about germs. After all, he had spent many-a-night with the homeless on the streets of London. This, however, was different. One expected unsanitary conditions in a flophouse but not in a rental log cabin overlooking a lake.
It was possible. Sherlock could break into any place on campus. He told John it was easy. All Sherlock had to do was break into the residence hall, pull the files, and change the assignment.
“Do you think Mike bought the excuse?” John asks.
As I go under, I hold my breath, but the water still burns my sinuses. I decide that now is  the time to kick. I use all my strength and what I know about force and motion to free them from the cement anchor. Time slows. It’s yellow. All yellow. I kick and kick. My socks and shoes slip but my ankles hold. My plans to strip off my trousers goes immediately awry as my Belstaff gets in the way as my hands grapple in the yellow of the water. I keep myself from panicking. My coat is half off and wrapping around me in my struggles when the world turns amber. My lungs burn and ache for air. breath, but the urge to breathe increases exponentially. I kick with all my strength. I feel the snap and grind as my ankle breaks. I take in a lungful of the Thames, but I don’t give in. My legs are free!
“Thank you, Sherlock.” She picks up her purse to leave.
Sherlock’s eyes travel to the man they’ve dropped to the floor between them. He’s face up, blood beginning to clot on his scalp.
"No, I'm not familiar with that game."
He's browsing the books when the title of one jumps out at him:
Misjudging emotion was what had brought him together with James in the first place. James had said he understood emotions and could help Sherlock bridge that gap. Later Sherlock realized that while James understood them, he also didn't care about them. At least, not about anyone's except his own.
He waded through the students all pouring out the other direction, while he headed toward inevitable disaster at the hands of...Professor Arthur Conan Doyle.
When Sherlock is done speaking, Beca steps over to reads Molly’s report.
“That’s not usually what the Caped Crusader says,” John laughs.
I've been through this before countless times with this imbecile.
“John, I need to tell you what I remember,” Sherlock insists.
They are the beginning a ceremony. Merlin steps next to Magnus, who raises his hands above his head. I hide behind an enormous stalagmite.
John thought. That did not bode well. Despite the haze in his head, John knew he was in deep trouble. He didn’t believe it, would never believe Sherlock would harness a live bomb to him.
Sherlock felt a bit of pride that he was able to procure eight traps.
Sherlock looked directly in John's eyes. His forehead no longer creased in curiosity. No, it was scrunched in anger.
In that moment John realizes that it’s possible that Anthea may have been in love with Mycroft. It’s the first time he’s seen this intensity, this powerful concern from her. She bites her lip before she continues. “With both of her sons missing, and all this horrible gossip, I thought it would kill Mrs. Holmes, but when we found out Sherlock was alive, she had hope again. I know you are not one-hundred percent convinced, but I assure you, after meeting Mrs. Holmes, you will be.”
“What?” he chokes out.
“Are you going to just stand there looking like a fish or come inside?”
My body is a traitor. First it reverts back to omega, now it's rejecting my prosthetic arm.
He tries to sleep. He goes to his mansion instead. He forgets locked doors and spends the evening rereading a pharmaceutical microbiology manual his mind instead.
“I’ll talk to Director Bellin, but you’re right. She already knows he’s here. Even though she does have a shrewd business mind, she has a soft heart for outcasts, and I think this guy might be one.”
"We're a long way from his jurisdiction," Sherlock said.
“I had to. I needed my meds.” He doesn’t say a word about Anthea. He knows she realizes he’s keeping something from her, but she probably thinks it has to do with John. He holds his head and hopes she thinks it’s just his headache that’s making him off.
He should know better than to care. People are fickle. In a few days, John Watson will forget Sherlock even lived upstairs.
John laughs. “Well, you won’t have to do it much longer.”
I drink a cup of coffee, then take a shower, shave, get ready for the day. It’s a routine I’ve grown to love. I never thought this kind of domesticity would suit me. I never thought I would embrace such a thing. Now it’s a part of me, and I don’t want to lose it.
One day she’d asked me to bring in something simple, with pictures. I went to the corner bookstore. “Here. I bought two comic books and a mango,” I had said, and she’d laughed and told me it’s Manga.
John can’t help himself. He feels a pang of jealousy.
Sherlock stepped up to the desk, removing his leather jacket. "I would have split it with you. We could use some extra cash—especially if it's coming from my brother."
But as he speaks to John, her hand is inside her coat. Lestrade is behind her, weapon pointed and ready. Then he hears it, the click of a safety being turned off. It seems she’d kept her Glock, and it’s trained on Sherlock’s forehead. As he looks up at Sophy, his head screams so much from the pain, that Sherlock thinks it might be a relief for her to pull the trigger.
