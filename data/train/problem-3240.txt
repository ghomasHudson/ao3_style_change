Cas carefully put the different spices in his coffee, eyeing the mug warily. His light brown coffee now had specs of...stuff in it.
Dean looked at him guiltily. “No.” He opened the bunker’s door and started walking down the metal stairs.
Cas set down the bag of sugar and picked up the pot, the glass making a small clink as it hit the top of the coffee maker. “Goodmorning Dean. Would you like any coffee?” He greeted cheerfully, turning around like he hadn't just put enough sugar to make a pound cake in his coffee.
When he broke away from the kiss, Dean found himself face to face with the most beautiful smile he had ever laid eyes on, one born from adoration and love. Cas’s eyebrows were slightly scrunched up, but for once it wasn’t a sign of confusion when met with some obscure eighties rock reference. It was a tiny expression of care, and it was one that was truly Cas. Not Jimmy’s, not even one Cas had picked up from him or Sam. It was completely and wholly Cas, and a completely and wholly human thing to do.
The normally black screen lit up, white letters reading “Cas.” His phone buzzed, and the noise vibrated through his skull.
Experience had given him the ability to walk down them without falling face first on the concrete floor.
“Hot chocolate with espresso shots please. This place doesn't sell liquor.” She shook her head sadly and Sam laughed. “Good thing I brought my own.” She winked at them, opening her jacket just enough so they could see the inside pocket and showing off her flask.
A knock on the bunker’s door was the first thing to pull him from it, and he hazily made his way up the stairs to the source of the noise.
“I went to the library to see if they had any books on-” He looked up from the book he was holding and stopped in his place.
Dean couldn’t believe those words were coming from the same man who drinks exactly a hundred and one ounces of water a day. (Which, according to Sam, is the recommended amount for males, as stated by the Institute of Medicine.)
Cas stepped forward, and the bunker’s golden light washed over him. He reached his hand out, and Dean saw that it was shaking.
“Mmm very close, but unfortunately you forgot the word ‘best’ in front of ‘rock band.’” Dean smirked before leaning in for a chaste kiss.
man. Not because of your wings, or your mojo, and I was so damn lucky to have you ‘round, and I know I didn't tell you enough. There's this hole inside me without you, Cas. I miss you so damn much, and I just want you to come home."
“I gotta go now, but hey, if I die… I’ll see you down in the Empty. Let’s hope a reaper makes good on Billie’s promise.”
He snapped his fingers, trying to recall the name. “Lee. That's it.” Dean looked up from the coffee right as Sam said it. “Do you remember him?”
“Hey, Jack. Now, now that you’re God, do you think you could… Can you save him?” The desperation in his words was palpable.
The monster’s words felt like poison in his bloodstream as it made its way to his already broken heart.
He didn't panic, knowing full well that Cas probably ran to the bathroom, or was pouring another mountain of sugar in his coffee.
Dean’s breath hitched at the familiar voice, and he felt the mountain of words he had to say get caught in his throat.
About how somewhere, somehow, he had decided Cas was different. That he somehow didn’t count, and that losing him hurt so much, was such an egregious pain, he wanted as much of Cas as he was allowed to have. And how that was something insurmountable stronger than the twisted, sick feeling John had placed in his gut.
“Please.” Dean whispered, voice hoarse. It hurt too much, to have the ghost-like figure of Cas so close. To have
“Dean where are you-” He walked out of the library before Sam could finish, desperate and filled with an unreasonable amount of hope.
“Hey-a Cas. I… I know I keep calling you and leaving you voicemails, and I know it's stupid because you'll never get to listen to them again, and I'm sorry. I'm real sorry for everything. When you… when you told me all those things… I didn't know what to say.”
Dean rolled over to give Cas a playful glare, but was met with the saddest puppy dog eyes he had ever seen, completely throwing him off his guard.
“Sam.” He sounded like he was trying to whisper, but his volume raised far higher than that. The patron closest to Dean gave him a look before turning back to their work.
Cas took his mug back. “Fine. More for me.” He said with a smirk, mimicking the look Dean gives him every time Cas says he doesn't want anymore bacon, before taking another sip of the makeshift pumpkin spice coffee.
An inability to speak formed from fear and cowardice. Like a lion in his stomach scratching at the words until they fell back down his throat.
The four of them went over to their thankfully-still-available booth and sat down. Dean and Cas sat on one side, both instinctively choosing the side that faced the door, with Sam and Eileen sliding into the seats directly across from them. They sat there, talking about nothing in particular, and certainly nothing of importance, before falling into the natural art of storytelling.
“I know.” The words barely came out as a whisper, hot tears betraying Dean’s eyes as they silently leaked out and ran down his cheeks.
They were sitting in adjacent chairs, with Eileen laying her head on Sam’s shoulder and reaching for her water bottle on the table. They were reading a book together, but Eileen shook Sam indicating she had seen them walk in.
Full on coffee, cookies Dean bought for them at Starbucks, and brimming with contentment, (as well as the fact that they spent half the day in the car), Cas suggested to Dean that they “hit the hay” as they stepped back into the bunker.
Born a warrior of Heaven, trained to fight from the day his celestial wavelength was given intention, chosen to push through hoards of black-eyed and broken souls, pulling Dean Winchester from the depths of fiery Hell, and whose name translates to “shield”, as if defending others from the horrors of the universe was his only excuse for existing.
Behind their backs Sam and Eileen were fake-gagging at their sickly sweet interaction, but secretly just glad the two of them had finally gotten over their stubborn (and oblivious) selves.
The words Michael had said to him just weeks before rang loudly in his head, and the thought made his lungs ache.
Cas’s face broke, and the lines on his face grew as they flashed in pain. It was a raw display of anguish he wasn’t used to seeing.
As soon as their lips met, Dean pulled away instinctively, realization hitting him like a hunter with a bat as his eyes widened in terror. “I-I'm sorry, I didn’t...” His words faltered as he looked around at the people sitting in the coffee shop, all of which were paying no mind to them.
He remembered something Cas had told him once: “Hatred isn’t a natural trait, Dean, it’s a learned one. A baby isn’t born with the ability to hate, it’s passed on from one broken soul to another. Love, love however. That’s something different altogether.”
Cas turned back around and rolled his eyes. “Yes, I’m sure their entire demographic is fourteen year old girls, staff included.”
He heard Cas’s voice in his head. Telling him what kind of bee it was. “Megalopta. Their eyes are twenty-seven times more sensitive to light, so they’re nocturnal.” He desperately grasped at the memory of Cas’s voice, eyes beginning to sting as he failed to keep hold of the clarity.
Sam rolled his eyes, knowing full well Dean would never let him organise the kitchen. Eileen looked through them, carefully turning the bottles around until the labels faced her. She pulled out the cinnamon and clove while she was looking for the nutmeg.
“I might have thought about buying you two drinks, but there was no way I was ordering yours with a straight face.” He looked at Sam. “And it's an hour away, they wouldn't have been hot or cold or whatever they're supposed to be by the time we got here.”
“I think that's the point.” Eileen said, laughing. She looked at Cas. “Is Dean gatekeeping your coffee aspirations again?”
Cas handed them each their drinks, before excitedly trying his own. He put the plastic cup up to his mouth, almost missing the straw. When he swallowed the cranberry-colored liquid, his face relaxed in pleasure.
His already flickering smile faded as he realized that Jody and Donna had turned to dust like every other person in their god-forsaken universe.
Not that he was going to enjoy this trip. In fact, he was currently doing the opposite of enjoying, and they hadn’t even gotten into the car yet. Starbucks.
Cas was telling him some random fact about a bird he saw, but Dean could only think about his reputation that was about to shatter like a vase dropping on tile floor.
Sam gave him a look, but continued speaking. “So, I found a book in the library that I think might help, and Dean, are you listening?”
He nodded, before turning the page of the book in front of him. Sam walked out of the room, and Dean listened to his footsteps until he couldn't hear them anymore.
“You're real?” Dean asked quickly, breathless. It should be something so obvious, but he had to make sure.
While he was standing in line with Cas, Dean looked over at his brother, and found him and Eileen sitting at a small table in the corner.
Sam and Eileen went to look for a place where they could all sit again, playfully bickering the entire way.
“We didn't die.” Dean said as soon as it beeped. “Jack’s God now, and Sam just ran out to reunite with Eileen. Knowing him, his hair’s probably going to flow in the wind dramatically as he rushes into her arms.”
“Ah. There's the scent of overpriced coffee I missed.” Eileen joked as she took her first breath inside the building, using her hand to waft the smell towards her.
“Dean, if you say ‘manly,’ I will sit you down and make you eat only spinach and kale for a week.” Sam said, walking into the kitchen, hair still spiked up from sleep. He used one hand to sign the words, his other one occupied by Eileen, who was sleepily shuffling closely behind.
“Hm?” Dean turned his head to look at him, eyes not failing to glow with their unusually bright, green pigment. He took a deep breath, the lids of his eyes already started to slowly fall back down again.
Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew he should have been wary, but that concern was pushed away quickly.
“I thought… I was afraid you were just another one of the Empty's tricks. I was afraid you would turn into it and...”
The tail end of what looked to be a trenchcoat disappeared into the hallway, and Dean followed it, moving through the bunker soundlessly.
“Oh god, Dean let it go. He's not going to only ever drink black coffee. Contrary to popular belief, former angels do actually have souls.”
Cas clenched both of his hands into fists, putting the right one on top of the other. He made small, circular, stirring motions with his right hand. “Coffee.” He signed swiftly, movements fluid.
Dean stood there silently, contemplating. He internally weighed his pros and cons, mind leaving the menu entirely. While there was still a lot of shit he had to work through, (shit he had been actively not working out his entire life), there wasn’t much of a decision to be made.
“Uh.” He thought about it for a moment, almost considering branching out into the unexplored terrain that was the dark green menu with small, white text, before shuddering at the thought.
“Ooh. The peppermint mocha looks good.” Cas was reading the limited edition drinks on the drive-thru menu as they traveled across the parking lot.
“Yeah, go. You kids have fun.” Dean tried to shoot a grin at Eileen, but it rested on his face like a puzzle piece facing the wrong direction.
“So what I'm getting here is that not only have you two been to Starbucks often enough to have a regular order, but Sam gets something called a ‘Pink Drink’?”
Dean couldn't help but think of himself as a small, living-room window, from an old, dilapidated house. Stained yellow with age. Cracking from wear.
Cas held him back, and they stood there, holding each other like if they let go, they would lose everything.
He hit the red button quickly, heart suddenly racing. He wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his dirty flannel and stood up.
“Yes?” Dean called, standing up from his spot on the floor. Jack peeked his head in, unsure if he was intruding.
Dean held the glass door open for the other three, and they all walked out onto the asphalt, laughing, and making their way towards Baby.
“I would like that.” Cas answered. “All four of us could make pie. According to the “mom blogs,” as you call them, it would be a good family bonding exercise.”
While the thoughts in his head were screaming mercilessly, the drive home was in a simple silence. The only noise being Cas’s occasional sip, and the sound of soft fabric rubbing against skin as Cas moved his hand in small, comforting motions against Dean's back.
About the time John had caught him and Lee, ignoring the weak excuses Dean was stuttering out. Skipping town faster than they had done in years.
“Right, yeah. Basically, I think I found a spell that might help us kill Chuck. It's from an old book that somehow wound up in the religious section of the library. I think it was an actual witch's spellbook.”
Dean sat in the library, pouring over stacks of lore books and journals. Searching for anything that could help him break open and kick the Empty’s angel-stealing ass.
Dean pictured Cas’s hurt face when he had told him he couldn’t stay, smile broken as Dean’s own heart shattered from the look the newly-human angel was giving him.
“I'm going to have a real pumpkin spice latte this time.” Cas seemed very pleased with the aspect of buying something they could make it home, but Dean wasn't going to fault him for it.
“Hey, Cas. Just calling you again… for some reason. I just, I want you to know we’re missin’ you here. We need you to come back and help us fight Chuck, you know?”
Cas sighed, but the corner of his mouth upturned in a grin. “John Henry Bohnham, affectionately referred to as ‘Bonzo’, born in 1948 and was most well known for being the drummer of the rock band ‘Led Zeppelin’.”
“Yes, we came here yesterday.” Cas helped. “Well, we actually visited twice, but you weren't working the second time.”
Slowly, the sun would come out and shine through the stained-glass window, shadow portraying the picture of an angel.
Dean cleared his throat, swallowing the lump just beginning to form. “S-sorry little guy. I've got…” He sucked in a shaky breath, looking up towards the sky. “I’ve got someone, right here, who would like to rest with you.”
“Go get her, tiger.” He smiled, watching as his brother moved with the same desperation Dean’s voice reserved for Cas.
He took a deep breath, before glancing over at his phone screen again, Lucifer’s call still fresh on his mind.
He wanted to tell him it was going to be okay, that Cas himself wasn’t the reason, but the lion in his stomach clawed the words down faster than even the thought of ruining Sam’s chances at survival could.
The voicemail ended abruptly, and Dean felt tears well in his eyes. He laughed out, choking down a sob. It was just so
The sound of clashing angel blades, silver metal on silver metal, a weapon designed with its only intention to hurt.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, letting the weight of their many losses wash over them like a tidal wave.
He was finally starting to understand why life seemed to lose all meaning when Cas was gone, and from there he could slowly start to rebuild both of them.
His exhale of laughter from talking to a bee slowly turned into quiet sobs, racking his entire body.
He shot up, not used to hearing that voice anywhere other than the same few words on the phone. If he could
And it was that inability to speak that led Cas to think he was nothing more than a tool for the Winchester’s to use.
The hum of katydids in the background was a steady cadence reminding him to breathe, and the moon’s glow above him reflected off the quiet brook, who’s water washed over small, slick stones.
They parked the Impala, and Dean looked at the modern building. The green lettering contrasted with the tan plaster walls, spelling “Starbucks.”
They walked out of their room together, heading towards the bunker’s library. Dean slid in one of the chairs, turning Sam’s still-open laptop around and waking it up.
When they got to the bunker, Cas, who was genuinely impressed that Dean managed to drive them home without crashing into a tree, pulled Dean out of the car and gently shook him out of his self-imposed stupor.
“Wait, wait. Shut up. Quiet.” He hit Sam on the shoulder in a childish attempt at getting him to stop talking so he could listen.
Cas walked in, wielding two mugs of coffee and a proud look shining in his eyes. “I made us coffee.” He said triumphantly, handing one of the mugs to Dean.
“Where's the closest one?” Cas asked, his blinding, blue eyes glaring at the back of Sam’s computer like he was trying to will the coffee shop to be near.
Dean stepped out and closed Baby’s door in the parking lot of Starbucks an hour later, kicking the loose pieces of gravel on the asphalt for the third time in two days.
They laid there in silence, breathing in scents of comfort, coffee, and each other, until Cas eventually drifted off to sleep.
Dean drew his attention away from the ghost-like figure of Cas, and turned back to Sam. “You said something about a book you found in the library.”
Cas took a sip from his pumpkin spice latte, gleefully smiling. “As much as I like trying different drinks, I think I might start just getting this one. It's my favourite.”
Beyond the gate was a garden. One clearly left to care for itself, as the blooming flowers were crossed with rose bushes which wrapped around anything it could hold on to.
Cas walked out from behind one of the bookshelves, and Dean inhaled quickly, immediately forgetting his helpless state.
Eileen shared of her time in Ireland. “Foreign country, foreign monsters.” She said with a wink, telling of creatures neither Sam nor Dean had even read about.
Losing Cas again to the Empty had ripped him apart, but months of spending every night with his partner left him with less nightmares and waking in cold sweats then he had since before Hell.
The shadows of grief danced across his face, but when he turned, the source of light was gone. It left him to be swallowed by a darkness more suffocating than before.
Cas raised an eyebrow at him, before setting his mug on the bedside table and sitting down behind Dean. The bed creaked underneath him as he leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist. “Is this why you and Sam never use umbrellas?” He joked.
“I… I know you'll never get to listen to this, and…” His eyes stung again. “I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for…”
Dean ignored the implications that he didn't have a soul, too distracted by Cas. “But look.” He motioned his head towards where Cas was standing, next in line to order. “He’s eyeing the weird fruity drinks.”
“Yes, we did!” Cas sounded way too excited to be referring to coffee. “I got a peppermint mocha, and Dean tried some and liked it.”
The patron in front of them finished ordering, clearing the way for Cas and Dean. The barista from the first time they went caught sight of them and made a face. “Wait a minute. I think I know you two.”
Something flashed out of the corner of his eye. He jerked his head to the right, and watched as a piece of tan fabric disappeared around the corner.
The sound of Dean typing filled the air. “So, I just looked it up, and do we have to go to Starbucks?”
They hadn't even finished parking before Sam had jumped out of the Impala and ran towards the bunker’s garage to get his own car.
“I remember once, Dean went on a hunt with Dad.” Sam started. “Nasty vampire, it got a hit or two on Dean. I think you guys went with another hunter. Young. About your age, actually. Uh…”
“Hey, it's okay Dean. You know I'm perfectly fine with public displays of affection, and no one else even saw us. There's no need to apologize.”
“Yeah, for all of the stuff they have here, it's surprisingly empty.” Sam continued flipping through some of the pages, most of which were blank.
He crouched beside the small body of running water, watching the tiny fish dance among the rocks. He felt the damp and brilliantly green moss below his fingers, thinking of nothing and everything all at once.
Dean watched the fire lick at the tarp covering Cas, sitting atop a pyre made from wood. Face expressionless yet reeking of loss. Reflection of embers the only light in his glossed over eyes. He moved almost robotically, gathering the ashes after the fire burnt out, heading for the only place he knew he could turn to.
“Dean. Dean wake up.” Cas was excitedly whisper-shouting in his ear like a kid on Christmas morning. It was exactly thirty minutes later, (he had counted), and Cas was ready to get moving.
“I think we have most of it, actually. The main stuff, at least. Let me check and see if there’s any graveyard dirt in the storage room.”
“What do you mean, of course he is, Sam. Come on.” Dean spoke with more force than necessary, but he couldn't lose any more of his family.
(a title used by Dean and Dean only), it was his duty to protect him from the disgustingly liquified rabbit food.
About how he had told Sam he just fell on a hunt. “Don't worry kid, you should have seen the vamp when I was done with him.” He swung his fist around in slow motion, pretending to punch an invisible enemy as his little brother giggled in childish bliss.
Or offhandedly toss like they didn't bear enough weight to shatter the window of a person's self-image.
Dean also learned that his own presence was enough to fight off the demons of solid, black goo that plagued Cas’s head at night.
Dean heard soft padding noises as socked feet walked down the hall, and there was a knock on the bedroom door. "S'your room too, Cas. You don't have to knock." He laughed, words slightly slurred from just waking up
The flames licked ineffaciously at the glass walls of its prison, but the light was there, and it would continue to burn for as long as it had oxygen to breathe.
“It takes an hour to get there, our coffee’s going to be cold by the time we get home, and it's freezing outside.” Dean muttered under his breath, but he grabbed his keys off the table and stood up, willing to follow Cas to the ends of the earth if it meant he would stay with him.
After a beat he went on. “Fine, you have a deal.” Before Dean could celebrate by tugging the covers over their bodies, Cas added another clause to their agreement. “But... in true Crowley fashion, you have to seal the deal with a kiss.”
Dean groaned, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. “Can I ask why, or is this one of those, 'I'll tell you later’ disasters like with the slime ingredients?”
Cas let out a laugh. “Right. Because I’m a good example of an angel.” The sarcasm was masking something else in his voice.
“Yeah.” Sam said solemnly, suddenly lost in his own thoughts, most of which were riddled with grief.
Aside from killing monsters, that’s what hunters did best. Sitting around and sharing stories. As tiring and dangerous as their lives were, some hunts were worth sharing exaggerated and hyperbolic versions of, especially over drinks.
“Fine.” Dean relented, sitting up with a yawn and thinking about how he will now never be able to win another argument.
Dean sat up suddenly, startled, and the edge of the table dug into his chest as he reached across for it. His desperation didn't leave time for doubt to creep in.
“I did not.” He said, discontentedly crossing his arms. “I only drink coffee that's as black as my soul. Darker than the night sky. Hotter than the bunker’s computer when it overheats. As manly as-”
“I did.” He muttered sleepily, a loose smile forming on his lips as he drifted off to sleep. Cas laid there, running his fingers through the other man’s hair, contentment and admiration showing itself in every feature on his face.
Cas pushed Dean’s protesting body into the line, looking pleased with the many different options written on the menu overhead.
“Yeah it's been a while, but I remember him.” Dean was blatantly ignoring Cas’s burning stare from beside him, and the fact that he had stabbed Lee through the chest just last year.
When he finished reading one of the Men of Letters’ “field researcher” journal entries, he almost burst out laughing.
“Yeah... that's not where I was going with that, but I like where your head’s at, Cas. We should definitely go back.”
He smiled sadly. The memory of giving the book to Cas was overshadowed by the hindsight that he would never get to finish it.
They paid for their coffee and picked it up, taking the travel cups across the room and towards Sam and Eileen.
“Awesome. I've officially lost my mind.” He laughed hollowly to himself, before taking another swig of his drink.
A loose smile crept onto his face at the thought, the corners of his mouth upturning for the first time in days.
The smell of rotting flesh, corpses of ghosts which in turn made more corpses. The numbers climb until he can't count anymore, just a metaphorical pile in his mind.
It seems he was doomed from the start to have a life dripping in the crimson and viscous liquid that is blood, and stained from the faint burn marks of the wings belonging to a fallen sibling.
“That's us.” Dean spat the words out quickly, turning around to take them from the barista’s hand. He rushed out of the door, the small tinkling sound of the welcome bell and the blood rushing to his ears drowning out the sound of Cas’s call from behind.
“Don’t, Sam.” Dean closed his eyes. “Please.” The words felt like swallowing shards of broken glass.
(And unbeknownst to him, there was also a small pile of sugar at the bottom, the coffee so saturated it wouldn't dissolve any more.)
Dean groaned. “Cas there isn't one in the county, let alone Lebanon. That's probably why Sam and Eileen make their own.”
“Oh just, give it here.” Dean said. He took a long sip from the disposable cup. He could taste a vague hint of whipped cream mixed in with the coffee, its light fluffy texture sticking to the last swallow of smooth liquid in the bottom of the cup. The chocolate and espresso rested on his tongue, and the peppermint was strong and refreshing. He took another sip.
“So,” Cas started while Dean reached into the cabinet for his own mug. “What ingredient do you suggest I put in my coffee this morning?”
Dean glared at her before trying his own coffee, and well, it was coffee. The point of buying expensive caffeine still went straight over his head.
They both sat in silence for the next hour, peacefully drinking their coffee and enjoying the presence of one another.
Face stained from tracks of salty tears, he unscrewed the lid of Cas’s makeshift urn, jerry rigged from miscellaneous things found in the back of Baby’s trunk.
He turned back to the map and wished he could set his glass against the block of colour that was Kansas and the dot that was Lebanon and say:
“You would be so mad, because it’s stupid.” He spoke quietly into the phone again, eyes stinging from listening to Cas’s voice. “Facing off against Chuck by tricking him like this. We might die.” He said simply, voice lacking any emotion besides apathy.
Sam was honestly overjoyed to see his brother finally happy. He would even go as far as saying finally willing to be himself, too. (Not that he would ever say this outloud. Sam can practically see Dean’s eyes roll farther back into his head than should be possible at the words.) All four of them had gone through more shit in the last few months than any normal person would in their entire life. They were all just lucky to be alive, and with that, learning how to savour the little moments of overly sweet normalcy.
They had been two nuns, their fate a product of hate crime. Put to death for simply being themselves.
Dean stood there, silent, watching as a bee flew across his eyeline, its fuzzy body flying over the goldenrod and onto the primrose, petals of sunshine yellow and white.
Dean smiled at him, setting his own mug down and moving Cas’s out of the way to pull him into a kiss. He could smell the nutmeg almost as much as he could taste the cinnamon on his lips.
Across the painted ocean sat his phone. Far enough away that its heat didn't burn him, but close enough to provide warmth.
“And the lovely lady sitting next to him would like the strongest drink you have. Her name is Robert.”
(He wasn’t about to have any black-eyed minions reporting his Starbucks order to a very judgmental Queen of Hell.)
It hurt to see that expression on Cas, and it hurt to be the reason that expression was there, whether he was real or not.
Cas rested his head on the crook of Dean’s neck and whispered. “You know you don't have to pretend.”
They walked into the building, immediately hit with the overwhelming smell of excessive amounts of flavoured syrup indoused coffee. Dean glanced around the well-lit building, taking note of the many different people there.
Sam appeared behind him, worry on his face. “Eileen and I were…” He cleared his throat. “We were thinking about getting away for a while.”
Dean laughed before turning to Cas. “Let's just go get in line before we suffer at the hands of the Leahy like Sam.”
Even Claire wouldn’t be caught dead in that place, with all the frou-frou toppings, elaborate drink mixes, and colourful, drizzled syrup. The people who go to Starbucks are the kind of people who like coffee that doesn’t taste like coffee. Teenage girls who might as well just be drinking whip cream, and that was without considering the seasonal drinks they fawn over.
Sam leaned over to Dean, neither one taking their eyes off of Cas. “Should we tell him the drink is seasonal?” He glanced at Sam, before staring back at his partner, whose face was beaming like a literal ray of sunshine.
“It's ‘assbutt.’” Cas said, walking up to them and catching the tail end of their conversation. “And that's my line.”
He watched as the last remaining pieces of Cas floated into the sky, which was turning a mix of golden yellow and orange as the sun rose from the depths of the darkness in which it sleeps at night.
“You’re just mad you didn’t get shotgun.” Dean said, closing his own door. “Besides, driver picks the music, everyone else shuts their cakehole.” Sam mouthed the words along with Dean, having heard the speech a million times before.
Cas had millenniums to choose from, but always found the most interesting hunts to be the ones with the Winchesters. He also had many hilarious stories about his adventures with Crowley, but he was less fond of those.
The room was filled with the faintest of glows. The candle was running out of wax, and the wick was barely intact. Its flame was too dim to see it was crying out for help.
Sam’s favourite story to tell changed every time, and one would almost be inclined to believe that most of it wasn't real, but the wildest parts also caused the most merriment. (Dean pretended he hadn’t witnessed the whole thing, sparing Sam by not telling the other two how it actually went down.)
Before either of them could respond, Cas shoved his mug into Dean's face. “You have to try this, Dean. It tastes like pumpkin pie.”
“Can we please listen to something other than Bob Seger on the trip home?” Sam complained as he slammed shut the door to Baby’s backseat.
About what the hell he was thinking, kissing Cas out in public like that. The judgemental eyes- black or not- that were watching. He thought about what his father would say, mind instantly going back to a moment in his childhood he has tried to forget since it happened, wondering where he went wrong.
Cas, meanwhile, turned to a random page of the lore book resting on the table and started reading in an attempt to pass the time.
“Uh.” Dean cleared his throat. “What-what do you have?” He indicated Cas’s coffee by angling his head towards where it sat on the nightstand.
by Taylor Swift and it's entirely possible he's listened to it once or twice but he still doesn't approve of it,
The cynical quote truly made sense to him now, because Cas deserved everything and ended up with nothing but a place to die.
He turned to look at the old, creaky windmill. Seemingly dilapidated and abandoned with only a cursory glance, he treaded up to it slowly, as if not to wake the creatures inside.
“Well, I would hope not.” It smiled gleefully. “Because not only is he not coming, but he's actually
The first thing he did was fall into Cas’s arms and grip that stupid trenchcoat until his knuckles turned white. Shaking and laughing with hot tears streaming out of his eyes, he told him he was an asshole for leaving him like that. And to never, ever do it again. With blurry eyes and all other thoughts hazy, he told Cas he could have it, he could have what he wanted. Whatever he wanted. He told Cas he loved him too.
Dean cleared his throat. “Ahem, sorry. The tall one with the stupidly long hair,” he pointed towards Sam, “is getting…” he trailed off before looking to Cas for help.
When they got out of bed and ventured into the rest of the bunker, they found Sam and Eileen in the library.
Cas smiled warmly, reaching the crinkled corners of his eyes. “They have a cinnamon flavoured one. That’ll be almost like apple pie.”
“I love you too.” He whispered absentmindedly, staring straight ahead and seeing nothing but thoughts from the past. His mind fighting an internal battle, logic telling him that what he had with Cas wasn’t wrong, and even though everything from fate to God had tried to wedge itself between them, it was still the most right thing he had. And he knew that, but his dad’s drunken, booming voice echoed throughout his head, telling him that he was dirty. Telling him the Winchester men had no place for someone like him.
“Do you want some of mine?” Cas asked. “There's a little bit left, and I held it next to the heater. It should still be lukewarm.”
Cas walked over to him, making eye contact in a silent question. Dean nodded with a small smile, and Cas took his hand.
“What do you mean? Can you not…” Dean closed his mouth slowly. “Nevermind.” He shook his head. “Thought I saw something.”
“What would you like?” Cas asked him, eyes still filled with a sparkle that only comes from gaining something you thought you lost.
“Cas?” Dean whispered, confusion swirling through his mind. He gripped the phone tighter, and his knuckles turned white.
“Yeah-h.” He said shakily. Before he could figure out who he was apologizing to, a voice from behind the counter called.
About how the left side of his face had been a yellow-ish purple for weeks following, and the sore spot on his arm from where he caught the pavement as he flew towards it.
It was good to see Cas filled with so much simple joy. Face creased from laughter rather than stress, he seemed so much lighter. Happier. It was only a small sliver of what he deserved, but it was something. Maybe he could live with driving an hour to get what he assumed was half-decent coffee.
Dean outwardly cringed. “Keep trying, you'll get there eventually.” He patted Cas on the back, which was slightly moving in a chuckle.
The feeling of having something powerful enough to kill an angel shoved through his abdomen. Black liquid flowing out in globs of polluted grace, or his own soul shattering at the hands of another, lighting up the sky in bright blue, face becoming a Jack-o-lantern as it shone through his eyes and his mouth.
With a pang of guilt from the memory, Dean pulled himself closer to Cas and rested his head on the other man’s chest. He wrapped his arms around him, trying to preserve as much warmth and comfort as he could until they had to inevitably get out of bed. “Only if you let me sleep like this for thirty more minutes.”
Dean gave up on letting them choose the music after snickering and requesting “Friday” by Rebecca Black for the third time in a row.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, trying to replace the image of Cas being pulled into the depths of tangible darkness with stars.
Dean carefully grabbed the hot mug from Cas and took a sip. He was right, it did taste kinda like pumpkin pie. He took another sip, letting the pleasant flavor sit on his tongue. The different spices mixed perfectly together.
“You know what?” He reached out and grasped Cas’s hand firmly. “I was thinking about being less boring. What ingredients do you suggest I try?”
About how he vowed to never disappoint his father like that again, and their joint hatred for that part of him. Sometimes it felt like the only thing they could agree on.
Dean blinked a couple times, clearing the fog from his mind, before laughing along with him. “And who’s fault is that? You were the one who insisted on traveling across the state to get it.”
“That’s right. And if they want any pie, they gotta help make it. That means more for us if they refuse.” He grinned.
He held his yellow and black striped, bee-themed ceramic mug Eileen had bought him in one hand, and the entire five-pound bag of cane sugar in the other. And there he stood, happy as can be, pouring it directly into his mug.
The phone rang four times before Cas's voice broke out, and Dean smiled as his confused tone was perforated with lightheartedness.
They didn’t whisper to hide, and it wasn't because he was ashamed. It was because that exchange was just for them.
Cas walked into the line, leaving Dean to scan the room, furiously waving Sam over when his eyes found their booth.
Cas made sure no one was watching before gently placing a hand on Dean’s thigh. Knowing it would comfort him from both intuition and experience. Dean stiffened under the touch, but after realizing no one could see where Cas’s hand was, he visibly relaxed.
The ride back was more manageable, Dean allowing them one song choice each, complete with a warning to pick wisely.
“...Make our own drinks.” Eileen snapped her fingers as she finished for him, attempting to save them from the endless stream of good-natured insults Dean would throw at them otherwise.
“I love your silly little tie, and your head tilt, and I love the way you sniff all the candles when we go grocery shopping, even if I pretend to be annoyed. I love how much you care about your family. How you were raised to be a warrior, to have hands covered in nothing but blood, yet you still manage to be the most loving person
He sat the book down on the table, before turning to walk out of the library as fast as he had come in.
Every word Fake Cas uttered made his heart ache even more. Dean wanted to reach out and touch him, but Cas wouldn't even look at him.
Cas was leaning on the counter, humming some song that Dean could neither recognize, nor would he approve of,
Dean’s favourite story to tell, aside from the fact that he killed Hitler, was the time he got to solve a mystery with everyone’s favorite talking dog. And yeah, all three of the people that sat at the table had heard both many times before, but that didn't matter, it was still enrapturing to hear them again.
“I don't care what coffee you like, Dean. What I do care about is that you went all the way to Starbucks, and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to come.”
“I'm a human, you ass.” Cas responded, a smile tugging at his lips. “Besides, I know you liked mine yesterday.”
Fake Cas appeared inside the bunker when he walked in, and the black sludge in his chest felt like it was ripping apart his organs.
By that time the following day, Dean thought they were both going to die. The bloody and uneven sigil on the wall, Cas no more than ten feet away. Not quite within a comforting reach. The room was spinning from the blow to his head, and he could barely make out the words being spat from Ishim’s mouth.
His thoughts traveled back to Ishim doing the same thing with his coffee, in the tiny little diner Cas had set up as a meeting place. Dean had barged in that day, not thinking of his brother mocking him, or the possibility of danger inside. His vision was as tunneled as his thoughts  focused only on Cas, not caring about anything else.
Sam nodded, before walking towards Eileen. “Let’s go.” He signed. She smiled at him, motioning towards the door with a swoop of her hands.
The screen remained blank, almost tauntingly, but the memories that flashed in his mind threatened to choke him.
“Sam, come here, it's urgent.” His brother turned to look at him, rolling his eyes before getting out of the booth.
Caffeine is a hunter’s number one best friend, and since Cas was human again, Dean knew Sam was going to come at him with his stupid green health drinks and herbal tea. As Cas’s
Dean reached the bottom of the stairs first, and walked over to the War Room table to set both coffee cups and his keys down.
“Okay, okay. You win.” He put his hands up, mimicking a surrender. “I'll try some of your stupid, Christmas cookie, candy-cane flavoured coffee thing or whatever.” They started walking towards the entrance to the bunker.
The bottle’s label was saturated in condensation, and the tips of Dean’s fingers were numb from picking at it.
“Let me say that again, in case you weren’t listening. It's an hour away. For coffee. That isn't even that good.”
The figure of Dean melted into a puddle of black, before taking on the form Cas was used to calling his own.
It was cruel, like striking a match against the wick of a candle, only to find there was no wax left to burn.
“I would like a…” Dean squinted at the menu, looking for the cinnamon flavoured coffee. “‘Cinnamon Dolce Latte.’ And my devilishly handsome friend here will take the pumpkin spice version.”
He enjoyed the small touch of Cas’s hands on his back, moving him forwards to the line, but was grateful Cas was careful not to let them linger there too long.
His phone burned to touch, and his heart ached. The black sludge wasn't letting him breathe, and he felt like he was bleeding out of the gaping hole in his chest.
“Found it.” Sam called from the other side of the kitchen, walking over and putting a hand on Eileen’s shoulder.
He tried to wipe the tears away, hearing his Dad’s voice in his head and knowing he was being stupid.
“I know Jack misses you a lot. Sam, too. So, just, hang tight. We’ll find a way to come get you outta there, I promise.”
“Uh.” Dean was still caught off-guard by Willie Wonka over there. “Sure Cas.” He took the coffee pot from his hand and muttered a thank you.
He blinked slowly, before the sinking feeling of hopelessness dragged him into an incursion of despair.
The colour of sticky, red blood as it flowed from open, gaping wounds. His own hands were stained with it.
“Oh that's exciting.” Sam joked. “If I got you a lemon to go with it, would you be able to handle that?”
Dean looked aghast. “I would starve.” He attempted to sign his indignant response, hands moving sloppily while holding both his mug and the coffee pot.
“I thought it was across state lines and in Nebraska at first, but it looks like there's a small one in a town called Washington. It's about 80 miles from here.”
“Jack… he’s going to try and save you, can you believe that? We're coming. We're coming, Cas, and you just have to hold on a little longer.”
Dean swallowed thickly, before nodding. “Thank you.” He whispered softly, before walking back towards Baby.
“Do your lungs hurt?” He asked in a voicemail, not expecting a response. He sat in the darkness of his room, holding the phone like his life depended on it.
He held his own face in his hands, calling out in one last prayer, voice breaking along with the damn in his mind.
“You wanted to properly understand a flavour you didn't like?” Cas walked up to Dean and pulled the nearest chair out to sit down.
He heard Cas get out, his feet making a crunching noise as they hit the gravel, and watched from across the top of the car as he started towards the coffee shop. Dean looked at the building warily, reluctance painted on his face.
When he wrapped his fingers around the phone and pulled it towards him, the screen was blank again, call seemingly never there.
He couldn't unwrap the fuzz from around him, so he didn't know what Cas was saying, ears seemingly filled with cotton. It was just the knowledge alone that he was there. That he was holding him and whispering comforting words into his ear. That even as a human he could heal Dean at his lowest points, and still see him as the brightest, strongest, soul.
Fake Cas sat across from him, the perpetual look of sadness on his face. Dean couldn’t even make this version of Cas smile, and it broke his already aching heart.
He pulled the sleeve of his flannel over his palm, and  pushed away the brambles and crawling bushes covered in thorns. This small movement unearthed what the average person would miss, as the overgrown greenery gave way to a small wooden gate underneath. He pushed it open with ease, time and weathering making it swing on its hinges with little force.

I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
“I’m Dean Winchester, and that’s my brother, Sam.” His brother’s namesake answered, then skeptically looking at his brother’s namesake. “Is that seriously your real name, dude?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This chapter is inspired by CM 5x9 mostly in the last eleven minutes of the episode. Spoilers for the episode at the bottom of the chapter, for anybody who hasn’t (and isn’t) going to see it, that explain where the inspiration came from. I am fucking in love with CM, by the way, not that it’s relevant here. I’m referring to the CM glossary site for terms like ‘blitz attack.’
If they would go on the hunt, it ran too much of a risk that they would be outnumbered, too much of a drive back and forth between here and Tully, and the three hunters wouldn’t accept two total strangers’ help. It made perfect sense, although the collateral damage clearly meant nothing to Samuel, who moved on with his own plan for that evening.
“Let’s go.” Present Cas said as he and Dean started to head out of the abandoned house. “Castiel,” the archangel warned, and the two turned toward him, “I'm warning you. Do not leave me here. I will find you.”
? If I recall correctly, it means something like wolves and battle.” The older of the two brothers suggested with a smug smile. “I’m the most feared in this family after all.”
it’s safe for two trips there?” He questioned with worry laced in his normally stoic voice. “Is there any time to wait?”
After Samuel’s would-be attackers left, business at the bar became slow and his namesake told him to sit down and take a break, just seeing him lost in thought like that wasn’t a good thing. Their manager was out for the evening and it was just Samuel, his namesake, and Lindsay working that night, so it was safe. Once he sat down and grabbed his law book from behind to bar to continue reading in the corner of the room, his namesake quickly texted D and told him what had just transpired. The next thing Samuel knew was that his brother was there, pulling up two chairs to sit down at the small table.
I tried for it not to sound bland in describing what occurs in the episode and threw in some Destiel references. Hopefully, I focused more on the boys than the time-travelers, and still had enough of the latter to provide more of a mystery.
“Samuel, listen. You’re not evil and your dad’s wrong for thinking it was and pushing it on you and your twin. My dad believed something similar, but anyways, don’t believe any of that crap.” His namesake told him quietly in a profoundly serious and concerned manner. “You’re not destined to be evil and what you do matters, no matter what he thinks. You’re a good person, and you choose to be good, right?”
He’d never been so angry with Sam and Emma before, and had a few more choice words than he normally would with his semi-identical twins. A week late apology and an explanation of how worried they made him didn’t take away the stinging of being told that they ruined his chance of getting their stepmother back.
When Rebekah joined the family business a year prior to this, her boyfriend-turned-husband had told her of all the stories he knew of. This event, regarding the hunters Ellen Harvelle and her daughter, Jo, would die if they didn’t arrive in time, assuming that they had their timelines right. Now, the three futuristic hunters and angel were in the designated town of the demon attack. Castiel timed it out for them to arrive a few minutes
“You and Sammy have a fucked-up way of showing you care about each other.” Danny snapped, causing his older sister to glare at him and opened her mouth to argue back. “Both of you, stop it. Arguing over it will solve nothing.” Angelika said firmly, interrupting her granddaughter. “You’ve just arrived here. Why don’t you kids just go lay down and relax?”
What made Dean think it was okay to put himself in danger like this? If none of them knew about this, then he would be thrown into the post-apocalyptic 2014 without warning! Why was he should be damn careless about his own life and insistent about saving Sam’s, like his own life didn’t matter? It
“Demons. Demons.” Present Cas answered, who had no idea how to talk to humans, outside of the modern Winchester’s and the three time-travelers. If only there was a YouTube video on teaching angels how to interact with normal people.
“I…I don’t have impure intentions, and this was exactly what I’ve been trying to avoid...Your condemnation and judgment, and your wrath, I deserve right now. I wanted to tell my namesake t-that I know what he’s going through.”
Sam ran his hand through his hair in his frustration. “I’m fine.” He answered with a warning look toward his brother, pushing his floppy bangs out of his face displaying his guilt-tripping blue eyes. “Drop it.”
He forced himself to grab his duffel-bag and leave the room. Him and his older sister hadn’t come up with a plan for Lucifer yet as they just finished breakfast. They figured that at least a few demons followed them there. Danny and Emma were hopefully not going to be staying in their old rooms, not that they didn’t like spending time with their grandparents, though. Those rooms were filled with memories that neither Winchester sibling wanted to remember.
The boy sighed, clearly remorseful. “I’m not purposely trying to hide things from you. I didn’t want you to think I’m mentally incompetent for needing them.” He said, meeting the younger Winchester’s eyes with shame. “I promise, no more secrets, as my brother occasionally says to brighten serious moment, no chick flick moments.”
“I can’t sit here on my ass. My daughter’s out there somewhere.” Ellen said determinedly and hurried over there. “I’m not back in half an hour, go. Get these people out of here.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The angel had only known of the futuristic Winchesters for a couple of days now after barely escaping God, or Chuck as He preferred nowadays, in 2020 to get help with idea of going back to the past.
Sam especially noticed this when they went to a small department store to get Samuel a burner phone, since he didn’t own a phone from the present-time. There was no way the kid could’ve had enough money after paying for his room at the motel, given that Samuel barley had enough cash for his motel room.
“Look, Sam—it doesn’t matter—whatever we do. I mean, it turns out that you and me, we’re the, uh, the fire and the oil of the Armageddon.” Dean said sadly with emotion in his voice. “You know, on that basis alone, we should just pick a hemisphere. Stay away from each other for good.”
his angel was that serious. Present Cas never went into details of what they found, or what was even said, in Dean’s defense. They could’ve come up with nothing for all he knew for now.
They approached the cans of rock salt and both began putting as many cans as possible inside the bags. “My great-uncle was John Winchester, and I don’t know if you remember he had a younger brother…” The kid paused, like he was trying to form his words correctly. “Anyways, Uncle John’s brother had twins and one of those twins is my dad, who named me and one of my brothers after you and Dean.
The young woman at the table appeared more worried than anything and she sighed. She had long, curly dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and tanned skin dressed in a simple light blue V-neck t-shirt and light brown skinny jeans with a deep frown on her face. She looked around the age as Sam was, or a little older than him, and the shortest out of all three of them.
“My wife’s eyes turned black. She came at me with a brick.” The man with glasses said, bringing his right hand to his chin with a ring on it. “Kind of makes you embrace the paranormal.”
I watched the Heathers and that got my brain moving for ideas and plus, I didn't go into many details of what the eight years of demon blood could have done to Emma's body. Can she still walk through Devil's Traps or does she wince at first, and does salt\holy water\holy oil hurt her skin? I can't believe I overlooked those details for a time, but it's fixed now.
Sam had gone his separate ways with Dean a week ago, and both were accompanied by at least one of the three time-travelers. He assumed that his older brother resumed hunting while he tried to settle himself into a normal life and had plenty of questions for the time-traveler named after him, who had been on vague on a few questions.
The town is returned to normal after Sam and his namesake are rescued, War is rendered powerless by the loss of his ring, and something tells the boys that won't be seeing the last of the three time-traveler's anytime soon.
After eating and getting back on the road and deciding to not stop at a motel for the night, when future Cas appeared to them and told them about the next event. Zachariah, that winged dick, was going to appear to Dean, and send him into the future of post-apocalyptic 2014 after abruptly deciding to part with Sam. They were currently halfway there in Towanda, Kansas, and it would another two hours until arriving in Kansas City.
Rebekah was about to speak up when the door opened and saw their namesakes and Ellen come inside, noticing her husband involuntarily flinch again at the sound. “
silver cross earring back in his ears as the cross pendents helped him feel safer, not caring what his grandparents thought of it. Lastly, he combed his
“Yeah, what the bastard implied is true, though it’s not like he would know about my twin.” The hunter admitted with a sigh, then hesitated once more with more tension in his tone. “When my twin, Emma, and I were six months old, the resurrected son of a bitch Azazel killed our mother and fed us both his blood to re-release Lucifer one day.”
Two passersby ignored the man while Dean got out of the Impala, locked it up, and headed for the hotel. “Excuse me, friend, but have you taken time out to think about God’s plan for you?” The Bible salesman said, addressing the older Winchester, who stopped and looked at him. “Too friggin’ much, pal.” He said, understandably frustrated, and entered the hotel.
“Jesus fucking Christ, just go get help! You’ll get caught, too, if you stay. What good would that do anybody?!” He yelled at them, making them realize how truly screwed they would be if they got themselves caught as well. “Go find the hero Sam and Ellen already, for fuck’s sake!”
This chapter is finally done. I hope I kept the boys and Ellen in character, so if I didn’t, I’ll improve that in the next chapter. I mostly relied on the transcript for this episode since it’s easier for me to read it instead of re-watching while writing the chapter.
could he kill them? It couldn’t be what he suspected, so they must have had a weapon unknown to him and Dean.
“So...you gonna tell me who those guys back there really were? And don’t say hunting buddies. Is Samuel
The heroes Sam and Dean would frown on it, and especially her father, who taught her and her siblings to
Sam didn’t want to bring it up; maybe his brother was just drunk when he’d said that, or maybe it was what he feared most, the older Winchester had been sober and had meant it. Perhaps he regretted saying it or he was waiting for the right moment to kill Sam when he wasn’t expecting it.
“And there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the river, and the name of the star was Wormwood. And many men died.” He read, and the pastor spoke up, “Revelation eight ten. Are you saying that this is about the apocalypse?”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samuel knew that his namesake took issue with his preferred method of protecting those he cared about, yet he felt that he couldn’t allow himself to be negligent toward his namesake. He also knew that especially Dean and Rebekah took issue with that method, and he had to explain himself to his namesake, who didn’t understand him that well.
Dean seemed to be deep in thought for a moment. “Of course. How about you’re our sister?” He suggested. “We can say you’re our step-sister or adopted sister. It makes sense you’d keep the same last name as us.”
“Why didn’t you tell me? I don’t care if it’s next week or a month from now, if you’re in danger and you know it, you tell me, Goddamnit! Did you know Samuel planned to tell you something he doesn’t want me to hear?”
“I mean there were times when I was looking for my dad when all logic said that he was dead,” Dean elaborated, “but I knew in my heart he was still alive. Who cares what some ninja turtle says, Cas, what do you believe?”
A group of three people sat inside a small, two storeyed house in a pleasant German suburb in Berlin. They sat in the dining room at a moderately long black table with a worn out, black railed chandelier with a dimmed light on it. One could hear a middle-aged woman in the kitchen listening to a German podcast on her phone whilst cooking a meal on the stove, not too far from the dining room. Also, one could hear an old TV in the living room, where a middle-aged man was watching football and unwinding in a comfortable recliner.
The hero Sam looked at him with worry and laced with his being uncomfortable in hearing Samuel’s response. “Dude, it’s like you worship me,
“You wouldn’t do that.” The hero Sam said in disbelief as Samuel stood beside him, ready to pull his revolver any time now. “It’s funny how watching your best friend die changes that.” Tim said as Reggie walked away from Lindsay, and right beside him.
“We’ll go together, just you and me.” The hero Dean insisted, much to Sam’s exasperation and growing impatience, but kept quiet out of respect for his younger brother’s namesake as much as he wanted to tell him how pointless it was to try to control what he did. If his father tried and failed nearly every time in that task when it got in the way of what the futuristic hunter knew was the right thing to do, then the hero Dean couldn’t either. “Those three will just keep a lookout here.”
Dean didn’t argue, nor did he disagree. There were some things about his older brother that he couldn’t change, and this unfortunately was one of those things. “Okay, but you can’t constantly watch Rebekah on cases either.” He said. “We’ll stand out too much and you know there’s more discreet ways to keep her safe.”
Things take an unexpected turn as they investigate a town overrun by demons when they meet three suspicious people claiming to be time-travelers. Two of them coincidentally have the same first names as the boys and a sister named Rebekah.
If Dean weren’t already convinced that the three time-travelers were who the said they were, he would be now. Ellen seemed to be on board with the idea now, at least. How else would they know that, unless one of them had visions?
at the tall kid, wondering what he meant, and it sounded to be an odd way to comfort his sister as they arrived at the church. Ellen turned around before going inside, looking at the three hunters in behind them. “You both okay?” She asked, looking specifically at the younger two siblings.
a rogue angel and remain so, according yourself decades from now, even assisting in those humans’ attempt to change the present. Remember, I will find them and take them to Michael also.”
The young man cursed himself for not realizing that Dean and Rebekah’s misinformation about his intricate nature could also be believable to the hero Sam, and of course, the hero Dean probably believed it to. He loved his family, honestly, but they didn’t understand him at all sometimes and their irrational version of it
After driving a couple of hours, Rebekah took over driving for him whilst Samuel and D slept in the backstreet, looking about to fall on each other if the car drover over a speed bump. Sam fell asleep in the passenger’s seat to a classic rock station playing in the background.
The kid started cleaning glasses at the bar as one of the other two hunters, resumed conversation with Sam and Lindsay. “Hunting buddies. With his dad.”
D's merely resembles the attire Sam and Dean were on the show, and he outwardly shows a distinctive personality, but doesn't like drawing attention to himself and prefers to blend in with his surroundings. He doesn't care about what people perceive his appearance, like Emma, but she'd need something better than just flannel.
He shook his head with a frown. “With all due respect, the only way I get through life is through knowing what you’d do in a situation because you’re a good person and an upstanding hunter. I don’t mean to come off as worshiping you…It’s just…” He said quietly, trying to find the right words. “My dad taught me to always follow your morals, or else I give into my inherent evil. Why wouldn’t I want to aspire to be like somebody as ethical as you?”
Emma tried not to think about where Sam, Dean, and Rebekah were, as she sat down on the bench not far from the metro bus stop and ignore her twin senses. The only Winchester daughter didn’t believe in any of that otherworldly twin connection stuff unless you count the visions her and Sam shared when they were teenagers. She couldn’t shake the idea that Sam may had just had a run-in with a hunter from the past, but it was reasonable to think that she’d been so worried about him that it was probably just nothing. Her twin didn’t often show fear and other vulnerable emotions in front of other people, but when he did, it was visible.
The plan was set, given that Dean and Rebekah brought his namesake and Ellen up to speed on what would likely happen now. They significantly altered the events of what was supposed to happen so far, so there was no telling what would end occurring instead now.
Either way, Dean told Sam and Rebekah to just try to get comfortable and get a little bit of sleep in, as the narcotics were
another way you can do it.” He answered more optimistically than the boy thought he deserved in a quiet tone. “You don’t need to spy on anybody, and you don’t need to hover around anybody to keep them safe.”
She looked at herself in the over-door full length mirror and stared at herself with disgust, feeling like a demon and vampire hybrid.
Rufus kicked Dean in the crotch, then hit him in the chest and in the face. The older hunter lunged for his dropped gun, and Dean hauled him back against the wall. Rebekah grabbed Rufus’ gun.
I probably spent more time researching for this part of the story than I should have, but I wanted to be extra safe and I hope I didn't write anything offensive or stereotypical. That and having writer's block recently, so thankfully, I already have ideas for my futuristic characters in the next chapter!
“Let’s forget about the brat for now, then. Save your protests for your brother. I can see inside your head. And man, it is one-track city in there. Blood, blood, blood. Lust for power. Same as always. You want to be strong again.” War said, taunting him further. “But not just strong. Stronger than everybody. Good intentions—quick slide to hell, buddy boy. You feel bad now? Wait till you’re thigh deep in warm corpses. Because, my friend, I'm just getting started.”
Dean looked undecided. “Yeah, for further evidence if we have to prove our identities, if they’ll even believe it.” He said. “You can’t order me around like you normally do since they’ll think you’re younger.”
Unfortunately, the name Samuel didn’t have a lot of different nickname options, so the younger kid suggested either the full form of his first name or the middle name he couldn’t stand more, which was Henry. Out of the two options, the boy chose to be called Samuel, unless they had to hide their identities.
At a table at the brothel, Dean drank while present Cas was noticeably terrified. The hunter wanted to see his friend relax, and if this would be their last night out (God, he hoped not!), he wanted Cas to enjoy himself here.
“Oh yeah. You were wasted by a teenage mutant ninja angel.” Dean said, recalling what future Cas said as he walked back over to the sink and picked up his knife, and began washing it. “So, what, you think you can find this dude and he’s just gonna spill God’s address?”
I wanted to try something to make the alternating POVs more organized and I thought that it might be a good idea to try flashbacks in between. Those will be in italic text, and I hope that it does make more sense than the way the past few chapters’ POVs have been alternated between.
“I can find you, just have some damn patience. You remind me of Sam. I’m not talking about your twin.”
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
Emma couldn’t fault her twin for the times he honestly did try to understand why her, their two brothers, and Rebekah would get angry at him for his insensitivity, hence why telling him how she felt about how he’d ruined things for her all the time. Sometimes he didn’t even realize it, given that he had a rather pretentious personality, and when he did control himself, he normally did it well if he cared to put in the effort to.
What was Samuel like before he changed? If he even changed at all, that is. As far as Sam knew, the kid could’ve been like this before his father went off the rails, based on the vague details Dean had told him of about Samuel’s childhood.
The family moved to America when the twins were ten, Dean’s namesake was eight, and Danny was six, where the older three had their initial training. Until then, they stayed in Berlin and in one place.
Rebekah interrupted him, scowling in irritation. “Stop being such a fucking diva, Sam.” She snapped, turning the car toward the left, where she saw a truck rest stop. Sam let out a sigh of relief at the same time as D and Rebekah, who looked more than happy to get out of the car filled with awkward silence.
“Okay, let me see if I can think of the best hunter who might be in the immediate vicinity—oh, that’d be you.”
“Look, man, what baggage is so heavy it can’t be stowed away for be stowed away for the freaking apocalypse?” Tim said, trying to convince him to help them, noticing a glare from Samuel.
Dean was in bed and he knew that his brother and the time-travelers wouldn’t let him be, just for a little while. Of course, it was because that winged dick Zachariah posed a threat, but right now, all he wanted was a few hours of sleep.
Apparently, the taller guy’s name was Sam and they were looking for another person coincidentally called Dean. Those couldn’t have been their real names, could it?
“Anyways, Sam,” Tim continued as if the younger hunter weren’t in the room, turning to his namesake, “Something you want to tell me? Must be important if you got pretty boy here covering your ass.”
“Guys! Please stop talking about me like I’m five. I’m the same age as you, Sam,” Rebekah said with her face red, obviously embarrassed by Sam and Dean’s overly protective ways, “and I’m not some helpless damsel in distress. I can protect myself when I have to.”
like his brother when it came to lack of self-control and not thinking before acting, from Dean learned after hunting with her for about a year. It was no wonder the couple hunted well together but had more a tendency to get injured together as well sometimes.
Emma took off her black trench coat and threw it across from her on the bed, and ran her hand through her shoulder-length black hair. Sam had worn that trench coat for a good few years before he hit
When he was just dating her in college, he noticed her resilience and he thought it was admirable and telling her that. He thought it was more admirable than ever now that Rebekah was willing to risk her life for a better future, but it honestly scared him how at peace she was with death. Not even Sam himself was at peace with death; he had too much work left to do.
If I can take up more of your time, I’d been thinking about whether the time-travelers Sam and Dean are different enough from their namesakes. What do you guys think? I believe there’s enough differences that make them their own personalities, instead of being a rip-off of who they were named after? What do you make of him, Dean’s namesake, and Rebekah? Is there anything that I can do to improve their character development if anything sticks out?
Cas had a backup plan, wait present Cas wasn’t his. Even if the play would work, would Raphael know about the time-travelers?
Whenever they weren’t in their respective motel rooms, Samuel watched him out of the corner of his eye with visible worry, like somebody would come in any second to kill his namesake without warning. Something was seriously scaring the kid, outside of what he already told the older-looking hunter, and he would find out one way or another.
“Fine, then let’s go.” The younger Winchester said, gesturing for the three siblings to go ahead of them and following up the stairs behind them.
The Winchester brothers didn’t expect to hear that the tall kid’s name was Sam and the brother him and his sister, Rebekah, was named Dean. If they believed in coincidences, it would ironic that their last name started with ‘w’ as well. Sam insisted that they stop and take a break somewhere safe while him and Dean would go find their brother, but both
Dean shot his brother a frustrated look, getting and heading toward the refrigerator. “So, you’re his vessel, huh? Lucifer’s wearing you to the prom, or he’ll get Samuel as a plan C?” He said, masking his emotions with nonchalance, as he got a beer out of the refrigerator. “At least you don’t get a field trip into post-Apocalypse 2014 with Zachariah.”
“No, by the time we spotted Reggie, he’d grabbed Lindsay already, and they locked us out.” Dean answered with visible concern on his face and a little bit more emotion in his stoic voice than usual. “Are you okay, Sammy? Is the hero Sam and Lindsay okay?”
“Yeah, who would be so proud to know His sons started the frigging apocalypse.” The older Winchester commented sarcastically.
? Doesn't that mean something like wolves and battle?” The older of the two brothers suggested with a smug smile. “I’m the most feared in this family after all.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danny gave her a matter-of-fact look. “You have powers, Emma, and I don’t even have a useful weapon.” He complained. “We can’t risk letting people think we’re criminals
Just because Sam’s no longer alone in his anguish, it doesn’t mean any of it is less painful than it is. He and Samuel meet with Dean and the other two time-travelers, whom the latter hunter purposes a plan to use himself as bait in Sam’s place when the hunters came for the younger Winchester to prove himself trustworthy to Dean.
Dean’s amulet,” and mentally cursed himself for wording it like that. “Anyways, they should be here not long after the attack begins. I have to go; be ready.”
“Sorry. Didn’t mean to bust you back there.” Tim said, then suspiciously looked at the younger-looking hunter, who really didn’t look like a hunter. “I don’t remember anybody asking you to sit down, kid. Mind leaving us alone?”
“It’s Rebekah. Your brother gave me your number and I need to update you on what’s going on our end of things. Sam—
“I have a solution I think you’ll like.” Sam said. “Similar to how we met in college as strangers initially, instead when I left for eight years, you came with me and enrolled as well.” Dean shook his head. “Sammy, you were out for eight years and you didn’t require as much refresher training.” He said.
“But that doesn’t explain why they’re not here, Danny.” Emma said in more confusion, shoving her ebony black floppy bangs identical to Sam’s away from her face and the blue eyes she also shared with him shown worry for them. “Maybe we could try praying to him, or maybe Castiel is on call, too?”
She nodded. “Yes, I will. You three just stay safe and come back alive, or your opa will raise hell.”
Present Cas stared at Dean with confusion as he went around the angel and tended back to his knife. “Give me one good reason why I should do this.” He said. “You from the future never said if we found anything, or if this was even that important.”
“That’s what I mean, Samuel. Somehow if you were groomed to take my place in the future, then I didn’t say yes to Lucifer, right?” Sam reasoned with the boy, who shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably. “You paid for my mistakes! Dude, that’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair that your brother’s paying for Dean’s.”
After moving to America, they stayed with Kyle Winchester, an older cousin, part-time hunter who ran an auto shop, and their father’s best friend, in Kansas City, Kansas for a while. Sometimes they stayed with a family friend, Steven Archer, who was a hunter who lived about an hour away in Lawrence, Kansas, who had been chosen as the kids’ godfather.
“Why? You gonna hate me any less?” The hero Sam elaborated, expressing pain Samuel himself had been experiencing since re-releasing Lucifer in the future. “Am I gonna hate myself any less? What do you want?”
his love in these two boys only seeing the roles reversed. “If you’re confident about your preparations as you seem to be, act on them now. Ellen and Jo Harvelle will die if you’re not careful.”
“I know who you are. And now, thanks to him, I know where you are. However, you want to refer to them, those humans don’t belong here, and another angel will take them back, even if I do not.” The archangel said. “We will deal take care of getting the rogue angel Castiel becomes back to where he belongs as well.”
Also, in the original story, D was originally born female, gender dysmorphic, and going through transitioning. I decided to alter that amongst other details and let D have been born male. I, myself, am not gender dysmorphic, or transgender.
until they left a few moments later. “Are you trying to get yourself killed?” He whispered to the boy, finding it difficult to be irritated with him, even if the kid seemed to be asking for them to kill him.
The three hunters sat at the table, and Samuel brought over three beers, pulled over a fifth seat to join them. Suspiciously, the younger Winchester didn’t protest him joining them, and he stood out like a sore thumb especially amongst fellow hunters. Though the thought wasn’t expressed by any of the three hunters aloud, Samuel looked more like a university student trying too hard to fit in at a school full of rich kids.
Samuel let out an audible groan. “Fuck!” He muttered under his breath, then shaking Rebekah’s shoulder, and waking her. “Sam, what?” She asked him tiredly, then glancing at the TV. “What…Are those…?”
“I know. I just...it used to be like...” He paused, thinking of how he could kill the demon, but save the person they took over. “I just wish I could save people like I used to.”
It was like a couple of years ago when Emma, and her sesquizygotic twin brother, Sam, opened the Devil’s Gate in Wyoming. It was either let their father lose his life to demons, or save his life and let the gate open, so the latter choice was the better of two evils. As a result, their father was extremely angry with them for letting Azazel get away with the Colt, who would have killed him if it weren’t for the twins’ intervention.
Dean’s namesake and her sighed as he began telling them snippets of his childhood, including brief explanations. Their father, Klaus Winchester, was one of the twins born to their father’s younger brother, Dan, thus making them distant cousins of Sam and Dean.
Meanwhile in the car, D and Rebekah were asleep in the backseat of the car, and the younger Winchester himself was starting to get tired. Samuel offered to drive for awhile and he moved over to the backseat. “Are you alright? I noticed your arms have burn scars and track marks all over them.” Sam said in concern, and the boy sighed as he ran one of his free hands through his hair before putting it back on the wheel. “You don’t have to, uh, tell me if you don’t want to.”
His brother groaned. “You’re exaggerating what I said, Sammy. You know that’s not what I meant.” He answered, rightfully irritated if the conversation went how they said it seemed to. “Can you
Here it is, episode three. My apologies that it’s taken this long to brainstorm some ideas amongst having a lot of online coursework on my plate now. I want to thank all of you who have read my story, left kudos on it, left comments, bookmarked it, and subscribed, it’s greatly motivating and encouraging.
“That definitely counts.” Dean said, then getting up and walked over to the bookshelf, and picked a Bible out of it. He bought it back to the table and searched through it.
Everyone was busy in the church. The shaggy-haired man and older woman were assembling sells, and the guy with glasses (apparently named Roger) was practicing loading a shotgun.
“Yeah, I’ll show you guys.” Rebekah answered as she began to lead the way there. “What are your names?”
The kid interrupted his apology with a sympathetic look on his face. “Why would you be the blame?” He said with confusion and empathy in his voice. “You didn’t know when I’d be born and you had no control over Azazel’s resurrection, or his plans to groom me as your successor.”
“That’s right. I’m sure Sammy told your brother about us being from the future, and that he’s named after your brother. I’m named after you, and we carry on the family business forty-seven years from now.” The older kid continued with sincerity in his voice, pulling the knife out of his jeans pocket. “Anyhow, it took us a long time to locate it, but we found your original knife last year.”
“Hey, what the hell happened here?!” Dean exclaimed as him and his brother noticed the blood stains on their clothes.
As always, thank you for reading, subscribing, and bookmarking this story. I apologize for not focusing enough on Dean’s perspective, regarding Sam trusting Ruby and being manipulated into releasing Lucifer. I admit that I accidentally focused too much on Sam’s perspective regarding this, so this first part (and the next) should remedy that mistake on my part.
The only Winchester daughter knew that torturing demons and drinking blood from them were to different things, and her twin unknowingly had indirectly drunk blood from Ruby a few times when a market was unavailable before he quit last year. Though she wouldn’t admit it out loud, she’d quit and get clean like her twin brother, if she saw another way to protect her family.
Though, he had nothing to call the boy, and he didn’t want to call him ‘kid,’ like Dean and Ellen kept referring to him as. They shared the same preferred nickname, so it would too confusing that way.
He asked his older-looking younger brother with annoyance in his tone, putting the makeshift paper bookmark in the law book, and closing it in his irritation. “
“How do we explain how Rebekah doesn’t seem like she had enough training?” Dean asked, then looking over at her. “No offense. You’ve become good in the past year.”
“No, I’d never consent to being Lucifer’s meatsuit, and nor would I intentionally put my namesake in danger. I couldn’t tell him right away because w…we were in public, and I…I’m terribly sorry for this misunderstanding.”
true that the kid had a seriously overly inflated ego and seemed to act like he was more important than he was, irritating the other employees and customers.
This chapter originally was meant to begin on episode one and found that a better introduction for my three characters would be episode two. I don’t have a lot of experience with writing Supernatural fanfics and I tend to not have a lot of luck with writing canon characters, but I’ll do my best. Now, as stated previously, the third person POV will mainly focus on Sam and Dean now.
“Because we’re humans.” Dean said, pulling out another fake ID and stashed it into the present angel’s coat, then adjusting that and his tie. Cas, present or future, took his breath away. “And when humans want something really,
Aside from the brief details of a traumatic and violent childhood, Dean’s namesake had mentioned that their father seemed to favor Samuel out of all them. In little ways, Klaus never punished Samuel for when he’d occasionally disobey direct orders, and even let him make suggestions on how to handle certain cases. All four of the kids could ask questions most of the time, but at times when he was incredibly angry, questions were forbidden to be asked. Samuel, though, disobeyed this rule often, and asked questions anyway, and received no punishment for it.
Thirteen years had gone by and they couldn’t stop Klaus from training his four kids into soldiers. It couldn’t be denied in an any way that Klaus was also a victim in this tragedy of a situation, given that one wife was killed in front of him and his second wife was kidnapped and presumably still being held hostage, although Sam tortured and killed Azazel sometime last year.
They weren’t many stories of what the hero Sam went through in his withdraws, and only a small handful of eyewitness descriptions survived throughout the years. According to his older twin siblings, the surviving descriptions were an understatement to what it actually felt like. Although Danny knew why they had to hold off until she went and got her fix, it didn’t make the situation any less frustrating.
He started taking his older three on hunts precisely starting at age nine, with the ghost cases. Samuel started going on vampire cases at age twelve, werewolf cases at age thirteen, and eventually demon cases at age fifteen. Emma and Dean’s namesake started around the same pace as Samuel, though he tried to protect Danny by not taking him on hunts when he was young.
Finally, the final part. Once more thank you for reading this, leaving kudos, commenting, subscribing, and bookmarking my story. Well, I made a mistake. Ellen and Jo don’t die in this episode, so I’ll write it as a miscalculation in the story, and they have more time to save the Harvelle’s.
“We were ambushed by people who thought we were demons. We thought they were demons, too.” The older kid spoke up with remorse, with neither of them not retreating to their little corner on the other side of the room. “They grabbed Sammy, and we tried to save him…” He couldn’t finish his sentence.
The boys could overhear the loud argument between the other pair of brothers from the picnic table they sat at. Sam and Dean could make out only a couple of words (technically names), and those were
Sam felt helpless and pathetic after Dean quickly checked his still intact stitches. He never really had to rely on his younger brother
Dean noticed in the details that John’s brother emulated about every aspect of his parenting on those four kids and driven by a similar obsession. His namesake tensed at the mention of ‘drastic parenting decisions,’ even more after those decisions required Klaus to apologize for whatever he did to his kids.
Danny leaned back in the dining room chair, visibly struggling to unwind. “If you have enough, can you get me an
Future Cas gave him a pointed look in return. “I’m serious, Dean. If you don’t agree to hunt with Sam again tonight, Zachariah will transport you to the alternate post-Apocalypse world in 2014.” He said with far more urgency and concern, and it shown on his face. “In that world, you regret not saying yes to Michael and your future self will urge you to say yes to him to prevent that future. You don’t need to say yes to Michael for a better future.”
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
Samuel slowly put his hand down toward his left jeans pocket, where his .44 Bulldog revolver was as Tim broke the silence. “Okay, fine. Let me give you some of my own, then.” He snapped at the hero Sam. “We go into town, we catch ourselves a demon, we get jumped by ten more. Steve bought it.”
It had been tense for past few days trying to locate Sam and the kid, and though Dean had a feeling he was right about what the boy wanted to tell his brother, it didn’t diminish his anger. Why did the kid want to hide it from him in the first place? He was so goddamn sick of secrets, and he hoped the boy didn’t have any more he was planning to keep from them.
if we’re undercover. There’s no way in hell I’m letting anybody call me Samuel, unless my namesake or Dean’s would rather call me that instead.” He relented. “Now that he’s using the letter
They noticed a welcoming banner hanging over the street to the town’s Pioneer Days and paused for a moment upon noticing a red classic Mustang that Dean expectantly admired and whistled with approval. Sam checked it and saw it was empty, and they were about to move on when they heard footsteps approach them. It was a couple, young man, and woman, probably two or three years, or maybe four years younger than Sam.
“You’re saying you and my namesake didn’t do what Heaven or Hell wanted you to do in the end, and they used us as a second chance to make things go the way they want?” D clarified, and Sam nodded, picking up his cup of coffee and taking a sip. “Even if it were true, neither of you are to blame.” The younger Winchester composed himself and drank from his cup of coffee. It would be bad if Lucifer, or any angels (Castiel aside) and demons overheard them. His youthful older brother looked at his namesake in concern as D picked up his cup of coffee.
She nodded, smiling. “Here’s what we play for. When I win, you buy me dinner and tell me your life story.” She suggested. “I’d ask Henry over there, too, but you know…”
He sighed in relief and stood up, gesturing for the hesitant young man to stand up as well. “It’s my brother. We’re safe, okay?” Sam assured the kid as his older brother walked down the aisles to the two demon’s dead on the floor and two identical knives, one just more worn out than the other, dripping blood.
Meanwhile in Garber, OK, Sam learns something new about the time-traveler named after him who seems to have more complex emotions than he realizes whilst waiting for Tim and Reggie’s attack, whose friend’s death they couldn’t help preventing. Dean and present Cas have summoned Raphael and find out what they can about where God is.
“He told me that if I should ever listen to my own instincts when it comes to hunting and keeping my family safe, I should always follow your example. You know I lack a lot of emotions and that can get civilians and other hunters killed if I rely on my own instincts.” The young man explained quietly with tension in his voice. “Dad made my twin and I aware that our demon blood makes us inherently evil, that we were chosen to have it for some reason. I’ve…breached it and…it resulted in Lucifer’s release, so bad things happen if I go without the code.”
Sam, Dean, and Rebekah were coming near a house that smoke coming out of the chimney and hid behind the another building to look. There was a visible black-eyed demon inside, and two demons attacked them. One of them, one who looked like Jo Harvelle, managed to grab Sam, and held him against the wall, taking his gun off him. A second one came from behind them, preventing their exit. Dean instinctively stabbed the demon, but the normal effects of killing a demon weren’t present.
Thank you all for putting up with my inconsistency and I'm sorry for this late notice on this work. I originally wrote this authors note with haste because I had to go and previously thought this one to be sufficient, for which all of you guys deserve more than that and I didn't mean to show any discourtesy. I apologize once more if I did offend anybody, I assure it's not intention. I probably didn't need to include those insignificant details, but I feel the need to explain why I should fix-up this authors note.
To clarify, Rebekah Kramer was originally, and still is somewhat, written as Jessica Moore parallel, though it’s become a lot more than that. I didn’t highlight the similarities the first time and I’m sorry for that.
The two Winchester siblings had already been talking about it, and neither of them wanted to leave Germany either. “Yeah, we were already about to suggest it to you, Opa.” Danny said sadly. “We just got here, too.” Emma added, equally as unhappy. Angelika nodded in agreement. “We’re not going anywhere, kids.” She reassured them with a remorseful look on her face. “Stay for the rest of the day since you’ve drank, and you should be safe to leave tomorrow. After you save the world, you’ll come and visit, right?”
The tragedy of the futuristic Winchester’s childhood was immediate, and things took a dark turn rather quickly. Klaus had been raised a hunter, along with his brother, as hunters, and moved to Petoskey, Michigan, for college. He met a young woman; whose name was Fiona. A few years later, his older twin siblings Samuel and Emma, were born in Frankfurt, Germany. Six months later, in Frankfurt, tragedy struck when Fiona died bloody in flames on the ceiling in the twins’ nursery.
For anybody who has read the original Progenitor King, does anyone notice any differences in Samuel’s character? Is he a bit more likeable than in the previous, or seem any less apathetic than before?
The two Winchesters finally arrived in the quiet suburb by cab, and the first thing they did was set their duffel-bags down and begin to take their shoes off upon being greeted by their grandparents. They found out more of the intricate details of what actually happened with Sam, Dean, and Rebekah, and were worn out.
“Samuel, are you okay?” He asked, helping the young man up, who took a deep breath and nodded. “Go find your brother and Rebekah. I’ll take care of Lindsay.” His namesake continued, and Samuel looked down at his revolver in his left hand, putting it back in his pocket as the excitement left his mind, and hurrying out of the entrance.
Sam and the kid were alone, wondering when they would be rescued for God knew how long so far. The door opened and it was Dean, and the two time-travelers. He never seen younger kid never looked more relieved than he was now.
It was outrageous, even John would frown on starting the training as young as seven! Dean’s father was no saint but taking a twelve-year-old to hunt vampires was something John
He pleaded in his mind, second guessing himself, and unlocked the back entrance. Dean and Rebekah, who fortunately looked uninjured, walked through it. “They didn’t get to you guys, did they?” He asked quickly.
“The truth is I spend more time worrying about you than about doing the job right.” Dean explained himself. “And I just, I can’t afford that, you know? Not now.”
“Kansas City.” Dean said, then leaning across the bed to grab his room key off the bedside table. “Century Hotel, room 113.”
Dean laughed. “You know, it’s kind of funny. Talking to a messenger of God on a cellphone.” He said humorously. “It’s, you know, like watching a Hell’s Angel ride a moped.”
I hope that one POV per chapter format will make this easier to read. I may or may not change chapter titles, add more dialogue, exposition, or give more insight into my OC’s lives before the events of this story took place.
Calmly with no surprise on his face, Dean looked at him. “We could just call you Samuel instead.” He said in a slightly teasing, only half-serious tone. “I’m using my middle name, or maybe just
The older kid shook his head. “Yeah, that’s what the bastard wants us to do. I didn’t remember that detail until I thought I killed a demon—not Jo, I promise you—but the usual effect of the knife didn’t show.” He said remorsefully. “I-I killed a person, I believe.”
This additional admission from Samuel proved that the arrogant persona he wore in public was merely just a mask to hide all his pain, guilt, and self-consciousness. He felt bad for asking about the burn scars and track marks the boy appeared self-conscious about, yet he wanted Samuel to know that he didn’t have to suffer alone.
“Well then. Sounds terrifying. It does. But, uh, hate to tell you, I’m not going anywhere with you.” Dean said, then walking over to grab a beer out of his cooler and took a swing of the beer. “You really think they’ll go with you without a fight?”
Dean and present Cas were at St. Peter’s hospital to summon, and trap, Raphael to get answers from him about God. In the older Winchester’s opinion, it wasn’t worth all that time. If God were to help, and if he were benevolent like believers often said, why didn’t he ever help any of them. What was with future Cas, though? He shook those thoughts from his head as he watched a nurse go down the hallway and slipped into Donnie’s—Raphael’s old vessel—room and shut the door behind him and closed the shades. Present Cas was already inside and poured holy oil in a circle around Donnie’s wheelchair.
the fact. His siblings, and especially his father, were broken in vastly different ways, and coped with stress in various unhealthy ways.
Worriedly, Sam asked future Cas how he could convince Dean to not go his separate way, even if the unpleasant visit from Zachariah wasn’t a deterrent enough, and present Cas said he’d talk to Dean. If that wouldn’t work, then the younger Winchester and the three time-travelers would have to figure out a way to reason Dean out of it. He moved to the backseat, and lay his head against the headrest, and hopefully get some sleep before arriving. Rebekah moved to the passenger’s seat, and Samuel offered to drive. D was nearly asleep when they were in Towanda, and the classic rock station helped lift the mood.
3 “You mean safe as in not getting murdered for my blood, Dean. War said it himself in front of my namesake, and I know he won’t think less of me for it. Your namesake will think of me as nothing less than the freak I am and the past Castiel will only think of me as an abomination I also am.”
The other young man fired again, missed, and aimed more carefully. Ellen approached, and pressing something to the pastor’s wound, making the young woman look up.
.” Tim threatened, then glanced back at Lindsay and back at Samuel and his namesake. “Or you don’t want to know what’ll happen. The kid knows, doesn’t he?”
The oldest futuristic Winchester sibling realized that his namesake probably wanted to ask him about what he meant back at the church.
The time-travelers may be a little over their heads right now, especially with Sam's namesake and Rebekah a little worse for wear right now. Stubborn and insistent on helping their ancestors, they're prepared for what's the come and may or may not have told them about Castiel providing the the time-travelers information.
What did the kid mean that death wasn’t permanent for them? Dean didn’t think of asking Cas if any other people had been pulled out of Hell, and it made him and his want to know who the hell these people were. “We’ll find your brother
“Look, I’ll be the first to tell you that this little crusade of yours is nuts,” the older Winchester said, “but I do know a little something about missing fathers.”
He glanced back over at Sam as Ellen lowered her gun and walked closer. “Ellen, what the heck’s going on here?” Dean asked her, surprised as well. She splashed him with holy water from a flask she drew from her jacket and raised her gun.
She rolled her black eyes. “Yeah, right.” She said dryly, then looking toward the direction in front of them, where a male figure stood. “Rufus, over here! We got three of them.” Jo said, gesturing for him to help her out.
She nodded as she headed back toward the living room and he couldn’t think of how to approach all of this without doubt or fear of changing the past. “I’ll use my middle name
tab on her iPhone and scrolled to her contact simply called “Messenger,” and clicked call on the person’s name.
“Dean, how can you not care about yourself?” He demanded furiously. “Did Cas tell you what’s going on, or are you just giving up?”
The younger Winchester rolled his eyes at the childish argument and had been about to speak up when Rebekah looked back at the two time-travelers. “I think I saw a rest stop ahead, guys.” She said, glancing at Sam, realize he was awake. “I need caffeine and someone to buy Ambien from.”
“Yeah, he takes after your Uncle John.” Dan answered bitterly with a scoff, then began to head toward the kitchen, and glanced at his granddaughter. “I’m dumping this blood in the sink, Emma. Don’t bring anymore here, or it’s getting dumped, too.”
The younger Winchester didn’t miss the smirk on the kid’s face when he told his namesake of his plan to close the bar whilst Sam and the other two time-travelers were lookouts. He would stand in the shadows of the dimmed bar, where the hunters would assume Sam would be and attack
Lucifer. Part of the older Winchester was somewhat skeptical that the time-travelers weren’t who they said they were, and both Cas’s confirmed that they were telling the truth. Oh, God, it pained to him to see how worn out and tired future Cas was, and he would be too if he learned that the Apocalypse plan was rebooted.
The older kid nodded. “It’s true; you ask my namesake here or Sammy’s namesake when we find him” He said, calmly and confidently. “Why else would we know about what happens in the future?”
How could somebody let strangers die without trouble and care too much about the lives of family to the point of risking their lives,
“I don’t go by that name anymore.” He supplied convincingly with the right disdain in his tone, emphasizing his name with discomfort. “My middle name is Henry.”
Both were feeling hopeless and that they wasted their money flying back to Germany, or not questioning their father’s order. Sam was usually the one who questioned his orders, even under serious circumstances, but he was understandably too much in shock to question it.
Sam didn’t have time to respond, except for an initial gasp upon looking at the kid when the door of the Quick-Mart chimed as two demons came in. He ducked down and pulled the kid down with him and found the mirror watching them, who seemed to be about to confront them with his hand about to reach for a visible gun in his jeans pocket.
The time-traveler looked at him in the eye. “I wouldn’t have done it if you hadn’t tried to harm my namesake, who doesn’t deserve to be treated like a monster!” He snapped angrily at the hunter, scowling. “It’s hunters like
She nodded as she headed back toward the living room and left him wondering about how without doubt or fear of changing the past. “I’ll use my middle name
Either way, Rebekah was with Samuel there and D was helping Sam save that other hunter in hopefully enough time. Dean was finishing up a vampire hunt in Pennsylvania, while he worried about Sam in Oklahoma. Okay, and the boy was starting to grow on him a little bit, too.
and we’re still calling Rebekah by her name; we need a last name. I’m not lying to our namesakes’ more than I have to.”
, was polite and calm, not to mention a somewhat of a believer who prayed every night since childhood.
My apologies for taking so long to fix this chapter up, and I should be getting to fixing the next one soon. Hope you guys find that the fixes done in this chapter to be acceptable and didn't take away any of the appeal of the original text. If there's still any inconsistencies or grammar errors, etc, please let me know.
“You are. Bobby told me where you were.” Present Cas said, glancing around the motel room, with only one bed. “No, I haven’t found him. That’s why I’m here. I need your help.”
The young man, despite being caught off guard, grabbed his other hand to block the punch, grabbed his elbow, and his leg back Tim’s knee, thus pulling the older man down. “You’re ruining my shirt!” He complained, fixing the black and gray stripped collar, “it’s
“That’s fine in theory and all, but we could really use all hands-on deck here.” Tim emphasized, then glancing more suspicion on Samuel. “Not like we can bring the kid with us, even
“Yes. And whatever we want, we get.” Raphael menacingly and the windows burst in when a lightning struck down. Rain and heavy wind blow in the abandoned building.
Her husband let out of an irritable groan. “Shit. We need to help him dispose of the bodies.” He recalled in annoyance under his breath as dealing with dead bodies were to be expected on the job. “Come on.” He said, going inside the back entrance and he heard their footsteps behind them.
I overshare too much, I know, and I should've considered putting the new link for the rebooted fic here:
says and let her go.” Samuel snapped angrily, ignoring the mockery in the older hunter’s voice when he spoke the younger hunter’s name.
Samuel nodded. “I’ll give you the oversimplified version. I killed Reggie and the hero Sam killed Tim when he was trying to strangle me to death.” He explained stoically, as somebody attempting to strangle him to death was nothing new or unexpected. “She’s okay, just probably needs institutionalized somewhere for a few weeks.”
” She spoke up in her lack of complete fluency in German, and he seemed to relax little with their help.
Meanwhile Dean and present Cas are searching for Raphael. The older Winchester pushes back his feelings for the angel and tries to just focus on the case, so finally, here’s some more Destiel and I included a Sam POV on it, too.
“Yeah. Uh. Sam’s my middle name.” Sam improvised at the last minute, glancing back at Samuel trying not to pay attention, though technically they were also using
“Only a select few can refer to me by it. I suppose I should include you in that now you witnessed what my fellow
Now, they all four of them, including Rebekah now, had to look over their shoulders in public and fend off murder attempts by fellow hunters twice, or maybe thrice as much, now. That’s why their father told them to go back to Germany, and brainstorm there. He was angry with them, but their safety was far more important than giving them his choice words.
Hopefully, that makes sense. I’ll have to break this one up into three parts, since writing the events of the episode is taking way longer than I thought it would. I don’t want to try to shove all of it in a single chapter, and make it seemed rushed.
If any of the other three disobeyed direct orders and asked questions when it was forbidden to do so, they would be punished. There were strict punishments, within reason, for every rule broken, and Samuel could break only a couple of those rules. There were always rules in place, even while Klaus was away, and even Samuel didn’t test his limits further than he already did. The four kids called him ‘Dad,’ but when it came down to orders, it was ‘yes, sir,’ or ‘no, sir.’
“We’ll...tell the officer that he witnessed an angel of the Lord,” present Cas explained his plan without the knowledge of humanity his future self-seemed to have, “and the officer will tell us where the angel is.”
Rufus stopped as nothing was happening, and Jo let go of his hand and picked up the water jug. The kid started to wake up and the younger Winchester noticed his eyes opening but barely moved at all as Rufus and Jo were right in front of them.
Whether the younger-looking boy was struggling with relapsing on demon blood, a common human addiction, or not, he probably didn’t want Sam to know about all the drugs he was buying a week or so ago, if that was the case. The younger Winchester wasn’t going to push him for details, Samuel would tell him whenever he was ready, if he needed to talk.
He decided to assist with helping anybody who never help with shotgun training, keeping an eye out on both from afar. All three of them were safe here, so he could leave them alone for a little bit.
This was intended to be one single chapter covering 5x2, but this alone has 27 pages after a few months off writing this (with off and on writers block), so I’m gonna break it into the last part. I’ll be fitting at least some of the original chapter five and the rest of that will finish up into the original chapter six.
“I’ll be fine, Sam, I know how to hunt.” Rebekah said worriedly in her Californian accent, twirling her curly brown locks out of nervousness. “We still have to decide on our aliases and what my cover is. I assume you’ll tell them the truth about being brothers.”
“Dean, your brother is Lucifer’s perfect vessel, and Lucifer’s not above using Samuel as a back-up. You
The younger Winchester figured that the boy didn’t even realize how pretentious he was acting. He was already having difficult time trying to get Samuel to relax after having to tell him to tone his ego down a few times, the boy became more skittish around him when they were alone.
“We’re us.” He said and she lowered her gun as a tall, male figure walked quickly past her and the boys, toward the younger hunters in the back with a relieved look on his face until he saw the injuries, especially Rebekah’s. “What happened to you guys? I told you it was a bad idea going alone!” He exclaimed with a worried look on his face. “How many demons did you kill?!”
His younger brother nodded with uncertainty on his face and began to head out when his namesake approached them of them. “Hey, guys, are you both okay?” He asked with clear concern for them both, even noticing a concerned glance from Lindsay.
Rebekah let a smile slip. “We met in law school three years ago. Stanford, to be exact. I got my pre-law degree at in the university’s pre-law program and Sam got his over at Wichita State before moving out to California.” She said fondly, taking the older Winchester aback. “He told me that he wanted to become a public defender to improve his namesake’s image and I wanted to become a prosecutor.”
Fear was radiating off Sam, if her dysfunctional love-hate twin senses were reliable, and Emma tended to disregard those occasional instances of being a placebo effect from something else on her mind. Her and Sam didn’t have a strong bond, unless their intense love-hate for each other counted as such, and neither did they think like the other often.
, had suspected him of neglecting and psychologically abusing his kids for years. Eventually CPS thought he was physically abusing them, too, as the years of hunting came without stop, even as scars became old and new ones appeared. Mostly, they moved from one motel to another, and it was the same for school. Klaus relied upon credit card fraud and hustling pool, poker, and darts in bars for money. Sometimes he didn’t give his kids enough money to survive on as he was frequently out, leaving Samuel or Emma in charge of their siblings.
Sam was ready for an attack anytime now, although the time-travelers informed him that it wouldn’t be until after he closed the bar. The other two were at the motel, who were waiting until after closing to assist in as look-outs, who reluctantly decided to heed future Cas’ warnings and not change more than they had to. The decision to let a hunter a die wasn’t difficult for Samuel to make and it was easy for him, given that he shown no empathy for the man who would die. D and Rebekah, though, were reasoned out of going for strategic reasons that were in their favor.
I have done a lot of research for this story and have been hesitant to post it, for I want to make sure I wrote my German main characters accurately. If I made any mistakes with either portrayal, please let me know and I will fix it. Any constructive criticism is welcome and please let me know what you guys think. I sincerely hope that the portrayals are accurate and are not offensive in any shape or form. If there are any grammar errors, please let me know and I can fix them.
It was surprisingly easy to forget that the boy and Rebekah were a married couple, given neither of them wore wedding bands, nor acted like one would expect a married couple world. They were more like siblings, so it made sense that they posed as siblings in public. Either way, they had to wait for future Cas to come back and inform them of what Dean would do. Reluctantly, the couple next door had to put off smoking their joints until they received word from Cas, and they met in Sam’s hotel room next to theirs.
Rebekah slapped Samuel in the back of the head in response with overwhelming concern and frustration all over her face before the younger Winchester could respond. “Seriously, Rebekah?! What have my siblings been teaching you?!” He yelled at her irritably, rubbing the back of his neck. “That actually hurt.” His voice started to sound more like a whine.
“Of course. Not even our cousin Kyle, or our godfather, Steven. It happened when I was in my first year at Stanford, after getting my pre-law degree in Wichita State. My brother there with you usually hunted locally in Petoskey, Michigan, and worked part time at one of dad’s friend’s auto shop there after finishing secondary school. Sometimes he’d hunt with Dad.”
“I mean it. I am sick of being a puppet to these sons of bitches.” He said determinedly. “I’m gonna hunt him down, Dean.”
His older brother looked up upon hearing somebody come to the door and checking the peephole. “Hey, Sam, it’s okay.” Rebekah assured her husband. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”
wanted it to be, with no regard for humanity. “So, what, God dies and makes you the boss and you decide you can do whatever you want?” He demanded.
This will be written in third person, focusing on the boys’ figuring out who these mysterious hunters are. Hope the quality of this one surpasses the lackluster quality of the original.
“Maybe somehow they get pulled back here and whatever they’ve done in the past is undone.” He theorized, after thinking for a couple of minutes. “Maybe Michael’s intervening, and he’s putting everything back into place.”
“What are you, a demon? Is that why you’re protecting him?” He asked viciously, one arm holding the young man against the wall and the other reaching to choke him, and Samuel realized that his namesake left his sight. “What’s this ‘namesake’ bullshit?”
The kid ran his hand through his hair tensely. “Because it wasn’t your fault. Why should you be blamed for what a demon tricked you into doing?” He answered with his blue eyes sympathizing toward Sam’s remorseful hazel eyes. “You were used as a puppet for the demons to get what they want, and yet you’re being blamed for something you never wanted a part in. It’s not right at all.”
Dean smiled faintly with a look of understanding. “Thank you, Sammy.” He said gratefully with relief, who said nothing in response, but shook his head. “I just want you to start taking better care of yourself and hopefully you and Rebekah can go back to your normal lives as soon as this nightmare is over.”
It was too good to be true that Samuel was being quiet, and the younger Winchester turned around, seeing the boy was falling asleep. No wonder he was being quiet. “Hey, dude, we’ve found a diner.” He said, and the kid slowly sat up, and shoved his floppy bangs out of his face.
“This is funny to you?” Raphael asked him, unpleasant and outrage in his demeanor toward Dean. “You’re living in a godless universe.”
“You’re serious about this.” He said as the present Cas turned around to face Dean, and dropped the washcloth, and walked toward the angel. “So, what, I’m Thelma and you’re Louise and we’re just going to hold hands and sail off this cliff together?”
“Look, listen to me, something’s not right!” He called over at them. “If you don’t want to let me go, at least let him go! Can’t you see why what you’re doing isn’t working?”
“We’re fine. It’s just a few flesh wounds.” Rebekah answered vaguely, glancing a concerned look at her taller, silent, and moping brother as they walked into the church, toward the stairs. She looked over at her older brother.
. It correlated with what War had hinted to them, seemed directly more toward Dean, to ask about the younger kid’s blood.
“My family has said for years that I blame myself for what nobody could’ve been able to control, like my birth mother being killed or my stepmother being kidnapped, but Azazel tried to take me and my twin both times. I…think I can relate to what you’re saying.” Samuel said considerately after a couple of minutes in silence on his end, his voice cracking hurt and anger. “You and I are just a couple of pawns in a sick game, and we’ve both been manipulated to take blame for what’s not our faults. Rebekah’s life was used as a gamble
“I’ve been going to a few different bars close to here and, uh,” Samuel answered somewhat anxiously, “hustled poker and pool, and some darts, too. I alternate between bars, and, um, I know that I said I’d be making an honest living while we’re here, but I need money.”
trust a demon. Not even her twin pushed the boundaries on that issue because in the history of their ancestors proved it repeatedly. The only Winchester daughter had been keeping this unholy alliance a secret for eight years now, and she’d known it would come out one way or another.
“Oh shit, we left our guns back in the States! Why does Germany have such strict gun laws? Doesn’t our government care about letting people protect themselves?” Danny complained with a groan, feeling naked without his pistol in his black and gray camouflage jeans pocket, and he was sure Emma felt the same way. “How are we supposed to do anything?”
“I have a solution I think you’ll like.” Sam said. “Similar to how we met in college as strangers initially, instead when I left for eight years, you came with me and enrolled as well.” The younger of the two brothers shook his head. “Sammy, you were out for eight years and you didn’t require as much refresher training.” He said. “What if we just say that Rebekah graduated from secondary school early and got accepted into a university, so she had more time away from hunting than you?”
“Well. Last night on earth.” Dean said, bringing in some levity in the moment. “What are your plans?”
He asked, feeling warm because his ego was fed well, and he was proud of his brother, who answered promptly, “
“Your opa and I know what the withdraws can do to you, and we don’t want you to let it get bad. If there’s anything you can do here to avoid them, let us know if we can help.” Angelika said with firmness, heavily with concern as her granddaughter picked up her bag. “We already know you’ll go out and get more blood.”
Right as she turned toward the parking lot, where a large and old neon sign stuck out. It had faded and peeling green and pink paint with flickering yellow lights all along the sign stating, “Betsy’s Diner,” and the diner was visibly on the right side. Within walking distance from it was the truck stop with the expected trucks parked on the left side beside a small Gas N Slip, and aside from truck drivers, it looked old and barren.
Danny figured that it would take his older sister a while to get her demon blood fix in and to get them something to snack on that evening. He’d been sitting on the sofa and nursing a beer that was beside him on the wooden sidewall table, flipping through the German channels that he’d forgotten about until now for something interesting.
Just when Sam thought he was free from Dean’s control over him, he was tricked into being controlled by a demon he trusted, who had a whole plan to gain his trust. Did Ruby truly care about him in the first place? Of course not! Did she really think him freeing Lucifer would give him freedom and paradise?
It wasn’t a surprise that other hunters were here, but it was a surprise that the European guy was as tall as Sam. The man, or maybe better described as a kid, had short black hair with floppy bangs shoved away from his face with the same glistering blue eyes that his, no,
