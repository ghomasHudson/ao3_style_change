“What the ... Whoa!” Dean looked up and unbelievingly gaped at the feathers around him that were shielding him completely from the outside world.
One of Cas’ hands was in Dean’s hair, the other stroked his back, wandering lower and lower. Closing his eyes, Dean, despite wanting nothing else, loosened his embrace and stepped back.
When they entered the building, they headed directly for the principal’s office where they introduced themselves once again as FBI agents investigating the cases of the unknown children’s appearances.
*****
All of it crashed into him and there was nowhere to run. He was trapped on a fucking island in ...  Geez, he had no idea where the hell they were exactly. Then again, it didn’t matter. He was trapped nonetheless.
“It’s true. All my life I have been my mother’s pawn. When your friend killed her I panicked and ... Shit! I just should have run.” Looking at the pleading eyes of the witch, Claire had to think of Puss in Boots from the
Castiel nodded hopefully, still pressing the silently snoring hunter close to his chest. He should carry Dean to his bed. The floor in the middle of the library wasn’t the best place to recover quickly.
Breaking their kiss, already one of many, Dean and Castiel looked at each other. With a tiny nod, Dean gave his approval to a question Castiel didn’t need to ask. Opening his wings, he revealed who he was shielding from the world before he decided to let them vanish from this plane.
“You were kissing Cas,” Sammy piped up, triumph in his voice. “I’ve seen it! It’s gross.
“You certainly are not so dumb to fire a gun inside a crowded diner and shoot an innocent patron in broad daylight. You look far too intelligent to take that route.” So the witch played docile with a hint of snark. Claire could work with that.
“I’m not aware of doing anything wrong. As you recall, you invited me to lie down on the bed before you fell asleep.”
“Cas, please,” Dean pleaded, coughing blood, “Lucifer. He– he is out there. Couldn’t stop him. Sam. You need to stop him. I– I won’t make it. I–” Another coughing fit stopped him. Raising his eyes for one last time towards his, full of emotions he couldn’t decipher, life went out of Dean Winchester.
“Yeah, Cas. I’m fine,” Dean insisted.
Without further thought, Dean blurted out, “Marry me!”
"Sammy? Son of a …" He stopped in his tracks. Even though Sammy was used to his fucking R-rated language and guilty as charged himself, for fuck’s sake, this was him back as a still completely innocent kid. And he would not spoil his little brother when he finally could have some peace. However fucked up this whole mess was.
my life. They belong to me. My life is bound to them. If they die, which they certainly will do at their age, I’ll die as well. Transforming them back into kids will prolong their lives and therefore mine. Only, Sophia grew too suspicious. She somehow managed to hold on to some of her memories even after I had transformed her.”
It had been a while since he had dressed himself. This would be the first time he wasn’t wearing his usual outfit since his trying time as a human. After that, there had never been another reason to change out of it, though technically he already had – this morning when he had undressed both of them.
Dean paced up and down the library aimlessly wanting to hit something, anything, and resisting the urge with all fibres of his being. Alcohol was out of question, too. Not when Sammy was ... He would not turn into Dad.
*****
“Dean! That’s Dean, Castiel, isn’t it? Can I talk to him? Please! Let me.” Sam tried to grab the phone from Castiel’s hand and wiggled in his arms to get it.
“Yeah,” Dean mumbled, yawning, “Just don’t spill to Sammy that I like to be the little spoon. I’ll never hear the end of that.”
“But Chuck. He brought them all back. He brought Lucifer and Lilith back. How?” Dean glared at Jack.
“You okay now?” Dean glanced over. “Son of a bitch! Are those goosebumps?” he cried out, grabbing Castiel’s arms and studying it, brushing his thumb over the tiny bumps on his skin.
“Yes, of course, they are an essential part of me. I’m a being of flight. It’s hard to have lost their main function.” Losing most of his powers and the function of his wings had hurt him badly. Castiel had read accounts of people who had lost limbs or the ability of motion. He didn’t know if his condition was comparable to theirs but he eventually had realised he had suffered from severe depression and anxiety in the after-effect. Not being able to use his wings was a constant reminder of his fall and his failures regarding Heaven. Yet, even though he had started to accept their loss nowadays, there was one instant he always wished they still were functional. “I usually miss them the most every time you’re in danger and I can’t arrive fast enough.”
Everyone was staring at him, their mouths hanging open.
“Sorry. Yeah, I’m with you.”
. There was no way Dean would give in. As much as his body tried to convince him time and again, Dean most certainly would not cross
Still nodding, Dean couldn’t believe this was happening. With quick hands Cas had opened Dean’s zipper and released some of the friction before skin touched skin and Dean took in a sharp breath. “Holy fuck, Cas! You told me you weren’t able to grasp sexual attraction.”
Though, at least, it seemed his brother had slept in his bed. Unlike the previous night when Sammy had been too afraid to sleep in his own bed, the blanket was also still there. Did Sully need to sleep? Jack didn’t, although he often spent the nights sleeping in his room nonetheless.
As soon as Gabriel had arrived, the entity had retreated to their slobbery form of black goo, but now they had snarled and attracted the archangel’s attention.
“I had worse.” Dean arduously turned towards Castiel with a hint of his usual reassuring grin.
Castiel threw a smug grin at his friend.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat. Damn, he was so gone for this moron.
“Okay. I’ll just leave you two to figure that out on your own.” And with that, Sam left them and started rushing towards the other end of the beach where Jack and Eileen were working, or rather where they were standing while Jack materialised a complete wedding venue out of thin air.
Sam was huddling against Dean’s leg and stared wide-eyed at his now unknown non-imaginary friend.
Sam stepped through the treeline. “What the hell are you two doing
It would be so easy to close the chasm between their hands, mere millimetres between them and yet so much more. Taking this leap would set everything at risk, not just Castiel’s existence but all their lives, and the existence of the entire universe.
Dean winced, barely noticeable. “You’re right, Sammy. Of course, you’re right.”
with baby-sitting duties.
“Damn you, Cas. You want me to say it?”
“Don’t you dare!” Tears were flooding down Dean’s face while the hunter tried to wriggle out of Castiel’s arms.
“Sleeping, I guess.” He turned to Eileen, signing.
“Cas,” Dean cried out, “Cas!”
“Thank you, Dean. You are most welcome,” Castiel deadpanned.
Dean leaned heavily against the door, cursing his aching body, yet unable to stop the sound escaping from his mouth, some weird thing between a groan and a chuckle, when his thoughts returned to a similar scene earlier that night. Hell, one day he wouldn’t have the mental strength to resist this angel any longer and doom their friendship for good.
“Awesome!” Dean eventually exclaimed, grinning, having used the time trying to find a new starting point for his thoughts. “So, ‘Don’t ever change!’ I meant it. I met you. You in the future. But not you. Fallen, stoned, orgy you. Future you was different. I liked past you better, real you. My version.
For a fraction of a moment, Missouri vanished and a pair of blue piercing eyes always capable of starring right through his shit replaced her. “Cas,” Dean mumbled half awake. Sighing, he turned around and slowly drifted back into his dream.
Technically, Dean knew Ellen was right. But it was one thing to know and a completely different thing to admit it to yourself when the ghosts of your past never stopped haunting you.
As soon as they had arrived back at the bunker, he had raided his stack of booze. There was nothing left he could do at the moment. There was no hope left. Who cared if he knocked himself out? Chuck didn’t want to take his or Sam’s life anymore after all. The bastard had won.
one. Thank fuck, that Jack hadn’t met Crowley. Otherwise he wouldn’t know how to explain that the novel was a book of fiction, at least in this universe.
“Why would you do that?” Castiel squinted.
“Fuck you!”
Dean sighed and immediately discerned the rustling sound of a well-known trench coat turning towards him. Still only on the edge of consciousness, Dean let sleep reclaim him, trying to escape his self-flagellating maelstrom, knowing deep down that this statement of Bobby’s was probably the most important sentence in his already dissipating dream.
Castiel looked up. “You could feel it?”
Castiel remembered he should say something, anything, but neither he nor Dean seemed inclined to break the moment.
“Come in and stop hiding. You’re lucky I’m in a good mood.” Dean could feel Cas caressing his hand calmingly. “What the hell were you thinking? Leaving the bunker? Jeez, we trusted you with the kids.”
“Witch-killing bullets certainly will.” The witch’s eyes grew wide at this revelation and she raised her hand to use some kind of telekinesis against them but Sam was faster and pulled the trigger. With a loud thud the principal’s body fell onto her desk where it crashed into pens and spilled over the ink pot. The blue fluid mixed with the light red blood dripping from the head wound and created fascinating patterns.
Trying to regain himself, Sam huffed. “Guys, seriously? That’s what I have to live with now?”
An ecstatic “Dean” escaped his lips, followed by a sound that was neither gasp nor moan, a shudder running through his whole body. In vain he tried to suppress a whimper, too shaken by the unfamiliar reactions of his body. He was shivering.
“Oh!” Jack’s surprised reaction sounded through the finally bright lightened library and startled them.
“You’re such a spoilsport.”
“Yes, most probably.” Castiel couldn’t deny what he knew was the truth. For a moment, the caress stopped.
Cas’ eyes were glistening, sparks of grace enhanced the blue. Tears were streaming down his face, and the smile on his face was the biggest Dean had ever seen. “Yes.”
Soon, the door was closed. But they still stood in the middle of the parking lot, between hundreds of cars. Everywhere were people, arriving or walking back to their cars.
“Yes.”
“Yeah. Will be. It helped, didn’t it?” Now she sounded like his brother.
“Are you still talking about the windmill?”
“Damn it, you’re adorable and beautiful. And I love you. But, please, don’t stop.”
Dean’s eyes opened, glancing at Castiel. Suddenly, Dean’s hands were on Castiel’s face. Thumbs brushed over his cheeks and Castiel did his best not to purr. This felt heavenly. Wordlessly, only through his eyes, Dean asked for permission, and, with a single nod, Castiel gave it.
“Any last words?” Claire repeated her earlier question for the third and last time.
Gabriel spread his arms, grinning broadly. “The kiddo’s explosion started up some life up here. Or so they say.”
“Sam is currently a four-year-old. He wouldn’t do that.”
Cas looked confused, even hurt. “Did I do something wrong?”
Why must it always be witches, anyway? Laughing about Sammy and telling Dean she could feel Sammy’s life force pulsing through her, she had been able to distract Dean long enough to haul him into whatever furniture he had crash landed in.
“Yeah, all of that,” Dean answered breathlessly when they parted. “Fuck, I love you.”
“An accident I could have prevented if I hadn’t used my powers. If I hadn’t tried to help.”
, the real deal. Dean knew all too well. These fucking sayings had been so much easier before Heaven and Hell, angels and demons, and God – for Chuck’s sake – had become a constant nuisance in their lives.
Dean had tried to let Cas’ parting words settle in, to embrace them. It had been hard, too hard, and far too hurtful. But he had managed some baby steps.
Dean couldn’t believe their luck. Looking at Cas, he found his angel was grinning mischievously. Placing Sammy down, Dean pulled his angel up, lost in his eyes, before he clasped their hands and dragged Cas towards his room. After all, they had some unfinished business.
“They all knew,” Cas sounded as amazed as he was. “Meg, Crowley, Balthasar, Metatron, Ishim – all of them. Almost every angel and demon we encountered through the years.”
“March 14th. 3.14. Pi,” Dean shrugged. “It’s something I saw on the internet. It’s stupid. But it reminded me of you. And me. You and me. Us. It reminded me of us,” he rambled on, lowering his eyes and scratching the back of his head nervously.
Yet the best thing was Cas. The smile on his face was bigger than Dean had thought possible, tears of happiness flowing down his face. Cas’ eyes were gleaming, enhanced by his grace that shimmered through. It was a constant reminder of his true form. There he was, an Angel of the Lord, standing right in front of him and marrying him, Dean Winchester, of his own free will.
“You shouldn’t use your powers when none of us are here.” With Cas educating Jack and him squabbling with Sammy, this whole situation was far too strange. Stranger than their normal life as sort of a weird little family which never was not strange.
“‘kay.” Reassured for now, his friend was blinking back at him. “You’re back. How?”
“You heard me?” Dean blurted out, looking over his shoulder at him, amazement showing on his face. Castiel nodded.
“Yeah. Look at me, pal. I’m no use. Standing out there was nearly more than I can manage right now.” And it was. Right after Baby came back to life Dean leaned back and dropped off immediately.
“Gabe?” Dean turned to where the voice was coming from.
“Looks like there’s still enough meat for the patties left and we’ll be able to save the crust. Easy as pie.”
Cas was dead. He was, wasn’t he? Dean had seen him taken by the Empty. Had he really come back to him? This still had to be a dream.
came with the job description.
“Cas ...” Dean tried to interrupt, stopping his best friend before he could make it worse.
Dean’s eyes turned wide. Suddenly, he grabbed Castiel’s hand and tugged him towards the Impala. “You. Me. Now.”
Everything was dark and an endless void had swallowed him the moment he had entered. Instantly, all his senses were numbed. Somewhere in the vastness he could hear weird sounds, voices and groans, whispers and crazy laughter. It reminded him of Hell and Purgatory, the eerie feeling resembling Heaven, and yet it was something completely different. Shivering, he turned and looked back at the narrow golden line behind him, their only way out of superhell. How long would the portal be stable? He didn’t know. First, he had to find Cas. He wouldn’t leave here without Cas anyway.
“Thanks, Donna. You’re the best. ... Yeah, stay safe.” Dean let the phone sink down on the table. “We’re running out of options. Donna has another nest of bloodsuckers in her neighbourhood. So she ain’t available right now either. Even if she’d been able to come over, it would’ve taken too much time. Time we don’t have.”
see me?” Sully gaped and nodded at Jack.
*****
“Frying bacon was quite simple but the meat of the patties stays either raw or ... “
Suddenly, the leviathans attacked. Two. No three. Four. Their numbers rose still, but already he had lost count. He was helpless, forced to witness the moment Dean was slaughtered by a pair of them. His eyes still resting on what was left of Dean, he didn’t even feel the teeth coming. Within a moment, everything went dark.
This was it. He grinned and stepped through the veil.
Dean tried to say, but his vocal chords didn’t work. As did everything else. He was frozen, although he could feel the rising heat on his face and finally, after what seemed to be eternity, he managed to look away, unable to accept the words that were completely undeserved. “Shuddup!” he mumbled again.
“Whatever!” Sam rolled his eyes and threw his hands up in resignation. “Just keep your hands by yourselves during the drive home. At least keep it PG. I need to keep my sanity. There’s only so much I can unsee until I need to bleach my eyes. And my brain.”
*****
Cas’ words had triggered something in him. Somewhere between the dungeon and Chuck’s defeat, his words had settled in, changed something deep inside him. Cas had changed him. Of course he had.
Sam shrugged. “Yeah, you’re probably right. They just drove me mad for years. Can’t believe that after all these years all it took was me as a preschooler.”
He knew he shouldn’t be angry. Not at Cas and not at Sammy, and certainly not at the whole fucking world. These shitty things happened. He would know. And they would find a way around. They always did. But he was angry.
“Wait,” Sam intervened, “does that mean you can taste?”
“Asshole!”
Rolling his eyes at him, Dean turned on his side, facing the other direction. “Fine, whatever. Give me ten.”
Dean stared at him, his face blank, but tiny movements betrayed his emotional state. Castiel had seen it happening before with his friend, though never like this.
“I’m here, Dean. Aren’t I?” Letting go of the embrace, yet keeping his hands firmly on Dean’s shoulders, he watched his friend’s face. Dean still was struggling with emotions, fighting tears he wouldn’t allow to fall. “Dean, I’ll never leave you. I’ll follow you wherever you go.” Finally, his friend calmed down.
His heart stopped and immediately raced towards some kind of panic he couldn’t stop. Only a few hours ago, if it even were hours, Dean had talked about taking it slow, just to be betrayed by his own dick. And now? Even though Cas had assured him of being interested despite his obvious asexuality or whatever this thing was called, Dean didn’t want to freak him out when they just got together. Time to play it safe. “Hey, sunshine.”
“Jack?” He rushed towards his surrogate son and embraced him tightly. After being taken to the Empty and listening to Dean’s prayers, he had started to believe he would never see Jack again.
Within a blink of an eye Dean was grinning at Castiel, yet it didn’t reach his eyes. If Castiel didn’t know his friend as well as he did, if Castiel hadn’t based his research of human emotion mostly on Dean, the human could have easily fooled him.
Castiel sat up, his wings spread wide behind him, still keeping up his momentum and pounding into their tightly enclosed hands, having no intention to stop. The tension was still building up inside him, and he could tell he wouldn’t last any longer.
“You gotta be kidding.”
Castiel loved the view on Dean’s face when his friend finally caught up with what he had said, his ears turning beet red. “Shuddup! That’s not what I meant and you know it ain’t.” Although the angle was odd, Dean gave Castiel a friendly shove in his side. On far more serious note Dean added soberly, “Do you really think it’ll work? That we actually have a lasting chance?”
Abandoning all thoughts of pursuit, Castiel focused on the little boy. “Sam? Are you okay?”
“Oh, I believe Dean would love to find that out on his own,” Claire deadpanned and Dean blushed in the reddest shades.
“So what?” Donna replied, chuckling. “It’s not your first time. I trust you. Even hugging me, you won’t accidentally stab me.”
Knowing Dean would never admit his need for rest, neither to himself nor to Castiel, it was up to him to resist the temptation just a few hours longer. He had spent years without hope this day would ever come, now he had to wait just a bit more.
Dean jumped out of their embrace at once, his face beet red. “We’re ...
They left the car and headed for the building. “Shall we go in together or would it be better to separate to have an element of surprise?” Castiel couldn’t decide which the best way was to keep Sam safe.
“Shut up! You’d like that,” Dean mumbled.
had asked him to look out for Sam once again. And Dean had left them. What if? Were they still in the bunker?
“All the information leads to the same school. St. Anna’s Home for Children and Nursery School.”
Arriving at the car, Castiel opened the back door and carefully laid Dean down on the seat. Dean’s face colour was almost back to normal and his vital signs reassured Castiel that his grace was still speeding up the hunter’s healing process.
"I– I don't know." Castiel's confusion only grew and he squinted. "That's why I'm asking you."
“When Sam and Sully let the kite fly, I sat down a bit further away and exercised with the pencil the way Sam taught me. But something went wrong and the pencil flew higher and higher until it was next to the kite. I tried to control it but I only made it worse and the string was cut.” The kid obviously knew he had messed up, again.
“We still don’t know if we’re right, so let’s have a look together. We’ll just ask a few questions. We don’t need to rush in and shoot first, ask later.”
Opening his eyes, he embraced the sleeping man in his arms tightly. He needed to show Dean he was loved, so he could finally believe life had offered him another shot of happiness. “I love you, Dean Winchester. You’ll never be gone too far for me to stop loving you.”
“Look who’s talking,” the younger Winchester fired back.
Only this time he didn’t wake. Instead of the expected darkness of the Empty, a bright nebular void was all around him. Something was wrong. Something was different. For the first time in all his nightmares, he was aware of his predicament. Even more so, there was neither a vessel nor his heavenly form. He was in an incorporeal state, nothing he had ever experienced before.
“What do you mean?” Castiel was still wondering about Dean’s earlier hesitation and therefore was too distracted to understand the meaning at once.
“Dean, the word you’re looking for is ‘come’,” Sam shouted after them. His damn brother was lucky that Dean had other things in mind right now.
Sure. That certainly wasn’t a word he would use to describe their lives. Nothing for them had ever been easy.
“Shut up!”
“So no one could save Cas but Dean?” Sam stirred the conversation back to their main topic, addressing Jack.
“Would you?” Cas just didn’t stop.
“You were alive? All that time?” Guilt clouded Dean’s eyes when he stared at Castiel. “What did it do to you?”
Castiel could tell that Dean still felt responsible for him depleting his power. He watched as Dean tried to get out of the car by himself, struggling with his aching body and his sleepy state, eventually sitting back defeated and waiting for Castiel to help him. His friend didn’t even protest when Castiel hauled him out of the car which proofed how bad Dean’s physical condition still was. Slowly, they made their way to the door, Dean leaning heavily into Castiel, and entered the bunker, leaving their bags in the trunk to unpack later.
Castiel returned to his kneeing position, trying to calm himself, before he squeezed some lube onto his hand. What if he failed? Dean was so experienced whereas he had barely anything to offer.
Looking up, he met Cas’ eyes. “This okay for you, angel?”
Meeting Dean’s gaze, he wasn’t the only one.
When Castiel finally arrived at the scene, he just caught a look of Sam hugging his brother’s legs before the older Winchester picked him up.
Dean stopped shovelling food in his mouth, looked at her. “Jodes lets me use her garage. She knows what’s best for Baby.”
Dean’s reactions caused Castiel’s blood to rush lower, especially when Dean bucked his hips in response to the teasing. Castiel took the hint and turned his attention to Dean’s suit pants. Yet, before he moved to open the button and zipper, he pressed one hand on Dean’s bulging crotch, earning him another sinful groan. Using the alulas of both wings, he kept up the teasing of Dean’s nipples simultaneously.
“So you don’t need to worry anymore? You’re worse than Jody and Cas.” Sam could picture her teenage petulance when it came to hunting. It didn’t take much, especially after he had grown up with Dean. “Yeah, okay. I’ll message you. Happy now?”
Taking his boyfriend’s reactions as encouragement, Castiel sped up his movements. He felt Dean’s heartbeat and pulse quickening, his gasps and panting becoming more agitated with every minute.
Pulling his hand back in an abrupt motion, Dean glared at Cas and then at his brother. “With all of you!”
” He pressed the heels of his hands onto his eyes. “I stopped, just stopped. I hesitated a moment too long and then she attacked Claire,” reminded of what had happened, Dean dropped his head in frustration and self-loathing. The witch had been right there in front of him and all he had to do was to pull the trigger. Now Dean was sitting in the back of the Impala, barely able to move, apparently in the middle of nowhere.
“It’s a novel. The authors made the story up. It’s completely fictional. None of it is true.” Dean paused. “Some things are true but the authors used the biblical stories as an inspiration. That’s why so many actual players from the Apocalypse are part of it. But the actual Apocalypse never happened that way. Trust me, I know.”
Castiel, carrying the pie and holding Dean’s hand in his, rolled his eyes and said, “They’re in my pocket … No, the other one.”
“Don’t speak,” Castiel soothed him, kneeling right in front of his friend. He didn’t know what to do.
Claire huffed. It always was the same old song. “Yada, yada, yada. It wasn’t me. I did nothing. I’m completely innocent,” she mocked.
Donna frowned at her. “
Cas also glared at Dean. “What Dean is so verbosely trying to convey is that we need you to stay here and look after Sammy and Jack while we try to hunt down the witch who did
With stopping the furthest thing from his mind, Castiel took up a slow speed and increased it with every move of his hips. Soon they both were panting heavily, their names the only coherent sounds shared between them. His mouth had left Dean’s and was wandering over his neck and torso, sucking possessive marks into his husband’s skin. He could always heal them easily afterwards if the need arose.
“Na. Let’s do this. I meant what I said, earlier. All of it. It’s just ...” Dean struggled with his words and Castiel did understand him.
“Awesome. Hell, the girl’s really great at what she’s doing but this witch messed with Sam and Cas. Sam
Carefully, Castiel approached the car and opened the passenger door. For a moment, he watched his sleeping friend, dreading the moment Dean would wake up. Dean was, after all, an angry sleeper. Despite his better knowledge, Castiel crouched down in the open door and touched Dean on his shoulder. “Dean,” he said, softly, “wake up.”
When Dean awoke everything felt right. At first, he didn’t know where he was but soon the memories flooded back.
After another extended kiss, Castiel’s sight fell on the box that was still lying near the shore where Sam had left it. “What’s that?”
There it was again. Step by step he wandered in the direction of the tugging. All feeling of time and space had vanished. Some kind of gravity helped him walk, but that was all there was. No hint how long he had been here or if he had made any distance at all. No feeling of space, only darkness. Emptiness. The same emptiness that had threatened to overtake his heart and his whole being these last months.
“Yeah, same.” Dean mumbled, a blush rising on his face. “Now, can you move?”
about Cas? I barely haven’t seen the guy since he returned. He’s like stardust, unable to grasp. Hell, I won’t chase a shooting star.”
“Hello, Claire.” Castiel still felt guilt rising inside him every time he encountered Jimmy Novak’s daughter. She had become such a strong woman and fine hunter, though he was always worrying about her well-being. After all, it was his fault that she had lost both her father and her mother. He had destroyed her childhood.
“You like them?” It was the first time he saw his wings for himself on this plane. They were shining black but their structure scattered the light, creating all humanly perceptible colours caused by the interference on the nanostructures of each feather. Depending on the viewing angle the whole visual spectrum was reflected off them. It was a truly incredible sight.
“So you still haven’t told him,” Donna stated. There was no need to even ask the question with the pigheaded idiot the older Winchester usually was when it came to his emotions.
Cas still glowered at him.
“You. Me. My room. Now,” was all he could manage.
“What happened?” Dean chuckled, yet no happiness reached his eyes. “You died.”
Dean stopped in his tracks. “Fuck you!” he cried out over his shoulder.
For a second, Castiel’s world turned upside down. His human heart skipped several beats and his grace flooded through his body, threatening to unleash a burst of power into this plane of existence. But the elation didn’t last long. Castiel could pinpoint the exact moment Dean realised the slip of his tongue. Dean’s eyes grew wide and all colour left his face, while his mouth opened and closed on its own, as if Dean was trying to find the right words.
“Yeah, dumbo! I have eyes. You two were the only ones too blinded by love not to notice anything. Besides, I once was Cas’ vessel. Remember? I was too young and he was too much an assholy angel to understand his feelings or feelings in general, but yeah. That stuck with me.” Dean gaped, completely speechless.
He didn’t need to find the answer. The answer crushed right into him. Cas had lingered right in front of him before he closed whatever space there still had been between their lips. Dean could feel the angel’s broad smile and knew his face showed the same happiness. This felt right. So fucking right that Dean barely managed to suppress a sob. He wanted this moment to last forever. Just the two of them, Cas in his arms where he belonged. For once, everything felt right. Holding each other, trading kisses, being in love with his best friend.
“No?” Hope rose inside him, once again, and a smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. “You liked it?”
“Yes, Dean. All of it.”
“Shit! Why didn’t you tell me?” With his thoughts occupied with a certain angel, Dean had completely lost track of time and their hunt.
Behind Dean’s back, Jody grimaced and shook her head. “
So Claire turned again, facing the booths, most of them occupied, and there the witch was, sitting with her back towards her. Holy crap, even the number on the tray was the same as the witch’s table. Hopefully Claire’s luck wouldn’t run out now.
“Yes, you will.” It wasn’t a question if it would happen only when. Castiel was fine with it however.
*****
And that was the truth. Hell, Cas was the only one apart from Sam he wanted to trust with all his being – body and soul. The moron had literally gone to hell and back for him. And for Sam. That’s why his stupid-ass decisions had stung so fucking much. Every. Fucking. Time.
Slowly, Castiel started to move his hand upwards. “We’re almost there, aren’t we, Dean?”
“I think I understand. These authors don’t want to tell facts. They use their imagination to tell stories which don’t need to be true.”
“What about Jack?”
“Careful, angel. Your kill-switch is on again.”
His brother immediately ran towards Cas, grabbing for the angel’s hand, and dragged him to the door.
“You’re afraid to be like your father.” It wasn’t a question. Cas stated it as a matter of fact, yet Dean couldn’t bear to look at him any longer and lowered his eyes to his knees. “Dean, look at me. You are nothing like your father. Not when it comes to taking care of others and especially not when it comes to taking care of your brother. Sam would be stupid if he believed anything other than that. And stupid is something your brother most certainly is not.” Cas gave him a moment to let that statement sink in. “Moreover, we need to go after the witch in order to return Sam to his actual self. You won’t help him when you stay here.”
Cas gave him one of his judging stares and continued with his explanation, “I decided to head back to the bunker. At least there we can have an eye on Sam and Jack.”
“Wait,” Castiel said nonetheless, stopping them in their tracks, “let me take care of this.” Turning around, he laid his hand in the fire, sending a burst of his grace through it. Immediately, spurts of flames erupted, and within seconds, the whole pile had been turned to nothing but cold ashes. “That should suffice.”
“However, it seems a lot more complicated than I had anticipated,” a slightly resigned Cas finished his recitation on a lower note.
“Dean Winchester, you are no such thing,” Castiel chided him. “
He must have misheard. That was the only logical explanation. Taking a deep breath, Castiel yanked the door open and blurted out, “What?”
“You’re hurting. Do you know your devastation woke me up? You broadcasted your feelings through the bunker. So don’t tell me you’re fine. We’ll find them, I promise.” Cas took a step towards him, barely keeping an acceptable personal space between them, even less than usually.
Castiel tilted his head and waited.
Her smile lingered a bit longer before his eyes when he woke. “I’ll do that. I’ll promise I’ll use my words,” Dean muttered in his waking state, knowing deep down exactly whom he finally needed to talk to.
“Sorry, Cas,” Dean grumbled. “Happy now?”
There was no way to hope for Rowena since her fiery run-in with Lucifer, so for now, at least one of them would be stuck in the bunker. Maybe one of them could go on the hunt while the other stayed back to babysit his brother and look out for Jack.
Dean kissed the top of his head, smiling. His hands were following the bones of his wings, caressing the feathers on their way. “Don’t. Don’t ever apologise for who you are.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. Castiel is right. My power doesn’t work in the Empty. I couldn’t help him. No one could. Except for you.”
Dean swallowed hard when he remembered Cas lying lifelessly in his arms, the shadows of his broken wings burned onto the ground. He had lost him far too often and the feathered asshole had always come back to him. Even when he had thrown a human Cas, in desperate need of friends and a home, out of the bunker, they eventually had reconciled. For whatever reasons, Cas had forgiven him. He needed the angel, more than he would ever openly admit to himself, and when he had been sure that this was the time he had lost his best friend forever, he had forgotten how to breathe. After he had burned Cas’ earthly body and had dedicated a day to find the most perfect spot to lay his ashes to rest, his life had been fucking worthless. There had been an angel shaped hole in his heart which would have never healed, hadn’t he been so fucking lucky and got him back. Once again, Cas had returned and a treasonous spark of hope tried to convince him that together they would find a way to breach the other universe and rescue Mom as soon as they had solved this tiny giant problem right in front of them.
Castiel’s fingers gently brushed through Dean’s hair before he lifted him in his arms and carried him towards the Impala, wishing their physical closeness originated from happier circumstances. It was a strange caricature of the day before when he had left the scene with the other Winchester in his arms. How could this hunt have gone so wrong for the second time? Tonight hey had outnumbered the witch three to one and still she had not only managed to escape again, but to take out Dean.
Persuaded, Cas took Sammy, lifted him over and sat him down onto Dean’s shoulders, before Cas planted another kiss on Dean’s lips. Dean still couldn’t believe what had happened, what was still happening. It all seemed so surreal, even though the hand that firmly grasped Dean’s and the thumb that brushed the back of his hand were physical reminders that this was real. This was actually real!
“Get used to it, Sammy,” Dean hollered.
“Yeah, you’re a witch that messed with my friends and a bunch of other people. As far as I know at least one person is dead because of your shenanigans, and last night Dean only survived because he had his personal guardian angel shadowing him.”
Finally, Castiel understood. “You fear if I go on the hunt I won’t come back? That I might die again?”
“How come?
He could feel the Shadow’s grasp tightening slowly. Soon, there wouldn’t be anything left. Was this what drowning felt like? Although his heart was still light from finally admitting freely what he had needed to say for years, what he had felt for years, the dread started to set in. Both the entity’s clasp and the realisation that the utter shock on Dean’s face when his best friend had ascertained what he was doing was the last thing he would ever see of him were quite sobering.
“That’s too fucking a long story.”
“Dean, hear me out. Without it, we wouldn’t be us. Look at what we’ve been through.”
“I’ll hurt you.” Dean’s voice became more desperate while his hand searched for Castiel’s. Once he found it, Dean intertwined their fingers, his thumb caressing Castiel’s knuckles. Castiel knew Dean needed the touch to ground himself as much as Castiel needed to touch Dean to convince them both that this was real.
“Thanks, Jack,” Sam said when he reached for the phone and turned it to speaker. “Hi Claire!”
Eventually, Cas spoke, “Claire is tracking the witch. She’s heading east. As soon as there’s any news Claire promised to call. Since you are hurt ...” Dean turned to Cas and glared at him. “Since you are hurt,” Cas repeated as if Dean hadn’t heart him the first time, “and in no condition to hunt ...”
When they arrived at Dean’s room, the human stopped, his hand on the doorknob. “Thanks, Cas. I think I’ll manage from here.”
“You don’t believe me.” The witch actually sounded disappointed. “Of course, you don’t believe me. You’re a hunter and I’m a witch.”
Just for a little moment, Dean closed his eyes but given his exhausted emotional state he drifted off.
Today's chapter is up a little bit earlier than usual, but with GISH going on, I wanted to get this part of my Monday done so I can concentrate on the next items.
Once again, Castiel was sadly left behind and didn’t know what to make out of his friend’s odd behaviour. After all these years, Dean still was an enigma when it came to his emotions, although he wore his feelings on his sleeve. One moment he might send unambiguous signs of wanting more in their relationship, only to take a 180-degrees-turn in the next. But who was Castiel to judge? His people skills might have evolved over the years but human behaviour still puzzled him immensely. Humans never stopped to amaze and startle him. And Sam often had reassured him that his brother was one of the hardest to read. Dean had a lifetime experience of shutting down his emotions, hiding them even for himself, most of the time deflecting with anger or humour, never showing what he really was thinking. Dean was always highly emotional and at the same time hiding so much from the world, and himself.
“Do we have information where those kids went to preschool?”
He didn’t know what he had expected. When they landed back in the library, his hand still in Cas’, his knees became jelly and he went down. Somewhere on another plane of his consciousness he registered the thunderous cheers, but the strain and grief of the last months caught up with him in an instant. Dean could feel Cas going down with him, knowing that he had had it probably even worse than him ever since the Empty had taken him. With his last remaining strength, Dean grasped Cas’ hand even tighter, holding onto him, never again willing to let him go.
His research had uncovered that there had been several strange disappearances and deaths in Garden City and the surrounding countryside over the last couple of weeks. Elderly folks had vanished without a trace, and at the same time small kids had been found all over the area. Kids and toddlers nobody seemed to miss appeared near the places the senior citizens had been seen last. The children not only weren’t missed, but there wasn’t anyone who seemed to know who they were. Only two days ago the body of one of the lost seniors had been found on a playground, clutching a teddy bear, a dagger stuck in her heart.
Dean shrugged. “The authors made it up.”
“Bye, Claire. Stay safe.” Even though he had no right to it, Castiel still wanted to apologise for everything he did to her and keep her safe. It was the least he could do.
, that was one fucking way to react!
Sam laughed. “Yes, he is.” It was difficult to talk when remembering what had happened was enough to send Sam into laughter. Closing his eyes, he tried to steady his breath. “More than before. You picked an unfortunate moment to kill the witch. Let’s say I jumped with full speed into his arms when you turned me back.”
********************
Suddenly, a hand was on Castiel’s face, tenderly brushing his tears away. He didn’ know what was happening. When he looked up, Dean was staring at him, smiling. Dean was radiating.
and the next two short paragraphs. Skipping the part should not harm your understanding of the scene.
Ignoring the moose, he tugged at Cas’ hand who immediately was closing in on him. Placing a chaste kiss on his boyfriend’s cheek – damn, this term nearly gave him a heart attack – earned him another sigh from his brother. It was so worth it.
*****
“I thought you’d never leave the bunker ever again. It’s been a long time. How’s Cas? I heard you finally found a way to get him back.”
“Dean? Are you okay?” Leave it to the asshole to notice everything.
Jack looked helplessly at each of them, confusion on his face. Could it be that the kid actually didn’t know what he had asked? After all, this was Jack, an innocent toddler in the body of a teenager who had the knowledge of an adult and the power to take over the universe without lifting his pinkie. The kid was able to kill anyone without as much as blinking an eye. But most of all, Jack took everything literally, hell, even worse than Cas when they met.
Castiel was amazed how much Dean, despite his declaration, rejoiced in this rare display of intimacy with his found family, especially since he had included Jack. Castiel was startled of his musing by a deep kiss, followed by yet another “Ick!” from Sammy who covered his eyes.
How could he have been so stupid and overlooked the fucking obvious? From the moment on Cas had returned with Sammy, all of Dean’s thoughts had circled around the fact that he had to keep the kid safe. Dean had fallen back to his childhood habits without realising that the spell only could be broken when the witch was hunted down and killed properly. For a while, he had seen Sammy only as the little boy he currently was and not as the full grown man who had defied Lucifer, stopped the impending Apocalypse single-handedly and had become the finest and smartest hunter Dean had ever encountered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas stopped and Dean could see he was struggling how to introduce himself nowadays. “Cas is our personal badass angel warrior, slash best friend, slash brother.” He grinned at his friend who now somehow looked a bit ... sad?
Dean handed the card to Cas. “How did she know?”
He felt the heat rising on his face.
? That’s adorable.” A broad smile covered Dean’s face.
“I honoured our deal. I did everything you asked for. I’m here. You won. Leave me be,” he begged.
Cas encouraged him to let go of their tight embrace. When Dean was finally facing his friend, Cas cupped his face and stared into his eyes. At once, Dean was lost in them. They had always been windows to another world, entryways to a vastness, the most obvious hint that Cas wasn’t human. They mirrored the angel’s true form and his grace, simultaneously intimidating, mesmerising, and safe. Now, Dean recognised something else. It had always been there but never before had he understood its meaning.
“Did it work?” a well-known voice asked from behind.
Dean swallowed. “What do you want?” he managed to say through the sudden lump in his throat.
“Kind of. One day you’ll remember again.” Hopefully, Sam would. They still hadn’t heard from Claire, but then again Dean hadn’t checked his phone for hours. Too many things had happened since then. “Hey, Cas. Any news from Claire?”
*****
Dean was the first one who cleared his throat and broke their gaze. He pointed with his thump back over his shoulder. “I ...”
“No, Dean.” He laughed. Tears were streaming down his face. Tears of joy. He was happy. “It’s real. We are real. We’re alive.”
“Always.”
“Aww!” Sam crooned. His head resting on his hands, his brother threw them heart eyes.
“You like it?” His friend sounded unsure and scratched his neck. It was a gesture Castiel knew all too well. Over the years, he had learned how to interpret it. But he still couldn’t fathom as to
Dean relief was palpable, even through the receiver. “Son of a bitch! What happened?”
“That’s what Cas said. ... Uh, yeah. You might have a point there. ... ‘kay, but I don’t have to like it. And I still don’t agree with you. ... Whatever! Thanks, Jodes.
And then there was Cas. The best damn thing that ever happened to him. How could he have lucked out this much? The one being with a mind of its own in the whole universe had raised him from Perdition and had fallen for him, in every possible way. Cas knew him inside out, had seen him in his darkest hours, had been with him literally through Heaven and Hell, through Purgatory, and he still loved him.
Castiel rolled his eyes and let himself fall back on the couch, propping up his feet. Dean could wait. After all, his best friend deserved it, raking up this old story once again.
Dean didn’t need to say it but Castiel heard it anyway. Why had he never realised? It had always been there. Right in front of him.
“You’re sure?”
They arrived near the school only a few minutes later. Castiel took the gun and the witch-killing bullets Sam handed him when they prepared to enter the school. They would have to be very careful because of the children staying at the place.
“Looks like we found its favourite plaything. Now it’s clear why it never bothered with us.” Gabriel looked at Dean and back at Cas. “Oh! That’s it.” His eyes lit up. “You’re here for your boyfriend. And here I was, thinking Heaven was just too boring for a Winchester.”
“You okay?” Sam worried about the girl.
“Huh?”
“I’m ... Sam sent me.” Castiel frowned and stared at Dean, who stood next to the weird contraption in the middle of the garage. Finally, having a look at the device, Castiel had no idea what it was. "What are you building?"
He knew Sam was safe and happy with Eileen. The moment she had knocked at the bunker’s door and Sam had opened it for her, had hurt so much even more after the bad joke Lucifer had played on him. Though missing Cas couldn’t stop him from being happy for them. Hell, Sammy deserved it.
“It’s okay, Dean. It’s okay. I’m here. This is real. We’re real.” A hand caressed his hair.
“Yeah,” Dean said. This time, his voice grew steadier. “Have for a long time.”
“Thank you, Sam. I’ll take him to his room. His bed will be more comfortable than the couch.” And it offered more space for two.
“Yeah.” Dean gulped and his eyes grew wide. “Hell, I’m gonna marry my best friend, a fucking Angel of the Lord.” He stopped. “Fuck! I just came out to my whole family.”
“You two might stop by the bathroom. You okay with that?”
He wasn’t sure if it was meant just for him or if Dean needed the reassurance himself.
Sully’s grin spread over his whole face. “He’s tiny! What happened to him?”
“Yep. Jack’s special,” Dean confirmed. “That’s why we need someone special to keep these two company when Cas and I are gone.”
Claire kills the witch. If you prefer not to read about any specifics, finish the chapter at "and
Dean huffed. “How could I forget?”
“I love you, Dean.”
Dean held on as if his life depended on it and followed his lead willingly. When Dean was inside, Castiel gave the door a push and it clunked shut. Aside from the clock on the wall and his beating heart, the room was suddenly very silent, the outside world once again far away. It was only them now.
Dean’s sight fell on Cas who was staring at a bag of his own. “I don’t eat.”
“It’s an accurate report about a witch’s prophecies from the 17th century. She told about the Apocalypse and a boy who seems to be my brother. Or not, actually, because there were two kids and they were swapped at birth. A demon and an angel are mixed up in all of this. They have been staying on Earth since they met in Paradise and now try to prevent the impending Apocalypse.”
“Okay,” Dean said, nodding, stealing a kiss from Castiel. “I’ll be waiting for you,” Dean whispered into his ear.
“Yeah, alright.” Dean rolled his eyes at his boyfriend.
Castiel didn’t know what to do or how to act. This wasn’t happening. This couldn’t be happening. He must have misinterpreted the whole situation. Dean couldn’t ...
“The vendor didn’t promise too much with the shop’s name,” Castiel said, his hands constantly touching Dean now that he was allowed after years of yearning.
“You could kiss him some more.”
Dean looked around. There were bodies of several vampires scattered on the floor. When his eyes fell on his sleeping brother, he caught a breath.
– apologise for your wings. You hear me, Cas? They’re beautiful. You’re beautiful.”
“They are a reminder of a time long lost,” Castiel went on, looking sternly at his partner.
I hope you enjoy.
Though, instead of attacking directly as he usually would do, his eyes were falling back to the body of the righteous man. Dean Winchester was dead and this time he couldn’t save him. Too late he saw the counter-attack coming. Alastair had grabbed onto his wrist and twisted it, forcing Castiel’s own blade against him, towards his own body. Using his full weight, Alastair crashed into him, burying the blade deep into the abdomen of Castiel’s vessel.
“Cas, where are you? Damn it, you asshole, I need you. Fuck, you can’t just throw those things at me, just to leave like the most dramatic bastard you are.”
Being the coward he had always been, however, he would chose nothing any day, just to keep their friendship alive. And how often had he even failed at that? There was no place in this universe, probably any universe, where they stood a chance. After all, he was Dean fucking Winchester, the personification of screwing up anything he touched with a speciality in relationships. Cas was too good for him, and the guy had already lost more because of him in the last ten years than in the billions of years before that. Dean just wasn’t made for relationships, but it didn’t mean he did not secretly dream of them – or rather one in particular. The one he wished for and could never have.
“Shh. It’s okay,” Castiel soothed him. Embracing the man he loved, he dove in for another kiss.
I decided to give you an extra chapter this week. That means I'll post the last chapter next Monday. As someone who prefers to read complete stories, I think it's time to get there.
In the corner of the room, in an old but comfy looking chair Patience had settled down, buried in a book and seemingly oblivious of what was happening around her, though Donna knew better. Patience’s powers had grown over the last months and she probably was the one person in the room who knew exactly what was going on. Or what might happen next. Donna shrugged. It was probably both.
“Sorry, kid. You did well, Jack, really. Keeping your distance and practicing on tiny things. That’s the right way. It’s still a hard way. But I’m sure you’ll make it. It’s baby steps, but one day you will know how to control your powers completely. And you can always build a new kite.” Cas’ approving tap on Dean’s hand lifted his heart a bit.
“How shall I know whether I’m sexually attracted to someone if I don’t think I know how it feels to be sexually attracted to anyone? I can study the theoretical meaning of sexual attraction, though it doesn’t mean I’m able to grasp it.”
“I got better,” Dean deflected in his typical manner.
“Monkey suits? Really?” Dean complained without having looked at the items in question.
“Whatcha reading?”
“Soon– ish?” Castiel grimaced, understanding too well what Dean was aiming at.
“I’m so sorry, Dean.” Only Cas would actually consider it necessary to apologise for dying.
“I’m sorry because I hadn’t realised how much I had hurt you,” Cas explained.
When they parted, far too soon for Dean’s liking, Cas returned to their conversation with Jack, trying to figure out what had happened. “So why did you leave so early in the morning to fly a kite?”
“Fuck, Cas. Really?” Dean wanted to deflect him, use his usual sarcasm, but all that came out was a far too timid reply. He sounded like an annoyed but intimidated teenager who tried to throw their weight about.
“Hello! I’m Jack!” The boy raised his hand in a greeting, yet barely waving, and smiled at Sully.
Both of them looked up. Cas grinned at Jody, winked ,and gripped Dean even tighter. There was the whooshing sound again and then they were gone.
“Dean, we’re home.”
“Cas?”
Cas squinted at him. If Dean were here, his brother would stare at the angel for an eternity and gather exactly what Cas wanted to tell him. Hell, Sam still didn’t know what novels those two told each other when they did that, living in their own world during those moments. If only it were novels they somehow transmitted through their ‘profound bond’, just by starring at each other. Sam shook his head, not wanting to follow
“Hey, that’s mine!” an overworked, yet cute waitress protested.
“Do I look as if I don’t know what I’m doing, old man? Hell, I thought I learned from the best. But I must have been mistaken.” She shook her head.
“I know you want to. I don’t mind. No, that sounds wrong. Arg!” He sighed, gripping Cas’ arms with his. “Cas. Angel. Your mojo? It’s who you are. Getting it back doesn’t change who you have become. It doesn’t take your humanity away. You ain’t ever gonna be that assholy motherfucker that walked into a barn in Pontiac, Illinois ages ago. Who was hot as hell, by the way.” Dean stopped for a moment, lost in memories of the badass angel warrior who would take none of his shit.
Sleep? Did that mean he would get the chance to see Cas waking up in his arms in the morning? Awesome!
Cas shot him one of his rare, bright smiles that immediately caused Dean’s heart to flutter.
“Peachy, angel. ‘s fine. Jus’ a lil’ bit tired.”
“It is?” How should he have known? It wasn’t that he had been in his right mind when he stormed into the library. “Whatever, brinner anyone?”
Sam finally gave him some desperately needed space which Dean happily used to stretch and to sit on the edge of his bed, rubbing his eyes and trying to fully wake up, though, he wouldn’t be until he had his first cup of coffee. Hopefully, there were still some Lucky Charms somewhere around the kitchen for Sammy, just to be sure.
That sounded more than reasonable.
“Who are Ernie and Bert?” Tilting his head, Castiel stared at Dean, confused.
“Doofus,” Sam chided him. “It’s a stick man built out of a pencil.”
“Really, Cas? Ain’t it obvious, Mr. ‘I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition’?” Dean was agitated.
Once again, they started slowly, but, soon, things got heated. Hands were everywhere, pulling at clothes, searching for the tiniest patches of skin. Dean’s mouth trailed over Castiel’s face, beneath his ear and down his neck. Dean kissed, nibbled, and sucked his skin, and Castiel gladly reciprocated.
“I love you, Dean.”
The dinner and party went on until late in the night but at some point in the early morning, Cas took his hand and led him away from the others. They walked along the beach and settled down on a patch of moss and grass on the other side of the small island. It was still dark, and the stars above them were shining brightly. Dean was sitting next to Cas, his head resting on the angel’s shoulder.
was definitely a topic for Sammy.
“That’s not what I meant.” Dean was still grumpy but Castiel could perceive the nervousness hidden underneath.
“And right on time, man. Right on time.” Sam gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder. “How?”
“What? Right now?”
“What’s there to tell?” Dean sounded resigned. “He’s mostly in Heaven, helping Jack get a hang of things up there. With his full powers restored, there’s nothing down here that keeps him down here.
Dean stuffed bacon and eggs in his mouth, only to speak with his full mouth. “First thing today, I’ll try to get a hold of our favourite sheriff in Sioux Falls.”
He was too close to the Winchesters, especially too close to Dean. Other members of the garrison had already noticed. They told him he experienced emotions. Looking at Dean, he knew they were right. Something had changed. And now he was the one who sent Dean back to Hell, back to a place where he was to face his torturer and mentor. He feared for Dean.
The flush that spread over Dean’s face, neck, and shoulders, was an incredible sight. Sheepishly, Dean bent down and picked up his suit bag that had fallen to the ground, fiddling with the zipper. Opening the bag, he suddenly looked back up, a grin splitting his face. “Hell, yes!”
“Thank you. I think I understand now.” He smiled at them and headed back to Earth, searching for Castiel and Dean.
They were standing in the middle of the room. Both of them stared at the other, but none of them seemed to be able to move, or talk.
“Good to have you back,” Sam said smiling, turning towards Eileen.
“Dean!” Sam sprinted towards his brother, crushing him with a hug. “I thought I’d lost you.” Tears were streaming down his face.
“I didn’t do shit. I wanted to. Hell, I tried everything. But there is nothing. Not one written source that even knows the Empty is a thing. It’s like it never existed. Rowena couldn’t help either.” Desperation was woven into Dean’s words. But the words he didn’t say were the ones that weighed the most on Castiel. Dean had tried to save him. He hadn’t given up on him.
Reluctantly, Dean got up. Scratching his neck, he evaded looking at Cas for as long as it was possible. When Dean’s eyes finally shot up, both men were staring at each other. The whole table fell silent. Donna knew instinctively that this was it. She was witnessing something enormous and probably world shattering.
Sam tried to suppress his grin. Cas never failed to deliver information in the most complex way. He complemented Dean perfectly. “Cas, that’s brilliant! Finally, we have a decent lead. Do you think all this is connected to a preschool?”
Laying his hand on Dean’s shoulder, Castiel slowly turned Dean back, so his friend had to face him once again. Despite his reluctance, Dean didn’t fight back. It was a start.
“Yeah?” Sam shrugged, sheepishly. “Who wouldn’t? First you are gone and back with Cas in an instant and then the portal vanishes and you two collapse right in front of us. We wanted to bring you to the infirmary but neither of you would let go of the other. So we decided to bring you here instead.”
“Oh, come on, Cas. Don’t be a–“, Dean’s voice stopped when he pushed himself upwards on his elbows, allowing himself to look once again at Castiel. “Jesus Christ!”
“Need any help?” The thought of Claire hunting on her own still left Sam uneasy.
“Cas?” Sam asked, astonished, having turned towards the commotion. “How?”
*****
Castiel widened his eyes and stared at him, slowly shaking his head.
Castiel crouched down next to Dean and embraced him in his arms. “Shh! It’s okay, Dean. You already know, I love you, too.” Even though the man in his arms momentarily tensed he eventually chuckled and eased up when Castiel placed a kiss on top of his head.
with your brother and a ... a ... The boy is nephilim!”
“It ain’t done yet. The pedestals are still missing. It’s supposed to be a tripod. With that height, I have to make sure it’s standing safe and not tumbling over with the first breeze. Even then, I’ll need concrete to anchor it to the ground.” Dean evaded looking directly at Castiel. At least that was Castiel’s impression. Kicking a loose screw across the garage, Dean mumbled, “Besides, it’s supposed to be a gift … you know ... for you.”
“Oh! Do I make you uncomfortable?” The witch smirked.
It had been a few days since they had been back to the bunker, when the arrival of a guest lightened their moods, especially Sam’s. Although he spend most of his time either knocked out in his room, trying to numb his racing thoughts and drown his feelings, or in the library researching everything he could find about the Empty – so far, nothing –, he had realised that his brother was grieving, too.
As soon as he saw what was inside, he knew he had to thank Sam and Jack for their choice of wardrobe. It might not be typical wedding attire, especially not for the beach, but this wasn’t a typical wedding. This was exactly what Dean needed. It would certainly help him to calm his nerves. And it carried some of his best memories of them. “I’m your huckleberry,” he mumbled.
“Wait, what?” He finally noticed the chairs next to his bed. “You’ve been here the whole time?”
Charlie squeed and the others awed at hearing that. Jack longed to see that picture. Maybe, he could go back in time to witness that special moment for himself.
Dean lost all ability of clear thought when his mind went blank and his body reacted accordingly. His blood rushed downwards, his heart and breathing accelerated, and his knees threatened to become jelly.
At first Castiel felt intruding, trespassing on unknown turf and breaking an old promise, until he discerned a faint echo of Dean which was whispering, “It’s okay.” Still not trusting where he stepped, Castiel perceived Dean nudging him in reality, assuring him with the same words, “It’s okay, angel.”
“It seems your brother has a panic attack,” Cas’ clear voice pierced through the fog. How could his brain be so cruel? Desperately, Dean pressed his hands over his ears to make it stop, shielding himself from the outside world.
Their eyes met. After all these years, he was still mesmerized every time it happened. Seconds passed with neither of them breaking their connection. Taking a deep breath in anticipation of what he now knew would be happening once Dean closed the distance, he finally nodded.
Dean rolled his eyes and shook his head after his brother. “Idiot.”
Dean was fixated on the flames. Castiel was standing next to him, his arm resting on Dean’s lower back while his left wing embraced his friend who was unaware of it as so many times before.
*****
“Sure thing, Hasselhoff, dream on,” Claire mocked him.
Unable to word his feelings, he did what he knew best. Burying his hands in the dark feathers which immediately resulted in sparks flying through his body, he placed kisses on Cas’ eyes, his nose, and all over his face. Reaching Cas’ mouth, Dean teased his bottom lip with his tongue and his teeth before he kissed him properly. When Cas opened up unexpectedly, inviting his tongue to explore further, the angel ground into him.
*****
“I am. And thanks for finishing the hunt and bringing me back.”
“I’m here, Cas.” Waving his little hand in front of Cas’ nose, Sammy made it clear that he was trying to get the angel’s attention. “What’s a soul?”
“You need to set a good example for your brother.”
“I only like them when they are yours,” he had stated.
“If you let me.” Dean wiggled his eyebrows seductively.
*****
“What the fuck? What are you doing?”
*****
“Yeah, sorry. Still not finished, though. You need to hear this. Should have told you eons ago. Capiche?
“It’s okay, love. I’m here. It’s okay.” A hand was caressing his back and he rested his head on Cas’ shoulder.
“Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you?” Dean shouted furiously, raising his hands in frustration and anger.
“Why? What happened?” he inquired.
Returning to the barn had only proven that. Finding Dean in a state of utter despair when he had come back had been a shock. Over the years he had seen him in far worse situations, not speaking of Hell, but until now he had always been strong. He had always known Dean was vulnerable under his hard shell but this was something else. This had been different. His friend had been stuck in some horrible memory, reliving the trauma right in front of him.
Sam nodded excitedly.
“It flew away.” Jack suddenly looked crestfallen.
“I was under the assumption that I had informed you of my impending arrival only five minutes ago.”
“I already had that.” His heart threatened to break seeing the pain in Cas’ features.
His friend suddenly got earnest. “You’re serious? Cas, you two have orbited each other for more than a decade. You’ve never seen Dean when we lost you. It shouldn’t be me who’s telling you, but you deserve to know. And my pigheaded brother is so emotionally constipated that he’ll probably never think it important for you to know. Every time it happened Dean was a mess, barely coping, drowning himself in alcohol and throwing himself recklessly into hunts. And over the years it just became worse. Last time he straight up accused me of not caring. In his own weird way of not talking about feelings, he let me know how much he was hurting. He loves you. We all have to carry the demons of our past, Dean more literally than others, but you two are a match made in Heaven – or technically, in Hell.”
The word created a weird feeling in Jack’s stomach. Like a longing for something he had craved for a long time, even though he had a loving home. Yet, for some reason, he got the intention. Still, he wanted to ask the others. This was fascinating.
idiots.”
As soon as they had walked down the aisle hand in hand before the ceremony even started, their friends had cheered them. Donna was the loudest but the others did their best to overtrump her. He had spotted Garth and Beth with their kids. Donna and Jody and the girls were sitting in the front row next to Eileen. Bobby had come with the other survivors of Apocalypse World as had Charlie and Stevie.
“It seems that I’ve missed a lot, even though I can remember most of it, if only in a very,
Castiel grimaced at Dean’s self-deprecation. Even though he wanted to tell he how smart, intelligent, and resourceful his friend was, now was not the time to lecture Dean. Dean was so much more than he admitted to others and far more than he let himself believe. Yet, if Dean wanted to be insolent, so could Castiel. “Fine, if you insist. At least, let me hear what Sammy figured out in case I interpreted it wrong.”
“Being nephilim and growing up with you, I realised angels missed out on several things. Whereas I always could choose to eat or to sleep, Castiel never had that sort of choice. He told me he sometimes missed it from his time as a human.”
“What?” Dean didn’t understand what was going on.

. So we can transform Sam back into his normal self.”
But, far too soon for Castiel’s liking, Dean turned off the welding torch he was wielding and looked up from his work. When his friend spotted him, a smile appeared on his face, only to be immediately replaced by a scowl. “Cas? Whatcha doing there? You watching me? Hell, that’s creepy.”
“Quarter past four, though I think you might rather sleep in your own bed than to spend the night in the car.”
In June 1987, the Winchesters are staying at the Roadhouse. John returns from a hunt and shows his homophobic side. He's immediately told off by Ellen who knows Dean is hidden behind the bar, listening in.
“Getting better?” the older one asked cheekily.
“You did, but I’m under the assumption that you were talking about getting to know my body. I would like to give you the release you’re craving. But if you want me stop, just say a word and I’ll stop.”
“Nothing, love,” Cas reassured him, brushing a kiss on his cheek. “Sam’s just teasing.”
Once again, he could feel the freezing cold rush through his body. This time, he anticipated what was coming. Still, he was struggling. He might have lost but he wouldn’t give in, despite knowing full well, it was exactly what the Shadow wanted. It wanted to play, to taunt, and to torture him.

“Like this?” His little brother moved his arms robotically.
“You can do that? From here?” If she wanted to go that route, let her go that route.
“Brinner?” Castiel asked, raising his eyebrow questioningly.
Castiel could feel eyes on him when he buttoned up his shirt. Slowly, he looked up and found Dean staring at him, his mouth hanging open, looking absolutely stunning. Like the first time Castiel had seen him in that suit.
When Dean’s steady breath indicated he was soundly asleep, Castiel hesitated only one moment before he gave in to his longing. It would be just for a few minutes he tried to convince himself as he sank down on the bed, his arms resting tightly next to his body, his eyes still focused only on the hunter. He wished he could still know what Dean was thinking, what he was dreaming of. However, Dean had emphasised personal space far too often for Castiel to break his trust, and moreover, his grace had never fully recovered after he got it back. After all, he was a fallen angel whose “mojo”, as Dean would call it, was just a sorry reminder of his former glory. Castiel didn’t miss his days back in Heaven but the limitations of his grace were tiring. Without his power he felt useless. Still, he wouldn’t change a bit of it when it meant he never would have gotten the chance to encounter Dean.
Behind the trees was a meadow. Even better, there was no one in sight. “This will do,” Dean grumbled and took the cake from Castiel, setting it down on the grass. He let himself fall beside it and pulled Castiel down.

Sam stared at him as if he had gone crazy. And he probably was. All of a sudden, Dean questioned everything. Was he still dead? Was this a dream? Had he dreamt that Cas was back? It was too good to be true. Hell, too many of his dreams had pictured Cas’ wings over the years. Cas kissing him, holding him. How he had longed for that.
*****
“Yeah, good for you.” Despite his good mood, Dean still was furious.
They couldn’t get all four of them into Baby and drive down to Garden City, hoping they would find a solution there. He would never forgive himself putting Sammy in danger during a hunt. All his childhood he had been drilled to keep his brother safe whatever the cost. And he had done it over and over again.
When they entered the library a little while later, Sammy spotted them, immediately stopping whatever he was doing, and came running towards them. Dean anticipated Sammy’s moves and let go of Cas’ hand to wait for his laughing brother, bending his knees and opening his arms. Sammy jumped and from one moment to another everything went dark.
Nobody talked to her when she entered the diner through the staff entry on the back. Luckily, there she found what she had hoped for: a trucker cap with the diner’s logo and a vest with the nametag “Laura”. Well, that would work. Snagging a tray at the kitchen hatch with a random table number Claire found her way to the booths, trying to spot the witch.
Dean stayed silent.
“Fly her back? No way. She ain’t no fucking airplane. My baby belongs on the road,” Dean objected.
“Then who’s in charge?” Sam inquired.
Castiel approached Sam carefully, not wanting to upset him even more. “I’m Castiel. Dean is not here. But he is a good friend of mine. I will take you to him. Do you trust me?”
Dean hesitated. As if he had needed another reminder of Cas being so above him and at the same right next to him. Seeking reassurance, Dean rested his head back on his angel’s shoulder and held onto the lapels, figuring out his next move. After all the feelings he already shared today, spilled accidentally and freely, he took heart, softly speaking more towards the all too familiar trench coat than towards the love of his life. “Uh, this might sound weird coming from me. Looking at my ... well, rep. I ... Hope I’m not presuming anything. But, uh, you know, my history of relationships is nearly nonexistent. Living on the road certainly didn’t help. I really don’t want to rush and ruin things for once. You’re special, damn it, you’re the most important person in my life.”
“Think of that, dude,” Dean finally chimed in, enthusiastically, “you see Eileen a lot sooner that way. Hasn’t she returned from her hunt while we were gone? You two could spend some really nice hours alone in the bunker.” He wiggled his eyebrows, shooting finger guns towards his brother. “Just keep it in your room. No defiling anything, especially not the War Room table.” Sam glared at his brother. “Don’t deny you never considered it.”
He didn’t know why Garth already knew what had happened – assuming everyone who had been Thanos-ed by Chuck didn’t remember a thing –, but he had known and let them know that his family was fine.
Castiel’s hands were still resting on Dean’s back and now wandered tentatively upwards. His feelings and his newly restored grace caused literal sparks to erupt inside the barn, and with a thunderous crack through reality, his wings appeared on the earthly plane.
“Damn it, angel. That was awesome! But the actual meaning. Fucking awe-inspiring.”
“Why? What’s it called?” Dean asked between huge bites.
“Yes, he said so his morning, several times. I don’t understand why being an angel seems to be a problem, though.”
After several minutes Dean broke the silence. “That could be me. If you hadn’t–” His voice trembled. Obviously he was fighting another set of emotions welling up inside him. “Shit, Cas! Sam–” Dean took a deep breath. “Sammy would have been on his own, all alone, having to see me burn.”
“It’s okay, Donna. I know Cas isn’t Dad. Just the thought of him getting it on with Dean.” Claire shuddered.
“I thought … You know … maybe. Fuck, it’s stupid.” Dean fiddled with the torch’s gas hoses.
Jack nodded, still not understanding, neither Sam nor 'nostalgia'.

Dean would never know what else Claire had nicked from the Impala’s trunk last night, not until he did a thorough inventory. It had been worth the few minutes she had lost in the witch’s pursuit. With the transmitter in the witch’s car, Claire had known she wouldn’t lose her.
“You’re ready to go on a witch hunt?” Sam grinned and immediately turned the car and drove in their new direction.
Dean would be in no condition to hunt for the next several days, so it was logical to return to Sam and Jack, especially since Claire had called to say that she had also left town. She had been smart enough to plan ahead, and before they even had arrived at the farm, had put a transmitter in the witch’s car which she now was tracking east.
asking you.”
This was it. This was exactly what Castiel had always feared, only never imagined this way. They couldn’t just go back to where they had been all those years, though neither of them seemed to know how to move on.
“You just don’t fall in love with your best friend who happens to be an Angel of the Lord, able to smite you with one wrong look and to vanish with a flap of his wings never to be seen again.”
Claire couldn’t help to smile and silently cursed herself for it, knowing the witch would use any weakness she could find.
“He won’t stop as long as there is hope. And he still tries to win you over, you know? Show you he’s worth your trust.”
Yet, feeling Dean in his arms, being allowed to touch, to explore, and seeing his love for Castiel radiating in his whole being, was intoxicating. How could he have lived without it for so long? Even after only the short moments they had shared so far, he never wanted to miss it again.
“Don’t
“So I’ll fly Sam to the bunker, immediately return to you, and we can drive all the way home together.”

“I’ll fuck up,” Dean said, his voice bursting out into the silence.
The kitchen fell silent at once. Dean nearly choked on the fries he was eating. He felt heat rising in him and supposed his whole face was burning red hot. In another world, another life, there would have been only one answer:
Cas was gone. And he was utterly alone. He’d loved him. Cas had loved him. The asshole had loved him and now he was gone and everything he had ever wanted had vanished with him.
Once again, Castiel’s hand wandered down, yet without the heat that had passed between them just moments ago. With skilled hands he helped Dean to lose his pants, socks, and T-shirt. Guiding him towards the bed, he sat him down on the edge. Castiel searched for sleeping shirts for both of them, and handed one of them to his friend while getting rid of his own pants and undershirt.
“Dean? He sleeps like a baby. We leave him here. At least, that way he can’t complain,” Sam scoffed.
He found himself in the younger Winchester's arms, hugging his friend back tightly. “It’s good to be back, Sam.”
Dean’s free hand had once again found its way to his wings and was caressing his feathers before Dean let it wander back to the joints on Castiel’s back, burying his fingers deep into the downy feathers.
“Whoa! Careful, Romeo,” he exclaimed. “Did I do that?”
“It’s her, Dean. I can feel her. And she is alone,” Castiel said, confirming Claire’s observations. “Apart from you two she is the only human on the whole property.”
“Sam called when you headed through Lebanon and told me you would arrive shortly. I figured you must be hungry and tired after driving all day. Therefore, I am preparing dinner while you can rest.”
“Dean,” Cas said, trying to reach out, only stopping mere inches before he touched Dean’s arm yet again. Dean didn’t know how his friend managed to sound chiding and begging at the same time, mixed with a note of a broken heart underneath.
“Yes, give us some romcom and we might invite you again,” Patience teased.
“Of course, I will.” He was taken aback by the sudden vulnerability. “I’ll always stay when you ask me.”
But Dean wouldn’t listen. “Hell, I won’t,” Dean stormed out the car as fast as his battered body allowed it, inhaling the cold air and trying to calm himself down. Leaning against Baby’s hood to keep himself from falling down, Dean waited for the driver’s door to open but Cas didn’t come after him. After a while – he couldn’t tell whether it had been five minutes or an hour – Dean’s legs would barely keep him up any longer. So he opened the passenger door and let himself drop onto the seat, avoiding looking at Cas, and kept his mouth firmly shut.
“Angel?”
“Yes, Dean, mammoths. I miss them. You should have seen them. They were magnificent creatures.”
“Don’t be discouraged when Dean falls back into his old habits. It’s hard for him. He never learned to share his feelings. More than anything, Dad looked down on us when we did so. I can’t imagine how hard it must have been for Dean growing up and realising he wasn’t the straight son Dad expected him to be. He must have been out of his mind when he found out. And yet I didn’t know for a long time. Dean never said anything. It took me years to catch hints of it, probably only after we started hunting again after Stanford ... after Jess.” For a moment Sam struggled to keep up his demeanour, old memories still hurting too much, before he once again faced Castiel. “And that doesn’t even cover the fact that you’re an angel.”
With a feeling of despair that certainly wasn’t his own, Castiel awoke from a dreamless sleep, his power sufficiently replenished. It only took him a moment to pinpoint the source of this horrible dread –
“You okay?”
human. Humanity was his greatest strength. Emotions, feelings, love. Dean’s unwavering love for his brother and Sam’s mental strength were their only chance to end this, to defeat his brothers, both Michael and Lucifer, to defy Heaven and Hell. Humanity and love were their strongest weapons and he would merely serve as distraction.
“Hey!” Dean protested.
His train of thought was interrupted when he heard Dean right before he entered, heading straight to the fridge to get some beer. One bottle he handed to Castiel, the other one he kept for himself. “Sammy’s safe and sound in his bed. Never thought I’d see that kid again. Was asleep before he even hit the pillow.” He shook his head. “So, any ideas? Probably should make a plan of action. Tomorrow.”
“Oh, I will be back when you meet the others. Don’t worry.” Jack smiled. “They are waiting, but they will have to wait a bit more.”
“I love you too, love.”
Dean relented. With a clang, the knife landed on the countertop, and Dean’s arms, now finally free, hugged back properly.
He let his palm touch Dean’s cheek and stroked the tender skin with his thumb, relishing the touch of finger tips against the firm jaw line. Dean’s eyes were back on him. All this shouldn’t have taken more than seconds but even for him it felt like an eternity.
In his unconscious state of mind, Dean shuffled over to his little brother, wrapping his arms around him, and hugged him tightly. Soothed by the knowledge of his brother being safe, his dream finally dissipated and left him to sleep peacefully for the remainder of the night. It probably was the first time in months that his mind could fully rest for a moment.
Dean groaned. All he needed now was more cockblocking from his brother. He should have known. Once again, his bed and the things he was planning to do inside with his angel became a distant prospect.
