"Look I'm gonna stop you right there buddy, I lov-liked a guy, uno." He held his index finger up for effect. "I never...did anything, it was too late." He stared at his empty shot glasses, whishing the bartender would come back and give him a refill.
“Glad to have some company in hell?” Castiel joked with a sardonic tone, trying to act as normal as possible, well as normal as someone can be when they are counting the freckles on another person's face.
Hannah was an attractive girl with dark hair and blue eyes that matched Castiel’s, they were often mistaken for siblings but Hannah would just blush and gasp “No!” Even though Hannah was the closest thing he actually had to a sister.
Castiel gasped again and dug his fingers into Dean’s back. “Dean ah-h do that again!” Dean copied his last movement hitting Cas’ prostate again and again.
"Cas..." He sat up, his face inches from the face of the man he wanted so much. Castiel lifted two fingers to his forehead and he felt the headache subsiding.
All three sat there chatting until an hour was up. Mr McLeod came in to tell the boys they could leave and his eyes narrowed when they fell on Charlie. “Ah, Miss Bradbury. Visitation time already?”
"He's handsome isn't he?" She cupped the angel's jaw forcing him to look her in the eye, Dean wanted to yell
he thought to himself. Although he couldn’t complain, he had some great friends. He had known Gabriel and Hannah since they were all in Kindergarten. They did regular friend stuff like load up on carbs and gossip about who was with who, go to parties and do sleepovers.
But Castiel had fallen asleep. On Dean. Fantastic.
"Cas, come on man you can't stay like that all day." Dean crouched down to where Castiel was splayed out on the floor like a regretful starfish.
“Yeah, I just hope Charlie hasn’t invited the entire school.” He narrowed his eyes in a way that Charlie knew was light-hearted.
Inside was bright lights and people pushing and shoving their way to items they had no need for. "Sam you get toothbrushes, deodorant and hair products me 'n Cas are getting him clothes, meet back here in half an hour. Got it?"
As Dean downed his fourth glass, he heard the Bunker door open and watched as Sam and Jack stepped through in morbid silence. “Dean why the fuck didn’t you answer your phone? I thought something had happened. They’re all gone Dean, everyone is dead...I think it’s Chuck, it was all Chuck.”
“I should have said it back when you...I should have said it back.”
"Never imagined that uh, that uh...Wisconsin motels would have such good...uh WIFI." He nodded his head once to make his point and stumbled to his bed.
His hand hovers over Castiel's erection before finally gripping it firmly.
“You’re saying it now, Dean.”
"Cas wait." He got up from his position on the bed. "I'm not- I'm not mad, I was just worried." Castiel turned back to him and Dean moved closer. "Look. See it from my perspective man! I thought I had lost you again." Dean gripped the sleeve of his friends tan trench coat. "I...I can't loose you." He felt the tears but he pushed them back. "And you did good, you did so good." He thumbed the soft material.
His only thoughts before running to the bathroom retching in the toilet were why followed by vomit.
Dean sighed unhappily. "M'sorry...I don't know...I'm so confused." Steve nodded and patted Dean's shoulder.
“Fuck Cas, need you so badly.” He kissed Castiel’s neck and sucked on a point just below his ear which made Cas gasp loudly. Then he started trailing kisses down his chest, he even took a nipple in his mouth and bit down lightly, now that really made Cas moan.
Sam is stuck in the middle of all this angst, will he survive?
“You’re just two humans, two humans that I created for the purpose of a story, you really believe that you have the power to end it? You will never be free.”
"When angels die they do not go to heaven or hell because we don't have souls, we go to a place called the empty, a place of complete darkness and silence, locked in an eternal sleep. Somehow I was awoken and the entity that lived there wanted me gone, so here I am."
"Cas? Wait Cas!" Damnit Dean thought they really gotta stop storming out on each other.
Slowly he pushed in, Cas could feel every inch of him and when Dean bottomed out, he groaned and swept Cas up in another kiss.
Then Dean started to remove Cas’ tie and unbutton his shirt, he didn’t know what he was doing only that he needed to feel more skin on skin, he wanted to feel every inch of Castiel.
They both gasped as Dean pulled out completely and then slowly inserted himself again, followed by short, sweet hip movements that made Castiel screw his eyes shut.
"You died, I saw you...man we burned your body." Sam returned the hug, they finished with a manly back pat and one last touch of the shoulder.
There is Sam, waiting at the table with his arms crossed and a pissed off expression.
"Oh, I see...I uh...I have to go." Then Castiel retreated to his room.
Cas' hard arousal springs free and hits his stomach. "So beautiful." Dean whispers.
"Yeah...but you know we need you right?" Without any warning Dean pulls Cas into a crushing hug. "Promise you'll never leave me." He whispers in his ear. Castiel returned the hug, resting his chin on Deans shoulder, the whisper sends chills down his spine. Dean brings his hand up to stroke the back of his head.
He started to press delicate kisses to Castiel’s cock which made him whimper, Dean had never done anything like this before but what the hell. He sucked lightly on the tip and then put Cas’s aching dick in his mouth which drew out an elicit cry of pleasure from the angel’s lips and those only get more intense as he started sucking and bobbing his head up and down faster and faster until Cas’ put a hand on his shoulder and through gritted teeth begged him to stop. “Dean I won’t last much lon-AH-ger. I want to feel you please.”
You. Are. Nothing.
Reluctantly he gets up, puts on a shirt and trudges downstairs where his aunt is waiting, reading the Stone Hill times, his wardrobe consisted of oversized hoodies that hung off his slim frame, plain shirts and jeans, for a gay male, he did not dress well if he were to indulge in the stereotype.
Castiel screamed as Dean nailed his prostate with every thrust. "Dean Dean Dean oh!" He chanted like a prayer. "Cas y-you feel." That's all he could manage, he jerked his angel faster and faster, driven on getting him to spill his load right then and there.
"What the hell is wrong with you man? You keep wanting to abandon us!" He tried to calm down for Cas' sake. It was his temper and irrational thoughts that had driven him off last time.
"Go on..." Dean said under his breath.
"Cas. Man just tell me what's going on."
it reads. "Fucking dreams." He grumbles, feeling a pang of sadness that it was over. Sam won't be awake for another half hour but Dean decides to get up anyway and make coffee.
New boyfriend what? Oh Steve! Fuck no no Steve was just a friend and he had been really drunk. I want you not him, can't you see how much I missed you? Dean's head screamed.
"None of your business." He snapped back.
They both took a seat at the bar and Dean ordered whiskey, he didn't hesitate to knock it back as soon as he saw it on the counter. Looking a little bit more relaxed he nudged Castiel's arm with his own and smiled.
...pm? Wait, shit! Dean had slept the entire day?
Sam, Dean and Castiel ventured into the dark woods.
"What?"
He squinted at the unrelenting rays. "Castiel." He tried again, shaking the angel.
He shed the trenchcoat, the tie, the suit jacket and his shoes, Castiel looked almost naked.
She shrugs and starts to put on her clothes.
"Where you ever gonna tell me? Huh?"
Chuck manifested a chair and a high pedestal to get a good look at the fight, he rung his hands together with glee. “This is going to be good.”
Castiel could imagine Green chuckling softly after reading about his recurring dream about Dr. Sexy from the medical drama, he had found it strange at first but after a while couldn’t wait to go to sleep so he could dream of muscular men in Doctor outfits.
“I won’t Dean.”
"Dude! I'm not..not into that. I mean...I don't know." The man looks sympathetic.
They were at the beach this time, usually it was Dean's bedroom, dim lights, worshipping every inch of each other, the beach huh?
"Then why do you keep wanting to leave?"
Dean just stands there. "Cas that's not-"
"Whoever." Sam corrects, eyeing the hickey on his neck.
"Yeah can we get two rooms?" He smiled hopefully but she just shook her head. "We only have two Queens available." Sam groaned internally. He could see the sexual frustration radiating off the angel and his brother and sooner or later they were going to explode, he just didn't want to be in the blast zone. "We'll take it." He gritted out.
"Dean yes...please." He could hardly form sentences, god Dean wondered what an orgasm would do, he wanted to jerk his angel off right now, see the surprised expression on his face as he came followed by pleasure. But he also wanted to take his time, as it was their first time. Dean wasn't particularly experienced with Gay sex at all but he had watched enough porn to know what he was doing. He reached for his draw and pulled out a bottle of lube, squirting the cold substance onto his fingers. "You ready for this?" He asked with a forehead kiss and felt the angel nod again.
“how come you always talk like ya swallowed a dictionary Cas?” He teased.
"Don't you touch him you bitch!" Dean spat. "I'll fucking kill you." She ignored Dean's threats and carried on. "Eventually I'll rip out his heart, oh but he's an angel I guess I'll have to remove his grace first." She reached inside his trenchcoat and pulled out his angel blade. "Don't worry, I'll keep you immortal for now, it's not very exciting when the victim passes out."
Chuck laughed and his army halted with a wave of his hand. Suddenly the angels and demons found that they couldn’t move. “Dean!” Cas called out but Dean’s eyes were focused on Chuck.
"We've been friends for years so it's not like we are rushing into anything, there is nothing we don't know about each other. Personally I never thought I would settle down, this life doesn't exactly allow that, but what we just did- I guess I kinda thought...and well."
Castiel lay there unmoving. "You promised." He whispered.
Sam, Dean and Castiel made it back to the bunker in silence, half in shock and half in no one really knew what to say.
Tonight Castiel will not fully loosen Dean up, he will make sure to relax his muscles just the minimum amount required for tonight. Castiel has done that before, open someone enough to not hurt the bottom and still be really tight for the top so it is pleasurable for the both of them. Castiel gently lowers Dean on his dick, slowly impaling the hunter on his cock, almost letting the gravity do all the job. Dean whines and lightly moves his hips, trying to get more of Castiel's hot length inside of him; he is not fully awake but he feels everything and is conscious enough to ask for more. Castiel gladly takes Dean by the hips and lowers him on one move until he is fully sat against Castiel's balls, fully laying on his chest, moaning with his eyes half opened unfocused, with his pupils blown on wing oil.
Nothing changes between his mom and his lover for a while, he feels guilty, just not enough to stop sleeping with Castiel. Dean is in love for the first time in his life and he won't let go of Castiel.
Now both of them are scared, the tension in the room is as palpable as the desire that Castiel can feel when he is with his pets. The seraph tries to think logically. There is no way that anyone told him, there was not anyone else in that room or cameras, he checked; the curtains were closed, and Castiel made sure that Dean was asleep the whole time, for the three nights. The only witness was Angelica. She could not have said anything, she has been with him this whole time.
Please read the tags! This is dark and Castiel isn't nice at all.
If you don't like this kind of fanfic don't read it and please don't leave anything mean in the comments. This is harmless kinky fanfic that I wrote and I don't condone this relationship in real life.
He hums in acknowledgment.
Even after feeding all week on his bondmaids and various willing people he still craves the power from Dean’s soul. No, he craves Dean.
Emma and Jack are fantastic with them. He knows they will be alright if he leaves them for a little while. Both of the babies are sound asleep for now, and the two nannies that he hired for this event seem to be handling everything. He could go and quickly fuck Lisa in his office. Just twenty minutes, he has made her come quicker than that. It is not ideal, but Lisa clearly made an effort to look good for Castiel and she deserves a price, even if he is not what he wants.
The angel tries to be there as much as possible, but he also has to provide for them and find pets to keep feeding off. He will not stop, he cannot stop having children. It’s not an option, at least not until he has a garrison, his own heaven on earth.
Even though Castiel is shorter, he makes Dean feel smaller and strangely safe and protected. Yeah, this is fucked up. He likes it, he fucking likes it.
"I'm going to come inside of you like the little whore you are and when I'm done we are gonna go to my apartment and I'm going to fuck you again. Understand?"
He fixed the man’s heart and the rest of his illness for a small fortune. Word expanded fast about his abilities and soon he had clients all over the world. He had to feed various times a day to keep on with the demand of his grace.
He could keep on fucking him, but he is curious about the hunter’s mouth. Those lips look just like if they were made to be wrapped around him.
Castiel signals one of the nannies, the short one with curly hair, maybe her name was Whitney? To come and watch the kids, while he gets up and goes to his office, Lisa just behind him. Far enough so the children and adults will not ask questions. As soon as he gets to his office he closes the door and throws Lisa on her back on the couch. He lifts her stupidly tight dress to her waist, and lowers himself to taste her, unexpectedly but welcome she is wearing a butt plug.
It’s fucking weird, now that they are face to face, their noses almost touching, Dean can smell something familiar. Is similar to a rainy day and lighting. How the fuck does he know what lighting smells like? Is scarily good.
He is quite hungry, starving actually. However, he refuses to hurt Dean with his feeding. It isn’t something he enjoys. Even though Castiel is already half hard, he uses the time wisely. He is a generous lover, making sure that the temperature in this revolting motel room is fine, puts a pillow under Dean’s pelvis, and uses his grace to loosen the hunter’s muscles up, just a bit. It only requires a quick touch and saves him time that he can use for feeding.
“I was just feeding you some of my wing oil.” Castiel smiles. “You liked it.”
He removes the dildo from Dean’s mouth with a loud pop. Dean blushes, even more, making his freckles stand out profusely on the milky skin. He gets rid of the condom and places the toy on his used instruments tray, to be washed later. “Strip”
Castiel looks pleased to see that Dean is awake.
Why isn't he weirded out by Castiel's demands? Like the dude wants to be angel married or something.
They can go and read, watch something on their tablets, or work on a quiet hobby until one am. Then it is time to go to bed. Castiel is lucky that he does not need sleep, the kids need a lot of attention.
"What are you doing to me?" Pants Dean, grinding harder on Castiel.
"I didn't think you were the type that lets people eat on the bed." Comments Dean, stuffing his face with everything in his reach.
“This usually doesn’t happen often, but your son seems to be able to come even without a knot. He is now one of the highest pedigree Omegas in the world.” Pants Castiel, still fucking The boy, shivering on the table due to oversensitivity.
Castiel just has to take himself in his hand and get on his knees on the bed, next to Dean’s cock sucking lips, and slowly introduce his dick into that tempting mouth of his. Unhurriedly, the seraph rocks in and out of the young man’s mouth. The repetitive friction on the motions rapidly gets him hard, as Dean feeds on the oil, and starts moaning at getting used by Castiel.
It is not possible, yet it appears that the house is covered in eerie silence for a moment. After what could be a second, or perhaps a full year, everything starts to come alive, and regain its realness once again. Dean is lying next to Castiel, his breathing is calm, and the angel finds himself getting relaxed by listening to the pattern of white noise. He can feel Dean’s heartbeat regaining a normal beat as time goes by.
Dean is sixteen when Mary finds John fucking Dean's girlfriend, Lisa on their bed. She immediately throws him out of the house and asks for a divorce. It turned out that it wasn't the first time, Liss had been pregnant for almost three months. Mary also finds out that he has a secret child named Adam.
He tries to think about the positives. She cares about the little ones, she does not complain about the lack of Castiel’s attention when he is working or when he is occupied with pressing matters. She looks lovely and doesn’t ask for much. Renee is kind and sweet, still not his type. He knows she will never be his mate, he does not want her, she just was there offering herself, and the very next minute she was with child.
So I don't know if this is getting darker or not, so beware. Remember that Cas just cares about himself... I'm not totally sure but he is kind of a sociopath, dunno, I'm definitely not an expert. The only thing I know is that he is shit to all the people that he sleeps with, and all of that. I felt so sad for Kelly writing this.
He is truly alone now, It’s better if he goes and sleeps. Ignoring his thoughts it’s the way to go. He won’t think about the fact that no one wants him. In the morning he won’t remember.
It's better if he just eats and ignores the rest for now.
He presses in Dean’s mouth harder and deeper, half gagging him, instead of pulling away Dean Opens up for him with a moan. Castiel does not need to look to know that Dean is starting to get hard, no training, and yet he is perfect. Even asleep he knows that he belongs to Castiel.
Mary adores the hot doctor and only talks wonderful things about him
“It sounds well and all, but I do have to talk about it with my wife. She wants to keep in contact with the boy, and we need the money ASAP.”
Marie blinks at Dean, confused at his presence. She looks at Castiel and when he smiles and nods at her she raises her arms for Dean to pick her up. He complies with the dark-haired toddler's wishes.
Dean raises his eyebrows at Castiel's comment. Right, normal people do not use bird terminology for their offspring. They should it sound proper and sweet.
"I want you, Dean. I want a mate that I can expend the rest of my life with. You are it for me, Dean."
Just like Dean, from time to time, some stubborn humans, deny him his godly given right to have pets. They refuse to accept and act on the attraction they feel for Castiel. How foolish of them.
The hunter arches on the couch and tries to grab at whatever he has access from Castiel.
They should be dismissed from their classes in less than ten minutes, and they will want to see the new shiny thing that is Dean. Maybe even Mrs. Donna and Mrs. Linda will want to get to meet Dean. That will be scheduled for later when he feels comfortable with other humans getting near his mate.
At least he has now a new babysitter that is definitely not interested in him and that will help him with the children. The only thing that is left is to start wooing Dean. Tomorrow he will go to the restaurant and he will introduce himself.
Monster pheromones probably.
"Cas?"
He sits back on his desk just as Meg comes back and hands him the copy and the original to John. She smiles, flirting with the man. “Everything is legal and on the register. In case you need anything else, let me know.”
Castiel doesn't mind that Mary works late most days and that she has to travel for work a lot. He is nice to Sam and Dean and he even offers to pay for Sam's expensive boarding school in England. He just put a million dollars on the kid's college fund. He is trying way too hard.
Now he has everything, all that he wanted and the entirety of what he deserves. He just needs Dean to drink it.
Using the new oil to lube himself up, he gets ready. He is quite big and thick for a human male body, yet he knows that Dean won’t have a problem taking all of him. He is a vessel, and Castiel has faith in him. With a knee at each side of Dean, he carefully separates the young man’s knees. He feels giddy with want.
He could get out, but it would be weird, and now there's people in the basement, he can hear them. They start playing some loud annoying pop song. Great, now he's trapped with the blue eyed weirdo.
"We are warriors, not guardians or miracle workers." He lowers himself to lick at Dean's nipple.
Dean lets go of him and it feels like a physical blow to Castiel. As soon as he leaves him he goes back and holds his cheek, looking him dead in the eyes.
Castiel shushes him as he tries to get free. “Dean please, you said we needed to talk.” He sighs, and lets go of Dean but still trapped. “Let’s talk, Dean. I promise I will not lie about anything. You can trust me.”
Maybe then he can take a break.
Castiel takes himself in hand, pumping himself while admiring the view. His future mate laying under him, ready to take him. He whispers a sleepy and chocked “Please.” The angel comes all over Dean’s face and open mouth.
Claire, Anna, and Daniel are in the same class, Jack and Emma are in another. When the nestlings are finally ready for school they will have their own class too, with their private teachers.
"These are the youngest of my children Dean. Kids, say hello."
He hands Mr. Winchester the registration document and takes the medical chart in his hand and lets Dean behind the curtain to sit on a medical table. The young man sits, barely breathing, looking at the floor. Castiel ignores him as he takes a new pair of gloves and quickly washes a medical vibrator and knotted dildo, and covers them each with a condom, and places them on the table next to Dean. The Omega looks at them from the corners of his eye and flushes, quickly looking back at the floor.
He takes the knotted dildo and directs a commanding “Open up” to the Omega. He only opens his mouth enough for the tip to fit on his pink mouth, Castiel takes his jam firmly and coaxes him to open himself fully, forcing him to swallow the medium size dildo until the Omega deep throats it with scared and surprised eyes, and his hands holding on the table for dear life. He takes the dildo by the base and decided to not hold himself back for a while, lazily fucks Dean’s mouth with the dildo, watching him take it, unable to do anything, as the silicone length moves in and out of his throat. The doctor changes his speed, fucking that pink mouth hard. The omega chokes a little and Castiel lets go of the toy, still in his throat.
Dean can’t believe it, it should be dead. Why isn’t it dead?
Dean comes with a whine, hugging Castiel’s dick like a vice. This time the angel decides to come on and in him. It suits Dean, he looks like if he already belonged to Castiel, all covered on the Angel’s come, also full of it, leaking semen all over the legs, with his legs twitching.
Both John and Dean make a surprised sound, on the other side of the curtain, Dean moves, clearly trying to listen, and gotten caught.
He smiles, touched.
He has never done this. Castiel unfolds his wings and allows them to cover himself and Dean with them. Dean tenses and moans lowly below him at the first contact of the feathers on his skin. The feathers cannot feel, yet is still nice to have the hunter connected to a real part of himself, even if they are incorporeal.
Today is Claire’s tenth birthday, and Castiel organized her a nice and proper party. The team of this event is “Carnival” because the birthday girl is now obsessed with the greatest showman, though he suspects that she has developed a crush on the pink haired actress.
None of them know what to do now, Castiel wants to sleep with Dean again but is too soon, and he does not want to overwhelm the hunter, and he wants Dean to stay, he cannot go.
Even without being an angel, Castiel would be able to see how exhausted Dean is as he yawns. He has gotten through so much today and he should rest. He just needs a small amount of grace to get Dean to sleep just for a little while. Just so he feels relaxed when he wakes up.
The fingers get out of him and something bigger presses at his entrance. Castiel slides his cock into him and quickly starts to thrust into him. It's the good kind of burn.
Please read the tags! This is dark and Castiel isn't nice at all.
Castiel picks up his pace, fucking harder into Dean, pounding his big cock in the tight ass. Dean starts to pounce his hips, whining loudly by the Alpha rough thrusts, now holding the table again with cries of pleasure. This is his favorite part of his job, fucking sweet young things that can’t keep their mouth shut with the surprise of his touch. He doesn’t want to stop, but the sooner he finishes, the sooner he can start to convince his father to sell him to Cas.
They stop next to the nursery before Dean can answer and the angel sends a wave of positive reinforcement to Dean's brain through a kiss on his cheek, his human form is unable to consciously feel the grace on his body that is definitely doing its work. He is so good for Castiel.
The blonde woman ran away as soon as their captor was dead, but the redhead stayed and thanked him. She offered herself to him. It felt... nice, to lay with someone and not feel pain for a while, and when she came Castiel was able to feed off of her soul without hurting her. He did not know that was possible and yet it still happened.
She would be gone by the morning, just like the chick from yesterday. There are always women at the bars for him to charm for a night. Still, it doesn’t stop him from feeling isolated. Usually, he wouldn’t think about this, but he's drunk, so what the hell.
He doesn’t look totally sure. “I think I’m going to try marrying him off back at home. Here it says that he is worth at least two million, but Mary doesn’t want to lose the kid. He’s always been her baby.”
John shakes his hand one last time. “Thank you so much doc. I gotta go and call Mary now and explain everything to her.”
“Have you come to a decision on selling or auctioning him, John?”
He looks for the source of the sound. Renne is waiting for him by the stairs, she knows that he would go to his office to confirm his appointments for the day before going to check on the children. The dark-haired woman smiles at him, eyes shining with anticipation.
"They keep me busy, indeed." He holds Dean's hand. "And there are other seven Nephilim on the way. In five months all of them will be here, and hopefully, there will be at least another four on the way. "
Castiel grins. One of his daughters accepting Dean is such a marvelous emotion that he cannot imagine how will it be when he finally gets to have his complete family. When he is finally able to impregnate Dean.
The hand crafted crystal bottles clinks on his trench coat pocket as Castiel extracts and places it next to the bed. He quietly undresses Dean, lightly caressing every inch of golden freckled skin that he uncovers, it takes inhuman strength of him to not kiss and worship this radiant human resting in front of him.
As soon as John leaves he is going to come inside of him.
The redhead witch drinks her mimosa, trying to be near enough Castiel so they can talk without being overheard, but not near the baby. She has never liked the younglings, though lately, on some occasions she chats with the oldest of his children.
I hope you enjoy this.
His neighbors and friends will only see Dean as Castiel's. Always full with his babies, only belonging to him. Luckily all the people in this city do not talk or gossip about him with outsiders. He protects and heals them, they turn a blind eye to what he does. Sometimes they send young fertile women to his door. Well, not anymore.
Slowly, to make sure that the hunter is asleep, Castiel walks to him. At first, he settles for giving a light brush to Dean’s exposed back. He gets rid of the duvet, caressing his tights, arms, and finally his face. Even sound asleep he looks gorgeous like no human has the right to be. It seems dreamlike, almost as if this was one of Castiel’s dreams. Except that he doesn’t sleep.
Dean decides that the best thing to do now, in this heat is swimming naked in the pool. He leaves his stuff next to the pool and jumps.
Baby alexander and Baby Philippa were having trouble sleeping last night, nothing seemed to calm them down until exhaustion finally send them to sleep. Singing usually sends them to sleep right away, but they are currently getting used to needing less sleep and that makes them feel confused and fussy. The twins can handle that on their own, except that their crying does not let their siblings sleep, even if they couldn’t hear it, their energy affects the rest of the Nephilim.
He is seventeen when Mary starts dating the new neighbor, Castiel. She met him at a boring adult party that he refused to go to. Four months after that she marries the man in a simple ceremony with a private party that even makes its way on the local paper.
Angels are not a hive mind, still, they are social creatures who need to engage with each other. They are used to feeling and talking through a wavelength of celestial intent, and there was not any Angel on earth beside him. Completely alone.
"Cas?"
Dean doesn't answer so Castiel bites harder, drawing blood from the skin. He licks the wound.
Dean looks at himself, now standing, trembling like a frightened animal. The hunter sits back and hides his hands.
"She is already in the birthing room, waiting for you."
He keeps thrusting into Dean, now aiming for his prostate. Drawing louder whines from the charming thing, while Castiel liberally feeds the rest of the transparent oil to Dean. Forcing his mouth open with his free hand.
The young man is already writhing on the bed, and sighing to the light touches that Castiel gives to his hole, circling, caressing, introducing two fingers until he can bend them inside of Dean. The angel shoves down Dean’s boxers, sending them across the room to the floor, not even bothering to see where they fall. The offending garment will only get in the way.
Without even explicitly thinking about their sexual activities, or touching himself, Castiel starts to feel himself hardening. His memories of Dean are way too tempting and is such a shame that he does not have time to fly to the motel and get his fix of Dean Winchester.
Castiel doesn't have any shame, he just straddles Dean's legs and starts to slowly, grinding his ass on Dean's dick.
No beta, so any mistakes are my own. English is not my first language, if anything doesn't make sense, please let me know.
Thank you so much to everybody that has been leaving comments on this, it means a lot to me, and I'm so very thankful.
He slept with a man, not only a man but a monster. A monster that claims to be an angel. Angels don't exist, but right now Dean can't fix on that. That dude is weird, and a monster. And he doesn't understand what no, means, and he is a man. Fuck. John never has to find about this or Dean is fucked.
“I would never put you in second place, my little bird. I underestimated the time once and that is why I could not attend breakfast with all of you, it will not happen again.”
“I would need to be harder on him.” It’s something that he really wants, though that is something he usually saves after he buys the Omegas.
Dean hums, chewing the food. Everything is delicious and fresh, this food must be fucking expensive. The restaurants that Dean usually eats at have warm and tasty food. Everything is tasty if it's covered in grease and salt. All of the things that Cas brought for him are fricking awesome, he even has that exotic fruit that Dean used once to hunt a weird school of crawly monsters. He had to wait two weeks to find, and get one, then stuck in customs and it was a day away from rotting, this one is juicy and firm. He bets that Castiel gets everything in an organic and fair trade place or something market that would cost weeks’ worth of money for food on Dean's cheap restaurants.
So sorry for the delay, it was my mom's birthday, then I had to make a four-day trip to another city where I couldn't edit this, then my glasses broke, anyway... here it is. I hope that you like this, this is one of my favorites chapters, I quite enjoyed writing it. BTW, thank you so much to all the lovely people that have been leaving comments, it truly means a lot to me and makes me even more eager to post this story.
He caresses Jack's head. Glad that he is interested. "Louise and Henry."
Castiel is not even halfway to the stairs when Dean scrambles to follow him. Eager to get whatever Castiel is willing to give him, not even caring that the people on the basement are looking at him.
She wants Dean to move with them. Dean refuses, he says that America is his home, but really, he just wants Castiel. As soon as Mary leaves the house on the taxi for the airport Castiel fucks Dean against the window, no longer scared of being interrupted and desperate enough that they don't make it to the bedroom.  Dean moves permanently to the master bedroom and pretends that he moved to a new apartment, away from Castiel.
Castiel sighs. The kids better not tell their siblings or he will have at least another two Nephilim trying to meet the hatchlings tonight.
He keeps his punishing pace, sliding in and out of Dean in quick movements, Castiel uses his angelic strength to pin Dean’s hips to the pillow. He is strictly forbidden to seek release or pleasure from anything or anyone that isn’t Castiel. Right now he doesn’t have permission to come on friction from the pillow, he will find release only on his cock.
Castiel takes his leaking cock, sinking into Dean in one skilled move, starting a punishing pace, not giving Dean any time to get used to the sensation. Before long Dean is moaning, and whimpering with each thrust that Castiel slams into him.
Right now, Castiel could not have it better, Dean happily accepts everything the angel is giving him, only moving to allow Castiel to use him as he pleases. The angel feeds Dean from the crystal glass. He is careful to give him small sips to his open and panting lips, slowing down his rhythm to give him more oil, and then changing back to rocking into him. It takes a little while to find the perfect point between fucking him to feeding him all night long.
The fucking weirdo looks at him with his damn sad blue eyes, like if he was denying him seeing his children or something.
He only invited her, because he heard she was in doing some business in America. It turned out she was in Peru, still, she accepted to come and say hi, it is good to stay in his good graces.
Castiel stands in front of him, covering up the tv. Great.
"I know you do. But you are not a doctor and Marina does not know you. You would be of more help if you go with Eileen and help her with the Nephilim." He gets to the room and turns to look at Dean one last time before going inside. "They tend to get fuzzy and nervous when a baby is born. I would appreciate it if you were there for them. Especially because these are twins."
She does not even like Castiel's wing oil, so that is not a viable option to keep her relaxed, and talking about her father only makes her mad, once she threw a lamp at him. It was an expensive antique object, he got it in France eight years ago. He did not have as much grace available as he has now and could not repair it, it was a tragedy.
This is his favorite part, having his partners filled with his length, unable to feel anything but pleasure from him and only him, shoving and pushing their hips at him to get him deeper.
“He should come only with a knot, right?”
He signals for her to walk with him back to the entrance. She follows him like a puppy follows his master. Such a great pet and bondmaid, she is already dressed in the pink sweater that he gave her and jeans; ready to start the day.
“Why would you do that?” Claire is not the kind of girl who would risk herself and her siblings like that. She knows that she should not speak to strangers or open the door to anyone that is not him or the nannies. It does not make sense.
Right now it is not the time for foreplay and making everything slow. He is busy. Without much care about the clothes, he undoes his trousers and lowers her jeans. She steps out of them as Castiel lifts her and rests her against the salmon column.  Renee automatically wraps her legs around him and moans as he takes his hard member in hand and caresses her entrance with his dick’s head.
Castiel smiles, clearly proud, and Dean can't help smiling back even if this feels weird. How is that thing this adorable?
I hope you enjoy this.
He wants to take his time opening himself up, starting with just one finger, fucking himself with care, not even searching for his prostate, yet.
The wings got badly damaged when he fell, especially from all those years that he was cut from heaven, but with the help from all those people that feed him, they are almost as grand as before. Is not the same, he hopes one day he will forget how breathtaking they were before the fall. Perhaps they will regain their former glory when he mates with Dean.
Eileen is distressed with keeping Claire and Emma, who is holding Alexander behind her. Castiel knows that Eileen is a good and loyal babysitter; he is not mad, Dean could fool anyone to get what he wants, that is one of the reasons that Castiel fell for him, he would do anything to protect his loved ones.
Dean looks at him furrowing his brow, he takes a deep breath and looks at himself. Castiel can feel his surprise even without touching him. Without being held by the angel, Dean slumps on the floor, unable to react to their activities. Castiel gets down to his level and picks him up bridal style with care. Dean just grunts a little bit and gets a hold of his shoulder so he does not fall.
Tonight Castiel has a plan, he will not send Dean to a deep sleep, just unconscious enough to be manhandled, and still feel limp, but responsive to any position that Castiel wants. The young man will be blissed out on the Angel’s drug, it will be almost the same as the previous lovemaking they have had, just this time when all is said and done, and the sun breaks in the morning, the hunter will feel like what happened this night was a dream or a vivid fantasy.  He will fully remember it, and Dean is going to finally have a memory instead of pleasurable, but sad sore muscles and love bites.
Fucking him with deep and quick movements, thrusting into him in that silky heat that feels like home. Dean is his, finally his. Tomorrow morning he will get him an expensive, shiny and unique engagement ring, now everyone will also see who he belongs to.
"My wings" Castiel smiles, kissing just below Dean's right ear, holding him in place.
“We gave him enough water and food. He was clingy and bitchy, but nothing special.”  Grunts Mr. Winchester on the other side of the curtain. “Although he tried to escape from his room once and we had to tie him to his bed. My poor wife, Mary had to calm the brat down.”
She nods as a squeal of joy is heard behind them. Anna runs to him with Daniel behind her, it isn’t new having them excited to see him after he leaves for a full night, yet it still makes Castiel smile. Little Anna and Daniel are not as feisty as their older sister, but they love Castiel as much. She runs and clings to him, Daniel gives him a hug.
He slept with a monster man, a male manly monster or whatever and he liked it.
This time, the first thing that he does as soon as he lands in the room, Castiel makes sure that he is alone in the room. There is not anybody on or under the bed, in the bathroom, or hiding in the closet, the parking lot is empty. Good.
"Did you mean it? You really want me?"
She will never be Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
With all of the events on this week Castiel cannot help but think that maybe Dean would be a great mate, they clearly have a bond, a profound one; it would reflect in a lovely relationship and great co-parenting to his offspring. He knows it is worth it now that he has seen how different he feels about Dean, he has never met anyone as bright and caring as Dean Winchester.
The last appointment of the day is Dean Winchester. His appointment information on the clinic, mentions that his family doesn't wish to sell him off. They want to pair him off to a rich family and they need to make sure that the bitch is going to be good to his future husband. Meg, his assistant knocks at the door and lets Dean and his father in the room. She goes outside without a word, he can still see her smirk. She knows that the bitch they brought to him is his type.
He studied the Winchester family for a week, without resting at any point of the day. The mother, Mary loved both of her children very much. The kids were happy, and John cared for them. Deep down Castiel knew that it was wrong to destroy a family. Especially one that seemed to love each other this much.
That's enough for Castiel. He lets go of Dean and gets on his knees and opens their pants. Takes his lover's dick in his right hand and engulfs his length in one motion, bobbing his head, up and down sucking Dean while jacking himself off.
Dean has never felt this kind of pleasure, he has never moaned like this. How did he never talked to Castiel before?
Almost all of the fledglings are running, and playing in the garden; happy, and carefree while Castiel watches them. He is sitting in an area that he designed to be able to rest comfortably with the babies and toddlers by his side, safe to play in a clean environment until they are able to go and frolic with their older siblings.
Castiel shushes him and walks to the couch that he has in his office. In times like this, he is grateful that he listened to the interior designer when he commented on the idea of having a big couch there. Both of them fit decently in the brown piece of furniture.
He loves it, he does not deny Castiel anything, and if Castiel is doing his job right, by tomorrow Dean will officially be his. He just needs to keep showing him everything that Castiel has to offer.
"C'mon, fuck me like you mean it, Cas." He gasps, pulling the Angel closer. "Harder angel, I won't break."
The angel cannot help to go and hold Dean, hugging him from behind and resting his head on his shoulder. It feels like finding a new home, not only because Dean is the missing sword of Michael, it is because he is the blinding light that makes everything worth living and humanity mean something on this endless void of earth.
It's one thing to fuck Dean asleep, but to see him come undone and willingly take what Castiel offers, it feels enough. It was worth leaving heaven for this.
Before he does literally anything else, he sends the pair of humans in the room to a deep sleep that should last until morning. The fallen angel starts the process that he did the last time he was here: getting rid of his excessive clothing, laying Dean in the correct position, loosening and lubing him up, etcetera.
It was like coming back to life after being trapped in a cage two sizes too small, he felt the rapidly diminished power of her soul when he used her to protect them.
"Fine. Just be quick and please do not wake them up. They need to rest. Remember that hatchlings sleep most of the day."
It seems that he fell in a relationship with a man that already has children and a white picket fence in the matter of what? Two days? He isn't even sure right now. Everything is moving too fast and is way too confusing for him to just take in on one night's sleep.
"I knew you would be a begging bitch." Says Castiel. Dean tenses at the same time that his stepfather flips him on the lounger, now resting on his back. He can watch the sky, but Castiel bends him in half, roughly. All he can see is Castiel.
Marina is perfectly healthy and content, she just needs to rest for the night. Castiel already healed and reverted everything on her body. Now her body is just as before she got pregnant, even healthier with Castiel's grace. Still, giving birth is an extenuating task and she deserves to rest for a full night.
He holds Dean’s face, marveled at the freckled and blushed cheeks. Now the young man’s lips and face covered on pre come and oil as he selfishly sucks on the seraph’s cock. Even asleep he is so eager and vocal, so responsive.
"I'm Dean"
“I can feel the longing, lust, and attraction that is directed towards me,” Castiel whispers to his ear. Lightly biting it, he shivers with fear not want. That would be fucked up. “And you have not stopped wanting me since we met.”
He mostly keeps women around as his bondmaids, for they are able to carry his offspring. Usually, they don’t last more than a year. He sends them away with a wiped memory of anything that’s is related to him, and a generous monetary gain. This way they don’t pine after him, and he can move on with his life and his new baby, he is not a heartless monster after all.
It was dangerous for him to be without a vessel, he was too vulnerable but at least he would not feel physical pain. It would be too much added to the torture that was for his grace to be away from heaven and unable to feel his kind. He was going mad on pain and solitude.
"Sorry about that. They cornered me when I was leaving the nursery. I kind of wanted them to like me."
Dean hugs him tighter. Longing is coming out of him in waves, desperate for him and yet terrified to be abandoned again.
It is not like he doesn’t trust Veronica, the night shift babysitter, and the housekeeper to keep everyone safe and sound; however, since the last babysitter he hired is now with child, things got even more hectic than before. Now he just has two nannies, for two eight-hour shifts. He needs a third. If only he could find a nanny that doesn’t bed him, things could go back to normal.
That smells great, but, who the fuck needs three doors for one room? This man really likes expensive things and to show off that he is rich. He is wearing a fucking embroidered silk robe over his clothes, for fuck sake!
What if he is using his powers to control him, Dean saw all he did to him. Castiel never asked, he just decided to fuck Dean and fuck it should anger him but it's just making him horny. He needs to leave now.
“Right.” She goes and sits on Claire’s lap, smiling at Castiel, eager for attention. Claire hugs her and helps her with getting comfortable.
Dean lowers himself to the children's height. He settles to talk to the closest kid to him. "Hi, I'm Dean. What's your name, buddy?"
"They're great." Dean touches Henry's left hand, the baby takes one of Dean's fingers and doesn't let go.
The fucker still has the nerve to look desperate, and worried. Like if he was the victim. Fuck him.
"What are you doing, man?" He complains. "Where are you taking me?"
The seraph sends Eileen a text to let the Nephilim out of the room when dinner is ready, and to immediately send them to bed. He will not join them tonight, he has a date with Dean. Some of the children may be upset at him for missing one of the daily occasions where he can spend time with all of them without being interrupted, still, he does not feel guilty, since is rare for him to skip their quality time together. He hopes they understand, they are smart children.
Dean is standing in the middle of the room. Clearly confused, maybe shocked.  Castiel walks to him, holds him by the neck, and kisses him. Demanding and dominant, he shoves his tongue on the boy’s mouth and hears his breath hitch. He is going to breed him until he screams.
Yet Castiel is already undoing both of their pants and has Dean's dick in his hand. Oh God. Castiel takes him and spins him, now looking at the wall, he gets pushed and crushed under Cas weight as he licks and kisses at his neck.
His new pet.
His powers really come in handy in times like this.
It read: Gone hunting a Wendigo, left some cases for you on the table.
Even if Castiel is busy undoing Dean's pants and keeping them busy with pleasure, he knows that Dean is listening to his every word. Deciding if he believes the angel or not. Dean sighs and hauls him up, kissing him deeply again.
Slowly, oh so slowly, Castiel takes his cock in hand and places it at Dean’s entrance, pushing it to go past the still tight rim. It takes a big deal of self-control to not slam and fuck hard into Dean as soon as he feels the warm and silky thingness. He is an angel, he can handle himself. He is capable to take his time. Finally, he has found someone who can feed him, and he will never let go.
They watch them go and Castiel takes Dean's hand, taking them back inside the house to sit on a plush couch by the fireplace on the entrance hall.
He was clearly distracted to not notice the woman waking up in the middle of his lovemaking, also he did not perceive the wave of arousal that she is sending toward him. He really must have been oven eager to touch Dean that he did not put her to sleep correctly. He needs to be more careful next time.
Castiel cannot help but smile. Finally having Dean in his arms after weeks of planning and waiting, at last, he is here of his own volition it is even better than anything he could have imagined. Just by having Dean near him, sharing space in his home feels like a real-life miracle. He watches him sleep.
The hunter opens the vial and smells it. It is a thick sweet-smelling blue liquid. Shining lilac spirals are moving in it.
“Dean shut up!” Screams John. “Your mom is in the early stages, she can get better now. Do you want your mother to die?”
"Of course. I would never lie to you, Dean." He lowers his forehead to Dean's, gently resting against him. "If you accept me, you would be my mate and also a father of all my children for the rest of our lives."
Of course, he skips the bondmaid chambers, and especially the resting room where Renee, Lauren, and Kelly now permanently stay blissed out on Castiel's oil. Kelly just got with a child this morning while Dean was sleeping.
It is his fault, he was way too trusting of Dean. At least when his children are included he does not take risks. Still, he knows that with literally anyone else he would not let them get this near with his guard down. He needs to be more careful around the hunter, at least until he has Dean’s heart. Nevertheless, even if he tried to hurt him is still Dean. Still beautiful.
That luby thing that smells and tastes wonderful makes it even better. Where did he even get the lube from? It doesn't matter, all thoughts that aren't Castiel stop when the angel starts to bounce on Dean's dick. He gets a hold of the headboard to have better control of his movements, changing his speed between quick and hard movements to a slow grind, rotating his hips in small circles.
Now they are comfortable sleeping in the nursery next to Castiel's room. He likes to keep the Nephilim there for their first month or two and feed them by himself at night. No nannies. Just Castiel bonding with the hatchlings, as any father should.
Both Michael and Raphael had called him that day to their office. He knew it was important, but he had no idea the magnitude of change this mission would have over the universe and all humans on earth.
Maybe is a thief who saw Dean naked next to the pool, or one of Castiel's friends who came to visit and decided that Dean was what they wanted. Maybe one of John's old friends came asking for his dad. It's not the first time that they have come asking for money that John owes them. Perhaps the neighbor saw him from the window and decided to show Dean how a real dick feels.
The girls quickly run to the cribs, while Jack pulls Dean's hand and brings him into the room, eager to see them. He lets go of him to be able to see his new siblings.
Castiel leans forward, just breathing Dean's air and holding his cheek, almost unconsciously Dean closes his eyes and gets as near Castiel as possible. "No, we will have offspring until the earth wilts away. Then the Nephilim will inherit its remains and we will use our combined grace to rebuild it for us and the survivors."
He feels weird when she comes and it's not Dean's throaty gasp that he hears.
"Even if I say no to getting knocked up you would still want me?" Dean cries, urgency in his voice.
Everything feels like a vivid dream with how great is this house. Warm, nice, shiny, and probably real. It doesn’t feel like a djinn hallucination or a trick.
“It would have been interesting, to seduce you. To take my time, but I’m quite busy right now. Castiel’s movements start to get erratic, losing his pace at Dean’s hoarse whimpers and desperate movements to take him deeper. “But look at you I felt how much you wanted me, even asleep, you… your body is begging for me.”
“That’s a relief. I was worried he would act bratty again and refuse whoever got him.”
Castiel tilts his head. “But, you wanted this. You still do.”
He is such a slut for Castiel, moaning with the taste of his oil and his mouth being filled to the point that he can barely breathe. Not only not complaining, on the contrary, gladly taking Castiel’s cock down his throat as much as the angel wants to give it to him.
Anyway, enjoy.
Sometimes Castiel misses her, Amelia has always been the favorite of the biological mothers of all of his younglings. She was a friend, not a pet or a bondmaid.
It was a miracle. Now he had a way to survive on earth without hurting the humans like his passed away brother. The souls would heal him and bring him enough energy to use some powers, with time he would be himself again.
It has only been two weeks since he last visited Dean, too much time if you asked Castiel. Especially because tonight Dean has a woman accompanying him. They are both laying on the motel bed, half covered with the cheap, and dirty sheets that the motel provides. They are already asleep, barely touching. That does not make it better, clearly, they had intercourse.
At the same time that he shows him, Castiel touches Dean's soul and mind just enough to help him to accept what Castiel is. It is intricate and complicated. The human mind is complex and always changing. With extreme care and precision, Castiel inserts a couple of ideas between memories and bends a little bit to the left some thoughts. Just enough for Dean to not suspect his change of heart on the existence of Castiel's race. He has to.
The owner of this glorious cock starts to fuck him hard and fast going for his prostate in almost every thrust. The man is big, covering almost all of Dean, and is strong, with every trust Dean has to hold on to the chair. Right now he doesn't even care who's the owner of this cock. He just wants to keep being fucked until he screams from pleasure.
He also introduces baby Eliza to him. Who just turned one last month. When he calls Dean his boyfriend in front of the children Dean blushes and lowers Marie to the ground.
He keeps on sucking Castiel’s fingers.
He is unique.
There are a hundred and more reasons why Dean should take his things and leave while he can, while his mind is sharp; yet he doesn't want to.
He looks back at his cell phone, Castiel is barely able to see a picture of John hugging a blonde woman. Both of them smiling.
Two chapters in the same week since this is shorter than usual and the last one didn't have any Dean on it. I'm working on a new personal project that is going to be taking a lot of my time, so I'll be trying to post this as soon as possible, don't worry about me leaving the story, this is already written and I just need to edit it before posting, so even if I was busy 24/7 I would just post it with some typos.
The rest of the girls are going on with their activities in there. Chastity is still angry there, Angelica and Marina became good friends, and like to spend a lot of time together now that the other girls are Castiel's permanent bondmaids.
He sits on the patio chairs next to the infants just as the last of the guests arrive. He greets all of them, trying to avoid boring conversations as much as possible.
When she smiles at him like that, timid but curious, she looks so much like Amelia; lately, she doesn’t do that anymore, still, in times like this she looks so much like her mother.
He had saved the world.
Castiel can’t help himself, he starts to move the vibrator to the young man’s prostate, just to hear him yelp. Virgins always make the best sounds. He is starting to get hard just looking at him. The Alpha lazily uses the vibrator to fuck Dean at a slow pace, just enjoying the sounds that the boy makes. He inserts it as deep as it goes and Dean whines, biting his arm to keep silent.
Crap. Castiel.
Today is different, right now he is planning in high detail on how to approach a conscious Dean, and convince him to stay and mate with him, and it is easier say than done. Most of Castiel’s ideas are not realistic, or sadly they have too many variables to be considered seriously.
Most of Castiel’s pets only last him half a year; they usually don’t satisfy him for a long time, and soon enough he starts to go hungry, even if he still feeds of them. He leaves them, going to find the next shiny warm soul and body. Still, if he takes his time to get to know them, some of them entertain him enough to keep them around for a while longer.
OMG, I can't believe I finally finished it! I hope that you enjoyed it, please leave a comment telling me what you thought of it if you want ♡
Dean cannot give him offspring, unless…
He could repeat this and feed the oil to the hunter all night long, but it would take way too much time, that he does not have. Castiel is content with how much the hunter has fed on oil, he is relaxed enough that now he can just give it to him as a drink and Dean would take it without a fuzz. Castiel sits on the side of the bed, feet on the floor, and carries Dean to sit on his lap. He is adorable and gorgeous, but not light, luckily Castiel is strong and is able to carry a full grown man with no problem.
He comes in Dean, still fucking into him. This time slow and sensual, giving him more time to get hard again. Impaling the hunter on his cock, dragging himself out and languidly sliding back in, all the while pressing Dean's prostate.
There is bubbling in his chest, Castiel has never felt giddy with emotion, and it is odd. Dean is an attractive man, there is not any doubt about that, the last time they slept together it was pleasurable, and full filling for his hunger, but that is not it. It does not have anything to do with how tight his ass is or how good he is at sucking cock. It is about how special is Dean as an individual. How charming.
Sam was still fighting off the Wendigo, there was no chance that Dean would get to a hospital on time...no chance he would survive.
Then it was all over.
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel responded almost immediately.
Castiel nodded. "I trust you Dean, you know I do."
“Hopefully none.” Castiel sighed. “My aunt is already gonna be pissed when she finds out about my detention.”
"Yeah." He says pushing past him and going to his room.
Chuck stomped on his leg and broke it, he yelled in pain. But Sam helped him up this time, he looked in the distance and the sight made him smile, Sam also saw this and began to smile.
"Y-you know t-this Dean." Castiel could barely form a sentence and this was only the beginning. But he had obeyed Dean's instruction and kept his hands above his head, although it was getting increasingly hard.
Castiel gasped below him and thrust his hips. Dean hooks his thumbs in the waistband of Castiel's boxers and slowly brings them down.
Then it happened, Dean was gone.
There is no way that he was coming out of the closet, not until he was far far away. He wanted to hold onto the last few months of normality he had left in the little town of Stone Hill.
"Marry me."
They got to the room and Sam grimaced at the interior, it smelt like mold and cleaning detergent. "Com'on Sammy, don't make that face we've been in worse places." Dean patted the bed twice. "I'm pretty sure dust just came out of that comforter in the shape of a skull." He responded.
"I didn't mean it like that Cas, I mean we just got you back I can't loose you again." He struggled to find the right words. "You think I'm going to leave you again? You think that when I saw you and Sam again it wasn't the happiest moment of my existence after spending months in the empty?" He growled. "Especially you Dean, you should know...especially you."
There they stood, Michael the archangel, Lucifer’s son and two brothers against God. It took place in a field, of course it did, a big open field.
He pulled down Castiel's black trousers and tossed them to the floor. "I'm gonna take care of you Cas, make you feel so good. Do you trust me?"
"I'm leAving."
Castiel and Dean followed the gang leader outside. "Ask away, I'll tell you what I know and then we are done got it?" Castiel nodded. "We understand." It was the first thing he had said since they entered the bar.
Castiel brimmed with emotion. “Thank you, Dean.” He said tracing his name with his finger.
Castiel backed away till he felt the wall. "I made a deal. My life for his, the catch was the Empty wanted me to suffer, it would only take me away when I was truly happy and since there was no way that was happening I took a calculated risk."
They both stared at each other intensely.
“But let’s make it fair.” He snapped his fingers and the ground started rumbling. Hands burst through the dew-soaked soil and gruesome rotting, skin and bone creatures pulled themselves through, growling and snarling like rabid animals, hundreds and thousands of them.
Castiel melted at the words, he felt like he could be himself around Green. Even after a few messages.
this is not the end
He cried out from the sudden change of pace and when Dean changed the angle and nailed his prostate he thought he would die.
Steve offered to walk Dean back to his car because he felt sorry for the poor dude. "Wow." He whistled. "Sweet ride."
Castiel dropped his duffel in surprise at first he moved his arms in a confused manner, his eyes wide with shock.
"Fuck, Sam I gotta go talk to him." Dean sped off to Cas' room.
Dean had seen that they were having a conversation and couldn’t help but feel jealousy so he turned around to go find Sam who was talking to Gabriel.
Dean was running out of energy and it looked like everyone else was too. He had to do something.
A wave of dread past through him. "I understand that I am no longer needed so I will leave the bunker as possible."
Castiel sped walked after him.
Dean exited the back of the car leaving Cas to still regain consciousness.
Dean sighed in annoyance, got off Castiel, winked and left his wrecked angel high and dry on the bed while he clutched at the bedsheets in sexual frustration.
Dean stopped his ministrations to reach over to his desk drawer and fumble about for lubrication. Aha! Got you.
Seven hours drive later, two cars pull into the empty Nightspring Motel parking lot. They split between four rooms— Sam and Dean together, Cas and Jack together, mom and dad both in singles.
They stay quiet for the phone call, not wanting to tip whoever is on the end of the line off on the fact that ‘Agent Jepsen’ is out with a few more people than just his partner. Cas nods through the phone call, and says ‘We will be there as soon as possible’ before hanging up.
“So, where were you when the incident happened?” Sam asks.
All eyes turn to them as they walk back into the room— well, except Jack’s, he seems distracted by the activity book he and Cas had lifted from whatever frozen yoghurt place they’d somehow found, but he catches on quickly and then he’s looking as well. Sam’s gaze is a mix between curiosity and concern, mom is looking between him and dad with the same analytical expression she’s taken to lately, and Cas is looking over Dean in a way the same way he does after they’ve just had a particularly brutal fight with some monster.
“You complaining?” A bitter voice slithers in the dark of his mind, telling him Sammy certainly hadn’t seemed to mind just half an hour ago.
changed, Dean.”
too but I can’t bring myself to feel anything but relief that the people who were hurting you and Henrietta are gone now. But...look what you doing all this alone has led us to. You killed them, and now there are people in my home threatening to kill
Amy regards him coldly. “What else was I supposed to do? Just let myself and my family just keep getting hurt? My friends, my brother, they’re all I had for
“It’s not just that, Dean. You know it’s not just that.”
It’s the type of house they’ve visited a million times— Two story, pale blue paint, gabled roof, literal white picket fence enclosing a manicured lawn. They all start to blend together, only standing out by virtue of being a place they can visit but never stay.
Lies run in the family.
“Don’t.” Dean cuts him off. Judging by John’s look, he wasn’t expecting that. In truth, Dean isn’t sure he was either. There’s a part of him that wants to apologise, but he remembers
He tells you “I love you.”
of food— thank you, Charlie and your unlimited magic credit cards.
Shouldn’t Dean be able to breathe now? Shouldn’t he be able to stop choking on his father’s expectations?
it [he doesn’t, no one does, not even Sammy].
Dad’s face lights up when he sees Baby again, praising that Dean has kept her going all these years, and that allows some of the tension to leak from his shoulders as he makes the drive into town.
He stops for another cup of coffee between his talk with Cas and the next part of his not-quite-a-plan. It kind of feels like a waste of time, but he also needs a breather, even if he has to keep one eye on the front door as he does it. Everything he keeps locked in boxes at the back of his mind is pushing against the lids, fighting its way out, wanting to fit into place with his current thoughts. He knows where this is going, he’s pretty sure, even as he holds out the picture is already starting to form, it’s just not whole yet, a couple of parts still missing.
No cold spots. No smell of sulfur. No enemies, except maybe Grace Hollowitz who has held a petty grudge ever since Lydia called her out for bringing store bought muffins to the PTA bake sale.
“How do I know it’s really you?” John grunts.
They argue a bit [a lot] about how to best approach it. Dean thinks they should stick with the FBI route— it’s tried and trusted. Sam points out that already nearly got them caught with Caleb, goddamn stupid small towns. Dad just wants to stake out the place, not get involved, and Dean remembers with a start just how different hunts with dad were to the system he’s fallen into with Sam. A lot of alternative forms of identity fraud are thrown around— insurance, journalism, priests. Eventually, mom’s the one who hits the jackpot, suggesting they simply pretend to be new neighbors getting to know the area.
“Of course it is.” He coaches his body into something normal, casual. Doesn’t lean in. Doesn’t stare into Cas’ eyes. “It’s a great idea. Kill some evil sons of bitches, drink a few warm brewskies in crappy motel rooms, bond.”
This question is directed at Dean, but Sam swoops in and answers.
“I’m sure dad knew what he was doing,” Dean defends automatically, but that’s not really a fight he wants to get into right now, so he turns back to Jack. “So, wanna tell me more about what was going on in that head of yours?”
Dean doesn’t realise he’s sat down on the bed until he feels the weight of mom sitting next to him. He’s still looking at the journal, remembering how hard it was reading it for the first time, wondering if it would be better or worse for someone who hadn’t lived it.
Dean grunts in response, beelining for the coffee machine. Thankfully, there’s already a fresh pot waiting. Either Sam is already up and out for one of his (disgusting) early morning runs, or Jack is finally getting a hang of not burning the kitchen down during simple tasks. He pours himself a mug and chugs half of it, topping it up before sitting across from Jack.
“That’s right, angel. It’s better for you to die like this. You get to die with my hand in your hair, the taste of me on your tongue. I promise I’ll make it good for you, sweetheart. I’ll even hold you after.”
Cas takes a deep breath, staring into Dean’s eyes. That’s right. He wants to die like this, he wants Dean to be the last thing he sees, tastes, hears, touches.
Dean fights down the automatic ‘dad was doing his best’ that tries to leave his throat. That’s not what this is about.
What’s his excuse now?
“Yeah.” Sam nods. “Uh, few years ago now.”
“So—” Dean starts, but Jack cuts him off.
with him?”
Sam chuckles ruefully under his breath. “Yeah, cause that always worked for me and dad.”
But it’s best not to poke any holes in your cover when you can avoid it, and a sudden third FBI agent does tend to give pause, even if their made up in the moment explanation does tend to be accepted at face value, better not to risk it.
The honesty you were too shocked to speak when you needed to.
Dad’s not a wisecracker, never was, never could be. His face and voice are both cold when he says “My gun would beg to differ.”
“And Lydia...spontaneously combusted,” Sam finishes his recap.
Finally, It’s mom who speaks.
know any of that.
“Cas should have never told you that,” he bites.
[He often dreams of dad.]
Dean starts, because half the people in this room wouldn’t know how to kick back and relax if it bit them on the ass.
Dad gazes back, analytical, before grunting. “You friends of my boys?”
’ echo in Dean’s head. He realises, with little fanfare, that he’s been waiting for this inevitable moment since the moment he first saw his dad in the bunker.

“I practice wicca, that’s all,” the kid admits. “Little things, herbs for protection, a spell or two on the new moon. I just...wanted to show her something that could
The question catches Dean off guard. “What?”
In the moment your fury is righteous (the righteous man broke the first seal in hell)([the righteous man breaks, breaks, breaks) (they tell you the righteous man’s creator does not break, but that is a lie too, he broke much sooner, but he was not a righteous man.)
Cas keeps drying for a moment, formulating a response, and what exactly is he going to say, because honestly, Dean doesn’t get why he’s acting this way.
Dean straightens up. That isn’t what he’d meant. He’d meant
“No, it’s better,” Sam says from his other side. “The way you raised us was crappy.”
, not
It’s such a weight off his chest that even the wounded, guilty expression that flashes across John’s face can’t make him feel bad for it.
It often takes a while for Dean’s brain to switch from sleep to reality when he first wakes up. He’s already sitting up in bed when the events of yesterday hit him full force and he remembers
“Actually,” Sam starts, and Dean groans. “I figured me and you could handle the interview.”
“Miss. So, what’s this possible plan you’re thinking of? H7.”
“Yeah? Well, family don’t end in—”
No one knows what to say to that. John runs a hand down to his face.
“I know.” Jack slurps the remaining milk out of his bowl.
“And you?” Caleb turns to Dean.
“She wasn’t a monster!” Sam shoots back. Suddenly, Dean sees an eighteen year old spitfire in place of his fully grown brother, years younger and never afraid to stand up to dad. Even with the years that have passed, Sam holds himself the same as he stands up for what he believes in. “She was a
Sam scrolls through it as he talks. “So, it turns out Henrietta is best friends with the sister Caleb mentioned, Amy.” At this, he clicks on an image of Henrietta and a blonde girl with purple tips, blue eyes and a shredded punk t-shirt— the two of them don’t look like they fit together at all, but clearly they’re close.
Dad takes shotgun in the Impala on the drive back. He rifles through all the tapes in the glove compartment, reminiscing about the ones Dean’s kept and inquiring about all the different labelled mixtapes he’s put together.
“Well, you know more about angels than I do, so I’ll take you at your word on that for now. Show me some of those books later, though, alright son?”
“How else can it be?” Cas asks softly, asks like he’s actually
“Well, the men of letters weren’t really hunters,” Dean says, because it’s the first thing that comes to mind to throw the conversation off its current track. “They were, uh, bookish types...left the ganking to whoever they trusted enough to pass their intel to.”
, his dead father, and somehow it feels even stranger that the time he found his mom in the woods, wearing the white nightgown she died in.
Dean almost has an out of body experience when his father asks if they can have a word alone.
“I’ll get the silver,” Dean says automatically.
“Don’t act cute with us,” Dean says, hand hovering over the gun hidden at his waist.
that even if he still makes jokes like that, now
He can see Cas’ small, melancholy smile out of the corner of his eye. “Don’t forget your move.”
“John,” mom says sharply. “They’ve got this, trust me. And...maybe we could get another chance to talk? If it’s just the two of us out there?”
Well, ain’t that fucking frustrating.
“Fuck,” Dean whispers under his breath.
blushing. “E1?”
The Dean in his head is sucking on the skin now, worrying his teeth at the junction of Cas’ neck.
You are a soldier. An avenger. A protector. Not a good enough protector. A perfect son. A blunt instrument. The echo of your mother. The echo of your father. A big brother. A mother. A father. You have a father who loves you. You have a commander who controls you. You have a god and all you can do is follow his orders because what are you without them. You have a brother who loves you. A brother who leaves. A brother who dies for you. A brother who doesn’t look for you when you die.
He watches Jack’s face fall in realtime. “If I hurt someone again?”
“Yeah, I’m good.” He says, making his distaste for smoothies clear in his tone. “So, what do you mean by Amy
, the heat in his belly like fire. He hasn’t even made the conscious choice to give in before he’s palming himself from over his jeans, a desperate attempt to alleviate the pressure.
“Maybe a hammock,” he says out loud.
He sees it happen in slow motion. Cas’ hand starts to move, lift, a familiar gesture. Dean should— but he’s frozen— and— and Castiel’s hand lands on Dean’s shoulder.
“Mom,” Sam starts. “Could you...take dad and go check on Maria’s family? Make sure they get a motel for the night and aren’t losing their minds? We can handle things here.”
Dean processes these words like they’re sinking through molasses, and when they finally hit that part of his brain that has a few cells left, he jumps into action with a smirk.
“Hey, kid,” Dean says, before he can overthink it. “We’ll take you fishing anytime you want, okay? I had a great time last time me and you went, and it will be even better this time, what with no one dying and all.”
the same people dad raised, and this isn’t the mom he thinks he remembers, and Cas and Jack aren’t even human and as far as dad’s concerned that’s enough of a reason not to like them.”
John Winchester shuffles back to the bunker sometime in the middle of the afternoon, wearing yesterday’s rumpled clothes and smelling of cheap whiskey. The second he comes through the door, Dean can feel the resolve he spent hours building up already starting to crumble. Thankfully, he has two people on either side of him to help him hold it up.
“I was a hunter long before you had
Jack seems to have tensed the strange air in the room, a confused frown working its way onto his face.
“I knew I raised you boys right,” he eventually says. “Your mother...she can finally rest in peace.”
boys, and this is between me and
. She screwed up, badly, but she’s harmless now.”
“So, John is your father? The same one you’ve told me about? Who’s dead? But now he’s here, because of time travel?” Jack asks.
need to gank this witch.
He starts with mom, because she’s the hardest to talk to, which makes her the easiest, because she’s hard to talk to in a way that Dean understands, in the way that he is.
“Miss. Fathers are complicated, Dean. When I found Chuck, found out who he really was, I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to feel. He’s my father. I spent my life in devotion to him, I searched for him everywhere, I prayed to him more times that I can count. He never showed, and I thought I’d accepted he just didn’t care, and I didn’t need him anymore. But when he was here, there were times when all those feelings from before came rushing back. But I was right, before— I should be happy with the family who cares for me, rather than chasing something Chuck never gave to me. C5.”
A sanitised and clipped truth it is, then.
“Sam, Dean, I’m back,” Mary calls, her footsteps steadily treading down the stairs.
“I’m happy here. But I’m not sure if anyone else is, and I’m not happy if you aren’t.”
“I—” Maria starts. “I don’t like what she did. Amy, you...shouldn’t have...why did you think it had to come to this?”
Like her strings have been cut, Amy’s whole body loses any fight bar the guarded look in her eyes, and Sam gets her tied to a wooden chair mom must have dragged in from the dining room.
Not really thinking, running on pure instinct, Dean throws himself between the people and the gun.
He’s been mulling over it all day, and he’s pretty sure this is the solution. The reason things are so strange and disjointed and no one is quite getting along or being themselves is because they don’t know how to— not like this. They’re hunters, all of them. They don’t know what to do with themselves lounging around the bunker. Sure...when dad got back, Dean had thought maybe...but no, clearly they need a case. And that’s not so bad, right? Maybe it’s not perfect, but they can work a case and then gather round the table for dinner— best of both worlds.
“You’re mad at me.” Amy chuckles bitterly. “I did this for you. I did it for our family.”
He tells you “You're the most caring man on earth.”
“What do you mean ‘yes and no’?” Dean asks, sharp— too sharp, but he needs this break in the case. “Either it was or it wasn’t.”
Cas spots it first, by virtue of his eyes never leaving the window. At first, he just seems like any other passerby, but there’s something determined in the gait, something that raises alarm bells if you know what you’re looking for.
“Hey,” Dean cuts in quickly. “Look, dad was mad at me all the time growing up. Me and Sammy. That’s just...who he is. It doesn’t mean you did anything wrong, okay? Not really. I mean, maybe you didn’t do what he would’ve wanted you to. But, that doesn’t make it wrong, not necessarily.”
The waitress comes to take their order and Dean orders two eggs with a side of extra bacon. Dad raises a conspitaral eyebrow at him as she walks away.
Sam nods. “We really haven’t gotten much here. Hopefully the daughter knows something.”
“You can be on stirring duty, come on.” He stands, and holds his hand out to Cas to help him down from the table, even though it’s completely unnecessary.
His father has always seemed to loom over him when he’s mad, suddenly so much bigger than Dean could over hope to be. The fury always surrounds his frame, unable to be contained inside. In the past few years, Dean had convinced himself that that’s just how it seemed when he was a scared child, before he’d gotten used to dad and learned how to handle his moods. But Dean sees now that, if anything, he’d been underestimating the past. The anger he’s faced with now is a brimming supernova, a catastrophe begging to be released and destroy anything in a ten mile radius.
“We’re hunters,” Sam starts to explain. “We look for...bad things, unnatural things..things that are hurting people, and we stop them.”
“Oh...uh…” Jesus, he’s
Dean shakes his head ruefully. “Yeah, I guess so.”
Caleb Miller squints at him, apparently unperturbed by the three men surrounding him.
He flounders. How is he meant to answer that? Why is it being asked? Is there a right and wrong answer?
“She was quite the looker, huh?”
By the time he’s finished, he’s standing, breathing heavily. He thinks he can feel tears pricking at the corners of his eyes. He throws his fist into the tree he was leaning against.
of them. Maybe he should have said it differently. The word was self-explanatory to him.
“So what...whatever’s doing this changed it’s MO this time?” Sam questions.
“Look.” He chews his lip. “It’s...it’s not me, I swear.”
“John,” Mary finally says, nothing in her voice except pure shock.
A blanket of silence descends on the kitchen. Dad looks like he doesn’t know what to say, while everyone else is waiting for him to say something, anything. The longer he doesn’t, the more a feeling of discomfort spreads through the room, permeating Dean’s bones.
John’s smile turns wry. “You’re back hunting, Sammy? I thought you were happy playing pretend in your little Stanford fantasy.”
“Not really the important question here,” Dean counters.
“Well, we grew up hunters,” he says, nonchalant.
“I get it, Dean,” Jack cuts him off. “No mention of my powers around your dad. Because he’ll think I’m evil.”
⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢⌢
This is just another space he was never meant to belong in.
Dean cuts him off. “So you
Isn’t mom just kind of like that, though? She was guarded around Sam and Dean at first too, until she got used to them, had time to process the fact that she was alive and it was the future and her sons were now adult hunters. She hadn’t really relaxed until after a few long, strained conversations about everything that made it clear who she was and what she needed and what she could and couldn’t provide.
just need to keep you safe, so can you please just go with this for now?”
“Hey, Caleb,” Sam says, placatingly. He tries to make himself small with his body language, in that way that always seems to work despite his towering status. “We’re not accusing you of anything, but can you explain to us what you’re doing here?”
This is something Castiel had often thought about when his grace first invaded the vessel that belonged to Jimmy Novak. Castiel, in his true form, is as large as the Chrysler building— at least, he thinks that’s about right. The thing about an angel’s true form is that it is malleable, ever-shifting, more idea than solid matter. Whatever he really is, he had felt too big for Jimmy’s skin. He had been constantly straining against the confines of the human body, feeling trapped and compressed into a space he was not made to belong in.
He has to stand on the tip of his feet to be able to see. Dean helps him.
Anyway, I hope that you enjoyed it!
“I’m definitely keeping you, pet. I’m…” He groans bottoming out. “I’m going to visit you every Saturday from now on.”
It’s barely past one am on a chilly Saturday morning. Way too early for Dean to be sleeping, but Dean was so tired and lonely. He’s been feeling more hopeless every day since John left to hunt on his own: Two months ago Dean woke up to a brief text, sent by his father.
“It went quite well. Perhaps… I met someone that you may like to meet at some point.”
Dean is his.
What the hell. He doesn't have anything better to do. His beer is gone. "Sure. Why not?"
"I will never stop wanting you."
His beauty can be found not only in his features but also in his soul. It’s astounding how pure it is, spotless of harm and sin. This one will do him nicely as his new pet; maybe his feedings can keep him satisfied for about three weeks. That would be impressing. It is such a pity that he is asleep and won’t be able to reciprocate, yet this will have to be enough.
He smiles. “Well, sadly we have not had the chance to get to know each other.” Castiel goes for the honest answer. “I love all of my children very much. They are my whole world.”
She accompanies him, talking about other moms in this part of the city, and are her friends on the “Mommy and me yoga club” that she just started, and things that Ben has done. He just gives her enough attention for her to not notice that she is being ignored. Castiel does not care much for her, The Braeden’s moved to this community two years ago, and Castiel has been fucking Lisa since the first day they arrived.
The red marks on his chest and neck look lovely, he will not bother to heal those, it is time that Dean starts to get used to feeling Castiel all day in every way imaginable, after all, relationships require people to get used to new things, and to make sacrifices.
Castiel tilts his head like a damn puppy. He gets up and removes the now empty tray and lays it on a small table in the middle of the room. A table with fresh girly flowers.
He lays down on his bed, willing himself to relax on the comfortable mattress that he rarely uses. The “internet” that his children are always talking about does not help at all, it has some fictional stories with similar dilemmas, though they are just that, stories. Maybe he should start to listen to the capable teachers of the Nephilim like Mrs. Donna always says “He needs to find a new angle to solve a problem.” Just maybe the obvious choice is the good choice. How bad can it go if he goes and introduces himself to Dean?
It’s a good thing that the sperm of the Omegas can be used as an egg for the Alpha stud's sperm to fertilize. They work in the agency giving samples and directly breeding some Omegas. The scientist only has to pick the right eggs for an omega to develop. With Dean’s pedigree, he is going to be able to get back his investment in less than a year. Good omegas are a rarity, but with Dean’s genes, they’re going to be able to create the best and design them for Alphas willing to pay a house or a boat for a good bitch.
Dean nods between pants, desperately moving his hips. Trying to get even more inside of him.
It feels like forever, but finally he is fully inside. Castiel takes a big breath, and he lays himself over Dean, just feeling the hunter and breathing him in. It’s familiar, yet totally new, almost overwhelming, this warm and tight body under him.
“Take it. I know you can take what I give you.”
“On the contrary, he responds positively to any kind of sexual attention put onto him. He seems to be able to take a big sized Knot without tearing or hurting of any kind.”

There’s no point in lamenting, the best time is right now. He has Dean laid bare right now and he will do the best of this situation once he is sure that Dean is ready to take him.
They leave the room and walk in silence for the classrooms on the first floor. He would get nervous for the lack of talking, except that Dean took his hand when they left the room.
When the moment came he could not go through with it.
Please read the tags! This is dark and Castiel isn't nice at all.
Castiel fucks him two more times that day and they both sleep on Castiel's and Mary's bed that night, also the rest of the week and part of the next.
Even when he does not need to, Castiel takes a big breath. “You were asleep, I am sure of that. How would you know that I…”
Castiel does not want to talk about this. It is a sore spot for both of them and he would rather show it to Dean just as it happened to avoid any miscommunication issues. This is crucial.
“You missed me, didn’t you, Dean?” He moans, caressing the sandy blonde strands of hair. “I did, I wish we could do this every day.”
He thanks her, noticing how she does not waste the opportunity to caress Castiel’s arm as she stands in front of him, now closer than before. She leans closer, showing off her figure and soft breasts that almost fall off of the dress. “Ben was so damn excited for this party. He’s been a little upset since his father left for the last convention.”
“Dude, I’m not an idiot. I noticed all the scratches and the… the damn soreness!” He clenches his fist, refusing to stop looking at Castiel. “Also, you’re fucking bitty! The, the first night I wasn’t sure because I was so fucking wasted, but I know my body. I knew something had happened to me.
“From which state are you visiting?”

“We kept him in his room, away from other alphas and any toys or objects that he could use.”
He already has Eric, the nurse on speed dial, he will be here in ten minutes to help assist him on the delivery. If he needs anyone else he'll also call Rita, the doctor; although he has only ever needed her twice, his powers are more than enough, but sometimes the mother wishes to also have a doctor in there.
They are curious and excited for him, also, usually, they do not get to know many people from the town. Any new face is thrilling for them. Dean is from outside town and also his boyfriend; they cannot help to want to know him. He will just have lunch with the Nephilim outside, and if Dean wants he can also talk to them.
Castiel is fast, even for a supernatural being. He is also very strong, it takes little to no effort for him to catch Dean and hold him against the wall. He tries to move but is fucking hopeless. Castiel has him and he won’t let go.
“We need to talk,” Dean says with a frown while trying to get into his office. How serious and straightforward of him.
He smiles and does not even need to tell Dean. The hunter knows just by looking at him. They both smile and share a kiss as Castiel comes again in Dean.
He feels a little guilty, for he has not waited for Dean and his explicit and enthusiastic consent, but how could he? He needs Dean like humans need oxygen to breathe, and pain to know what happiness is.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean better not make him regret this. He better be a good partner that gives him as many pups as possible.
He looks so damn proud that it almost hurts to see it. The bastard looks so happy and enamored with Dean that is making him squirm in his seat. This is way out of his depth. His fucking cheeks are warm. God, he doesn't blush, not even when he was a teen getting his first kiss.
The only thing that Castiel regrets after saving the world it’s forgetting about Dean’s uniqueness. They could have been reunited and started doing this for at least six years. Though in Castiel’s defense, he was quite occupied when he met Dean all those years ago. If only he had found him sooner.
