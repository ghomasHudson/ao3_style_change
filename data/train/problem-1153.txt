“I don’t see how it couldn’t be,” Molly began, not letting her eyes stray from the char before her, “It is impossible to go through all this work to make an exact replica, it is impossible. Down to the dental records. It is him. And from what John said, how could he have acted exactly the same,” she ruled out but Sherlock remained unconvinced.
“Common Molly, dear, tell him how you really feel. Tell him how we USED you. Show him the scars on your back from how we whipped you until you screamed. It’s all his fault Molly, this is because of him. How could he ever love someone as bland and disgusting as you,” Moriarty laughed, playing his mind games with his conviving, lying tongue to get her to bend to his will, even without the use of the majority of his body. One could hear the rattle of the gears inside the firearm as her hands shook, unable to shoot straight if she tried.
Sherlock didn't sleep that night, he had tried to track Moriarty by his texts but was coming up short. In anger, Sherlock threw his computer, watching it break in half and the letter keys scatter the floor. The clatter resounded throughout the apartment and left an eerie silence in its wake. He didn't worry too much about the damaged electronic, he had two others, one however was John's. John would of had his head if he touched his laptop. He left the broken laptop stay in pieces on the floor and turned back to the desk, Mrs. Hudson would throw a fit and clean it up or force him to do it anyways. There were more pressing thoughts on his mind at the present time than a mess on the floor. He was lucky that the crash didn't arouse John in his bed he shared with Sherlock. Only for the sole reason that there was not room for another bed, of course. John however, seemed very pleased with the situation.
"The only thing I had going was that I also liked women," he continued, picking up the daily paper, "How'd your mother react, she seems very loving and kind."
"But wait, how will I know you'll stay true to me?" Jim asked, pointing a gun at John's skull. He had to be sure.
"He is doing well," Sherlock responded cooly, brushing himself off and leaving it at that, figuring he knew already.
Sherlock did not retort at his previous comment so he risked going down the stairs without a word. The gentle woman was busying herself away with simple household work of vacuuming her small flat when John entered. Noting his entrance, she cut the power to her Hoover and smiled calmly at the Doctor.
“It was just one word, I believe it was Eluba? No… E something, I’m sure of it. Eluka! That’s it. Completely nonsense,” he told her.
After what felt like a year of brisk walking, it felt like the door seemed farther and farther away. Each second that passed Sherlock laid in that hospital bed, dazed and confused. His knuckles impacted the door, the wood shaking from the sheer force. John kept pounding on the door, his heart racing with adrenaline he’s only felt on the battlefield, bullets whizzing by his face. No matter how hard he was knocking, he was especially punching the door at this point, his recently healed broken fingers ached painfully. With his and Sherlock’s position with the police, breaking the law was below them, so he resulted in one swift kick and the door splintered from its hinges.
"Oh Sherlock, I heard what happened! Are you and John alright?" Mrs. Hudson's voice sounded from around the corner before emerging from her flat to greet him with worried eyes.
Snapped out of his daze once more when he realized John had been having a fit for the last five minutes. He seemed very irate about what Sherlock said seemingly indifferent. Sherlock rolled his eyes, he had always found that John would overreact to anything he said at the moment.
“He will be here soon,” she answered, not needing clarification, “The man in that warehouse, you were right, he wasn’t Moriarty, that man is dead. His name was Edward Cooper and owed Moriarty his life, he went through intensive surgery to look just like him, it was incredible really, but you saw right through it with that stupid blemish under his eye,” she continued, her tone growing sharper.
"So you enjoyed my little show for you?" he smiled smugly at him from across the vast room. Sherlock took the moment to survey the room and measure the amount of danger he was in.
"John?!" Sherlock called back, his head whipping quickly to face the direction the voice came from. Only seeing a slight glimpse in the darkness, but he was sure he'd be able to recognize John's silhouette in a room of shadows. He was sure.
“He blames me, doesn’t he?” she deadpanned and John couldn’t help but let the look of surprise wash over his face.
"Miss Hudson made tea already," Sherlock added, turning back to the screen, not looking forward to dealing with a hungover partner the next morning. John was a pain enough as it was.
“Very vague John. I’m not surprised, however, she was acting very odd and I cannot figure out... Why,” He said, trailing off in puzzled thoughts. He could not wrap his mind around Molly being able to suddenly hide telling signs from him, almost like the-
“You need to go to the hospital,” John said in rushed tones, yelling downstairs for Mrs. Hudson to call an ambulance. Sherlock looked close to fainting and John was afraid that if he did, he wouldn’t wake up again. He was frantically trying to grab for John, nearly falling to the carpeted floor before John attempted to catch him. His leg failed him and he crashed down with the weightless Sherlock, nearly crushing him. He was a paperman, two-dimensional and inhuman. The fall should have hurt, especially with the added weight of another human, but Sherlock was far from human anymore. It looked like he was in pain as his eyes got foggy and glossed over, darting all over the room but remained unseeing. He could not seem to find John's face but he had lost the little voice he had in him and mouthed the single word, almost in a warning.
"I choose John," He finally said, his mind finally halting from its dizzying spin. He really didn't have a choice. Selfishness consumed him like a disease and controlled all of his thought processes. Moriarty smiled and backed into the darkness, not saying a word. He completely vanishes. Sherlock tried to follow quickly, but it is no use. The air vibrated where the man once stood and a sickening feeling built up in his gut as he frantically swiped at the air.
Sherlock had to think quickly, he was running out of time and he'd be damned if Moriarty saw him sweat. He had to keep his head, his temper, and his composure in check and keep up with his facade. He stood and thought frantically. England? Or the man he loved? Love? Dammit, this was no time for personal discoveries. Back to the task. If he chose England, then John would be killed off instantly. But if he chose John, it would take a long time to take down England, wouldn't it? He had a lot of connections it would be easy and effortless!
No, why would Sherlock break a habit? It was very unlike him, even with John. But there was no other reasoning his slow mind could come up with.
"Moriarty is back," he said simply, wanting to just cut to the chase. There really wasn't anything else he needed to know, it was irrelevant.
“It’s strange and clever,” Molly Hooper murmured, staring at Moriarty’s charred and unrecognizable body on the cold, metal slab.
"Tell me the truth Sherlock, you love how I can make you dance like you do? You thrive off of the mystery of me? Don't you," He asked, his voice holding no question.
“If I am not mistaken, there was a state called Andhra Pradesh near my home state in India in which they spoke a dialect called Telugu. I am a little rusty but I believe was Mr. Homles was saying ‘rat’,” she concluded but this did little to solve this mystery. The only rat that John could think of at that moment was Molly but there’s no way Sherlock would have known about it. He may have been talking about the animal rats because he had never once heard Sherlock call someone a rat, or for the fact, he knew a very small dialect like Telugu. However, that was a problem for later.
“Sorry to pop in so unexpectedly, Molly. I hope I’m not an inconvenience,” he said quickly, taking a seat on her beige couch, his hands clasped in his lap. If Sherlock could not be a gentleman, he certainly would.
"Whatever do you mean Sherlock? I think I have won! Once and for all, the Mighty Sherlock is stuck with no way of escaping. You can't think your way out of this one," Moriarty leaned forward with an evil smirk planted on his pale lips. Sherlock said nothing, but wasn't about to give in, wasn't about to give up. Holmes forced himself to relax, taking a small breathe to calm himself. Obviously he wasn't thinking hard enough. What was wrong with him?
John sat next to him, one hand completely in a cast while the other just had splints on the broken fingers. It had taken the doctors a few hours to put John’s fingers back together, which involved, realigning the bones and popping the dislocated joints back into place. No significant damage was done to his metacarpals*, which was extremely lucky, but John would still have to go through extensive physical therapy to return his fingers back to normal.
“I’m not saying you didn’t. It is just impossible,” she said as she rose from her seat and headed to the kitchen for a quick moment, breaking John out of his thoughts. When she returned, in her grasp was a small white medicine bottle that was unlabeled.
John wracked his brain for a quick answer, he would be damned if he hurt her feelings by telling her that she is being blamed by one of their closest friends for the return of one of the most notorious criminals the world has ever known.
John didn’t answer, he simply just stared back with a hard glare fixed at Sherlock. Sherlock could be harsh, but not usually flat out scathing in his comments.
"Wrong!" Moriarty sang, highly entertained as the thug snapped another one of John's fingers. John yelped in pain but was clearly trying to keep quiet. He must be really stubborn, most likely because of his military background.
Normally, Sherlock would try to make another break for it, but for once he thought about someone else’s needs and looked at John. Molly was right, he didn’t deserve any of this. He also realized that no matter where Sherlock ran, John would follow and he would never be alone again.
“Are you upset with me? Being with, or in some sort of strange way, with Sherlock, knowing how you feel. It was very selfish of me and I put my feelings before yours,” he said carefully, anxious to hear her response, hoping for the best but expecting the worst.
“No, it was him. I saw him, Molly,” he told her, leaning forward slightly as the memory of that day ran rampant through his mind. His wrapped broken fingers ached at the memory. Since the incident, John had frequented his old therapist to avoid any post-traumatic stress that could begin to surface. He was told his fingers could possibly not be the same again but, he was going to make sure there was no other damage Moriarty could haunt him with.
"My Mother was the same way when she found out," he said awkwardly, going back to his chair and rolled up his sleeves. Sherlock stood still and broke the eye contact, returning to his violin.
"What are you going to do Sherlock?" he challenged, his grin widening to almost painful lengths. Realizing he had forgotten the plan, he added, "Better think fast," as he watched Hans grab one of John's hands and took a hold of one of his fingers, bending it backward slowly.
Sherlock needn't clarify, Lestrade knew exactly who he was talking about. The man in front of him sighed once more, slightly annoying the consulting detective with the loudness of his breathing which he found completely unnecessary.
“What is?” Sherlock snapped up at her from his spot on the linoleum floor, catching a stress ball mid-air as he was fiddling with in the meantime.
Just as he was finishing the list and starting to narrow it down, the door flung open and John stumbled in a little past midnight. His hair was disheveled, his button up was untucked from his trousers. The look was pulled together with his bloodshot eyes and scowl that instantly found Sherlock typing away at the desk, looking back at him. The decision whether to make a smart quip at John's appearance or not was a particularly hard one.
“What is what, John?” Sherlock replied after a second with agitation, slightly irked that his train of thought was disrupted, didn’t he understand that the game was on. Moriarty was back and somehow he was alive, he just couldn’t figure out how or what his next move was.
John sighed and stood and walked over to their desk, which was littered with three laptops and endless amount of papers. After shifting through the papers, he managed to find a blank piece and a pen.
“Fine, I’ll make it for you,” she spoke suddenly, pointing the gun away from him, swiveling so fast on her feet she almost fell. “Do one thing right in your miserable life and save John,” she spoke as Sherlock finally broke free of the rope holding him down.
“Fuck you,” Sherlock spit, trying to get his nimble fingers to undo the loose knot that bound his wrists. He lacked the function of his fine motor skills in order to complete the task and he shook with frustration.
"Just fine, Mrs. Hudson, John is drinking away guilt with whatever fingers he has left, he'll be in around Midnight. Make him some tea, will you," he said without question, continuing up the stairs without looking back. The woman's worried tone followed him up the stairs but he didn't hear a word and shut the door on the irritating noise. He felt bad for her sometimes, it wasn't her fault she was obnoxiously worried about things that were none of her business.
Also, you may have noticed this chapter is almost a replica of an earlier chapter “Snap”. However, this is simply the same chapter from “Moriarty’s” point of view to show the reader that this is not him, instead a look-alike named Edward Cooper. I hope this clears up any confusion!
“You ruined everything! Someone has to die! Now choose!” her cry ripped through the air and if she wasn’t about to kill them, it would have been the saddest thing they have seen. Moriarty really knew how to use his hostages, he knew John would not be able to shoot her. It was a triad of murder ready to get really ugly and it was a toss of the die. Someone was not going to make it out alive.
After a painful amount of time, the cabbie screeched to a halt in front of the accused woman’s house. John told the cab to wait for him just by the off chance she was at work and they would have to double back before he walked up the walkway to her home. She lived a little ways from the city in a nice suburban area where you can imagine a doctor, although a mortician, living with her house squished, sharing a wall with one of the adjacent houses. The concrete leading up to her humble home felt longer than it actually was, each step echoing off the walls of the surrounding houses to John’s ears. He had made this walk many times, whether it be a friendly visit or a holiday or two, however, most of the time Sherlock was present. This was different. His guts squeezed and fell done to his toes like they were lead, making him nauseous and filled with anxiety like he has never felt before. Anger fueled his steps, his shoes hitting the stone harder the closer he got to the door.
"Tell me they don't show how you think? How much you enjoy the mystery! The game in on! The race against time! You love to be smarter than everyone else. Makes you king. You love the power. Though, you like to be alone. 'You walk a lonely road' as they say. But John changed that, didn't he?" Moriarty purred teasingly.
"Tempting, but no," Jim frowned. Snap. Moriarty just turned in time to see John's middle finger bent all the way back and didn't so much as blink. Turning back to Sherlock, he could see his eyes shining with fresh tears. Oh, that was interesting and infuriating.
"What did you do to me…?" he asked firmly but his voice only comes out in a hoarse whisper. Jim didn't answer, he just smiled, sitting in a metal chair not too far away.
“It’s not your fault your mind doesn’t pick up minuscule details,” he bit out, not in the mood for John’s shenanigans at the moment. During this whole exchange, Molly remained quiet in contemplation, continuing to examine the what was left of a man’s body.
“The acid in pineapples? Why would there be-” Sherlock started before Molly cut him off in a proud voice.
*The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination
"We tried that," Moriarty frowned, getting bored. He knew Sherlock was more creative than that. And really? Would he die for that square? Really pathetic.
"I can't! Tell me and I'll do it!" Sherlock yelled, his mind spinning panicky for answers. If it was anyone else, he'd be able to think. He would let the thug break a few fingers. But this was John.
"Back to business then. How many exactly died?" He asked casually, Lestrade settling in his desk chair with a sigh.
"Wrooonngg!" Moriarty sang, highly entertained as the thug snapped another one of John's fingers. John yelped in pain, but was clearly trying to keep quiet. What a stubborn man, Sherlock thought at the back of his panicked mind.
He didn't fear for his life but, he didn't want this game to end either. He knew he was only temporary, ever since Moriarty had shot himself the first time. He was specifically trained to deal with many situations; how to escape, how to maneuver and how to die. He breathed in one deep breath, one of his last, and exhaled, relaxing his tense body.
“We should go, John. Mrs. Hudson worries,” Sherlock said, obviously not hearing what John had been saying for the past few minutes. John rolled his eyes and gave an apologizing look towards Molly on their way out of the morgue.
“I suppose. Thank you, Molly, so much. I will get out of your hair,” John said as he rose from the seat. Their goodbye was quick with a slightly awkward hug before John was out of the door back to 221B feeling much lighter. His concern for Sherlock, however, worsened and he really hoped the remedy he got from Molly helped. As he thought about it, he really should have asked what the name of the drug was so he could research it himself or at least know exactly what it was. But he trusted her, she was a doctor as much as he was, with a specialty in the dead rather than the living. He did make a note in his mobile to ask her next time he saw her, doctor to doctor.
His real name was Edward Cooper, born in Nottingham and could have been Jim Moriarty's twin, alike in looks and mind. After a few plastic surgeries to make a mirrored image, he was done and ready to continue the legacy. They had found him a few months before the plan where Sherlock was supposed to kill himself. He was Moriarty's replacement. For now.
"What have you done? Sit there? I was out working." He sneered, leaning forward a bit on his loveseat, his expression slightly puzzled about there were two Sherlock's in the room.
"People die everyday," Sherlock dismissed in an attempt to console his partner but when John went rigid before he realized it wasn't the best thing to say. Sherlock felt, much like John, very much guilty but he also kept in mind that he didn't pull the trigger with broken fingers. It was John's fault but it was just human error. Tuning Lestrade's endless rants, he thought of how he would have reacted and came to the irritating conclusion that he would have done the same, if not worse. Human error.
"Or me." John finished, his expression hidden by the newspaper. Sherlock chose to simply continue playing and ignore John's words all together. It was when his phone's message notification went off that he felt he was off the hook.
Sherlock blacked out. Regaining his consciousness, he heard John’s voice in the background, like it was being spoken over the radio with a bad connection. His vision began to come into focus when he realized he was on his knees on the rough concrete, unsure how he got there from the toppled chair that laid halfway across the room. A soft gurgle brought his hazy mind back down to what he was on top of.
“Sherlock is going to love who he wants, John. I’m sure you of all people know that no one can tell Sherlock to do anything,” she told him, a slight sad tint to her tone but she truly meant it. “I am not upset with you for having what I can’t that would be very childish of me, wouldn’t it?”
“Molly!” he roared, marching over the door but was met with nothing but silence. The rat was either hiding or had made her escape to the hospital. Everything was so tidy inside, very unbefitting of this traitor. The enraged doctor cursed loudly and turned tail back to the cab, slamming the car door behind him, directing the cabbie back to the hospital. The driver was visibly afraid and uncertain if he would get in trouble for driving a man who just committed breaking and entering. Normally, John would apologize and offer to pay him for the man’s bravery for driving this deranged with hatred around London, but this deranged man was too distracted. He demanded the cab driver to step on it and get to the hospital as soon as humanly possible, tacking on a “a man’s life is in danger!” at the end of his instructions. If the poor man was not afraid before, he was now but he was dedicated to being apart of saving this mystery man’s life.
“You’ve been asleep for three days,” John said softly, nothing short of reading Sherlock’s mind and the only question he did not know. So that was it. Moriarty finally dead for the third time and hopefully staying that way and day three of Molly being gone to, which he couldn’t bring his mind to fully understand that fact. It was needless, but probably the only reason why him and John were alive right now. It was a distraction that no one expected, causing Sherlock to leap into a fury of action and murderous rage. Her death saved them both but he still felt that it was in vain. If Moriarty could live twice, why couldn’t she just once? He didn’t have time for these thoughts, he had to make sure he was really dead.
Both Sherlock and John frowned, someone was watching and also listening. Rather than someone watching from the outside, their flat was bugged. This couldn't be a work of some amateur.
By this time, it had been weeks and Sherlock spoke less and less, and if he did, it was in some different tongue that John could not place. John’s fingers finally healed, although they were stiff, however, not enough for him to lose his medical practice and at this point, that was their only income. There were days that John wanted to leave, knowing Sherlock wouldn’t notice but would then realize he would die of starvation or dehydration, whichever came first. Mrs. Hudson seldom came upstairs to them anymore, she couldn’t stand to see Sherlock the way he was nor the smell coming from him. His body was in a vegetative state, all but his fingers which moved like lighting. Bone-white skeletal fingers danced over the keys in thousands of pages long google docs and hundreds of internet tabs.
“Are you attempting to date again?” Sherlock demanded, getting annoyed at her change in her demeanor. He was not a fan of change and she was really starting to agitate him.
"Sherlock?" he answered in a surprised tone, "What is my pleasure to talk to my mighty little brother?" He laughed and Sherlock sighed into the receiver. He normally wasn't up to deal with his older brother, especially enough to call him, but this was an emergency. While most of his cases were micro-issues, whenever Moriarty was involved the issue turned macro and involved the whole city. For the moment, he could handle his egotistical and holier than thou attitude.
He had been looking at a blank screen for a bit over a half hour, scolding himself for letting his mind wander. Again. He forced himself to start writing everything he knew about the man, which wasn't as much as he liked. Slamming down on the enter key twice, making a list of the people who could have possibly helped Moriarty's disappearing act. One of the first names on the list was Molly, but he deleted her name the second he wrote it. She was not nearly smart enough and he knew for a fact she could not have done such a thing. She was easy in his thoughts, she knew what she needed to do her job. She wore her heart on her sleeve even more than most people, she definitely wouldn't have helped a man like him. She hated him as much as Sherlock and John did.
“You know what I did? I had some friends from meet her poor wittle famiwy,” he spoke in a baby voice while Molly’s face twisted in pain. It was unknown how long this had been going on under Sherlock’s nose. He needed to win, there was no doubt about it, his drive to beat Sherlock at his own game drove him mad to a point past murder but now to torture. Molly trembled behind the broken man, the only thing keeping her from falling to her knees was the gun being held to the back of her head. While Sherlock was focused on Moriarty, his inhuman underling had seized Molly and held her at gunpoint..
“Where…” Sherlock managed hoarsely, struggling to keep his head up when it felt like it was a million pounds. Any other words died on his chapped mouth and on his limp tongue.
“Okay, what is it?” John demanded, once inside their flat at 221B Bakers Street. Sherlock was by his music stand, staring at it, but not seeing it at all. He usually composed his own pieces so for him to be looking at sheet music was odd and very out of character for the detective.
The drug must have really done a number on Holmes, the pressure of John's torture as well to not notice the subtle differences. The missing mole under his right eye, barely noticeable to a normal passerby, but it was something Sherlock under normal circumstances would have noticed. Also what was amiss was the lack of small wrinkles on his face. Somethings could not be fixed by simple plastic surgery and again he was lucky Sherlock was too drugged up to even realize. Good thing too, it would give away the whole surprise and he only wished he could see Sherlock's face when he found out the truth. The look of betrayal, dismay, and realization would have been priceless and downright sexy.
"Like that woman?" John deadpanned which caused Sherlock's hands to stop dead in their tracks. "She's dead, I don't know what you're-"
“Of course dear, you know I am worried about poor Sherlock. All he does is sit there in his chair in front of the computer. I haven’t seen him move! The dust builds up around him!” she chatted on while her hands busily worked on making the two teas. John nodded and grunted when it was called for in appropriate conversation while the gears in his head turned. He would take the tray with him back upstairs and slip the dissolvable pill in the drink. It is easy in theory but in practice, it would be a lot more nerve-wracking. He was banking on Sherlock’s compromised state of mind, it would go unnoticed.
"SHUT UP!" Sherlock yelled angrily, letting his composure crack. Moriarty laughed as Sherlock thought furiously, his eyes darting around and looking for solutions. This was Moriarty's plan, to watch him squirm and suffer. He knew exactly what buttons to push to make Sherlock break. Sherlock hated to believe they were really alike all along.
"Have you gone completely fucking mental?" Lestrade demanded, his fist slamming down on his desk, so much so that Sherlock could hear it echo throughout the office. John and himself had been in that office for hours now, in the same rickety chairs obviously that had been used since the 80s at least. Or that is what Sherlock guessed by the model. But his guesses tended to be right anyways.
“Do not group me with him, we are not the same,” Sherlock spat, shooting a warning look towards his partner but he remained unphased.
The elevator seemed to be moving at the pace of molasses up to the ICU where Sherlock was being held. The lift would stop at every floor to pick up people from all over creation, separating John from his partner and the potential danger. The doors finally opened, revealing the hallway crawling with nurses, doctors, and residents, but John paid none of them mind and beelined to Sherlock’s bed which was obstructed by the medical curtain. Ripping the curtain to the side, his mouth open to explain everything to Sherlock, warn him about Molly but his words died on his lips. The bed lay empty, sheets tossed aside, the wires without a patient to attach to. John’s heart plummeted through into the center of the Earth with all the possibilities of what could have happened.
Moriarty smiled and the thug opened the door, revealing the cool English night outside. The look in John's eyes as the started limping towards the door had the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end in warning. John was going to pull something before Sherlock could stop him.
Once out in the living room, all of the curtains were drawn shut and the room was dark, much to John's delight. Sherlock sat in front of one of his laptops, typing away, in different clothes he wore yesterday. If Sherlock had changed, how did he not know John was in his room? Unless…
“You choose now! Or I am just going to kill both of you!” The tears fell until it became a river on her face, the water sinking into the fine crevices of her early-onset wrinkles, her smile lines and the ones added from pure stress. The river continued to drop to the floor, wetting the carpet as a sob shook her body violently which came out as almost a scream.
"Meredith, was it? Your son is in perfect condition, I am sure. I've written down a few addresses where you can check. What Sherlock is saying is that your son might be gay and dress as a woman in his spare time," John said a bit awkwardly, fearful of the mother's response. He could tell as her face started to contort with rage that she was not fond of his analysis of her precious son.
“That is odd, Mr. Holmes is suffering from Lithium Toxicity, I’m sure you’re familiar. If he is not bipolar, I am unsure why he would be taking as much Lithium as he is. It’s not addictive so it is strange,” The doctor explained, looking over his charts again with a perplexed look, however, John was the most confused in the room.
"What did you do to me…?" he asked, his voice only coming out as a hoarse whisper. Jim felt his smile twitch under the force, backing up to sit in the rickety metal chair not far from where he was standing. From there, he could see a thin sheen of sweat forming on his forehead. Well, how handsome.
He sat down in thought, going to his mind palace in an act of desperate frustration and away from John. Ideas ran rapidly through Sherlock's mind, names of places, what he knew or Moriarty, what he knew of himself. He looks through the texts between Moriarty and himself again and again, trying to analyze it for clues but, sadly coming up with nothing. He groaned
"No, no, no, Sherlock," He recovered, getting quite close. He was close enough to Sherlock that he could smell his breath. It smelled like gum and cigarettes. He noted the interesting combination for a later date. He didn't back away and stood his ground before the deplorable man.
“I wonder how poor John thought of all that, hm? Too bad I wasn’t there to see it, I had to let my little birdy out of her nest, you see? I LOVE to see your face Sherlock when you realized it was her NO ONE believed you!” He began to yell, the veins in his neck protruding but the rest of his body limb and dead. So much animation in the limited facial muscles while the rest of him slowly seemed to be rotting away from lack of use.
“Not at all, why do you ask?” she inquired, but John didn’t answer. That could only mean that the Lithium came from Molly and he was slipping it into his tea, doing this to him. A wave of guilt washed over him, threatening to drown him with the realization that this was his fault but then a second blow hit them. The pills originally came from Molly. There was no possible way as a doctor she would mix up medications, coupled with the question as to why she had the medication lying around her house in the first place. His guilt fueled anger now filled his veins, infecting him like a disease, releasing all of the pent up anxiety, sadness, and frustration from the past few weeks.
“Maybe you just can’t see the minuscule details,” he drawled, mocking his words from earlier. Sherlock simply rolled his eyes, but didn’t press the matter further, it wasn’t worth the time when that beast of a man was on the loose.
From the corner of Sherlock's eye, he could see John in his usual chair, his lips tilted upwards in amusement and trying hard not to laugh at this clueless woman. The story had gone way past it's expiration date to be any kind of entertaining for Sherlock. He wanted to tell the woman to just shut up and get out of his flat, but both John and Mrs. Hudson made him swear to be nicer to his clients, especially those who are distraught. That being said, he sent a pleading look at John to save him from his misery.
Jealousy was the first suspicion but that wasn’t enough to cause someone to break like this, let alone start working for Moriarty, who by all accounts should be dead. He had to have something over her, he was controlling her like a puppet, the one person that Sherlock would ever expect. He would have thought of John before he would ever think Molly would be sucked into the madness the Moriarty inhibited. It had to be-
“Drop the gun Sherlock!” yelled another familiar voice that he could not place at the moment, but it definitely was not John. Nothing but confusion ran through his clouded mind, looking at his own bloodied hand holding an equally bloody pistol. Disgusted, he threw it to the side, the metal clacking against the hard floor and sliding away from him and the body he was above. That was the next order of business, what was he on? A few more seconds of adjusting, he was able to see the unrecognizable face of Jim Moriarty with five bullet holes to the face, shot point-blank.
"I require a bodyguard for John for the time being. Make sure he knows his head from his arse and knows how to keep his mouth shut," he said offhandedly before standing up and straightening his coat, picking up his scarf and securing it around his neck. Before Lestrade could even mutter a syllable, he walked out of Lestrade's office and into the throng of reporters outside. They yelled questions at him, much like a firing squad and he pushed passed him, keeping his head hidden from the cameras.
"Sherlock?" A familiar voice called from the shadows, breaking the stare down that had commenced between the two rival men.
"No! Leave him alone! What do you want!" Sherlock demanded, his voice strong and firm, but Jim could tell, he could see it in his eyes that Sherlock was scared.
“Molly please, think about this!” Sherlock said, the knot so loose now, “Make the right choice Molly,” he pleaded with her, the panic inside of him rising so quickly he could burst from the sheer stress. He continued to beg, one last-ditch effort to stop her finger from pulling the trigger. Her eyes met his blues, they shimmered from fresh tears. His pleas were met with silence, her mind working a million miles an hour, knowing she could not do this.
“Ms. Hooper, is it possible that this isn’t Moriarty at all? Have you checked the dental records?” he demanded while John looked at him in confusion. John had his casted hand held in his other politely, sitting on a bench and trying to stay out of the way. He was a doctor but this was not his work and he didn’t want to step on Molly’s toes like Sherlock always did, this was not his department.
"Drugs," He said simply, his voice stronger than before. Moriarty's laugh was shrill and rang in Sherlock's ears. It was annoying and manic, making his blood run cold as he got up off the floor to stand steady. He couldn't handle him staring down at him another second.
"Where did Molly's boyfriend come from? Not aware you two were mates," he pouted, feeling the sting of jealousy in his intoxicated body. Sherlock shut the laptop briskly, not in the mood to have John and his drunken escapades ruin his train of thought any longer. He pushed the chair away from the desk and stood, walking over in front of John who looked like he was having a hard time focusing on his figure. He leaned down, hooking his arms around John's sturdy waist and heaved him up. With a grunt, John leaned heavily against him, struggling to even keep standing as Sherlock maneuvered him to his bed.
221B always had a habit of being the hub of the impossible. Anywhere from impossible cases, to impossible people, and Sherlock's love life, which to most, was seemingly impossible. Yet, there they were, John and Sherlock sitting in their flat, years after Sherlock came back from the dead. Things were their normal form of chaos and John's blog was booming with brand new mysteries they've solved throughout the years together. However, they weren't together in that sense, but there was no doubt that there was something. Sherlock never believed in love, but John broke all of his boundaries, first as a best friend and then as something more that he simply refused to accept.
"Well, enough for the flirting! Sadly, we don't have time for that, now do we? Tick tock, tick tock!" he chimed and stepped away from Sherlock. "Have you decided?"
"Yes, Mr. Watson, do shut up," Moriarty frowns like he was scolding a child before returning his gaze back to the man of the hour, "It's a deal, you may go." Moriarty smiled and the thug opened the door, revealing the cool English night outside. Sherlock held John up as they stumble to the door as fast as they could move, a slight limp returning to John. Sherlock felt nothing but empty. He didn't think, he didn't think what he would have to do. All he could think was John, getting him safe and far away from all this madness. He knew he couldn't see John anymore, and then, the pain began to seep in. He never felt pain before, but no, that was a lie.
“Is Mr. Holmes bipolar?” the attending physician asked, getting a thorough history on her newest patient. Sherlock was no stranger to this hospital, having situations with drug abuse in the past. Tubes were flowing in and out of the sleuth, frantically trying to pump what was left of him full of fluids. The nurses had to sedate the man, although they were afraid of the lack of proper sleep, he might not wake up again. His condition had quickly become critical and he now laid in the ICU with twenty-four-hour nurse staff watching his vitals and checking his heart. Whatever he was taking, it was a very high dosage which was quickly posed to start damaging his liver and possibly cause brain damage. Never before has the beat of a heart monitor sound so precious to John, it was a sign that Sherlock was breathing and very much alive. He was hooked to many wires, monitoring and checking to make sure that his brain waves were normal. John saw his boyfriend was like a sort of Frankenstein if the green monster was completely white and nothing but bones.
Before he had much time to react, someone grabbed him from behind, their hands under his arms pulling him off of the dead body. Or so he hoped. The further they dragged him away, his eyes did not leave that body, expecting it to move, breathe, anything that could indicate that he could have lived from five shots to the skull he didn’t remember firing. It wasn’t until they nearly tripped over Molly’s lifeless body and shock brought Sherlock back to reality, falling to his knees again, causing the police to stumble. He tried to touch her. Her soft, worn face was now free of pain or her lifeless mousy hair. Now, this he could not believe, but just like Jim, there were no signs of life. They had to pry his skeleton-like hands from her corpse to attempt to get him into the ambulance with the help of a very tearful John. He could not find the words, he needed to get Molly, he needed to get to her so he could save her. He refused to accept that it was too late until there was a slight pinch of a needle and his world faded into darkness again.
"May I remind you, Dr. Watson, you were the one that pulled the trigger, not me," Holmes dead-panned, seeing John bristle with anger and hurt in stages. Disbelief flashed his companions features first, quickly covered by hurt and regret and even quicker, blanketed with anger and dare he say hate.
“Where did you go today, John?” Sherlock’s voice sounded from behind a laptop screen, the fluorescent light illuminating his pale face. He had not moved from that chair all day, he was there the second John left that morning until long after he returned. Actually, he was surprised Sherlock noticed him departing at all that day, let alone returning.
“Oh stop thinking Sherlock, you already know the answer. I can hear you thinking from here,” a sad, soft voice broke through his confused thoughts. Twin Molly’s came into a blurry focus not too far away from the chair that Sherlock was attached to, he could now feel how loosely he was tied and how inexperienced the knot was, but to break out was way beyond the strength he was capable with at the moment. So in the end, it didn’t matter either way.
“Just so we have it on record I can mark it down. Do you remember what he was saying or attempting to say?”
"Better think fast," He added as an afterthought when the thug grabbed one of John's hands, taking a finger in his grasp and starting to bend it backwards in an unnatural angle
“You do make sure to look after him?” she asked sweetly and John nodded. He was silent when he left the room with the tray balanced in his broken fingers. Each step he forced himself to become more confident in himself that Sherlock would not notice. He paid no attention to John these days anyway.
John paused in his train of deprecating thought on his obvious hangover to take a moment and process where he was. He forced his eyelids open and regretted it immediately. Once his eyes came into focus, he was instantly confused. This was Sherlock's room. How did he manage to get himself in there? And moreover, how did Sherlock not know? Surely he would've kicked him out by now to his own fold out bed in the living room. Deciding it was better to weather the storm now, he made his way slowly out of the room, the bedroom door opening with a creek that seemed louder than anything John had heard in his entire life. He hoped that Mrs. Hudson had already made him a cup of tea, she was such a thoughtful woman.
If there was any change significant enough to note, Sherlock had begun whispering to himself. There were even times that is was not English but some language that John didn’t understand. From what the doctor could gather was it was an endless string of theories that whistled through his chapped lips. However, John thought nothing of this development and simply chalked it up to further aggravation as more time passed and the issue lay unsolved. Often, John was just a ghost that delivered food and tea, no matter how little Sherlock ate, he always had his tea. There was a small switch where Sherlock had started to drive more and more coffee, which made it slightly more challenging to slip the medicine into whatever he was drinking. It was a good day if Sherlock even addressed John at all, although it was never more than a word or two.
“Tut tut Sherly, that’s no way to speak in front of a woman, it is ungentlemanly,” Moriarty reprimanded, twitching his head to the muscular man who shoved Molly forward, the gun still in her fragile, shaking hands.
"See, I know all about your beloved John Watson, and you. I've always known about you, Sherlock. Every last case, every last detail."
“Sherlock’s right, Molly. He disappeared for years, just like Sherlock. One almost has to think of them as the same person,” John reasoned with her, seeing Sherlock’s side even though it was a long shot.
Molly barely flinched, but Sherlock could see the terror in her eyes. She saw dead bodies on a daily basis, it came in the job description, but the vision on her own body on a cold metal slab drove a shiver up her spine.
He cut off his train of thought and realized that it wasn't productive. He didn't have time for petty thoughts and wanderings. He walked swiftly to one of his many laptops set up and opened it in one movement. John had scolded him before for not having passwords to any of these devices, however, passwords took too much time, there were more vital issues at hand.
“John?” Mrs. Hudson’s voice broke his out of his reverie. Coughing and pretending he was listening to her the whole time, “Um yes, quite.”
Again, he could not form words for there were too many questions to be asked, but one thought was persistent in his mind and growing stronger. Where was John?
The question now was what if she was at the hospital the entire time and did he just leave Sherlock in her claws. One man’s brain was not equipped to deal with so many powerful emotions in one day, and the added feeling of dreadful guilt was not helping. This was an endless goose chase, without rhyme or reason, nothing about it was adding up in John’s mind.
“SHUT UP! Why couldn’t you just do your bloody job, you were supposed to figure everything out, how could you not notice what was HAPPENING TO ME!” She screamed, shaking more violently than before, “You never noticed when I disappeared for weeks on end!”
“If inserted in one's fingertips, it will permanently rid someone of their fingerprints,” she informed quickly. Sherlock couldn’t help but feel slightly taken aback for being shown up in terms of knowledge. However, before he could utter another word, he was hit hard by a fact he should have seen all along. Of course, he had seen them, very small ticks, a missing mole under his eye. He Should have known.
"Figure it out Holmes," He challenged, his palms facing the ceiling. It was fascinating to watch his face as it goes completely blank with thought for a second, which probably felt more like a few minutes in Sherlock's little "mind palace". He had learned about Sherlock's memory technique from some of John's articles on his blog. The man did have a talent with the written word, but he mostly just read them to get into Sherlock's head and also look for little bits of him in the cases.
“Leave her alone Sherlock, let’s go, you’re being an ass,” John said, nudging Sherlock and started heading towards the door. Sherlock was reluctant to go, what was wrong with Molly? He could always read Molly, she was the easiest person to read besides John. Also, she was being very abrasive and cold towards the pair, especially Sherlock.
Sherlock crinkled his brow in confusion and placed his phone back down on the desk, not hearing John's words. Before he could bring the bow back to the strings, his phone went off again.
“No one could survive a blow to the head John, has he ever thought that is wasn’t Moriarty at all?” she questioned and John shook his head.
"As sure as we can be," he finally answered after a few moments and Sherlock didn't need to read his demeanor to tell that he was unsure.
“I have never seen our Sherlock like this before and neither have you, I take it? Have him take this. It’s in a way like a Xanax and is he doesn’t take it just sneak it in his tea,” she winked, “Before he hurts someone or God forbid himself by relapsing.” she finished and the way she said “Our Sherlock,” sent an odd chill down his spine. The tone was very off, however, he concluded it as lingering admiration for the man.
"If you betray me, I kill both of you," He grinned, satisfied with his solution and looking back and forth between the men. Sherlock was an amazing treasure but what is the point if he couldn't be his.
He would have to start from the beginning. One simple question of how Moriarty rose from the dead. Of course, that was impossible and he couldn't obviously have done it alone. Sherlock pondered if he could even go to the bathroom by himself. He chuckled to himself as he opened a blank document and started to type furiously. John always used this computer for his blog, Sherlock realized and paused in his typing for a moment, wiping his hand over his face. The man was just everywhere. Just out of childish spite, he shut the laptop and replaced it on top of another and started over. It was all childish, how John was acting, it was his fault, of course, that they were in this position in the first place. If John wasn't everywhere in Sherlock's life, infiltrating his thoughts every few seconds, the smell of him lingering in the stuffy air of the flat, clinging to the furniture. It was his fault, like a drug, he concluded. It was like an addiction he couldn't shake, not that he wasn't used to that. John's fault that Moriarty had leverage against him.
"Your son is not dead, and I'm sure if you paid any attention to the boy then you would already know where he is," he said as he picked up his violin and began to play, tuning the woman out again. She was about to explode at the man, John distracted her war path with a piece of paper in front of her face.
“I was the one who confirmed the body was Moriarty, John. It’s a logical assumption and I am not a brainiac like he is,” she said like it was the most obvious thing in the world causing John felt like a fool.
Again, Sherlock arose in confusion, the bright, blinding light of fluorescents rose him into consciousness. His body, remembering the moments before they sedated him, returned to a state of fight or flight and immediately tried to get up from the bed before the soft but firm hand of John held down his shoulder.
"Correct! It was quite entertaining to dance around like my little puppet," He drawled, folding his hands in his lap and leaned back in his chair. He could see anger flash across his detective's eyes and in his posture, almost shaking with it. It really couldn't get any more entertaining to watch him squirm under his influence. It pleased him, almost a turn on. He could see Sherlock's eyes watching critically and on every move he made. Maybe he should flex for him while he was at it.
“You should be dead!” Sherlock yelled in a voice unlike his own, the first true sentence he had spoken in many weeks. It came out mangled and cracked and Molly never once looked away from his eyes. It took all her strength not to run, but she knew that she had tried that before.
"Have I said that I enjoy seeing you desperate? I didn't even know you had feeling, dear Holmes," Moriarty marveled and stood, walking over to the pair with ease
“That bodyguard I requested from Lestrade has yet to make an appearance,” he added with annoyance, he should have guessed as much knowing the man’s incompetence.
“I’m going home, that is what is going on Sherlock,” she replied blandly, not meeting his irritated gaze. John once again nudged him, this time harder, feeling his own irritation growing. Sherlock had been so paranoid as of late and he wasn’t going to let him torment the poor Molly tonight.
"I am listening. But seeing as you have been repeating yourself for a few hours now, I really don't see the point in listening any further," he shrugged and from the corner of his eye, he could see John pinching the bridge of his nose with two of his unbroken fingers, in obvious frustration with the remaining fingers that weren't brutally broken. A fresh wave of anger rolled through Holmes veins, warming his whole body. He irately removed his scarf and discarded the soft fabric on the desk before bringing his attention back to Lestrade.
The sun shone harshly and John's eyes, his head pounding as if the rays slammed a sledgehammer against his temple. With a groan, he attempted to cover his eyes from the unwelcome light but with no success, everything was too loud. He could swear he heard Sherlock typing all the way through the closed door and out in the sitting room. He mused that Sherlock must be frustrated with something if he was typing that furiously on the poor, helpless, keyboard.
"And another thing! You clearly are ignoring the fact that all of those lives could have been saved! What is two people compared to the around thirty that lost their lives?! How could you-"
“Sherlock I don’t underst-” he started but then Sherlock turned and looked him in his eyes for the first time in months. They were bloodshot and sunken in, a textbook case of malnutrition. His eyes were deep in their sockets and the skin of his face tightly hugged the shape of his skull. His body trembled, his grip was weak and when his arms reached out and grabbed John by the arms, John was frightened. He didn’t understand what Sherlock was trying to tell him. The fact that Sherlock was speaking to him and touching him for the first time in many weeks was enough to fry his circuits. Sherlock needed a hospital and hated himself for not noticing that before, he needed fluids and proper food. Why hadn't he noticed? He realized then that he simply did not look at Sherlock. It was too sad, too pitiful and it hurt. He felt shame wash over him and mix with fear. All he was left to wonder, did he do this to him? Was this all his fault that this man was a shell of his former self, speaking in tongues.
Thank you for joining me on this near decade long journey, starting in 2013 on FFN. Thanks to those who were so patient with me and my slow uploads and the amazing support I have received. This is the first big work that I have completed and I could not be more proud of what I have accomplished. Because of readers like you and your kudos, it gave me the strength to continue this story and always adapt it for the better.
"What did you do!" Sherlock yelled, recovering from his previous surprise and grabbed John's wrist, ignoring the pain in his fingers, John followed without question, and runs as fast as they could away from the building and down the street. Their feet pounded against the sidewalk, curious glances and horrified stares followed them along the way. A huge bang shook the floor of Bakers Street as the building they were just in not moments ago, blew sky high, debris scattering the street, smashing windows in its path. They eventually stop running, never looking back and Sherlock turned to John, halting their footfalls.
"Your little 'shows' are childish really," Sherlock rolled his eyes at the pathetic man, still calculating plans for escape.
“You and Molly,” he responded coolly, looking through a bit of newspaper in his hands, thinking that he could maybe find a clue to a crime that Moriarty was attached to. Without looking up, he could nearly feel Sherlock roll his eyes.
“He is alive Sherlock, he lived,” she spoke, not believing her own words as they left her lips. “He shot in the direct right way in order to not be fatal, it seemed like both of you cheated death that day,” she chuckled darkly, her voice trailing off into the silence and being drowned out by the low hum of the bulbs that hung above them.
It didn't take long for Sherlock to make it back to his flat, discovering he was right in assuming John was not there. Knowing the doctor, he was at a bar not too far down the street.
"Sherlock?" John's voice emerged from the shadows behind him. He loved the flare of theatrics. He could see how the consulting detective's face contort with worry and a hint of fear that he found it quite delicious. He had not only found John by just tracking Sherlock's taxi when they tried to hide him, he had slipped something in his drink to just knock him out for a while to bring him back with minimal struggle.
“I don’t believe that is any of your business,” she responded stuffily, putting her tools away and zipping up the body for the night. Sherlock examined her from across the room, looking for any telling signs but there were none. That was a first.
"I saved us didn't I?" he shrugged, out of breath. Freigning aloofness to what just transpired, but Sherlock could see the terror in his eyes.
“One more question Molly?” he asked, pocketing the bottle in his coat before looking back up at her sincerely. This had always been on his mind and he thought it was now or never, the opportunity was perfect.
"Don't move Sherly," he snickered, slightly embarrassed it sounded more like an amused giggle. It was then that his henchman Hans came from the shadows with John, holding the man's arms painfully behind him. John was a little damaged, so to speak. His skin speckled with bruises and a few cuts on his face which Moriarty blamed him for when he had fallen. The bruises, well, John had woken up not too long ago and was not happy about the circumstances he was in and needed to be knocked out. That's what Moriarty told Hans to do, but it must have really been a struggle if John was that badly bruised. Not that he cared, but it seemed to work in his favor to see Sherlock as worked up as he was.
John was wearing thin. His fuse grew shorter by the day as his brain settled into a frustrated depression and the nightmares started to return. His post-traumatic stress disorder began to resurface, from a stressful environment. The pain in his knee grew in intensity, to the point where he had to buy himself a new cane. The last one he left behind when he first met Sherlock. This painful fact did not help. Telling himself that the pain was all in his mind was not enough to dull the ache from a past injury that had long since healed. Ibuprofen turned to Alive turned to a much stronger Vicodin. This addictive substance could be just as dangerous as heroin but John tried to convince himself that this was different and no pain could be as much as his sore fingers and seeing his boyfriend on a daily basis.
"Oopsie! Better hurry Sherlock, poor John only has ten fingers," Moriarty cackled. Sherlock began to panic, not coming up with anything quick enough.
For the first time, and fearfully, the last time, Sherlock said something John would have ever imagined come from his mouth.
"Oopsie! Better hurry Sherlock, poor John only has ten fingers," Moriarty cackled as Hans began to take hold of John's next fingers, the doctor whimpering in Moriarty would imagine as immense pain.
Before anything could escalate, there was a sound of a door opening and the squeak of wheels of a wheelchair coming from the right side of the room. Without a second thought, he knew what was coming. He kept his eyes glued on Molly, unable to peel his gaze away. Although this was no shock to Sherlock, he still struggled to wrap his head around the idea that Molly would help the notorious criminal.
“Dr. Watson?” the doctor asked in a rush, believing that something was happening to his patient, unbeknownst to him, said the patient was missing. John quickly explained to him the briefest explanation of what was happening, trying to ensure that Molly Hooper did not getaway. Somewhere deep within him still didn’t believe that she could have done something like this and it was all a misunderstanding. She had a hand in saving their lives before and solving cases, she did not have the air of a murderer. John forced himself to think like Sherlock, attempting to deduce a reason why Molly could have snapped. It was a possibility that Moriarty was truly back, threatening her with her family or other civilians, knowing she was one few people close enough to Sherlock to get his attention or take him out altogether.
“You are thick, Molly was acting so cold! She practically kisses my feet as I bloody walk by!” he exploded, staring daggers at John’s dull blues. The only one that could ever evade Sherlock’s superb deduction skills was her. How was it possible? This definitely threw the detective for a loop and couldn’t help but assume Molly had something to do with either the woman or Moriarty. This also leads to the question, what would the woman want to do with Molly? She texted him often on his mobile but he never answered, why would he. It had to be Moriarty and why couldn’t John see that.
"I can't see why not," Jim shrugged and motioned for the thug to let John go. He ran quickly over to Sherlock, catching him in a tight embrace, being careful of his broken fingers. They had already started to discolour.
"Fun night?" He inquired, the decision to make a smartass remark won out this time. John's features only darkened, his words he had been planning to tell his companion all night suddenly leaving his mind. Instead, he grunted lowly and kept walking into the kitchen for a glass of water.
"Not today." Sherlock answered, passing him a piece of paper with the name Jim Moriarty written on it in his own writing. The man nodded, taking the paper and stuffed it in his coat that was a few sizes too big. Sherlock carried on with his determined walk. It wasn't very often he needed his homeless network as of late, all of his cases had been easy and minor. Moriarty was elusive and slippery, but at least he had some hope with his expansive network and unfortunately one other resource.
"I'll stop solving!" Holmes said quickly, but he could tell how desperate the man in front of him was getting.
"Drugs," Sherlock finally changed and Moriarty's eyes refocused, shrugging off his thoughts and laughing. It should have been a simple conclusion and taken less time to figure out, but Moriarty figured the drugs slowed the mind. Something Sherlock was well used to. He laughed anyway, finding the situation very ironic, a user not being able to instantly figure out he'd been drugged.
"Have I said that I enjoy seeing you desperate? I didn't even know you had feelings, dear Holmes," Moriarty marveld and stood, walking over to the pair.
“Besides the Lithium, it was clean,” She answered, double-checking the tox screen report that was attached to her clipboard. He looked at her dumbly, trying to find the words, “There was no Xanax on the report?”
“Oh, John! Hello dear, how are your fingers?” she asked him, scuttling towards the kitchen to fix tea for her guest.
“Molly, please listen! This isn’t you Molly, what he did to you, it doesn’t matter,” Sherlock tried to reason but was quickly cut off by a bullet grazing his cheek with a searing speed that caused blood to drop to the floor.
"If you get sick on the bedding, you’re cleaning it. Poor Mrs. Hudson shouldn’t have to deal with that as well," he said, making sure John could hear him. Just in case, he put an empty wastepaper basket by the bed. Not for John's sake of course, but for his own. John nodded numbly, leaning his head back against the pillows, too fatigued to fight anymore and before Sherlock could mutter another word, John was snoring loudly against the soft pillows. Holmes rolled his eyes and walked out of the room, leaving John laying on top of the sheets with his clothes and shoes still on. He paused for a moment before the desk and sighed, turning on his heel and headed back into the bedroom, removing John’s shoes as briskly as possible.
At this moment, what John would give to have his own car and speed to the vile woman’s house. If he had told Mrs. Hudson, she would happily go along with him in her car and he would not have minded her dangerous driving as long as he got there with a swiftness. He hailed a cab and off he went, demanding that he would pay the cabbie extra if he would step on the gas and get there as quickly as possible through London traffic.
“Isn’t it very like me to be late to my own party? My bad everyone!” Moriarty rang cheerfully, being pushed by a brute of a man that could barely be described as human.
"Where are you off to?" she asked, "Where is John? Sherlock what's going on?" She demanded, but once again, getting ignored. He continued to sprint down the stairs and out the door into the cold English night. He got tired very quickly of the cab he had called starts to walk down the slightly crowded street. On his way, nearly to his destination, he happens across one of the members of the "Homeless Network". He couldn't help but let a small smile perk the smallest smile on the corners of his lips when the thought of John making fun of him for the name. Lucky for John, they were much more than a name and could be a lot of help to them both. Perhaps all of England. Saved by the homeless. Also irony, it has been quite common lately, Sherlock concluded and then set his mind on his current task
“What John?” he said coarsely, a strange feeling of anger seeping into his tone, poisoning the air around them.
Almost on queue, John tore himself from Sherlock's grip holding the gun with his unbroken fingers with some difficulty. Hans must have forgotten to check him for weapons, what a fucking dolt, he growled to himself. It didn't matter anyway, he was ready by the time the shattering shot tore through the air at him.
Boredom and frustrations coursed through Sherlock's veins that morning as he paced their tiny flat as a client droned endlessly about their missing child. Something along the lines of this woman's son who vanished from their house one day for no reason and was nowhere to be found. What was odd was that his room was riddled with women's lingerie and heels yet he had no girlfriend or female friends. This frantic mother was fixed on the idea that her son was abducted by a woman and could only imagine what she did to him in his own room and then simply cleaned it all up after.
"What do you want from me?" Sherlock growled, his voice dangerously deep and infuriated. It was sexy, he should speak like that more. He shook himself from the thoughts that could wait until later and settled for an amused look on his pale features.
“I was out if you haven’t noticed. You have not been much company,” he said offhandedly, setting down the newspaper he had picked up from Mrs. Hudson upon his arrival to the flat. The bottle of pills weighed down like lead in his pocket as he moved around the room. He made sure to avoid Sherlock’s eyes and to look stern. Normally, he would have been able to pick up John’s anxiety within seconds, but he was not normal anymore. His eyes remained glued to the computer screen and not on John anyway.
His eyes were sunken in, raccoon-like with the darkness that was in his bags, it seemed as if he hadn’t slept in months, which was probably true. He had many questions and demands to know what happened but he couldn’t bring himself to ask questions he already knew the answers to.
"We aren't done with this conversation Sherlock," John added as the consulting detective checked his phone.
He couldn't help but feel disappointed when Sherlock's eyes flitted away from him, looking for an escape. He fought the urge to roll his eyes or yell for him to take those gorgeous eyes and train them back on him.
Before he could give it further thought, the wooden door in front of him opened to reveal the surprised look on the mousy woman’s face. John could not tell before, but she looked older, significantly older, and haggard. He felt a rush of guilt wash over him when he realized that they had been friends for a year yet he had no clue what went on in her daily life outside the mortuary.
“No, I want to know. What’s going on, Miss Hooper,” Sherlock demanded, ignoring John and remained rooted in his place. He did not like not being able to read someone, it reminded him of the woman. And that, he would not stand for. Her person was void of anything that could lead to any deductions, even Moriarty had not picked up on that. It was unsettling.
“It’s the only thing that makes sense. Why would he just blow himself up for a statement, he’s faked his death before, he can do it again!” he insisted and John considered with running a hand through his sandy colored hair. Sherlock was rarely wrong and he could pull off marvelous things, even for Sherlock, this was a stretch.
"twenty-seven dead, thirteen injured," the inspector read off of the report given to him by Sally Donovan. He ran a hair through his greasy hair, pulling his hands away in disgust. He would have to eventually get home and take a shower and get a decent night's sleep for the first time since the accident. Maybe a decent meal from his wife while he was at it.
With this new information, the Hospital was put on high alert for an escaped patient and John, with a few security guards, marched on the morgue. However, when they got through the double doors into the sanitized room, it was empty. Watson expected this but it still made his stomach drop. One of the security guards phoned Scotland Yard while the doctor wracked his brain for another place she might be with him. Since her house was already thoroughly searched, he began to panic, knowing Sherlock shouldn’t be away from medical attention that long.
He had to think of a way to get his partner to even take the prescribed medication. He preferred to keep poor Mrs. Hudson away from the fiasco, but she’s the only one Sherlock would take food and drink from without a second thought. If John tried to give him tea, it would be very out of the ordinary and superbly suspicious. Even Sherlock in his crazed haze would notice.
“He wants to see you suffer, Sherlock,” The statement could barely register through his foggy mind but as each minute went by things began to become clearer. He was thankful there was only one of Molly now at least, her figure still and statuesque near the single table.
“Just fine Mrs. Hudson, Thanks. Mind making Sherlock one as well? I doubt he’s slept in days,” he said casually, sitting at her small kitchen table by the window. The sun came in warmly through the fogged glass, painting the table orange with its rays. It was a scene unfitting for attempting to drug a friend.
Suddenly, John busted out of his grip and swung around with a gun in his hand. Where the hell did he get that from? Sherlock thought, reaching out to grab it from his hands, but it was too late. The metal exploded in the doctor's hand, but he didn't flinch as a bullet splattered Moriarty's brain against the wall behind him. Another shot and another angry blank look from John, the thug fell to the floor with a heavy thud, the blood pooling around his body like a grotesque pond. Silence overtook the abandoned warehouse and Sherlock looked at his companion with complete shock and worry before a loud click resonated throughout the room.
“I haven’t a clue. Maybe because he knows I won’t take him throwing a tantrum my way,” he shrugged, seemingly easily but Molly only continued to smile.
“He kept saying something before he collapsed. It was not English or any language I’ve ever heard, delusions can come from Lithium toxicity,” he said hoarsely to the doctor in front of him, holding his rage back so he did not fly off of the handles.
“Oh Ho! He speaks, in English which is quite shocking in your former catatonic state really,” Moriarty continued, his wheels coming to a halt in front of Sherlock’s chair. This was the plan, Sherlock would think less as he is filled with anger, so it was time to turn up the heat.
"This may be hard to hear, Mrs. Willams, would you like some tea?" he asked as he wrote. The woman looked at him incredulously, "Would I like some tea?! My son could be dead in a ditch somewhere and you ask me if I would like some tea?!" she demanded, standing to her feet, her face turning puse in her agitation. Unable to hold back anymore, Sherlock addressed her for the first time since she came in.
"I-I'll-I'll be with you!" Sherlock gasped, his offer surprising him. He wanted to happily accept, letting his demeanor shift. That is what he wanted in the long run but what was the point? Sherlock would never be his, not like this and not like that. He would never stop trying to find a way to get away and even kill him. As much as it hurt him to say, he'd have to go about this a different way.
"So how is John these days? Is he doing well?" Jim smirked, knowing he hit a nerve. It was obvious that Moriarty knew one of Sherlock's very few weaknesses. The man had always known, it is hard not to see, let alone a criminal mastermind.
"Yes, Mr. Watson, do shut up," Moriarty frowns like he was scolding a child before returning his gaze back to the man of the hour, "It's a deal, you may go."
"Remember that you just thought your son was dead. I tell you he is alive and well and I suggest you keep that in mind before you no longer have a son. Have a nice day and best of luck," John said quickly as he started to guide her to the door, "Mrs. Hudson will show you out."
“John? What are you doing here? Is there something wrong?” she asked, opening the door fully and gesturing him to come in. John nodded in thanks and stepped past her into her home. Her walls where cyan and her decorations are white, very well put together and sophisticated. He was not surprised by this discovery, it made sense by the way she kept the mortuary, everything had its place.
This was John’s view as he sat in his armchair, his new cane by his side. The stench that rotted the room was invisible to John now while resentment grew in his heart like a fungus. Sherlock had not spoken in a week now, a rattle settled in his lungs as he breathed. John was about to move from his spot to take a walk just so he didn’t have to look at the man when a surprising, rasping sound sliced through the room.
"What do you want from me?" Sherlock growled, his voice dangerously deep and infuriated. The sudden change in tone, Moriarty looked taken aback but mostly amused. This game got more and more entertaining when Sherlock would surprise him. Pity how he gave in to Juvenile frustration.
Sherlock was tired. His body ached and his head felt like it was being hit with a sledgehammer. His thoughts were more coherent than before but it was still a struggle to put a proper sentence together beyond a jumble of words. Every slight sound around him echoed in his head and bounced around his skull, picking out individual sounds proved to be complicated. The objects around him were in twos. Okay, double vision, check. At first, he was in the hospital having fluids pumped through him but between then and now, there was a blur and undiscernable voices.
“Which is what we should be doing, Sherlock,” John said, more forcefully. Sherlock let himself fall silent as he thought. This was certainly an odd occurrence, but there were more pressing matters at hand. He would tackle this later.
"Whatever do you mean Sherlock? I think I have won! Once and for all, the Mighty Sherlock is stuck with no way of escaping. You can't think your way out of this one," Moriarty leaned forward with a smirk planted on his pale lips. He had Sherlock exactly where he wanted him and Jim couldn't be more pleased. He saw Sherlock take a calming breath and straighten his spine. He was so much taller than himself, admiring how appealing he was. He could literally just eat his heart out. But there was no time for that now, the show was about to begin
He stood up in a huff, half past midnight, completely ignoring the table and walks right over it. He grabbed his beloved scarf and walks briskly out of the door, brushing past Mrs. Hudson. He would have to apologize to her later, reading by the bags under her tired eyes, she had gotten as much sleep as he. Probably in worry. The woman worries too much, he decided.
“Yeah, yeah. Blah, Blah, I’m back from the grave and all of that jazz. You guys act like I’m Jesus, it’s getting old, honestly. I’ve only died twice! Really, Sherlock, you need to catch up,” he gaze flitting in Sherlock’s direction before back at John. Without being told, Molly again pointed the gun in the consulting detective’s direction, stepping forward and jabbing the barrel to his sweating temple.
The world around him started to clear. That wasn't John. He felt his stomach churn and lurk and he was overwhelmed with the need to throw up. Jim was hovering over him, a smile wide on his face.
"Don't move Sherly," Jim giggled as a big bulky man who held John in place walked out of the shadows. The man held John's hands painfully behind his back and a gun to his head. Sherlock's companion looked a little worse for wear, spotting a scratch or a bruise here or there on his body.
“You took everything from me,” Moriarty began again, his voice low and menacing, “I have died time and time again for you Sherlock, couldn’t you stomach at least a smile, hm? I thought dead was the new sexy?” he demanded, his eyes dancing with a shine you would expect to see from a deviant child that just killed his first innocent animal. “Put on a happy face Sherlock, this is the final show!”
“You need help Sherlock, serious help. Call Mycroft, he knows how to deal with you and your tantrums,” John said coldly, pursing his lips and folding up his newspaper. Without another word, he walked out of their flat, not hearing Mrs. Hudson’s worried calls behind him as he slammed the door to 221B.
With the sound of the door shutting with a quiet click and John's sigh, Sherlock lowered his violin. It was obvious that this client had some sort of effect on John and he looked up to meet John's gaze.
Molly finally tore her eyes away from the destroyed skin follicles and brought them up to Sherlock with her hands on her hips.
"People died, Sherlock," John said blankly, restraining to keep his voice under control. Sure, he was glad Sherlock and himself were still breathing, but at the cost of many more lives. Lives with families and lovers and he couldn't help but blame himself, scolding his relief that he was still alive and not blown to smithereens. It was all his fault.
