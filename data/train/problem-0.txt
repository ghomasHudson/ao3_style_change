There was no longer just an old witch hurrying about her business. Instead, he saw a middle-aged witch, keen on growing edible magical plants at home, who, judging by her hair and paper bags, was in a hurry to celebrate the birthday of one of the household, most likely the eldest grandson. He no longer saw the cooing couple sitting opposite him, just ordinary young mages, who had just finished their Applied Magic courses. Before him sat two rather talented young people, indulging in dark magic in their free time and the creation of love amulets.
John leaned back and put his hands behind his head. He knew he would have to wait, so he dressed warmly and had cast a warming spell on himself beforehand. It was calm and quiet near him, and only the rustle of foliage occasionally broke this idyll. Through the leaves, shimmering in all shades of green in the sun, he could see a small part of the piercing blue sky. Relaxing, he allowed the luminous stream to calmly pass through him, taking nothing and giving nothing. Such moments of tranquility now happened to him so rarely, John was in a hurry to enjoy this feeling of unity and belonging, as if by chance he could touch eternity in the here and now.
When I awoke again, it must have been dawn. I heard birds and the city beginning to wake. It sounded familiar but different than what I was used to; then I remembered where I was.
That conversation died out, and we finished our dinner and strolled for a bit before going to the concert house. Holmes had left our conversation behind him and must have moved on to anticipation for the concert, as he was nearly radiating with pent-up energy beside me. I had to keep myself from making smug faces at passersby: The man beside me was mine, he had chosen me, he was still alive, he was very much the man I loved, and we were going to a concert together. Walking with him, our canes on opposite sides, we limped together down the streets of Berlin, and I knew I had never felt happier in my life.
I didn’t hear the rest of it as I headed in the direction he had vaguely pointed to. I found some gauze and ointments, but that was it. I brought them both back to the sitting room, where Holmes was struggling to undress.
It is a Sunday morning, which means Mrs Hudson is blessedly elsewhere. We have, according to my trustworthy inner clock and the sun’s rays themselves, three hours until we are bothered by our housekeeper or anyone else. Our rooms are otherwise silent; there is no case on; I doubt even a client would interrupt us this early on God’s day. Watson sleeps on, and I watch him.
‘I love you so,’ I rasped harshly against his lips, shocking myself as the sentiment poured out of me without my expecting it to. But it was true, and real.
The concerts (Hamlet at Luisen Theater and Wagner’s Lohengrin at Königliches Opernhaus) Holmes & Watson attended really did occur on Sunday, March 2, 1901, per an archived Berlin newspaper I read. Here also is the mention of the great Magnus Hirschfeld, and what Holmes said is true: Berlin had several homosexual, marvelously extravagant balls, which the police did indeed attend. See Robert Beachy’s Gay Berlin for more delicious details. Dancing and smut planned for next chapter — this is now all but planned out and am doing my best not to lose steam.
When we finally arrived back at his digs and were once more inside, he sat swiftly on the chair I myself had awoken upon, and now I understood the purpose of its placement. As I let him rest and catch his breath, my only comment a light hand briefly on his shoulder, I brought my suitcase into the sitting room and placed it on the sofa.
‘Yes, lucky me.’ He smiled once again, then continued. ‘I knew I had failed the mission to destroy Moriarty’s criminal network when I saw the papers in Paris, where I was at the time.’ He closed his eyes and tensed. I squeezed his hand, my thumb travelling back and forth on his knuckles. ‘I had missed one, perhaps even the most important man. Moriarty’s right-hand man. Sebastian Moran. He escaped to England, out of my grasp, and spread slander against me.’ Holmes leaned his other arm on the table then, leaning forward, and I held onto his forearms, listening. ‘I was in Paris, about to leave for London, to see you again, and I— I—’
I knew I had done something very right when he let out a startled yell — it shocked me at first, but his body moved into the pressure, not away from it, and I wondered not for the first time at the miracle of that gland inside him that made him feel such intense pleasure. He cursed and lifted his leg to wrap high around my middle; I held it there, moving closer on my knees, and rested a third finger just at the rim of him.
Before I realised what was happening, Holmes was letting go of my hand and standing to applaud the company. I stood with him to applaud the actors who did not for a second hold my attention; I felt a bit guilty for not paying attention to a play Holmes had clearly enjoyed and to which he had indeed provided me tickets. But as he turned to me, the last rounds of applause dying down, he fixed me with such a grin, an expression on his face that could only be described as transcendent; any bad feeling I was holding onto dissipated instantly.
‘Holmes,’ I began. He turned his head and I kissed down his neck, intent on marking him. His legs spread so that I was between them, a movement which pressed our erections even closer together. I wanted to rub off on him, to rub our pricks together, but I had to ask. ‘Holmes, is this alright?’
, but he waved my hand away. I reckoned he needed to be alone, the shame of his pain too much for him at the moment, so I let him go and watched him weave awkwardly but still somewhat gracefully through the crowd to the other side, to the bar. After a moment, uncertain that I should hold the table in wait, I followed him, my journey much less graceful. I ran smack into two lads, dressed in sailor uniforms (were they truly sailors? I now knew could not trust any outward appearances), apologised briskly in first English then, correcting myself, broken German, and continued on briskly after their smiles turned appreciative, their eyebrows coyly raised.
I stroked his cheek and kissed his neck, his hairline, his ear, and held him closer. ‘I swear to it,’ I replied, and followed him soon thereafter into slumber.
Holmes had been here nearly a month, he had said. It seemed he had finished his business in Paris, where he had read the papers and discovered he could only return to England to risk imprisonment or worse. But that was in Paris. Why had he immigrated to Berlin? I knew of his French heritage, had heard him speak French on multiple occasions; but when had he ever expressed any interested in living in Germany? I had deduced he was knowledgeable of German, from various infinitesimal comments he had made in our habitance together, but for the life of me I couldn’t recall any comments about visiting Germany, much less living in Berlin. I would have to ask him when he awoke. Perhaps a family secret? Or possibly — could a case have brought him here?
, the slide of it, the taste of his voice, the very scent of him. Their mingled skins, tactile, wet, warm. John ran the tip of his tongue up the seam of Sherlock’s lips, feeling the exact line where the velvet became silk.
John, in so many different situations and attitudes that there is almost nothing left to be discovered here. (Always only almost.) John looked like John always looked.
Whatever he was trying to explain has evaporated. Because there is John, expecting to be hurt again, to be hurt
a genius, John. Wouldn’t be much of one if I didn’t think occasionally.” The lassitude in his voice took the snip out of his words. Almost all of his questions were answered anyway.
John did her best to make the deception a pleasant one. She had a lifetime of deflection and camouflage to fall back on, and she had never been more motivated. (Or inspired, really, by Sherlock’s eager responsiveness, by the way she surrendered to sensation, by her lean, long, quivering body.)
He’d already begun to see that when his body was intimate with John’s, his feelings became much more difficult to conceal. That was the kind of exposure he feared, when he was so unsure of John’s response, when there was every chance John would not want to see all that Sherlock wanted to show him… No, it was much too dangerous.
“Like a man.” His forehead still pressed into John’s shoulder blade, Sherlock’s glossy fingers sink a little deeper between John’s buttocks. “But John.” His fingers find John’s opening and flutter there, lightly. Skittering over the ridges there, swirling the slick. One finger, circling the opening, barely pressing. “John.”
So he saw the flash of hurt, which he’d been expecting, but then saw it slide away as Sherlock’s mouth and eyes went wide—
of lips pressing down on the swollen flesh.  John pressed back, letting Sherlock’s hands rock her. Sherlock worked her tongue and lips and even – John thought – chin deep into John’s folds, thrashing her head from side to side, spreading the sensation over a wide area but always passing over and over the nub where the feelings were most intense.
“All right, then.” John tossed his sheaf of papers onto the side table and sat down heavily in his chair. “What kind is it, then?”
(What follows is at least as hazardous to the flat and furniture as their roughhousing session, but on a hunch - bred of hope and a colourful past of her own - Mrs. Hudson does not venture up the stairs to complain.)
After a few long strokes over John’s slick folds, Sherlock presses her whole palm between John’s thighs, undulating her fingers, massaging, smearing John’s wetness all over her hand and between her fingers. With the heel of her hand, she grinds down on the apex of John’s vulva, a firm, diffuse pressure that makes John grind back, rocking side to side and moaning out her pleasure.
Sherlock has still made no move towards John, but only watches her as she lies on the bed, tugging on her bound hands, settling her shoulders. John rejected the idea of a blindfold out of hand when Sherlock suggested it some days ago, feeling instinctively that that level of, of powerlessness would be beyond her, but now she wonders if she ought to have considered it. Lying there, stealing little glances at Sherlock, seeing her eyes travel across her bare body—this kind of exposure is difficult to bear. If she were blinded, she could pretend Sherlock was, what, looking out the window or something.
he’d said. It was not at all what John thought Sherlock ought to want but then John had shown himself time and again to be completely unqualified to make good decisions when it came to Sherlock so maybe it was time to just...give in. And give him everything he wanted.
that, having a partner quivering in or under her hands, loved it even more with a woman than a man, and never more than now, with Sherlock, whose pleasure could thrum and vibrate so that John was sure that if only she could pick up the right frequency, there would be music to her arousal, a high, pure, rising note vibrating in the play of tension and release in her finely drawn body…
“You told me why. You sat here before, when you thought I was dead, and your feet were bare then. Sentiment.
Time stretched out on either side of this bright moment. It sometimes happened this way – if she made herself wait, she could draw out one deliciously powerful climax and use it as a stepping stone to the next one, and the next, each more powerful than the last. A gentle thrumming suffused her genitals, telling her that tonight might be one such time.
At first, letting it happen was all John could do. He could stand there and let Sherlock kiss him, and that was all, and only because he was utterly unable to draw himself away. He could let Sherlock kiss him with large, gentle hands curled around his head and into his hair. He could let Sherlock kiss him and kiss him and kiss him, and when his body went weak, he could let Sherlock wrap his arms around his body and hold him up, support him, shore up his crumbling walls, rebuild him.
Just exactly what it was that Sherlock wanted became achingly apparent, because when he kissed John again, the urgency had transformed into a kind of intense tenderness. He took John’s face in his two hands, thumbs on his cheekbones and long fingers curled around his jaw, just brushing the delicate skin of his neck. He kissed him.
Isn’t the whole point of this to finally be honest? John forces herself into stillness, crossing her legs at the ankles and resting her forearms on the pillow above her head. She cannot look at Sherlock, but she can stop darting her eyes over to where she stands by the bed. She looks, instead, at the ceiling, and tries to let her mind go blank.
John had—with permission—opened up Sherlock’s shirt and had stroked lazy circles through the fuzz around his navel. He’d kissed along the trail his fingers had traced, lipping through the hair, using the slight prehensility of his upper lip to nuzzle the soft skin, making Sherlock squirm and giggle. Bit by bit, he’d kissed up Sherlock’s abdomen and followed the ridge of the bottom of his ribcage to his sternum, up, and outwards again.
Sure enough, after a few more seconds of shuddering, furious breathing, John pulls himself up off the bed and draws his shoulders straight and square. He moves to follow Sherlock and his step is firm, his head is up, and he makes no move to cover himself. If he did, his bobbing cock would be ridiculous. As it is, there is nothing but bristling pride in the whole strong line of his body, head to toe.
Sherlock nodded, shifted, made as if to rise, but John pushed her back down. “Oh, no you don’t. I’m still driving. Just hold still until I tell you.”
—then the shipping yards. Other concerns faded into the background and he settled into the case with more relish even than usual.
“It’s just.” John, after that incredible speech, is not finished. “It’s.” Or maybe he is, at least with the complete sentences. He looks back at his hands, which are clasped again, as his elbows rest on his knees. “I’m sorry for this, too. Springing this on you. If I’d known you didn’t know, I’d have let you stay...I don’t—I thought I knew, I thought I’d—Now I don’t—god, this seemed like such a good idea. I don’t know how to finish this.”
The floor is hard and the angles difficult, but they turn and twist their bodies, seeking contact where they can.
John was willing to be the one who was penetrated. He said he didn’t care either way. The easiest solution to Sherlock’s worries was for him to ‘top’. Nothing simpler.
Under Sherlock’s soothing hands and beseeching tone, John subsided a little. It was awkward, though, halfway off of Sherlock’s lap, and all the way hard. He shifted uncomfortably, cheeks flaming.
?—slipped and slid over and around his hole. There was pressure, a stretch, and there was a finger inside him, but it twisted and curved and stretched and was there still only one? He could not focus on that sensation when there was a hand pumping his prick and the slick glide of a thumb over his slit,
There are several minutes of silence afterwards, while their breathing settles and their penises soften. John gingerly shakes out his legs and looks at Sherlock where he lies resplendent on the bed.
Um. Do I need to say it? Is it not a truth universally acknowledged that a fic writer, having published a story, or even just a chapter, must be in want of a comment?
an arsehole. But yes, all those things. I don’t like them, but I want them anyway. I’ll take them, and everything they’ve done to me...and everything they’ve done to you, too, although I hate that part, I hate it, I
When Sherlock stepped away, it was only to take John by the hand and lead him up the stairs where he unwrapped him like a gift, and John forgot to wonder who would want a gift like him, and let himself be opened.
Now that he was hard, he could escalate, he could fan the spark. She had pressed her body to him, so it was allowed for him to press back, to seek a little friction, a little pressure, to keep himself in the game. (
He plays for time. “‘Finish this.’” It is idiotic to simply parrot John’s own words, but he can hardly even manage to hint at a question mark after the words without showing John how lost he is.
“No. Fuck, no.” John can’t stay still; he holds the headboard as he’s been bidden, but he is moving and swaying his hips in counterpoint to Sherlock’s twists. His voice is strained. “Of course not. I love you. You’re my best—
John, for his part, was calm. He leaned in close. “Let’s get one thing really fucking clear. He’s not my bloody fucktoy,
But, look, I know—It’s a lot, okay, I know it is. A lot for me to spring on you all at once. It’s just—where we go from here is...whatever you want, all right?”
But Sherlock, far from turning to leave, held John’s eyes. “John,” he said. “John Watson. My friend, John Watson. John.” His searching expression transformed into one of unspeakable tenderness. “Do you really not know?”
“I don’t know.” He looks off and to the side. “I was going to say I’d just tell them, or, fuck, I guess make a move, god, that sounds – I’ve never had a problem, figuring out what to say. Yeah. How to – fuck. But it’s stupid to try to compare any other time to this. Of course it’s easy when – ”
John jerks and twitches, nervous. Their ease has vanished. “I don’t—Sherlock, I don’t want you on the floor.” His hand that was warm in Sherlock’s hair tugs instead on his shoulder. “You shouldn’t—I should—”
And now Sherlock has come up to John’s bedroom (where John is ploddingly putting his socks away in a drawer- folded, but not indexed), and has laid himself naked on his back, crosswise, with his head and arms hanging a little over the edge, so that his torso is stretched and taut and every line is visible.
What should they do with this wreckage? John came to Sherlock with his love only when he had lost everything else. The rubble has not been cleared. The dust has barely settled. By any reckoning, this is not a solid foundation upon which to build anything at all, not if they expect it to last.
“It was fine when I thought it had a point, you know? It was hurting us, okay, but it had to happen. They had to...lay it all out for everyone watching, make it clear who we really are and where we went wrong and what we need to be...to be right again. So that everyone would want us to have it, yeah? So they’d stay with us to see it through. That’s what I thought was going on. But now...you said,
The wanting had always been writ so large that it had been easy to ignore that other sly, sneaky little word, the tiny script wriggling itself in unseen, unbidden, between the lines. But here it was, waiting in ambush.
“Let it happen,” Sherlock had said, and now, waiting for assent, her tongue dragged along John’s most sensitive flesh, the movement so tiny, so delicate. The effect would be almost soothing except that every one of John’s nerves was stretched tight and the infinitesimal caress served only to keep her
nice.” Sherlock’s finger came to rest on the beaded tip of John’s breast and began to move in tiny circles. “You’re lovely.”
Sherlock waits to hear what he will say. He reminds himself severely that John is not the only one who hides, that he has been doing it himself – in plain sight, admittedly, but still hiding. It is very unlikely that John will sort this out.
He was every bit as raw and open as he’d imagined himself at his most terrified. His leg was crooked over John’s shoulder, his hair was sweaty and tangled, and his hand scrabbled desperately at the bedsheets. He had no control over the sounds he was making, the harsh panting, the grunts that were almost sobs, or the his own frantic moans that gradually rose in pitch and volume until they were high, keening wails, inarticulate but for his futile attempts to form John’s name with his dry mouth, stretched wide.
As if he is truly inhabiting his own skin, and not merely dependent on it. As if the demands of the transport are not, after all, a tedious chore, but a pleasure.
“I know that too, but forget him, John. Forget him.” He kisses the damp shoulder under his mouth. “This is ours. However we got here, this is ours.
But he has never imbued specific sex acts with much importance and has been content to wait until John opened up of his own accord.
She now lay, open and languid, her knees falling to the sides. Her eyes were closed and a small, soft smile played around her gently parted lips.
She slid one hand off John’s bottom and down into her opening, curling two fingers inside, effectively imprisoning John’s clit between the pressure of Sherlock’s fingers on the inside wall and that of her flat tongue on the outside.
And John bore down hard on Sherlock’s face and came, hard and wet, spurting fluid down Sherlock’s neck, letting out one guttural cry and breathing harshly through clenched teeth – and then  a second wave that did not allow for sound or breathing at all.
John has Sherlock by the lapels of his coat, his hands curled into fists. He hauls on him, pulling him along, for all that Sherlock follows him quite willingly. John is alight with rage and indignation, and Sherlock would follow a John like this wherever he might lead. He is
“No.” John turns, now, wriggles around in Sherlock’s arms to face him. “But apparently I do need Sherlock Holmes to show me.” He smiles, sleepy and brilliant and radiant with love.
Sherlock, who was awash now with John’s fluids, which had run down her chin and over her neck and into her tangled hair and on, so that they soaked the pillow, evidence of John’s courage and her triumph.
“Where do you want me to come, Sherlock?” John’s voice was gritty, his teeth clenched and his gaze merciless, boring into Sherlock’s eyes where he lay between John’s knees.
to venture into this territory. No, this was completely foreseeable and anyone could have predicted it.
. It certainly couldn't be for John, that smile. No. But there was Sherlock, letting his warm gaze travel over John’s face as if every line and every fold was pleasing to him, as if having John there under his eyes and in his hands was the one thing that had been lacking for him, and now he had it, and could be glad, simply, to have it.
, but whatever resolve John had discovered on his way home that night seemed not to have abandoned him yet, and he spoke openly.
letting his hands slide down Sherlock’s back and run lightly over the curve of his backside. In the gentle flex of John’s fingers, barely scratching through his trousers, Sherlock could feel the grasping and gripping he wished for, but John’s touch had stayed light as he kissed along Sherlock’s jaw. Light, that is, until he’d nudged up under Sherlock’s ear and, with another flex of his hand, murmured, “
She hasn’t had that thought with this clarity before. With some effort, she says again, “Is that poetry?”
In the dull grey light of the winter dawn, John stood outside the row of houses and stared at his own front door and missed the war all over again.
Now, instead of a soft golden glow, John's magic felt like a blinding light, unbearable and merciless, and Sherlock had to restrain himself from reaching for him, burning, while all this light and this heat tried to find a way out, limited only by John's body. It was even a pity that he was not personally the cause of such a change, which once again reminded him that he was not the only one who needed Healer John Watson, which from the very beginning was a cause for irritation and anxiety for Sherlock.
After sharing his opinion, the mage now looked confused and a little frightened. John was initially surprised to see him hesitantly entering the bedroom almost after them, but immediately conquered himself for his shortsightedness. As his new, albeit temporary, Inspector, Dimmock, of course, should have been involved in such matters.
The security charms, made once by a skilled craftsman, rang around them like disturbed bells, in harmony with the underground source. Now he could clearly feel it - the unhurried flow of water under the thickness of the earth, from which inexhaustible strength could be drawn. A truly ideal location.
Sherlock stroked, stroked. His grip was firm, not hard but steady, unwavering, working towards its goal. The rising tides of pleasure took all of John’s attention so that when he realised Sherlock was talking, he wondered distantly when he had begun. Even once he noticed, it was hard for him to make out the words; whispered exclamations and endearments, perhaps,
John remembers how it was to be those kids. All of those kids, gambolling like so many puppies, and those specific two boys, seeking what contact they could find and glowing with it.
See? I knew we’d be great together.” Same soft mouth, down his neck, hands kneading his arse. Insistent.
and quickly shifts his thoughts to finding a way to break the hold that doesn’t involve an elbow to his friend’s gut or a head to his chin. “I don’t think I did.”
Sherlock’s hands go back to John’s hips and he brings his fully-clothed pelvis flush with John’s raised bottom, grinding his erection back and forth, buttock, cleft, buttock,
How could he be sure of that? There were a thousand ways Sherlock could have ruined it completely so that John would never want this again. This was not the time to point that out.
Sherlock does, then, Sherlock touches her, Sherlock allows the delicate circling touch of her fingers to settle, so lightly, on the tip of John’s nipple, only the slightest touch, but John cries out and almost rises off the bed, and she thinks she could come, just from this, just from Sherlock’s fingertip resting there. She trembles and tries not to break the contact.
John fell silent. There was nothing for him to say. He’d set himself one task, one simple task, and he’d failed.
John goes very still. He meets Sherlock’s eye with trepidation, and two – no, three – unreadable micro-expressions, and underneath it all, astonishingly, a trace of that same forthright desire.
John knows that everything he’s feeling is beaming out of his face and he spares the space in his thoughts to note that he feels positively radiant, incandescent like the boys in the park, or more, much more - before he lifts his face to claim his kiss.
Over the course of the next several breaths, he settled. Sherlock tucked him back into his clothes while John managed to form the thought
“I know John.” Sherlock had John stretched now, rosy and wet and loose around his two fingers. “I’m sorry you have to have it in your head, but it’s not your fault. I love giving you my arse, and I love this, now, too, having yours, seeing you stretched around my fingers, taking me in. Taking it. Sweating and moaning and
It was easier than holding back the words that he might otherwise say, the ones that John might not want to hear. And anyway, he
That John, with his knees spread wide, his arse in the air and his anus loose, was not the one who would be exposed here.
. The tension, the dam of constant vigilance that had kept it in to now was no longer needed, and it crumbled, dissolved, washed away.
She did try, of course she did. She tried to hide, and tried to hide the fact that she was hiding. She thinks, now, that she must have known it wouldn’t work, on some level. Once she and Sherlock had crossed that line—
John dragged her fingertips up the seam of Sherlock’s outer labia, feeling the coarse hair, the silky skin. “Yes?”
“Yes.” Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut. “It’s very…detailed.  But just now some of the details were – askew. Off.”
“A one-shot.” John thought for a moment. “Single chapter, usually a few thousand words…? Is that what she was trying to do yesterday?”
Something in his tone made John finally take notice. He gave him a long look. Finally he said, “It’s up to you, of course. But you remember what I said, right?”
John shouts and groans, and presses back to take Sherlock deeper. Sherlock has to pause, to adjust to being buried in John. The wait must be harrowing, because when Sherlock pulls back and thrusts back in, John
Sherlock can see that John is ready. He eases his fingers out, earning a grunt of discomfort from John. He works quickly, unbuttoning his shirt and slipping it off his shoulders, glad of the cuffs already rolled to the elbows. His belt and trouser fastenings are dealt with just as fast, while he kicks off his shoes and socks. Within seconds, he is bare, and he returns with haste to John’s body, arm around his chest. Even after so brief an absence, it feels like homecoming.
“Sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right. It’s not you at all. It’s me. I’m angry at myself. What came after…what I did...”
but John could feel them all along his body as he breathed there and the awareness stalled him for a bit:
The very weight of his body has changed, seeming to pool like liquid on the bed. His sigh is slow and warm and sated. It comes from deep, deep in his body.
“Yeah.” Here John pauses. Sherlock knows he finds this difficult, and his anger and defiance – which would have helped him get the words out – appear to have gone. “It was meant to, what I wanted to say, it was meant to be…” He glances at Sherlock from under his brows, looks away. It seems he can make eye contact or speak, but not both at once. “It was meant to be a, a gift.”
So there is only one answer that Sherlock can give. “Yes,” he offers, willingly, freely. “Oh, god, John, yes. That is, if you—”
Pull, release, pull, release, and then with another twist and a long slide, two fingers were buried deep inside John. She thrust down onto them.
All of her pelvic muscles were trembling with it, it was rising through her spine and in her fingertips. Her hips - she could not keep them still, they moved in tiny thrusts against where Sherlock held her pulsing clit between her tongue and her upper lip - or was it her teeth?
The shoulders are muscled and freckled, darker on the top, pale and pitted where the bullet pierced him. The chest, the colour of the skin, the coarse hair, all exactly as they should be. The flat belly, fuzzy, a little soft, the swell at the sides just above the waistband of the pants. There is nothing that Sherlock has not imagined, and every detail is, in reality, exactly as he had imagined.
“John. It’s been ages, and my hormones have been all over the show. We did the big emotional scene at the Holmes’. Do we need another one?”
With one finger just resting on Sherlock’s clitoris, John pulled the fingers of her other hand through the pooling wetness of Sherlock’s opening, and then reached her moistened fingers up to rest on one peaked nipple. Two discrete points of contact, and hardly any pressure, but Sherlock tensed, and her breath caught, and:
John wasted no more time, but reached across and opened Sherlock’s trousers. He took Sherlock’s unabated erection in his hand, and it was
“I’m going to have you, John.” He runs his slick fingertips under the curve of John’s arse, all along where it joins the top of his thigh. He brings it up the line of John’s cleft, barely tickling the hidden hair that grows there. “I know you mean to go through with this.”
scrawled along the curve of a long white throat, etched in the span of an arched back, scribed between spread and trembling thighs, the ink still wet and glistening.
“I want you to ring Lestrade back.” And sure enough, there he stood in the sitting room, holding out his phone to John expectantly.
? And now they were, and he was free to explore. He put his hands on Sherlock’s waist, to feel the leanness of his flanks: he could, now. He could slide his hands up under his dressing gown to play across the span of his shoulders, feel their strength and their tension under the rich weave of his dress shirt,
It was a bit of a blur by now—they never really remembered these stories for long, particularly the unfinished ones. But neither of them had known what to say and everything they’d done had felt wooden and unnatural. It was a huge relief when she’d given up. “Painful.”
He carries his anger all the way down the hall, through the door which stands ajar, and around to the foot of the bed. He does not look towards the door when he hears John’s footsteps enter, nor when he hears the careful closing of the door—doorknob turned, door pushed to, doorknob slowly released. Under his hands, it does not make a sound.
like this somehow, broader. He had to stretch up to reach Sherlock’s mouth, and their hips did not align when they tried to grind together, far from it, but John nevertheless managed to occupy all the space around Sherlock. That, and the aggressive swell of his lats and deltoids made Sherlock feel…not trapped, exactly, or not in a bad way. Enclosed, though.
John was not given to speeches or lectures. His eyebrows worked as he chose his words. “Look, you can take any position you want, but if I penetrate you, that doesn’t mean I’m—I’m dominating you, or that you’re less, what, capable. Responsible. Or that I’m somehow more…shit, I don’t know. More masculine?” He searched Sherlock’s face while Sherlock steadily gave nothing away. John gave up, and kept talking: “Come on, Sherlock, you of all people know those stereotypes are bullshit. I like to tell you what to do, so obviously I’d never let you do that to me? I don’t know what your hesitation is about having my cock up your arse, but I like that kind of sex, and I want to have it with you. One way or another. And not have it mean any of that.”
Of Sherlock. Who hasn’t asked for any of this and is not the one who brought it up. (He would never have brought it up.)
. John wanted to stop. John wanted to stop and transport himself away from here, away into his room at 221B, under his covers, with Sherlock murdering the violin downstairs. No hands on his body, no sympathetic eyes on his face. That was all he wanted. Yes, he wanted to stop.
“Sorry,” he muttered, insincerely, as he transferred his grip to her hip. But he did take a mental step back. He couldn’t use rage to replace desire. He couldn’t actually kill her with his bare hands.
; there was no time. He had to get the taste of Sherlock all through his mouth, inside his cheeks and onto his tongue and between his lips, and he had to bury his face as deep as he could between his thighs, and breathe only that scent. He sucked and swallowed around Sherlock's hot prick, again and again, chasing the thick fluid, slick, that seeped from the tip,
John is still silent. Sherlock is getting angrier by the second. “Nothing to say? No, I suppose you’ve said enough already. But tell me, John, now that you’ve
The buzzing feeling makes a space for Sherlock to take a breath. “It’s no concern of mine what you believe, John.” The feeling is clearer now. He feels he may light on the name for it in another moment. “You didn’t tell me.”
It is irresistible, and John gives in, lets Sherlock set the pace, lets him drive John’s cock deep into his throat again and again.
Ignore the little bubbles of joy that Sherlock had come for him, again. Angry. “Oh, yes?” John practically snarled. “That’s what it means, is it, when someone sends you a letter that says
He was hard and Sherlock was hard and their cocks were pressed together through their clothes, and their mouths were open into each other, and there were hands and tongues and gripping and gasping and
He blinked twice, and would have kept blinking, except that just then John twisted his scissoring fingers and
Three breaths, four. If he moves, he’ll have to say something. Another breath. His heart rate from the wrestling is settling down, but he is holding Sherlock’s body and breathing into his hair. He is anything but calm.
, with his gun, in charge, so it was perfectly safe to duck out from behind the bins and chase after the suspect as he rounded the corner of the alleyway.
There was never anything he wanted more than precisely whatever John was doing to him. Whatever glorious, terrifying thing John wanted from him.
Sherlock’s long fingers trailed over John’s skin as they lay in their lassitude, up her hip and lightly over her belly, circling her navel before trickling up between her breasts. Down, and a loop around the breast; Up, and a spiralling touch that made its ticklish way to the tip of John’s nipple.
Their hearts were in these kisses; John was not even trying to hold back the surge of emotion that was cascading into it, and Sherlock met him wave for wave.
It was quite amusing to watch Holmes quietly laying down on the couch. He didn’t think that it was convenient for him to lie in his suits and boots, but he was in no hurry to intervene, only moving closer with his laptop, in case the dark mage wanted suddenly to speak out. It practically became a kind of ritual for them, John acting as an attentive listener for Holmes, replacing the skull for that. He no longer even took offense at being compared to a chatty magical object, and after thinking about it for a while, he even came to the conclusion that it was a huge progress in their relationship. Because now Holmes, acting not only as an orator, but also as a teacher, forcing John to apply his deductive method and voice his thoughts and conclusions.
Sherlock halted in front of him, looming in his usual manner; the pale face looked even more displeased than the face of the young Inspector.
From the Author: This chapter was inspired by a scene from the movie “Constantine”. I love this movie. When I was thinking about the scene on the street, a scene from the film immediately surfaced in my mind, and I could not resist - it is simply gorgeous.
(2) Pockets - In this context, the term is denoting the curvature of space in matter with the help of magic. Strictly tied to a specific location and power source. Since Holmes, while still a teenager, learned to solve the issue of energizing by making the entire system integral (closed) and self-sufficient, he also learned to create spatial curvatures. With the advent of John (John’s presence) he was able to make several pockets at once (two for himself and one for John personally).
Crystals usually weren’t supposed to react like that to the magic passing through people, or he clearly lacked knowledge, because this amazing floor didn’t react to either Holmes in any way, only to him; he definitely saw that. John wandered around in circles a little more, involuntarily repeating the simple inlay pattern and listening to his inner feelings. If asked to describe what he was experiencing, the only close comparison he could give was that of bathing in sunlight.
Thanks to the Internet, he was able to quickly find several suitable job openings for himself, therefore, without wasting any time, he sent everyone his resume. Even in his humble opinion, it turned out to be quite impressive, and now he could only hope that his rich track record did not scare away potential employers.
We are almost near the finish but I don't know what to do - post unbeted chaps or wait some more.... What do you all think?
Being able to see other people's auras (1), he didn’t have the opportunity to observe his own. No matter how often he tried, even coming up with the most incredible of ways, starting with water and ending with special sensitive mirrors, the result remained unchanged. Around himself he could only see a strange muddy field, occasionally painted with the usual palette of colors. This fact surprised him since childhood, when he had just begun to intuitively learn to look and see what others could not so easily see.  He could only be guided by someone else's perception and not always clear descriptions. Later at University, he learned that this was quite common amongst many Healers and calmed down.
If, from the outside, the Temple seemed not very big to him, as soon as he got inside, his impression had the time to change dramatically. It wasn’t even about the many spacious corridors - inside, the Temple resembled a labyrinth, and for the creation of which, even with his modest knowledge in this area, a lot of space was required. He would still understand if it was the Source or some other artifact. At first, John even suspected space curvature runes but he didn’t feel any spells, which meant there was a high probability that a highly talented architect simply had had a hand in the construction of the entire structure.
“There is a trace of brick chips on your right leg, as well as a little dust on the elbow and sleeve. You were pushed hard while walking.”
Even if not knowing the road, an uncomplicated black sign over the entrance to the most ordinary building among the many similar ones on this street would still orient him. Once on the floor in the dark foyer, he was greeted by a rather pretty witch, and after a series of questions, following the signs, he went into the lecture hall. He had been fortunate enough to be in for a newcomers meeting, due to start in about an hour, so he had plenty of time to both look around and take a seat in the back row.
John was ready to agree to anything, just to distract Holmes, so he resignedly followed him back into the dead man’s bedroom, without hope that even after a second examination he would see something new. He could, of course, ask Sherlock to share his findings and inferences, but he seemed to have already used up the entire supply of the dark mage’s goodwill for the day.
Catching a quizzical look in the reflection, he just narrowed his eyes in response. He didn’t believe that the dark mage could read his thoughts, which meant there was no point in panicking. Looking at the familiar figure standing behind him in a familiar coat and dark blue scarf, he could safely admit that they looked good together. His blond hair, as if powdered with ash, and skin with tan obtained on the plains of Afghanistan that was never washed off, ideally, in his opinion, contrasted with Holmes’ snow-white skin and his dark hair. Even in height and build they fit, complementing each other.
“I won't refuse,” Su Lin Yao walked through their living room and stopped at the glowing skull. He, feeling attention to himself, shone even brighter. Reluctantly, John shared his magic with it, in order to somehow entertain the guest. While a lively conversation was ensued between the witch and the magical object, John took this moment to check the contents of the cabinets in their kitchen suspecting in advance what awaited him.
Of course, Sherlock Holmes frightened, how he frightened just as everything unknown frightened or how someone who could see into your soul and find out absolutely everything about you, even the most intimate of thoughts, frightened. He himself, at the first meeting, was very close to his own cowardly escape. John assumed that this was the impression Sherlock made on others. And apparently that was why they tried not to get involved with him - and it was not only his tactlessness and ignorance of the usual social norms, or the prejudice existing in the magical society against Dark mages. It was all right.
“Is Sherlock bothering you? Now that you have less time you can devote only to him, and he can be such an owner.”
“What do you think of the speaker's speech?” It wasn't as not difficult for him to maintain a conversation, the topic suggested itself.
For some reason, John knew for sure that they were talking about completely different things, but didn’t focus on that. He himself did not know where this conviction came from.
Sherlock was not familiar with the Ritual, that he, not without the help of Lestrade and his people (here he had to give them their credit), did not allow it to take place. It was not a Call or even a Binding, as he decided at first because of the sandal ash scattered everywhere, from which John's lips were pleasantly bitter, but which he still wanted to brush from his face, hair and bare shoulders.
Having calmed the young mage, John decided to move on to the pressing issue, for which he asked to have this meeting. Conflict and misunderstanding with his own Inspector could cost him dearly in the future, so he decided to dot the I's as quickly as possible.
UPDATE: this week will be only one chapter. Sorry, my dears. And I think from now it will be only one chapter per week due to the RL of mine and my dear beta.
The morgue was the last place he expected to spend his well-started day. The gray tiles, the scent of chlorine and formalin brought back memories of his student years, and not the most pleasant parts of them. He didn’t even immediately  notice the small witch merging into the light gray wall behind her - due to her white robe and low-key appearance. It was almost not even surprising while in the presence of Sherlock Holmes, who always attracted the attention of others as soon as he just went somewhere. John strongly suspected he was ignored as well and constantly lost against the background of the dark mage, though this didn’t bother him at all.
Magic, here, was calm, measured and viscous, like wild honey. It softly enveloped and flowed past, giving the impression of something unshakable. John had already felt something similar, judging by the familiar sensations, but it was not a divine artifact, but a classical and very ancient Source. In all his life, he had never been in a place even remotely similar to this. Although, judging by the bored expression on Holmes' face, such places were something familiar and commonplace to him.
The local magic fascinated him, evoking vague associations with something deeply  ancient. And only one logical explanation came to mind - an artifact of divine origin (1). John tried to ask Holmes about this, but he, in his usual manner, only extended his trademark "boring," and they never returned to this topic. Holmes’ indifference brought little consolation, though Sherlock did not show concern, what was good for the dark mage did not mean the same for everyone else.
“Hey, Patrick. I was hoping to find you here today. I need help in a case,” he pointedly winked at the boy. “It won’t take a lot of time.”
John looked around unwittingly, feeling eager, curious glances on him. There were children of all ages, even those who should have already studied in schools, but for whom, due to life circumstances, the only alternative was only temple education, moreover, not always the most successful, of which he became an involuntary witness.
So I decided to post this chap half way so sorry for possible mistakes and strange wording - the faulf is all mine.
He didn’t want to ruin the pleasant atmosphere between them with an uncomfortable topic, but he wouldn’t be himself if he hadn’t risked anything.
(2) Chinese writing is a thousand-year hieroglyphic or ideographic recording system that originated in China. It differs from the alphabetical one in that each sign is assigned some meaning (not only phonetic), and the number of signs is large;
It was clear from the very beginning that everything was going according to a perfectly worked out scheme. The newcomers were gently hooked up to regular meetings. The drug giving a feeling of peace and mild euphoria, forcing them to come back again and again, until the new members of the sect finally became addicted to marijuana. As he strongly suspected, something then, heavier and much more effective was being used - tinctures and elixirs. The circle was closed, and those in it already had no strength, and most importantly, no desire to escape from it.
The Force, feeling the weakened control, tried to escape from the yoke of Sherlock’s iron will, hurrying to surge into the bed and walls. John steadfastly accepted the first and strongest wave. A couple of hours ago he had already seen these dark like living ‘ribbons’, so he was not bewildered when they familiarly, carefully, wrapped around him. The rest were much less fortunate, only Lestrade remained on his feet, but he also had to lean on a chest of drawers.
“The walk from the clinic to the metro takes about seven to ten minutes, even with a leisurely pace. You then still spend about twenty minutes to get to the desired station, and roughly fifteen more to Baker Street’s door, if you didn’t need to go up the road to Tesco. I don’t understand how you stand it, just take a taxi, I’ll pay all the costs. There aren’t any packages, so you haven’t gone anywhere. So what could have delayed you?”
As he stepped out of the subway, John breathed in relief in the evening London air, filled with the aromas of gasoline, damp asphalt and deep-fried dough from a nearby food stand. He had to walk a couple more blocks to Baker Street, but he decided to count this walk as part of his exercise that he promised himself to do in order to somehow restore his physical form that he had lost during his periods of illness, recovery, and during his return to a peaceful life.
Wrapping the ashes received as a gift in the long-suffering leaflet, and shaking off the dry black suspension from his hands, John took out a notebook and pencil.
"John, give me your hand," startled by the sudden request, though it sounded more like an order, Sherlock interrupted his thoughts, forcing him back to reality.
As he expected, they were sorely unprepared to receive any guests. Of course, Sherlock managed to finish the last cookies and, of course, did not tell him about it. They even ran out of tea, not to mention coffee or milk. The conclusion was disappointing - Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade shamelessly spoiled them. The fact that even the Inspector did not come to them empty-handed already said a lot about them, and John promised himself to start a conversation with all the participants in this unfortunate situation as soon as possible. In the meantime, he had only one universal solution in mind.
A small table set for tea rolled into the suddenly opened door. The witch, who called herself Anthea the last time they met, calmly pushed in front of her their lunch if judging by the time and the appetizers presented. The legs on the high stiletto heels clicked rhythmically, but not one crystal came to life. Bursting with curiosity, but not daring to ask anything, as John did not want to present himself as an uneducated redneck, even more so in the presence of a beautiful woman. Therefore he only had to admire her rounded shape, accentuated successfully by a narrow skirt and fitted jacket.
The process of creating the pentagram distracted John a little, he even stopped fidgeting in embarrassment and trying to move away. Mycroft's witch checked the cardinal points, after which, instead of a permanent phone, she had a bag of black chalk in her hands, which she poured directly onto the carpet, without even bothering to fold it back and expose the parquet floor.
Before meeting with the new Inspector appointed for him by the Ministry, he still had to look at the former curator for the results of the latest tests and the final conclusion. The last formality, after which, he hoped to remember his life before Holmes as little as possible, no matter how cynical and trite it may sound. An involuntary return to familiar dull streets brought back not only uninvited memories. Breathing in the damp air, filled with the noise of city streets and strange cries, he listened with surprise to the words reaching him from all directions.
Unbeknownst to him, they found themselves in a spacious room with many partitions and tables. Now they were accompanied by the greedy, curious glances of the Exchange's rank-and-file employees and their dull whispers occasionally disturbed by telephone calls.
"Hmm? Oh, here." John obediently placed his into Sherlock's outstretched hand. At least this time he was asked for permission, and not just unceremoniously grabbed, which was a pleasant exception these days. Who would have expected that he would get such politeness from Holmes, who rarely bothered himself with such social norms.
“What do you mean? I was just passing near, knowing that you were late at the Library, and I decided to give you a lift to Baker Street. I see I was on time.”
“It’s so late already. Let's go home.” John rubbed his eyes wearily. The day had been eventful, and the next promised to be the same. He definitely needed to recuperate and mentally prepare. All kinds of cults and sects aroused in him a persistent hostility, although he intellectually understood why people looked for consolation in them.
They were able to get a table by a window overlooking a busy street, but Holmes never glanced in that direction, preferring to watch him. This, of course, to some extent, flattered John's pride, though it was a little alarming all the same. John wanted to sit like this a little longer and enjoy the short lull and Sherlock’s attention, but they had more important things to do now that he had refreshed himself and recovered a little bit of his energy.
“I don’t know how to explain it.” John furrowed his brows apologetically, “but it looks like they were guilty of something, and they were punished demonstratively.”
A bright office with a large window, shelves with neatly arranged books, a small work desk and two chairs for visitors - John looked around with an attentive, inquisitive gaze before looking at this place from a different angle. The interwoven runes inscribed on the walls and the standard spells were no different from many of the same, and approved by the Ministry for small practices outside its departments. The most interesting, perhaps, was the ornate drawing at the threshold, which clearly could not be made by a mediocre mage.
. And for all his cleverness, for all his keen observations, for all his whatever-remains-however-improbable, John was still sure that there was no way Sherlock could possibly have deduced...this.
Much later, when they lay together, John’s head resting on Sherlock’s chest, Sherlock drew his fingers back and forth over the skin on John’s shoulder, skirting the scar, and said, as before, “You really don’t know.”
“When...when it all falls into place, and I look up and you’re there, all impossible and mad and extraordinary and, and
Sherlock tried anyway. “Don’t be ridic—” But the arm tightened on his throat and the gun pressed harder against his head.
“I do have to, I do have to. Shut up, will you? It isn’t behind us. It’s right here in this room. It isn’t behind us. It’s
John flattened herself into Sherlock’s palm and rocked out her orgasm in wave after wave after wave.
“All night?” Sherlock shifted, two fingertips now, holding the nipple in the lightest pinch—no, a roll—no, a pinch, her movements infinitesimal, her touch feather-light. “
“I think you should stop worrying, Johnny. How does this feel?” Warm press of round body, hips tucked up against his.
It is pure poetry to suppose that the look on John’s face is in any way analogous to a dagger in Sherlock’s chest. The constriction he feels is completely psychosomatic, as he well knows. His heart and lungs are functioning as they always do. He will not actually die from this, no matter how much longer it goes on.
John’s reflexes aren’t what they were, but he catches himself before he falls and gets himself steady on his feet, arms at the ready. “Do you mind telling me what the hell is going on?”
, though. It looks almost as though he has something he wants to say, something he wants to tell Sherlock. But that is...unlikely. Improbable.
Sherlock looks at him, and then away. It is utterly inadvisable to look at him, or, god forbid, to speak. It is insanity to prolong this for even one more second. Self-destructive. He asks anyway. “You’d what, John?”
She raised an eyebrow. “Your line is, ‘Your belly isn’t gigantic, darling. You look beautiful.’ Try again.”
If John let go like that, she would fly apart, fly away in all directions, and there would be no one to bring her back again.
He’s sure it must be visible to Sherlock, this yearning. He feels it like a fog around his body, making all his edges blurry. It is almost tangible; of course Sherlock can see it.
or whatever the hell you want to call them, that I feel, every bloody value of me in every bloody universe, all the most powerful human emotions, the grief and the anger and the—”
John doesn’t notice. His hands clasp and unclasp. “I don’t know how this conversation is supposed to end. If that’s what this is.”
Sherlock feels the meeting of their eyes like a blast of air, hot, percussive. They both recoil, actually, physically recoil, from the force of the eye contact. As if in the shockwave from an explosion.
Sherlock feels the meeting of their eyes like a blast of air, hot, percussive. They both recoil; actually physically recoil, from the force of the eye contact. As if in the shockwave from an explosion.
It wasn’t more than another beat before they reached for each other. That stern face, softening; those deliberate hands, caressing; those remote eyes, pleased...John
John has said he is sorry, and John has meant it. Sherlock is certain of that much at least. John began this…what? Altercation. Confrontation. Conversation? He began it angry and resentful. Bristling. Bitter. Now his eyes are wide and staring, his face gone slack with dismay.
bitterness? You did get an arc of sorts—you used to mock my sense of honour. Then, when you came back, you changed your tune.”
John would stop, poised, his teeth barely touching Sherlock’s neck, his fingers not quite brushing Sherlock’s nipples, his hot, wet breath washing over Sherlock’s hard, aching cock, and
“I, uh.” John shifted his body until he was securely straddling Sherlock’s lap again. “I don’t want to move.”
even if he wouldn’t remember) of putting his hands on Sherlock’s body, of caressing him and kissing him. Of whispering those words to him that, in reality, he was forbidden to say, forbidden by Sherlock’s every word and gesture. Even knowing that it would fade, and until it faded it would hurt, no, he would not miss this chance.
Without looking at him, Sherlock said, “Whatever you think you’ve figured out, Detective Inspector, you’re mistaken. Kindly desist.”
“Yes. No. Right. Not just…no.” His breath leaves him all in a rush, and he has to pause to fill his lungs again. “So are you, do you want…? What I’m offering?”
“Good girl, good girl. Oh, that’s lovely. You like that, yeah? You needed that. Something inside you. Would you like me to touch you inside? Would you like my fingers now, love?”
John did not watch him go. The sting of Sherlock’s rejection was unexpectedly sharp. John kept his eyes on his hands where they lay curled in his lap, grappling with his own hurt. For several moments, the struggle took up all his focus. He didn’t dare look over at Sherlock until he could be sure he didn’t look as miserable as he felt.
And now John is weak from his orgasm and hanging in Sherlock’s arms, and in Sherlock’s burst of possession there is no more room for gentleness. He pulls them back to take some of their weight on his own thighs, and his body takes over completely; he bucks and ruts deep into John’s unresisting body. He is too far out of his own control to mitigate the yowl that bursts out in his own high, wild voice as he comes, hips convulsing erratically.
But it was also—Sherlock could admit in the confines of his own mind—harrowing. To be responsible for John in this way, to be responsible for his pleasure, for his well-being.
Of course John doesn’t know. He doesn’t know because Sherlock hasn’t told him. Has, in fact, done everything possible to avoid telling him, to prevent him from having the slightest inkling. And because of that, here is John, lost. And for that Sherlock is...
Sitting room, finally. Coat, jacket, cuffs, buttons, shoes, trousers, Christ, there were a lot of clothes. “Off, off, off. Get them off. Fuck, John, hurry up. Get yours off too.”
John let his hands continue their smooth slide down Sherlock’s back to dig his fingers into the firm flesh of his arse. At last he kissed down from Sherlock’s beautiful mouth to nip at his neck, to taste the thin skin there, to burrow under his ear and breathe in the smell of him. At last he pressed his body forward to feel, with his own chest, the flexing, solid resistance of Sherlock’s ribcage. At last he did not merely accept the push of Sherlock’s thigh against his groin, but ground down on it with a good will, groaning out his arousal.
The Fall, as he has taken to calling it in his head, with unspoken upper case letters, to complete the biblical analogy
On the fourth night they reached the point where up to now she would gently extricate herself and ease off, and tonight she just...didn’t.
A moment later the Kiwi guide confirmed over the loudspeaker that yes, it was a humpback whale, and that it was very special indeed to spot one on a tour, especially this time of year. Sarah looked up at John at this news, beaming.
“No. Though I did have ample opportunity to observe those other…attitudes, as you call them. More than sufficient to deduce them from this distance, since any closer would have been unwise.”
After sharing his impressions of attending the newcomers’ meeting and meeting Su Lin Yao with Sherlock, he did not expect his story to be the result of the unusual cozy lull in Baker Street.
“Since you, dear John, have now become an integral part of my brother's life, your safety has become as much a priority for me as that of Sherlock himself, so let me give you a humble gift. I dare to hope you both will appreciate it and will not refuse.”
Catching several interested glances, John involuntarily smoothed himself. It was worth seizing the moment until there was no tall, prominent figure shrouded in an aura of mysticism and mystery around.
“Thank you,” The girl was completely confused. She looked helplessly at John, and he could only smile at her amiably. Under the attentive gaze of cold gray eyes, anyone felt uncomfortable, even he sometimes caught himself wanting to escape, when Sherlock's gaze began to follow his every movement.
For such an early and cold morning, the suburban station suddenly became quite busy. Here and there a child's laughter or a shout were heard, immediately replaced by a brief echoing calm. John habitually joined the motley crowd of people, looking for familiar faces and calling children to him.
Even at the first visit he was quite surprised by the fact that the temple was not located on the Source, which would have been natural and logical. And surprisingly, the Source was not even anywhere near. But despite this, every stone, every tree on the hill was filled with the strongest primordial magic. He could just sit for hours and watch the intricate swirls and overflows, while a living luminous stream flowed past and through him.
“And now I will demonstrate with my example, while we are all in the Stream, how the principle of borrowing usually works. You all already know the warming spell, so we’ll use that.”
“Should I stand in the middle?” John looked only at Anthea and, waiting for a nod in agreement, got up a little awkwardly from the sofa to stand exactly in the middle of not only the pentagram, but also their living room.
(1) Aura is a radiance around the head and body of a person. One of the main criteria for selection into the Class of Healers is having the vision to see the aura of living beings and determine their condition by the aura (including the diagnosis of diseases).
After inviting the girl to cross the threshold of their house, John removed the security charm. Several times he already had the idea of installing the same charm on the front door from the street. Although that would have added to the inconvenience of Mrs. Hudson, and he did not want to burden their landlord any more.
He liked Sarah Sawyer from the very first minute of their acquaintance. Her golden aura evoked thoughts of a quiet summer evening and peace. With a pleasant open face and large expressive eyes, she seemed almost perfect to him.
John felt no rot or decay, although this Necromancer clearly constantly worked with the undead while on duty. Once again, he could see what unusual people surrounded the dark mage, and he too, was now in this circle, which only flattered. But it seemed that if his intuition didn’t let him down in such matters, what was happening now in this room had nothing to do with Classes or magic at all. Well, only if it wasn’t about the magic of love. John could hardly restrain himself from giggling foolishly, immediately earning a suspicious look from Sherlock, who, as usual, stood out in this pale kingdom as a big dark blotch.
“You glow so brightly, John. Why don't you hide your aura? This can be dangerous for people like us.”
This show promised to be truly unforgettable for today's guests. Without even looking back, John felt that something extraordinary was happening behind him. He did not see, but he perfectly heard how Su Lin, standing next to him, screamed in fright, and other spectators immediately joined her, confirming his suspicions.
A black flower with almost transparent petals blossomed familiarly over the body, spreading out in all directions to dissolve again in the air into black ash from the first awkward movement. The Necromancer Hooper cried out in surprise, but immediately pulled herself together. John didn’t know what went wrong, but after the distraction of the flower, the runes created by Molly also scattered, as well as the pentagram going out.
If this was the very revelation that he should have heard, it did not tell him anything. Well, he had known from the very beginning that he shouldn’t have expected more, or that he wouldn’t be given any ready-made answers, so he decided to ask about what he had actually come to this Temple for.
I am so sorry for disappearing the way I did on LeAglani, all of you, and on Sandal Ash, (myself as well). It wasn’t my intent to disappear the way I did, but grief and depression overwhelmed me for a while, and I struggled to get back on my feet. I’m back, hopefully to stay, and not disappear like that again. I feel terrible for disappearing so abruptly and being missing in action. I can’t promise crazy fast updates of the next few chapters, but I can promise to be steadier in sending back chapters to LeAglani.
Abruptly the ritual ended as suddenly as it had begun. The pressure disappeared; there was no more of a force knocking them down, just as there was no more otherworldly presence.
“I have learned that courses are being held at your Temple for beginning Seers. Can I sign up if it's still up to date?”
Anthea took out the phone again, quickly flipped through the base of pentagrams, after which she drew several transfer runes in the air, and the most interesting thing began - the artifacts in the room sang loudly, starting to activate, the security ligature of the runes rang and trembled while the air around them began to slowly thicken. There was a breath of warmth in his face disturbing his hair, and John sighed in admiration beside him.
“You are right, this is a unique place. An underground source runs deep below us, which intertwines with another source of power, and this gives the effect of purification. We are lucky that this is in the outskirts, and not the most prosperous area. Although with the factory closed for a long time, this place doesn’t attract developers, which means that they don’t touch us either.”
“It was murder. And this is a message,” John really saw someone's ominous message in the strange arrangement of the body on the bed, in the arrangement of visible artifacts and runes and in the sealed magic. Catching Holmes' approval, he continued, “I don’t know how to read it, you probably need something like a key, or a code word, but Mr. Wang Kun definitely didn’t die of his own free will.”
“Okay… Ah, thanks. And thank you for the gift, too.” He rubbed the earring out of habit and smiled, “I apologize for not thanking you earlier, there was no suitable opportunity.”
Moreover, his family had a sad experience of dealing with such religious organizations. When his parents were alive, the Watson couple managed to spend a whole fortune on all sorts of fraudsters who promised them the salvation of the allegedly lost soul of their youngest daughter. While John was being shot at on the hot plains of Afghanistan, his sister fought her own battle against the prejudices of her own family. It wasn’t even surprising that it all ended with tinctures and elixirs, in which she saw her only salvation. He could frankly admit to himself that he had completely failed as an older brother. Therefore, although the somewhat obsessive care of Mycroft Holmes never caused him rejection or irritation, unlike Sherlock. For his part, he perfectly understood Holmes senior.
John perfectly remembered his training in childhood and the first lessons, and the first independent steps in knowing his capabilities. These were bright memories that had nothing to do with the current depressing atmosphere of despondency and fear.
I personally love this chap))) I think it show more about boys and their interactions with each other)) and also I like the whole scene here as well as a way to know more about this world
Leaving the Exchange, they smoothly merged into a mass of people and deftly emerged from it at the very edge of the sidewalk. Holmes habitually brushed aside several carriages until a black compact car pulled up in front of them. By tacit agreement, they now only used cabs, pre-checking them for traps.
Under his feet, as soon as he moved just a little, faint flashes scattered. The crystal-encrusted floor reacted to his slightest movement, glowing and shimmering. Out of curiosity, he pressed his foot down lightly, and for his efforts, golden sparks flew in all directions, running over the beautiful pattern of curls and going out to somewhere under the table near the window. He could hardly restrain himself from repeating it again, so fascinating was the process. Imagining how beautiful it would be to dance on such a floor, he was immediately drawn to take a few more steps. Imperceptibly looking around, he nevertheless stepped several times to the side and forward, imitating the dance steps he had once learned a long time ago for a prom, all in order to not lose face in front of his then girlfriend, Winona Siment. Though the movements from that time were long forgotten, he clearly remembered the feelings of aching joy, love, and a thin, girlish waist under his palms. And now, watching the cheerful golden sparks, he could only recall that carefree time with nostalgia.
Throwing open the door nonchalantly, John already knew that it would not be Tony, from a Chinese restaurant two blocks from Baker Street, waiting for him on the other side. And the foreboding of trouble did not fail him, but he did not even have time to dodge the stunning spell that flew at him. Falling into the embrace of deaf unconsciousness, he only had time to think that at least Su Ling Yao was safe behind the protective barrier of their guard runes. The main thing was that the girl didn’t jump out after him, realizing that something had happened, as the skull, no longer fueled by his magic, didn’t answer her.
Ah, well, of course, how he could forget. John closed his eyes for a moment. The reputation of a dark mage sometimes played into their hands, often helping in investigations, but not in moments like this. He did not want to lie, but the situation was rather delicate, and not in his favor, so he decided to soothe his temporary Inspector a little.
“There, you are wrong. This place is exactly what I need to fully adapt to a peaceful life,” he slightly twisted his words, he didn’t see any harm in some distortion of reality.
John swallowed; he really had nothing to argue. He thought he had been pretending well, but the street kids were always much smarter and more attentive than the simpler other children their age. And if guys like Patrick were part of the Holmes Homeless Army, about which he had only a faint idea until recently, then it was understandable why Sherlock, though sparingly, always praised his little informants. Even in spite of the local ancient and mysterious artifact, he found his Balance amazingly quickly - a few days of meditation and a couple of exercises were enough. And now he no longer risked harming himself or those around him by letting a glowing stream of magic flow through him.
“The Black Lotus is the unofficial name of a religious sect that has recently appeared in the territory of magical Britain, which came to us from Asia. According to unofficial reports, this is one of the oldest and largest criminal syndicates in China, associated with the smuggling and illegal trade of rare artifacts,” Holmes' velvet baritone told him. John peered into such a familiar pale face with irregular proportions and was glad to see that the dark mage again resembled himself, and not a living corpse.
The elevator finally released them on the right floor, and he, obediently, followed the pensive Holmes. On the light walls of the spacious corridor were rare paintings. With surprise, John recognized them to be artifacts from the famous Royal Collection. He could definitely use a couple of them, or at least one of the artifacts for personal reasons. Though it might be that even the rarest and most powerful of artifacts would be practically useless to help his young acquaintances, to whom he made a promise to, and intended to keep.
“Sherlock, I understand you’re worried. If something suspicious happens, or something attracts my attention, I will most definitely tell you.” He pursed his lips, and tilted his head a little to one side. If Holmes truly managed to make a study of him, as he’d told him about it more than once during the time that they were partners and living together, then he should know perfectly well what this gesture meant.
“Artifactist Su Lin Yao. Nice to meet you, John talks about you a lot about you. Didn't know you would accompany us tonight.”
(2) Kesa is the traditional dress of Buddhist monks and Hindu sannyasis. This term is usually referred to brown or saffron-colored clothing; in Sanskrit and Pali there is the word cīvara, which denotes such clothes regardless of color. The details of the kesa, which, according to legend, is a set of items of clothing for the Buddha, may differ slightly depending on the particular school of Buddhism, but there are always three garments in it: antarvasa (underwear, analogue of underwear), uttarasanga (outerwear) and samghati (additional cape-mantle);
Deciding not to engage in controversy, John tried to regain his own hand, but it was not so easy to free the sleeve so cleverly captured. Suddenly, right before his eyes, familiar black leaflets shook until they scattered around them like mourning fans.
The light walls, soft, light sofas, and light furniture didn’t align with the Necromancer, who, even in clothes, clearly preferred only the darker tones. Not to mention, the magic spilling into the room was alien to any dark mage. The office currently occupied by Mycroft Holmes did not correlate with him at all; therefore, the conclusion about the identity of the owner of the office was obvious.
New Monday - new chapter))) have a good time reading)) comments and your thoughts on what is happening with boys are always welcome)
With the thin book in hand, and in high spirits from such a successful purchase, John hurried to the hospital. His first day on the job didn’t promise to be busy or difficult, but it didn’t matter. He couldn’t even remember the last time he could legally, without looking back in wariness at the Agents of the Ministry, apply his knowledge and skills in practice. And thus far, even if it was something simple in form, such as treating a cold or flu, he had indeed managed to miss such simple tasks desperately.
John ran a hand through his hair in frustration  and sighed. He didn’t know how to explain to a sincerely perplexed dark mage that he was upset by such a trifle as unjustified expectations. It was stupid, and he was perfectly well aware many times over and in detail, how Holmes did not tolerate other people's stupidity.
At home awaited an instant dinner, a purification ritual that could not be postponed any further, and an entertaining reading of the new forum on dreams he found on the Internet. And this, of course, was dependent on the event that Holmes did not decide, in his usual unpredictable manner, to make his own adjustments to his plans, and, seemingly, he would have to once again postpone the purification for an unclear time. His phone display glowed cheerfully with a short message from his partner.
He couldn’t explain why the temptation to go into this particular bookstore or walk up to the corner where the shabby books and textbooks at bargain prices were collected. But he had the steadfast impression that he was being led, as if an unknown hand was pulling to come up and leaf through the old volumes and brochures left by someone. Even in such heaps, one could find a real treasure, and with hope, ran his fingers along the old spines or shifting one book to another to get to the lowest ones.
“I see black flowers,” Now wherever he looked, he saw these strange blooms. They, like a cancerous tumor, spread throughout the valley, threatening to spread to the mountain ranges and stain their whiteness.
“John!” an impatient shout reminded him that they had come here on business. He smiled at the witch and hastened to approach the dark mage, already bent over the body. From experience, he knew perfectly well that it was not worth keeping him waiting or being distracted, exacerbating Sherlock’s malcontent. Now he had to manage, somehow, to combine the two works, succeed on both and not lose face.
And that, was already quite the amusing, interesting, and, perhaps, not even an accidental coincidence. Recently, John had stopped believing altogether, in any accidents.
“I didn't think he'd get ahead of me, but,” Sherlock carefully took his hand, still clutching the black box, and turned it from side to side, looking closely. “It's a good gift. This time Mycroft turned out to be useful in some way, you can safely use it.”
Sherlock pressed his lips to the hot pads for a moment and smiled at the corners of his lips, pulling away - he had waited so long, so he could wait a little longer. Moreover, John, without even realizing it, presented him with another riddle. Sherlock felt an unnatural heat under his palm, pressed against his back under the thin blanket. The strange pentagrams had to be scrutinized and analyzed, perhaps even with the help of Mycroft.
An echoing silence hung around him, broken only by his quiet steps. No random passers-by, no extraneous sounds, as if he were walking in a vacuum. His instincts screamed at him to speed up his pace so that he could quickly find himself in the illuminated section of the street, which suddenly seemed so far and dim.
“Why did we stop?” Only if he wanted to, John could sense Sherlock's indignation when Holmes finally looked up from typing out another text. He had made sure that the cab stopped in front of a bright sign promising fast service and delicious business lunches. An aura, not hidden by anything yet, went with familiar dark green flashes, foreshadowing discontent.
Feeling somewhat deceived, John hurried after Holmes, who had already entered the glass elevator and was now frowning at him.
John, as with the case of Inspector Dimmock, immediately became alert. It didn't seem like Miss Sawyer knew anything about Sherlock Holmes though. He had a reputation in certain circles, but he strongly doubted that average Healers would know that much, if they’ve even heard of Sherlock.
Also John only has a vague idea of what the Artifact Exchange is, and indeed, what the Exchange in general is, so his expectations as an ordinary citizen were really quite far from the reality.
He had never before attempted, of his own initiative, to share power with someone, and though his idea was somewhat different from the traditional notion of Separation (1), he needed to be sure that he could succeed before giving the children false hope.
An unmade bed and a mess in the bedroom did not prevent the attacker from performing his ritual and successfully disguising him as suicide.
The bell rang down below distracted him from discussing one of their latest cases, which he called to himself “The Case of Shadows Stealing Light” (1).
The witch looked around in a businesslike manner and selected a cup filled with freshly brewed tea and dripped a few drops of it into the chalk. Sherlock noted to himself that Anteya did not even need to add at least something else, which meant that the pentagram was not needed for more than a couple of minutes. He himself disliked painting, except for rare and intriguing exceptions, such as creating a portal for John (1). Sherlock preferred to use ready-made drawings, activating them directly on paper, or working with what someone created and painted for him.
“Sherlock was infuriated after talking with Wilkes, and you weren't there to brighten up his day and cheer him up. That slippery guy only thinks for his own benefit. Imagine! He said that he wouldn’t give Sherlock access to the Vault, since there is no reason to believe that something was stolen. What then began! I was afraid that he would destroy half the room in a rage.”
“It’s really quite possible. Why do you think they also needed to create a sect, even calling it that way?” It was a rhetorical question, so he didn’t even try to answer, just getting ready to listen to Holmes’ theory on this matter. He had a couple of ideas, but Sherlock was almost never wrong, and John tended to trust his opinion more than his own in such matters.
John only had to agree with everything that was said, he still didn’t have any sensible ideas. Moreover, now he was worried about another equally important question.
They stood very close to each other, and the dark mage didn’t even think to move away, as if his invasion of someone else’s personal space was something to take for granted for him. If you think so, it was. And if usually those to whom he approached so closely preferred to flee, John never gave up his position, preferring to watch and wait.
He didn’t even need to close his eyes, so that in his mental map, amidst all the interweaving of spells and pulsations of magic, he could easily see the glowing points of still weakly formed auras. Some shone brighter, some weaker, and there were practically no colored flashes, which should have appeared much later as they grew up and entered adulthood.
“What did I see?” He shouted somewhere into the endless sky, waking up. But the room, as expected, answered him with silence, filled only with his convulsive breathing. John leaned wearily back on the pillow and after a minute, pulled out a small notepad from under it, which he kept for convenience just for such occasions.
“Brian Lukis. A freelance journalist,” Sherlock replied, displeased, still looking at him suspiciously.
“I'm ready,” John pulled back the bottom of his jacket and shrugged uncertainly. He even tied a tie, although he could not stand them, and now and then his hands reached for this narrow piece of fabric to loosen or tighten the knot, as if he could not decide how he was more comfortable. John really couldn't make up his mind.
The speaker was an elderly Chinese woman. She more than compensated her small stature and delicate build with her voice and imperious manner of speaking. But her somewhat patronizing tone seemed to bother only him; even in the meager lighting here, he could clearly see the respect frozen in the faces around him. He had the impression that only he alone came unprepared, but was nevertheless allowed to pass without hindrance, though he was clearly quite different from the locals, and thus quite conspicuous.
The boy was noticeably worried, as his brown eyes cautiously, quickly looked around before he decided to lean closer to him.
“The way he so easily entered the apartments, arranging rituals like suicide, and then, just as easily, without leaving a trace, disappeared. Already it speaks in favor of the theory that he is not quite human. And the words of your Witch-Artifactist about the messages in the form of Hanzi finally confirmed this. And why you can see them is another question, the answer to which we will undoubtedly receive when we solve this case.”
The arrival of the brother with his constant assistant caught only Artifactist Su Lin by surprise, who, it seemed, did not expect the appearance of a Necromancer of Mycroft's level in ordinary London apartments. Still, as a half-breed, she could see a little more than all other mages could usually see, so it wasn’t surprising that the girl squeezed into John's favorite chair and sat motionlessly, afraid to attract attention. Although this did not stop her now and then from throwing admiring and interested glances at Anthea, however, Sherlock immediately deleted this information as unnecessary. Much more interesting was Mycroft's reaction to the strange signs, but he was disgustingly closed, not giving the slightest chance to read himself.
The house was asleep, and even his sudden awakening did not disturb the applied ward runes or energy accumulation runes. He was not in danger, which meant that the complex system of runic tying, which he and Holmes had built together, did not give an alarm signal to either Holmes or Lestrade. Nor Mycroft Holmes, as John strongly suspected.
And now the young inexperienced Inspector voiced the conclusion laying on the surface,  in which he was not alone. Even Lestrade raised his hands in agreement in a soothing gesture, but prudently said nothing.
Another corpse and another obscure message. Well, their investigation really promised to be unforgettable.
Watching the chaotic unexpected movements of the dark mage was informative, and John, without any surreptitiousness, enjoyed his process. Sometimes, John clearly saw the complex net of runes, and sometimes could only vaguely guess about their presence, so adroitly were they hidden from any inquisitive gaze, while Sherlock easily glided along the edge of their webs, teasingly touching with the tips of his long fingers.
“Sherlock, where are we?” Afraid to break the silence here, whispered John, grabbing Holmes by the sleeve of his coat and pulling him towards him.
“Thanks for the praise, I hope I won’t have a reason to disappoint you… Though I am worried that unexpected calls from the Ministry won’t help with that.” There was no point in hiding it, moreover, during his interview, he’d already mentioned his other job. He only needed to prove himself to be an irreplaceable specialist so he would be forgiven for regular days off and occasionally skipping shifts.
The study of the signs was accompanied by intense silence on the part of Su Lin, and Sherlock, unlike John, could clearly see her face and the emotions reflected on it.
As soon as he took a seat in the farthest and darkest corner, a slight boy immediately sat down by him, the same mysterious acquaintance of Holmes, who had come to meet him at the station and silently lead him to the then, completely unfamiliar temple for the first time. Well, even with this, the dark mage was able to surprise him.
John winked at Su Lin and clapped his hands, pretending that what had happened was indeed part of the program. The witch, immediately understanding his hint, laughed with obvious relief and supported his idea:
“I don't know something?” John looked around in confusion at the Inspectors; they were clearly talking about something, even more - about something specific.
The dark shadow in Holmes' left hand thrashed desperately, trying to break free from his steel grip. John could see everything perfectly, and he even remotely began to understand what was happening until Sherlock forcibly shoved the resisting soul back into the body it had abandoned.
(1) "Pillow" technique - as the name suggests, a lucid dreaming technique based on different shapes, sizes and number of sleep pillows, with which you can learn to control sleep phases, the degree of sleep immersion, and more.
“Yes and no... I can look there, but I don't always know what is true and what is a figment of my imagination... I am just an ordinary Seer.”
, he hoped she thought so too, he hoped she was enjoying herself. She certainly seemed to be, she was taking his shirt off now, all the evidence seemed to suggest… (
, sweet little licks and sips, changing the angle, changing the approach, not pushing, not plunging.
barefoot. (Sherlock’s mind supplies the adverb without his consent. It is nonsensical and also completely accurate.) Defiantly barefoot.
Suffice it to say that John’s relationship with physical contact has not been unproblematic for some time.
“I love you, too, John.” He let the moment stretch a little longer. Then, because he was still Sherlock no matter what went where: “All sorted now? Good. Now will you please, please,
it – and I’m just checking now if there’s anything else. Now that we've cleared up the last little…misunderstanding.”
When Sherlock finally wraps his hand around John’s erection, the two of them are moving in such perfect unison that Sherlock thinks for a moment he feels the warm pressure of his palm on his own cock. A second later he realises, dimly, that it must be John’s body he feels, tightening around him in response to the squeeze of his hand. He doesn’t need to move his hand, only to hold it still, as the movement of his hips pushes John’s cock deep into his fist.
“So’re you,” John slurred, still not opening her eyes. She stretched contentedly under the ghost of Sherlock’s touch, groggy with pleasure. “You could do that to me all night.”
, Sherlock’s thigh was hard up between John’s trembling legs, very deliberately pressing on John’s cock, and still John was wondering what was allowed.
He can almost feel the press of a broad back against his own chest, the warmth of smooth skin against the tips of his fingers. He can almost smell the warm neck, the heat of a familiar body.
He puts his lessons to good use with John, and he is glad at how thoroughly he has learned them. If he were to fling himself at John and be – not rejected, John would be scrupulously  kind about it – rebuffed, however gently, he does not think he could bear it.
