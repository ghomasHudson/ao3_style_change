“Why did you stop?” Sherlock asked.
“You’re ridiculous,” John rested his head against Sherlock’s collarbone, shoulders shaking with laughter. “God, you’re sweet.”
“I didn’t want to confess yet,” he shrugged.
He felt a little nervous, fearing he’d slip up. “It’s a hunch. I had a girlfriend up until a couple days ago. I broke up with her, and she seemed to think it was because I wanted to live with Sherlock instead of her. Maybe it was revenge.”
“No. To be honest, John, she always rubbed me the wrong way. I didn’t want to tell you before, of course.”
“Go and check.”
Sherlock smirked. “Yes, we are.”
“Hey, hey,” he shushed, taking Sherlock’s hands under the blankets. “Calm down before you start having a panic attack, okay? I know she’s probably a bloody psychopath. I know. But she’s not unstoppable, right? She’s just a person.” He cleared his throat. “She was able to hurt you before because we didn’t know she was like that, but now we do.”
Culverton walked closer to the bed, resting a gloved hand on one of the rails. “We can make it look like an accident. If you increase the dosage four or five times,” he referred to the saline being shot into Sherlock’s bloodstream, “it would knock you out in about a half hour. Then, I restore the settings. People would think you just gave up the ghost.”
to hear you make noise. There’s nothing wrong with it. It doesn’t turn you into an idiot. It doesn’t make you any less you.”
Something pulled John out of sleep. He sat up in bed, bleary-eyed and confused. The room was dark, the neon numbers on the clock on top of the bedside table revealing it was 4:37 in the morning. He didn’t have any nightmares, so that couldn’t have woken him up. John strained his ears. He heard something small, the slightest bit of sound. But, Sherlock was downstairs, and it wasn’t unusual for him to be moving around late at night. That was what he told himself, but his heart was pounding, dread encircling his gut.
But the line of Sherlock’s mouth remained firm and puzzled. “It isn’t just that, though. I wanted to thank you for everything--since I came back. As you know, I underestimated how much I hurt you, and when you ran out of the restaurant the night I came back, I feared you wouldn’t forgive me.”
“It’s really no trouble,” she waved her hand. “I would have written on the large cake, too, but ‘Rosamund’ is a little long to write out, and my hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, dear.”
“I don’t know what to do,” he admitted weakly, looking down at the carpet. He was a forty year-old virgin. He was laughable.
John chuckled, placing his hand directly over Sherlock’s heart. “Get used to it.”
“Sherlock,” he said softly, “it’s okay. Sex isn’t difficult. You just do what feels good, listen to your body. It isn’t a science.”
“That’s…”
“I’m flattered,” John said smugly.
“You’re hungry.”
he replied.
John came back inside with a water bottle in his hand. “Here you go,” he held it out to Sherlock.
Sherlock huffed in annoyance at the nickname. John hadn’t heard that name for Mycroft before, but it seemed to hit a nerve with Sherlock for some reason. “Same as ever,” Sherlock said curtly.
John swallowed. “How’s your pain level?”
That did matter, but John wanted to hurt the man who did this to Sherlock. “But--”
“It’s...not that,” he said completely unconvincingly.
Sherlock frowned. “I enjoy touching you,” he felt the need to say.
But, if John and Mary divorced, he might move back in with Sherlock.
Sherlock’s entire body stiffened, his eyes widened, and John felt his balls tighten. With a long, deep
John let go of him and looked at his hand. Well, he needed a moist towelette. He looked down at Sherlock’s thighs. Oh. He made a mess. Before he could move to get up and grab something to wipe them off, Sherlock flipped around with glassy, wide eyes and threw his arms around him.
“More or less,” Sherlock looked up at him with a slightly pained grin, his chin on John’s chest and arms around his middle. “Worth it.”
Hey thank you all so much for all of the kudos!!! I never got that many for one chapter before :)
Sherlock started laughing, low and deep and sweet. He always cheered up when John started bashing Mycroft. “I’d like to see that,” he chuckled. He pulled his face back a little, grinning, face no longer too pale, a healthy flush on his face. “I was right earlier, you know. You do keep me right.”
“It’ll do,” John muttered, and was grateful when the liquid left a hot trail down his throat.
They stared at each other. John looked caught between being angry and amused.
Irene took a couple more steps down the stairs. “You should have told him.”
The image of Mary’s soulless eyes and gun made him screw his eyes shut, and he hated himself for fearing that damned woman. His right hand was bunched around the quilt, knuckles white, and he was trembling.
“Yeah,” John’s breath rushed out of him. “Yes, Sherlock. I want to touch you.”
Hey, you still want to help out with that case?
Sherlock hated going to John and Mary’s house.
John lifted his head, gritting his teeth. “What?” he barked.
John’s hand ran over his skin gently. “It’s nothing big, really, but remember when you fell asleep on my shoulder?”
Sherlock pursed his lips. “I’m sorry.”
“No, I think we should,” she crossed her arms. “Sherlock’s supposed to be a genius, right? If he hears us having a serious conversation, he won’t come in and interrupt.”
“Just shut up and have your minions help,” Sherlock growled into the phone. He had panicked when he remembered he didn’t live with him anymore, and almost slipped and fell when he ran out of the shower with wet feet. Surely not living together would be a red flag to John since they were supposed to be married. He would just have to act like John never moved out.
John curled his hand around him as best as he could, the position a little uncomfortable for his wrist. “Can you pull your pants down a little?” he asked, removing his knee from in between Sherlock’s legs.
He swallowed hard, imprinting the sensation of John’s palms on his face to his brain. Why couldn’t they have done this sooner? Why did he have to be with John like this?
John thought to himself, the image of Sherlock blowing Magnussen’s brains out flashing before his eyes.
Sherlock came back in, dressing gown firmly ties around his waist. He looked at them. “What’s wrong?”
"Did you ever like anyone before?"
“Hello,” John smiled. “Comfortable?”
He swallowed. “Yes. This was a good idea, John.”
She must have figured she had nothing to worry about, if she got John back after attempting to murder his best friend. A part of John thought that, well, she was kind of right to think that. If he went back to her after committing that type of crime, then was she really that arrogant for thinking he would never leave her? Maybe she did know him better than he thought, after all, thinking back to when he felt angry over her presumptuous tone in her posthumous DVDs.
“When?” Sherlock asked quickly.
Sherlock was cold and his his heart was tingling with anxiety. She was right, though. He acted like he was cynical, but he thought a former assassin who tried to kill him before would have let him off the hook. He swallowed. “You’re going to kill me,” he whispered.
with all that shit. I’m tired of being upset about everything every day.” Hs thumb brushed over his knuckles.
This time, Sherlock was standing by the window, and Rosie was in his arms. She was crying, chubby cheeks red and wet. She was clutching Sherlock’s T-shirt as he pointlessly rocked her, his own face filled with dismay. Her crying was the first bit of noise to make it into a dream, and it was terrible. It had been so long since John had seen a glimpse of her, having no pictures of a non existent child, and he hated seeing her like this. They were alone in the flat. Where was he in this? Why did Sherlock have Rosie, and John wasn’t there?
John was reminded, with horror, that Sherlock was still suffering from PTSD from his time away. Last time this happened, it was several months after his return. John knew PTSD didn’t usually disappear within that time, but he must have felt significantly better, because even though Sherlock was good at hiding his emotions, John didn’t think he would have been able to hide
John’s frown grew deeper. “I know now, but...I’m still in the mindset that you just came back from the dead, so that’s making things hard, too. I’m really glad you’re here, but I’m torn between wanting to kiss you and punch you in the face.”
Sherlock kissed the top of his head. Come to think of it, he really did want to hold John in his lap. “John, it’s a little tight. I think it would be easier if I were Father Christmas.”
They left the park in loaded silence and hailed a cab, and Sherlock spent the ride staring out the window, trying not to tear up. What had he expected, for John to open his arms and embrace Sherlock in the middle of the park? No, but the almost non-response felt worse than outright rejection in a way. He didn’t let himself think. He couldn’t lose his composure. He couldn’t feel right now, and he certainly couldn’t look at John.
John giggled, the corners of his eyes crinkling, and he hadn’t looked so happy since before Mary’s death. “I guess I am, aren’t I?”
She did nothing but lie to John about her entire identity since the day they met, then tried to murder the man who offered to help her, and John
“I can tell. I’m surprised he’s forgiven you so easily, to be honest,” she said casually. “He’s not exactly known for his calm temper.”
John didn’t anticipate how satisfying this would be.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but was smirking, too.
He wouldn’t even ask how he knew it was on low battery. “Thanks, I will.”
John came back downstairs after setting her down, frowning down at his shirt. “Well, I was gonna shower anyway.”
John grinned at him, face soft in the morning sunlight. “Hey.”
“I do,” John said, rolling up his sleeves. “Get undressed and I’ll be right there.” Well, that was a sentence he’d always wanted to say in a different context. Regardless, he got everything he needed and, like the previous two nights, sat behind Sherlock on the sofa. He was glad to see the wounds were still on the right track for healing, although they remained deep.
And fuck, Sherlock thanking him for simply calling him a good person was too much. John hugged him back, wrapping his arms around his torso, and it was the first time they shared a proper hug in the five years since they met. He felt Sherlock stiffen momentarily, but then he relaxed, and John felt him release a tiny sigh.
However, John didn’t bite his lips very often; he licked them. That, combined with the position of the mark at the corner of his mouth, an odd spot to bite one’s lip, told Sherlock that someone
But the chance to tell Sherlock was gone before he knew it, thrown away when Sherlock hit the sidewalk in front of St. Bart’s, and that was what John regretted the most about his life. He missed his chance. He had been so afraid of rejection, so convinced that Sherlock didn’t feel things that way (maybe he really didn’t? John still didn’t know), that he kept it all inside, thinking that maybe, down the road, they could work things out. John thought he had all the time in the world. Even if he never told Sherlock, John thought they would have been able to happily live together for the rest of their days, and although he would have been harboring unrequited feelings, John would have spent his life with Sherlock on strictly platonic grounds in a heartbeat.
John lay back on the pillows, rubbing his face. “God, that was uncomfortable.”
“You’re not,” John said. “And you never told
Sherlock looked uncertain. “Your old flat, will you sell it?”
“Yes.”
An uncomfortable moment of silence. John’s eyebrows were set in a deep furrow, and Sherlock wanted to smooth out the tension with his thumb.
Although he feared he made things worse, John was pleased to see Sherlock in higher spirits the next day, at least as much as he could be in his condition. Sherlock initiated conversation, and there was a softness around the corners of his mouth. When John was sitting on the sofa, Sherlock sat down next to him, their thighs nearly close enough to touch, and he nearly slumped over onto John’s shoulder from the morphine.
Sherlock kept his eyes downcast.
Whether he was about to climax anyway or the unexpected pet name pushed him over the edge, he didn’t know, but suddenly the bubble of pleasure burst and he was coming hard, his eyes opening widely, seeing stars, shouting. John’s thrusts were erratic and hard, and then he was coming, a loud moan tearing out of his throat. With their foreheads together, Sherlock couldn’t fully see John’s face as he came, and for that, he was regretful. But it didn’t bother him much at all, because he felt the hot burst of John’s semen on him, and simply hearing his moans and harsh breaths during his climax was enough.
“But, why are you in a suit?”
“I can’t,” John threw up his hands. “You know what? I can’t deal with it right now. It’s too much to process.” He needed to get out of here. He couldn’t bear to look at Sherlock any longer, or be in the same building with the bloody Woman. He married the person who tried to kill them both once, and worked for the man who tried to kill Sherlock, and then tried to kill him herself. He was a fool. God damn it, he was a fucking fool for thinking she ever loved him. As much as he tried to deny it, he deserved Irene’s judgment.
John suddenly wanted to wake up from this universe.
“Yeah,” she whispered back, conscious of Sherlock’s (and Irene’s) hawk-like observation skills. “It’s just--what’s she doing here? I came in and got no explanation--”
John felt himself leaking in his own pants, and he needed to drive Sherlock over the edge. He sucked, hollowing his cheeks, and took his hand off Sherlock’s cock and cupped his bollocks, pressing his thumb into his perineum.
Sherlock laughed, “I’m only observing.”
Sherlock felt angry that this man was able to get away with murder for god-knows how long, only because of his money. This was the moment of irrefutable proof, though, that would be used against him once the police listened to the recording device in John’s cane.
Sherlock wiped his eyes with his hand. “It must have fallen out of my pocket when Mary dragged me to her car.” Wait. “Where’s my coat?”
Sherlock gave him a long blink, like a cat. “You said you’re breaking up with Mary,” he said. “So you’ll have to find somewhere to live.”
John’s face was hot with humiliation. “I thought he was
Sherlock’s grin faded. “I only wish this feeling of hesitation would go away. I don’t want to hesitate, but,” the helplessness filled his eyes again. “Why am I like this?” he asked in frustration.
She stared at him for a moment. “It’s just that easy for you. Walk away from everything we had move back to this flat.”
Rosie cooed and started tugging at one of  Sherlock’s earlobes. She wasn’t asleep, then.
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s, and a more serious, unreadable expression took over his face.
John looked down, almost bashfully, then looked back up. “So, um, any plans for tonight?”
“Easy there,” John soothed with a peck to his cheekbone. “Easy.”
“What do you mean?” Sherlock asked, hesitating to pull his pants down.
“Mary won’t have a single trace left in our lives, then.” He scrubbed a hand over his face. “I’m going to remember the shit she did, and I can never fully forget her because of Rosie, but I want to move on. I’m still pissed and wish she were alive just so I could tell her off, but I’m tired of her upsetting me.” John looked down at his finger, as the tan line left by the ring. Was the ring still in his room, where he’d thrown it last night? He had to do something about that. He’d bin it later. “Like I said, I’m still angry, but I consider her a part of my--our--lives that’s over. Can we leave her behind, with the rest of last year? I’m--god, I’m tired of thinking about her.”
John leaned back on the pillow, looking him up and down. “This is still so surreal to me. It’s like I woke up in a different reality.” He sighed a little. “I guess it’s weird for you, too, right?”
In any case, John felt like he had done so much wrong that he didn’t know how to make any of it right. With Rosie, he was less worried about turning things around. He was going to be there for her and stop dropping her off at the homes of everyone he knew. He was a father now, god damn it, and he was determined to care for her. His Rosie, not
“Yeah.”
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
Ah, so a gash was there.
“Mhmm,” he mumbled. “You’re warm,” he said into his neck.
In his bedroom, he looked at himself in the mirror. He wore a fake white beard with a long, white wig under a wool cap, sunglasses, and a brown trenchcoat. It was good enough. He just needed to look enough like someone else so the receptionist wouldn’t recognize him when he came in as himself with his injured hand. He put his own coat in a brown paper bag along with an empty glass bottle and left his flat with the roses.
“I’m fine,” he protested weakly.
“Oh,” he let go of his clothes. “I thought this would be easier.”
John held back a moan of his own and stroked Sherlock faster, from root to tip, rubbing his thumb over the head. Sherlock let out a small whimper, seemed to catch himself, and buried his face even further into John’s skin, and John could feel the heat from his blush.
His eyes were shy and his voice was muffled behind his hand. “I’d imagine you behind me--we’re both lying on our sides--and your hand is around me.”
Sherlock frowned deeply and he moved to comfort him. “John, please--”
“No, wait. How are you not in jail right now?”
“Smart,” Sherlock said, walking up next to John.
Sherlock blinked quickly, causing more tears to fall, and his frown deepened. “I think--I want--you to hug me?” he asked hesitantly, sounding completely unsure.
“You carried those with you?” Sherlock asked in amusement, eyes scanning the home, and he had a feeling he knew the answer to the case already.
John sat down next to Rosie after they were alone, putting his head in his hands with a groan. “Oh god, that’s it, isn’t it? Mary’s gone, but Irene’s here. She’ll be the woman in his life--our lives.”
“Okay, well keep me posted. See you later.”
A heavy feeling filled his chest. He knew it was a rhetorical question. His throat felt clogged nonetheless. He placed a chaste kiss on his lips. “I love you.”
I considered breaking this into 2 parts, but I really wanted to get this done, especially because you waited for over a month.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed. “What? Why?”
“Who?” Sherlock asked casually.
“But what did you think would happen when you came back?” Some of the old anger was starting to rear its ugly head. “Did you think I’d just be sitting at Baker Street, staring at your empty chair because apparently I have no fucking life of my own?”
“Sherlock, she’s only one!” John laughed. “You’re acting like a mother hen.”
He placed one gloved hand over Sherlock’s mouth, and the other over his nose, and pressed down hard. Sherlock’s instincts flared and his hands flew to Culverton’s hands, gripping them, his legs starting to kick and flail under the sheet. The latex was smothering him, his throat was so tight it hurt, and his chest was on
“No,” he replied. “I intend to find out, though,” he said seriously.
Lestrade shook his head with a harsh sigh. “Stubborn bastard. Course he would make things worse for himself.”
“Sherlock?” John addressed him, voice tight.
Hey, all. Thanks to those who commented and said they hoped I feel better. Well, I was upset because I had heard spoilers from the finale and I wasn't pleased, and actually seeing it...yeah, I only felt worse :P I won't go on about it here. If you want to talk, stop by my tumblr (obsessivelollipoplalala). I am feeling a little better now, though. I'll always love this show and this pairing.
John was stunned. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock crossed his leg over his knee. “No, your nose is too big for that.”
Also, I just wrote a story where Culverton Smith forces Sherlock to say he loves John instead of saying he doesn't want to die. It's called
“You know where to find me,” he said, walking out of the kitchen. He looked down at Rosie. “I’ll see you later.”
John nodded, absorbing all of this. “That’s huge. I wish I remembered more of it. Wait, did you trick me in the train car?”
“You’ve got to get that frown off your face,” John said, removing his hand from under Sherlock’s and gently grasping his chin. “I don’t like seeing you this bothered.”
Sherlock was in his chair, a sullen pout on his lips, plucking at his violin. “Hm?”
Sherlock’s eyes cautiously met his. “John, did you believe I never thought of you?”
,” he said hoarsely.
Sherlock’s mind was sluggish, and he couldn’t think of a response before his body shook from the cold water.
“Can we not talk about that?” He didn’t like dwelling on his moments of weakness, and he couldn’t even tell Sherlock all of the reasons why he was crying.
Although, John was right. No one interfered with Sherlock’s work before. Well, before John.
In the early afternoon, they were on Sherlock’s (much bigger) bed, kissing softly. They were lying on their sides, and Sherlock was cradling his face. John never really knew just how large Sherlock’s hands were, how strong and masculine, until he felt them on his skin. He loved it. They were kissing slowly, tenderly, their lips gliding together wetly, little smacking noises filling the room. John’s left hand was tangled in Sherlock’s curls, loving that he finally got to touch his hair. It was ridiculously soft, and John wondered if he liked his hair pulled. He wouldn’t try it now, though, not when things were new and delicate.
“What time is it?” John asked, looking up at him with puffy eyes.
There was shifting behind him, rousing Sherlock out of a deep sleep. His limbs were warm and heavy and two weeks of little sleep were tugging him back into slumber. But he couldn’t brush off the feeling of the mattress dipping behind him. He rolled over on his back with a tired, confused groan, eyes still closed. Then, a hand was in his hair, brushing curls from his forehead. What?
Sherlock almost laughed. Did she think he was an idiot? No, even an idiot could see how suspicious this was. “An alley? How convenient,” he said sardonically.
“Mrs. Hudson hasn’t done my laundry yet,” Sherlock said defensively, sitting up.
The dream took place in their sitting room, but it was dark, quiet, and empty, save for Sherlock. He sitting down, elbow bent and on top of the arm of his chair, hand covering his eyes. It was unnervingly quiet. Sherlock only sat in his chair, alone, face in his hand, his ratty blue dressing gown hanging loosely off his shoulders. He breathed in deeply, shakily, lower lip trembling. It sounded like he was going to cry.
Sherlock grew tense beneath his hand, and he must have been thinking of the Fall. His eyes were piercing.
“I’m getting impatient,” Culverton said, and he raised his hands.
she smiled when they got in the cab while John was hurting and furious. The second time around, she was just as unsupportive. John shouldn’t have been shocked, but he was.
He blinked rapidly and put his hand in front of his mouth, embarrassed.  He wordlessly went to the bed and lay down on top of the covers, looking at him with anxious, expecting eyes.
“Whenever you’re ready,” John ran his thumb over his knuckles. “We’ll take things one step at a time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
have to wait for another day.
“Any weakness?”
Sherlock looked back at him again. “John, it was just a dream.”
He did this. He lost his temper
Sherlock’s breath quivered, and it was difficult to keep his voice steady. “It--hurt.”
“I’ll take you home,” Mycroft said.
the one who didn’t hit your head? You’re...nicer than I remember you.”
Sherlock’s toes curled and he knew he had never been this warm before. It felt like he was in a cocoon on blankets with John, their shared body heat radiating between them. John’s lips were warm, and when he parted them and coaxed Sherlock’s mouth open, he tasted of mint toothpaste. His movements were slow, but firm. He was kissing Sherlock to be languid, but not gentle. In between caresses, he sucked and nibbled on Sherlock’s lower lip. John moved his hand from his cheek and wrapped his arm around his waist.
Sherlock tilted his head to the side. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock felt himself smile. “People always give up after the number three. Must be comforting.” He looked at John.
“You know that’s a stupid question,” John put his elbow on the table and his cheek in his hand.
Sherlock was mortified, and he closed his eyes, clenching his jaw so it wouldn’t visibly tremble.
John was sweating, and his clothes felt uncomfortable against his skin and created friction with the sheets. He frowned and tugged at his shirt collar, wanting to cool himself down, and felt a tie. Wait he normally didn’t wear a tie to bed. John opened his eyes and saw the ceiling of his old bedroom at Baker Street.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, clearly trying to hold back a grin. “Hm, that needs to be fixed.”
Sherlock understood. “That’s how I feel.”  He looked at Rosie, at her innocent blue eyes staring at them, uncomprehending. “Let’s change topics. Back to your other memory, it was right after I returned from the dead. You were still angry with me, understandably, but came with me on a case. There was a terrorist plot on Guy Fawkes Night. The bomb in the train car was set to blow up the Houses of Parliament.”
“Open your eyes, please.”
“You know how hard it was for me, all those times?” John played with his hair. “You’d walk around in that damn sheet--the one we’re on top of right now--or sometimes on a case, we’d have to get close to hide, and it was hard for me not to touch you.” Okay, maybe that was oversharing.
Sherlock swallowed, closing his mouth, growing shy under John’s stare. He unzipped his trousers, and John watched him get naked in a daze. This was like something out of his dreams. How did this become his life?
The obligatory sex chapter
Actually, Sherlock said all he remembered was Mary saying a single sentence before he blacked out and fell to the floor. If he received the same wound last time, he must have fallen unconscious a few seconds after being shot, and couldn’t have possibly seen Mary call the cops.
John was lying next to him, but dressed in jeans and a jumper on top of the covers. He pulled his hand back, his face coloring slightly. “Hey,” he said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. “Um, sorry, didn’t mean to wake you.”
“Do you have to fix it? It’s funny that way.”
John smiled. “I liked your playing a lot. I’d missed it.”
“John,” Sherlock called his name.
But then, the pressure around his neck abruptly disappeared as he heard the front door slam open with a loud bang.
“Aww,” she pouted, “I wanted to see her again. Children amuse me.”
“In my pocket, moron,” Mary said, sounding bored. “I’d get them, but I can’t. You’ll have to.”
John just chuckled. “You’ve got me.”
left his lips between hard kisses. It was okay, though, because John said it was okay, and he, himself, was groaning into Sherlock’s mouth. They were both leaking, their semen serving as a lube and allowing their thrusts to become more frantic.
forgive you. You ruined our lives for too long.” He was talking about the other world, but couldn’t stop himself. “You
Sherlock waited for his response, and as the seconds passed by, he grew more disappointed. He was staring at John, but there was no more fire in his eyes. He looked tired. He sat down on the edge of the mattress. “So, I’m right. You wanted proof that I’m human. Well. Sorry to disappoint you.”
If you want to chat and see what else I'm up to, you can stop by my tumblr
He sent another bouquet to John on Tuesday, this time of lilies. John liked flowers once, so why not another time? Just two times, though. A third time would be pushing his luck. On Wednesday, he decided to go a little further and give John an expensive bottle of scotch, believing a box of chocolates would be ineffective considering he, himself, was the one with the sweet tooth. He attached a note to the neck of the bottle, typed so John wouldn’t see recognize his handwriting:
“Good. So, uh, you got any pictures of her? Do I have any on my phone?”
“I did, yeah.”
“I’m not doing enough--”
I figured you guys deserved a fluff chapter after 57,000 words of angst lol
That shattered every ounce of control John had. “Why?!” he shot up from his chair.
John went over and sat behind Sherlock, turning to his back. His hands were shaking. “I need to clean these. Have you taken care of them at all?”
John awoke to a voice shouting downstairs, so he jumped out of bed and ran downstairs, but his nerves calmed when he saw Lestrade and Sherlock standing in the sitting room.
They sat down at one of the tables outside of the cafe, Sherlock next to John, and Mary by herself on the other side of the table.
“I’m just saying. It’ll be fine. We’ll be here on Saturday, anyway. You were planning on having her here, right?”
right! You’re an assassin, for Christ’s sake.”
Sherlock was hurt and weak and his head was fuzzy, and he felt like he was going to pass out again. “John,” he whispered.
“I...actually forgot about that,” he said, and sighed. “Damn, I just washed myself.”
Sherlock whipped his head around. “I would never do such a thing to Rosie.” Honestly! The nerve!
Sherlock swallowed, looking groggy. “Fantastic,” he said dryly.
A pause. “Why?” he asked. He could faintly make out the sounds of the towel rubbing against Sherlock’s wet skin, and shit, it really was too hot in there.
John grabbed him by the shoulders. “Sherlock,” he said firmly, “calm down. You’re starting to panic. We have time. You don’t have to push yourself into this.”
“I’m tired,” Sherlock said, “and I can’t be arsed to see her.”
John snorted. “You’re disgusted? It’s your own spunk.”
Oh, and I have a
Sherlock wanted to laugh at that, but John’s expression stopped him. “Why not?”
“Why are you so nice to me?!” he threw his arms in the air. His face was getting hot. “Why are you so bloody kind to me when I’ve treated you like utter shit? Why the fuck would you let me live with you if you think I think you’re an arsehole?”
John lifted his head, and his mouth dropped open.
But, laughing probably wasn’t the best response. John thought about it for a moment, because he couldn’t just tell Sherlock he knew all about his childhood traumas, and yet he was a terrible liar. The again, he mused, he did a damn good job of lying about what he knew in the other world. “I might be totally off,” John took his hand off his side to give him space, “but I didn’t think you’d react to this well, emotionally. I thought you’d push me away because, not long ago, you rejected romance.”
John bit his lip. “Um, as soon as possible?”
“Of course,” he snapped.
The darkness behind his eyelids consumed his vision, and he wished the blackness could swallow him whole.
There was one more thing he needed to say, though. “Sherlock,” he murmured, “do something for me. Please.”
?” John raised his voice.
He spent the ride back home in silence, lost in his thoughts.
,” he said petulantly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, blushing slightly. “John.”
“John!” She sounded concerned. “Where the hell are you? I thought you would have come home eventually, but it’s morning and I have no idea where you are! I’ve been worried about you!”
John couldn’t help himself from stopping on the steps and eavesdropping.
With how sickly he looked, John was reminded of Sherlock’s “Shezza” disguise.
If nothing else, it would feel good to have Mary and her little schemes out of his life forever. He pushed away the memory of his nightmare, refusing to acknowledge the fear in his veins. He had to tell John.
He was definitely losing his mind. Thankfully, he became flaccid again and he finished his shower as quickly as possible.
I hope you enjoy~~
“What are you looking at?” Sherlock asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who?” he asked.
want an apology from me. I shouldn’t be able to get away with--”
“I’m okay,” John brushed the tips of their noses together. “I promise.” And as anxious as he was about his theory being wrong, he actually was starting to feel okay, making peace with this place.
“How--” Sherlock hiccupped, and took a moment to catch his breath. “How’d you know I was missing?”
John giggled, the lingering tension on the air vanishing. “You still can, you know. Honestly? My pants are a mess and it’s uncomfortable.”
Great. John had told Mary. The incident was driving John to drink. Sherlock was glad he was alone, because he was sure guilt was written all over his face. “I see.”
Sherlock didn’t know what to do with this information. It made him feel good, but he didn’t know how to respond. He had to stop reacting to these things like it was his first time experiencing them. John would notice sooner or later.
“I’m glad you’re talking again,” Mrs. Hudson said as she brought up his laundry.
“I manage!” he said hotly, narrowing his eyes.
“You--” John tried to lift his hand and point a finger at him, but his arm was weak and wobbled. He found his strength and held up his arm and pointed his finger. His eyes were huge. “You can’t be here.”
But he had to act naturally. “Sorry, my head was somewhere else,” he muttered, voice gruff from sleep and crying. “I’m at Baker Street.”
John felt heat pour into his gut. He cleared his throat. “What?”
“Oh,” he looked confused, “was I asleep the whole time?”
John felt exposed.
Sherlock put both tablets into his mouth and washed them down with one long gulp of water. The ends of his hair was starting to dry, and it was getting frizzy.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. If it hadn’t gone so well, he’d be furious with Mummy for her lame advice.
John sighed and rolled onto his back, scratching his jaw. “I left my phone in my jacket pocket. Think she’s tried to call me?”
Sherlock shook his head. “Did Rosie cry when you dropped her off?”
Sherlock moaned tiredly, closing his eyes. “Another one of your silly dreams?”
His heart started fluttering, but John got up and went to the loo anyway. He had to get himself and Rosie ready in time to bring her to daycare. While brushing his teeth, he thought about skipping the hassle and keeping her home for the day, but then again, as much as he loved her, he needed more alone time with Sherlock. He was tired but his mind was swimming with memories of last night--or, early morning. He was still in shock, really, and while he didn’t feel depressed for once in a long time, he didn’t exactly feel great either. All of this needed to sink in, but for now, it was like shell shock. They agreed to stop apologizing to each other, but John was thinking about the raw look on Sherlock’s face with the letter crumpled in his hand. He had looked absolutely
John hoped the pain he suddenly felt didn’t show on his face. “Well, um, I’ve been given a lot of second chances in life. It’s only fair.”
“If he finds out,” she continued, “your friendship would be over, wouldn’t it? You can’t have a friendship with someone when there’s known unrequited affection, or whatever it is you feel for him.”
“Help me.”
me.” He lifted his head. “What do I do, Sherlock?”
“Maybe we’re two different shades of coward.”
John stood up straight, lightly patting him on the back. He knew Sherlock wasn’t seriously going to pay attention to him for a few hours, but John didn’t want to sit around watching mindless nature documentaries or reality television shows for another several hours. Getting out of the house might do him good. “We’re running out of food,” he said. “I should run to Tesco before all we have left is a box of biscuits.”
John felt as relaxed as he sounded.
Sherlock shrugged. “I’ve been worse.” He didn’t like this feeling of fear and exhaustion, but he figured that there was no point in stalling. “Let’s get ready.”
And we got a cheesy love confession :P I figured we needed some cheese after Sunday, and in preparation for this Sunday...
“Only because I thought John would be happy if he stayed married to you,” he explained coolly. “You tried to kill me. You nearly succeeded.” She would have, if Sherlock hadn’t clawed his way back to life for John.
John hoped he would be able to control himself. They had to take things slowly. “Good.”
John stared blankly at him. “You really think you’ve convinced me?”
“N-no!”
“Damn right you will,” John applied the gauze, “I’ll make sure of it.” He gave Sherlock a light pat on the back, which he was able to do now that the open wounds turned to fading scabs.
Sherlock nodded, his heart suddenly clenching and needing physical affection. “Okay.”
“You can deduce even when you’re on morphine?”
Sherlock gasped and shook, his fingers digging into John’s hips. His grip loosened, seeming to come to his senses, and one of his hands cupped John’s erection.
“I haven’t talked to a doctor yet, but he barely made it. His heart had stopped beating.”
Sherlock’s expression was unreadable. “Yes, she does seem tired,” he said, monotone.
Back to the point. Sherlock needed to see John’s reaction to the roses. He had to see if he liked them. He had a plan for--there was no other way to put it--
Mrs. Hudson shook her head and left, and John heard her leave the flat and shut the door behind her.
“What do you mean?”
“There we are,” Sherlock said when the logs began to burn. He bit his lip. “Sit. If you want.”
Sherlock went into the bedroom. “John, it’s Lestrade. He wants to see how you’re doing since your hospital stay.”
John rubbed his eye. “I didn’t know what else to do,” he said honestly. “You needed to know the truth.” He felt so hollow. He couldn’t muster up the energy for anything but resignation.
“Only a little.”
“It’s all right,” he waved a hand, crossing a leg over his knee. Sherlock was glad John was understanding. It wasn’t that he
He looked down at his shoes as he paid for the bouquet. As he left the shop, he was sure his face was as red as the roses.
When John reached in the room and stepped inside, Sherlock was passed out, an oxygen tube up his nose, and a bright white bandage across his wound, the blankets pulled down to his waist. John grabbed one of the chairs up against the wall and put it next to the bed, sinking down into it and crying into his hands, relieved, anguished, and angry. She wouldn’t get away with this. Not this time. His head wasn’t up his fucking arse this time.
“No worse than usual,” Sherlock said, lowering himself and getting under the duvet and sheets. He looked up at John. “Aren’t you joining me? You said you’re tired.” He blinked. “Did I assume incorrectly?”
Sherlock gives John flowers.
“Can I do it one more time?”
“Hurts,” he admitted, not meeting John's eyes, “but my head feels clearer.”
Sherlock’s warm hands tentatively held his bare hips, and began to stroke his sides slowly. “Nothing out of the ordinary at a first glance, but upon further examination, captivating. Well, at least to me,” he amended.
A smile lit up Sherlock’s face, and he was laughing, too, and hugged John tightly. This time, he sent them both falling down on the cushions.
“Okay. Go home.” That was too harsh. “Be safe,” he added.
“That’s absurd,” a crinkle appeared on top of the bridge of Sherlock’s nose. “You two will do no such thing. I offered her a place to stay, John, but that doesn’t mean I’m here for her entertainment.”
to do anything tonight?”
“Huh?” John breathed, and then started coughing, most likely from not talking for weeks.
And this was when he broke. He blinked quickly, trying to force away the moisture rapidly filling his eyes, his lower lip giving the slightest quiver. “You do?”
And there they were again, Sherlock with cameras and microphones held up to his face, wearing the bloody hat, announcing to the country that, yes, he was back,
“She told me the same thing.”
Sherlock did open his eyes and turned his head to look at her, then. “What do you mean?”
“What, the Magnussen incident?” he asked, stalling.
“And there’s nothing wrong with that,” he said softly.
,” he cried, chest heaving with small sobs. “Please, I’m sorry, I love you,” he babbled. “I love you. You can’t do this to me again,” he choked out, Sherlock’s expressionless, clammy face sending horrible chills down his spine. He didn’t have the capacity to process any of this--it all felt like a dream (
Sherlock smiled. “Me, too.”
John looked up, mouth dropping open, blood running cold.
“Says the man with semen on his abdomen.”
A ball of shame dropped into John’s stomach, and he couldn’t look at Sherlock. He looked down at his hands. What a royal fuck-up he was. He was being selfish. When John swallowed, his throat was tight. He felt his eyes water.
They talk
Sherlock turned his face and kissed the top of John’s head, hot tears slipping down his cheeks. His cheekbone stung. A cut must have been there. “Please, John, don’t blame yourself.”
Lestrade nodded with a frown. “Yeah, all right.”
“I wanted you for so long and I fucked everything up so badly,” John said into his hair.
Of course something like this would happen only a couple cases after they began working together again. The universe loved to irritate Sherlock, didn’t it? It happened so fast. He hadn’t even wanted to take the case. After exposing a serial killer like Culverton, especially after no one believed him at first, Sherlock felt like he deserved a better case than going after a moron who stole a priceless bust. Honestly, he was above that by now! But John had wanted to do it.
John pressed a small kiss to the seam of his lips. “I think, as painful as things were, our lives happened in such a way to guarantee we’d be together.”
“Well, Rosie’s downstairs, we can, erm, get comfortable.” He coughed delicately behind his fist. Did he seriously just say that, after his blunder yesterday? “It gets tiring standing after a while,” he explained dumbly. “We can lie on the sofa, you know, relax a bit.” It wasn’t fair that it was this difficult.
John sat up against the headboard, not knowing what to expect.
“Sherlock?” John’s eyebrows knitted together. “What’s wrong?”
Sherlock smiled. “Yes.”
“You’ve been doing it with a dry hand the whole time?”
“You’re right,” she said, sounding amused. “He went out to a pub after he left your flat, or when you threw him out of your flat.”
Sherlock hoped John wouldn’t tell her about it. Maybe he could convince him to stay quiet during his visit to the surgery.
Lestrade was glaring at Sherlock, shaking his head. “You bastard.” He then threw his arms around Sherlock’s neck, not caring about John’s presence.
Sherlock’s hand was sweating in his. He was blinking. A pregnant pause passed. “Yes,” he whispered. Then, licked his top teeth and grimaced. “Do you have a spare toothbrush?”
“Yeah. Just, um, looking around. I was never--back then, I was never in here too much.”
Her lips slowly pulled down into a frown. “Why, is it serious?”
“I’m glad you did,” John said as he retrieved a pair of tweezers. “Be more careful next time, you git,” he scolded, and grabbed Sherlock’s hand with firmness and gentleness, the touch of a doctor, and the touch of a friend. “It’s not in too deep,” he said, “so it should only be a small pinch.”
“Do you not know how to begin?” John prompted.
“I don’t know,’ he murmured. “You’re not leaving, are you?”
Sherlock cautiously looked up at John from under his lashes. There were no signs of anger or disgust on his face. He genuinely appeared to be shocked. That made sense, though. He didn’t think Sherlock was capable of doing what he did. “I’m sorry for doing this, and for what I’m about to tell you.”
Sherlock felt rooted to this spot.
She looked at him. “Yes?”
He was fine with that.
“There are no coincidences in the world,” Sherlock abandoned his plate on the table. “What is it?” he asked again.
, Sherlock was alive. He defied death again, and John wondered how the hell he got so lucky to have a second chance at everything, including Sherlock surviving a bullet twice. John didn’t know how he did it, but Sherlock really never let him down. John sniffed, wiping his eyes, making himself breathe slowly to get his pulse under control. He went to sigh, but it turned into a yawn. Being woken up at 4:37 in the morning and nearly having a nervous breakdown because his best friend was almost murdered had worn him out, but he couldn’t sleep. He wouldn’t leave Sherlock’s side, but he feared Mary would somehow know Sherlock pulled through, and would come back to finish the job. He didn’t know if he were just being paranoid, but he wouldn’t take any chances.
Thankfully, Sherlock was in a talkative mood, so John didn’t have to respond. “Thank you,” he flashed a grin, “but please leave.”
“Can I confess something?” Sherlock asked.
“Hey, I like that side of you,” John said gently, nudging his arm, “you can be like that around me. You care about people, Sherlock, and that’s okay.”
“You still with me?” John asked.
Sherlock decided that he would deliver the note himself, if John were going to find out it was him today anyway. It was still early in the morning, though, and he wanted to wait towards the end of John’s shift at 5. He spent most of the day failing to occupy himself, a ball of dread lodged in his chest. He felt so jumpy that he didn’t dare attempt to eat. He was so desperate for a distraction that he actually spent two hours cleaning the flat. If Mrs. Hudson knew, he was sure she would faint from shock. Speaking of her, Sherlock had a desire to vent to Mrs. Hudson about his troubles, but decided against it. If John rejected him, then he would have to tell Mrs. Hudson about it later, and he wasn’t sure he would be able to do that.
John sat up, instantly concerned. “Does it hurt?”
Even the act of giving flowers is angsty for them.
“Well, I’m back in my old bedroom, but I was a few hours ago. I just needed to talk to him.”
“Forgive me for not being optimistic about dealing with the woman who shot me,” he snapped.
Sherlock’s body jerked, and his hands suddenly flew to the buttons of his shirt.
he hadn’t proposed to her yet. Knowing that she was not who she said she was, and that she would almost kill Sherlock, John absolutely could not propose. John stood up straight and his arm fell to his side, a kick of anticipation in his heart. There was something more important happening tonight, and he remembered it vividly.
“I understand. For clarity, there’s little you could do that would be unappealing,” he said with his eyes down and focused on the duvet. He wanted everything John would give him. After years of loneliness, he was starving for affection.
John snorted. “Yeah, I guess. Except for the marrying Mary part.” He smoothed down the last of the gauze, and he was done. “There. I know you’re still hyper from the case, but try to sleep, okay?”
That night, John bathed Rosie and put her to bed, insisting on performing both tasks so he could spend time with her. When he came out with his jumper soaked, he huffed. “You didn’t mention she doesn’t like baths,” he muttered.
John tried not to let Sherlock see how sorry he felt for him. He sighed heavily, bracing himself. “Sherlock, can we talk about what happened?”
John let out a small laugh, but his mind was stuck on
“Then I dunno either,” he declared, closing his eyes as if to say
Damn it. Thinking about how much Sherlock was willing to do for him did not bring warmth to his chest, but a sickening guilt to his stomach, and it must have shown on his face. “Nothing, nothing. Well, I’ll, erm, I’ll see you later. I’ll be in touch.”
“What?” his head shot up off the pillow. “No! What gave you that idea?”
“I was bloody furious with him,” John said. “He’s too weak to even sit up on his own right now, let alone get up and walk.” He swallowed. “His heart had stopped.”
John wasn’t really heartbroken to see him go; he was still angry with Mycroft over the rubbish he had put into Sherlock’s head as a child. He would tell him off for it one day. “I think he just wanted to check on us,” John said. “He took me home last night and saw how distraught I was.”
“I’m sorry!” Sherlock rose to his feet, stumbling, hand flying to his chest, a yelp of pain flying past his lips before he could stop it. He gritted his teeth and groaned, posture curling as he held his chest.
“Really?” Sherlock scowled.
John licked his lips. “Let’s...let’s go to sleep, okay?”
John turned on his side and hugged Sherlock tightly to his chest.
That seemed to do it for her. “Ah, John, always the gentleman. I see. But what about, what’s her name, Mary?”
John got control of his laughter, a smile lighting up his face. “Hey, Sherlock, where’d you get the idea to send flowers and all? I loved it, but, uh, it was a little cliche for you.”
“Um,” John half-coughed and half-laughed behind his fist.
It was dawning upon him just how observant John was. “She already calls you ‘dad’ and we didn’t know what she would call me, but then she picked up my name on her own.” How he said that with a straight face without faltering, he’d never know.
John’s stomach growled, but he didn’t want to leave bed for stupid cereal when this was the first time he woke up with Sherlock next to him as his...partner? Lover? They hadn’t had sex yet. Whatever. He was his Sherlock. John wished he could hold him properly, but the last thing Sherlock needed was his wound to be aggravated. It was funny, now that John thought about it, that a few hours ago, they were in despair. It certainly wasn’t funny at the time, but life was so strange that John figured he had to laugh at himself and the absurdity of their relationship sometimes.
“I know,” Sherlock said, sounding stiff and uncomfortable. “I said I was sorry, though. Profusely.”
His words wrapped around Sherlock like an embrace, and Sherlock believed him. He felt two tears drip down his cheeks after he blinked, but it was from relief now. “Okay,” he rasped.
be dreaming?
Sherlock blinked. “Did I say something wrong?”
She responded,
Without warning, John wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled Sherlock’s body to his. He grinned softly. “Didn’t I just say I loved you?”
The way he said it made John’s heart twist. He sounded upset.
What do you think? I loved feedback and take it very seriously. I hope it's cool, because I have some stuff in mind for future chapters.
Shortness of breath, chest pains, racing heart, sweating palms, trembling legs--that would only prove John’s point. “It’s
Sherlock lay on his back, and he looked uncertain. John felt a little uncertain, too. He never cuddled with a man before, let alone Sherlock.
John threw the other cotton ball away forcefully. He looked like he wanted to punch something, and was struggling to hold himself back from putting a hole through the wall. “What else did she do?”
Sherlock sunk into the sofa. “Well, that’s correct.”
“John, hello,” Sherlock said, turning to fully face him. “I wasn’t expecting you today.”
to die.”
Sherlock cried out, pain exploding at the bridge of his nose. Did she break it? He gritted his teeth together, suppressing a yelp, his voice coming out in a low groan. His nose pulsed painfully with each of his heartbeats. “How’re you gonna kill me?”
Sherlock nodded, staring at him intently. “Yes, I think that’s the best course of action, if that’s what you want.”
John’s thought were disrupted by Sherlock’s nose nuzzling into the side of his neck.
“Ah, yes, you had mentioned that she’s turning one,” Irene said.
John just walked past him and Molly, feeling like his tail was in between his legs. “Is she having fun?” he put a smile on his face.
“Remember how you wanted to meet me in a public place for safety?”
“Easy,” John breathed against his lips.
“I thought he was fucking dead!” John snapped. “He was--he was my best friend!” He got dangerously close to saying
John nodded back, thinking back to when Lestrade brought him the box of Sherlock’s things when he was still dead.
“Hm?”
He huffed with indignation. “She’s acquiring language already. She already knows her first word. Listen.” He held her back so she could look at him. “Rosie,” he called gently, “who am I? What’s my name?”
Now, they were right outside the door. Sherlock turned his face to shoot daggers at John. Their faces were close, and John could feel Sherlock’s breath on his face when a haughty huff left his nose.
John stood beside him, just as he did before, watching with a swell of pride as Sherlock was redeemed in the eyes of the public. Sherlock was back at the top of his game, and John remembered with a kick to the gut that his name would be dragged again, when he accused a celebrity of murder...only, no, his name was cleared again because Sherlock was right, and John wouldn’t let him get high like that again. He would be there this time.
his mind said with cynical glee. It had been bugging him for quite some time--well, since the start--but that didn’t mean he was right to push Sherlock last night, especially when he had just taken morphine.
“You flatlined,” John said, staring at the door. “I remember that. But the details, I can’t. It’s fuzzy.”
John pursed his lips. “So, she knows you exposed her, that you love me, I got an expensive bottle of scotch from someone other than her, and I didn’t come last night.”
For a split second, she had the decency to look guilty, the fire in her eyes wavering, but then she snarled, “The only reason why I did it was because I knew you really wanted to shag him all along!” she pointed a finger at Sherlock.
John felt his cock stir again, and there was no way he could resist. He latched onto Sherlock’s neck again, kissing his neck, and delicately nibbled the skin. Sherlock’s other hand came around his back, and all ten fingers were gripping John tightly. He was breathing hard, tilting his head upward to give John better access to his throat. John took a chance and sucked harder, and felt Sherlock shiver in his arms.
John gave a heal-hearted shrug. “Once again, I couldn't wait. My bad,” he smiled. “Next time we do something, I promise you can touch me,” he winked, feeling drunk on dopamine.
Sherlock tugged his hair.
“No,” John’s arms tightened around his slim waist, “I can stay here with you.”
“Am I wrong?” she asked accusingly. “Am I supposed to believe you two just chatted last night?”
John started by taking off his tie, suit jacket, and dress shirt, and pulled the jumper over his head. Maneuvering his way out of his trousers and into jeans was a little more difficult while his legs still felt numb but heavy at the same time, but after a couple minutes of tugging, he managed it, and damn, it felt good to be in clean clothes (although he needed a shower, but he thought he smelled fine enough for now). Grabbing the end of the sink next to the toilet and lifting himself up, he made his way back to the door. With the plastic bag with his suit in one hand, he clutched the doorknob with his other hand, and he heard Sherlock and Mary talking.
John forced the memories of his violent actions to leave his mind. He promised not to speak of the incident anymore. “At least it’s all over now, I guess. We know the truth.”
“Rosie really should start sleeping on her own. Would you mind if I started sleeping down here with you?”
“I think I know how you feel,” John continued. “I’ve always wanted to be in a relationship, but this is still difficult for me. Expressing bloody emotions and shit. I guess I put up a wall, too.”
Yesterday, although emotionally difficult for them both, had ended as well as it could have.
As soon as the door was shut and locked behind him, Sherlock’s one hand went over his mouth and the other flew to his cock. He leaned against the wall, quickly stroking himself to full hardness. His harsh breathing was loud to his ears, but he figured that was because he was locked inside a small room. He kept going, squeezing and bucking into his hand. Soon enough, liquid was gathering at the tip, and he only had to think of John looking at him in bed like he was a couple minutes ago for him to spurt all over his hand. His breath hitched sharply, and then he held it to stop the moan in his throat in its tracks. He removed his hand from his mouth and exhaled slowly out of his mouth. God, he needed that. He washed off his hands and tucked himself back into his pants.
Lestrade’s shoulders moved up and down with a long, sad sigh. His eyes moved from Sherlock’s form, and whatever he was about to say was prevented by a deep frown. “Jesus, John, you don’t look much better.”
His pink lips parted, and he took a deep breath, hand twitching in John’s. His face was red down to his neck. “I have always considered you my better half, John,” he confessed.
happy as long as possible, too.)
tell you that before, right?”
John threw Culverton at the police officer standing in the doorway. “Restrain him
John licked his lips, his mind conjuring up the image of Mary sneaking in and firing a bullet between Sherlock’s eyes to finish the job. There was no way he could ever forgive himself if Sherlock died because he wasn’t there. “His killer hasn’t been caught.”
John paused. “Why did you read the emails, anyway?”
John placed a kiss on the corner of his mouth, feeling the stubble tickle his mouth. “Never kissed someone with stubble,” he whispered.
John had to close his eyes, or else he was going to get harder by looking at Sherlock’s (fucking gorgeous) face. He couldn’t even try to look down and see if Sherlock were anything other than flaccid, or he was going to lose his mind. He wondered how Sherlock would react to his nipples being licked, and John cursed inwardly when he felt himself get harder.
“You can take off your jacket.”
“I know it’s your business, but I wish you would have told me about...well.”
John knew that much, but he feigned surprise. He wasn’t sure how good of an actor he was, but Sherlock wasn’t looking at him, so he figured he was good.
Mrs. Hudson put a single candle on the little cake. “Shoot, I haven’t got a lighter.”
Sherlock felt the blood rush to his face.
His eyes were bright blue, and he suddenly looked young. “There were times--I did think about you, but sometimes that was too much. I had to stop myself, because..” He swallowed. “You know I hate repeating myself, but I will. I missed you.”
John’s lips snapped shut.
“If you must use that terminology, yes.” He was glad it was too dark for John to see his expression well.
“God, Sherlock, ever stop and think we’re fucked up?”
John dropped his hand off his chest.
It struck John that it had been a long time since he had taken care of Sherlock, properly, at least. Sherlock spent so much time caring for him, doing anything in the world to make him happy--John wanted to repay him. If all of this made Sherlock nervous, then John would just have to see him through it. He wanted their first real time together (he wasn’t sure of Sherlock’s incident on the sofa really counted) to be
He grinned faintly. “I can be an excellent liar, especially over the phone. Once she’s set, she’ll be on a plane to Oklahoma.”
John’s pulse was heavy in his neck from the effort it took not to grab Sherlock and hold him close to his chest. He had to be in so much pain, and…
To Sherlock’s relief, John started rubbing his back again. He didn’t know why he liked it so much, but he didn’t think any other physical sensation he had previously experienced calmed him as much as this. If he weren’t half aroused, he suspected he could fall asleep like this. Maybe later.
“‘Night, mate.”
a sinister voice whispered in his head.
“I see. Do you need anything before I leave?”
“So why do you need to be here?” John asked in annoyance.
John grabbed the remote control and flipped on some rubbish, sitting close to Sherlock, but not kissing him anymore. He would be patient, but he was sad that no one ever kissed Sherlock like that before, and they had hardly done anything. Sherlock deserved the best, and John wasn’t that, but he would try to give him everything he needed. John sat there for a couple hours, arm loosely wrapped around Sherlock’s shoulders as he napped (the morphine excuse wasn’t a total lie, after all), but his heart ached for the other Sherlock, who was forever alone, forever untouched.
The proximity made his heart flutter, but somehow, being under a blanket with another person went from weird and anxiety-inducing to filling him with tranquility. With his failure of a plan and Mary purposefully pushed to the back of his mind, Sherlock felt a sort of peace that was rare nowadays. The heaviness in his eyelids was back, and the warmth of John and the quilt was slowly turning his limbs into pudding. He blinked hard. He hadn’t been sleeping well since he started his stupid plan, his anxiety keeping him up at night. Sherlock sat up a little, stifling a yawn.
He deflated, scowl fading. He pressed his lips together tightly.
“Well?” John asked.
Sherlock looked at the people walking on the sidewalk down below. “You know,” he said simply.
A memory of Sherlock looking hurt in the office of Sebastian Wilkes flashed before John’s eyes. He felt a pin enter his chest. He just wanted to be
Sherlock buttoned his suit jacket over his deep red dress shirt. He didn’t know why he went with red, but it was too late to change now. John was downstairs giving Rosie to Mrs. Hudson. They were about to go out to dinner, on a
Sherlock was absentmindedly twirling the handle of the fork in his hand, staring into space.  He started to look nervous.
Well at least they hugged :P
“You were best man.”
“That’s the one.”
Sherlock pursed his lips. “Deal.”
He was stuck, and felt like the walls were closing in on him. Sherlock could not send anything else without leading to him being revealed, so there was no way he could try to make John fall for his suitor more. If John didn’t want him now, then that was it--he wouldn’t ever want him. In addition, he didn’t know how much longer he would have been able to keep this up without Mary catching on and telling John anyway. Sherlock’s throat tightened. Why did he think this would work? Stupid Mummy. This was her fault.
“Yeah, you know, kissing, sharing a bed,
Sherlock wanted him so badly. “Not when it has to do with you,” he said softly.
“I want to hear you say it,” Culverton whispered.
John was too groggy to really process anything at all, so he just whispered, “Shh, don’t get up, ’s okay.”
Sherlock thought that no matter what happened, as long as John was with him, he could accept it. It would have been terrible if he had died when Mary shot him, without seeing John before his death.
John felt his jaw clenching and lip trembling, and there was no way he could stop it. He couldn’t process any of what was going on, but his throat felt tight, and he thought that if Sherlock had never jumped, none of the misery after his return would have ever happened. His head was spinning, his stomach was churning, and his hands were shaking by his side. Instead, the weight and trauma of the two years after Sherlock’s return was shattering John’s heart.
John gave him a weak smile. “I hope so. Thanks for stopping by.” Once he was alone with Sherlock, he sighed in relief.
Sherlock, aware of their fragile relationship and how John didn’t really work with him on the Culverton case as much as he had reluctantly followed him around and listened to his drug-induced ramblings, decided to bite his tongue and agree. He and John were...getting better, he thought. He was coming over to Baker Street more often with Rosie, but there were times John couldn’t look him in the eye and his posture would tense up. Sherlock thought it had to do with the unease between them since Mary’s death, and the less than favorable things that happened during the Culverton affair, but John had apologized for that, and he forgave him. He truly did. John didn’t seem to believe that, though, and was harboring guilt. Sherlock didn’t want to bring it up and upset John, so he left it alone and hoped things would get back to normal. Somehow.
“You looked like you were, but fine.” John gave him a tiny nod. “Go on, tell me your symptoms if you don’t feel well.”
Shit. “I’m sorry,” John said awkwardly.
“I agree.” A bashful look was on his face. “I’m glad I only ever did that with you,” he said quietly.
“What?”
“Mary made him miserable,” Sherlock shot back. “It’s better if he doesn’t know for as long as possible.”
He spent the whole can ride vibrating with energy, a part of him nervous, because he wasn’t entirely sure how he should approach John. Act casual? Probably the best idea. If he let John see that he was hurt, it would only make things more uncomfortable, and Lestrade and his crew would be around to see it. He had to act like he was okay, and he had to keep hiding Mary’s secret from John for the time being. That bothered him. He didn’t like lying to John. It never ended well. It always put a huge crack in their relationship. He bit the inside of his cheek, watching the traffic rush by. There was also the knowledge of the inevitable end of their friendship hanging over his head, and it would hang over his head during every single one of their interactions until the time came. He looked down at his clasped hands. He needed to stop thinking about it, or there would be no way he could focus on the case or act fine. It was so hard, though, the situation was constantly there in his mind. He wished he could have stopped thinking of it for five minutes. He couldn’t.
Sherlock looked down at his shoes. He couldn’t bear the expression John wore. “I’m sorry.”
John cleared his throat again, nodding. “Thank you,” he said gruffly. “Thank you, Sherlock.”
John thrust into his hand four more times, and his back arched, moaning into Sherlock’s mouth as he came on his hand. He threw his arm over his eyes, a little embarrassed because all it really took was Sherlock telling him to let go for him to spurt like a bloody fire hose, and it occurred to him how ridiculous they were, with Sherlock coming in his pants on the sofa, them both being so awkward about it, only to get their heads out of their respective arses and give each other handjobs.
John was vibrating with lust, moving his hand in time with Sherlock’s (uncoordinated) thrusts as best he could. “Sherlock, let me see your face. Please. I love you, and I want to see you,” he babbled against his sweaty temple. “You don’t need to feel shame in front of me.”
“I know you are.” His eyes flickered down to his hand on his shoulder. “Hm. I still feel fucking weird, but this is nice.”
Sherlock’s shoulders slumped. His lips tightened.
His silence was unnerving.
“You’re in no condition to go home,” he sighed, “but your brother gave me no choice. If you experience too much pain, you should come back here, Mr. Holmes.” He was glaring at Sherlock, and his eyes flickered over to John. “I trust that you’ll keep an eye on him, though, Dr. Watson.”
“I have none in the flat.”
Sherlock opened his eyes, irritation clear. “Enough of this, it’s not important right now. Anyway,” he said pointedly, “we were talking about you and Rosie. Last week, did we not agree to see each other more? For Rosie,” he added.
She shook her head in disbelief. “What else could you want?”
“I know,” Sherlock said. “I was there.”
“You said that name in your sleep a couple times.”
He mentally groaned. He should have known John would have wanted answers, and not find all of the gestures flattering. The original roses seemed to be fine, but he supposed the repeated behavior was unsettling. He sat there feeling like a dolt. Why did he think this would have worked? John said he would get to the bottom of things, perhaps even call the police, if another gift came with no explanation. Sherlock was at a loss for what to do, and though he felt ready to love John, he wasn’t ready for any sort of confrontation, especially because he doubted his feelings were reciprocated. Speaking of which, he was shocked Mary didn’t put the pieces together and figure out it was Sherlock who gave John the whiskey.
Sherlock just shook his head, and in that moment, he looked incredibly sad, standing there with fading wounds on his back, posture crumpled due to what was underneath the bandage on his chest, his frame still too thin, and his head hung down in shame.
A loud growl startled both of them.
John was amazed at his own capacity to be enchanted by Sherlock’s displays of basic human behavior.
“I am one,” he said, but his voice was weak and unconvincing, sounding like a reflex more than anything else. His fist was wrapped around the tie on his dressing gown. “Even if you don’t believe that, you said it yourself that I’m not complete as a human being if I’m not romantically involved.”
He was going mad. If (when) John found out he moved all of his things into the flat, he would put Sherlock in a straitjacket. Thankfully, John and Rosie didn’t have many belongings; his military experience led him to a minimalist lifestyle, and she only had so many clothes and toys. Plus, none of the furniture in the flat, aside from Rosie’s crib, changing table, and height chair needed to be moved into 221B. Even so, and with the decently sized crew Mycroft sent over, the process took all night.
“No, but,” he squinted, “something like this was bound to happen. Our line of work is dangerous. We have, or had, to travel sometimes. I just, I don’t know, didn’t we think this through?”
Sherlock made an interested hum in his throat. “That was nice of Mary,” he commented.
Sherlock’s jaw trembled. “I don’t know,” he confessed, voice small.
“I’m not looking for a fight.” She nearly sounded offended. “I have a legitimate concern about you, Sherlock, because I know you’ve fallen for my husband.” Now, she sounded mock-sympathetic.
“No,” Sherlock said with a smile. “She’s rather lively, but I don’t think she’s been sleeping well with you gone.”
, and the scenario is Irene Adler shows back up after the events of s4 (TFP doesn't exist though), and jealous, broken, repressed John is not pleased one bit. So, if you liked this, I hope you'll check out my new story <3
John let go of him, smiling smugly. He casually got a tissue from the box on the bedside table and wiped his hand as Sherlock gulped for air and trembled. Once his hand was clean, he hugged Sherlock and kissed the top of his head. “That threw you off guard, didn’t it?”
John’s face fell and his eyes flickered downward. “I know that feeling,” he said quietly.
Sherlock’s face was troubled, lips trembling. “She,” he croaked.
When John sat on the toilet seat, he gave Mary a pointed look.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think we should have a talk,” she said, completely nonchalant.
“You don’t have to thank me. I forgive you for everything; forgive yourself.”
“Yeah,” John smirked, pushing the other world out of his mind. He remembered the mess in his pants, but decided to ignore it for now.

Lestrade snickered behind his phone.
John grinned. “Force of habit.”
Sherlock gave him a lopsided smile. “You’re absurd.”
His eyes were downcast once again. “It feels weird saying it, but I must have before, so I guess I can say it now. You already did, anyway.”
“I had a baby with her.”
“Of course.” John stood up, stomach twisting at the mention of the man who separated them and changed them forever. “I knew it wasn’t true--what he was trying to make people believe about you.”
“I told you I’m letting his memory come back organically,” he hissed.
“You, um, you know I’m a romantic, but I don’t think I knew how much or what that really meant before we met.” Was he making sense? It made sense in his head. “You make me feel in a way I never felt before.”
through his bitter tears.
Sherlock couldn’t stay here any longer. Already, guilt was starting to prick at his veins. “I’m...I really should go, John. I promise I’ll be back tomorrow.”
was, sitting around and coddling his aching heart all day.
There it was, out in the open: John hated himself. It was true, and hearing Sherlock say it made his breath shudder.
Damn. “We shouldn’t talk about it here,” John said.
His heart clenched. “But, I wanted to take care of you.” He frowned at himself. He never thought he would say those words to anyone. John deserved those words, though. Only him.
“Sorry,” John whispered immediately, grateful when his voice didn’t crack.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and kissed his chin. “You’re ridiculous.” He sighed, a dreamy tone in his voice. “You’re lucky I love you.”
John smirked a little. “Why three?”
How was he supposed to go to sleep after this? He needed release. “I’ll be right there. I’ve just got to use the loo.”
“Sherlock bloody Holmes--” he almost used the present tense, and remember she was unaware that he was alive, “--was never a danger to society.”
Anxiety started to prickle John’s chest again. “Talk to me. Please.”
Sherlock frowned. He didn't count on that.
“Hm?” Sherlock hummed.
John gave him a look of pity, like he was thinking,
John stood there silently for a moment, then the corner of his mouth quirked up. “‘Another life partner’? Are you saying you were my life partner before you fell?”
“Absolutely.”
“No,” John denied automatically, although it wasn’t entirely false. “You’re entitled to privacy.”
