He pulled up the front of his shirt. Steve stared open-eyed at the arc reactor and he uncomfortably tugged it back down. He'd never actually shown it to anyone outside his family circle.
'Intruder!' Mantis called out again, and Natasha hesitated, her attention still on Bucky. 'Go,' he croaked out, 'I'll be fine.'
'That's not the only reason we got to stop Rumlow,' he reminded them, but they all looked confused. 'What do you mean - there's more?' Bruce asked.
'That's just the way it is, Barton. Somehow dark humour is actually funnier. If I go to Hell, at least I'll go laughing.'
Nat suppress the urge to roundhouse kick him. 'You injured one of our own and tied him up to warn him off. You killed five of us and you also raided us several times. You took one of us hostage and you stabbed and poisoned me. I think that these are all acts of war as well.'
They found the drop ship quite easily. It wasn't too far away - around a kilometre or so from the camp, as Thor had pointed out earlier. It was smoking and very small - a space pod, just for one person.
'Don't bullshit me,' Rumlow said angrily. 'You know damn well why this is happening, and you can't lie your way out. Get over there, now.'
Steve's eyes scanned the crowd and they alighted upon a familiar face - Mrs. Barnes. He began to frantically call out to her and she turned to his voice, running towards him. 'Mrs. Barnes, what's happening? Where are they taking us?' he demanded, trying to shake off his captors' firm grips.
Tony didn't have time. He had to keep moving. The sun was already rising and they would all likely die if he didn't get this damn bomb on the bridge.
They were in the bunker with the child's toys. They had put him in the drop ship, but he was screaming so much the younger children started crying, and people kept walking in on them and disturbing Bruce. Eventually they decided he could stay in the bunker as there was a bed, and although it wasn't that far away from the camp, nobody would interrupt them accidentally and no one could hear them.
Everyone stood around her, silent, all of them dripping water with their hair plastered to their faces. Bucky's chin-length hair was especially wet and he growled at Sam who had been snickering at him.
Bruce and Betty didn't count. Clint was grateful for them, obviously, but they could still go out in the open without having at least three people scream, another six berate them incessantly, and around nine pick them up and physically carry them back to the bunker.
'Yeah, there is. The Helicarrier's running out of supplies and oxygen. Part of the reason they sent us down is because they needed less people aboard the station but that's just a temporary solution and they're going to have to start looking at more ways soon. If I'm not wrong, they're going to have to get rid of more people somehow if we don't give them the message it's safe down here,' he told them, puzzled.
He examined the television screens. They were old-fashioned models from a hundred years ago - flat screen, yes, but otherwise slow and very different from the ones he was used to on the Helicarrier. Behind him, he could hear Tony exclaiming softly at all the gear on display.
'You're a coward, Rogers,' came Rumlow's grating voice, 'you should've stopped them that day. You should've said something. They would've listened.'
As soon as he was gone, a blonde girl appeared, with short, choppy hair and hard blue eyes. She cast a furtive glance around her and then looked directly at the camera. 'You're the leader of the delinquents?'
He sighed and rested his head against the tree he'd chosen to lean on. He didn't know where Loki was, but that wasn't uncommon. All of the people he'd grown close to over the past three days - Clint, Steve, Bruce - were either out of camp or, like in Steve's case, sitting with their childhood buddies, and Thor didn't want to intrude.
'And I have a knife. Let's just see what's in the drop ship. It's not too far away, and it's not in Grounder territory. If it's something hostile we run. If it's something that will help us we'll investigate more.'
'Yes, if we landed in a place where we can see them clearly. Do you want to come with me when it's dark out? We won't go far.'
'So... continue as planned, then? No dramatic reveal and no mass panic?' Tony asked. Everyone nodded. 'Shame, that,' he said under his breath, and Clint snorted. 'Wow, our humour's dark, isn't it?' he remarked, and Tony shrugged.
Explosive arrows, arrows with specially designed arrowheads that could carry messages, carbon-fiber shafts, arrows with narrow spines, barrel-shafted arrows, footed arrows, target arrows, safety arrows, broadheads, steel tips - it was all he dreamt of and more.
'Can you see anything down there?' Barnes yelled. 'Nope, I'm not an owl and I don't have superhero-level eyesight, Buck. Don't you have matches, or something?' 'Oh, yeah, I do. One sec, I'm coming down.' Barnes climbed in after Steve. 'Hey, if you die as well, I claim dibs on that backpack,' Barton told him.
'Ooh,' Clint said immediately, sitting up, his eyes shining. 'Spill. Now. Did you and -' he coughed, '-
'Wait,' interrupted Bucky. He arched an eyebrow at Steve. 'He stabbed you with a poisoned knife and you're going to let him get away with it?'
'It's highly explosive hydrazine. It can cause devastation in its raw form. Watch.' He got out a water bottle, tipped out its contents, filled it with the hydrazine and threw it.
'Thank you, Chancellor,' Steve replied, his eyes glowing with pride, as Tony rolled his eyes in the background and Bruce shuffled his feet.
Delinquents were lined up, talking to their families, talking to their friends. One person was let in at a time. Sam Wilson had taken it upon himself to notify the next of kin of the deceased delinquents, and after that was done, he was made in charge of the system, setting up meetings for the other delinquents.
Those qualities weren't very helpful to him but he never needed to talk much anyway, since he had spent most of his life studying and in the laboratory. He never thought he'd need them. Of course, he had been wrong.
Natasha gave him a sad half-smile. 'Of course, Rogers. You and Thor here just need to find something to dig the grave with.'
'This isn't bad, at all,' he said, surprised, and she nodded. 'I know, right? It's actually really nice. You're not dying, are you?' 'Let's hope not. I'm Clint, by the way.' 'I'm Darcy,' she said, smiling, poking her own fork into the tin.
'I think Loki's back. He has something to say. He also has company. Steve and Thor are handling them.'
'I mean, we kissed,' he said, muffled, into his palms, 'and we're holding hands and are officially boyfriends.'
Shaking, Clint slid a knife from his boot and held it over the girl's throat. He couldn't - he couldn't do it. How could he kill someone? How would he be able to live with it? He knew it would be putting her out of her suffering, but -
'Wait, are we going to be floated?' he asked her, panicking, and she shook her head, still holding back tears. 'No, thank God. You're going to Earth. They're running out of -' 'Mrs. Barnes, we are on a tight schedule here,' one of the guards interrupted. She ignored him and yelled after them as they dragged Steve away.
'Yep. Not anymore, though. After I pulled off that stunt with getting Val down to Earth they found me ineligible for the position and kicked me off. Even though it turned out to be for the better good.' Her voice was bitter.
But of course, this ragtag team of delinquents came along and interfered in her perfectly good plan to ignore people and suck it up by herself for the rest of her life.
They'd also devised a system for washing clothes because people couldn't wear the same clothes all the time. For those lucky enough to find clothes that fit them in the bunkers, they could switch between two sets, but the others had to occasionally jump into the nearby lake fully dressed and then wait for the sun to dry them off.
'This,' he said, and surprising her, himself and the rest of the world he propped himself up on his elbows and kissed her.
Tony immediately rolled to his side, ignoring the pounding pain in his head. His arms and legs were shaking and he felt liquid sliding down his face and knew it was blood. Was this how Steve and the others felt all the time? It was horrifying. He couldn't even walk properly, his legs were aching.
He turned and immediately went towards Rumlow, thinking there might be some sort of internal bleeding which he needed to treat quickly, when Rumlow looked at him and Bruce saw he was crying.
aight, first chapter out, it's like 5 am and I've gotten like 15 minutes of sleep, so bear with me if the plot structure is terrible and the setting is an absolute mess. my hoe ass really can't think straight right now.
She smiled at him. 'That's totally okay. Just - if you really believe he's the one for you, don't let him get away, yeah?'
Clint and Natasha didn't have anyone to worry about. But the other delinquents did. Thor knew that Peter Quill, T'Challa, Sam, and Sharon had all lost either one or both parents, and the some of the others had lost dear friends or lovers. The lucky ones who either didn't have anyone they loved or whose friends and family were still on the Helicarrier were walking around, comforting their friends.
Steve gasped, and then began to grin. Bruce glanced at Tony, panicked. He did not want to meet his parents so soon. Tony was ashen-faced and looked like he'd rather die than stay alive long enough to see Project Exodus be a success.
He turned to look at the destruction, his ears ringing. The bridge was demolished, almost fully obliterated. There were bodies in the water and the river was streaked with red. The rest of the Grounders were poised on their side of the bank, watching their comrades get swept by the merciless current.
The two of them made their way to the Wakandan prince. Thor connected with T'Challa on many levels. Firstly, they were both from foreign space stations that weren't officially joined with the others on Unity Day. Secondly, they were both royals - sons of Chancellors, carrying on a legacy. Thor knew T'Challa had been thrown in jail when seeking revenge for the death of his father.
Tony crouched beside the broken toys. A child had lived here. What had happened, to cause them to leave their almost-perfect bunker in the woods? Did they run out of food? Or did they just think that living in space would be better than waiting for the world to repair itself?
Thor hadn't been worried. His father and everyone close to him lived on Asgard, after all. He was anxious about his friends, though.
She was turning the knife over in her hands, Pietro's blood still on it. Her jaw was clenched and her green gaze was cold. Barnes slipped to her side and looked down at the knife - and his hands curled into fists. 'You don't think...'
'I understand why some people would think that,' Wanda remarked, and Bruce nodded. 'Some of these kids have been through a lot because of the government. They'd definitely not want to help the very ones who made their life hell. But if they remove their wristbands - they're condemning the rest of the human race to a life in space - they're never gonna see any of this,' he said in a low voice.
i fucking loved writing this chapter. i kind of went onto a tangent and then didn't stop so there's a fuckton of sassy comments - thanks, brain - and somehow i managed to give it enough of a plot that it isn't just sarcastic comments and flirting. hopefully.
'Alright, everyone, we need to get ready. First of all, we should talk to the Chancellor, ask him what we should do to prepare for the winter and for the hurricane. Tell Wade and Okoye to continue making weapons -'
Natasha still didn't know what to think of him. Sure, the kiss was nice. It was more than nice, if she was being honest. They hadn't fucked, or anything - they'd just sat up in the bunker for most of the night, talking about anything and everything. He'd told her how he lost his arm, she'd told him about her hard life growing up - but she never mentioned anything about the KGB or how she was an assassin from the Red Room.
Bruce didn't want to speak to anyone. He knew his mother was still there, but he wasn't ready to face her, and he wasn't ready to face his father either. He didn't know if they knew how he'd gotten into jail and he wasn't ready to tell them.
Their bickering was interrupted by T'Challa coming back up, grinning. 'It looks normal outside,' he announced, and Clint whooped again, this time prepared for Darcy's backhand and ducking before it could touch his face.
He was sitting in the grass beside the water, watching a fish lazily swimming in the shallows, when the world began to flash eight different colors.
'How d'you know so much? I was on the guard and even I couldn't immediately say what kind of magazine that was,' he asked her, eyes narrowing. She shrugged. 'Don't ask questions for answers you're not going to get,' she told him, hoping to be vague enough that he would lay off the interrogation.
'No, no, don't you dare -' the blond began, but even the two moments of contact with him had Tony with blood dripping from his nose.
'We would like to ask what we have done wrong, Your Honor,' she said, in a clear, carrying voice. 'We came here to see if we could fix what we have done and offer our assistance in any way.'
'Motherfucker.' Wanda was already marching across the camp, her fists clenched, fire burning in her eyes.
Steve was angrily banging on the hatch, flanked by Tony's other friends. Apparently Rumlow had fled up to the top level of the drop ship. There was no reply, and then suddenly there was a loud bang.
Barney had showed up out of nowhere, a year after his father was floated, when Clint was sixteen, and had demanded Clint give him half of his weekly pay. Clint obviously refused and Barney was furious. The two of them argued which then escalated into a full fight which had to be broken up by the security, and Clint had missed an important event which he was supposed to be attending by Fury's side.
There were muted gasps, cries of shock and people clapping their hands to their mouths in horror. Some of them looked on the verge of tears. Steve was sickened. He felt nauseous. Just because someone had torn out a radio three hundred people were killed.
Steve arched an eyebrow. 'Oh, really? She'd have to change her plans, then. Not sure if there's anything to blow out. Or castrate, too.'
'I have other news as well. We are planning to send down everyone else on the Helicarrier to Earth. It's called Project Exodus. It's actually several projects crammed into one. A drop ship is going to land in around three or four days, and another one scheduled for the early months of next year. Your parents will be guaranteed a spot on the first Exodus ship. Mrs. Barnes, Howard and Maria Stark, and Rebecca and Brian Banner are all going to come down to Earth.'
Carefully, Steve leaned over and gripped the handle. It was dirty and he was cringing the whole time. He pulled at it harshly and the door swung open without much resistance, creaking. Steve peered into the darkness. There were steps leading down to... whatever that was.
Rumlow, with cuts all over his face, so bloody and covered in mud that they could barely make out his eyes, was thrown in the center of camp. He collapsed on the ground, on his hands and knees, tried to get up, and then fell back, panting.
Steve knew what he had to do. Rumlow’s unfair prosecution had been nagging at him ever since he banished the delinquent. Steve knew Rumlow was a horrible person but he didn’t deserve death for something he didn’t do, and no matter how much he hated him, Steve knew he needed to play fair or he would never get a peaceful night’s sleep ever again.
'Ah,' Bucky said, nodding knowledgeably. He smirked and handed Clint a gun. 'Well, fuck them. We're their backup whether they like it or not.'
The scene at camp was oddly domestic. He could see Bucky and Natasha sitting together in a corner, talking quietly. Wade and a blind delinquent called Matt Murdock were sparring in the center of camp, Matt somehow beating Wade in almost all the matches.
'Yeah, sometimes people suck. Can you imagine being that selfish?' She shook her head, her eyes troubled. 'I hope they found something in that bunker, or we'll have to figure out a way to go to Mount Weather without dying in that jungle.'
As if he'd read Bruce's thoughts, Tony smiled, leaned back on the palms of his hands and said, 'Don't believe everything the media tells you. You'd think that when everyone's trying their best to survive because their home planet was destroyed, the news would lay off the celebrity gossip a bit, but no - they somehow find the time and energy to soak up the lies of Hollywood.'
'Oh, you'd care very much, I think,' Loki continued, 'especially if I told that Barnes boy. Don't think I didn't notice the way you looked at him. It's adorable, but it won't last for very long, will it?'
'I'm sorry, but I can't... I can't be in a relationship. It's not working out. For me. I can't do this, James, I'm really sorry, but -'
'I was thinking about how we should do that,' Barnes had said quickly, 'do you think there's any way we can get under the drop ship? Then from there we can either go up or -'
Howard and Maria Stark weren't on the Exodus ship, and when Tony heard, several conflicting emotions passed across his face. Thor detected relief, a sort of weary resignation, anger and indignation. Bruce heard that his father had been on the ship, but his mother was fine. He took the news surprisingly well and went about his normal duties, but he was quieter than usual and his gaze was watery when Thor went to check on him.
'Not my fault you're a pussy, Barnes,' he mocked, and Bucky rolled his eyes. 'Says the only virgin in the camp,' he taunted back.
Something was off about it. It seemed to go in circles, its ears pricked up, but they hadn't made any noise. Maybe it had sensed them, somehow...
'It's all so gorgeous, isn't it?' Natasha said quietly beside him, her hand extended with the palm up, gently holding a pretty white butterfly. Its wings slowly fluttered for a moment and then it took off. She watched it fly away, her green eyes indecipherable.
She nodded. 'They're going to kill three hundred people. Tomorrow. They're running out of oxygen. Even if they kill those three hundred people they will have only a year or so of oxygen left. I wasn't authorized to come down here. My girlfriend caused a distraction and I left in the drop ship so I could see for myself if you were dead or not.'
'No, that's not what I meant. See, what's the point of letting them cross the bridge in the first place? If we could set up a bomb using that hydrazine stuff then they won't be able to come over, and that'll delay the attack,' Bucky said earnestly.
Thor placed both his hands on his brother's shoulders. 'I believe you, okay? I believe you. Do you want to tell this to everyone else, too?'
'Well, I can't have a date in the middle of nowhere. And I'm not going to have sex and I don't think either of us are ready for an 'I love you', so...' he trailed off, shrugging to emphasize his point.
Natasha and Clint were by far the best hunters. They worked together, Clint using his arrows and a bow he'd somehow whittled, Natasha using her knives, and somehow they managed to get the most amount of kills in the entire camp. On special occasions - like today - they'd allow some other people to tag along and watch them kick ass.
Natasha was actually from the Russian space station, Mir. What most people didn't know was that although the Soviet Union was a thing of the past, the KGB still existed. Members of the KGB flew under the radar, and rarely made an appearance, but they were a tight-knit group and were strong in their beliefs.
'I know,' Steve's voice came in reply, and both Tony and Barnes nearly collapsed in relief. 'I keep thinking about it. I know I'm a coward.'
'Clint?' a familiar voice asked joyfully. It was feminine and definitely belonged to the girl holding his hand.
'What's strange?' he asked her. 'The fact that even when there's a crisis and the need to survive, and everyone would make it out fine if they stuck together, people still start fights and cause arguments and manage to widen the rift even further and that is why we ended up there, I'm pretty sure,' she told him calmly. Her twin brother Pietro was a few feet away, gaze flicking between his sister and the brawling delinquents.
He looked around to see if anyone else had noticed. Sure enough, Rogers' blue eyes were focused on the three delinquents. Thor looked back - and nearly had a brain aneurysm.
'Fine, then, let's go. Barton, you're staying here, stab wounds don't heal overnight, you know. The rest of you are coming, yeah?' T'Challa asked, ignoring Clint's glare.
'Yeah, um, gimme a moment,' Steve got out, leaning against the drop ship wall, trying to catch his breath. The blood was all across the ground.
this was interesting to write. poor clint :( but it had to be done~ finally i can move ahead with my plot, let's see what the fuck i'm gonna do because i'm making this up as i go along, i'm just as clueless as y'all lmao
Delinquents had lined up, clamoring for news of their parents. Carol had tried to run through all the names and cleared most of them, but there were the unlucky few whose parents had forcibly been dragged onto the Exodus ship.
'People don't change, do they?' Bucky agreed ruefully. 'What do you think happened to those kids who removed their wristbands? Did they manage to convince anyone else, or...?'
Thor's younger brother was standing there, his shoulder-length black hair swept back, his sharp cheekbones protruding even more than when Tony had seen him last - but he was unscathed. He was unscathed and he was wearing a black suit with the red skull and tentacles symbol described by Barnes and Romanoff.
Tony began to work on the wires. He knew if he had to hot-wire the doors open he had to find the circuit for the buttons and manipulate it so he could get the doors open manually, or at least deactivate the circuit so Barnes and the others could break down the doors.
He opened his mouth to snap at Barton for smirking when Tony emerged from Steve's tent, his dark eyes tired, his hair sticking up in all directions, but he smiled at them weakly.
'Thank you. For the hammer, for helping us, for everything,' he said sincerely, when the younger boy turned.
His friends must've found him because he woke up to them cutting away at his wound, and all the rage of the burning fire was back. He screamed, screamed louder than he'd ever done in his entire life, screamed until his throat was fucking raw and all his words were broken whispers - and then he'd passed out for the third time.
It was dark, but the glowing fauna and the stars and moon provided enough light that Thor and Jane could see the forest around them. They tried to be as quiet as possible. Thor remembered a black jaguar they had seen on one of the border patrols and hefted up his spear, holding it more tightly.
He looked around. He was strapped into his seat, the massive metal brace over his chest holding him in place firmly and uncomfortably. The Quinjet was nothing remarkable - just a escape ship attached to the Helicarrier, designed to withstand the force of entering Earth's atmosphere, with around a hundred seats or so just like his own, each holding a person.
'Does that answer your question?' he asked, raising an eyebrow. 'I don't think we were a one-time thing.'
Thor couldn't stay behind after that. All of Odin's persuasion to not leave him alone without a male heir did nothing to change his mind. His older sister Hela was there, and although she was just as callous and cold as their father, she was a good leader. Thor did feel a bit guilty about leaving the inhabitants of Asgard to her mercy but he couldn't desert his little brother.
Someone was screaming for help and the others were all clamoring together. A crowd had gathered outside the drop ship. Steve furrowed his eyebrows and jogged over to the chaos. A girl was half-sobbing, half-shouting as she explained what was happening to those around her.
Her clouded eyes rolled to his direction. 'We... split up. I don't -' she took a shaking breath and went back to her babbling. Finally, she choked out, 'Kill... me.'
'Then why are you even here?' he asked her, oblivious of the fact that he'd just given himself away.
Steve wondered when it happened. He'd always thought his first kiss would be Peggy, his first love. It shouldn't have come as a surprise when he fell for Tony, though, considering the fact that he'd loved Peggy so much for her soft brown curls, her sharp wit, her slim hips, her broad shoulders and her ability to kick ass. When she had to move away to her home space station he'd been devastated.
His only hope was that Bucky understood why he was doing this, why he'd given up everything for a boy who he had known for just over two weeks. Bucky surely wouldn't understand. He never understood half the things Steve did, but he went along with Steve anyway, defending him to the very last, and that was why Steve loved him so.
hope you enjoyed this chapter and the fic so far, stay in school, don't do drugs, drink your milk and get 8 hours of sleep kids~
Tony crawled into the cramped bottom level of the drop ship. It didn't even count as a level, just as a small storage-type compartment.  He could barely stand up straight and he was short compared to his friends. When Barnes crawled in after him, he had to crouch.
Bruce ran in and, along with Peter Parker, tried to drag Wade from the prostate body on the forest floor.
It wasn't crammed in the drop ship and everyone mostly stayed away from each other. Rumlow's group manned the first floor, which was fine by Clint since he liked high places anyway, so he clambered up onto the second floor with Thor, Bruce, a nice dude named T'Challa and some other kids who he could tolerate more than the others.
'Did you find any magazines?' she asked, weighing the gun in her hand. It was a good one. She loved using the Glock series because they were handguns, more her style than massive sniper rifles.
'Yeah, buddy, just don't accidentally kill one of us, okay? That thing was heavy. We took turns carrying it back but Loki was slumming it more than the rest of us. I think it was really important to him or else he wouldn't have done it. You know Loki.'
Natasha knew it would take days of walking to reach Mount Weather, even though there was a minecart system at one point. They'd stocked up on supplies and all of them were carrying backpacks. Loki had assured them that the tunnel had rest stops which led outside and they could refill their water bottles and hunt but they weren't taking any chances.
James came to stand by Natasha. She was hyper-aware of him. The gun on his hip, his soft brown hair, his relaxed stance - and his eyes. His light blue gaze was on her, watching her movements - she could sense it, and she was more affected by it than she'd like to admit. She turned away a bit so he wouldn't see the light color on her cheeks.
'Brother, calm down. If I do not do this they will see me as a murderer and a backstabber for the rest of our time here. I wish to do this. I want to be useful,' Loki explained. He sounded sincere enough, but there was a gleam in his eye that Thor did not like one bit. Loki was planning something.
For a moment, a flash of something - pride, maybe, with a bit of sadness - lit up Loki's cold gaze, and his mouth opened a little, as if he was going to say something, but then he shut it after reconsidering. He simply nodded at Thor, slipped out of the gates and vanished from sight.
'Hey, will you two lovebirds stop eye-fucking each other? There's kids around, ya know! Get a room, or tent, or something!' Barton yelled, making Steve's face burn in embarrassment and causing Tony to shout back, 'You're just jealous no one would eye-fuck you, Barton!' which earned a fair amount of snickering from all those in earshot.
'So... you were working with them to save your life... and they killed Pietro but you took credit?' Steve said slowly, and Loki nodded.
'There was a barrel of gunpowder up there. He must've used it to make the hole. He's long gone now.' Tony's voice sounded distant and flat to his own ears.
'Yes, gladly,' Thor replied, his eyes lighting up. He turned to Jane, who rolled her eyes at him fondly.
'Oh, my god, Jane, you will not believe this, I just met this incredibly hot blond guy, I think his name is Clint or something - woah,' she broke off her rant to stop and stare and Thor, and then she nudged Jane with her shoulder and winked. Jane's cheeks flushed.
They watched the fight commence in silence after that. Thor successfully held down his little brother and knocked out one of Rumlow's goons, too. Steve, Bucky and Clint dealt considerable damage to Rumlow and the other kid - Jasper Sitwell, Bruce remembered - but they weren't unscathed. Clint's lip was bleeding, Bucky was wiping away blood and Steve was clutching his stomach where Rumlow had hit him.
By the time they made it to the bunker, she was nearly unconscious. Bruce cleaned the blood and bandaged her head wound. He laid a cool wet cloth across her forehead as she settled onto the bed and he also gave her something called Tylenol, which contained acetaminophen, according to the bottle. Thankfully the drop ship hadn't sent them down without basic medicine.
They also had been stocking up - both for the winter and for defending themselves against the unknown humans. Bucky and Natasha described them as dressed in gear from head to toe, each with several visible guns and undoubtedly several concealed on their person, with the symbol of a red skull and tentacles on their breast.
'Sure,' he told her, and her eyes lit up. He scooted a bit so she would have space and she sat down next to him, holding out the can. He peeked into it and saw squares of meat. 'Are you sure we can eat this without getting - y'know - poisoned? It's been there in the bunker for a century. I thought it would be rice, or something - not meat,' he said doubtfully.
He was the next to sign up, and he'd given Natasha his best puppy-dog eyes until she caved and reluctantly said she was coming as well. Clint was very proud of his puppy-dog eyes.
Steve wheezed and began to retch again. Angrily, he held up a hand, signalling Bucky to stay back, and stumbled into the drop ship, where Bruce and Betty were caring for the sick delinquents. He hadn't felt this bad since the old days, when he was a skinny scarecrow with asthma and around ten other disabilities.
A twitching delinquent lay on the ground, covered in burns, her eyes clouded over. She was trying to speak but nothing came from her mouth except for a gargling, indecipherable string of noises. Her hands clawed uselessly at the dirt and her legs were kicking slightly. She was dying.
If you had more than one kid you were floated and anyone who helped you conceal the other kid would either be put in jail or floated as well. Wanda and Pietro's mother had twins, nothing she could control, but she hid it from everyone and only presented Pietro to the world. His younger sister Wanda was hidden - no one knew she existed until she snuck out of her family's cabin and was caught by the guards.
Wherever he was, it wasn't pleasant. Blood and dirt stuck to his face, he could barely breathe, and every movement made him wheeze.
Some kids, like T'Challa, Sam and Scott, were just watching the carnage unfold, their faces bearing the same expression as Bruce. Steve looked at all of them desperately. 'You need to help, they're going to beat him to death,' he said, troubled.
Steve passed a hand over his face, trying not to think of the Helicarrier. Mrs. Barnes' death had been a crushing blow. She had taken him in when his ma had died, cared for him like her own son, given him the same amount of love she'd given Bucky. He'd sat in his tent and Tony had sat with him, wrapping his arms around him, and Steve had unashamedly sobbed on his boyfriend's shoulder.
And now Clint could feel fingers entangled with his, a girl's hand, judging by how soft it was, and quiet voices discussing something he couldn't quite catch.
'The lander activated,' Tony said into the silence. When they looked at him, he clarified, 'The lander is a brace of parachutes, it's designed to activate to help our landing. We're fine now, it's working.' He heard the sighs of relief go around the room.
He scrabbled at the dirt around the gap. As he'd expected, it was very loose and came away easily. There were rocks as well, and he pulled them out, praying that the ceiling wouldn't collapse on him. It hurt like a bitch, partly because of his insane headache and partly because widening a hole wasn't the most easiest thing he'd ever done.
Thor sighed. He had been on the guard the night before so he had the day off today. The border patrol and the hunting party had left long back. He didn't know what to do. He'd tried to help Nakia and T'Challa train some of the younger kids in throwing knives but they were an efficient team and they clearly didn't need him.
Steve closed his eyes for a long moment, and then opened them. 'Stay here until you feel better, and then get out or else I'll let those two shoot you in the head,' he told Rumlow flatly, and then stalked out.
Rumlow laughed again, that same crazy laugh. 'Your sense of justice is fucking twisted, and I hope you know that,' he spat to everyone at large, and stalked off, closely followed by his two buddies. They went a good distance away and watched, hatred in their eyes, as everyone stared at the still-belligerent Loki.
She finally got up and Vision took her place. Thor watched her wearily as she made her way to him. 'Hey. Can you help dig a grave for Pietro? Wanda wanted her brother to have a proper burial,' she told him, stopping in front of the tree he was sitting against.
Steve tried not to let his fear show. He knew Rumlow enjoyed having control over the situation, playing with Steve's life. He wouldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing Steve was absolutely terrified.
'They really did stay up all night, didn't they?' Clint asked, looking at where Bruce had just left.
The four of them spread out, searching the ground for any indication of where Clint went. Natasha was attempting to climb the tree directly behind the spot where he'd disappeared. The antelope was long gone.
'Yeah. I mean, by the amount of flirting we've been doing, I think it's safe to say I'm interested in you, and you're interested in me, right?' he asked.
Natasha, orphaned at four, was taken in by Ivan Petrovich and put into the Red Room training program, which groomed young girls and taught them the art of killing, seduction - they were trained assassins. Natasha had been the best out of all of them, which was why she was chosen for
Rhodey had been smarter and paced in front of the drop ship like a caged tiger until Tony came out, cleared by Bruce as mildly ill, recovering and ready to go out and blow shit up.
'What? They're done? They found out what was in the poultice?' She sat up straight and hopped off the couch, frustration sinking in. If she wasted precious time napping in the bunker -
He wanted Steve to die in one specific way, and Steve had an unpleasant feeling that he knew what was coming.
Tony couldn't speak. He knew it shouldn't matter, his father was only saying that to make him feel bad, but it stung. It stung to hear the man who was part of the reason he existed, who had given him his childhood and who had raised him for sixteen years speak like that.
Turns out that vague, obscure sicknesses that made you bleed like a fountain did not listen very well.
She looked down at her own cup of Unity Juice. She had no idea what was in it but it tasted good, so she continued drinking it, watching as everyone else joked around and laughed. There was a festive spirit in the air. She could sense it. Maybe it was the fact that Scott also had whiskey from the bunkers and was giving it out to the older kids.
He turned around to look for Tony, scanning the camp. He knew for a fact that all the delinquents had returned - he'd specifically ordered it.
Natasha looked up and gave them a thumbs-up, signalling that she'd found something. Clint darted back. 'Antelope,' he whispered. 'Blackbuck antelope, if you want to be specific, but it's food, and we've found it.' Tony let out a very soft whoop and Bucky grinned.
'Oh, my God, that's wonderful! I've been dying to meet you! I love meeting people from the other space stations. It's such a surreal experience! Especially from Asgard. I was studying to become a foreign diplomat, you know, as well as taking advanced astrophysics. It's a pleasure,' she said, all in a rush, and he smiled at her.
'They did it, they really did,' Steve whispered, and he nodded. 'Never doubted them,' he said bitterly, and Steve was shocked by the acid in his best friend's voice.
Natasha rolled her eyes. 'You're drunk off your ass, Clint. Ever stop to think about the fact that you nearly died a few days ago?'
Jane appeared next to him. It had become a common thing for the two of them to sneak out and watch the stars at night. Everyone knew about it and they all didn't care. Steve had spoken to him once, telling him to be careful, and that was it.
'Okay, your disastrous love affair aside, do you wanna come with me and Clint? We're going hunting again, but this time deeper into the jungle. I think Nat's coming too but I don't know,' Bucky questioned.
Tony narrowed his eyes at a small twelve year old boy with a soft face and messy brown hair, who stared back at him with defiant brown eyes until he looked away and directly at an absolutely stunning boy. With silky soft blond hair, baby blue eyes and the stature of a Greek god, he was definitely the most beautiful person Tony had ever seen in his entire life.
Loki had somehow persuaded the residents of the Helicarrier to take him in, but he didn't stay in their good books for long. He was caught hoarding and smuggling supplies which were vital for other people and he was thrown into jail. Thor hadn't been as lucky as Loki at convincing the guards he would be a good citizen and he'd been put in the cell beside his brother's.
For all his traveling, Tony had never been, and he found himself almost excited to go. He wasn’t certain what cell he wanted to visit – he was highly considering the biological telemetry research lab, but there was also a quadrant that held a small zoo for crippled or healing Terran animals that he secretly had a bit of an interest in visiting.
It’s about – why I didn’t want to put myself through this again.” Tony rubs a hand over his face, leaving his hand over his mouth. “And I just—”
“What’s the plan?” Steve asks. He looks over at the building. It’s surrounded by a chainlinked fence. Two doors, one on the right, one in the middle. The middle is padlocked, the right one looks open and has stairs leading to it. There appears to be a basement on the building. There’s probably rooftop access to the back left.
“Yeah,” Tony answers, distracted. “I try to read a – shit – a bit about each planet that’s important to the federation. That’s the recommended Earth volume.”
“Still,” Tony says, and doesn’t let his voice fall into his default flippancy. “Thank you.” A squeeze. “I know you won’t waste it.”
After he got the body back to the ship, he was quickly taken into the medbay and Tony was quickly ushered out. He’s a little offended – on the brink of a lot offended, come on, he was the one who
“Vulcan is a peaceful planet of peaceful beings,” his father had told him. “We do not fight. We do not encourage fighting. However, we have enough sense to realize that our way is not the only way practiced in the galaxy. Many others engage in wars. These uncivilized planets will need weapons, and will ultimately obtain them from somewhere.  It is only logical, given that they will obtain the weapons even without our intervention, that we capitalize on the need and supply them with our own. War may be profitable, even if it is not logical.”
Steve laughs, like he doesn’t know what else to do, still staring at Tony with that restless confusion.
Steve’s brow furrows as he looks into space, and, after a moment, he looks down at his stocking feet and says, “I don’t remember.”
“These are a lot of declarative sentences,” Tony says, crossing his arms. “Not a lot of them are actually accurate.”
“All this accumulation of knowledge,” Tony says one day, when they’re watching WALL-E. Steve is trying to make it through all of the Pixar movies. “You now could write like, 70 years of entertainment.”
Tony’s just obliviously munching on some bizarre popcorn – why does he insist on finding strange, Whole Foods versions of food? Why does popcorn need to be vegan and gluten free? – while Steve is having a miniature existential crisis a cushion away.
Vaguely, it registers with him that he’s kind of being an asshole. Somewhere in his head, he knows that Tony is doing him a huge favor, letting him stay in his place, taking his time out to teach him, giving him a gym to work out in.
And even with the expansions, even with the divisions, even with the changes of pace – still, weapons sold.
soon. He doesn’t have time to email the board of directors back about the stock prices, like he even cares.
It isn’t perfect – trust him, he realizes that – but he also realizes it IS better. In a lot of ways, and in a lot of ways he doesn’t think the world will be able to take that step back from.
“Please,” he can hear himself beg. He refuses to feel shame over it. There’re so many better things to feel ashamed of, in his life. “Please. We won’t tell the media. We won’t tell anyone. I just disappear and reappear in the engine room of whatever is your least important ship.”
“They must have been looking for me,” Tony says. “But couldn’t identify me through the suit. Now that they know—oh, shit, one second.”
Even then, given the distance, it couldn't be in real-time, and instead was a sub-space communication, text-only for faster travel.
everything instead of just accept it as is and move on, he’d lose his mind. It’s been his decided mindset since waking up – just nod and question nothing. It has to be easier, in the long run.
Tony holds his gaze for a beat, and then shoves the sheet metal off the table, where it clatters, echoing in the basement. He brushes his hands on his jeans and walks over to Steve. He puts his hands in his pockets and rocks on his heels, looking considering.
Steve looks hurt, and says something akin to, “I’ve never had more than one friend at a time,” and the only honest response Tony has is, “Yeah, me neither, and maybe that’s a problem.”
Steve glances back down at the PADD, quickly scrolling through. “It only said it was a natural fungus that destroyed food supplies.” Steve glances up. His confusion is seeping through the bond, and it makes something in Tony curl in self-loathing. “Why would you make a fungus?”
The third time he uses a word that Tony has to look up the meaning of, he wonders why he’s even bothering. If he should even bother.
“Yeah, because it makes me look dashing and handsome and rich. Yours was probably bought at what, a Men’s Wearhouse?”
“I finished it,” Tony says. His drunken grin has the edge of something wrong with it. Steve’s never really been a heavy drinker, but he grew up in an Irish community right after prohibition, he’s seen heavy drinkers, and he knows some become far happier, almost giddy, more exuberant versions of themselves, while others turn sad, and dark, like something is closing in on them.
Steve laughs, then groans. “Hey, don’t make me laugh. My ribs hurt.” He lets out a pained breath. “But yeah – they said they were concerned with how the dermal regenerator might interact with my healing factor. So while the spleen and concussion are taken care of, I got to live with the bruising.”
It takes a second, but once Steve fully processes that sentence, he really wonders how you can have a meeting in Japan and not leave more than a week in advance.
guy, okay. He apologies to Roomba when he pets her too hard, he goes out of his way to be polite to strangers, he calls people sir and ma’am on the phone, he offered to pay for a dish he broke, he is respectful, he has manners, he’s kind.
Originally, it was a maintenance closet for the warp core. In his first year, Tony had done a lot of unauthorized upgrades, and it rendered a lot of the equipment obsolete. He had emptied it in his own good time, and instead of reporting it, had used it for this and that, whatever he didn’t want to be out in the open. Recently, it’s become the place where he’s tested the holodeck.
He mostly said it to embarrass her, and is caught off guard by the look of surprise that quickly crosses her face before she masks it.
Steve doesn’t know how to do this. Something’s wrong, that much is obvious, but how he’s supposed to subtly needle Tony into opening up is a job far beyond his pay grade. Lord, he’d like to - but what is he supposed to say?
Steve nods, trying not to look ungrateful. Tony gets like this sometimes, like he has to occasionally give you something to convince you to stay. It’s unnecessary and it makes Steve kind of sad, but fighting about it is historically an exercise in futility, so he just picks up a mug of coffee and takes a sip.
She also knows Vulcans, having been stationed on Vulcan before her admission to Starfleet. They’re not what he would consider close friends, but if they’ve ever bonded, it’s over that. Vulcan voodoo may fool the rest, but she should know better.
“How does it—” Steve stops suddenly, and looks around Tony’s arm. “Tony, is there something black on your neck?”
Tony flaps his hand. “Do you see me mixing chemicals, Agent? No. I’m just deeply fascinated by the science behind the somehow breathing Capsicle you got there. So, when are you going to wake him?”
“I’m not all that concerned with the rank.” Steve gazes around the ship, fingers tapping on his knee, and Tony’s suddenly, viscerally aware that this is the first conversation he’s ever initiated with Steve. “I didn’t know what to do – after. This was something to do. Something good.”
“Tony,” Steve continues, ignoring him. He sounds strangely urgent. “If you have that – why are you here? Why are you alone?”
He figures he should probably be feeling grief. He’s lost more than probably any other person in history – his home, his culture, his friends, his life, his understanding of life. It’s like it’s too much for his brain to truly process, so instead of wallowing in the tragedy of it, his thoughts shy away from all thoughts, leaving him alone in the quiet of the penthouse.
(That fact, that fact that Tony knows so, so well, did not cross his mind on a sunny day on Earth, with his arm in a sling, his foot wrapped, his head in his hands, his shoulders shaking from dry sobs, Rhodey’s arm around his shoulder, a resignation and ownership transfer letter burning in his outbox, and a damning search for Vulcan toxins in his search history.))
Steve’s lips are dry against his own, but gentle, and his hand is so soft cradling the back of his neck. Tony’s careful with his response, following Steve’s lead and letting Steve have control, pressing back softly but noticeably. Tony can’t help but catalogue the sensations of the kiss: the small exhale of breath as Steve pulls back a fraction, the fullness of his bottom lip, the heat from his mouth, the slow trembling of his hand. Tony lifts his own hand and places it gently on Steve’s hip, fingers pressing in softly, and he can feel the stutter of breath as Steve feels his response.
“Sure,” Tony laughs, patting him on the shoulder. Bruce looks up from the tricorder and catches his eye, real relief in his smile, and then continues his examination.
Tony stops and straightens. He flips his goggles to the top of his head. His spiky, brown hair fills them, and something about it sort of makes Steve ache.
“Yes sir,” comes his voice, and Tony smiles. “May I put some information in our system about your guest?”
Look, Tony has had a lot of tough challenges – making the reactor in a cave with a box of scraps comes to mind – but he’s man enough to admit that getting Captain America’s body out of there unscathed is an absolute bitch.
Steve’s a little embarrassed to admit it later, but he spends the next fifteen minutes after that – and there’s no other word for it – interrogating Tony. Tony’s a remarkably good sport about it, despite his eyes widening almost comically when Steve clasped his shoulders and stared him in the eye, or how he leaned back so far to get away from Steve’s touch that he actually tripped over his own foot.
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupts, but Tony can see Steve start to let go, though he keeps a firm grip on his neck, and his other hand goes to secure the man’s right hand, which was twitching. “I have identified him as Ivan Vanko, the son of a Russian physicist.”
Her hand is back on his arm, cradling his elbow, and he looks at her in mild surprise. “Mr. Stark, I’d really urge you to reconsider.”
“Maybe?” Steve half-shrugs, a small smile threatening to widen. “I wasn’t ever made to fall in line.”
“I mean, yes, there’s that. But it’s the men too. They all look different. There’s so much less…” He trails off, looking uncertain.
And if he could prevent it from happening again, and didn't, it would place Coulson's death on his shoulders.
“Coulson,” Tony greets when the turbolift opens, pleasantly surprised. “What brings you as a giant head on our tele-screen?”
As it stands, what’s he going to tell her? He needed a roommate for rent money? He’s a boyfriend that won’t go away? He’s a homeless dude Tony took pity on?
“Pepper,” Tony says, finally letting his tone shift to serious. “Part of being in my position is getting to decide how I want to live my life. And if I decide I want to change it, then that’s my choice. And no one gets a say, not even you.”
“I like a project to focus on,” Tony says, hands never stilling. “Always better with something to do.”
“Sure, Cap,” Tony answers vaguely, and somewhat catalogues the odd looks he’s receiving from the crew, particularly Bruce and Natasha.
Feeling awkward and slightly steamrolled, he walks over to the table and sits down, and looks rather helplessly at the many – sixteen, his mind helpfully supplies – plates of food.
The Worra sector was infamous for its brutality, constant warfare, and slave trade. The Federation had no jurisdiction in the quadrant, nor extradition, which spelled bad news for the unfortunate Orion Starfleet Officer, Maras, who had been extraordinarily unlucky with where her shuttle chose to make a crash landing.
The only person he ever was able to be around without substantial, concentrated effort was Bucky, and that was more because Bucky had decided at some point to keep Steve no matter what, and there was nothing Steve could do to dissuade him.
“It’s a recreational simulator I’ve been working on,” Tony explains. Steve looks over at him, and there’s so much raw, naked wonder on his face, that Tony has to look down.
“You don’t know that,” Steve says. “Even a penny thrown out of a window could kill someone from high enough, and we’re on a really high floor.”
Tony looks worried, and something in Steve’s throat wants to close up, his stomach starting to spin, and this is
They don’t say a word through the whole thing, and part of it is deathly uncomfortable, but something feels looser by the end.
It came after Tony had offered himself up as a human sacrifice on a mission. In his defense, the leaders of that colony were requesting it be Peter, the young and bright science ensign intern, and like
“Given the drone performance I just saw, I really don’t think it is possible to underestimate you,” Tony says.
“If this doesn’t work,” Tony says. “We’re still naming this element after me. Stark-isium. Stark-rilium. Tony-gen. Badassium. I’ll be in every textbook in the world – my dream.”
Whatever the reason for the initial refusal, Steve’s noticeably relaxing against his pillow. “So, Tony,” he says, and Tony glances away from where Bruce is still tensely typing buttons. “What happened?”
Not a particularly reassuring reminder, but Tony opens the document all the same. He pages through it quickly – all his money will go to various charities, his estates to Pepper, his science equipment dedicated to the federation, with Rhodey reserving the right for first grabs of any of his possessions.
Tony’s face pulls together, and when he takes a step forward, it occurs to Steve that they are probably in a real, proper fight here.
Tony’s staring at the lever, hyper-focused, and Steve realizes with a burst of clarity something he already kind of knew, like putting a video from 240px to 1080px – that Tony doesn’t want this either. But neither of them are going to say a word. Tony's always been far too willing to sacrifice himself, his own happiness.
“You misunderstand, under normal circumstances, that’s a great idea, and I’d be all into that idea and exploring all of its – assets. But not now. You have to know better than that. I have an expiration date.”
Steve’s eyes snap to Coulson. The flit down, then up, and then snap to Tony. Tony waves, short, once, and Steve looks back at Coulson.
Tony looks at him, dead on, eyes catching eyes, before Tony looks away, staring at the far wall in silence.
“They were in the debriefing I was given. Along with hundreds of other species,” he says, tone only a touch bitter. “But Vulcans were first contact, so they featured a lot. Your personal debrief mentioned you’d be a bit different, but—”
He couldn’t help being logical, of being able to compute math without thinking, of reasoning before thinking – but he could control what he did with that fact. He could twist the logic into something all his own – make math into art.
“It’s the best I can hope for,” Tony says, with probably too little mirth, because Steve just looks more unhappy.
Tony loves him – he really does, truly, in a way he’s actually gained up the courage to admit to himself – but dear fucking god if he
“Thanks, boo,” Tony says, and flings the folder back at Steve, who catches it one-handed, the coordinated dick.
“The Asgardian,” Captain Rogers supplies, and Romanoff smiles at him, just a little, which is a good sign for him.
fallen asleep. Granted, he was in the middle of a dream where he was back in Afghanistan and they injected him with liquid palladium, and he could feel it coursing through his veins, so it wasn’t like he was
Tony wants to think of the proper answer, the witty response that’ll smooth this over, the lie so perfected that there are no holes to poke, but his mind is blank.
By this time, Tony has completely taken apart the engine of his Ferrari. He’s currently about a quarter of the way through designing it to run completely on water – just for the fuck all of it – when JARVIS announces Steve’s return.
Tony is also glad he’s a billionaire – he’s always glad he’s a billionaire, mind you, but he’s a lot more glad when it means he can get million dollar pieces of scientific equipment sent to his house in under six hours rather than the normal month.
Captain Rogers raises his hand in a decent attempt of the ta’al. While it’s a polite attempt, and shows him as well researched, something about the gesture rankles Tony. He walks out from behind the console and up to Rogers, and holds out a hand to shake.
Steve walks in, gathers all the courage he doesn’t have, and says without any preamble, “Okay. So what to do I do?”
In deep space, Tony had been able to intercept and change the transmissions before Captain Coulson had read them. He suspected Coulson had known, but with an ever-passive face, Coulson had agreed.
Steve leans back in his chair. It creaks with his weight, bending slightly, and he can feel Steve’s strong, unwavering gaze on his face, even as Tony studiously stares at the wall behind him.
If partnership had been some great, untouchable dream of his, this was unfathomable. Unattainable. Or, apparently more accurately, unretainable.
A dam of ideas and futures break open in his head – not letting Bucky go on the mission, he and Bucky drinking together to celebrate the end of the war, Bucky at his wedding, he at Bucky’s, growing old together in the same neighborhood.
Well – JARVIS did inform Tony that Steve had read all of the information Tony sent about LGBT+ rights. Not only that, Steve actually asked Tony for a list of movies with LGBT representation so he could get used to it being public, whatever that meant. They had passed a kissing male couple the other week, too, and Steve hadn’t done anything but smile slightly to himself.
Back in his private quarters, the silence is deafening. His breath is heavy, and eyes are moist. He feels like he’s being crushed under the weight of possibility, of the knowledge of what is somehow available to him, what he can’t let himself have.
“Interview?” Tony repeats, putting down the rubix cube he was fiddling with while talking. “Why would I interview—”
“It—” His heart is beating, oh god, his blood is pumping so quickly. “It looks to be some sort of – new element.”
“No,” Tony responds, disbelieving. “I want to know why we just had a heart-to-heart about World War II war sex, actually.”

He thought it would be easier to bite the bullet and tell everyone he cared about – wow, a crowd composed of three whole people – in one punch.
century – they’ll still be laws, and they’ll still be bureaucracy, and they’ll still be rules to follow.” He holds Tony’s eye through gritted breath. “But I will never put rules or organization above my morals. That may make me a bad Captain – so be it.”
He listens to JARVIS’s reports of information Tony has complied as he works out, which brings him to point 2: working till he drops.
“About me?” Tony gets off the bed, and stands next to where Vanko’s body is pinned. Steve doesn’t appear to be letting up. “Hey, you.” He kicks Vanko in the side. “Hey.” Another kick. “Hey. What do you have against me?”
And so comes a list, a truly eye bugging list, of all the charities and organizations Tony’s donated to.
“Counter offer,” Tony says, stepping forward towards the bed. He puts a hand on Coulson’s shoulder, and God, Steve must be
“Let’s go this way,” Tony interrupts, and starts stalking towards the right hand door. Steve feels a spike of real irritation that he didn’t expect, and finds himself grabbing Tony’s arm and yanking him back towards him. Tony stumbles backwards, and Steve starts pulling him to the left.
Steve raises a hand to his mouth, closing his eyes. The words hurt, in a way he’s sure Tony didn’t intend, but it brings to the forefront of his mind the thought he’s been trying not to have – he has so much to mourn, after this.
“You too, boo.” He keeps one arm around Rhodey’s shoulders and pulls him towards Steve, who has dropped his defensive stance and instead has taken to standing awkwardly like a giant lug.
“That’s not good,” Steve snaps, then regrets it as Tony’s head droops even further. “Look,” he starts again. “You don’t
An hour after turning off the TV, he registers that Tony’s walked in the room, but he keeps his head in, staring straight at the bag, rhythmically punching it just enough that it’ll look impressive but won’t actually break the thing.
Once Tony knows what buttons not to push, starts to anticipate how to ask questions to get an answer, figures out what's most likely to make Steve laugh and what's more likely to make him clam up - it gets to be just plain
Thirty minutes later, emails answered, Pepper’s angry text replied to, three games of Tetris given up on, and he’s hacked into the ship’s sonar and changed their direction remotely.
“I suppose it doesn’t matter much to me,” Steve muses, and Tony looks over to him in surprise, unable to hold his reaction. Steve volunteering personal information is fairly new.
section. If anything, he thought the admirals at Starfleet may get a kick out of it, a laugh for the breakroom.
That night, Tony also finds out he can, actually, still feel the joy that comes with pointless fun, even if he hasn’t felt it in decades.
The TV flips on to something that’s on a commercial break, and Tony goes back to determinedly eating his noodles.
Tony stands behind the transporter console, fingers drumming. He isn’t usually requested to be on many away missions, which allows him a certain (large) number of hours to devote to his own personal projects, so long as they don’t interfere with his duties.
“Yeah,” Steve says, totally sure and warm. He tilts his head back, and lets the rain fall on his face.
Tony finds himself alone in his bedroom one afternoon, sifting through a pile of papers for concept designs for more green energy products.
Tony lifts his head from where he was staring holes into the tablet, looking puzzled. “What are you talking about? Of course your room is fine. You’ve had it for three months. If it wasn’t fine, you would have done something to it by now.” Steve goes to disagree, but Tony’s still talking, flapping his hand. “No. I mean, you’re not happy in this time. In the 21
“The drones were modeled after the armor, they would shoot each other,” Hammer interrupts, angry and twitching. “It had to be your face.”
People complain a lot about the state of the world, Steve knows. JARVIS told him. But they’re looking upward from their place on the shoulders of giants, imagining higher.
Tony groans. “This is why I shouldn’t get drunk.” He sits up, his feet landing on the ground. He puts his elbows on his knees, and buries his head in his hands. “You know, I was always told counseling is for the pathetic and sad, and therapy is just for those actually insane, and real men are made of iron and just grit their teeth and move on, because everyone hates themselves and there’s just better pretending - and that’s how I’ve handled it for forty years but you know, that’s not working out so well.”
“How do you know what type of paint was used in order to curate the cleaning solution?” Tony asks, fascinated.
She’s busy, so it only happens three times – but each time he gets blazingly drunk afterwards. She’s sweet, because she’s always sweet, but there’s such an undercurrent of worry there.
