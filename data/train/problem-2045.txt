“Ten hours, thirty-six minutes.” Sherlock glanced at his watch and followed the grey haired man down the corridor towards the morgue. He held Maeve close to his body and stood outside of the door when Greg walked in to inform Molly of their arrival.
“And I’m just saying,” Siger said with force, “that sitting here insulting my son will not impress me or anybody here, it will alienate you from further events.”
Sherlock was lain out flat on his back, a blanket beneath him on the floor between the two armchairs. Maeve was on his naked chest, resting on her tummy and equally as naked in just a nappy. He was wearing only trousers and socks, eyes fixed on Maeve as she lifted her head in short unsure movements, strengthening the back and neck. They had already used the colourful tummy time mat, now he was keeping her company. She didn’t like being left alone for too long and preferred to be in Sherlock’s company.
Sherlock pulled open the front door and a rush of cold air hit him in the face, blowing his already messy curls back from his face. He was dressed and the papoose strapped beneath his coat, which had Maeve facing him with her head resting on his chest. One large hand was resting on her back. He stepped outside and closed the door, placing his now free hand on her head. She had a hat on and a coat. His coat acted as protection against the cold summer night wind.
“Have a lovely dinner and a nice stay,” he said to John’s parents and left, with one last look at the cat shooting daggers at him.
“I can’t.” Sherlock interrupted. His eyes flicked over the occupants of the room, Sally had lowered her head and was pretending (badly but with good intentions) to look at the case file while Anderson looked out of the window. “I can’t imagine what these parents are going through, and, I can’t, I won’t be able to think if she’s taken away from me.”
“Mycroft, no this is important, I need to speak with him now…Anthea, someone’s taken Maeve.” Sherlock could hear John speaking but was too focused on the passing people. “Mycroft, thank God, someone’s taken Maeve, yes, she’s gone! We were at a scene, an officer was meant to be watching her, she’s gone.”
“Yeah.” John gave a small nod and rose to his feet. He rocked his body from side to side and hushed Maeve gently, his lips pressed against her hair.
“Case.” Sherlock finally looked up from his phone and blinked for a moment before looking down at John and Maeve.
Hey I've been super stressed recently so please, just be patient with me while I work on this because I'm in week two of my final year of uni and its super stressful. I will update as soon as I am possible.
The older man then looked down at Maeve and nodded towards her, Mycroft followed his gaze, he added, “doesn’t she make you all broody though?”
“Of course I tasted it,” Sherlock snapped in response, not taking his eyes off of Maeve. “What do you think?”
Sherlock stepped inside the large changing room and locked the door behind himself, he exhaled loudly, dropped his bags onto the small bench and brought Maeve away from his chest to look into her slightly sleepy eyes. “We’re going to go swimming.”
“She is much like her father in that regard,” Mycroft placed the tumbler on the table and stepped elegantly over to his partner. He took a moment to appreciate the pair of them before edging closer, wrapping his arm around Greg’s waist.
“Uncle Mycroft will be here soon.” He told her. “And Daddy is bringing back takeaway for dinner tonight. We’re having Chinese, one day you’ll be old enough to eat with us.”
Good news is that I've planned out the next fifteen or so chapters, which also took forever because I'm having to do all sorts of research into babies, the important milestones e.c.t.
A doctor, a middle aged man with grey hair at his temples, and their doctor, Doctor Green came from the doors, stepping into the hallway. Their eyes immediately landed on Mycroft and Anthea who stood as they entered.
“Everything looks good, Mr Holmes.” The nurse said. Mycroft turned to face her. “Have you got a name in mind?”
“Yeah, that’s better.” John put the bowl of ice back on the table and sat back in his chair, relieved. “Hopefully she’ll have a sleep soon.”
Sherlock stopped in front of the large town house, John’s eyes widened but he didn’t comment. He knew that Sherlock came from money but a house in Kensington bloody palace gardens was not was he was expecting. A black car pulled up beside them, drawing out a low groan of annoyance from the consulting detective. The elder Holme sibling stepped out, hooking his umbrella over his arm with grace and straightening his suit jacket meticulously.
They found themselves at Angelo’s for dinner, on their usual table that Angelo insisted on reserving with Maeve replacing the chairs so that she was looking at Sherlock from inside her pram, they had changed it back to a pram as opposed to the car seat setting on the deep purple buggy. Maeve was awake but keeping herself entertained with the arch above her pram, toys and a mirror hanging above her. They had already ordered, water with ice and a glass of red wine in front of them both.
“Two sugars.” Sherlock smiled. Violet rolled her eyes but pushed herself to her feet and went into the kitchen. He called after her. “The cupboard on the right.”
He was right, the photograph was very nice and the first of its kind in the flat but Sherlock doubted it would be the last. It was black and white, Maeve lying on her back atop of a teal silk sheet. She was completely nude, with her knees bent and a foot covering her privates. Both of her hands were resting on her torso. Her dark hair was neat and long eyelashes resting against her rosy cheeks, pink lips pursed thoughtfully as though he was thinking hard in her sleep.
John was continuing in burping her, rubbing her back with a protective muslin over his clothes. She looked happier now that she’d been sick. “Poor baby,” John cooed.
“Whatever you want.” Greg decided with a firm nod of his head. He couldn’t resist running his thumb over the sleeping babies face, she didn’t stir despite her light sleep.
“No, this is different.” Sherlock shook his head, mind swimming with the onslaught of new information and shut his eyes for a moment to regain some clarity.
He stormed into the room, not bothering to knock. John startled awake, sitting up in his bed completely alert within a moment. Sherlock opened his mouth to speak but shut it again, suddenly very aware that it was early hours of the morning, he was holding his daughter and John wasn’t wearing a top. His eyes were glued to the ex-soldiers chest, he was tanned and muscular despite his time away from the army. The scar on his shoulder was mesmerising, still pink in the middle but faded into silver in the web of the wound.
“She’s fussy.” Sherlock announced as he allowed John to take her from him, with a small annoyed grumble from Maeve as she settled in John’s shorter secure arms and went back to her bottle with energy. John rolled his eyes at the consulting detective as he picked up the journal and began reading, eyes skimming over the scribbled handwriting with interest.
“- is having with our three month old daughter. Shameful really,” he couldn’t suppress the smile. “Shameful.”
“I’m working.” The auburn hair man told him, leaning back in his chair and crossing one leg over the other.
Sherlock’s eyes widened marginally but he didn’t respond, instead he shrugged and turned his head to face the back of the sofa; nose pressing against the top of Maeve’s hair. The soft strands tickled his nose, he ignored the sensation and closed his eyes.
John did just that, he watched. The pair of them waited, wrapped up together in blankets with baby Maeve sleeping soundly, until the first glimmer of light appeared on the horizon behind the shadows of the trees and long expanses of garden. They watched the sun rise with abundance of colour until the room was full of light and the garden shedding its coat of dew in way for another beautiful summer day.
Sherlock shifted Maeve slightly so that she was resting comfortably against him, head tucked into his collarbone as she started to drift back into sleep. He held the phone with his free hand. “Unavoidable?”
They were stood outside the building. Mycroft lent against the clean black car watching as his brother bounced Maeve up and down rhythmically, her chin was on his shoulder and his hand rubbed her back in small circular motions. There was a muslin on his shoulder protecting his suit and a thin blanket held over her back, making sure that she was not only kept warm but protected against the warm sun.
He then made his way upstairs. John was sat in his arm chair, he folded the book in his hand and glanced over his shoulder at the consulting detective. The whole room was covered with bags and boxes from mothercare, their delivery from earlier. The place was clean in his absence and things packed away neatly.
“Good morning,” John smirked at the sight of an overly tired Sherlock. His hair was messy from sleep and his eyes still adjusting to the light, he blinked and rubbed his eyes.
Sherlock with his new found freedom scanned the room and gracefully sat down in one of the armchairs.
Sherlock turned back to the window and John swung his legs out of bed, pulling a blanket over his body in the process and got to his feet. The rugs covering the wooden floor was cold and he wanted nothing more than to lay back down and sleep, but he stood up and walked towards the window.
Violet looked alarmed but didn’t have much time to remedy that as Sherlock snatched the infant from her arms, his face full of worry. He pulled the baby close to his chest, his hand cradling her with great care as he bent his head down to whisper in her ear. “Shh, you’re ok. Everything is ok. Daddy is right here.” He started jiggling, moving her up and down while swaying slightly.
The moment the plane landed and the air hostess told them they were free to leave Sherlock grabbed the nappy bag, rose to his feet and rushed off of the plane leaving a confused John in his wake.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. His baby was currently sucking on his brother’s neck, small hands grasping the front of his suit. “She is a baby.” He said simply.
“We show my mother we are here, she’ll fuss then we can, hopefully, find somewhere to hide until dinner.”
Sherlock swept out of the room. John snorted and followed, it would have looked far more dramatic if he had been wearing his coat, but the consulting detective carried himself in a way that was both intimidating and elegant. Greg and Sally waited for John to pass before following.
“The man responsible for this, the man holding your son,” Sherlock cleared his throat, “he would have been watching your son, that means you may have seen him at some point, I’d like you to think back and inform one of the PC’s of anyone that strikes you, anything will help, and if we can get an accurate description then we may be able to ID him.”
“Well, that told us didn’t it.” John said to Maeve. She hit his chest with her fist. “Come on then.”
“Greg texted, after we left the crime scene, she was upset when you left her.” John told him, “and she prefers your company over anybody else’s, I live in the same house; feed her, change her and she would still rather be with you than me.”
I'm finished with exams and stuff!! So yes, plenty of time for writing. This chapter would have been done sooner but I had massive writers block.
“Is that the only noun available to those in this house?” He asked curiously, scooping Maeve up from the carseat and pausing for a moment with her just resting in his arms, still sound asleep.
“Okay.” Greg nodded and his face dropped. “I also got you some cufflinks, they’re in the bedroom in case you don’t want to wear the ring, you know, sentiment and all that.”
Enjoy, feedback is lovely as usual. Sorry if there are any mistakes, I've got lots of deadlines coming up so I'll be a little less active, you will have the next update soon though hopefully.
“The mother” The doctor continued. “A colleague of mine treated her, she came in two days ago with contractions and had” she gestured to the baby in Sherlock’s arms “this little lady that evening. They were kept in for observation and she left at nine o’clock this morning.”
“One of my many responsibilities as a father,” Sherlock said begrudgingly but the slight pull of his lips betrayed his cold image.
“No, but the paintings in the hallway use a similar brush stroke and palette of colour, one of which does have your signature, it’s a simple enough deduction that this is also one of your paintings.” Sherlock observed. “The frame is also handmade, Harold made it with great care and caution leading me to believe that he admires this painting above most, it’s his favourite but why? The scene is ordinary, somewhere in the Cotswolds judging from the local yellow limestone cottage and the scenery but it’s important, and aged, not new like the ones in the hallway, so this one is sentimental. A scene from a family holiday, the last one before John was deployed, if I’m right, but I’m always right.”
It hurt. He hadn’t expected it to hurt so much, leaving her for an extended period of time. His heart thumped and stopped when he saw a mother walking along with a pram, it felt wrong, so wrong to be without her. He knew she was fine and that Mycroft would take care of her, he even found himself with his phone out and writing out messages to his brother before he’d delete them and pocket the phone again. But this, right now, it felt right. He sighed in content against his daughter’s forehead, watching the strands of black hair move before he closed his eyes.
“So we look for clues at the scene, anything that can lead us to this…man!” John hissed the last word, obviously wanting to replace it with something more vulgar but stopping himself last minute with a glance at the snoring baby. “He must have tools of some sort that he uses and transports.”
Mycroft had showered, something which wasn’t as simple as it had been before with a new-born baby in tow. He left her in the bedroom with the door open and the baby monitor that Anthea had picked up. She didn’t as much as stir. When he was dry and dressed in a simple pair of navy blue slacks with a white shirt tucked in. He decided against the tie and waistcoat, instead, he placed a simple light grey jumper over the top. It wouldn’t do to be too dressed up with a new-born baby in the house. He was bound to get messy at some point.
"I… have never been so angry with him. He threatened you, to draw me out. It was so much like standing on that roof, with no choice. I told him he wasn't necessary to me. I told him he was a fool to leave you when I could never love him like you do."
Standing, John yanked his watch off and threw it on the table. He looked at it and shook his head, then returned his eyes to the cold face while wearing his own frosty military calm like a badge of dare.
"Your wish is my command," Sherlock said viciously. Sherlock reached into the desk drawer and pulled out John's Sig 226R and checked the mag and flicked off the safety.
Rat shook his head, “Wounded but already in the wind.  Pop or drop?” Rat demanded to know if John was in a condition to move or would he have to stay and play wounded innocent.
“There are always two of us. The two of us against the rest of the world?  Don’t you read the blog?  On your knees, Professor.  Hands behind your head.”
“If that is necessary, at least do it properly.” He cupped her head, fingers grasping her hair possessively and took her mouth with hunger, making her whimper as she fiddled with the phone. It took an inordinate amount of time to make the device do her bidding the second time. He didn’t stop for several minutes after the tell-tale click and long after both of them had begun to need more oxygen than normal respirations provided.
John shook his head. "Not precisely, but I did deduce some very enlightening truths. Something forced him. Not physically, something got in his head and it wasn't me. The fake call from you that wasn't you about Mrs. Hudson. The choice of method. Greg, he would not have been opposed to ending his life. His life was a toy to Sherlock. But that was not lethal enough. His ego would never have picked something he could have survived. He would have asked me questions and the second he realized he could survive with a damaged mind, he would have made other arrangements."
“No.” John cleared his throat, refusing to let his anger win. “But I would like to find every ounce you have in your possession and pour it out the window.”
She remembered the way she had giggled and protested and yet had wanted him with abandoned need. She had tried to warn herself that he wouldn't respect a girl who acted like such a whore for a man, but that thought hadn't stopped her from meeting his thrusts, lost in that building need of her own to be free and take the pleasure of him no matter the consequences. Her stomach fluttered at the recalled sensation of giving up all pretenses that she was not lost in him that moment. She closed her eyes and sighed, shakily placing her hand in that exact spot where she had allowed herself to be consumed beyond reason or thought.
John laughed and offered to refill Mycroft’s glass with the expensive whiskey he had bought John for some occasion he deemed within his boundary of proper behavior. Mycroft sipped delicately and Mary studied him closely but seemed satisfied.
"Yes, I did. But I think we both played our part in it, don't you? Now it's time for us to pay the price. Keep your wits, my dear. You will need them. "
"Thing is, we have a few CCTV frames, showing him walking with a man. We think it was him, not the best angle, but I hoped maybe he mentioned meeting a friend or where he was going after the park. If I didn't know better…I mean he was a tall sort, it kinda reminded me … never mind, of happier days. He didn't seem distressed. He was on the cameras for Tower Bridge rescue; he just was walking along and suddenly turned and climbed up and jumped. No standing there, no time for anyone to say a thing. Tosser with the camera phone was recordin' before. Would'a missed it entirely otherwise. Damnedest thing I ever … not a second's hesitation. Most pace back and forth and think about it. He didn't. I just can't get my head around that. He didn't think about any of us."
“ So, how do you plan to wake up? You need to wake up.  I will do whatever it takes, just tell me what you need.”
Tears filled John’s eyes and he looked up and sucked a breath before nodding. He opened his palms and shrugged as if to say ‘nothing to be done, it just happened.’ “Is that really so surprising? You had some prior first-hand experience with how it would feel. Irene Adler ring any bells? I knew the day I met you and I knew the day you died. Five-hundred-thirty days. That was all I got. It was the best time of my life. It was everything horrible and wonderful and quite insane and that was never going to happen to me again. The game was over. I hoped. Prayed. Begged. Cried like a fucking baby. Glad you didn’t see that actually. I dreamed of you and I hated myself for never having the damned balls to tell you what you meant to me. It might have made a difference, probably not. Definitely not because of the fake bit. But I didn’t know that then. I didn’t know.”
John finally agreed, holding the list and running all possible scenarios through his head as he tuned out all but the man before him.
"Machine." He hadn't meant it. He'd meant, notice me, explain to me, help me understand, let me in. Let me help. Stop being right and just be less wrong. He'd meant, If I can't hurt you, then it is true that you can't love me. That you don't' love me. That you never will love me. Please, stop being fake and show me you give a damned. Please love me back.
Rushing up the stairs he found a swollen gasping creature wearing Sherlock's hair and a suit bedazzled with stingers and alive with bees still struggling with the dismount.  It was something out of a horror movie and just as he thought this, a sodden bee crawled out of Sherlock's mouth.
Four hours later, Sherlock appeared at Mycroft's desk, smirking. "This should accomplish more than you hoped. They were both arrogant and spoke quite freely. Now where is he? I have yelling to pretend to listen to and I want to get it over as quickly as possible." Sherlock says rolling his neck and rubbing his left shoulder.
John had no way of measuring the passing of time because the drugs they gave him to keep him docile kept him without ability to judge the routines of staff, or even remember for certain how many times Sherlock had visited. He could only glimpse his bandages and judge by the fading amounts of fluids seeping from them that weeks rather than days had passed. They never allowed him to be conscious while they attended to his needs. He had remained perfectly cooperative and passive, yet they still restrained him, sedated him and treated his every movement as a possible hostile escape strategy.
“I hate you both.” Sherlock said, climbing to his knees at the side of the bed. He looked up at his partner and daughter between his lashes.
The consulting detective pulled back from his position on top of her and clutched at his side, blood wetting his hands as he applied pressure to the wound.
“Yes, I know.” Sherlock said softly. He shifted her so that she was pressed against his chest, one hand on her bum and the other cradling her skull. “You’re ok.”
“It’s not low tar, is it?” He asked, feigning annoyance. It was clear to the both of them he was grateful.
“Maeve.” Sherlock warned. She babbled again, this time quieter, and lifter her head up. Sherlock turned to Victor. “If you would, your case.”
Mycroft and Greg were sat together on the sofa when John arrived home. The elder Holmes on one side with his back incredibly straight and Greg beside him, close together. Maeve was sleeping in her Moses basket that was on the coffee table, snoring gently as they watched the television on mute.
John shifted in his seat. “I don’t want to argue with you, Sherlock. I just want you to understand that what you did was….well, it was a bit not good.”
‘What was it, Sherlock?’ He hadn’t meant to sound so angry – God knows if he ever had to think of something that could cause Sherlock to fall back, it would have been this – but seeing him like this was almost too much for him.
Tea was waiting for him in the kitchen of 221B - Sherlock still had remind himself every morning that John was back - and he could hear the agonisingly slow typing of his flatmate. He made his way to the living room, cup of tea in hand.
They’d spoken about this, Sherlock realised as he took in both men. James looked calm, in control. The commander. And James was curious and more than a bit aroused.
he thought. And it was. The onslaught of information Sherlock received from just watching them was staggering. This was John like he had never seen him before, not once in all those months. This was a younger John, more carefree, more lust driven. And Sherlock sensed the same change in James. It was stunning.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything. How could he? Because he knows, no matter how selfish he might have been in the past, ever since John limped into his life… there was no pain Sherlock would not endure for John Watson. There was nothing his body, his mind, his soul, his heart, would not endure for John Watson. How could he tell John that every single day without him killed him? How could he tell John that the mere sight of that golden band on his fingers tore his heart apart. There was no line John would be able to cross; Sherlock was already lost and broken for him. Sherlock already loved.
The will is read. John vomits at the huge estate. Mycroft offers to continue to manage the holdings, just like he always had for his brother. John shakes his head. " I don't want it. I don't want any of it."
John read the dosages and the cocktail of substances. It was impossible.  Sherlock couldn’t have possibly gotten ahold of all of this. John couldn’t have gotten ahold of it.  Beyond that, no human could survive this kind of mixture short of long term hospice patients.
"Oh. Yes. Several times in fact. Should be obvious I think. I did just scramble all your security cameras. I couldn't have cracked their frequency codes that quickly otherwise, now could I? Sorry. Pity that, about Fellows I mean. I was hoping to speak with him."
The food is delivered as Sherlock begins mumbling again. “ He's right, you know. So what if he's right?! He's always right, it's boring! Will you help me? Cherchez la femme. I always knew I could count on you, Lestrade. John has abandoned me, you know.  Again.”
Detective Sargent Lestrade and Molly Hooper had managed to pull his brother into sobriety and some measure of responsibility. At the time, Mycroft was appreciative of any small favor on Sherlock's behalf. He'd run off to America at one point and Mycroft had washed his hands of the whole affair. He'd assumed his brother was dead by the time his influence had grown enough to have the power to track him down to some Florida backwater. He was returned to England, alive but addicted and his mind addled to such a degree that Mycroft was unsure if he would ever find more than a disappointing end.
Danger night protocol, grade-three surveillance, and even his willingness to be treated unbearably by his brother, rather than make any overt insistence that he behave, were all merely preemptive measures. Sherlock had proven repeatedly what his probable future would entail. The 'ice man' as he had of late been made aware was his most recent moniker, only hoped to prevent the inescapable for as long as possible.
John crosses his arms and takes a very deep calming breath, “Yeah, well, I’m not him, am I?  And before you accuse me of groundless suspicion, don’t forget where I am.  You keep very detailed files in here.  Benefit of the doubt is harder to give when I see it exactly as you remember it.”
"I could teach you. I mean I am much more adept with the violin, but I am adequate at the piano," Sherlock volunteers.
We know she saved John, I decided to take that literally and I wanted to show that she reads people and improvises and that she did not manipulate John and that the sunny person we saw in the beginning really was there.
He looked up the stairs as he realised the squeaking hiss he was hearing was not unfamiliar.  The doctor had heard it in the A&E many times.
"Because we spent most of the day on a goose chase. This was found at the location you described." Mycroft, slides a piece of paper forward.
John stared at the food and was thankful that he had not been required to explain the sequence of the day’s events.   He ate mechanically and the food tasted like decadent sorrow. Nobody spoke of the empty places nor asked him to describe what he had seen. Mary kept meeting his eyes, her face filled with guilt and pity. Directly after dinner she handed him a tumbler half filled with whiskey and they watched the fire, casting yearning glances at the lonely violin tucked in the open case by the tree.
“I did. And she let me infer that she had spent a lot of time in Texas with distant relatives and that the border towns were brutal places filled with gun wielding birds that are absolutely mad about short British doctors. She does a bloody sexy Texas drawl. I didn’t want to look too closely because; I thought she was my last chance. I poured all I would never do for you, into her.”
John rubs Mary’s feet and ankles as she reclines in the overstuffed seats. They chat pleasantly only interrupted by an occasional moan from Sherlock.
"I was a bit of a disappointment too. Dad had told everyone I wanted to be a surgeon. He said working in the morgue was a creepy profession." She said taking a bite and chewing slowly.
“I can’t force myself to accept this. He should have just…I feel so horrible. I failed everyone, all because…” Mary didn’t finish the thought.
John Watson was dead to the world and he was currently sleeping in the same fashion.  Rat studied his face as John snored hilariously.  He wondered when the last time had been, that John had submitted to such a relaxed state and allowed his body to hover voluntarily near such peace.
Life was a day to day effort from within. He still missed him with more ache then he dared examine too deeply. In the moments that he was honest with himself, there was only a single answer. When you eliminate all the impossible, only one answer remains. That answer was livid today.
She listed John's markers that should obviously prove that Greg's instinct didn't justify how he is acting. She had talked all the way to Molly's apartment in her low patient tone, assuming his silence meant she should continue. " John is just a basic everyday case, Detective.
“ You have demanded for years. So, why not?  No reason to faff around about it. You want me?  It’s nothing.  Couldn’t respect a no.” John spread his arms in a belligerent come- and-get-me fashion.
These were the moments he knew. He played them in his mind, and yet, somehow standing here contemplating the finality of the concrete below, he realized what he'd missed all along. It wasn't possible. Sherlock would have never picked this. The possibility of survival was small, but Sherlock would never play a game he could lose so badly. Suicidal at times, yes. Hell putting himself in danger, on the edge was his greatest addiction, but putting himself into a situation of irrevocable damage and long term care, would never have done.
Sherlock put John to bed and kissed him softly on the lips. “I love you, John Watson.  Come back to me.  Have sweet dreams and tell me all about them in the morning. I believe in you.”  Sherlock said this to John every night.  Sometimes the corners of John’s lips would quirk up slightly. Sherlock lived for John’s almost smiles.
John ate his cake and grinned at Mycroft.  He looked up at the skull on the mantle and sighed with pleasure.  The skull smiled back at John and both knew exactly where they belonged.
She felt the delivery van move to his weight suddenly being absent and unexpectedly there is light all around. She looked around, confused and he was buttoning his trousers. He was smiling but it isn't the smile of a man who just had a shag. Sherlock looks at her as if he could kill her and anyone else who he felt like playing with. He had the same look of pure surety and truth as Jim carried in his eyes. The clarity of a serial killer, she'd heard Sherlock call it.
Sherlock, with help from Greg, moved Maeve into the original position so that she was sat comfortably in his arms, her head dry and hair still damp from the trickles that had fallen down.
“Oh Siger, do straighten your tie pin.” Violent scolded the rather dazed-looking man as she turned to greet some new arrivals.
Mycroft released a soft chuckle. Sherlock shot a brief look at him. “You hated your hair being washed.”
“Can you not go a minute without sticking your big nose in business that does not concern you?” Sherlock asked, raising both eyebrows and genuinely expecting an answer.
John looked up from the ground and his mouth parted. He stepped towards the consulting detective but the taller man closed the distance, rushing to the collection of cars and ambulance parked along the warehouse.
The only light in the room was that of the night light plugged in on the opposite side of the room, a small owl that glowed purple.
John picked it up and lent forward. Sherlock stuck one hand in the bowl, submerging his fingers in the ice for a few moment before pulling them out. He shook his hand slightly and then offered it to Maeve, pressing his forefinger against the seal of her lips. She hesitated but opened her mouth and he probed her gums, running the pad of his fingers over them. He announced after a few seconds. “There aren’t any teeth cutting through the gums.”
When John stepped into the living room after work he wasn't sure what to expect, Sherlock sat upside down on the sofa or doing an expedient with Maeve, he was used to all sorts living sigh the consulting detective but what he didn't expect was Molly Hooper to be sitting on sofa unloading a cardboard tray of Chinese food onto the coffee table, which was clean.
When he stopped in front of her, for inspection, she brushed the curl that fell over his forehead to the side with a smile and then took a step back to get a good look at as he put on his jacket. It was elegant much like his usual suits; raven black with a slight shimmer in the fabric that was understated and only visible in direct light. The trousers were narrowed-legged and the jacket; a simple two-button, slim cut that sat perfectly above his shirt. It was a pale pink, so pale that it merely looked slightly off white with dark purple buttons. The colour matched exactly the dress he’d got for Maeve that was currently hanging on the door of his wardrobe.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and glanced down at his daughter, a fond smile settling on his face at the sight of her chewing on her own fist. He shifted her into a more stable position, one arm supporting her, he used his free hand to carefully pry the now drenched fist from her mouth. She whined in protest.
Sherlock attempted to moved his head and look away but Mycroft tightening his grip and kept his head steady. He continued, “If you don’t focus you will lose her.”
“Yes,” Sherlock ran his hand down her back. She was wearing only a thin white bodysuit with no arms or legs.
The elder Holmes raised his eyebrows in a fashion that meant he wanted his younger brother to elaborate and then flicked his eyes to the infant on his shoulder, Sherlock noticed the look and followed it. Mycroft sighed, “you are now a father and in a committed relationship, if that isn’t involved...”
“It’s my pleasure,” Angelo said, bowing his head. He gestured to Sherlock. “This man got me off a murder charge. Cleared my name.”
“Never.” Sherlock articulated carefully, glancing at John before removing his jacket and placing it on the back of one of the chairs. He unbuttoned his sleeves and rolled them to his elbows.
“Then how could one person subdue her, given that she put up quite a fight” he gestured to the room around them in disarray. “Nail her to the wall still alive and then cut her throat in the space of twelve minutes?”
“Murder.” Silvia exclaimed at the same moment that Harold repeated, face drained of colour. “Kidnapping.”
“Yes but I need to investigate the victim’s sister and I cannot do that with Maeve.” He sighed, it was hard to admit to himself.
“Can I hold her?” Mycroft nodded and stood up. He watched his brother take off his gloves and put them in his pocket, then pause, and look up at Mycroft through his lashes. He cleared his throat. Mycroft handed him his niece. Sherlock repositioned her slightly and stared down at the baby in his arms, after a few moments he looked up at Mycroft, making eye contact. “She is rather fetching.”
Sherlock returned a moment later. He was fully dressed, now wearing a shirt and matching jacket to his trousers, shoes and socks. He had Maeve’s clothes hooked over his arm as he placed the purple carseat and baby bag on the floor by the door. Greg offered the baby to him and Sherlock took her with one long arm, hooking it under her small body. He placed her on the sofa and went about dressing her in a small Calvin Klein outfit, it was pale pink with grey hearts. A pair of trousers and hooded jumper over a white long armed baby grow.
Sherlock had somehow shed his coat and scarf, now hanging on the back of the door with his daughter still fast asleep in his arms, completely undisturbed. John perched himself on the arm of the sofa. “So” He started conversationally. “Maeve, huh?”
An air hostess appeared in the aisle, she leaned over and asked, “Is everything ok sir? Do you need anything?”
“Will she be waking soon?” Mycroft asked as he took a seat in John’s armchair, crossing one leg over the other and looking up at the consulting detective.
“Tell him his boyfriend and daughter are here.” He suggested as he flashed her a smile. “It may speed up the process.”
“Hmm” Sherlock hummed and offered his finger to Maeve. The infant took it without question and held it in her own smaller fist and gurgled happily.
The consulting detective picked up the two bags he had prepared as he exited the room, the purple ‘baby bag’ and a larger black leather bag. He closed the door behind him and walked down the hallway, pausing at the table to place the bags upon it before moving into the living room. He dedicated his free arm to holding Maeve also, using one arm to support her bottom so that she was sitting on his forearm and his other hand across her small back. Maeve’s chin was resting on his shoulder and she was looking behind him, growling loudly so that her body vibrated against his.
Violet pulled back long enough to give her son a pointed look, one eyebrow raised, and then returned to her cleaning duties. Greg held up a bottle of water. Mycroft extended his arm and took it.
Mycroft raised his eyebrow in a look that spoke volumes of ‘I very much doubt that’ and Sherlock rolled his eyes in response, he stepped through the obstacle created by his chair and handed Maeve to his brother. Mycroft took her with a practised ease that annoyed him and put her in the exact position she had been on Sherlock’s shoulder, she sniffed and grasped at the shoulder of his suit before settling down.
“The case?” The consulting detective pushed himself up with one hand to leave against the headboard, supressing a wince as his stitches pulled uncomfortably and he kept his gaze on Maeve.
“I suppose we should do this properly.” He announced. He reached into the cot, with more caution than he’d ever used before, and picked up his daughter for the first time. One hand beneath her head, cradling it gently and the other beneath her small body. He lifted her up and placed her close to his chest, cradling her in his arms. He watched intently, pursing his lips as his eyes scanned over her body, checking that she was unharmed and secure in his arms.
Greg turned to see John approaching with a freshly bathed Maeve, wearing a cute miniature version of one of Sherlock’s dressing gowns and hair damp against her pale skin. He found himself smiling at the baby, a smile which John knew all too well, he too was smiling fondly at the infant.
Violet frowned but nodded and the others left them, Sherlock, John and Maeve, on the side of the road.
Sherlock reached out, hesitantly. Large hands reaching round to cradle the baby’s head – he may not know much about children but he was well aware of how a baby could not support its own head, it was fragile – and the other hand reached beneath her to grab her body. She was small, almost fitting entirely in his hands with the padding of the blankets. She made a sound at being moved, barely audible. He pulled her to his chest. A envelope lay on the floor – wet from the cold ground, hidden under the baby’s body – Sherlock shifted the baby to rest on one arm, head on his elbow and body supported by the rest of his long arm. He picked up the envelope with her free arm.
Anthea was on the seat beside him glued to her phone as usual, brown eyes occasionally flicking up to look at her boss or someone enter the room. Gregory was sat opposite with Sally and Anderson, as a concerned family member and member of New Scotland Yard. He managed a comforting smile at his partner. John was stood at the door unable to sit or stop himself from fussing over Maeve in an attempt to keep himself busy.
John explained, “I know you don’t really celebrate Christmas and neither do I, not really, but you want this to be perfect for her. I’m not sure I can manage perfect but I think together, we can do well enough. So, what do you want to do? How are we going to kick off this day?”
“You went swimming?” John asked in disbelief, “You woke up, saw these newspapers and decided to take Maeve swimming.”
John’s head snapped up and he looked at the consulting detective with a mixture of amusement and surprise. “What?”
Sherlock handed Maeve to John the moment he stepped out of the pool. The blonde wrapped the infant in a towel and pulled her closed, bundled in the pale yellow material. She looked up at him and smiled, as if to say ‘look what we just did’. John smiled and kissed the top of her wet head. “Yes, I saw you, did you have a good time with your daddy?”
John put the bottle down and picked Maeve up, offering her to the consulting detective. Sherlock took her and pulled her against his chest, her head resting on his shoulder. He started rubbing her back in practiced circular motions. He titled his head and kissed behind her ear. “She’s hot.”
“If we can locate him, we will get her back without paying the ransom but,” he hesitated, “it’s riskier.”
Mycroft remained stoic and continued to smile at his niece, she gurgled but didn’t return his smile, instead focusing on shoving her hand into her mouth. He commented, “She is rather like you.”
Sherlock gave John a stern look, considering it for a moment before his expression softened and he shrugged his shoulders. He reached down to scoop up Maeve and placed her gently against his torso, careful that her open mouth was facing away from his suit and instead facing out, cheek against his shoulder.
Sherlock’s sad eyes scanned his brother’s face; it was unyielding, mouth set in a firm lie and eyes fixed on him with an intensity that spoke volumes. This was his brother. He fixed things.
Sherlock nodded and retrieved the presents that he’d been storing in the spare room. There was a sizable amount but he couldn’t bring himself to feel bad, it was his daughters first Christmas after all. They took some time arranging things and John retrieved some bags before they both took a step back and admired their work.
“It’s hardly my thought she prefers me.” The consulting detective told him. He took the seat in between his brother and John, immediately crossing one leg over the other and taking the coffee that Andrews place in front of him. He took a sip and grimaced, the strong Italian beans and toothpaste mixing to create a bitter acidic taste. That didn’t stop him drinking half before placing the cup on the side, pushing it to the side and then turning to look at John.
“Right,” he said once he was satisfied. He managed a smile. She blinked up at him, clearly fighting the urge to fall back to sleep as her face wrinkled in confusion, a new face, a new world, brighter than the one she had previously inhabited. “I’m your father, I suppose you’ll call me that, or dad but never daddy, I insist.”
The older man shifted the infant so that her legs were either side of his body and her hands were clutching at his shirt on his chest and back, her eyes wandering over her uncle as though he were the most interesting thing she'd seen all day and he was. “Leaving us to it, then.” He said with a smile.
“And we would have complicated the situation.” His mother sounded sad. Mycroft opened his mouth to protest but she cut him off, “I know, it was never meant to hurt us. It’s true, we would have complicated the matter for you. Sentiment and all that.”
Maeve was cooing gently. Small sounds of content. She’d obviously been awake for a little while, as had Sherlock both were alert and communicating with one another. Not scrunching their faces of moaning like they did directly after waking up. “Are you hungry?” Sherlock asked her. “Daddy needs a shower, would you like a shower too?”
“I look forward to seeing it,” Mycroft said in a tone that might suggest, to one that did not know him quite so well, that he was incredibly bored but to the consulting detective and army doctor, was a tone of genuine curiosity and excitement.
Thank you for all your patience. My wifi is back but i am swamped with work, don't worry I'll find the time to update regularly, if I don't just remind me.
"So..." John said, he finished typing and looked up at Sherlock who was stood looming over him with his hand inside the pram, "lunch?"
“On call” Sherlock answered with a pout “a patient of his took a turn for the worst this morning, I am capable but he thought that I needed babysitting.”
“You?” John repeated. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed in confusion and the blonde continued. “Is Sherlock Holmes afraid of looking stupid with his daughter dressed in pink?”
“He hasn’t left the house since…well, since Mycroft dropped us off.” John answered and raised an eyebrow. “But you already knew that.”
“What things?” Sherlock asked. He twisted in one fluid movement, turning to face his brother. Maeve didn’t bat an eyelid this time, quickly adapting to her father’s habits.
“Yes, she’s still small though.” Mycroft chose his words carefully. She was much like Sherlock, a small baby.
“So it would seem.” He responded as he crouched down beside the blanket and ran a hand over Maeve’s delicate head. She looked up, blue eyes flicking to him and started kicking her legs in excitement.
Sherlock took a deep breath and placed his lips on Maeve’s head. The soft dark strands tickled his nose and mouth but he ignored the sensation in favour of keeping his lips there, in a lingering kiss. He pulled back enough to place his nose on her head and his lips, lingering at her temple. “I love you.”
Mycroft nodded and answered for his brother, while the young Holmes entertained himself with the soft strands of hair atop of his daughter’s head. “Sherlock’s partner is a doctor, then there is myself and Gregory, he is a Detective Inspector at New Scotland Yard, our parents see Maeve weekly and are always happy to lend a helping hand.”
Anthea took another step closer to the pram and hesitantly reached in. She pulled out the small infant and pulled her close. Maeve’s head lolled and Anthea made sure that she didn’t drop it but instead placed a tired head on her shoulder until she was awake enough to support it herself.
Sherlock gently pried her hand from his shoulder and looked up at his mother, stood in front of him, “I assumed that you would prefer her awake for the church ceremony, John has put her down in the nursery until I dress her and we leave.”
Sherlock came out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. He dressed in silence while Mycroft dried Maeve off and put copious amounts of cream on her red flesh, put her in a new nappy and a sleepsuit. He wordlessly handed her over to his younger brother the moment he was done and retrieved the soft bristled brush from the counter. Sherlock took it and brushed his daughter’s hair, pushing the strands forward.
Sherlock snorted and handed over Maeve to the older man, he took her and positioned her to sit in his arms with her back pressed against his chest, gazing out at the world with wide eyes. He placed the bag and carseat on the floor beside Greg and lent down, placing a kiss on Maeve’s head before turning and heading towards the scene. Sally led him in and John followed them both dutifully.
The waitress returned with a smile, two small plates in her hands. She placed them on the table, Violet first, then Mycroft and looked up at him. “She’s too young for a high-chair right?”
“Are you up to this Sherlock?” Greg asked. It was vital that he knew the truth. Sherlock gave a slow sure nod of his head. Greg’s eyes widened slightly and then he frowned, “Are you sure?”
“I have a stand in in your office, he’s taking care things.” She told him. “Are you going to take her for a walk?”
Maeve gurgled slightly in response, blue eyes wide and focused on his face. Sherlock scooped her up and into his favourite position, resting on his chest with her head against his neck. She reached up automatically, her small hands resting against the exposed skin of his chest and mouth open against his neck. He sighed once before opening the door.
Louise Weatherly looked taken back by the statement and the blonde watched him with a critical gaze. Michelle corrected, “There are some matters of concern that have been brought to our attention.”
“No, the usual way John.” He said with a small smile. “They’ll be children running around and an obscene amount of food, I’m sure you’ll enjoy yourself.”
They were all sat on the patio, spread out around the pool on normal and longue seats. His mother had brought out a jug of ice tea and the correct amount of cups, John and Greg had a beer each.
The consulting detective moved and acted with practised ease in every aspect of life, including with baby Maeve in toll, he was still capable of running around and weaving through the cIty. The inclusion of Maeve changed very little in terms for Sherlock, he'd adapted his routine to care more about another person though having a child was the easiest thing in the world. Sherlock and Maeve were inseparable.
“He’s just thinking, don’t worry about him.” John said after a second, eyes flicking to Victor momentarily.
“And for the record,” John said, his lips still on Maeve’s head and words muffled slightly, “she knows that you love her and so do I.”
In a promising term of events, Maeve had been sick on the orange pumpkin baby grow that John had selected for the day leaving nothing but normal clothes for her to wear or else it would spoil the surprise of tomorrows outfit. Sherlock ran his hand down her clothed back. “I didn’t like that outfit either,” he whispered to her.
"Fabricated." John's blue eye flicked up to Sherlock, "your bother does 'occupy a minor position in the british government' he would have helped you."
“Right, well, I’m going to unpack. I’ll come with you to get the shopping and you can tell me all about your case over dinner. Tea?”
John poked his head into the room and smiled at the sight – Mycroft dressed in a smart three piece smoky grey suit, white shirt and charcoal tie, Sherlock dressed in his usual Spencer Hart suit; a grey suit that was so dark it was practically black, white shirt an no tie, the first two buttons undone. And the pièce de résistance was baby Maeve, dressed in a simple white lace dress that stopped just above her knees, with matching shoes and pants over her nappy.
“As much as I love talking about this,” Mycroft’s voice dripped with sarcasm, “there are more productive things I can be doing with my time and you with yours.”
“I’ve taken the liberty of having the room opposite yours transformed into a nursery” Anthea informed him, tone a hushed as not to disturbed Maeve. “The staff are preparing for your arrival.”
And ... what was the last thing???? Oh yes, I am planning a new fic that hopefully I'll be able to start soon. It's going to be about Mycroft and I'm super excited about it!!!!
Mycroft raised an eyebrow in surprise but said nothing in response. Sherlock had used the words ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ in the past minutes more times than he’d said them in a year.
“Your name is William.” Mycroft reminded him, raising his eyebrow. Sherlock shot him an ‘I know that’ look. “But I accept you point.”
“Just find whoever did this.” Howards told them, closing the door and leaving the trio in the hallway.
John snorted as Jade ran her nose and cheek over the infants foot and followed her leg up. She stopped and edged closer to the infants face. Maeve’s eyes widened in curiosity, having never seen an animal like this before, but she didn’t reach out. Jade climbed slightly higher and touched the baby’s nose with her own. Maeve’s nose wrinkled and she smiled in response. Satisfied, the cat rubbed her face against her cheek and meowed again, this time louder.
The government official tensed and reminded them. “Sherlock is a good person and I have no doubt that he is a good father, he will only get better as time progresses.”
Harold and Silvia were stood a few steps away on the pavement, they were staring up at the houses in amazement and disbelief. Silvia cleared her throat and asked, “Your parents live here?”
“I just didn’t expect you to be so eager to leave.” The auburn haired man admitted. It was rather curious considering his brother had barely let her out of his sight since discovering her.
“No,” he said a little too quickly, he clarified in a softer tone, “she needs to be with me, I will talk to my mother.”
John handed his empty whisky glass to Sherlock and took the wriggling baby. She was over-excited and it didn’t take a genius to figure out that she’d soon be overtired and a nightmare to put to bed. He walked away from the genii and back towards the small group at the bar. The men cheered at his return and immediately there were questions about the small, beautiful baby in his arms.
“If you can contain yourself -” Mycroft began in a hushed whisper. “- for the entire ceremony, I will allow you a free pass, so to speak.”
“We are working.” He resigned himself to failure, leaning further into his chair and crossing one leg over the other.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered somehow managing to keep his cool, his tone level. “If he used his hands, then there will be contusions across his hands and possible broken bones, this could help us to identify the man that kidnapped and for all intents and purposes, tortured your son.”
When he’d wrestled her into the white romper dress with a small pattern of gold clouds and stars, he settled her firmly on his lap and picked up the newspaper. “Current affairs?” he asked her, she looked up at him with a gummy smile, “gossip? What do you fancy?”
The blonde twisted his neck to get a better view at the awake but sleepy infant. “Did you grandad buy you a cat?”
Molly dropped the stack of file she was holding the moment she saw him. Sherlock sauntered in with his head held high; black curls bouncing with each step and skin glistening in the bright hospital lights. He was dressed as usual, wearing a designer suit with a deep red shirt, the first three buttons undone to reveal the pale column of his throat. His coat billowed behind him dramatically, undone and his scarf hung out of his pocket. That wasn’t the reason though.
“What?” The blonde turned to him. “You may not think you’re a hero and many people would agree with you but you do save the day quite a lot.”
“Oh dear. On the bright side, you got a pretty good run out of it? One of the nurses propositioned me, by the way, four times. Sponge baths were unbearable. Thanks for that,” He teased wiping her tears away with a clean spot on his dressing gown sleeve.
"I am going to beat my lover at his silly game, crush his tender little ego whilst proving he matters to me, save his life and probably never let him out of my sight again. In the meantime, you are going to keep your little beady eyes on all the fabulous toys you have amassed and call me at once when you spot him."
He introduced him to the strangest, most intriguing person he'd ever run across somewhere within the familiar bowels of St. Barts. This tall, blazing person had no boundaries, no rules and his superiority was forceful and had no safety. John was invited to look at a flat on the morrow. John almost thought it would be worth missing his own appointment to keep that one. He had no need to plan a future, but to just be near that something again, to have a chance to analyze it and figure out why he had none of that sort of majesty. He might stay for a bit.
John shakes his head and wets his lower lip and then gasps, "That? That is not respect. There is no way even you—"
John had even wondered on two occasions if Sherlock was about to kiss him. He wondered if he would stop him if he did. He noticed how many times they were working and Sherlock seemed determined to hover near John rather than snatch the item and maintain his distance. John knew he felt things he wasn't quite capable of admitting.
“Ahh, but there you are wrong.  He had promised this power, tread on its eventuality. Wanted his accolades marked in history with awe and doom.  He wanted to be a Hannibal, an Akhenaten, or even a Napolean and not a Corrigan or a Blondlot.”
He was proud of Mycroft for the most part, though his ability to maneuver had often hindered Rat’s own commitments.  He had become rather disappointed that Mycroft had failed to make the necessary leaps of reasoning it would require for Rat to have his cover revealed.  Mycroft was now in a position in which he had more than the necessary authority and clearances to welcome his dead father back into the world of the living.  Too bad he had simply failed to give the matter his attention.
"And what is you intention in the long term? You plan to imprison us here and keep us separated for our own good? How do you think that will work out, Mycroft? You know me better than that."
John opened his eyes, to find Sherlock actually sobbing.  He was beyond meltdown and into the range of uncontrollable ugly snotfest.
Sherlock looks up at him and shakes his head. "Married to my work. Marry the girl you threatened to kill, if she will still have you. I'll be leaving London alone."
“And the last thing you have to consider is that you have no idea how long that was planned, but you had no warning. He planned that you would be the last connection, the last thing he reached out to before darkness. John, of course he knew. He didn’t say the words, because he showed you instead. How have you spend all this time torturing yourself and not figured out the part that is so beautiful. I know the time was not long enough, but something that deep and true, Oh love, a hundred years would not be enough. I have never found that. Most people don’t. Five hundred and thirty days is five hundred and thirty more than I ever got. If he wanted you to follow, he would have been able to coax you to go. He would, wouldn’t he?” She smiled as if she already knew the answer.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, letting his fingers follow the line of John’s spine. ‘I love you, John Watson, and you love me. Please. Believe me when I tell you I know that. I know what I am saying and I know what I am allowing. Invite him over, talk to him…’
It had been good. No, Sherlock rectified himself immediately when the thought sprung to mind. Not good. Amazing. Wonderful. Never would he have imagined that his life would – and could – turn out like it had. He was happy, nauseatingly so. But Sherlock didn’t care. He couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so at ease with himself and those around him and he wouldn’t change it. Not for anything.
‘If I die here, my body will be found in a building with your face projected on the front of it. Even Scotland Yard can get somewhere with that.’
John was practically shivering underneath their ministration, silently begging them both for more. He wouldn’t beg out loud. Yet. But he came damned close when James’ mouth engulfed his cock.
When the light had been of, he could have pretended not to see what was right in front of him. He could have pretended not to know that the glass rolling over the floor was an empty syringe. He might have convinced himself Sherlock was sluggish because he was devastated and exhausted. He wouldn’t have to see the paleness of the detective’s face, the angry looking mark on his outstretched arm, the hanging eyes and constricted pupils.
– and he could  hear Mary’s trembling voice in the background but Sherlock was still talking to him. ‘…please, John, they’ll be here. Hold on, please, I’m begging you, don’t die…’
I have never been in a polyamorous relationship or situation. This is in no way, shape or form meant to insult, belittle or ridicule those of you who are.
Sherlock had seen it at the wedding. The love that had grown and withered unspoken between Sholto and John. It had been torn apart by circumstances and prejudices before they had time to figure things out. The regrets that followed after John had been shot and Sholto had been destroyed not long after. Sherlock had been jealous then. He had hated Sholto for throwing it away, for not fighting harder. But he understood now. Sometimes fighting for something isn’t enough and you end up destroying yourself in the process. Sometimes love wasn’t enough.
Sherlock tried to stay clear from John’s prostate as much as possible – he didn’t want this to be over soon – and it didn’t take long before John started pressing back against his fingers. ‘Sher… God, James, fuck me.’
‘Don’t fucking remind me,’ John muttered and he wasn’t surprised feel that his mood had darkened. They had wasted years. Years! But James pulled him closer, nuzzling his neck.
John was next to him before Sherlock fell to the floor, buckling under the weight of his grief, and held him. They curled down onto the floor together, holding each other like a life line. John felt the warmth of Sherlock tears seep through his shirt when the younger man pressed his face against his shoulder as he continued babbling. ‘I’m sorry…so sorry, Myc. Please…’
The shape on his bed didn’t respond. He didn’t even seen to have noticed someone else was in the room and John could barely suppress his worry. All he wanted to do was reach out, talk to him, console him, just making sure he was physically alright, but he knew it would only drive him further away to the point where they would lose him completely.
He was longer than John, Sherlock noted, though the girth was roughly the same. His hand lingered, teasing the sensitive head through the material of the condom and James hissed in response. ‘Sherlock…’
‘Go to sleep John.’ Sherlock pressed a kiss against John’s shoulder and John hummed something unrecognisable in response. But he did.
‘No, shut up. I’ve seen it and I don’t mind John. I know you love me and I love you. So does he. And you still care for him too.’
John could practically hear the pout in his voice and a shaky chuckle escaped him. James pulled back from John’s lips and he looked over to Sherlock’s face in amusement. ‘You slept in.’
John couldn’t even care about Mary’s gasps and mutterings. She was crying, he could hear it, but Sherlock’s voice sounded absolutely wrecked. He was lying on the floor –
James said nothing though Sherlock could see the amusement in his eyes. He tried to picture them both, younger than they were now, just as impatient. Hiding themselves away from judging eyes, high on adrenaline and lust. Sherlock could see it clear as day in his mind’s eye, just as he could in the shapes and movements of the two men in front of him.
But his vision was darkening and he could hear Sherlock calling out to him, commanding him to wake up.
Sherlock leaned back and watched James’ cock disappear inside John. John rocked his hips a little, taking in more of James with each movement and it wasn’t long before James started moving his hips to meet them.
‘I meant that…’ Sherlock pondered about his words for a moment. He couldn’t barge in. John would clamp up, become defensive. Delicately; that was the way for this. ‘I’m curious.’
It wasn’t fair. He could see the understanding dawn in John’s eyes and he was crying and Sherlock wanted to scream. This wasn’t fair! ‘You’re not saying goodbye.’
John swallowed and rose his face so he could meet Sherlock’s curious gaze. ‘But it was dangerous. Not just getting caught but the risks of being out there. He nearly got blown up once and I…’
‘I don’t care!’ he heard himself shouting. ‘If you love him even half as much as I do, then you’ll call him. NOW!’
Because John was with him. Back home, in Baker Street. Divorced, yes. A little older, a little more grey, but he was home. And even though John had been back for over a year, Sherlock couldn’t help but still feel elated at the sound of John typing on his laptop. It was strange how a thing so seemingly meaningless, could bear so much weight inside his heart.
Sherlock hears the frown and he sighs. He can’t back down now not without causing even more questions. John will know he has more to hide, he’ll get angry, he’ll leave and –
Sherlock’s broken plea was too much for John to bear and he pulled him closer to his chest. ‘I know Sherlock. I’ll help, I promise. Go to sleep, please. I’ll be here.’ John pressed a kiss against the dark curls and within minutes he felt Sherlock giving in to his body’s need to rest. ‘I’ll be here Sherlock,’ John murmured and now he could feel the tears that had threatened to break free all night slide down his cheeks. ‘Promise.’
He’s licking his lips. Sherlock can hear it. John is fidgeting in his seat, uncertain, thinking his words over. Oh for God’s sake, there is no need for his eyes when it comes to John’s worrying.
Good thing he and mrs Hudson had checked every single hiding place a week before. Sherlock had been tremendously bored due to a lack of interesting cases – at least, they had been incredibly dull to him. When Greg had appeared in front of their front door this morning and Sherlock accepted his case, everyone had breathed out a sigh of relief.
Sherlock steeled himself. This was it. ‘That I can share. If you… if you want. I want you happy, John and I know you’re happy with me but I can’t help but feel like there is something, some part of you that can only be happy with him. And I want to see that part. I want to know all of you.’
After Mycroft left for uni, the birthdays had never felt quite the same anymore and Sherlock’s enthusiasm lessened each passing years until it was his time to go to uni. By that time he had stopped celebrating completely.
‘Sort of,’ John admitted, still not looking at Sherlock. ‘It was… Christ, it was war. Sometimes you just got lonely, or the adrenaline got too much and it… with James it was easy. I guess. We liked each other from the start. He had a great sense of humour and was good for his men. It was… good, for a while.’
‘’No, John. I – ‘’ Sherlock swallows down the panic rising in his throat. He has no choice. ‘’There is something you should know before… My back is… when I was away, I was…’’
Automatically, John reached for his phone, thumb hovering over the first name of his speed dial list in case of danger nights when John lost Sherlock out of his sight. He froze when the name registered in his mind. Damn it, damn this day, damn it all!
Oh, how Sherlock loved doing this. The flush of John’s skin, his moans and grunts. His reddened lips, still swollen and moist from when he sucked Sherlock to completion mere moments before Sherlock had pushed him to his back, slicked up his fingers, and pressed them inside.
James pulled back a little, regarding Sherlock with heavy lidded eyes and Sherlock stretched his neck for more without properly realising it.
John’s ears were still ringing from the cold tone of Mary’s voice when she raised the gun. He didn’t hear the gun firing. He did hear Sherlock’s voice –
John turned his head sharply at that, nearly bumping noses with James. He had never heard those words from James’ mouth and he had never said them to James either. He had felt them. Oh how he had felt them when James’ lips touched his for the first time. Or when James pressed him chest first against the wall. And the words had ached in his bones when an IED had very nearly taken James away from him. John had hid himself away from them, and from James, terrified of what might happen.
‘I meant, John, that we are stuck. Stuck as in, I am unable to open the door. Ergo, we are stuck inside the closet.’
John shakes his head, still sniggering and he mutters something under his breath that Sherlock can’t hear.
They bickered, they went on cases, they laughed until the tears rolled down their cheeks, they had take-away and saved each other. Over and over again in so many ways.
Sherlock could hear Mary’s gasps behind him and Sherlock would have killed her if he could. But John is dying, he is dying because of her and damn it all to Hell if he would let her get away with this.
Sherlock’s muscles feel heavy and he can feel John’s breathing slow down to match his own. John’s fingers have found his curls and he, very carefully, threads his fingers through them. Sherlock sighs deeply, nestling closer to his lover –
James licked his lips at the sight of John’s erection. As he moved forward with his lips parted, Sherlock hands slid up, making sure he hit every single of John’s most sensitive body parts along the way. His sides. His nipples. His collarbone.
Sherlock closed his eyes and for a moment he thought he could taste James on John’s skin. He gripped John’s hips, rubbing himself against John’s arse. A whimper escaped John’s lips and Sherlock groaned against his skin in response. They were both hard – Sherlock could see the bulge straining against John’s trousers when he opened his eyes and looked down.
and John didn’t even knew what words he was saying out loud, if he made any kind of sense at all, but Sherlock was crying now and John tried to tighten his hold.
This wasn’t happening. This couldn’t be happening! This was a dream, a horrible nightmare. John felt sick. He wanted to scream, to grab Mary –
‘I want you there... if you – Jesus, I can’t believe we’re even discussing this – but I want you there with me. Us. If we – ’
but he couldn’t hear what he was saying to Mary on the phone. But whatever it was, Mary straightened her back –
The loss of the strength in John’s hand is sudden, too sudden and John is looking straight through him now, his lips still. ‘No…John. John, wake up! Don’t you dare!’
Greg’s voice caught in his throat before cursing again and he could hear him shouting orders to someone near him. ‘I don’t care, just do it! Find him, pull everything. Ask his bloody network. John?’
When John opened the door to the 221B living room, he was greeted with silence. The curtains were drawn, the lights were off and Sherlock’s bedroom door wide open. Sherlock had been home then but the flat was empty. He couldn’t have been home long – it had taken John only ten minutes to find another cab to Baker street – but the detective seemed to have made the most of the short time he had. Wherever John looked, books were overturned, some drawers were still hanging open and their chairs had been pushed from their usual position. Even the skull no longer sat on the mantel piece and had taken a residence in John’s chair.
John and James were kissing again, mouths more hungry, hands bolder in their exploration. Sherlock watched them, hands frozen on his buttons.
He can hear John’s soft chuckle as he sinks down on to the bed next to him and Sherlock flinches when the flannel makes contact with his sticky stomach. Sherlock tries to move away – for someone who keeps pestering him to sleep more, John seems determined to keep him awake even longer – but John cleans him despite his wiggling.
I have never been in a polyamorous relationship or situation. This is in no way, shape or form meant to insult, belittle or ridicule those of you who are.
John grabbed him, slamming their mouths together. Sherlock let go of James, scrambling to get a hold of John’s shoulders to keep them both upright, but John was moving, sinking down, and John’s sharp hiss interrupted their kiss along with James’ deep groan of pleasure.
The room was dark, undisturbed on first glance, but John could see a shape on his bed. Back against the headboard, legs curled up, head resting on his knees, one arm outstretched besides him. A lump threatened to close up his throat and John could hear his heart pound in his ears, but thank God, he thought to himself. Sherlock was home!
‘Sherlock?’ James’ deep gravelly voice interrupted Sherlock’s train of though and his gaze snapped to him. Oh. Him. They were waiting for him… But…
Sherlock had encouraged John to keep Sholto close. John obviously trusted him with what he was feeling – and Sherlock had ignored the stab of jealousy he had felt when Sholto called him. John had gone to him, someone from years ago as opposed to him. Hadn’t John see that Sherlock would never ever turn his back on him? That he couldn’t say ‘no’ to him? He had killed for him, been willing to sacrifice it all for his happiness. But Sherlock had said nothing. Not at that time anyway.
Without releasing John’s hand, Sherlock moved closer, pressing himself against John’s back. James’ gaze moved from John to him now and Sherlock moved his head in a silent invitation before he lowered his head. He knew where James had kissed John before; he could see the trail of saliva behind his left ear. And when Sherlock’s lips touched that same of part him, John trembled in response.
‘Don’t,’ he whispered. ‘Sherlock and I… we talked before and after things went wrong with your wife. He doesn’t blame you. Never has. The man loves you, John.’ John nodded silently as James pressed a kiss behind his ear. ‘We both do.’
He remembers John’s surprise when Sherlock first curled up against him after their first time. Sherlock himself had even been more surprised to find he had managed to sleep through the night. Apparently John’s calming influence extended even to the bedroom.
Instead, he moved his hands until they found the buttons of John’s shirt. And he undid them. One by one.
‘Intriguing.’ John didn’t buy it. Of course he didn’t; he knew Sherlock better than that. To suggest a dinner date… Sherlock had to admit he might have handled this differently. ‘What on Earth do you mean by that?’
‘He needs to wash,’ John mumbled against James’ neck. He hadn’t even bothered to open his eyes. ‘He can’t relax otherwise.’
‘Not funny,’ he muttered weakly and John smiled. Sherlock felt the need to rush over, to kiss that audacious smile off his face, to replace the horrible memories of having John’s lips not responding against his own with something better. But he was still stuck in his wheelchair – his nurse had been completely unforgiving and unrelenting no matter how hard Sherlock tried to blackmail her – so he settled on placing his hand over John’s.
Greg sighed on the other end, sounding every bit as exhausted and desperate as John felt. ‘I’ll do that. Text me when you find him.’
John sighed deeply, hiding his face away against Sherlock’s chest and for a moment Sherlock feared that he had gone too far. That John would deny everything. That he had ruined the newly found contact between the two men. But John, as ever, surprised him.
James eyes flickered up to John’s scar for a moment and Sherlock could see something dark cross his face. Not now, Sherlock thought to himself, making sure John wouldn’t notice by sucking the skin behind his ear. This wasn’t the time.
And John… John was nervous. He rambled, desperate to fill up the silences that fell, keeping their glasses filled. Sherlock made a vague mental note to enhance John’s acting skills. But if James noticed, he didn’t comment on it.
It made Sherlock sick that the only time he could feel John’s lips with his own was when he had been forcing his air into John’s struggling lungs.
The scream ripped from his throat as he rushed past the frozen figure of Mary, ignoring the pain in his own body.
But there was something else too. Something more reverent and patient. And when John shrugged off James’ shirt and helped him get it over his bad arm, Sherlock realised. They hadn’t seen each other like this before. Their last time had been from before John had been shot. This was as new to them as it was for him.
His chin lifts and he speaks in his superior purr of taunting snobbery, " You don't need to instruct me on justice, Molly. Justice is a roll of the dice at best. There is no justice. You and I, are guilty. Now roll your dice and I am off to roll mine. Farewell, Dr. Hooper." From his pocket he draws two small green dice and shakes them in his fist. "Seven come eleven." He rolled them and smirks. "Snake eyes. Now, I think we can say, we are done shooting the crap." He said with feigned disappointment.
Once the British Government had left the flat, Mary turned to John and asked, “He is a lot nicer than he pretends to be, you know. I think he’s definitely one of the good guys, don’t you?”
“No it doesn’t. Trust me on that one. Alone makes you an easy target. And, you just proved it will never protect you from yourself.” She had replied gently, tilting her head and making him look at her. “Everyone has someone. For goodness sake, everyone here adores you. Take your pick and talk to someone.”
Mycroft was indeed on the phone. His eyes were closed, his finger was trying to block out the sound of the alarm. He looked far less put together than normal and when Sherlock cleared his throat, the relief was evident. It was followed by a split second of fear as he realized Dr. Watson was also present, but he slammed the phone down and stood quickly. With two deep breaths he restored his equilibrium to his face and purred aloofly, "Gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed your little excursion. To what askew kindness, do I owe this unexpected social call? Isn't it nice that you interrupted your escape, to grace me with your cheery faces?"
When Sherlock calmed down, he chuckled and asked, "Exactly how much trouble are you in?  With my brother?"
Mrs. Hudson took one look and went into action. "Poor thing. What have you got there? Oh, a cufflink, where on earth did you? I think you better sit down, dear, you look like you've seen a ghost." Mrs. Hudson relieves her of her treasures and guides her to the sofa. "You didn't, did you? See one? I heard you up stairs. I'll never rent the place if it has a haunting." Mrs. Hudson shakes her head in pity as her face screws up and she excuses herself, mumbling about the tea needing to be made.
"I say, Eloise, no need to worry dear, its Sherlock, not that bloody Mycroft. Oh sorry, Ducks, but your older boy is six-pence short of a shilling. Say, did you scare the taxi, like I showed you as a lad?"
She rolled her eyes and looked even more depressed, as she said with a sigh, “Yeah, saved his life with that. Got you shot instead and so he wants to forgive me. The bastard.”
John’s attention was again riveted to the stage and Rat’s demeanor compared to Sherlock’s gave the impression that Rat was a radical teen rebel whose hair happened to be dyed grey whilst Sherlock was old, stodgy and full of himself.
He just needed a moment to rest his eyes and he leaned carefully against the wall, unaware he was gasping.  Sherlock did not get up again.
Sherlock’s face was red and horrified. “Janine. Don’t. Please.” He said, voice hitching as he gripped her hand and squeezed it hard. His eyes pleaded with her to back down.
Of course he'd backed off the security detail, there were texts flying that night with indecision. John had met someone directly after Sherlock had left him. By the time Mycroft had set aside time to personally review the security tapes, his people's faces already were filled with disaster. First what took place in 221B would never be known because every camera in a five block radius suddenly stopped functioning.
Yes, he’d taken John to an undercover-op who played mild mannered animal doctor, but Rat knew the man was neither French nor a simple doctor of exotic creatures.  He’d desperately placed John in the hands of the finest surgeon he’d ever met.  John was good at trauma and field surgery in general, but this man’s code name was Resurrection La Gaule.  (which equaled ‘resurrection erection’ in a tongue in cheek off-color spook humor.) His skill was no joke, and his neurosurgical trail of career miracles included a half dead Rat raised from certain permanent impairment, brain function intact.
He rolled left, retrieving his main weapon from under his shirt tail and used the torso of a dead bald man as cover.
"My elder son and his little toys. Jamming them. That should take care of it." He smiled and stepped inside.
“Are you saying three old dogs have impressed the pup?” Herbert Rainer asked puffing out his chest slightly.
"I'm going with you, Sherlock, and there isn't a damned thing you can do about it. I assure you. If you know anything …at all…about me. You know-" John banged the floor with his fist and sat up, glaring at Sherlock.
Sally wheezed, “And…that was where you decided to put them?  These don’t belong in any kitchen…how do you live here?  I mean where do you keep the tea…shoebox under the bed?  Nothing is where it belongs… “ She was wound up now and seemed to have a list of things that needed announced to everyone’s amusement.
“We will stand on that bridge when the rain comes, John. It would be a good war, but it would break me to beat you.” She grinned genuinely.
"He put Angry Birds on it for me too," Rat went on as if John hadn't spoken. " I like that game. I keep in touch with the boy on World of Warcraft. And you just discovered it, I have known of your interesting association for some time. Were you lovers, you and my son?" Rat asked the last part in the same bored tone he'd discussed Angry Birds.
" I couldn't give you anything, so I donated all the last good -bits to Molly. Forgive me, John. I know she belonged to you, but you did abandon her which allowed my prior claim to reinstate. That isn't the whole picture though." Sherlock takes several deep breaths as if he's having a small panic attack.
"He would have proved himself right before." Lestrade looks back toward the direction they came from and whistles. "This must be some kind of big missing link, John. I assume you are going to be following. You will have to be reasonably careful you know. If it is something too big for him, he wouldn't want you to…"
Mummy beamed with sly mirth. "That's my boy. I knew you'd be just fine. I told your brother that if your own death didn't stop you, why would poor John's?"
Greg swallowed hard and with a deep breath, said, "I wanted to be the one to tell you. We don't have a body… I mean, any remains, but that happens sometimes in these cases. People've got no idea how bad the current is. The Thames is never an easy rescue. Well, you know, you have had to examine enough of them. It looks placid but it's swift and cold. Happens all the time. Make a gesture, or fall in drunk. RNLI was dispatched. They were right there, but he never surfaced. Tower lifeboat station got the call, there were witnesses. Two of them were Mycroft's men. One happened to be trained in rescue swimming, he dove in right after. He had to be rescued, in fact."
The Rat shrugs, "I'm also an artful liar. Tell me, how did you become rather publicly associated with Sherlock Holmes? " he asked with a wink, a scathing twitch of his lips and pointed twist of his head.
He soon arrived at the back door of the stone house he'd played at as a child. The Wheatley's had long ago been quirky, but Mummy adored them. His shoes and the lower half of his trousers were soggy and the rest of him had attracted a battalion of gnats that were about to drive him insane.
Mycroft smiled. “I am surprised he told you of that.  It was a long time ago.  Uncle Rudy told it to me.  I always liked Uncle Rudy.  He was a lot like Sherlock, Mad as a bag of ferrets but all dashing glamor and inappropriate humor.  I miss him.”
They whispered their evaluations and diagnoses, completely missing the truth. They put up with John's quiet dignified grief and they waited for time to relieve his obvious disinterest in the laughter he used to be part of. They invited him along to endless social events and took his polite deferments with grace. Some managed to get him cornered and speak frankly to him about how he must carry on, stiff upper lip, and other remarkably banal platitudes. John always maintained his good nature and his appreciation for their interest, but then he would walk away unperturbed, but unmoved.
Molly wrinkles her nose and shakes her head. "Are you sure you are safe? There have been a few females who did that sort of thing too. I could be wrong but I don't think you are. No, I didn't really decide just by your name. Your eyes. You have kind eyes."
He wore fine clothes, though he looked a bit rumpled and there was a tatter at his elbow. His hair was a mass of unkempt loose curls that stuck to his high forehead and obviously needed washed. His eyes open and he smiles at her. "Nobody else around, Dr. Hooper. So you will have to do."
The best to you either way you play. Don't cheat or the game ends early. Don't bother with my sister or the media. That is cheating. I know you will contact Mycroft, but I assure you, he won't be able to help you.
John was determined to wallow in his lonely tragic world. The friends began to forget to bother to ask him to their little gatherings. He'd been absent for some time and this finally became accepted as who he was. A friend can only do so much and eventually they gave up trying to make it better for him.
John stood there breathing deeply as his only display of his fury. He is silent. He blinks and shakes his head. John leaned over awkwardly. That won't work and he puts his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. He drops to one knee then brings the other down and kneels in front of Sherlock.
He was unwilling to bring up the subject. Sherlock had yet to make his own personal field of attraction a solid statement. John had tried to catch him looking lustfully at anything other than dead things, but had yet to see the expression demonstrated on Sherlock's face with any other human being. He sometimes thought maybe he saw it pointed his way, but it always vanished before he could be sure.
He hoped it would be a matter of time before Mycroft tracked him down.  He was ready to end his adventure and in his deepest heart, thought it would be a grand thing if John found happiness within his own family.  His little spy-girl had had her own adventures wind to the inevitable peaceful life of a long time widow.  He’d contented himself that soon he too would be called to retire and he’d often imagined the reunion with his sons.  He had also vividly imagined Rhino’s reaction to the discovery he’d revealed on the night he’d inadvertently caused such harm with his last minute suicide plan.
He couldn't help but dream of such things. He wasn't sure there would be another chance. Live or die, he knew who he wanted to spend his life with. Molly had been his choice only because the other choice had been taken away. He couldn't say he felt he was settling for second best, but without Sherlock, he'd allowed his dreams to morph into new more comfortably traditional places and his heart felt split. He could not be without Sherlock if allowed the option any time in the future, but he wasn't sure he wanted to be without Molly. He'd made this insane decision to go with Rat on the fly, without really weighing his options.
It's four in the morning when she pops awake. She didn't dream, probably thanks to the herbal soothers. Her mouth tastes bitter and she needs to use the lavatory. She stands and her phone is flashing that she has a text.
"I'm bandaged. Did you take me to a doctor then? Feels like torture. Guess that Jadda in Bagdad told the truth? I am officially burning in hell…no surprise who my reaper turns out to be," John says with a slight cough.
"We haven't met. You were working and I saw you. You work in the morgue and your boss is a git, and you let him push you around even though you are far smarter than he is. You're timid and like dead people because you don't have to socialize with them. You had the talent to be a surgeon, but not the confidence. Also, from your shoes I see you have migraines and must wear something that keeps your posture from having undue stress on your neck. They are special order, but you should change them more because you wear your left heel down faster than the rest of the shoe, could try tacking a nail head or two into the next new pair, will make them last longer and you'll suffer less for it if you can't afford a cobbler to attach a cleat. Doesn't cost that much, but you are frugal to a fault. Your skirt was your mother's and you wear it for sentimental reasons rather than fashion, which means you don't argue with her, could be she's amazing, but a daughter rebels against her mother's fashion choices unless…Oh, sorry for your loss. You have tiny burns on your hands, which means you worked in a chippy at some point, maybe to put yourself through University but more likely because you were too young to be doing it. They are old and there is growth on most of them, and you have only been out of Uni for three years tops, so this was a childhood job. Family business. Accent not from London, though you learned Received Pronunciation at some point, which means public school. Scholarship probably and you hated it, because you had never had time to interact with children your own age, probably stunted socially by the death of your mother, and the fact you took care of your father. It was just you and he against the wolves. Money was tight and you have never liked to spend it on yourself. Your father is quiet, so you are too, mix that with the teasing you received during your what, two years at some horrid posh girls boarding school? Must have been brilliant for them to offer you a tuition free education. Your father was so proud, wasn't he, and then he became ill and you cut your dreams short in order to take care of him, thus you stand before me a Pathologist rather than a surgeon. How is he doing?"
John rolled his eyes and crossed the room. He placed a chaste kiss on his partner’s lips, then lowered himself down to kiss Maeve’s forehead, she was undisturbed by the action. Instead, she focused on her dinner.
John sighed and stood up, bringing Maeve with him with one arm wrapped across her torso. She hiccupped and glanced around in confusion, her cries stopped for a second. She looked up at John, eyes wet and face covered in tears, dribble and snot, then looked back down at the bath. She hiccupped and started sobbing.
John was fast asleep facing the Moses basket but somehow still on his side of the bed. Maeve was snoring gently from the Moses basket, a bottle was left on the drawers half empty, so she’d been fed recently. He shed his clothes, not bothering to put on any pyjamas and slipped into bed wearing only a pair of black boxers. John stirred slightly but didn’t wake, gluing himself to Sherlock’s side and throwing an arm across his chest. He closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep, he’d need it no doubt Maeve would be hungry soon.
Sherlock reached out for his arm. “If you want to make it up to me, you can clean the next dirty nappy.”
The elder Holmes sibling looked immaculate in his suit. It was a simple but elegant piece that seemed black to the naked eye but once it was beneath the light shimmered a deep midnight blue. The collar, by contrast, was made of a black matte material and his bow tie was a dark patterned blue that matched the handkerchief in his pocket. It was an exquisite piece. Sherlock really couldn’t fault the execution of the outfit.
“For goodness sake!” Sherlock muttered more to himself than anyone else. John went to get up but Sherlock held up a hand and stated, “Its fine.”
John stepped into the flat after a particularly long and tiring shift at the surgery. He paused in the doorway and watched the cat stop mid-lick, stare at him, then go back to licking herself. He sighed and went into the kitchen, flicked the kettle on and found the cleanest looking mug on the draining board.
The consulting detective gestured to the painting that the victim’s eyes were fixed upon and began, “Look, her eyes are telling you everything. She was working late for a reason but not painting, look at her arms, there are no splatters, so why was she working late? She was killed here in the gallery, there was a reason that she picked here, who was she meeting?”
Mrs. Hudson presided over the gathering like a dignified pelican fussing over fish. She was as strong as her brew and she might sigh and look toward the ceiling as if waiting to hear footsteps from time to time, but she never faltered under the watchful eye of Isabelle Turner. She never batted an eye at the way her friends discussed her trouble with renters. They all gave the impression of being a bit mad with the way they jumped from subject to subject and seemed to make comments that sounded a bit rude, but not one of them appeared bothered by what the others said. Molly sat quietly, listening and trying to read it all as the older women expressed their condolences in one breath and criticism in the next.
