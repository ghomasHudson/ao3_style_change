awkward- never have been. Now here they are like a couple of roommates that had a drunken hookup and regret it the next morning-
He didn't truly understand it at the time, but he does now- why those words bothered Dean. Because what if the things you want are just out of reach? Out of reach in the most painful way possible, so to focus on them is almost more unbearable.
He climbs out of the cab without a single glance back. Crowley follows, slamming the door seconds after him and pitching his voice higher to be heard over the back of the truck, "Are we still pretending here that I don't know what I know?"
Bucky.” She croons, stroking a hand over the top of his head, “I was there that night. Tell these nice, stupid people what you did.”
"Yeah." John interrupts, "But Sam and Dean were taken. We can get 'em back just fine, just need... some extra hands."
He parts the curtain for a peek out the window, and sees Cas out there sitting on the Impala's trunk- feet on the bumper, elbows on knees. Perching on Baby in only a way that he or Sam are ever allowed.
And it's funny cause Cas just doesn't pull any punches, and never has any shame or embarrassment- and even now he's grinning all wide and toothy at Dean just because he so genuinely loves it when Dean laughs. The whole schtick of it is so funny because here Cas is, commenting on it, having no idea whatsoever that
"Cas!" Dean yells, if for no other purpose than to give the angel a few seconds head start and a chance at a fight.
"We gotta go. Get her out of here. Go." He tells Cas, then turns to Kelly, "Kelly, you gotta go. Go."
It's the first time he's been back to this bar in weeks, and half of him wants to drink every bottle in the establishment just to be able to pass out for a little while and stop... waiting. Stop just being here and being awake and being useless. Then another masochistic part of his brain is telling him, no. That's the last thing he deserves. What he deserves is to sit here, completely sober, eternally waiting, beside the last Winchester he ever wants to be around.
"It's only different because it was me. And because it was Sam. Unlike us, you've never been certain where you stand with your father. You've never understood why he traded his life for yours, and it’s because of that you feel you owe him." The hinges of the truck's cab creak, and the door slams with a
This is two lane asphalt, and they can part at the fork in the road or keep on the same turn together. That's the only way this is gonna work.
It drops with the sound of a cut off scream upstairs. Gail, her mother, shrieking out something unintelligible, muffled by the thickness of the door separating them.
"May I ask you something?" Cas asks after a few more minutes of silence, just listening to each other breathe on the other end.
For a moment Dean's smile alone blooms a warmth deep in this angel’s heart. He doesn't really believe Dean, but he's willing enough to try just for tonight.
John stands above Dean, Cas, and the now-corpse- the hilt of a bloodied angel blade in one hand. He quirks a brow, half smiling as he inspects the blade and looks back at his son, "You're getting rusty."
"Alright, look, we know we're dealing with a witch, right?" He swings out his arms, too, "Maybe you got hexed."
John looks at him a long moment, clearly considering something. His eyes flick to Ketch, then back to Mick.
"He's already begun to forget himself. Everyone he's ever known, ever loved. Even you." The lady says, looking at his brother, "Soon he'll forget how to speak, how to swallow, and then... Dean Winchester's going to die."
He dives into one of the horse stalls, back against the wall facing the figures. One clatters something to the ground, and a second set of footsteps ghosts quietly from behind.
books, you know." Claire says, apropos of nothing and stabbing the fork a bit aggressively to pry the bone from the center. Cas opens his mouth, closes it, having no response and uncertain Claire's even looking for one. "It was after you sent me to Jody's place. She had one shoved up behind a bunch of crappy old 99 cent mysteries. It was, uh, it was one where you beat the shit outta Dean in some alley somewhere- thought that was kinda funny..."
compared to what we've got going on now. The man's entire life wrapped around killing the thing that killed mom. Check that off the bucket list- adjustment period." He swipes a hand through the air, and Sam nods along, "Look, all he needs is a little R&R. You know, some good family time.. whatever. We’ve all just gotta… I don’t know, adjust. I guess."
Blearily swinging his head to the side, he watches Lucifer crowd over Crowley's still body amidst a pile of debris.
"Vamps in the parking lot. We think we got 'em all, but we gotta hit the road. Round up the kids and meet back in 10. Cas and I got the bodies." He hangs up and slips the phone back in his jeans before Sam can get in a word.
Dean flicks on the tv- a small piece of junk nearly a decade old that'd still static if he put his finger up to it- and settles on one of the clearer stations. It's a soap opera.
"You guys better hurry up!" Dean takes a bite of his hot dog, rapidly followed by a mouthful of fried dough while he's still chewing.
Sam finds him at the bar of the waffle shack not thirty minutes later, waltzing in with hands in his pockets and that uppity judgmental look in his eye.
That's when he hears chanting carrying out from the basement- where there’s a warm light emanating out from one of the barred windows just on the lower side of the house. Chanting that- closer he gets- sounds a lot like the same Aramaic phrasing that Olivia was said to have been shrieking as she died.
Cas has always been exceptionally good at compartmentalization. So good, in fact, he's able to convince himself on a fairly consistent basis that certain less than satisfactory truths within his life do not bother him nearly as much as they would a human in the same situation. He convinces himself of this because, quite simply, he'd rather do that and shoulder the burden than leave it to another.
The fact that Kelly ran in the first place hadn't been all that shocking, but what's odd is her ability to completely fall off the grid without any prior knowledge of how to do so. It's like she just disappeared. Only cropping up every now and again in a new town with seeming zero connection to her previous life.
“Yeah, it’s pretty good. But now…now that I have all of this freedom, I’m realizing…” Dean drew a deep breath, “I’m realizing that I want more. I want someone to share that freedom with.”
“Damn straight,” Sam muttered without thinking. He immediately flushed, but a glance at the others showed them nodding.
“Study it,” he bit out as if struggling to contain his own irritation. Dean felt a brief, petty pleasure at that.
He survived the party well enough, but as he curled up under the covers of his too-empty bed, he finally realized the inevitable: he wanted...no, needed Dean to be a permanent fixture in his life. He couldn’t see his future any other way.
He hadn’t seen Cas because Cas’s face hadn’t been his own. Cas had been hiding himself from Dean in more ways than he knew.
Dean smirked. “Prudence is almost 80, and she’s still secretary for the head of DOS. She won’t retire until she can just hop over country lines and live in her dream locale, according to her granddaughter. ”
“Let’s run through things again,” Sam called, his voice full-Alpha, yanking Dean’s attention back. He and Hannah joined Sam at the table. They hadn’t brought the entire team, since it was fewer-the-better on stealth missions like this. In the front, Meg handed off the controls to the auto-pilot then walked back to the round table where the others watched Sam pull up a holographic map from the center of the table.
Once they’d sent the boy back to his father, Sam turned to the others. “Let me and Benny scout out the place first.” He looked to Benny, who nodded. “No telling what kind of traps they left behind.”
Cas smiled softly as he reached for another cookie. “I think it will be easier to start with the follow-up.” He glanced away. “I was born with my power, like most of my brothers and sisters. But, even as an infant...it was far too strong, too volatile. Within three months, Ana had found me. She took me in, raised me, honed my skills.”
And the best part was, Dean wasn’t even in the room with them. He didn’t have to be. That’s how fucking good he was at this, at tearing Cas apart.
“Crowley,” Castiel said, kissing his chest lightly. “I can tell when you’re not being completely honest with me. You know I don’t like it.”
There was a pause, a moment of anticipation, and then Dean’s mouth was brushing against Cas’s, soft and sweet and exploring, months of hoping and waiting caught up between their lips, until suddenly it wasn’t so sweet anymore.
Victor chuckled. “That’s what I thought you’d say.” He smirked. “But don’t you worry, I have ways to bring you around to my way of seeing things. And if I don’t...”
“No, we’re gonna stay here with the little ones; makes your scent so much sweeter...” Gordon pulled in a deep breath, dragged his nose up Castiel’s throat. “God, your smell so intoxicating...drives me wild.”
Dean shook his head. “My kid brother Sammy...his girlfriend Jess overheard your little chat with Ruby.”
“Whenever he’s allowed to reach out, I suppose.” She held up her phone for Dean to see the screen. “He’s even stopped texting me.”
Ana’s heavy sigh interrupted him. “I don’t think you quite understand your own predicament. The idea that a bond could be rejected...it’s very western.” She smiled. “Which is funny, considering that the West invented the bond with that insatiable need for forbidden knowledge.”
“Chasing me?” Cas breathed. “You were chasing…” He brought a trembling hand up to Dean’s jaw and stroked a soft thumb over his cheek.
Castiel stared at the ground for a long moment, then looked back up at his uncle. “So this drive is, essentially, a substitute for
Cas gasped when Dean shifted closer, out from under the steering wheel, and pulled Cas onto his lap. With a giggle, Cas rolled his hips, thrilled by the promising bulge he felt under him. The giggle was followed with an immediate “OW!” as he banged his head on the rearview mirror.
"Like that's a surprise," Charlie said, rolling her eyes. "You'll end up married to him just for the convenience."
So while Dean headed to the capitol to meet with some prospective clients, Cas spent the party snugly sandwiched between Anna and Meg. And while Cas wished that Dean could be there with him, his boyfriend’s presence was still felt in the careful way Michael greeted him, the tense smile Uriah offered, the disapproving glares Hester shot at him throughout the night.
When the dismissal bell rang on Friday, I was waiting outside the side door that nobody used, where Balth had agreed to lead Cas. No sooner had Cas’s eyes met mine, he was running towards me.
Castiel watched from the shadows as Dean stepped to the bannister and drew in a deep breath of the garden’s fragrant night air.
He’d been so near this entire time...but what did it matter? To him, Cas wasn’t even someone to pity. No, to him, Cas was but a neighbor to thank.
“But his protege, who’s managed to surpass him in the few years he’s been active, is our real target.”
Suddenly, warm arms slid around him from behind. Cas flinched, already panicking about losing control over his power, but rather than break off, his blue light flared, steadied. There was no more wavering, no more uncertainty.
“Then whose magic was it?” Sam asked as they headed deeper into the shadows, only flashlights to guide their way.
They both turned to find a short, grinning man standing at the other end of the VIP area. Dean glanced around to find that most of the girls had fled back to their dates and groups, while Meg and Anna had taken a pair of seats along the wall. They both smirked at the flustered men who were still wrapped around each other.
Dean’s mind raced. Had that been the couple that the men had been joking about before Dean and Benny got to them? The gang they’d just finished off—and yes, once upon a time Dean would have felt bad about killing actual humans, but these men had only been out for blood, adding to the mayhem by attacking innocent civilians trying to reach safety, which meant that they were just as bad as the real monsters out there—but they’d talked about an alpha and omega couple...
“Oh, stop with that!” Dean interrupted. “I’m no such thing. I'm arrogant, impatient, sarcastic...as you can probably attest to.”
Castiel jumped out of bed and scrambled to get some clothes on before running into the bathroom to check his hair and gargle some mouthwash. He was just pulling on his Chucks when the doorbell rang.
Dean thought of the advisor Raphael, standing towards the back of the crowd, who’d stared forlornly at the princess when he thought no one else was looking. Unfortunately for him, Dean was always looking, always planning. He couldn’t shut it off, because if he shut it off… He shook the thought away.
A key sounded in the lock, startling him. Ellen had said she’d check on him in the morning. Had the entire night already passed?
Cas shrugged. “I tried, but you ran away on me.” He leaned back against the table and stretched his long legs out, waiting for Dean to figure out what he meant. He could see when it clicked with him, when he remembered that last night when he’d jumped out the bathroom window, never to return.
The baker who told them about the ruins sent his son along as a guide. It was a hike up, but they still reached the dilapidated building with its broken arches and crumbling walls well before nightfall.
Dean nodded. “Sooner the better. She’s waiting for me.” He pointed to a woman standing inside the ballroom.
We parked in the employee lot behind the abandoned Kmart and dug into our burgers as we talked about our mornings, me at Bobby’s, him at school. But when we’d finished eating, I pulled him into my lap and let him snuggle close.
He'd finally given himself the chance to change, to start anew. He needed to give Dean the same chance.
Dean finally glanced away, guilt clear on his features. “I didn’t want to, okay? But I had to. There’s this guy…”
“I don’t know what stopped that elevator,” Victor said, pulling Dean’s mind back to the conference room in D.C., “but whatever deity you’ve got on your side saved your skin that day, even if you couldn’t save your crew’s.”
And suddenly, he realized why Castiel was so hesitant. Why he seemed to still hold part of himself away, protective and secret. It was simple self-preservation, preparation for later this evening when Dean would say, “Your family is awful; thanks, but no thanks.”
Jess had barely opened her locker on Monday when she heard a soft, deep “Hello, Jess” from beside her. She glanced over to find Cas standing there, the happy expression back in its place.
Dean scoffed. “It wasn’t the first time they’ve been arrested, and it probably won’t be the last…well, actually, I think it was Kevin’s first arrest.”
“No!” the gargled voice cried. The cry continued, even as the body burst open in a shower of blood and viscera, and the creature within broke free. It was huge, grotesque, all sharp angles and blood-thirsty eyes.
That was okay; Dean could be busy too. That Bela girl had been flirting with him nonstop since day one. And she was a cheerleader, so he knew she'd be bendy and curvy and just what he needed. He shot off the text to her without letting himself think twice.
Cas slowly turned back to look up at the man who still waited for an answer. The ruckus of the bakery faded away. He felt himself being pulled into those brilliant green eyes. He’d never seen that rosy blush this close, those plush lips that parted on a soft exhalation as Cas’s gaze flickered oh-so-briefly to them.
When Brady saw Novak in Anatomy on Monday, the dude went white then blushed up to his hairline. He studiously avoided Brady’s gaze and kept his head down.
He poked his head out the bathroom door, looking both ways before he ventured out into the silent hall. He slowly climbed down the stairs, pausing every couple of steps to regain his balance, and toward the gym. He'd sneak out the locker room door and make a dash for the student parking lot from there.
“I know,” Dean growled. “It’s my stupid body trying to…” His voice trailed off as he ran into his room. He emerged a moment later, shoving some belongings into a small bag. “...so you’ll need to take the rest of my stuff when you leave.”
Castiel followed Donna up to the infirmary ward, his breath tight in his throat. What if...what if Dean made him leave? Castiel had essentially been the reason for Gordon going insane and trying to blow the place up. No, Dean wouldn’t be so cruel, not with the due date only weeks away...
“You’re the absolute best, Balth!” Cas called as he ran around to the passenger side, and then we were pulling away, headed for the interstate.
Meg stood stiffly, her entire frame radiating anger. Even in her anger, though, she knew to hold herself in check. She gritted out, “You know, I’ve just remembered another engagement. If you’ll excuse me.”
Oh...right. He wasn’t ignoring Benny and Dean. He was just keeping to his cover as an omega who only spoke Russian. He was really just that
Of course there was no mention of what Dean had done to Cas. Dean knew him well enough to know that there never would be.
truth...well, the prince might not feel too kindly toward Cas after that. He might even just make the entire thing, including Cas himself, disappear.
“None of your damn business,” Winchester growled. “Now get the hell out of here before I beat the shit outta you for annoying me.”
The bricks they’d ripped away from the wall exposed a giant iron door with an elaborate locking mechanism. Despite the lock, the door hung open on its hinges, revealing a gaping black void beyond.
About time, isn’t it? Most of us figured it out in the second scene…or maybe even the first, because was there ever any chance of it going any other way?
Dean kept staring, silently willing Cas to return his gaze, but the detective was stubborn. He kept his eyes firmly locked on the wall above Garth’s head.
He yanked the drawer open, glowering at the object. Of course Dean would choose some obnoxious classic rock song for his ringtone. He picked up the phone, jotting down the number in his notebook before he pressed the answer button.
Not only had Cas preserved his life, but he’d also provided answers to the questions that had plagued Dean’s mind for months. With this final goodbye, Cas had done more for Dean than he deserved. But even with that knowledge, the gaping hole that had torn itself into his chest remained.
It wasn’t until later, when students and their families mingled on the school’s spacious front lawn, that Brady finally learned the reason for Novak missing.
“I’m not sure, Sweetie,” Castiel murmured, allowing the boy to plaster himself to his side. “Dean will find out for us.”
He turned to Sam and Dean. “We must go. Now!” And then he was running away through the forest, light and swift. Dean took a moment to tug Hannah into a final hug and offer a whispered farewell before running after Castiel, trusting Sam to eventually catch up.
Castiel drew up short. "No! No! It was completely consensual!" Now he had to tell or Crowley would think he'd been forced. "He said...he said I wasn't a slut."
At Castiel’s flat look, she sighed heavily. “I know, my boy, I don’t have to tell you. You are the expert, after all.”
The blue eyes shifted to glance over Dean’s shoulder, and Dean finally snapped out of his haze. He slammed the door shut, cutting off Cas’s view, and spun around to find Sam and Benny in clear line-of-sight. Shit, there was no way Cas couldn’t have made them.
“He was in excellent spirits when I left,” Castiel reported, not bothering to question how she knew he’d met with Balthazar that morning. He’d learned long before that there was little that escaped Hester’s watchful eye. Even without children of her own, she’d somehow managed to claim the coveted position of matriarch within the family tree, and Castiel knew from experience that it would be unwise to question her.
Cas stopped his rambling, instead staring at Dean. Dean, who stepped right into his space. Dean who gently cupped his cheek. Dean, who slowly leaned down to press the lightest of kisses to Cas’s lips.
The biggest change, the most obvious one, was Gordon. Castiel should have noticed it, he really should have, but he didn't until the situation became too blatant to ignore.
Castiel held up a hand to cut him off. “All is forgiven, Agent Winchester. Besides, you weren’t the only one who ran that day. I owe you an apology as well.”
More confused voices rose at the statement, but Cas held up a hand to silence them. “I hold a separate power no supreme has ever known. No matter where I go, the forest is always with me. Always.”
“Hannah!” His voice lashed out. “You will leave, you will take Dean with you, you will seal the spell, and you will go to the Council with my instructions!”
“But it doesn’t have to be!” Cas argued, reaching to grasp Dean by the face. He dipped down, so close to touching his mouth to Dean’s, when he suddenly froze.
Then, when there were no more breaths, he brought the gun to Michael’s temple, drew a deep breath, squeezed his eyes shut. Then he pulled the trigger.
Sam stood near the back of Ana’s kitchen, watching as she and Hannah joined hands over a pot of… something. He hadn’t felt inclined to ask about all the details of the ritual. Around them, the Council joined hands, creating a circle with the two witches at the center. Between the circle and the witches were four candles that stood for north, south, east, west. On the floor beneath all this was an aged map, stained with the ink and wax of prior rituals.
Cas had been the mark, and he hadn’t even known. One would think, given the downward spiral he’d witnessed his mother go through with his father, that he’d be able at least recognize when he was being played. But he hadn’t. He’d thought…
Dean actually laughed. “Sammy! You wound me.” He clapped his hand over his heart. “But I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: never underestimate the value of an incorrect assumption.”
And really, Cas was already shunned by society. What would one more strike against his name mean in the face of so much hatred? Plus, if Amara told the
Castiel paused to consider the question, shocked when he realized that the answer was...never. Even at the start, when Castiel had first started sneaking off with Victor, he didn't feel anything beyond the thrill of doing something so wrong. But now... Now he actually felt something about the person he was meeting.
“He owns interest in more than a couple companies that would make profit off the new bill, both for the infrastructure side that the public can see....and the guns and security side, which the public can’t see. His brother-in-law…” The omega trailed off, then shook his head. “Actually, I won’t go into all that—we’ll be here all night. Suffice to say, Pete’s new budget would guarantee him more money on two separate fronts, none of which will go back into his district, and most of the public won’t even know.”
"Well, well. If it isn't New Boy," his voice dropped, "sticking his nose in where it doesn't belong. Get off on standing up for sluts?"
“We have a date planned for dinner Friday,” Dean answered smugly. “I’ll check in with you afterwards.”
He paused at the occasional piece, head cocked to the side, considering, evaluating. He should have one of the interns rearrange the American Regionalism exhibit...it didn’t feel quite right, not since they’d added the Curtis piece last week.
What the public hadn’t known, but the scientists definitely had, was that the compound used to ascribe them their secondary gender would fuse with their DNA, change their very core...pass down to their children. Now, decades later, most of the children born in the States, and a good percentage of those born around the globe, held some form of the mutation.
“The answer is no, Dean. I can’t separate Castiel from Lucifer.” After a moment, Michael meets Dean’s eyes. “I’m sorry.”
Dean sits in a chair across from the rusalka— kinda losing his mind, kinda really goddamn frustrated, kinda wanting either a coffee mug or a weapon in his hand like an alcoholic wants a drink— and tries to listen to her rambling. He’s pretty sure she’s trying to apologize to him, but she’s so worked up that she keeps slipping into Russian or something, and he can’t understand most of the resulting distressed franken-language for the life of him.
“Leo,” Dean repeats, lifting his hand to connect the stars with his finger. “The constellation. The Greeks made up stories about ‘em, used them to help navigate and keep track of the year. Sam and I used to stargaze a lot when we were kids, and he had a constellation kick that lasted a couple years.”
Cas is holding an oddly shaped bundle, and it crinkles faintly when he puts it down on the roof so he can finish climbing up. Dean scoots over as Cas closes the hatch and starts towards him, because he’s not gonna ask Cas to
The point is, Dean’s doing badly. The kind of bad that ends in an early grave, no matter how he gets there. And Sam absolutely refuses to help him dig it.
The idea of someone— anyone, really— watching him while he sleeps has always been a big no-no. Nope. He doesn’t like it, no matter who it comes from. It’s way too vulnerable: letting someone see you soft and weak with your guard down is, to say the least, a bad idea, for both practical and more personal reasons. Ill-advised in the extreme when you’re living a hunter’s life. When you’re living
Cas runs a hand through his hair, trailing down to rub at the back of his neck. “It will take as long as it needs to. And I’ll be here the whole time, Dean. You aren’t doing this alone.”
Sam looks at him, not rising to the bait in the slightest. “It’s been half a year,” he says, a little sadly. “That’s a pretty big milestone. I guess it’s just hitting harder right now, y’know?”
And then he stalls. What… what the hell does he say? ‘I’m gonna take the drag, and then you just inhale it outta my mouth. No biggie.’ He can’t— fuck. He shakes his head. “Y’know what, just… when I tap your wrist, open your mouth and breathe in.
Charlie huffs an exasperated sigh. “That doesn’t make this a good way to handle things. He has to deal with it in his own time, and it’ll take as long as it takes. So back off a little, alright? I get it, I do. But this isn’t how you’re gonna help him.”
“What’s the deal, Sam?” he bites out, interrupting him mid-sentence. “Why the trip down memory lane?”
Now, Sam’s under no illusions; he knows that if the plan slowly forming in his head works, all he’ll be doing is plain old third-wheeling. But honestly, he’ll take it. He might regret saying this later, but he’d take gross, overt PDA over the usual infuriating UST any day.
Dean smiles tightly. “There, that wasn’t so hard. If you ever try to talk to me about this again, I will punch you out and then drive to the other side of the country. Got it?”
Thankfully, Cas can be one hell of a distracting guy when he feels like it. And judging by the way he backs Dean against a bookshelf, dragging his teeth over Dean’s lower lip, he
He never did ask Cas to be his smoking buddy. He definitely thought about it as the three of them ate dinner; Cas was in a good mood tonight, smiley and relaxed. It would’ve been so easy to crack a joke and toss the offer out there.
Cas looks between the three of them, flush with power: Sam, Bobby, and Dean, looking ashamed and apologetic, terrible for having doubted him. His palms tingle with leftover Grace, the bodies of the demons smoke slightly at his feet, and he allows himself a small grin as he basks in the warmth of Dean’s— Dean’s relief. Dean’s
Dean thinks. He doesn’t say that. “So that’s what you were doing when you went out earlier.” That doesn’t get a response out of Sam, though, so Dean stifles a sigh and plays along. “Really? You wanna have a
“Anything you bring will be wonderful!” She enthused, distracting M. Winchester just long enough for Cas to extract his arm and hurry for the door.
Cas remembered his mission, and the practiced speech tumbled from his lips. “While I appreciate your generosity, it is unnecessary. I do not need gifts, especially those given out of pity.”
It’d be a lot easier at home, away from all this, but Dean still had a job to do. He had to figure out Sammy’s thing, and the faster he could get it done, the faster he could leave.
Castiel shook his head. “I’m very good at blending in.” And then, while they both watched, his face shifted—more like morphed—into a replica of Meg’s.
"Ah, the ol' bathroom stall," Crowley reminisced, his tone wistful. Castiel laughed, shoving him lightly in the shoulder.
The boys let out matching moans, long and loud, as Dean's cock slid all the way in on the first thrust.
"I'll get my GED, then go work in my uncle Bobby's garage," Dean shrugged. "I want to work on cars anyway, so it's no big deal."
“Back in the old days, a lot of these sanatorium places had these chutes where they could dispose of bodies without alarming the patients. They’d use the chutes to transport bodies out to a mass grave.”
Castiel glanced down at his fingers, tamping down on his jealousy. It wasn't his right. "Maybe you should ask her out instead."
“Not long, just over a couple years. But the day came when I found I could no longer trust them.” His eyes flitted to meet Dean’s. “I believe you have some experience in that area.”
"So big!" Castiel panted as he rocked his hips gently, his walls tightening around Dean's shaft. "You stretch me so nice."
Hannah motioned for Dean to go first then followed. She pointed toward the ruined town as they crossed the dry field. “That’s the town where Castiel grew up. Each of those buildings holds a memory of his life.”
The man’s eyes had gone distant, like he was remembering that particular chase, and Cas could see the exact instant that he remembered the moment that Cas spoke of. He’d grinned and winked at Cas as he’d rushed past.
“Why don't you boys go set the table then get washed up for dinner?” Mary suggested to Castiel and Dean, nodding toward the stacks of plates and cups on one end of the counter. “Sam, help me wash those veggies to be cut up for the salad.”
They glanced toward Raphael, the closest of their father’s advisors, but he was frowning too. “I’d just assumed they would bring one, that’s pretty customary…”
Man, where the hell was this guy? He said he’d be here with the— a knock on the driver window made him yelp. With a frown, he lowered the window the bare minimum.
Meg swung to point an accusing finger at Lucifer, uncaring of the consequences. “I hope your payout is worth it.” She slowly backed away to follow her cousin. “You know, I always wondered if I made the right choice, staying away from you.”
Castiel watched as Dean practically vaulted himself into the car and edged it up to his starting spot, along with the other racers. The gun sounded, and the cars were off. Most of them were there for the fun, their team, the little bit of money they could earn. Their job was to break in the track, nothing more.
Hannah held up a hand to halt his words. “Yes, you’ve been physically searching for him. Now, you are going to spiritually connect to him...as his mate.”
Was it any wonder that so many people had stopped to stare at him as they’d navigated the crowded floor below? And even up above, when they reached the VIP area, the door had no sooner closed them off from the loud club below than they were surrounded by some of the other girls who were already in attendance. Both Anna and Meg had been pushed aside, but neither seemed surprised. So this was apparently the norm when out with Cas?
Dean cleared his throat and turned the conversation back to the machine. “But what if you already have a bond?”
“But I still love you…” Cas pulled away just enough to press up for a kiss. Dean slid his arms up Cas’s back, pulling him in even closer. Cas broke away and pressed his forehead to Dean’s. “I love you, so fucking much. And even with all that bullshit...I can’t see my future without you.”
He shrugged. “Fine. A bit overwhelmed.” He looked down at the mug. “I’m so used to the silence of the forest, and now suddenly I’m plunged back into this life, and a machine tries to bond me to some man I’ve just met, even though I don’t even have a secondary gender.”
.” His tone was sarcastic enough for me to glare. “Look, most people aren’t mind readers, so if you want to
Dean still wasn’t sure how this had happened, his being grouped with a bunch of random family members. There was Michael, a cousin; and Raphael, another cousin; and Uriel, an uncle. Castiel had stayed behind at the clubhouse, at Hester’s urging, to “provide your poor aunt some company, my boy.”
The internet blew up again. Yes, there were the pictures of Dean and the dark-haired man entering his building that night. But it seemed most people were more interested in the pictures from the next morning, the ones of Dean and Cas leaving his building in search of some breakfast, hands clasped tightly between them.
The night of the gala, however, when Dean arrived at the studio and spotted them holding court in the center of the floor, they both managed to look calm and in-charge. Anna wore a sheer black floral gown, while Castiel was in a velvet tuxedo of dark blue with the traditional black slacks, white shirt, and black bowtie.
Castiel blushed, and smiled down at his shoes. They stopped by his locker first so that he could get the books he needed. Dean leaned against the wall next to it, the sun light from the window bathing him in a golden light. Castiel was admiring him when a hand slammed his locker door closed. Gordon Walker stood next to him, grinning evilly.
“Yeah,” Dean smiled and leaned back in, bringing his lips so close to Cas’s again but not quite meeting them. “So when she came over and caught me moping around the house on Thursday, after you’d brushed me off
Gordon sneered at the young man then shot one final heavy look toward Castiel. “We’ll finish this later, omega.” Then he spun and walked away.
Castiel didn't see much of Dean over the next couple days. Sure, they passed each other in the hallways, and Castiel caught a couple glimpses of him across the crowded cafeteria during lunch. Not that he was actively seeking him out or anything; he was just...aware. Yeah, that was it; he was being aware.
Afterwards, Castiel straddled Dean’s lap, panting prettily into his neck as Dean stroked his back soothingly.
“Give me another chance?” Dean asked. Cas looked so lost, but Dean pushed on, grabbing one of Cas’s hands in both of his own. “I’m sorry about what I said in that interview, the way I just shoved you away. I need...I
He’d been in such a hurry, looking down at the cracked road, he didn’t see the obstacle in his path until he’d smacked right into it.
No one pointed out the obvious: Dean just wanted to see Castiel, make sure he was okay. Dean knew he’d mentioned the other man a few times here and there.
“You sure about this?” Dean asked one final time. “I mean, it’d only be a couple hours wait to hit the road.”
There was so much good he could do if he went back. But then he’d thought of the memory he’d just seen, Cas on the jet. He remembered the pain Cas had hidden from him, that Cas had protected him from for so long. After all that Cas had done for him, after all that Dean done to Cas without even knowing it…
“The way you make me feel, just being here beside me.” Dean kissed Cas’s cheek. “Every time you laugh,” Another kiss to his temple. “Smile.” A kiss to that one spot behind his ear. “Whenever you just fuckin’
Castiel spoke silently in the claustrophobic space of the closet, his gentle words competing with Michael’s final gulps of air. He told his alpha the story of them one final time, listened as he slipped away, breath by breath.
When Cas had finished up his plate, he set the dish aside and leaned back contentedly. “Ellen is such a good cook.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. "Can we please stop talking about my mother right before you're about to get into my pants? It's a little bit of a turn-off."
Dean wasted no time, did not hesitate, to walk right up to him and pull him from his seat. He slid a long, possessive arm around Castiel’s waist and smiled warmly.
Then Castiel found himself at Dean’s bedside, wrapped tightly in the alpha’s arms, all dignity gone as he wept into his chest.
Dean had never been one to worry. Since childhood, he’d been fortunate enough to hold the innate conviction that no matter what happened, he’d figure it out. People with a past like his didn’t know any other way. Either figure it out, or...well, Dean wasn’t quite sure what the other option was, because he always fucking figured it out.
His smile was so soft and sweet. “I just want to be as happy as I am right now, right here with you.”
As soon as she was out of sight, Cas pressed the minuscule button to release the cat’s paw. It meowed in protest, even as it tugged its leg in, trying to protect itself.
Dean’s playful expression slipped away. He nodded and, with a sigh, shared a memory that obviously pained him: “The only reason you helped your mother hide her from the prince that day was because you didn’t want her to leave. You loved her too much, and you knew she would never love him like she loved you.”
Once Cas had given Dean his address, they pulled onto the empty street. After a second of awkward silence, Dean glanced at Cas. “So, I’m a little confused. Brady said that you never talked, but not only have you talked to me, you’re actually pretty…” he paused to search for the word.
“It’s fine. You weren’t very coordinated.” Cas’ voice is a strange mixture of exasperated and fond, and Dean’s stomach gives a wobbly little flutter.
As the silence strings itself out, becoming more and more painful, Cas’ expression closes off. “Apologies,” he says woodenly, his eyes shuttered and dull. “I shouldn’t have said that.”
Overcome with a particularly painful stab of despair, Dean collapses onto the edge of his bed, his head in his hands. “I’m sorry,” he whispers. “I’m trying. I promise, I am. I just…”
“Yep,” Dean says, popping the ‘p’. “Signed my paperwork before we left.” He makes a face. “Dammit, I’m gonna have to call Joe. Tell him I can’t start Monday.”
“Nah,” Charlie retorts easily, coming to flop down in the scant space remaining at the other end of the bench. “Honestly, I’m probably gonna end up getting one of my own once you take him back. That little fuzzball’s wormed his way into my heart.”
“And afterwards?” He seethes, his hands clenched into fists. “It took me two months before I could get to sleep without a drink or six, because you were
Dean’s eyelids droop a little, his head lolling. Things are fuzzy. He should just… he could let go. It’d be fine. Jack’s up there, waiting for him. He’ll get to see the kid, see Bobby and his mom. Ellen, Jo, Ash. All those guys. Sam doesn’t need him, not really. He’ll be okay.
Dean isn’t actually looking at him. He’s looking somewhere off to Cas’ right, like he can’t bear to look directly at him. To meet his eyes.
It leaves a sour taste in his mouth and he feels like the worst kind of fraud. He hates being on this end of a deal.
Sometimes he’s fine. Cas will stay the night, and Dean will wake in the morning to another body wrapped around his. And on good days, when casual intimacy isn’t a minefield he's stumbling blindly through, he’ll do nothing more than snuggle closer and brush his lips over the closest patch of skin.
no way Dean’ll be able to salvage this situation. He’ll be on the Winchester equivalent of suicide watch until he’s old and grey.
“You fucking bastard,” Dean forces out, his voice thick and constricted. “How could you… how could you
That’s the clearest thought Dean has right now. The clearest thought he’d had ten seconds ago was that he was proud of Sam, that he loved him, and that he was gonna goddamn well tell him all that before he bit it. Who knew getting kebabed was all it took to break the stupid dam that’s been stopping him from telling Sam how awesome he is every chance he gets? He had some really good stuff to say, too, and now Sam’s not even gonna hear it because he’s
Dinner, when it finally rolls around, is stilted and awkward. ‘Course it is. Dean saw that one coming a mile away. It’s conducted mostly in silence, and Dean is fully intent on retreating to his room after he’s done. He doesn’t really have a plan for tonight except to avoid sleep for as long as possible. He only needs four hours. He can survive on that,
Chapter two, ka-pow! Done. I really love the songs for this chapter, I've been looping Ship To Wreck for... a long ass time, at this point. It's such a good song, and I love me some Florence. I'm hoping to finish writing chapter four this week, but the posting schedule will probably break down a lil bit next month. Things happen, lol, and I'm forseeing some delays.
“I won’t stop you, if… if that’s really what you want.” He doesn’t leave it there. He wouldn’t. “But that’s an answer in itself. So.”
he tells himself miserably as he turns his face into the worn, age-softened fabric of his pillowcase.
Cas closes his door behind him, and Jack does the same before walking around the car. “Would you like to test us?” Cas asks, nodding towards the Impala. “I know that this is… unexpected.”
was bitchin’, okay? It was one of the few books he actually gave more than a passing glance in high school. He liked it. And there’s a beat-up old copy on the shelf inside the cabin that he’d reread last week.) Sam finally grows a pair and sets his coffee down deliberately, turning a little towards Dean. “Y’know,” he starts, watching Dean like a hawk, “I realized we never really had a funeral for Cas.”
He squints against the sunshine as he makes his way towards the stupid little walking path, the light intensifying the headache he’d woken up with. He kinda feels like shit this morning; his sleeping pills didn’t fail him, as far as he can remember, but behind the grey wall of medically-induced unconsciousness there’s the echo of something huge, dark, and painful looming just out of sight. He doesn’t think about it too hard except to wonder, briefly, how long he’s gonna be able to keep this up before the shit he’s suppressing starts working itself into his waking hours. (He might get the answer to that question sooner rather than later, though. He’s got less than a week’s worth of sleep aids left after last night.)
yes. Thanks for reading, and I hope I'll see you down in the comments! I love talking to you guys, it legitimately gives me so much motivation.
And again… whoops. This took a month and a half, lol. I have no idea how long the next chapter will take, so. Pls hang in there, we might be getting somewhere interesting next chap 👀
Sam shakes them off with a huff, sparing Cas a last, poisonous look before storming outside. Dean watches him go, breathing hard.
Sam lets out a shout and surges forward as Cas catches Dean’s wrists in his hands, but Dean’s already ripping himself out of Cas’ grip and stumbling away before Sam can reach them. His cheeks are wet, his breathing hitched and irregular.
he thinks as he strips off the nice knit zip-up Sam had insisted he needed and rolls up the sleeves of his button-down. He just wants his henleys and his jeans back. His
(Associative sense memory’s a bitch, ain’t it? Thanks a lot, Billie.) He stutters to a stop and sucks in a sharp breath. His head is full of static. “Let go of me, Sam.”
There’s a lump in Sam’s throat, and the magnitude of the sorrow rushing through him on Dean’s behalf almost steals his breath. “You didn’t say anything back, did you.”
It’s not hard, though. Before long Dean isn’t even thinking about it anymore; he and Cas are just sitting and talking and looking at each other, and it’s simple. It’s good. One of Cas’ hands rests on the table, and Dean’s eyes keep sliding to it like they’re magnetized.
“There you are!” a voice called out, and at first Cas thought he’d been spotted, but then Sam walked into view.
Dean stared at the alpha, and even through the haze in his mind, he knew that if he really said no, Castiel would stay away. But Dean didn’t want him to stay away, he just didn’t want a mate who hated him. But Cas was here...he’d tracked him down, which had to mean...
Cas pushed away from the table, hurrying across the room toward the door. “You should go,” he announced, opening the door and holding it for Dean.
“My car’s over here,” Dean announced unnecessarily then spun to begin walking toward his car with Cas right behind.
Castiel sighed happily, his mind replaying those too-brief moments in the food line when bright green eyes had met his. A tiny smirk had played along plush pink lips as the boy sucked a white spork into his mouth. And then he'd pulled it from his mouth with an obscene pop, winking at Castiel before turning away to move further up the line.
“We’ll go ahead to the table; I doubt she’ll be here for a little while yet,” Aunt Hester decreed, and Pierre was showing them back.
“Forget about what I said,” Castiel pleaded. “I was obviously an idiot about so many things, but somehow I still ended up here, mated with you.” Dean reached up to cup his cheek, and Castiel pressed a kiss to the palm. “God, I’m so glad I came after you.”
Cas couldn’t guess how long they would’ve stood there, locked in an intense staring contest, if a car hadn’t flown by just then. It seemed to jolt both of them back to reality, because they both pulled their hands back and took a step apart.
“Don’t worry, Sweetheart, I’ll finish you up next time.” I gave him one last peck on the lips then pushed him out from under the bleachers, just like he had to me.
He’d prepared himself for this visit, plastered on his best flat expression and mental guards for people’s inevitable derision. But when he stepped into the town square, he found that no one actually paid him any mind. No, they were all watching the man who held court at the center of the square—the very man Cas had come to see.
“You won’t have any luck with just some feelers,” Castiel replied. “It’ll take months of deep cover just to regain access to the inner circle. Then I’ll be able to learn the supply chain, track the moving parts.”
Dean took another step forward and cautiously plucked the gun from the omega’s grasp. He’d learned the hard way that some people just couldn’t leave their loved ones behind, even if they were dead.
Minutes later, the plane came to a stop. Still Castiel sat, staring out the window. The memories of his summer with Dean, every date, every kiss, every night...they looped again and again. Now though, he could see the breaks, the cracks...the way Dean would sometimes be a little too attentive at family dinners, the way he’d shoot off texts when he got a second alone. Castiel, idiot that he was, thought they had been work texts. Well, he’d been right, but it’d been the wrong work.
. “Then whose is it? Because I gotta tell you, I’ve never seen someone so broke up about trouble that wasn’t even theirs.”
He decided to text Dean during lunch and asked to meet after school, and Dean immediately texted back
“Mom!” Dean groaned, embarrassed but smiling as Cas pulled him back in for another round of pictures.
"Ah, the new boy," Crowley murmured. His eyebrows lifted as he thought about this other boy who Castiel was obviously falling for. There was the slight pang in his chest, just like always when he thought about Castiel, but this time, he actually felt...happy for him. Especially when Castiel muttered in a rush of breath, "We went for burgers."
On Monday, when the long, luxurious weekend came to an end, Dean tugged Cas into a cab that drove them to some unknown destination. Apparently, they were going to see an old friend of Dean’s, a friend who had kindly provided them with a private jet and a pricey villa, and everything in between.
Dean paused, just a quick breath, and Castiel could only sit dumbfounded as the omega pressed on, his words coming faster.
“Is it a bomb?” Sam asked from his spot on the other side of Castiel. “Because with all those wires and buttons and shit...looks like some kind of over-elaborate bomb you’d see on TV.”
“It’s all a bit much to take in, I know. Especially when...” Dean trailed off, a red blush staining his cheeks as he stopped himself from stating the obvious. “Anyways, we all keep sleeping quarters pretty close together. It’s just up here down this hallway.”
After only a moment’s thought, he spun around to face whoever was there, only to find the hallway empty.
“You’re practically grown now, Sammy. Between your scholarships and the money already in the college fund, you’ll be pretty set.” He looked over to Cas, who beamed back at him. “Cas and I are going to Arizona for his college. I’ll be looking for a job nearby so we can save up money for whenever we decide to get married.”
He’d heard the team mocking the mother and son, but if they knew the darkness of this creature...They didn’t understand how much danger they had been in, taunting the unholy thing that had escaped its prison by using Kazimir as host.
He looked down at the baby, his mind whirling. He should go to whatever room they’d picked out for him and get some rest. But here, with a pup on his hip and the sound of the kids’ laughter in the air, it was almost like normal. It was like...like Michael would be at home waiting for him at the end of the day. It let him push everything away, just for now.
And yet they were still there, haunting him, prodding him. Every time he closed his eyes, he could see Cas’s blue eyes, wide and hungry and desperate as he’d ridden him that night… Dean turned on the faucet and splashed cold water across his face to shove the thoughts away. When he looked back up at himself in the mirror, he almost hated who he saw.
the other night,” he replied, a soft smile finally lifting his mouth. “And I’m tired of fighting this, of chasing you.”
He watched as Garth pretended to stumble as he walked past the pedestal holding the egg, and Castiel smirked. “There.”
“Well, I am one of the best. So I’d say since their preference is to be the best company, it only makes sense.”
“Well, that didn’t take long!” Ellen grinned at him from behind the glass as he lined the children up single file to pass through.
Castiel froze, staring at the old man who stood from his seat and walked towards him. He didn’t speak,
So, uh… sorry about that one? That nightmare physically hurt me to write, so like… I am legitimately sorry. But Cas is back! So! That’s good!
Dean grins. “Just wanted to know if you had any special requests for dinner tonight. Chef Dean’s feelin’ creative.”
of blood loss. A punctured lung, which is fun. Never had one of those before. Bruising on his liver and spleen. A couple cracked ribs. Apparently his heart stopped briefly just after they got him into surgery, so heart failure, too. Not to mention the hole in his back, the one that’s got almost seven stitches holding it closed. On the
Dean laughs, and it’s genuine if a little wet. He tugs Cas through the door, onto the landing, and cups his stupid, beautiful face in his hands. Cas blinks at him, wide-eyed, and Dean couldn’t care less that Sam’s standing right here next to them. He wouldn’t care if the Bunker collapsed around their ears right this minute. He caresses Cas’ cheekbones with his thumbs, fully aware that there are a couple of big fat tears rolling down his cheeks, and not giving a single flying fuck about it. “Cas, you— I’m so goddamn mad at you, I’m gonna kick your ass after all this is done, but— me too, you idiot.
He exhales and watches the bluish cloud of smoke curl up into the cloudless sky. The stars are just starting to come out, a few tiny pinpricks of light here and there. If he stays out here long enough he might be able to see some constellations.
He dumps his dishes in the sink with a clatter, then sits on the bench beside the door and stifles little grunts of pain as he leans over to lace up his boots. And then finally, he gets to leave the tense, heavy atmosphere of the cabin behind.
Cas only breaks away to breathe out, but he’s back before Dean has time to mourn the loss. And he’s— he’s kissing Dean for real, now, and Dean makes an utterly horrifying whimper that Cas swallows right up before dragging his teeth along Dean’s bottom lip.
His voice is low and placating, but not pitying. Still, Dean swallows and starts to shuffle his feet, just enough to constitute something adjacent to dancing. Cas goes along with it, but his focus on Dean’s face doesn’t abate in the slightest.
Sam turns away from the sad selection of fruit the convenience store has to offer, a splotchy banana still in hand. Cas is holding a polyester teddy bear with a satiny red heart clamped between its fluffy pink paws, staring at it in consternation. Sam grins.
“Cas, you almost ready? We’ve gotta check out before eleven, and I don’t think this is the kinda place I can bribe the front desk at, man—”
His pale excuse for a prayer ends there. He hasn’t stopped praying in the interminable months, not really; doesn’t think he could even if he wanted to. It’s instinct at this point. Even though he knows… even though he knows no one’s listening, and even though he can’t bear to address any of his broken-down whisperings directly. So this is what he has left: sad, disjointed mumbles that dissipate into the air, into the stale emptiness of whatever room they find themselves in. They go nowhere, do nothing. Help no one.
The plan was simple: take out the factory first then move up to the house. If the team hit the party first, there were workers down at the factory to destroy evidence. But if the factory went first, Crowley would be too busy with his guests to be warned about it, much less destroy any evidence. And even if he wasn’t busy enough, Cas would be there to keep him distracted.
"It's part of a deal," Castiel said, taking the cigarette back. He would not get his hopes up. Victor taught him where that could get him. "I'm tutoring him and he's spending time with me with his pants on."
Hannah nodded. “Back when Ana went through her descent, she not only traveled to hell.” She gulped. “She traveled through time.”
I’d already been grabbing some shifts at Bobby’s garage, but college and law school would cost a whole lot more than I could ever save from those few shifts, so I started working as much as possible and saved every little bit I could.
About a week before, he came over to cook dinner with me while Sam and Jess worked on their trig at the kitchen table.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Everyone does. But his daddy pays a lot of money to the school, so he doesn’t get in trouble for it.”
This weekend was all about Cas, about spending every possible second worshipping him with my mouth on his, my fingers on his skin, my name on his lips. But it wasn’t just about him, I realized, because I found myself crying out his name just as loudly, feeling his fingers dig in just as deeply, riding him to orgasm just as frantically.
The sobs, which Dean could now tell were coming from the closet, faltered. Dean looked to Benny, who simply shrugged.
“I’ll…” Dean says, dropping his hand from the doorframe. He doesn’t keel over, which is good. “Um. I’ll make some breakfast.”
Jack’s eyes are wide and bright, consumed by gold. There’s a wind starting to kick up out of nowhere, and Jack can’t seem to hear a thing they’re saying.
Dean’s only reaction, he’s a little proud to say, is to blink. And maybe to stiffen slightly, like he’s turning to stone.
Cas makes a noncommittal noise. “I doubt it will have any effect. It’s not a spell, it doesn’t have the ability to warp reality; it’s more of a suggestion. And she did say ‘marriage’ specifically, which doesn’t actually apply to us.”
He’s just turned away to walk back down the hall when he swears he hears a sound from inside his room.
no point. And abruptly, Dean decides that if Sam wants to know what happened, then he might as well know what fucking happened. Maybe then he’ll finally get it.
A slightly crackly groan of pain kneecaps the tilt-a-whirl of Dean’s thoughts, and his focus snaps back to the phone.
It doesn’t take long to get everything cleaned up, and Dean’s just hanging the towel up when he hears some clinking from the main room, glass on glass. He looks up and is caught off guard when he finds Sam already looking back at him, a pair of tumblers in one hand.
he’d confessed to Dean that long-ago day in the park. He still has them. And never are they stronger than when he’s in Dean’s presence.
“Say hi to Cas for me,” Sam needles, still looking like he’s expecting a Matchmaker of the Year award to pop up in front of him.
at Dean, still brings him coffee, still rambles about his weird niche interests, still lets Dean sit him down on the couch and show him whatever movie he decides Cas needs to see. But he never once questions the senseless unpredictability of this thing they’ve fallen into.
“Get out of him,” Dean chokes, strangled, and Lucifer shrugs off the trench coat, shutting the door behind him.
So… that’s what he decided he’d do, and so far it’s working out great. Cas liked the pie Dean made as much as he did last time, Sam was sufficiently distracted by the carbonara, and now they’ve split off on their own for a bit before reconvening in the den. ‘They’ being just Cas and Dean, though. Sam had said something about watching his stupid true crime shows instead, so he’ll probably retreat to his room for that.
Long story short, he should’ve died. Sam should already be back at the Bunker, drinking too much whiskey and being hugged by Eileen because he had to give his brother a hunter’s funeral and sprinkle his ashes in a lake or something. And Dean should be kicking back in Heaven right about now, sharing a beer with Bobby while they wait for Sam to live to ninety, have thirty grandkids, and die in his sleep. (Y’know, assuming Dean actually goes to Heaven. With Jack in charge, he’s pretty sure he will, but— well, he’ll probably make Heaven. Nepotism, baby.)
Angry tears skate down Sam’s cheeks. “Yeah,” he says into the phone, glaring at Dean. “Yeah, he’s— he’s giving up, he’s not fighting. Please, get here fast. Please.”
Cas does. Whitney crackles from the back seat as they pull out of the convenience store parking lot, and Sam notices Dean’s mouth twitch into a tiny, pleased smile, his eyes on the rearview mirror.
The whole nine yards, man. I want— I wanna take you on dates, and build you those planters you’ve been talkin’ about, and get annoyed ‘cause you leave your empty mugs all over my room, and…”
This betrayal has cut Dean deep. So deep that there’s a flash of white bone exposed to the air amid the blood welling from the cut, spilling out onto the floor in a growing pool of crimson. Castiel has cut him right down to the marrow with this, and he’s in
Dean takes his time slurping some water before he puts his cup down. “That’s funny,” he says, very calmly. “Because that’s not your fucking call to make.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Okay, got it. They’re on the endangered species list with the pandas, no shooting on sight. Send us the rest of what you’ve got?” he says to the phone, ignoring Cas as he disappears into the bedroom. There’s the soft sound of his towel hitting the floor, and Dean’s mouth goes dry. He clears his throat and fiddles with the phone.
Then Dean blinks, and that guy disappears. It’s his Cas sitting here, and the world hasn’t gone to shit, and he’s not that Dean. He’s never gonna let himself be that Dean.
Dean spares Charlie a quietly grateful look. “Thanks for taking care of him,” he says. “Seriously. I owe you.”
They sit there for a moment, staring up at the sky. It’s a smooth, cool mauve, darkening to indigo somewhere above their heads. Cas shifts. “I wouldn’t be opposed to trying it. Sam mentioned something about experimentation being good.”
on top of it. Which is stupid and useless; he got what he wanted, Dean doesn’t know why he’s still got his panties in a twist. Whatever, let him be angry. That’s his problem.
Eventually they get up and start back towards the cabin, Charlie looping her arm companionably through Dean’s. But Dean’s relatively good mood deteriorates the closer they get to the house, and he knows she notices. She doesn’t even have to say anything; she just looks at him furtively and frowns.
Cas hums. “Yes. I wanted to watch a movie, but I couldn’t find you. He seemed surprised you hadn’t asked me to join you.”
“Did you…” he starts, throat dry. He regrets breaking the silence as soon as he speaks, but the damage is done. “Did you put something in my coffee?”
gone. Sam had been worried he’d show up at the Bunker at some point, human and insufferable, but he never did. Maybe he’s dead in a ditch somewhere, maybe he’s bumming around a homeless shelter. Sam doesn’t know and he doesn’t care.
Cas had looked up at him, his eyes soft and blue and knowing. He hadn’t said the obvious; hadn’t said the three words Dean could see written all over his face.
When he reaches the bottom of the stairs he takes several unsteady, dreamlike steps across the scrubby grass in front of the cabin that bring him within touching distance of Cas. One hand drifts up in front of him, hovering a scant few inches from Cas’ coat, and the moment hangs in the air like a held breath.
That makes a soft, tender expression flit across Cas’ face, and Dean feels himself flush. But then his face closes off,  back into the grudging, secretive mask it was before. “You… you’ll think its foolish. I don’t… we don’t need to talk about this. We can throw the paper out. Just ignore it, you’re good at that.”
“Okay!” Dean shouts over a snarled curse from Sam. “Take a walk! Get some demon warding up outside, okay? It can’t hurt to be thorough.”
“Human,” Cas finishes. “It was the only way Jack could pull me from the Empty. He offered to restore my Grace after he had me back, but I…” He tips his chin up a little, daring Dean to comment. “I refused it.”
Trying not to let the scrutiny get to him, Dean cups his hand around the end of the joint and takes a slow drag. He lowers it again, waits one, two, three seconds, and then exhales, the smoke tumbling from his lips in a thick stream. He inspects the cherry, making sure it’s still burning evenly, and then holds the joint out to Cas. “There, like that. Don’t hold the smoke as long as I did.”
of pages turning through the speaker on his phone. “Yeah, like, ninety-nine percent. You’re pretty close to the river, and there’s a history of Russian and Ukrainian immigrants in the area. That plus the running taps the witnesses reported in the rooms is pretty good evidence. These things hang out near water, it just makes sense.”
Something in Cas’ expression cracks wide open, and he says five of the most incomprehensible words Dean’s ever heard.
Cas swallows audibly and shifts, his knee knocking into Dean’s under the blankets. “No,  I was… unprepared. I think— I think we should try again.”
Dean goggles at him. “So what, we’re just gonna go on a little vacation in the woods for six to eight weeks? You’re gonna sit around and play nursemaid?”
That’s what couples do, isn’t it? Go on dinner dates and hold hands and look into each other’s eyes?
starts piping into his ears. But the intro has barely finished when something smacks his shoulder. He jumps, looking up to see Dean lounging in the doorway of his room. Sam sighs and hits pause, chucking the balled-up sock back at his brother. “What?”
But at the same time… they’re teetering on the edge of something big. Dean can feel it. And he has no idea whether he should stumble back into familiar territory or say ‘fuck it’ and plunge into the unknown.
“Wow. That’s a better comeback than when the Cubs finally won the series again. You sure do have a way with words.”
So Sam sighs tightly, sparing one last look at Dean before holding out his hand to Cas for the keys.
But at this point, they all sort of run together. The apocalypses, that is. Like melting ice cream. Dean landmarks his memories by which Big Bad they were facing at the time, not so much by years. He can tell you that there was a night where he and Sam crashed at Bobby’s and watched Chuck Norris movies and bickered over licorice whips until they both passed out on the couch, and that it was pretty early on in the Lilith clusterfuck, or maybe even just before; when they were both still full of bravado and thought they could beat anything. But what month it was? What the big bold number at the top of the calendar was? He draws blanks, mostly.
is what the look Sam gives him says. (Eh. It was worth a try.) “I’ll call her. She said she wanted to see you, anyways. And just so you know, Charlie, Jody, Donna, Claire and Kaia, and Garth have already said they’re gonna be coming down to see you as soon as they start letting visitors in. Which is tomorrow. So, get ready for that.”
