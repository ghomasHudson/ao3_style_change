''Because I can't!''
''The Thiessen's themselves are okay. Mother and father only. The father is, likely, hiding an affair and I think that has something to do with their son, but I can't make sense of the details.''
But then she looks up, no trace of smile.
John's rapid intake of breath causes me to open my eyes. Causes the spell to break.
We are sitting at a little Chinese-Thai-Vietnamese hybrid restaurant. I'm looking over the menu for foods that won't make Sherlock deathly queasy. Our server - a little Vietnamese man of about 60 - comes to take our menu and our order about 10 minutes in.
''Yuri thinks I have an attachment disorder. He told me that he thinks so. Also, something called alexithymia. It's a disconnection in my mind between what I feel and what I can comprehend. Not knowing when I am hurting. Not understanding when I am, maybe, very, very sad.''
''Don't look at me, Sherlock. This is where you put whatever you want - and will eat, not just experiment on - into the cart.''
''If you can. If you are okay with that,'' I volley back when I realize he's still waiting for me to speak.
Until it's raging and loud.
I quirked an eyebrow.
''Is he using again, John?''
Realizing his nervousness hasn't departed as I had hoped for initially, I decided to bring him to an end state quickly.
Looking, oddly, like a baby owl that hasn't learned any of the pre-established tricks.
“Sherlock,” John tests.
''Maybe,'' he whispers.
"Let's get on with it, then."
So I sit outside Sherlock's room, my body crouched down by his door. My hands touching the wood of the frame. Wanting to touch his fingertips, and not this coldness, not this barrier between us.
He shakes his head back and forth in stubborn dismissal of my statement.
The mocking, derisive tone is strong.
''What's making this hard to hear right now?,'' I test carefully. Tailoring my voice to sound reasonable, normal.
''Makes it less...something,'' and his hands clench in frustration at not knowing how to describe his emotions. ''Be less tight inside, maybe.''
Polite, definitely. Maybe a little reserved. I can't let him think I'm this open book right now. I want the discussions of the last week to stop. Abruptly. And the only way they will is if I reign in my emotions. I can't have any more nightmares around him, I can't be acting so differently. If I feel oddly sad, I need to keep it together until I can deal with it on my own. John shouldn't have to concern himself with me more than he typically does. All that is going to do is stress him out, and he's already tried to be so loyal for me. He already works so hard at it. At being a good friend to me.
"Well, apart from the fact that I'm a medical doctor and have a degree in biochemistry, it also says so right on the bloody label," John snapped, holding it up. "I'm using it for its intended purpose, which is to treat minor topical injuries."
"Would you just give up?" Sherlock asked through the door.
What questions to ask first?
"Together," Sherlock said, and leaned up to kiss John.
Sherlock stopped suddenly and looked at John.
"Oh, not that again –"
“I just hope the weather holds,” I said. “It’s been nice weather so far this week. Shame if it were to rain on Friday.”
In answer, John leaned forward and swiped his thumb across Sherlock's upper lip, revealing foam had gathered there. Then, John popped the thumb in his mouth to lick it off.
Wiggins had been one of the first people to find out John was new at being homeless and tried to help him out a bit. Once he had found out that John used to be a doctor, he had enlisted his help in exchange for some tips on living rough. It had been a bit different, being homeless in London. John knew his survival techniques well enough, but those were for the wilds. Survival in an urban environment worked differently.
"Okay, good," John said. "I wasn't sure."
Before John could react, he escaped out the door to the bathroom. John chuckled again and picked up the handcuffs from the floor. Who knew something this good could come from Sherlock's mad experiments and a little bit of borrowing of police property?
“I'm John,” said John, reaching out a hand.
For once, Sherlock didn’t remotely care. The future he’d imagined himself since his first day at university had suddenly become infinitely brighter.
He wasn't even sure what that meant, or what he had been trying to say. Not that it much mattered, as John was unlikely to understand most of what he said.
"You don't honestly think that I believe that he can't speak normally?" Mycroft asked.
He only managed to shoot four of them before blood loss sent him spinning into blackness.
“John, I...” I said, trying to think of something to say. Uselessly.
He didn't ask for it, but sometimes he received it anyway.
John's fingers found the edge of Sherlock's shirt and pulled it up their ribcage. They felt goosebumps ripple up their stomach, and John's fingers on their skin. John made an inquiring sound against their mouth, tugging at the fabric bunched up around their middle.
John could hear the murmur of Lestrade's voice, but he knew it must be something good by the way Sherlock sat up on his elbows, eyes gleaming.
Wiggins was right, not much he could do for scratches without sterile bandages and something to clean the wounds out with. While he was passing through, he put a couple of people in the recovery position that had passed out.
"Let me guess, most of it was of a sexual nature?" Sherlock said, raising his eyebrows.
I made an annoyed sound in the back of my throat. “Mycroft.”
"I want you in me," Sherlock said, voice breathy with the tension. "Now."
..." Sherlock sobbed between heaving breaths.
"Oh, look at you," John said in admiring tones. "Look at all this. I'm so lucky."
The two of them struggled against one another until John succeeded in pulling the shirt aside again.
"I hope everything's in order, then?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock finally managed to stand on wobbly legs and shuffle towards the bathroom.
John relaxed in the warmth of Sherlock's arms and listened to Sherlock's steady heart beating against his ear. He could hardly believe he and this incredible person were still learning new things about one another.
“You can’t take the book from me,” John said, holding the book close to his chest.
"Stop! Stop!" he begged.
He cleared his throat and straightened his clothes again, although they didn’t need it. He shuffled his feet once and went to knock.
C) Stay awake all night thinking about the case
"Careful," Lestrade said. "This place is probably going to fall apart. Fire did a good job of wiping out evidence.
"And Sherlock said he didn't want you," John replied. "I'll give you a warning right now. Sherlock Holmes is not to be trifled with. Leave now, and you won't get hurt."
Sherlock made another muffled noise and glared. John rolled his eyes, stepped forward and untied the makeshift gag from around Sherlock's mouth.
John shucked his jeans and pants in one go, and Sherlock’s eyes widened as he finally set eyes on John's cock. It was... very impressive. Sherlock’s mouth watered suddenly in a visceral reaction upon seeing it. John quickly rolled the condom on, slicked himself with lube, and positioned himself between Sherlock’s legs.
"That's not a 'Never have I ever' question," Sherlock protested.
"You did well, Sherlock," John said, and Sherlock flushed.
"I think your friend Lestrade might have something to say about letting a homeless man and a dog wander around your crime scene," John finally said.
John was a genius, in his own understated way. It wasn't a way in which he would win a Nobel prize or become internationally recognized, but John Watson was definitely top in his field. And that was the field of understanding and caring for one Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.
The silly other alpha wouldn't leave, and so Sherlock decided that the idiot deserved what he got. John was going to come and take care of it for him.
Sherlock trembled and pulled him back in so that he could forget the world all over again. John grinned against his mouth, and Sherlock embedded the feel of it in his Mind Palace. They kissed for ages, and by the time Sherlock drew away, his chest was heaving and his mouth was tender.
The two of them stared at each other tentatively. Sherlock still wasn't processing the information. Was "darling" something romantic, or could that still be seen as platonic? Sherlock wished he had his (or John's) laptop to look it up, but he couldn't even move. John was still flushed up to his ears, and Sherlock felt rather hot in the face himself.
Sherlock let out a frustrated huff and handed John the matchbox. John took it and frowned, turning it over in his fingers. Sherlock sighed and picked up another matchbox, opening it. John opened his mouth to protest, but Sherlock raised a finger to stop him. Sherlock opened another and another, leaving them all opened up in a line. Then, he took the one John was holding, the one that had started this strange Shakespearean twist on his life.
John turned in surprise to find Sherlock wearing what was obviously supposed to be a sexy army costume. He had on the tiniest pair of what John could only think to describe as "booty shorts" in a camo pattern and the sleekest, tall black boots, highlighting the length of his legs. The sleeveless muscle shirt he was wearing was so skintight and thin that John could see his peaked nipples through the material.
“John,” he said softly. “This is wonderful, what you’ve done. And you did it all for me, I can hardly believe you thought I was worth the effort. But - but I - “
"Does it also make them glow?" John asked.
"I could kiss you for ages," John said, voice dazed.
"Yes, okay," John said, stirring his tea.
What to do?
Sherlock let this all out in one breath. Then realized that he’d gone and done what he always did: spewed out someone’s life story when they hadn’t asked him to.
"I want..." John said, trailing off. "I want."
To be fair, anyplace was a good spot when one didn't have a home. John settled down on a bench to eat the wrapped sandwich someone had given him. It didn't happen very often, but it did happen. There were kind strangers out there, however few and far between.
"Ah, not yet," John said. "You still haven't convinced me."
Then, the man smiled like a maniac, and just like that, John was charmed.
It was.
“What?” John repeated Sherlock’s inner query. He turned to Sherlock. “Isn’t that the guy who’s in the mental hospital?”
likes me long-term. It just doesn’t happen. Everyone finds
They stared into the mirror in growing despair, because no matter how they tried to fix it, they only made it worse.
“Do you often dream of it?” asked John, softly.
"Not enough from the crime scenes to pin it on him, or really suspect it's him, except that we think we know that he's the one behind the credit card fraud," Lestrade said. "So this year, we're going to get him. We've been following his movements –"
“So what now, then?” asked John, leaning on his sword.
And then John's finger brushed over that spot inside him that had him arching up off the bed again, clutching at the sheets with clenched fists.
Sherlock hurriedly started undoing his buttons, pink already rising to his cheeks as he kept glancing up at John before lowering his head to concentrate on his task. He always responded like that when John used his captain voice. But then again, no one disobeyed John when he used that tone of voice, because if they did...
Sherlock had handcuffed himself to the metal bedframe by looping the chain through one of the rungs, and now his hands were strung up above his head. His positioning kept him from moving around too much. John looked around the room and located the key first, although he couldn't help but notice that there was an untwisted paperclip on the bed as well.
"Yes, actually. Doctor, remember?" John said.
"I didn't want anyone to know," Sherlock said. "It seemed so... personal."
John leaned over and kissed him, once, softly.
John had lots of things he still wanted to try out. He had a feather that he wanted to tease Sherlock with for hours. He had the strands of a leather flogger he wanted to draw over Sherlock's back and over the curve of his arse. He wasn't finished with this game by a long shot.
Mine emerge in dreams.
His house was pretty far away from central London, and Sherlock decided then that he needed John to help him get a taxi for this one. Which meant he would have to wait for John to get home. How irritating.
"How did he last this long to begin with?" Lestrade asked, grunting as he got a shoulder underneath the man's arm. "He's been down here longer than three days. There's no water down here."
"They don't actually change colour," Sherlock said quickly. "It's actually a mutation of my iris called heterochromia, which makes – "
There was always experimenting with something that absolutely reeked, so that when she came over, the flat would smell intolerable. No, again, John would be annoyed, even if he didn’t realize what Sherlock was up to.
John came over and grinned, reaching up to tug on one stray curl.
I finally begin to cry.
''Sherlock, I didn't-''
'No, he's not.'
''Look, I know he cares about this kid - and that's a good thing - but he can't be acting like-''
The room is quiet, and I gulp away my bitterness. My bitterness is swapping places with fear. Being rapidly replaced by fear, actually. And a sense of doom and loss, and in this moment I feel the truth of it all. I sense that not only was I a horrid brother who couldn't save his sister, but I was also the useless son who couldn't save his mother, nor his father. And now...
I realize the co-dependent lock the two of them are in: John, so used to taking responsibility for everything and everyone I suspect, and Sherlock - quick to dismiss himself from responsibility for very much.
But I curl up and cry against the spray and I stay that way for...awhile.
I move over a few inches on the bench.
I pick up my belongings, and angrily follow him inside.
But I have come to learn that what he says, and the deeper motivations for why he does what he does - very rarely line up.
He also looks ready to cry.
''A break?,'' I repeat, for confirmation.
I apply a thin layer of shaving foam to my neck and jawline, then deftly feel about with my fingertips once more before swiping the razor blade over my facial skin until the slight gritty edge of new hair growth is cut away and the skin feels hairless once more. As luck would have it, my body hair is relatively sparse and fine and doesn't seem to grow in very quickly at all. In fact, I could probably get away without a daily shave and have no one be the wiser. The bigger issue, for me, is one of tactile defensiveness. I dislike the sandpapery quality of my skin when the hair grows in. It distracts me to such a degree that I am typically highly attentive to my personal hygiene.
But I rarely do.
Perhaps the memory of those past experiences will be enough to console him. Enough to remind him of moments when he was healthier, and seemingly happier, than he is currently.
The fact that I've just woken up from sleeping not even a mere half hour ago goes unmentioned by both of us.
''It's not about being 'bad'. It's about what might reduce your stress well enough that you're able to get through the next while without feeling so conflicted. So you can deal with treatment, and everything that entails,'' and I debate saying more. Decide that if I expect bravery from Sherlock, I likewise need to show bravery myself. It's only fair.
''I know you have, so please don't deny it. We are beyond that. I need to know what triggered this.''
Most people - if they did not have true compassion or respect for Sherlock - would have undoubtedly left the flat by now. Looked for a place to live elsewhere. Because, obviously, Sherlock is going through hell. But equally obvious is the fact that John is sticking by him and isn't about to walk away any time soon.
''The father, as would be my guess, was having an affair with the tutor. Whether or not Mrs. Thiesen was aware of this, I don't know, but Toby knew enough of it, and probably felt good ole' dad would be a bust, too, so that only leaves one person he could have confided in-''
------------------------------------------
I feel my stomach twist into knots.
''Aren't you tired? Don't you want to stop feeling like this?,'' I plead.
My jaw clenches in reserve. I've already exposed too much of my emotional state.
But I don't want to listen to reason anymore, either. To common sense.
''I am thirsty,'' and he turns to his side, tucking his knees up until his body seems even further compressed. ''Is Lestrade upset?,'' he asks quickly in a rapid departure from our previous discussion.
I stop talking abruptly. John looks dangerously aggressive.
''Okay. You hold onto Hedwig, and I'll call Greg and everything will be okay. Everything is going to be okay.''
And the word, too – the word called recovery. As if I could just get better from a state so different and unlike that of having pneumonia or influenza.
''Removed from what?,'' I test a few pauses later.
I close my eyes, tightly.
''You've been cutting yourself, Sherlock!,'' I exclaim at last, beyond frustrated.
Yet I can only choose one option here. And while we will undoubtedly have to discuss the enormity (or potential enormity) of what he's revealed today (and what is that, really? That he's attracted to me? And in what way? Sexually? And if not sexually, why would he kiss me?), the primary question I need to ask myself right now is: what is best for Sherlock?
I pull back against my chair. Feel the leather ridges. The little nubs of buttons digging into my legs. Funny how I couldn't perceive them before.
Sherlock is re-affixing his scarf when Molly wades back into the room with a jug of cream for tea complete with a plate of chocolate orange Hobnob biscuits.
''Look, it's none of my business. I get it. But I know your partner is going to be okay.''
''Not really - or not at all?!''
Toby turns away from us slightly, and lets out a barking cough, congested with tears. He knows what he's just revealed, and the force and impact of what he's just admitted to is probably starting to hit him now. Sally moves closer and crouches down by his bed.
Or maybe it has nothing to do with the profession. Maybe I'm not thinking about this logically enough.
And because it fit. It described what I was feeling, paradoxically, in my lack of feeling.
''You've taken things out of here,'' he says softly, not angry, but certainly not happy. He closes his eyes, seemingly aware as to what I've done. ''John,'' he whispers, ''you don't need to do this.''
My mouth and brain are screaming at me to stay quiet. To stay quiet, and deny. To avoid.
His eyes are hostile and something breaks apart in my heart.
Additionally, his silhouette is further bulked up by what looks to be a hand-knit toque. In some ways, he reminds me of a little kid whose been overdressed by a mother on the first chilly day of autumn.
''It might help,'' I say encouragingly.
But they never do.
My friend pulls back, suddenly looking pained.
I lather up my hair, and apply extra shaving foam to my skin, holding back the impulse to shave over the cleansed skin until it stings and peals with blood. If I do that - and I have before - it's going to sting, and that's going to be a relief - but then it's going to scab, and I'll just have the impulse to rip the scabs off, and it's all going to get very messy, very fast. But I do shave three times regardless, just to grab any errant hairs that have decided to bypass the razor.
He's ashamed for some reason. But I cannot ascertain what reason he would have to be ashamed.
So many lines. They feel cooler than the surrounding skin, and for a second I cannot understand what this crisscrossing of glossy skin is, until I realize that what my fingers are coursing over are a multitude of scars. Some scarcely more than several millimeters in diameter. Some far thicker.
And somehow that's even worse. Because I can see his spine. I can see the bruising around the vertebrae. As if he's done thousands upon thousands of crunches, and the skin has worn off, bled, crusted over, scarred, worn off again. The area around the scarring is pink. If he had flogged himself, he couldn't have caused much more scarring.
''Something going on?,'' he queries after a few seconds.
The look in his eyes, the horror-
He tries to sit up and let's out a cry of pain. I rush to his side.
Look back down to the tiny smudged reminders of other childhoods being lived out in real time.
The psychiatrist holds out a hand for the folder, and Sherlock hurriedly hands back the photographs.
He doesn't comment on that. Typically, he'd say something patronizing. How he - at three - was light years above the level of an infant.
''I didn't want you to...not want to be my friend.''
Suddenly, I feel a surge of protectiveness and faint affection bloom in my core. I push it away and focus on his breathing, instead.
I pick up a paper weight. Something else. I want to throw both.
I pull my arm back from his grasp and fold it over stomach, suddenly aware that my belly is hurting.
''It's okay,'' I whisper, ''It's going to be okay.''
It's early December and the air nips at my nose and my lungs when I inhale too quickly, so I cover my mouth with my hand.
I cart up the groceries and deposit everything onto the main counter, which is conspicuously free of any manner of current experiments.
He had collapsed on his school track. The doctors at the clinic he had been taken to determined that he had micro-fractures in both legs and yet, he had continued to jog on broken legs. Eventually, he had to stop running due to severe pain and bone shard fragments that had lead to sudden swelling and immobilization in his legs.
It's a human sort of frailty. To forget the longest stretch ahead for a reprieve in the moment.
I stare at it, not comprehending.
''Good thing you came here then. You could have passed out in the street.''
Is that what we are going to do?
''Sorry,'' I whisper, feeling his shame as if it's my own now.
He must know what I mean.
''Only for a bit, love. Sherlock won't like too many people around all at once. You know how he is.''
''Go and get Bisquick. You cannot leave him chained to the fence.''
He rubs at his legs again. At this rate, I am surprised he hasn't taken the skin off portions of his body.
Just as I am contemplating my own anger and the fact that none of it is really caused by Sherlock - that what I want is to lash out at the people who have hurt him, hurt him so fucking horribly...
Yet on this case, he seems to be uncertain.
And what had his mother told me, offhandedly one time?
"It's only been...what? Four or five hours?"
''I didn't do anything,'' Sherlock stresses, face contorted earnestly. ''You don't have to check me,'' and the emptying of his throat sounds painful. ''I just-''
Picking up his jacket, he looks back over at me and adds, ''I don't really need to know you that well, Sherlock, to know that you need help. And if I can see it, do you really think your friends or family can't see it? That John can't see it? You say he is your friend. Is it fair to put him or anyone else through stress just because you don't want to face your problems?''
Even if he could have spoken, the words would have become garbled. He would have wanted to lay down. He would have closed his eyes. His skin would have become cold and he might have felt cold internally, too, and all the layered clothing in the world wouldn't have helped him feel any warmer.
As always, reviews are love. If you'd like to receive a definite response from yours truly to your review, then please leave your review over at Archive of Our Own (same author's name, Kourion, and of course same story name). It is *much* easier for me to respond that way! I rarely log into Fanfiction Dot Net any longer (except to add a new chapter, of course). However, if you leave a response here then please know it is well received and appreciated too. :)
''I"m confused about what I feel for you, John. The totality of what I feel.''
The words sound wooden and practiced. My guess is that Sherlock has mentally generated dozens of psychobabble catch phrases that he plans on using on me.
"Until public school. I stayed in a dormitory, so it stopped then. For the most part."
Yet, they hinted at something based on current developments, too, as Sherlock was still marginally underweight. Even in those dreams.
John's frown lines deepen. Because it's a half truth, at best.
Once inside my suite, I didn't pour coffee. Or tea.
The elder man now brushes an invisible dust particle from his jacket and taps his umbrella against the lino.
''And do you want to know what the craziest thing about this is?,'' he mutters to the table, now that Molly is safely back in the kitchen, the can opener whirring in the distance. ''I'm actually hungry. I'm hungry, John.''
His words are posed as statements, not questions, and yet I can hear nothing but an eternal question being raised.
''Well, I'll be out of your hair before anyone calls. Promise.''
I'm being ridiculous.
Sherlock had been working a petty crime case that he said had some ''intriguing dynamics,'' and for that - the preceding week I had ignored him in anger.
But before I could warn him of Biquick's feisty nature, he had bent down and turned his palm upwards, as if for Biquick's inspection - than Bisquick snapped at him.
I loosen my grip, scared of holding him down, but also scared to release him when he seems so out of control, lest he runs away.
--------------------
''Can you please stay?,'' and the words come out in a broken laugh, because I'm so tired of what's been happening lately. Sherlock - revealing more and more, exposing more and more of himself - even without meaning to - and the layers are like layers of something fetid. Something that has started to rot. And my biggest concern is that I'm going to get to see all the way down to the core, and there won't be anything I can work with. Nothing I can salvage for him.
''Your heart is beating incredibly quickly. Too quickly.''
Donovan's mouth screws up.
''He's probably going to...,'' and I trial off, not even certain what I was about to say, so I look at the flowers sadly, my fingertips touching one glossy petal with care. ''These are beautiful. Thank you.''
Is that what this is?
And from what?  I don't even know. If pressed, I wouldn't be able to explain the fear, the revulsion. Not for everyone else, but for myself. For the expectations that I should be partaking in things, in events, in ways of being - with others - that I have no interest in.
He wrapped his arms over my chest. Pulled me into a tight hug.
I cannot stand to see that look in his eyes: as if I am some pathetic, mewling kitten who has been beaten and left bleeding on the side of the street. An animal that needs to be coaxed back to safety, and spoken to with gentle words and gentle touches for fear that it may bite or claw or otherwise attack anyone who comes near.
His jaw clenches and I realize I may have inadvertently insulted him.
''But you are trying so hard-''
Sherlock studies me silently, then rises from his little blanket cocoon on the couch and trots up the stairs back to his room.
'I am sorry.'
He needs to know that he's not alone.
''What?''
The assortment makes me feel warmer. And I want to feel warmer.
I frown at the floor and she gestures to her arms.
''Ok. Alright then,'' Lestrade says, ''Toby was asking for you. Is asking, I guess.''
So John leaves, his brows creased in worry and for a second or two I simply stare at the mirror. Just stare, and imagine what it would feel like to have everything stop. The hunger, the fullness, the guilt, the fear.
My head feels cotton batton-y with his words. As if he's speaking to me through a mental wool filter, and the words are distorted and jumbled.
If I simply hadn’t opened my mouth to begin with I wouldn’t have to do any of these exercises right now.
You are not remotely in need of weight gain, but you have to get your potassium levels up.
Mycroft's voice. Younger, and less deliberate. Less accustomed to precision and put-upon solemnity and devoid of his current smarmy, too-aware-of-himself nature.
''Are you cold?,'' I test, my throat swollen.
''You can borrow a pair, if you'd prefer.''
''Is this an emergency? You sound a little anxious. Are you in an okay place right now?''
I realize I feel gritty, sour. My teeth feel fuzzy. I may not be as badly off as Sherlock, but these last few months have been getting progressively worse for me, too.
John suddenly stands up. He looks tense.
I shake John's hand first, then turn and give Sherlock a short, gut genuine smile offering my hand.
Sherlock's breath comes out in a rattle, and he bats at his eyes. Mycroft checks his fob watch and lets out an almost imperceptible sigh.
''Do you want to watch a movie?''
Necrotic tissue, they said.
call healthy behaviour? healthy thoughts?
Neither of us holding back any longer.
For chrissakes, this is ridiculous.
I look away in shame. I make a sound. Or the sound plays me, like a bow running over a violin string. It comes out of my mouth, like I wanted to do when I was a little boy. It's a screeching sound. I think there is a 'no' in there somewhere.
He looks dead.
He still doesn't respond, though. Just continues to breathe that harsh, wheezing breath with that painfully confused look on his face.
And perhaps I should tone it down.
I decide to test the waters with terms that are a little more precise.
I should not say, ''But Harriet was older.''
Did I honestly think that was something that I could have ever had in any time-line?
Sherlock turned, arms holding onto three different hangers.
John opens his mouth, and I hear some blended consonants, then: ''you were having a night terror, I think.''
''Yes. I promise. I will do my very best and I will let them know that you love them too.''
''Sherlock,'' and John grabs the lapels of my robe. ''Sherlock, be quiet. Stop thinking like this. Stop thinking bad things about yourself. About how no one could care enough about you to stay in your life. I'm not leaving.''
His smile is terse, tight, as he pours out several ounces for himself. When he doesn't speak for a few moments, I start to get antsy.
You assume that a couple pounds lost could be due to emotional things. Such as the case. The stress of the case we had been on at the time, so different to every other case that we had ever taken previously.
little words, raised eyebrows. mycroft, and his steady inquiries.
''That would be worse, wouldn't it? To not want someone. To just feel that way?''
I feel a slow-churning anxiety bloom up in my chest.
Just once. Just one time, so I could just trap the sound into my head and pull it out when I was really sad.
''When I came in here earlier tonight, I was so angry. But I couldn't determine who I was angry at, or how I could make that feeling go away.''
He obviously felt an urgent need to wake me.
The closest thing he could have to someone who could order him about, or at least make him feel pressured to change his ways, would be a family member (though I am uncertain how close he is to anyone in his family) or a friend. Which he seems to be sorely lacking, John Watson aside. The legitimate concerns from people who care about him purely out of love and for no ulterior motive. Not because they are interested in what his mind can offer, nor ultimately wanting to yield something from his talents for their own benefit.
I see his small throat swallow reflexively, his hands - one in a sling - tense and release in fear.
I feel Sherlock's throat bulge against my shoulder.
In fact, this is the thinnest I've seen him yet. Even besting his adolescence and his hospitalization at 14.
''I don't want you to feel scared anymore, Sherlock. Neither does Yuri. He's certainly not furious with you. I give you my word that he's not.''
Eventually his eyes focus on me, blink, and I hear him clear his throat.
He came to see me shortly after his 14th birthday. In retrospect, I am shocked that he lasted that long before his parents sought out clinical care.
"Food?," he clarifies.
Everything is not fine.
My strange, aspergerish flatmate. Who talked to a skull up until he met me simply because he really didn't have a friend.
''Will you really eat them?''
My insane flat mate and best friend actually kissed me. On the mouth.
In stolen moments and periods when I could interact with him alone. When father was out of the house, and when mother was resting.
I don't know where this mood is coming from - this sudden apathy.
“Stop it,” he implores. “Please stop. Please just listen.”
I mean - it's Sherlock. I know what he's like. I know that half the stuff that comes out of his mouth is bullshit. Not the accuracy of his comments - but the tone, the irritation.
He sounds perilously close to tears.
I let my hand rest there, stunned, and take in the shape of his stomach. Can feel the edge of hipbone sluice through tissue. Let my fingertips touch the hipbone. I can feel the vast difference in width between the bottom of his cored out stomach and the highest peak of bone at the top.
''I can try. Though I know what's going to happen when I'm done with it all. I know what it's going to be like. What it's going to feel like. For me.''
''I'm not explaining this well at all, am I?,'' I ask abruptly.
Believing he had turned into a ghost.
He's not pausing for breath. His words are racing together, tangling together.
''Actually...will you stay? At least, for awhile?''
''It's been a pretty rotten case. And it's gotten worse over time hasn't it?,'' I question with as much stability as I can muster.
-----------------------------------
I shut my eyes, effectively trying to cut Sherlock off from realizing what I've just realized myself. What I've just admitted to myself.
Reframing my question as an inverse of his question is another thing he’s been doing a lot lately, and it makes me want to scream. I can feel my breath coming in staccato bursts.
The cat tilts his head, and takes a step closer to me. A moment later he sniffs my hand, then licks my fingertips.
''Perhaps it would make things easier diagnostically. However, I don't believe that life itself would be easier if things were black and white. I think it would make certain situations more haunting, in their immobility. In their fixed nature. There would be less of a chance of fixing the hurtful things. In reducing our pain, perhaps.''
He literally feels like ice. But he's not just cold to the touch. If anything, the coldness increases the longer I hold his hand, and the knowledge that his suffering is self-caused, self-generated, makes me as equally tormented as it does exasperated.
I am filled with self disgust.
Sherlock suddenly looks pained. His eyes shift swiftly to the left and harden.
''Now, let's say a couple more months go by - and Molly loses weight. Far too much. Would you consider her potentially suicidal based on this alone?''
Some sort of crap show, the volume almost uncomfortably loud.
Because I am not so far gone as to dismantle a safety razor and slash at my face.
''No? It would explain your weight loss.''
''Don't say what? That we love you? That I do?''
''Stop that,'' John says sternly, and a moment later I feel warm fingertips encircle my numb ones and pull against my digits. Pull my hands away from my throat and back towards my lap.
Toby brings his casted arm up over his face and turns into his pillow, as if to block us from his sight.
''Maybe a couple pounds. I fail to see what that has to do with-''
''Maul other students that come too near, unaware of his temper?,'' the violinist responded tartly. ''Do you really feel that's the best course of action?''
Everyone was miserable and haunted by the case. Lestrade, Sally, Anderson, myself.
"Anything else?," she asks, her voice fainter than before.
Just because nothing was physically wrong with you doesn't mean everything was okay.
Sherlock's eyes moved from mine and back to the drawing.
''Okay, you don't have to tell me any more,'' I relent, my hand trailing to the nape of his neck. Eventually he starts to calm under the rhythmic motion of my hand. ''You've done really well, Sherlock.''
"I know, Sherlock," he gets out about 10 seconds later. His voice sounds sore.
Sherlock had looked over the photos of the children - their little bodies placed as if in repose.
Sherlock's face flushes.
John winces.
My stomach growls, betraying me, and I fight the urge to lick my lips.
John's breath seems to catch in his throat. Just for a second.
And so I have no right to complain about the changes for which I alone am responsible for generating.
And quiet.
Because I never went to church as a child (and certainly never when older), and I never believed in God. Beyond that the memory is old and stale, too. I can sense as much. But I can't place it, and as such I cannot organize it, nor attach any context or date or importance to the clip.
Before Patrick leaves – freshly shaven and smelling like mint – he ambles back into our shared work/ TV room.
How can he be as grubby as he is, in those ridiculous clothes and sleep encrusted eyes, and be - somehow - even more adorable than normal?
''Sherlock, is what I've told you making you afraid?''
Of course - calling Sherlock anything other than Sherlock, might just make everything all the more surreal.
Where once there had been brilliant hazel eyes, the colour of root beer, now there was nothing.
''Okay,'' he allows. ''Are you staying?''
and the realization that this is it?
Because I had a violin tutor when I was small. And my tutor very likely saved my life. He was the only adult I really trusted. He was warm, and he was kind.
''Let me help you,'' John says resolutely, repeating his earlier words as he puts the cup directly into my hands.
I close my eyes and feel the start of tremors assail my body.
''But you did things with him that you admitted you didn't like. Didn't feel comfortable doing. Why?''
He bites his lip, but says nothing.
Sherlock continues to watch me, his eyes intense.
''What concerns John about your eating?,'' I specify.
CANT-SPEAK
Studying Sherlock - and reading him accurately - has never been my strength. The man can act with finesse and skill. I like to think I know him. But what I know of him, I learn after the fact. After a blow up, after an outburst, after a display of ill-tempered emotionality. I don't learn anything without his expressed allowance.
I swallow. Nod.
Sherlock's expression goes from earnest pleading, to a recoil so intense he almost falls over.
''Do you think for one second that Mycroft is to blame for your problems?,'' I probe further, exhausted with everything, and especially exhausted with Sherlock hurting himself.
“Do you remember returning to your body?”
He's hard to gauge. And yet, I remind myself, he offered to teach me how to play this game.
"Jesus Christ," and John's voice comes out in such a way that I doubt he meant to speak at all. In fact, if pallor was determined by octaves, by notes - he would be several notes paler right now. "Can I please sit down?," he questions, but it's obviously rhetorical because he's already moving to sit down besides me.
Yuri's expression has changed to one of tempered empathy.
-------------------------
It's as honest as I'm going to get. I hope the admittance is enough to help turn the tide of inquisition.
Predatory.
''Hedw'g,'' he squeaks, pointing to his owl doll, and I reach down deftly, snatching up the grey and foul item and bringing it towards Toby's hands.
He leans sideways into the frame of the bed, suddenly looking exhausted. When he speaks again, his voice is muffled.
''Please go away,'' I bite out.
"Is there something Mycroft could have told me, about you not waking easily - that would cause me to be concerned?"
''Yes?,'' and the word is clipped.
''Of course,'' I say, with shut eyes and a breath held in my lungs far longer than should be held. ''It's just...him. Sherlock being Sherlock. I can deal with him. He might be sick, but he's still my best friend.''
And we are back to Sherlock's POV.
''Umm. Good. It was fine. It was good.''
I can feel his heart pounding against my frame, leaping from his chest, and I hold onto him with greater force.
''He would have told me if he had been purging. I really think he would have.''
''Have you ever considered becoming a psychologist?''
I squinted up at him, the water had blanketed my dark hair into a carpet-like fringe over my eyes. I pushed at it, and let the water cascade down my throat.
He licks his lips again. Lets his hands gloss over his abdomen, before they come up to touch the ridges of his prominent hipbones.
----------------------------------------
Sherlock's hands flex against my own, pressing in. His face is screwed up, and his breathing quickens, more so.
''Rationalize the abuse?,'' I clarify, my voice almost as constricted.
''I'm not bringing anyone else into this, John! It's none of Lestrade's business! He can take me off this case, for all I care.'
''I am trusting you, Sherlock,'' he pants, sounding scared. And isn't that what he said he was? Scared? ''Don't go into the kitchen. Don't do anything rash. Just stay in here. Stay in here and calm down.''
“Oh, if it makes you all that happy,” I drawl, trying to hide my jitters. I want to get back on even footing. I want to feel that calmer presence of mind. When I acted for a case, and didn’t think about all this emotional refuse. This fetid and aggressive inner voice was always much quieter when I worked on cases.
He takes a step back, his face twisted into an expression that doesn't bely anger, nor pain. But something else.
Needing to be able to help him, if this is what is happening again.
''Thought it was just in my head,'' he says quietly. ''I didn't want anything in my stomach. Not ever.''
I stop, and consider his words.
"They were the doors from our childhood nursery," he explains, calmly, his line of sight matching up with my own.
"What did you do?"
''Sherlock-,'' he starts, wanting me - I know - to eat something, and not knowing how to address the subject with any force. Especially since I've just done one large thing that he's wanted me to do for days now.
He keeps his face hidden but his fingers spasm against my touch as if he’s pulsing with energy.
I can calm a person whose been shot, sure. I can help set a bone, or get a soldier through the pain of re-popping in a dislocated shoulder. I can even deal with screaming and tears and excessive displays of pain when the pain is physical... But I'm not used to pain of this nature. And it is of a different nature. It seems less clinical, harder to name, harder to speak about. Harder to think about. It shouldn't be. The stigma of if partly lies in the fact that no one even wants to comprehend that such events occur.
My anger edging towards something cruel.
“You must be Sherlock,” she responds primly: kind, but not ingratiatingly so.
The amount of self-hatred he must have felt. The amount of self-revulsion...
Oh, I see.
Sherlock smiles.
'Where is he?!' I text back.
''Sherlock! It's almost noon! You have your appointment with Yuri this afternoon!''
Instead, he closes his eyes, and speaks.
Some faint trill. Some faint catch that isn't deception and isn't anger and isn't Sherlock just dealing with This.
There is a clouded, choked quality that also indicates that he's been trying to restrain his need to cry. He rarely cries, but to a keen ear the need to cry can be heard. And I can hear it now.
I splay my hands out in front of me, thinking of a way of putting my thoughts into something vocally cohesive.
''Like what?''
''We were forced to perform a partial gastrectomy,'' Dr. Riley says resignedly. ''So he'll have to stay here a few days.''
-----------------------
''Can I see him?,'' I ask miserably, bringing fists up to my eyes to wipe away errant moisture.
''He's going to be furious with me,'' he hisses at last, looking up at me with an undeniable vulnerability.
Mycroft just stands up stiffly, looking back and forth between me and his younger brother.
''It will never end!,'' I bellow out, angry and frustrated and ashamed.
When everything is awful and gorgeous and scary and beautiful and alive and dead...all at the same time.
I turn back to him too quickly, and the room spins slightly.
''You asked, or-''
And in that moment I had a tremendous urge to kiss him.
''Sherlock...I wouldn't have traded positions with Harriet.''
''Did he used to be sloppy with his hygiene?,'' I ask, suddenly concerned.
''Yes,'' and the nurse, to her credit, doesn't take my tone personally. ''But as soon as he is out, we will inform you.''
(Of course he can see you, you idiot. He can see you now).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I feel confused. What is John saying? Really?
I blink against the retort. Tell myself that he's overwhelmed, but not actually rejecting me. That I have to be strong for him. That's what matters most of all right now.
INTERLUDE
I glance down at my hands. Pale, nail-chewed tufts with blooming blood that have hardened into red lines a centimeter away from white-moon beds. They are ugly nails and ugly hands. Veiny and thin and taunting. I hate my hands for being me, and love my hands for being starved and cold, because that took work.
"When did it start, Sherlock?"
Knowing that if I do not respond, John will think the worst. With his army training, and his nerves frayed, he might also do something stupid. Like break down the door.
John's fingers have encased both my wrists. I am locked in by his human handcuffs, and for that I feel reasonably safe.
So I tried.
I stare at Pascal, but don't answer.
''I can't do that!,'' I pant, grabbing his arms and pulling him towards my torso. ''Just stop. Stop it, Sherlock. Please. ''
''If I 'accidentally' dropped this mug, do you think the world would be better for it?''
Yuri gives me a hard look, unyielding. Not unkind, but too-knowing.
''I didn't know that,'' I whisper. Because all I can do is whisper right now. My throat is too tight for anything else. ''Does Mycroft know that was your fear?''
''And I did not need to be watched while I took a bath to cleanse the urine off - like a toddler,'' and he's looking at me again, his body now propped upright. High spots of colour, of infused pink, swim along his cheekbones. ''Why did you stay with me? I wanted to be alone. Anyone would have wanted to have been alone.''
Now, as I ascend the stairs and wander back to Sherlock's bedroom, I am aware of everything. How my knees pop when I move after having been completely immobile for hours. How the wood groans under my body as I move. How the door hinges most definitely need more WD-40.
I shut my eyes, worried at what harm Sherlock may have inadvertently caused.
''Well I think it is! I damn well know it is, because his past is shooting the present to hell and interfering with my job!''
When others could cry, and knew they felt alone or sad or despondent or rejected?
When I look down at my hands, I study the ridged nodes along my knuckles, the prominent veins, the pallor. The shame is back. A dark demon with its claws gripping around my ribcage is taking away my breath and squeezing against my heart. I pull away from him, and resist the urge to press against my eyes. The heat is back, prickling my retinas.
Sherlock crosses his arms over his frame now. A classic defensive maneuver. One I'm sure he's quite aware of normally but which has presently escaped his notice.
''So you're worried that - what? You have difficulty understanding who you are? Without those experiences? Without the feeling of hunger?''
''We need an angle, a way in,'' Donovan clarifies, ''unless you want us to accuse a man of having an affair when we have absolutely no proof whatsoever. Which, after your actions, will make us look like the most incompetent team ever - especially if you are wrong yet again.''
''Since this case, yes.''
"Don't make this harder than it has to be. You know what I'm referring to!"
He's not going to judge me.
Molly never disappoints with her whimsy. It's as strong a feature of her personality as Sherlock's eccentricity is a feature of his own.
Yuri smiles.
I continue to read and learn that pairing an Ensure with a solid meal is likely not a good idea (the site discourages the consumption of liquids and solids at the same time, and recommends waiting 1/2 hour after finishing a solid meal before drinking anything, even water).
Weeks of repressed misery play across his face.
Two days later, I'm on my way back to the clinic. I haven't visited him in all that time. The reason why is...tricky. I feel somewhat angry with him, but more than that - I feel hurt. I feel hurt that after all my attempts to make him feel like he could trust me, that I would never hurt him or criticize him for struggling with whatever he is obviously struggling with...that he'd still inflict harm on himself.
Sherlock nodded.
"Well, you have Gladstone," Sherlock said, with a slight laugh. Gladstone looked up and thumped her tail at the sound of her name. "I'm just saying, it would help."
But I didn’t see any alternative: he had dropped such a large amount of weight so quickly that I was becoming terrified. I knew the mortality rates on the condition when it became severe; I knew that cardiac arrest was a genuine possibility, even in a 22-year-old - and especially given the degree he pushed himself when it came to physical activities such as rowing, swimming and long-distance running with his track team.
And yet even I could identify the burgeoning signs of anxiety. Even then, as I identified them, I felt separated from fully feeling them. I could feel them distantly. As if a raw limb was defrosting.
Over and over again, until you die.
''I don't know how likely that will be; we don't take any of the same classes, I presume,'' he said brusquely. ''Economics is not really my area.''
''You don't know it? Or you don't feel it to be true?''
It's his please that finally gets to me.
The words read ominously, in a fear-inducing way:
"It can also be triggered by emotional trauma, Sherlock," I say gingerly, a minute later. "It's fairly common in children who have been sexually assaulted. It's fairly well known, in fact."
''Ok, John. But I want you to call me or text - something - once you are there. Let me know everyone is okay. That you're okay, that Sherlock is okay. Or anyone else involved.''
"You are studying me. And it's not in your nature to study people. Therefore, I don't like it. I don't like what it means."
''Did you ever consider it's just an act? One big act to keep people away? To keep people from looking too deeply?''
''Thank you for forgiving me, Sherlock. About, well... I am sorry. You will always, always be my friend.''
His fingers curl inwards. Curl into white-knuckled fists.
My gaze settles on several packages of teas and flavoured coffee. Gingerbread tea...apparently. Some sort of German Coffee Cake coffee. I pick up the coffee, and sniff it. It actually does smell like dessert.
''Alright,'' I begin a few minutes later after he seems to calm down slightly, ''I am going to get you an acetaminophen for your stomach. But you'll have to eat something small first. No one should take painkillers on an empty stomach, and that's doubly the case for a person getting over a bleeding ulcer.''
''I don't know what to do,'' he whispers.
His eyes are hesitant.
''Sherlock,'' I rush, ''Listen to me: it's going to be okay. Nothing is going to happen today you won't be able to handle. I promise you.''
The weight gain is obvious, and I take a steady, measured breath. Curve my hands, and let them trail over my stomach, over my thighs. Let myself feel the keloid ridges of old, badly healed scars in the softest inner portion of flesh right beside my genitals. And the hot feeling behind my eyes is back, so I focus on an exercise Yuri taught me. It’s called a self-love exercise, and so I move to the shower and turn on a stream of warm water. Let the ghost of a memory from my last session with Yuri fill me.
There is no John, and there is no Sherlock.
I rub my hands against my jeans. They feel damp.
but mycroft's steady, tracking, hawkish sight
John retrieves my coffee mug, and I rise quickly, placing my hands over my belly. I can already feel the slight swell of skin as my stomach puffs out with the weight of the food.
''Sherlock. No games right now. I don't have the patience for games right now. Does your stomach hurt?,'' I ask quickly, licking my lips, nervous.
Once again, John Watson was proving to be quite the conundrum.
"Please, sir, will you calm down?" the manager asked.
He still had his Sig. He had somehow managed to keep it with his things, the few items that remained to him. It all fit into the dusty duffel bag, a few worn out pairs of jeans and jumpers. His entire wardrobe could fit into one load at the laundromat. He could see his entire life whirling around behind the glass door, being cleaned and rinsed, however frayed.
Sherlock eagerly spread his legs for John, and felt John hum in encouragement, hands running up and down their long length.
The next time he opened his eyes, he was in a field hospital. The pain was still horrendous, and passing out again was a welcome relief.
“So that’s the van, then?” John asked. “How are we going to find it?”
And so, Sherlock Holmes had to conclude, that dreams sometimes really did come true.
"I wouldn't put it past him," Lestrade said and sighed. "Seriously, John. When I asked Sherlock, he just gave me this shifty-eyed look and hedged around the issue."
"You know what it is, John – ah!"
He slowly uncurled and moved back towards John. John reached out to receive him, pulling him close. Sherlock scrunched his eyes shut in embarrassment as his cock pushed insistently against John's hip, but didn't pull away this time. John ran his hands down Sherlock's sides and nudged at the hem of Sherlock's pants.
"I don't know who else to call," Sherlock said. "I definitely can't call my brother. But there's also nothing that you can do."
John had heard many insults thrown his way over the past month or so. People called him a leech on society, called him useless, and simply treated him as if he were somehow less than human. Didn't deserve respect.
But it wasn't.
“Which station are you looking at?” John asked casually. “I like Channel 5, you know, the one with that Alexander fellow.”
"Oy, fr-Holmes. Don't go running off on us," Donovan said as the two of them went past her.
"And... don't we have to go down to the Met to give our statements?" John asked.
Sherlock likes shortbreads.
"Would someone bail him out?" John asked.
Sherlock smiled.
The only reason that Sherlock wasn't complaining was that he actually loved eating shortbreads. There was nothing better, as far as Sherlock was concerned, except maybe mince pies. He hated most aspects of Christmas, but the sweets were the only bearable part.
"I will," John promised. "I will."
"My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, Or else my heart, concealing it, will break," Sherlock said to him with a sigh.
Sherlock stopped suddenly, as if something was happening that hadn't occurred to him.
Not that John would listen, even if Sherlock did point it out. It was always his fault, wasn't it.
"Chantelle came in late the other day. Is your friend the doctor keeping her up late?" the nurse giggled.
“Oh, don’t you worry about that!” the woman at the desk said. “I’ve seen the news for the weekend, and it seems like it will hold.”
"You could give me a spanking, sir," Sherlock said.
There was nothing else inside but a blank piece of cardboard. It had been a trick meant for John, but Sherlock had been the one to take the bait!
And then he followed Sherlock away from the crime scene, Gladstone at his heels.
This is what he loved. This, and all the moments in between.
"So," John said. "Tell us about this murderer. Why haven't you managed to catch him yet?"
John broke away and asked, “Is this okay, Sherlock?”
"Oh yes," John said. "Can you count them for me, Private?"
"It... it's just the heat," Sherlock said sadly. "Once this is over, you'll be embarrassed and avoid me."
The next morning, John made everyone eggs using Mrs. Hudson's kitchen (and eggs, but no one mentioned that), and Sherlock ate his portion without complaint, considering the sudden possibilities he'd never thought of before the bed bug incident.
“This damned building,” Sherlock groaned in frustration.
"You're right," John said. "Let's take this to your bedroom."
"I can't go back to my laboratory," Sherlock realized in horror.
"One," he said, with a whine.
Sherlock lost track of how long he played, but the horrible smell of burned toenails had almost completely faded by the time the sound of feet on the stairs started coming up. Sherlock didn't notice them, however, caught up as he was in playing.
Thankfully, John had been at work when the problem started.
"We haven't even started on the fun part," John said. "And we'll start off with this question: when was the last time you ate anything, Sherlock?"
“Fine,” Sherlock said. “Where are my clothes.”
On his own part, it had been so very easy to fall into his role. John was more worried what was going to happen when this was all over and he had to stop. Any time he felt the urge to bestow some form of physical affection on Sherlock, he didn't hold back. Letting go of his reservations had been simply a matter of telling himself that Sherlock would think he was acting.
John knows the situation.
John downed his pint, but before he could fork out the cash to pay, Posh Bloke flung down ten quid on the counter, and tugged him away. Since the bartender didn't even notice them leave, John felt a bit better about not paying himself.
If only they'd had a week or two to get used to it, then maybe this would be working. Sherlock had flirted plenty of times for a cover, but he hadn't had to get so close and personal, except for that time with Janine. Even then, it had been obvious upon recollection that Sherlock was unused to intimate contact.
Well, second thing was to go visit Mr. Fielding in the hospital again. This would be infinitely more trying without John, but needs must. He wanted to take a taxi, but there was no way to direct it without coming across as a complete nutter. He wished that John was with him again, and decided that he would take transit.
“Let’s check at the Inn,” said Greg.
Because John seemed like everything they wanted to be, and Sherlock didn't understand how she did it.
Shakespeare might yet drive Sherlock mad, if this persisted.
Which wouldn't have been a problem if Sherlock hadn't been looking over that shoulder.
John looked over as if noticing for the very first time.
Of course, it wouldn't be as simple as all that, it just couldn't be. Sherlock wasn't so much worried about the general public, but their family might not understand what Sherlock's gender identity actually meant to them. It did mean a lot to them that John was reacting well, because it meant they had a base of support to fall back on in the event that their family became unbearable to deal with.
"You won't get away!" Sherlock proclaimed.
"John," Sherlock pleaded.
John put his back against the wall of the building and bent his knees. Sherlock stood on John's knee, then climbed onto his shoulder. John slowly straightened his legs, pushing Sherlock up the wall. Sherlock briefly admired John's strength. Grasping the window ledge, Sherlock pulled himself up and found himself inside the warehouse.
The tailor finished up and said, "You can come and pick up your order in two days."
"It's... it's okay," Sherlock replied, struggling with his feelings.
It was the only song he could think of to sing, so he started it again, and again once he'd finished it one time through. Eventually, John started to relax. Something must have penetrated his fog of sleep, because he woke groggily and blinked over at Sherlock sitting next to him.
Their lips met, and it was pure bliss.
"It wasn't as if I was expecting to use them for their usual purpose,' Sherlock said, flushing. "Experiment on – "
“I notice you managed to remain clothed,” Sherlock said snarkily as they went to the door to get their shoes on.
That was the day that John Watson met Sherlock Holmes.
"I... I haven't, I've just been busy!" Sherlock said defensively.
"And he's your... colleague?" Wilkes said, raising a skeptical eyebrow.
"You couldn't possibly have heard this one," Sherlock said.
Sherlock shrugged again noncommittally.
"I'll bandage that up for you," John said. "Who knew you were such a scrapper?"
“How is it my fault? You're the one who made the Woman angry. Sherlock would still be a man if not for you.”
"Depart not as thy shadow came," Sherlock murmured in return.
Why was everyone determined to make things terrible?
John patted Gladstone's nose and replied, "Not the only one."
John nodded.
She could, however, drag him far enough that he could reach his gun.
John got to her feet as well. "Sherlock... do you... have feelings for me?"
It wasn't often Sherlock needed an explanation, but this time, Sherlock had no clue what John could be doing.
And then John tripped, and both he and Donovan toppled backwards onto a pool table. A pool table that was currently in use by what looked like a biker gang. A biker gang that wasn't very pleased that their game had been interrupted.
Sherlock simply shrugged. There was no way of knowing that yet, but surely even Lestrade didn't need any help figuring out what to do next. This was easy. Two people had done this, and there were probably only two people who would want to do this: his wife and his girlfriend. Sherlock was more interested in finding out what the weapon was that had made the marks.
Sherlock hummed in agreement, and John shuddered at the vibrating sensation that send through him. He raised himself up and the lowered himself again. God, this was so dirty. Sherlock moaned louder, and John made a muffled sound in the back of his throat in reply. Sherlock lapped and mouthed at him, mindful to keep his teeth out of the equation.
"Get on the bed, on your knees, arse up, head down," John ordered.
"No idea, weird things," John said, digging out her phone. "Look, like this."
"About time," Sherlock said.
"Right, whatever, mister," the cabbie replied with a shrug. "So long as you pay your fare, you can be as loony as you like."
Sherlock had already considered that. There was only one place to stay in the town, a little bed and breakfast with very limited rooms. He had planned it in advance, and he was fairly certain there was a room available, but no more than one room. It was perfect.
“I don’t mean just the kissing,” John said. “I mean everything else, too.”
“We never figured out where they went,” said Alice. “Did they leave already?”
His only clothes were not only filthy, but threadbare. He had to dress in layers in order to make an outfit that actually kept him somewhat warm. He didn't even have socks.
"I'm sure I could have driven us for five hours," Sherlock said, without really thinking about it.
"And you're sure it'll work?"
"What about you, Sherlock, any prospects? How about that lad who's researching with Dr. Binnema?" John asked, nudging their shoulder with hers.
"Sir! I could... I could suck your cock, sir." Sherlock was flushing down his neck, too.
He might as well try and come up with a plan to get rid of Chantelle. He couldn’t count on getting his voice back in order to accomplish this goal, because time was of the essence. John attached himself far too easily to women who had no idea what John was really like.
"We can't do anything yet," Lestrade said sadly.
Sherlock and John pass the time.
The feel of John's fingers, unexpected, running through his hair was just as brilliant as his brain.
"Two words again, John!" Sherlock sang. "Pakistan."
"That doesn't prove anything," Lestrade said.
b) search out Malcolm’s missing husband Xavier
Too heavy to be for a woman.
“It says right here on the map: Here there be Dragons.”
Two more strokes and Sherlock let out a little mewl and rolled his hips up. John drew eight points on Sherlock's body and smiled slightly.
Meanwhile, it looked like one of his experiments was almost ready for the next stage, and he hadn't even been able to finish his wank. Not that it would have made much of a difference, he'd still want to fuck himself on the dildo anyways.
As they made their way home, Sherlock said, "You know, John, I don't think I'm much one for doing the tying."
"John..." Sherlock said in a high voice, and then clamped his mouth shut.
There was a beautiful creature that smelled divine sitting in his lap and begging him to do something. Sherlock, usually so reticent about any sort of feelings had begun to unfurl, like a blossom. There was a wet patch on the back of his pyjama bottoms where he was leaking with desire, all for John.
The knock came again, and then a voice growled, "Open up, I know you're in there. I can smell your scent all over this building."
“Is that a yes?” John rumbled against his throat, licking at his pulsing carotid artery.
He got up sedately, and had a wander around the kitchen, just running his fingers over the crop again and again as he waited. In truth, the waiting was probably just as torturous for him as it was for Sherlock. But he had more patience, could wait for an entire day if it would only make Sherlock more pliant, more desperate for him at the end of the wait.
“I dream of it all the time,” I said eventually. John still stroked the back of my hand, and I took a deep breath.
C) Try to avoid answering
John pressed Sherlock’s ankles back until they could rest on his shoulders, and Sherlock moaned brokenly as John sank into him even deeper. And as John began to thrust again, the change in angle caused him to brush Sherlock’s prostate.
Anyway, the race was close between A) and C), but C) prevailed. On with the story!
"I..." John licked his lips, and his eyes dropped to Sherlock's mouth. "We should talk about this."
"I – " Sherlock got up off the bed and went to sit next to the door. They leaned against it and imagined that John was doing the same on the other side. "John..."
“You’ll like it less when it dries and gets frizzy,” Sherlock said dryly.
Sherlock approached John while he was making a cup of tea, the optimal time to get John to agree to something, because tea preparation always left John in a better mood than what it had been previously.
“Who are you texting, Holmes?” Wilkes asked in a silky voice. “Finally got a freak friend to hang out with instead of being by yourself in the lab at 11 o’ clock at night?”
"What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?" Sherlock yawned.
Above average intelligence, although still not enough to come close to matching Sherlock’s brain. No one did, except Mycroft.
"Sherlock..."
Fifty quid in total.
Sherlock simply crossed his arms and waited.
Inside the package was two sets of clothing, a three pack of pants, socks and vests, and a pack of razors, deoderant, and shampoo. John sighed in relief. It looked like Sherlock had dropped by M&S sometime early in the morning. He was just glad it was nothing like what Sherlock was wearing. He looked like he was wearing a suit more appropriate for a business meeting than going to work with the police.
He certainly hadn't been expecting
“Okay, fine,” Lestrade said with a put-upon sigh. “We need two people to go to a gay couple's retreat.”
"Yeah, of course," Sherlock said.
“John,” Sherlock groaned, reaching down with one hand to grab John’s arse and pull it towards himself.
To Sherlock's surprise, he found tears welling up in his eyes. He reached out a hand, and the snout sniffed him, then sneezed. All at once, Sherlock had a lapful of eager puppy.
"What's gotten into you?" John asked breathlessly, kissing Sherlock's face.
Sherlock was lying on his stomach on the bed, propped up on his elbows and waiting for John. The book was open to one page, and four bundles of rope were laid out neatly next to him. John put the glass down next to Sherlock and set the kit and the scissors within easy reach.
"Okay," John said. "Can I still touch you?"
Sherlock considered the past year, and could not help but feel glad that it was coming to an end. There was nothing like having an assassin and her false child come to an end in their life, and John settling back in Baker Street. However, this would close a chapter in their life, and Sherlock was cautiously pleased.
He kept telling himself that all he had to do was lay low for a while until the cops forgot about the break-in. Surely they had better things to do than look out for a homeless man and a dog who hadn't even stolen anything?
"Listen," Sherlock said.
"The singularity of your brain is phenomenal," John said. "It's one in a million. Ten million. I can't even imagine having a brain like yours."
This is what he’d been hoping for last night, before they’d been interrupted by that thrice-damned fire alarm. He didn’t know what he would do if his hopes were dashed this time. Probably implode.
"You're leaking so much," John said, rubbing his thumb through the fluid bubbling up from his slit.
“Is that the best you’ve got?” asked John.
“Let me,” John breathed, and took over.
Sherlock tried to ignore John, but John didn't leave. They could see the shadow under their door where John was sitting. After a while, Sherlock spoke up again.
"And Gladstone, too, of course."
"Choose one," John said.
“You were in the Cadets,” Sherlock began. “I can see it on you, even though you’ve been out for a couple of years now. Stance, hairstyle, the way you carry yourself. You haven’t forgotten. You automatically fell in step with me. You’re a student, and you’re studying trauma surgery. Your hands are steady. And… you have an armed forces brochure tucked into one box, picked up from a job fair. You only picked up one brochure. The rest of your stuff is packed up neatly, and not one superfluous item was brought with you, which means that the brochure you have with you is something you’re serious about. You’re neat and orderly, perfect for an army lifestyle, but it’s a cultivated orderliness. I can tell, because of the way you made your tea. You left everything out all over the counter, realized you’d made a mess, and have automatically gone back and cleaned up.”
John unzipped his jeans and shoved both denim and pants down around his knees. Sherlock was still in the same position, not moving his hands. John found the lube on the bedside table, quickly smeared it over the length of his own erection, then got on the bed behind Sherlock. He gathered Sherlock into his lap, and his slick cock slid up between the still-hot cheeks of Sherlock's arse.
"You came back, you berk," John said. "You came back, and suddenly, I had two people that I felt strongly about in my life. I couldn't keep you both, that's not how this works for me."
d) Address the elephant in the room
John made them breakfast. Sherlock basked in the happy glow of post-coital contentment and watched John bustle around in a pair of boxers and an apron. He himself was wearing one of John’s ratty bathrobes. It was nice wearing John’s clothes, and Sherlock found himself making a list of things John owned that he could appropriate as his own over the course of their relationship.
"John," Sherlock growled.
He looked up from John’s erection and caught John’s dazed expression.
Slowly, he opened the door. As soon as the gap was wide enough, Gladstone shot through it and bounded down the stairs. Mrs. Hudson exclaimed downstairs, and John had no doubt that she was being scratched behind the ears, and perhaps slipped a piece of bacon for her enthusiastic greeting.
John blinked in surprise and grinned. Sherlock smiled back in return, John's pleased expression all he really needed to confirm that he'd made the right decision. This wasn't going back to normal, exactly, but it was them, together, going out and having fun. He'd like to do that again.
"What's that about death?" John said. "The guy is dead? You want to know why he's dead? Oh! You want to go to the morgue."
“Alright,” John said, smiling.
Oh no. Sherlock knew that smile, and it meant that John was on the scent of a different kind than that of clues. Sherlock glared at her.
Everything was going in circles.
Molly was at the lab when they got there, and was in fact, just beginning to remove the man's clothes in order to examine him.
"Such a good lad," John praised, and circled his tongue around the tight pucker.
Sherlock’s heart leapt, and he found himself nodding vigorously before he’d even formulated a response to this surprising invitation.
"It looks as if they were required," John replied, knuckles cracking. "So are you going to move along now, or what?"
"Oh, I had some clothes delivered for you," Sherlock said, waving a hand.
It was just as he was having these thoughts that Mycroft came in.
“You’re doing it again,” John said, and Sherlock was so focused on the latest news from the case that he didn’t hear the warning note in John’s voice.
John looked fondly down at Sherlock's lithe form spread out across the living room floor, surrounded by the scattered bits of evidence in their latest case. He had fallen asleep in between the time John had left to go get them takeout from the late night Chinese restaurant down the street and getting back.
No recent cases involving rings.
Mycroft sighed and rolled his eyes again before leaving. Sherlock caught Anthea smiling as she followed him out. She handed John a flash drive before leaving.
"Well, I did, and I have, and now I've decided," John said. "Molly's already RSVP'd."
Mummy wanted to go see the Nutcracker. Sherlock could think of nothing he had less desire to see, but it was his turn. Mummy had even said that John could come if he wanted. Sherlock had no idea why John would bother, but miraculously enough, John agreed at once.
“It will take him three hours to die,” Malcolm said. “The poison is slow-acting and will take some time to kick in.”
"Mouth open," John instructed.
“That’s a lad, tell me what you like,” John said, shimmying down Sherlock’s body.
“No,” John answered easily, and then went back to reading the newspaper.
"I... wouldn't have minded," Sherlock said, and shivered in a way that had nothing to do with being cold.
"As if you could get me into
"Clowns."
"It's all right, sweetheart," John said huskily.
"You've got a bit of flour, just there," Sherlock said with a sniff, pointing at John's face.
“What are you doing?” John asked with a laugh. “Don’t worry, I don’t bite. You’ll fall out of bed that way.”
"Gladstone," John called, voice rough.
John was marvelling at what a strange man he'd discovered when there was a sound from upstairs, and someone yelled, "Hey, I know someone's in here. Show yourself!"
Sherlock huffed and let John get to work, trying to keep their breathing even. Eventually, their heart stopped beating so hard, and they began to feel drowsy and relaxed. They hardly noticed as John's fingers began massaging the back of their neck.
John went to step through and came to a sudden halt at the sight of another man already in the room. He was tall, with greying hair, and an easy-going air. He frowned at John's appearance and John frowned right back.
John opened the fortune cookie.
"Well, you know, a kiss can mean romance... or it can mean... um, more lust-fuelled things..." John flushed.
"Oh, for Christ's sake," John said. "Are you going to help us or not?"
He could ‘accidentally’ set her on fire, that would probably work. No, that would get rid of Chantelle, but John would see through it immediately and get mad at Sherlock. He was always annoyed when something Sherlock did drove away one of his dates. But Sherlock didn’t have a choice if he wanted to keep John.
"Sherlock," he said quietly. "You might want to check the delivery order for this pub, but I don't think that this butchery was used for animals."
It was strange that Sherlock and John had both served their nation now, and both come away scarred from the ordeal.
"I can't," Sherlock said, feeling a sharp clench in his chest as he refused.
"You're bleeding everywhere," Sally said, crossing her arms.
“He's a bloody big dragon; it's pretty hard to hide one of those,” John said.
This time definitely wasn't an accident.
At that moment, Sherlock caught sight of his shield and got a proper look at it.
When he looked out the window, he was sad to see it wasn't John. It looked like a client. Sherlock should really put up a sign on the door to not disturb him.
"We, meaning you and Sherlock Holmes," Wiggins said. "You know, Doc, I think you're made for trouble."
John returned holding several scarves, and Sherlock watched as John laid them out.
John inhaled deeply and made a pleased noise of appreciation.
whose birthday was actually two days ago on March 8th! Sorry this is a little bit late, I was stranded away from my computer. Hope you enjoy this!
It took ages for the building manager and the fire crew to sort out what happened, and by that time, Sherlock was feeling sleepy. John lead him back to John’s flat, gave him a spare pair of boxers and a t-shirt, and tucked him into bed, clambering in after him. Sherlock smiled drowsily and hummed in satisfaction as John wrapped his arms around him. It was warm and secure, and absolutely the best feeling in the world, to drift asleep with John’s arms cradling him.
He should have known that no sooner had he opened the door to 221b then he would be whisked away back out into the streets of London, without even a breather to put his briefcase down.
"You berk," John said, pulling Sherlock against him in a one-armed hug.
"There's nothing wrong, just leave me alone," Sherlock said.
Sherlock thought that was the end of it, but the knocking persisted. Did this alpha not understand that Sherlock didn't want anything to do with him?
"I – " Sherlock said, blushing bright red.
A knight stood on the other side of the doorway, hand raised in greeting. His short stature gave no indication of the strength needed to wear the heavy chainmail and plate armour encasing his body. Short blondish hair and blue eyes completed the picture, apart from the slight smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
“Here, sit, I’ll get you a plate,” John babbled.
“Well, there has to be a way out into the Wasting Sea,” John said, frowning.
John himself quite enjoyed this as well. Half of it was just the aesthetic of Sherlock on his knees, perfect plush mouth lavishing attention on him. Sherlock tongued the head of his cock, pressing at the slit, and John's cock throbbed.
Then, there was the Chantelle problem. This was obviously reaching a critical point, and would need to be terminated soon in order to keep John from forming too strong an attachment. He had to come up with a way to keep Chantelle away from John, and without his ability to speak. She wouldn't be swayed easily. John was what most people would term "a good catch" and she probably knew that.
John couldn't not know what he was doing to Sherlock. He just cared more about insipid women than Sherlock.
Sherlock nudged John's leg with his head, and John's hand obediently came down to pat his curls. Sherlock closed his eyes, and the room was still bright behind his eyelids. He made a soft sound in his throat as John's fingers stroked his scalp, and the soft spot behind his left ear.
John Watson, Knight of the Seven Realms, made his way to the stable to find his trusty steed. As he was making his way through Mycroft's castle, he noticed that there was someone following him. Surely news of his quest hadn't spread so fast that there were already enemies to fight?
"You're my good lad," John said, and Sherlock felt his insides fill with warmth.
"Len McTavish's son, Adam," Posh Bloke said. "You know him from somewhere. Think. I know it's difficult for ordinary people, but this is just extreme."
Wiggins leaned in. "I just heard from a couple of people that went by around Len's this morning. The coppers are there, and Len's boy says he was broken into last night! Not only that, he says that a man and his dog were the ones inside!"
Sherlock shivered, and starting at the end of the bed near Sherlock's bare feet, John crawled up his body, skin brushing against the fabric of Sherlock's clothes, but not coming into full contact, teasing him on the way up.
"If you insist," John said. "But if Lestrade ever looks through my phone..."
"John – J-john –
John pinched him again and said, "It's not 'stars,' it's the constellation 'Orion.'"
Happy bday to
Sherlock located it on the lab tabletop, held open to one page with some industrial clamps of some sort. John didn't ask what they were normally used for.
The two of them had eventually settled on one of John’s more ornate daggers, one which John wasn’t overly fond of anyways.
Okay? That was more than okay, in Sherlock’s opinion. He nodded desperately and clutched harder at John’s shoulders.
Sherlock jerked against him, as if surprised. John continued caressing his side gently until he relaxed again. It was odd that Sherlock hadn't settled into his role yet. Sherlock was a great actor, and John was certain if he didn't want to be a detective, the stage would have been an option. Maybe John had sprung it upon him too quickly, before he could come up with a persona of sorts.
"Was it the massage?" John asked. "I know you normally avoid them. If you really didn't want me to touch you, you could have just asked me not to."
"That's a whole new section of the store," John grinned.
"So, how does he do it then?" John asked, frowning. "If he has to get a hotel room every time?"
Maybe genius wasn't actually the word he was looking for.
It deserved the capitals he gave it in his head. He still had a very intense memory of John's hands, warm and firm, grasping his knee to steady himself. The heated look in John's eyes, and the fact that at any moment, Sherlock could have had a warm, pliant, and pleased John Watson topple between his spread thighs was imprinted on his brain.
Tentatively, Sherlock circled one arm over John's body, and John, whether asleep or awake, settled into the embrace. Sherlock rested his cheek on top of John's head, breathed in John's scent, strong as it was near his hairline.
I'm sorry everyone! Once again I was a bit longer with this chapter than I wanted to be! I have been embroiled in something exciting in real life, and it's been hard to get to my writing except for the tiny 221b things I've been writing for the Christmas advent.
Sherlock stared avidly as John put some clean gauze over his injury and taped it down. John’s fingers were deft and sure and very, very warm as they turned his hand over.
"Are you one of those people who are afraid of clowns, John?" Sherlock asked, grinning.
John laughed. "That was just the stag night. Don't worry, I don't want to wake up in the drunk tank again tomorrow morning."
"Look, Sherlock," Lestrade redirected his attention to Sherlock. "I know you've been investigating on your own, and I need to know what's going on. You wouldn't believe what my team and I have found in the burnt out building."
The Crow, as most people fondly called it, was another local pub. It was a favourite among Wiggin's crew, and John mentally calculated how likely it was that they would start coming to his local pub instead now that their favourite was gone.
“Yes, I’ve never seen Malcolm here except the one time a year for the retreat,” she said, smiling.
And then Sherlock remembered the matchbox and the strange golden light. Sherlock immediately discounted magic, because he refused to consider such an unscientific possibility as an answer for what had happened. Perhaps it had hypnotized him into only speaking in Shakespearean quotations? What kind of apparatus would be required for such a thing?
"Okay, just... move onto the centre of the bed, like this," John said, shifting himself.
John supposed he was being given the cheapest one there was, so didn't complain. Come to think of it, he did recognize the man's face. Possibly from walking back and forth to work, but also probably...
“What’s the plan?” he asked, leaning over my shoulder.
John looked at him strangely. "What was that, Sherlock?"
"You marvelous thing," John said, and he backed up until he almost fell backwards, sinking back into his chair with Sherlock in his lap.
"Indeed," Sherlock said, moving to stand. "But now, a shower, I think. I'm drenched in sweat... oh."
Mr. Fielding looked disappointed that Sherlock had not yet solved the mystery, but he also didn't send Sherlock away, so there was that. Sherlock got a blank piece of paper out of his pocket and drew a van on it as best he could. Mr. Fielding watched with interest, and Sherlock pointed at him. Mr. Fielding looked surprised, and patted his own chest. Sherlock nodded. Sherlock got out the map again and pointed at the place where the warehouse was located, then pointed at the van again.
What Sherlock meant to say was, "Too late," but what came out was, "We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone."
"It's marvelous, isn't it," John said, not taking his eyes off London.
"I'm a steam breather," Sherlock noted, realizing that his jaws were dripping boiling hot water all over the palace floor.
Sherlock morosely considered whether there was anything he could do to get John to stay and look at the body rather than go off with Chantelle. It was only a matter of time before this case was finished. Lestrade was probably interviewing the wife and girlfriend right now. Lestrade wasn't the most astute, but even he couldn't miss the significance of the missing ring.
"O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms, alone and palely loitering?" asked Sherlock once Mr. Fielding was in front of him.
The first thing that Sherlock decided that he needed to do was find out if the other person, the man that the authorities thought was mad was actually mad or... like Sherlock.
What was wrong, then? She had everything she'd wanted now. She even had a friend, of sorts, even if Sherlock was overdramatic and self-centred at times.
Sherlock did so, movements slow. His arse cheeks were bright red from his punishment, and his face was bright red from arousal.
“Nice set up,” Sherlock said, which it was.
John stopped. "Are you alright?"
"There!" he proclaimed, then reached for both his hands and brought the bandaged knuckles up to his mouth, placing a kiss on each one.
A loud explosion rent the air, and Molly dived behind a rock as pieces of shrapnel shot in every direction.
"Good lad," John rumbled, and Sherlock took several gasping breaths.
I didn’t say anything, but I did relax back into his embrace. This was fine. He was my safety net. He knew almost everything about me. The only thing he didn’t know was that I loved him. There was no danger here in him discovering that. It was simply his doctorly response to my nightmares.
"Don't worry, we're sending in Donovan as his date," Lestrade tried to assure him.
Sherlock gasped, head tilting to the side where John had touched him.
Sherlock’s heart stumbled. “Girlfriend?”
"Wrists together, love," John said.
"Should get up," Sherlock slurred.
John knew enough about pubs, having been a dishwasher in one as a teen, and could tell from the blackened layout that they were standing near the entrance to the kitchen, and that the walk-in fridge was beyond that. He was surprised to find that there was another section of the restaurant with hooks and what would have been an immaculate condition.
"I have a blanket, a pillow, and a book. I can certainly out-wait you, my easily-bored friend," John replied. "I won't give up so easily!"
Sherlock couldn’t help it, he burst out laughing so hard that a spray of steam and hot water shot out of his nostrils. John leapt back, startled, but then turned up a frowning face towards him.
''I know. God, I know - and it makes sense, but-''
“I don’t know!,” he manages to get out. “Only that-,” and the rest of his words degrade into unintelligible mumbling.
If so, I know it would never have been a subsidized placement. Really, there are only two possibilities here: he either went to the poshest camp known to humankind with a bunch of snooty kids, or else he never went to camp, period.
if that's what he wants,
''Sherlock, wait-,'' I start awkwardly – timid, hesitant.
John doesn't leave me.
''Ok,'' I state, acknowledging the words. The power of the words. ''Thank you.''
''I guess,'' I say faintly. ''Yes, nice. Sex is nice. Which is probably the least descriptive word to describe what sex feels like. What a silly word...nice. But it's sex, and it feels...I guess - God Sherlock,'' I hiss, feeling exposed but also, oddly - not. ''It's not conflated to love. Not in my mind. Love, to me, is distinct. It always has been. In that physical way, sex can - I don't know - aid? Maybe aid the emotional intensity that makes it a partnership? But without love, Sherlock, it doesn't hold me. I'd just end up feeling lonely, then. Just like you probably do. And then sex actually makes the loneliness worse, in a way. Because you are with someone but not really with them. Not deeply. So I have felt alone, you know - even in a sexual relationship. Sometimes if there is no real bond and it's just...god, I don't know what I am saying. I'm very bad at talking about this kind of stuff.''
“He could have been me,” he replies softly. “The last one. Not Toby, but the last one who was murdered. And now he’s gone forever, even though he only really suffered while he was here. And I can’t fix anything. I can’t make it better for him.”
Sherlock grimaces.
At 12:02 am I pull up Mycroft's contact profile in my phone and within seconds he's on the line while I ramble off my concerns. Within two minutes of that he is off the phone; apparently he has promised to 'trace' Sherlock, and I am under very precise instructions to stay off the phone, he says, in case of an 'emergency.' Unless, of course, Sherlock's number comes in. In which case I will answer the phone, Mycroft's instructions be damned.
He was playing music, in the courtyard outside of the Sheldonian Theatre. Others were playing, too. But as I watched his hands move up and down over a violin with a sort of rapacious concentration, I fell into a trance.
