want you to feel like you can’t have me.  I love you so, so much and you’re my best friend and, and I can’t think of anyone I’d rather be with for . . . for forever, I guess, if you’ll have me that long.”
Feel free to let me know what you think in the comments!
“ . . . You didn’t have to do that, Dean.”
Just as his dreams drift to their family, all at once there’s some kind of . . .
Cas glances away, blushing a little.  “He actually asked me, personally, to help him fix Heaven.”
“What about that Balthazar buddy of yours?”
“I’m not losing you, not again!”  Now it’s Dean’s turn to start crying.
It’s not until Dean jolts upright that he notices the arm draped over him, or the angel attached to it curled up behind him.
He turns back.  “Cas?”
Dean opens his eyes again.  He leans in even closer to Cas and drops his voice to a husky whisper.  “What do you say we get ourselves cleaned up?”
“I’m already there, Cas.”
“ . . . Anyway, with all the angels back to power Heaven again, Jack was able to rebuild it.  Tore down all the walls keeping everyone isolated in their old memories, and he got rid of the dungeon too.  Now everyone can properly see their loved ones again and build their own paradises.  He, uh—”
“Oh, it’s fine, I uh,” Cas looks sheepishly at Dean’s opposite shoulder.  “I think I might’ve stained you up too, actually.”
“Shit.”  Dean pulls his hand away from Cas’ left upper arm, leaving an inky handprint on the coat sleeve.  “Sorry.”
“Sorry I was gone so long.”
Not that Dean’s awake to come to such a conclusion.
“I think that, whenever your time ultimately comes for real, you’ll like it a lot better now than last time you were there,” Cas finishes.  Dean leans in close and kisses his cheek.
The door flies open.  Billie’s broken through.
Together, they rise.
“Not really.”  Dean lazily rests his chin on Cas’ shoulder.  “Been a pretty slow day out here.  How ‘bout yours?”
“Something like that.  Gabriel and Anna both sent congratulations on the engagement—”
They don’t know what the future holds, still don’t know how Team Free Will is going to stop Chuck and fix all the destruction he’s already caused, and yet . . . there’s something reassuring about the promise of forever, the knowledge that time will keep moving forward towards forever no matter what happens.  And if things go belly-up, hey, Death’s already failed to part them at least once.
“ . . . You’re not the only one who felt that way.  I, I know I’ve liked you,
And yet, as Dean Winchester sleeps, the glimpses of memory that come to him feel warmer, safer.  Almost as if Castiel were shielding him even now.
Sure enough, there’s a matching handprint on the left sleeve of Dean’s jacket, in almost the same spot as that other handprint over a decade ago.  Something about it makes Dean feel warm inside.
longer than I can even pinpoint, but . . . I didn’t think there was a chance in Heaven or Hell that you’d ever like me back like that.”
The Shadow hisses, trying to rip Cas from Dean’s grip, but Dean won’t budge.  Next it tries to pull Dean off Cas, but Dean just holds on tighter, bringing them chest-to-chest.
Dean pries his eyes open, rubbing at them when they’re assaulted by the fluorescent lighting.  His head hurts.
have—”  He breaks off with a shudder as Dean kisses that one spot on his neck that never fails to make him weak in all the right ways.
“I love you.”
A shadow moves over him while he stirs.
He can see nothing but, still dreaming, feels like he’s being lifted.
includes every demon he and Sam ever killed, but he’s in too much of a good mood to worry at the moment, and either way something tells him that Jack will have a better handle on limiting their mayhem then Chuck ever did.  He pulls away to look at Cas.  “Must’ve been like a big ol’ family reunion up there then, huh?”
Dean savors it to the last second, not pulling away even for air before breathing his last as The Shadow overtakes them both.
“It’s very good. You’re a much better cook than your father,” Grammy declares.
“Stop what?”
“Yes sir,” Dean purrs with enthusiasm, happy to oblige since he’s been thinking about it all evening.
“What? I’m gay, not blind.”
the brother of the guy who crashed into my business and you didn’t
“He’s my friend, too,” she shrugs. “And hey, he’s dreamy. He
“I don’t wanna manipulate him.”
Cas nods, starting to feel apprehensive. This isn’t really his scene. Hell, the bars aren’t really his scene, either, but this is a whole other thing.
“He owes you that legally.”
“I meant what I said earlier,” Dean says emphatically. “About this job. About the chance you gave me. I know I’m making minimum wage, but hell if it isn’t the money I’m proudest of in my whole life. You—you got something good there.”
Dean zones out for a few minutes and is surprised when Cas drops to his side, a couple of plates in his hands. He hadn’t noticed him get up from the loveseat. He takes one of the sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly, nice) and gobbles it down in seconds.
“I loved it, baby.”
Dean whirled on him. “You remember what you said when we found out Eileen was gone, huh? That if you let yourself go there, you’d lose your mind? This is me trying not to lose my friggin’ mind.” He rubbed his cheek, then his hair, pulling at it to distract himself.
He hopes Cas doesn’t think he’s an absolute idiot.
according to this website, they were still in foster care when they started developing it and they were days from homelessness when they sold it. Crazy, right? They grew up in the system, ran away to Wyoming by themselves when Castiel was only fifteen, and worked their asses off to be where they are.”
As a little brother, Sam would love to answer that sarcastically, but as a fellow escapee from their shitty life circumstances, he answers honestly. “Because you’ve dealt with a lot of assholes.”
“Because they stay even in winter, when things are at their worst. That’s what he did for me.” Gabriel, who did calm down with Castiel’s movement, starts to squirm, so Castiel shushes him and switches shoulders in an effort to calm the little one once more. “He’s helped me in every way imaginable. I’m very fortunate, very blessed.”
No one is here at this hour, which is just the way Dean likes it. He takes off his flip-flops and tucks them into his waistband at the back. The sand is still a bit damp from the thunderstorm they had in the wee hours of the morning. He strolls through beach detritus, scuffing his feet and emptying his pockets as he inhales cool, salty air.
“Thanks,” he says, quirking a tired half-smile as he plays along.
Cas was in the library, reading (
“I know,” Cas pouts.
“Yeah, no, it’s fine. We got it all straightened out.”
Cas turns. “Oh, were you standing there?” he asks with a knowing grin. “I had no idea.”
Outside, the snow falls.

Dean smiles and shakes his head. “Yeah, they were just busting my chops. Nothing they haven’t done before.”
Downstairs, dishes are clattering and music is playing. Led Zeppelin.
Castiel confirms that Ana Jo is feeling okay to take on Matthew. After that, he exits from their chat with a final
Incredulous looks and barely-contained smiles are traded as they all try to figure out (Dean most of all) whether Cas is joking. “Are you into him?” Calvin asks.
For days his alpha screamed, his usual calm torn to shreds by the need to mate, to protect, to comfort. The only thing that gave him any relief at all was when he’d leave his used t-shirts on the porch for Charlie to collect. He couldn’t be with his omega—his
Before he can say anything, Dean’s there, shielding him with his body and growling at the other guy to back off.
Cas opens his eyes and turns to face Dean. “We could play his bias to our advantage. Bring different guys here every night and have sex. It would drive him nuts. I mean, we’d just be pretending, we wouldn’t really have sex with them, obviously”—Cas averts his eyes—“unless you want to, of course—”
Once more, Cas shrugs. “I’d like to be.”
Castiel meets his gaze in the blue-black light from the television. There’s something about it that makes him warm and dizzy, something that pokes mercilessly at the feelings that are constantly pushing at the walls of his heart. He can’t look very long. He drops his eyes to his lap. “Still, I’m not being a good houseguest.”
“Not really.”
. Today she’s playing school, a game she loves, and the screen is her classroom of undoubtedly eager, well-behaved students.
“Night.”
Cas sighs. “You picked this club, may I remind you. This is the shit that happens in these sorts of clubs.”
Hannah looks up ideas online. “Play video games! Watch sports! Listen to music! Break the law!”
“Bitch, please.”
NSFW, friends. XO
The dragon peers back at him. He looks...delighted, almost, if dragons could feel such a thing.
He flings the door of his bedroom open to find Matthew and finds...Matthew. In Dean’s arms. Gabe is next to him, and Sam is next to him. He had no idea anyone was still here. Something is on the TV, but they’ve all turned his way. “Oh. Hi. I couldn’t find Matthew.”
d and agreed that Dean is a great guy. He didn’t like the little smile on her face when she said it, but he let that go. He’ll always be grateful to her for dropping everything and coming to his house, his favorite ice cream in hand, and listening to him ramble.
They reveal his hand.
“Oh, I know, and don’t think that doesn’t terrify me.” Cas carefully moves Scrabble off his lap, then drags himself to Dean’s side and leans into his shoulder.
Cas rose from his seat abruptly. “I’ll see you on your next day off. Be safe. I heard it’s supposed to snow.” He said the last part sarcastically as he strode out of the kitchen.
He grabs his phone and opens his Spotify app, chuckling as he opens his MTC playlist. He and Dean each have a favorite in the band, and they’re pretty passionate about their opinions. Not that it matters—it’s not like they’d ever meet them, and the co-singers are engaged anyway—but it’s fun to tease each other. The heavy bassline of “Don’t Tell Me” begins, and he hums as he cracks his knuckles and gets into writing mode.
“It will
Cas places his hand atop Dean’s. They trade warm smiles until Dean’s smile becomes a smirk.

“That’s for thinking you’re bothering me. You’re never bothering me. I
“Cheese sticks and white cheddar popcorn.”
“Seems like he’s doing okay now. Attachment-wise, I mean.”
He doesn’t answer. Sam doesn’t try to engage.
“Sorry!” he whispers. “Sam and I made chicken and dumplings for lunch and thought you’d want some. We thought Dean was gonna be home, but he was gone when we went downstairs and didn’t come back...now I see where he ended up.” He shoots them an amused smirk.
“Mmmmmmm,” Dean purrs.
Dean rolls toward him and kisses his shoulder. “Focus on that, then, okay? Everyone got out. You came home to us. We’re all here and safe.”
“Yup.”
“Aww, I wanted to decorate it!” whines Dean’s younger niece, Reese, as she hangs off the counter.
Dean stills at the blockers comment—
Since he’s the boss, Castiel guesses not.
“Why does it matter if you’re not willing to try?” Ana Jo asks.
Sam and Gabriel stay silent.
“Somebody’s—fuck, someone’s here!” He hurries to dress, but Dean stops him.
to stay here. Why?”
“Jeez, I thought only Sam got so excited about salad,” he says, secretly thrilled that Cas is pleased about it and that he didn’t even question whose meal they should eat. “Got bread, too. And figured we could have some vanilla ice cream topped with all those damn berries you made me buy.”
Cas parks his car and forces Dean and his feelings out of his mind. He has bigger fish to fry—or at least more immediate ones.
Nope, not dwelling on that, either.
“We are, but that’s not nearly as exciting for the casual viewer. We aren’t filming at the university. We will film at IAC, but a lot of what we film there will end up cut, I’m sure. Too technical for most people’s interests.”
“Going to take a shower. I have to wash off your spunk.”
Dean’s heart thumps in his chest. He’s run from any chance of those words being directed his way by a lover, run from this sort of intimacy as fast as he could...yet he doesn’t feel like running now. Just because it’s roleplay, probably. Where you can explore your deepest fantasies in a safe way.
He decides on fluff. Christmas is on its way, and he wants to have something to post around that time. He thinks about Dean’s mention of the Secret Santa exchange he’s planning for his Kindergarten students, and an idea blooms in his mind. He writes.
Dean pulls Cas in for another kiss, ignoring their families’ hoots and hollers.
He fingers the blossom on his belt.
And with that, Cas walks around the table, grabs the back of Dean’s head, and plunges his tongue into his mouth.
“Don’t hog him!” Cas hears Ellen shout at the same time as his own mother says, “Let go so I can give your boyfriend a hug!”
“I don’t want to.”
One of the paramedics—Tam, by his name tag—pushes Castiel back to tend to the man that Castiel is just now noticing is bloodied. Benny pulls Castiel away. “He’s probably in some kind of shock, brother,” he says softly. “I want you to get looked at, too.”
Grinning, Dean says, “Same.”
Cas, dressed in his knock-off Birks, khaki pants, a white t-shirt, and bright coral and navy striped suspenders (friggin’ hot-ass dork—Dean is gonna
That grain of doubt that he really gets to have everything he wants makes Castiel reply, “If you meant it.”
Dean glances at his belly self-consciously.
“Dean, please. I can take it.”
There are choruses of affirmation. Castiel stays quiet.
“That was...very nice of you. I didn’t know you had it in you.”
He hasn’t been able to stop thinking about their roleplay. How good it felt to fuck Dean, sure, but also how good it felt to hold him, care for him, call him his. The bachelor lifestyle is vastly overrated, he’s been thinking more and more—has always thought, really, but he’s stuck with it for...reasons.
Ohh, lovelies, I know many of you have been waiting for this domestic roleplay! It’s a big one, so it’s split up. Here’s an introduction for you. 😘

relationship...more of a friends-with-benefits sort of arrangement. He seems open to it these days, so...why not?”
“I know what you’re gonna say, but I couldn’t help it. My dad walked away from us, and we lost everything. I wanted to show you that I wasn’t gonna do that, that you could trust me to take care of us and, you know, whoever else comes our way. Our family.”
When the baby begins wailing, Castiel places him up on his shoulder, shrugging out of one sleeve first so the fabric isn’t in Gabriel’s face. He stands and begins pacing the room when the upright position and bare shoulder aren’t enough, figuring perhaps some movement would help.
Cas wrinkles his nose. “I’m trying to determine if that’s cat urine or mothballs.”
“How the hell did you do that?” Castiel demanded to know. “They wouldn’t even let me make a reservation!”
Dean turns around and sits up. “What’s the matter?” he asks, concern written all over his face.
“It feels like something.” Dean sits up straighter to look at Cas better. “Are you okay?”
“I thought so, too. What’s up?”
Dean nods, blinking his eyes rapidly as he opens his arms. Castiel throws himself at him, a tear slipping from his eye. He hangs on tight, cradling Dean’s head in his hand as he buries his face in Dean’s neck.
He huffed. Understatement of the year.
Unable to find the right words, he nodded.
It was fascinating and quite arousing to watch Dean struggle to keep it together and not to jump him right here and now. He would understand him. He did understand him. Alone his control over his grace held back the overwhelming reactions of his own body.
“Indeed, I do.” The corners of Cas’ mouth shot up just a tiny bit, a sure sign of a smirk, and Dean tried to ignore the butterflies in his stomach which always threatened to stir when the angel was looking at him like that.
Bobby phoned in, reassuring them that everyone who came over from Apocalypse World was back.
“Okay, okay. What is the story of this fu– ...
“Shit.” All colour trained off his face. Without another word Dean turned on the spot and stormed out of the library, leaving Castiel confused and saddened behind.
“Jack, Sam, that’s Sully. He’s an old friend,” Dean introduced the Zanna.
When he started the motor Castiel thought of the last time he had driven Dean’s precious car. It had been during the time Sam and Dean had vanished without a trace after Kelly’s rescue. He did not like to be reminded of that trying time with no leads for weeks and the fear of having lost them, having lost Dean forever.
“Huh?” he squinted. “Crusty on the outside and soft and mushy on the inside?”
was his mission. This was why Heaven had chosen him, why his father had sent him here. And yet, even in talking with Anna, he defied his orders: Kill on sight, his directive said. His sister had fallen. She was a disgrace not only to the garrison but to all of Heaven. Even in talking to her, he was committing treason. However, he couldn’t do it, would never harm her. Not when she was peaceful and gave him no reason to act as he was commanded. Or was seeding doubts treason? It most probably was. It should be.
A hand grasped his and he caught Cas’ eyes.
“I’ll try. Don’t worry, Sam ... Dean.” A figure was kneeling right in front of him, and Dean pulled his bent legs even closer to his body, making himself as small as he could. “Dean, look at me.”
“Dean.”
“Like a democratic republic?” Sam asked, “With house points?”
And right in the centre of it all, the man that had brought him here. There he was: his mission. The single reason half the battalions of Heaven had laid siege on Hell for years in this plane of existence. For a short moment, Castiel just watched him at work, fascinated against his will. Bent over a workbench where another doomed soul was bound, he was extremely skilful, every cut precise, his handiwork done masterfully. It was atrocious, yet nothing he hadn’t expected, nothing he hadn’t been confronted with since the moment he came into existence. And still, there was something he had never encountered before, something captivating. For the first time in centuries, maybe forever, Castiel was enthralled.
Dean’s eyes shot up, meeting his own. Grief was clouding the usual vibrant green and Castiel didn’t need to hear any further confirmation to know he was right. More than ever he wished he could tell his friend everything but he didn’t want to risk losing their friendship and his only family on Earth or any other plane of existence. Castiel was afraid, although after witnessing his friend’s reaction he finally allowed himself to hope for more.
“Then what
“We watched
He looked at them, standing there in the bunker’s library. Sam, Eileen, his family, his friends. Even Jack was there. This seemed to be a better entertainment than anything Netflix and Co had to offer these days. He might have grumbled about it but they gave him the emotional backup he needed to go through with this. They believed in him and supported him. He still didn’t understand why, but they loved him as much as he loved them.
“I would like that. Very much. And it has been that long for me, too, Dean. Although, it took me a long time to recognise my feelings for you were much more romantic than the profound bound created by my raising you from Hell.” A faint tickle indicated a soft kiss was placed on Dean’s head, inducing a smile on his face.
Holy shit! If the eyes didn’t kill him, this voice would be his downfall. Now he could die happy. Aware that his brother and Eileen were still around, witnessing the whole scene, he needed to keep this thing under control, especially since he still didn’t know where Cas stood in regard to everything. Almost everything. Although the little shifts of his body were promising, very promising.
Over and over he could feel the cold rising in his body, the hopelessness and darkness. Again and again, he drowned. Every time it was the same routine, yet every new nightmare was worse than the one before. There was the Apocalypse wrecking the Earth. Hell was raised and Heaven had fallen. There were Leviathans roaming freely over the Earth, breeding and feeding on humans. Metatron enthroned in Heaven as the new God. All of creation devoured by the Darkness, or destroyed by Chuck. Everything they ever fought for, extinguished.
name. Everyone calls me Sam. So I think that’s my true name. Do you like it?”
“Would you agree to Castiel being inside of you, Dean?”
“Yes?” Dean echoed.
Trying to calm himself some more, embracing every single moment he was allowed to be in Cas’ arms, Dean inhaled his scent until he remembered this wasn’t a one time occurrence. He was about to marry his angel if he managed to get his shit together and man up.

“What should be with Cas? Why the hell do you all ask
“I wouldn’t say you did not find anything. You actually achieved the contrary. We can eliminate quite a lot.”
Realising what he just admitted, Dean froze, shell-shocked, terror written over all his being, gaping at his best friend who certainly would leave him for good now, who would flee in utter disgust. He would have already vanished when his wings weren’t broken like he’d done so often back in the days, always just flapping away when Dean got to intense.
"Oh, my poor sheltered baby," Dean mocked him, as he always did. "Damn it, Cas, we were fifteen. I thought you'd know. Who doesn’t know about porn by then? Besides, Gabe’s your older brother. I mean,
“Care to show me how deep I can fall?” Castiel replied.
Hearing was the first of his senses that returned. It sounded like a fight. Bodies collided, crashing together. Heavy breaths, grunts, and the piercing tone of metal cutting through air and slashing into flesh, reached his nonexistent ears. There was a woman, huffing. A gruff voice responded. Castiel stilled. He would recognise the voice anywhere, on every plane of existence. Dean. Dean was here, wherever
“Wait!” Swiftly, Dean rolled over and grabbed across Cas to reach the drawer of his nightstand. Opening it, he picked up the item he was looking for, gritting his teeth in doing so. The witch’s handiwork still hurt, though it would never stop him from the moment his dreams became reality. “Here, you’ll need this.” Dean handed the lube to Cas and let himself fall down back onto the bed, controlling his breath to steady his pulse.
“You finally finished gossiping about me?” Dean mumbled with his eyes still closed.
“Donna!” Jody exclaimed. “You made it!”
Raucous laughter erupted from where Dean was standing. His inner turmoil was still noticeable for Castiel and all the different feelings of the last hours and days now sought release through this display of utter levity. His brother’s statement had finally broken the levee. Castiel could understand him, although he only had a hunch of what Dean must have been through. They hadn’t even reacted to the sudden reappearance of Jack and Sam, and of Sully if his senses didn’t betray him. He suspected the Zanna tried to stay out of the line of fire for the time being.
Finally, finally, they’re at peace.
Dean launches himself from the ground ahead of another rush of the blackness reaching for Cas, knocking them both to the floor.
Alarm bells should be going off in Dean’s head if
Then, just as suddenly, he’s plunged back into darkness, heavy and dreamless.
It’s everything Dean ever wanted. If this is the end for real, at least Dean can finally say he died happy.
to be sorry for double-crossing us in the end.  He says he thought that getting back in Chuck’s good graces might’ve gotten him to bring Adam back.”
He senses his fiancé coming up the little pier before he even hears the footsteps, and looks behind him.  “Hey.”
As his sight finally focuses, he realizes that Sam looks like he got into a knife fight with an asphalt mixer, dripping with sweat and all covered in scrapes and smears of black.  Then he notices Jack standing over his shoulder and sees that he’s looking equally worse for wear.
Happy 1 Month Anniversary of Canon Destiel y'all, I fast-tracked getting this part done just for the occasion!  Thanks for coming along on this ride with me and I hope y'all enjoy the ending!  :D
“Of course, Dean. I will.”
“Human or being, Cas?” Dean inquired. “I just don’t want to run into some creature you accidentally overlooked.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas chuckled.
“Shuddup!” Dean mumbled.
Dean shrugged. "Thought you'd recognise. You’ve been around for ... ugh ... a shitload of time."
“You two will manage just fine.” He gave him a thump’s up.
*****
Soon, they arrived on the site, and, after Sam had parked the Impala, Castiel followed the younger Winchester outside. Dean didn’t stir, neither when the car stopped nor when the doors fell shut.
“Are you abandoning Sam if you leave him with me? You just asked Jody to do exactly that, babysit Sam for you. So, why don’t you trust me with the two of them?” Cas sounded deeply disappointed and hurt.
Straightening up, Dean searched Castiel’s eyes, trying to understand. “I still don’t know what that means for ...
*****
... finally –
Deep down during his dream, Dean could still fell the explosion and the heat, the adrenaline rushing through his veins, always accompanied by the world-shattering horror that embraced him the moment he realised his mother wasn’t there.
Castiel turned to see a young woman who he remembered as the principal’s secretary. She grinned at him maliciously before she turned and fled. Angel blade in hand, he was about to follow when a whimper reached his ears. There, where Sam had landed hard on the floor, lay a little boy with floppy brown hair. Castiel stopped in his tracks. Although following the witch was the logical action to take, taking care of Sam was far more important. If Sam had still been his actual age, Cas would have chased after her without a second thought, as long as Sam had displayed vital signs and he had known Sam was fine, or at least would be. After all, the hunter had been through far worse. However, he just couldn’t leave the little boy here alone in his current state.
“Heya, sunshine.”
As if Cas had read his thoughts, he was pulling out a chair for Dean and sat down on the chair right next to it.
Everyone laughed.
Suddenly, the door screeched and Dean stumbled back, releasing Castiel who immediately felt the loss. Sam’s head appeared in the gap of the opened door.
Right now, Dean was beautiful, so beautiful, radiating a happiness he rarely, probably never, had witnessed before. And he loved him. Dean loved him. He reciprocated his feelings. All of a sudden, the realisation threatened to overwhelm him. Tightening his wings around the man he had fallen for, and letting go of his hand that was still holding onto his, he cupped his friend’s face and brought their lips together. Dean gasped and buried his hands into the plumage on his back.
“Dean?” He could hear the fear in Cas’ voice and it broke his heart. They both were such a mess.
“Sam did, although with a slight ... hiccup.” Castiel stumbled over his phrasing. How was he supposed to tell Dean the news?
How could Dean have been so unconcerned, so credulous? He knew he probably shouldn’t worry, but then again his life had taught him differently. Over and over, and over again.
Sadness arose in Castiel. Without a hunt, Sam and Dean wouldn’t need him any longer and he didn’t want to overtax their welcome. Perhaps he could check up in Heaven, see how things were going. He dreaded it, but where else should he go?
“That still doesn’t answer my question.”
Sam glanced at him, irritated, and shrugged. “Whatever you say.”
“Your prayer.”
Wait. Had the bastard just used air-quotes while cupping his face and holding him? “Asshole! Screw you!”
For now, Dean needed to focus his concentration onto a different and far more pressing matter. The way from the door to his bed seemed a lot longer than he remembered, and despite his reassurance towards Cas, he wondered if he was able to reach his destination. He almost gave in and slumped down where he was standing, or more precisely, where he was being kept upright by the door.
Dean stared at his angel. Suddenly, Cas’ hand cupped the bulge in Dean’s jeans, causing Dean to fire a volley of swear words, muttered under his breath. “Son of a bitch! Cas, didn’t I say I want to take it slow?”
“Thank you, Sam. But you got it wrong. I call myself lucky that he has chosen me. He’s always been too good for me.”
“You once told me of your encounter with Sam’s imaginary friend, right before I ... You know.” Cas looked quite uncomfortable when he remembered that time. “Do you still have a way to contact the Zanna?”
Somewhere in between, the fighting sounds stopped and only Sam and Dean’s voices could be heard but Castiel didn’t pay attention. He was too absorbed into the words of Dean’s prayers. What did it all mean? Could it be? Could it really be? Could he have been so wrong? Had there been hope all that time?
too special. I wanna be able to enjoy every single step of it.” Dean couldn’t stop himself. The words kept coming.
“Thanks, Jack,” his brother smiled.
Castiel was yanked down towards Dean who had gripped both of his shoulders and crushed their mouths together. Moving and wiggling beneath him, Dean was searching for the best position to align their leaking erections. Both gasped in unison the moment he was successful.
Taking her time, Claire studied her opponent. She was young, five to seven years older than herself, max. Her brown hair was braided into one thick braid from which many stray hairs escaped in all directions. She certainly hadn’t seen a mirror since last night. While her brown eyes glared, the rest of her face seemed surprisingly calm.
. It’s been you for such a fucking long time.”
Cas’ hand rested on Dean’s back. It was a soothing presence and even though he would never admit it, he would miss the touch instantly. Dean had been too distracted by Jack’s words constantly replaying in his mind to even notice Cas’ hand before. Shaking his head to clear his still too vivid imagination, Dean forced himself to focus on other things.
Although Dean would probably later deny it had ever happened, he was whimpering.
“No,” Dean protested but his eyes already started to drop, although Castiel could tell he was fighting against it, watching Castiel’s every move. As soon as he was wearing his sleeping attire – despite his protest, Dean too had managed to put on the offered T-shirt – Castiel helped his friend lying down, and settled himself down next to him.
“Why are you so wise? I don’t deserve you.” Dean took the edge of the covers and buried himself into them, hiding the strain of red that covered his face and neck caused by a different reason than just moments before.
“He started it,” Dean grumbled. Immediately, he could feel a death stare on him. Slowly he turned to his left, facing Cas who still glared at him. “Oh, come on! I didn’t do nothing.”
“I could help.” A wicked grin split his face.
“Fuck you!” the witch snarled.
Dean embraced him, pulling Castiel down to lay on his bare chest, only to groan annoyed when he realised that Castiel was still completely dressed. His upset unmistakable, Dean grabbed his jacket and shirt and tugged at them fiercely, grumbling, “Off!”
Dean’s prayer was still ringing in his ears when he heard someone coming. And there he was, alive and well.
“Damn, right! I’m dying to see them.” Dean could feel his cheeks burning, the blush spreading over his face and probably down to his neck and shoulders as well. He gulped. "Your wings? They are part of you, your real form. Empire state building, four heads ... You know, that sort of things. Of course I’d love to see them. And you with wings in that body?” He let his eyes roam freely, feeling the shudder running over his whole body, fully aware that he couldn’t hide it from Cas. “Hell, yes!”
“You need to sleep.” It was a matter of fact.
The rural landscape was passing by in front of the window. Castiel watched it, but today his mind was occupied with something else. Listening to Dean’s regular breathing while his friend slept on the passenger seat was all he needed. He would prefer to watch his friend during their whole trip, but with Sam driving, he didn’t dare.
“Sunshine, love, you don’t need to do this.” Dean sat up, cupping the angel’s face with both hands and kissing down his way from Cas’ temple, over his eyes and nose to his mouth, Dean’s thumbs softly caressing his friend’s cheeks.
“No, but Dean has something he needs to tell you,” Donna answered and Cas frowned at her. “Hey, get up, Dean, and face your angel. Give us something that’s worth our movie night.”
“Straight, huh?” Dean just couldn’t keep a straight face, all puns intended. “Besides, that ain’t true. Those fuckers brainwashed you before.”
Hovering above Dean, his friend was beautiful. For a moment, Castiel just stared at him. His eyes were shining even more than usual due to his dilated pupils. His cheeks were reddened, and his lips swollen from their kisses. Dean’s breath was accelerated and his heart was racing.
Summary of the dream sequence:
He could feel it. Sense it with every fibre of his being. This place was danger personified and yet it felt far too familiar. Memories transported him back to the stream, to the moment Dean Winchester had found him. There he was, the man he had left in order to save him. At least that was what he had told him, what Castiel had to believe himself. And it was the truth, part of it anyway. Leviathans were hunting him. There was a target on his back and a bounty on his head. He who had freed them from their eternal prison and encaged them again, was the biggest beacon inside Purgatory. Far more interesting than the human he had left behind.
“And Cas?”
Dean couldn’t help himself and smiled at the reaction which definitely was so not cute. “Cooking is far more than numbers. It’s feeling and intuition. Let me show you.” The hunter dropped his duffel on the spot and went over to the counter where he stood right next to his best friend, their personal spaces once more dissolving. “What do you make?” Dean looked over to his left to meet the blue eyes of his friend.
“Thanks!” Dean grinned at his brother, before he glanced at Castiel and pressed their hands together even further. “Home?” he asked, his voice tender.
line, especially not here with his angel –
“Yes.” Cas nodded without severing their connection. “Yes, Dean, I meant it.” His voice was steady, but Donna saw tears welling up in his eyes.
“That’s bullshit, Cas. You might not sleep but, at least, you can make yourself comfortable over here.” Dean tapped the comforter on his right. “There’s still enough space for the both of us. It no memory foam for sure but it’s surprisingly comfy. You should try it.” His friend wiggled his eyebrows, smiling impishly.
She stepped right in front of him, boring her index into his chest. “Dean Winchester. You are the most annoying man I know. Come here.” With that she hugged him as tightly as she had Cas. “And don’t you dare to die again. It would devastate your brother.” On a softer note, she added, almost whispering as if it was just meant for him, “I’m happy for you two.”
“Huh?”
And suddenly, Dean couldn’t stand it any longer. Taking a step back and brushing off Cas’ hand, Dean looked up and shouted at his angel. “Damn it, Castiel! Of course, I want you to stay. Don’t you get it? I’ll fuck up our friendship because I want you! Hell, I want you! I want you more than anything in the world.”
Cas shut him up with a kiss. “You’re my Pi, because you gave my life a sense it never had before. Before, I was straight, like a line or a diameter, following Heaven’s orders without question.
Oh, Castiel would get Dean flying. He was eager to spread his wings.
Instead Dean started singing some Zepp which focused his racing thoughts and took the edge of, until he realised the first lines of “Dazed and Confused” were stuck to his mind. Shaking his head to shake off his confusing feelings, Dean started to use the bathroom for its intended purpose, splashed some water on his face, flushed the toilet, and eventually headed back out.
“Are you okay?” It was a question Castiel already knew the answer to, but he needed to know nonetheless.
“Cas, he doesn’t think he deserves you, and the part of him that probably still tries to please Dad knows Dad would never approve of you.”
Unable to voice his motives, he turned, and reached out, wiggling the fingers of his hand invitingly. The way Cas’ eyes lit up with the small gesture, was a stab to Dean’s heart. Hell, he didn’t deserve the faith Cas always entrusted him with. Gripping Dean’s hand, Cas followed him silently.
“Dude, what time is it?” Dean asked, yawning.
“College? High school? I can’t remember. It happened gradually. Does it matter?”
“Dean?” Cas asked, his voice tender.
“And idiot? Most certainly.” Castiel nodded.
There was nothing he could do to stop the growing flush on his face. Turning to face his angel fully, a thought struck him, and he frowned. “How come you didn’t realise yesterday at the diner?”
“I’m quite sure cupids had nothing to do with it, other than bringing your parents together”–Castiel squinted at Sam–“of course, there
Dean shied away. “Whatcha mean?”
"Take a guess." Dean grinned, taking a step back, and proudly gestured at the crude heap of metal.
“Dean.”
“Patience, love. Patience,” he mumbled into the skin but took pity with Dean and once again returned his attention to Dean’s crotch. Kissing and teasing with his tongue along the waistband, Castiel tried to use his teeth to lower the boxer shorts until he got frustrated with himself due to the slow speed, and rushed with his hands to pull them down, accidentally tearing them in the process.
Every twisted memory ended with Dean dying or with both of them dead. It went on and on, the entity was relentless. Castiel drowned countless times in his nightmares until there was no longer any shred of hope left. All that remained was pain and despair.
“Don’t you like me kissing your brother?” He had never imagined Sam not being happy for Dean.
Dean smiled back at his friend and after some kisses he never let become too hungry, he settled back, resting his head on Cas’ shoulder, closing his eyes, simply savouring the moment. With the warmth around him and Cas’ constant heartbeat, Dean slowly drifted off, the morning’s roller-coaster of emotions finally catching up with him, sending him into a peaceful sleep.
“No Dean, it was you.” Jack’s words caused Castiel’s head to swirl. Dean had saved him? Dean was responsible for him being here?
‘the point’?” Castiel used his hands to indicate the quote.
is anything.” Words that probably never were supposed to reach Castiel’s ears. Castiel was certain Dean wasn’t aware that he was uttering them out loud. Or was Dean even speaking them out loud? Were they some kind of prayer? One hand grabbing Castiel’s coat-lapel, Dean’s other arm was hanging loosely to his side. “I’ll mess up, I’ll push you away, you leave, of course you leave, why would you stay, you’ll d–” A single gasp stopped Dean’s rambling for a moment, “you ... you’ll die or I ... I can’t do this. Not again. Never again.” Dean’s voice finally broke and only barely noticeable sobs remained.
“Of course, Dean.”
“Uh, good night, Cas. Sleep well,” Dean eventually chimed in.
“I’ll take care of that!” Jack chimed in, beaming. And then he was gone. Just to reappear almost immediately with five take-out bags.
he was successful, there finally might be a reason to retire. He was tired and too old for this kind of lifestyle.
The cold gripped his feet and rose through his legs, numbing everything in its way. Suddenly, he knew exactly what was happening. He tried to fight it, struggling with all his force, but he soon had to realise that he wasn’t able to move any longer. The entity had bound him completely.
“You too, Dean.” Castiel smiled at his friend who shuffled into the room, closing the door with one last quick, yet intense glance. The scene left him feeling as if something else had lingered in the air, something unsaid. Though, it was probably his imagination caused by the tiredness that dragged him down. Despite his time in the Empty and his resulting repugnance towards enforced idleness, Castiel actually welcomed the thought of lying down and sleeping for once. So he turned and headed towards his usually neglected bed.
“This is you in 1951, isn’t it?” Sam asked, turning towards the principal, his gun already raised. “You don’t look a day older. Congrats for keeping up such a good shape. I think some of these kids on this photo are now staying here. Am I right? You de-aged them. Why?”
For now, Dean was fine, more than fine. His wings still tingled from the touches, sending sparks through his body and grace. Trying to suppress these feelings for now, Castiel wondered what “Later” would imply but was eager to find out.
“Okay. Okay.” Dean relented, taking both hands back on the wheel and especially looking at the road in front of them. “Happy now?”
Dean was still starring at the angel. “You don’t eat.” Sure thing, Winchester. He would take the dumbest remark and throw it at Cas. “Which doesn’t mean you can’t cook, which I don’t know if you can do, ‘cause I never saw you cooking since there was no reason for you to do it before ...” He let the rest of the sentence hanging in the air.
"Recognise what, Dean?" Confusion turned into irritation. Dean managed it every single time.
“You hated it.”
“Damn it, Cas, you are a freakin’ Angel of the Lord. You’re older than anything around. You’ve been around since before there was life on Earth. You visited Jurassic Park during its first grand opening. Look at me.” Dean gestured down his body. “What can I offer? I’m broken goods with a GED. I don’t know anything else than hunting. Fuck, I live with my brother in a secret underground facility when we’re not on the road, staying in crappy motels or in the car.”
online fandom. Nope, not to think back to some of the things that had burned his eyes there. Though, he had liked the musical. Those girls had done a damn good job, even though he never got the chance to see the second act.
“Come on, let’s get dressed, and get this show on the road,” Dean exclaimed giddily all of a sudden, hastening him to open his own bag.
had invited Sully into the bunker.
Hesitantly, Dean let go of Cas’ right shoulder in order to cup his jaw. When his thump was brushing over Cas’ cheek, his angel finally looked up. He could pinpoint the exact moment in the endless blue eyes he had missed so much, that he loved so much, when Cas understood.
Moreover, there's a scene that contains memories of suicidal ideation/suicide. If you need to, skip the paragraph that starts with
It didn’t take much. Only a few common ingredients and a drop of blood of a human who was in love and bound to a being inside the Empty was everything it took to open a doorway. The spell had to be cast by the lover. He had tried to hide it from them. However, his brother had demanded to see the spell work. Having the superior knowledge in witchcraft between the two of them, Sam had a point. So, eventually he had relented and spilled everything. The look Sam threw him afterwards was even sadder than before.
“You should sleep,” Castiel told his boyfriend who snuggled against Castiel’s chest.
Dean looked at Cas who shrugged his shoulders and said, “She’s probably right.”
“Na, it’s nothing,” Dean mumbled. “It’s just pie. Happy Pi Day! Want some? I was just getting some plates and forks. Anyone else?” He was already on his feet and looked through the cupboards. “Cas? More coffee? Eggs? Bacon? Hash browns?”
*****
– definitely not with Cas in the other room.
“And then I prayed. I called you. I called your name. Your full name. For the first time since– since–”
“You mean Jack is less of a danger here than when he comes with us. Don’t you, Dean?” Cas sounded annoyed.
“Of course, knowing us, there will be hardships, fights and probably the end of the universe. Jack is committed to find a way to breech into that other universe to save Mary. You know what will happen if anyone of us tries such a thing.”
“I know you won’t.” Castiel brushed his hand over Dean’s rough stubble, unable to resist the magnetic draw this man always had on him. “But you won’t be fully awake either.”
Soon after, they reached the bunker, and Dean steered Baby to her usual parking spot in the garage.
“You still want me?”
“You shouldn’t feel compelled to anything you aren’t comfortable with. I want you to be happy.”
“Give or take a day,” Sam answered.
It didn’t take more. Despite their years of longing and misunderstandings, right now they knew exactly what the other was thinking, and mutually decided to forego all further explanation. It had been a narrow escape for both of them. Their fears and insecurities for now buried under the rushing emotions of both of them being alive, they bathed in the closeness of each other.
How could he be this lucky? This could not be real. It was impossible. Even Cas’ thumb brushing softly over his knuckles couldn’t reassure him. This had to be some kind of dream. Sooner or later it all would fall apart, and the other shoe would drop. He knew it. It was his life. Perhaps he was really dead and Jack only had changed the rules of Heaven. Or had they never defeated Chuck at all? Or a Djinn? This could be a Djinn dream.
“You’re my Pi, Dean.”
The last months, after he had lost Cas, had been the worst he had ever experienced and had been very eye-opening. Cas’ words had forced him to reflect on himself. But most of all, he had missed him. He had missed Cas’ eyes, deep like the ocean, a vastness he wanted to lose himself in. It was a place he felt safe, a place that gave him hope. He had missed Cas’ tiny smiles when the corners of his mouth shot up. Cas just needed to smile more. Though every time he did, the sun came out from behind the clouds, lighting his inner darkness, and it gave him the feeling that there was more to life than surviving. It was a promise to a life he never had been allowed to live, a life that wasn’t his. From their very first meeting, Cas had believed in him, told him that good things did indeed happen.
It was an awkward moment, both of them standing right in front of each other, mere inches between them. Both of them were invading their personal spaces and lost in each other’s eyes, yet wary to return to the closeness they had just shared.
“Listen to me, Dean.” The angel stared at him like this was the most important thing he had ever said. “You’re not broken now, and you never were. Despite all your ordeals and hardship your soul remained intact. It still shines brighter than anything I ever experienced. You’re beautiful. You changed me, Dean. Everything you have ever done, you have done for love.”
“Aren’t I? What a shame. I was looking forward to it.” The witch drawled and she even had the nerve to wink.
However, he trusted the kid enough to be safe in the bunker. Not that he would admit that out loud. Jack wouldn’t turn his powers against the people nearest to him as long as he wasn’t threatened, and, at the same time, the bunker was the safest place to keep Jack safe from other parties.
“You died in another universe. Is there only one superhell or what?”
Earlier he had found the two frightened boys and returned them home, or at least what remained of it. Before he had left them in good care, soon to be reunited with their mother, he had altered their memories, taking away the most horrible images but leaving their knowledge of what had happened. He could have changed that, too, but experience had shown that a gap in memories comprised in most cases a danger of mental disorder. The probability was even higher than that of a mental health illness due to their trauma. As much as he would have liked to help further, he could only hope they would be okay. The human mind was far trickier to heal than the body, even with an angel’s grace.
When they entered the room, Dean seemed unhappy with her choice.
“I’m fine with that, Sammy.” Castiel knew he was, now even more than ever before.
It would have been so easy to touch Dean’s hair and to caress his friend. But it was impossible. Not only because of Sam, even though the younger Winchester’s attention was solely on the road, but because of the man himself. Dean wouldn’t approve. At first, he would leash out and then he would retreat even further into himself and ignore Castiel for the rest of the day, maybe longer. His anger would break Castiel’s heart once again.
“You. Come here, sunshine.”
But since this wasn’t real anyway – it just couldn’t be - there was no harm in saying it. Right? Right.
From there on, it all went by in a blur. Sammy was standing behind him as his best man, tears in his eyes. Claire had volunteered to do the honours for Cas, and had teased Dean from the very first moment they stepped before the altar. Jack had decided to do the ceremony by himself instead of kidnapping some random priest or registrar. That meant they were married by their three year old who also happened to be the new God. It wasn’t the weirdest thing that had happened to him in his life but it came damn close.
It took them a while to get up after Dean had initiated a full-blown tickle war. Eventually, Cas lifted a giggling Sammy to his shoulders, before he helped Dean to his feet.
“I’m here.” Sully sheepishly peeked around the doorframe to one of the corridors.
“Before– before–,” Dean spluttered. “Damn it, Cas! Don’t look at me like
*****
Castiel just grinned at his friend who was still adoringly mussed from making out.
“Hey, sunshine!” This whole thing still felt surreal. Waking up next to his angel had already turned into one of his most favourite things ever. Grinning wickedly, Dean dove in and stole a kiss. This time, despite his body still hurting way too much, it quickly got hungrier. Letting his tongue hover over Cas’ lips, Dean nibbled at Cas’ upper lip and eventually his angel opened up. Tongues languidly explored, flicking over teeth and wrestling each other. They only parted when Dean needed to take a breath, Cas already chasing after him, forgetting a mere human’s dire need for oxygen in his unwillingness to sever their connection.
“I’m an angel.”
Those were certainly not the words he should use. “Uh, actually, Cas ...” Dean scratched the back of his head. “I ... Damn it. I’m not. Not okay. It’s ...” He took a deep breath. “Can we talk?”
Cas’ hands found the back of his head, his body shifted until his thigh was between his legs, creating a friction that left Dean lightheaded and yearning for so much more. He could feel Cas’ hardening dick pressing against his hipbone. Hands were roaming everywhere, lips following shortly behind. It was messy, both of them exploring the other’s body freely for the first time, getting to know each other’s needs. Soon, their shirts were gone and they were skin to skin. For a moment, Dean just wanted to lie there, on top of his angel, feeling his heartbeat, engulfed by his otherworldly scent, finally allowed to touch, to be with him. But then Cas moved his hips and Dean was a goner.
“Hey, assbutt!” When Michael turned, Castiel threw the Molotov cocktail, peppered with a dose of holy fire, towards him, creating the vital moment Dean needed alone with his brother to get through to Sam. This was all he could do to save them. Michael’s eyes set on him and instantly Castiel could feel himself disintegrating. What a weird experience.
His hand found Cas’ nape again, even though he actually had never lost contact ever since he had woken up. When his fingers caressed the short hair, travelling to the soft skin behind Cas’ ear, the angel stirred, rubbing his sleepy face over Dean’s shoulder, slowly opening his eyes. They were staring at him, deep and so blue, filled with adoration and love. An embarrassingly broad smile crept over Dean’s face. This. This was what he wanted to wake up to every morning for the rest of his life.
“I couldn’t find much about them through my online research that could help. None of them was a well-known member of society. They all seemed to live quiet, normal lives as far as I can tell. I couldn’t find any patterns. They didn’t live in the same neighbourhood. Many of them disappeared all over town, a few even from remote farms; but everyone vanished near or in their home. Some lived in apartment complexes, others in their own homes in the suburbs, some in retirement homes. Even their ages ranged from the youngest at sixty-five to the oldest at ninety-two. Some were Garden City natives and others came from all over the states. One even was an immigrant from Europe. Some lived on their own while others lived with family members or close friends. Some had great-grandkids and others never married. There is nothing that they all have in common as far as I can tell.” He sighed. Usually, his research gave him some clues. This time, it had failed him, at least so far.
“Jesus Christ! Castiel? That really you? What’s happening?” Sam’s confused voice sounded through the barn.
“I will. Bye, Ernie! Bye, Bert!” And with that, she ended the call.
“Hell, yes!” Dean grinned against Castiel’s skin. Castiel could feel it. “If you show me how to fly, angel.”
Dean huffed. Of course Cas couldn’t understand. And if he did it would be too late. Their friendship would be history. “Sure you do. You always leave.”
“Yeah?” Dean still sounded far too vulnerable, yet at the same time hopeful.
“Of course, I will, my love,” Castiel reassured him.
“I am, especially if you are. And I would love to rediscover every inch of the body I once rebuilt atom by atom.”
They arrived at their destination after the sun had already set. Dean had called Claire and now steered Baby in the parking lot of a decent looking motel where she was already staying and had reserved a room for them.
At once, Dean could feel three pairs of eyes staring at him. Glaring warningly at Sam, Dean turned towards his best friend who had raised one eyebrow questioningly. Fuck, Dean wanted nothing more than to kiss the bastard, see if he could wipe that smug expression from Cas’ face. But Dean was a coward. Always had been and always would be. So he swallowed his feelings and just stared back.
“Yes, Dean. I told you before. Heaven is taken care of and they don’t need me. I’m done with it.”
Cas’ index finger lightly touched Dean’s face, wiping away a stray tear. Another burst of grace flooded through his body. “That’s better,” Cas stated. At the same time, all traces of tears vanished from Cas’ face. Taking Dean’s hand in his, they finally made the rest of their way. Miracle was following behind, jumping happily.
Cas looked up, “I love you too, Dean.”
Looking sadly at Cas who stared at him questioningly, Dean scrambled backwards out of the bed. His feet hit the bunker’s cold stone floor, and his head cleared a bit.
“What? Now?” Dean stared at Jody.
“Dean.” He didn’t need to see Sam’s face to see the concern, he could hear it in his voice.
? Been searching for you for an hour.”
Hands were soothingly brushing over his back. Minutes passed, or hours, he wasn’t sure. It didn’t matter. Cas was here, and for the first time in years, probably forever, Dean felt safe.
The questions kindled a storm of emotions inside Castiel. At first, he felt anger. How could Dean always think so little of himself? Then, Castiel wanted nothing more than to hold Dean and tell him he was worth all the love he could get. Underneath it all lingered a sadness. They could have had it all, years ago, it seemed. They had lost so much time.
“You do?” Dean looked up, stroking his thigh nervously, his fingers barely brushing Castiel’s.
Dean’s eyes shot up and he gaped at Castiel. His jaw vibrated, but no words left his lips.
Looking at Dean, his feelings were mirrored on his friend’s features. Dean’s mouth was opened in wonder and his eyes rested on him, wandering over his body. When they found Castiel’s eyes once again, they were gleaming, and a single tear threatened to fall.
Dean shot him another cutting glance before returning his attention to his brother. “You hungry, Sammy?” The boy just shrugged, leaning tiredly, though contently, into the older Winchester. So Dean once more turned to him. “Cas, did you feed him?”
“Yes, exactly,” Jack confirmed, “Their profound bond is unique. They never lost it, and neither could it be stopped by different planes of existence. Wherever they are, Dean’s prayers will always reach Castiel.”
It didn’t matter. He had known. Deep down he had known all along there was a way to save Cas. Interpreting his smile, Jack had always known as well.
It was his metaphor so he was allowed to stick with it.
Castiel pressed Dean down on the ground with one hand, his wings still spread behind him. Once again he kissed his husband before his lips moved downwards. Dean tilted his head back, inviting Castiel to examine his neck further. And Castiel blissfully complied.
They turned towards Dean, looking at him expectantly.
*****
Letting go of the T-shirt, Castiel brushed the tear away with his thumb before he tightly embraced the human who had taught him what it meant to love. Dean started to shiver, and slumped down in Castiel’s arms, his exhaustion finally catching up with him.
“Of course I’m right, old man.” Claire rolled her eyes.
“You didn’t have the pleasure yet,” Cas deadpanned.
“Gotcha! We’re leaving. It’s time to say your goodbyes. I have to thank you. You actually made my decision quite easy. Oh, and don’t forget to pay and tip generously. I have a promise to keep. Not that you’ll need that money of yours anymore.”
“I can do that, love,” he said, solemnly.
Turning around, he looked at Cas who was standing right there, grinning. Dean was faster in his arms than he would have thought possible. He was turning into a bloody sap. But guess what? Sue him. Burying his head in the bend between Cas’ shoulder and neck, Dean’s lips hovered over the exposed skin.
He wanted to run to his friend, make sure he was okay, but first Castiel had to deal with the witch. While he was turning towards her, a shot fired through the room but Claire’s bullet only grazed the witch. Claire already was back on her feet and blocked Castiel’s direct line of attack. Still focused mainly on Dean, Castiel nevertheless threw his angel blade. But between his thoughts for Dean and trying to spare Claire, his charge was not successful. With only the witch’s blouse shredded and her ribcage scratched, she was still able to escape. His blade stuck mockingly inside the door frame.
“I love you, you asshole.”
Dean rolled his eyes, but got up and pulled Castiel with him. “We probably should have told him,” he whispered in Castiel’s ear and placed a kiss on the shell, before he called out to his brother, “We’re here Sam.”
“What are you waiting for? The next apocalypse?” Jody challenged him. “With Jack running things that’ll be a long wait. At least let’s hope so. Don’t waste any more time. Call him.”
wasn’t his time. She didn’t want him because she still needed his services. Dean should have known. Once a tool, always a tool. So he returned to his body, and his life. And then suddenly the phone had rung. It still made him shiver every time he thought about it. He had killed himself right before he got Cas back. Cas most probably had already been back when he had pushed the needle in, Dean just hadn’t known by then. Shakespeare would have frigging loved that.
“What the hell are you doing?” Dean kicked himself internally. His senses – olfactory, visual and acoustic – all told him the same thing: the angel was obviously cooking.
Castiel looked up at the younger Winchester, realising he was clutching Dean tightly in his arms, one of his hands absently stroking Dean’s face, his head, and his upper body. “Do you think this is real?”
Jack turned to him and smiled, while Sammy giggled, “We flew a kite! It was great! And then Jack –
Silently, Dean took Cas’ hand in his and opened the door, inviting his angel in. Inside, Cas gave the door a kick with his heel, closing it with a loud thump. Standing there and staring at each other, Dean was dumbstruck. All those years he had pictured this moment, fighting it and shutting it down as soon as it appeared in his mind. Now that he was finally allowed to embrace it, allowed to look without fear of being discovered, his heart raced and he felt completely overwhelmed, unable to move a limb.
“... and the crust for the apple pie ...”
When Dean was right behind him, an arm holding a plate appeared next to Castiel.
Dean turned in his arms just enough to be able to look at him. “Did you just sniff me?” a broken, yet still challenging voice enquired.
. How am I supposed to keep a clear head?”
“As you wish.”
*****
“What about Cas?” Kaia inquired, leaning her head on Claire’s shoulder.
“I did. It went right through me.” Dean grinned at him. “It felt kinda amazing. Can– can I do it again.”
“Look at you, laddie! You're radiating.” She stepped in front of him and grabbed his cheeks, before she embraced him tightly. It was their ritual. “My wee precious boy. What brings you to visit your old auntie Rowena?”
For whatever reason, the waitress grinned at her conspiratorially, gave her the thumbs up and let Claire be.
“What’s next for you? Any chance you’ll come to see us at the bunker?” Sam asked.
What did
Dean scratched his neck. “Uh, actually, that’s the reason we called.” He turned and called into the library. “Sammy! Jack! We’ve got a visitor.”
“Mary Poppins is a Zanna, too, Dean. Did you know?” Sammy kicked enthusiastically, bouncing on his shoulders.
“You fell easily back into the role of sole protector of your brother. But you are not alone, Dean. You have friends who will always be ready to help you. You don’t have to fight on your own. Not anymore. I wish you would understand that.”
Listening to the hushed singing sounding from the bathroom, Castiel counted himself lucky to be as close to Dean as he let him, though it never would be enough. The one thing he wanted was something he knew he couldn’t have.
Cas’ eyes widened in understanding. “You’re tired,” he stated. “I should have realised sooner.”
He looked up to the other side of the library where Sam and Eileen had a vivid, yet silent, conversation, laughing, touching each other. Those two were as happy as anyone could be right now. Despite the sting in his heart, a tiny smile threatened to erupt on his face. No blurry wife in sight, thank fuck. He still couldn’t decide if his or Sam’s fate had been worse.
As if Dean had felt his longing, his friend turned towards him, looking up. When his eyes fell on Castiel, Dean was smiling over his whole face. His eyes were shining. Castiel let his own eyes wander down, freely, and without fear of his feelings towards his best friend being discovered, admiring the body he once had rebuilt atom for atom. When he looked up, Dean was still staring, his cheeks flushed, and his breathing and heartbeat accelerated.
“You’re welcome. I hope they took pictures of baby you. “
All of a sudden, Dean was in his arms, Dean’s hand on his face, and Dean’s lips moving against his own. Castiel couldn’t believe his luck. Dean Winchester was kissing him and Castiel kissed back, reciprocating and eager to copy every move of Dean’s.
Castiel swallowed. Hope rose inside him. “You do?”
“I’m fine. I’m always fine.” Dean forced a grin to his face, looking at his friend who raised both eyebrows in disbelief before lowering his eyes sadly to the floor.
got you back.”
“Yeah, I know, molecules. But it’s pie!” Dean still was far too chipper compared to his usual early morning routine. His eyes were gleaming and a wide grin was spreading across his face.
Realising, Dean reciprocated his feelings and he actually could have had what he had wanted for years, was freeing in a way he hadn’t expected. Happiness was in just being, in just saying it. He hadn’t been wrong. Being one’s own self and speaking his truth was freeing in a way he never had anticipated.
“Don’t take too long.” Dean forced a smile. He didn’t need to beg or add a “Please”. Castiel heard him loud and clear. Even more so, Dean broadcasted a panicked “Don’t go! Don’t leave me!” with all his being.
“Yes, and it’s important that you feel what you’re feeling. It shows that you’re regretting what has happened. You know exactly what impact the death of a man has. It shows how good you are. But it was a tragic accident. Accidents happen. Dean or Sam or I might have shot the man by accident. You tried to help. You didn’t know he was coming out of the bank the moment you used your powers. He could have flown anywhere but he hit the pillar. It was a string of random coincidences that let to this tragic outcome. Take one part out of it and it would not have happened. And that part needn’t be your powers. Jack, it was not your fault the man died. It might seem so, but it was an accident.”
“Taking it slow, remember.” Dean sighed. “I wanna get acquainted with your body, learn about what you want, before ... you know ... before we take it any further.”
“Don’t ever do that again,” Sam insisted, pushing his brother from their embrace, and grabbed him by his shoulders.
“Thought so. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
“Bullshit! Nobody owns you. You once saved me from Perdition, now it’s my turn. Come on.” He took Cas’ hands in his and yanked him upwards until he was standing on wobbly legs, half hugging Dean.
Cas kept on talking. “Or we find someone you trust enough to watch over the two back here. Then we’re free to go on a witch hunt. The decision is up to you. However, we’ll need to act soon.”
“What are you afraid of, Dean?” Stepping closer, Cas didn’t let him off the hook, touching his chin and guiding his face towards him until they were once again looking at each other.
“See, easy as pie and heavenly made.” Dean beamed at him when Sam loudly entered the kitchen with Jack in tow after they were called to dinner.
His new status allowed him to enter Hell's throne room without a problem and Jack used it to visit Rowena quite frequently.
“Shh.” Dean put his index finger over Cas lips, shushing him. “You’re the most selfless being I know. You always did what you thought was right, not once questioning what it meant for you. You single-handedly saved Heaven and stopped a freakin’ Apocalypse and no one ever thanked you for it. No one ever told you that you’re loved. No one told you how much you’re loved. How much you mean to us, how much you mean to
Deep down Dean knew Cas was right. It was the most reasonable thing to do instead of waiting for Jody or another pair of eyes to look after his brother. He just couldn’t bear the thought of losing Cas too, not with Sammy in his current state. Moreover, he had just got the angel back. No way would he risk losing him again. “We’ll burn that bridge when it comes to that. First, let me talk to Jody. Perhaps we’ll already have Samantha back by then. We might be lucky and the spell weakens over time.” He didn’t believe any of his words.
“Why not start now?” Castiel enjoyed the situation far too much to stop already. As long as Dean was occupied by Sam there was no danger of a stray angel blade coming near to him. Otherwise, he knew better than to tease the hunter too much.
“Aww!” Sam sighed. Dean’s gaze flew to his brother who was mimicking a swoon, both hands pressed over his heart.
Castiel could only imagine Dean’s reaction to this suggestion. But Dean wasn’t here and Castiel actually agreed with Sam. “Let’s go.”
Castiel glared at Dean, ignoring the
“Cas? You coming?” Sam called. Castiel sighed and walked in Sam’s direction, but not without another glance at Dean who was still sleeping peacefully in his car.
*Home,* Eileen offered.
The hunter smiled broadly. “Dude, you’re making burgers? Dean burgers?”
“Then I’ll call you Cas, too,” Sammy declared proudly.
“I can help you with that. I’ll fly you back to the bunker and return here so Dean and I can follow as soon as we are finished.”
“Do you think I will get a dog for my birthday like my brother?”
So, while Dean and Jody prepared dinner, Donna had a mission to plan. By the time everybody sat down to eat, they were all on board, except for Dean who was as oblivious as ever.
Following his gaze, Dean grinned. “Oh! I totally forgot. That’s the best part.” He ran towards the box, still on bare feet. Sam hadn’t brought them any footwear, though it was probably for the best on the beach, anyway.
Moreover, he wouldn’t even have been able to say a thing. His vocal chords refused to work and he could feel a lump in this throat.
Dean froze slack-jawed, still processing his angel’s pointed remark while Sam started coughing heavily.
“Shh! Come here.” Dean opened his arms and Cas followed the invitation immediately, burying his head on Dean’s chest, still sniffling. For years and years, every time they had hugged had been an Earth-shattering event for Dean. Now he couldn’t even keep track of their hugs any longer. Kissing the top of Cas’ head, he smiled. “Love you.”
“Understatement of the year. I’m just a blip in your life. Blink and I’m gone.”
“I have my share of experience. I’ve been around for a while.” Castiel let his fingers brush through Dean’s hair, hoping the touch would help the human.
Donna took a deep breath. The whole room felt taut. Everyone waited for the moment when their friends would finally manage to get it together. These two simply couldn’t evade each other any longer.
“I am,” the boy stated, smiling, talking and signing simultaneously. “Heaven is fully powered now. That was one of the things I had to take care of. With far too few angels around it was still in danger to collapse which would have set all the souls free. But with me and Amara up there, we prevented that. She's back in her own body, by the way. Solving that problem, she helped me find a way to reopen the gates, so all fallen angels can use their wings again.”
Castiel didn’t pay attention to how long they were staying this way. It didn’t matter. Nothing did matter as long as Dean was resting in his arms. Even Sam and Jack were forgotten for a moment. Eventually, Dean had calmed himself enough to let go and Castiel reluctantly obliged, probably letting his fingers linger an instant too long in the soft hair before retreating his hand.
“Since the Empty took me. And I heard you. I heard your prayer, Dean. I heard everything. Suddenly, I remembered. All your prayers came back to me. My grace returned and finally I was able to fight back. The Empty surrendered and vanished. I stretched my wings and at once was back on Earth. Right in time to save you.”
*****
With every kiss Dean grew hungrier until he breathlessly drew away. “Stop!” He was panting heavily.
With a whoosh of his wings, Cas was gone. Dean immediately felt as if something vital was missing, a cold was settling into his bones, and his anxiety spiked. Caught off guard, he turned his feelings into anger, swallowing the rising panic. Cas was okay. He would come back. He always came back. He got Cas back. Cas was back and he loved him.
“All knowing God, my ass,” Dean grumbled and Sam snickered. “Shut up!” The older Winchester pointed accusingly at his brother who raised his hands in defeat, especially after having additionally received a chiding clap from Eileen.
“So fine, you can’t remember how to greet a friend properly. Come here!” With that, Donna stepped forward, turned Dean around, and embraced him tightly.
“I may not fully comprehend what you try to convey, but how long have you yearned to say that?”
Suddenly, a four-year-old crashed into them, jumping between them into his brother’s lap, and hugged both of them as tightly as his short arms allowed it.
“Careful, Dean. The street!”
Dean messed up, again. Why had leaving Sammy and Jack with Sully sounded like a good idea? He’d pulled a typical Dean Winchester. Stupid, stupid, stupid! And why hadn’t he pulled the trigger? This fucking witch...
A well-known trench coat came into his line of sight, though their usual seats were swapped. Cas was driving! Cas was driving Baby, for hell’s sake! Despite the pain – Dean had had far worse, anyway – he quickly sat up and stared at the angel.
“Point taken.” Dean looked at him before he lowered his eyes, his features turning shy. “Will you stay?” he added, barely audible.
“So, what the hell are you doing? Where the heck are we? What’s with the wicked witch? You blast her into oblivion?” With every word Dean got more agitated. “All I remember is that that bitch taunted me and threatened to take all of Sammy’s life energy. I ...
Dean found himself being steered backwards as their mouths explored each other, one step after the other, until his back hit Baby with a thump. But Cas didn’t stop there. Crowding Dean’s space, he firmly pressed their bodies together. There was no way Dean could hide his body’s reactions any longer. Cas’ leg was between Dean’s, his thigh pressing against Dean’s crotch.
Slowly Castiel tilted his head, a shy smile on his face. One minute turned into two, then three, five, possibly ten, and Castiel would easily have been standing there the whole day.
“He’s mine,” they snarled. “Mine.”
“They’ll know soon enough. There’s no need to wake them. Normally, I don’t need sleep and, therefore, would be awake when the first of them gets up in the morning. But since I used my power to heal you ...”
Then again, they all already knew that a kill ended the spell. So there was no need to keep the witch alive any longer. And it would an easier drive back towards Kansas if Claire was on her own. She could picture Cas’ frown easily, always trying to keep her safe. But Claire was a hunter and
Before they left the library Dean turned, pointing with his finger at the Zanna. “You! No leaving the bunker. Capiche?”
Sully laughed heartily when Jack brought Sam a phone. “Sam, it’s Claire. She tried to call Cas but she wasn’t successful. So she tried your number. Here. Cas took it to keep it safe and put it into the War Room until you could use it again.”
“You did! You took Billy with you. I was no longer in danger.”
He was rocking on his knees, pressing the heels of his hands to his eyes, trying to control his breathing. This was getting ridiculous. And still, he couldn’t stop it as much as he wanted. Sam was okay. Of course, he was okay. And Cas– he would be back. He had promised to be back. Cas had come back to him. Cas loved him.
While Sam was driving, Cas skipped through their gathered information on the senior citizens turned toddlers. “Sam, we might have overlooked a vital piece of evidence. All of the victims, at least those of whom we have the necessary information, came to Garden City no later than at the age of preschoolers, which is exactly the age they were transformed into.”
When Castiel stepped forward, Dean held him back, closing the remaining distance between them, and kissed him on the neck, right beneath his ear.
Dean’s eyes flew open, his arms lashed out at Castiel, but before he did anything else, he stared at Castiel and asked, huskily, “Cas? What the hell?” Looking around and taking in the location, he frowned. “What the‒ ? Where are we? Where’s Sam?”
Sam grew squirmy in his arms, so Dean let him down. “Why don’t you two look for Jack while I cook? Sounds good?”
The chatter that had picked up around the table while he had been lost in his inner musings, stopped at once.
Dean gulped. Without another thought, he ran towards Cas’ lifeless form, ignoring the entity and the archangel completely. Falling to his knees, he gripped his friend tightly by his shoulders, shaking the vessel that had become Cas’ body a long time ago.
“I wouldn’t mind,” Castiel answered. “Yes,I think I would like that.” He nodded when Sam looked at him in the rear mirror. “But what about Dean?” Frowning, Castiel could only imagine Dean’s reaction.
“It seems you have missed me,” Cas teased.
Dean’s hand was back in his hair, caressing him. “It’s okay, baby. I’ve got you,” Dean whispered, soothingly, “I’ve got you.”
Castiel laid a hand on Dean’s to stop him, afraid Dean might set himself on fire or cause an explosion. “What, Dean?”
“Okay, let’s do this.” Once again, Dean reached for Cas’ hand but the angel stopped him.
“Uh ... Yeah. Guess so. Dude, he accidentally killed a man. We don’t know what else he’ll do when he’s actually threatened.”
. You two can’t go on like this. Not again.”
“I never heard of such a day.”
Castiel grinned broadly, teasing, “Did I do that right?”
He stepped into Dean’s space. At once, Dean closed the remaining inches and was back in his arms, breathing heavily. “We can still cancel everything,” Castiel said quietly with a calmer voice than he felt himself. Had he rushed things? Were they actually ready to take this huge step in their relationship? After all, they were only together since yesterday, even though it felt like years. And yet, he never wanted to be apart from Dean for another day.
Don’t tell me you’re not in Kansas anymore.”
Castiel nodded approvingly at that. Vegetables certainly would improve Dean’s diet.
“Oh, no, no. I like this. This is fun. You have woken me. You made it loud. So now you will pay for it.”
“You okay?” Donna asked. Concern layered her words.
If Cas only knew what he did to him every time he looked at him like that. It was like drowning in an ocean without knowing if one would ever hit the bottom. The sheer vastness of them never let him forget that despite his stunning outside appearance Cas wasn’t human. Cas was so much more, so much more intimidating and completely out of his range. And yet, every time Dean drowned in those eyes he wanted to let himself fall and completely give himself over to his best friend.
For a moment, there had been a tiny spark of hope. Only to be crushed like an ant under the foot of a giant. Lucifer, the cockroach, had done what he had always done best. He had used others’ emotional weaknesses and hopes and had exploited them for his own gain. Of course, the fucker had chosen him. Although he hadn’t told anyone of Cas’ last words, somehow angels and demons had always known. They had taunted and teased him, them, as long as he could remember. No wonder that bastard had targeted him now. It was a low blow but right now he didn’t expect anything less.
Cas looked unbelievingly at him, an eyebrow cocked mockingly.
“Yes. Those seniors never met, at least not recently. Some even haven’t been able to leave their homes for years. I don’t think it’s a cursed object. How could the object have affected only those it was meant for? No, that would be far too many coincidences. And we’ve never come across a monster that de-ages its victims. There are some in the lore, but none of them fit our pattern.” Sam sounded convinced and Castiel could follow his reasoning easily. He was right, a witch was most probable.
“Like? Geez, Cas, I should have bought you new clothes years ago.”
Outside he fished for his phone and dialled Dean. He hoped his friend would keep calm and clear-headed.
Despite the gigantic hole in his heart, it had helped. What they had done mattered for their friends. Their wellbeing had been worth fighting for. There were still people around who cared for him, for whatever they saw in him. Maybe, just maybe, Cas had been right. Those were people, family, he couldn’t let down. If not for himself, he would at least try to keep living on for them.
“You got it, kiddo.” Dean sighed relieved.
“I take it you want me to continue,” Cas deadpanned, knowing full well what he did to Dean. This big tease.
“Dean? What the hell are you talking about?” Sam asked, confused, frowning at him.
“So you’re sayin’ that for all those years we were both a pair of dumbasses?”
“Huh?”
No, now he was ridiculous but he still doubted their newly found closeness. He doubted the reality of their romantic relationship. Being honest to himself, the doubt that this was real would not leave his mind. He was still nurturing the thought that this was some kind of dream. It had to be because it was the most logical conclusion.
franchise. It was hilarious. She even was kind of cute like this. Nope! That was the wrong train of thought.
“You’re a frigging killjoy, you know that, right?” Dean grumbled, “Can’t you just mojo me up?” He wiggled his eyebrows, new hope visible on his face.
“Cas, you’ll have a slice, won’t you?” Dean sounded hopeful.
“I’m aware of that, Dean,” Cas deadpanned, only increasing the stare before he turned it once again at his burger. Finally, he took a bite. Immediately, his eyes widened. “Oh! I like that!” Taking another bite, a gummy grin split his face. “I like that very much! This makes me very happy.” Some of the burger sauce was running down the corner of his mouth and Dean used the chance to kiss it away. “This, too, makes me very happy.”
Severing the connection finally, Castiel let his gaze wander down along Dean’s body, only stopping right in front of where he was kneeling. A tiny smile flit over his face, and when he abandoned his pants for a short moment to let his fingers brush over Dean’s erection, he looked back up at his gasping husband.
“Damn it, Cas. Just lemme work, okay?”
Thanks to Jack, everyone was back. Charlie was the first one to call. When she had come home, Stevie had been there waiting for her. Good for them. That was at least one happy ending. They deserved it. But it hurt. It hurt so fucking much when he could clearly make out her happiness over the phone.
Suddenly, Dean realised that he was still holding Cas’ hand in his. None of them had let go of each other.
As soon as Sam had interrupted them, Dean’s right hand had wandered down and found Castiel’s lower back, still resting there now. The closeness and heat between them, standing only inches apart and next to each other, combined with vivid images Dean provided, Castiel’s mind wandered, especially after Dean’s hand started to move even lower. He imagined Dean bent over the War Table, pinned beneath him, completely giving himself over to Castiel. Although he used the power of his grace to control it, his body reacted immediately to the vivid pictures his mind created.
“Wait!”
However, there would be no pie festival hunts for him in the near future, just to be safe. It wouldn’t be difficult. Since Cas, pie had lost all appeal for him. Too many happy memories were tied to it.
“And I’m telling you, you should know what it is. That’s all.” Rolling his eyes, Dean let Castiel step next to his work. “Come on. Have a look.”
Castiel screamed in utter terror, waking from a dream, a nightmare he never experienced before. Opening his eyes, there was darkness all around him, and finally, he remembered. Although his senses were dampened, he could feel their presence. They were here, still grasping him, still drowning him. Their snarl sounded like laughter, mocking him, torturing him.
As Jack had predicted, it took them a while till they finally walked into the library to a chorus of cheers and hollering. Their necessary detour to the bathroom and the wide space of the shower stalls had taken them a lot more time than they had anticipated.
Waking from a dream like that, only to stare into the deep blue eyes that met his the moment Dean opened them had shook him to his bones.
With every word and every step the tugging became stronger and with it, he became bolder.
They both just stared at each other for what felt eternity.
Dean muted the show, when Jack appeared on one of the chairs.
Sully jumped back at the swearword, covering his ears and glowered at Dean. Sam looked up to his brother and copied the Zanna’s movements.
should have been there.
*****
Castiel cradled Dean’s face in his palm. “Dean, I’m fine. Taking it slow was your idea, remember? I’m happy to engage in showering with you whenever you deem appropriate.”
“I presume by your actions, you want me to make the call.” Castiel didn’t wait for the mumbled answer, checking his phone which showed no new messages. Trying his best not to be distracted too much by Dean, he dialled Claire’s number.
Castiel understood the logic behind Sam’s reasoning. Nonetheless, he felt a loss he couldn’t explain. Walking across the market with Dean and seeing his friend light up with childlike wonder every time he would spy something he liked, were precious moments Castiel wanted to share with him. Now, he wouldn’t get the chance. He felt bereft and would have happily listened to Dean’s complaints if it meant his friend was with them.
“Damn it, Cas, answer me,” he blurted out.
“It has been eleven minutes and forty-three seconds since our last kiss,” Castiel stated matter of fact, though he couldn’t hide the smile that tucked at the corners of his mouth.
“Don’t tell me. You’re curious.” Dean nudged him with his foot.
It would only be molecules, though it was so much more. “Yes, Dean. I’d love to try it. Happy Pi Day!”
Cas turned his head from where he had been observing the endless countryside and looked at him with his usual demeanour. “I don’t know, Sam. Whoever did these transformations might gain something from the disappearances of the senior citizens. Did these people have any family?”
The same man who now was lying next to him and who abruptly woke up, startled out of his dream, gaping at him with wide eyes.
... freaking ... unbelievable.” Dean slumped down to the floor, sitting with his elbows on his knees, and held his head, still laughing, sporadic sobs erupting from his chest.
“Yes, Dean.” Castiel made sure Dean was looking him right in the eyes so he could convey his message. Sam’s words had helped to diminish his fears, but Castiel needed to be convinced as much as Dean. “We managed to get through all of it so far. We found each other. None of our traumas will vanish. They will remain and we’ll have to learn to live with them, learn how to face them. We finally have to deal with them. It’s not healthy for any of us to ignore them. Though whatever might happen in the future, we can deal with it. Our relationship only became stronger over the years, despite everything around us.”
Claire hummed in approval.
“Spill! What happened? Did the moose knock himself out cold? That’s why it’s you who’s calling?” Dean still sounded unconcerned.
They had passed a booth earlier that had spiked Castiel’s interest, but Sam had walked on, ignoring it completely. Only taking the time to quickly buy the specific item that had gathered his attention, Castiel headed back to where Sam had parked the Impala.
“Hey! Lemme help you.” Dean stepped into his space and straightened the tie. “There! Perfect, angel. Come here.”
“Yes.” Castiel nodded. “I like it very much.”
“When Jack attacked it with the pencil man!
“Go away!” he said coldly, and for once Anna listened.
He was glad he found them in the Dean Cave. After the incident in their room, Dean’s room that the two shared since Castiel’s return from the Empty, Jack had learned not to disturb them there, or anywhere. He was always weary when he approached them nowadays, using his powers to test the shore beforehand.
He sighed and let his head fall back onto his pillow. Why was this shit so fucking hard? What was so different today that he couldn’t trust his gut? Fuck, he had never thought twice when he sold his soul, gotten the Mark and all the other shit he had done within a blink of an eye.
*****
“Hey, you’re talking about my life.”
Castiel observed his friend’s underlying vulnerability simmering through his usual bold demeanour. He was always bemused that Dean couldn’t see what a great influence he had had on Sam becoming the man he was today. That meant usually, when he wasn’t transformed into his younger self.
” Sammy’s fist hit the table.
Dean’s eyes shot up and he stared at Cas. “You are? Really?”
Did he really just spell out that thought plainly in his mind?
And with that, Claire pulled the trigger.
“Dean,” Cas cut in.
.” Dean had stepped out of their embrace and gestured up and down Castiel’s body, his eyes roaming freely.
“Earth to Dean”, his brother’s voice broke through his daydream. “You still with us?”
“Dean,” he gasped, “Dean.” He felt the prick of tears in his eyes.
“Dean. ... Dean?”
“Dean,” Cas said. Looking back up at the angel, Dean could tell things didn’t go ahead as planned.
“No one. Everyone. All angels and souls are allowed to assign their representatives regularly. There is no way of corruption. Only kindness can influence the choice.”
“Yes, we are. And we have both screwed up, constantly. We hurt each other. We’ve run or pushed the other away. Far too often we kept the other in the dark because we wanted to keep each other safe. But we are still here, finally together. Look at us, we’re talking. It’s a start.”
Dean silenced his thoughts by attacking his lips. His body pressed into his and for a moment all of Castiel’s plans of rest were forgotten. Skilled hands made him shed his trench coat, and soon they fidgeted with the buttons of his shirt, slowly opening them. Dean’s mouth wandered over his jaw, and down to his neck, kissing, sucking, and teasing him with tender bites. Castiel relented for now, memorising every move for later use. How could this feel so good? He never wanted it to end.
The lights above the table started to flicker and there were sparks erupting from the power outlets.
“I’m looking forward to it,” Castiel added when he removed his hand, the smile on his face bigger than ever before.
“You did?” Castiel asked, astonished, having never heard of such a thing.
“Shuddup!” Dean scrunched his empty paper bag and threw it towards Sam’s head. It hit the moose straight in the face and his brother blinked confused.
Jody cleared her throat several times and finally got their attention.
“I hope it will work. There’s so much I have to consider. What if I’m doing something wrong?” Jack was clearly worried and doubted the rightness of his choices. The boy who called him father had become the most powerful being in the universe.
He was sure her laughter would haunt him for the next few days. “I’m fine, Sam. This ain’t my first rodeo. Remember, it was me who took care of the witch while the three of you were still licking your wounds.”
For the second time today, Dean happily welcomed the sleep that stopped his spiralling track of thoughts and let him slip into dream world.
Without a moment of hesitation, he stormed towards the building. Just by looking at them, the doors burst and crashed open. Purposefully, he walked into the barn, the human heart in his body beating heavily, knowing exactly what would await him inside. Thunder roared and sparks flew on his way towards the two persons he called family.
– intimately, who had seen him in his darkest hours, and who still loved him despite it.
“What if I did?” Castiel got bolder, encouraged by Dean’s mumbled words, and let his hand run through Dean’s hair at the back of his head, his gaze never wavering.
Moreover, right now, he had more important things to do than going on random hunts. He needed to save his angel. There had to be a way, he just needed to find it. And perhaps, if ... No!
“Exactly!” Gabe beamed, giddily rubbing his palms together. “So, what brought you up here? When Mikey finally completed our ranks, I heard you were still alive and kicking.”
Another Monday and a special one for the fandom. Congrats and thanks to everyone who contributed to the 100,000 fics of Destiel on AO3.
*****
“Yes.” Jack smiled.
*****
“Then this is for real?” Dean gestured around him. “No shit? I really got you back?”
“What’s there not to understand?”
“You sure she’s in there and it’s really her?” Dean looked doubtfully at the young hunter.
“Shuddup, Gabe,” Dean mumbled but a huge smile appeared on his face. His hands had developed a life of their own and wandered over Cas’ body, mussing up his hair and holding him tight. “Dammit, it’s so good to have you back.”
One hour after Claire had spoken with Cas on the phone she got lucky. At a secluded diner next to the highway she spotted the witch’s car in the parking lot. It fit in perfectly with the plan Claire had formed during the long drive. And being honest, she really needed a stop. She couldn’t remember when she had slept last. Far too often she had caught herself right before her eyes threatened to fall shut. She’d even hallucinated. She could have sworn she’d seen some kind of puppy on her windshield. A cup of coffee was probably all she needed.
, I always thought you simply weren’t interested,” Dean said, but his words almost broke and the last ones were nothing more than a whisper.
However, Dean had given him the opportunity to thank him properly for the gift. Stepping forward and closing the remaining space between them, Castiel embraced his friend tightly. “Thank you,” he whispered in Dean’s ear. He couldn’t help but smile when Dean returned the hug, his arms pressed against Castiel’s back and Dean’s chin resting on his shoulder.
“It’s okay, angel. It’s okay.” Dean’s movements became gentler, and he pressed a kiss on his temple. “We can take it slow.” His voice was rough, and he was still breathing heavily, while sweat was covering his forehead and chest. Every time they moved, Castiel could feel Dean’s erection pressing against his own, still hidden behind layers of cloth, leaving beads of pre-ejaculate that smeared over the bare skin above Castiel’s waistband.
It was the last they heard of Gabriel. By then they had arrived at the portal and didn’t hesitate to jump.
Sam looked around, taking in their surroundings for the first time. His eyes grew wide. “Geez, Dean! The kids. They’re still somewhere out there. Frightened and alone.”
With a sudden movement, Cas rolled them over, his wings appearing behind him. The starlight reflected off them, and the Milky Way was framing Cas while the sounds of the ocean lapping on the shore and the wind rustling in the trees enhanced the magic of the moment.

“None taken. All I know is that it works. Comes in handy.” The witch grinned.
“What happened? All I remember is that you, uh, younger you came running towards me and ...” Suddenly it hit Dean. “Oh! No, no, no!
*****
“Bones,” Sam answered, which confused Jack. It must have been visible on his face, because Sam added, “He was my dog once. For two weeks. Just ... better not tell Dean.”
*****
Although his body was to no use right now, Dean got up and slowly headed to the door. Not knowing was worse than walking over to Sammy’s room with a body that hurt like hell, though not like
“Yeah, okay, if you nudge very hard, I gonna give it a try.”
“I can’t.” Dean tried to catch some air. “This ... is ... fucking ...
happy,” Dean protested.
“I have no intention to stop, Dean,” Castiel replied, “You’ve just to be patient a little bit longer.” Turning towards his own pants once more, he finally got rid of them in a swift move that took care of his boxers as well, relieving his arching erection from the too tight space it had been enclosed in far too long.
“Stop right there with your shit-eating grin, Cas. I ...” Dean took a deep breath, “I love you, okay? Have for long time. You happy now?”
“Huh?”
Although, the direct contact with his grace created even more sensations, the heat of the moment had dissipated. Castiel looked up at his still laughing friend, and, locking his eyes with his, he found nothing but love and happiness in the vivid green.
The bastard had the nerve to look completely unfazed. But Dean knew he wasn’t, not after what had happened earlier in the car.
“You think you can crash Ladies’ Night without repercussions? I know you love chick-flicks, old man. Now act out your own,” Claire, who was sitting next to him, nudged Dean. “And don’t deny it. I’ve ransacked your DVD collection.”
“Dean!” Cas sounded annoyed; annoyed, sad and angry.
Suddenly, the fog lifted and a wooden wall of a building, a barn, appeared in his view. When the fog was gone completely, everything started to blur for a different reason when he assessed the situation. His worst nightmare was coming to pass.
Looking up, Dean realised Cas was shielding them once again with his wings. Which meant Sam’s prying eyes wouldn’t be able to see what was going on. Immediately, he relaxed even more, feeling safe, being right where he had longed to be for so many years, finally allowed to give in to his feelings. There was no need to pretend any longer.
“You’re rambling.” His hand was back on Dean’s face, his fingers caressing his cheek and jaw line.
“I can do that,” Dean said gently. Wiggling his eyebrows seductively, he added in a lower tone, “When will the others arrive?”
Dean hung up and stared at Castiel. “Son of a bitch!” In his anger he brushed several papers and a book from the table surface. “Think you could follow most of it. Apparently, Claire was hunting a were around Amarillo and is, right now, driving through southwest Kansas. So Jody thinks it’s a good idea for her to take a slight detour and look for the freaking witch.”
*****
The ocean waves in the lagoon splashed languidly onto the almost white beach and bubbled around their bare feet. A jungle started right at the edge of the beach, and some scattered trees nearly reached the shore. Tropical birds were soaring over plants and across the water where swarms of fish were visible in the crystal clear water. The cloudless sky reflected in the blue-green of the ocean and gave the place something magical.
When the portal opened in front of him, like the one to apocalypse world years before, he looked back at his found family.
Although his pants were still to be taken care of, the unaccustomed skin to skin contact of their upper bodies was overwhelming, and Castiel tried to memorise every single aspect. His grace was vibrating, and every contact with his feathers sent bursts of energy through him that erupted in little sparks of light. The heart in his human body was pumping hard. His pulse and breath were accelerated. He could feel the same happening for Dean who cried out his name in a way that went right through his body and into his grace, affecting him in every possible way.
“Good. Love you, sunshine.” Dean gripped his arm even tighter, placing tiny kisses on his palm and on every finger before he closed his eyes. The traces of sorrow and grief had completely vanished from his features and he looked happy, utterly content, probably for the first time since Castiel had laid a hand on him in Hell.
“Hell, yes!” Dean cried out, a grin splitting his face, before he crashed into Castiel, hugging him tightly, and burying his face into the crook of his neck. “This is real. You’re real. You’re here,” he was still mumbling on repeat.
“Of course I like you! I love
His angel glared at him.
Dean clapped his hands and cleared his throat. “Enough with the chick-flick moments”
Their long drive home felt amazingly like old times. Nothing had changed except their now tangled hands between them. And yet, everything was new. His longing for Castiel remained. Their mutual sexual tension only grew stronger with every passing hour. If he accelerated Baby a bit too much in the process, sue him. The sooner they got back home the sooner they could catch up where they had been interrupted earlier.
? Dean could have sworn there were tears in Cas’ eyes.
Neither Alex nor Jody were to be seen, but sounds erupted from the kitchen. Someone was definitely cooking there. Donna looked at the bags she still was holding in her arms. Seemed as if they definitely had enough food for a small army tonight.
“Some– Sometimes I still see your burned wings,” Dean choked out. “Dream of them ... Found a meadow you’d like. For your ashes. There was a windmill.”
“I guess, I am. I was happy and the Empty took me. That was the deal. I paid up.”
Sitting up on his heels and Dean’s thighs, he couldn’t help but caress Dean’s face once again. How had he been able to resist this for so long? Now, it was nearly impossible to let go of Dean at all.
“It was the most convenient way at the time. By the way, do you really think your silly little gun will harm
(See the end of the chapter for
One part of Dean’s mind still was still waiting for the bubble to burst, afraid for the illusion to give way to the harsh reality, for him to once again be woken up from a Djinn’s fantasy world. Although those dreams never were this good. After a moment that could have been hours, Dean wouldn’t know, he eventually managed to raise his arm, cupping Cas’ face with his hand and brushing the stubble. Cas nuzzled into it, his eyes closed, humming contently.
But, when Castiel wanted to reply, Dean lifted a finger to shut him up.
Now it was Dean’s turn to be utterly staggered. How could he? All those years? Cas never knew? How? With a vicious motion he tackled his angel, cupping his face, rolling them over, pressing hot and desperate kisses on his lips, his cheeks, his eyes, behind his ears, down his neck. Everywhere he could reach.
Dean shrugged and continued preparing their meal.
Gaping at his friend, the angel just shrugged, their hands still intertwined.
So, where to start?
“Much better.” Dean closed the remaining space between them, turned, and snuggled into Castiel, back to chest. Tugging Castiel’s arms around his waist, Dean let out a content sigh.
“Sure, you are, Morgana.” Claire rolled her eyes. “Plus, you know of the Winchesters. Why should an innocent witch know of them? Unless you aren’t as innocent as you want me to believe.”
Dean’s whole body was shaking. “Don’t say shit you can’t keep.”
“Girls?” Donna glanced across the living room.
Tears he couldn’t stop falling, were running down his face. Once again, Cas was holding him, and Dean was holding onto him, his lifeline.
“Must I remind you that we’re meeting up with Claire?” The angel frowned at him.
with you. There are moments, so many moments, when all I want is to hold you, to be near you.” Castiel’s eyes dropped to Dean’s lips which finally were at the verge of a radiating smile. Castiel charily let his thumb brush over them while he couldn’t stop his own tongue flitting over his lower lip. “Sometimes, I want nothing more than to kiss you.”
“Sam wants to help.” Castiel hadn’t realised Dean was awake.
They split up. Dean and Claire would burst through the front door while Castiel would cover the side door which seemingly let to the kitchen and be their backup.
Suddenly, the sounds changed drastically. Dean was screaming. Without a moment of hesitation, Castiel burst into the room, only to find Alastair shoving Dean against the hexacle, holding him by his throat. Dean was dangling in his grip, feet off the ground, fighting desperately for his breath. Seeing the demon knife on the table, Castiel grabbed it and attacked, stabbing Alastair’s shoulder. The demon turned to face the inflicted wound and let go of the human. Lifeless, Dean’s body slumped to the floor. Castiel was too late. How could he be too late?
“Except for Sam,” Cas interjected, having once more started massaging Dean’s neck and scalp, so Dean tried his best not to purr.
“You like that?” Castiel asked, smiling.
When the door fell shut behind the angel, Dean turned, anger still guiding him, ready to shout, but the expression on Cas’ face stopped him. Was... was Cas
“You seem eager to see me.” A grin spread over the angel’s face, also covering his voice. Cas’ hand was suddenly in Dean’s hair, caressing him, and then their lips met.
When Anna appeared and explained what he was experiencing were doubts he could not believe it. Never had he doubted before.
“Son of a bitch! You let her escape? How’s that even possible?” Dean yelled. He knew he shouldn’t be that angry with Cas since it had been his fault, and his fault alone, but the anger built up inside him, trying to find an outlet and Cas was right in front of him. “So you abandoned the hunt? Where the fuck are we?”
Dean groaned.
Watching Dean, he realised the hunter was fidgeting, drumming on the wheel and wiggling with his legs, silently mouthing the lyrics of the song they were listening to. So Dean was nervous too. Was he regretting his choices? Would Dean rather resume their friendship like it had been – before?
“Dean!”
Castiel’s heart broke when he fully took in his friend’s agony. “Dean.”
“Hello, Sully,” Cas greeted the still irritated Zanna. “Nice to meet you. I’m Castiel. ...”
Dean looked down on himself, chuckling. “You’re not wrong, these clothes are a mess. And I really could use a shower. Care to join me?” Dean’s smirk vanished and he faltered. “Shit, Cas. I’m sorry. I’m still adjusting to taking it slow.”
“Ugh, same.” Dean scratched his neck with his free hand. The other still held onto Castiel. “How long?” Dean asked.
The moment Dean realised who was holding him, his eyes grew wide.
Being alone again, enduring the screams coming from the dungeon became even worse. Nothing of this made sense. He shouldn’t– Was he feeling? He– He didn’t know.
lost you.” And Dean never got the chance to tell Cas all the things he needed to tell him.
an angel. ... My angel,” Dean added on a softer note. “And though all angels are dicks, most of them at least – present company excluded – ...”
“Are you trying to reassure me with yet another pop culture reference?”
“What about what I want?” Cas asked.
They headed down to the library and found Sam and Eileen huddled together over some ancient looking books. Well, if that was their idea of fun, he wouldn’t stop them.
“Haven’t you listened? He couldn’t do anything.” Castiel tried to calm him.
“Yeah, that’s Cas.”
“Now come here, sunshine, and kiss me.”
Donna exchanged a glance with Jody who was working next to Dean, but Jody only shrugged her shoulders and mouthed, “
Jack was handing bags to Eileen and Sam. “A burger for you,” he said to Eileen and reassured Sammy with, “Don’t worry, Sam. It’s a salad bowl.”
Dean tried to evade the enquiring eyes anyway, knowing that, if he didn’t, he would break, again, and spill, being already too emotionally shaken to contain the truth any longer, the truth he had managed to bury deep down for so many years. Eventually he failed and met the ever staring glance of the deep blue eyes. “How long do you have?”
When Dean wakes up, both parts intermingle in his mind, until he breaks the loop, remembering Ellen's words that nobody has the right to judge whom one is allowed to love.
“No.” Dean raised his arm behind his head, scratching his neck and contemplating how to explain the concept of fiction to the kid. Why was this so difficult? Why hadn’t his nerd of a brother or Cas already dealt with this? They were the brains after all. “No, they didn’t lie. There’s a difference between a lie and fiction. People like stories. They like to tell stories. Some people invent whole universes, fill them with characters and give them a history. Those stories are told from one person to another or they’re printed as books. Other stories become plays in the theatre, movies or TV shows. Hell, some authors might even take a real event or person or place and tweak a story around them. But it ain’t a lie. It’s just a story for entertainment or education or whatever they intent to convey with their stories.”
With the help of the wall and some of his furniture Dean eventually made it to the bed where he sat down with a groan, not even bothering to change out of his clothes before he lied down and fell asleep immediately.
“Dean? Dean, what’s going on?” Cas sounded devastated. Once again, all Dean did was to break his angel’s heart whether this was a dream or reality.
Summary of the dream sequence:
“Damn, you’re beautiful,” Dean exclaimed as his hands buried into the feathers. At once, both of them gasped in astonishment when emotions rushed through them and sparks erupted between them. “Holy shit! This is ...”
Sam and Eileen, who were mingled behind a laptop, gaped at them. When Sam opened his mouth, Dean raised his index finger to stop him. So his brother raised an eyebrow, and threw him a glare, indicating that he was done with his bullshit.
“They never were in any danger,” Sully had the nerve to explain.
Soon after, his fingers were on Dean’s shirt, slowly opening one button after the other. He took his time, letting his lips brush over every part of Dean’s skin he could reach. Soon, Dean’s jacket and shirt were gone, yet Castiel’s lips and fingers remained, still trying to cover as much skin as possible.
They touched him once and he flew through the darkness, landing hard on his back. Once again, black goo threatened to engulf Cas, forcing him back to his knees.
Apart from some "John Winchester A+ parenting" during the dream sequence there is a literal trigger warning this time, as in something gun related. It's a spoiler, so please check the end notes in case you worry about it.
“What ‘what’?” Dean asked. Having started to knock at the door, his friend almost fell inside when it gave way. Still, Dean looked ridiculously hot, even more than usual, and especially with a frown on his face. Getting back on his footing, he was glaring at Castiel.
Cas stared at him expressionless until the motherfucker raised one eyebrow mockingly.
Dean’s arms were cradling him, pressing their bodies together. One hand was back in the short hair of his neck, the fingers moving in tiny circles.
"Serves you right," Castiel said, grinning. "Thinking back, the story was never funny. How could I have known that Gabriel had left one of
Castiel didn’t need more to understand his intention. Heat was rising through his body, his grace unable to control its reactions any longer. It took all his willpower not to tackle Dean right here, in the middle of the field.
Soon, they would arrive at the bunker. After a week-long strenuous hunt Castiel expected the Winchesters to stay for a while at the place that had become their home. They needed to rest, especially Dean, who had been hurt badly, again. Despite Castiel’s healing powers, his friend would require several days to fully recover.
Looking at his brother, Dean rolled his eyes. “Sam, I’m fine. Now take your flight home and make Eileen happy.”
*****
“No, I don’t think women aren’t capable of hunting. That’s bullshit. You frigging know that. Just don’t like sending off Claire after the witch.” Castiel tensed. Dean was totally right. Claire should not go alone after the witch. Why hadn’t he insisted on returning right away? He had felt Dean’s unease and his deep buried emotions when he had proposed to go, though that was nothing new. Dean’s words rarely mirrored the continuous maelstrom of emotions underneath that most often erupted in bursts of anger. Nearly every time they were close he could sense all those disregarded and closeted feelings simmering underneath Dean’s outside façade. However, there were so many of them he rarely was able to distinguish a specific emotion, even after all these years he had spent close to humanity and especially close to Dean. Yet he couldn’t determine what was different this time. Dean was broadcasting much more anxiety than normally. Probably, it was just the whole situation with Sam that stirred some of his old childhood fears. Those two had gone through so much since such young ages. Only recently they had lost their mother again. Of course that would disrupt Dean. He focused his glance once more on his friend, stopping the track of his presumptions and returning back to the here and now, once again listening to the one-sided dialogue.
“No, I’m fine,” Claire declined. “Thanks, though.”
Tears were streaming down his face. Somewhere, far away, behind the fog around him, he could perceive voices. Someone was calling him but he didn’t care. He was barely registering what was happening around him.
“Like that?” Dean, whose mouth had wandered even further south, looked up through his eyelashes, a grin splitting his face. It was an incredible sight and certainly didn’t convince Castiel’s human heart to pump any slower.
The sounds of battle reached his senses and reminded him of his mission and everything that was at stake. He was so close and it seemed as if he would be the one, the only warrior of Heaven's army who had successfully breached Hell’s forces. Therefore, he wasn’t allowed to risk the trust Heaven had laid on him. Time was pivotal and every moment of hesitation was a liability to his mission.
Looking back, the legions of Hell were following him, still growing in numbers, attacking from every side. Once again, his wings were smouldering, arrows, spears, and blades piercing every part of his body. With every turn he took to evade his pursuers, his power dwindled. He already could see his destination, but he knew for sure, he wouldn’t make it. They wouldn’t make it.
Suddenly, a vuvuzela sounded. The entity screeched, turning once again into a black puddle, letting go of Cas.
A shiver of anticipation ran through his body.
Dean was fighting. He shouldn’t fight, though. He was free to live his life. And yet, Castiel knew Dean would never stop as long as others needed his help and as long as he felt he could give it. Still, he had hoped Dean would finally be able to live the life he had always longed for, now after Chuck had been defeated.
And surrender he did. No way could he resist his brother when the kid looked at him like that. Not now, not ever. “’Kay, okay. Just lemme get up.”
When Dean and Cas had returned earlier, they hadn’t even checked on Sammy or Jack.
” Jody mouthed back.
Castiel had watched him and maybe stolen one or two fries in the meantime.
Claire turned towards him, grinning. “Go, look after your boyfriend. I have this.” As she headed out, running in pursuit of the witch, she gestured Castiel to call her and then she was gone.
Chuck had made it clear. Cas always had been the only player on the field who never was controlled by his script. Cas had been the true rogue angel in the story. And he had fallen for Dean in every possible way. How could he ever repay him? Dean had some ideas, though, and their whole lives before them to act on them – whatever ‘forever’ and ‘whole lives’ meant when one married an angel. Though now wasn’t the time to worry about that. They would burn that bridge when it came to that.
“Wait! Let me help you, dear.” Why hadn’t he noticed his angel was sitting right next to him on the floor, caressing hiss head in a way Dean could get used to, and who now pulled him towards his lap? Cas helped him up, placing Dean between his legs, so he could lean heavily into the angel, half sitting and half lying, resting his head and weight against the muscular chest. If the situation hadn’t been this fucked up this would certainly feel kind of nice.
Dean gestured to the armchairs. “Mind if we sit down?” His heart pounded in his chest and his voice wanted to leave him. Moreover, he didn’t trust his legs to keep him steady.
“This is huge.”
“A gift? For me?” The concept of gifts being given to him was still very new to Castiel. Why would anyone consider giving him anything? Why would Dean want him to give him a windmill he had obviously built himself?
“Why would you lose me?” Cas sounded irritated. Dean knew if he looked up, he would find his friend’s eyebrows in a frown, his head tilted lightly, and his unwavering blues staring right through his shit.
“Oh my God, dude.”
Gabe leaves the bathroom and walks back toward their table, wondering if maybe he can convince Cas to hit up a couple of bars or clubs this weekend, just for something different. He knows he’ll have to work him over pretty hard to convince him.
Cas turns toward him and smiles, and
. He wishes he could enjoy it more, wishes it meant more...but he can savor the simple yet meaningful act of a friend cooking for a friend all the same. That’s good, too. Not
“For what, Cas?”
Not believing her opponent for a moment, Claire settled down on the other side of the table with a grin, her gun now cocked under it. Taking the witch’s steaming coffee from the tray, Claire enjoyed the smell of the hot brew before she addressed the culprit.
“Cas? Who’s that? Don’t tell me it’s who I think it is.”
“Yes, you can help me.” Jack nodded. “What’s ‘nostalgia’?”
“Nooooo.” He couldn’t move, his body frozen by the replay of his most recent trauma. It happened again. Tears started to flow over his face and he sobbed uncontrollably. All he could do was watch.
Castiel smiled, unable to move or talk. He simply enjoyed the feeling of Dean, alive and well, in his arms. At some time during his never ending nightmares, he had lost all hope. Now his sun was shining again, radiating a love he had always longed for but had always believed he could never call his.
“I didn’t know that. But it makes at lot of sense.” They were still standing in the library, none of the others seeming intent to sit down, and Dean wouldn’t admit that he had overestimated his strength and healing process.
like a hunt. Panicking wouldn’t help anyone. He needed to calm himself. Everything was fine. Everything was completely fine. Taking a deep breath, Dean planned ahead. First, he would check Jack’s room and probably find his brother there. And if not, he would head to the library. Sammy loved that place.
He leaned down, whispering in his husband’s ear with a commanding voice, “Then come for me, my love”, before he brought their lips back together, his tongue darting into Dean’s mouth.
“Huh?”
Dean closed his eyes and let his head fall back against Cas’ shoulder, tuning the rest of the world out, just enjoying the steady, yet technically unnecessary heartbeat of his angel.
path of thought any further. He, however, wasn’t sure if he was currently in danger of being smote by a warrior of Heaven or if his friend just needed another update on well-known fictional characters. Since Sam didn’t want to try his luck, he turned the music up and drove on.
“Ouch that hurt,” Dean deadpanned and Castiel couldn’t help but smile, picturing the giant eye-roll Dean had probably performed on the other side of the door.
“Shouldn’t they know we’re back?”
“No,” Dean stated, yanking his shirt from his left shoulder to show the remaining fine lines of what once had been a burning read handprint. “You’re wrong. I was his and he was mine long before he accepted the deal with you. He chose me. It was you who stole him from me.”
When he entered the garage on his search for Dean, Castiel was taken aback, forgetting the message Sam had sent him to relay. The view that presented itself to him was one of a kind. He would never get used to it, especially since there rarely ever an opportunity to do so arose.
“Jack! Jack!” Dean hollered, “Damn it, kid! Rain or not, show your stupid ass down here. ASAP! You being the new God? Doesn’t that mean you can do anything you want? So, break your own rules and show yourself. Hell, I thought we were family. You can visit family once in a while,” Dean shouted in his burning need for answers.
He hadn’t expected Dean’s reaction, though. Instead of hunting witches, his brother had sent Cas with him and decided to stay behind. He claimed someone needed to guard the kid. But Sam knew that even though Dean was still suspicious of the nephilim, especially after Jack had accidentally killed a man, his brother secretly liked the boy far more than he would admit, probably even more than Dean realised himself. His brother was an idiot when it came to admitting his feelings towards himself and others. Moreover, Dean was just good with kids. He knew how to handle them, talk to them. They trusted him easily. And despite Dean’s claims, and fears, and anger issues, and despite his history with killing peaceful monsters, Sam still trusted Dean with Jack, especially after Cas had returned from the Empty. It had stabilised Dean immensely and stopped his erratic behaviour of the last months. With Cas back in their midst, Dean immediately had calmed down.
“It’s a habit of his. He does it with everyone he encounters as far as I observed. Your brother rarely seems to use proper names and appears to be fond of nicknames.”
“Jeez, Cas!” Swallowing hard, Dean gasped. “Though I can’t deny it: I’d love to if you let me.”
“The moment definitely carried a certain comedic allure.” The smirk on Cas’ face was audible.
“We’ll see.” What the hell did that mean? “Let’s get inside. Sam will want to know we’re back.”
“Would you agree to me being inside of you, Dean?”
Castiel took the hint, and used his grace to clean them both. “Better?”
Besides, their story already deviated from Chuck’s trash. Jack hadn’t left to become the rain. He still kept in contact with them. Miracle was staying with Jody in Sioux Fall. Donna had taken care of that. A stray for the strays. The pup deserved to live in a loving family home.
Dean relented and laid his head on Castiel’s shoulder, making himself comfortable and facing Jack. “So, kiddo, what about you?”
“That’s great, Jack.” Dean still smiled at the kid when Cas appeared behind the still beaming kid.
“Don’t promise shit you can’t keep.” Dean could feel parts of his painstakingly erected inner wall breaking down. Being trapped between the shelf and the angel, unable to stabilise the crumbling structure or to flee, a single tear threatened to spill from his right eye.
“How come I never get hugs like that?” Dean mumbled.
The next chapter will be up in two days on Monday. After that update, I'll update weekly.
“Dean!” Castiel cried out.
Two weeks after his heart had been ripped out, a cryptic mail arrived in his inbox.
“Shh,” Castiel whispered in his ear, calming him.
Castiel leaned forward and kissed Dean on his cheek. Turning his attention back to Jack, Castiel said, “Mammoths.”
“I’m nephilim.” Jack smiled before he squinted. “Why shouldn’t I be able to see you?”
Dean woke abruptly when something crushed onto his chest. His eyes flew open and his hand automatically grabbed for his gun while he instinctively tried to fend off his assailant. Right before he nearly flung whatever attacked him through the room, he heard the exited piping voice.
Only a breath away from his heart’s desire, something banged in one of the corridors, followed by heavy footsteps. Resigned, he let his hand fall down in his lap out of instinct, once again sitting erect.
Sam let himself fall down on a chair at the other side of the table. “Pie?” he asked, staring first at Dean and then at him. “Did I miss some special date?”
...Cas? Mind if I kiss you now?”
” Dean struggled with his words and Castiel failed to keep a straight face due to Dean’s phrasing.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I received them but didn’t process them until yesterday. I was too distracted.”
“HE CAN SEE ME!” The Zanna pointed accusingly at Cas.
Castiel wanted Dean to know how wrong he was. Cupping his friend’s face, Castiel kissed Dean deeply. Eventually, they parted, breathless, lost in each other’s eyes. “My wings are useless since the fall.”
“Don’t talk, kiss!” Cas demanded.
“So technically all the time.” Dean grinned. “Love you, angel.”
“I’m fine. I just can’t unsee Dean all over Cas when we stumbled into them in the library this morning. It’ll be burned into my brain forever.” Sam shuddered dramatically.
“What’s there not to understand? It’s pie,” his friend explained cheerfully but still unhelpful, and dropped down next to him.
The rest of their drive went smoothly. Four times they had stopped for gas on their long way from Ohio to Kansas, and another stop was at a diner where Dean had wolfed down a double-cheeseburger heavy on onions with a big serving of fries as a side dish.
“I thought you’re ‘hands off’,” Dean asked gruffly, yet Castiel heard the warmth underneath. Whatever was going on between them, he gently squeezed Dean’s hand, and was rewarded by a gentle flush and a shy smile.
“Hey, Sammy! You had a good drive?” Dean’s voice broke before he caught himself, a smile flitting over his face which underneath showed so many other emotions.
“'Nostalgia'. I know its definition, but I don't understand its meaning. What’s nostalgia for you?”
Cas had finally closed the distance and brought their lips together for the first time. It only was a chaste peck but it already felt like heaven. Hell, Dean couldn’t imagine what a real kiss would be.
“I always thought that was what you wanted.” Naturally, Cas would think that. Every time Cas was in dire need of help, even asking for it, Dean had abandoned him and pushed him away. “If you want me to stay, I’ll stay,” Cas stated it as such a matter of fact, Dean wanted nothing more than to believe him. But it didn’t matter. One day or another Dean would drive Cas away. Nobody he had ever cared for stayed with him. Eventually, they all had left him or died.
His husband grabbed Castiel’s ass cheeks and pulled him down while he was bucking upwards once again. Their mouths were still mingled, tongues darted in and out frantically, and Castiel already felt the tension rising through his body, threatening to overwhelm him.
“So, what do you think, Cas?” Dean grinned. “Burgers? I need Sammy to be fed properly for once.” He wiggled his eyebrows at him and Castiel couldn’t help to comment with a full-body eye-roll.
“Dying, jerk,” Sam said seriously.
This was all he had ever wished for. Here he was with a drink in his hand, standing with his feet in the sand of a tropical beach. His family and friends were all around him, chatting happily and celebrating. Of course, many who should be with them today were dearly missed but with Heaven rebuilt they probably would have a big party of their own. One day, hopefully not too soon, he would see them again. But not today. Today he was the happiest where he was. His eyes fell on Cas and his heart missed a beat. Although all this seemed completely surreal he finally was certain that this was indeed reality. This was really happening to him. A smile split his face and he grabbed onto Cas’ lapels, pulling his husband towards him, and placed a kiss on his lips, finally allowed to act on it whenever he wanted.
“It’s all I wished for and more.” Cas smiled.
Several voices greeted her, but she was taken aback by the lack of enthusiasm she encountered.
Jack harrumphed, and everyone turned towards him. “I might have changed some parts of angel physiology when I restored their power.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean gave Cas an eye-roll before he turned his back him, trying to conceal his grin. “You coming?”
“Besides Sammy. There is no either or. It will always be the both of you.” Hoping he had made himself clear, Dean took a deep breath. “So, yeah, I don’t want to mess this up, even though it took us almost ten years to get to this point. At least it was that long for me.” Repeating his earlier moves, Dean absent-mindedly drew little circles on Cas’ shirt-clad chest.
Too late, Dean noticed Cas had followed him. He had almost reached the garage by that point, so Dean just went on, Cas following silently behind.
“Shuddup, Gollum. Heard you the first time. But guess what?” Dean took another step in their direction. “I’m here to take him back where he belongs.”
“Touché!”
When they parted, Dean cupped Cas’ face with both his hands and pressed their foreheads together, before his lips brushed over Cas’.
“Cas, I looked everywhere. They’re gone.” Dean was barely able to keep the devastation from his voice.
“Here?” Dean swallowed. “You want me to call Cas here?”
“You too.” Dean released her and stepped back to resume his work on the countertop.
“Deeeeean!”
Tiny kicking feet, clad in muddy, very muddy shoes directed Dean’s thoughts back to one mystery they hadn’t solved. “Where the hell you’ve been, Sammy?”
He feared that moment would be rather sooner than later.
“Sully?” Dean stared at Cas. “You want me to ask Sully to babysit Sammy and Jack? Sam’s invisible non-imaginary good weird Mork from Ork friend? Dude, that’s ...” Frightening was probably the right word for it. This idea was completely out of question. No way! No fucking way would he trust that Zanna, but to his horror Dean heard himself saying, “... both genius, and absolutely terrifyingly crazy.” Dean wanted to kick himself for his mouth’s betrayal. Seriously? This was so not right on too many freaking levels. But Cas nearly beamed. That sold Dean because he liked his angel happy. If the idea of inviting the Zanna brought a gummy smile to Cas’ face, Dean simply had to relent.
Reaching the table, Claire put down the tray and clumsily let fall down the gable next to the witch. As Claire had anticipated, the witch bowed down automatically to grab it from the bench next to her. Before she knew what had happened Claire had her in angel cuffs. “Gotcha!”
He dropped down on the bed, his brother already sleeping soundly, and barely suppressed a sigh. “Damn it!” His fist hit the memory foam several times. Yet, it didn’t help. It was no good hitting something soft when agony struck him. He wished Mom could be here. Then at least she would finally have gotten a chance to meet Sammy as the adorable kid he once was. But she wasn’t here any longer. He had lost her again. Even though he had given up hope to see her again, deep down he still couldn’t accept she was gone forever. However, he must. He couldn’t let himself hope she had survived being pulled in that bloody Apocalypse World and that they could rescue her from Lucifer’s grasp, and end the dick for good this time. How he would love to see Cas crushing him. It would be justice well served after all the things the bastard had done to his friend.
“Where are the others?”
“Dude, that’s exactly what I said,” Dean grumbled at his friend. He turned back to the Zanna who made faces at a laughing Sammy. “So, you’re in?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Yeah, I know. He’s worried. Shouldn’t be. Neither should you, angel. I’m not good with all that feelings crap but I know my feelings for you aren’t fleeting,” Dean slurred, his word’s nearly indistinguishable.
“... you love my dick.” It was an opening Castiel couldn’t resist, finally being able to exert his grown knowledge of human innuendos. He still struggled with most of them, but Dean’s reaction showed him that he got this one right.
“I wanted to hop into a chalk painting, too, but Sully said it’s impossible. That’s not true! I don’t believe him. Did you see my painting over there? I want to go there, now.” Dean didn’t need to see his brother to know the pouting on his face. Dean also could feel Sam letting go of his head to gesture somewhere towards the War Room before his brother petulantly crossed his arms. Cas jumped in to keep Sam steady, even though that meant that his friend – Boyfriend?! Partner?! Lover?!
Everyone turned to her.
“I don’t understand. Why should I want more?” Cas tilted his head and furrowed his brow. “Besides, you never were broken. Hurt, tortured, a twisted version of yourself? Then, yes, you were. Taken over by forces older than the universe, forces that never saw more in you than a tool or pawn for their games and politics? Yes, that’s true, but you always fought. Dean, you always fought until the end.”
Cas’ face fell, sad eyes resting on his surrogate son.
When everyone had settled down again, it was Mary who spoke. “Dean, holding Sam in his arms for the first time. You should have seen his little, proud face. He was so happy.”
“Leave me alone. Just go away,” he murmured.
The doorbell rang, but Castiel decided he was too lazy to get up and just called, “Who’s there?”
“Son of a ...” The human awoke with a start, lashing out around him. Immediately groaning when he felt his battered body, Dean slowly took in his surroundings, rubbing his eyes, and turned towards Castiel, a dozy smile on his face. “Heya, Cas.”
This was all he had ever dreamt of. Moreover, this was Cas. Cas who had seen him at his worst. Cas who had told him he loved him. Cas who – for whatever freaking reason – thought the world of him. Cas who had died for him.
Before she would cause a scene, Claire winked at her. “Honey, this one’s a special delivery. Don’t worry. Tips are still on you. It’s a happy surprise. If you could grant us some privacy for a while we would greatly appreciate it.”
“What did you just say?” Cas inquired. His voice was husky and he was still shaking after Dean’s anwer.
are the most loving person on Earth and I love you. I want to spend eternity with you – be it on Earth or in Heaven or wherever we’ll end up.”
“Seriously? A queen? What was she thinking?” Dean dropped his bag on one side of the bed and threw himself next to it, lying down on his back, his hands folded behind his head.
Dean gaped. Castiel saw how he was trying to find a fitting kid-friendly retort but eventually had to resign. Shooting him a smouldering look, Dean mumbled an almost inaudible “Later.” It was unmistakably a promise for getting back to him.
“Cas, what the hell was that? It felt like an electric shock.”
“No,” Castiel called back. However, he struggled to his feet and walked towards the door.
“No. Probably not.” Dean sighed and shook his head. “We’re a pair of idiots.”
Even if his wings hadn’t been still on this plane, the attempt would have taken far too long for his own liking, so Castiel helped to discard the clothes. Both his jacket and shirt ripped at once, and together they managed to get rid of the offending barrier between them.
“Son of a bitch!” he mumbled.
“It did,” Sam had to admit.
Yet, it had been far more than that. He needed to do his penance and separate himself from the blazing sunshine that was Dean Winchester.
Without another look at the others Dean fled the kitchen. There wasn’t anywhere specific he was heading, but somehow he turned towards the garage, longing for the calm that Baby always offered.
Castiel took over before it got too awkward, even for him. He could feel Dean shudder as he still processed what he had just heard. “Claire, do you have any news about the witch?”
“Hey, Cas. Look at me, sunshine. It’s me, it’s really me. I’ve come to take you home.”
“I don’t feel sexually attracted to you.” Dean winced, trying to wiggle out of Castiel’s tight embrace. He was only successful because Castiel let him, yet not without lightly touching Dean’s chin, his fingers lifting his head, inviting Dean to lock eyes with him. “Dean, please hear me out.”
Dean’s lips, arms, and hands were roving over skin and feathers alike, leaving a burning trail behind, and rendering him almost too overwhelmed to take action himself. For a moment he simply bathed in the connection they shared, and although he knew there was still more to come, the experience was already much more than he had dared to hope for.
“Someone’s already eager to escape the bunker,” she teased, her grin even distinguishable over the phone.
The moment it happened, they both shared a gasp that encompassed over a decade of unresolved tension and accumulated lust between them. It was almost too much to bear. Castiel had to close his eyes for a short moment, just to look up and meet Dean’s, who was staring at him, his mouth opened slightly.
... You ... and me.” Dean gestured between them before adding sheepishly, “Us.”
“You should’ve seen your wig.” He shuddered. “And your wife. I had expected more of you. Geez, you had a freaking altar for Dad. What the hell went wrong with you?”
“Then why won’t you let me go on the hunt alone? I’m trying to help you.” Castiel glanced at Dean.
Cocking his head, Castiel watched his friend. “Probably that an angel doesn’t need to sleep. Until now, you hardly ever complained about any of your accommodations and you don’t seem to have any other complaints regarding this room. As you know well, she was right. I do not require sleep and therefore am not in need of the bed. It’s all yours. I’ll be perfectly happy with this chair. I’ll just wait here.” To demonstrate his point Castiel sat down on the wooden chair standing by the window.
As if he had heard his brother, Sam looked at them and waved enthusiastically, a broad smile covering his face.
Thinking back, he didn’t know how he had arrived in Hastings to meet up with Sam and Jack. All he knew, he somehow had driven all the way from the bunker to Minnesota. Apart from that, everything was a blur. He didn’t even know when he had eventually left the dungeon and started on the nine hour drive. It might have been hours, it even could have been days until he finally had answered one of Sam’s numerous calls. It didn’t matter. Nothing mattered anymore.
After all these years, Castiel still could feel every aspect of the moment when his personal sun was standing right in front of him after all these months in solitude. Dean had been crushing him in a fierce hug. It was something he would never forget. Despite his search for repentance it was like coming home, a concept he couldn’t allow himself to long for.
Wait. What? This wasn’t little Sammy, this was Sam the full grown Sasquatch. In order to get a proper look, Dean tried to raise himself to his elbows, but instantly regretted his decision. Whatever had happened, it hadn’t helped his already damaged body.
“I’m sorry.”
“I know. Damn, I’ve known for a long time though we lost far too many of them. But this”–Dean pointed to the corner where Sam and Jack were once again deep in conversation–“this brought back so much. He is so vulnerable and he doesn’t even know what’s out there. For once Sammy is just a normal kid – or as normal as it gets in a secret bunker stuffed with all this junk, a once again resurrected angel, Lucifer’s offspring, and me.”
“Earth to Cas. Hey sunshine, you still present?” Dean interrupted his train of thought. “Cas, you okay?” His friend’s features had changed drastically. He now was worried, all of his playfulness gone.
Dean deflated into his seat, knowing full well that Cas was right. He kept staring at his shoes. “’kay.”
“Not planning to, bitch.”
“Wait! I haven’t even showered,” Dean grumbled.
Immediately, the sensations were back, streaming through his body, and touched every part of his grace, reaching his whole being. That moment he understood. Dean was touching his grace. There were no boundaries between them when Dean’s finger brushed his wings, the manifestation of his grace on the earthly plane. Never before, except for their narrow escape from Hell, had the love of his life been closer to his true form.
“I thought so, but Garth called. There’s a single vamp near St. Louis. I should check it out since I’m already in the area.”
Castiel looked at Jack who had been intrigued when he had been introduced to Sam in his current form. Currently, he was once again absorbed in his book. although, when they had found him reading in his room, he and Sam had instantly bonded and found some layer of mutual understanding.
“Seriously, Cas? Didn’t Metadouche cover that with his update? How much TV did you binge and you still don’t know
*****
The principal answered all their questions without any suspicion. At least that was Castiel’s impression. He gladly let Sam do all the talking. Sam was always clear-headed in these interviews and good at talking to strangers. Although not as charming as Dean, Sam fortunately lacked his brother’s oftentimes subliminally abrasive behaviour and roughness.
Castiel's whole world shattered. He stared at the door, trying to process what he had just heard.
“Thank you, Rowena.” Jack stepped back, still pondering over the implications of her answer, when he appeared in Heaven, facing Charlie.
“That’s brilliant, Sammy. Can you now please give the phone back to Cas? I need to talk to him.”
This time the witch stayed silent. Wordlessly, she took her wallet and threw some cash on the table. Claire got up, grabbed the witch’s coat and threw it over the cuffs, never letting the witch out of sight and never lowering her gun, even when she had to hide it inside her jacket once more.
, hunter?” Once again her manic laughter vibrated the room.
“Okay, okay. I get it. Message received.” Dean lowered his bag on the floor and tossed them each a hex bag. “These are usually Sam’s area of expertise but luckily we still had some in stock. They’re quite useful for general protection.” Dean rifled through the bag, finally unearthing what he had been looking for and handing everyone some bullets. “Witch-killing bullets. Aim for the head.”
Dean was already moving back, but suddenly Cas’ eyes opened, staring at Dean in wonder. Chasing after Dean, Cas’ hands gripped both of Dean’s shoulders, and he reciprocated. And how he reciprocated! Cas’ lips locked over Dean’s, his tongue already brushing over Dean’s lips.
“I liked all the answers the others gave me. It helps me comprehend a lot about human nature.”
“There never was anyone else,” Castiel heard himself admit. “Only you. I tried, but the others never stood a chance.”
Sadness suddenly clouded the room. When Castiel laid his eyes on Sam, the younger Winchester’s features showed a sorrow he didn’t understand.
“You seem not happy about it.”
“That what I think it is?” Dean grabbed the bag Jack was offering him, opened it, and inhaled the mouth-watering scent of grilled ground beef perfectly paired with cheese and onions.”Hell, yes!”
Sam gaped at him. “You’re joking!”
“Cheater,” Dean grumbled, heaving himself over the back rest, and climbed onto his seat.
“That is actually a really good comparison, I like it. I never thought of it that way.” Cas smiled, his head tilted. “But no, the other one. Pi as in Archimedes’ constant.”
“Ugh! No.” Claire shook her head in disgust. “Just no.”
There might as well be the Big Bad Wolf somewhere around. After all, they had run into Hansel and the witch.
“Profound,” Sam mumbled, rolling his eyes. That earned him another clap from Eileen.
“S’fine. Look at us.” He gestured with his free arm at them and at Eileen who was standing by the door, smiling, before his sight fell onto the dark hair poking out from under the covers. The bubbling feelings inside him threatened to choke him. “You ‘nd ‘leen, me, Cas. We’re home. We’re back. I got him back,” he said, barely managing to get the words out, his voice suddenly hoarse with emotion. Tears were welling up behind his eyes, but he actually didn’t care. Dammit! When did he become such a sap?
Castiel shook his head, trying to hide the tears that were welling up in his eyes. It was just too much.
. What a strange concept. Did Castiel really consider the bunker their home? Dean had embraced the idea of a permanent dwelling since the brothers entered the bunker for the first time all those years ago, growing up with the memory of a real home he had been pulled out so tragically.
Yet, when Donna entered the kitchen, a surprise was awaiting her. “Dean?” she exclaimed, “Whatcha doing here? It’s Ladies’ Night.”
Castiel stood erect, offering the underside of his right wing to Dean, so it would be easier for his friend to reach out to his primaries. Hesitantly, Dean moved his left hand towards the wing, stretching his index finger. Right before he closed the last inch to touch though, he looked back to Castiel, asking once more for permission.
“Stop it! Both of you,” Eileen chided them, looking at each of them sternly.
dreamt of it. When ... if there was ever any hope for him and Cas being more than friends – which there wasn’t, definitely not – Dean wanted it all. All in. All or nothing.
This felt right and Castiel didn’t want it to end, so he kept hugging Dean who was loosening up in his arms. How long they were standing there, Castiel didn’t know.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Give him to me. I’ve never been able to carry Sammy that way. Either I was too small or he was already too big.” Dean gestured to Cas to hand Sammy over.
“Dean.” Cas turned and smiled at him, before he returned his eyes back to the road. “How are you?”
“Huh?” His brain was still too foggy to process all that. An instant? He’d been gone at least for two hours he’d guess, probably more. But these fucking planes of existence never bothered to synchronise their time. So, who knew? He probably could have been gone for years without even realising.
“Let’s save that for later,” Dean spluttered, taking a deep breath. It was a promise, and Cas’ smile became wider.
“Disapp– Cas, you’re kidding.” Dean glared at him, searching Castiel’s face for answers, and caressed his cheek with gentle fingers.” You are kidding, right?”
“Yes.”
“In love, asshole,” Dean shot back.
*****
When he started to lose all hope, suddenly a force he didn’t know he still possessed – if he ever had possessed it – was running through him, reaching every fibre of his being. Empowered by such, the invisible bonds that had held and tortured him all this time tore easily. Getting up to his full posture, standing for the first time since his arrival, he wrenched the last black tendrils from his body.
He realised he had been staring too. Dean had actually gone back to his work, adding the last few pieces of wood to the pile in haste. Already, he was on his way to haul the first body on the stack. Not wanting to wait either, Castiel collected the other bodies, and soon after, their tools had been stashed in the Impala, and the fire burned everything that remained of the vampires.
“Winter evenings with Dad in the Roadhouse,” Jo added, to which Ellen only nodded, exchanging a glance with her husband.
Cas frowned and immediately pulled Baby over, turning in his seat and glaring at him with –. Was that concern on his face? “Are you okay? If you can’t tell that I’m driving your concussion might be worse than I feared.”
Dean was flatted on his back when he opened his eyes. Some weird dream still was hovering in the back of his mind, with the fleeting feeling that he had to hold onto some kind of important thoughts that vanished as soon as he tried to grasp them. Embrace yourself or some shit like that. Blinking at the bright lights, he felt the distinct prickle of residual grace floating through his body for the second time in two days.
Like so much of their lives, they spent their time in the library. While Dean was busy on his laptop – he had found an unused room deep down in the bunker and had some plans for it that needed research; it would be the perfect hideout, his Dean cave – Jack was reading some book he had found on one of the shelves. Dean hadn’t checked on it and hoped it wouldn’t enable the kid to destroy the world. He wondered whether he should find out what the boy was studying.
“So, yeah. Go for it. Go get your wings back.”
“He’s fine, except for the obvious.”
Jack looked at the book’s cover. “Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman –
Although he still seemed anxious, Sam nodded again and watched Castiel expectantly. Castiel merely brushed the broken skin and sent some grace into the tiny body until he felt that Sam was fully recovered, though he still remained a preschooler. That was a problem Castiel was not able to solve alone. He had to inform Dean and let him decide. For now, Castiel was responsible for this little human. With a child it was impossible to stay on the hunt. And Dean couldn’t leave the bunker without bringing Jack or leaving Jack alone behind. Both options were not feasible right now. He had to return to the bunker with Sam so that he and Dean could find a way to restore Sam to his normal self, probably hunt the witch, and do all that with a new-born nephilim and a preschool-aged Sam to look after. Castiel really looked forward to it.
“I agree. It certainly seems logical to request an update. Even though we know Sam is still not back to his actual self, I would certainly feel relieved to know Claire was okay.” At this, Dean looked back up and Castiel continued, “And I would love to do ‘whatever’ with you because I love you.”
“Yeah, sure,” Sam threw an annoyed look at his brother, “It’s only your wedding day.”
“You guess?” Donna inquired, astonished.
“I’m fine,” he grumbled, batting Cas’ hand away.
“That’s why you’re here?” Patience asked. “Too much happiness in the bunker?”
Again, he earned an angel warrior’s glare that had once smitten entire civilisations.
He sighed. This was wrong ...
How could he soothe his brother when he knew for sure that he wasn't wrong? He still was pointing his gun at the empty space in front of him. These corridors weren't homey and once upon a time freaking evil Elphaba had been stored in the lab.
Nah, he was too happy for it. Djinns never got it right. They had always messed up some parts and never had gotten down to the things that really mattered to him.
After everything he had heard today, Jack didn’t need to think about it any longer. “My first nougat.” He grinned when he remembered that day. Although he had been confused and afraid, and despite the grief his birth had brought to his family, he still could taste it.
“But”–Dean raised a finger, only to immediately form it into the gesture of a shooting gun, a grin on his face–“don’t let Sammy talk you into stuff. The garden’s yours. Capiche?”
“Sam! You sound so grown-up,” Claire teased.
“Do you remember the first time Castiel was in the Empty?” Jack asked, his voice sad and calming.
“Dude! For god’s sake! Don’t ... just don’t give a man a heart attack like that.”
Lowering his eyes, Castiel sighed. “It’s okay, Dean,” Castiel heard himself say, his voice steadier than he had anticipated, “I know how much you love your pie.” He tried to smile, but it didn’t work.
“Dean,” he breathed out, “I’m close.”
Dean threw a pleading glance at Cas. “Keep an eye on them?”
Dean would be nervous and self-conscious. As far as Castiel could tell, Dean had shown true workmanship.
Even though he would never admit it out loud, even though there always would be things threatening their lives and more than once the universe, and even though they had lost far too much or right because of having lost far too much for one life, these were the moments Dean would treasure forever. Home, Baby safely parked in the garage, dinner time with his family – Sammy, his angel and Jack –, ... and pie.
“Hey,” Dean whispered, voice cracking. “Look at me, Cas.”
“And the pencil man!” Sam chimed in.
And Sam and Jack were gone? Before Castiel gave in to desperation himself, he needed to keep calm, especially to soothe Dean. There must be a perfectly logical explanation. Until Castiel had gathered more information he wouldn’t let himself despair. “What happened?”
Cas had raised an eyebrow in his usual manner and now was looking at him stoically, and yet tauntingly at the same time. “Let me know when you need the matches.”
“Sorry?” Dean beamed. “Bullshit, Cas! They’re awesome. Fucking awesome.”
Castiel had listened with a heavy heart, especially to Dean’s inner musings and hopefulness that were broadcasted loud and clear through the dream. With a last look to each of the Winchesters – Sam trying to read his textbook, but being too absorbed in his brother and father’s conversation to actually follow the text, John driving on and looking tortured and obsessed as ever since the night that had changed his life, and Dean being Dean, doing everything to hold his family together, always trying to keep his hopes and dreams hidden from everyone, even himself, pretending not to feel a thing, though silently suffering deeply – Castiel concentrated on returning to reality.
Instead of leaving, Jack turned to Cas again. “Castiel, I now can restore all your power. You could have your wings back. Think about it.” And with that Jack was gone.
He would lose the righteous man. He would lose Dean. And yet, with every thought of his inexorable defeat, there was a surge in his power, the burning conviction that Dean Winchester must be saved.
It took Dean far too long to reach Sammy’s door, where he hesitated.
. You you. I told you once, ‘Don’t ever change’. But guess what? You did. We both did. And in whatever form we were together all those years, not together together, like actually together, though you actually might say we were together, at least that was how it felt for me...”
“This is too special to mess it up. This ain’t a bar fling.
“Dean’s right, Jack. We’ve all done things we aren’t proud of. And many of them we did consciously, not by accident, because we thought we were doing the right thing. Yet, we kept on going, because that’s the only thing we can do.”
“I don’t know for sure. My best guess is he found someone with a strong enough bond to summon them.” Jack shrugged.
“Nah. We’ll stop by and get our stuff. That’s it. Nothing more. Don’t want to spend my first time with you in some random fleabag on the road.”
“Dean.”
“Yeah, Cas’s back. He’s fine, I guess,” Dean eventually answered Donna’s question.
Sam looked back at him questioningly, one eyebrow raised.
“What’s up, kiddo? Need help?”
– let fly his pencil man to catch the kite.”
Eventually Dean relented. “You know that’s bullshit. You were there! You saw me down there. I broke. Alastair broke me and I ... Jesus, Cas!” Dean closed his eyes, trying to keep himself together. “I fucking loved it.”
Against his better judgement, Dean found himself stepping forward until he was standing right in front of his angel. He nearly felt Cas’ breath on his face. There were actual tears in Cas’ eyes and running down the angel’s face.
At once, Dean’s hands were on his back, wandering down. He realised too late he was still wearing his trench coat but Dean found a way beneath it, tugging his shirt free until his hands made contact with the skin on his back. The sensations were incredible, every touch burning through human tissue into his grace. Dean grinned broadly, and then his hands still wandered lower, getting hold of his ass while simultaneously thrusting his hips upwards.
Dean couldn’t believe his ears and barely managed to keep his breath steady. “Moron!” He cupped Cas’ cheeks in both his hands and rested their foreheads together. “
Except for a momentary stir, when he had thought Dean might be waking up, Castiel could tell that Dean slept through their whole drive. Pulling up in front of the bunker and rolling into the garage, he thought about letting his friend sleep but decided against it, thinking about the combination of Dean’s injuries and his current quite uncomfortable sleeping position. Furthermore, Dean wouldn’t forgive Castiel when his friend missed the meet up with Sammy, Jack and Sully. Knowing the angry sleeper Dean was, Castiel braced himself for the attack as he reached for his friend’s left shoulder.
Castiel felt warmth rise inside him. Dean had baked a pie for him because this day reminded him of them. Somehow his hand found Dean’s knee and made contact with it. He didn’t stop himself and neither did Dean. “Thank you. I love it.”
“Haha.” Sam rolled his eyes. “But thanks. Whatever you did, it worked.”
Yet, at the same time, as long as the Shadow tortured him, it meant he was still partially awake. Somewhere deep inside him, there was still a tiny spark of hope he couldn’t ignore. Something was still out there. Someone hadn’t given up on him. So he wouldn’t give up either.
Cas broke away from their kiss, and when Dean stared at him, the angel grinned, happiness evident on his face.
“That’s a wonderful idea, Jack.” Eileen smiled at the boy.
“I love you, Dean. I’m in love with you. I’ll happily repeat it until you believe it. And I won’t stop afterwards. You deserve to hear it every day. I love you, Dean Winchester.” Cas pressed a chaste kiss on his lips.
“Stop! ... Dean, you need to stop. Now! I don’t think I can control my wings.”
Placing another kiss on his cheek, Dean grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the edge of the jungle to get dressed.
“What’s there to talk about?” Dean got louder.
Hoping Dean would understand what he was asking, Castiel leaned in, never losing their eye contact. Dean bit his lower lip before his tongue flit over his upper one. The distance between them diminished further. Even if he had wanted to stop, Dean’s presence felt like a magnet. This would happen. Whatever the outcome, this was it. Anticipation, build up over years and years, made him light headed. He could feel the broad smile on his face while tears threatened to fall.
Standing next to each other they both hesitated, starring at each other, unwilling to part. Castiel’s hand was still resting on Dean’s forearm. It felt wrong to sever their connection.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, “She’s not wrong.”
“Have you even tried to talk to him?” Donna examined.
“I missed you, too, Girl Scout,” Dean greeted Claire.
“It’s okay, Dean. We stopped for a farmers' market. Sam is safe. He’s somewhere out there, talking about witchcraft with one of the vendors. I might have left him,” Castiel admitted, “because I wanted to give you this.” Picking up the paper bag, he had left next to the car in the grass, Castiel handed it to Dean.
They all turned at once, staring at the intruder. Castiel's heart leaped. Whatever Dean’s intentions when he ordered Jack to Earth, it had worked.
But he had to keep going. Otherwise Cas’ self-sacrifice had been utterly meaningless. For the time being, he needed to keep himself together as much as possible, even if it meant to feel nothing. As long as he could go through the motions and get everyone back, it was worth it.
*****
Dean chuckled and pressed a kiss on Castiel’s neck before he loosened the embrace and turned towards his brother. “Chill, Samantha. Nothing happened.”
“You sure?” Claire chimed in. “You asked him?”
Dean almost jumped when their hands touched, but didn’t pull his hand away. “’s nothing. Just take the damned gift.” Then, turning his back towards Castiel, Dean withdrew his hand and was suddenly very interested in his tools.
Sam stared at his older brother with a mixture of awe, fear, and incomprehension.
When Dean was pushing his pelvis forward, creating a breathtaking friction, it was Castiel who took a step back. Dean looked at him questioningly – Was that hurt on his face? Fear? Castiel didn’t ask. He opened the back door, asking Dean silently to climb onto the backseat, before he followed. Soon he was on his knees, straddling Dean who was half sitting, half lying in the crammed space of the bench.
All Castiel had needed to do was to watch and marvel in their childlike wonder of the world. Sam had told Jack about things he had observed earlier on the road: dogs, cows, horses, and birds, tractors and construction vehicles, and all kinds of people. Jack on the other hand had wanted to know everything, and asked every detail which Sam happily delivered. A human might have said that the time until dinner had flown by though it actually had run its usual course. This feeling of time was fascinating and yet still kind of eerie for an angel. Only after his short, yet very trying and frustrating time as a human, he had gotten an understanding of the human perception of time. And even after he had been reunited with his grace, time had never been the same for him. He wondered if he still would be able to watch trees grow from saplings to old age. His time in the Empty which seemed to have been both an eternity and a fleeting moment had manifested this weird sense of time that was normal to humans.
Leaving the bags on the table, Donna called towards the kitchen. “Hiya!”
*****
All of a sudden, Dean’s hands were grasping his head and Dean’s fingers buried into his hair. Before he was able to process this novel, yet staggering feeling, Dean’s lips crashed into his. The angle didn’t fit and Castiel was clumsy, too new, and unaccustomed to all of this, but it didn’t matter. Nothing did matter right now other than the man in his arms, the man he had loved for years and never dared to hope to call his one day.
“Hello to you to, Dean.” Sully turned to Cas and questioningly looked at the angel. “He can see me!”
Following Dean through the bunker’s corridors, Castiel could tell that his friend, despite his earlier assertions, was barely keeping up, too tired and too exhausted after a night of driving on his own. Dean had simply refused all mentions of him driving so his friend could rest. Not to mention the physical exertions from the day before. Castiel might have saved him right on time but the strain of severe injuries always left traces even when healed with grace. He could feel the last day himself regardless of his fully recharged power. After all the millennia he had spent without them, emotions were still so very new to him.
Had Castiel lost his home when he left Heaven? Belonging to the garrison never had been debatable. Serving Heaven had been his sole duty and his life-task until he raised Dean from Hell and got to know the Winchesters who acquainted him with the concept of free will, including one’s right to make the worst decisions for the most noble of reasons. Castiel would know. Yet Heaven and the garrison never had been a home to him in the understanding of the word he only acquired over the years he had spent on Earth. There was only one thing Castiel considered home and it wasn’t a place, but a person. If Dean was home at the bunker, so was he.
“What now?” Dean clapped his hands together. “Anyone else hungry? Whatcha think of breakfast?”
Cas was still lying on the bed where Dean had left him, greeting him with a wry smile. “Ready?” Cas asked.
Sad puppy dog eyes looked at him that would certainly break even the heart of the most heartless of beings. Though, on second thought, probably not. He could think of more than a few assholes they had encountered over the years that wouldn't even blink when confronted with
“What the hell?” Dean exclaimed but Castiel had already flapped his wings, and flew them to their destination, landing them almost instantly. “Son of a bitch! Don’t– Don’t do that again!” Dean turned and gaped, taking in their surroundings. “Holy shit!”
“Son of a bitch!” Dean’s flat hand hit his thigh. “I’m such a fucking idiot!” He could see Cas’ hand twitch as if the angel wanted to reach towards Dean’s. But it was such a fleeting moment – he probably was mistaken in Cas’ intentions. Yet, Dean wished it wasn’t just another phantasm. Agitated, he ran the fingers of both hands through his hair. “What have I done?”
“Thank you, Castiel. The others helped me to understand that.”
Castiel looked back down at the pie, eager to find some clues for this odd present. Someone, probably Dean, had used fondant to write the Greek letter pi on it, accompanied by the first 10 digits of Archimedes’ constant. A wordplay. However, it still didn’t explain anything.
“Yes, Dean. Yes!” Tears, he couldn’t stop falling, were streaming down his face. “This is real. We’re real.”
Turning it, Rowena had left them a few more lines:
“Tortured, you mean,” Dean grumbled but once again Castiel remained silent. “So what changed yesterday?” His friend turned fully towards him, Castiel’s arms still holding him. The others were nearly forgotten.
The battle had left heavy marks on him. His wings were singed, several feathers smouldering, and he barely had kept his ability of flight. One of his heads had been severely wounded. Yet he had been the lucky one. Their losses had been enormous. From his unit, only Uriel had survived their last attack as far as he could tell and even he had been forced to flee, heavily wounded. Everyone else had been slaughtered in their attempt to breach the last gate on their way to this cursed circle of Hell. It was the deepest and worst as far as he could assess. The fires, the heat, the stench, the screams, the despair – everything reeked of human misery and utter hopelessness.
“Dean? You’re okay?” Cas sounded alarmed.
Finally! They are getting somewhere...
When Cas had left the library with Dean in his arms, Sam found Sully sitting somewhere in the back, smiling.
Remembering what had happened earlier when he had left, he turned fully towards his friend. Brushing his ear with his lips, he hugged him, whispering, “I’ll be back. I’ll always be back.”
Dean rolled his eyes but relented. “Was?”
Still, it hurt that Jack hadn’t brought back Cas as the first thing. He had smiled sadly at him, talking about how Dean eventually would understand. Damn it! He needed help not weird prophecies. If it was doable, why not just get on with it?
“This about the damn pizza man?” Dean asked from behind the front door.
Suddenly, Castiel heard a shrill, manic laughter. He looked at the principal whose features had changed. Gone were the nice and gentle eyes of the principal. Instead the lines were contorted with rage and loathing.
“Yeah, Sammy!” Dean exclaimed, glimpsing at Cas who was still smiling back. “We’re awesome!”
“Shuddup!” Dean growled but a tiny smile betrayed him. Turning the key in the ignition, he started the motor and the Impala came to life.
The sound of Baby running freely on the road had been calming enough to keep Dean in the realm of his dream moments longer than usual. Yet when everything came rushing back to his mind, it crushed him like a freight train. Dean’s body already felt like it.
Son of a bitch! Couldn’t she at least have called in advance?”
The doorbell rang again. And again.
?” Dean didn’t know whether he should laugh out loud or fully activate his panic mode. This was too weird. Of all the books in the room, Lucifer’s son had picked
“Mammoths? Seriously? Those hairy bastards?” Dean glared at Castiel.
“Why can
“Of course,” Dean muttered, rolling his eyes. Castiel saw when the words finally settled in. “Wait? What? That wasn’t you?”
“Yes.”
“Don’t worry. They won’t interfere,” Jack beamed. “They are busy restoring and rebuilding Heaven.”
But giving up like that? No. This could not be it. This was not what he wanted. This was not what Cas had wanted for him. Cas had died to save him.
It was both too much, simply overwhelming, yet still not enough. He wanted more, so much more. All of Dean. Everything the man he loved, who he had loved for years, was willing to give him.
Dean just stared and suddenly burst into roaring laughter. Tears were running down his face. His hands had found the plumage at the wing joints on his back, petting feathers and skin alike.
Dean looked to his left and met Cas’ eyes. The angel smiled broadly at him before he closed the distance for yet another peck. Dean definitely could get used to this, although he probably would never take anything of it for granted. Being allowed even this single moment of happiness with Cas was unbelievable. There wasn’t anything like happiness for him in this universe.
Dean’s anger drained from him. “Shit!” His friend took a deep breath. “Who wouldn’t gift you stuff? You deserve everything. You’ve given everything. It’s time to give something back to you. Besides, you stay in the Bunker. Ain’t you?” Dean almost whispered the last words.
So, all Castiel allowed himself was sitting close behind Dean and listening to his breathing. It was more than Castiel could wish for, more than he was usually allowed, and more than he usually allowed himself. Still, it wasn’t enough. It would never be enough.
