He could feel the way his stomach rolled as he was held, his thighs stuck together, chin pressed down, causing more rolls. So many rolls. So much fat. He couldn’t even enjoy Castiel’s warmth, to focused on his spiraling thoughts, sending him further into anxiety.
When they got home Claire made her way to her room. She sat on the edge of her bed and stared at the photo on her bedside table. They looked happy, like any other family out at the park. Dean holding her feet to keep her safe on his shoulder, Jack just a bundle of yellow blankets, his small hands reaching up to Cas.
Though most of the bruises were large, up close Sam could see smaller ones. Hickeys that scattered across his collar bones, and lower neck. “Why are you still living with him?” Sam finally mustered. “You’re old enough to leave. You don’t even have to quit hunting, Lee’s a hunter, he knows the life.”
He never saw Lee again after that, or had the feelings, and deep down Dean could believe he was fixed. That was all he needed was a beating that was until Castiel came.
From his corner of his eye he could see Cas step closer, a habit the other had picked up on since they’d left. If Dean was near the child, if he touched Jack, even as simple as helping zip up his jacket, Cas was there, tense, eyes on Dean as if waiting for something. Dean had yet to mention it, though he certainly had noticed, especially that no matter what was happening Cas refused to leave Jack alone with Dean.
When the final bell rang and Dean stepped out of the school he was met with falling snow, small flakes that fluttered around him, leaving a thin blanket over the parking lot and cars that filled it. The sky above a darkening grey, while the chill that filled the air bit at Dean’s cheeks, leaving his eyes watery and jaw clenched.
He pushed open the drivers door, making sure to give Sam one last glare before he got out. “Fuckin’ idiot.” Dean continued to complain as he walked to the building's front door, typing in the code before he pushed open the front door, and stepped into the main entrance.
Saving it would be the best choice, yet Dean couldn’t bring himself to not picture the ring. To not imagine how Cas’s eyes would light up as Dean opened the box, he’d say yes, Dean had never been so certain of anything in his life. Cas would say yes, and then they'd kiss, holding onto one another as if it was their last moments alive.
Sam lent forward, pressing his elbows to the table top, while a smirk tugged at his lips, "then talk to him."
The man raised a hand, adjusting the thick glasses he wore. “Anything you would like,” The man began, “How you’re feeling, why you chose to come, worries, concerns, anything you feel comfortable with.”
He knew the house, yet staring at it, through the falling snowflakes, only brought dread. A deep unease that came every Friday night when he walked up the stairs to pick Jack up, and every Sunday evening when he walked back up them to drop Jack off.
“Dean why not?” He clenched his jaw, vision beginning to blur with tears. How could he tell the other that it felt good, that knowing he was that sick ment he was doing something right. How could he tell Cas he enjoyed it, needed it, loved it. Dean attempted to take a breath though it came out as a gasped sob. “You can talk to me.”
He stumbled through the apartment hall, back through the kitchen, and into the building hallway, where he stopped in front of Castiel’s apartment door. He raised his fist hesitating over the wood. He couldn’t hear anything, and for a second he’d wondered if he’d imagined the noise, had the withdrawal gotten that bad within only a day. Dean exhaled before he harshly knocked on the door. “Hey?” Dean yelled, “Cas?”
For a moment Dean stared back before he took her hand, glaring as he shook it, “It’s great to meet you,” Dean replied, making sure his voice was thick with sarcasm.
Cas’s blue eyes darted from the two brothers before they rested on Dean. They were slightly wider than normal, his usually perfect stance no longer but instead Dean could see him shift his weight every so often from foot to foot.
Dean missed it, he didn’t realize how much he missed until there was almost fingertips away. Teasing him from what he could have had.
“It’s okay.” Dean shook his head, a shaken gasp parting his lips, one that he wasn’t sure whether was to breathe or cry. “Dean it was a nightmare you’re okay.”
Cas turned at the sound of his son. Stepping the slightest bit away from Dean, which let Dean exhale a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “Why aren’t you asleep, Bee?”
Sam rolled his eyes, though still grinned, taking Dean’s offered hand. He followed the other to the front door, his fingers playing with the sleeve of his sweater as he could still feel the unease in his stomach. It was something he didn’t think would be going away anytime soon.
Jack glanced to Sam and Eileen before he leant on until lips were almost brushing against Dean’s ear, his warm breath flaring along the side of Dean’s face. “Daddy doesn't know how to,” Jack said, much louder than a whisper.
"Thank you." Sam whispered, he had lifted his head from his hands, a thankful smile across his face.
He could feel the pain in his heart, the turning of his stomach, as his lips stayed firmly shut, the words stuck in his throat. He didn’t know what to say, or what, of everything he’d destroyed, he was willing to admit to.
Part of him wanted to lie, say he’d just woken up, that he had been asleep, though the lie didn’t seem to come. “Yah, I couldn’t fall asleep.” Dean’s gaze dropped to his glass for a second, the alcohol much easier to look at then Cas’s exhausted expression. “Sorry.”
“The nurse will be here soon to do a final check up then you can leave.” Sam said as he stepped back towards the doorway, pulling his leather jacket closer to his body. He no longer spoke with the fear, or anger from before, instead calm, almost emotionless. “The impala’s in the parking lot, me and the kids are going t’take the subway.”
As Dean spoke he collected his clothing, replacing Cas's towel for his boxer, followed by his jeans. Cas's own gaze following the other, unable to look anywhere else.
I’m going to start by saying this isn’t the chapter I was excited to post but I decided the chapter needed a bit more build up so I’m posting this chapter first!
“I think Santa eats enough pie,” Cas hummed softly, Dean's gaze immediately darting to the other who was sat cross legged on one of their couches, their small cat, Atticus asleep in his lap. His dark hair was just as tousled as Jack’s, and his face was lit in a soft yet teasing smile, crinkling the corners of his eyes, and causing Dean’s heart to skip.
I’m so sorry guys if I’m bothering you with posting so much!! Please tell me if you think it’s to much at once!
As Dean screamed the last words, Charlie’s expression faltered, her expression going from anger, to pure concern. She took a  step forward, though Dean took a step back. He refused to be near her, to be close enough to see every detail of her face, close enough to hear her breath, close enough for her so see the few tears that rolled down his cheeks.
"Fuck !" Dean screamed, both his hands flying into his pockets. He swore his heart stopped, then jumped to his throat, where it stayed as he stared in horror at Castiel who stood in Sam's kitchen. "What are you doing here?"
“Says Peter Pan,” Dean cried, gesturing to his brother's costume. A bright green shirt, and jean pants that he’d managed to find in the exact same shade, matched with the classic green hat.  “You know he doesn’t have a beard, might have to shave that son of a b-” Dean glanced to Ellie, “ird?”
It was sometime between the sixth or fourteenth dose, that Dean found his chest pressed to another man’s. His ears ringing, the beat of the music seeming to shake his whole body, following the rhythm of his racing heart. Everything around him incredibly alive. The music louder, lights brighter, everything so perfect it was impossible to imagine being alive not high.
Dean’s wide eyes looked up to John, with a slightly confused expression, though John could only shift slightly, unsure exactly how he should stand, or where. Things were always that way around Dean.
Dean glanced back at his brother who walked behind with John. “I don’t know!” Dean cried, raising his voice to match the young girls. As they came up to Sam’s apartment Dean used one hand to dig through his pocket, finding his key, “You know if you take my bags, we’ll get to go back sooner.”
“I said I’m fine,” Dean spat. He pushed himself from the ground, legs shaking slightly as he did so, and shoved the keys into Sam’s hand. “Just drive.”
That didn’t seem to calm Dean if anything he seemed even more annoyed, his jaw clenched, and eyes narrowed, a crease forming between his eyebrows. Sam’s own fists clenched. “You’re fifteen you should be at school.”
“Yah,” Dean replied and shifted Jack in his arms so the child rested against his hip. He swallowed. How could it be okay, they’d only just started talking again and now Dean was already going to lose him; to some douchebag that skinned puppies (probably). “I’ve actually got a date too.”
Sam opened his mouth to speak though when his eyes fell on Deans suddenly shaking shoulders, whatever he was about to say had been forgotten. “Dean?” He couldn't stop the shaking in his voice as he moved from behind his brother, to standing in front, meeting Dean’s bruised, and bloody face, that now had tears rolling down.
Sam gave a small nod, his jaw staying clenched, and his chin raised the slightest. “Benny told me about the reporter.” Dean didn’t reply, instead looking down to the pizza, a small breath parting his lips. His heart hammered in his chest, and though he should have felt sad, or broken at that point he could only feel the numbness. Tugging at his chest, and licking across his fingers. “The crash wasn’t your fault.”
When they’d finally gotten out of the club, and were back on the streets, Dean pulled his arm back. Stopping Lee in his tracks.
“Jo,” she replied, their hand shake lingered for a second before the woman slowly brought her hand back, her bright eyes dropping down Dean’s body then back to his face. “I know you must have lots of plans tonight.” Her voice was low, and as she paused, Dean’s gaze once again dropped. Studying the skin she’d made no attempt to hide, her slim waist, smooth thighs, breasts, where his eyes lingered for a second before he lent out what he hoped was a steady breath and looked back to her face. “But a few of us are going to Balazather’s tonight, and if the rumors are true, i’m sure it’s a party you’ll enjoy.”
“Withdrawal symptoms last for about ten weeks, in the rehab facility we help make that time easier to go through by offering on call therapists, a healthy lifestyle, and medical care if needed.” The women spoke in a kind but robotic tone, as she repeated the speech she’d surely said a million times before. “Our thirty day program is incredibly beneficial, but patients find the most success in our ninety day program.”
A pain burned at Dean's heart as he watched the other walk away, having to clench his jaw to stop the tears from falling. Fuck.
“If I wasn’t a coward I would have used the bleach .” Dean finally looked back to Billie. He could feel his heart hammering, the night still running through his head. The soup burning against his throat, then burning worse when he threw it back up. Lee finding him curled up on the floor, sweaty, and covered in vomit.
let's also take this time to remember prides history: THE FIRST ONE WAS A RIOT! (began by trans women of colour)
It never got easier, walking along the path, up to what once had been his home. Though now it seemed harder then ever, each step more forced then the last, as Jack’s face stayed buried in his shoulder, and arms around his neck.
"I'm your brother, do you think I don't see the articles? The one night stands and missed meet and greets because you passed out in some alley?" Sam spat, his voice low enough that the kids wouldn't be able to hear from their bedroom. "You can't be doing that while you're here, I can't be finding you out of your mind in bars, or de- you have to be clean, and sober, the kids need you Dean. I need you. Do you understand?"
Cas looked back up from Jack to Dean, holding eye contact for longer than anyone Dean had ever seen, his blue eyes piercing. Finally Cas gave the smallest nod, he stood back up carrying his son to Dean and then placing him on Dean’s lap.
“Not the 2017 one or 90’s,” Caas shook his head in response, “You have to! They’re both shit but it’s just something everyone has to see.”
Dean had immediately made his way to the back corner, as far away from Cas as possible, and instead talked to Garth who at some point had joined him. The other happily talking about his dentel clinic, while Dean hummed along, more focussed on watching Jack play with the other kids, then whatever the other was saying.
That’s how it had always been, they were always standing to close, touching in the smallest ways, any chance they could get. Trusting each other to always be there, for warmth, for comfort, for when they needed the other.
Though Dean’s gae stayed on the child he could feel Cas’s eyes burning against him, watching every movement made, every shift closer to the child, and every shift Jack made closer to Dean. He didn’t need to look up to know the expression that would sit across Cas’s features, lips in a  frown, eyes narrowed, emotionless and unreadable.
“Cas.” Dean said, either as a plea, or in an attempt to convince him, Dean wasn’t sure. He took a small step closer, not that there was much room between them to begin with. “Fuck man, please.”
Dean turned and Claire immediately looked away, biting at her lip as the guilt tugged at her stomach. “How was Jack's Soccer game?” She asked, keeping her gaze forward despite Dean’ eyes still on her.
Dean looked up, his gaze meeting hers. His eyes were rimmed red, though gentle as he gave her a soft smile that she forced herself to return.
His chair crashed, and without a second glance, Dean stomped away making sure each footstep was as heavy as possible.
“Why do you gotta know?” Dean asked, not looking up. His thumbs hesitated over the screen for a second, before he quickly typed put a message. ‘You ok? -Dean’
“Ladies.” Dean finally snapped, “we get you’re both pretty.” He took a deep breath, the air barely filling his lungs as he looked to Zachariah, Crowley's glare burning against the side of his head “So what? I pop a few pills and my panic attacks stop?”
“No!” The man quickly cried. “I think the one you have is perfect, and even after hearing it three times I think your speech is also perfect. Now shall I ring you up?”
“Your siblings?” Dean asked as he felt Cas stand next to him, the others breath low, and calming. He took the smallest glance towards the other, just in times to see Castiel nod.
“Dean Winchester,” Castiel began in his usual steady voice. That was all it took before the tears began rolling down Dean’s face, a hand going to his mouth to stop the sobs that he knew would be quick to follow. “There are billions of people in this world, there are endless possibilities, and I understand that you don’t believe in faith, despite that we somehow came together.”
Dean’s lips parted and for a moment he could only stare, any thought he’d once had gone, as his gaze went from Cas’s shirt, to his eyes. “Shit,” Dean finally breathed, still more to himself then Cas. “Shit,” He repeated.
Dean took a step forward, Sam suddenly seeming weighed down with Ellie in his arms. “I think we should get her home.”
Dean took a deep breath, his grip around the bag stripes tightening. “Yah, well what do you want me to do?” Dean snapped, “Ditch him and the kid on the side of the street? Fuck them over, cause life hasn’t enough.”
“Shit.” He looked down to his phone, keeping one hand on the steering wheel, using the other to pick up his phone, and press the home button, lighting his phone screen. Sure enough Sam was right, the word Friday printed out in the normal block letters, below the time, 7:49 am. “I’m on my way now, you can leave for work.”
“Yah.” Dean brought his hands to his face, running them through his hair slowly. A breath filled his lungs, then another. Everything in his body felt like electricity, not the kind that came from cocaine, something which was pure and understable, this was confusing. A mess of anger, and panic. Fear for Cas for Jack, hammering his heart, electrifying every inch of his skin.
“Because I’m fuckin’ stupid,” Dean snaps, voice shaking as he speaks, “I’m stupid Cas, I can’t even get a fuckin fifty precent on an essay.”
Sam’s expression dropped, and immediately Dean’s grin followed, his darting across his brother in concern. “It’s stupid,” Sam finally mumbeled, Dean’s gaze not dropping, and instead watching every movement his brother made. A swipe of his tongue across his bottom lip, his left hand running through his hair, his right hand tightening around the ax he carried. “Everythings going to be fine, but-”
He could taste it against his throat, burning through and his nose, as he threw up the alcohol. Eyes squeezed shut with each retched noise that fell from his lips.
He tries to speak more but the words won’t come as sobs rake his throat, tears and snot staining his face. He can barely feel Cas’s arms around him, his own grip around Cas tight as if he was the only thing keeping Dean standing, and maybe he was.
At first it had bothered John, though now. He’d grown to live with it, he still had Mary, and that was all that mattered.
Dean took a hesitant breath, his eyes darting across Cas’s face and then to his lips. “I found some Led Zeppelin.” Dean finally said, raising the cd’s through his eyes stayed on Castiel, his breaths low. “They don’t have physical graffiti but Led Zeppelin three and four are still awesome.”
He could feel the smallest shaking in his arms, and the occasional gasp for breath. “It’s going t’be okay,” Dean whispered, so soft he wasn’t sure the other had heard him. “We’re going to find him, I promise.”
Dean took a hesitant breath. , he knew Charlie was right, it had been over a month since he had bought the ring, but the timing never seemed right. Something always went wrong whether it was the weather or or car problems, things just couldn’t be perfect. “I’ve tried to, I just- I just want everything to be perfect, you know? What if he doesn’t even say yes?”
They were supposed to be okay, everything was supposed to be okay after they saved Cas. That’s how it’d worked every other time he came back, no matter how bad life spiralled around them, no matter who else they’d lost, no matter what big bad they were facing; Cas would come back and it was as if Dean had breathed for the first time. Cas returning had always been his moment of hope, the reminder that no matter what happened, no matter who left him, the angel would always be there.
Cas looked up to Dean, “of course.” For a second it seemed like he was going to stand up to say goodbye, though as he glanced back to Logan just for a second, he instead stayed sitting, giving Dean a small smile. “Thank you.”
Standing there at the side of the road, in the middle of nowhere, Cas is kissed by Dean for the first time. And second. And third...
«I’m not going anywhere, Sam. Im not going hunting. I’m getting Cas back. And I might not go hunting after that either.» He shocks even himself with the words, but as Dean studies his brother, he can see that Sam both understands, but also has been expecting his next words. «I think it’s great what you are doing with the young hunters. And I really want you to keep on going, I admire everything you and Eileen are doing. But I think I’m done. I think I want to take a step back. Watch you shine. Watch you save the family business. But I’m done.»
“How long have I been asleep?” His eyes wander from Dean to their hands, resting above his heart. He doesn't say anything about it, but Dean notices the way his lips carefully smiles at them.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Fine, I want to do certain things with him that if not for obvious reasons would result in a child. Better Sammy?"
She opened her mouth, though before she could get the words out Dean was turning her way and her gaze quickly dropped to the plate in front of her. The sounds of footsteps came then from the corner of her eye Claire watched as Dean set a tray of pancakes onto the table.
“Dean-” There was a hesitant pause before Sam continued. “I don’t think you should be driving them right now.”
“Thanks,” Dean mumbled, taking the mug Chuck offered him. The glass was burning against hisi numb fingers, though in some way it was reassuring, the pain helping him focus, keeping his panic at bay.
“Kid,” Dean whispered, Jack immediately looking up from Cas’s door where he stood, an arm raised, one hand wrapped around the door knob. “Why’re you up?”
Before Lee could reply, Jack cut him off. “Bean!” The child cried, jumping up from where he had sat, toys completely forgotten about as he ran towards Dean.
So this is based off of a really amazing request, that I defiantly did not do justice. Even close, I'm actually really annoyed with how bad, and boring this turned out.
This time Dean didn’t argue instead twisting his body so he laid on his side, facing the passenger window. He let his eyes close, for a second doing nothing but listening, to his breathing, to Bobby’s, to the hum of the truck's engine. The sounds all soft, luling him to sleep.
“No, just never pictured him as a number one grandpa,” Dean shrugged, “I always saw him as more of a grandpa joe type.”
The sound of crunching snow filled his ears, and his gaze quickly darted back to Charlie, who had taken a step closer, followed by a second. Dean himself staying frozen in spot, watching, breathing, heart hammering in his chest.
The only thing he could hear was the hammering of his own heart, mocking him for how alive he was. Why couldn’t his body just let him die, let the cocaine win, and kill him happy. Why did his heart continue to beat, why was he so fucking alive.
Dean looked away from Sam, and down the side of the deck. The streets below had begun to darken from the setting sun, though even still most of the bushes and plants blurred together from the height, the only thing clear being the path itself. Would he die if he fell. Dean didn’t think so. “Very!”
They stepped into the mall, somehow the lights became even brighter than before. Cas had stopped to face the brothers Jack and Ellie still at his side. John a few steps away. “So how about,” Dean began, getting the attention of the rest of the group, “you guys make a plan, and i’ll run to the bathroom? We all agree?” Dean paused for a second, though not long enough for a reply, “awesome!”’
Dean gasped for a breath attempting to calm his racing heart, though there was no stopping it as a tear rolled down his cheek, followed by a second, then a third. He could trust Cas.
“Dean?” Cas asked, which Dean nodded to in response, eyes still watching Cas's every movement. The way he didn’t shift often, standing so still he could’ve been a statue, with his usual perfect posture. “Are you alright?”
“Castiel,” Lee corrected, Dean only humming in response. He turned to face the other resting his shoulder against his own locker.
The word fell from Dean’s lips, he was sure of it, though still through the hammering of his heart he couldn’t hear. Through the blaring wind that ruffled his hair. Everything spun around him, the crowd that held him back, the fear, the railing of the bridge that Dean couldn’t reach, the fear, the back of his brother’s head, the fear.
Fuck people. After a six hour morning shift at Walmart followed by a five hour shift at McDonald’s filled with bitchy people and forced smiles, Dean was done with people. Especially loud neighbours that spent nights fighting until they broke up, only to get back together a few days later. If he had to listen to make up sex even once that night he was complaining to the landlord.
“We chose to be together, through every day, through every fight, through every impossible battle. We choose each other.”
Along his side. Along his chest. Outlining scars that Cas had long ago memories. It all made his lungs seem to collapse, breathing seemed like an impossible task.
There was a moment of silence. Dean only able to hear the beating of his heart, eyes never leaving Sam, who somehow looked calm. How he did it, Dean didn ‘t know. His breathing seeming to become more of an effort, as a lump formed in his throat.
"Did you like the movie?" Dean asked. Cas hummend in question, looking over to Dean, through the darkness the small features of his face were unnoticeable, only his sharp noise, and smile as he looked at Dean. "From a few nights ago?"
Dean laughed, moving his phone so it no longer recorded the penguins and instead pointed at Jack. The child looking up to Dean with a wide grin, his eyes bright, and hair done in  it’s usual mess of blond strands.
Dean gave the car one last glare before he stomped forward, walking to the passenger door and getting in. As the engine hummened to life Dean rested his head against the window, the glass cold against his burning skin. He wasn't high, at least wasn't at his peak. It had been barely half an hour after he'd taken his third or fourth dose when they arrested him. Throwing him into an empty cell where he stayed for what felt like years, but couldn't have been more than two hours. As he went through the peak of his high, and then the downfall, the worst part, when everything in his body ached, and all he could think about was another dose.
Sam’s gaze stayed locked on his brother’s face. He hated how Dean’s features sat, emotionless, unreadable, lips pressed in a tight line, and jaw locked. His shoulders back in a stiff, perfect posture, a similar stance to when their dad was around.
Dean brought the girl closer to his chest as his body shook with sobs. His grip tightened as he hoping hat his own heat would warm her freezing skin, or in some miracle the sound of his own heart beat would start her's.
Whether it was meant to be that way, or if he was simply being Cas, Dean wasn’t sure, though either way he could feel his stomach tug. His lips suddenly incredibly chapped no matter how many times he licked at them and throat dry, the words he’d been wanting to say suddenly stuck.
“Shit” Dean hummed through a mouthful of food, because apparently eating with your mouth closed was too hard of a concept “that sucks.”
Dean took a step backwards, towards Castiel’s apartment as Sam nodded in understanding. “Don’t bother him for too long.”
Crowley’s call was still clear in his foggy mind, the press thought he was back on drugs. He wished he was back on drugs, wished he could feel the stability that cocaine brought. The euphoria that would cloud his mind. The way, that when the shitty feeling came as reality fell back into place, he could just take another dose.
“Yah.” Jack raised one of his small hands, using it to push away Dean’s own hand, and grab the end piece of the stethoscope. He raised the piece up, pressing it against Dean’s chest with a small smile. He giggled as he kept the piece pressed to Dean’s chest, a small smile spreading across Dean’s own lips.
A grin spread across Dean’s lips as he watched Sam's expression drop. “You’re an idiot,” Sam said, though he still pulled a set of keys from his pocket and handed them to Dean.
Dean followed Cas into the arcade, the lighting immediately becoming dimmer much to Dean's appreciation. Though with the dim lights the noise increased, the low chatter of the mall being replaced by the screaming of children, and buzzing of various arcade games. It caused his head to spin as he staggered after Castiel and Jack, the young boy having immediately ran off and towards a small basketball machine.
Through the whole first third Dean kept his mouth shut, not speaking until half way through the final quarter.  “How’s he been doing?” Dean finally asked. He shifted his body so he could look at Charlie, his friend looking back.
His stomach twisting as his socked feet padded across the wooden floor, the mug warm against his hands, filled with a mix of coffee and whisky.
Dean shifted his weight from one foot to the other as the women disappeared through the doorway, a light feeling coming to his stomach. A moment of hope.
“I want to,” Cas’s chest raised as he took a deep breath, his gaze going back to the boys on the court. What was he thinking, if things were okay between them he would have said. If things were okay between them, he would have trusted Dean. “I should begin warming up.”
Dean watched as Jack rocked on his heel slightly instead of Sam now looking at the ground. The child shook his head. He looked back up at Dean, his lips out in a slight pout. “Wis Bean.”
“Of course,” Cas turned, giving Dean a smile. He wasn’t sure of it was meant in resource, though Dean took it that way, able to feel the tension between them begin to melt. “Sorry we have to part so soon.”
He didn’t wait for a response, instead turning and running away. Through the arcade, and back into the crowded mall, he first glanced to the left, and then the right, where he just got a glance of Castiel’s black hair.
He sat up properly running his hands across his face. Some nights, the ones when the withdrawal was the worst he could still remember it perfectly, the steering wheel in his hand, the spinning of his car, and the screams. The screams that would echo through his head, keeping him up late into the night.
It had began unnoticed by Castiel, but within days it had become no secret that even simple tasks had become incredibly hard for Dean. From spilling juice, too being unable to go back to his previous job at the local auto shop, all because he couldn't control the constant shaking of his hands. Castiel had suggested, if not begged him to see a therapist. To get some help for not only his shaking hands but for the ptsd and anxiety that had come from being a soldier. Yet no matter how much Cas insisted Dean would only brush it off and reply with a 'it'll go away eventually'.
It continued on for another ten minutes, Dean aimlessly wandering up and down various streets, while Castiel and Jack followed close behind until they came up to a small record shop. It couldn’t have been much bigger than Sam’s living room. The center of the room filled with bins of records, while the left wall was hung with guitars and the right with stacks of cd’s, across the back a man was standing behind a desk, aimlessly flipping through a magazine.
“Claire!” Jack cried as she dragged him across the teachers parking lot by his wrist. His footsteps were uneven trying to keep up with her long strides and his backpack dangled from her one shoulder yet Claire didn’t stop. She needed to put as much distance as she could between her and that stupid impala, she couldn’t spend another second listening to blaring music or he rattling of the air conditioning.
Dean opened his mouth the slightest bit in shock. Staring back at his brother to see if Sam was serious. “To fuckin’ who?” Dean cried, “Why in hell should I be apologizing?”
The words hung through the silent stairwell, and for a second Dean didn’t think he could breathe. His breath stuck in his throat as he watched Castiel, who still sat so emotionless and still. “What about Jack?” Dean finally asked.
Slowly she flipped through the scrapbook, hands shaking as she studied each page. The paper everything that had been glued to, the decorations that covered it, pictures all paired with small descriptions of where and when they’d been taking. Most were of her between birth and one years old though there were a handful that had someone else in it, Dean or Cas, occasionally Chuck or one of her aunts and uncles.
For a moment he considered doing as Jack wanted, turning the engine back on, and driving back to his apartment, where they could spend the night watching movies and eating junk food. Fall asleep on the couch then make pancakes for breakfast. Just one more night that Dean could spend with Jack, one more night where his apartment would be filled by giggles and stories instead of the heavy silence that usually weighed throughout it.
"El maybe you should give Cas some space." Dean said, which the young girl turned her head to giving Dean an emotionless stare before turning back to Cas.
“Tonight you’ll just have to be lame Superman,” Dean teases as he takes a seat on Jack’s bed. He knows it’s not a good time, Cas is obviously tired, and Jack is starting to get sick, something that always leaves him a little more sensitive, but he can’t help himself. He knows it’s worth it when Cas sends him a glare, an expression that Dean finds far cuter than he ever should.
“Fuck.” Dean screamed as he slammed Sam’s front door closed, throwing his keys and wallet onto the kitchen.
"Yah very nice." Dean didn't try to hide the sarcasm as he gave the other man a smile, before pulling his hand away. Logan was nice looking, Dean would admit that much, with short almost buzzed cut hair, that grew into his stubble across his lower face and upper lip. He had cupid bow lips that sat in a tight line as his smile fell. He looked like the stereotypical businessman, handsome but in a snarky way, as if he was- and knew he was- better than everyone else.
They didn’t stay up much longer after that and soon went to bed, not that Dean had ever planned to actually fall asleep. He refused to, terrified of the nightmares to come, unless It was with a few bottles in hand, and with only one bottle of gin left, that wasn't possible. Instead Dean was left to stare into the darkness, the silence filled by nothing but his low breaths, until sometime after two in the morning when that was broken by Jack’s sobs.
Dean stepped around Ellie walking to her bedroom, and immediately to Jack who was sat on the floor. “Hey kid,” Dean whispered softly. He crouched down, reaching his arms out to pick Jack up. The moment Jack was in his arms, the child wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck, and buried his face into Dean’s shoulder continuing to sob. “It’s okay,” Dean hummend.
Dean stepped forward pulling his fiance into a tight hug. He rested his chin against Cas’s shoulder as the other wrapped his arms around Dean in a just as tight hug. For a moment he couldn’t speak, a mix of emotion twisting his stomach, his heart hammering frantically in his chest.
For a moment Dean didn’t argue. Instead wrapping his arms around her shaking body, resting his chin against the top of her head. It felt good to have her in his arms. Innocent. As if the night before had never happened. As if everything was perfect.
“Talk you up?” Dean turned and walked to the door, Charlie following him into the hallway. “What should I say? you're smart, kind, and spend all day playing pretend?”
“I like this song.” Cas hummened softly from next to Dean. Dean didn’t move his eyes from the ceiling even as he heard the smallest shuffle from Cas. The only movement he made being the tapping his finger that followed the beat.
“Where’s my clothing?” Dean grumbled. He began pushing himself up, continuing to do so, even as his head spun, the walls blurring together.
“I don’t know! But you don’t watch movies, and you don't listen to music!” Dean said, “do you just sit around all day doin’ nothin’?” Dean popped the trunk of his impala throwing his and Castiel’s grocery bags into it before he slammed it shut. When he’d double checked that it was locked they began walking out of the grocery store parking lot, and onto the fairly empty streets, thanks to it being an early Tuesday morning. Dean tugged his jacket around his body as they walked the early sepetembr air holding an unavoidable chill.
"Sam," Dean insisted, but his brother didn't stop. "Sam! Sammy!" Sam finally stopped, a few strands of hair falling in his face as he looked to Dean. Now in the brighter lighting Dean could see the dark bags that outlined under Sam's eyes, and the ashen colour that had taken over his usual tan skin tone. "It's fine. My house is much worse." That was a lie, his house was pristine clean, though only thanks to the people he paid to clean it. "Just tell me how things are going."
Dean looks up as she pauses next to him, her gaze staying locked on his own as she places his essay face down onto his desk. Her expression sat somewhere between annoyed and concerned, with her lips pressed in a tight line but eyes wide.
A slow breath filled his lungs, the smell of sick burning in his lungs, followed by a second breath. He could almost die there. Simply not stand, it wouldn’t take long for the stavaton to take over.
“And you’re getting snot on my shirt,” Cas replied, causing a smile to tug at her lips. She closed her eyes and Cas brought his hand to her back once again rubbing small circles there.
“Bio,” Dean grumbled, eyes staying on his locker, instead of Lee who was lent against the locker next to him. He was another one of the six boys staying with Sonny, and the only one Dean had taken any interest in, willing to talk and be near him. He would never admit it though Dean was even starting to enjoy the other’s company. “We’re making a fuckin’ poster with a partner, about bacteria, or some shit like that.”
He shook his head turning back to the toilet. “Get me wrench.” He could hear Sam’s footsteps approaching though he didn’t care, instead he grabbed one of the pipes the metal rough against his hands as he attempted to twist it off. He wasn’t sure what he’d do when he got the pipe but that was a problem for the future, at that moment all he  could care about was getting the cocaine back. “Get me a fuckin’ wrench!”
He clenches his jaw, forcing a small nod, “you chose three texts, each of those should have had their own paragraph where you explained why you chose them. We talked about this together, do you remember?”
“Claire,” Cas said as she sat down. She hummed in response. “Dean has offered to give you a ride to school today.”
“Yes.” He took a forced breath, glancing to his right where he could see the crowd. Quickly, as he met someone's eyes , he looked back to Dean, just him and Dean, practising like they had the night before, no one watching. Just him and Dean. “This is just incredible stupid.”
Dean didn't look up as the officer and the other man, Sonny, talked, his eyes staying on the handcuffs that keep his wrists together. His usual pale skin was now scattered with red and purple bruises, any skin not bruised instead stained with blood. He could still feel the pain in his right temple and along his right cheek from where he'd been punched, though it was nothing compared to the weight that settled in his stomach.
He should say something. Anything. A compliment, an apology, a joke about the shitty music that played, cause it was shitty, really shitty. Yet nothing came, Dean’s mouth suddenly dry as he glanced to the table next to their own, where a couple was having a much better date than theirs.
“You’re okay,” he felt the other’s arms wrap around him pulling Dean’s shaking body into a tight hug. Dean himself couldn't move, only squeezing his eyes shut, mouth still open gasping for breath. He wasn’t sure if the other’s touch made it better or worse, whether it was gentle, or harsh, keeping Dean alive, or searing his skin, with each slow stroke of his back.
“I’m going to get Sam.” Dean hummened in objection, shaking his head the slightest. His eyes slowly fluttered opened, a smile grazing his lips as through half lidded eyes he looked up to Cas. “Do you need to go to the hospital?” Dean shook his head again. He didn’t think he could speak, his throat too dry.
A shaken breath parted his lips as he glanced across each man. Both kings looked somewhere between exhausted and furious, so different from Dean who now held an emotionless expression. Cas’s gaze rested on the other for a second before Dean glanced his way and he quickly looked back to his father.
“Gettin’ breakfast” Dean replied. He placed the tupperware onto the counter, before pulling open the fridge, grabbing the first bottle of beer he could reach. As he closed the fridge the room stood in silence, a stiff one that left Dean tense. The silence continuing as he opened the bottle, and he took his first drink.
His gaze went to Jack, darting across the child’s soft features, his lips parted slightly as he slept, dark eyelashes fluttered shut. Sometimes Dean forgot just how old Jack was, seven, he’d had the child in his life for six years, yet he could have sworn it was only yesterday when he’d first held him in his arms. He remembered the way his heart had practically stopped as he looked at the baby’s round cheeks. The pure joy that had settled in his stomach as the baby’s eyes fluttered open. It was a feeling like any other, a love so different from how he felt about Cas, yet just as strong.
Cas glanced back to Dean, the other looking towards his hands, which now fiddled with the sleeve of his jacket.  He wasn’t sure if Dean had a best behaviour, or even a decent behaviour, as far as Cas was concerned he could be nothing more than cocky or rude.
"Fuck Dean!" Crowley screamened, which was the last thing he said for the rest of the drive. Instead keeping his head forward, and grip firm on the steering wheel. It wasn't until they had pulled up to Dean's house, where paparazzi filled the yard, that Crowley finally turned his head. "This is the plan. You're going to fly to New York, where-"
The other turned away, almost half way down the first flight of stairs when Dean once again stopped him. “You don’t deserve him,” Dean yelled.
Dean let his hands fall from his eyes and instead to his mouth, covering his lips as a sob parted them.
The smallest smile tugged at Dean’s lips, though that brought no ease to Sam’s still twisting stomach. “Whatever you want doctor phil.”
“Three years and just under ten months,” Dean corrects. He shrugs his shoulders looking back down to the ring. “But who really keeps track of that crap.”
After a second the door was pulled open, revealing a very annoyed looking Logan. “What the hell!” he yelled. He quickly closed his mouth though, as he seemed to realize what he had done. “Sorry Dean- it's- it’s been a rough morning,” he said through a half laugh, running a hand through his hair. “You know how work gets.”
Cas quickly looked to the floor. He knew it was fake yet that didn’t stop the heat from flaring up his neck and across his cheeks, the women’s laugh ringing through his ears.
Dean could feel the other tense, his gaze finally looking to Dean, wide, and blue, a dark shade, so vibrant, it was almost impossible to imagine as real. “I’m incredibly nervous.”
Is that, the blushing, the leaning in to touches, the heart flutter, everything, how Sam had felt when he fell in love with Jess?
“Dean,” Cas repeats, though Dean doesn’t look up. “Why didn’t you tell me you’d gotten your essay back?”
Dean clenched his fists, gritting his teeth together. “Really?” Dean finally broke his staring match with the other, and looked towards Logan. Fuck Dean hated that man. Fuck he wanted to punch, see how many times it’d take till he could break a tooth. “Are you fuckin’ serious?”
Dean watched the child listen to his heart, until the sound of the door opening came, his head quickly turning to meet Cas who had just stepped in. He looked better with the blood washed off his face, almost normal if it wasn’t for the bruising that covered his jaw, and the way he still held his right arm to his chest.
“Dean,” Sam said in his concerned tone. The only tone he seemed to speak in since Dean had arrived, the worry clear in his expression.
She isn’t so lucky and manages to walk to the passenger door without any fatal injuries. She pulled it open with as much force as she could muster before slamming it shut with a satisfying noise, hopefully causing some kind of damage. A small dent or even a scratch, anything to mess up the untouched paint.
A frown grazed Cas's lips as he tilted his head to the side. It was cute with his eyes squinted and nose scrunched the slightest bit. "I do."
Dean glanced to the other who walked almost shoulder to shoulder with Dean. Close enough that he could feel the other’s heat, the occasional brush of his trench coat against Dean’s hands as their arms swung. They'd been yet to talk about anything, them kissing, what they were, and part of Dean was fine with that.
“I,” she finally began looking back up to Dean who was already looking at her. “I- um, I made you something.”
He flips the page over to read the back, though he doesn’t get more than a glance before the sound of footsteps comes, followed by Jack’s voice, “dad!”
Dean opened the small velvet box raising it as he did so. He kept it raised for another second before closing the box, letting his arms fall back to his side, “what did you think? Would you have said yes?” Dean asked the man behind the counter who looked back with what Dean could only describe as utter exhaustion. “Maybe I should try again with the silver one, you know with the huge fucking diamond.”
He spent the last twenty minutes of class in the halls. Walking around the school or talking with other kids that were wasting time in the hallways. It wasn’t until the bell rang, that he returned to the doorway, the teacher soon calling him back into the room.
Sam’s gaze dropped to his lap. It was easier to stare at his fiddling thumbs, over his friends. Though even still it didn’t stop the unsease in his stomach, something that didn’t seem to leave no matter how many times Sam reassured himself.
“You're standing!” Dean looked back to his friend, holding the other’s gaze. He stared back before slowly sitting on the sidewalk, then laying back so his gaze was on the sky.
The cold air immediately burned against his cheeks, as Dean’s gaze darted to the sky above, the once light sky now a fading pink as the sun hung low in the sky. He let his gaze linger there for another moment before looking to the street in front of him and the truck that had pulled over to the side where Sonny stood. The man was lent against the side of his vehicle, a cigarette brought to his lips as a trail of smoke surrounded him. The whole scene was incredibly relaxed, too relaxed, as if he was picking Dean up from a sports game rather than a police station, something that only weighed on Dean’s shoulders.
Cas looks up, the smallest smile tugging at his lips as he tilts his head to right, a small action that always brings a warmth to Dean’s chest. A comforting feeling that leaves him wanting more, one more look of Cas’s eyes, one more touch of his fingers that were surely frozen from the chilled wind, one more second of just being with the other.
Soon enough Jack was once again in his arms twisting and giggling as Dean carried him towards the snow pile. The snow crunched below his boots until Dean stopped, “three,” he began counting down, swinging Jack forward. “Two,” Dean swung Jack back. “One.”
“I have been alive for billions of years and never met anyone as incredible as you.” Cas’s fingers trailed to Dean’s stomach resting there as Dean held his breath.
“Am I sure if my brother is letting me drive my niece and nephew to school?” Dean asked, raising his voice the slightest bit. He looked at Cas with a raised eyebrow, jaw clenched, daring him to argue back.
Dean shifted slightly. He could feel the silence that hung between them, a kind that caused his heart to race further. Eyes glancing across the others' faces. He hadn’t regretted anything when he’d originally awoken but now, looking at Castiel, the smallest pain came. Regret and maybe guilt growing heavier in his stomach with each passing second.
He jogged to catch up with Dean, who had made no attempt to slow his pace. “Dean,” Sam continued, trying to get the other’s attention. He looked up to his brother, who’s gaze stayed forward. “It was just a joke, you know? I didn’t mean it.”
For a moment Dean’s finger stayed there, the skin burning against his own touch. His eyes fluttered shut, until he heard the door open.
Bella’s lips widened in a dramatic smile, and for a moment Dean thought she was going to laugh. “You think I’m the slut?”
For a moment they sat in complete silence, Dean’s gaze on the empty glass in his hand, studying the little bit of alcohol left in it. His gaze stayed there for another second before he stood from his bed, a low creaking coming as he walked across the room and to the small kitchen where he’d left the bottle of gin.
“Oh so you only fight with your boyfriend!” Dean called as Logan began walking down the staircase. The man stopped walking, and turned to face Dean, his lips in a tight line, eyes narrowed at Dean. “Cause you know he’s not goin’ t’hit back?” Dean spat
“Of course, you haven’t?” Cas shook his head. “Well you’re missing out. Movies are what keep our society from crumbling into a civil war!”
“I don’t get it,” Sam continued anyways, apparently not understanding what shove it meant. “After what dad did, how can you still defend him.”
Dean looked back to his bowl, unable to hold his father intense eye contact any longer, even with his head down he could feel his father’s stare. A scraping of Sam’s fork filled the kitchen, followed by silence. “We- we haven't gotten ours yet.” Dean finally mustered.
“It totally was,” Sam cried. Dean sent a glare to his brother, who sat on the arm chair, while he and Cas sat on opposite sides of the couch. “You looked like that little girl from up.”
“I have a better idea,” Dean stepped away from the railing, letting his hands fall back to his side. “You knock on their door… cause Logan likes ye, and i’ll wait here.”
Her nose burned, vision blurry as she continued to stare at the photo. Even as the sound of the front door opening came, followed by the creaking of the stairs, she didn’t move.
Dean scrunched his nose. “Maybe you shouldn’t have your toes under my feet.” Despite the words, his tone didn’t have the same harshness it had held in the past few days, instead it was lighter, almost teasing.
“Shit,” Dean suddenly whispered. He could feel nothing but his racing heart as he stared at the bag of heroin in horror. What would his brother be thinking. “Did I say nothing?” Dean finally said, breaking the unbearable silence, “I meant no coke.”
There was a moment of silence as Sam didn't speak, his eyes only wondering across Dean. This was the first time those words had left Dean’s mouth, the thought that had been spinning though his head since him and Cas had been dating. He wasn’t good enough, it will only take a matter of time before Cas realizes it.
“Thanks.” Sam gave one last have hearted smile before turning away, Dean following close behind as they walked to John’s desk for one last goodbye, and then back into the now empty hallway where they stood in silence.
He could feel his heart hammer as the curtains began to pull open. Eyes darting to the stage side, did he have time to run.
A man only a few people away raised his microphone to his face, not seeming the least bit fazed by Dean’s screams. “I said,” he began slowly, no one else daring to break the silence except for the occasional camera flash. “Was your arrest in April linked to the car crash? Were you finally deemed guilty.”
“I- wh- I- mommy,” Ellie sobbed, though made no attempt to push Dean away as he wrapped his arms around her, picking her up. He brought her to his chest, Ellie immediately barring her face into his shoulder. She wrapped her arms around his neck, and legs around his waist, body shaking against Dean’s arms with each sob.
He took one last look, across his blown eyes, his pale skin, the freckles that scattered it. All the details that seemed much more interesting when high, before he turned away. Dean stepped out of the bathroom, the ringing through his head becoming a deafening roar, it would die down soon enough.
“You know,” Dean said as he looked over his shoulder to Lee. The other was pulling his pants on, chest still bare, his tanned skin now scarred with nail marks along his chest and shoulders. Dean didn’t need to see his back to know it would be much worse. “You aren’t lookin’ too hot either.”
“Cause he’s a dude.” Dean took a slow breath, attempting to calm his frustration, fighting with Sam wouldn’t get him anywhere. “And I’m not gay.”
Dean smiled down at the kid, then glanced up to Cas who’d stood up. “Sure kid,” Dean hummened, his smile only widening as Jack cheered, bouncing up and down in excitement. He slowly stood, his gazing fall back to Castiel and that adoring look across his face that always came when he watched Jack.
For a moment Cas forgot what he was supposed to say, mouth suddenly dry as his eyes quickly darted down the other's body. "Cas," Dean repeated. He looked back to Dean's face, the other's lips tugged up in a cocky grin.
“I- '' Dean continued, shifting in his spot as he looked back to his hands. “I was sentenced under the three strike law,” Dean finally said, “which gets you locked away for a long time for doing jack shit.”
“We chose to be together, through every day, through every fight, through every impossible battle. We choose each other.”
Cassie tilted her head, the look in her eyes tugging at Dean’s heart. He hated that pitied look from other people, gentle and filled with concern, wanting to help, even they couldn’t. Dean had caused his problems, every single fucking problem he had was his own fault, he didn’t deserve the help, he didn’t deserve pity and like hell he deserved Cas.
It’s when Dean and Jack leave to the movies that Claire finally forced herself to stand, her legs weak under her weight as she walked out of her bedroom and into Cas’s.
Dean shouldn’t want it to go further, and not sex futher, but dates, and soft kisses, and holding hands. He shouldn’t want it, as much as he hated to agree with his brother, but Cas had just gotten out of a relationship. He shouldn’t want it.
He hadn’t been breathing properly since they’d left Lee’s. The cocaine still burning against his leg as his fingers would trace it then fall back to his side when he realized what he was doing. Only for the action to be repeated seconds later.
“Could you describe the events leading up to when you found your husband?” Cas asks his  own gaze glancing down the man’s body, then back to his lips. His perfectly curved lips that sat just parted.
I don't have much to say, this books now as long as the first Harry Potter book, soooo that's kinda long, oops.
A breath parted Dean’s lips, eyes continuing to rest on the door. One last second, that’s all he gave himself before his gaze dropped and he walked away.
It takes a few minutes for Dean to calm Jack down, between a mix of apologies and promises that Superman was in fact a very cool super hero, and in fact almost as cool as Batman. By the time he does, Jack is more than happy to eat his almost melted ice cream, then receive a piggy back ride to the bathroom where he brushes his teeth, and continues to tell Dean about his day. Specifically about the squirrel he’d seen at the park and the tv shows he’d watched in the morning. Finally after a long conversation about a show Dean’s never even heard of, Dean manages to get Jack into bed, whispering a goodnight before he goes to flick off the lights.
He didn’t care about anything else. Not his brother coming to the top of the stairs. Not Jack standing down by the war table wondering what was happening. Nothing mattered.
Cas cups Dean's face with his free hand, gently kissing him, and as he pulls back he simply says, «Look up.»
«Baby better not get dirty.» At that Cas laughs quietly as he watches Dean drive down the bumpy dirt road. The impala's headlight lights up only what is right in front of the car, the forest around them hiding whatever is between the trees.
«What are you doing here?» His arm goes around Dean's neck as he smiles sweetly at Dean and buries his other hand in Dean's hair.
“Yes. It’s an ancient Nordic language. But these are mostly runes of the Elder Futhark. You’re probably looking at the general Younger Futhark translations, but if you look for the Norwegian translations from the 2nd century it’ll be easier.”
«Dean…» Cas closes his eyes so he won’t be looking into his eyes when he says it. He knows what comes next, and for just a moment he wants to think it´s real.
«We have also been talking about maybe seeking out some of the hunters we know are alone or has lost people, leaving them alone. You know we talked about maybe bringing some of the lone hunters here. Especially the young ones.» Sam had brought up the idea some time ago. Wanting to gather and establish some kind of hunter community. Dean thought it was a great idea, he just wasn’t sure if he wanted to be at the forefront of it all. Not anymore.
He though he knew pain, in loving someone that would never love you. But the pain of loving someone, knowing they loved you too, but not being able to tell them because they sacrificed themselves to save his stupid life? That was a pain so strong and hateful that it on several occasions took Deans breath away. He couldn’t, wouldn’t, live like this. Not without
And if Dean thought their first kiss was the best thing he has ever experienced, then Cas’s kisses will for sure kill him slowly. Kiss by kiss..
«Jack, I need you to know that. I know Cas was… is. Is your father and I know he’s your family, but so am I. You are my family too. I would do anything to save you. Of course, you are important to me, of course, I love you. Never ever doubt that again.»
“Dean. Am I... Are we...” half-awake, Cas looks around, eyes are not really focused, mind not really awake.
There was no way the empty would send back Cas, again. So he would go get him himself. Cas didn’t deserve to be left there all alone, he deserved to live. To love. To know he was loved.
«Morning, bro.» Dean follows, reaching for the bacon already before he has gotten his ass on the chair.
He loves how happy Eileen looks when they are deep in conversation like this. And he loves how happy Dean is, watching his angel.
Running faster than he ever has before, Dean reaches Cas and falls to his knees in front of him. His eyes are slightly opened, but not focused. Dean cups his face in his hands, turning his face towards Dean so that Cas finally
The demons are long gone, destroyed by the heavenly light. So Dean takes a step towards his angel. Cas reacts with fear, pulling further away from Dean in fear of hurting him. But Dean reaches out a hand and moves closer with careful steps, eyes wide.
«You knew?» Dean says it with a small chuckle because he knows his brother is probably going to tell him the same thing Jack had told him.
Even if they were bickering, fighting, the love glowed so strongly Sam was almost taken aback by it. Like when Cas had come home from a hunt with a cut on his cheek that needed stitches, and Dean had flipped out. Just the thought of Cas getting hurt or Dean losing him again seemed to break something in Dean. They had stayed mad at each other the rest of the day, not saying a single word to each other, and yet... The touches were there, the fussing when Dean cleaned the wound, the looks they gave each other, the way Dean melted against Cas when they sat down by the fire that night. Dean sitting down beside Cas, leaning against his chest, Cas with a hand around his shoulder.
«Don´t call me cute. I’m not cute.» Dean says as he pretends to look annoyed, hating the word, even though he kind of loves it. As long as it's Cas saying it.
“Good morning?” Sam looks at his brother, confusion all over his face. Dean was never the first one to wake in the morning. Never waking this early. It almost made Sam a little worried.
Again, thank you so much to everyone who has read this, to everyone whos commented and left kudos! I love you guys!!<3
The second day, the loneliness took hold of him and it just got harder and harder to concentrate on the reading. His thoughts went to Cas, and his words. To Cas being alone in the empty, probably not even awake, just… there. He’d been trapped there for almost seven weeks now. 47 days, and 15 hours to be precise. The though sends shivers through him. The thought of Cas not being Cas, of Cas not being alive. Cas, alone. It might be the worst pain Dean had felt in a really, really long time.
«Cas.» Two green sleepy, only half awake, eyes look up at him, a smile spreading across his face as he sees Cas is already awake.
«Well, I am God, so…» That makes them both chuckle a little before Jack breaks the silence again. «At first I might not have seen it, but then again I’m not exactly an expert on human emotion. But it was always there, your love, and when you told me how he was taken, I knew. I've always known you were his happiness, but it was only then that I was certain of
«Okay… Ehm… Dean, I wanted to ask you something.» Dean can feel his whole body tensing up at the words, knowing that if Sam asks about
Eileen's free arm embraces Sam as she bows down to place a kiss in his hair. Whispering words for him to hear as he leans into her touch. Eileen reaches over and takes Jack's hand, raising their hands to place a gentle kiss on the back of their hand.
Words of love are whispered in the dark as their bodies find their purpose together. Sweet words who have lived on their lips for so many years, but never escaped. Words only meant for each other.
Dean's hand lingers by his face, gently stroking it before he takes some of the food from his plate.
But... Dean can’t look away. He can’t turn away. He knows what happens with humans who lay their eyes on a true angel form, but he’s still standing. His feelings are telling him he is safe, that Cas won’t hurt him. Cas might think he can, but Dean knows it won’t happen.
The story of a man afraid of flying, and an angel afraid of falling, who somehow met in the middle. They stayed together despite fate, despite what they are, because they refused to be pulled apart.
“This is not how I was gonna do this.” A heavy sight comes from Dean and when Cas looks at him he has his face hidden in his hands.
He never got to tell Cas that he had always been his. He had loved Cas for such a long time now, that he can’t remember the feeling of not loving him. For so long he had believed that his feelings were unrequited. Dean had believed for so long that angels couldn't feel the same way humans did, he didn’t think they were capable of such emotion. Oh, how stupid he was. So much time wasted. He could have had Cas all this time, had he only had the courage to tell the angel how he felt.
Castiel Winchester, woken by his angel grace, to kiss his husband one last time. Lovingly holding on to the man beside him, he rests their heads together on the pillow, his cheek still wet from the tear that broke free. No pain. No fear. Nothing left undone. Nothing left unsaid. Castiel Winchester’s heart beats one last time, for his man, at 5:59 am.
«Besides, we spent enough nights apart, and I don’t want to spend the night before our wedding alone, or any other night for that matter.»
Dean reaches out to take Cas´s hand, kissing his knuckles. Smiling as the angel's cheeks turn slightly red, and smiling even wider at that stupidly cute smile that spreads on Cas´s face. Dean would usually roll his eyes at people wearing a smile like that, but seeing Cas wearing it, because of Dean, he couldn't help but wanting Cas to wear it all the time.
«I´m not going anywhere until I found a way to…» he can’t even say it. Dean hates the way feelings just screws you up and makes everything so much harder. At the look his brother gives him, he adds, a little too harsh «I don’t wanna talk about it so stop looking at me like that.»
“Well the first thing you ever did was steal my heart, so...” the stunned look on Cas’s face makes him laugh again, earning a small and sweet smile from Cas too.
Forgetting the world, forgetting the time, forgetting where they were going, they stand there in each other’s embrace, only pulling away for the shortest second to draw in a breath, before diving back into each other.
When Eileen finally wakes, her smile lighting up the dark of their room, Sam kisses her before pulling her even closer. They had gone to bed early last night, but they hadn’t slept much. He could still see how she glowed as she lay there in his arms, her naked skin only covered by a thin blanket. He’d never had anything against mornings, but it hadn’t been until he’d started waking with her in his arms, that he truly enjoyed the mornings. Not as much as the nights, but as long as she was beside him, he was smiling.
The pictures aren’t really pictures, but memories made of glass. They’d `stolen´ them from the brothers, Eileen and Cas while they were sleeping. Jack hadn't poked around in their head uninvited, of course not. They had only stolen the feelings their family had dreamt of.
They had all the time in the world. Nothing more to fight or beat. Nothing to worry about. Only live. Finally being able to live. To love. They had all the time in the world, the rest of their time, together.
«Yeah,» Sam smiles at that. They’ve never talked about it before, and yet she understands it’s completely. Because it’s something that anyone can see when looking g at the hunter and the angel. «I didn’t understand it at first, but when I first saw it, I couldn’t help but not see it. It was in everything he did. Everything they did. The longing looks they shared. The careful words. Even the fighting and the harsh words. It was all there. When Cas died, we both lost him, but I also lost Dean. It was as if he had just given up, and he was slowly falling apart, falling from life. And then Cas returned, and once again Dean was
Sams words both calm him and make him even more nervous. «He deserves better. I’m not worth all of that.»
The angel’s smile matches his for the rest of the day, and each time when their eyes meet again, although it’s not really possible, their smiles widen even more.
Leo, Xand, and Mathilda would be arriving at the bunker in three days, and Taylor, Severin, and Alex would join them the day after. Sam and Eileen had been talking about bringing more hunters, but they knew they had to start small to make things right. They had, however, got the word out to other hunters, about what they wanted to do, and several others were interested in joining them in the future.
Dean had gone to bed first, but he lay awake until Cas came out of the bathroom, the soft light from the window lighting up his beautiful smile. Dean turned to his side, watching as Cas settled in beside him. Turning towards him, he was so close that Dean could feel his breath on his bare chest.
It shone stronger now, glowing more brightly, that light that had always been there. Never dark, only ever shining stronger and stronger.
«Hey Dean?!» Sam calls after him as he catches up with him in the hall, as Dean is about to enter his bedroom, «I… I need to talk to you about something.»
The three single beds are lined up against the wall, the light from the bathroom lights up the room so that Dean can see his brother sleeping peacefully in the bed in the middle. Two empty single beds on each side. His eyes move to the bathroom and a wicked smile spreads across his face.
Sometimes, some days, he tried to get past his armor that he hid his feelings behind, and it did feel good to show his feelings in small gestures. But not at home. He still felt weird about showing his feelings in front of his people. He didn’t like being vulnerable. And he was very, very protective over Cas. That might be why he found it easier to show his emotions in front of strangers.
«All mine! You hear me?» He says with a pointed stare, but he’s still smiling at the dog. Miracle moves closer and settles as close to Cas´s side as he can get. Cas smiles and pulls the dog into a comfortable embrace. His fluffy head on top of Dean's chest. Turning to look at Cas, his green eyes sparkles. Happy. Happiness. Dean lowers his head so that their lips are close again.
Gasping for air, Dean takes a few moments before he has the strength to stand on his two feet again. Raising himself from the floor, his eyes search out the source of the light.
«Well… I guess I'll just have to let you sleep here them.» Cas smiles against Dean's smile as he pulls him into his room, closing the door behind them.
Clearly slow this early in the morning, distracted by his own thoughts, Sam takes a moment to understand what his brother means. But his raised eyebrow and a wicked smile say enough. As he catches up, really not interested in his brother’s
“The way they look at each other.” Aiko pointed at Sam, stealing his attention. “It’s fucking crazy that they aren’t together when they look at each other so intensely.”
«I…» he doesn’t even know what he’s trying to say, Sam´s word running crazy in his head. “I just... You know I’ve never been good at talking about stuff, I’m sorry.”
“Dean, don’t. You don’t have anything to apologize for. I chose it, saving you. And I would have done it again if it meant you’d live. And I know you would’ve found a way to get to me.”
Cas blushes deeper at Dean's words and the look he gives him, makes Dean's stomach flip a thousand times. The stupid butterflies in his stomach attack him everywhere every time Cas gives him that loving look. He hates those stupid butterflies. But he wouldn’t have it any other way.
Again, I apologize for any typos/grammar mistake, English is not my first language, and I haven't really had the energy to proofread the last chapters.
“It was pretty pleasurable. Wouldn’t mind repeating it.” Cas mumbles to Dean as he chews with his mouth full.
Dean never joined them on any hunts though. He didn’t have the need for it anymore. He had, however, applied to a mechanic job in town. He was to start working at the garage next week. After the first week, two hunters joined them and then two more the week after that. Zane and Henrietta, moved into the bunker, while the others, Aiko and Mariana, lived between the bunker and the town, only a ten-minute drive in each direction. Through the spreading network, Sam and Eileen have been in contact with a whole bunch of hunters. Sometimes hunters would come to visit, some staying only a short time, others longer. The two of them had managed to do so much in just a small amount of time. Dean is so proud of his brother for what he’s done, and what he will do.
A single tear escapes from Cas’s eye, finding its way down his face. Their bedroom still echoing their last words before they went to sleep. Their sweet and gentle “I love you” still lingering on their lips. Cas knows why his last remaining grace woke him at this moment. He’s felt it coming for a few days, and Dean, always able to read Cas, knew too. Now he moves the hand he had been resting on Dean's abdomen, towards his chest. Gently laying it above his heart, Cas can feel the necklace with a small glass ball that always rests against Dean’s chest.
. His promise to protect, and take care of me, has been his whole life. But then… then Cas came around.»
«Hey Dean?!”» Sam calls after him as he catches up with him in the hall, as Dean is about to enter his bedroom, «I… I need to talk to you about something.»
Dean Winchester drew his last breath with a smile still spread across his face, their good night kiss still lingering on his lips. No pain. No fear. Nothing left undone. Nothing left unsaid. Dean Winchester’s heart beats one last time, for his angel, at 5:59 am.
«I need to make up for all the times I didn’t say them. I’ve been such a coward all these years. Wanting to scream out the three hardest words I’ve ever known, every time I’ve looked at you. I was such a coward, keeping them to myself. I’m never doing that again.» Dean can see Cas´s eyes turn glassy as they softly smile at each other.
«Cuuute and in looooove.» Dragging out the words again, he walks towards the door, only turning back to Dean when he reaches the hallway. «I’m happy for you, Dean.»
«No. Shut up.» Stepping around him, Dean went to change into his pajamas. «Come on, angel. It's late, and you look like your food coma will have you fall asleep standing.»
“Castiel. I think maybe you should talk to him, ask him. Maybe you two can fina...” When Dean walks in, Sam goes silent as he studies them.
Since Cas came home, they had spent as much time as possible together. Just being with each other. Figuring out the two of them. Yes, the simple way to put it was that Cas loved Dean, and Dean loved Cas. But, to Cas, it felt so much bigger than that. No one knew Cas better than Dean, and they had been family for so many years. But his was something else. Something Cas had hidden for so long. Something Dean had hidden for so long. And now that they didn’t have to hide anything ever again, they were learning and getting to know each other in another way than before.
«You know I love seeing you in my clothes.» Dean smiles and closes the distance between them. His smile widens as he teasingly stops short of kissing the angel. He can’t stand it for long though, and finally kisses him after having longed for it all day. One of his favorite times of his day was always the moments after he had just gotten back from work, and sees Cas again. Getting to kiss him again after having missed his warmth and love all day. «Merry Christmas, my love.»
And when he came back, without him, not having been able to save Cas, all Dean wanted to do was give up. He no longer had something to live for. He had a reason in Sam to stay alive, but it was Cas who had given him a reason to live. When Cas finally returned to Dean, he knew the answer. He knew he loved Cas in a way that scared him more than anything because he knew he would always be alone in feeling that way. Except, the angel had felt the same way.
He knows Cas want this as much as he does. He knows he would never leave him, knows he’ll be waiting for him at the end of the aisle. Yet… Dean´s hands are shaking, his breath becoming heavier for each moment that passes.
“Come on, angel. Let’s go. You look like you need some rest. There’s a motel five minutes from here.”
“I wish!” He had to laugh again. He did suspect something had happened between the two of them these past weeks after they woke from their sleep, but they hadn’t said or showed anything. But, if they didn’t open their eyes soon, and see the other, Sam might go crazy, if they didn’t explode first, from the tension between them. Amused, he sat back in his chair, watching the others. “Now, tell me. What made you all think they were married?”
A hesitant breath parted Dean’s lips as he raised his hand, forcing himself to take the flag from Cas’s grip, his gaze staying locked on the other. “Yah,” Dean said, a smile spreading across his face, matching Cas’s.
When Cas returned he held Jack at his hip. The child dressed in a simple button up and jeans, looking tired as he buried his face into Cas’s shoulder. “Is it just the three of you for dinner?” Dean asked, watching as Cas got out a plate, then managed to awkwardly hold Jack and cut a slice of pie.
Dean glanced to the other one last time before turning his head forward to the setting sun ahead of him, the cool temperature taking over, though still nothing like New York. That’s one thing Dean had really missed about LA, being able to leave without a full winter suit. The breeze that would come a comforting cool, allowing for warm mugs, and scarfs, some days still warm enough to swim in the ocean.
For Jack, that’s what Dean told himself, he was only doing it for Jack. Maybe if he and Cas were still together he’d be doing it for him, but they weren’t. They didn’t buy each other coffee anymore, and they didn’t tease each other about their cars -even though the impala was obviously better than Cas’s pimp car- and they certainly didn't show up to each other's houses while the other wasn’t even there to hang up Christmas lights.
Anyways I do really hope y’all had a fantastic start to your December and are taking care of yourselves!
Sam paused for a second, his eyes darting across Dean's face. “Is he worse than the junkie I live with?”
Lee didn’t reply, instead the sound of typing coming from Dean’s right. “Club Cumming,” Dean didn’t reply, “it’s DJ night.”
Once again Cas didn’t reply, only giving the smallest nod in response, and leaving Dean with no way to respond.
“Sounds like bullshit,” Dean grumbled. He took a step forward and for the first time since they arrived stood slightly in front of Sam. “Anything else I need?”
Dean quickly looked back to Lee, heart somewhere between racing, and having completely stopped. “I have to-” Dean took a breath, still able to see Cas’s stare burning in his mind. “I’ve got to go, my dad’s waiting for me.”
Dean was sat with one ankle rested on his other knee, his arms crossed at his chest, over the red jacket he wore. It was a nice coat, made from a velvet material, with gold buttons the same shade as the gold that lined his black pants, and would have still been a nice jacket if Dean hadn’t been so fidgety. Constantly tugging at the hem, at the collar, at anything he could get his fingers on. They’d known each other for little over three days and Cas wasn’t sure he’d seen Dean sit still once.
Dean took a sip from the water, his gaze staying forward and not on his brother who leant against the counter next to him. The sky outside had become a dark black, only lit by the deck's light. “Just sittin outside the door,” Dean said, “he didn’t want to go back in.”
Dean shifted the child off his lap, placing Jack so he sat alone on the chair while Dean crouched in front. “Hey look,” Dean stuck his tongue out at the child, though it did nothing, as Jack continued to sob. “Come on Jack,” he attempted to make another face once again with no luck, “work with me here.”
The conversation stopped as Dean only stared at the plant, his hands still stuffed in his pockets, a numb feeling growing across them. "Dean?"
When Dean woke up the next morning his head was spinning, and before his eyes had even fluttered open he knew he needed another dose. The craving too strong to ignore, tugging at his gut, clouding any other thought. A groan passed his lips as his eyes fluttered open and he pushed himself into a sitting position. Below the couch both Ellie and John sat watching the tv on a low volume.
Cas slowly stood, his gaze finally going from his phone to Dean, eyes staring with such intensity, Dean couldn’t help the unease in his stomach. “My sister,” Cas replied, there was no hesitation, no pause for even a second. The lie coming with ease. “I should probably take this.”
“If I’m not back by the time we set, he will barge in here, wake every single being resting here. And turn them against you. You will never sleep again. You’ll spend the rest of eternity having to deal with all the angry creatures you’ve got trapped in here.” It’s a long shot, and Dean hopes the Shadow can’t tell that he’s lying. Eventually, Jack would probably come looking for them, when Sam went crazy for waiting for him to return. But how much time passed in the human world, Dean didn’t know. So how long they’d stay here, Dean didn’t know...
Sam smiles through the tears, his hand gripping Jacks tight. They sit there in silence as the birds in the trees welcome a new day with cheerful tones. A light breeze sweeping through the neighborhood. After a while, an old and gray-haired woman steps out on the porch. Eileen moves close to her husband, resting a loving hand on his shoulder, giving Jack a questioning look when she discovers that her husband's face is wet from tears. Sam lays a hand on top of hers, and Jack smiles a sad smile at her as they nod slowly.
With wide, glassy eyes Cas takes a step closer to Dean, closing a distance that isn’t even there. With hands holding Dean tight, Dean can see Cas´s face crumbling with emotion before they both get lost in another kiss.
They have all the time in the world to make a life together, and Cas could not think of anything that he wanted more than that. At the thought of them together and the joy it brought him, something seemed to spark inside him, sending electric waves through his body. He’d felt it before. That little spark. The small portion of grace that remained inside this,
They had been on the road for two days now and had already visited four hunters on the way. They all took the invitation to move to the bunker with such joy that Sam knew he was doing the right thing, gathering and establishing a new hunter community. Their joy would be worth all the hard work he knew it would be.
“No, you go. I’ll stay here. Eileen is coming over tomorrow.” Watching Dean and Sam speak, Cas thinks he can see a look of relief on Dean's face as Sam says no to his invitation.
«I… It's just... I…» Dean, not able to formulate words places his elbows on top of the open books on the table, hiding his face in his hands.
At the sound of the other man’s voice, they both collapse in relief. Exhaustion hitting both of them hard. But neither of them can stop smiling.
For a second, Dean sat there, frozen, too shocked to do anything. This didn’t make sense. How could Cas have gotten out? How was he here?
«I'll take them all, as long as you’re the one painting them on my face.» He knows he’s the one wearing that stupidly cute smile again. A smile that turns even more stupid and wide as Cas leans forward to place a light kiss on his nose. Kisses him lightly as he holds him close. Dean closes his eyes against the kisses as the angel's lips move across his face.
Even the thought of putting words to his feelings scares him, but as Cas lays down beside him, he wishes he wasn’t such a coward.
Dean places the glass ball close to the wound and watches as the angels grace leaves Cas, absorbed into the small ball of glass, which starts to faintly glow a bright light. As Dean looks up he can see that the Shadow has transformed into its true form. A black shadow. Red eyes glowing in anger.
Not able to wait for another second, Dean steps closer to Cas, cupping his face and kissing him as lovingly as ever before. Cas´s hands find their way to Dean´s hips as he leans into the kiss.
And he wants to talk to Dean. Clear the air. Tell him that even though he said those things before he was taken, he doesn’t expect anything from Dean. He only wants his family back.
«Do you mind?» Dean looks annoyed at his brother and Charlie as he points between himself and the door, his clothes not within reach from where he sits on the bed. They both narrow their eyes before turning and leaving the room. «Crazy people.»
«I can’t sleep without you.» Cas gives him a look telling him he doesn’t believe him, since they both know Dean has the ability to fall asleep anywhere and anytime, without problems. Chuckling quietly he brushes their lips together again. «Fine. I don’t want to sleep without you. You know I don’t believe in that bullshit.»
Falling asleep in Cas´s arms for the first time, Dean decides that he never wants to fall asleep alone again.
Raising his eyes from where they were just studying his hands, his mouth falls slightly open as he meets two blue eyes. Glassy from the tears that are forming.
One showed Sam and Eileen, faces turned away, Sam leaning against her car, staring out at a beautiful valley from the hill, the sunset colored the valley with a golden glow. The view, and the feeling of Sam holding Eileen, her back against his chest, embossed the memory with joy and love.
«Way too short! It's such a beautiful day today, but I didn’t wanna wear out my Baby on her first ride in weeks, although I know she would handle it perfectly.»
«Morning, freckles.» The new nickname makes him chuckle as Cas gently strokes a thumb underneath his eye, touching those beautiful marks painted across his face. He found them to be one of the most beautiful things ever created. Exploring his body, Cas had found them on the back of his shoulders too, and some on his collarbone. But the ones on his cheeks, those were his favorite. “Did you sleep well?”
“Don’t ever leave me again, you dumb son of a bitch.” The words would have sounded rough coming from anyone else. But Cas can hear the softness of his voice. If Cas didn’t know better, he’d say it almost sounded like it was filled with love.
«Jerk.» He continues down the hall, and as Dean is about to follow he hears Sam saying hello to someone else.
«Really, Dean. After everything we’ve seen, you’re willing to risk it? Come on. Get out. You can’t see him before the wedding.»
They had been on the road for about a week now and only had two more nights until they were back at the bunker. Dean was in no hurry to get back, and he had to admit he wouldn’t mind a couple of more nights in some shitty motels. The bunker might be the place they called home, but for Dean, it wasn’t about the place. It was about who he was with. His brother had always been home, and over the years Cas had become home too. Dean had never felt more at home as he did in the arms of his angel.
Dean would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little glad there were only one empty bed and no sofa, in the room where Sam was already snoring loudly on the other bed. Dean, and Cas, fell asleep with a smile playing on their lips. The smile still lingering as Dean woke the morning after.
He’s never loved someone this intensely, and he will never love another soul like the way he loves his angel, his love reserved only for him. The angel.
There were several other pictures too, of Dean and Cas. Dean and Sam. Of Sam and Eileen. Sam and Cas. Cas and Jack. Dean and Jack. Cas, Dean, and Claire. Sam, Dean, and Bobby. Jack hadn’t counted how many decorated the long sideboard, or hung on the wall above it, but there were lots of happy memories from their life, showing that even though they had been hard, their lives had held love and happiness too.
