of flames, before she vanished from the boys' sight.
Dean crouched down next to the couch and called Cas's name, “Cas? Castiel? C'mon buddy time to wake up. I have coffee brewing.”
-gotta be honest with you son we’re all a bit homo inside aren’t we boys?
The floor was completely reddened. He had never seen this much red at on place in his life before. The only thing he could feel was his trembling limbs. The baby was still crying.”
He nods in agreement, closing his eyes. He could see Cas, and how his face brightened up each time he smiled. He was standing there looking at him proudly, ah he always did. His eyes were filled with love which warmed each fiber of Dean’s being. Jody was right, he had to prove Cas he’s the person he thinks he is, and he was willing to give everything for that.
That three words went down his spin like a thunderstorm. Of course he did. He died thinking he didn’t matter to anyone, that he doesn’t belong to anywhere, that he’s not worthy of being loved. Of course he did suffer, and whose fault is that?
Sirens could be heard louder each second, people were whispering, a baby’s crying could be heard, and everywhere was red.  Lifeless bodies were reclining on the ground, the last thing he could remember was two oceans draining in front of his eyes, and he was too worn out to save them. He was kneeling on the ground, eyes shut, his mind covered in a blank hole. He could hear somebody calling his name in distance. He could hear screams. He could feel his soul leaving his body.
He packed up for two nights knowing if he tells Jody he wants to stay over for some nights she would be more than happy.
“You just need to give them space and time and they’ll make it the Winchester way.”
“Thank you. For everything.”
Claire didn’t pay any attention to him, which was clearly what Dean expected. He was sitting beside Kaia, eyes locked on the tv screen. Kaia said a firm hi with a small smile on her lips which made Dean smile too. After the meet and greet Jody showed him the room he was going to stay and after he told her that he’s planning to stay for a couple of nights, she kissed his chick and assured him he’s welcomed to stay as long as he wants to.
He bites his lower lip, gathering all the courage he had left inside.
-so what you’re here to tell me when I’m biting the dust?
Dean leans on Cas, melting in the kiss. He couldn’t get a grip of his tears. Cas’ arms were around him, and Dean’s head was buried in his neck.
-any words from your man yet?
He narrows to his brother who was sitting next to him with his brows, taking a deep breath.
-it’s gonna be ok Sammy
“Why are you up so late? Figured you’re sleep by now.”
Jody hugged him tighter as Dean’s face was being covered by the endless tears that were falling from his eyes. And Dean felt too broken to have the courage to get himself together. So he just decided to let it go. Enough of the Winchester ego.
“They’re.. they’re fine I guess. You know how crazy things have been recently.”
Dean freezes for a short moment. Trying to gather his head up. He holds up shaking, eyes narrowly meeting the judge’s.
-and where is Jack?
-you do know you can’t lie to me don’t you?
Dean shakes his head in disagreement, letting out a sharp breath. Suddenly he could feel the coldness of the silver metal on his left finger with all his cells, like a warning, something that reminded him of reality.
“Thanks Cas.” He smiled. One of those genuine and sincere smiles that barley happened to him, and they mostly had one reason, Cas. The angel never failed to make him feel like he’s important, that he mattered, that he is loved. Even though he knew angels couldn’t feel these things and despite Cas wasn’t just a normal angel, deep down he chose to believe maybe Cas wants him too.
“this is not you Dean..thi..s..is..not..you”
His cellmates had planned a small goodbye party for him there. Despite there was no food or alcohol it turned out to be super fun. Dean sat there most of the time, watching others as they trash talked each other and laughed at their stupid dad jokes. At the end, everybody, even the ones Dean had never talked to, gave him a swift snug hug. Benny was the last one, and he managed to hold him a bit longer than anyone else did.
Unlike everybody’s predictions, fall had started with a heavy rain. Despite it was early morning, the gloomy weather could be felt everywhere and the sound of pouring rain broke every silence.
“Sleep well Dean.”
“G’night Cas”
Dean smiled. Because with his angel watching over him, he knew he would.
“Don’t answer that”. She snapped before Dean could say anything, and deeply he was glad because he really didn’t have a word to say in response. And the other reason was she already knew the answer. From the little time they had spent together Claire must’ve known what an asshole he is.
-why are your eyes red Dean?
Sam was early this time. Dean sits in front of him, with a cigarette lightened up between his lips, waiting for his brother to talk.
Cas wheels his head to him, looking straight into his eyes. Dean lets his arm go, bits his lower lip, and exhales sharply.
When the meeting time came along, Dean was roaming around the room aimlessly. For once he was stressed and he had no idea why. Dean wanted to let his guard down this time, he wanted to spill out but every instinct of his being was stopping him.
Dean’s heart dropped. He should’ve known something is happening. Cas was an utter idiot and Dean was afraid he would get himself killed for the kid because he knew Cas would do it in a blink if he had to. He would go through every way and wouldn’t pay attention to its cost. After all, Dean was the one who he had learned it from.
“Did he suffer?”
Crows were still croaking, clouds were
Cas jumps of the sound, turning his face to Dean. Dean rushes to him furiously, looking directly as Cas’ blues. They were angry, and full of vain.
He laughs at his own thoughts. After they were dismissed, everybody sat down at their places. Dean’s eyes were circulating aimlessly. His heart never pounded this fast. Judge was talking to his counselors. And once, they were done.
-your honor.. he chuckles, dropping his head down for a short moment… I’ve always known deep down in my heart that I’m the one who’s gonna mess everything up. But I didn’t do anything you honor. He said it himself. It wasn’t me. If he was here he would tell you.
They sat there in peace, only the sound of their breaths could be heard. Dean was smoking and Sam’s head was dropped down. In a trice Sam reaches to Dean and grabs him in his arms. Dean tossed the cigarette away and puts his arms around his brother. He could feel Sam shivering, and he also could hear his sobs.
Dean closed his eyes, remembering the days they were looking for her. Cas was actually, and how desperate he was to make up everything to her. He felt guilty for letting her go on herself, especially after he figured out her mother abandoned her too. And he could be a good father still, if he was ... alive.
“You’re my closest friend Dean, I would do anything for you.”
He says with a quaky voice. Jack’s lashes had made a shadow on his cheeks, which made him more adorable.
- you don’t know a dicky bird about me
The sudden change of the discussion was followed by a heartache for Dean. Cas was trying to keep them away from the whole thing and he was aching to know why. But it seemed like he wouldn’t spill, so he had to wait for the right time.
Dean lounges on his bed, eyes stuck to the ceiling as usual. His thumb stroking on his ring. His lips separates to a boarder smile. He closes his eyes, sucking in the air around him and letting it out with a loud voice.
“Yeah sure.”
“Now, when I Call your name each of you will come up here and have a seat where you will be sorted into your houses. First; Rowan Khanna.”
The students were led up stairs to a pair of large double doors and a woman with brown hair dressed in green robes awaited them. “I'm Professor McGonagall. Soon you will walk through those doors and await to be seated with your houses. From here on, your houses will be like your family. Success and hard work will earn you house points, while rule-breaking will lose you house points. At the end of the year the house with the most points will be awarded the House Cup. Now I need you all to wait here until I call you.”
“Hey, kiddo.” Mary looked up smiling softly through her tears. She opened her arms and Dean moved closer, accepting the hug. She pulled back after a few moments looking at Dean with tired eyes.
he mused. He headed into the kitchenette and straight for the coffee pot. Before any other decisions were to be made, he first needed caffeine. Once the pot was done percolating, Dean headed to the bar that divided his kitchenette from the living room. Pulling out a notebook and pen, Dean began to make a list of all the ingredients he would need for his seafood stew.
Kira nodded and left the common room with Rowan on her heels, Ruby still perched on her shoulders. The little dragon looked around curiously. She hadn't been allowed to leave the dDorms, since it was against the rules. But now that classes were over, Ruby stuck close to her witch.
"Sorry, give me a moment. This is a lot to take in..." the hunter mumbled.
--Dean--
"I'll be right there," he called out. Making sure to carefully place the last amethyst in line with the others and not to accidentally take it with him, he climbed down the step ladder and headed for the front counter. Ever since he’d turned eighteen he’d been running Mystic Dragon Books and Gifts, it was his way to pay back his mentor, Rowena, for saving him. The moment he turned sixteen and his magic manifested, he had thought his life was over.
“Naomi, what a pleasant surprise. And it's Winchester now, by the way.” Mary greeted,
Sam looked up at Dean with confused hazel eyes, “Why are mom and dad fighting?”
Cas nodded, “Yes Dean. I'm fine.”
Both girls nodded at him and smiled. Dean waved good-bye and headed inside the building.
He was determined to be the exception to John’s rule about the supernatural; Dean’s gifts would help people. He looked over his shoulder toward the book section and called out to his best friend/little sister, Charlie.
“Don't know, Sammy,” he answered, “but I'm sure it's nothing too bad.” He's trying to reassure Sam, but even he knew his answer was a lie. This wasn't going to end well.
Aquila moved closer voice lowering as he tried to coax Dean into joining him, “C'mon, what's the harm? It's just you and me and that spectacular sunset,” his voice was smooth, purring the words out as he stepped even closer to Dean.
Mary nodded, “Yes. This is Dean and Sam. Dean starts his first year at Hogwarts this September, we're here gathering his supplies.”
Dean frowned, “Where's dad? Is he coming back?”
Dean looked up at his brother, “Yeah? What is it?”
Dean listened to his friend speak and answered the question. “I'm making seafood stew. Maybe you could join me and Charlie for dinner at her place and watch a movie?”
Kira, Dean, and the rest of their classmates returned to their workstations, Kira sitting near Merula and Rowan, while Dean and Charlie were with another Slytherin student. Kira measured out her ingredients carefully, following every instruction that Snape had given her. When the Professor approached the table he remarked, "Hmm, perhaps you aren't incompetent after all, Nightingale."
Dean grinned, “Thanks. I guess I'll see you two on the train in September?”
A/N: Part 2 of Drowning in Guilt, my ProfoundBot prompt.
John snatched the letter out of Dean's hands with a scowl, “What nonsense is this?!”
Sam hurried back down the pier in the opposite way he came and made his way towards the beach. He stood there, his heart in his throat, as he waited for his friend to bring his brother back to him safely. After what felt like hours, but was only mere minutes, he saw Castiel swimming towards him with Dean in his arms. He immediately moved closer to the water's edge to help the Angel bring his brother's unresponsive form ashore.
Dean nodded absentmindedly, “Sure.” He felt dazed as they resumed walking, something was nagging at the back of his mind, but Dean couldn't figure it out. There was something he was supposed to be doing or someone he was forgetting, he was sure of it.
Dean turned on his heels and headed for the garage, Sam following behind him. “We'll be there soon. Don't leave!”
Kira seethed, but made no comment as Snape made his way over to see what the ruckus was about.He glared down at the mess on the table, "You should have never been allowed inside my classroom, Nightingale. You are somehow even worse than your brother. Ten points from Gryffindor. What do you have to say for yourself?"
Sam nodded, having heard of the meeting from both Bobby and Dean. “He's ok, right? How is he back?”
Dean nodded, “Single, yes. But not looking for a relationship. I had a bad break-up a year ago and I'm still trying to get over it. It's hard to get past someone you love not accepting all of you.” Dean sighed, “It hurts, but it was his choice.”
“Just a fake letter from Professor Snape she said she wrote, but I can't prove it...”
Sam agreed, “Good idea. We should be able to reach Galveston tomorrow.” Checking the clock and deciding to call it a night the brothers headed to bed.
Sam exhaled in a rush, “Dean! I thought we lost you!” He promptly hugged his brother, relieved that the Kelpie hadn't killed him.
Charlie grinned back, "Only every day since we met."
"Galveston, Texas. It about an 800-mile drive. The halfway point would be Oklahoma City. That's for five hours."
She turned to see a familiar head of red hair belonging to no other than Charlie Weasley. He waved her over and she, Dean and Rowan made their way over to him.
Dean opened the door to his shop and flipped the 'closed' sign over to 'open'. Once that was done, he made his way to the back room and into his workshop where he started gathering the necessary ingredients for the hex bag his mother had requested. He heard Charlie call a greeting from out front, but he didn't pause in his work, he kept his concentration on the spell he was weaving. Once the knots were tied, Dean took the hex bags with him to the main part of the shop and called his mother. “Mom? I have those hex bags you requested,” Dean paused, “They’re for who? A pair of hunters? Are you out of your mind?! Hunters?!”
. It was the perfect mix of classical and modern styles.
Dean took in the details of said blade and immediately headed into the back room to get the fire up to temperature and the metal melted down. Working carefully Dean smelted the chosen metal to soften it and then used his chosen hammer to shape it. Dipping in in water cools the metal as it slowly starts to take form. He works like this for hours, working and shaping the soft metal until a blade takes form. One last dip in water and that part is done, the hilt and sheath are next.
“Can't believe it's all over. Our lives are our own now,” Sam muttered quietly in awe. After so long things were finally settling down.
Dean smiled gratefully, “That'd be awesome.” The newly formed trio made their way through the bookstore gathering up books and chatting about hobbies and the start of the school year. Once the books were paid for Dean and Kira parted ways with Charlie and went outside. Dean followed Kira as she made her way over to a dark-haired girl with glasses.
With a nod, Kira headed towards the bookstore. Ruby chirped from her usual spot and her shoulder, “Yea, she was nice wasn't she? Hope to meet more people like her. It'll be a change from what we're used to.”
Sam watched, fear in his heart, as Dean was pushed over the railing into the dark sea. He saw Castiel run towards where the creature and his brother disappeared, shouting for Sam to meet him at the shoreline.
“You didn't let me down, Nightingale. My expectations for you were already low.”
Crafting Blades
Dean looked from his brother to the wrapped box and then carefully pulled off the wrapping paper before opening the box. His grinned widened, at the sight of the pie. “Apple Pie!”
There had never been a perfect time; everything had always kept getting in the way. Between the hunts, the Apocalypse, and the Angels, Dean just wasn't comfortable saying anything. He'd been looking for the perfect opening for a long time now and he was tired of fear standing in the way. He was tired of all of those thoughts bombarding him day and night.
"Shit! I can't find a pulse!" He then remembered those CPR lessons and started instructing Cas. "I need to start chest compressions. Then we also need to get air into his lungs. There might be water blocking his airway." Seeing the Angel nod, Sam instantly started doing the chest compressions, stopping to allow Cas to try to get Dean to breathe.
Dean green eyes locked with brown and he took a second to think, "...I guess so?" He was unsure, the dark water didn't look very safe, but then it wasn't like he was alone.
Metal crafting was a delicate process that required steady hands, something Dean wasn't always successful with; as one could tell by the scars on his hands.
--Dean
Sam shook his head as he digested the story, “Wow. So let me get this straight, you left without a word because you were scared of Dad’s reaction to finding out you are a witch?”
Mary nodded, “Yep. Professor Flitwick said I was his best student. Really had a talent for charms.” She continued the explanation about magic, the school and the other professors throughout dinner and after. When it was time for bed, she told her boys, “Get some sleep, cause tomorrow we're taking a trip to London to go to Diagon Alley. We'll be using magic to get there.”
Dean shrugged, “Still true.”
Sam looked over at his mom and asked, “Who was that?”
Rowan smiled, “Pleased to meet you.”
Dean grinned at her and opened the bag with the gifts inside. Inside were a pair of mirrors, a quill, a leather bound journal, and an ink pot. Dean pulled out each of the items looking at them curiously. “What's this?”
Dean's breath escaped him in a rush. This was it! Finally, he had his answer, “I love you too, Cas. I don't know when my feelings changed, but this case made me aware that they have. And yea, I want you here with me until the day I stop breathing. Hell maybe even past that.”
Sam looked thoughtful, “Maybe. Though none of the lore I read mentioned it.”
After finishing his slice of pizza, Dean stood up. "Right then, let's get packing.” They headed their separate ways to their rooms to pack for the case and then met up in the garage to load up the Impala. Soon enough they were on the road heading south to the Texas coast.
Sam nodded, "Yeah, I'm going to head over to the local library and see if any of the local legends match up to what we're searching for. Why don't you go with Dean and check out Seawall's establishments? Maybe someone knows more?"
Mary took a small handful of Floo Powder from the bag on the mantle, stepped into the fireplace and tossed it onto the ground beneath her feet saying, “Diagon Alley.” There was a
“I'm here waiting for you.”
is over this way if I remember correctly.”
Rowena hummed, "Mmhm, a local lad. Pretty good with the clay, I hear."
She nodded sadly, “Yeah, they really are amazing creatures.” The new friends made small talk as the train continued towards its destination. Once they arrived the exited the train and then boarded onto boats that took them across the water to where the towering castle like school awaited them.
, the
Smiling at the enthusiasm coming through the phone, he replied, “Great, how about I meet you in the square in about fifteen minutes?”
After the breakfast dishes were cleaned up and everyone was ready to leave, Mary ushered her boys to stand in front of the fireplace in the living room, where she instructed them on how to use the Floo Powder.
Cas slipped into the passenger seat and Dean got behind the wheel.
He disappeared that night.
John turned to Mary, “Find out
Dean looked confused, “Vault?”
Cas shook his head, “No, thanks. My brother is meeting me for breakfast at Spitfire Coffee. I should leave now before I'm late.” Cas smiled at Dean, rinsed out his cup, and started to fold up the blankets on the couch.
The pair headed off again, this time for birthday presents instead of school supplies. Another half an hour later found them leaving the store with four neatly wrapped gifts, before Mary had a spark of inspiration.
“What?”
Prompts: Eye Contact & Crystal
“Now I do believe there are other places you need to be.”
Dean could feel the heat rushing to his cheeks, before he cleared his throat, “Just visiting. How about you? You live here?”
Kira nodded, “yea, this is the most freedom I've had for five years.” She reaches up to scratch Ruby's scales gently. “Ruby has been my rock and support and now I can't wait to see what we can accomplish together.”
scaring it?!"
Kira nodded, “I remember.” She took a seat by one of the windows, Charlie and Rowan sitting with her and Dean sitting near Bill. “Okay, this is what I know.” She took a breath and then tried to explain, “from what my grandma wrote me, my family once ran a Dragon Sanctuary in the U.S. These were specially raised for wizards and witches as companions and teachers. They were supposed to help the Ministry of Magic understand more about dragons and how they affect our world and that they, like all magical creatures, need to be protected. But something happened, and my parents died. Most of the eggs were lost, but my grandmother managed to save a dozen or so.”
“Hi Charlie,” she greeted, “You remember Dean? And this is Rowan.”
Bot Prompt: Dean is having another slice of pizza; Cas is polishing his angel blade; Sam is at the library
Sam's eyes sparkled with excitement, “Cool.”
The friends gathered together after class. " Potions is next and I have a feeling facing Professor Snape won't be as easy," Rowan said.
Rowan nodded, “Alright. Hit me with it.”
Mary took a moment to remember her years at Hogwarts, before she answered, “Her name is Naomi and she was in Slytherin. I was in Ravenclaw. We spoke in between classes and figured out we had a few things in common. I guess you could say we became friends.” She then turned towards Dean and said, “Now we were getting your books, right?”
The year was shaping up to be better than she thought already, new start and new friends. With no past to hold her back, Kira felt confident this was exactly what she needed to really be who she was meant to be.
The man laughed, “Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts.”
Finally, after what seemed like ages, they had a free moment. He talked Sam into helping him and Jack to run interference. Now he finally had everything ready—all he needed was Cas.
Kira laughed with the rest of their group as she watched as Charlie Weasley also made his way to their table. “we're in the same house together, what are the odds?”
Cas frowned, about to answer, when Sam interrupted, “Why don't we finish this conversation at the motel? That way we can get Dean some dry clothes?”
Kira grinned at his shock, “Yes she is. Her name's Ruby and she's my companion.”
Kira decided to suck it up since she had no proof of sabotage. “I'm sorry Professor Snape, I didn't mean to let you down.”
Kira smiled in triumph until her cauldron started to bubble wildly. “Wha-what's happening?”
They were about to start walking, when Dean heard a voice call out his moms name, “Mary? Mary Campbell, is that you?”
His head broke the surface and he managed to pull in a lungful of air before he was grabbed and pulled back under. He fought back, trying to get loose only for his air to be knocked out of him again by a forceful hit to his stomach. Blackness descended then, and before his eyes closed he saw a flash of a familiar blade,
Dean nodded, “Yes, mom.” Dean then turned to Kira and Rowan and said, “Let's go find a car.”
Dean smiled, “Dean McLeod, my mother is Rowena McLeod. She’s well known throughout the city for her work. Maybe you’ve heard of her.” He once again shook Castiel's hand and this time was prepared for the sparks of magic that shot up his arm. Maybe this could work out after all…
“I'm Kira Nightingale and this is my companion Ruby,” Kira said, introducing herself and the dragon on her shoulder.
But another look into the brown eyes of his companion and the thought slipped away. Dean leaned against the railing, his attention on the sunset and the man at his side. Aquila looked over at him and smirked, “Don't know about you but I could go for a swim. Care to join me?”
Mary shook her head, “He left. I don't know if he will or not. We'll just have to wait and see.” She then straightens up and puts on a smile, “But for now, kiddo, we have to talk about that letter you received.”
His mother nodded, “Yes, the coins are kept in vaults. Many families have vaults at
Dean nodded, “Yep, hanging up in my closet.” Dean leaned closer, unconsciously moving into Rowena’s personal space. “Huh? Says a new up-and-coming sculptor is appearing with his works?” Dean read the flyer over and blinked as a familiar name popped out at him, “
Dean shook his hand and turned to look at Castiel. As green eyes met blue, there was an intense pull behind Dean’s ribcage. He held eye contact with the man a moment longer, before tearing his eyes away. “Just curious then?” he asked, shaken by the encounter. He'd never felt that around a human before, and it wasn't from lack of contact with them. New Orleans runs on myth and magic, most of his regulars were human.
To temper the metal into the forms and shapes necessary took time and skill. But Dean had been making blades for many years now, learned from his mentor Bobby Singer and perfected with his own scarred hands.
Dean watches him walk off before returning to the work area to resume his other projects. Yes, Dean is very good with his hands, there' not many who can temper metal into a sword fit for a king.
--Dean--
Cas tilted his head in confusion, “His eyes?”
Kira agreed and pulled open the door to the classroom. They split up and took the seats available around the classroom. Professor Snape got their attention as he spoke. "This is your first Potions class, and by the bewildered look in your eyes it could very well be your last. Unlike your other classes, there will be no useless wand-waving or intolerable screeching of mispronounced incantations. You are here to learn the subtle art and exact science that is potion-making. I'll teach you to ensnare the senses, to bewitch the mind. Keep your mouths shut and pay attention. Your first lesson will be the Cure for Boils."
Dean bit his lips, looking like a deer caught in the headlights, as the deep voice sank into his skin. Trying to hide his shaking hands, he paused to take a sip of his drink before answering, “I grew up surrounded by fine art. My mentor had a thing for it and I remember every one of her lessons. You have talent and it's going to take you far.” He mentally congratulated himself for being able to form a coherent sentence, despite the nervousness coiling in his belly.
The moment Kira arrived in the common room a ball of red scales tackled her, clinging tightly to her shoulders. She laughed, "Missed you too, Ruby." She spent a few moments reassuring her dragon companion before heading over to where the Prefect, Angelica, stood waiting. She shared a look with Rowan, waved to the boys, and squared her shoulders.
“You know who I am?”
It was then that the train sounded off, and Mary turned to her sons, “Time to board,” she said as she hugged Dean goodbye. “You write when you get the chance, you hear me?”
Cas smiled brilliantly, before leaning in and pressing his lips to Dean's softly. Dean returned the kiss, more than aware that this was definitely the start of something different and new.
Prompts: Suit and Hand-holding
Rowan made her way nervously up to the stool and took a seat. The Sorting Hat was placed upon her head and then a voice yelled out, “Gryffindor!”
--Dean
Dean sighed as he set about closing up his shop for the night. It was the end of another long day, sludging through paperwork, with not even a single customer to ease his pain. He couldn’t wait to get back to his own space and relax. Just as he was about to turn the lock on the door and head upstairs, Rowena appeared.
The taller hunter nodded, “Hey, Cas.”
Dean looked up from the row of crystals that he was organizing as the bell over the door of his little magic shop rang.
“Call them, late birthday presents.”
Summary: Dean's always loved working with his hands, so Bobby decided to teach him metal crafting. Now Dean is one of the best.
“All right, let's see the sight you found this hunt on?” Dean said after throwing his duffel bag at the foot of the bed furthest from the door. Sam sat at the tiny rickety table and open up his laptop to the correct website. As they looked over the files one thing became clear about the victims, they were drowned. As he looked closer at the article, Dean frowned, a thought plaguing him, “Hey, Sammy? What was that place you mentioned they disappeared from?”
Cas tilted his head in confusion, “A Kelpie?”
Rowan tugged on the door handle. “We're locked in. Can you cast Lumos, so we can have a look around?”
Cas chuckled, “I'm not going anywhere.” There was an unspoken promise in his answer that made Dean's heart flutter in his chest.
Cas nodded in greeting, “Sam. Found anything about the creature?”
The angel nodded, "Alright, Dean." Cas put his blade away and left the motel with Dean. A short drive in the Impala once again had them at the waterfront. The sight of the three-story white structure greeted the hunter and Angel as they made their way around the decks. Live music greeted them as they approached one of the bar entrances. Dean looked around with a grin, this was certainly a place he could enjoy. Walking up to the bar he ordered two beers and brought them over to the small bar table he found Cas at.
Dean nodded, skeptical but trusting “Okay, what time should Charlie and I meet you?”
As he moved around the courtyard, Dean paused at the sculpture of the figure of a man that almost looked familiar. Footsteps behind him caused him to turn and do a double-take as Castiel approached. “You again,” Castiel smiled. "You know, the hardest part of making this piece was getting the facial proportions perfect.” Castiel paused to study Dean’s face, eyes captivating. “Much like yours, in fact. Shame there's nothing to do for the freckles, though. A fatal flaw in the art of sculpture. Do you know much about art? To take something so plain like a block of clay and shape and mold it, basically, breathe life into it. That’s a pleasure not many can have.”
Sam agreed, “Sounds like a plan to me.”
His blue eyes sparkled with delight. “You're a first year, right?” Kira nodded, “me too. Maybe you can tell me more and I'll help you find your books.”
“Ohhh...” Rowan thought for a minute, “I heard about him, it was in the Daily Prophet. He's your foster brother?”
Dean nodded, “So I guess that's the first place we check then.”
“I know, right? I've never had friends, so a familiar face or two is gonna be a welcome sight. But you should be warned, you might be asked about my foster brother Jacob.”
“It's Novak, for me. Chuck and I got married not too long after we left Hogwarts.” Naomi paused, as she considered Mary, “Winchester, hmmm? Looks like you got married yourself as well.” Her attention turned to Dean and Sam next, “These must be your boys, then?”
Once those are complete and the hilt attached to the blade, Dean sharpens the newly forged sword and etches the requested runes into the metal, before sheathing the blade.
Summary: It was finally time. He was tired of holding back.
Sam nodded, "Yep. It's a water horse able to take on a human form to lure its targets into the ocean. Hence the drownings."

Resolving Guilt
“We all make mistakes, the point is to fix the ones that you can.” She then held up a note. “In any case, Professor Snape already sent you a letter directly to our common room.”
aspects of yer life. Work and personal especially. If yer magic’s reactin' to him, then he's what ye need to balance out yer life." She explained, "Now, I'm not talkin bout that love at first sight thin'. Real feelings take time te build. Yer magic is pointin you toward a path, ye choose to walk it or not."
Mary scowled, “Because I know how you feel about magic and witches. This right here is the very reason why!”
As he jotted down what he would need to buy, Dean’s thoughts turned to his last face-to-face encounter with Cas. They had exchanged phone numbers at the party and kept in touch via half an hour phone calls and the occasional text about their day, getting to know each other. Cas was sticking to being just friends, even though it was quite clear the artist wanted more. They had grown closer these past few days and Dean felt himself relaxing more around the other man. He decided to call Charlie about the stew idea and see if the three of them could get together later to hang out. Depending on how that went, he might even let Cas see his home. They were friends now, after all. He took a look at the clock hanging above the kitchen sink and noted the time. He learned his lesson early on, a sleep-deprived Cas is grumpy and barely audible. Chuckling, Dean hung up the phone and decided to wait and call back later. Seven AM was still a little too early to make that phone call, he'd have to wait an hour or two.
“Same here,” Naomi agreed, “My youngest son, Castiel is also starting his first year at Hogwarts. He'll be there with his brother, Gabriel who is a third Year Slytherin.” There was a note of pride in her voice as she said the House Name. “Well, we still have more shopping to do.” Naomi turned away but before leaving she said, “We need to meet up, when we both have time to talk more.”
Castiel frowned, “a horse?”
Rowena smiled sadly. She remembered when Dean had first met the Creole cook a few years back. And she also remembered how heartbroken Dean had been when he told her it was over. She rolled over his description in her head and flipped through the pages of her mental spellbook. Suddenly, her smile turned knowing, “Oho, my boy. Yer magic is tellin' ye, ya found yer soulmate.”
Kira nodded, "yes, though I didn't know him very well.”
Cas shook his head, "I don't think he even knows what we're hunting yet..." Cas trailed off before his expression turned into one of alarm, "You said the Kelpie drowned its' victims, right?" At Sam's nod, he continued, "We need head further up the pier."
Dean shook his head, “Not really. It's weird, you think it would be a siren, but all of the witnesses spoke seeing a horse.”
, the wizard bank. We need to exchange our funds for wizard money. Thankfully I still have the key to my parents' vault.”
Dean laughed, “Don’t leave your workshop too often, do ya? I've been here long enough to always have one handy when there's cloud cover. You never know when the weather will change.” He side-eyed Cas for a moment, trying to read him, before saying, “Are you still up for a trip to the bayou? The boat I'm meeting is there.”
“Let me guess, you're a first year too?” A soft female voice spoke, from off to the side.
Kira's back straightened at that. “I know my brother broke school rules and damaged its reputation, but I want to be a credit to our house.”
Dean felt the need to justify himself, guilt swirling in the pit of his stomach., “You know how he feels about anything supernatural! We both know he wouldn’t treat me any different! He’d see me as a monster and shoot me to ‘put me out of my misery.’ It’s better to die than live as a monster.”
A little while later Snape dismissed the class and everyone headed out. Kira and Rowan met up with Dean and Charlie at the entrance to the classroom. "Man, that was rough. She really has it out for you, huh?” Dean commented, watching the Slytherin student stalk by.
Once the duo made it back to Dean’s flat, Dean’s blush from having Cas over darkening his cheeks, he quickly excused himself to go get the extra blankets and pillows from the closet in his room. He kept them there for his movie marathon nights with Charlie.
Dean frowned, “Really? I thought we were looking for a horse?”
Mary smiled in greeting, “I'm pleased to finally meet you. Dean's told me about your and you're dragon. And I must say she is quite the beauty isn't she?” Mary looked over at the dragon as she peered at the compliments.
Dean nodded and grabbed his wallet and keys before following Charlie out of his flat and onto the main streets of New Orleans.
“Good, they were brothers and the older one bought one of our herbal anthologies,” Dean smiled, “Was impressed with our selection.” Dean shook his head, “My magic was acting weird around the other guy though, and I have no idea what's going on?”
Bill nodded in greeting, before he noticed Ruby's form curled around Kira's shoulders. “Bloody hell! Is that a dragon?”
He combed through pages of neat cursive in the little black book near the phone. “Aha! Knew alphabetical was the right call.” His gaze wandered as he waited for her to pick up, lighting on Gabriel and Castiel approaching. “Is this Rebekah? This is Dean at Mystic Dragon. I have that charm you wanted. No hurry, just come pick it up when you can.” Smiling and hanging up, Dean placed the pouch in a drawer for safety and looked up as in time to address the brothers. Gabriel was holding a book of healing herbs in his hand. “So I take it you found something to your liking after all?”
-you know I love you right?
“That’s good to hear, now focus on your sleeping. I want to close your eyes and clear your mind as much as possible. Or think about the things that make you happy but don’t overthink it. I want you to take deep breathes and relax your body since I’m not there to do the part for you. And I won’t be going anywhere so don’t worry about that. And if still you couldn’t sleep call me again, we can spend the night talking.”
His voice was low and he was trying to hide the crack in it. It seemed like a confession. But Dean was too emotional to care. He needed Cas to know how much he means to him, though he was never good with words but he wanted to try at least, for once in his life.
“I did everything I could to keep him, but it was his choice, the stupid son of a bitch didn’t leave me any other options .” The moment he was done Clair stood up in front of him angrily with her hands fisted.
Cas looks at him with the most tormenting gaze Dean had ever seen from him. They spend some time in silence. Dean was praying. He had already lost enough. He wasn’t ready to lose more.
He shouts out loud his second sentence. And when he was breathing heavily out of anger, Jack’s crying sound made both their head turn to the direction. Cas is the one who leaves first, and when he reaches to Jack, hugging him is the first thing he does, robbing his hand in his back, whispering lullaby in his ears. Dean leans on the door, watching them with a grieving smile.
I would never thought fall would be this biting. I wish you were here.”
Dean just stared at her with teary eyes, processing everything he had just heard. Deep down he knew Cas had always loved him, but he didn’t know the angel could actually feel it. But Cas was too human to be an angel. And yet, too angel to be a human. He could never bring himself to think about everything that had happened between them, because each moment of it made him go absolute feral. Because it made his guilt take over his body and if would eat him alive.
He turns his head, turning it to the middle-aged man sitting right next to him.
-and he’s bringing Jack too
He trains Sam to go back to his place with eyes, and Sam does as he told tentatively.
Dean didn’t feel like talking. Although it was his brother sitting in front of him but he was there at his lawyer, which Dean hated it.
Sam remains silent. Dean shakes his right leg stressfully, biting his bottom lip. He had done nothing wrong, he made a promise to Cas, and he’s not going to break it.
Dean was tempted by the crowd to spend more time with them because they said he seemed like a cool guy. The good thing about having people around you is that you get lost in all the chitchats and you forget who you are, which Dean was grateful for it. Not that he ever forgot about those ocean eyes, or the warmth of the embrace, or the soothe tone of the voice, but he wasn’t lost in them, even if it was just for a few minutes.
They take their steps to the kitchen and after grabbing their breakfasts, they sit at their usual spot, eating it in silence and sometimes laughing at the grumpy old men and their morning trash talks.
Dean smiles wildly. Now, the small distress deep down in his heart was gone, he was at ultimate peace.
“Sirens could be heard louder each second, people were whispering, a baby’s crying could be heard, and everywhere was red.”
“Now drink your milk and then lie down. Since I am not there with you we have to omit the last part but I will stay on the line till you fall asleep.”
Despite his eagerness to brush aside everything that was happening around him, as each night passed, his nightmares were becoming more vivid. Now he could utterly remember everything that had happened.  But he wasn’t going to talk about it, or even think about it.
I love you. He almost said and the words were spinning in his head. It was one of those nights that he was wearing his heart on his sleeves. He felt his heart was beating faster, but he couldn’t help it. He remembered the angel told him he loves him, when he almost died. But then the mentioned that he didn’t mean it that way because he turned his head to Sam and Marry and said “I love all of you”, and that was a breaking point, that was where he knew he doesn’t have any chances with the angel that he desperately wanted to call his.
He decided to take a shower first, and when he was done and all dressed up, he went straight to the kitchen to eat something. His hair was still a little damp and some water tears were dropped on his forehead.
“I loved him Jody.” Tears were streaming down his face slowly. Jody tucks him into a hug and leans his head on her chest, running her finger in his hair. “I know Dean, I have always known.”
He drops his head and there was a unanimous silence there for a moment. Then, the man pats Dean’s back with a warming smile.
Jody joined them with three coffee mugs and sat beside Dean. She didn’t say anything and all of them stayed there quietly for several minutes.
-why?
“Claire-“
-is my brother. I am married to C..Castiel Novak and I have a two year old son called Jack.
Dean leave the room without saying another word, or waiting for a respond. He has a smile on his face, his eyes shining like the bright sun. His torture was almost done. He was almost home.
Dean raises his head, looking at the dark clouds, his lips stretch to a smile. They were too cute to be this dismal. His smile fades away. The blue sky wasn’t blue anymore, it seemed lost, and empty. It was too beautiful to look this melancholic. But everything has it’s own demon, even the pure blue of sky.
-how you’re doing?
It’s so cold here Cas. I wish you were here.”
A slight glimpse of light was puncturing through the jammed clouds. The weather was damp, and the streets was empty of people. Crows were croaking, sitting on the weirs.
-where were you at 11pm that night?
“You never believed in happy endings. You have always said happy endings are for the storied that are not finished yet. You were so pessimistic Cas. And honestly? Sometimes it freaked me out. But then when I told you about my fear, you said it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t keep fighting for us. That we should try our best not to fall apart. And that’s the beauty of life. That makes life livable. And no one out there really cares that you’re broken. So we gotta stick together as tight as possible. And I should always remember to not expect anything from anyone, and that’s the first step to happiness. You taught me how to put my heart where it belongs. But Cas, my heart has always been safe with you. And I love you for that. I’ll always love you.”
-how’s Cas?
Since they didn’t have money there, bets were mainly on cigarettes. Dean wasn’t that good in poker. Not that it was baffling. He just didn’t feel the need to know more that he already did about it. But still, he managed to win some rounds.
When she finished tears fell more rapidly from his eyes. All these times he thought he’s going to be judged, or mocked, or not taken seriously, but here he was, being a dumbass all over again.
A man was hanged by himself, cause when they raised had head, he had a smile on it. His face was shining. People thought it’s because he’s in heaven.
- seven years ago
He laughs, tilting his head down a bit, his eyes on Jack. As each day passed the kid looked more like his dad. He had his eye, lips, skin tone, and soon, his attitude. He hopped so.
His heart skipped when he saw the untouched apple pie in there. His lips stretch to a bittersweet smile. He grabs a piece and eats the whole of it with one bite. It tasted like heaven. Not that he knew what actually heaven tastes like but deep down he knew it’s close to it.
“The day I decided that I don’t want you is the day I’m not me cause hell I can’t function without you.”
blond kid that was looking at him with those familiar blue eyes. He couldn’t read her face, or what she was looking for in him, so he stayed silent, waiting for her to make a move.
“Couldn’t sleep. How’s the research for Lucifer junior going on?”
-6 years of marriage but totally almost 11yeras
-I know, it’s ok, we’ll work this out
-good morning
-when was the last time?
He leaves to bathroom without hesitation. Dean spends several minutes there, staring at the place Cas had vanished, sobbing quietly. He whirls back to bed, laying on it without wiping his tears. He bends his knees into his stomach as he watched Jack’s chest went up and down when breathed. It was one of the most pleasant things Dean had ever seen.
Sam stands up. Gets a bit close to Dean. Dean had stopped crying, and we was ready to talk again. He didn’t need anybody’s help. He knew what he was doing.
They had been out of cases for a couple of weeks and that was driving them crazy, specially dean who had nothing else to do and he was afraid that if he ends up finding some time to himself, and his demons were going to come after him more than before.
He mumbles among his whip. His body trembling in Cas’ embrace. Cas utters a harsh sigh, robbing his fingertips in Dean’s hair.
- can you please tell us a bit more?
“You think I don’t know everything you have told him? I know everything Dean Winchester. I know years ago you kicked him out of your house and told him he can’t stay despite had just turned human and he needed help, he needed your help. But what did you do? You threw him out, you said fuck off to him.” She was breathing heavily and Dean was looking at her with shocked eyes. It was like an old wound was reopened, he remembered the broken look on Cas’ face, how hard he was dealing with human life, how fragile he had become, and she was right, he has been fucking Cas up since forever.
“Sirens could be heard louder each second, people were whispering, a baby’s crying could be heard, and everywhere was red.  Lifeless bodies were reclining on the ground, the last thing he could remember was two oceans draining in front of his eyes.”
“Yes Dean?”
It kinda felt bittersweet. He was happy that he was Cas’ closest friend, but that wasn’t what he wanted, not right now. He wanted to hear from Cas that he loves him too, he needed it for his own sanity.
Dean felt breathless for a moment. It didn’t matter how much he was trying to ignore it, it was coming after him.
-h..he’s fine
-we got married six years ago in the sunset of Miami, beside Pacific Ocean. Cas always loved oceans. He even had them in his eyes. Everybody was there. Every single person in the family we had built ourselves, since none of us were on good terms with our real families… your honor, when I was a child my mom told me angels are watching over me. She died in fire that night. So that was the start of my disbelief in every damn thing. Our father left so I had to become a father at age four, to raise my little brother, and I did a pretty good job actually. Your honor but he was the one who taught me what being alive genuinely means. He reminded me of who I really am. He showed me how to breathe.
He took out some milk from the fridge and purred it in a small pot waiting for it to get warm. It was the first step each night Cas helped him with his sleeplessness.
Call me a princess but I really miss your face. You know what? I’m like a crow on a wire, and you’re the shinning distractions that makes me fly every time. I know you miss me too. After all these years you still suck at verbalizing your feelings, but I know you. I know you better than I know myself. And I know why I’m gone on you. God imagine having the blessing to be a goner for you. It’s not just because you rescued me from my demons, or because how devastatingly handsome you are. You’re the light of my life, you’re the fire of my loins, I’m still gonna wake you up at 3am, asking you why aren’t all the butterflies the same, or why you didn’t answered your phone 3years ago when you were on a business trip. And you’ll wait for my stupid ass to stop, and then with all the patience that I know of you, you’ll respond to all of them, try to justify me, and then, the dark sky wasn’t intimidating anymore, cause I know you’ve got me, and I love you for that, I’ll always love you.”
Dean closes his eyes, his chest burning out of pain. The sound of pouring water in shower was the only thing who broke the brutal silence. He closes his eyes, trying to sleep, as he prayed to lord for himself to keep.
Dean steps closer, sitting on the edge of the bed, behind Cas. He wasn’t completely sober yet, and he know he smelt narcotics and alcohols. He leans down, blowing a soft kiss on Cas’ cheek. Cas stirs, opening his eyes after squeezing it. He spins his head and sees Dean next to him. He remains silent, and without a word he stands up, stretching his arms as he walked away out of the room. Dean follows him, like Cas was running away.
She guided him inside. Girls were gathered around the tv, but Alex wasn’t there. Jody said she’s at hospital and she’ll be home in no time.
Some guy named Garth who had the bed next to Dean’s bids him to play cards with him and the other guys who were gathered in the other side of hallway. Due to he didn’t have anything else to do, he accepts the request willingly and appoints to join them. He couldn’t stand a whole day with his sight covered in red fresh blood.
Dean swallows hard. His eye never leaving Cas’. He could hear his heart beat out loud and he was so sure Cas could too.
-Honey I’m home
-we’ll talk tomorrow, you can have the bed
-you don’t think you can give me this sexy speech without fucking me do you?
-do I look like I have a problem?
-he’s still on silence treatment term right? Asshole
-Mr Winchester were you at second of July this year?
Despite it hadn’t been raining in two days, the fidgeting weather was still out there. Most of the convicts preferred to stay inside, playing cards or fighting each other for no particular reasons.
All of a sudden Dean could feel the rush of blood to his head. All the elation he had minutes ago was vanished into thin air. Anxiety was taking all over him. He wasn’t ready as he used to be. But he wasn’t planning on bailing either. It’s not a thing he would ever do.
“I may have have found some leads but I’m going to look for it in the morning. I don’t feel like doing anything at this moment.”
The long silent drive took Dean almost 20 hours. He didn’t stop in the middle of the road a lot, just once for filing up the tank and once for toilet. He didn’t tell her he was coming but because it was weekend, he was hoping she might be home.
His lashes fell down as he feels the warmth of Cas’ lips on his forehead, giving him a long lingering kiss. Dean smiles, leaning into the touch. Cas puts his other hand on Dean’s wrist, pulling him closer, their chests were touching.
When the judge entered the room, everybody stood up for a respectful salute. He was kind of old, with grey hair. Dean supposed he didn’t have haircut for so long. He was going to look like Sammy in no time.
-yes your honor. Twice
Dean knew he was smiling like an idiot, but fortunately Sam wasn’t there to tease him about it. Or even see it.
Dean whispers naughtily, his eyes still on Cas’ lips. Cas laughs, brushing his tongue on Dean’s upper lip.
Dean stands silence and decides to listen. He didn’t feel like talking much. Today was the last time he could see his brother before the trial, and they were going to say farewell.
Sam doesn’t stop. In fact now he was sobbing harder, despite of his desperate effort to stop.
And the other thing was, he felt lonely, and the bunker somehow felt colder than usual. Sam and his mom were sleeping and he hadn’t seen Cas in almost a week. He was still after Lucifer’s kid and obviously he wasn’t planning on giving up anytime soon.
-I missed you
Dean’s throat was dry, so as his lips. He answers the questions with a low, rumbly voice. His eyes captured by Cas’ gaze. He licks his lips, his mind lost in the moment. Cas didn’t seem angry, but from where Dean was standing he could see the disappointment in his eyes.
-good morning brother
He wasn’t normally a morning person. But that day he was so aroused that he could barely have a proper sleep the previous night.
Sam said he’s going on a road trip with Eileen so he wouldn’t be around for almost a week. Dean smiled and promised his brother that he’ll do just fine the time he’s away. Actually he was deciding to take a trip to Jody’s house. They haven’t met in a long time and Dean was missing her deeply.
-we’ve been down this road before we can do it again. But you have to promise me Dean that you’re going to fight this ok?
collided, a heavy rain was about to start.
“Yeah you know kinda feels lonely without you watching over me.”
Dean knew Cas was awake. But he was dubious to call him. He was sure as hell that the one thing that will rescue him from tonight is Cas. He was in the kitchen and leaning on one of the cabinets there. He picked up his phone and dialed Cas’ number. He didn’t know why his heart was beating so fast. It wasn’t that it was his first time. They’ve had late night calls before too, and mostly Dean was the one who called first. But this was the longest time since he had heard the angel’s voice’ and god he was missing it.
“I wish I could write you. To say how much you mean to me. I know I always tell you in person, but I’ve seen from movies what letters do to people. They’re like a sealed certificate for devotion. I wish I could learn. Bur every time I tried all I had in my head was my wordless essay about my feelings for you. You said I should take it easy, to let it go. Once I start, the flow would take me with itself, and at the end I’ll find myself in the endless world of words. And when I’m done, it’s like a burden has been taken off of my shoulders. I’ve always been an over thinker. Sometimes I would do it on purpose, so you would put your arms around me and tuck me into your embrace. We would stay up all night till dawn breaks, and when the morning light penetrated through the window at us, you would give me forehead kiss. Tell me everything will be ok, it doesn’t matter how much it takes time, our much of you would be left in the end. It’s going to be fine. It’s going to be fine. It’s going to be fine.”
Mr Dean Winchester-Novak you’re sentenced to severe punishment for attempting murder of Castiel Novak and Roy Hollond. You’re retribution with take place at next dawn.
He was wailing, tears were streaming down his face. His chest was so heavy that words couldn’t come out of his mouth anymore. The whole room was filled up with the sound of his sniffs.
“Now that he got himself killed to save you Dean you have to live because of him, and prove him that his sacrifice wasn’t for nothing. You have to be yourself once again for him.” She takes one of Dean’s hands and puts it on his chest, the side that his heart was there. “And you have to remember that he’ always there and he would support you no matter what happens. You have to make him proud again Dean. You should show him how much he means to you.”
“Sirens could be heard louder each second, people were whispering, a baby’s crying could be heard, and everywhere was red.  Lifeless bodies were reclining on the ground, the last thing he could remember was two oceans draining in front of his eyes, and he was too worn out to save them. He was kneeling on the ground, eyes shut, his mind covered in a blank hole.”
-didn’t know you smoke
He takes his steps hastily to the bedroom and he slams the door open, standing close to the door frame.
“Don’t”. She raises her head looking fiercely at him. Dean could see her body was shivering with rage. “He wasn’t even my father.” Her voice was low but Dean didn’t miss the crack of it.
Claire leaves to upstairs without saying anything else. Dean felt Jody’s hand rubbing his back as he buried his face in his hands. After taking some deep breaths he turns to Jody with glassy eyes, his chin trembling.
It was almost 4am when Dean got home, when he enters the hall, he could see all the blue and green balloons that were hanging in a funny way from the wall. Floor was covered in celebrating papers and some unboxed gifts were on the table.
“Ok. You know how the routine works, I’ll be here and you do the things, then you’ll go to your room and then we’ll begin.”
“Thank you Dean I really appreciate it. Do you need help to sleep?”
Dean answers in a gentle indistinct voice. Everything was spinning around his head and his sight turned blurry. He excuses the crowed, finding his way out of there. His hasty steps weren’t helping him either. So, he opts to stay in the middle of the staircase, sitting there in stillness. The empty hole inside him was aching painfully, and suddenly, he was numb all over again.
Cas lets out a sarcastic laugh which was a dagger in Dean’s chest. He swallows heavily. Their big hall seemed like the smallest place in the world. He could feel the drugs taking over him. His demons were about to rise.
It was another one of the sleepless nights that no matter how much he tried, his eyes couldn’t stay shut. 3:28 was the number the clock was showing the last time he checked. He kept wandering in the bunker, aimlessly walking from room to room so maybe his body would finally give up. He could feel all the tiredness in his body. Maybe that was the whole point. He was that tired that had led to his insomnia.
-how long have you been together?
-when was the first time?
Dean shakes his head in agreement, putting his lips on Cas’ and kissing him hungrily. He could feel the drugs in his veins, but his real addiction was in front of him, Cas was the drug, he has always been.
“Cas you’ll call if you needed any help right? We’ll come to you, you just have to tell us and we’ll be there. You don’t have to deal with it on your own.”
By the time they were finished they go to the yard for a short walk. It was cold outside and it just stopped to rain and waterholes had covered the ground.
“You certainly do”
“If you had any nightmares feel free to call me. I don’t want you to go through it alone.”
-I..called Jess..and told her to take him out
They both laugh and then, silence was conquering between them. Not that he complained. It was actually a thing happened a lot whenever they were talking, to share their silence and it was one of the most comfortable things he ever experienced in his life.
“Dean, I want to remind you that no matter everything goes crashing down you will always have a special place in my heart. No matter how life has treated us all these years and how many times we fell apart we always found our ways back to each other. So I won’t be going anywhere as long as you have me.”
He takes a deep breath, exhaling it sharply. It was time. He tried so hard to scape it. But it came back to him.
-happy birthday buddy
Benny was released at late night. He still had some scars and apparently his black eye wasn’t going to be healed anytime soon. He goes to bed early, so Dean doesn’t find much time to talk to him.
“How are Sam and Mary?”
“Hello Dean”
The food there was nourishing. Actually way better than Dean had anticipated or heard before, or seen in the movies. They alter their sit next to the poker group. Benny spend the most of the time messing with them so his breakfast was turned cold.
Cas leaves to their room without waiting for an answer. Dean watches his trace as he faded away. He closes his eyes, standing in the middle of the hall, as the drugs were rushing into his veins.
-Sam’s coming today?
Dean looks at her with confusion, waiting for her to continue.
After unpacking and changing cloths, he went back downstairs to girls. Patience was in her room and Kaia was nowhere to be seen, it was just him and the angry
-bold of you to assume I have a problem with that
-you’ve got a girl back home waiting for ya?
Dean was early as always, and Sam punctual as usual. Basically they had nothing to talk about, there was nothing left. This time, they were more like brothers. It had been long since Dean actually felt the brotherhood between them. Sam seemed like he cried all his way to there. Dean couldn’t understand why Sam wasn’t as happy as the guys back there. He couldn’t pick out why his brother wasn’t content.
Dean’s heart drop. He moves his lips but words were too desperate to come out of his mouth.
-I do
“Dean look, I really don’t know all of the things that had happened between you two, but I do know you have been through a lot together and you always decided to cope with it the Winchester way, which led your inner anger to grow on you. And because he was always around you took your anger on him, because you knew he wouldn’t leave you, and if he does he would come back eventually. But Dean you had lost him before too and we saw that you can’t function even a little bit when he’s not around. You didn’t learn from the mistakes you made. I know what your asshole father did to you when you were younger. You don’t need to tell me everything Dean. I’m a mother I know how kids are. You’re still afraid even though it’s too late. You were never taught that you can be loved too and Cas was the first vocal one about that and that was what freaked you out.”
Sam and Jack left after the meeting time was up. Dean was still sitting there, staring at unparticular corner. It was getting colder and he didn’t have the strength to stand up. The chill was piercing through his body, and all he could see was red.
-fine
-if you don’t abide anything I tell you deliberately, I can tell pretty soon
-where’s Jack?
-your trail is in a month
“put your hands where I can see them.. now stand up and come with us.. Dean Winchester you’re under arrest for murder.. everything that you say will be used against you in court”
“Everybody who knows you knows how much you loved him. I just met him once personally but you should see your face when you’re talking about him. It’s like the sun is shining on your face. And your cheeks go all pink. I know love when I see it boy.”
He could feel the warmth of tears on his cheeks. Cas edges near to Dean, putting his hand on the back of Dean’s neck, brushing his lips between his eyebrows.
“I always hated the time you were away. I know you kept calling me constantly so I won’t feel your absence even when were parted miles away. You always called at night, and listened to me nagging for one straight hour about hell and heaven, and then you would wait for me to pass out on our bed. Sometimes you would read one of the poems you wrote me, which is my favorite lullaby. But nights without you are brutally cold. I don’t know why you insisted on having a king-sized bed. Not that I don’t like it, but whenever you weren’t in there to share it with me it felt like a wormhole that was swallowing me, like I was drowning. It’s so numbing outside Cas. I wish you were here.”
-I .. I have always been who did the repairing in the house .. we never had someone do it for us .. but I was gone your honor. I was long gone
“We have a reputation don’t we?”
-I couldn’t think straight .. there was this man .. and .. he had a tool box, they were standing next to each other .. so .. close .. they shouldn’t have been that close
He stalls, without answering. In fact he had nothing to say. And he was hoping the judge would understand that. It wasn’t a thing he really wanted to talk about it. It was the part of his life he was ready to give everything so it could vanish.
He could hear a footstep getting close to him, assuming it’s Benny. The good thing about him was that he never asked what, or why. He always just sat beside him, listening to his silence.
He could feel the blush creep up to his cheeks. But it was the utter truth. For a long time Cas sat behind him in his room until he fell sleep, and whenever he woke up from a nightmare Cas was there to hold him, to tell him he’ll be alright. And Dean craved every second of it.
“It’s all a matter of seconds. Like jumping off a cliff. Once you decide to jump, there’s no coming back from that. And when you’ve finally reached your destination, you’re redeemed, you’re free of yourself. All you have to do is counting.. one .. two .. three”
-I’m not trying to logic you, or lecture about what an idiot you are. But if you really don’t want to get away with this, it’s fine, that’s your problem. But think about Jack. He still needs you.
“Cas, I wish you were here. It’s so cold and I don’t know what to do. It’s all your fault. You made me a damn spoiled princess. Cas I wish you were here. So I could put my head on your shoulder and the sound of your breaths would twist like a lullaby in my ears. And you would talk about how worried you are about the flowers in your office. Sometimes I feel like you love them more than me. You’re always upset when they don’t flower like they did last spring. I remember once you cried when your secretary burned your favorite plant. You’re such a fuss you know that? But I still love you. And we could spend the whole night watching the old crappy cowboy movies, and I know you never liked them, but you never complained, and I love you for that, I’ll always love you.
“If ... if everybody knew ... why he didn’t know it himself?” there was a moment of silent and Dean Jody’s face tightened. He knew he was not going to like what he was going to hear.
He squeezes his eyes. It was like it was raining right above him. His uncontrolled tears were falling endlessly.
“He made me happy Jody. Whenever he was around I had this ... safe ... feeling inside me. Like something was telling me I’ll be fine no matter what happens. And he would come to me with all the calmness that I knew from him and tried to distract me. He drank beers with me and pretended to be drunk even though it didn’t have any effects on him. He would stay there and listen to my shitty music the whole day without complaining. He was everything I could ever ask for and more. And I lost him because I didn’t deserve him. But Jody he died saving me and I didn’t deserve that. That selfless bastard would even kill himself to save a fucking bee and god he was the best thing that had ever happened to me.”
And he was right. After ringing the doorbell she nearly jumped and hugged him. Jody smelled like moms, and Dean couldn’t be luckier to have her.
Dean’s eyes meet the scar on Jack’s forehead. He swallows his smile, staring at it. He leans his head close, putting his lips on the scar, kissing it long and gentle.
They were all dismissed and judges left for the final decision, and juries companied them.
-you’re the one who left and now you’re suing me for leaving you?
Dean stalls a bit, trying to find the adequate words for his answer.
-hey buddy
It was one of those gloomy Lebanon mornings that you couldn’t tell if it was going to rain or the clouds are going to hang in there for the rest of the day. Winter was almost over but you could feel the chill everywhere you laid your eye on.
-Jack’s gonna be safe with us
Sam drops his head, exhaling heavily. Dean smiles, leaning back again.
“You told him he’s dead to you, you blamed him for whatever the fuck happened in your screwed up life and yet he was always there, he always forgave you for whatever shit you said or did to him, and what you did for him huh? You let him go you let him fucking die.”
-you need to talk
Sam drops his head, Dean was glaring at him with a smirk.
The courtroom was smaller than he expected. It was designed with stale dark wooden material. The jury was consist of both man and woman who seemed to be in their middle ages. Dean was wondering how they got there. It was a pouring rain outside. So it must’ve been very hard for them. He was thinking of apologizing to them later.
When the meeting time came, Dean was early at the place. Sitting behind a chair in a room full of no one. The moment he sees his son he stands up, rushing towards him. Without saying anything to his brother he takes Jack out of Sam’s embrace and hugs him. It was the first time he got to see him in months, and Dean couldn’t be happier.
Sam looks at him with shocked eyes. Dean steers clear of any eye contact with him. He didn’t mean to freak him out but his truth was revealed, he didn’t want to be saved.
“I remember you always told me after you fall in love there’s no such thing as ‘I’ or ‘me’. Because when you commit your heart to somebody, you’re willing to share every piece of your soul. Each laugh, each despair. All of them are meant to make the bond stronger. That’s why people are meant to be together. That’s what makes people differ from each other. Once you give your heart to someone, you’re not yourself anymore. And that’s what love means. The utter compound of individuality into solidarity. You said if we go down so we’ll go down together. There’s no holding back. There’s no giving up. Cause we’re always better together. We have always been.”
In light of the most recent episode, here's some fluff.
The next morning dawned bright and warm as Dean was wakened from his sleep by his excited brother.
He was momentarily distracted by his thoughts as Sam made his way through the bar entrance. “Hey, Cas,” the hunter greeted.
Cas then turned his attention back towards Dean and noticed the look on his hunter's face. He tilted his head in question, "Is something wrong, Dean?"
Dean frowned, “Strange? I just remember looking over when he started talking and then maybe noticed his eyes...It gets kinda fuzzy after that.”
Dean nodded, “Yes, I was looking to make seafood stew for me and my friend here,” He gestured towards Cas, “And come to find I'm out of crayfish.”
His magic sparked beneath his skin as he left his room and made his way to the kitchenette. It wasn't until he entered and saw the form curled up on his couch, that he remembered last night. He had invited Cas to stay the night; that's why his magic was awake. Taking a quick look down the hall to make sure the door to his workshop was closed, Dean turned his attention to the coffee pot. He needed coffee before anything else. Forgoing his usual morning ritual on account of his guest, Dean approached the couch where Cas was still sleeping soundly.
“The man you left the bar with was the Kelpie we were hunting, Dean,” he answered.
He and Sam raced along the docks searching for Dean and the Kelpie he was unknowingly with. If what Sam had said was true, then the Kelpie was going to try and drown Dean. Just as they were about to call this area a bust, Cas spotted Dean and the man from the bar leaning against a railing and enjoying the sunset; Dean was completely oblivious to the danger he was in.
Mary smiled at her youngest son's excitement, “Yes. There are a pair of mirrors that can be used for communication, no matter the distance.” She paused to consider, “Hmm, and there are a few more items that he can use for school that I can think of, as well.”
Dean gave Kira a look of confusion as Merula stomped away. “What was that about?”
"Sammy? What happened?" Dean was clearly confused, but he returned his brother's hug.
Dean nodded, “Yeah.”
Charlie nodded, “So while you wait for the customer, how about I run over to the Creole place you love so much and get us lunch?”
Mary smiled fondly, “Of course, is there any other kind that Dean prefers?”
Once his cleaning ritual was complete, Dean headed to the bathroom to shower and change out of his sweats. Once back in his room and dressing in his favorite pair of worn jeans and a well-worn Led Zeppelin t-shirt, Dean picked up his phone and dialed. “Cas? This is Dean. I'm calling to see if you wanna hang out for the day? I need to go to the market and the docks and I wouldn’t mind some company. I need some fresh crayfish and I know a guy. ”
“Well how else do you expect me to react! We've been married twelve years now and I just now find out?!” John yelled, feelings of betrayal getting the better of him,“makes me wonder what else you've been hiding from me!”
Dean found himself agreeing, the case taking a back burner for the moment as he watched his companion order two Whiskey's and led him over to a small table.
Dean soon forgot about the case as he and his new acquaintance, Aquila, made small talk in between the flirty banter. Once the drinks were gone, Aquila spoke up, “Wanna go for a walk along the pier? There's a place I know that I think you'll enjoy,” the words were practically purred as he leaned in closer to Dean.
Five minutes later, Dean led Cas to the market. Here he bought potatoes, carrots, vegetable stock, onions, and a few extra fresh herbs. “Okay, that's half of my list for tonight, now to the docks!”
“Must have been his bridle then, and a source of his magic.” Sam looked at the notes on his laptop, “Okay, I think that's everything.”
Sam frowned, “His revenge drives him. And in a way, I can sympathize with him. I almost lost Jess to a demon, just like Dad did with Mom.” Sam gestured to the quiet blonde sitting beside him.
Satisfied with the placement of his crystals, he went over to check on his guests, "I'll be in the back room. Call if you need anything, alright?"
“Ummm...according to what I read. They are usually identified by a silver pendant. This pendant allows them to change forms, but in their true form it takes the shape of a bridle.”
He decided to give the brothers some space, going back to the crystals as they looked around. Even while his work kept him occupied, he couldn't help but think about the man with blue eyes. Nothing was so captivating as a pair of eyes, no matter who they belonged to. Knowing Rowena and Charlie had helped Dean accept his
Turning to take in the rest of his flat, Dean decided to use that time to clean and purify. Heading into his home workshop, Dean grabbed a sprig of sage and returned to the front room. He lit the herb and made sure the whole area was coated in the fumes. Once satisfied, he grabbed a broom and focused on sweeping the bad karma from his home. There was a reason a “Good Vibes Only” sign hung above his door.
