John looked at his watch. He really should be getting back to work. But, then again, the site probably wouldn’t be opened again for a few days at least. As he followed Sherlock back out of the flat he narrowly avoided bumping into a man who was leaving the flat opposite. “Oops, sorry,” John said. The man scowled at him.
John had lived with Jess for a couple of months now and the interest that she had thus far shown John about his life could fill a thimble. It basically stretched to wanting to know when the next meal he was cooking was going to be. Yet, she chose this moment to interrupt and give John advice.
Sherlock shook his head “No, I’m just here for work. I wondered if you might know who this is…” he pulled his phone out of his pocket and pressed it’s screen, clearly looking for the photos he’d taken earlier. John had a bad feeling about this and was about to intervene when Sherlock found what he was looking for and turned the phone to the woman.
John shook his head, “No, but we were wondering if you knew who this was”. He clicked his fingers at Sherlock for the phone. Wordlessly, Sherlock flicked to the relevant photo of McAlister and the mystery man. The woman clicked her tongue as she looked at the photo.
“Look, you have to understand how hard it is here in Northlew. For me. How hard it was for us. I mean look at me.” Here he paused to gesture at himself. John frowned.
Ines muttered something that John was pretty sure was a swear word in Swedish. He grinned at her. She rolled her eyes and headed off to where the spade was lying. John went and retrieved the wheelbarrow. It was lying upside down on the discard pile. Its handles were covered in mud, of course.
Philip had set them to three separate corners of the square cleared in the field that they were working on and tasked them with removing the top layer of mud with the trowel, working towards the middle.
“Well I didn't exactly plan it that way, it just sort of... happened.” She is nervous now putting her hand behind her head in a guilty stance. He still doesn't look up just nods and says:
She licks the sweet juices off the older woman thighs, and all around her pussy until she can't find anymore. Then she sits back Andrea is disappointed at letting down her Mistress thinking it was the longest its taken her to get a girl off since she was 14. But Danella isn't showing in signs of being disappointed.
“You really think one woman could hold me down? If that ever happened i'd shoot myself. I'm only suggesting another … date of sorts, She was just * sigh * delicious.” Jade tried to play it cool but her hot head one over.
“That proves it then, we kissed didn't we.” Sherlock didn't even flinch never taking his eyes of the newspaper.
A crossed the world Andrea wakes up and pulls on her robe before getting up and sitting at the desk right next to the bed. The woman in the bed starts to wake up as she looks around her “Andrea what are you doing come back to bed.” The woman says sleepily. She rolls her eyes in her direction before closing the letter she was writing in an envelope and signing the front of it. Then she thinks
“Please take a shower and we will talk more about this later.” She is all to happy to comply knowing the worst of that conversation is far from behind her. She goes up the stairs then strips promptly and gets in the shower as the steaming water runs over her body she thinks.
You are a very sexual person, I'm not going to say anymore on that though it is obvious. You enjoy your job as a  secretary, you have a big abandonment issue which is probably because of your mother's death or perhaps because of me.  Your main goal when you started stealing was to make the people that have made your life a living hell suffer and feel what you felt so you have stolen from a lot of german banks and some american people possibly London too. You work somewhere in the government and your in cars a lot. Also you’ve known your driver for roughly 5 years and she is the only person except perhaps the women who took you in who you fully trust with your life. Did I miss anything or do you want me to tell you the entire history of the field next to us to.”
You have the hair of someone who's lived in the same place for a while ponytails on your wrist that have been well worn in your very clean and you did all your crimes secretly which means you were trying to keep them from someone who’s helped you, only plausible conclusion it's the person who took you off the streets, and you don’t have the haunted look so you couldn’t have been out there for long.
After storming from Mycroft's office he had stolen his private plane and made his way back to London. Now he knew he couldn't worry about Andrea, who was not back from wherever she was now. He had to focus on the 2nd most important person in his life; John. He snuck into his old apartment and found that it had been uninhabited for the two years, he had been gone. Then he went online and found out that John had a new apartment on North Gower Street. He broke in and found John's planner, and saw that he was going to be at a restaurant on a date tonight. Then he went back to his apartment and waited.
“I thought we agreed we weren't going to fight about this, he's my father and I need to spend time with him, remember you got to see me every day for 10 years. He doesn't have that time.”
“Well technically i’ve had a daughter for 18 years but I assume you mean how long have I known about her which would be 2 years.”
“A more interesting question is, since when have you and John been a thing. I thought you were afraid of commitment.” She asks him amusement seeming to be a permanent fixture in her eyes.
Sherlock and Andrea go into separate aisles on the plane. Hours have passed by when he gets up and sits on the aisle a crossed from hers . She is reading a book with her legs propped up on the edge of the seat in front of her. She doesn’t even look up when he sits down, he clears his throat, still no response then he says
He stepped out from behind the tree and was about to say some of what he just thought when she burst into a fit of laughter.
“Well yes, but you have no reason too i’m still alive aren’t I?” From the look on John’s face he realized he should have chosen his words more carefully. No one needed a reminder of the time he was “dead”.
“Oh be patient my pet there is more to come soon, before you leave you are to give me your number and I will call for you when I want you.” Andrea nods and Danella sighs “You can talk you know, I like my pets to have a free mind.”
When Sherlock got to the restaurant John was at a table all alone. He went into the restaurant stole an employee hat from the hat rack and went to John's table.
“For half an hour, I‘m sure the pilot has better things to do than wait around here, who’s getting off?”
“ Oh and by the way you were right... about my driver i've known her for … 8 years now. We met on the street. Her names Jade.” Sherlock nods noticing that she twirls her little silver wire bracelet around her wrist when she talks about Jade. She looks like she wants to say something else but then she gets a far off look in her eye and stays silent. Sherlock's not one to push so he walks beside her in silence until they reach the building. She runs up the stairs ahead of him and looks for the case file. When he gets up the stairs, she has found it and is sitting crossed legged on the table reading intently. John is just around the corner, a cup of coffee in his hand. He seems to have calmed down because he is smiling at Andrea and smiles at Sherlock when he see's him. When Sherlock goes over to him, John whispers. “She reminds me of someone.” Sherlock knows what he means he kisses his cheek and says “ I didn't mean to make you worry.” John sighs. “I guess that's as close to an apology as i'm gonna get.”
“Well there is this one case i'm on.” She got very exited and nearly shouted “Well tell me about it.”
She gets out her computer and just messes around on it until they pull up to the private government airport that houses Mycroft's private jet. After the driver flashes her possibly fake government clearance ID at the man at the gate he lets them in and they go to the plane at the end of the runway. After Sherlock and Andrea get out of the car the driver, drives a little ways down the runway, gets out of the car, walks up to where Andrea and Sherlock are standing and pushes a button on the remote that's in her hand. The car blows up in a big display of fire and smoke.
Without missing a beat the woman says “Can I buy you a drink?” Andrea feels like falling, never in her life has a woman bought her a drink she's always the one buying, the dominant one, but this woman shows obvious dominant sighs and Andrea thinks, t
“Well that's just great not like we had plans today or anything, why would she be coming here. You do know that you don’t owe her anything…”
“I know my mind's not indestructible brains are actually one of the softest organs in the human body and can be easily bruised.” Sherlock says pulling down his pant leg and turning back to the table.
with John the reason you haven't talked to him since you got back?” Sherlock shudders on the word relationship just like she knew he would.
Finally she goes up and licks at the leaking hole she puts her tongue in and uses her nose to play with Andrea's throbbing clit, Andrea is immediately grinding her hips into the other girls face, which Danella shows she displeases by grabbing Andrea's thigh roughly and digging her nails in, Andrea stops grinding and sits still even though it tortures her to do so.
“What? Its only chicha, hardly 10 % alcohol content.” Sherlock shakes his head then realizing getting on to her for drinking so early in the morning, (or at all) is a battle he would loose, so not worth fighting for. “What have you been doing for two years?” He asks obviously concerned.
John is furious stalking across the room and getting his medical supplies before kneeling down and starting to stitch up Sherlock’s cut without his permission. Sherlock looks unfazed by his stitching but Andrea can see it’s hurting him.
“So who is she, when did you go to Greece, and what does she want?” There was a hard jealous edge to John's words,
Andrea smiles “that's all i'm asking for, but from your face I can tell you were pretty clueless about the normal stuff I did list off so, i'll write a list of things you should know and you look them up. Deal?” He agrees hurriedly just glad to make her stop talking. He takes the paper from her and hurries to his room, where he sets it face up on his laptop and leaves it to be forgotten.
He threw the letter a little too hard at Sherlock who saw that on the front in unmistakably girly handwriting was his name and a stamp from Greece.
Just then the food they ordered arrived. Sherlock had a sandwich that he didn't even touch and Andrea's was a gigantic cinnamon bun that she eagerly dug into when it was set down.
Andrea just laughs and more until she can hardly breath from laughing. “You read that way wrong, I made that list for him because he is clueless about sex and then you ha ha ha you didn't even notice he was trying to push you off, ha you're gonna have to do something big for him to forgive you for this.”
“Oh I think I can take care of that.” She chuckled sneakily, while pulling her computer out of her bag. She logs in and goes onto the airline website. With a few fast clicks she added fake names to the list of employees and printed out an employee clearance card out the side of her computer for both her and Sherlock. Sherlock takes it and then waits for her to tell him her plan, after a couple of minutes of silence she does. “So, we go into the airport at the west wearing the name badges and tell any of the employees that stop us that we are new employees that are lost and we have to load the cargo onto the New Zealand flight. They give us directions and we confuse the people that are actually there to load the bags and tell them to leave for a different one, you know all the manipulation tactics. Get into the carrier and possibly get into the top part below the seat and above the cargo bay, so we don’t freeze to death in the unventilated cargo area.”
Andrea comes down the stairs and looks at their faces before saying “ I’m sorry to interrupt your little lovers quarrel, but I haven’t eaten since 1 this morning, and there isn’t much food in the house...” Sherlock looks up at her words and then smooths back his hair. “Oh yes of course, we should go out to that deli down the street come along John.”
Sherlock turned to him, “Why don’t you go back inside and ask that woman what else she knows about James and Anthony? I think it’s a better idea for us to split our resources at this point. If I have to stand in that hot bar for one more minute I’ll go mad. So, I’ll go to the library, you go in and chat up the barmaid some more.”
“Okay, so what you do is you use the tip of your trowel to dig out all the discolouration. You might need to get a teaspoon or something for the fiddlier bits. Put all the dug out soil into a sample bag. Tag it. Then photograph the excavation, with the measurement markers, then sketch it. Obviously, you bag any actual items you find in the hole. And then you fill out a report with an analysis of what you think you’ve found. For example...” He’d been digging out John’s hole whilst talking and pointed at the new hole “...What I think you have here Johnny-boy, is your very own, ancient....tree root.” He laughed uproariously at his own wit. John stared and said nothing. Philip frowned, “Right well, do the photo and then come get a report form from me.”
John shook his head mutely. Sherlock continued, “Then I shan't be making that mistake, come on John. Let’s go back to the shop and see if the woman there knows where McAlister’s ex-boyfriend is now living.”
“No idea,” said Sarah. “Okay, let’s go get the equipment and finish recording everything that’s here. John, go get Molly and Philip. You can take over at the trench.”
. And if this did turn into a real dig, like on Time Team, then maybe that’s what he’d been after all along.
“I don’t think Sarah meant that we had to stay right here. We can probably go and sit down, have a cup of tea maybe.” said John.
“Is it true?” Tony asked, winking in Molly’s direction. At this she couldn’t stop the tears and rushed out of the cabin, crying noisily.
Sherlock stepped back and leaned against the window, “I need your help breaking into the undertakers.”
“They have the most ridiculous rules, that they actually enforce. They wouldn’t let me keep my bones on the desk. Ridiculous.”
John smiled back at her, not saying anything, before going back to scraping at the mud with his trowel.
Sherlock smiled at him, but a bit hesitantly, as if he wasn’t quite used to getting this kind of reaction when he revealed his thinking.
She gasped and clenched her hands on the newspaper convulsively. “Oh my god. That’s…it’s… James. James McAlister. But how…” she trailed off and looked back at Sherlock with tears in her eyes. John looked down at the photo. The man was clearly dead in the photo.
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe. Someone from your office. I wasn’t paying attention. This, this, is all that matters” He gestured at the skeleton “Fascinating.”
At first John can’t believe his eyes. He’s still half asleep, surely this must be a dream. Dr Sherlock Holmes cannot be standing at the foot of his bed at one in the morning. But, as he blinks the sleep from his eyes, his mind wakes up a bit more and becomes sharper. He is. Sherlock Holmes is standing there, his smug expression beginning to slip the longer John stares at him saying nothing. John is suddenly, iridescently, furious.
“Everyone dreams of a career on their knees” Sarah said, actually winking at John as she did so. He laughed, his mood perking up considerably. Maybe this job wouldn’t be so bad with a part way decent supervisor. It helped that Sarah was very pretty. John didn’t consider himself to have a type, but he wouldn’t say no.
Anthony’s head whipped back up at that to look at John. “He did have a bit of a barny with the head of construction at that road project he was trying to stop. Must have been a couple of weeks ago now. I only know about it because one of our mutual friends, Jenny, was there and told me about it later.”
Breaking into an undertakers in the middle of the night was definitely something that was frowned upon by the police. But, it was so nice to be wanted, and to be involved in something. Even if his main job seemed to be making encouraging noises and moving heavy things.
“Look here” said Sherlock pointing “You can see blunt force trauma to the skull, both here and here. There’s probably more all around. We’ll see more when we excavate the whole thing. But just here” at this he leaned down pointing to a humerus “You can see knife scrapings. Why would someone scrape away at this particular part? And there are ribs missing. I bet we won’t find them anywhere in the site. They’ve been removed. But why? If this was a normal burial they’d be here. Maybe they got carried away by time, or an animal. But the same thing was found in Gough cave in Cheddar when they found those cannibal tribes.”
John thought about asking what Sherlock was going to do with these but decided that he was too tired. He was already slightly regretting his impulsive decision to follow Sherlock here.
John’s anger stared to subside even as his frustration increased. “What. are. you. doing. here?” he repeated, stressing each word slowly as he leaned his body over Sherlock. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to punch Sherlock, laugh, or grab him by the lapels of his coat and pull him onto the bed.
John wasn’t really paying much attention to his surroundings as he walked across the site. He was still musing over how he was going to broach the topic with Sherlock when Sarah suddenly shouted for help. On arriving Sarah had gone straight over to the small trench where the skeleton had been found. They were going to continue excavating around where the skeleton had been found, in case anything else related could be found in the surrounding area. John looked over to where she was standing. She was on the edge of the trench, looking down. As he started walking towards her he was over-taken by a dash of dark wool. Sherlock was sprinting towards Sarah, who having shouted for help was now standing quietly with her hand pressed against her mouth, still looking down. Sherlock joined her and looked down also. Just as John got to them Sherlock muttered “Fascinating” under his breath.
I did two updates this week as next week I'm going on holiday in France. There are rumours of WiFi where I'm staying, so hopefully I will be able to update anyway. This was just in case.
“This is blood. I think this is probably how he died. Blow to the back of the head. There would have been blood. Lots of blood. But there’s not much on his clothes. Interesting.” At this he straightened and clicked his magnifying glass closed again before slipping it into his pocket.
“Anthony. I’m John Watson and this is Sherlock Holmes” he pushed Sherlock away from the desk and offered Anthony his hand, which the man reluctantly took and shook. “We were wondering if we could ask you some questions? About James?”
“Oh yeah?” asked John, leaning to look more fully at Molly. The night before she’d been very quiet, just twirling her hair in a nervous way and not looking John in the eyes. Molly blushed under the extra scrutiny. She nodded. Ines continued “Oh yes, she was telling me. She could really help with the identification but Philip won’t let her anywhere near it.”
John hadn’t really had any expectations about why Sherlock was in his bedroom, but he was still surprised by this answer. And a tiny bit disappointed. He sat back down, slipped off the bed and started rooting around for his clothes.
The town of Northlew in Devon was due to have a new road built but the survey had highlighted two possible areas of interest. One area had a series of subterranean tunnels that needed digging out, investigating and recording. The second area had shown lumpy ground, suggesting the possibility of an old settlement. John had been assigned to the second site. So far, after a week, all they had found was mud. Increasingly wet mud as the rain picked up day after day. John’s housemate was working on the site with the tunnels, and each night she returned glowing with tales of the constructions. Her site was deemed the more obviously interesting so it had the more established archaeologists assigned to it. As a result they already had a cabin for tools (filled to the brim with actual tools), a cabin for bagged evidence, a cabin for coffee breaks, and a toilet. John’s site had the wheel barrow, the spade, a supervisor leading his very first project, two disgruntled Swedish graduate archaeologists and John. John had no experience of archaeology and had a mild limp. Essentially, as far as he could work out, he’d been hired as a spade monkey. And he hadn’t even been given his own spade yet.
John looked up at the kitchen clock, it was gone two, “Oh, I was in town with Sherlock,” for some reason he was unwilling to share the reason so he just added “he wanted to get breakfast.”
! He rolled out of bed and padded out of his bedroom, down the corridor to the spare room where he’d left Sherlock earlier that morning. First checking that his pyjamas were arranged decently (though that ship had already sailed the night before) he knocked before pushing open the door. The room was empty. There was, in fact no sign that anyone had been in there at all. The bed was as neat as it had always been. Untouched. Frowning, John made his way downstairs.
John, looked down at the skeleton again, It was half uncovered from the mud now, lying on it’s front. “Well, I think it’s a woman, probably around 25 years old. I can’t tell what period these bones are from. The skeleton appears to be missing some bones, though they might be further down in the mud.”
“I did not lie to her, I merely told her the worst of you it's not the same thing.” He was still so calm compared to Sherlock's fuming.
Tell me everything you know about me, that I didn’t tell you so I can give you a little test on your “deductions”.”
“You were alive that whole time and you didn’t think to tell me, do you have any idea how hard these couple years have been on me.” John was whisper yelling at Sherlock tears in his eyes. John's date just awkwardly leaned against the side of the building watching it all unfold. Sherlock looked at John who was choking back tears.
“Oh so if you could have kept it from me, you wouldn’t have told me.” Sherlock ignores him and starts to read the letter.
John sulks off to do as he was told, unsure why he always follows Sherlock's orders. When he’s done making the room look presentable the doorbell rings. “John would you get that i’m busy.”
“Mo.. Molly Hooper? you told your annalist and not your….” He suddenly trailed off and started to look uncomfortable.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, I’m sorry I couldn’t watch you grow up and i’m so jealous that my brother did. I don’t care that you steal things I wouldn’t even care if you murdered people. I just regret everything that's happened to you except that you exist at all because if I could go back and change it I wouldn’t. You are the most important thing in my life now whether I like it or not, and I promise from now on I will protect you from the world and always be there when you need me.”
“He already knows, you told him before you told me? He’s the one that took you in, how could you go to him?” Sherlock says clearly upset.
“Its okay, my pet, you'll get better the more we do this, and i'm sure you'll have plenty of practice.” she says to Andrea who is still kneeling on the floor. She lets her up then they move to the bed. Danella slips out of her dress and lays next to Andrea who is quivering in anticipation for what comes next. But instead Danella begins talking and she knows the nights activities are over.
Danella chuckles, “well you didn't do to bad yourself definitely a record for the first time.” Andrea's beams at the compliment and wonders aloud.
Sherlock and Andrea are far enough away from it not to get burnt but not far enough away to not feel the intense heat now coming off it. Sherlock’s jaw drops in complete shock. Seeing his expression Andrea says
“So you prefer to risk going back to jail or possibly getting shot on sight in another country just for the thrill?”
He was sure she was being overconfident I mean he didn’t even remember seeing her before, but then he thought about it. He saw her at a party,a year ago looking like everyone else her intellect clearly hidden under a short dress and a ton of makeup, he hadn’t even noticed her, then just a glance from out of the side of his eye. He saw her at a lunch date he had with his brother, she came into his office and handed him a paper, that time he did look at her and he saw nothing off about her he saw a city girl born and bred he saw a middle child that was always looking for her boss's attention. He didn’t see this girl, he saw someone normal and pathetic and he didn’t even think twice about it. There were other times he saw her all of the rest of them at public places where his brother was as well it wasn’t hard to connect the dots.
Andrea nods and says, “I was here on a case, my first one actually, it might be a bad sign that I ended up sleeping with the thief.”
“Well we got an interesting letter from a woman in Greece.” John was trying to keep his calm but his anger showed in his voice.
“So that's another thing from the time you were “dead” that you weren’t planning on telling me then?”
Danella sighs “modeling doesn't pay like it used to, and besides my passion is here so I thought it was only fitting.”
“That's just great, great, happy for you really, but I need to get ready for work so... you should leave.” Andrea looks at her confused, she's always been able to read everyone, except for Jade which I guess is what makes her such a good friend, but now... she knows something's wrong only question is what?
“Oh there you are John have you seen my...” he trails off seeing the piece of paper in John's hands, and his face turns a deep red color. “oh I I uh thats um research...” he trails off.
“I don't work with any of them, their just there to give a layman's opinion on cases.” She rolls her eyes at him.
“When were you first....” he trails off then sighs and puts down the book, he tries to talk again and finally gets out the words he needs to say. “sexually active?” He looks like he's dreading the conversation and honestly would rather be anywhere but here. She almost laughs out loud realizing what he's trying to do.
She walks right past him and into the house leaving him dumbstruck. When he finally snaps out of it she’s already in the kitchen.
Andrea smiles and picks up her dress slipping it back on “i'll look forward to that.” she goes to pick up her thong but Danella shakes her head and she sets it back down, she's about to go into hallway when Danella steps away from the bed, naked this time, once again it's all Andrea can do not to drool and stare at the magnificence.  She walks up to where Andrea is standing and kisses her passionately before pushing her back out into the hall.
“You know I would have told you I just… couldn’t, believe me you were the only person I wanted to tell, I would have gladly traded my brothers knowledge for yours but you don’t have a get away jet and terrorist information.”
Sherlock is beat red now and he stops her “Okay, okay I get it I won't question your life choices anymore okay?”
“I was right you do work in the government in fact you work for my brother as his personal secretary, ha I can’t wait to see his face when he hears you’re his niece.” She just looked at him for a second and then it finally clicked.
She made it sound like it wasn’t the most insulting thing she could have done to Sherlock. He just looked out the window clearly not wanting to say anymore.
“It was actually quite easy I needed help, I hated you, I thought who else would take me in because I wasn’t going to go to you, and it struck me, your brother would take me in he could give me a place to stay and all I would have to do is tell him the truth. Though I was expecting to only be at his house for a little while, but I got a bit attached and when I turned fifteen he made me his secretary.”
When Sherlock woke up in John's bed he immediately forgot where he was, when he realizes he smiles to himself and then quickly stops. He actually had no idea why John had wanted him to share his bed. Nothing sexual had happened between them and,they had two perfectly working beds plus he needed his sleeping space, but just then he woke up and the sun hit John’s face he understood, if only for a second, then the sun left his face and John started to stir. He looked up at Sherlock as he was getting up. The smile from last nights make out session, still on his face.
“Where did you get a book? your bag wasn’t big enough to hold that and four bottles of liquor.” She still doesn’t even acknowledge that he’s talking to her. He sighs “Okay, I may have over reacted a little bit, and um I understand that you wouldn’t go to me when you were in trouble, I mean I probably wouldn’t go to me if I needed help. That's why I don’t understand why so many people do I guess I’m just that good um.”
“Relax I was kidding. But we should see which days work best , I know you'll be busy with your new... distraction.”
“Are you seriously trying to give me “the talk”.” She asks barley containing her laughter. Sherlock grimaces and says “believe me I would really rather not have this talk either but it seems to me like you need it.”
“Actually no, you know what i'm not going... go have father daughter time, while I sit here and brood. And don't think your getting out of talking about this, we are going to have a very long talk the instant you get back.”
John responds to the gentle touch and hugged the other man tightly not giving him time to refuse he buries his head in Sherlock's hair, and Sherlock was so shocked at the unexpected touch that he just let him. Then John turned his head toward Sherlock's and kissed him. Sherlock was still in too much shock to do anything about it, until two seconds after John's mouth reaches his, when he kisses John back surprising himself and the smaller man. No matter that Johns mouth tastes like a liquor store, Sherlock still feels like this is how its supposed to be like maybe this is what he'd wanted to do since the moment he met John. But he knows John will probably not remember any of this in the morning and allows himself only a few more minutes of kissing before peeling John off of him and making sure he lays down on the couch. He does and then passes out a satisfied smile on his face.
“Please tell me you have something sweet to eat, i'm famished after the night I had.” Jade gets up and follows her to the kitchen, where Andrea is opening random cupboards until she finds a container of Oreo's then she sits at the table where Jade is and starts munching on them.
“Uhhg you know what I meant, I worry about you.” John looked down as if he were embarrassed to admit it.
She sighs “of course not, well better get going don't want to keep the cab waiting.” She goes out the door and he thinks about saying he loves her, but feels overall it would be inappropriate. Just because she's his daughter doesn't mean, she loves him. Just thats she mildly obsessed with him and he doesn't want to show that kind of weakness (not to mention jealousy) in front of her. John comes up behind him and wraps his arms around the bigger mans chest in a hug. As appalled by public displays of affection Sherlock is, he knows he needs the comfort and doesn't stop John, as he watches Andrea leave for her first case.
“So, not a client then, I can’t believe you, you weren’t going to tell me about this affair of yours, you know that your actions carry consequences…”
“Well yeah, don’t you? I mean, what is life without a little adventure? Right, nothing, and speaking of adventures, let's play a little game.
“Just a couple of days ago when we chased that identity thief. It didn’t really matter all that much so I just left it.” Sherlock says now, answering his question. John cursed under his breath
“There's a new gallery opening up at this art museum and before they even announced that it was going to open, one of the exhibits got stolen. At first I thought thats boring but then I looked deeper and the painting was locked in a windowless room with the only key, to the steel enforced door, that wasn't touched, is with the manager who obviously didn't steal it. So I thought the thief hid in the painting. But all of them are just that... paintings and it is physically impossible to hide in one of them. And if that wasn't interesting enough the guard in charge of the exhibit was found dead , not on the night of the theft, but three days later in his apartment. But thats not even the best part. No one knows which painting was stolen because it was replaced with an exceptional fake. The only reason they even know its gone is the alarm. And the note on the wall in the room, saying “I stole one of your paintings.””
“Yes, but it didn’t involve a stolen police car or an illegitimate daughter. I don’t know if I can get both of us in a cargo hold on its way to New Zealand,” Sherlock had a sharp tone.
He looks to the back and sees the books “I can’t believe I missed that, so you uh like to read then.” She smiles awkwardly at him “You already knew that.” “Um yeah I did, but I don’t know your favorite book.”
Yes of course i'll take vodka on the rocks.” Andrea replies assessing every move the woman makes. They sit down at the bar and the woman orders 2 Vodka's. Andrea knows this is the time to convince her into bed, without mentioning it so she says. “I'm Andrea.” She holds out her hand and the woman kisses it “Mistress Danella.” The woman answers, nearly making Andrea quiver. Now she knows Danella will sleep with her, and knows that all she's looking for is confirmation that Andrea wants that as well, she doesn't waste her time on girls that don't put out. Andrea grabs Danella's extended hand and kisses it “Yes Mistress”. The woman's lips curl upward in a very sexy smile, the only thing left to do is for Danella to order her to go somewhere with her. Which she almost immediately does after Andrea gets her drink. “Come with me.” She says leaving the table not even looking behind her. Andrea smiles to herself and chugs her drink (can't let perfectly good alcohol go to waste) then follows the woman to a door near the back of the museum, she leads her up a narrow staircase and into a very small room on the left of it.
When she gets out of the shower she puts on loose pants and a sleeved shirt, knowing that it will hide most of the signs about her sexual activity then she goes downstairs to talk to Sherlock. When she gets downstairs she is not at all surprised to see that Sherlock hadn't moved an inch since she went upstairs. She sighs then sits down ready to get this “talk” over with.
“I really should leave though, dad is going to up worrying about me so its best to get home soon.” The other girl shrugs,
“How the hell would I know what happened what ever your thinking its just a realistic hallucination, brought on by excessive amounts of alcohol.”
“ You're a heavy drinker and a criminal but you've only been caught once which is why you need out of the country. You weren’t on the streets for long you got taken in by someone and you still live with whoever that was. You have  online doctorate degrees in psychology, computer programing , computer analyzing, Criminal justice, Foreign language, and possibly, Mathematics, all of which you got just for the hell of it since you already have a job you like .
“Help you? After everything you put me through, I’ve had a lot of time to think about this and I won’t, even though I …” He stomped out of the alley and muttered under his breath “love you.” His date followed him out of the alley after giving Sherlock an apologetic glance.
She's always known he was the overprotective type, so he most likely stayed up waiting for her, something she knew he would have to stop if he was going to survive her staying there. Sure enough when she got through the door there he was sitting on the table reading, well trying to read.
“Sherlock? I just couldn't take it how can I stay with him when I want you? But no no i'm a bad bad person.” John slurred his words and is in a fit of laughter by the end of them. Sherlock puts his hand on Johns and tries to pull him over to the couch.
“Oh I know you can do better than that, beg for it pet.” She says and Andrea obliges completely losing any dominance she could have had.
“I was going to tell you, I was but Moriarty's hitmen had to believe I was dead and I calculated the risks of telling you against the benefits and it was just too risky.”
“I just, I lost a friend two years ago, and now i'm on this date trying to get over him, but I still feel like I’m somehow betraying him, you know?” John looked up after this sentence and his mouth was hanging open in shock.
You’ve bookmarked Ashworth University’s sight on your computer, and there are not very many degrees you can get from there and even fewer you would be interested in because you wouldn’t waste your time on useless degrees. You have worn knees, a sore neck you smell like a lot of different perfumes, not to mention the bite and finger nail marks on your neck legs and back, do I really need to say more?
“Don't be jealous. I'm staying at your house now aren't I, if I'd wanted, I could have easily gone back to the house I was practically raised in.”
“Busy.. like hiding your daughter and working on your secret American assignment busy? What else are you hiding from me?”
Then she hangs up and Sherlock comes in. She motions for him to tie her dress in the back and says : “ I knew you were listening.”
“Like you could have raised a 6 year old while you were high off your latest drug.” Sherlock stood up and stormed out of the room, looking very much like a child throwing a temper tantrum.
Taking them into her mouth she nibbles on them softly enough not to leave a mark but hard enough that it hurts in a way that is so good. She teasingly moves down to right below her hole, biting the sensitive part until Andrea is moaning even louder.
She tucked her loose strands of dark hair behind her ear and suddenly looked very young. When he had seen her last she was more professional, a grown adult, now she struck him as a reckless teenager. In her black boots dark eyeliner and short skirt. He couldn’t believe he’d … well that's a thought for another time. She was watching him while he analyzed her.
She just smirked “ That was good, though I wasn’t taken in by a woman and I’m not a heavy drinker.” “There's always one thing, and yes you are you just haven’t admitted it to yourself yet.”
Which he did, to a police car parked at the edge of the grave yard. She got in the passenger side door. Sherlock, without hesitation, jumped in the back. Another girl with shoulder length blue hair and almond colored eyes was in the driver seat and she drove off the instant Sherlock closed the door.
“Just water for me thank you, I don’t know what he’ll be having.” John said gesturing to the chair opposite him without looking up.
“I stole it, obviously, and I was hoping you could tell me where we're going. I mean, I assumed you had a plan.” She answered with that smile that never seemed to leave her face.
“Well, we need to get on the plane there going to be here in about 3 minutes to investigate the explosion, and you know people don’t really like random explosions, for some reason” She enters the jet without looking behind her and he follows her. The driver runs to a different part of the base where a car is parked. She reaches it just as the plane lifts off the ground.
“Oh yeah that.. Well you have a lot more to lose if you tell people about that, I mean you’re his best friend … more than that it looks like actually, and you having slept with me will definitely put a dent in your relationship, not to mention the fact you would get arrested if anyone found about about it. Where is he in the kitchen?”
“When did you start dating guys, I thought you said you weren’t gay.” John looked at him for a moment then he lunged for his throat. They got kicked out of the restaurant and just as they passed the door they saw John's date. He was coming into the restaurant when he saw them and he just looked shocked for a second but then he followed them into the alley way beside the restaurant.
“Of course I will.. oh and tomorrow night is good for me, as long as I don't die on this highly dangerous case.”
The second they get in the room Danella has her pinned up against a wall, and is kissing her hungrily, Andrea responds by lightly biting the other girls lip which earns her a moan.With practiced ease Danella unzips the others dress and it falls to the floor leaving her in only her thong, she takes no time taking it off with her teeth.
“I can assure you that you’re not.” Sherlock said in his normal voice all the regret he was feeling at having left John showing in his eyes.
“Do you really think you could keep anything from me besides he's a nice guy and your not the only one distracted nowadays. “
If you didn’t like your job you wouldn’t be doing it, you have no need to, you’ve obviously spent a lot of time at desks because of the indent on your inner arm, which means typing which means office work but not a reporter you don’t even smell like ink, and you work the phone a lot but not an office phone your own personal cell phone, which means most likely private secretary.
“I know you must have some questions, but before we get into that I just have one question.” John looked at him with a burning hatred.
“You need stitches.” She says matter of factly. John who stood in the doorway during that whole encounter, went over to Sherlock and looked at the wound.
“Um Sherlock... what happened last night?” Sherlock doesn't even look away from the newspaper. “How would I know I was in bed before you got home.” Now John knows that something must have happened, Sherlock never goes to bed before three and even if he did he's always stayed up until John gets home.
“Oh, are you really going to be that way.” She waits for him to reply, when he doesn’t say anything she says “fine I don’t need you to talk to me.” She immediately starts fidgeting with her seat, she can almost taste the silence in the car it's so thick.
He rushed through the deduction with a face that said, even though he was enjoying it, he felt like she was making fun of him.
You’re Sherlock’s daughter? No how can that be we…” She looked at him a humorous gleam in her deep light green eyes that he now realized looked exactly like Sherlock's.
She laughs a little. “Ha are you trying to be a father now? (Sigh) I don’t have a favorite book I like the classics and, science fiction.” He wrinkles his nose
“Per her request as I’m sure she’s told you.” He wasn’t even trying to talk now knowing Sherlock would just interrupt him.
“Yes the painting is beautiful but I was actually talking about you.” The woman turns all the way towards her now and looks her up and down, undressing Andrea with her eyes. The woman doesn't blush which means she is used to compliments and is comfortable in her body (though how could she not be?).
Andrea knows that she is losing the battle for dominance but the way Danella is lightly nipping at her bare inner thigh takes away all the worrying about that. Danella is still fully dressed and as in the way of mistresses she is likely to be for a while.
“Yay! What are we waiting for we need to get back to your apartment, and look at the case files!” She shoves the rest of the cinnamon bun in her mouth and races outside with out waiting for him to follow her, because she knows he will. Sherlock sighs and gets up to follow her. She is standing right outside looking quizzical. When he gets to where she is, she starts walking they walk in silence until she talks.
“Whatever you say.” She smiles knowingly. She ends up falling asleep on Sherlock's shoulder. He looks down at her, hardly believing he could make such an amazing person, or a person at all for that matter. He runs his hand over her hair gently so not to wake her and then he whispers to her sleeping form.
“If your going to be out all hours of the night at least have the decency to call first.” He speaks angrily but he looks completely calm, never taking his eyes off the book... though Andrea suspects he just doesn't want to look at her, afraid he will see much more than he ever wanted to know about her.
Sherlock looked longingly at the door, but knew he couldn't just walk away, he had brought this on himself. “Alright so where was I oh yeah, sex is when one person does something to another person to stimulate them and make them come to a climax.” Sherlock groaned . “Stop that, though it one of the noises that can come about from “sexual intercourse.” Many people * cough * straight people, believe sex is when a man penetrates a woman, but there is so much more that goes into it especially for gay people like me and you, so there are many, many ways to get people off. Oral sex, eating out ,fisting, anal sex, toys you know the normal stuff.”
After she finished recapping the plan she looked pretty proud of herself, that is until Sherlock rebuffed, “Perfectly sound plan, but I think it would be much simpler to just drive to the private landing strip where my brothers jet is waiting and go from there.” He was obviously trying to see what plan she would come up with.
“Fine i’ll just be in my room.” she holds up her hands in defense then leaves the kitchen. “When did you do this?” John asks him concern soaking his now soft voice.
Andrea nods enthusiastically “ Yes Mistress” Danella pouts for a second slipping off her thong and sitting on the chair closest the door her dress pulled up to her waist legs spread apart.
“ Look John I understand that you're upset but London is going to be under attack if you don’t help me.”
“Okay, you couldn’t tell me to protect me, is that what you're saying, or just to protect yourself, because I would have been fine, no much more than fine, if you just told me you weren’t dead, no not even that you just had to give me a sign and I would have waited for you. But noo you were to busy being dead!”
The minute Andrea is done Danella gets off the bed, “So my little pet, do you want to please me?” She asks from acrossed the room.
“Mycroft told you about our childhood. What else did he tell you.” He seemed mad but not mad enough to ignore her again so she said. “Well, he told me all about you when I asked him to, you were kind of an obsession of mine. I had to go to the places you were going to be, I solved the cases alongside you, without you knowing of course, I asked him about every single detail of your life. I had to ask the exact right questions to get even a word out of him, but it was worth it I even met my um your mother.”
“Fine what night would work for you, i've hardly gotten to see you since you moved into my brothers flat.”
“Science fiction, what use is reading about a technological future when we're going be invaded by japan no matter what we write about it.” “Yeah I know it's not exactly what you read when you were a kid, it's not a history of mathematics or anything.” He looked confused for a second “ You know about that?” Andrea looked at him apologetically as realization dawned on him
“Just him Molly Hooper and a handful of my homeless network.” He said counting them off in his head.
She looked almost disappointed for 2 seconds, “ Simpler maybe, but my plan was more fun, yours is just boring.”
Andrea walks into the room, “Hey dad, i'm gonna...” she trails off seeing the compromising position he is in. John stops trying to take Sherlock's shirt off and Sherlock sees this as his chance to escape. Which he does pushing the other man off and running out the door without looking back. Seconds later they hear the front door open and slam shut.
“Okay I guess,” She said rubbing the back of her neck, then she looked around her in realization ”wait are we landed?”
“Its not a (sigh) …, that among other reasons.” Once again realizing that arguing against Andrea is a lost cause, he stops denying and diverts the conversation.
As John Watson walked away from Sherlock’s grave, tears forming in his eyes, a mysterious hooded figure passed him and walked to the grave. The figure steps up to the fresh grave site and sets flowers at its foot, then kneels for a second before standing up and removing their hood. A bundle of soft brown curls fall out, framing a woman's slender face. She glances at the grave with sharp green eyes and looks around, smiling to herself. “Why is there a strange girl who you’ve never seen before standing at your grave sight? The best thing to do here, I think, is to tell you a story. Once upon a time there was a girl named Amber Nathan, who fell for a young boy named William Holmes. William knew Amber had to go to Germany for a secretary job, and even though he was much younger than the girl, she thought he really wanted to be with her. She thought he would even go with her to Germany. Everything was going smoothly until she found out that their whole relationship was a lie. He was just using her.”
“Please Mistress Danella let me please you?” She gets down on her knees and kneels in front of the other girl, waiting for the command.
Andrea thinks then says “Was it really that obvious, I guess I’ll have try harder to hide all that, except maybe you should think about where you’ve seen me before, I am only letting you see these things about me I could hide it as easily as someone could hide a tattoo on their back.”
She laughs this time. “I'm 18 dad, and i'm pretty sure I already know all of the things you would tell me, and a lot you wouldn't know , seriously I should be giving you the sex talk.”
Sherlock left John’s room and went down to the kitchen to get his morning tea. John got up shortly after that and went outside to check the mail as is their usual morning routine. When he got back up his entire atmosphere had changed, when he went to get the mail he was smiling and cheery, when he got back the smile was still on his face but it was obviously fake now, and he was waiting to ask Sherlock a question. Sherlock could tell from the way his mouth almost opened and the way his eyes kept going from the stack of mail to him. Obviously something in the mail had upset him in a jealous sort of way and it made Sherlock curious, but he knew John would spit it out as soon as he couldn’t help his curiosity, so he waited patiently while John tried to control his features.
She puts down the book “Mycroft keeps a stack of books in the last two seats for me, I get terribly bored on these trips.”
They go over to Andrea and start discussing and planning out how to solve the case. Ultimately they decide to send Andrea to the Exhibit when it opens (not that Sherlock had much decision in the matter, when Andrea wants something she gets it.) She is getting dressed in a bright red strapless dress when her phone rings. Sherlock is within hearing range of the door and so hears Andrea's side of the conversation. She picks it up and talks into it
He looked mad for a second but then he just nodded like he accepted the fact that everyone in his family met his daughter before he did. “You did, what was that like?” She looked down and started messing with the strings on her hoodie
He thought, then realized it didn’t matter why, he had to get the door, he still had to do it. So he got up and opened the door. The girl that was standing on the other side wasn’t, what he had expected, he knew this girl.
Andrea goes in to the giant art museum still extremely exited, thought not showing it. The first thing on her to do list, figure out which painting is a fake. She goes from painting to painting examining them. When she finds nothing out of place she starts to go around again.
You're not someone that would think to steal when you have a nice setup like you do so the only reason you would steal is for revenge, and the most likely thing you want revenge on is the government of the three countries that made your life suck, at least at first you stole for revenge but then you just stole for the rush. If you didn’t have abandonment issues you never would have come to me, you could have escaped the country on your own you proved as much when you told me the plan you had, you saw your opportunity to need me and you took it you’ve probably been looking for such an opportunity and was ecstatic when you read about my death and were sent to prison because it gave you the perfect excuse.
“Oh, um” Sherlock looked very uncomfortable all of the sudden. She laughed at his attempt at feelings.
“As if i'd ever discuss your secrets! I'm shocked utterly shocked. Actually I wouldn't miss the look on his face for the world.” She laughs and picks up a silver necklace from the table, before placing it around her neck and Sherlock fastens it. Then she lets her softly curled and half pinned hair fall down,reaching nearly to the bottom of her mostly bare back. She admires herself in the mirror before turning to face him.
Andrea hurries upstairs and says she's gonna take a nap and John gets home. He goes into the bedroom to get out of his work clothes and he see's the note on Sherlock's computer. His face flushes a bright red and he thinks,
When John wakes up he knows something is different. He's still in last nights clothes and he's lying on the couch instead of his bed but its not that... its something else. He tries to remember what happened last night but its all a blur after breaking up with Mark. He starts to get some fuzzy images just as Sherlock comes into the room he seems different too. He looks the same, blue bath robe perfect curly hair and newspaper curled up under his arm. “ There are eggs on the stove.” he says before sitting down in his chair and starting to read his newspaper. John tries to sit up but a massive headache pulls him right back down. He gets up after a second and makes himself a cup of coffee skipping the eggs. Then he sits back down on the couch sips the coffee and tries to remember last night.
“It's okay Sherlock i've been thinking about it too and you just make me so...” he trails off rushing up to Sherlock and kissing him roughly putting his hand underneath the bigger mans shirt. Sherlock is mentally freaking out but frozen in his spot as John runs his hands over his bare back and chest, probing the other mans, mouth with his tongue trying to get a reaction from him. When that doesn't work he assumes the other guy is just expecting more from him. So he puts his hands in the back of the other man's pants grabbing his bare ass in both hands, this makes Sherlock squeal and fall backwards on the bed. Which John ,once again blinded by his hormones, thinks this is Sherlock finally reacting to his touch so he kisses him harder laying on top of the other man. Sherlock is moving this time, but he doesn't realize he is trying to push the smaller man off.
“Yeah right let me help pleeeeeasssee. If you don't you know i'll just find a way to get in on the case without your permission.” He pretends to think about it for a moment before sighing in defeat knowing she's right.
Since that morning John has been overjoyed, even though Sherlock wants to keep it a secret ( can’t have anyone knowing I am susceptible to that kind of thing, there would be riots in the street) they decided to not be in a relationship exactly, well Sherlock has just decided not to call it that, but they are doing all the relationship things Sherlock is even sleeping in John's bed.
“Oh okay Jay jay I know you're busy, just call me later okay?” Jade nods and Andrea leaves puzzling over the whole interaction. She shoves it down to puzzle over later, because now she has to deal with Sherlock.
Then feeling that teasing is the best thing to do, she backs out slightly, but Danella does not like that shoving her head back down roughly grabbing fistfulls of her hair.So Andrea hits the sensitive spot as hard as she can with her tongue pushing it quickly then backing off push and back-off she pounds the spot with all the energy she has and is very pleased when her mistress starts to grind her face, her moans getting louder until finally the sweet, warm cum, oozes out of her.
“ I didn’t tell her that she was my grandmother, since that's what you're worried about. No Mycroft canceled his day out with her when she was in town and said he felt bad about it so his assistant, me, would show her some sights in London with my all clearance pass. Well it was pretty good and she is really amazing I don’t even think you realize how much she sacrificed for you but I guess that's just what having kids is about, and after a couple times of taking her around sight seeing, she, she said I was like the daughter she never had, that was the only time I’ve ever cried in front of someone.”
“That was long after the drunken mistake he made which resulted in her losing her job and raising a baby on the streets of Germany. She had to catch a cargo lift to America and stayed there for 3 years before finally making it back to London, where she was almost immediately murdered for some easy cash, leaving a 6 year old genius on the streets. So, really, I should be here to dance on your grave and throw a party to celebrate the man who accidentally brought me into the world just to ruin it for me. But I've realized something over the last 10 years. Why should you care about how my mother felt? Being used like that. It's not like it was you getting used. It's not like she even really mattered, not to you. She was just a pawn in the big scheme of things, and people are expendable. We are the only ones that matter. What are normal people other than objects for our use? But that's not exactly the reason why I’m here. I need to get out of the country, and I only have about three hours to do it, so you can come out from behind that tree now.”
