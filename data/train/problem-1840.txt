“Bit my tongue.” Sherlock tries to keep his voice on an even keel, schooling his expression into a bored sort of disaffectedness. “Nightmare.”
Sherlock nips at John’s earlobe, presses his tongue against the soft flesh, and then traces the cartilage all the way up and around. It’s salty with an undertone of shampoo.
“We’ll have to try that sometime. Tonight I have other ideas” John palms Sherlock’s ass and pulls him tighter against him.
Sherlock quivers with the barely contained desire to press against John. “Your hair used to smell like sandalwood. I liked that.”
John’s fingers toy with the ends of Sherlock’s curls, tugging lightly. Pleasure sparks through Sherlock’s brain, flash bangs going off, whiting out everything that doesn’t have to do with here and now and John. Sherlock feels thoroughly dismantled, as though with every swipe of his tongue John is unscrewing a part of him, laying it aside with the unspoken promise of putting him back together once this is through. John licks his way into Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock responds enthusiastically, pawing at the hem of John’s shirt, tugging it over his head and throwing it onto the kitchen tile.
John sways on his feet, not quite leaning back against the countertop, but not leaning into Sherlock’s tall frame.
“Yes you do,” John says, but his hand is back in Sherlock’s hair, not smoothing anything now, but simply carding through, blunt fingernails trailing against Sherlock’s scalp. “I’ve always been bloody jealous of your hair.”
“Sherlock?” The voice is closer this time. John is coming down the hall towards Sherlock’s room. Heavy footfalls pause outside of the bathroom door. John has heard the faucet. Sherlock tries to deduce what John will do next, but it’s like grasping at smoke. Frustrated, he buries his face against his folded knees.
Sherlock is quiet for a moment. He blinks rapidly, looking down fixedly at the wood grain of the floorboards. Yes, of course it’s alright, he thinks. He has spent many a night since John’s return to Baker Street sitting on this very couch wishing that John would come over and wrap his arms around him. They used to have moments like this, before Barts. Before Mary. Sherlock relaxing supine across the couch, John joining him, lifting Sherlock’s feet into his lap to make room for himself as he switched on his mindless science fiction shows, resting a calloused warm hand against Sherlock’s slender ankles. Once, after a case in the dead of winter, when Sherlock plummeted into the ice cold murky Thames while dodging a knife attack, John had brought him home and curled up with him under a blanket on the floor next to the fireplace, pressed up against Sherlock beneath the thin excuse of warming him up. “Your body heat. It’s good.” Sherlock had said through chattering teeth. In response to this, John had pressed his face into Sherlock’s neck and hummed quietly. Sherlock remembered how John’s hair had smelled of sandalwood and the crisp winter air. Sherlock had smelled of the fishy miserable Thames, but John had not seemed to care. They had broken apart after what felt like hours only so that Sherlock could disappear into the shower and rub the silt from his skin. It had been two weeks before Sherlock was forced to throw himself off of the roof of Barts and disappear. When he was in Serbia Sherlock had thought of that night a thousand times over, had agonized and fantasized over what might have happened if he had just turned to face John and taken whatever he was clearly ready to give.
John gave a weak smile; his hand hesitantly hovering near, as if he still felt he needed to ask for permission to feel the child’s kicks even after all the places those hands had been on her before her pregnancy.
“Out with it, John” Sherlock mumbled, lips barely moving as she narrowed her all seeing gaze into the microscope in front of her
“It was only a matter of time before your impulsive and irresponsible behavior had life altering consequences…There is no simple solution to this” he waved his hand in her direction, specifically, her stomach
She leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms. Wasn’t what she was expecting, a personal question perhaps, something involving her love life, or lack there of, sexual history and such, but to bring up Donovan at a time like this…
“People do little else” she replied, and a crazed smile, like many of the ones they shared during inappropriate times, split across her face, and they both burst out in maddening giggles that had no place in the situation they were in
After that incident, it seemed to become almost a regular occurrence, happening practically any time she was pressed against him, she left the shower, arrived at Buckingham palace wrapped in only a sheet that her damned brother stepped on and gave John that most wonderful and totally inappropriate view of her backside, or any other time he caught a glimpse of too much skin, as if his body could no longer determine the difference between Sherlock and any other woman. She wasn’t some average girl someone could just pick up off the street and invite to dinner; she was Sherlock, untouchable, unmovable, a force of nature Sherlock Holmes.
People never spared them a second glance when her head was rested on his shoulder or his arm wrapped possessively around her slim waist. No one would ever think them to be one of the most dangerous duos in all of England; a genius detective and her solider/doctor guardian.
The name written on the band around the child’s wrist was bold and proud, a constant proof that this was real, he was real, the baby held in John’s strong arms was his
The rumor that pregnant women gave out a light of their own was proving to not be as false as she once had thought. It seemed the rush of extra estragon was doing wonders for her complexion; she no longer looked like she was on the verge of fainting, but had her own healthy glow, though John, for all his good traits, was about as observant as a doorknob, and hadn’t seemed to pick up on the subtle changes in her.
“Nice to meet you, Sherlock, I’m April” his date cheerfully introduced herself, and Sherlock merely cracked an eye open, flickering it over the woman’s figure before closing it again and muttering “Married”
“W-what? Y-you can’t honestly believe I’m a cheater?!” April stuttered out, and a smirk broke across the detective’s face
Those words hadn’t made as much sense to him back then. While worrying for your younger sibling was always something he could relate to, even Sherlock running around and jumping off rooftops didn’t seem to faze him. She could take care of herself, at least physically, able to take down a man twice her size unarmed with her fighting skills alone.
“Sherlock…?” He asked cautiously, taking note that she hadn’t brother to remove her coat as he pulled off one of his jumpers
In all honesty, he expected her to roll off to the side and demand he get out of her bed once they finished. He was already gathering the required energy into aching muscles to do so
Of course everything with and about Sherlock could never be measured by normal standards, it was new and surreal and -Jesus fucking Christ- BRILLANT
His mouth was everywhere as his fingers fumbled with the buttons of her shirt, stopping briefly at each one as if asking for permission to undo the next. She didn’t stop him, rather, encouraged him by doing the same, and soon his mouth crashed against hers in another heated kiss once the buttons were all undone and his hands made their way over her bare stomach, over her bra, and finally pushing the plain fabric up to pinch lightly at her nipples
It's an end of an era, I'm sad to see it be over, but I'm glad y'all followed it til the end, even when I dropped off the face of the earth for all that time after my accident
“Love like this only comes once in a life time, Sherlock.” She countered, “Now quiet down! This matters to John”
The human mind was a strange thing, especially someone like Sherlock’s. Even as her eyes glazed over, her body heating to the point of fever, her knees nearly knocking together, her mind still rattled off deductions, still observed every inch of skin her fingertips explored
The boiling of the kettle broke his thoughts, and he poured some of the water into a heat pack, making sure the temperature was fine before wrapping it in a thin washcloth
There were many different Sherlock’s she’d play, Victim Sherlock, Timid Sherlock, Angry Sherlock, Ditzy Sherlock, Bitchy Sherlock, Carefree Sherlock, Serious Sherlock, Flirtatious Sherlock, Drunk Sherlock, Crazed Sherlock, Cheating Sherlock, Devoted Wife Sherlock, and Sweet and Innocent Sherlock. He was inclined to prefer the latter two, for obvious reasons, she played the roll so well, slipping it on like a second skin he could almost believe she wasn’t the mad genius she was
“I work out plenty” he said, with a shake of his head “Now, get off Sherlock, I gotta piss” he lied evenly
“Four in total. Three men, one woman; and she’s the ring leader.” He titled his head just slightly “Um…They’re all big, very big, taller than you, Mother, but she’s just as short as Papa” he gave a vague wave towards John and the doctor felt his cheeks pink at being called short by his own son “They’re close, closer than people normally are, since they haven’t been caught yet and they follow all her instructions. I want to say siblings, but… It doesn’t feel right”
“No, Sherlock” John caught her hands as they frantically begun removing his tie, already undoing three buttons of the shirt underneath
“Mycroft, maybe you should wait outside” John suggested, using his free left hand to wipe at Sherlock’s brow and neck with a towel
“What did you see in him?” he asked, confused. Not that he fancied himself anything special, but Sherlock had always expressed her distaste for anyone even slightly dim, and the idea of her dating someone who was actually sulking about being less intelligent than her…
She took a few deep breaths, trying to understand the burning in her stomach that ran under her skin and seemed to be everywhere at once, rushing through her veins and tingling her fingertips
Looking in the mirror, he was surprised by how well the color complimented his skin, his eyes, his hair, his whole person, something in that shade was hardly anything he would have bought from himself, but he could hardly expect his fashion sense to compare to a girl who treated London like her own personal catwalk
He smiled, shoving his keys, mobile, and wallet into his pocket before happily padding down the stairs
“No!” she almost shouted, before regaining her calm in the blink of an eye “No, of course not, don’t be ridiculous” she said, folding her hands under her chin, quickly running her right ring finger over the stone on her left
“You have found yourself in quiet the predicament, dear sister” he started, the handle of his umbrella gripped tighter than usual in his hand, the only tell sign of his emotions
I no longer write for this fandom so sorry to see y'all move on to different authors, I hope you enjoyed my work
Her voice was solid, and the air grew still, Lestrade and Ms. Hudson looking around awkwardly, and Mycroft’s face was not surprised, like he expected this issue to come up just as much as his sister.
Little thing as it was, it worked to reassure her, him, them both, that they were fine, they would be just fine
This case, like so many others, led them into a sticky situation where both their lives were at stake. Nothing new, nothing he couldn’t handle
It was as if Sherlock, as amazing and beautiful as she was to see before, had let go of a mask he hadn’t realized was there in the first place, and she was letting him see her just a little bit better
“To anyone’s eye, you’re ordinary.” She explained, her fingers connecting and doing there usual pose under her chin “You blend into the crowd, average intelligence, moderately attractive, neither tall nor too short, dirty blonde hair and dark blue eyes. People don’t notice you, even I, who could deduce your return to London and how you’d spent your years away, was still taken aback at the depths of your complexity. Even now you still manage to surprise me, something so very few can do.” She sighed again “My family is incapable of thinking beyond what they see” she gestured one hand towards him without turning to face him “Ordinary John Watson. The man Sherlock Holmes ‘settles’ for”
“By today if all goes well” Mycroft replied, craning his neck just slightly towards his nephew, a subtle gesture, as if he was afraid to be caught being curious about his own flesh and blood.
“Being a doctor, you must help a lot of people,” She said, in her Irish drawl, twirling a strand of curly black hair in one pale finger
It made sense, in a way. It wasn’t something serious, he wasn’t sure it meant anything at all to her outside of fulfilling the sudden and strong libido she seemed to develop, and it didn’t brand either of them as taken, they weren’t exclusive, so why make it public?
He just traced her hips with his thumbs in odd, repetitive patterns and watching her with his dark blue eyes that looked almost black in the lack of lighting, and it was one of those rare moments, were he looked completely focused, as if he could see more than her. She’d only witnessed the look a few times before, when they were in danger and the only solution was the steadying of his hand on his gun, read to fire the second it was necessary
Let it be known the writer of this story is just as tall as Benedict Cumberbatch, and yes, I AM a girl, thank you very much. 183cm, exactly 6ft tall.
With that, Sherlock turned, not bothering to pay any mind as she went for the exist, what appeared to everyone as normal and controlled was slightly hurried, her pace quicker than usual
What could they possibly know? Their brains weren’t a constant rush of restless energy; they didn’t need to be occupied every waking hour just to prevent themselves from slowly rotting away. She couldn’t just drop her life to make a home and breastfeed an infant, and the domesticity John craved was something she could never offer him
John reached into his jean pocket and did the same, replacing the silver band on his left hand before running his right hand through his hair, messing up the spikes there as the gel pulled apart
Okay so I recently picked up all my old fanfics I abanaded back in 2014, but literally like.. none of it is Sherlock, it's all nerd shit like Harvest Moon, Teen Titans, AtLA, and Naruto, if any of y'all wanna read them, I posted a few here and the rest are on my old FF account, I go by FFK there, too, since it's like my brand I can't get rid of, even tho I've moved onto a different handle (StonerBrujx or just Brujx)
He ran his hands through his hair, frustrated in more ways than one, his erection half flagged and his anatomy feeling particularly heavy
She never voiced her appreciation, but it must have been obvious at that point, even John couldn’t be dense enough to assume that she would behave the way she does around him to just anyone.
But she couldn’t argue that he wasn’t right. John would love any child of his, regardless of the mother to whom it was born or the circumstances in which it was conceived, dangerous sentiment that tied Sherlock’s hands and decided her fate the second that damn stick turned positive
John woke up from a familiar feeling; feminine fingers running their way down his chest and stomach, the lazy caresses of the after sex morning, sometimes leading to more, sometimes just a good snogging session
Sherlock remained lying; and tried not to think about how the women were looking more and more like her
He turned his head, denying her the kiss she moved to seek, and pushed her back; harder than he intended in his drunken haze, and she stumbled a bit, surprise on her face for a fraction of a second before she controlled her expression
Sure, she’d make a show of how put upon she was whenever John forced her to eat something on a case before she passed out or chided her for doing something particularly dangerous, but if she were to be completely honest with herself (and she always made an effort to be brutally so) she’d admit that it was a nice change of pace to have someone worry about her just because they enjoyed her company
“We were barely speaking, Sherlock…” He replied softly, hunching his shoulders slightly as if embarrassed
Chapter two has been updated to include a drawing of Sherlock in John's pants and a vest top, if anyone wanted to see it
Instantly waking up, he instinctually reached up, his hands gripping roughly into the fabric of his attackers sleeve, hunching forward and sending the surprisingly light stranger’s body over his good shoulder in a move he’d practiced dozens of times before
John took a hesitant step forward, but when she didn’t move to acknowledge it, he crossed the room, taking a seat at the corner of the table near her microscope, careful not to sit on anything
John didn’t bother to speak, or even ask how the man knew in the first place when he and Sherlock went out of there way to hide their little encounters, keeping them strictly out of view of CCTV cameras and displaying no added affection in their daily routine
“The Theatre! Brilliant, just brilliant, John!” she cheered, all but leaving him in the dust as she hurried inside, and he couldn’t help the smile that overran his face at the sight of her giddy grin and overall ecstatic behavior.
“We still have to send out all the inventions, there are a lot of people we need to text, write, phone” John said as he hurried along her side, trying to keep up with her brutal pace as she took advantage of her seemingly endless legs to go much faster than a casual walk for him
But to his surprise, she shifted, moving down a little on the bed until her feet threatened to hang off so she could rest her head on his chest, already wild curls looking more like a lion’s mane
Once again, she looked down at the little stick in her hand, reading it’s plus sign over and over again, it wasn’t that she didn’t believe it, of course she was pregnant, that much was so obvious she may as well be wearing a neon sign. What she didn’t understand was the fluttering in her stomach that had nothing to do with the baby currently forming, or the racing of her heart, the sweat building in her palms, and the restless energy she never felt during a case as interesting as the current one Lestrade had presented her with
Strangely enough, though, Sherlock never said anything. She would continue on, not correcting a single assumption made about the two of them, and he wondered if she truly couldn’t care what people thought, or if she couldn’t be bothered to correct the rumors because she knew John would get to it
“I assume he convinced them that any stress on my part can result in complications to their grandchild, I doubt they would risk any danger to what will more than likely be their only one”
They stood; face-to-face, cramped into the tight confides of the dusty old wardrobe, hiding out from god knows what as Sherlock’s slender fingers covered his lips, effectively silencing his question before it was asked
She was graceful, rarely ever caught with her foot in her mouth, and even if she was, she’d talk her way around it like it was entirely normal
John flinched, glancing back over his shoulder where Sherlock stood, her arms crossed and a glare, an actual glare, cutting through him, he felt it like a slap across his face, a physical force that hit him, the obvious disappointment and plain anger directed at him were so thick in the air that everyone was starting to look uncomfortable
“Had what, exactly?” she asked, her head resting on his good shoulder, feeling his heartbeat against her ear and drumming it softly against the curve of his neck with the hand that wasn’t in his
He could tell she was affected, however, regardless of what she tried to let other’s believe, even with a face of indifference and a tone as steady as stone, John could see it in the slight stiffness in her stride, feel it in the tension during the cab ride home, hear it as she slammed the front door shut, so loudly Ms. Hudson came out, fusing, which Sherlock ignored as she climbed the 17 steps up to their flat two at a time
“Harriet, I presume. John was certain you wouldn’t come” Sherlock said, noticing how the woman was dying for a drink but holding herself back, probably because of the wedding and visit with her estranged brother
I have a daughter, that's my only excuse for not updating more often, especially considering I finished this story like two years ago and just don't update? Idk, I forget tbh, I only remembered cause someone commented recently
I'll try updating in another day or two, but I'm gonna be getting a lil busy the next few days, so.. can't make any promises
fellow looked – it was straight back to the bedroom for me. Via the landing; a little rug-burn was worth his satisfied look as he staked his claim on me once more.
“Lieutenant Anderson's house in the country, in west Norfolk”, he said. “I suspect that we may find the mysterious Lieutenant Addleford there too.”
– and last child, young Stafford, after which his wife had made clear that she considered his lineage to have been sufficiently well-established. So that had been an eighteenth time (two sets of twins, on each of which occasion he had been four times as damn horny!) when he he had come round to work off his post-christening angst, and had reduced me to a happy pile of goo. I could still of course meet him at the door wearing the Panama hat which let him know I was his however he wanted it, but I had sort of been a bit regretful. On the other hand I had been fifty-five while he, damnably unfairly, had only just turned forty. We were neither of us getting any younger.
I smiled at the praise, but my limbs were leaden as he too me into the bathroom and eased me under the shower. Had he not been supporting me I might well have collapsed but the refreshing spray coupled with his tender ministrations as he kissed his way around my body made me feel a little stronger and when he ran his tongue up the underside of my cock, it actually managed to become almost fully erect again. Sherlock eased in behind me and slipped inside of me, not pushing for an orgasm this time but content to make us one somehow recharging me just by his presence. I leaned against the wall for support, and the movement caused him to brush against my prostate and come forcibly. My cock twitched, but that was all. I was done.
I was sure that the manufacturers of this vehicle back in the United States could have seen my blush. But this thing was
The young fellow sat in the famous fireside chair at 221B was my nephew, Mr. Aaron Frensberg. A Jewish gentleman, he had married Mycroft's third daughter Elizabeth back in 1893 and they had since had three sons. Of her sisters only Charlotte, now divorced from Mr. Leonard and apparently increasingly desperate for any man, was still in contact with her disgraced father while the others had all happily accepted the silent and brilliant Mr. Blaze Trevelyan as their new stepfather. John, being John, had quipped that Charlotte was only maintaining her relationship with her father for money (he had treated her the one time, during the terrible Veiled Lodger case in 1896). He was as bad as ever.
“No”, he said, “Mr. Cumberbatch. The police van taking him to the station was held up by a dozen armed men and he was dragged out and shot. There were only three officers and all unarmed, so they could not stop them. They were lucky that they did not get shot too.”
“Carl as he is now had a problem with his blood or something”, our visitor said. “He contacted Cal and because it was possibly life-threatening he sent to me to ask if I was all right with the boy knowing the truth. Of course I said yes; you have to put family first.”
“This 'dig' that Miss Wolferton is on”, Sherlock said. “I do not suppose that either of you happen to know when it is concluding?”
1904. With just months to go before their retirement, Sherlock and John travel to Shropshire to investigate some risqué photographs and a hair-raising disappearance – but who needs rescuing from whom?
“Not really”, our visitor admitted, “even though he says that if I do then he will 'bump' me to Commander early, which would boost my pension a lot. The problem is my boy Odin – I should not call him that now he is into his twenties – who will be going up for promotion to sergeant when a vacancy arises at that level in a few months' time. If he succeeds you know full well what everyone will say.”
It was only as I lay there on the seventh day that something occurred to me. I turned carefully to the sex-maniac next to me and ran a finger through his thick stubble (shaving had been a low priority as of late for some reason).
It was one of those odd coincidences that this case happened just after I had received a note from my friend Brendon, the former molly-man who had gone to the Far North of Scotland to oversee the estates of his half-nephew Edmund Duke of Cromartyshire. That had resulted in establishing a relationship between Brendon and Aedh Campbell, the twin brother of the now-duchess, and the two men had marked the twentieth anniversary of their first, rather stormy meeting (a year before I had met them in Scotland) by having two weeks in the Lake District at the Selkirk twins’ guest-house. I was sure that Brendon was just boasting when he mentioned some of the things that they had done there both on their own and with the boys and their guests Mr. Baker and Mr. Poncherello, but still, I decided that I had better make sure that they had not been just boasting by testing out as many as I could on John.
Despite his dreadful behaviour over the years Mr. Mycroft Holmes had somehow convinced himself that he should still have inherited everything, so after getting barely two per cent of the estate there had all too inevitably been an argument and Sherlock had returned ruffled and upset. I had had to let him have his way with me for twenty-four hours to make him feel better. Honestly, the things that I put up with for that man!
1915. Everyone makes their contribution to the war effort, and John also very generously makes a contribution towards testing a new chocolate selection. But death rains down from on high and only the intervention of a distant sibling enables John's brother Stephen to avoid it on the tracks.
1903. Poor John Watson. Trust history to repeat itself in the worst way possible as he and Sherlock travel back to Cornwall and go beyond the end of the line.
“Then we must prevent her from so doing”, I said firmly. “Has my grandson returned to the country yet?”
We stopped at Wellington Barracks again on the way back to tell Sergeant-Major Jones what we had done and intended to do, and promised to keep him informed until matters were finally resolved. We also saw and reassured an anxious Private McCullough. I felt once again that those in the lower reaches of our armed forces were in some ways far better human beings that those in the upper ones.
“That sort of thing happens in the barracks, sirs”, he said, “and I have no mind to it provided it does not interfere in what happens on the battlefield. McCullough, the fellow Ruth did for 'Sir Come-Scribe', he is one and the other fellows accept that; they know he would always have their backs in the field. What they do and who they do it with is their business providing it is not done in my time or affects their jobs; they know me well enough that anyone who behaved like that would be shown the door. I could see the general either having a coronary or being tried for his son's murder – perhaps even mine – if he found out. Scott hurried back to the barracks but of course I was there long before him.”
Even with the heater, the water was now getting cold and Sherlock got us out before drying us off with a huge towel. Normally rubbing my naked body against my man's would have had only one outcome but this time we both remained quiet, content to have each other close. Once we were dry he led me out and to the bedroom where he slipped us both under the covers.
He stopped, belatedly catching my horrified expression. He was besides me in a trice, wrapping two strong arms around me and pulling me close until I had stopped shivering.
He smiled cruelly. I knew that he was a good man but even I felt cold at that. Perhaps what he was suggesting was too cruel even for....
“He told Father that someone at one of his clubs had recommended you”, Mr. Wolf sighed, “before he sounded off once too often.”
“Some ladies do drink”, Sherlock said mildly. I remembered our former landlady's pistol and wisely said nothing.
“Why?” I asked with what was obviously fake innocence. “I said that I wanted to teach you the importance of things, and professors do wear mortar-boards.”
“Mr. Gino Scirocco known as 'The Scarecrow', famed for using a tramp-disguise to get close to his victims. Mr. Antonio Hartless known as 'The Tin Man', because he always wears grey. And Mr. Wesley Austin known as 'The Wizard' – because he is so efficient at making dead bodies disappear!”
“I did not see her”, I said, trying not to show my relief. The two washerwomen had clearly conspired to get my friend’s jumper back and spare me whatever embarrassment they thought I was due, and while I could probably never look either of them in the face ever again at least I was in the clear with Sherlock. He examined the item of clothing as if it were a clue to some terrible murder but then just smiled and took it away upstairs. I waited until he was gone before heaving a huge sigh of relief.
“This”, I said, “is my own set of predictions made yesterday. You will see that I foretold Mrs. Bollinger would indeed arrive before me this morning and would warn you not to listen to what I had to say. This was signed and witnessed by both the Stanmore postmaster and his clerk, and you will see that he did me the courtesy of including both the time and date with an official post-office stamp. I do not think I need to tell you, sir, that those are
“Of course we did have a form of that institution before the earl came along”, said Mr. Smuggity-Smugness.
“Mr. LeStrade works Monday to Saturday, from twelve until six”, he said. “He is always very punctual and has no problem with coming in early or staying behind if asked. We are most pleased with him; indeed we have decided that when the next full-time position comes up we shall offer it to him first.”
On Wednesday we had sex in every room in the cottage – he should have known better to challenge me to do It in the airing-cupboard – and after dinner we had sex in the stream out the back which was hilarious as John clearly felt the cold but was determined to take me anyway.
We walked over to the gathering. Close by there was a scarecrow. which I thought rather odd as there appeared to be no crops in its field.
I had thought that we would see out that final year with no more times apart, but in December of our last full year in Baker Street events transpired to cause me to undertake a case while separated from him.
I smiled. At least as she was going all gooey-eyed over some sad-looking soldier in a photograph, she would not be simpering at.....
“We are delighted to help”, Sherlock said. “The young gentleman's mother is indeed an old friend of the doctor's and his father was known to him during his time in Egypt. Now please tell us about this case.”
Moments later we were indeed both coming home (sorry!). I had the blue-eyed bastard back and I was determined never to let go of him again. All was right with my world even if he had been inveigled into some case during our separation and I would have to write it up for him – his handwriting was one of the few that made my own look comparatively legible! I could even endure my brother's and sister-in-law's teasing as long as I had Sherlock. Which I did.
“Not a lady”, Mr. Malone grunted, “and bloody huge. Would probably get a place in a rugby team if she wanted!”
“That is Mozart”, I said. “Technology is so wonderful these days. Next thing they will be making sets to go in automobiles.”
“Because we have to spend this afternoon and evening christening every room in the new cottage, remember!” he grinned, slipping away before I could say anything.
He looked pointedly at me  – I was just about managing to hold back from a whoop of joy – but continued.
I was about to agree when he suddenly pulled me into a kiss, his tongue pushing into my mouth. I was feeling a little weakened as he had scented me after my shower that morning and that always affected me. He pushed me back against the door and continued his assault; I moaned in pleasure then again as I felt his hand working inside my trousers and underpants. Those long fingers of his wrapped around my rapidly-hardening cock and began to jerk me off. I was putty in those hands and only his support kept me from collapsing to the floor as he jerked me towards an orgasm that left me breathless.
Thankfully Father and Mother arrived back before Lion had come round so were we able to explain matters to them. They were of course devastated but agreed that some time away would be beneficial for the poor fellow.
I had examined all three boys myself but had not been able to make hide nor hair as to what was wrong with them. It was curious, I thought, that Lord Harry's two daughters had not caught whatever it was and I also quickly sensed that Peter had something to say to me that he did not want our host to overhear. But it was not until we took a walk around the estate before dinner that he unburdened himself to me. And then some!
Young Mr. McCall shook at that but, I noted, did not look surprised. His friend moved round to sit next to him and wrapped a hairy arm around him, pulling him close.
1905. It is said that no Heaven on Earth is perfect – but arrangements can be made to make it closer.
All right, the long session of manly embracing did make up for it a little. And Sherlock bought me a new type of nougat-confection called 'Toblerone' whose delicious little triangles I may have had more than a few off – I was testing them out, and I was sure that there had not been six blocks of the things as Sherlock had claimed. So we manfully embraced and he very loudly did not say The Word That Started With The Third Letter Of The Alphabet And Rhymed With Huddling.
Two virulently unpleasant individuals who failed to get Sherlock to find her late relative's wealth (he actually did find it but chose not to tell them) and were reduced to living in a small town house, or a hovel as Mrs. Huffington-Brand called it. They were arguing after while walking off the Leven Viaduct after a train derailment in 1903 and as a result were the only people still on the viaduct when a strong wind came up and blew them to their deaths. Sad.
“Oh?” he said. “So this article in a society magazine about two elderly gentlemen, one a retired public servant and the other ex-military, both incapacitated through, and I quite, 'too much exercise for those of their age?”
“It it easy money and lots of it just for standing there in some daft get-up”, he said. “Some of the artists mind, they can be.... well. One woman offered to help arrange my position and I knew full well what she meant, the hussy! Torry laughed so when I told him, bastard that he is! If I do get to be a doctor I suppose that I shall have to give this up.”
Finally the two of us went out into the now dark garden. Chuffingden lay quiet and undisturbed far below, slumbering under a night-blue sky from which all the clouds seemed to have fled. I looked at my love and smiled at him as we said goodbye to our home for the last time, and moved towards our future. Together, forever and always, Sherlock and John.
“Sherlock…” He half whispered, half moaned, a hint of disbelief in his voice like he couldn’t wrap his mind around what was happening
Ms. Hudson picked up on it immediately, and carefully hurried to his side, offering Junior up with a slight extending of her arms
When they arrived, Sherlock’s leg was all but a blur with how fast it was twitching, the nervous energy and twitching had him thinking that she was able to tell exactly where they stopped at, though, nothing could actually prepare him for her reaction once they were out of the cab on onto the street in front of the theatre
Yet what could he say, what could he possibly do? The red dots from snipers bounced and played across the expands of his body, threatening death with every slight movement, telling him to keep quiet, to let the geniuses talk
Then raised the question on whether or not she should keep it. Surely, someone in her situation wasn’t fit to raise a child, and if she went through with the pregnancy, John would never let her drop it off at Mycroft’s and let him deal with it. But, on the other hand, she was healthy, and carried desirable traits that would best be passed down to the next generation
As would be in the future, she seemed to be moving a thousand miles a second, already deciding to move on in the conversation and it felt so much like being lost at sea, swept away where all he could do is nod and listen to her with an awestruck expression as she offer him an address
“No, you were flirting, and I’d prefer if you did it else where. I can’t concentrate with all Donovan’s faked laughter” she responded
Sherlock didn’t move from where she had sprawled out across the bed, fingers pressed together under her chin, the sides of the pillow cradling her head, working like makeshift earplugs to drown out the happy mumblings of her family beyond the bedroom doors
“There were plenty of other women interested in Victor, and my physical appeal only went so far. The difference in intelligence was rather vast, something he was prone to sulk about; as if it was my fault he wasn’t particularly bright”
“Irene Adler. It’s been weighing on your mind for quite some time, but you never asked in fear of crossing some nonexistent line” she said, before raising an eyebrow “Or perhaps you’re hesitant because I’m a woman”
“It is not something I wish to discuss” she finally replied, her fingers leaving her work to quickly roll down the sleeves of her shirt, fumbling just slightly in her hurry
And though she didn’t care for what others thought of her, the whispers that followed among the officers whenever she entered the Yard made her jaw set tight, and her fingers curl into fists
As if by checking, one day he’d notice its absence and leave, free of the tiny shackle tying him to her
“Mycroft assigned a tutor to me as a child” she started after a rather long pause, as if debating whether or not to tell him, and he shifted a bit forward in his seat. It was rare of her to discuss her past at all, and he’d be damned if he would miss a single word she uttered. “He had said a proper lady needed fine skills in at least one classical instrument”
Sherlock did what any woman uninterested would do, her hips didn’t stop but her hands covered the strangers, pushing them down in rejection which the bastard took as invite to slide them down to her thighs, and John’s vision blurred with red as he saw him working his fingers up into her shorts
She adjusted her coat sleeve to less irritate the rope burns on her wrists, frowning and shaking her head “Even if you hadn’t come when you did, I would’ve found a way to escape. He was hardly criminal mastermind, John.”
Finally, he withdrew, trying not to shiver at the friction on his overly sensitive cock as she slowly ran her hands up his chest, before resting them on the start of his neck, a satisfied smile on her lips
“Back when I attended the Uni. There was a young man, Victor” her face was one of remembering fond memories, before twisting just as quickly and his heart sunk slightly “It didn’t end well”
“Jesus, Sherlock, is this the only reason we came here, then?”John asked, his orgasmic bliss cut through with her words, his fingers fumbling with the button of his jeans
“Agreed. Papa, Mother would surely make a better teacher than…” He wrinkled his nose, pausing, and looking over the nice looking older man smiling at the front doors “a half blind alcoholic” He deduced, looking up for confirmation and Sherlock smiled down proudly in response
She gave a satisfied hum that soon turned to soft breathing and he realized she, Sherlock Holmes, had found her will to sleep when using him as a pillow
They stepped into the home, and John allowed himself a quick glance around before settling back on the man in front of him, who looked nothing like Sherlock but held some resemblance to Mycroft in his facial features
And there were other cases, like whenever she acted, pretending to have been a robbery victim for Irene, she slipped into the role so flawlessly John’s fingers twitched to hurt the imagery men that harmed her
It felt…smothering to be the same room as the two, like he was looking in on an intimate moment he had no business watching
Mr. Guilford Holmes scowled mightily when he called at the end of breakfast to collect us, muttering something about impossible sex-maniacs. Sherlock just smirked which made things worse, especially as I was still weak on my legs. I tried for a smile but it was too much effort.
“There is the added benefit that he himself will be keeping a lower profile now that people know him for such sophistry”, I said. “Mr. Patterson will of course claim that he is
“You have my sympathies”, the lieutenant said. “I was most alarmed by her forthrightness and I admit that I did lie to her about his passing, if only to get her to go away. Far, far away! But this Miss Woodhouse – you must correct her at once.”
His eldest son and namesake had married last year – just before Stafford's christening which was why I had been in even poorer shape than usual after a double dose of angst on my lover's part – and now they had had their first-born son who, to my great happiness, had been another Luke (it was also the name of the younger Benji's wife's brother, as well as that of my godson out of trap sixteen). Then Bet, who apparently was now trying to kill me, had sent her husband round to me where I had faced the horrible realization that he had twenty children so if they ended up each providing him with twenty grandsons....
That Christmas season was marred by the death of my stepbrother Campbell. He had been ill for much of the year and Alan had taken him of all places to the Scilly Isles, where nearly half a century back I had met Lowen in the terrible Adventure of the Repellent Philanthropist. Sadly the sunshine had failed to work its magic and he had passed five days before the Lord's birthday. I helped Alan arrange for his burial in their local church in Buckinghamshire and made sure that he was all right financially; Campbell had left him everything and thankfully there were no other relatives around to cause difficulties. It was therefore a quiet season for once, and I felt the loss of my stepbrother deeply. He had been a good man and had done much good in the world.
“Consider”, he said. “She is dating Mr. Gerald Brown at the time. Mr. Brown is, despite his over-inflated opinion of himself, unexceptional and might easily be the first to go if the department is reduced in size. So the two of them hatch a plan. First, Miss Ockham dumps Mr. Brown for the more attractive Mr. Leeds. Few would be surprised at such a development; except most probably Mr. Brown himself at the incomprehensible lack of public astonishment to the woman rejecting someone so
“First place I lived at in London; the owner came from that town in the American Mid-West”, he said gruffly. “He did food almost as good as Vi's.”
My twin had asked to see me alone again before our departure, which I supposed was understandable. It was strangely unnerving, the way that he was able to both look so much like me and yet not like me at the same time. I had always eschewed the supernatural but what with one thing and another my innate logic was driving me to the point of accepting it, at least as far as he was concerned.
For a brief moment his words hung in the air and I could feel myself holding my breath. Then Sherlock broke, pulling both boys to him and sobbing his agreement. He had grandchildren, and like me his bloodline would continue after he was gone. What more could any man want?
“Not necessarily”, Sherlock pointed out. “His grandfather Tum-Tum was Albert, but chose his second name to reign as Edward the Seventh. The Duke of York could be Frederick the First, Arthur the First or even George the Sixth.”
“Calm yourself, doctor”, he said. “Constable McLean has arranged for a sergeant to come up from the town police-station and he will be calling in half an hour to take us rather than wait for the first train of the day. We just have time for breakfast.”
During our first full year in the cottage I completed writing up all our remaining cases, and supplied them in a steady stream to both the 'Strand' magazine and my publishers. Neither of them knew our address; all our correspondence went through Mrs. Rockland in Baker Street and it was through her that I received a weekly delivery of what Sherlock laughingly called 'fan mail'. I bore in mind that 'fan' was an abbreviation of fanatic as some of the people who wrote to me.... well, even after all the different varieties of sex that I had experienced with Sherlock I was still shocked!
“I dare say that Mr. West might take exception to the London galleries being full of naked pictures of his beloved”, Sherlock smiled, “even if he has his own alongside them. Although I doubt that the rest of the capital's female population – and, I suspect, a proportion of its male one too – would find it overly objectionable. It has been a pleasure to meet you, sir.”
I tried to process this sudden and impossible turn of events. If he was right then Sherlock had had a son
The gentleman who met us some little time later looked almost ordinary considering how we had first seen him (although I did notice the looser than normal trousers). Sherlock re-introduced us both and I saw the look of horror cross his face.
This was also the year that the militant suffragette movement began to make its presence felt and as I had predicted the public reaction was hostile (I just
Sherlock pulled out a notebook and added the school to the impressively long list of places that we had been banned from. We were so bad!
– child, a son Urre. It was also barely a month until our planned departure date for the cottage on the Downs so I was understandably nervous that the prize of all that se.... serious happiness might still be snatched away from me at the last. Nevertheless I was delighted to see our old friend and to inquire after our godsons, his two eldest boys Tristram and Torre, now both sixteen.
Most of the village. Ned damn well decided to 'celebrate; with a whole load of stuff he'd somehow got hold of from some place in London, thankfully at the start of a weekend we both had off. Which was good – as even by Monday I was barely able to walk!
“This morning a latter arrived at the Hall for Lord Trelawney”, I said, “confirming that his travelling companion for their day in London has managed to get him into the most exclusive molly-house that our capital city can boast, and that all sorts of 'delights' are going to be laid on. I contacted his valet Mr. Hebden and he will 'accidentally' place it in her pile of letters, helped by the fact that the untidy wording on the envelope makes the 'Mr. T.' look like 'Mrs.'. She will see this as an opportunity to catch her husband in the act so to speak, no doubt with her London lawyer present. That she employs the 'services' of that vulture Mr. Terence May does not surprise me in the least; birds of a feather do indeed flock together.”
“Most definitely”, the manager said. “He works in the gentlemen's accessories department close by the front door. That is useful as even here we occasionally get 'difficult' customers. He has assisted them to leave on more than one occasion.”
Galahad had a job offer that same evening. He also had a second offer from Lady Radnor – yes the sixty-one year-old Lady Radnor who was married with five children! – that extended to he and his friend doing a whole set of photographs on condition that Her Ladyship could 'sit in' while the pictures were being taken! As John so rightly said, the nobility these days!
“I suppose that that is understandable”, the giant (in both senses!) said. “Please sir, you cannot tell her!”
“You must visit Lion when he is there and tell him that Father is planning a surprise party for her on that day”, Mr. Holmes said. “Something soppy and romantic because he knows how much she likes that sort of thing, even if he would no doubt consider it a threat to his manliness.”
That summer Mr. Charles Rolls† made the first double-crossing of the English Channel. I remember shuddering when I read that at the mere mention of height, but fortunately some manly embracing soon sorted matters. My fears were proven all too right when Mr. Rolls died not long after in a fall from his plane when his rudder broke at a height of some eighty feet.
where the footmarks are then the mechanism will jam. Except if someone else pulls the lever to open it. That is right at the back of the stage and for safety reasons it cannot be wedged into place but has to be held down.”
“His body-hair”, the sergeant-major amended. “One of the hairiest fellows you ever did see; he takes after his father in that respect. Some time after that, that was when it happened. Pitt, my batman, told me that Scott had suddenly become very keen on surveying, going round the area to create a map of the place and anything of interest. It was not so much that he was not athletic – he always looked a couple of meals away from starvation though his figures were healthy enough – but this keenness to get out and about worried me. So one day I followed him.”
One of the best rooms in the little cottage (after the main bedroom of course!) was the bathroom which was positively luxurious for such a place. While we had been waiting for the transfer of the property Sherlock had with the permission of the seller taken the opportunity to knock through to an adjoining large cupboard, making the bathroom large enough to incorporate a huge iron bath. I do mean huge; the two of us could fit in it easily.
But logic and rationality can do nothing; she will not be told! I need you to find the soldier in question so that she can see what he is like and, more importantly, I can decide if he is good enough for her.”
“My half-nephew has certainly returned to England after some wordly travels”, I said. “You are right; his father was Lord Sheridan Hawke's son Sergei who was the result of a liaison of his with the wife of a Russian visitor to this country. Young Sergei moved to Australia where he married a local lady and had Brencis. I understand that his wife died not long after the birth and he remarried; possibly this new half-nephew of mine and his new stepmother did not get on, which was why he moved first to Canada where he went to school and later to England.”
before that!” Lord Trelawney grinned. “Come on, Tan. There is a comfortable bed up there with your name on it.”
“We need about a week”, Mr. Holmes said thoughtfully. “Is there any familial event coming up any time soon?”
Some days later John and I once more took the train to Rigsby. It was not one of my nephew's days; poor Tantalus had been mortified that time when he had had to try to explain to his mother why he had taken to using a coconut body-rub (because the sheikh used it and he could hardly tell poor Rachael
I shook my head at him and turned back to this 'wireless radio set'. Radios had been around for years and I knew that they served good purpose on the seas in helping ships communicate with each other, especially since the loss of the 'Titanic' had led to shipping companies being belatedly compelled to keep them turned on at all times so they could actually be used when needed (something that the government should have made them do long beforehand if it had had any sense). But a radio in the house to receive 'programmes'? It seemed.... strange.
“Taking your older lover to some secret assignation?” I grinned. Then I saw the feral look on his face and my grin vanished as if it had never been. I had seen many terrifying sights in my time as a soldier, but that look beat them all.
That surprised me. I knew nothing about what went on between men in bed – for one thing this was the bog end of Northumberland, and for another as I said, I just didn't consider it a possibility as far as I was concerned – but he sounded like he was being honest.
He went suddenly very white, so obviously he had got to the bit about the celery. That was bad, although not as bad as the greengages. Wait until he reached the eggplants.....
My brother had with exquisite timing made himself scarce; I so owed him for that. I smiled at my love and waited for him to realize the truth. He squinted at me, looked down at himself, then back at me again. A slow smile creased his gloriously handsome features and he waggled his eyebrows at me in a way that was only going to lead to one thing.
“That'd be Ethelbert, Mr. Cowper”, the station-master said unhesitatingly. “He's local and works the semi-fasts from London as far as Leicester. Goes up and down the line several times a day and always catches the last train to his home just outside Leicester. Works every Sunday – you know how some folks won't do that – then usually takes Tuesday off to make up for it. Sound fellow.”
He bowed to the handsome young gentleman and led the way out, and I knew without even asking that he would not tell me what he had meant by that last remark. I did not pout at that fact.
“That is not a problem”, Sherlock reassured him. “I can arrange through Mr. Tudor at Swordland's to have someone presentably Christian to step in and offer the full amount for an instant sale.”
– release the cock-ring against which King Lyon had been straining all evening. I had thought that the slow-release ones had been bad enough but seriously, they made the things with combination locks now? And I had agreed to this torture!
We only had to wait a short wait for a train at Ongar Station and Lion was visibly nervous the whole time. I could relate, and as the train chuffed towards the capital its slow progress did nothing to ease his worries. At Woodford we were fortunate enough for our compartment to come to a halt opposite a newspaper stand so I stepped out and purchased one. We had only just got underway again when I reached an article that made me gasp.
Our visitors when they arrived were well-dressed ladies both in their mid-twenties, although one was clearly much richer than the other judging from the fineness of her apparel. And also pregnant; four to five months I judged. I wondered as to how they were related.
“I do not think that that would be wise”, I said to her evident astonishment. “You see, you have been supplying these things to her body for some time now and to suddenly remove them might cause all sorts of complications, in the same way people can have bad reactions when they stop taking strong drugs or medicine. You said that she is to leave in two weeks' time?”
“I love you!” he said fiercely. “In two months' time we shall be in our own little country retreat where we can have sex all day and every day!”
I smiled as we finally drew up outside the cottage. The old nameplate with the utterly unimaginative 'Hill Cottage' had been replaced by a new one. Our new home was now 'Elementary' (my choice, and I had scowled mightily at someone when he had suggested in turn 'Pant-y-pink', 'The Bed-Breakers', 'Sherlock's Home', 'Doctor's Orders', 'Makin' Bacon' and, to cap it all, 'Dundetecting'!).
“If you don't get inside me in the next sixty seconds”, I snarled, “I am withholding sex for a week!”
I pulled a face and put the rest of the sticky chocolate bar down. These 'Mars bars' were far too sickly for my liking; their Whole Nut rivals were so much better.
“Your brothers are certainly quite distinctive”, Sherlock smiled. “Perhaps one day you can have a whole family reunion here or in Cornwall. I could help arrange that....”
Named for the city, it is approximately three hundred yards in length, running east-north-east from Gloucester Place (the A41) in the west and crossing (Lower) Baker Street and two other roads before it effects a right-angled turn by the Gardens and becomes Manchester Street. The Gardens were not open to the public until 1886 so after John's brief time there; as mentioned Cramer Street lay just the other side of them. John was just over a mile from the Surgery at this house, whose identity he promised to keep secret.
1930. As a new Blaze appears, the first one's silence provokes someone to lose their temper that once too often.
We had only been at our cottage for two nights following our return from Wiltshire to assist Sherlock's grandson Lord Trelawney Hawke when we were summoned to the capital on a matter of great urgency. Now we were back in our old rooms at 221B Baker Street, a place that I had never thought to see again.
I stared at the rogue as he hustled me into an empty room. That was wrong on so many levels that I did even not know where to start and why were my buttons suddenly so damn difficult?
“As you can see it has been clipped twice”, he said, pointing to where the train conductors had marked the ticket at each end.
The young red-headed fellow who had arrived with the West Country pest was vaguely familiar, although I was fairly sure that we had not met before. He was in his early twenties and of an impressive musculature for one so young. And he really did not need to be wearing a vest and shorts that tight as if he had just come from an athletics meeting and had not had time to change. The young these days!
“I don't know why they do not just march in and grab me”, Mr. Magnum sighed, running his hand through his dark curly hair.
I, John Hamish Watson, still maintain that this was not a real case and that some blue-eyed genius was being a mean meanie from Meanieville in making me include it in the Sherlock canon. But he 'persuaded' me – oh boy did he 'persuade' me! – and once I was able to hold a pen again I had to write it up.
At the railway-station Sherlock sought out the station-master and asked him about the line's conductors.
Later that night we.... you know. I was sure from they way they looked at me in our next match that Bill and Jay knew what was going down (me every damn night and every damn morning!), but all they did was smirk. Though that was bad enough, damn them!
I winced. I could see all too well what Mrs. Mercy LeStrade had perhaps naturally assumed. Sherlock asked the obvious question.
I shuddered. Modern art! Sherlock led me through the door to the right and I looked around in surprise.
“Yes”, he said unashamedly, slowly grinding his crotch against mine. “Now I think I am ready for Round Thirty-One.”
Fortunately as so often Sherlock came to my rescue (he must have already downed three cups by the look of him).
“I do not remember you complaining when we had sex inside the beach-house with the green door”, he smiled.
“This weird business of the Millington Square attack, sir”, he said. “Mrs. Ollerton was attacked by three men and had her purse stolen. Her husband was with her but he's a weedy little runt; one of them was enough to take him down.”
“I know that I am being silly and melodramatic”, she said, “but the moment I saw that photograph I wanted to know more of that poor man. He looked so handsome and so…. I know that it is an odd thing to say but so
The son of Mr. Everard Street, Demetrius was known around Dingwall as 'Misery Street'. He was an unpleasant bully who delighted in tormenting people around the town. He met the original Bad End when he tried to scare the local taxidermist into a heart-attack by leaping down in front of him from behind a door while wielding a knife; the chair that he had been on overbalanced and his knife went into his neck, killing him almost instantly. The taxidermist then stuffed him and a year later Sherlock did that rare thing, investigating something that he really, really should not have done. Safe to say he never again had stuffing with his roast dinners!
