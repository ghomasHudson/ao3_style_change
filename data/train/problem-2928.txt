"What are you humming?" Castiel asked.
"Could just be from a hookup."
"What happened with Dean?"
Sam hesitated a moment as well. "Okay... what's going on?"
"Well yes, but that's not what I'm talking about."
"I would never hurt Cas. They're from family."
"I'm not going to object." Castiel laughed. Castiel nuzzled in, head pillowed on Deans chest warm and sated with post orgasmic bliss. Dean was gently stroking his hair with his fingers and was almost asleep before he spoke up.
"What are you talking about?" Castiel asked. He was standing in front of the body mirror, deciding which pants he should wear.
"Sammy invited me over for some amusant pervers." Gabe waggled his eyebrows.
Cas shook his head on a laugh as the waiter came back with their food. To Dean's surprise, he actually liked the food, but he would never let Sam know. Most of their meal they talked about what they did while the other was gone, leaving out certain details. They talked a little about Baby names and Dean almost cried when Sam suggested if it's a boy to name it after him. The dinner was really nice and even for a moment, it felt like a personal one. A moment or two Cas would just look at him and it'd feel like they were all alone.
"It's probably your French, Dean. You're pretty rusty." Sam said around a mouthful of food.
Seriously it's entirely a possibility that Dean was becoming a sex addict because every minute of every day he just wanted to be with Cas. He could hardly even focus in school without thinking about making Castiel all these meals after they work up an appetite. Christmas Eve they go Christmas light looking in the Impala and Cas has the fucking balls to get onto the floorboards and suck Dean off while he's driving.
"Yeah that sounds like my brother. Sorry."
"Tu penses?"
"I'm not gonna last much longer, Cas."Dean moaned. Castiel kissed Dean roughly, holding his face in both his hands, as he continued to fuck him, swallowing his moans and silent whimpers which Dean refused to believe he made. Cas went harder, deeper, softer and Dean lost it. He stilled his hand as his length twitched in release and he yelled out strings of curses. "That's it, Cas. Like that. Oh fuck!" Dean moaned. Cas's hips stuttered and Dean swore he could have come a second time from what Cas said next.
"Precisely." He smiled.
Every time Cas does something as simple as a finger touch to him, that's all he hears in his mind. Cas telling him that he deserves to be loved, and he really is trying to make himself believe that. Dean has always thought he was broken, useless, shameful, unworthy. A part of him still does, because he considers loving Cas selfish. But Cas is helping him be better and he wants that. So he can feel proud and joyful to love Cas, and not feel like he's holding him back.
"Mm," Dean leaned more into Cas. "What did you have in mind?"
"Oh I almost forgot!" Cas said suddenly as he hopped up from the couch. He came back from the bedroom in a matter of seconds with Deans necklace. "Whole reason you came here right?" Castiel smiled hooking the necklace on for Dean.
"There's nothing you wouldn't do, Gabe." Castiel scoffed.
"I believe you left it open on my coffee table along with my robe that time you left."
"How?"
"Do you know anyone who does?"
"Yeah," Dean sighed and snubbed out the other cigarette.
It started with the humming. Dean could never tell who was humming or even where it was coming from, but it was no doubt there. It didn't take him long to figure out though that no one else heard the humming. He was just barely in school when he thought he was going insane. He remembered coming home to his mother and asking her where the sound was coming from. She just sang him Hey Jude until the noise faded to the back.
"Yeah. Said that I was your Mary." Dean broke down into tears of joy and longing and buried his face in Cas's neck as he stroked his hair. "You're not supposed to cry right now." He laughed slightly.
The two of them finished their meals simply conversing over simple things before they left the restaurant. Before walking back to Deans car though, Dean walked him around a little bit continuing their conversation. Cas laughed at Deans tacky jokes and crude humor enjoying this date far more than he anticipated. Briefly it crosses his mind that he was walking here with Inias not even a week ago and he feels guilty for leading one, if not both of them on.
"Awwww."
"In. Cause there are certain things I would like to do to you while we wait that aren't quite acceptable in public."
"Speaking of," Death chimed up, looking at his pocket watch. "We might want to do that soon."
"None of us think less of you because of that, you know that don't you, Dean? You're family and we are glad that your happy." Jody smiled.
Castiel simply rolled his eyes and walked into his bedroom. He gathered up his dirty clothes and put them in the hamper before pulling a fresh turtleneck out of his closet and pulling it on. He pulled out a pair of dress pants and as he was pulling them on he stepped on something.
"Goodnight, Castiel."
"Well I don't know about that but he certainly has a nice ass." Dean chuckled as Castiel leaned in for a kiss.
Maybe Cas was trying to live in the past. Being with Inias reminded him of the nostalgia of simpler times. Times when his mother and father still talked with him. Times when his sisters looked up to him. But that was over and maybe what he was doing with Inias was toxic not just to himself but Inias too. It wasn't fair for Castiel to lead him on, but perhaps he could indulge in the momentary relief it gave him for a while longer.
"Yeah?" Dean blushed.
This was it. They were actually going on a date.
"No. Just- took me by surprise is all." Dean panted.
Once the group had left he was able to get some alone time with his husband. Cas showed no relent or mercy that night making Dean cum nine times before he finally went to sleep. Cas watched as Dean slept, sweaty and peaceful and he sketched him like usual. He thought to himself he could never tire of Dean, because each feeling with him was a religious experience, an epiphany, a euphoric moment he held in his heart. And he knew he still wouldn't ever get tired of calling Dean his husband.
"Peut-être que je devrai peut-être vous enseigner."
The waiter came by with their menus and of course Sam got some frilly rabbit food, Eileen something similar but at least it had chicken. Dean grimaced at the menu for its lack of red meat and carbs.
"Last night you said you didn't want to date... but you said you didn't mind me. Are we- I mean did you mean that were-"
"I like them a lot. They feel more real than a lot of things in this world." He said. Castiel didn't quite understand but then he remembered that sometime Deans bipolar makes it hard to tell if things are real or not.
"It totally does! Look!" Dean laughed showing him the paper. Cas smiled softly and took the paper.
"And you got on me all night for not letting her go." Cas laughed as he sat next to Dean, almost sitting on his lap with the small confine of the love seat. He traced her eyelids softly and Dean watched as he long gentle hands cradled her head in his palms.
"A little bit. Him and the brunette chick."
"You want some food, it's in the kitchen. You know where he everything is." Castiel said taking a seat next to Dean on the couch.
"Indeed. He sure was insistent on getting you those numbers. I hope they were useful."
"He's in the shower. Can I help you, Dean?"
"Well I'm grateful."
Just as Dean was going to get up from where he was crouching, Sam grabbed his wrist.
"He will. We had a deal."
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean- I really just don't want you to get hurt. I know you're strong, you're the strongest man I know... but the thought of losing you again, it kills me. It's not that I don't want to hunt with you, cause you're a pretty badass hunter. So we can do this hunt together, okay? You and me. Can you forgive me?"
The two of them hailed a cab together and drove to Le Bouchon, a bar that the two of them often went to pick up people. Castiel didn't ever ask Gabriel's sexuality but his brother often picked up both men and women. Castiel on the other hand had tried the ladies, but he knew he was gay. The only woman who had ever made him question was Meg a French violinist that he spent two weeks with during the summer of his eighteenth birthday. She was lovely and beautiful, but when it came to sex he just... couldn't. So he resorted to spending his early twenties with his brother picking up boys in bars and taking them back home for the night. It always left him a little unsatisfied and exhausted because although the sex was great and he in truth didn't want a relationship, sometimes finding a new one night stand was just as hard as dating. They made it inside the bar and went up to the counter where Benny Lafitte was tending tonight.
"I love you so much," Cas gasped into his ear.
"They say pain and sadness make you feel creative, but I just feel... numb. I thought I could save Cas, fix things... she told me it would be better here,"
Although Garth was great, he was a bit overbearing at this point in time, so he excused himself as he went to the kitchen to grab some more food. He sighed before forcing himself to go back out. Sam and Eileen were being all cute and cuddly in the corner and any other day, Dean would've made fun of him. Would have smiled at the two. But right now, today, he was just... sad. The one person he wanted that with, was gone and he couldn't have it. Then those words echoed in his head again.
"So how has your week been?" Dean blushed.
Cas sat up and grabbed Deans face pulling him into a tender kiss. It's a little inelegant and Dean knows he tastes too much like alcohol but neither of them seem to care. "I don't want to sleep with anyone else. Just you." Cas whispered.
"Thank you. Breakfast was delicious, and so was last night."
"I will not."
"Okay, I think I understand now. So when could I play draw four if I have one?"
"Morning." She signed.
"Guess it never came up," Dean said and turned to Meg in hopes to change the subject. "Can I have a hit of that?" He asked and tried to ignore the skeptical look Castiel gave him.
"I know it's not necessary since we already have our promises to one another, but I like symbols... tonight I wanted to ask you," Cas took a deep breath and pulled a small black box from his trench coat. When he opened the box Deans heart caught in his throat.
"I'm glad. Au revoir, Dean."
mentions of bipolar disorder and medications
"Really?"
"They're breathable... and they make me feel pretty." Castiel mumbled shyly. Gabriel's lips tilted in a smile. "Shut the fuck up about it or get out."
Dean nodded for a moment thinking of how he could do that. He walked slowly away from Death to where he shouldn't be able to hear him. Despite the fact that the empty seemed to have infinite space, when he finally spoke it sounded muffled. As if he were in a sound studio and the noise was being trapped in.
"I don't know what you're talking about." He blushed.
"Turn off the light." He gruffed at Sam. He listened as his little brother moved across the room and he heard the -click- of the lamp being turned off. "Thanks." He said leaning back on the wall. His eye lids were like glue from all the tears he knew he had cried. He rubbed the crust out of them and forced himself to blink into the much dimmer room now. Sam walked over to him and was still fuzzy in his vision.
"No not really. See, you're the reason Bobby Singer trapped me all those years ago."
"Parce que je suis un pédé."
Dean was idly listening but more involved with his younger nephew Dean who was showing him how to stack blocks. Eileen was already pregnant again and she was not too happy about it, but she loved her son and the new girl they had on the way. Dean and Cas moved to Maine a few months ago when they talked about wanting a house. Dean got a job at a local garage to become a full time grease monkey, working on vintage cars for shows. Cas had started a job in writing 'fables' but Dean and every other hunter knew the stories Cas wrote were true. Castiel was a published author of the series he called Rebellion. Dean had read and purchased everyone of his books and still blushed like a virgin every time he read C. Winchester on the cover or see his name on the dedication page. They'd been married just two years now and couldn't be happier.
"Ha! He's funny. Dean always had a dry sense of humor. Always so anal retentive, couldn't take a joke." Dean rolled his eyes.
"That's what?... Aura? How do we get an 'aura'?"
"No." He mumbled.
"For what?"
Dean wanted to bask in this moment for the rest of his time on this messed up planet, but realized he hadn't slept more than a couple of hours since the night before, and they had already been on the road for so long. A look at the clock said it was now just past one in the morning. The feeling of drifting barrelled into the spark of Cas's closeness.
"No I can't. I actually don't think I've gone this long without sex since I met you. I might actually die."
"Good. Now hurry up." Cas smiled playfully.
"Yeah. It was like from last weeks paper. Thursday's I believe. It talked all about you and your art. People saying you're the new up and coming artist of the century."
Halos?
I’m sorry for this :/
"I hardly think that's true," Cas scoffed.
"We didn't prep you. And we're covered in paint and on the canvas now." He sighed. Dean reached up and pulled his neck down into a kiss. Cas readjusted to fit between Deans legs and soon understood what he was getting at. Cas ground his hips down against Deans rubbing his erection in the jut of Deans hipbone. Dean bit his lip and reached a hand down in between them grabbing both of their cocks in his fist. Dean smirked to himself as Castiels knees buckled with the touch. Dean used the hand without paint on it and made a tight grip around both of their members and stroked tightly and slow, toying with the heads on the upstroke. They both groaned and kissed each other through their noises.
"I love you too." He grumbled getting up to get more beer. Everyone started conversing a bit more and as the hours passed, the sun went down a bit. Suddenly Sam tapped a fork to his beer bottle getting everyone's attention as he stood up.
"Oh. Hello. My name- does he speak English?" He looked at Dean on the monitor.
There were eleven young adults in the class, Dean included who were graduating today. Instead of making them wear caps and gowns, they continued to wear their school uniforms as their Master Chef called their names and gave them each a chefs hat and wooden spoon with their names engraved. Castiel couldn't help but take a picture of Dean when he went up. He smiled widely as he shook his teachers hand and took a seat next to Cas. Castiel had never felt more prideful of anyone or anything. He kissed his cheek before waiting for the last of the students.
slight suicidal ideation.
By the end of the night, well, early morning, everyone was gone again. Dean sat on the love seat, holding his daughter in his arms. Still every time he said it he couldn't believe it. Samantha was long since sleeping and he himself was tired, but he didn't want to let her go.
Then there was a serious silence over them. It wasn't awkward but... solemn.
Dean understood what the angel was conveying without him even speaking. Cas took his sweet time opening Dean up, being so careful and taking so long, Deans erection waned a bit. Deans eyes were closed and he almost whined as he felt Cas's fingers leave him. He breathed deeply and soon the blunt head of Castiel was nudging at his entrance and Dean's thoughts narrowed to that singular point of contact as he breached that first tight ring of muscle. Cas was whispering reassurance to Dean that was comforting, even though he couldn't really make out what the words he was saying meant. Dean threw his head back with a groan as the angel inched inside him, the stretch was glorious and perfect just like he imagined it would be. The connection between them was burning with a delirious mix of want and need. His will stretched and bended to Cas, his entire universe narrowed to each thrust of the other man's hips and the grip of his hands. Castiel leaned forward once he was fully bottomed out and pulled Dean into a messy kiss that was little more a clash of teeth. Cas laughed out loud before kissing Dean again. He moved his hands up fist in Dean's hair. They sighed into each others mouths and Dean could taste the beer still lingering on his tongue.
Dean,
"Let's go out drinking. It's been a while, no hook ups, just you and me." Gabe suggested. Castiel sighed.
"Please... don't make me say it." Dean muttered still kissing Castiels neck and shifting them around to walk to the bed.
"What do you want us to be?" Castiel asked earnestly.
"Sammy says that he found women's panties in his dresser."
Because I'm a queer.
"Yeah, don't read them. Can I come by and pick them up?"
"You want to go to bed? Or is it to early?" Cas asked picking up their long since forgotten dishes.
But how in the hell would that even be possible? But somewhere, deep down, Dean knew it had to have been him. It didn't make sense, but it was Castiel and he couldn't help but kiss the handle of the key before standing up and safely stashing it in a lock box. He sat on the edge of the bed thinking for a minute. This is a huge start. He wanted to laugh and dance and sing, he wanted to weep and yell and sob like a goddamn baby. But for now, maybe he could get some rest. He lied back in bed a moment just thinking. His eyes couldn't close so he decided to do something he hadn't tried since before the empty.
"Is it working?"
"What are we?"
Talk soon okay?
"It was under consideration... I could never." Cas smiled and kissed Deans lips softly. The two of them laid back in the grass, staring up at the stars while Cas talked about the creation of them.
The bottle was almost completely full, and he hadn't gone in for a new prescription. This was the same bottle he got months ago. He stopped taking them.
"Sure thing. Swing by anytime."
Castiel turned back to the bar only for a moment to grab their whiskeys and ask Benny to put it on their tab before turning back. One of the men was tall, probably about six foot four with long brown hair and hazel eyes. He was very muscular and not a bad looking man but definitely not his type. The other man though was... breathtaking.
"Of course." Dean smiled.
"Early this morning. I just woke up and for the first time in, god, months I felt inspired."
"Well, you know I'm named after an angel. I also just kind of became addicted to tattoos."
"No... I think he meant you."
"Would you like me to explain to your brother the circumstances as to why I said such a word?" Dean shot up and shook his head. "Then stop complaining. I learned all this vocabulary from you anyways."
When they hopped out, Dean dried Castiel off and kissed him softly before tucking him into bed. Dean stopped in the living room to grab Cas's stash which was running a little low. He brought it into the bedroom and crawled under the covers with Cas, both of them loose, naked and warm.
"Thanks, Dad. I- I love you."
"Why do you have Xanax?" Dean asks Cas while they are in the cab to the airport.
Seven Days Later
"Fuck you." Gabe laughed taking a sip.
"Excuse me? Why not?"
"Yeah. His name is Adam. His moms real sweet. I don't know why she puts up with my dad, but she's good. Too good for him."
"Mark of- that was five years ago! You've known five years and you didn't tell me?!" Dean yelled.
"The sketch. Did you like it?"
"Thank you." Cas paused, then said, "I missed you."
Sam and Gabriel cast them a suspicious look when they got to the restaurant late. And they gave even more looks when Dean winced as he took his seat. Castiel smiled to himself though, resting a hand on Deans thigh throughout the meal.
"They weren't very accepting of the whole... gay thing."
"Well, pick on Cas. I would've been up and out here thirty minutes ago if it wasn't for Kissy Mc. Kisserson over there."
"Well, first off, they're only referred to as 'auras' in Greek. I'm assuming this is for a spell?"
The trip to Winslow was a long one. Luckily Sam didn't bitch about Deans driving except for twice the whole way. They made several stops for gas and food, but still, Dean didn't really eat. They drove through the night because Dean refused to stop at a motel and get behind track. The sooner they got the halo for the spell, the sooner they could use it and get Cas back.
"Better brush your teeth then." Castiel straddled Dean playfully.
It was a warm evening for September in Compiègne. Castiel was in his flat on the balcony admiring the city skyline trying to get back to painting. Castiel had graduated from École Boulle in May and decided to stay in France to continue to pursue his future in art. Castiel Novak was born in Kansas and spent most of his life there as well. When he was sixteen he was emancipated from his parents Chuck and Naomi and moved to France to live with his brother Gabriel. He had lived with his brother until he had enough money to buy his own flat. Gabriel was kind of an asshole but he was the only family Castiel really had. His brother helped him get into the art college and he graduated top of his class, however with the mess of paints on his canvas now, you wouldn't believe that at all.
"Yeah. That's where we had our issues. He could hit me fine, but when he got Sammy hospitalized, I couldn't let that slide."
"Jack, look at me." Dean spoke firm. Jack turned to him, almost as if he was outside from himself. "I know we've had our ups and downs, you and me. I know I've said some stupid things that I didn't mean. But I'm here now, we're here, because you're family. We look after our family, Jack. And I know there are lots of things going on in your head right now. Things you don't understand. But I need you to look inside. I need you to think really hard. How do you feel?"
"Hey baby." Cas said glancing over quickly before returning his attention back to his painting.
"Cas, fuck I'm gonna-" he tried to pull Castiels hair to get him off but Castiel only pushed with more force swallowing even harder until Dean couldn't take it anymore. His back arched off the bed, one hand tightening in Castiels soft hair, the other gripping the sheets tight enough to make them rip. He came hot and hard all the way down Castiels throat with moan that he didn't even believe was his own. He felt wetness at the corners of his eyes and quickly wiped them away because Dean Winchester does not cry, especially not during sex.
"Your welcome I guess. Thanks for uh, not calling the looney bin."
"So Dean," John started. "When're you gonna cook something for me?"
"Talk to him. Maybe put him on new meds."
"Weed will always be my first love, but I have plenty of love to go around." He smiled cheekily.
"So you're in college?" Castiel asked.
"And what did you tell him?"
"My art wouldn't be what it is without that lovely, kind devilishly handsome man in the front row," Cas winked at him. "One year ago today, actually, I met Dean for the first time. I told myself that I couldn't be happy without putting my art first. But luckily, Dean didn't give up on me. We had our ups and downs but Dean is more to me than anyone could think. He is the sole reason this painting exists," he gestured to the ten foot canvas of him and Cas kissing. "He is the reason of all of my works. Dean is my best friend, he is my muse, the love of my life... he is my entire world. Honey would you come up here for a moment?"
"How was school today?"
"Don't apologize. I'm not mad at you. We just weren't done with our conversation."
"Oh. What are you doing calling me? I thought you hated me."
"What? God no! No, I just um... I can't even say it."
"I love you."
"That's why I picked 'em." He smirked. They both laughed a little, easing their nerves for going to Kansas.
Distantly his ears were ringing, his mind was reeling, his stomach was churning. He wasn't even sure where he was until he felt strong hands shaking his arms and the sound of a familiar voice.
He opened his voicemail.
Damn his father, damn Chuck, damn Billie, the empty, heaven, hell, good and evil. Because Dean Winchester wasn't made to play along and follow the rules. He wasn't the Michael Sword, he wasn't the ultimate killer, he was just a lover. And much like his fallen Angel, in this moment, he knew that he was lost. That they were writing their own story now.
"No it's fine. What are you working on now?" He asked going over to take a seat next to Cas on the couch.
Sam, Eileen, Dean and their daughter Jade came over to celebrate as well. Sam and Eileen told her stories about how him and Cas and Dean always used to bicker and fight. Told her all about Team Free Will and how she too is a legacy that will lead on whether or not she chooses to hunt monsters. Even Jack left Samantha a present, it was a snow globe that showed the gates of heaven. When she'd asked where the gift came from, Dean had answered by saying it was from her brother Jack, who was god. Dean had never seen Samantha smile so widely. Although Dean really didn't want Samantha to get stuck into the life he did, he wasn't surprised when she wanted to hear stories about how her Daddy and Uncle Sammy killed the devil. Even as they tucked Samantha in to bed and Cas read her the first chapter of their love story, they made sure there was holy water and salt under the bed before laying to rest for a night of dreams that couldn't compare to what became true for the both of them.
Dean realized then how hard it is to live in the excitement of women and yet have no desire for them. Now this angel has taken him, and silenced him. Been his light while gods monsters and his exes have been the shadows and confines of darkness. The way Cas touches him and has stilled him breathless, yet he still can't be quiet. With Cas it is to be broken, and torn open, vulnerable. Giving things he's never given before. Being this vulnerable, it almost hurts, but Cas is there healing him. Making him whole again.
"Dean," Cas sighed pulling him tight into a hug. "I'm here, okay? I'm going to take care of you- I want to take care of you. So, talk to me. Tell me what's going on."
"Everything okay between you and Cas? I mean, you seem fine just... different."
Sam went back into the main halls of the bunker when Eileen had informed him that she was back. Dean wanted to go into the empty without him regardless. Death started chanting the incantation in some older sounding version of Enochian and suddenly darkness opened up. The same black liquid that had taken Cas, spread along the wall and opened up into an empty seeming abyss. Death looked at Dean and they both nodded at each other before they were sucked into the dark emptiness.
"Art." He said simply.
"I didn't like the way they made me feel." He said quietly, so quiet Cas almost didn't hear him.
Castiel was having brunch with Gabriel while Dean and Sam went shopping. Gabe was talking about the current film he's working on and all about the new dog him and Sam got named Bones. Gabe and Castiel hadn't gotten around much to spending this kind of time together like they used to, so when Gabe called up he agreed.
"All out of conditioner."
"I dunno," Cas said around a mouthful of toothpaste. "I give pretty amazing blowjobs."
"I hope you left of your own volition and not because my drawing freaked you out..."
Dean turned away from the conversation a bit. He knows Cas has been with other people. Lots of other people. Hell, he's seen it. But now it makes him jealous in a way he's never felt before. At least he doesn't have to worry about Meg, Cas said she was aesexual. Not to mention, Cas is pretty gay.
The two of them went to the store in silence only speaking when Dean asked where Gabriel was taking Sam. Once the two made it to Monoprix, they went their separate ways to grab what they needed. Sam headed to the produce section to grab his frilly food, while Dean headed towards the back section to get toiletries first. He also picked up some groceries and special ingredients such as almond flour and powdered sugar that he knew he would need for their next pastry section at the school. He met up with Sam near the checkouts and he had a basket filled to the brim with protein packs and vegetables. Sam took one look in Deans cart and bolted off quickly like he had forgotten to get something. Sammy ran back to get whatever he was getting while Dean made his own purchases and had everything loaded back up in the Impala by the time Sam made it back. The two hopped in and drove back home to unload their things. Once everything was settled in again, Sam watched television whilst Dean was reading some of the recipes he had to make for next week. Dean couldn't really focus on all the reading so instead he tried to imagine what Castiel could have in mind for tonight.
"You didn't tell me you were on disability." Cas said around a mouthful of sandwich.
"Sneaky s.o.b," Sam chucked examining the key. "Wait- what jacket?"
Come in handsome.
He finished up quickly and made his way out of the bathroom. He passed by his mess of a room and saw the disarray it was in. Beer bottles littered his nightstand, his bed was a mess, tissues were over filling the garbage can. He mentally kicked himself for being such a crybaby before he started to clean up a bit. He even took the extra liberty of organizing some. Once he was done he decided to strip out of his dirty, foul smelling clothes and change into something more decent. He opened his closet and pulled on a plain black and white Led Zeppelin t-shirt and threw on a blue and green flannel over top. He sat on the side of his bed to tie his boots and when he looked up he felt his heart stutter again.
Dean didn't want to say it. "When I'm under a lot of anxiety, like flying, it can make me act up. I don't want you to see me like that."
"Yeah okay." He chuckled. Castiel sighed shaking his head.
"I'd threaten to come beat you up, but I think an even worse punishment would be knowing that Castiel would spend even more time thinking he did something wrong. Eventually convincing himself he deserves this, because that's who he is."
"Don't worry about it, it's a gift. Unless you don't like it," Dean said sheepishly.
"What's wrong?" Gabe hollered out. Cas sat down on the bed cradling his foot.
This time Castiel gave Dean a double take, eyes widening as he came out of his room.
Because they were not done with their conversation. No where near. Sam was beyond tired by three in the morning, but Dean was sharp as a pistol from the copious amounts of caffeine pumping through his system.
Dean turned back to Cas, who was still mildly confused, but nodded anyways. Dean took Cas's hand in his and intertwined their fingers. The angel looked down at their mingled hands in confusion and Dean simply smiled. They walked over to Death and he said another incantation, soon they were being warped and sucked out of the pitiful cold darkness. They popped right back out into Deaths library and then turned to Death.
"I like them." Dean blushed underneath his eyelashes.
Dean put a hand on her knee for reassurance. "Eileen, Sam would do anything for you, you know that right?" She shrugged. "Well he would. Especially for your baby. He's gonna be so happy, you have no idea. This is all he's ever wanted."
He closed his eyes and tried to ignore it. He looked at the expression on Castiels face for a second and it was one of concern. One full of love and he couldn't help but wonder if Castiel, was actually real. He did seem a little bit too perfect.
"Shut up." Dean laughed and Castiel smiled too.
"Me too. How are you feeling?"
"I want to know why the hell I have been the one getting calls from my baby brother sobbing for the past week. I want to know why the ever loving fuck, you think it's okay to up and leave like that."
"He's in bed, I'm just getting us some food."
"Of course. I can't wait to take you to the beach tomorrow."
Dean was more than willing and on board when he suggested that they get out of there. He took his hand which was delicate and soft, however there were callouses there that made him all the more interesting. He pulled him forward to the bar where Sam and Gabriel were still flirting.
"I know." Castiel smiled.
"So I've heard."
When I get back I'm buying you more.
"What?" Cas asked pouring their soup.
"Look if it will get you off my ass we exchanged numbers and we both agreed to hook up again. Kay?"
Two weeks after their conversation on the couch, Dean was fully moved out. It wasn't too difficult seeing as how most of Deans clothes and books were at Cas's anyways. Dean had met up with his pharmacist and got back on his medication.
"No, you're not. Cas if anything happened to you I couldn't live with myself."
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready to go." He said.
"Oh you're American?" The younger of them asked.
"No," Cas muttered shaking his head.
He pulled Cas into their bedroom and pushed him up against the wall next to the double glass doors. He kissed him deep and heated, the kind of kisses he'd missed. Cas pulled at his hair, a slight sting on his scalp and he smiled into it. Castiel worked on unbuttoning Deans flannel one handed while Dean sucked bruises onto his neck. Once Castiel got his shirt off, he leaned down to lave over Deans nipples, bitting them gently in the way that drives Dean crazy. They were both gasping and panting by the time Cas shoved him back onto the bed. Cas quickly stripped himself of his clothing as Dean tried to work out of his pants.
"If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?" He began to sing the intro. He sang the next lines and altered them slightly, because that what he and Cas used to do together when they'd sing a new song. "But if I stay here with you, boy. Things just couldn't be the same," the chains started to glow brighter each second and his eyes were wet with tears and his lips hurt with his smile. "Bye-bye, baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah. Though this feelin' I can't change, and Lord knows I'm to blame." He sand the rest of the song, the chains getting brighter and brighter with each verse until he was sure they couldn't get any brighter. He looked around, but Cas wasn't there still.

"Deal."
"I hope he gives it to you." Gabe said.
"You screw a lot of people in your brothers house?" Cas just rolled his eyes before sitting up a bit. Castiel pulled Deans pants down his thighs a bit to expose his half hard cock.
"Bonjour amant." Castiel smiled a dopey grin from the couch.
"Anal retentive? That doesn't sound like my Dean at all." He said with a smirk. John started laughing hard again and Dean pinched Cas. Once John caught his breath, all three of them were smiling.
"We've got time. I just got back from flying I don't really want to go soon. I'm still going to try and call him more."
"Dean?" Castiel said after picking up on the first ring. "Dean, talk to me. Please."
Dean was surprised he hadn't flipped out yet. Cas was his best friend. Over a decade long, and now he was in his bed giving him good morning kisses. The last time he kissed a man, he'd gotten beaten for it. A part of him was still afraid of that, but it was like Castiels touches searched out that pain and tried to heal it. He let Cas lean in and kiss him again, much more heated the second time around. It was still a lazy morning kiss, their lips slow and languid against each other's like a riptide in the summer, crashing along the shore. His kisses somehow made the silence around them explode and a world of colors appeared behind his closed eyes. Every thought in his brain stripped and replaced with Castiel. Cas. His Cas. Cas's lips pressing into his, his hands pulling Dean closer, running up and down his back, carding into his hair. The taste of Castiels mouth and the velvet heat of his breath ghosting along his face. When he finally convinced himself to pull away from the embrace of the angels lips and tongue, he had something to say, but his brain failed to string any thoughts back together. So Dean simply pulled him back and hoped that his kiss would show Castiel those three words. With the way Cas kissed him back, it only felt like understanding and reciprocation.
"Cas, what the hell man?"
"Wow. I uh, I didn't ask. I think they're still staying here though."
It was a little bit passed seven by the time he got back to the bunker and he already saw the cars in the garage on his way in. Everyone was in the library when he stepped in and they all cheered when they saw him.
"This is your car?"
"It's fine, Dean. Thank you for letting me do that for you."
"I wasn't going to, Dean. But if you ever want to talk-"
By the time they were both down to their boxers, they couldn't take their hands off of one another. Years of tension and build up, all the heartbreaks and death, it was just them. Dean couldn't even find himself to think twice about the fact that Cas was a man anymore. Because it just felt so damn right. The crawled on top of the covers together, Cas pressed underneath the weight of Deans body. His eyes were blown and wide, hands still roaming Deans bare skin. Dean trailed pepper like kisses along Castiels jaw and down to his neck. Nipping lightly along the angels pulse to see his reaction. Castiels whole body shuddered with the action, so he laved his tongue over the nip of his sharp teeth and sucked a mark there. He felt almost possessive and happy at the fact that Cas would be wearing a clear mark and reminder of what they had done for the next few days. Although, Dean doubted the angel would forget this, knowing he wouldn't.
"No that's not what-" Sam sighed. "Never mind." As they were washing off the last of the dishes, Eileen came up behind Sam wrapping her arms around his waist and kissed his shoulder.
"Pour être honnête je ne savais même pas combien de Français tu parlais."
Dean simply rolled his eyes as he left his flat. He walked out onto the street and shivered in the cold. He knew it was only a matter of time before it snowed. He got into the Impala and drove to Castiels place in the early, early morning.
"After all we've been through?"
"I moved here to Compiègne when I was sixteen. I was emancipated from my parents and I moved here to stay with my brother, Gabe."
"I'm always thinking about, Dean. But more specifically his father."
"That's very sweet..." Cas said as if he were momentarily distracted. "But I uh, I meant going to see your father."
"At least he doesn't smoke all my weed like someone else I used to live with." Everyone was giggly as Cas laid Dean down in bed. Dean sighed happily as Cas tucked him in and kissed his temple before parting to go hang out with Meg once more.
"Romantically or sexually?"
Cas took Deans hand and dragged him off stage over to a private room. As soon as they were in the room, Castiel kissed Dean long deep and hard. Much like their first kiss last September and it's hard to believe how far they've come. Dean still had tears flowing out of his eyes when Cas finally pulled his soft lips off his enough to speak.
"Of course, Gabriel."
"I might just take you up on that offer." Castiel smiled.
He laid back on the couch staring out the window a moment before he heard the lock twisting in the door. He quickly turned around and smiled slightly as Castiel came him. He was cradling a drink carrier and two brown paper bags while juggling his keys and satchel so Dean got up and took his bag and the keys from him. Castiel smiled softly at him and sighed contentedly before setting the stuff down on the coffee table.
"You shouldn't let him dictate your life, you know? You're an excellent cook and you make an amazing gay lover," Castiel smirked. "So no matter what he says to you, you shouldn't let it affect you."
"You mean all that hippie crap?" The young demon said perplexed.
"Remember I'll always be true. And then while I'm away, I'll write home everyday," they sang together as Castiel walked out onto the balcony. "And I'll send all my loving to you."
"Yes, Dean. I'm not an idiot."
"That went well, I think." Cas said.
"You didn't pay attention in Sunday school, did you Dean?" Dean just mocked being offended. "Angels true forms are made up of halos, wings and eyes. Kinda creepy actually."
Dean woke again for the third time that morning, and the second time to an empty bed. Dean sighed and rubbed tiredly at his eyes as he crawled out of bed and threw on his boxers. He padded out of the bedroom and into the living room where Cas had his nose buried in his sketchbook again. This time there was water color paints along the table and Castiel looked absolutely adorable.
"Ugh, stressful in a word." Dean sighed.
Deans eyes welled with tears as he pressed his forehead to Cas's. He shook it briefly stepping out of his grip.
"You, Gabriel, are a walking cliché."
"Jesus Christ, no! No that would not be better, Dean! I love you and I'm not doing this over the phone. You may be giving up on me but I'm not giving up on you. Not now, not ever."
"Get over here. You're making me nervous."
"I'll get the wine." Dean said. He went into the kitchen and got four glasses and a whole bottle of wine. He poured them each a glass as settled to play.
"Jack... he's rebuilding things. He sent me back." She answered. "I don't know what's going on with him though. He seems... different."
"Don't apologize. We can- we can talk about it tomorrow. I just," he sniffled and mumbled into his shoulder. "I just missed you."
"Kelly, this place... it's like nothing you've ever known. I'm the reason why he's in there right now, and I need to find him. I will bring him back, I swear, but you can't come."
"So your French has improved." Inias said as they walked through the park nearby Cas's flat.
Dean passed out practically seconds after he came and Castiel chuckled to himself. He cleaned Dean up before grabbing his sketch pad and sitting on the window sill, wincing slightly as he was pleasantly sore. For a moment he could forget all about Inias, and his failing career in art. He could forget about his brother Gabriel's incessant complaints that he get a boyfriend. Tonight was special. He got to see another side of this beautiful green eyed man. And to top it off, Dean asked him out. A whisper in the back of his mind told him this could be bad, but he didn't care. Dean was opening up to him. He felt trusted, adored, treasured but more than anything, happy.
"Fuck I missed this." Cas panted.
Dean woke up to a soft hand on his face and the gentle tone of his lovers voice.
"Tell me something about you that I might find shocking. You intrigue me."
"I don't know how but your French sounds even better when you're drunk." Dean chuckled taking off his coat.
"In time angel. In time."
"What?" Dean panted, picking up the pace a little bit as both of them got closer to climax.
The thought was totally abrupt, but once he first got Cas back he had seriously thought about quitting hunting. Suddenly there were more important things in his life. He didn't want to lose them again this time around. He got a second chance at happiness. And overall, they'd won.
"So what'd you do while I was gone?" Dean asked once they separated.
"Good, good. I should be graduating in two months. Then I will be an official chef."
"Oh and Dean,"
The two of them headed outside to the beach. The sun was shining brightly and there was a slight breeze. Luckily the wind wasn't too bad because the February weather was cold enough as is. The two of them walked hand in hand stopping every now and then to pick up sand dollars and sea shells. Dean spends a long time just looking at the water, his eyes sparkling with wonderment. They laugh and talk briefly about vacations they took as children and the mischief they used to get into. There are a few children playing in the sand with their parents watching from afar. One little girl all alone seemed to be really upset. Dean kissed Cas on the cheek before walking over to her. Castiel watched in amazement as Dean kneeled down to talk to her; a smile on his face.
His body was still heavy with sleep; he wasn't sure he could move if he wanted to. He tried to squeeze Cas's fingers to thank him, to let him know... but he couldn't tell if he really did or if he only imagined the movement. He felt his hips rocking a little, because his dream had him still swimming in ecstasy, searching out the main man in them. His mind was bleary and he was only aware of the hand holding his, warm familiar lips and soft sheets. His head rolled back and forth, like it's not even part of him, and he heard his own voice making weird high noises, like a wounded animal.
"You look good in my robe," Cas smirked standing back. "But I think you'd look even better without one at all."
"Your names. They're angel names." He said blushing.
"Hang on a sec, Eileen." He said into the receiver as Dean walked right past him. "Hey, where are you going?"
"Hello, Inias."
"Well, I had Sammy with me. And the school- I uh, I didn't realize that being accepted meant I actually had to go to France. That was until I was on the plane."
"Mm," Castiel hummed as he swallowed his coffee. "I turned twenty eight this summer."
"Well," she said looking him up and down. "That's almost a good enough reason for ghosting me. I've gotta say though I'm surprised Clarence. Last I knew you were not the dating type."
"Sounds lovely. I actually bought something for you hang on." Dean said going back up the stairs.
An hour later, Cas's documentary was over and it went to some Family Guy episodes that Dean found funny. Though into the first episode, he found he couldn't focus on the show with their new position. Cas was practically sitting in his lap cuddling now. His head was pillowed on Deans shoulder and as Dean watched; Cas distracted him by nuzzling his nose into his ear.
"Yes I suppose so... wow. So, what now?" Cas asked. Dean went up behind Cas and placed a hand on his lower back, angled to where Sam or Eileen couldn't see.
"Who do I make it out to?" He said and when he looked at Dean, he looked just as stunned as Cas.
They spend days in Ada just trying to find out what poor bastard was being puppeteered like a marionette. The eventually found out it was a St. Paul's boy named Robin.
"So you've had it a long time then." Cas acknowledged.
Inias had asked Castiel out yet again, and he couldn't find it in himself to say no. He hadn't seen Dean in over a week and although he texted him almost every day, Castiel still couldn't help but worry that he scared him off by what they did the last time.
"I would never leave you. Especially now. Cas," this was it. He was about to say it. He's imagined this moment over a decade, and now it's happening. He's not afraid anymore. "Cas, I love you."
"Yeah. I don't know man I just feel like he's trying to help us somehow. I know this place has got to be it." Sam nodded and then his eyes lit up.
"Being fucked?" Castiel asked unsure.
They whipped up- well Dean whipped up- dinner. It was a pasta made from scratch that Dean had mentioned wanting to try. Castiel could tell Dean was tense and stressed and couldn't blame him. From what he heard, he hadn't really seen his father in about six years, and hadn't talked to him at all since he moved to France two years ago. So in order to alleviate some of his stress, while Dean was sitting the sauce, Cas would shotgun hits of Sativa into his mouth like they used to when they first smoked together.
"Bathroom?"
Cas held still, letting Dean adjust to the feeling of being full. It took a little bit for Dean to feel more comfortable. Safe. Cas was right. It was just the two of them, no judgment from his father or self hatred. Cas loved him and wanted this too. He held him tighter as they sucked and nibbled at each others lips. Cas broke away to nudge at Dean's jaw line. He began to slowly kiss at it before trailing down his neck, sucking at the skin there, leaving a dark bruise. Dean moved his own hand up to thread through Cas's hair which Cas had let grow longer. Dean always liked the messy sex hair anyways,  and especially now, how it felt below his fingertips. He could feel every breath from Cas's chest, when Cas grazed his blunt fingernails down Dean's side and back up again, still kissing him softly.
"Sammy, you are a genius!" Dean smiled. Sam handed him the round framed glasses and Dean put them on. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust, but then he was fine. He looked around at the walls and ceilings and there were no sigils that he could see. He sighed a little bit before he looked down at the feather in his hands. It was literally glowing and there were small silver rings around it like a halo, covered with eyes. It was actually really- wait...
"I'm going to bed." She yawned.
"I usually do, yes."
"You can't lie to me. I know you."
"Lil bit." Dean chuckled. "What?! We were playing beer pong."
"That you love me." Castiel whispered cut off with a gasp as Dean hit his prostate.
"I'm glad to be back." He said looking over his shoulder at Dean. "Thank you two, for everything."
"The beginning of your situation, is no place to determine the end of it." Cas said. Dean nodded considering. That was actually pretty good advice. "What does yours say?"
"By help you mean, cook the meal while you taste test and kiss me?"
Snow was falling by the time they made it to Castiels apartment and his nose was flushed red and adorable.
"Ew. Well that's good. I'm glad he's doing well. What about Anna."
"Oh uh," Dean blushed. "All My Loving. Ya know... The Beetles."
"Well, I found your magic museum."
"I heard a snap. My elbow hurts." Cas hissed. Dean carefully took Cas's forearm,  grimacing in apology as Cas winced. Dean hissed when he saw the blood and the bone peeking out of his trench coat.
"Of course. Anything you want." He said into Deans hair.
"You're just a bad influence, Dean." Sam teased as Dean took his first bite of toast.
"Who?" Cas asked and Dean gestured around the whole room and then to his head in a vague explanation. Dean never really talks about his bipolar, so Cas never knows when he should do something to help since he doesn't know when it's happening.
He didn't know if he wanted to laugh or cry. Cas was curled up in a ball wearing the trench coat Dean bought him. His hair was tousled and his cheeks were flushed pink. His eyebrows were scrunched together like he was having a very serious dream and he was twitching in it too.
There it was. The green jacket.
Dean smirked and handed him the lube. He wiped his hand on the sheets and Cas scolded him with a look that Dean knew meant I'm gonna have to wash those now. Cas lubed up his fingers and reached underneath Dean. He traced his fingers on that tender spot right behind his balls before tracing back to his hole. Cas plunged two fingers in at once making Dean whine loudly. Cas scissored him open, probably taking more time then necessary, just drawing gasps, pants and moans from him. Castiel removed his fingers and Dean forced back a whimper at the loss of those long pianist fingers inside him. Cas stroked himself twice before Dean had to sit up. Castiel held the base of his cock while Dean tried to lower himself down. Dean threw his head back with a long drawn out moan, loving every inch of Castiel that filled him. Once Dean was fully seated, he trembled, his head fell against Castiels own as they breathed each other in.
"Which brings us back to square one." Sam sighed.
"Dad I-"
"I do, just no planes. No flying- I can't."
"What other choice do we have? Without Cas here, you're not... you're not you anymore. And I'll be damned if I lose my best friend and my brother."
"Well, we binded Death in order to stop him. We can bind the new Death and make them do whatever we want."
But Jack knows very little about Deaths library, and he wouldn't know to put it in that pocket, even with him being god now. The only one who knows about Deaths library, they empty, that coat, the key is-
"Thank you, John. I hope to stay with Dean for a long time too...." Cas waited a long pause, hesitant to ask. He was sure John liked him. He didn't seem to care all that much that he was a man. But would he say yes? Would he tell Dean? But he still wanted to know. He loved Dean and to have Johns blessing would mean the world to him.
"I can see that," Castiel said going up to run his fingers along the paint. "Beautiful." He whispered.
"Bye." He whispered as she left the room. He fell back onto his bed thinking about lots of things. How much he loved Cas, how much he wanted a life with him, house with a white picket fence, kids, the whole nine yards. How much he wanted out of hunting, just so he could focus on those he loved. Before he knew it he passed out, mind racing with thoughts as he slipped off to sleep.
Dean rolled his eyes and plated up the waffles, glaring at his brother as he made way to leave the kitchen.
"That's amazing," he said leaning over and pressing a kiss to the corner of Castiels mouth. "I'm so proud of you. I don't know how I got you."
"Good?" Cas asked. Dean was at a loss for words so he simply nodded. "More?" Dean nodded again. Castiel pulled his finger out and Dean downright fucking whined at the loss but before he knew it there were two fingers back, pushing inside of him. The second finger was sharper and left a little bit of a sting, but it still felt good. Dean was letting out harsh little pants as Castiel twisted his fingers inside of him. Castiel wrapped his hand around Deans aching cock and stroked slowly in time with his fingers. Dean doesn't know how long he laid there, pliant and probably pathetic in Cas's bed. It felt like minutes but at the same time it could've been hours as Castiel worked him up. His orgasm was sneaking up on him before he knew it. Castiel suddenly crooked his fingers just right and Dean shot up with a loud moan that any other time he probably would've been ashamed of.
"Not at all. But my muse brings it out of me. He was my first model for the angel painting. The one with the green eyes."
Dean's heart fluttered and his lips parted, the words were on the tip of his tongue but they refused to come. He shifted his hips in hopes that the angel would take that as an answer but Castiel simply shook his head.
"What do you want for dinner?" Castiel asked with a smile.
"I think you're forgetting the angel painting he's buying from me, is a rendition of you. I told him you were my muse when he asked."
Sam nodded and Dean gulped.
Inias is just a friend. We hadn't seen each other in a long time.
"No!" Dean defended. "Not at all. Just... overwhelming. In a good way. This has happened before with you."
"I had my wings done about four years ago now. You like?" Castiel asked. Dean found himself walking forward and his fingers running on their own. Castiel had soft, pasty skin and to find such intricately detailed black wings inked onto his skin was breathtaking. The wings started in between his shoulder blades and fanned out all the way down his shoulders, back even down to his elbows. Each feather was so detailed it truly looked real. Like Castiel was an actual angel. He kissed the side of Castiels neck while his hands still smoothed over the wings. Castiel turned in his arms and started kissing Deans neck. Deans eyes rolled into the back of his head as he let himself be swept away by the sensation.

"Your mental health is more important than school, Dean."
"Seriously though. Why are you drunk, Cas? I know you like to drink but," he sighed taking a seat next to him on the couch. "This is different."
"Of course."
Even as Dean woke up in the foggy humid car the next morning, he put on his clothes and cuddled back into a very naked Cas. He still couldn't count all the reasons why he was so wildly in love with the angel. There were miracles in his kisses, medicine to Deans veins. Castiel was Deans waking thought, his sweetest dream, and everything thing good, bad, soft, rough, hot cold just everything in between.
After a whole year of waiting, a young mother named Kelly Kline wasn't ready to raise a child on her own. She liked Castiel instantly when they met and they arranged to adopt the baby once it was born. Lone behold five months later, Dean and Castiel became parents. Dean cried so many times that day, he was sure he'd run out of tears for the rest of his life.
"Aw I'm sorry Angel, I thought I ordered no mushrooms for you." Dean said opening the box.
"If I get lung cancer, I'm gonna haunt your ass." Allen said taking the smoke from Deans thumb and forefinger.
"That feels nice." Cas groaned and Dean smirked. Sam gave them an amused glance before turning his laptop around. Sam explained all the gory details of how three priests were crucified in Ada County. He showed them all the police reports and they all agreed thoughtfully that this looked like a case.
"Maybe he's not coming." Sam sighed.
"Dean, it's fine. We need to take Robin to a hospital anyways." Cas said sitting up. Dean helped him to his feet and they walked across the yard to where Robin was still laying. It didn't take long to realize that he wasn't waking up. Cas looked at Dean with concern and Dean knelt down to check for a pulse.
When they did figure this all out, what would Dean say to Cas? Sure, he knows he loves him, but how can he just say that. Dean can't even tell his own brother what Cas said, and even though he wants- needs- Cas to know he's loved, that's not going to be easy for him. With the way his father raised him, beat him for the way he was, there was a phantom pain in his ribs and in the back of his skull. There was the stiff sore lock of his jaw anytime he thought about his feelings for Cas. Because after all, he's his daddy's blunt little instrument, a good soldier, obedient.
Dean never knew it could be like this. Sex was always some meaningless thing. A means of quick release and pleasure, something to take the edge off. But with Cas it was like swimming in the deepest sea. A little scary and you never know what to expect, but beautiful and calm. Placating and peaceful, feeling free to explore the depths together. Castiel moaned into his ear and Dean held him close. Dean lifted his hips to meet in time with Cas's slow thrusts, silently urging to go faster. Cas got the message and snapped his hips out of control a bit. He hit that spot deep inside of Dean that had him moaning wantonly and clenching down by instinct.
"I have to say the same." Castiel croaked. Dean turned on his side to face Castiel and gave him a chaste kiss before groaning.
"No Dean, it's okay. I get it. The first time me and Eileen... well, we didn't see each other for a while after. It was awkward for a bit, but it just turned out we needed to... explore a little more. Get used to it."
"Like more than a fuck buddy, you have feelings for him."
"Castiel!" He moaned loudly as his orgasm was punched out of him. The two of them laid heavy and numb for a long time before Dean shifted.
"Guess that makes us even." Castiel smirked. "Let me see your phone."
"Shoot."
He eventually started to take medication right before college. The humming was still there but he didn't see the shadow and the didn't talk to him about death anymore so he knew it must be working. Even once he stopped taking them the shadows never really came back but he would still hear the faint whisper, like a mirror of his own voice telling him he existed. The fact that he existed as a human being, flawed and broken and alone, doomed to eternity haunted him. Haunted him to the point of self infliction, trying to take away that fear of existence.
Of course they did the usual. Spray paint the devils trap and buried the box with the necessities in the center, successfully bringing a demon to them.
"Why are you lying to me?" Castiel asked looking up at Dean.
"What? No. No, I'm glad you can talk to him alone. What did you guys talk about?"
"God I need you." Dean whispered. Cas moved back and nodded to the bed which Dean easily laid back on. Cas made quick work of stripping his clothes not even bothering to fold them this time.
He knelt down to the ground to pick it up and examine it. It was a beautiful, long, shiny black feather. The end of it looked like it was dipped in an oil slick with an iridescent sheen. When Dean put it into the light it reflected shades of jade green, cerulean blue, and an indigo shade. The feather was soft and felt comforting and it almost took Dean a minute to snap out of his gaze. The feather wasn't that of any bird, it was much too long, almost the size of Deans forearm. Not to mention he'd never seen a bird with a feather color like that. And almost instantaneously he heard Cas's voice in his head. So close it was like he was right next to him.
"You of all people should know that," Dean fixed Cas with a look that made the angel blush. He sighed at the menu but found something tolerable. "I think I'll do the chicken wrap with the uh, tomato things in it."
"Yeah I thought you might like that. Finally convinced him to wear that damn skirt."
smutty smut smut
"Cas that's amazing!" Dean smiled.
They hung out with Balthazar a lot, and Dean would be lying if he said he wasn't a little jealous of how close Cas was getting to him. But he had to remind himself that Castiel wouldn't cheat. That thing with Inias was a misunderstanding, he's changed and they are in love now. Still he feels a little rage when Balthazar kisses his cheek 'hello' and 'goodbye'.
"Dean, I know how you felt about him, and we'll figure something out. We always-"
"I'm gonna call Gabe, okay? Can I see your phone?" Sam pulled it out of his pocket and handed it to him. Dean smiled and chuckled slightly as the lock screen was a picture of the two of them smiling in bed. He opened the contacts and found Deans in the favorites section before pressing call. It rung three times before he picked up.
"Yes," Castiel laughed. "I'm from Kansas too, actually. My name is Castiel."
"I'll be there soon." He smiled. She sauntered down the hall and Sam smiled after her. Dean was truly happy for his brother. Just then Cas came up behind him and placed his hand on Deans lower back.
"Relax. It's fine. Thank you for breakfast." Dean chuckled a little. Castiel sighed relief before sitting down on the couch and patting next to him for Dean to come sit. Dean sat next to him and for the first time since they met, there was an awkward silence. Castiel drank his coffee glancing nervously at Dean then at his cup until Dean spoke. He explained everything. Why he stopped taking the meds, why he lied about it. He explained the guilt he felt, and still feels about it. About his suicidal thoughts and the voices in his head that told him that the things he loved weren't real. The voices that told him about death. He talked about his mother and how she used to get scared for Dean. About the new medication he started taking and his self examination over the past week and a half to better himself. He talked about how he pushes away everyone he loves because he's afraid of hurting them worse somehow. But most importantly he just explained that he was so, so sorry. For everything.
