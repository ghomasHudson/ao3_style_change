"So what did she want?" Cas asked, fearing the worst.
“Balth, he’s my employer, he could-“
“Shit shit
“Yeah…” he said slowly, “why?” he followed up. Dean just smiled and wiggled his eyebrows.
ten minutes ago!”
"I'll be there."
“Then, we get back to school after summer break, and like after a month, she starts talking to me again. She tells me that she and her boyfriend broke up and she wants ‘a friend’,” Dean continues, using air quotes on the last words. “So I’m like, yeah sure, and we catch up and start talking and hanging out and everything, and one night she was at my house and uhh...well we ended up making out. I sorta thought it was going to be a one-time thing...but it wasn’t. So I eventually asked her out officially, and she agreed.”
. He did it.
“So...the same boyfriend who made out with three other guys during the last half of our set?” Dean asked. Castiel took a step back.
He went to go brush his teeth, and as he passed the bed, Dean called out, “you’re not gonna come cuddle?”
The losing team hung their heads and grabbed a shot glass, grimacing before the drinks were even poured. They clinked their glasses together, Gabriel joining in even though his team emerged victorious (
“I’m ready,” he said before ripping it open and rolling it onto Dean’s swollen dick. He didn’t even give Dean time to process it before sinking down on him.
“You’re more than welcome to stay in my guest room. Gabriel will be crashing on the couch, though, and I have to warn that he likes to play pranks, especially in the morning,” Charlie cautioned. Castiel laughed as he pictured what his coworker might get up to in just a few short hours. Dean stumbled over and threw his arm around Castiel.
Castiel was glued to his chair, unable to move or speak. He had no idea what was coming next. For once in his short time around Naomi, he had no comeback. No one-liner. No defense.
"Who the hell do you think you are, calling my mother a hypocrite?" He asked lowly.
Dean stripped Castiel of his underwear, leaving his ass out in the open. Dean knelt down, kneading Cas’ cheeks in his hands. Without warning, Dean bit the flesh of Cas’ ass, sucking the soft skin and running his tongue over the teeth marks. Cas yelped, but it turned into a groan as Dean worked a hickey onto his ass.
Castiel grabbed fistfuls of Dean’s open button-down to steady himself as he walked backwards towards the bedroom. The shorter man actually giggled when he nearly tripped over an imaginary bump in the hallway. Dean caught him, wrapping an arm around his back and halting their progress as Cas caught his balance. He filled the time by leaning in to plant a solid kiss to Cas’ lips.
“I mean, it’s her house, so I think she should get the armchair,” Dean reasoned, scratching the back of his neck. Castiel agreed and the two boys sat down on the loveseat. Charlie walked in with two bowls of popcorn; one for herself, and one for the boys to share. She smiled when she saw that they had decided to sit next to each other.
“Jesus, Dean,” he whispered to himself. He placed his hand over his thumping heart. It looked as though the physics teacher made it through the motions of going to bed; that is to say, he at least took off the clothes he had gone to the party in.
That was not the case. If anything, he'd gotten worse.
“Yeah, Dean.” Gabe parroted as he sauntered into the room. “I’m just kidding, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He said as he plopped down on the recliner.
“I am,” Bartholomew said. Castiel slowly let out a breath, his brow remaining dry for the time being. He didn’t know what he would’ve done if his father had planned to be home all weekend. “You’re not planning on throwing a party while we’re out of town, are you?” Bartholomew joked. Castiel laughed a bit nervously.
Castiel opened the drawer and reached all the way to the back, continuing his story, “you said I would talk about getting surprised with the question,” he stated, his hand slowly withdrawing from the drawer. Dean’s heartbeat picked up at the thought of what Cas might be retrieving.
This was it.
“We’ll talk later. Go to your room,” he instructed, his tone defeated. Castiel did as he was told and went to his room.
half of the time. What was his alternative? He knew teenagers were a handful, and it was easier - more
“You’re so rude,” she complained, “never let me have any fun.”
“Ok...but I want it on record that you’re the one who turned my appreciation down.”
in Dean's ear. Dean let a few tears of sheer relief slide down his cheek even as Cas was kissing him, thanking him for the present. They broke apart and Dean wasn't too surprised to see a couple tears on Cas's face as well.
“About that...could that wait? It’s a delicate situation and-”
Before Cas could reach the car door, Bart caught up and stopped his son.
“Right,” he agreed. After what seemed like minutes, Castiel finally blinked and slid off the bed, scouring the floor for his discarded clothing. He picked up his shirt and grimaced, recognizing it as the piece of clothing they used to clean up their
“Then why do you care?” Charlie asked. Dean had been expecting support from Charlie. A hype man, someone to agree with him and back up his theories. He had not expected this. Then again, Charlie rarely told him what he
Castiel didn't particularly want to go out that night.
Cas mediated.
"Well, only the name partners and Donna know that he's a fraud, and he's really good at what he does, so they don't want to loose him. Plus, he had a friend hack into the system and make it look like he passed the bar. And, I'm sure a photographic memory really helps this kid out."
many details, “well, we said ‘I love you’.” Charlie squealed.
"Well, your youngest son is not worthy of such a name. Especially if it was given to him by a hypocrite!" She said.
“Call me when you arrive in hick town,” Balthazar said as a figure passed Castiel’s room and entered the master bedroom.
“Hey,” he called out to them. The stranger looked up to identify where the noise had come from. “Can I borrow your phone?” Cas slurred. They looked Cas up and down and hesitantly agreed, hoping Castiel was going to use it to call a ride. The drunk teen clutched the phone and entered one of the three numbers he knew by heart. It rang five times before the person on the other line picked up.
"I'm not leaving him," Cas said quietly, but firmly.
“Cas, you're scaring me,” Dean said. Enraged blue eyes met terrified green ones. Castiel blinked once, twice, finally the anger seeped out in the form of tears.
He made a beeline for the back door, disregarding anyone or anything that tried to stop him. He made his way towards the park, and that’s all he could remember before passing out.
“Let’s take this back to Charlie’s place. I’d hate to miss the show. Charlie’s dad piles us on to her boat and we watch the fireworks from the water as they set ‘em off on the big island,” Dean said, excitement lighting up his eyes.
Castiel opened his duffle bag while Dean rummaged through his drawers for some pajamas.
“And now I’m here,” Castiel finished, taking a deep breath. The room was silent for a few moments. Cas couldn’t stand the quiet, so he filled the silence himself.
seems to be pretty decent at these games. You? Not so much,” Gabe taunted.
from his mother.
“Yes, you will. You played wonderfully tonight, Castiel. I do hope you choose to return next time.”
Cas laughed when he found Dean’s contact.
him, but he figured it wouldn’t be the worst way to go. He was 17, a senior in high school, and ready to have some fun if it killed him.
"I'm ready Dean, just fuck me please." Dean doesn't need to be told twice and he removes his fingers, causing Cas to whine at the loss of contact.
“You need to quit doing that,” Castiel demanded. At least it kept him from going down the stairs.
"Suits," Dani supplies.
“I’ll let that one slide,” she said with a wink. How on earth could she admonish him at a time like this? “You can get that stuff later. Tonight, your main priority is your health. She got you pretty good,” Mary placed a hand on Cas' good side of his head and examined the wounds more closely, “I’m assuming this was Naomi’s work.”
“My turn,” he stated, starting by stroking Dean a few times with his hand.
"Think, Winchester." Dean said to himself while he was working on the underside of a car.
Castiel scoffed, smile still plastered to his face, “Mr. Winchester? Sure, he’s hot, but have you seen the way he eats? A complete neanderthal if you ask me,” this time, it was Dean’s turn to scoff.
to recode every
Just a couple things I wanted to say before this chapter...
“You guys are...are getting a divorce?” Castiel asked. Out of all the things his father could have said, he certainly was not expecting that. Bart nodded solemnly, and Castiel really had to restrain himself from letting out a whoop of victory.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m so sorry,” Bart whispered. Before long, two more sets of arms joined in on the hug and all four of them stood there for a long beat. Eventually, they disbanded and returned to their seats, all four of them thinking about the day that lied ahead.
The teen pulled his clothes on and headed upstairs to the kitchen. Maybe a steaming cup of hot chocolate would put him in a better mood. He went about preparing his drink, pulling a mug from the cupboard.
“I-” Dean cut himself off rather abruptly, “am just excited to see your house,” he said. He gave a quick peck to Cas' lips before exiting his room and bounding up the stairs.
As they made the quick drive back to Dean’s place, they noticed the snow starting to come down heavier and pile up on the ground. Balthazar’s anti lock brakes kicked in at one of the stop signs and he nearly slid through it.
“Yeah.”
“Oh, well, have a safe trip home. Let one of us know when you make it.”
He filled up the cup and returned to Cas' room.
“Castiel, sweety, can you hear me?” she asked. The boy nodded minutely. “Do you know what day it is?”
“I don’t know. What if you really mess up his car?” Jo asked.
“I know I am,” Dean replied saucily, winking at his boyfriend when they made eye contact.
for me?” Castiel laughed bitterly. “You know, I have half a mind to return your favor,” he said, referencing his rapidly blackening eye. He turned towards the house and went back inside, leaving his ‘best friend’ out in the cold.
“I’m still not understanding why you’re all up in arms about this,” Charlie said.
Castiel broke down crying. He couldn’t even hold his phone. He let it drop to the bed before he contracted even further into himself. He heard Dean’s voice faintly from where his phone had landed. Castiel grabbed a pillow and sobbed into it.
"Ow."
"Oh, sweetheart, what happened? Was it Naomi? Did you fight? Are you hurt? Have you eaten lately? I'm going to go make some soup, ok?" Mary asked in rapid succession. Castiel would've laughed if he wasn't so wound up. She left the room and hurried upstairs to make Castiel some comfort food. Dean kept Cas close, running a hand up and down his back.
“Oh, so the school can call my dad or Naomi and then they send Michael out here to find out why I didn’t go to school? I don’t think so. Nothing is getting in the way of my party tomorrow night,” Balthazar put up his hands in defeat and let Castiel lead them up the stairs.
“And you’ve done a
“I’m sorry, but Naomi won’t be happy if I stay out too long,” Castiel said, only telling a half-lie. Technically, he was supposed to be staying over at Kevin’s, but on any other given Friday night, she would be up his ass about getting home at a decent time.
the burgers Dean made them just because they had mustard on them! Eventually, they reached an agreement, and Dean was more conscious of his mess, while Castiel made an effort to remain open to trying new things.
“What?” Cas asked in regards to Dean’s reaction.
“You’re acting weird,” Castiel pointed out.
“Holy shit, Cas,” Dean breathed out, keeping his hand tangled in that dark, unruly mop. Cas responded by opening up Dean’s mouth, their tongues meeting like a drop of water meets a still lake, sending ripples through both of them. Dean tugged Cas' hair again.
“I’m sure that’s not true-” the boys said in unison.
Dean mustered up his courage and looked at Cas. He pulled himself together and said what he needed to say.
Castiel was hyper aware of Joseph’s hands teasing the hem of Castiel’s shirt.
Dean pulled up in front of Cas' house, figuring it would be easier for Cas to sneak back in from the front of the house, rather than the park behind it. Castiel muttered a quiet thank you and got out of the car. Dean watched him begin to climb the tree and pulled away, heading back towards Charlie’s house.
“Oh, yeah it’s...nice. The building is certainly intriguing, I’m a bit of a history buff, actually, so I’ll be excited to learn more about Middlefield’s history,” Castiel said, relaxing a bit as he thought about what secrets this building might have.
“Oh, sweetie, come here,” Mary said, standing up and holding her arms out. Castiel obeyed and entered the hug. He was ashamed, but also relieved after getting all of that off his chest. “You can always come here if she locks you out,” Mary said, “hell, you can come here if she looks at you the wrong way."
In the past three weeks, Cas and Dean had gone on four official dates and texted each other constantly. Castiel even persuaded Dean into downloading snapchat, a feat in which Charlie was genuinely impressed.
"I grew up Seattle, but I haven't been there since I graduated high school. What about you? Where are you from?"
“Gee, thanks,” Castiel replied sarcastically. “There was this one kid in my computer class that was...interesting,” Castiel told his friend with a laugh.
. I think he tolerated me because Castiel told him to or something,” he speculated.
be ok.
“You lied? Why?” Bartholomew asked.
The rest of the day was spent cuddling, whispers of
"Bless you."
“Mmm, this is gonna be so good.” Cas said. After a bit, Dean added a second finger to stretch Cas open. By the time Dean added a third finger, Cas was growing impatient. He pushed Dean on his back with his good hand and climbed on top of him. He lined up with Dean’s cock and slowly sunk down on it.
The next day, after having breakfast with Balthazar and his father, Castiel started the long journey home.
“I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” Dean retorted, taking back to kissing Cas again.
“Look, Cas, I don’t have time right now.” He said before turning back and pushing his cart towards checkout, last items be damned.
“Yeah, go ahead,” Dean said, grabbing the box of pasta and pouring it into the pot. He heard the door to their bathroom close and let out a deep breath. He needed to get his plan set in motion.
“Hey,” Dean replied, not looking up from his screen. Castiel made his way over to the bed and laid down, Dean’s laptop resting between them. He reached out and ran his hand through Dean’s hair. They laid there silently, watching the show. After the episode ended, Dean sighed.
"As much as that would please me, I have other plans for tonight," Cas said, climbing off of Dean and into the closet.
"How 'bout we bet on it?" Dean asked with a glint in his eyes.
“How about you?” Cas asked, “is anything wrong with you?”
By the time he got home, he was pushing a quarter til seven. It took a little over twenty minutes to get to Charlie’s house, so he resigned himself to being fashionably late. He gathered up all the grocery bags from the trunk and made it up to the apartment in one trip. By the time he laid the bags on the kitchen floor, he was out of breath. That had not been an easy journey.
"Mm, but wait. I thought I was just a
About thirty minutes later, Castiel was in his own room after having completed the scan. He was still unconscious, but the three Winchesters were keeping him company anyway.
Dean grabbed the back of his neck nervously before replying, “I don’t know. I don’t really celebrate it.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and turned to Dean. “Really? Me and Benny? You’re worried about that?” he asked teasingly, his eyebrows reaching towards his hairline. Dean blushed further and brought his hand to the back of his neck. Castiel crowded Dean against his car and took his hands. Benny took that as his cue to leave, and headed back to the bar.
“Your stupid prank!”
Sam stood there, fear in his eyes.
if I get stuck with this? We are married, Bartholomew, this won’t reflect well on you, either.”
When they pulled up to the building, Dean stuck out his hand for Balthazar to shake, “Thanks for listening to me, man. I just needed to yell about it a little bit. ‘M sorry I drank your booze. I can make it up to you,” he apologized.
“And why is that?” Mary asked, genuine curiosity in her eyes.
“Holy shit, you’re gorgeous,” Dean said. Castiel smiled and blushed slightly. The dark haired boy pulled his boyfriend down by the back of the neck and kissed him.
“I’m so sorry. I shouldn't be putting Sam and Dean through all th-” Castiel’s apology was cut short.
"So...did you get laid?"
shit, huh? It wasn’t...like…
"Well... You know, with a baby it's hard to keep things-"
Faint music could be heard on top of the quiet hill. Dean approached the two on the bench with a smile.
"Ok, ok, gross. I regret asking," Charlie complained. They all laughed and carried on easy conversation for the rest of the evening. Around eleven, they called it a night and went to their respective homes.
Jo quickly caught onto the game and was president or Vice President almost every time. Everyone eventually became president at one point in their abundance of games.
“I was wondering what the dress code was for tomorrow night,” Dean asked, glancing at Cas.
Jo made an absolute fool of herself trying to get Balthazar to guess every word that popped up. Dean, coming off a bad day, was a bit too grumpy to be all that animated. All-in-all, it was a decent first turn, Balthazar correctly guessing seven animals. They handed off the phone to Charlie, and the other team took their places.
“This Saturday?” Dean asked. Charlie nodded her head enthusiastically. “As in two days from now?”
Every. Single. Sunday. She dragged him and his father to church
in my son’s phone?” he whispered sharply. Naomi brushed him off with a wave of her hand. Sam could not believe what he was hearing. He knew Cas’ mom...step-mom was strict. But a
“Uh, Cas?” Dean asked as he sat on a chair next to Cas’s hospital bed.
“Oh please,” Naomi sighed exasperatedly.
No, it
Castiel sat there for a long moment before he remembered the text. He picked up his phone and read it.
"So now we close doors?" Dean teased.
“Sorry, your royal highness,” Dean apologized sarcastically with a comical bow. Cas looked confused but chalked it up to an inside joke of theirs.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What?" Dean asks. Castiel just starts to giggle. "You little shit. What the hell did you do with them?" He says with a smile. Dean walks towards Cas, and when he gets to the dark haired man, he starts tickling his sides. Cas can't help but full out laugh as Dean closes in on him.
"I'm making spaghetti, it'll be done in about five minutes," he informed Cas.
Naomi rolled her eyes and crossed her arms in front of herself.
By the time he arrived, his mood had not improved. If anything, it had gotten worse because he had time to replay the night before repeatedly in his mind.
"I don't know, man. You seemed pretty trustworthy." Dean flashes a grin.
“I’ll be here all week.” Dean said. Cas laughed softly.
“Naomi, drop the act. We both know this isn’t the first time. It’s not just one mistake. I’ve been giving you the benefit of the doubt for long enough,” Bart told her. “I’m willing to put in the effort to make this work...but I’m not really the one that’s going to be doing the heavy-lifting.”
“Let me take you out for slushies,” Dean proposed. Castiel, after a moment of deliberation, agreed.
Castiel was awoken suddenly the next morning. His eyes flew open and the only thought in his head was “oh no”. He leaned over the side of the bed and threw up, cringing at the taste of his own vomit. He praised every deity he could think of that there was a trash can right next to the bed. He heaved a few more times and sighed deeply. When he felt stable enough, he pulled back from the side of the bed and sat up. He looked around and realized he was not in his own bedroom. He was in Dean’s. He looked to his right and was disappointed when he didn’t find Dean on the other half of the bed. There wasn’t even a trace that Dean had been in the bed at all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was still mad at Castiel. He was mad at him for blowing him off at school, for arguing with him when he was just trying to help, for bringing up his dad around drunk teenagers.
Castiel sighed and looked back up at the ceiling. He knew Dean would worry, but he was hoping to get a little bit more back-and-forth out of him before he actually had to talk.
Kudos and comments are welcomed.
“So, is it over or is there another...thingy?” Dean asked.
They shared a final hug before they exited the house Castiel had grown up in.
Before long, Castiel leaned up and pressed a soft kiss to Dean’s lips. After only a moment of hesitation, Dean kissed back.
Before long, they had stopped talking and moved on to...other things.
to do. If you want to see him, you're gonna have to wait," she told him sternly.
“I’m sorry about that, but Cas, I’m worried about you,” Dean said.
“Naomi,” Castiel whined.
On Monday, at school, Charlie seemed a bit less chipper than normal. Gabriel wandered into her classroom before school started, as he usually did, but she wasn’t responding the same to any of his jokes. He could usually at least get her to threaten him
“Well, then I guess I should get to it,” Dean gave a small smile and took Cas’s hands.
"Oh," Dean says, turning his attention to the screen. Who's the redhead?"
“Naomi...what, Castiel?” Bart prompted.
Castiel growled and flipped them over, covering Dean’s body with his own.
“You mean sex,” he said flatly. Sam’s blush only deepened. He nodded meekly, not looking Dean in the eye. The older brother laughed; he wasn’t quite sure how to approach this. Sam was only thirteen, afterall. It was Dean’s turn to tease his brother.
“Dean,” Castiel said in a gentle tone, reaching out slightly towards the bed.
Castiel was fuming. Who did she think she was, stomping around, treating Cas like that? He could deal with a few chores, but stooping so low as to compare him to
"Where's the bathroom?" He practically growled at his friend.
“What the hell took you so long?” Jo chimed in from the couch.
"Well go tell her I'll be right up, and keep your mouth shut about this," Dean said. Sam turned tail and did just that.
All in all, it
, and I don’t even get to see your entryway? That’s just not fair,” Dean persuaded.
“When Cas and I were chatting in the basement and I joked about the desserts, you told
that all about?” Dean cautioned. Castiel wanted to tell him, he really did, but he just couldn’t bring himself to recount those memories yet again. Castiel sighed and snuggled a bit closer to the warm body behind him.
Castiel watched Dean as he sat back down on the couch and pulled at his beer. The English teacher could tell his boyfriend was annoyed...maybe even mad. Cas knew Dean was probably upset with him about the laundry. He had completely forgotten to put in a load when he got home, and he remembered when he was about halfway to Charlie’s house. Dean
Castiel stepped out of the shower on December 28th and towelled off before entering Dean’s bedroom. This was the first shower he’d gotten to take since Christmas Eve, and he had enjoyed every second.
,” she said with a wink.
He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket and took it out.
“Castiel Novak?”
“Dean, I’m just trying to make you see a different perspective. What if Cas said all these things about me and Sam?”
“Yes, I remember” his father answered, blissfully unaware of the tension currently thickening between his sons, “what about it?”
“You broke my heart, Dean,” Castiel said. He had a lot of things he’s wanted to say to Dean for a long time. “You broke it and it didn’t even seem like you cared,” Dean flinched at the words. “Benny tried harder to save our relationship than you did.”
“Cassie, you blithering idiot,” Balthazar said. “I thought I wouldn’t have to give you a lecture on politeness but I guess I do. For starters, at least look at someone when they’re talking to you, especially your
“Ok. I suppose I can go...grab some breakfast,” he suggested to himself. Before he left, he put his hand on his son’s shoulder and said, “I’m here now, Castiel. Everything’s gonna be ok.”
“Don’t you fucking do that to me,” Dean said, exasperated with Cas’s recent behavior. They hadn’t had a real conversation in about a week.
“That was fun,” Cas said into Dean’s shoulder, “we should definitely do it again sometime.”
“Wow,” Dean said. If he was being honest, the thought of Cas and Balthazar dating had crossed his mind a few times; he’d just never expected for it to have actually happened. “How long ago was that?” Dean asked.
That was...when he went.
“Hello,” Castiel said in greeting, his voice not as strong as it was when he was talking to Mary. He dawdled over to where Dean was sitting at the foot of his bed, feeling less and less prepared for this conversation by the second. When Castiel finally made it, Dean stood from his bed and surprised Castiel by wrapping him in a tight hug. It only took a moment, but Cas was hugging back. They stood like that for a while.
“Water. And sticker! That’s what I’m talking about!” exclaimed Balthazar.
“When I saw you go into the room with Amara, I went upstairs to deliberately find Balthazar. I was dancing with him like that out of...revenge? God, I’m an idiot.”
“Wait a fucking minute!” Jo started, still processing what she had just witnessed.
“You gotta help me out. The girls rigged it so Dean had to give Castiel a ride the other day. We have to even the playing field!”
“Tha’s wha I ‘old ‘im.”
He cursed under his breath when he saw how busy it was. He had to park what felt like miles away from the entrance; the biting cold worsening his mood. He would’ve gone earlier in the week, but he hadn’t realized they were so close to being out of almost everything.
“How long are we going to be home alone?” Castiel asked.
He swung the door open, “Sorry, I was just…” The rest of his sentence was lost when he saw Dean standing there. Could his eyes possibly be that green? Cas fumbled a little, but caught up with himself.
"How about on the nightstand in our bedroom?" Dean looks at him for a second, then turns to head back upstairs. When Dean disappears up the staircase, Castiel giggles to himself. Dean comes back downstairs visibly frustrated.
“Get yourself together, man” he said aloud to himself.
“Hey,” Dean called for his attention. When they made eye contact again, he continued, “I thought it was very loyal how you told me off when you thought I was cheating. But I mean, I’d have to be pretty goddamn stupid to do that
“Castiel. It’s been three years,” Michael tried to reason.
“Because she demanded I clean up a mess I didn’t even make,” Castiel said indignantly. Bartholomew nodded at Castiel’s answer.
“Don’t!” Gabriel warned, sticking up a firm finger, deterring the other guests from recounting that night.
"Right there, Dean. Right fucking there!" Dean grins widely and keeps moving his fingers.
Within a few moments, Cas had three fingers in his fiancé, the man making the most beautiful noises from the head of the bed. Castiel peppered kisses along Dean’s stomach and thighs as he worked his digits in and out. When he decided the physics teacher was ready, he removed his hand completely, shifting to his knees.
“Well, you’re totally invited to the next one. Dean, too,” she said, tossing him a look as she made her way towards her own bedroom.
Three hours later and Cas was done for the day. He closed his laptop and sunk into the plush couch. His hands swept down his face, as if they were cleansing him of today’s stress. They weren’t.
Castiel hummed contentedly and he polished off his wine, setting his glass on the tray they had pulled over to set their spread on. He snuggled back into Dean, leaning his head on Dean’s shoulder. His boyfriend kissed his temple before setting his own empty glass on the tray.
"So, where are we going?" Cas asked.
“Oh, good. I thought it was Saturday for a little bit there. The summer bash I told you about is this weekend."
“Fuck! Cas! Holy-” Dean blabbered, thoughts jumbling together in his brain as Castiel kept up his ministrations. Castiel grinned as he slipped the first knuckle of his index finger into Dean’s eager hole. He ventured further, alternating attention between his hands and his mouth. When his index finger was fully inside Dean, he popped his mouth off with a lewd noise. Dean complained at the loss, but Castiel paid him no mind. Instead, he focused on opening Dean up, grabbing the lube to coat his fingers more generously.
“Castiel
“It’s in the garage,” he replied.
“At least let me look at you,” Dean pleaded. Castiel rolled his eyes in the reflection of the mirror, but conceded and walked into their bedroom. He raised the arm that wasn’t busy in a ‘you happy?’ gesture. Dean smiled and looked Cas up and down, admiring his boyfriend’s lean frame.
“I’ve been wearing them allllll day,” he practically purred, “feel so nice against my sensitive skin.” He palmed at his own cock, which was starting to peek out the top of the fabric. Castiel bit his bottom lip and let his own hand wander to his rapidly hardening dick. The older man knew showing up in a cowboy outfit was unfair to Dean, but he relished the looks his boyfriend threw his way. It was nice to be looked at like that every once in a while.
“I was meaning to ask you...what’s up with his step-mother...Naomi, is it?”
, the zipper. Castiel shivered slightly as the cool air hit his heated skin. Dean laughed as Cas' jeans got caught on his shoes. He slipped off the bed and removed Cas' shoes before unlacing his own. After that task was completed, he went back to taking off his boyfriend’s jeans. The boxers quickly followed, as Dean was becoming increasingly impatient. His eyes were fixed on the boy lying on the bed. The sight was absolutely breathtaking.
“You’re not the bad guy,” he assured her.
Balthazar signalled that “jump” was correct, and continued drawing.
"You wouldn't."
This wasn’t the first time Castiel had snuck out; but it
“Ohhhhh, fuck,” Dean’s eyes screwed shut. “De-depends on what I’m in the mood for,” he stuttered out, biting at his bottom lip. Castiel loved the way his boyfriend looked in this moment.
It was an existence Castiel could go his entire life without ever feeling again.
“Are you sure?” he asked. Castiel nodded his head, picking at a loose thread on his blanket. Bart scanned his son’s face and rose from his chair.
“What?” Dean asked.
"Balthazar, I hardly think this is necessary." Cas struggled halfheartedly as Balthazar dragged him over there.
It was only three o’clock so Dean decided to text Cas. He quietly made his exit to the back stairwell.
“Uhh,” Dean chimed in, “Sam overheard your dad and Naomi talking in the lobby a little bit ago. He said she mentioned a tracking device?”
“So how’d you hear about the party?” Dean asked.
playing out in Cas' mind. He tried to just close his eyes and hope for the fantasy to follow him into his dreams, but apparently he got a little too carried away.
Balthazar asked, realizing he’d have to take matters into his own hands.
“Oh, Castiel, could you take these downstairs?” she asked, more as a command than a question, but Castiel wasn’t going to be bothered tonight. He went over and grabbed the bags before lugging them down the stairs.
“It was alright,” he said, disappearing into the hallway. Dean pocketed his phone and gathered up the ingredients for spaghetti. He also preheated the oven so they could have fresh-baked rolls.
“Ok,” Dean said, “I’m sticky,” he announced, sitting up to head towards the bathroom. “Shower?” he asked. Castiel nodded and followed his boyfriend into the bathroom.
Dean, true to his word, wore a long sleeve shirt to work the following morning. The marks on his wrists had faded slightly, but they were still noticeable. He decided to feign exhaustion and hide in his bed.
“I assume Dean went home...have you seen Balthazar?” Castiel asked. Charlie shook her head.
Dean recoiled from Mary like she had burned him.
“I-I don’t know. Maybe you got tired of being a secret?” Castiel chanced, biting his lower lip.
Once he was finished, he turned the bathroom light off and got under the covers with Dean. The loser of last night’s festivities snuggled up to his boyfriend, laying his head down on Cas’ chest.
“Plus, your names are both Sam!” Dean was truly loving this.
“He is,” Castiel agreed. Dean scoffed in mock offense and bumped Cas’ hip with his own. “What? It’s true!” the English teacher defended. Dean rolled his eyes.
...and only 8 chapters to get to the smut
With trembling hands, Sam started the car and pulled out of the park, stopping and starting very harshly.
“I know it’s not my fault. It was a really shitty thing that
The band started with a song Castiel didn’t recognize. They must’ve written it after he stopped listening to their music. The acoustic guitar strummed and the piano sprinkled in here and there. Instead of drums, the members who weren’t playing yet started clapping rhythmically.
Five uneventful hours later, Dean was on his way to Cas’s apartment. He shot off a warning text to Cas so he could let him in. When he arrived at Cas’s door, we was greeted with a deep kiss and pulled through a barren apartment to Cas’s bedroom. Dean quickly got rid of his shoes and discarded his uniform pants. Cas slid under the covers and pulled Dean with him to use as a pillow.
“Well, yeah. So the day passes, and I’m like…laundry needs- oh yeah! The fucking- you saw my dumbass socks last night! Squirrels? What the hell? Anyway, I planned-I fucking
“We are. I didn’t mean to-I...I’m sorry, Dean. It’s just...I’m getting a sense of deja vu and I really don’t want to go through that again.”
“So I guess we’ll just keep it under wraps,” Dean said. Castiel looked up and smiled. Dean smiled back.
“You wish you were as good as me at pack-man,” Cas replied under his breath.
“No shit?” Dean exclaimed, “well, that’s...good. Right?”
“Don’t,” she warned sharply. The couple sat in the car for a long stretch of silence before Bart spoke up again.
“Well, shit, you know who’s pretty?” Dean asked. Balthazar shook his head through another laugh. According to his GPS, they should be getting to Dean’s place fairly soon.
“I have to go back into work at six thirty.” Cas said. Dean furrowed his brow.
“I love you,” Dean said softly. Castiel smiled in the dark.
Dean laughed and ran his fingers up and down Cas’s back.
"What?" She spat, glaring into his eyes.
my choice. It’s yours! I don’t think she should get away with this.”
With that, Castiel and Bartholomew were left alone.
like that,” Dean shot back.
Cas looked at the clock. It was almost five in the morning.
Not a second later, Cas was aware of pain on his left cheek. He put a hand across it to soothe the sting. "
Mary leveled a glare laced with fondness. She wouldn’t outright agree with her son calling himself an idiot...but he was a seventeen-year-old boy.
“I love you, too.”
“I thought you hated spending any more time than strictly necessary here,” the little brother said as they got out of the car.
"Really?"
parents failed at that,” Castiel retorted. He meant it, but he really probably shouldn’t have said it.
“Call it wishful thinking,” Dean replied breathlessly. Cas licked a long stripe up the underside of Dean’s cock, causing the taller man to moan in pleasure. The dark haired man swallowed Dean down without warning and set a relentless pace, using his hand to cover what his mouth couldn’t reach.
“Cas, hey-”
Dean sighed once more. They really had been dragging this out for quite some time. He had an idea on how to end it so that everyone who had bet on them (for or against) would eat their words. He just needed a little extra time. And he couldn’t have Balthazar flirting with his boyfriend.
throws chapter at you and runs away
Dean didn’t comment as he made his way towards their bedroom. He shut the door behind him, and Castiel cursed as he let out a deep sigh. He returned to the kitchen to collect all of the plastic bags and shove them into another plastic bag which he shoved in the cabinet under the sink.
“And we pick…” Castiel weighed the pros-and-cons and ultimately decided, “Charlie and Jo.” The ladies were shocked that they paired them up. “Look, we weren’t gonna let one of you go up against Dean alone,” Cas explained. Dean protested while the girls nodded their heads in understanding.
“You’re right,” Dean said simply as he made his way out of the breakroom.
“So, what? Is he too
“Alright,” Charlie announced, “since it’s Balthazar’s game, his team gets to go first.”
says you can’t beat me in the next game,” Gabriel wagered, sticking out his hand hopefully. Dean rolled his eyes, but clasped his hand in Gabriel’s, effectively putting their wager into action. He couldn't believe he let the man influence him so easily. Maybe the alcohol was clouding his judgement more than he thought. Before long, the buzzer went off, and they went to count the pieces.
Dean raised an eyebrow and shrugged a shoulder before replying, “maybe you shouldn’t break the rules by showing up in an undiscussed costume.” Castiel smirked at his own mischief.
“Damn, our childhoods kind of sucked,” Castiel said, trying to crack a joke. He sniffled and idly picked at a loose thread on the hem of Dean’s shirt.
“Let’s just say I had a very good cup of coffee,” He said, closing his eyes and grinning wide, imagining said
"C'mon, I'm gonna be late. And just think, in two months, my schedule changes from full day shifts starting at five to full day shifts starting at nine." He said, managing to slip out of Cas's embrace. He hated that he had to, but there was a duty he needed to serve. He hopped in the shower and washed off any proof of their Saturday wrapped around each other. He cursed that this was a Sunday-On week. Another day in bed with Cas would've been amazing.
“Don’t mention it,” she said, “on second thought, mention it as much as you want,” she added with a wink. Cas smiled and took another bite of his burger. “So what even happened?” she asked, wanting to hear his side of the story. Castiel rolled his eyes.
The taller man’s deft fingers quickly undid the button and fly of Cas’s jeans. Dean sat back on his heels and pulled Cas’s jeans down. His erection clearly showed as a tent in Castiel’s gray boxers. Dean could feel himself harden a little more of that were at all possible. Cas sat up on his elbows and looked at Dean.
“I’m sorry. There’s a lot on my mind,” Castiel apologized.
“Dean-o, what’s crackalackin’?”
"Way to fuck up, Winchester." Dean growled at himself before laying on the couch and shoving his face into the pillow. He took a deep breath. It smelled like Cas.
now!” Naomi yelled twenty minutes later as she walked up the stairs yet again. She pushed open his door and found him lying on his bed, consumed entirely by his laptop. She marched over to him and yanked out the earbuds.
"Don't
"Is it five? Hmm..hey, I'm off in half an hour." She smiled and continued doing whatever it is she does on her computer all day. Dean scoffed and swiped the remote off of the coffee table. He clicked on the news and promptly dozed off.
Anyway, I hope you liked this chapter, I believe things are coming to a close
“It’s not
“Pshh,” Gabriel took another sip of his margarita, “we’re playing charades! What a cliche!” he complained.
“Oh, Cas, right?” Charlie asked as she sat next to Dean. “Nice hickeys, dude.”
“C’mon, Gabe, they’re winning!” Jo yelled. Their team trailed three to six.
“Caasssss,” Dean hissed, unable to run his hands through his boyfriend’s hair. Castiel paused his task of opening Dean up in favor of kissing him soundly.
“I’ll see you tomorrow at Charlie’s,” Cas said, closing his door and starting up his car.
going to mass anymore. I call that a fair price to pay," Cas explained.
Here you have it ladies, gentlemen, and those who have yet to make up their mind: the final chapter. Thank you to everyone who stuck with me as I wrote this! (and sorry again for the very infrequent updates)
“Yeah, as far as we know, this could be the most exciting night yet,” Castiel defended, clinking his wine glass against Balthazar’s. The brit gave him somewhat of a weird look, one that said
“Oh, yes! Because Michael’s your favorite and I pale in comparison to everything he's done! I'm not allowed to make a few mistakes because you swooped in
After Castiel had calmed down a bit, Dean spoke up.
“That is not true!” Naomi argued.
"When I was eight, my parents threw this huge forth of July party. Like,
?” she asked. Dean blushed and quickly brought his hand up to conceal the marks. Sam snorted, but tried to cover it up with a cough. Dean glared at him.
She smiled at him. "Good answer,” she said. They went back to easy conversation until Dean was honorably discharged from his watery hell. He spotted them and made his way up to their bench. Most of the games were finishing up to get ready for the dance and fireworks. It wasn’t a summer bash without fireworks.
With that, he was off to work.
"Suits. It's a really good lawyer show and the actors are really cute." Dani says, never taking her eyes off of the screen.
“Hey, Balthazar,” he greeted, unease about how this was going to go settling in his stomach.
After Castiel had been fed, he, Dean, and Mary retired to the living room. There, he relayed his story. The Winchesters were patient with him. They didn’t press for more details; they just sat with him and listened. Castiel had almost forgotten what that was like. Part of him thought this family was a figment of his imagination, that he had dreamt them up as some sort of...coping mechanism. But, as Dean squeezed his hand, he was reminded that they were here for him, in more ways than one.
Dean explained.
“In here,” came his boyfriend’s voice from behind him. Castiel jumped minutely at the sudden noise. He turned as Dean’s figure disappeared just around the edge of the bedroom door. He collected himself and took a few deep breaths to calm down. He told himself that this wasn’t the end of the world, and that one day, they would look back on this and laugh. Yeah, that worked about as well as he had expected.
“Oh, you knew about the bets?” Gabriel asked, looking sheepish.
“Castiel! Bedtime!” Naomi shouted down the stairs. Castiel looked at the clock and his jaw dropped.
"He is all I need." Cas says into Dean's chest, approximately quoting the song from earlier.
to me?” Castiel asked.
Dean tried to do as the voice said. He managed to stop panicking.
When Castiel heard the front door open and a voice call out, his heart beat started racing. He recognized that voice. When the boy attached to that voice reached the bottom of the stairs and peeked into the den, Castiel willed himself not to look right away. When he finally did turn around, though, he was thoroughly disappointed. Of course Dean had brought Charlie home again. On a friday. When he didn’t think anyone would be home. Was the world really this cruel?
answer that,” Mary warned her youngest. Sam rolled his eyes and folded his arms across his chest.
“So, apparently Jo is busy tomorrow night. Is it possible that we could do Game Night tonight instead? I asked Gabriel and he said he was in if everyone else was,” she explained. Balthazar sucked in a hesitant breath as he seemed to make calculations in his mind.
“C’mon. Wave? Sardines? Cops and Robbers?
After a while, Mary called out that breakfast was served. They had to redistribute some of the food, since Sam had only been expecting four people, not five. It wasn’t too much of a hassle and before long, they were all seated around the table, passing the maple syrup around and digging into breakfast.
The next incident occurred a couple weeks later. Cas and Dean were somewhat successful in fending off Charlie’s attempts to get them ‘together’, and they’d built up a bit of a reputation as begrudging coworkers. However, there was a new rumor floating around the teacher’s lounge about the “sexual tension”. They may have gotten a little carried away with the fake-enemies plot when Halloween rolled around and the staff and students were encouraged to show up in costume.
After making a substantial amount of hickeys, Dean pulled Cas’s face up to his and kissed him. Dean slid on the couch so he was laying down and Cas was on top of him. They kissed slowly and Dean snuck his hands under Cas’s shirt. Soon, Cas’s shirt was removed, leaving him in just his sweat pants. Dean slid his hands to Cas’s ass.
“We really should’ve just let them team up,” Sam observed, coming to stand next to Charlie.
“Dean told me the same thing.”
Only then did it hit him.
Curse Dean Winchester's heavy sleeping.
“For what?” he laughed, rubbing his hand up and down Cas' back. Castiel just shook his head.
It was modest, comparatively to the one Naomi had bought. Only one master bedroom in this one. That was on the ground floor along with the kitchen, dining room, living room, and office. They had a walk-out basement with two bedrooms, Castiel choosing the one with the bigger closet (he had gotten used to having two walk-ins to himself).
“You don’t know that. What if we had moved out to Chicago right after your father’s accident? What if all he saw was the fighting between us? We weren’t necessarily winning any awards for ‘functional family’ back then. He might’ve thought exactly what you’re thinking right now,” she reached out and put a hand on her son’s shoulder, “Dean, what Castiel needs right now is support. Not someone trying to tear his family apart even more.”
Enjoy!
"Come on, Cassie, live a little."
He knocked on the bathroom door quietly. If he were to have his way, he would’ve pounded on the door just to give Cas a hard time with his hangover, but Dean’s family was still asleep, and it needed to stay that way. Dean heard a gruff reply that was more of a grunt than any actual words. After a moment, Castiel opened the door.
“Forget it,” Castiel said, standing up and heading towards the stairs.
When they arrived at the house, Naomi having moved out (for the most part), Castiel decided that he would finally reach out to Balthazar. He’d chickened out of talking to him until now, but with the hearing over, Castiel had no real reason to keep putting this off.
“Charlie?” he yelled over the whirr of the vacuum. The redhead looked up as Castiel came into her line of vision. She turned off the machine and smiled at her friend.
“I believe Mr. Winchester has an explanation for you,” he said, giving the floor to the physics teacher. Dean grabbed the back of his neck and chuckled nervously.
(See the end of the chapter for
something he could do about Naomi. But why did
“Oh,” Dean realized, “I tried to talk to him this morning and I grabbed his arm to make him stay in the room with me. Then I literally said the word ‘control’, Jesus Christ,” Dean said. He laughed at how wrong he went about that conversation.
Once they reconvened, they decided that Charlie’s team would kick off this category. It appeared to be a little tougher, Charlie only managing to guess seven before the time ran out.
“Don’t,” Cas cut off, muffled slightly. Dean waited for a few moments, expecting Castiel to go on. He weighed in his mind the pros and cons of talking to Cas right now. On the one hand, he really wanted to explain himself. He had no idea what Cas and Balthazar talked about on the patio, and he needed to make sure his boyfriend wasn’t seriously angry with him. On the other hand, Cas had said that he felt cornered by Balthazar, and that their conversation didn’t go well. Dean decided that patience was probably the best course of action at the moment.
"There's a man on the third floor, we have to get him."
Soon enough, Castiel’s birthday came and went mostly undetected (only a “happy birthday” from his father, and a gift from Balthazar in the mail), and his junior year of high school came to a close.
“I didn’t say who they were for,” Dean replied cheekily. Cas sat back on his knees, putting some much needed space between himself and his lover.
“Does this mean I can go out?” Castiel chanced.
Balthazar instructed before hanging up.
“I’m sorry, but she lied. Castiel is in the hospital and he needs your help, but Naomi
“Does that feel good, baby?” Dean breathed out.
“What do you think?” Cas replied roughly, slowly grinding up and down on Dean, relieving the tiniest bit of pressure building up between them. It was Dean’s turn to let out a long moan. Without slowing his hips, Cas attached his lips to Dean’s neck in a place he knew Dean wasn’t going to be able to cover up. Dean was too caught up in the feeling to even care. After Cas completed his claiming mark on his boyfriend’s neck, he moved down to his collar bones, sucking at those for what felt like hours.
He punctuated that statement by going into a coughing fit.
Castiel was just content to lie there and kiss Dean until the cows came home. He missed this more than he thought he would. It had been so long since the couple had been alone together like this. Castiel ran his hands through Dean’s hair as the other boy shifted to lie on top of him. Castiel smiled and they continued on like that for a while. Long, slow kisses with no end in sight, each selfishly taking what they had been wanting for weeks now. Castiel could live a hundred lives just doing this.
“‘Pull-cri-
“Um, yeah I think so. I’ll have to ask Naomi,” Cas replied. Dean nodded his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
gave Castiel that hickey?”
“Yeah, kinda like you did,” Cas shot back. And, ok...that was a fair shot. Dean thought for a moment before speaking again.
“Wrists.”
“Being punished? It fucking sucks,” Dean said, scrunching his face up in a mixture of disgust and confusion. It’s not like getting your prized possession taken away from you was a fun experience.
us,” Dean said.
“I told you that I wasn’t going to participate in your perverted betting pool,” Balthazar defended.
Castiel stood up abruptly and stalked to his room, slamming the door in a moment of childish anger. He fell back on the bed and put his headphones back in.
He went back to the bathroom and showered himself, having to use the slightly damp towel Dean had just used. As he dried off, he heard the timer for the washing machine go off, and he went to throw that load into the dryer. He passed the couch on his way and noticed a pillow and a blanket had been tossed on top of it.
“What are you doing?” Naomi asked as she entered the kitchen from the garage. Castiel rolled his eyes, safely hidden behind one of the pantry doors.
They forewent pajamas, Dean cuddling up against Castiel’s back.
Charlie seemed to consider this, and ultimately agreed that she could suffer being partnered with Gabriel so long as they finally got Dean and Castiel together tonight. The host pulled down two wine glasses from the cabinet and filled them generously. She raised it towards Jo and toasted, “to winning this bet.”
The English teacher ran his fingertips up and down Dean’s back, letting himself get lost in the motion. He was encouraged at Dean’s pleased hums. The pair lay like that for a while, Castiel continuing his gentle strokes as Dean snored softly on his chest.
"Cassie, what are you staring at?" Balthazar said, snapping at Cas to get his attention. He tracked his friend’s gaze and his eyes landed on the blond man. "Mm, he’s quite handsome." Then it hit Cas.
“I suppose we should head to the gym?” Charlie checked her own phone for the time and nodded. She stood up, drained the rest of her coffee, and placed her mug in the sink.
"I need you to go faster, Dean" Cas pants, making a grab for Dean's hand. Dean laces their fingers together and picks up the pace, quickly snapping his hips in and out of Cas. Dean reaches down with his free hand and jacks Cas in time with his relentless thrusts.
“Did you two just...are you...what?” Charlie stammered. The couple beamed as wave after wave of confusion crashed down around their friends.
“We haven’t, uh,” Castiel cleared his throat, “haven’t been intimate in a while.”
“Naomi…” he started, nervously looking at the other occupants in the room. He wasn’t ready to relive it. He wasn’t ready to admit what happened. He still wasn’t entirely sure it did happen.
Castiel eyed the rest of the options and easily declared, “Balthazar.” The brit smiled at him, and his boyfriend threw him a glare. Castiel had to bite back a smile as Jo and Charlie whispered conspiratorially about who they would pick for their team.
him. There was nothing he could have done about her.
“So I’m not your first boyfriend,” Dean said more than he asked.
the bad guy,” she deflected. Bartholomew descended the rest of the stairs to comfort his wife.
here all night. He grabbed a spoon out of the drawer and booked it out of the kitchen.
“Why didn’t you tell us?” Jo asked, “we could’ve brought cake or something.”
“I like him,” Charlie said to herself, “now I know at least
“So...what happened to Naomi?” Charlie asked.
“Here,” he offered an object in his hand.
“Oh please, call me Naomi,” she offered, a smile on her lips. Dr. Andrews nodded.
“Hey, Castiel, do you want to hang out with Sam and me for a while? We were gonna go to his house and watch movies,” he proposed.
do you think you are to even have a say in who I date?”
“I love you, too,” he replied, kissing Dean’s neck. They stayed like that for a while, their bones too much like jelly to even think about standing. Dean played with Cas' hair as Cas teased one of Dean’s nipples by grazing over it with his thumb. The boys were something they hadn’t been for a while: content. Between Cas' episode in September, and Dean’s outburst at the party, they’d been a little strained. But now, with everything out in the open, they were finally able to completely relax around each other.
Dean read the text and grimaced. It was a pretty awful move, but Dean needed a viable reason as to why Balthazar would abruptly stop flirting with Castiel, other than the fact that the man knew the object of his flirtation was in a relationship...with Dean.
“I like the way you think,” Dean said, attaching his lips to Cas’ neck. Castiel laughed and pushed Dean off of him before grabbing his hand and dragging him to the bedroom.
“I love you, too,” Dean responded again, gathering Castiel in his arms and holding him close.
“It happened five
“Yes, please,” he replied. Castiel placed a kiss upon his forehead before slipping out of bed to complete the task. Dean silently admired the dark mark on Castiel’s ass cheek as he walked into the bathroom.
“Can...can you turn on the TV or something? It’s really quiet in here,” Castiel asked. Mary reached for the remote and turned it on, reducing the volume slightly so they could still talk. He thanked her.
“Of course, my mind wasn’t the only thing that wandered,” Cas said, punctuating his admission by placing his hand on Dean’s thigh, slowly creeping closer and closer until....
Bartholomew looked as if he were about to argue, but instead he lifted his hands in surrender and made his exit. As soon as the door clicked shut behind him, Castiel broke down in tears.
“Is everything ok?” Dean asked. Castiel noticed five (that’s right
When they were all back in the living room, Balthazar and Castiel with a glass of wine each, Jo and Dean with a beer, and Gabriel with god-knows-what in the red solo cup he found god-knows-where, the host stood up and explained the first game.
“You have beautiful eyes.” Cas said. Dean smiled and ran his fingers through Cas’s hair.
“Hello again, Charlie. Yeah, he’s in his room,” Mary directed. She shut the door behind Charlie and returned to the kitchen.
“How the hell was I supposed to guess ‘Grape Stomping’ when it looked like you were doing an Irish jig?” the host complained. Gabriel shrugged his shoulders as Castiel was laughing too hard to give her an answer. She wasn’t wrong; they had looked ridiculous.
“What’s the use?” Dean asked, “I mean, his classroom is on the opposite side of the school, I think that might have been a sign.” Charlie barely held back a pout.
The initial drive-by yielded no results. Dean saw the lights on the main floor were on, and there was an extra car in the driveway, but that was it. He supposed the car was Michael’s; Cas had told him about their arrival the other day. At least Cas got to keep his bedroom this time. The bedroom which appeared dark from the street.
“Well, I think Dean has a girlfriend,” Castiel said dejectedly.
“I at least had the decency to put on pants.” Cas teased from the couch.
“You can kick ‘em off right there if you want."
Castiel rolled his eyes, “you act like he’s some sort of serial-dater. To the best of my knowledge, he’s been single the entire time we’ve been here.” Dean shrugged and continued cooking.
“And then I hugged him, but he didn’t really hug back. Then he made up an excuse about finishing homework. He didn’t even invite me to go with him or anything, he just...left,” Dean recounted. Charlie chewed her lip, trying to think of any possible
Dean, and kissed him like his life depended on it.
He returned to the bedroom to put on his work clothes, but couldn’t find any black socks. He knew they needed to do laundry, but he was
, and Alfie kissed back. Michael walked in on us and sort of flipped out. He demanded that Alfie pack his bags then he drove him home. I don’t know what Michael said or did to Alfie, but he stopped talking to me. I even walked for two hours to get to his house, but he just told me to go away. On the first day of school, I looked all over for him, but some kid told me that he had moved. He didn’t even tell me he was moving, or where. I lost my best friend and I was fucking bulldozed into the closet. A huge part of me was forced down by my own goddamn brother. The only person I talked to about my mom was uprooted from my life and shipped off to god knows where. So when I tell you I don’t want to talk about it, I don’t. Want. To talk. About it,” Castiel said through gritted teeth. Dean saw fire in those blue eyes. He swallowed thickly and processed all the new information.
“You don’t have to. Ask Benny if you want, he saw it, too.” Castiel just furrowed his brow and shook his head. He pulled out his phone.
“What? Too soon?”
“Balthazar,” Castiel cut him off, “he's not dating Dean. He's dating Dean’s brother. They were waiting for Dean to give them a ride,” Castiel still squirmed in his seat a little bit, which did not go unnoticed by his friend.
sex. Now Alfie was saying there was ‘more’. Did Castiel lie to him that night? They both shared really personal stuff; that was the night he and Cas had sex for the first time. And Castiel had been

“I’m sure dad and Naomi will want to meet her,” Castiel said.
thing about me that isn’t going on my resume. What’s my favorite color? My favorite sport? Who’s my best friend? What’s my favorite meal? Can you answer any of those?” Castiel snapped. Naomi looked taken aback.
Gleaming under the praise, Dean popped off, knowing what Castiel really wanted from him. He slipped off the couch and sat on his knees, inviting Castiel with a look. His boyfriend smiled, placing a hard kiss to Dean’s already swollen lips before getting up from the couch.
“Hey, wanna dance?” Joseph suggested with a smile. Castiel agreed, never able to resist Joseph’s requests to dance. If Castiel was being honest with himself, Joseph’s dancing was the only thing keeping them together at this point. Well, that and the sex. They tended to argue a lot when they weren’t doing one of those two things.
“Oh, so I’m just your personal heater?” Castiel joked.
“Please, Alfie. I want to help you,” Cas begged.
Dean took a seat at the table and dug into lunch, refraining from commenting on the “hot goss”.
“You will always be invited,” Balthazar said, taking Castiel’s hand and placing a suave kiss to the back of it, “
"Deanarooni!" An entirely too chipper voice called from the couch. Dean walked over and glared at Charlie, the house's technical genius before plopping down on the couch.
“Did you hear me?” He asked. He shared a look with his wife and shrugged. Castiel’s eyes focused on his dad once again.
the brit asked.
, so I just sort of tried to ignore it. I also really liked this girl. Probably a little too much, but she was really pretty and she liked classic rock, and I’d never been in love before,” Dean admitted. Castiel gave a small, sympathetic pout at his boyfriend’s words. Obviously, there was nothing Cas could’ve done, but he still felt bad that Dean had to go through this.
“I am his mother. I have a right to be here,” she argued.
….  .-  .-..  .-..  ---  .--  .  .  -.
Dean said, his voice tinny and far away.
“Yeah, as soon as I find-” he was cut off by a perky redhead linking arms with him.
“He’d need a napkin to eat a starburst,” Castiel lamented as he tucked into his own sandwich he had brought from home.
He parked his baby in the dark parking garage and entered the building.
“Heh. I gave him another one right on his ass last night,” Dean boasted.
"Back and forth with sway like branches in a storm.
“Hello, Castiel.” He said.
They didn’t have to chat too much longer, as Charlie walked in with chopsticks and what appeared to be a bag of hex nuts.
In a tux.
“Well, the terms will be discussed at length tomorrow,” Bart answered. “I thought you’d be happy about this. You can finally get Naomi out of your hair.” Castiel looked at his father with soft eyes and tilted his head.
Mary shared a look with Sam, who was cooking up some scrambled eggs. She shrugged at the unspoken question:
at a boy,” Alfie said, wiping off tears as they rolled down his face, hiccuping through his confession, “Then, m-my dad tells me we’re moving, and I was s-such a fucking coward that I...I didn’t even have the d-decency to tell you,” Alfie declared.
“Get your own room, man,” a boy replied.
Only 7 chapters of pining...that's not too bad, right?
“Hey sleepyhead,” Dean leaned down and kissed him, “mind if I come in?”
“So what, we don’t fuck and I’m automatically back to letting my dad tell me who I
He strode down to Balthazar’s classroom to fill him in on his plan.
Dean licked his lips and pressed his still-clothed erection into Castiel’s ass. All at once, he was gone; disappeared into their bedroom. He emerged moments later, a bottle of lube in his hands.
“Charlie, you're gay,” Dean said in amusement.
“You just said that it was a good thing! I’d be away from Naomi,” Cas reasoned.
Castiel nodded politely and put his headphones in.
