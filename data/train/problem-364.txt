Sherlock had opened the windows in the spare bedroom and tried to tidy a little elsewhere in the flat, while being mindful not to appear too accommodating as to mislead. When he got John’s text, he sent a quick reply, setting out two mugs on the worktop before heading down to meet the taxi.
“What?” Sherlock said as he got up to retrieve his own glass.
“Right,” Sherlock said. “I fill one role, but now you’re looking for someone else who is clever and funny and shares similar interests and is easy to talk to. All things that don’t describe me, it appears. Right, I get it.”
“I don’t like not knowing . . . as I’m sure you’re well aware,” Sherlock said, lifting his head a little and giving John a feeble smile.
"You too," John murmured. He yawned and stretched. "If you have trouble sleeping let me know, okay?" He stood up and passed by Sherlock, ruffling his hair without thinking.
"It was surprising,” John said. “You really are a good dancer."
John climbed the stairs slowly, sighing as he got into the flat. He took off his coat and sank down into his chair. "I am beat," he said. Sherlock was lying on the sofa, but John was focused on taking off his shoes and stretching his feet. "Are you ready for what I found, so I can just do nothing for a little while?"
"Good," Sherlock said, grabbing his shirt. "It seemed quite cruel of you to want me nude, what with today being the coldest on record or whatever you were saying earlier." He slipped his shirt back on. "What's the next game?"
John shifted to turn so he could touch Sherlock as well, his hand matching Sherlock. "You too," he said, kissing him again.
Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could hear John breathing, feel his body against his, smell his scent. It felt comfortable -- like home. This was the best he’d felt in days. “Thank you,” he said as well as he felt himself relaxing into sleep.
John moaned and nodded. "Me too . . . I need you," he said softly.
"Your house makes weird noises," John said.
They were supposed to unbury the box together, they were supposed to still be friends like they had been. John had promised nothing would change, had assured Sherlock they wouldn't drift apart. Sherlock hadn’t agreed with his optimism. It turned out Sherlock had been right. It made John feel sad on his first day of freedom, but it all seemed so long ago. He wondered if the box was still there.
"I..." John looked at the shovel in his hand and the slightly destroyed plants. "I was digging up our -- " he paused. “I was digging up the box.”
“My coat’s sufficient,” Sherlock said, even though he knew it wasn’t.
John was pacing in the lobby, two of Mycroft's men keeping him out of the hall. "I need to see Sherlock," he said for the hundredth time. They simply stood there. He growled in frustration, eyeing the men and considering fighting his way through, but the other people in the hospital didn't need that drama.
“No -- maybe, no . . . not now,” Sherlock said. “I want to finish this experiment. Tomorrow things are likely to be quite different -- let me finish this before things change. Don’t make me immediately regret what I’ve done.”
"We'll see," Sherlock said, smiling at John's cheekiness. "And by that I mean, yes."
“Give me another chance, John,” he said. “Tell me what to do so that we can be happy again.”
"Hmm? Yes please," John said, putting the computer on the coffee table to stretch. He had just leaned back when he heard pounding on the door downstairs. His stomach dropped and he rushed downstairs quickly, opening the door and watching Harry stomp past him.
"I don't nag," John protested. "Classes were okay. Kind of boring."
“I think --” Sherlock started. “Maybe this was stupid,” he said instead, turning to leave.
“Did I mention this is a competition?” Sherlock asked.
“No,” Sherlock said. “I might if it’d been a bakery, I might have, but it wasn’t. It was art.”
"We'll see if it comes up, but you don't have to do anything you don't want to."
Sherlock looked him over. “Sure they are,” he said. “So how was the surgery today?”
“I didn’t realise,” Sherlock said. “And what on earth makes you think he’s interested?”
He paid the driver and headed inside, climbing up to the little flat they shared just off campus.
John put his phone down, still smiling as he finished his dinner.
"I should just have a look at the water," he said.
“I did. A walk,” Sherlock said. He took a sip. “Perhaps you’d like to join me?”
"We don't have to do more," John said.
"All right," John said as he pulled his boxers on to walk Sherlock out.
Sherlock smirked. “You mean because I don’t wear too much flowery perfume? That’s all I remember about the girls I’ve seen with you,” he said. “However, I would start wearing it if it would keep you from forcing yourself to go out on boring dates. You’ll always grumpy afterward.”
Sherlock watched John walk to the kitchen. John’s denial was essentially proof.  John could have brushed off his behavior with any explanation, but he didn’t: he denied something they both knew was true. So, Sherlock now had to decide what to do next. He thought for a moment. He got up and moved to the kitchen table, sitting down and staring a hole through the back of John’s head.
“Perhaps you’d like to join me at the bar?”
As Sherlock dragged himself from his sleep down the stairs, Sherlock’s mum smiled and said, “It’s nice to see that you’re alive.”
Sherlock leaned to put his glass down on the table. He shifted slightly and turned his attention back to John, moving his mouth against the skin on John’s neck. John closed his eyes again, tilting his head to give him more room to explore. Sherlock's hand squeezed behind John's back and the sofa, as he shifted a little closer. "Your skin is warm," he mumbled as he continued to kiss and suck on John's neck.
“You’ll be back for Christmas day, though,” Mrs Holmes said, a statement rather than a question.
“All right,” she said. She leaned in and gave him a quick kiss before standing up. “I’m very glad you’re back, Sherlock.”
"It feels good," John murmured.
When he got out, he wrapped a towel around him. In his bedroom, he stared at his wardrobe and decided to get a little more dressed up today. It was stupid, he knew, but again, why not? He pulled out his purple shirt which John had once complimented him on. It felt a little tighter than usual, and he wondered why. He fiddled with his hair in the mirror and then emerged. “Your turn,” he said to John. “And remember, just because we’re not going out, doesn’t mean you should skip deodorant.”
John smiled and sniffed his tea suspiciously. "Nothing. Just . . . a bad date, that's all."
How many people tried to tell him things were different? Mycroft was the first, half of the police squad made jokes about it, Mrs Hudson was saying it almost everyday. John was the first one allowed on Sherlock's cases, the first one he'd called his friend, the first one he'd bought a sentimental present for . . . could that really be true? Sherlock had brought so much excitement to his life -- fixed his leg and pulled him out of his loneliness and gave him something to focus on besides his own miserable situation. And he wasn't miserable anymore. Not since he moved in with Sherlock. Why didn't he see this before?
"Oh, I work there."
“Maybe,” Sherlock said. “Maybe he could explain it to me out in the shed. . .”
John grinned. "You're a smart man, you'll figure it out."
John smiled. "Excellent idea,” he said. “I was just trying to think of something fun to do."
"Oh," John said, making a face. "I’d forgotten about that. Okay."
“Shut up,” Sherlock said. He opened his eyes and looked up at John. “That feels nice actually,” he added softly.
"You have -- I'm quite good at it," Sherlock said, starting a steady stroke.
"I'll have the same, but without the Coke," Sherlock said to the bartender. "And a glass of white wine."
Sherlock nodded and got up to get his shoes and coat. He felt strangely calm about what they'd talked about -- he wondered if he would stay that way. "Angelo's again?" he asked, moving to the door.
Sherlock stopped. There was something both comforting and confusing about John’s touch. “Right. Thanks,” he said softly, smiling in the darkness. He left, shutting John’s door behind. He made himself a cup of tea and moved to his desk. If he could sort the case, maybe he could stop thinking about John so much.
For all the talk John was doing to Sherlock that night they’d buried the box, he felt like a hypocrite when he walked into school alone. It was like his first day ever all over again. He saw friends comparing classes and lunch breaks, and he had no one to do that with. It didn't matter when he had chemistry or maths or lunch because Sherlock wasn't going to be in any of them. He wondered how Sherlock was doing at his new school and hoped he was handling it okay. He was going to have to write as soon as he could -- maybe they could still talk about those things, and it would make everything feel a little bit more normal. He couldn’t wait until sixth form when they bring their phones to class.
Sherlock kept his eye on the clock -- it seemed like she'd been gone a long time. Was that a good or a bad sign? Maybe she and Clara had reconciled and they'd start a new life together, and Harry would never come back to the flat. That seemed unlikely. He pushed back his chair and got up. "Tea?" he asked.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, buttoning up his shirt. “You’ve got an early morning, and I’ve got things to do.”
"I'll be up in my room, watching movies on my computer and reading," he said. He finished eating and got up to clean his plate and get something to drink.
John didn't say anything at first. "Look," he finally said. "Some things were said last night, but it was after all the chaos so I don't even know if it's real."
"I'm reading," John said, glancing up at Sherlock by the window.
When Sherlock woke up, he was confused for a moment. It had got dark and he didn’t recognise the room. But then he remembered. He got up, went to the toilet, closed all the curtains and made a cup of tea, going outside for a cigarette while he waited for the kettle to boil. Once his tea was made, he carried it to the sofa and got out his phone.
“Maybe that should be your goal then -– stop focusing on the sex stuff,” Sherlock said. “If it’s so important to meet someone new, just try to find someone you like rather than try to find someone you want to have sex with. I’m sure you get enough sexual satisfaction on your own for now.”
"Yeah, I think I may have liked you the kissing way too, but I just never knew. I mean, we were young but now . . ."
“Looks good,” Sherlock said. He filled the tea pot and picked up the tray, following his parents back into the sitting room. He set it down and nipped upstairs to grab his parents’ gifts. When he came back, there was a cup of tea and a small plate waiting on the table next to a chair. There were two gifts on the seat. He shifted them and sat down. He spread some cheese onto a cracker before popping it into his mouth. It was delicious actually, so he said that aloud. His mother smiled and stayed smiling as they opened their gifts.
Sherlock leaned up to kiss his mouth and let his hips move with John's hand. "Fuck," he mumbled.
“You mean you’re going to read to me?” Sherlock said. Maybe he should've been embarrassed, but the idea seemed kind of comforting.
“You’re being needlessly unkind,” Sherlock said, pulling a sad face before getting up and moving to his desk. He opened his laptop even though he didn’t have anything to work on.
“Nothing,” Sherlock said quickly, glancing over at John. “Can John stay the night if his mum says it’s all right?’
John saw Sherlock on the kerb when the cab pulled up. He got out and smiled at Sherlock before he started taking out the boxes. "I told you, there's not very much," he said. "Thanks for helping."
“I don’t have a problem, just stop saying John is stupid,” Sherlock said.
John looked over his shoulder and saluted Sherlock as he disappeared into his room. He turned the television on to keep him company.
John smiled. "Whenever you want," he said.
John moved out of the room quietly and left to go back to their flat. He felt immensely more relieved now that he had seen Sherlock in person. He headed home and packed everything Sherlock had on the list, as well as throwing in a few extra things he thought would help Sherlock keep busy. When he was in Sherlock's room, he couldn't help looking in the drawers, but one just had extra cigarettes and the other was just notes on John from the day Sherlock tested a mild poison on him that made him lose a whole day. For that reminder John threw out the cigarettes.
“We’ll see. You’ve not given me much reason to trust you.”
“I’m bored with being nice . . . I’ve been nice this entire time, well, almost all of it, and it’s boring. I miss being horrible,” Sherlock said, setting his book done and bopping John lightly on the nose.
"John Watson," Sherlock sang. "Where are you?" He looked around and saw a lump under his covers. He smiled stupidly. "Are you in the wardrobe? In my drawers? On the ceiling?" He moved over to the bed. "I guess he gave up. I might as well go to bed." He slid under the covers, pulling them over his head. "John? Is that you?" he asked.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade said. “Any news from John?”
“Expected by whom?” Sherlock said, hanging up his coat. “And for what reason?”
"Whiskey," John said, grinning at Sherlock. "Might as well do the thing properly."
“Fine,” Sherlock said again and stood up. He looked at John and said, “Let’s go.”
“We are good together -- whatever we do,” Sherlock agreed. He looked at John. “Should we do this?” he asked as he tipped his head and softly kissed John’s lips.
She gave him a disbelieving look before leaving, shutting the door behind her. John sighed loudly and rolled his eyes, leaning back again and flipping through channels for something to pass the time with.
“Maybe later,” Sherlock said. “You know – since we’re all dressed up, I think I’ll have a whiskey. Would you like to join me?”
John winced a bit as the light came in. He nodded, rubbing the five o'clock shadow on his face self consciously. "Okay."
“Why do you care?” John asked. “I mean, why are you working on the case? How’d you even find out about him?
"Angelo," John said softly, starting to feel quite relaxed.
“Your girlfriend?”
"Nothing is wrong. She just got in my head," he said.
John leaned up and kissed him. "I have to work though, just for a bit," he said against Sherlock's mouth.
"Yeah, why wouldn't they?"
"You were closest," he said. “I’m beginning to regret choosing you.”
Sherlock laughed. “Oh no, no, no, Doctor Watson – this doesn’t have anything to do with me. I’ll have you know that I am totally into whatever sexual practice occurred in your mind last night, I’ve done it multiple times, and I don’t care if you know it. This is totally about you. If you’re a big prude, that’s fine but don’t pretend that your reaction is about protecting me.”
“I want to talk to the doctor,” Sherlock said. “I’m an adult -- neither you nor Mycroft are my guardians, for god’s sake. I’m not a child.”
Sherlock shook his head. "That story does nothing to win me over," he said. He thought for a moment. "Are you going to want to get a Christmas tree for the flat?" he asked.
"Are you all right?" Sherlock asked John.
Sherlock handed John a mug. “Fine, sorry,” he mumbled. “But we’re supposed to be working on this case together, you know, so I do need to know what you’ve found out.”
“Seeing your family, being back home -- those things aren’t reason enough?” She ushered him to a chair and went to make tea. "Breakfast?"
"I . . . so what? I want to help," John said. "Do you mean you're firing me? I can't help with cases anymore?"
“I’m not sure those logistics work well in the real world,” Sherlock said with a smile. He looked down and watched his hand to start to move slowly. He glanced back up. “Like this?” he asked.
“Right . . . does that mean you’ll be seeing her again?”
“Where’s John?” she asked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and set the phone down next to him at the desk. He looked at John. “I don’t like this,” he said.
By the end of the week he agreed to go out for a drink when they closed the surgery.  She was easy to talk to. They tried to stay away from talking about work. They talked about school and their training. John told her a bit about his plan to move closer to work. It was a fun night. At the end as they waited for her taxi, she leaned in and kissed him. John pulled back.
They were both alive and home. Together again.
"I'm still worried, I think it'll be a little while before I can relax about it."
“Today,” Sherlock told him.
“It is something,” Sherlock said. “Would you make us a cup of tea, please? I’ll get us sorted to look as soon as he sends it through.”
“It was incredible,” Sherlock said, kissing John’s mouth roughly. “What can we do now to make you feel as good?”
John shook his head. "No," he admitted. He hadn't even thought about it.
She looked around the room. “Is it too cold in here for you?” she asked. “I can get you another blanket.”
“Have you had an argument?”
“As long as no one got hurt,” she said. She tousled Sherlock’s hair. “Since you’re already here, do you boys want to set the table for us?”
"He doesn't need to -- I mean, maybe we can plan it."
“Have you even got dressed since I last saw you?” she asked. “Or are you going to claim you’ve been ‘working’ too much to clean yourself up?”
Mycroft sighed. “Give me the phone,” he said.
“Why?” Sherlock asked.
“Can I lie here for a few more minutes?” Sherlock asked. “I’m a little sleepy again, but I’m not ready to go to bed.”
“Whatever you need,” Mrs Hudson said. She finished her tea and then stood up. “Do you want me to help you tidy up?”
“John said he was getting dinner,” Sherlock said.
"Yeah, maybe," John said.
Sherlock opened the door wider and stepped forward a little. “Is this something kind of insult about my own health? I can assure you I’m well,” he said.
"You seem surprised -- that's hurtful," Sherlock said, returning his smile.
"John?" he answered.
"Rehab. For real," she added. "John is going to help me find a place."
"Yes," John said. “I think you’re why my dates don’t end up working.”
“I concentrated on my studies -- did you really think I would change that much?”
Sherlock stayed mostly quiet during dinner, though he was listening carefully. It's not that he was looking to catch Harry up, it's just that he knew addicts, he knew addiction, and he knew that John would be so crushed if Harry were to fall again. But he didn't hear anything that worried him - her descriptions were familiar and realistic. He watched the way John listened and reacted to her, remembering the time he'd said he would be friends with his sister if it weren't for her alcoholism. Sherlock could see that now. Which meant she was bound to be in Sherlock's life more as well, because John and Sherlock were intertwined forever. That thought made him smile so he reached over and held John's hand as they finished their coffee.
His dad patted his back as he sat down. “Everything seem the same around here?” he asked before pouring himself a cup.
"John," Sherlock called out. He was aware how many times he'd said John's name in the last hour. It's because John was everything to him -- not just because they'd been trapped together for all this time, but because Sherlock knew now that John was everything he needed and wanted. He moved his hand to John's shoulders, stroking the soft skin that covered the muscles he kept hidden most of the time. He watched John until the sight was almost too much, and he had to close his eyes to keep from exploding.
“Do you feel good?” Sherlock asked quickly before moving back to John’s cock.
"I did, yeah." He gave Sherlock a small plate of breakfast.
“I haven’t shot a single wall this week, you idiot!” Sherlock hit the door again and then stomped off to his bedroom, slamming the door for good measure.
“For idiots, you mean?”
John smiled as he was pulled onto the dance floor. The song that was playing ended and changed to a slow song. He looked up at Sherlock and moved closer. "I guess the deejay’s decided," he said.
John nodded, sliding his hand into Sherlock's hair. He glanced at Sherlock's lips before closing the space and kissing him softly.
"I am, yes. What's it about?"
“You don’t hold me back,” Sherlock said. His eyes were still closed, and he felt quite calm and relaxed. “You help me.”
The sound made John's whole body shiver, heat blooming through every nerve. He started moving on Sherlock's hand for more. "Sherlock..."
John rolled his eyes. "Okay. Well, I'm going to go to bed, then,” he said as he put his cup in the sink. “I have some reading to do before I sleep.”
"I stopped by there after work," John said. "I just want to move things along."
It was basically one big room with a kind of sofa against one wall and a few chairs and a bookcase against the other. At the rear were two doors, one for the bathroom and one leading to the back garden. One corner was a little kitchen space with a table, on which set a vase of flowers. “Grandma’s been by to tidy,” Sherlock’s mum said. “Make sure it’s as tidy when you leave.”
“Well, good,” Sherlock said, finally meeting John’s eye. “But maybe you should think about it overnight. I mean, maybe you would have with that girl tonight . . . and now I’m here. I don’t want to be your second choice. I know it’s not like that, but maybe you should be sure.” He pushed John’s thigh lightly. “Besides, the kitchen’s a mess -- I should clean up and you have a class in the morning.”
John listened while Greg explained what was happening and why he needed John. "I hate to ask you to do it -- I know it could be dangerous, but you can handle yourself."
"Let's pick a code for the lock."
"Excuse me, but it's not that I can't," John said indignantly. "I haven't wanted to yet. I just need to find someone I want to be with like that."
"I do," John said. "What about you?"
John's head fell as he took a breath. He turned and faced Sherlock, raising his eyes a bit. "Yes?"
John shrugged and just smiled suspiciously. "Maybe."
“Outrageous – I made it up, I worked all day on it,” Sherlock said. “Besides, it’s not over. After they’d moved the things into Sherlock’s cave, John said he needed to head out to be a hero for a little while. He asked Sherlock if he’d like to come. Sherlock wasn’t certain it was a good idea, but he said okay. Because for some reason Sherlock trusted John. They were still basically strangers, but he trusted him.
"You ordered a case of updog."
“It’s easier to show than tell you,” Sherlock said. “Try to relax a little . . . minds work better when they’re less stressed.” He grabbed John’s glass and took a big swallow of wine before handing it back. “Finish up now.”
Back at the flat, Sherlock made tea and brought it into the sitting room for John. "So, how do you feel?" he asked him.
"Don't be cheeky," Sherlock said. He moved over to the sofa. "Get yourself a cup of tea, yeah?" he asked, picking up his own mug. Then he looked over. "I wasn't lying -- we're out of milk," he said. "Should we just go get something to eat? That unexpected expenditure of energy has actually made me a little bit hungry."
Sherlock looked over, surprised. “Yes, that’s right,” he said. “I didn’t think you were paying attention, but I see you were.”
"Do you think that's a good idea?" Sherlock asked.
"Not stupid, just rash," John said. "You didn't have me holding you back."
"I like to think I'm fair with everyone,” John said with a smile. “The charm is free."
John moaned softly as his answer.
He needed to talk to Sherlock. He couldn't keep going on without knowing for sure. He would phrase it as Mrs. Hudson's theory and see what the response was. Then he could judge from there if he should admit anything else.
"Well, hopefully they will call you for one soon.”
"Maybe now you can practice since we have nothing better to do," John smiled over at him. "I'll teach you how to just be instead of having to solve everything."
“I don’t doubt that’s true -- the second part, at least,” Sherlock said. “I don’t get why there has to be such a show about it all.”
“Don’t you like me?” she asked again. “I thought we were friends.”
"Okay so . . . right." John said. "My sister is here . . . she wants to stay for a couple days."
“Excellent,” Sherlock said. “Perhaps I should hire you as a body guard.”
"I knew you'd get it," he said.
"I really doubt anything about you is boring," she said.
"Yes, me," Sherlock said. Of course this was embarrassing, but John should know -- he probably should've known from the start, but he definitely needed to know now. "Quite some time ago, long before I met you. I made . . . poor decisions. I'm better now. Because of that place. If they could help me, they can help her," he added.
"I like to think so," he grinned.
Sherlock dropped one hand to John's waistband, slowly flicking open the button of John's trousers. "Can I?" he asked.
Sherlock didn't respond. Angelo came over to take their orders, and Sherlock got his usual. "Harry, what would you like? Everything here is good," he said flatly.
“Maybe,” Sherlock said. He looked over. “Are you the same, do you think?” he asked.
“Well,” Sherlock said, standing up and moving to the kitchen. “Just remember, she’s a criminal, John, and criminals don’t tend to be nice.”
"No, I'm not drunk," Sherlock said. "Let's be quiet now." He rested his hand on John's on his chest. "Except one more thing. Do you think you love me?"
Sherlock shook his head and made a little grumble.
John slipped his hand into Sherlock's hair, shifting on the seat a bit as he spread his legs for Sherlock. "I see . . . you know I always miss your mouth. . .” he said softly.
Sherlock had no idea what she was talking about. He hadn’t seen her for a couple of weeks. He glanced at John.
John sighed loudly. "Sherlock, you can't claim ignorance now. You know what's happening, and you’re not like those stupid idiots who think they are invincible against it. One of us will go out if and when we have to." He got up and went to finish the food.
“Some . . .” Sherlock lied.
"I would have come," he said. "I'd have sneaked in.”
“You coming to the party Friday?” Ellen asked.
The film immediately bored Sherlock, but he realised this was the most comfortable he’d felt in the last day or two. He got up after a while and put his wine glass in the sink, making some tea instead. “I’ll do the washing up in the morning,” he said when he returned.
Sherlock put space between them and reached down, sliding his hand into John’s boxers. He wrapped his fingers around John’s hardening cock. He looked up and kissed his mouth roughly.
“I will telephone your brother,” the man said with a heavy accent. “He will come.”
"Now you're just trying to embarrass me!" John laughed. "Sorry to disappoint you -- I just have old photos in there."
“Who are you?” Sherlock asked.
"I'm going off of looking at you," he said.
"I'll give it a try," Sherlock said. "I'm not sure I'll be good at it." He sat up a bit, pulling the blankets down. He slid down on his side and began rubbing John's back with one hand. His skin was cool, but Sherlock felt the large muscles underneath, which John normally kept hidden by his ridiculous jumpers. One of which Sherlock was now wearing. He pulled the jumper over his head and dropped it on the side of the bed, before going back to rubbing John. "Is this all right?"
His mum touched his shoulder and sighed softly. "I just came to tell you that I'm going out with some friends for dinner, so I gave your sister money to order pizza. Why don’t you invite a friend over?”
Sherlock sat back for a second. He moved his laptop in front of him and shut it. Then he smiled. “Wow, John, you do surprise me – for someone who masturbates in the shower 2.7 times a week, I am genuinely shocked this is the first time you’ve had a sex dream. Even I had my first one when I was a teenager,” he said. He looked over with mock concern and added, “Did you have a wet dream? Do you have questions? Don’t feel ashamed – it’s just that your body is changing.” Despite his attempt, he couldn’t help laughing aloud.
“And you’ve been so busy, running around and working . . . your muscles must be aching,” Sherlock said as he nipped at John’s inner thigh. Then he let go of John’s cock and lifted each of his legs over the arms of the chair, so John slid down a little. He grabbed a bottle of lube from behind the chair and spilled it into his hand. One hand went back to work John’s cock as the other explored John’s balls. The vibrator buzzed against the chair, teasing them both about what was to come.
"I know," John said. "What do you want to do?"
“We can’t let Molly down,” Sherlock said, slipping his arm around John’s lower back. He leaned in, his head against John’s. He inhaled his smell as they swayed to the music.
A server came over and handed them menus. “Can I get you something to drink?” he asked.
“I guess,” Sherlock said. “Make whatever you’d like, and I’ll eat some.” He marked his page and stood up and stretched.
"I don't think you are," Sean said.
“Lestrade is still ignoring me – maybe I should give him a call,” Sherlock said, getting out his phone.
"Oh. Um, I guess I could get you a drink or something," John said.
“Should we try again?” Sherlock asked. “We’ve got more condoms . . .”
John laid down normally and cuddled with him. "It's not like you were waiting with open arms," he grumbled.
"Everything what?" He asked softly.
He looked around the flat as he made breakfast, his phone in his pocket so he could hear if Sherlock called. Everything was so quiet. He didn't like it very much. He took his breakfast to the desk and started looking through the blog, taking notes on possible cases that he could tell Sherlock about.
There was suddenly a muffled noise. “Your phone’s ringing,” Sherlock said to John. “My legs are too spent to get up and retrieve it for you, I’m afraid.”
John shook his head, coming back to his chair. "It's not busy enough. It's fine."
“You can leave your stuff here,” Sherlock said, pointing to the foot of the stairs. “Come on.”
“Well, you must be very proud,” Sherlock said. “What are you doing tonight?”
"Thank you," he said, digging in right away.
“Right, forgot about that,” Sherlock said. He poured himself a cup of tea. “I’m going into my room now. I’ll see you tomorrow.” He disappeared into his room.
"I don't feel that way!" John insisted. "It was just a stupid dream!" He leaned back. "And being at the zoo isn't embarrassing."
“Definitely not, we look the same as we did before we came up here,” he said. “We’ll tell Mrs Hudson we went out for a cigarette -- I don’t imagine anyone else will notice we’ve been gone.”
Sherlock pressed his hips against John's as he sucked roughly on John's neck. Then he let a hand slip between their bodies and held John's cock before moving into a slow stroke. John bucked in surprise and then lay still, moaning Sherlock's name deeply as he imagined what that lovely hand looked like around him. He squeezed him closer, his breathing getting heavier. Sherlock's mouth moved down to his collarbone and he sucked the skin there. He pressed himself against John's leg as he continued his stroke. John moved his leg to give Sherlock friction as he swore breathlessly.
"I don't owe you anything. Go away," John said. He plated his sandwich and started looking for crisps.
"Hmm. How long was your last relationship?"
John nodded. "Yeah . . . I'm hoping to play rugby," he said. He glanced at Sherlock, almost nervously.
"I don't have any. I just want to rest from yesterday," he said. "Have you got any plans?"
"Okay. Are you telling me that you're cooking?"
John sighed. This was going to be a disaster.
“I’m unable to stay,” Mycroft said, glancing at his brother.
“It’s very interesting,” Sherlock said, giving John a serious but sly look. “Perhaps I could tell you about it the next time our pipes break.”
"What do you mean?" John asked, looking between them.
"Please don't be so dramatic," John said.
“Will Mother be there?” Sherlock asked.
and hit Send before he had a chance to doubt his choice.
John hesitated. Did he want to help this person, coming around to insult Sherlock? But Sherlock wouldn't have cared about that -- only how interesting the case was. John took a deep breath.
Sherlock didn’t say anything for a minute. “Well, now you have,” he said, reaching over and resting his hand on John’s leg.
"How could you . . . all this time," John said, moving closer to him. "Do you know what it's been like? What I've been through?"
"It’s true because I'm doing it," he smiled.
John swallowed hard and didn't move. "Yes."
"Fucking hell, John," Sherlock said, trying to catch his breath. "I'm burning up now." He moved a little a way from John, reaching for the shirt to wipe his hand. He offered it to John. "It's yours -- sorry."
Sherlock opened the door. He greeted John roughly with “I thought you said you’d fixed it.”
Sherlock looked at him. “Is this what you want?” he asked. “For us to be like this?”
John nodded. "I really liked kissing you," he said. "I like you."
She was boring -- John just didn't feel any kind of spark between them. He pretended not to notice the hints she was dropping to extend the night, and they parted ways. He doubted he would hear from her again, but that didn't really bother him that much.
Sherlock took a sip of tea. "What are your plans?" he asked her.
John stared flipping through the channels, pausing on a crime show half way through a mystery.
“And you know Molly how again?”
There, that was really all he could do at the moment for work. He needed another distraction. “I’m going to have a cigarette,” he said, getting up and moving to the window.
Sherlock pushed his face into his pillow to wipe his eyes. Then he closed them and took a picture in his head of what he imagined they looked like lying there, so he would always remember everything about this night.
John walked into the flat and didn't know what to look at first. The place was kind of a mess -- books, newspapers, beakers and solutions, just general clutter everywhere.
“Nothing,” Sherlock said. “Nothing -- everything’s fine. What is it you want from me again?”
“That’s good,” Sherlock mumbled as he unzipped John’s jeans and slid his hand inside, to first palm and then softly rub John’s cock through his pants.
"I didn't just want to try it out," he said.
______________________________________________________
“No, not go out dinner,” Sherlock said. “I meant -- why? Do you want to go out? We could go out I guess.”
John flushed lightly. "I think the wine is getting to you," he murmured.
Sherlock kissed John hungrily. “Let’s get into your bed again,” he said, pulling him as he led the way. In the bedroom, Sherlock stepped out of his trousers. Then he slowly pulled the towel exposing John’s nude body, looking quickly, before stepping in close. He rubbed his hands up and down John’s back as he kissed his mouth and then the warm, damp skin of his neck.
“Possibly,” Sherlock said. “He may not have been the first one -- just the first one in Britain. I know some people who are familiar with . . . things elsewhere.” He ate a few bites of his food. “Looks like I’m winning,” he said with a grin.
"Are you back to work tomorrow?" Sherlock asked, trying to have a conversation like they used to before they said they loved each other.
John raised his brows. "I'm going to check the blog. Maybe we can do some virtual cases."
John looked down at their hands clasped together. "Yeah, it is pretty nice," he agreed.
When the show finished, Sherlock said, “See? I told you.” He stood up and moved to the kitchen. “You really should pay more attention to me. Tea?” he asked as he filled the kettle.
“Open the door,” she said sternly. “There’s someone here to look at the flat.”
John watched her disappear into his room. His breathing was shallow and fast. He didn't look at Sherlock as he went to the bathroom to find the medicine.
"Yes, in the drawer," he pointed.
"Sherlock, please. You can't tell him. I really am quitting -- that part isn't a lie."
"John," Sherlock moaned. "Fuck . . .that feels good."
Sherlock put some twigs and leaves into the pit and then went back in to grab some paper. He helped John shift some wood to the pit before pulling out a cigarette, lighting it, and then handing his lighter to John. "Go for it," he said.
“We don’t have any leftovers,” Sherlock said. “I was thinking I could make you something.” He got up from the chair. “I had to take a cooking class at school.” He led them inside and look through the cupboards. “I don’t know how to make anything complicated,” he said. “And I can’t guarantee how good it’ll taste.” He pulled some things from the fridge. “Did you have to take any stupid classes?”
“Well, we’re not exactly like them,” Sherlock mumbled.
“I am, but I don’t know why everyone thinks I’m too stupid to understand what lockdown means,” Sherlock pouted as he moved to the kitchen. “I’ve not gone out, I’ve obeyed every rule.” He put some bread in the toaster for John’s toast.
"Excuse me?"
John looked at his schedule again. "No, it'll be out of the way at the end of the day. What about midday?"
"Which virus?"
____________________________________
John rolled on the condom. He leaned over Sherlock, kissing him again as he pushed into him.
He closed up his computer and got up, dumping the rest of his food in the bin. “I think I’ll read it my room for a while,” he told John and then disappeared, shutting the door behind him.
Sherlock moaned even louder than before. He lifted his head and kissed John’s mouth hard. John moaned into the kiss, keeping it up until they parted for air. His hand moved the whole time, and now with a smirk, he started scooting downwards, pressing kisses along Sherlock's torso.
“Have a productive day?” Sherlock asked. He realised he felt anxious all of a sudden and wasn’t sure why.
"Dare," Sherlock said.
“I mean, are you motivated by money, by acclaim? Those intentions do not belong in my line of work,” Mycroft said.
"If you want me to, sure. What do you want to hear?" John asked.
"When he came back from the war, he needed someone -- you're his sister, you should have been there for him," he said. "You're weren't. But I was."
“Did he blow up anything?” she asked John.
“Can I take off my clothes?” Sherlock asked.
John took a big bite of food and tried to chew quickly so he could answer. "Slow. I haven't checked my email today, though. I will after we eat."
John was called for the job and started working right away. It was boring work, but it was busy and it kept his day moving along. The woman who hired him usually stopped into his office for a chat. He could tell that she was flirting, but he hadn't decided what he wanted to do about that.
“Well, we’re glad as well,” his dad said. “What are you going to do with the summer?”
Sherlock took his test and put it directly in his bag, without even looking at it. He knew what the grade was. He was packing his bag up when his teacher walked over. “Can I have a word with you in my office?” she asked.
that way, but . . . perhaps we need to check the bathroom?” Sherlock said, heading down the hallway.
“Stop saying it like that,” Sherlock said. “What do you mean I could be ‘useful’ to you?”
"I will," Sherlock said. "And will you make it so I don't have to talk much to her?"
She looked over at him. “Is it raining out?” she asked.
“That’s sweet of you to say,” Sherlock said. “Is the date over? I don’t really want it to be.”
Sherlock set his phone on the nightstand and rolled over in bed, pulling the covers up to almost cover his face. He did miss John. Much more than he'd expected to.
“Definitely,” Sherlock said, standing up. “I’m going to have a shower. I suggest you have one when I finish.”
John turned and looked over, shutting the laptop before she saw the blog. "Hello."
“No.”
Sherlock looked up from his desk to see John and then quickly glanced at the window, noticing it was now light outside. “Morning,” he said and stretched in his chair.
“You’re supposed to be resting,” Mycroft said. “That’s all this is.”
“Is there anything you always do at a certain that I, as a flatmate, should be aware of?” Sherlock asked.
“I guess I’m an idiot then,” Sherlock said as he started putting his things in his bag.
Lestrade followed him, grabbing his arm to keep him still. “It won’t be long . . . wait,” he said.
“It does,” Sherlock purred. “And it’s going to feel even better . . . I wonder what will happen next . . .” Sherlock whispered. He kept them rocking for a few moments and then his hand slowed but didn’t let go. “Shall we move to the bed?”
"Fine," Sherlock said. "Fair is fair." He bundled the cards into a stack and shoved them toward John.
"Great, you can help me put the groceries away," John said.
John moved up into Sherlock, moaning as he held his hips. "Yes . . . it is," he said, looking down to watch.
Sherlock stared at the screen. This was a ridiculous task, but maybe it would help them feel normal for a little while. When the details arrived, he opened the photo of the missing man. He tried to read his face – was this man in trouble or had he just run away from his life? Where was he now? Out in the world with the virus?
Sherlock didn’t say anything, assuming John would understand that as a no.
John waved Sherlock forward. "Be my guest," he said.
“There’s got to be something,” Sherlock said, dramatically throwing down his arms. “Oh my god, John,” he said, suddenly leaning forward in his chair. “Are we . . . boring?”
"What? Why?"
Sherlock wasn’t unaware of what going on obviously. He and John had watched the Prime Minister announce the lockdown, but there was a small part of him that thought it wouldn’t quite apply to him – whether he was assuming he’d be working for the police, or maybe his brother would have some influence, Sherlock hadn’t thought out the details. Perhaps he was just trying to avoid thinking about the whole thing. It was much easier to pretend that this was one of the little games he and John sometimes played – John would nag him and Sherlock would fuss, but they always worked it out. He’d promised to stay home while John was at work today, and in many ways it hadn’t seemed much different than any other day.
“Just don’t invite them over,” Sherlock said.
“It’s not like that,” Mrs Hudson said and then realised it was probably unnecessary. “Do you two know each other then?”
"You don't like anyone.”
John's graduation was a whole production. His mum invited his whole family and when his name was called they cheered like maniacs even though they weren't supposed to. He couldn't help grinning, waving at them all. Afterwards they all had dinner at home, and then a big party that lasted into the night. He was happy. He went to bed soon after everyone left and decided not to set his alarm.
Sherlock took a deep breath and realised his whole body felt bruised. “Any fractures?” he asked.
“I would as well,” Sherlock said. “I don’t think my brother will like it, but I have a feeling Mrs Hudson will be pleased.”
"No wine," Sherlock whispered to John before they both got in and the car took off.
"Yes, but it'll be hard to enjoy that stuff living on the street," John grinned. "I have to go. See you later."
John nodded. "A clean slate,” he said.
As soon as the words hit Sherlock's ears, he was coming. "Fuck," he called loudly, doing his best to maintain his hand's movement on John's cock.
“Keep looking,” Sherlock said. “Are you going to tell me what the problem is or are you just going to behave normally? Those are your two options. Choose one.”
John looked down, moaning at the sight before he let go and came with Sherlock, moaning his name.
Sherlock felt he shouldn’t dignify that with a response, but he did.
“Yours feels cool,” Sherlock said as he slipped one hand around John’s back. He moved his mouth up John’s neck to kiss his mouth again.
"I'm not mocking you. You say that all the time," he said.
Once the show ended, Sherlock let go of John’s hand and grabbed the remote. “Do you want to watch something else?” he asked, making a little yawn. “I think I might be done with it for the night.”
"She's okay," he said. "What are you making for dinner?"
“I think the two of you need to get hobbies,” he said as he got up to make them some tea.
John grinned. "Yes well, that won't be happening for a while so you better get used to my constant company. Relax. We'll be fine."
“Maybe,” Sherlock said. “But I think you’re lying. I think you were expecting something. I hope you weren’t disappointed.”
Sherlock looked over and met John’s eyes. “Yes, John, I do,” he said.
"Huh? Oh, Watson," he said. "John Watson."
"I don't want to watch you go see bands all the time," Sherlock said. "But I don't want you to flirt with tall, ginger men if I'm not there."
"Are you sure that's a good idea?" Sherlock asked, immediately regretting opening his mouth.
“In the kitchen,” Sherlock called. He moved over and put the kettle on. “Are you alone?”
"What were you talking about?" John asked.
"I think my game was fun," John said. "I had a good time even though I was mildly harassed."
Sherlock let John kiss his mouth. He slid his hands around John's waist, pulling him tighter. The sense of relief -- of being home -- felt so good. He tipped his head to deepen the kiss. "I don't like being away from you," he said softly, pulling John even closer. "I need . . . to have you by me."
John closed his eyes and pretended to snore, trying not to smile.
“What is the hold up?” Sherlock asked Mrs Hudson.
"I don't think so," John said. "Let's just see, okay?"
“It had to seem real, and he knew -- everyone knew -- that only your acceptance would be convincing,” Sherlock admitted. “I’m so sorry you had to be hurt.”
"Yeah. Not in those words exactly," John added. "But yeah. And that you love me."
"I won't," he said. "I promise."
John touched his hand and slowly laced their fingers. "We could."
John took a sip of whiskey. "I don't know. I thought I would be, but I'm not.”
"Hide in here," Sherlock said. "It's warmer -- we should stay in here where there are fewer windows."
She was quiet for a moment. "Okay. Just let me know," she said. "Come out soon, okay?"
“A few years ago,” Sherlock said, shutting his door quietly. “When did you start drinking?” he asked as he sat down on the bed.
"Nothing is happening," John said quickly. "He’s busy, but we're best friends."
They were quiet for a moment and then John said, "Harry said you loved me."
Sherlock stood staring out the window, holding his mug up to his face to protect it from the frigid feeling that seeped through the glass.
"You know that's how rumours start," John teased.
“That must be the husband’s doing,” Sherlock grumbled. “Molly is smart and organised, but she’s not a control freak like that.”
John stared at the message, but wasn’t sure what to write in response to that.
"I'll go, John. For real . . . I'll leave you to your life . . . this is my mess."
"I just said I love a good mystery. What would John Watson -- and more likely Sherlock Holmes -- want with me?"
When Sherlock came back in, he went upstairs to his room. He checked his phone and saw a message from John.
John ate a few bites. He took a deep breath and said, “Do you want to tell me where you were?”
John pouted. "You won't tell me?"
John took a big bite and hummed. "It’s not poison. Eat," he teased.
“What? Arresting old ladies for buying non-essential sherry?” Sherlock said. “We just need something.”
John grinned and bit Sherlock's nipple lightly, licking to soothe it as he moved lower. "That's so sexy."
"Let's see," John said, taking the phone and dialing another random number. He grinned at Sherlock as it started to ring, trying to think of something quick. But no one answered, the phone went to voicemail. "Booo," John recorded before hanging up.
Sherlock took a drink. “Med school, eh? You’re full of surprises.”
"That is not so bad. I will allow that," John said.
"I will. You may not believe this, but I do like having you at home," he said.
“Where have you two been?” she asked.
"All right," Sherlock said. He went back to eating his food, eventually giving up and setting his fork on the plate.
"I don't mind," John said, handing it back to Sherlock.
John looked over at Sherlock, studying his profile while he wasn't looking. "Yeah, I'm imagining it."
Sherlock slid into the backseat of the van. Ellen slid in next to him. “No one else will say it, but you’re the reason we won,” she said.
John sat in the pews near the back, trying to pay attention as the vicar went on and on. He knew it was a special day for Molly, and he was happy for her, but he was bored. He wanted to get to the reception and start the party. He looked at the people around him, then at the people on the other side of the church. Maybe some people-watching would keep him entertained for a while. It had to be almost over.
Sherlock moaned softly as he wiped his hand over his face which was damp with sweat. He opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling. It was painted off white and had one visible crack. He closed his eyes again. “It’s so much . . .” he mumbled.
"I'm trying to keep my mind active, John," Sherlock said. "I know this is our first winter together, but I don't do well unless my mind is active and your trapping me in this flat with nothing to do is not going to get any prettier." He turned and flopped his legs up onto the sofa to add drama to his pout.
"You don't know what that tastes like," John said. Then he glanced over. "You don't, right?"
“Who stole it?” Sherlock asked.
"No, it’s okay. I'm going to Sherlock's for breakfast."
“I have,” Sherlock admitted. “It was just . . . other things.”
"Thanks," Sherlock said, taking a long drink. He used the cloth to wipe up his belly and then snuggled under the covers again. "Come get close to me," he told John.
too much to type out . . . every thought of John was so big in Sherlock's head right now. He wished he could head home right now to see him, but it was late and cold out, so then he considered just offering to pay for a taxi to bring John here, but that seemed equally ridiculous. Perhaps he should just simply blame the thoughts on what his mother called 'the holiday spirit', but deep down he knew John had changed him.
John was half present in the only two classes he had. When he was done, he stopped by the cafe for a snack and headed back to the flat, his mind back on Sherlock and their conversation. His stomach was twisting with nerves. He let himself in and looked around for Sherlock, realising he must still be sleeping. He got out his things to organise for tomorrow.
John tilted his head a bit. He didn't know what Sherlock was asking for. Did he just want to hang out? It was odd, the rules of a flatmate. Some people hung out and became friends, others lived separate lives. "We don't have to be strangers, you know? We can be friends and hang out--" He cut off as the radio started to static. He moved closer and was about to turn it off when it kicked on again, playing music again.
"Both," she said.
"My work is always guaranteed."
"Did I do something wrong? What is it?" John asked.
"I am," Sherlock said. "I wonder why -- perhaps I bumped my head earlier or something." He smiled stupidly over at John. "I'm glad you're home."
Sherlock stubbed out his cigarette against the brick and dropped it in the bin. He went in and found Mrs Hudson. He noticed a coat on a chair. “Did you invite someone to sit with us?” he asked. “That’s rude, I don’t want anyone else around me.”
John walked the long way around, calling in the order so it would be ready when he finally got there. It was odd ordering for Sherlock again. He thought of Sherlock back at the flat and the games he tried playing. Didn't he realise nothing was the same?
"Just some granola bars and cereal and things like that -- nothing for the fridge," John said. "Want to go explore the forest?"
John smiled. "Yes, for sure."
Sherlock stood up and moved into the kitchen. After a few loud noises, one spill and multiple curses, he was ready. Or at least as ready as he was going to be. He moved over to his desk and opened his laptop, knowing he needed something to distract him for these last few minutes or his head would probably explode.
"Please?" John begged. "It feels so good."
John nodded, using his hand to stroke Sherlock as he moved into a better position. He leaned down and licked the head, swirling his tongue around it before taking him into his mouth. He moaned softly, moving in a slow rhythm to get used to the fullness.
"I know, I'm really sorry," John said.
Sherlock slid the box over to John and said, “Remember, once it’s locked, we don’t open it until we’re old and ready for university.”
John poured them each a glass. "Don't let it disappear too quickly now."
It wasn’t long before the sound of the television began to drive Sherlock mad. He felt agitated. Then he felt angry. He’d needed to talk to John, he’d wanted to talk to John, but John wasn’t here to help. He picked up his phone twenty times, but for some reason, he set it back down twenty times as well. John knew about the case and still he’d gone out. He was making his priorities very clear, and that annoyed Sherlock.
"Back again?"
“The police have already been here,” she said.
She headed up to the door and bent down to the find the key her mother had left under the mat. She unlocked the door and then turned to give Sherlock the key. “Don’t lose this,” she said and then led them inside.
Sherlock lifted a hand to wipe his face, which was damp with sweat already. He looked up at the ceiling and then down at John, reaching down to touch his hair. John licked a stripe up Sherlock's cock, taking him into his mouth and bobbing up and down. He looked up at Sherlock as he moaned softly.
“What is it then?”
"I don't like it. It's . . . sappy. Annoying. You won't tell John?"
“Good,” Sherlock said, squeezing him a little. “Until then we can be around each other all the time, right? Except for if we get jobs or whatever, I know. I just mean, we’ll be able to be together like this, okay?”
"Perhaps John should go with you," Sherlock suggested. He wasn't sure he should be getting involved at all, but, unfortunately, he did know a little about addiction.
“In the bedroom,” Sherlock ordered.
Suddenly Sherlock felt exhausted. It was a mix of being away, of being confused, and of this, of course, which had probably been confusing him for the last few months but he just hadn't known yet. He snuggled in a little against John's body and closed his eyes. "I'm glad I'm home," he sighed.
Sherlock nodded goodbye and then jumped into the shower.
Back at the flat Harry went up to get ready for bed while John moved around the flat to get sheets and pillows for the sofa.
She smiled wider and agreed. They made small talk until each of them were called in for their interview. The woman was shocked at John's experience, unsure why he wanted to work in a simple outpatient surgery. He didn't get into the details of his injury, but his answers seemed to be enough. He felt good about the interview and about the job. He wished the woman luck, handed off his number, and left.
John rolled onto his back as he tried to catch his breath. He couldn't believe they had done this.
“I am working,” Sherlock said angrily.
"Surely that means your work here is done," Sherlock said.
"All right, that's what we'll do then," Sherlock said. He was now sitting back comfortably on the sofa. He glanced at the clock. "Should we get you something to eat?" he asked.
"Yeah, I'll browse through and find something."
“I can pretend,” Sherlock said. “But I agree that the food tastes excellent. I’m not saying your cooking’s been bad, it’s just . . . this tastes very good.”
"Hmm. I can't think of anything right this second. Now you go," he said.
"Well, I'm going to make something easy, spaghetti probably. Are you okay with that?"
Sherlock ordered the food and came back into the sitting room. "Was work all right?" he asked.
"No, it’s fine," he said quickly. "It’s just . . . I've just got out of a relationship," he said. The lie came out before he could even think about what he was saying. "I thought it would be good to get out, but maybe I wasn't ready."
“What about the surgery?” Sherlock said. “It might be awkward.”
"Nothing!" John grinned and fell back against the sofa.
"I'm thinking it's become very warm all of a sudden," he said, gazing up at Sherlock. He made a move to take the coat off again, but slowly.
Finally, John said, "But it is interesting, everything you learned just from a suitcase."
"It’s good," John mumbled.
“We’ve got sausages and vegetables, but no burgers,” Sherlock said. “What do you think?”
John rolled his eyes and huffed a soft laugh, embarrassed he'd misinterpreted but relieved by the break in tension. "Sherlock . . . I thought you were being serious."
There was too much going on in John's head to agree or disagree
"Did you go to bed at all?" John asked, flipping on the kettle and leaning against the counter to wait.
“I think we’ve established that none of us at this table know him or care what his name is,” Sherlock said. He looked straight at John as he asked, “So Mrs Hudson, John didn’t bring a date to the wedding. What do you think of that?”
John nodded. "Yes please . . ." He murmured.
“I know,” she said. “Still.”
John lifted his travel mug in thanks. "My interview is today," he said.
Sherlock looked over at his mother. Why had she said that?
"A casserole -- I found the recipe online and bought everything," he said. "And a salad, which hopefully I haven't screwed up." He looked over. "Does that sound all right? I should've asked, I suppose."
"I was driving you mad?" John asked loudly. He took a deep breath. "No, I'm not getting into this with you. We've got work now."
“You were always better than them, and then you were kind of the boss of them,” Sherlock said. “I’m sure you were nice because you always are, but other people can be jerks.”
Yet he hated leaving puzzles unsolved, and he was certain this was a puzzle. He sat down on his chair and stared out into the flat which suddenly seemed entirely too quiet. He used to love that quiet, but now it seemed wrong somehow. And that, of course, was because of John.
"Yeah, I know," John said. He took out his wallet and showed her.
“What do you mean –- go anywhere?” Sherlock asked, genuinely confused. Then he realised what John was talking about. “So sex is what you want then?”
"I -- it's okay, never mind," John said. "I just thought you'd want to try something different, just in case."
"Harry and I," John grinned. "It helped, didn't it? You wanted a story, and that's what you got."
“God, John,” Sherlock said. He let his hand find John’s cock and began stroking it. He too looked down to watch them touching each other.
"Hmm, a mystery," John smiled. "Any progress?"
"Do you work with the police a lot?"
Sherlock smiled. Yes, this was definitely flirting. "I hope the dinner doesn't put you off any of those things," he said.
John went to bed not long after Sherlock, making sure all of the food was put away before he went up. In the morning, he came down dressed to go out.
"I know you don't. I know it's not your thing," he said.
John nodded, using the break in kissing to do away with Sherlock's shirt properly and then began focusing on his jaw and neck.
Sherlock adjusted himself and pulled up his trousers. He grabbed his coat and hung it up. "Your behaviour this morning was very childish -- I hope you don't see this as a reward for that," he said with a smile.
Sherlock scooped a bit onto a plate and took it over to his desk. He read over his email and typed up all his notes and sent them to Lestrade.
"You feel so good..." he moaned, moving with Sherlock.
Sherlock started to type, but another message came through.
“We are,” Sherlock agreed. “Are you?”
"There's a lot. Hide and Seek, Truth or Dare, Never Have I Ever . . ."
Sherlock’s hips were rocking now against John’s hand. He did his best to keep moving on John as well, though he could feel his muscles coiling in need of relief. He leaned in and kissed John’s mouth roughly.
"Don't you care about it at all?" John asked.
"You had sex two days ago?" John asked before he could stop himself.
John sighed softly, watching Sherlock for a moment. He pushed himself up and moved over to the sofa. "I think I got a lot of good info -- should I start now?" he asked, reaching for his notebook.
"Oh please. You never sleep before one," John said.
The last drink had gone a bit to Sherlock’s head, and he could feel himself relax into their motion. He put his mouth near John’s ear and whispered, “You’re a good dancer.”
John smiled. "We aren't doing nothing. We're hanging out," he said. "And those caverns were fun, don't pretend you didn't enjoy it."
"What? Why would you think that?"
"Oh, okay," John nodded. Sherlock was blocking his path a bit, but John just smiled up at him.
“Why is it yours?”
“You see it?” Sherlock whispered.
“And what about dating? Or just going out?” she asked. “Have you seen any friends?”
John nodded. "I do."
As soon as he was out on the pavement,  John looked up at the flat. He didn't know what he had just agreed to -- he hardly knew this man and now he was going to move in with him. It was wild. But they weren't signing anything and if it didn't work out . . . well, maybe he’d keep looking for flats just in case.
“Of course not. He’s too old for me,” she said with a laugh. “But perhaps you know someone he might be perfect for?”
“I don’t go out,” Sherlock said to clarify, even though John hadn’t asked him the question. He took a gulp of tea. “Tomorrow . . . when you get home, should I do anything? I mean, should we?”
Sherlock looked over. John’s face seemed curious -- like he really wanted to know about this. John bent down to examine the headstone. He was curious. Sherlock liked that very much. He bent down as well and explained what he knew about the man’s life and death.
He ate a little food and then got a reply.
Sherlock’s parents were in front of the fire already, so he sat down and picked up the mug his mum had set out for him.
"I liked everything," John asked. “You did kiss me . . . do you remember?”
"Well, whatever is going on here, I'm glad," she said. "Someone in this family should finally be happy."
“Will you be seeing him again?” Mrs Hudson asked Sherlock.
“I am not,” she said and stepped to the side, pushing John toward the door. “He’s thinking of moving in,” she added before quickly moving down the stairs.
John bit his lip to fight a satisfied grin. He paid when they arrived and led Sherlock inside. "It's not much," he said.
“You’re shouting,” Sherlock said calmly. “You’ve shouted at me two times in the last two minutes. But I guess that doesn’t matter.”
“I don’t have a favourite,” Sherlock said. “Have you ever met me?”
John lay beside Sherlock. Even with the movie going things seemed too quiet. Awkward. When it was over, he shifted and got up. "I should go home now."
“Well, I’m definitely deprived,” Sherlock said. “I thought you were working today -- what time is it?”
John glanced at the time on his phone. 20:47. He sighed and stuffed it into his pocket again as the cab brought him closer to home. He had told Sherlock not to wait up when he left for his date, but he'd hardly been out a couple hours.
“That doesn’t seem to describe what either of us just said we wanted,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock pushed a finger slowly inside John, beginning with a light pulse. As John's body adjusted, he began to pump before sliding another finger in. As good as it all felt, Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if John had done this before. A part of him -- the jealous part -- did not even want to consider it. However, John was quite confident -maybe none of this was new. He decided to just trust John's reactions.
John reached down and touched Sherlock's hair again. The sound of the vibrator was driving him crazy, never mind Sherlock's hands and mouth on him. "You'll take care of me, won’t you?" he asked softly.
John smiled. "You too," he said.
"It doesn't," John said again, his voice harder. "It's just . . . it's not true. If someone said untrue things about you wouldn't you correct them? If it was true, it wouldn't matter."
Sherlock grabbed his clothes and rushed in. He grabbed a cloth and wiped up his stomach and wrist and then splashed some water onto his face. He quickly dressed and fiddled with hair. He took a deep breath and then checked the mirror. He looked all right. He came out and said, “I don’t think I look too crumpled.”
"I don't care either way," Harry said. "It needs to be said to John and you're his . . . whatever you two are together."
Sherlock had begun work immediately after getting back. He was in the flow and feeling very good. Especially after he kicked Mrs Hudson out of the flat. She’d come up to borrow some milk and had begun berating him for the mess he was making. He let her go for a few minutes, but she soon became too distracting, so he made a comment about not being interested in her complaints about laziness and now her complaints about work, sending her downstairs with a bottle of milk and the hope he’d be able to focus for the rest of the evening.
John came through the door and looked over at them at the desk. "I was able to leave early. All good?"
“What do you write about?”
Sherlock slipped open the button on John's jeans and undid the zip. "Can I touch you?" he whispered in John's ear.
“I don’t know -- one of those tricks of yours,” Sherlock said. “You occasionally have forced me to reveal things I’ve been hiding -- do one of those things.”
"For what?" John shifted so the coat fell of the ground.
"I missed you, too," John said.
“It’s Christmas Eve,” she said in a sing-song voice. “Father Christmas comes tonight.”
"What? Oh, for God's sake. How many times do I have to tell you we're not together?" John asked.
John moved away long enough to get his clothes off. He couldn't stop looking at every inch of Sherlock. "You're really sexy," he murmured.
Sherlock stood for a few moments in the quiet room. He was just glad to be going home. He got himself dressed and looked in the mirror. His clothes covered the worst of his injuries, which he was glad for. He looked around for his bag, hoping his brother had saved it. He found it and pulled out his computer. It was locked, but eventually Sherlock figured out the new password and immediately checked for a message from John. He wasn’t sure if it was safe to respond so he just read through the posts, feeling more excited with every memory.
"Are you doing something with her then?"
John just stopped her from touching a beaker. "Don't touch anything. It could be poisoned, and that's not an empty threat around here. My room is upstairs."
Sherlock nodded and then said, "Yes . . . just slow, okay?" he added softly.
"Oh. Well, maybe you just haven't found the right person."
John turned to look at him. "You left me," he said again. "Why did you even bring me if you weren’t going to let me help?" he asked.
“Yes, the overly eager employee who contacted the police before contacting Mr Altamont will eventually be relieved of her position, but yes, that’s it. You’ve solved the case. I’ll be in touch when you are required.”
Sherlock followed her. When they got away from the other kids, she grabbed his hand again and leaned against him.
Sherlock was full and tired when he finally headed up to bed Christmas night. He had eaten almost all of the cheese his mother had bought him and then managed to eat quite a bit at dinner as well. It had tasted good and, though, he’d never admit it to anyone, it had brought back nice memories of his childhood. He climbed into his bed after midnight and turned out the light.
“Just don’t burn down the cabin,” Sherlock’s mum said.
Sherlock was both confused and annoyed. “Well, I’m going to find the thief,” he finally said and ended the call.
"We're good together," John said. "A good pair."
“Are you drunk already?” he smiled.
"I don't understand what's wrong," Sherlock said. He threw down his cigarette butt and started walking.
"Sherlock, she just said she was going to see Clara."
"I'm just worried maybe you hit your head or something and they didn't know." John moved close to him and held his chin, looking in his eyes. "Follow my finger."
“More what?” Sherlock said. He tensed again.
John smiled and kissed over Sherlock's jaw, tugging his hair again to tilt Sherlock's head and continue kissing and biting along his neck.
"Not yet. I'm not sure what I want to make yet. Are you craving anything specific?" John asked.
About half way through the film, Sherlock said, “I want everything to be normal. To stay that way.” He didn’t turn his head and he kept his voice a whisper.
"Still . . . maybe alcohol won't help. Does your head hurt? Your scans were clear . . ."
John left the flat and headed back to the cafe. When he walked in, she was there, standing in line. John hurried behind her. "Nice day," he told her.
Sherlock tangled their legs, pushing himself into John’s body. “We don’t have any clothes on,” he said stupidly before kissing John’s mouth again. Then he leaned forward even more, pushing John onto his back. He kept kissing his mouth, but let his hand move down to John’s hip, gripping it tightly. “This okay?” he asked.
“Good,” Sherlock said.
They headed outside. “It’s been a while,” his father said. “Do you remember how to do it?”
He led them downstairs and outside. He set the box down to open the shed. He brought the box in and sat down. “Let’s make some tea before we get to work,” he said, as he filled the tin kettle with water and set it on the hot plate.
"I'm sorry. It's a work thing. Not the clinic but something else."
"Maybe we can play something for background noise," he said.
"John!" Harry walked in and hugged him tightly.
She threw a look up the stairs that John didn't quite understand, a kind of annoyed fondness. "Well, I'm glad it's all fine,” she said with a smile. “It was nice seeing you again."
Sherlock smiled against John’s ear. He had a decision to make, he knew that. He closed his eyes for a moment to clear his head -- this decision needed him to be clear -- and thought. About pleasure but also about consequences. He opened his eyes. “Would you like to find out?” he asked softly.
“Help me?” Sherlock asked.
“Yes sir,” Sherlock said. He went downstairs and as soon as he hit the pavement, he lit a cigarette. He inhaled deeply and felt the smoke fill his lungs. He stood still smoking and then made his way to the Chinese, waiting outside and smoking another cigarette. When the food was ready, he headed back home, smoking one more. This one made him feel a bit nauseous but he didn’t mind.
"No idea," John smiled. "I thought you like answering questions."
"You mean I figured something out?" she said with a grin. "I found the solution before the great detective and his blogger did?"
He thought about the conversation they’d had in John’s bedroom last night. Obviously, John had not understood what Sherlock was trying to tell him. He thought for a few moments. What precisely had he been trying to tell John? Now he needed to solve this one.
"No, but that sort of thing isn't about changing," he said.
John nodded and sipped his tea, looking around Sherlock's room. It wasn't as decorated as his own, but that didn't surprise him.
"Why?" he asked, genuinely curious. "Why have you become John Watson's biggest fan all of a sudden?"
Sherlock slid John’s computer over and got up and moved to his desk. He spent some researching and then stood up. “I’m going out,” he said.
"I'm sorry, I appreciate your help but I don't appreciate you trying to hassle me about it. I didn't mean to inconvenience you, I'm just going to get back to work."
John bit his lip again and nodded. "Yes sir, I can handle it," he said. "Anything you want."
John nodded. "Thank you."
"God, now,” John moaned, shifting in the seat again. “I’m close.”
“It’s . . .” Sherlock leaned over close to John and reached out for his hand. “Your sweaters, John . . . they’re ridiculous.”
Sherlock thought for a moment. “What about this trip? It was his idea . . . should I go?” he asked. “He didn’t choose a place or anything yet.”
John watched Sherlock's hands for a moment before switching to watching his face instead. He was flushed and fascinated. John leaned in and kissed him again, his own fingers tangled in Sherlock's hair. Sherlock melted into the kiss, dropping back against the bed and squeezing his arms around John to hold him close. After a few minutes, he turned their bodies so they were lying side by side. He reached round and held John’s cock softly before beginning a slow stroke.
Sherlock stood up. “They’ve got a little pit in back and there was some wood there as well,” he said. “Let’s go look and then I can make a salad while you get it going.”
“Stop it," John said, getting up to move.
Sherlock leaned in, gave him a quick kiss, and said, "That's because we are."
"Good," Sherlock said. "Celebrating is . . . unnecessary."
Harry wandered over and looked over his shoulder. "What are you working on?"
Sherlock smiled. “Those caverns were good,” he said, remembering. “And today’s been good as well.” He splashed some water at John. “Do you think we should head back though? It’s been a while since you’ve eaten and I know how you get when you don’t get food,” he added, splashing again.
But that’s not what he did. When he finished, he fell asleep for an hour and then for some reason, he found himself on Molly’s Facebook face, scrolling through her list of friends.
“Sleeping problems?” Sherlock asked. “Perhaps I should know about that.”
“I agree,” Sherlock said to Mrs Hudson. “What now?” he asked John.
John bit his lip to fight a smile. "Yes sir," he said, moving around Sherlock to get to the bedroom.
"I'll be right back," he said, standing to go to the bar.
"No," John said quickly, holding his arm. "Don't change."
“The lottery is a tax on the gullible,” Sherlock humphed.
John smiled. "So . . . let’s do a little trip together. Find out how much we’ve changed.”
When John woke up in the morning, he took a quick shower and went down to start breakfast for both of them, wondering if Sherlock found a case he liked.
“Could you lift your arms and hold the headboard, please?” Sherlock asked and then quickly added in a sterner voice, “Arms up.”
"It’s perfect," John said, wrapping his arm around Sherlock's shoulders.
"I brought this picture of us from the zoo trip we took a couple years ago," John said. "I think this was just before we snuck off and then got in trouble."
“A rat? I thought they wanted a dog?” Sherlock said, then he glanced over and pretended to zip his lips. But then he unzipped them and asked, “Do you care if I lie down? Maybe your story will help me fall asleep.” He zipped his lips again and turned and stretched out on the sofa, making sure his feet stayed away from John. He nodded at John to continue.
Sherlock thought for a moment. “All right, yeah,” he said. “We should plan something, I mean.” He paused for a moment. “Does your mum know you’re here?”
"Are you talking about a client? Someone was here?" John asked. He was already looking around to find the most likely place he'd have to start the disinfecting.
“I’ve always liked you more,” Sherlock confessed. “I mean, I’m not sure I knew it was . . . the kissing type of more, but you’ve always been different.”
"I just woke up, I heard shouting," he said.
“Right now?” Sherlock ask, lifting his hips a little.
"I promise," John said. "I'll just tell you everything wrong with it," he grinned.
“I’m investigating the theft,” he said.
"Everything feels good when we're together," Sherlock said.
"I'm going to let you work, okay?"
“On occasion, I may need a mind like yours,” Mycroft said. “Not this time, obviously, but in the future.”
John squeezed his hand. "Good. If we stay in touch, the distance won’t seem as bad," he said.
“If you’re not police, why are you asking? You an art lover?”
John realised he wanted a drink, which would allow him to listen to chatter as he made his way to the bar. He turned and bumped into someone standing too close.
"No! No. I'm not upset. I've just been thinking," he said.
“I’m not a child -- stop talking to me like one,” Sherlock said angrily. He lifted his hand to his head and rubbed it lightly. “Since the minute I got here, everyone’s been treating me like a child, and I’m sick of it.”
Obviously Sherlock had thought about this already, but had decided that perhaps it might be better for some of his living habits to be discovered when they occurred. “I don’t keep regular sleeping hours,” he said. “And while it won’t be my intention, I cannot guarantee that you won’t be disturbed at some point.”
"I know, but I really don't mind. Your space is invaded enough," he said, glancing at the stairs.
Sherlock lay back flat on the bed. “Could we try it like this instead?” he asked, holding onto John’s arm.
“To be a ghost he’d have to have died. It may surprise you to find out that I -- a detective -- had already considered that option. No obituary, no record of death,” Sherlock said. He took a sip of tea. “Maybe all this is stupid, John . . . maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m just desperate . . .”
John’s face flushed with embarrassment.
John threw the pillow back at him. "Stop it, Sherlock."
"Oh, we'll sort that after you see the place and decide. Follow me," she said, starting up the stairs. John followed her. She knocked on the door and heard someone moving around up in the flat.
When a voice answered, he said, “One of your workers completed a job here a few days ago, and now the water’s acting up again -- could you please send him out to check on it?”
“Tedious tradition,” Sherlock said under this breath.
"Put your head here," he said, patting his thigh again.
John hummed around his mouthful, lifting away to grin at Sherlock before continuing again. He hollowed his cheeks as he came up, sucking harder at the head.
“Sherlock!” Jim called. He and Ellen walked over.
Sherlock looked at the band but didn’t watch them. He was tired of watching. He moved a little behind John, standing close and slipping his arm around his body. He took a drink and smiled to himself. After a while, though, Sherlock grew impatient. “How much longer?” he asked, leaning down to whisper in John’s ear.
John hummed sleepily but didn't open his eyes yet, shifting on the bed.
John nodded. "Yeah," he said. "I would like that a lot."
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “I’d like you to.”
“When --” Sherlock started and then stopped. “Right,” he said instead. “I’ll be working. I’ll see you . . . at some point.”
John's whole body warmed at Sherlock's touch. His mind played back the two of them on Sherlock's chair and based on the look Sherlock was giving him, he was sure his own pupils dilated at the image. "It wasn't . . ." he paused and tried to get his thoughts in order. "I can show you.”
John met his gaze and his fingers faltered for a moment, but then he kept going. "Yeah?"
John nodded. "Maybe we should take something off?"
“At what?”
“Not really,” Sherlock said. He looked over at John.
"Don't start falling into uncivilised behavior on me now, Sherlock. We've made it this far."
“I know that,” Sherlock said. “I know what we are.”
John glanced over. “Maybe the next day,” he said.
"I haven't, no. In fact I feel it even more, I think."
“Paris,” Molly said.
Then he dragged himself from the bed and got dressed before heading downstairs.
“What can I do for you, Mrs Hudson?” he called down.
John nodded. "We don't have to rush into anything."
"You should do the right thing -- you should do the right thing because it’s right but also because you want the police to keep working with you," John said.
John stood up but Mycroft moved in front of him.
Sherlock nodded, even giving her a small smile.
"No," Sherlock said with a smile. "Just desperate."
Mrs Hudson sighed.
John nodded, biting his lip. "Yes. Sherlock, please," he murmured.
"She's never been a pleasant drunk," he said. "At least she didn't break anything."
Sherlock slumped a little in the pew and stared at the paper. He hadn’t known Molly’s middle name and now he did. He had a feeling that’d be the most interesting part of this whole day.
John looked around the flat and thought for a moment before typing out his reply.
“All right, we’re leaving,” Sherlock’s dad said. “Call us when you’re ready to be picked up but don’t call us if there’s a problem -- solve the problem. You’re both smart young men -- don’t hassle us, all right?” He gave them a smile and grabbed Sherlock’s mum’s hand.
Sherlock sat down next to him, moving John’s computer onto his lap to read it over again himself. “The police should’ve contacted me about this.”
John blinked as he was rushed out of the flat, barely saying a goodbye before the door was shut again. As he climbed down the stairs, Mrs Hudson came out.
"It’s not . . . readable. I mean for civilians," he said.
Sherlock slipped on his coat.
"Yes, right now," Sherlock said. "What does it matter? Don't you love someone right now? It's supposed to last forever, right?"
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, filing the detail away for later. “Do you work tomorrow?” he asked.
"Sure," John said. He didn't know what else to say just yet. He still wasn't really sure what was going on and what Sherlock was saying to him.
Sherlock was both pleased and irritated by John’s response. “All right then, that’s fine,” Sherlock said. “This presumes nothing goes wrong with the plumbing before then, obviously. If there’s a disaster over the weekend, I won’t be signing anything for you on Monday.”
It’d been a few days since he’d interacted with the client, so he sent a quick message to say he was still working.
She smirked and got up to help him. John tried to wiggle free from the ties. They had used zip ties for his hands and rope for his feet so there were slim chances of getting free.
“I’m glad you’re home,” she said and then headed downstairs.
"With your head by my feet. It’s not really necessary with the bags."
“I’ve been texting him every hour, making a case for why I needed to go home. He’s been too busy being annoyed by me to worry about you,” Sherlock said. “I think what’s been proven is that, even when injured, I’m smarter than him.”
"I need John for a different part of the case, sort of undercover," Greg said.
“I liked all of it,” Sherlock said. “Did you?”
"What? Go out for dinner?" John asked.
"The . . . physical part. I mean, if that's the kind of love you're talking about," Sherlock said. "I have to admit, after thinking about, it is the kind I'm talking about it, but we don't have to do that if you're not interested -- it's not mandatory, for me, I mean."
"Well, we know who it is. We just need proof. I had a good time with his girlfriend. Tomorrow should be better."
"Oh,” she said. “Still friends?”
"Twice a day, if we really wanted," John said, his fingers tracing circles on Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock looked over at John. "Harry's not in a programme -- she was certain she could do it on her own." He glanced quickly at her before looking back at John. "Which has not happened obviously. She can tell you more about it in the morning." He turned his body now toward Harry. "Go to bed now," he said.
Sherlock took a long breath. That was exactly what he wanted -- to be able to look at John, to know it was him, to know it was something they were sharing. He sat up and scrambled around for the lube bottle and condom box before handing them to John.
"It does feel good . . . do you like it?"
“It’s what you wanted as well, I presume,” she said. “It’s a shock for you, isn’t it?”
John looked through the options and picked from his own collection, but something slow and easy to listen to.
A loud noise escaped from deep in Sherlock’s throat as his hand moved quickly over his cock until he was coming, arching his back a bit as he pressed his head against the pillow. John watched his face before letting go. He buried into Sherlock's neck as he too came.
“Is it our guy?” Sherlock said, excitedly before looking closely. “No . . . oh well, good on the kid for making a little extra money,” he added with a laugh. “Wait – didn’t we just see that woman kissing a dark-haired man and now she’s holding hands with that elderly guy. Think she’s running some kind of scam?”
Finally, Sherlock reached down and grabbed John’s arm. “You’re going to have to stop,” he said. “I can’t take anymore . . .”
John shrugged. "He enjoys the benefits of my work by watching the band while I do my work. You should go now. I'm not interested . . . obviously." He looked up at the man with a wide, happy smile.
“Are you back to being boring?”
Mycroft could see his brother really did not remember anything about the day of the accident. “You were working when it happened,” Mycroft said. “I should hope your brain was at its best. No, Sherlock, you are not going to rehab -- well, not that kind of rehab. You’ve been prescribed rest, relaxation, respite. Well, respite for me at least. No work until you’re well.”
“Lying by you on the bed,” Sherlock confessed.
"I know what it sounds like because I feel the same about you."
“You do make me feel good, John,” Sherlock mumbled between kisses. “You have since you moved in here and now you are in this way, too.” He turned his attention to John’s cock again. “Is this how you like it?” he asked, looking down to watch their hands moving.
He couldn’t look up at her. “I spent so much time remembering and now . . . the flat feels different and John’s gone off . . .”
“Right,” Sherlock said, reaching for the bag. “No better way to convince me you don’t treat me like a child than to throw away my things. . .” he added as he began to look through the bag.
“We’ll come get you,” Sherlock’s mum said. “Sherlock, the soup’s lovely. Have you got any good camping recipes?”
"Is it okay? Is it good?" John asked, moving it slowly.
John looked and each one and nodded. "I know."
“The biscuit’s absorbing the alcohol,” Sherlock said. He stood up and turned on the kettle. “Don’t mock me anyway, I’m convalescing.”
John turned toward the television, holding the remote on his belly.
Sherlock waited and then put the kettle on for tea. He reached into the cupboard and pulled out the two mugs he and Mycroft had used when they were small. He found himself smiling a little.
"I don't think anyone is friends like us," John said.
"Nope. I've wanted to meet you since John's first blog post. I'm not going anywhere. He'll be home soon anyway because he's probably worried about what I'm saying to you."
John glanced over. "It's nothing special, not really," he said.
“Come tonight.”
Sherlock paused and then said, “Are you just doing this to have something to hold over me? Some way for you and Lestrade to subtly point out my flaws, despite the fact that I care nothing about my inability to make strung out women trust me? Is that why you’re doing this? Because we shouldn’t compete -- I know I joked about it yesterday -- but if there’s some kind of tension here, you should probably just say it.”
“Well, John . . .,” Sherlock said, his voice trailing. “It’s hard to say . . . because I don’t know what your reaction will be.”
"Why's that?" John asked.
Sherlock made a grumble and rolled over. “Not interested,” he called back.
"No?" John asked as they walked.
“I didn’t expect --” Sherlock started to say. He followed John, glancing around at the sparse decoration. “But I won’t without.” He reached out and held onto John’s waistband.
“Why?” Mycroft responded.
"I think it's just weird goop," John smiled. "I have a handful of little army men." He put them on the bed.
"I went for company," John said, shrugging casually.
“Come on then,” Sherlock said. He kept his coat and opened the door, waving his arm to encourage John to hurry.
Most of John’s dates seemed bad to Sherlock, but he knew well enough to keep that to himself. “Why’s that then?” he asked.
“All right then. Don’t bother us with your pranks anymore, please. And tell Juno we said hello.”
“I’m sorry our lives aren’t as fascinating as yours is,” she said, drying her hands on a tea towel. “What do you and John do all day that keeps the precious Sherlock entertained?”
John smoothed his hair and yawned as he sat up. "I can't believe I slept on the sofa."
John's free hand slipped into his hair and tugged softly as he kissed back, his hand moving faster. "M'close . . ."
“Then stop pestering me -- it’s very likely tonight we’ll have the breakthrough we need and Holmes and Watson will have solved the case. I can’t be dealing with this right now, Sherlock. Have some trust in John.”
"Very busy," John nodded.
"When we get back, I’ll get one," he said. "You shouldn't do that, you know."
John fell asleep easier than the past few nights, wrapped up in Sherlock's arms. It was comfortable and warm.
"Just going to head to the shop around the corner and see what I can find.”
____________________________________
"Yes, but hopefully it'll go by quickly and you'll be home before you know it."
John took the men and looked through each one, biting his lip as he craned to see what else was in there.
Sherlock turned around, holding his newly poured cup of tea. "Did you get milk? I've had to use the last of it," he said, taking a sip. He looked over. "Why are you wearing my things?" he said sharply.
She turned back to the sink. “Fine,” she said. “When I’ve finished cleaning up your mess, you can come downstairs and help me.”
John shook his head. "It's going to be very odd trying to get everything back to normal."
“I hope so,” she said. “I like John and it’s good that he’s here.”
“All right then,” Sherlock said. “Shall we head back and pick up the suitcase to take in?”
"I know, it's a habit," John said. He grabbed his coat and looked at Harry. "Ready?"
"I know it’s frustrating that he stays at school during breaks,” she said. “But these things happen . . .”
“As a doctor?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock thought for a moment. “How many other men have you taken up to you room so far?” he asked.
“Thanks,” she said. She slid her hand over and grabbed his hand. “I’m so glad we met.”
“Take off your clothes,” Sherlock commanded.
Immediately Sherlock was back in the present, but he felt he had to ask.
"Shh," John said softly.
“You know what it means,” she said. “I’m teasing you,” she added before turning to John and saying,” He’s lovely actually, don’t worry.”
John nodded and smiled. "We are."
"What? Are you going to beat me up? I can take you," John said.
“You won’t be there,” Sherlock said. “I’ll be by myself.”
"I remember, Sherlock. It’s going to be fine," he said.
Sherlock snuggled up against John. “This is good,” he said quietly. “We should have done this before.”
"A little bit, but I think it's because I did it with you," he said. He shifted a bit. "It's a good different."
John actually had been looking and had found an article about a robbery at an art gallery. He read it out to Sherlock and asked, "What do you think?"
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s body, squeezing his arse as the kiss became deeper. He could feel himself stiffening and pressed his hips into John’s. “You need a condom,” he whispered as his hands slipped to John’s front and he began unbuttoning his trousers.
"You can come with us," said Todd. “I mean my family will be there, but it’ll be fun.”
Sherlock got up and moved over to his desk, getting to work. Soon enough, he tuned out the sound of John in the kitchen and dug into the research. Eventually he pushed his chair back from the desk. “Enough for tonight,” he said. “Excellent.”
“Oh, no, no, no,” she said. “John and I won. Not you.”
She didn’t turn away from the kettle but said, “Fine, I’ll put something together if you insist. Actually, I got something special for you from the French market -- let me see if I can find it.” She moved over to the fridge and pulled out a cheeseboard with some holly as garnish in each corner. “Oh, here it is,” she said, reaching for some crackers.
“We came a couple times when you were a baby,” his mum said. “Back when we were young and thought it was fun to sleep on cots. Then we realised beds were a million times better, and we stopped coming.” She winked at Sherlock’s dad.
“In other words, fine -- I’m fine,” Sherlock said. “I’m better than yesterday and thus I’m more confident this idea of going away is even more ridiculous than I was then. I think I should just come home. I can ‘relax’ there.”
"I hope so," Sherlock said, turning to look toward the kitchen. "I should check on it."
“I didn’t,” Sherlock said. “I don’t enjoy any of that sort of thing really.”
“It was good,” Sherlock said, giving John a sly smile. “Which is why I might be interested. However, I’m aware that frequently people who did what we did also do other things . . . like spend every moment of the day together or nag each other or want clear answers to every single question asked. Any thoughts on those things?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “At least you were useful today,” he said.
Sherlock had set the laptop on the bed and was standing by the window smoking. The next few days should be safer but busy. When he got back into bed, he looked at the blog again and saw John’s reply.
“We were hoping to meet him,” his father said. “Everything going well with all that?”
"Okay," he said. "Are you going to try and fight me?"
"Meddled? Hardly! I just borrowed your coat. I didn't search it out anything." He hovered his hands over the pockets. "Should I?"
John curled into the curve of Sherlock's body. "Yes," he said. "This is nice."
Sherlock slipped his card onto John’s nightstand and then followed John to the door. He gave him a quick kiss and said, “Nice to properly meet you.”
John moved closer and passed him the shovel.
“The flooring was loose -- I just stepped through,” Sherlock said.
When Sherlock let them into the flat, he said, "If you want to have a nap, I've changed your sheets . . . I hope you don't mind I was in your room. I didn't do anything else."
"I do," John smiled. "I don't see them very often -- it's just my sister now."
Sherlock climbed into the bed and lay awkwardly flat on his back. "Is this all right -- do you mind that I'm here?"
“I love you, too,” Sherlock promised.
"Yes," John moaned, pushing Sherlock's shirt back to get it off.
“Well, just listen to John, Sherlock – he knows about all this. He’s the responsible one,” Mrs Hudson. “And no more yelling!” she yelled before she disappeared into her flat.
John pressed into his hand and stared down at him. "I think you were looking," he said.
"You don't have to be quiet -- you're not annoying," Sherlock said, settling in at his desk.
"About what?" John asked.
"I think I want to get up," Sherlock said. "And go downstairs -- you can come with me . . . I just want to get up."
Sherlock’s attempt to think of nothing led to hours of his revisiting memories, most of which seemed utterly irrelevant at the moment -- riding a horse when he was five, needing stitches when he was ten, his first class at uni, a trip to the dentist. He ended up lost in thoughts, which was precisely the opposite of his plan. Eventually, though, it did exhaust him and he fell into a deep sleep.
“Of course not,” Sherlock said. “I was just having a bit of fun.”
Sherlock finished his drink. “Do you like dancing?” he asked, without offering his own answer.
"All of those things," John smiled.
Without setting down his cup, Sherlock let his body move toward John. He took a sip of tea. “Are you tired from your trip?” he asked.
John shook his head. "It's . . . it's not a case. It's Harry," he said.
"I would like a cup, yes," Harry said before John could answer.
“We’ll see, John -- remember you’re the sensible one. Maybe I’ll get a job, too,” Sherlock said. “But not today or tomorrow or the next. The next few days are just ours.”
“I’m a detective, not a stand in at your police events,” Sherlock had said to Lestrade the day before.
"I've gone to a few," Harry said quietly, her eyes glancing down to the floor.
"It hasn't been terrible," he said. He almost admitted it was more his racing thoughts than the sofa itself that had troubled his sleep, but he stopped himself. "But it'll be nice to spread out on the bed again."
“Are you disappointed?” Sherlock asked.
John laughed. "Does that happen often?"
Sherlock stopped for a minute. “Obviously there’s more -- I mean it’s been six years, John,” he said. “But I don’t know how I’m supposed to choose what to tell you. Most of my experiences at school were not very good -- I don’t want to list them out to remind you of all the bad things about me. I’m not trying to keep secrets or make a big deal. If something comes up -- like if something happens and I have experience with it or whatever -- I will tell you. I just don’t know what to say.”
"You should get an early night tonight or maybe a nap," Sherlock said. "I mean, you've probably not slept very well on the sofa and all."
He read the two new posts over and over, looking for some clue -- some message for Sherlock. But there was nothing. Nothing that Sherlock could see. He double checked his security and then returned to the blog. He clicked the comment box and wrote
John finished up his last few patients, heading out to hail a cab. He could do his paperwork the next time he came in.
"Well, I want a romantic relationship," John said. “And sex obviously."
"I'm his doctor. His primary," he said. "Dr John Watson, I should be listed in his file."
"Should we unpack a little?" Sherlock asked, getting up. "Maybe we should get ready for bed. Do you want to sleep on the floor in the sleeping bags or you could take the sofa and I'll see if I can find a cot or something?"
“It is,” Sherlock said. “See? Don’t do yourself down, you got there in the end.” He patted John’s head.
"A nice bottle of wine," John said. "That's a good idea."
"Really? You've never stolen anything from a workplace?" Sherlock said, with a smile as he squeezed John's hand.
"That's okay," he smiled. "You have other skills."
“In your dream, did my hand move? Slow? Fast?” Sherlock said. “Tell me . . .”
“Don’t nag me,” Sherlock said. “Save it for your patients.” He took another sip. “You sleep okay?”
"I would want to go to Greece and get a lamb gyro fresh from the source."
John smiled. "Thanks -- I’m not into anything fancy. Black coffee’s perfect for reading."
John stood at the doorway and, for the hundredth time, cursed the fact that he never got taller than Harry. "What are you doing here?"
"What do you mean -- how do you feel?" John asked, his eyes moving over Sherlock's face.
Once they arrived home, Sherlock set to work on the printouts, having given the flash drive to John. After a while, a noise escaped from Sherlock’s throat. looked up at John. “See anything?” he asked.
"Very exciting," John murmured, leaning a little closer to him.
Sherlock smiled to himself and then reached over and petted John’s head. “There, there,” he said. “Don’t feel bad – maybe they’ll have a question on ugly jumpers. I bet you’ll get that one straight away.”
"Sherlock," John said, his voice more of a moan than he intended.
"Who's this?" Harry asked, tossing the skull from hand to hand.
Sherlock glanced over and then looked away. “You know I do,” he said. “But what about cases?”
John served himself a plate and dug in. "This is great, Sherlock. Thank you."
John looked over and couldn't help a small smile. What luck! "I was invited, believe it or not," he said. "I went to school with Molly."
For a second, Sherlock questioned himself, but then he hit Send. There was no turning back now. A few minutes passed before she responded.
“Good night, John,” Sherlock said, holding John closely. He lay there for a couple minutes and then said, “Are you already asleep or can I say one more thing?”
“Like sometimes you slept in here with me, like it was our bed,” Sherlock said quietly. “Or on the sofa while we were watching the television, we . . . you know. . . cuddled.”
"We can figure it out first," John said.
"Hmm, I don't know if I can work it in my schedule."
“I’m going to do that as well,” Sherlock said, even though he didn’t really feel like reading. He got up and looked over his shelf and found a book he’d started but hadn’t finished. He took it over to his chair and started to read.
"What? Oh no," John said. "You probably won't even know it’s happening. It’s fine," he said.
John started rocking his hips, moaning softly as he moved.
“I don’t want to,” he said into the phone. “Please -- I’m asking you to please not make me do this. I didn’t lie. I told you the truth about it, and I told you I don’t want to go. Please.”
"John? John! Now where are you going?" Mrs Hudson hurried after him, swatting his arm with the dish towel again.
John shrugged. "I don't know how to explain. It's just something I want."
John held how gaze and nodded. "Well, I'm glad you're better. And I'm glad you offered it to Harry as well." He touched Sherlock's hand softly. "Thank you."
"Right," John said. He leaned back and looked out of the window.
"No, John. Well, yes, of course, but actually I need you."
“That’s not really my cup of tea,” Sherlock said.
John nodded. "I did like that. It was comfortable. Nice."
"You are really obnoxious, John Watson," Sherlock said with a smile. "Your turn or is the game done?"
______________________________________________________
John glanced over and saw the look on Sherlock’s face. “You’ll figure it out,” he said. He took a sip of tea. "I mean, do you have to be dead to be a ghost?" he said.
Instead of flicking through channels, Sherlock got up and found a DVD. “It’s an old crime documentary – I think my mum might have given it to me a while ago. That okay?” he asked when John brought the plates in.
When John finished Greg let him leave. He wasn't injured, and he didn't want to be checked out. He just wanted to go home. He was still holding Sherlock's hand as they walked to the street.
Sherlock held his cards right up to his face. "You sure you shuffled well?" Sherlock said. He lay two cards on the table. "Two please."
“You’re welcome,” she said. “Anything else you’d like to thank me for?”
John took a quick shower, shaved his face, and then went to grab his things when he realised he didn't have to. It was his bathroom too now. He cleaned up and left everything in its place before heading out for the stairs.
"It's very good," he nodded. He looked over at Sherlock, scooting a bit closer as well.
John laughed and Sherlock relaxed a little. “Do you really think you could attract clients with your blog?” he asked.
“You’re in charge of this, not me,” Sherlock said. His heart was pounding. “The flat -- maybe she took him to their flat. Give me the address.”
"Hi," he said. "I'm home," he added.
He went outside and listened for the car which eventually left. He finished his cigarette and went in and grabbed the phone.
“I know,” she said. “But you’ll have to wait a little longer.” She grabbed his mug from the floor and moved into the kitchen, rinsing it after turning on the kettle. “You need some sleep -- your room’s clean, the sheets are on the bed.”
"Well, I just didn't realise that being around me all the time translated to having feelings for me," he said. "I didn't know you were interested in that sort of thing," he said.
“Wait,” Sherlock said. “I need my phone -- have you got it?”
"But it's him as well, isn't it?"
John let them in and immediately remembered the last time, pressing Sherlock against the door. He smiled wider as he faced Sherlock who kissed John roughly as his arms slid up John’s back, pulling him even closer. John moaned into the kiss, and Sherlock pushed back against him, sliding his hands to begin undoing John’s belt. John started moving them towards the bedroom again, keeping as close as he could. Sherlock continued to try to get John's clothes off as they moved and then gave up, starting to take off his own.
“What do you mean by that?”
“You can,” she said. “But I will if you want -- when do you want to go?”
“All right,” Sherlock said. “New question, though: why is it embarrassing? Because I’m so disgusting?”
"I have mentioned it! Everyone has been talking about it all the time. But you were focused on that case and you probably don't remember. You know you do that."
When John woke up Harry was sitting at the end of the sofa, eyes red and puffy as she looked down at her hands.
He moved his eyes along the rows and paused on someone looking behind them. He had a sharp jaw and dark hair -- he was handsome. John tried to catch his eye, but he wasn't paying attention. Not to John anyway. John glanced around but couldn’t tell what the man was looking at.
Sherlock fell onto John’s bed, pulling him down on top of him. He kissed his mouth hungrily. He hadn’t thought a lot about this part of being together -- mostly he’d just been hoping to be around John all the time -- but this all felt so good, so urgent.
John put on his pajamas and then came out to join Sherlock. He sat on the sofa, close enough to cuddle if Sherlock wanted to.
“Don’t be silly,” she said. She glanced at John. “Nice to see you again, John.”
Sherlock had fallen asleep reading. When he woke the book was on his chest, but he couldn’t recall a single thing he’d read. Then he heard John moving around in the flat. He decided he’d just stay hidden in his room until John went silent. Then he heard thumping, and his already angry curiosity got the best of him.
John went on to his next job and put Baker Street out of his mind. He just wanted to get back home and enjoy his free weekend. After his last job, he picked up dinner and went back to his flat, settling at the desk to finish invoices and organise his appointments for the next week. When he got to filing away Mrs Hudson's, he realised he hadn’t written anything up for the second visit. Obviously, there was no charge as he’d done nothing, but the office wanted paperwork for everything. He checked the time and decided it wasn't too late for a phone call.
"Okay," Sherlock said. "Is there anything else you want to talk about?"
“Of course,” he said. “I want you to be happy.” It wasn’t a precise agreement, but it was true.
“I’m sure you have much more important people to see,” Sherlock said. “Thank you for coming out.”
Sherlock got up from his chair. "I think that's enough getting to know each other for now," he said as he moved back to his desk.
“Sherlock, I’ve been trying to reach you for hours,” Lestrade said. “Was your phone off?”
“I’m not hungry,” Sherlock said.
His mum laughed. “You are such a pain, Sherlock Holmes,” she said, pushing her legs underneath the duvet against his. “Get up and go. If you go out to the shed, be quiet, don’t lock yourself out, and clean up any messes you make.”
John laughed. "I'm wearing a suit to eat lunch in our own flat. I think that's interesting," he said.
John looked after him for a moment before nodding and following him. "Are you okay?"
"No, we can't," John said, holding Sherlock's hand and putting the other on his shoulder.
"All of them," John said.
"Why would it have made things worse?" John asked.
“All right,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock screwed up his face and then buried it in his cup.
Sherlock looked away but didn't let go of John's hand. He took a drink and then said, "Should I be afraid?"
"Yeah . . . you did eventually," John said.
"I don't mind. I just need to gain her trust? Have her tell me who the boss is?"
Sherlock shifted on the bed, pushing John back and moving between his legs. “You’re so sexy,” he said, looking down at John’s body. “I can’t wait to be inside you,” he added, dribbling some lube into his hand. He stroked John’s cock a few times and then dipped his hand lower, teasingly passing his finger over John’s hole.
