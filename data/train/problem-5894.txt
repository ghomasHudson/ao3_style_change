The intruder does move toward the front door, but comes to a stop when he’s only a foot away from Tony. “We’ll be in touch.”
“You’re supposed to be asleep, mister,” Tony calls out. He aims for reprimanding, but he’s pretty sure he just lands closer to exasperated.
Ares used to say it was because Hephaestus was the best at what he did. Why would any other god need to learn if they had him?
In the middle of his torso, carved out in a horrendous jagged shape, sits a large chunk of metal. Rusty wires are attached to the device, and his eyes follow them to a machine that looks very, very similar to a car battery.
This is his own mind. His own form of twisted punishment that won’t cease until he does something about it. Until he acts upon the promise he already made to Yinsen and his people.
He can’t help his natural curiosity toward everything, and Ares isn’t here to help him through his need to take things apart.
One knee to the ground, eyes squinted in anticipation for the worst, Tony waits for his systems to report the damage.
Without a glamour, the Arc Reactor can be seen sitting several inches into his chest, along with the ugly veins of scarring crawling outward.
“Which is why we took the liberty of coming up with something that’ll last a bit longer.” Hades and Steve finally turn to the table in the corner of the lab.
Hephaestus won’t lie, he loves the way Steve’s face lights up when he spots him. He tries to keep his demeanor as casual as it was previously, but he fails if Hades and his teasing smile are any indication.
Perhaps Zeus and Hera had been in love, a long time ago, but even then it was not the love of ballads, sonnets, and reverence. It was not the love mortals wrote about in their tales of the gods.
“How the–” Tony wants to rip the hand off his body. He wants to yell in frustration. “My ideas drive that company!” He turns to Pepper, and tries to steady his breathing by taking comfort in her calm, although extremely tense demeanor.
He can feel a deep hatred for this man like weeds in his chest, roots expanding and taking hold of his heart to squeeze until all that comes out is venom.
They remind him now more than anything else of Steve. Steve and his unique brand of recklessness and bravery. He would have followed that man anywhere.
(Steve fucking deserves to be happy. He needs to accept that Steve’s happy American Dream ending just doesn’t include Tony.)
“I know I’m a Lieutenant, but you can’t seriously believe I have that much influence?” Hephaestus frowns.
And because this is a war, and the circumstances are far too dangerous to allow for anything else, only a minute later, they continue on.
He chuckled dryly, wiping the back of his hand against his cheek. "That's me, Tony Stark, always demanding so much of you. But you never let me down, not once. I know you won't."
"Find Jackie. He needs you, just like I need you. Just like the whole world needs you. But you would've saved the world. So, retire, adopt Jackie, raise him like a superstar. He can be Jack Rogers, he doesn't have to have my name if you prefer it that way." His heart constricted as the words left his lips. Jackie was their dream, he was going to be their son, and they were going to be his parents together. "
Clint could've sworn he felt his heart stop momentarily at hearing Steve describe what it's like to miss his lover. It was unbelievable just how much Steve truly loved Stark. Nobody could talk about missing anyone like that and shatter Clint’s heart the way Cap just did.
Tony promised himself in that second that he'll be what Steve wants, his own needs be damned. It was a good decision because Steve kissed him so very gently, his kisses were barely more than brushes of his lips against Tony's.
"You finish the milk first like the big boy you are then you can have the hot chocolate." Tony smiled, pressing the cup into Jack's hands and keeping his hands over his to warm them.
Steve pulled his phone out and smiled as he found three missed calls from Tony. He dialed his number and held the phone close to his ear, expecting Tony to whisper next to a sleeping Jackie.
Setting the helmet on the control console, Tony stood up, blanket wrapped loosely around his shoulders and looked out at the vast emptiness of space. He's drifting, not in the way he promised Steve they would when he took them into space, but drifting nonetheless. And as he drifts, he will dream of him, and he will name the stars and the galaxies that he will see along his way after his eyes.
He pushed his knees up to his chest as much as he was able and hugged Tony's helmet close to his chest. Even in his farewell message, his voice was soothing, and Steve could not decide whether Tony was soothing himself or Steve. He hugged the helmet closer, desperately wanting it to be Tony. He wanted to be able to comfort him from whatever was bothering him, curl up behind him and trace the veins of his forearm and tell him that whatever it is, they can face it together.
Clint lowered his gaze in defeat. So much for time with Cap. Looks like Stark's the only one who'll ever take up space on his mind. He got up as well and poured himself a mug of coffee, taking it with him to the very rear of the jet to drink while he had secured the bikes. He could hear Steve on the phone as he began the task of unbolting them.
"But my biggest mistake was not calling you. I don't even know if you knew but I held onto that phone from the second it arrived in the mail. I took it everywhere with me. It was, in so many ways, my lifeline. Even if I never could bring myself to call you,
He chuckled sadly. "Same with you, you patriotic hunk of muscle wrapped in an American flag." He allows himself to tease, because what more can he lose. And this is Steve, his Steve. No amount of time or distance between them is going to change how he feels about him.
, I always knew you'd be there for me when I did call." Tony felt the first tear sting as it spilt over his eyelashes.
Tony took Steve’s hand in his and they held Jackie's little hand. "How did you get past the security code on the gate to the balcony?"
Tony shuddered at the impossibly fresh memory of everyone around him vanishing into dust. The memory that he wished would ebb just a fraction but continued to prove itself to be stubborn and remained lodged in every neuron of his brain.
"Not sleep good." Jack answered and shrugged his shoulders, the blankets slipping off them a little.
Bucky bites the inside of his lip as he thinks. “Do you think it’s because Steve still feels bad and he knows you must be as well?” Clint nods. “I don’t think he left his room after you told me that he locked himself up.” Bucky lowers his mug as his eyes ask the question. “I know because it’s way too quiet. It’s never this quiet when Tony is up.” Clint theorizes that Tony must still be with Steve in his room and not down in his workshop blasting his music away. “Could be. He’ll definitely be there for Steve.” Bucky says, bringing his mug up to his lips.
"Trust me." He murmured and Tony felt his tank top lifting off his hips and lower torso and soon over the arc reactor.
Tony felt his heart shatter as he heard Steve's voice. He's worse than the worst. How is Steve even with him at this point? He couldn't answer that question though. It was the only thing about Steve that he didn't understand.
Tony kissed his parted lips and jaw and cheeks and forehead, keeping him in his arms until his breathing slowed.
Tony stared after him until he felt Jack pulling on his sleeve. He looked down and Jackie opened his mouth for more muffin.
Tony watched as he licked his upper mustached lip afterwards. He bit his own and took a breath in on a sigh. “So, since our day has already started, what’s planned?”
Tony went silent as he remembered Steve's tired face from earlier in the day. "I don't need sleep if you hardly ever get it."
"Where to?" He asked, his voice breaking on the last syllable. Good job Stark. Way to woo Steve before he goes away on a mission that may last days. Then again, Steve didn’t specify the nature of the mission or whether anyone else was going.
Steve set the cup gently back on the railing. “It doesn’t have to be the start of your day. Go back to bed. Rest. Resume that beauty sleep of yours.”
Steve didn't know what to feel. Tony is alive and he's ecstatic about that, yet, he left him a goodbye message apologizing for things he didn't need to apologize for. He shook his head. He will not accept Tony's surrender. Because that's simply what it was. He can't sit idle and wait for things to somehow get worse. That's not what Tony does. Tony bends the situation to fit his needs, so Steve was finding it incredibly harrowing that he'd send him that message.
Steve nearly ran back to the compound. His body was covered in new wounds left by those taken by the mad titan, his soul was stretched wide across time, his heart was constantly poked by shards of glass, but he was closer to finding the balm that can heal it all. It smells like baby powder and motor oil.
"15 seconds Cap." Clint sounded panicked to his own ears. He considered a long range arrow to take out the sicko but with the way they were moving he could hit Steve.
That's not how he wants to remember the one he loved like no other; hurt by his own hands, the same hands he trusted to hold him and care for him. Steve failed him like he's never been failed before. And so many have failed him in his life, from those he didn't know, to the ones he trusted the most. None have failed him and let him down the way Steve shattered Tony's heart, both figuratively and literally.
After the shower, Steve insisted that he dress Tony, everything from underwear to bed clothes. He even dried and brushed his hair.
Clint ran his fingers through his hair, just then also catching Steve's eyes. They didn’t break eye contact and Steve was still talking with Stark.
Tony attempted to bite at his thumb but Steve pulled his hand back too quickly. “Are you going to make me ask?”
This was good. Steve was actually talking and it didn't feel like it was strained or like a confession either. Maybe he didn't do so bad after all? Oh who was he kidding? He screwed up big time. Steve just loved him more than he was capable of imagining to be mad at him. And he imagined big, futurist and all.
"I love you." Tony didn't know what else to say. He knew he should've just said exactly as he felt but whenever he tried, he clammed up. And he did love Steve. He'd love Steve over and over and over again for eternity.
Tony shook his head, he would not allow himself to think that word, not with Peter, and certainly not with Steve. "..if you're breathing, I hope to whatever deity that's listening that you are, but I just have to let you know all of this. And I want you to do one last thing for me, baby."
"Exactly. And at the time, he may have been. You’re not the one to blame." Tony soothed with a smile. Because I am. I didn’t ask JARVIS about Jackie before we got in the shower. He didn't voice that to Steve though. He didn't want him to leave feeling that Tony was hurt.
He was definitely going to be late now and traffic had slowed to an impossible crawl. FRIDAY told him his ETA was now 7:05 PM which was absolutely unacceptable, but it wasn’t as if he could will the cars in front of him to disappear into thin air.
“You love him.” Bucky finishes for him, his hand stilling at the nape of his neck. Clint nods. “There’s still time to fix things.” Bucky lifts Clint’s chin to look into his eyes. “You can fix this. Get yourself a third boyfriend.” He smiles and plants a kiss to Clint’s lips. Clint sinks his head back on Bucky’s chest, unable to stop his mind from replaying the events of late afternoon. He wipes away the tears collecting above his cheeks and sighs, trying to focus his sharp hearing on the rain shooting away at the glass of his window.
He was addicted. No he was drug. He couldn’t tell anymore and it didn't matter. There were many promises to be kept and many new ones to be made and here in his arms, there was no other place he'd rather be.
Maybe when this is all over, he can do that. Once he's defeated Thanos like Tony wants him to. Once they've defeated him together. They will adopt Jackie and they'll retire and be happy, but he'd still like to explore the outcomes of their different choices.
Steve's heart ached for him. He should've been able to adopt Jackie, even without himself. He was Tony's dream after all. And Jackie could've used a father who'd be as loving and caring as Tony undoubtedly would've been. Steve wished he could do that for him, give him another chance to fulfill his dream.
Deep in his thoughts, Tony didn’t notice that Steve left the bathroom until he was scared by him. Steve had snuck up behind him and wrapped his arms around him.
Steve just stared at Clint. He wasn't sure where this was coming from or even that Clint would make that connection. He assumed Clint thought the tears were because of his nightmare.
He looked to his right and Steve was staring at him with curiosity, no hint of bitter blame or what the hell was that Barton.
Tony’s tears fall in spite of himself. How could he help it when the man he loves pushed him away. Tony sits as still as he can on the bed while shaking with his tears and stares at Steve’s naked back. His wrists hurt and he rubs at them, making a low sound at the pain. He sniffles, wiping his tears away as new ones fell and gets up off the bed. Steve hears his movements and turns away from the window. Tony is heading for the door when Steve catches his arm. Tony shakes it off and it hurts to do so. But not as much as it hurts to look at Steve. More tears descend his cheeks to collect in his goatee.
As the storm brewed on and the night began to fade away to dawn, they carried on unaware of their surroundings. Behind them on the balcony, the wind picked up further as the rain descended with more vigor and washed away the contents of the fallen coffee cup and Steve’s forgotten plan of starting his day early.
Steve trailed off, taking hold of Clint's hands and pulling them away from his face. He held them in the space between them.
So they wanted to help him in their own way instead. The best hand was in their own. And they got way better equipments to help him anyway.
“Welcome back you two. Hope you don’t mind, I thought I’d fix them up for you. They’re good as new. Wanna try the heater? Here, dry your clothes over them.”
Tony couldn’t do anything but stare at the two of them. What kind of people would eat burnt food just because it was made by their loved ones? And why do they look so happy while eating it?
After they finished their breakfast Peter grabbed his bag and head out for school but not before giving a quick hug to his parents and saying his goodbye. Tony waved him off with a confused but happy smile at the little boy as he ran along the road.
He may realise he loves Steve but his feelings didn't need to get in the way, making it all weird between them.
For some reason he felt like Barnes was squeezing his hands a bit too hard. But Tony shrugged it off as the soldier’s nervousness. Little did he know that from that day on his life would never be so peaceful again.
He watched Tony brush his fingers over the photo, looking like he was in a trance of sort. But he looked a little more relaxed from the way his shoulders loosened up.
But it totally backfired when he saw Bucky looking at him with repugnance. “You Starks seriously disgust me. Waving your money and body at others to gain their trust."
He and the rest of the team knew how Barnes was brainwashed into doing those crimes and atrocities and they believe Steve when he told them how his friend was trying to fight back Hydra’s control over him and started gaining back his memories. Even if they didn’t trust the guy either just handing him to the government seems like a cruel thing to do. Who knows what they would do to the guy.
Tony ran out of his workshop to greet them. Feeling excited for Steve that he was able to finally bring back his long lost friend though a small part of him felt sad about it. Because from then on he’ll be the second best friend of Steve Rogers, because Bucky Barnes would always take top place in that aspect. And he was okay with that. He’s fine.
Steve stares at the back of Tony’s head, tilting his head in a confused manner. He knew Tony was acting strange but he didn’t want to push him about it so he let it be. Asking no further questions for the rest of the ride home. Wordlessly staring out the window like the brunet previously suggested.
“Ah, you see. . . A walk! The three of us were taking a walk together. It’s what we often do. And in the middle of that you got tired and so we took a small rest there. I think you lost your memory during that time.”
Tony’s eyes widened in surprise. He looked up and saw Fury, who was giving him a deadpanned expression. And standing a few foot behind him were the US officials.
But I didn’t want our meeting to end like that. It was just too heartbreaking for me. Summoning all my courage, I turned back and I asked you out for coffee. I think I was holding my breath the whole time until you finally said yes. At the coffee shop I couldn’t help but kept on talking. About the various things that were happening in my life so far and stupid things like what book I was reading. I’m not a talkative person. . . I just didn’t want you to leave. I felt like if I stopped talking, you would leave. I think I ended up spewing out my feelings for you. You looked really shocked at first but then you gave me a smile so bright, it melted my heart and worries away. When you went to see me off we exchange numbers, you promised to text me everyday. That’s how we began, you and I.”
“We first met each other at SHIELD high as freshman. My mom was a nurse, so when she got a new job at one of the hospitals in New York we move there from Brooklyn, and I finished high school there as well.”
He opened his eyes to see that it was Steve. The guy was an inch taller than him so he was being intimidatingly glared down at.
“I’ll try, though it’s practically impossible to have fun at meetings, Steve, especially SI meetings.” Tony deadpanned.
“Why won’t you tell me?! I want to understand you, Tony! I really do.” Steve suddenly yelled, breaking down in front of him. His grip loosened, falling by the side. Tears falling down on the brunet’s bed, staining the sheets wet.
“I don’t know why but I feel like I’ll remember that I’m part of a family with you and that it’s true. But I’m sorry. I still don’t remember anything.” He apologized.
It was almost a week since he and Steve had that conversation and that’s the same amount of time the two of them hadn’t talked to each other, properly that is. Well, Steve tried to, where else Tony couldn’t help but avoid him as if he’s carrying the plague. He knew it wasn’t his fault. The guy got no reason to be treated like this but the brunet can’t help it.
After he was feeling better they decided to leave the parade and head back home, hand in hand. It was already evening by that time. The sky turning different shades of red as the sun began to set.
“Yo, Pete. Thought you won’t show up. There’s a really neat shooting game over there. Let’s go.” He took the smaller boy’s hand in his and dragged him into the crowd even before the boy could give a reply.
That made him angry. Who told Peter something that was complete bullshit? There’s no way that’s true, not in the least.
“But dad, didn’t you say that it was bad for your body?” Peter asked, worry clearly shown in his big brown eyes that reminded Steve a lot of Tony’s own.
His whole body was throbbing in pain like it had been tortured for a long time. But this pain was something more. The kind that could not be seen. That kind that could not be treated easily.
“Steve, it’s been a long time. How have you been?” Sam said, clapping a hand at his back when he took a seat beside him.
Steve let out a sigh of relief holding a hand on top of his chest, feeling the anxiety slips away from his body. But he didn’t leave. He continues to stare at the sleeping figure before him.
“You . . .don’t believe me. . .” Steve replied, feeling down. Seeing how genuinely his friend sounded he cleared his throat and spoke again.
Tony was beginning to actually feel relief and happy that Steve had told him now that he was able to think back on everything that had happened with a clear mind. He thinks it’s finally time to let things go. Prolonging this was of no use at all. And frankly he missed his best friend. They had a lot of movies they had to catch up to.
Peter and his friend, Wade, were waiting for the rain to die down before going home. It was a heavy down pour, going home in that condition was of no use even with a raincoat and an umbrella.  They sat side by side near the entrance, watching the rain in silence.
Peter wanted to hug his dad but the person before him seemed so lost to see him, no familiarity to him, that he stopped himself. Frozen in his spot, a few steps away.
“You’re a cute kid, aren’t you?” He ruffled his soft spiky brown hair. A smile curving up on his lips.
Everything was going great. And even if Tony couldn't spend as much time with the blond soldier as all his attention was on his recovering friend, he was fine with it.
Steve could picture their reunion clearly. He remembered how fucking nervous he was to meet Tony after three long years.
“With mom bedridden I was the sole bread winner in the family. Through a college friend, Bucky, who was also planning to drop out of college, gave me the idea of joining the army. I didn’t see any better option at the time so I went along with him and we got in. If it was me from my high school days I’d probably be cut out from the beginning but I was lucky to grew muscles and gained height as soon as I entered college. So, physique wasn’t a problem. I served the army for around three years but in a mission I injured my right leg badly and had a serious head injury. I survived but I couldn’t perform my duties well anymore. My leg nerves would suddenly freeze up and I had problem with loud explosions and cramped places with too many people. I resigned from the force soon after.”
“Gonna tell that again to your little brother? You know you’ve caused him enough trouble already.” The guy commented with a sly smirk.
At home they told him how he was related to them. Steve showed him their family photo as a sort of evidence.
Tony wanted to know badly. Maybe hearing about it, it could help him jog up his memory. Peter and Steve were so kind to him even if he was part of the family. But right now he wasn’t the person they knew. He wanted to remember them properly. He wants to know everything.
Steve managed to squeeze in his ‘best wishes’ for Tony onto his white t-shirt which barely had any space left to write on.
“Alright, that’s enough, Clint. Stop antagonizing Tony. That’s an order.” Steve says from the counter, trying to grab a pan to make some omelette for breakfast. Tony stuck out his tongue at Clint.
“They said that they couldn’t trust us to handle him and wants us to hand him over as soon as possible. I’m sorry.” He tells them looking all dejected.
That earned him a content smile from the said boy. Peter felt really happy that at least one of them believed him.
Tony heaved out a sigh and looked down, not answering. He was still sore and tired from the brawl he had a few hours ago. He didn't feel like dealing with the guy in front of him right now.
“Yep, daddy is no good at cooking and burns the food a lot but it still tastes delicious.” Peter added cheerfully.
He occasionally had to glance on his Stark Phone to avoid the piercing glare of the guards present around the room. He let out a silent frustrated groan.
“That’s unbelievable! How dare he! If it were me I’d beat the heck out of him or at least sabotage the ceremony or something. I’d be so angry. I can’t believe you didn’t even get mad. Oh my god, Steve, you’re too nice for your own good.”
Tony was walking along the busy street of New York when he happened to brush his shoulder against a drunkard.
“What are you so pissed off about all the time?” He continued, looking him straight in the eyes. Intense blue gazing down at dark brown ones. “What is making you do this, Tony? Tell me.” He demanded.
In the blink of an eye Tony sent his fist flying at the guy’s face, leaving a red mark in Ty’s left cheek. He staggered away from the brunet, caressing his injured face.
Steve also soon came out of the garage on his bike. He stopped near Tony, getting off of his bike. He removed his helmet and hung it on his arm by the straps.
Tony squirmed on the bed. His body almost reaching its climax as he sped up the pace. He rubbed his feet together and clench his toes to the silky sheets of his bed.
They still worked together well, like that of finely tuned machines in the field as if they never had a problem in the first place. But their private life was a whole other thing. Tony didn’t speak to their captain for anything other than what was absolutely necessary both during missions and at home. He even avoided coming to team bonding activities like having lunch, playing cards or watching movies together.
“Tony, you did it! Thank you so much.” Steve says hugging him from behind, laughing and smiling happily.
“It’s not like that, Steve.” He informed him. “You’re trying hard enough even though everyone around you was against it at the beginning. You are taking good care of Peter even by yourself. I think he’s quite happy with you. And I also think you are being a very remarkable father to him.”
And Tony, he couldn’t deny that it didn’t made him happy to be called Steve Rogers aka Captain America’s best friend in the 21st century.
"Well we can locate Vision using the same algorithm I created for locating the Tesseract before New York," Bruce says, "both are Infinity Stones."
"We made a terrible mistake," I say not turning around, "Call Tony and tell him I want to leave now."
"Brother, you must let her be with the one she loves," Thor says resting his hand on my shoulder, "I know she is different than her family as you are yours but you cannot make her love you by forcing her into marriage."
Lily walks towards the pair by the driveway using her power to make Thanos take a few steps away from Loki. Once close to the man on the ground, she kneels next to Loki and pulls him into her lap again.
Lily looks down at the man in her arms, the only true piece of home she has left. She lays him carefully on the ground and runs to Ross' side, she grabs the case from him and turns back to see Thanos with his boot raised above the defenceless Loki.
"I'm a spy, James," I say in response, "I've been told all my life to keep secrets. Every since I could remember I've been told to keep the truth hidden. It's going to take me awhile to change how I'm wired inside and to fully trust the people I have in my life."
Steve sighs heavily, but walks back towards the pull falling back onto the pillow, I roll over curling up into his side.
"It was good, Steve taught me a lot," Pietro says shifting in his stance, "I was thinking, about the wedding," before he can say anything else Steve, Tony and myself rush out of the room.
I wake up on the hard floor of a cell. I sit up slowly rubbing my neck where I was injected with whatever they used to knock me out. I look around the room and see a small bed in the corner.
“Happy, she loves you,” Tony says, “she hasn’t said it to anyone since you and I’m not sure she ever will.”
"I know, it's just Bucky's going baby crazy and I needed an escape so I come down here to relax," I say looking up at the two men, "I was hoping you'd be just finishing up though, I need to steal my best friend away."
"Hey, Momma. I got a couple of questions for you," she says not looking up from her clothes, "One, do you know what the party is for tonight and how fancy it is, and two, since I'm an adult now can I drink at the party?"
"Yeah, she just went to wake up Bucky," Pietro says from the other side of the island as Laura walks.
"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! How dare you do something like this," Wanda yells.
"No, I'm your cool older sister that helps you get away with stuff," I whisper to him, this makes him laugh.
"Pops, did you see where Momma went after she got Nathaniel out of the swing," I ask turning towards my dad.
I hear the music start and that is my cue that it's time to go. I watch as Wanda and Laura walk to their seats before Pietro makes his way down the aisle. I stand at the back with Dad waiting for the music to change, once it does we start walking towards the front where Loki, Thor, Pietro, and the priest stand. We get to the front and Dad hands me off to Loki.
She opens the trunk and pulls out her medical bag and starts walking towards him. She notices him look down at the bag, she reaches her hand out and move to place it on the clearly broken arm. In seconds the gun in his left hand is holstered and the fingers are tightly wrapped around her neck, his cold metal fingers.
"In the nightmare," she says, "it was during the rape and the other guy, looked down at me with a sickening grin and said I love you. It was just a lot to take in."
I wake up to someone rubbing their thumb over the back of my hand. I flutter my eyelids quickly trying to understand my surroundings. I hear the loud beeping of a machine to the left of me, the opposite side of the person holding my hand.
We sit there watching Laura and Nathaniel play on the swings. I see Nathaniel start to cry so I get up and help him out of the swing, I put him on the ground and Laura helps him walk towards Clint. I'm about to head back to my
, causes me to cry even harder. I fall into his arms that are wrapped around my shoulders, I feel him pick me up and carry me towards his seat and rocks me on his lap. I can't hear what he's whispering to me but enjoy the small circles he's rubbing into my arms.
Dylan stands there in the living room looking relieved that she finally told everyone the truth about her past. We all sitting in silence trying to figure out what to say or do next. I'm about to say something when Laura sprints into the room.
"Thor has no children, so I ask again," she says, closing the space between them, "who is second in command?"
"I'm guessing that Jarvis told you," I start waiting for him to get comfortable, "and when you came up here you heard me tell Tony about the nightmare and now don't know how to act?"
"Yes, so will Dad and Pietro," I reply, "But it's hard enough having our daughter now fighting at our side and with this little guy on the way we're screwed."
"Speeches, we're going to start with Pietro's sister, my new sister-in-law, Wanda," Dad continues smiling up at Pietro.
"This time if you leave, you are dead," some man screamed at me, "you have to heal him and then train him."
"Come cuddle," I whisper and feel the bed shift under his weight as he crawls in next to me. I curl up into his side and fall asleep and start to forget about everything that happened earlier that day and have a dreamless sleep.
I sit down on one of the benches as Steve starts to fly us towards Bucky. It's not long after we take off that Loki is seated next to me resting his head on the wall behind him with his eyes closed lightly.
"Nothing, I didn't do anything," Bucky says looking at me as he's being pushed out of the room by Pietro and Wanda, "We were just talking."
"I know, Pietro," I say as we walk out the training room together turning to head towards the stairs, "but you also have to understand that this is his second and the only reason it didn't last is because he's gay and in love with you. He had to give up a lot for your relationship, can't you give up the dreams of a big wedding?"
"We go in, find Dylan and get out," Steve says to the team, "We are here to save her. Bucky, you lead Clint and Pietro in, you look for any sign of Dylan. I'll lead Tony, Wanda and Natasha in, we're looking for files on other bases, what weapons they have, and if they have any other enhanced."
We walk over to the front of the room. The priest starts again, this time with the right people standing in front of him.
"I just want to know if you thought this through," I say after she walks in, "He's a terrible person who's done terrible things."
We chuckle at him and sit down with Mom, Cooper, Lila, Nathaniel and Laura. We look around at everyone here for the wedding and notice just how small they kept it. I feel a tap on my shoulder, look up and see Bucky standing there.
"Well tell him that you aren't going to do that," Dad yells, "And make him heal Bucky so we can all get out of here."
"By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and husband, you make kiss the husband," the priest announces.
There was this one flower only available on Earth. It was hard to convince Odin to allow me to leave Asgard because it was just days away from Thor's coronation.
"I'm going to kill you for saying that," Bucky screams, trying to lunge at him but can't because he's still weak.
"Bucky went under again and won't come out until we can remove whatever Hydra put in him," Steve answers quietly, "We have to figure out how to remove it."
Before I'm able to say something Pietro shows up with Laura placing her on the ground next to me and racing off again.
"James, move for a sec. The baby's been kicking, want to feel," I say as Wanda walks over to my side. She places her hand cautiously on my stomach just as the baby kicks.
Loki lands next to Lily and uses magic to clear their area of the alien creatures. Shuri looks over at him, then back at Ross.
"I-I knew I wasn't attracted to Laura anymore but I never fully understood why. I just thought I did this subconsciously to protect her, Cooper, and Lila, but no. I didn't do it for them I did it because," he pauses looking up and catching my eyes, "I'm gay."
“One in the same,” she says, “but let’s not hash out things that don’t matter. Steve made his choice that day at the airport, even if I had even a small hand in not stopping him.”
I walk over to the couch and hand Clint Laura, "I'm going to talk to Tony, you stay with Grand-pa Hawk okay?" She nods curling up into her grandfathers side.
I walk off of the jet into the Avenger's new base and am nearly murdered by my brother grabbing me and dragging me to some room.
Heimdall looks up meeting her eyes, without saying anything Lily screams out in anger and rushes up the ramp. She walks into the ship and sees a few familiar faces, they just point in the direction they know she wants. She stops in front of a pair of closed doors and a woman dressed in the uniform of the Valkyrior.
We sit in silence for the rest of the flight, when we land Laura races towards the lab and sits on the stool blabbing to Vision about technical nonsense. I'm about to stand and walk when my legs give out from under me and Bucky swiftly lifts me up and carries me to my room. I see Tony race towards his room to change and get ready for his big night.
“Oh so what am I supposed to do then,” he asks, pulling her into his arms, blocking her doorway, “move in?”
The music starts booming at those words, I stand up and make my way over to Bucky, who's sitting with Steve and Tony. I sit down next to him, looking up at his beautiful brown eyes.
"Really, Aunt Nat," Laura says walking over to her, "You don't recognize me? It's me Laura, long story short I'm alive and ready to start my training."
"What," Tony asks, "there is another person walking around with an Infinity Stone keeping them alive?"
I stand in the shoot range not shooting a single practice shot. I stare at the gun on the floor that I dropped halfway through my freak out. Steve left when I didn't reply to him when he asked if I was okay.
"Of course I called you dad," I said turning to face him, "You're my dad, I wouldn't have been able to make it this far without keeping you in my heart."
"How do you manage to get out of an event put on but your work early," he asks as they step into the elevator.
We sit there for a moment in silence. Hearing him say that makes me want to tell him that I'm her, I'm his daughter. Knowing that I'd have to share where I've been and what I've been through, telling Laura about her father, keeps me from doing that.
Before Dylan is able to continue her story, I lung towards Bucky enraged. I'm about to make contact with him before I'm pulled away.
Thanos was looking for people with knowledge on these Infinity stones. He talked to someone who directed him to Ego, a celestial being who travels throughout all the realms.
I reach my arms out to take Nathaniel as she grabs a dress and hurries to change into it. I smile at the boy in my arms as the door slowly opens and Wanda walks in.
"So in the next couple of days there will be a 7 year old, a 5 year old, a 3 year old, and two new born babies in this base," Dad asks as he picks up Ras.
“You’re dead,” Happy blurts out as she pushes him into the living room followed closely by her father who closes and locks the door.
We continue out of the base in silence. We walk towards the clearing where the jet is when we hear shouting.
“Hello there,” the smooth sickening voice says out of this pale faced, green eyed, rain haired man sitting on her couch, “you really should lock your windows. The Captain is good at breaking in when things are left unlocked, isn’t that right, pet?”
We walk into Central Park after visiting the museum, it was easier to relax knowing that someone else was able to help me keep an eye on Laura. We find a nice open spot on the grass and sit, enjoying the nice day.
“You know you could relax some,” she says taking a swig from her beer, “he’s not going to call you.”
"I know sweetheart, today we're going to be on team Tony helping him get ready okay," I reply getting out of bed and pulling on some socks.
We were in the club dancing along to the music, having a couple of drinks, oblivious to what is about to happen in a couple of days.
“Steve, can you stop leaving your dishes in the sink,” she hollers through the tiny apartment, “we’re going to get fruit flies.”
"I-I wasn't in love, I didn't fall for him. The other guy, the other side of Bucky, came into that cell. He-he-he, um, he," she stops tears streaming down her face, "he raped me. I was caught off guard and didn't have time to react or fight back. I've been able to move past that and started to forgive him and we've been able to work together and get along."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"We should head to the car, we'll probably see her on the way there," Clint says gathering our things, "Besides, it's almost time for Nathaniel's nap."
"What? Oh, right. Hi, I'm Dylan," I say taking his hand shaking it, "And that bouncing girl coming into the kitchen is my daughter Laura."
"Normally, he shuts Steve out for a day or two. This has been the longest so far," he continues not seeming to realize my change, "Steve's blaming Tony because he saw Bucky and didn't get him right away."
“Gorgeous. Something happened last so I actually have to slip out,” she says, “my second job awaits.”
"She woke up from a nightmare," Jarvis replies, "She asked who was awake, and asked me not to fetch you or Mr. Stark."
As soon as her door is closed the buzzer mounted in the wall goes off, she buzzes open the door without checking to see who it is.
"Lily, care to explain who all these people are and why they're ruining the grounds here with their ships," Tony says, walking over to us, "and why Loki is just walking around all free and such."
"Clint, so help me god, if the city isn't in need of us I'm going to kill you," she threatens with a knife twisting between her fingers.
I push out of his arms and walk out of the kitchen to see the whole team staring at the entry way I just walked out of. I continue walking until I'm in my room, I close and lock the door replaying those three words over and over again in my head,
"Laura! What is the rule?" I say as I pull her to my side, "You do not, and I repeat do not, come out of hiding until I tell you it is safe."
"You're just out to destroy all your relationships, aren't you," Pietro says taking a step back from me.
"I don't want to loose you," I say to him, "I already lost my daughter, my whole life. I can't loose my whole family."
"Do you want to her this story before or after some good new," I ask as I crawl onto one side of her.
"I'm sorry, I can't even take you to where we have Bucky. It's safer this way," Steve says without looking up.
“I’m going to have to remove your mask, is that okay,” she says looking down at the first aid kit in her hands, avoiding his face.
I turn and walk towards our room thanking the AI system. I open the door tentatively and walk in, I see Bucky sitting there on the bed holding our family photo.
Lily watches the path below her and notices as a blue blur whizzes past. She looks down as it goes past the tree again three seconds later. She jumps down onto the ground, sticking her hand out wrapping it around an arm as it rushes past her. She turns around 180 degrees, still holding onto the silver-haired man's arm, stopping him in is track.
We walk out of Laura's room and head towards the kitchen where Clint and Laura are waiting for us. It's been a couple of weeks since we told the team and Laura that Bucky is her father, we've been getting closer as a family and I've been starting to forgive him for what happened. There are still times I don't react well to his touch but that's to be expect.
"The US government pretty much wanted to have control over us, send us out when they saw fit," Tony picks up, "Steve, Sam, Wanda and Clint didn't sign it. They continued fighting and became fugitives. We tried to stop them and Steve and Bucky got away, Rhodey got injured and everyone else arrested. One small thing though, there was a break in at the raft, Barton, Wilson, Lang, and Maximoff are missing. Agents have already checked at the farm and he's not there, actually an agent is staying there until they are found. We need the three of you, Dylan, Pietro, and Laura, to either sign this or retire. You can stay here, if you choose not to sign it, but aren't allowed to use your powers ever again."
I hang up the phone before Tony can say another word. I turn back to Bucky who's stand in the field behind me alone.
"You going to make another happy father daughter moment," Pietro asks in Russian, wrapping his arm around Clint.
"If you don't want me to be here I can leave," he says, resting his hand lightly on her shoulder as Shuri boots up the machine.
I nod, feeling the tears start again. I sit there crying with Pietro singing a lullaby in Russian rubbing small circles into my arm.
He rests his arm around my shoulder and I relax some. Clint walks over to us as Laura pushes Nathaniel on one of the swings.
The room stays quiet waiting for me to reply. I look over at Pietro and Wanda, they nod in response to what Steve just said.
"We couldn't be here without the love and support of our 'family' and our family," Pietro continues, "Laura, Cooper, Lila, and Nathaniel, where ever his is, I hope that you can accept me into your family as I hope me and Wanda can do with you. Dylan and other Laura, I want to thank you, seeing what you've been through and how much closer you are because of it, I know that it will be possible to make it through. Ванда, моя парных, я не мог быть кто я сегодня без Вас на моей стороне по поддержанию меня в правом и из тюрьмы. Я хочу защитить вас сейчас, как вы делали это затем. Я люблю тебя, сестра."
"Hey. We were wondering if you, both of you," Clint says noticing Bucky sitting on the bed, "and Laura would want to spend the day as a family in the park."
We walk outside towards the jet that Tony flew to pick us up. We all pile in heading towards our old home.
"Yeah, I'm so happy that she kept up her spirit, even with the pain Hydra put both of us through," I say, looking at my wrists at that memory.
I turn and look back into the room as the Iron Legion walks in and starts untying Bucky. I turn and race out of the room finding the nearest bathroom and vomiting in the toilet. While getting sick I feel a pair of hands pulling my hair out of the way.
I stand up and walk out of the bathroom, he walks behind me closely keeping an eye on me. We stand in the hallway with the rest of the team as the cell door opens and Bucky walks out. He looks around at the team and sees me walking out of the bathroom with my Dad, he pushes past everyone and engulfs me into a massive hug. I hug him back crying as all the emotions I've been burying for the past three weeks come back.
"Shit," I scream trying to get up and pull to door shut just as Bucky walks over stomping down on my calf breaking my leg. He storms into the room and I hear him tearing the room apart searching for Laura.
He walks over to the bed cautiously, I crawl to the edge of the bed a reach out for his hand. He cautiously meets my hand and allows me to pull him on the bed. We lay down together, I curl up into his side.
“A life will be ending tonight, I just don’t think it’s the one you’re expecting,” dad says towards the god.
Lily nods, then turns her head back so she's looking up at the ceiling rather than at Ross with an awestruck Peter standing close by, looking over his shoulder. Shuri turns on the machine and it scans Lily, once it's done she motions for the group to follow her. She pulls up the scan and zoom in on Lily's heart and the Infinity Stone tangled within it.
"I was there until I was thirteen, that's when Shield came in and shut the place down for good. The leader left me for dead in an alley way out back, I was sure I was going to die until this man found me and said he'd take care of me with his sick wife.
"See! You go back to who you were before you were rewired. I've always had secrets, I've never changed who I am," I yell, "I can't go back to something I've never been."
She turns and walks towards the room listed on the file pulling out her phone sending a text off to her father asking about Uncle Nick. She walks into the room and starts with the standard day that awaits her.
"It wasn't my information to tell," Pietro says getting defensive now, "And what would I have said 'Oh Clint, by the way Dylan's your daughter and Bucky raped her but hey let's continue making out.'
"Jarvis, take the wheel," Tony said as he started to walk over to where I was seated, "There is one thing we'd like to know before we land though. Your daughter, Laura, said you have other powers, what are they?"
“See, she just waved goodbye,” Happy says, “if she thought that I was actually alive and standing here she would have run over here. She’s moved on and I can’t wreck that.”
“Thank you,” she says dropping her head onto his chest, “but something is bothering Steve, he said there’s more going on than just Bucky waking up.”
"Don't go back to him. Don't go back to someone who will hurt you that much," he replies, "Be with someone that won't hurt you."
"Why do you care so much," I say from my spot on the ground, "Why does it bother you that I want to marry him, that I love him?"
We walk into the common area just like before and sit down. I look around the room and have a rush of memories flood back.
Laura sits there nodding taking it all in. I look over her head at Bucky and allow him to see that I'm just as nervous as him.
Before he can answer I feel a pair of arms wrap around my waist lifting me out of Pietro's way, I see the blue trail left in his wake.
"I'm also your dad," Clint says talking a step towards me, as I take a step back, "I want to have a good relationship with you too."
"Yes, Heimdall, the Watcher of the Worlds can actually find people their soulmates," Loki replies as we walk onto our living floor.
“I did, yesterday. I’m supposed to be on my way to the airport,” she says as Tony lands beside them blasting the gang of robots surrounding them.
“I can’t. If you need help from someone so badly call your boyfriend,” she says as she opens her door and walks out, slamming it behind her.
"Natasha and Clint should be here shortly," Steve said as he took the place beside me, "Then in three more hours the rest of  the team will be here."
Laura slowly walks over to where Bucky is sitting, he shifts in his seat so he is sitting taller. She looks into his eyes and reaches her hand up to her face and rests it on his cheek. Bucky's face lightens up at the touch. Laura then leans in and pulls Bucky into a hug as she starts to cry, Bucky pulls her up into his lap rocking her lightly soothing her.
Dylan sits Laura down and tells her that they're going to go meet her mom, she's trying to hide her nerves as best as possible.
Lily lifts the case that is sitting next to her and smashes it into the rock next to them. She stands, ignoring the screams from Happy and Ross, and faces Thanos.
"Okay, so everyone here knows my name," Loki says taking a small step towards us, "Shouldn't I be so lucky as to know all of yours?"
"Look, I understand that that kiss was due to everything you went through," he says leaning against the island, "but I wouldn't mind if it happened again. I mean in the past few weeks since you told me about Laura and how much more time we've spent together I've started to feel things towards you."
I start signing to him, asking about the team and how long everyone's been part of the team. He signs back answering without skipping a beat. We continue signing back and forth for a couple of minutes, until I see Pietro walk in. He notices that Clint is sitting with his back to the door and runs up behind him and grabs his shoulders. Seconds later Pietro is pinned to the table with a butter knife pressed to his throat.
Steve takes a breath and nods. “All the time. Buck and I were always a given but somehow we drifted and that’s when you and Buck and Tony and I happened.” Clint attacks his bottom lip with his teeth. “And Tony and Bucky and myself and Tony just kinda fit in the slots. But it’s all very strange.” Clint pauses and Steve doesn’t push, just listens to the sound of Tony and Bucky kissing masked by the rushing of the rain. ”Bucky says it doesn’t matter and I want to believe that, Cap.” The soldier rests his hand on Bucky’s rifle. “He tells me the same thing. You’ll believe it in time.”
We sit there watching whatever movie Tony started for us before he raced off to his lab to build something. I look up from the screen and look over at Pietro, I haven't been able to say anything to him since Dylan left.
I turn to where he was just standing about to say something when I realize that he's already gone. I walk back into the common area and see Clint and Pietro sitting there.
"If we're going to be, whatever this is, we have to be honest with each other," Bucky says putting down the picture, "You can't keep hiding things from me, we're a team in raising our children and I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick not being able to hear their thoughts."
"Hi, we just wanted to thank everyone for coming, and apologize to our family that we didn't invite to the ceremony," Dad starts, "It was an intimate moment that was shared between best friends that have become family, that's right I'm talking to you Nat and Dylan, and family that has become best friends, that's you Wanda. Nat, we've been through everything together, including trying to kill each other, I want you to know that you are the only person in this world I view as my sister and that I wouldn't have learned to be as strong as I am without you by my side living the terrors I lived and I want to thank you for that."
I drop to the ground shaking. I burn the clothes I'm wearing and stand up in just my underwear. I walk over to the bed staring into the camera and burn the complete mattress.
"Morning," I say rolling over so I can look him in the eyes, "Thanks for staying with me last night, it really helped."
Before I can reply, Loki is thrown to the ground causing him to release his grip on my Dads throat. I rush towards him checking to see that he is breathing fine. I look up and see Natasha pinning Loki to the ground.
She pulls out the phone and hits the answer button holding it between her ear and shoulder as she starts cleaning up.
"Hey, kiddo," Dad says turning to me, "Want to come help me fly this thing? Nat is tired so I best let her sleep."
With that she turns and makes her way through the rest of the gala avoiding him for the rest of the evening.
Pulling out her tablet she opens the code of Bruce's algorithm, altering it to focus on the smaller amount of energy. She relaunches the algorithm and starts tracking the fast-moving energy.
"Because Dad doesn't trust you. He wanted you to fail today's test and not be released," I say looking up at him, "I can't blame him either, you killed his first granddaughter that he barely got to know."
"Sparky! Thank you for everything you did to help with this wedding," Tony says engulfing me in a hug.
I pace in front of the door of our shared room not knowing what will be on the other side when I walk. I stop looking down at the knob and turn it pushing the door open walking in. Bucky's there curled up on the bed, not seeming to notice someone entering the room. I walk over to his side of the bed sitting in front of him seeing that he's sleeping, I brush back the hair that's fallen in his eyes.
I look into his beautiful brown eyes, feeling his arms around me, I feel at home. I'm calm and not on edge or high alert. I quickly close the distant between our lips kissing him lightly before pulling away.
He chuckles holding onto his ribs, "No, I fell from the tree outside. We were having a Nerf war, I lost," he says, "Pietro rushed me here, he's worried about me too much."
I nod, rocking a sleeping Nathaniel in the car seat in front of me. "Maybe the Wint-Bucky, doesn't want to talk about it because it was truly terrible," I interject.
"When. When we get married, I'll be the happiest person alive," I say, leaning in kissing the top of his forehead before dragging Steve out onto the dance floor.
"Then you can be with Pietro, cause all he talks about is how much he loves you," Laura says not looking up from her drawing.
"This wedding is not allowed. Please back away. We are here to help," the Iron Legion starts saying to everyone.
"Can't, pregnant, or did you just think this belly is your hubby's cooking," I say rubbing the small bump starting to develop.
We all nod in response and sit down around the edges of the clearing waiting for the jet. I walk over towards Loki and sit down next to him.
"So you knew everything this whole time," I say realizing just how close he was to Dylan, "and you didn't tell me?"
“Then I’ll pick you up at the airport and you can tell me all about your adventure and peacefulness away from my chaos,” he says as his team walks towards him, “have you told your uncle about the mystery man yet?”
"Twins," Bucky and I ask at the same time, he kisses the top of my head as I feel tears streaming down my face.
Seconds later I few the arm that was around my waist fly off. I whip around and see Bucky throwing Loki into the wall across the way from us. Loki get up and charges at Bucky, I leap between them causing Loki to stop his attack.
Lily stands in the doorway listening to Everett and Happy fighting, silencing Bruce and Thor as they quietly walk out of the kitchen.
"Sorry, I just wanted to talk to someone about our kid," He says turning to walk away, "but I get it you need your space."
"Dad and Pietro 'eloped' in Hawaii, these are the dresses that me Wanda and Nat had to wear," I start explain, "I'm still wearing it because Tony and Steve are setting up for their party and want the 'wedding party' in the same thing they wore for the ceremony. The only ones that know about this right now are us, Tony, Steve, Wanda, Nat, Dad and Pietro."
"Sure, just be careful," I say grabbing the diaper bag from Clint so he can bring Nathaniel to the slide.
I quickly jump behind the screen and change into the dress, it a simple pale blue dress to match the colour of the flowers that are decorating the aisle. I step out from behind the screen and walk over to Steve.
"One small thing," I say not looking up from my feet, "How are we supposed to get where we're going with a totaled quinjet?"
"You don't want to help the man you idolize," I ask messing up her hair, "It's fine,you go help Pops, and I'll help my dad. Sound fair?"
"WE HAVE TO ACT NOW," I scream getting their attention, "We can stand here and make plans but they could be torturing her, or worse brainwashing her to kill us."
"I'm fine," I say opening my eyes and meeting his, "I'm sorry for everything I said to you, none of it was true."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"It was hard but I managed. You have it easier though," I say turning to him, "you're surrounded by a group of people who will help you when you need it most. I was on the run for most of her life, I didn't know who I could trust or if we'd have a safe place to sleep."
"Dad, we have some news we want to tell you," I say to him, as we sit around the table in the kitchen, "I need you to keep an open mind, okay?"
Cooper turns and walks out of the house, heading towards the quinjet we brought here. I hop off the counter and follow behind him with Pietro right by my side.
"Your boy toy seems to be a late sleeper. I'm guessing you guys had fun last night," Tony says winking at me.
I sit in my lab staring at a screen looking for any radio transmission to appear in an abnormal area.
"You fool," Loki screams, "I won't let you do this, you said you were going to marry me and that is what you will do. If not, I'll kill him."
"What gave it away," he replies in a snarky tone, "when I got mad at you for leaving or when I stood here giving you the death glare?"
"Laura's down training with Nat and Wanda," Steve says, "I hope you don't mind, I assigned them to train her. I want her to learn how to fight like Nat does and Wanda controls her powers so well I just thought it would be better for her to learn that from someone that isn't her mom."
He nods as we get up and walk out of the room. We enter Laura's room locking the door once in there.
"That she won't go back to you," he pauses licking his lips, "and that she'll marry me to prove her promise."
"Yes, I've done my research. No thanks to your father," she says, "but I now know the truth about me."
"Yes, I am. Something happened out there though," I say to him right in front of Laura's door, "He was almost like the old him, it was like the Winter Soldier was back and Bucky was gone."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Of course, I was actually planning on pulling him aside and asking the same thing," I reply as Natasha walks up.
I stand in the elevator heading up to the floor that everyone lives on. It's movie night, so it's a calm night to return. When the elevator arrives on the floor everyone in standing in the living room talking about an orb in Tony's hand.
"So I was thinking," Bucky says after letting go of me, "You, me, Laura, Clint, and Pietro all go and have a picnic today. I've already set it up outside so you have to say yes."
"FRIDAY, bring up the current screen of my tablet onto the large screen in my office," she says, not taking her eyes off the screen until such is done.
"I told you I'd be back," Pietro says in his think accent, as he releases me from the death grip of a hug, "I brought some friends to help. This is my sister Wanda, Mr. Tony Stark, and Captain Steve Rogers."
“You could always move,” he says, laughing at the yeah right look she give him, “there must be another crumbling apartment in Queens that you can move to.”
"We were kissing and I just had a flood of emotion," I continue in Russian, "I had a panic attack. It wasn't because of anything he did, I caused myself to freak out."
"Easily, she loves you and it was the only way we could get you better," Wanda replies quickly, "She's doing this to have you in your son's life. Bucky, if there was another way don't you think she would have done that?"
"Are you really going to do that, Dylan? Just because they won't tell you what's going on with your dad, or where I am," Bucky says from the doorway.
"Dy-Dylan? How can you do this," Bucky whispers in a distressed tone, "How can you throw away what we have?"
For the first time she told the truth about why she is cautious about living with her partner. The man watching them let’s a sad smile appear on his face.
I stand in front of my door not moving to open it, I feel the tears rushing down my face. I turn and continue down the hallway to my fathers room, I knock lightly and the door opens almost immediately after I drop my hand. Pietro moves so I can walk into the room.
"We have plans to create the Asgardian race," he says, "they will be similar to us. Only able to have one child at a time. I prophesy that the first-born twin of a celestial being and an Asgardian will be born with the power of an Infinity Stone, they will carry its power until their dying breath only to release the stone once they have rejoined us."
"Where have you been Bruce," Tony pries sitting next to me on the couch, "I want to know everything."
"Cooper, I think you owe your father an apology," She says kneeling in front of Cooper with a sleeping Nathaniel in her arms.
Lily walks away before Tony or anyone else can protest any more. She opens the door to Tony's car and gets into the driver seat, pulling away from the base.
I nod walking out of the room heading towards the shooting range. After the light changes I walk into the room ready for a screaming match.
"Steve, you can't see me before our wedding it's bad lucky," Tony yells from behind one of his cars.
I look as my daughter is bouncing around the room gathering her notepad and shoes. While enjoying this sight, there's a knock at the door.
“Don’t be. I’m sorry this happened to you and I don’t want to meet the person that did this,” she says, not looking up at him, “what’s your name?”
"Well, I was disgused as Odin when you came back to Asgard," he whispers, waiting for Lily to realize what he means by this. He sees the realization appear in her eyes.
"I did, Wanda and Loki, shh, Loki is on our side at the moment, are going to get it out," Steve says soothingly, "I have someone here that you'll want to see before we start though."
"Shit, everyone buckle up, this is going to be a rough landing. One of our engines just blew," Steve yells over the alarm.
I feel Bucky tense when I talk about my family, knowing that he's worried they might try and hurt him like Clint did.
"No way," she says as eager as Peter, pulling Lily over to one of her many technical devices, "lay down, this will do a full body scan so I see exactly how the Infinity Stone is working with your organs."
“My dad’s alive,” she says, “he died before the battle of New York. Tony and Steve saw the bloodstain on the wall. They believed it, I gave shield the okay to bring him back.”
"Don't go back to him. Don't go back to someone who will hurt you that much," he replies, "Be with someone that won't hurt you."
"What is going on? They wouldn't tell me anything," Bucky says reaching and holding my hand taking a seat next to me.
She’s walking down the sidewalk towards her apartment rummaging through the bag of Chinese food in her arms when she trips over something hard and fall onto the ground. She feels a pair of hands wrap around her waist lifting her to her feet. Looking back to where she just was she see all of her food splayed out on the sidewalk.
"It was, but that was the past," I say not missing a shot, "I'm not saying I forgive you for what you did, I don't know if I'll ever be able too. But when you were will to risk your life," I say this with the bow now by my side, "When you were going to leave to make me feel safe, I realized just how much you've changed."
They sit and talk for some time until the pizza is delivered and then they continue to talk as they eat. Once the last piece is finished she starts to clean up a bit.
"You want me to choose," I say looking into his eyes, "between being with the team or being with someone I love?"
I hear the door to lab open and ignore whoever just walked in. I start the footage over again, going frame by frame when Bucky losses control.
"Don't say that it won't happen again," Bucky interrupts me, "Don't apologize for it either, if I didn't want the kiss I would have stopped you."
He takes a step towards me, I tighten the grip I have on my gun, "James, stop. Please don't come any closer." He reaches up forcing me to lower the gun, his hand reaches up and wraps around the back of my neck leaning in. I feel the gun fall out of our hands, I look up into his eyes just as something snaps inside of them. He throws me into the wall behind him.
I hear a faint knock at the door, I slowly crawl off the bed and walk towards the door. I open it slowly squinting at the light from the hallway, I allow my eyes to adjust and see Tony standing there. I move enough for them to walk into my dark room, his arc reactor lighting up a small area.
We move around and take a few more shots, some with just Steve, Tony and Wanda; others with Steve, Tony and myself and then some with just Wanda, me and one of the grooms. We walk back towards the reception talking and joking around. I walk in with Wanda as Steve and Tony wait to make a big entrance, Tony's idea.

“It’s fine, it’s going to be a long trip anyway,” dad says, “I think Clint and Pietro are staying back too so you’ll have someone here if need be.”
"It's really nice to see you and Cooper getting along," Mom says as Nathaniel crawls over to her, "especially after your first time meeting each other."
"But the fact that he is now on this base," I say as I plop onto the bed, "The fact that he's probably right now sitting there with the team where I normally sit. He's phasing me out of my family, I bet you Ras calls him Dad before me."
Lila looks over at where it came from and sees two giant green beasts fighting. Turning back to the guard, she grabs his hand and they run in the opposite direction of the two beasts.
“So how long is this trial supposed to go on for,” Pietro asks as they hang out at the base upstate.
She pulls away from me and I turn to look at the small girl looking up at me. I see Laura walk up to me hugging my leg tightly.
I sit there talking to Cooper and Lila getting to know them as much as I can. It's not until Laura starts fidgeting that I suggest that they go play on the playground.
"I'm a monster, I've done terrible things," Bucky says, "This last flashback proved it. I've done things that you, all of you have forgiven me for but this is one I ask that you don't, this is one I know that some of you will never, maybe can't, forgive me for. Ever."
"No, I heard you scream down in the lab," Tony says sitting on the corner of my bed, "I thought I'd give you some time before I come up here."
I pause, remember that phone call that happened a month ago. I walk towards him hands up in surrender knowing that if I put up a fight that Laura would be hurt.
I'm about to protest to Bucky about not needing to sleep. He just hushes me saying that he's going to take care of me until I feel better.
"No, I mean it's hard enough having children in our line of work but a marriage," I say, "it's impossible."
"We're not here to discuss this," Lily says, "Rett says you're the smartest person he knows and that you'd be the best person to ask for this kind of help."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As Laura walks out of the room the doctor enters. He checks my cervix and tells me that it's time to push. I start listening to the doctor and allow them to tell me what to do. The machine hooked up to me monitoring the baby starts going crazy.
"I'm going to, it's just going to take a while," I say smiling down as he slowly starts to move into a seated position.
"He knows," I say wrapping my arm around his shoulder, "He just doesn't know that he knows. That's part of our new connection, we can place information in people's head for them to find later. Don't give me that look, he'll 'remember' it tomorrow."
"I'm sorry," I say quietly, "You're not dead to me. I don't want to loose you like we lost Laura today but it's going to take a lot for me to get through this. I know you have to be in here for a few more weeks, but after that I want you at the first appointment for our-our baby."
"We have a problem, we need your help Tony," Steve says as he pushes away the smaller man, "I just need to make a few things clear, one I'm still not going to sign it. Two, I won't come home until you get the government to overrule it. And three, no one gets arrested while you help us."
"Mom, I think you should sit down for this and let me take Ras," Laura says motioning me towards the couch.
"Oh, yeah. I'm okay, just" he stops as his voice catches, he looks up at me and turns walking out of the kitchen.
“One hour left,” Sarah says bumping her hip as she joins Avery at the counter of the nurses’ station.
I wake up before Bucky and smile knowing that I didn't wake up again because I had someone with me. I reach my head up and place a light kiss on his cheek causing him to wake up a little.
"Everett Ross," he says, shaking her hand, "sorry about earlier this evening. If it makes you feel any better the woman I was trying to impress wasn't buying it even before you jumped in."
"We're going to hear our baby's heartbeat," he asks looking at me, "I get to hear our son's heartbeat?"
"So you don't know where my Dad, his sister, your husband or my, her father is," I ask from my seat.
“I should go with him,” she says, “he’s freaked out because of the intel he has about Loki being back and planning to come for me.”
I turn and walk towards Laura and see that Bucky already has the sleeping girl in his arms. We turn and walk on to the quinjet, I turn and face Clint and Pietro as the hatch closes and Tony takes off heading back towards the base.
Hephaestus looks up with a curse when he hears the evacuation alert and the building plunges into darkness. Reaching out further with his abilities he realizes a countdown has begun. Hephaestus curses even louder.
Finger by finger, he releases the tension in his grip. If a lifetime as Tony Stark has taught him anything, it’s how to fake a casual demeanor.
“We could create a lot more power out of the same size engine.” Hades cuts him off with an excited grin.
He turns to find blond hair, messy from the wind, and eyes that glow even brighter under the reflected light of the sky.
Dum-E makes a quite frankly pitiful sound, before racing over to him. The bot skids to a stop and with a gentleness that makes the crinkles by Tony’s eyes deepen even more, gently pokes him in the arm.
The man whips around and upon seeing the way in, grins. Steve gestures for Hephaestus to go first. Hephaestus dramatically puts his hand to his chest, flattered, and when Steve rolls his eyes, still grinning, finally swings down through the roof to the floor below.
The problem is he can’t access their files through the internet like he could for other organizations.
With his thumb acting as a lighter, Tony takes a deep inhale of the filtered smoke. It’s heady, the taste familiar and still from so, so long ago. His eyes sting.
“Barnes?” Steve nods. Phillips picks up a thick sheaf of letters, leafing through the first few. “I’ve signed more condolence letters today than I’d care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.”
Pepper is one of the handful of people he’s ever fully trusted with his life, immortality aside, and Rhodey knows that.
“We’d all be so lucky.” They all turn at the familiar voice to see Bucky, sauntering up to the group with an amused curl to his lips.
(Even now, after his revelation of being more than Olympus’s favorite tool, there’s still a large part of him that yearns to go back to his family. He misses Ares and Athena. He misses the stories of the hunt Artemis would tell with a sharp grin and confident poise. Dionysus would always make sure he had the best wine on the rare occasions they had dinner together.
Steve slides the shield onto his arm and smiles. It’s unfair how ridiculous he should look posing like that when instead he just looks like a hero.
“Hey, you didn’t know he was going to do what he did.” Pepper gives a small reassuring smile. “It’s okay.”
Sure he’s confused and upset that someone as kind as Steve Rogers has an audience laughing at him, it's just mostly the realization leaves Hephaestus breathless with overwhelmingly relief. Because sure, he knows that never getting to see Steve again would be better in the long run, but the gods help him, Hephaestus couldn’t help but hope he’d run into him anyway.
Victorious insurgents clutch Stark Industries made RPGs. Behind them a town burns, bodies strewn. In another civilians are being marched in rows, pre-execution, his weapons trained at their backs.
It’s hard to remind himself that the Olympians told stories of interfering on Earth countless times. He thinks what makes this different is the certainty Zeus isn’t the one in New Mexico.
She helped him with his father’s anger. He doesn’t know why she chooses to come back and then stay, but she does.
The room begins to morph. The hazy edges grow and grow until Tony blinks and finds himself falling into the memories once again. Is he just destined to fall forever?
Tony can only watch in horror as Bucky throws himself in front of him and directly into the line of fire. Steve whips the shield off his back to protect his best friend, but it doesn’t work.
“I’ve already replaced the exhaust system, added an adjustable suspension system, all the bells and whistles. The bike still isn’t fast enough.” Hades runs a frustrated hand through his hair, smearing grease and causing sections to stand up in messy tufts.
The gas pedal nearly to the floor the entire trip, it still takes far too much time to get to the building.
Attempting to act casual, Tony throws out a joke. “Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow.” He chuckles. The suit’s speakers don’t catch it, but Tony winces at how forced it sounds. “What's your thing? Pilates?”
Maybe now he’ll at least get a chance to look around on his own. Hades may have given up on finding a way back, but Hephaestus needs to get back home.
Hades moves to lean against the table across from him, crossing his arms. “Erskine and Phillips are looking for two different men. When the time comes, you need to help them decide on one.”
When Steve moves to exit Hephaestus catches his eye and they share a private smile. Some may describe it as nothing but trouble, but Hephaestus thinks it’s as stunning as Steve.
The chaos occurring at the front entrance thankfully left the parking lot empty, so he doesn’t hesitate to disable the cameras before using his abilities to order the trunk open and the suit to unlock.
He smiles slightly at the sarcasm before directing half of his attention toward the cameras in his home, the other still focused on driving.
“Why are you doing this?” Tony yells, devastated. His eyes flicker back and forth between Stane and the weapon aimed at his friends.
They have to take down a couple more guards, but eventually the two men find dozens of prison cells. What can only be the captured infantry are being held a floor below them, but peeking out around the corner of the far wall, Hephaestus can see the wardens are patrolling on this level because of the large barred holes that give a clear view of the prisoners.
He’s in Afghanistan having just finished demonstrating his latest monstrosity, the Jericho. The soldiers in the Hummer with him are painfully young.
His strength won’t return fully immediately, but he doesn’t waste any more time now that his energy is coming back. Tony throws himself into his work with a renewed vigor, the doctor by his side.
“This isn’t a consultation.” Romanoff’s stare truly is distinctly unsettling. She could be a fair match in a staring contest with Athena.
“I’m god of many things – travelers, particularly to the Underworld, being the one most relevant to your question.”
But Tony has had this itch under his skin for a while. A need to lash out against the universe that decided to fuck him over so thoroughly.
Upon impact, Tony and Thor hurtle through several trees before finally skidding to a stop about a half mile away.
The crowd laughed uproariously, as if the crude gesture was the greatest thing since Dionysus presented wine.
His mouth feels like cotton and Tony can only bring himself to assess the room with half-lidded eyes.
Steve looks like he wants to ask before he thinks better of it. Hephaestus doesn’t think he’s ever been so grateful for the military and their well known secrecy. Steve likely believes the device is for something confidential regarding the war. That’s not wrong, but the reason he can’t know has nothing to do with rank.
“What do you mean?” Hephaestus’s easy posture drops suddenly. He turns to face Hades directly. He should have known it wouldn’t last. It never does.
They look at each other for a long moment. Each searching for something, but unsure of what they’ll find.
“Which is why I didn’t want either of you involved,” Tony interrupts. “I knew you’d think I’m going off the deep end.”
He must have decided to continue acting weirdly out of character because Hades makes his footsteps heavy enough to anticipate his approach. “For what it is, that thing sure looks unassuming.”
Sweet, amazing Happy does try to escort him up to the penthouse, but Tony sends him home early with a grateful, but firm instruction to take the night off.
“You’re not going to get anywhere with him if you don’t force it. The only way to do that however, is to have something that he wants. Your abilities are clearly not enough, considering we’re in this situation in the first place.”
. He’s been through so much in his life and still radiates optimism and hope. Anyone else would have let so much loss break them.
After a few minutes of staring at the schematics he drew without actually reading them, Hephaestus looks up at his father. “Would you mind if I used the lab? I’d like to join Steve’s team, but he’ll need more than a god to protect him.”
He feels a constant ache in his body, in his head, that hasn’t stopped for months. He keeps hoping it will to go away eventually, but it’s been a week since his time in space, and the pounding hasn’t cease. With all that’s happened, he shouldn’t be surprised that the longer he’s been left with his thoughts and the numbers screaming and the ghosts shouting
"Well, it will be myself, Loki and Wanda, Dylan, and Clint," Steve replies, "Unless you want to be in there, your highness."
"Momma, can we go play on the playground," Laura says jumping out of the car seconds after I turn off the engine.
"Did you sign it," Steve asks, we all shake our heads, "Are you planning on signing it," we shake our heads again, "Are you ready to become fugitives until this law gets abolished?"
"Buck, I know that you care for her," Steve says walking towards me, "We all do, but we have to make a plan so we all make it out of there together."
"Did you tell him I'm back? Or do I get to tell him? Ouu can I tell him please!!!! Or should I hide and scare him," Pietro said after appearing out of no where.
"I don't want to be around this right now," I say turning my back to them, "I need some space to figure out everything."
I sit there still looking out the window, leaving out the part where she told me I wasn't her dad. I see Laura stand and walk over to Cooper.
“I just don’t think I could ever love someone as much as I love Happy,” she says, “we just decided that we were going to move in the night before he died. I’ll never be able to get to that stage in a relationship again because I’ll freak out.”
"Yes, I actually think he has more than myself," I reply, "Laura and Ras are both of our children, both conceived under different circumstances but both have brought us closer together."
I stand there staring, trying to figure out how to help him. I calm myself and place my hand on his left shoulder, the only one that isn't covered in blood. I push into his arm and pulse the healing energy through him hoping that he will be able to wake up. I start to feel him shifting under the pressure of my hand.
"She doesn't only have healing power, she has other powers too. That's right my Momma is a superhero too," Laura says as we walk out of the door, dragging Pietro with her.
"That's not important now. What's important is that no one else tries to kill Loki until after Bucky is better," Steve says sternly towards everyone, "Is that understood?"
“If this gets back to Tony I’m screwed over too,” she says, resting her hand on his knee, looking up at the eyes on his mask.
"Let's go upstairs," Steve says clasping his hand on Bucky's shoulder as everyone makes their way towards the elevator.
I walk over nearly ripping the door of the hinges as I pull it open. Wanda walks in and leans up against the dresser.
"I tend to hold it over his head that I saved him from dying, and that I know better for his life," I say jokingly, "I mean, he wanted to run around minutes after our first session. After I let him after an hour of fighting him, he learned to listen to me very quickly."
A couple of hours later, the Tony and Steve head off to their honeymoon leaving us with the clean up. I stand there watching Wanda bring down the last string of lights from the tree.
"Metal arm, deal with Sparky okay," Tony says from the pilot seat, "I don't want her crying when we get back to base, I need Steve for tonight."
"Okay, so Tony's coming to get you, me and Pops then," she says curling up into my side, I look up at Bucky and pat the spot next to me on the grass.
Before I can finish what I'm about to say I pull him towards me kissing him. He walks us back towards the bed leaving me down first and carefully laying on top of me. I run my hands down the front of his shirt undoing buttons along the way, he rolls over so I'm sitting on top of him as he slowly unzips my dress. We lay there wrapped in each others arms breathing in each other.
"I'm just saying we should bring Pietro or Nat along," he says sitting on Laura's bed, "I mean it doesn't hurt to be over prepared."
"We figured you'd want time to relax and get comfortable before meeting everyone," Pietro said without lifting his head from Laura's notepad.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Oh, I'm pissed, but I mean I pulled a gun on Pietro so I thought I'd try and hide it out here," I say standing next to Wanda, "So what's up?"
"What's up with you and Dylan," I whisper as Bucky walks towards the stairs leading down to what I can assume is the gym or shooting range.
"Good news, Sergeant Barnes is completely clear of all traces of Hydra," the doctor says, "He's getting changed and will be right out."
Thanos peels his eyes away from Lily just in time to see Loki feet from him. He flicks his hand and Loki goes flying to the side, crashing into a giant rock that lines the driveway. Lily rushes to his side, pulling his limp body fully onto her lap. She brushes a strand of hair out of his eyes as they flutter open, meeting hers. Blinking away tears she sees Thanos approaching her and Ross running out of the base. Ross looks at the situation unfolding in front of him.
"But you said that you and Bucky fell for each other and got pregnant," Steve says from his seat on the floor.
Lily walks into the kitchen after locking herself away in her office for the afternoon. She steps in just as a knife is launched across the room in the direction of Ross and gets lodged into the wall behind him. Looking over in the direction it came from she sees that Happy is the one who threw it.
I wrap my legs around his arm ramming my foot into his fleshy part on the shoulder. He quickly releases me and charges at me, I counter his attack, causes him to topple over I jump on top of him pinning down his left arm.
Lily sits in the kitchen looking at the documents in front of her on the table, she pays no attention to the conversation happening between Happy and Rhodey. On her tablet she types out a few notes from what she has read, it's not until she's being pelted by cereal that she looks over at the two of them.
"Can I talk to Dad alone," I say to Pietro and Bucky in Russian, they both give me worried looks as they walk out of the area.
“I’m telling you dad, the mystery man was in Bucharest,” she says into her phone as she waits to board her plane.
"Tony tried to take us in," Steve replies with a broken tone, "The three of us fought and Bucky lost his arm. I'm sorry Dylan."
"I was going to get Pietro to stay with her," He says noticing the concerned look on my face, "You could see if she wants to talk to you. Just have Jarvis let me know if I still need to get Pietro."
I walk into my room looking at how bare it still is. I sit on the bed hiding away from the team, I hear knocking at the door. I sit there not moving to open the door, I wait and hope for them to go away but the knocking continues.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, OH GOD AHHHHHHHHHHHHH," I scream jolting up in bed, "No Laura please."
Without thinking, without really knowing what I want to do or say, I stand up and walk over to the couch. I kneel in front of Pietro lifting his chin in my hand and kiss him. At first, he doesn't react so I start to pull away thinking I did something wrong. He stops me from pulling away wrapping his fingers in my hair and kisses back. He pulls me onto the couch with him, I push him back so we're now laying on the couch together still kissing. After a while, I lift my head and lips away from him.
Before any of us have time to react, Bucky knocks Malick out of the chair and is on top of him wailing on Malick. Steve pulls Bucky off of Malick and keeps him on the other side of the room, Tony throws him back into a chair.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Okay," Bucky says helping me up from my spot on the floor, "Okay, let me put on some pants and we'll move your stuff into here."
She hangs up the phone and sits down on the couch in her apartment letting her sadness, happiness, and relief wash over her all at once. Smiling she stands and starts to clear up some space for Matt to move in.
Steve pushes himself off our bed and heads towards the door, "Steve, it's no use," I say stopping him, "He told Jarvis he doesn't want to be bothered."
"Laura, hurry up. If we want to go to this event you have to be ready in 5 minutes," I say to a closed bathroom door, as I pull our only bag onto my back.
"Of course, but Vision will be there," she says as he floats behind as we walk down the hall, "we have a connection that helps me understand technology and him real life."
"James, calm down some," I say resting my hand on his arm, "and Bruce, no I know that is not the cause. The cause is because of Laura being shot."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I look up making eye contact with Tony, "There's one more ability," I stop him in his tracks and he looks at me.
“No clue, Pietro,” Steve says, “but we have to figure out a way to get the civilians out of here first.”
"You don't know," Lily says, looking between Bruce and Thor, "I was gone for two hours and none of you thought to tell them about the whole Accords thing? Even Pietro knows and he's been living in a cave."
"Can I ask a question," I ask Steve turning to him, he nods, "Did you know that you were shooting Laura?"
"Sorry. Bucky, you have to understand that this is hard," I motion to the area around me, "You have no idea how much I wanted to stay in bed that morning but Tony barged in and brought me back to reality."
I pace around Tony's lab as they all talk about taking their time, surveillance is key. I slam my fists onto the counter.
"Oh my! You're really him! You're Tony Stark, my mom and me were going to see you give your talk on arc reactors and how dangerous the really can be at Stark Expo, and now you're here in our motel room. I'm just in awe," Laura rambles on.
"I'm going to get changed in the bathroom like I always do before bed," I reply with a confused look on my face.
"That sounds fun but I thought," I start as I see Tony leaning in to listen, say the next part in Russian, "We could have some alone time to talk about the baby," while saying that I get unnecessarily hands-y with Bucky, playing up what Tony is assuming I said.
After sleeping for two hours, I get up and walk towards the lab that I knew Laura would be in. I walked up to the door and watched as Tony and her were building little gadgets.
