The brightness and sounds slammed John with the force of a hurricane. The blonde man held back a shudder and forced himself to remain firmly planted on his feet. He could feel the desire to return to the flat growing in the pit of his stomach, but it was being slowly overridden by his desire to see London...to breathe it all in again. Sherlock was watching him, judging his reaction. His pale fingers tightened on the door knob...as if he was an instant from closing the door again and putting John back in bed.
“Let go! Let go, dammit!” The blonde SCP raged desperately as moisture dampened his eyes, “L-let go...” His voice dying into a despairing whisper of resignation.
I know it's not very long, but I have a bit of free time here to throw up a few rapid fire sort of updates! So keep your eyes peeled for those in the next few days! Sorry about the long delay...I was finishing off the last few weeks of classes and projects and life...anyhow, enjoy!

“Joh—”
John was stunned and terrified. For several long minutes, he just stared at the closed bathroom door, like he couldn't believe Sherlock was about to let him tag along! He swallowed hard, trying to ignore the fearful lump forming in the pit of his stomach. It would be overwhelming, but John couldn't stand knowing the world he'd desperately been dreaming of seeing again was just outside a few flimsy walls. Unlike years past, where the walls were thick, underground, and the door were well guarded.
SCP-9340 felt the soft, warm, touch of something against his cheek as the door swooshed open, another horrible tremble raced down his spine as the tip of a claw traced across his lips. The rumbling noise invaded his ears, amazing overpowering the thudding of his heart racing in his chest. The claw dragged over his chin and down his neck, resting on his throbbing pulse. SCP-9340 was certain he was about to die...he was certain the claw was about to slice his flesh...it would be sharp and smooth as it ripped through his flesh. Against his better judgement, the blonde SCP opened his eyes...meeting those glowing impassive eyes with wet ones filled with terror. Confusion seemed to flicker in the glinting depths for the briefest moment, before a rather explicit curse from the shutting doorway sliced through the silence!
” The Boss growled, grinding his heel into the man's back...making him squirm.
It seemed to take forever to get to the small shower room, it reminded John of a high school locker room really. A single bench across from a short row of lockers, all of which were opposite the tiled shower area. Sherlock helped John slowly walk to a showerhead near a corner, so he could use the walls for support, and stepped back slowly. He left John feeling very unsteady without the strong support of his tall, handsome, rescuer. John stared back at him for a moment, surprised again when Sherlock turned his face away and held out his hand for the coat.
The blonde SCP stumbled as his shoulder slipped off the glass wall and through the open door, falling to one knee with a pained grunt and wince. At least he'd found the door...now he needed to get out of the room. He had no doubts that the room door had been opened, just as his cell door had. With a bit of a struggle SCP-9340 managed to stand, his knee throbbed and he wondered if it was injured badly, and slowly began a terrifying shuffle through the room. His bare toes tentatively reached ahead in the gloom and felt for the various desks and chairs. He managed to avoid the first set of computer desks, but his luck couldn't hold.
Death was a very far away dream for the blonde SCP, the closest he felt he could get to it were the strange states he experienced between deaths. The precious moments between the time they killed him to the time he revived.
John snapped hoarsely, sounding more desperate than he would have liked. “Don't t-touch me. Pl-please...please don't.”
Sherlock turned just ever so slightly to give John a more intensely scrutinizing look, like he couldn't understand why John would want to come along after his initial reaction to the normal world. The blonde man shifted uncomfortably under the stare, looking away and clamping his mouth shut, perhaps the man had a point...perhaps he shouldn't push himself. He really could barely walk and he could hardly breath well...but the desire to explore now that he was free of the club, for now, was beginning to overwhelm him.
Tears brimmed in his eyes as he trembled, “I...I'm J-John. Can I...s-suck your...cock, S-Sir?” He managed to stammer out through his hitching breaths, another round of chuckles breaking out throughout the room.
“Pull!” Sherlock insisted as John wrapped arms around the sagging man’s waist.
Eyes which blinked with...concern and, perhaps, disappointment. The creature stayed put, staring a moment at the panicking SCP. It's pause was enough time for SCP-9340 to see the body attached to those terrifyingly bright eyes, and what a body it was!
Sherlock offered no response, instead his pale hand entered the spray to turn the tap gently. The water cooled, but John didn't protest. The water remained mostly hot, but no longer to the level which might eventually make his skin burn off. Sherlock's arm lingered until John finally nodded and allowed Sherlock to turn the water off. The dark haired man then offered the promised towel, which John took and slowly wrapped around his hips with a sigh.
The blonde man continued to stretch, mostly to appease Irene. As much as he wanted to join in...he knew he didn't need to practice. Pole dancing was one thing John had become very good at in his years of service. It had become his escape...his brief moment where he had power over his life again, where he had control. And he
“Well?
SCP-9340 shuddered and slowly, awkwardly, stood and edged towards the direction of the open door. The pitch blackness of the room wasn't helping him navigate and when he thumped into a thick glass wall with his face, he nearly lost his composure again.
Alright, so let me start out with saying...I'm very sorry that I kind of went on hiatus. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed in my real life and my fan fiction fell to the wayside. I haven't forgotten about this fic and as I always say, I will always finish a story. It may take forever, but I will finish it. I am sorry it took me this long to update, but I really needed to take a break and get things back on track. Hopefully you few that still read this will understand, I completely understand if you don't want to wait around for updates that take a long time to come. Unfortunately I think I'll have to keep updates to once a month at the very least. If I mange more then that's amazing, but I will try my very best to update once a month. So thank you for understanding and thank you for reading. I hope this update is worth the wait, if not, I'm sorry. If you want to keep more up to date with my life, go check out my tumblr. Thank you lovelies for being a great fan base and waiting or not waiting.
He really did wish people would stop referring to his anniversary like it was something to celebrate, but he nodded and took the parcel with trembling fingers. “How long will you be gone then?” She clearly meant to be away if she was giving him this much.
For several long seconds, neither moved. Then, much to the blonde man's shock, Sherlock's ears drooped and he stepped away with a moody glare. Seemingly appeased, the SCP's saviour turned to him. He was middle aged with a hardened, but kind, face. His hair was a silver-grey in the dimness of the room, he was stout and clearly more than capable of handling himself in such a terrible hellhole. His hazel eyes were full of concern as he locked eyes with the blonde SCP, making him look away from the creature that was glaring at them.
Greg’s brow furrowed and his lips moved silently, forming words John had never once seen before in his life. The wall under his hands seemed to glow and groan…and then twist…and then morph. John wanted to be shocked or maybe frightened, but after how his day was starting out, a wall bending under the man’s hands was hardly the strangest thing he’d ever seen.
“I've heard that before...” John breathed, but Sherlock could see that tiny defiant spark starting to glow in the man's eyes once more.
A very nice coat. “Yes, that's mine. I was told you don't have a blanket...at the moment. Something about it being taken away for some reason. I admit I wasn't paying much attention to the nattering twits that mobbed me when I stepped in here with you in my arms.” Sherlock's blunt monologue actually helped John settle some, he still wanted to break down crying and never move again, but at least the sobs were more manageable. “I would have offered to help you to the showers, but—”
Irene's hand left his neck as she straightened to resume her teaching, but she made a pleasant noise of surprise instead. “Well, you must be the new recruit...
He tried to say, but already he was being dragged out of the gloom and back to the living world.
Would Moriarty be waiting for him to try and escape?
John all but screamed at the contact, his while body jumping as if he'd been touched by a live wire. He lashed out, shoving at Sherlock violently. “Get off!” He shouted as he tried to escape from Sherlock...no...from his nightmare-ish tormentor.
Another kiss…Sherlock’s suit jacket. Kiss...John’s shirt, then Sherlock’s.
“He'll do it...if you like? One of the nicest mouths in the club...”
It was a wonder Greg was conscious at all. He was undoubtedly in shock, his body was shaking. His breathing was ragged. The screatching on the door never ceased. It was still there, the thing was still out there waiting.
I...I'm Jo...I'm John...” The man was struggling, shaking his head as if to say he couldn't do it.
was...
John was no virgin, by any means…but the feel of Sherlock’s well slicked cock sliding right inside, with the utmost care, was enough to make John cry out quite loudly. The outburst stilled Sherlock, but John shook his head and rocked himself on Sherlock’s cock as much as he could.
The woman smiled wolfishly, “Oh really? All the
He slowly shook his head, “N-no...no...I just...” John took as deep a breath as he dared and turned his battered face towards his tall rescuer, “Let's go.” He said, feeling so much stronger with Sherlock at his side...at his back.
The taller man smirked as he broke the kiss, he knew John was ready and waiting. He knew John was desperate to have him. He gave John’s cock one gentle stroke, a promise that this would be good…this would be exactly what he needed. John shivered, nodding silently to the unspoken question. He wanted it…and he was ready.
The grey haired man held up his hands, ignoring the snort from Sherlock, to show he wasn't going to harm the SCP. “My...my name's Lestrade. Greg Lestrade. I'm here to help.”
He needed the physical labour...he needed to feel the pain in his body lest he be reminded of the pain in his mind. His voice probably sounded pleading, because her face fell just slightly and she let him go. She knew he was inflicting the pain purposefully, but she didn't say a word. John lingered a moment before he turned to help with the set up.
save him.
John remained at his vanity, barely giving her a glance as he pulled his silken robe closed and resumed his sullen staring. She grinned and greeted her small group of admirers; diligently listening to their enthusiastic introductions, as there were some new faces, as well as the usual praise about how nice she was looking. Irene was nice to them, unlike most of the clients or other thugs and criminals who worked there. She also helped one or two get away when she could. Irene was one of the only people John knew of that didn't agree with how the entertainers were
The lanky detective was staring at him critically, like he didn't believe John (which he didn't), but he said nothing. Instead, Sherlock slipped into the cab with an affirmative nod and motioned John in next to him. The battered man slipped inside and onto the first car seat he'd actually sat on in some years. John closed the cab door to try and hide his discomfort, pressing against it and staring out onto the streets as the cab pulled into the light morning traffic. The impulse to kneel on the floor was overwhelming and he could almost feel the Boss' hand in his hair to shove and hold him there. John flinched involuntarily at the phantom voice in his head, which was screaming at him to get his filthy carcass off the seat and on the floor...and make himself useful. '
Liquid fire spread through his body, agony gripped every bone and wrenched a purely animal screech from his throat. Electricity fizzled in his ears with the faintest of buzzes, like a small gnat that wouldn't go away. His body spasmed, as much as the restraints allowed, uncontrollably. Every nerve burned and every pore bled sticky sweat. Just when the SCP thought he could take no more...the burning stopped abruptly and his body went limp. He gasped in a horribly painful breath, the oxygen shredding his lungs like glass through tissue paper. The blonde SCP wanted desperately to scream, but his voice only rose to a hoarse hiss of air.
“Pl-please...”
Sherlock grunted with the effort of the pace, watching John’s face as the blonde man came apart under him. There were tears rolling down his face, but they weren’t from pain or displeasure. His watery eyes stared up at Sherlock, full of incomparable pleasure.
Sherlock shrugged gently, “It takes a very specific sort to get a rise out of me, Miss Adler...I'm sure they're perfectly adequate at tempting the common criminal.”
SCP-9340's cell door swooshed open silently again, admitting an impassive, masked, lab worker wheeling in a heavy looking gurney. A gurney with chains and leather straps hanging off each side. It looked like something straight out of his darkest nightmares. The faceless worker rolled the horrible, clanking, contraption closer...and he went mad. A desperate scream of frustration sprang from his lungs, echoing in the small cell, as he torqued his small body violently against the strong, unrelenting, hold of the guards. Their grips tightened as they suddenly struggled to keep a firm hold on the thrashing SCP.
It seemed an eternity before John managed to nod mutely and make his way to one of the poles in the front, nearest to Sherlock. Everyone watched silently, very aware of John's skills. They were ever eager to have him preform...which usually flattered the man, but now he was slightly uncomfortable. Irene watched, perched behind Sherlock with a devilish grin. It was almost too much...John almost felt his walls start to crumble again. But he tamped down the unsettled emotions with a deep breath and wrapped his fingers around the cool metal pole.
Sherlock stared and John wasn’t sure if he was mortified by the sight…or something else.
John couldn’t help but giggle just a bit, the idea that Sherlock had lube in his bedside table was quite a scandal. Sherlock was so proper and posh…it just seemed entirely out of character for him. But, this was perhaps a testament to the secrets they still had to share.
“I'm fairly certain that's too hot.” Sherlock's voice rumbled behind him, too close behind him.
Sherlock guided the blonde to the bed with the softest of touches, letting John sink on the soft bed and get comfortable. He stared at John, taking in the whole of him…the bruises…the scars…the muscle…the solider…the doctor.
The impulse to take them and use them on his cuffs overrode his other senses and he knelt to awkwardly scramble for the tiny clips. For a few minutes, he searched blindly for the clips with his cuffed hands. His wrists were raw and a tiny trickle of blood tickled his palm where he pulled and strained too hard. A frustrated whimper threatened to pass through his parted lips just as he managed to get a hold of the first tiny metallic clip.
John could only imagine the other arm was no better.
The first few days John spent at Baker Street were the longest days he'd had to endure in an age. He could hardly eat, he barely slept, and he spent a great deal of his days in a painful haze. He refused to take the painkillers as often as he could get away with, still preferring the throb of a battered body to the horrors of his wounded mind. The beaten man, however, found some solace in his odd companion.
Sorry I took so long to put up this next chapter! I'm kind of trying to find housing in less than a month and it's a full time job...plus my full time job! Anyway, enjoy my lovelies! (Or don't ;))
“I'm Sherlock.” The stranger’s calm voice cut through his thoughts, making him shudder uncertainly and stop his furious scrubbing to turn teary eyes towards him again. “I'm sure you don't want me here, but you want to be handled by your companions even less. They would, and I assume have in the past, only make things worse. You won't believe me, but I'm not here to hurt you. In fact...I'm the one who brought you back here.” He gestured subtly towards John, making the blonde man hesitantly look towards his covered form. A shudder raced through his body as he finally recognized what he was covered by...
The man shrugged and cracked his gum without much concern, looking around like he was inviting people to come and get him. “Seems like they're a little busy.” Moriarty grinned wickedly, “The game begins again, I'd love to stay and chat more...but I have a previous engagement.” He winked as he released the talk button.
“Get up!” Was all one growled, a pair grabbing his arms to haul him to his feet.
the open door. The oppressive silence after the clatter was suddenly filled with various cries and guttural groans that echoed from the depths of the facility. The clatter and bang was like a big dinner bell ringing in the darkness, drawing every creature of the gloomy hellhole right to him.
Curled in the furthest corner of the transparent cell was a single occupant, one who curled into an even smaller ball as the room lights were brightened. The occupant wore a terrible white outfit, one that looked more akin to a mental patient than anything, and was entirely barefoot. His ragged blonde hair was barely visible under his arms, which he kept over his head in a defensive manner. The researchers barely spared him a glance, just continuing their daily start up routine.

John clenched his eyes tightly as he came awake to the familiar sensation caused by the vigorous
Any and all embarrassment he might have felt was lost as John draped himself against the solid pole, curling his arm over his head and around the pole before he whipped around to gracefully ease his body off the ground. He didn't feel the pain of bruises or protest of sore muscles when he wrapped his legs around the pole and let go. Falling back in a graceful arch before he lowered himself onto his back, casting Sherlock another searing glance. The lanky man's eyes were fixed on John...following his every move intently.
called him. He didn't actually know his real name, nor did he know about how he'd come to be in the rubble of Baskerville...wherever that was. All he knew for certain were two things: One, he was that he was in in a hellhole so deep that even the devil himself wouldn't tread there; two,

SCP-9340 banged into the stretcher, the one he'd been restrained on earlier, and set the horrible device rolling into an unstable table, which toppled with a loud bang and clatter. Fear froze the SCP in place as the loud noises ricocheted hollowly around the room...and
John shuddered as the even gaze slowly turned to him, he pressed back against the stone cold wall and tried to contain a whimper. He didn't know who the man was, except that he hadn't taken John's forced offer...which was unusual. Even more unusual was having a
“No.” John shook his head, but it wasn’t his choice. And he was a fraction too slow to stop what came next.
Fucking
“I'll find a towel.”
“Y-you...?” SCP-9340 began in a weak tone.
Very sorry about the wait lovelies! I do have to battle with life and projects as well as this, but I promise I won't leave you with an unfinished story and I promise everything will become clear as the plot unfolds!
Irene was speaking and the others were preforming, John kept to the back to avoid being noticed...though in a group of ten people it wouldn't be hard to see John standing stock-still. He was trying to sort out his feelings towards the dark haired man who was sitting in the chair and watching them. Though...his bright blue eyes were focused on John. The blonde swallowed hard and trembled, looking away sharply. He couldn't decide if he was afraid of Sherlock...or...something else more unsettling. He tried not to think about it, staring anywhere but at Sherlock.
“Get dressed.” Was all Sherlock offered before he retreated to the the washroom to tend to his unkempt appearance.
Sherlock gave her a slow smirk, but offered no response. Instead he glanced to the watchful performers...and briefly to John. “I was told you'd be here today and thought I'd stop by to see if you had any secrets to a successful career at this club.” He casually put his hands into his pockets, “I do hope I'm not interrupting anything...”
“John.” Sherlock tried again, this time his voice was firm. Still the blonde man offered no response, so the dark haired man dropped to his knees to grasp John's face in his hands. “Look at me!”
A bead of sweat worked down Sherlock’s spine, he dropped his head and pressed his forehead to John’s. Their panting in tandem as Sherlock reached between them to finally take John’s bobbing cock in hand and stroke it in time with the thrusts! John arched like he’d touched a live wire! Sherlock gasped sharply as John clenched around his cock without much warning!
“W-Welcome...” He gasped through the pain, “Welcome to...
As soon as he did, the lights flickered ominously. SCP-9340 felt a rush of fearsome familiarity race up his spine as the lights in his cell flickered and dimmed. It couldn't be possible...it couldn't be...a breach! Presumably there was a warning voice going off in the halls, alerting the staff to the problem.
“You want to die, right...
John Watson stared forlornly into the mirror on his small, gaudy, vanity at the end of the long shared row. The lights were big and bright, feather boas hung here and there, wedged in the corner was a picture of him and several women posing in front of a statue...a memento from a holiday to Italy that the
lucky he let you come at all! We had a deal!” The saviour snapped, drawing his shoulders back firmly and pointing to a spot several feet away.
The Boss shrugged as he slung John back into the middle of the room, “Your loss.” Strolling towards John to press a foot down on the back of his neck to keep him pinned down. John let out a sound that could have been a sob, his ass stuck up in the air and his hands clenched into tight fists. “It's a special day, Johnny Boy...it's your fifth year anniversary at the club.” John trembled, “I think that warrants a celebration...so, who wants to fuck this useless whore first?”
“...get in the cab, John?”
“Stop treating me like I matter!” John shouted hoarsely as he glared pleadingly into Sherlock's passive eyes, desperate to have the man abuse him like he was used to. He couldn't handle being treated like a human being who had feelings, he couldn't handle someone caring about him after so many years of agony and abuse.
The stout blonde SCP thrashed against the larger guards, successfully yanking one arm free so he could land a heavy blow to the other's jaw. He didn't get another chance to retaliate as he was suddenly being crushed into the hard floor by a hefty guard, who twisted one of his arm's roughly behind his back. The SCP bucked violently, trying to dislodge his latest attacker, but another body soon added to the pressure on his back and made not only moving difficult...but breathing as well.
John panted, the ache of his body renewing tenfold...but a new pain in his groin added to his misery. He didn't turn around, unable to look at Sherlock as he released the pole to turn and hurriedly retreat into the dressing room. The last thing he needed was Sherlock, or anyone else, to see the tear rolling down his cheek. He could hear Irene calling after him, but he didn't look back. “I need some air!” Was all he offered in a terrified and shaking tone, leaving his companions worried and confused...and leaving Sherlock wonder struck...
Sherlock swallowed hard, feeling his head nod before he’d even really finished the thought. The shaggy haired man leaned over to press another long, tender, kiss to John’s lips and then reached for the lube instead.
“Who...who are you?”
Sherlock offered a ghost of an expression, one which seemed to mimic awe, before he moved by John and opened the door. He didn't wait and he didn't linger. If John was ready...then there was truly no point in lingering and asking if the man was ready. He pushed John, because he knew that John could take it. The man was a born fighter...he was stubborn and somewhere under that broken shell was the brave solider that wasn't willing to back down. It was just a matter of time before that John reappeared.
Pain flared around him in the darkness as he heard the faintest voice in the darkness. It was a smooth, rich, voice that set the confused SCP on fire with desperate longing. It was the first time he could hear the voice! He felt another wave of pain race over him, pulling him away from his comforting shadow, which reached for him.
The blonde man caught his arm, surprising himself and Sherlock. John stared uncertainly into the man's striking blue eyes, noticing the horrible, dark, bags which were forming under them. He had the faintest hint of stubble and his outfit looked in desperate need of a wash. Had he even taken a shower since John's arrival?
So it had been a few hours at best...it always felt like seconds when he was in the darkness. The gurney was gone, but someone stood outside his cell. They were keeping careful watch to see if he actually died it seemed. SCP-9340 sat slowly, he felt physically fine...but mentally he was exhausted. All he wanted...
“My name's Jim.
Sherlock swallowed as John made a terrible wet noise of terror...or pleading. “N-no...no more...pl-please...I can't...”
Sherlock saw the momentary flicker of uncertainty, the thought that he could flee and not have to deal with Sherlock if he so chose. Yet the blonde man stubbornly stayed to tentatively kneel over Sherlock's hips. He was tense and unwilling to press the same contact as he had done when he was dancing, yet he remained to test how true Sherlock's words had been. The dark haired detective was even more impressed when John did finally settle to straddle his hips, his tension and shyness starting to fade into that fluidity, that seduction.
John was rewarded with a blush from the man, “One never knows when they might need some…extra lubrication.”
John didn't know how the man had managed to enter so quietly, but he didn't lift his head from the spray. He tensed visibly and took a deep, shaking, breath. “So what if it is?”
Sherlock offered a hand to John, which the man slowly took. It felt good…comforting even. And the fur was beyond soft. John wasn’t sure if he should go with Sherlock, but anywhere had to be better than here.
Sherlock breezed into the cafe, walking casually to the till and slipping the invitation down on the counter, “What's the special?” It was all very cloak and dagger, kind of boring...but the lanky detective followed the instructions. Watching the clerk take up the invitation and slip it into the till.
He reiterated, the small group of concerned young men and women scurrying without a second glance at John.
“I hate anniversaries...” John mumbled, forcing back tears. “I told you not to do anything...” Lifting his head to look over his shoulder at the small group of women and men gathered behind him, totalling ten in all. They were his friends and his family.
Sorry about the delay lovelies, I just started my new job and I've been rather exhausted. I also had a bit of an accident that resulted in me being kind of sore and hardly able to bend over for the better part of a week. Anyway, here is another little chapter to keep you up to date. I'll try to be more prompt, but this is a weird kind of time. Thank you for hanging in there and I promise so much more is coming down the line!
The creature, Sherlock, growled and pinned his ears; looking around at the name. Even Lestrade seemed put off, glancing to Sherlock and then back to the terrified and confused SCP. “Sherlock...I didn't know...”
Sherlock seemed to have already forgotten the incident as he opened the door, a mischievous smile touching his lips. “
so you can make more money. Remember...it's not about
A gentle brush of a cool hand over his cheek brought John back to the man over him. Tears still welled in his eyes, but they were not bad tears. They were good ones, Sherlock’s bright eyes stared down at him…watching and waiting for John to nod before he continued.
have survived. He'd been found by a tactical unit...whose orders were to “tie-up loose ends”. The blonde SCP had been shot on sight...and before the unit cleared the hall, he'd come back to life with a sputtering gasp and no sign of the bullet holes which had killed him only moments prior.
John turned his head and opened his tearful eyes, utterly stunned to see the dark haired stranger standing only a few feet away. Behind him John's small band of companions watched nervously, gathered in a fidgeting group at the edge of their long row of vanities. But they didn't come any closer.
The creature loomed closer, taking delicate steps onto the toppled chair that the blonde SCP's legs were still entangled with. He could feel the warmth radiating off the creature's body as he perched on the chair. His movement's were feline and fluid, boxing the SCP in with long arms on either side of his face. A rumbling noise worked in the creature’s chest, one that chilled the blonde SCP to the bone. SCP-9340 pressed against the floor, his breath caught in his chest and pain radiating from his hand, as the deer feature leaned its masked face in closer. There was a glint of fangs under the mask, which was enough to make the captive man's heart stutter with fear!
The stranger was staring intently and evenly at the woman who was kneeling next to John. “Leave.”
“Up it to sixty percent.”
Pain rocketed down his spine, bursting bright red behind his eyes. The minute Sherlock arrived in the club without John Watson was the exact minute he’d agreed to descend into the hellish existence he was in now.
The blonde man bit his lower lip as he looked down at himself, his shoulders shaking just slightly with the most subtle of sobs. It had been so long since he'd had anything normal...it had been so long since he'd had a full wardrobe...it was almost too much and he hadn't even made it outside the door that stood between him and London. Slowly, he reached a hand to wipe at his eyes, wincing as he nudged bruises.
. The blonde SCP waited out the spasms and carefully catalogued his location and the state he was in.
John nodded as they arrived at his mattress, “Makes sense...I guess.” Hesitating before slowly letting go of his strong, helpful, handsome, stranger and lowering himself onto his hard mattress. Lying on his side with a wince. He was exhausted...emotionally and physically. He still felt like crying...but for the moment he was just tired. Sherlock stood over him, watching him until his eyelids started to droop. His presence wasn't at all unwelcome...and in fact, John found it a pleasant change to the usual overbearing coddling of his companions. They meant well, but often times reacted too much for John to take. The stand off-ish and slightly commanding aura that lingered around Sherlock was exactly what John needed when he was completely out of sorts. He was on the cusp of sleep, the point where it was inevitable that he would fall into dreams...or nightmares, when a warm and soft fabric settled over his body.
Fighting was futile, but SCP-9340 had nothing to lose. He couldn't die and it wasn't from lack of trying. They were going to keep killing him every single day...and they made it painful regardless if he fought or not. The guards kept him pinned against the cold floor, wrenching his arms behind his back and applying too tight steel cuffs. The SCP would be bruised and bloodied by them by the end of the day. He was dragged to his feet and forced, still struggling, towards the centre of his cell.
Sherlock panted, struggling up and glaring at the wall, “Something…something is blocking our portal home.”
“You must be Miss Adler...I've heard a great deal about you.” Taking her hand and pressing a kiss to her knuckles in the most gentlemanly fashion, but his actions seemed slightly forced and not very genuine...or at least John thought so.
“Then finish what you started...I won't stop you.” Sherlock urged softly.
“Oh John...” She sighed as she slowly strolled down the long line of mirrors, turning his face with a gentle touch on his chin. “Look at you.” She frowned and gently stroked her thumb over his slightly swollen lip, making him wince subtly. “I wish you would let me talk to him about this. I'm sure I could convince him to leave a little less bruising.”
The pass code, of course, was another problem...or maybe it even needed a key card! Out of hopeful desperation, the blonde SCP crouched slightly and tried to work the door controls with his elbow. Much to his distress and disappointment, the door pad just beeped angrily. It needed something that he didn't have and though he loathed to turn back, the blonde was not staying near a locked door. It was no better than staying in his cell.
A bolt of fear sliced down his spine as his eyes stared around for the creature, desperately wide and horrified. The room was deathly silent, minus the erratic beating of his heart as it thudded heavily in his chest. Uncontrollable shudders raced down his spine and a bead of sweat trickled down his forehead.
Was all SCP-9340 could say as he stared into the deadly predatory eyes, waiting for the creature to pounce and end him.
The voices echoed in the back of his mind, refusing to be silent.
, was scrawled in beautiful cursive letters across the front.
John felt his heart twinge, “Don't worry...I'm not going anywhere.” He sighed as he looked at them...they were scared and tired...some were on the verge of giving up hope. He knew that feeling, that breaking point. Some were newer faces...some were old companions that had been there for almost as long as John...most didn't stay more than a year or two though. They were there to pay off debts they owed to the Boss. And John made sure they did. He wasn't there for the same reason...and he never told them why, just helping them pay off their debt so they could get away from this place.
Irene's voice once more cut through his thoughts sharply, drawing his attention to her. “Look at you...you're not even excited a little bit.”
“John...” Sherlock breathed, his voice decidedly weakened by the chill still clinging to his body.
it. He loved making criminal scumbags dive for their wallets to try and keep him on stage...he loved knowing that he made them squirm. It seemed like such a trivial thing to be proud of, but John was willing to take what he could get after so many years of being controlled by someone else.
...don't you think?”
The blonde man shook his head to dispel the flashback, struggling to focus on Sherlock's voice and not the phantom stinging pain in his neck. He reached a hand to rub at it as he slowly stepped towards the cab, nodding rapidly like nothing was wrong.
A horrible shiver gripped John's spine as Sherlock beckoned him to the cab, unintentionally calling forth a memory John had rather hoped to keep buried. Sherlock's brow furrowed as John seemed to hesitate, taking an uncertain step towards him, “John?”
Sherlock was surprised by the thought, it was halfway too his lips when his blood ran absolutely cold and John went ridged with fright.
Sherlock helped him to his feet, having to stoop to allow John to put his other arm over his slender shoulders. The man was much taller than John first thought and it was slightly awkward to shuffle along, especially given that Sherlock was trying not to bump into him. The man was trying to avoid touching John as much as he could and John could have cried out of gratitude. He couldn't remember the last time anyone had cared about what he wanted.
At least that was what
“Sherlock Holmes...” He paused as those glowing eyes fixed with SCP-9340's once more. “...and you're
Sherlock’s breath hitched in his chest, “John…”
The dressing room doors snapped open as a devastatingly gorgeous woman strolled in, “Guess who?” She purred in a tone absolutely dripping with seduction.
The Boss scowled and gripped a handful of blonde hair to pull his head back again, “Say it. Right.
, and slipped down to the floor of the back seat. John felt his knees dig into the floor and the press of stiff seats against both sides of his body. It was tight and John could feel the harsh pain the pressure put on every bruise on his body. The pain was intense, yet John would take it over the horrible memories that refused to die.
The tears that had brimmed in his eyes squeezed their way free, trailing down his cheeks as he bit back a whimper. “God...Sherlock…”
John glanced tot he cabbie, who was also blissfully unaware of much of what his passengers were doing. He was more interested in nodding his head along with whatever song happened to be playing just slightly too loudly in his headphones. The blonde man watched the driver for a few more seconds before he shifted, uncertainly, towards Sherlock. John expected Sherlock to question him about it, but the man didn't look up or over...
She always did those things...touched him so kindly and spoke to him so smoothly. She had always looked after John as best as she could and John had always responded to her kindness before. But her touch was...different...it wasn't unpleasant or unwelcome, but it wasn't soothing to John as it had always been in the past. Her words...didn't make him feel better. But the blonde man forced himself to offer his expected response. Forced himself to look up gratefully into her placid eyes and perfect face and offer a small nod. He didn't want her to see his decimated emotions or his uncertainty. So he closed his eyes and let her pull his face gently into her soft abdomen, stroking her fingers in his hair as he just breathed calmly and tried to find that same soothing presence Irene had offered before.
“Thanks...” John managed to mumble, feeling at least slightly less disgusted with himself now that he was...cleaner.
“John!”
bits, I do hope.”
“Take five everyone! John, come over here.” Irene's voice cutting through John's pain hazed thoughts. He sighed and moved over to Irene as the woman strolled casually to her chair to pick up her wine glass. “Sit.” She commanded after taking her seat and gesturing to the floor at her feet. John sighed and slowly sat at her feet, closing his eyes when she laid her hand on his shoulder. Her long, strong, fingers started to press into his tensed muscles, poking and prodding. “You know I don't approve of you hurting yourself...I told you I would be more than happy to do it for you.”
A bitter, incredulous, laugh rose from SCP-9340's chest as tears wobbled in his eyes. “F-fuck off! I've...I've heard that b-before!” Shaking his head and shakily stepping away again, “For t-two years, I've heard th-that!” He winced as he shouted, his eyes darting fearfully to the closed door. His breathes were rapid and ragged as he struggled to understand what was going on, “Fuck...I...I...I don't know you...d-do...do I know you?”
That seemed to be all the encouragement that Sherlock really needed, because the man started to slowly thrust into John…picking up the pace with every little gasp and grunt of pleasure that John graced him with until the man was clinging to the sheets with desperation. Sherlock gasped and panted in time with John, the feel of John around his cock was incredible!
Sherlock’s eyes turned dark…grim. He opened his mouth, then shut it. Wanting to argue, to say no. John’s brow furrowed, but even he could tell what Greg was asking for.
John had been mouthing the silent phrase and shaking his head for a handful of seconds before Sherlock recognized the man had stopped talking. Like John, Sherlock had been overwhelmed by the images he was seeing. He blinked and stared into the unfocused eyes of the broken man that was crumbling at his feet.
unbruised.” He offered a forced grin as if it was no big deal. It was actually one of the better anniversaries in terms of the outcome. Irene had seen him in worse condition in the years she had known him.
The silent slide of the hydraulic door went unheard in the dim, disturbingly white, room. A pair of researchers, with long white lab coats, strode along the dark rows of computers and various other machines, turning each on methodically as they came to it. They worked in perfect synchronization as they progressed towards the centre...towards the containment cell. Its thick glass walls allowing the researchers to see into the cell from every possible angle. It was bare of all furniture...no bed...no chairs...nothing for comfort.
John swallowed thickly, should he mention Moriarty’s voice?
All thoughts ground to a halt when he felt slick fingers trace between his ass cheeks. John gasped softly and his hips rolled up to better spread himself for the man he trusted implicitly over him. Sherlock watched him, carefully slicking John in preparation. It was tender and it was…more than John could have hoped for. It was this thoughtfulness from Sherlock that was still unexpected for John.
Sherlock stepped up next to him, shoving his hands deep into his coat pockets after turning his collar up against the chill. He hardly spared John a glance, assured the man was able to handle himself, as he moved to the curb to hail a cab. One pulled up, almost like it had been waiting nearby, and Sherlock gestured John inside.
Yet control was something he was denied in his current role, unless he was up on a stage seducing criminals out of their money. Sherlock briefly wondered if John thought of him as another criminal to seduce for money...though the thought didn't have a chance to linger when John twisted his hips exquisitely and leaned his head back into the warm water. In that moment, Sherlock felt he could stay on the hard tile floor forever and admire the complex blonde man in all his raw, seductive, powerful, glory.
Sherlock just shrugged and tossed the towel across the room, not caring much where it landed (which happened to be amongst a strange pile of beakers on the floor). John made a mental note not to use that towel again...and to possibly have it thrown out. He watched the lanky man uncertainly as he slunk around the flat to grab his coat and gloves, paying John very little attention until he fixed his scarf into place.
His cell door was open.
SCP-9340 breathed in a horrified whisper, hearing the terrible blaring voice echoing in his memories. “Oh god...it's happening again...” The blonde SCP was confused and terrified, not sure what he was saying or why. Were his memories coming back? What did he mean by
John was just starting to work his way of the couch when Sherlock stepped into the flat. He looked surprised for an instant and also a bit stricken that John was up and moving. A newspaper was folded under one arm, his hands were preoccupied with carrying what looked to be breakfast. He'd no doubt been to the cafe, which suggested it was too early for Mrs. Hudson to be awake. The dark haired man stared a moment longer before he straightened and moved over to set the paper bag and paper cups on the low coffee table.
It was a memory. He knew it was, because Sherlock clearly didn’t have the same reaction and Greg was the one conjuring the portal.
The blonde man did not respond, but his head started to shake back and forth as he relived his nightmare. The horror and hopelessness which started to work into his cringing face made Sherlock shift uncertainly.
As he often did, John was once again staring into the mirror of his vanity. This time he was examining the bruising on the side of his face and around his eye. It was still quite obvious, given that it had only been a few days since he'd gotten them, but in time they would fade completely...as they always did. The blonde man sighed and closed his eyes, trying not to think too long on how he'd gotten these latest bruises. He needed to focus on work...not his fragile emotional walls that he was diligently building back up.
I know this took a long time to finish. I always meant to close it off much sooner, but life certainly happened and my writing was sidelined for a long time. I'm coming back slowly and surely to finish off the things I promised, like I said I would, and I hope that everyone is at least happy with the closure of this particular story. I might come back and re-write it one day, but for now I'm going to say this is the end. Thank you for being so tolerate and waiting so long. I'm sorry that you had to wait this long and it's only this chapter. But thank you for those of you that waited for this and thank you for all your continued support through these years. I hope to get back on the writing wagon a little more readily soon, but I always promise this and I always will finish a story even if it takes years to do it. I am sorry about that, I just couldn't bring myself to write for a while, and what little writing I did wasn't anything on my full length fics. I hate leaving them hanging for so long, but I promise they will all be finished in due time. So please enjoy, or don't, the final chapter and maybe I'll come back and re-visit this at another time. Much Love <3 LegoLock
John seemed terrified, embarrassed, and stunned. For a moment he looked like he might flee, but a desperate longing crept into his face. A longing to believe that he had control...and that he didn't have to fear the dark haired stranger offering him kindness. The blonde man's hands slowly unfurled from their tight fists, tentatively splaying over Sherlock's soaking wet shirt and against his chest. When Sherlock made no move to protest, John leaned his face towards him. His lips were desperately close, but John hesitated to make full contact. Sherlock didn't pressure him, allowing the stout man to apply gentle pressure to his chest and guide him backwards onto his back so the water now cascaded on John's back and around them.
“H-hit me...” John finally whispered, his face slowly lifting to meet Sherlock's. “Pl-please...”
It was the hypnotizing gaze of a predator.
“Awfully bold to say that...
He hesitated for a fraction of a second and then nodded, pushing open the door and stepping into a stairwell that spiralled down out of sight. The door clicked shut behind him before he slowly started to make his way down, wondering what the clerk had been talking about. Certainly not coffee. An uncertain shudder threatened to escape him, but Sherlock tamped it down before he reached the bottom, pushing open the door and stepping into a world he couldn't have ever expected.
The command wasn't shouted, but the tone was authoritative and belonged to a voice John had heard only a few hours ago, or he assumed it was hours.
His name was SCP-9340.
...where your darkest desires are our pleasure.” She purred and strolled over to help the somewhat stunned detective shrug out of his coat. “This must be your first time.”
John pulled away from her hand, finding it didn't sooth him as it usually did. “You know it won't stop him...and it's not like it's a regular thing anyway. For most of the year I remain
“That’s it, we’re leaving.” Greg hissed, he was so not dealing with whatever the hell that was beyond the door.
“No...thank you.” Sherlock said smoothly, trying to ignore the whimpering man between his knees, “Don't enjoy being watched.”
to our new friend.” All but throwing the man towards Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
The room was posh and rather large. A fully functioning bar ran along the far wall, even at a glance Sherlock could tell they had several rare vintages of wine...and several other types of alcohol he was certain had been banned in most places. Various forms of sofas and chairs were placed around the room, all were leather and they alternated in black and white groupings. Various doors took up the back wall. In the very centre of the room was a small stage with a gleaming golden pole in the middle. And draped around the pole was a very naked woman. Settled around the stage were a handful of men, they were making idle chat over the low music. Mostly ignoring the woman that was elegantly twisting around the pole in a way Sherlock wasn't sure should be normal.
A special thanks to my new Beta reader, sherlockfan! Your input is greatly appreciated!
John Watson...”
The terrified, helpless, SCP stared at the gloomy figure and waited for his end. Hoping that if it was the end...it would at least be permanent this time. The figure lingered just inside the door, sizing up the SCP on the floor for several long minutes, before a noise in the corridor made the eyes flicker away. SCP-9340 felt the hypnotizing hold break and instantly scrambled to his feet. His indistinct-possible-aggressor stepped hurriedly into the room and jabbed the button for the door when another noise issued, much closer than the last, in the hall. The blonde man struggled around a turned over desk, turning to try and catch a glimpse of the creature...but the eyes were gone!
The blonde man hesitated, hiccoughing as he struggled to tamp down the emotionally distressed sounding sobs, and then slowly reached out to take the exquisitely warm hand towel. John slowly pulled the cloth back, pressing it to his face without a second thought and scrubbing at the make-up and tears. He could feel the sting of bruises that were forming and a cut on his swollen lower lip, but they were the least of his pains. The man lingered, watching John scrubbing until he was certain his face would be raw. He really wanted a shower...but he could hardly fathom moving given how sore he was. A shower would just have to wait...
John lunged as Sherlock did. A powerful tail lashed out, catching John across the face and sending him falling flat on his arse. The deerman hoisted Greg from the ground, Greg didn’t even try to fight him. His head lulled back limply.
As the cab approached their unknown destination, Sherlock removed his hand slowly and helped John wiggle back into his seat. If the cabbie had seen anything, he wasn't telling. Sherlock paid the fare and both men stepped out onto a fairly quiet street. Sherlock fixed his collar and started towards an inconspicuous looking shop, leaving John to follow in his wake. The blonde man only stared around for a moment before hurrying, as much as he could, to catch up.
“What the hell was that?” He was asking Sherlock while trying to get Greg to let him see the arms.
Several of the young woman cried out as they rushed to greet her, happy to see Irene Adler.
John tried not to flinch as Sherlock's nimble hands neared him. He couldn't help but tense and anticipate pain...or roving hands. A tear streaked down his cheek as he closed his eyes and tried to breath deeply and calm himself. Sherlock seemed to wait for him to do so, then he gently helped the man to sit up. Propping him up carefully so he could pull the dark warm coat around his body. Helping him slip shaking arms into the too long sleeves before he let John hold it closed with one hand. Helping preserve what little modesty John had left. It was a small thing for Sherlock, John was sure, but it meant so much to the blonde man.
John’s fingers trembled as he finally pressed his hands on Sherlock’s pristine skin. He was cool to the touch, and John briefly thought the man might have poor circulation…before Sherlock’s long fingers stroked down his chest, smoothing down John’s body to where his cock bobbed, eager for attention. John almost hit his knees when the long, cool, fingers wrapped about his cock. Sherlock’s tenderness was killing him in the best way.
The creature was tall, taller than SCP-9340 imagined, and sleek. He, for it clearly was a he, was a terrifyingly handsome cross between a human and some sort of majestic stag. His torso appeared mostly human…his arms where almost impossibly long and his fingers were nimble, each tipped with a rather terrific looking claw. His legs, however, where not human...they appeared to be some sort of deer legs. The cloven hooves looked sharp as knives from what he could see through the feathering tufts of silken curls. They matched the silken curls that spiralled at his elbows, elegantly flowing with every minute movement the creature made. Another curled patch of fur travelled from, what SCP-9340 assumed would be, the creature's naval to somewhere between his legs. It was meant to obscure genitalia not doubt, but he could see the hint of something, not quite small, outlined in the depths of the curls.
The blonde man's head snapped up and around, taking in the sight of the handsome man as he strolled across the club. Sherlock was in a black, tailored, somewhat casual, suit jacket and a very pristine white shirt. He walked with a confident and casual stride, flashing a handsome smile as he approached Irene.
Instead, John felt ling fingers stroke through his hair gently. The contact was unexpected, and did make him jump slightly, but it was soothing. Sherlock said nothing, accepting John's slow progress for what it was. He just continued to card smooth fingers in John's hair until the blonde man worked up enough courage to lift his eyes slowly to Sherlock's. The detective met his gaze evenly, he wasn't judging John. He wasn't mad. He removed his hand from John's hair to stroke his thumb over a single uncertain tear track on the beaten man's bruised face and shifted back to stare out the window like nothing was unusual about where John was.
Two years ago...they'd taken him captive and brought him to his current hell.
“Can I...” John began, but the question caught in his throat.
“Just in time...” He ground out roughly and motioned Sherlock to sit, “We were just getting to the good part of the meeting.” The detective slowly sat, hearing faint chuckles from the dark shadows in the room. “Now, love...” He growled as he wrenched the blonde man's head back sharply, “Go introduce yourself
On the fifth day, John woke to the subtle sounds of morning traffic. He could hear the bustle of people making their way to work and the sounds of cars passing by. A shudder worked down his spine, but he slowly sat up and forced himself to ignore the usual pangs of pain. The sounds of life beyond the flat still grated on John's fragile mind, but he felt he could tolerate them. The queasiness he'd felt for the past few days seemed to be gone as well.
“Le-leave me alone!” He shouted, pressing into his corner desperately.
He felt a delicate hand on his shoulder before someone pulled his silken blue robe back over the exposed flesh...over his old scar. “Happy Anniversary, Johnny...” A small cupcake with a single lit candle was placed on the desk in front of him.
Lestrade slowly shook his head, his eyes were soft. “You don't know me...but I know about you.”
Sherlock was at his side rather rapidly, gently taking him by the elbow so he didn't fall over and hurt himself more. They waited out the painful spasm before Sherlock helped John through the flat and down the stairs, making the man pause so he could fetch something from Mrs. Hudson.
She was a patron of the club and sort of a partner. She helped
The floor.
Sherlock nodded and offered an arm for John to take, kind of like an old fashioned gentleman would offer a lady. He supposed it was less embarrassing than clinging to the man's side, but he couldn't deny that being pressed to Sherlock's side had felt...rather good. None the less, John took the offered arm so they could slowly make their way back to his bed. He left a dripping trail, but no one would care.
Tears leaked down his face, squeezing through his eyelids even though he tried to stop them. He wanted to...but he couldn't. He hurt everywhere and his emotions were frayed. The sobs weren't too far behind and in seconds he was bawling in earnest. He cursed through a sob as trembles started to work through his resolve, he was a pitiful sight and though he silently begged for no one to see him...he knew there were others nearby. He could hear them. Obviously the club had closed down for the night, the music wasn't throbbing in the background, so that would mean everyone was there and everyone was watching. John curled in on himself, trying to hide, to escape the eyes he could feel on his shaking form. Much to his distress, soft scurrying feet shuffled over to his side. It was one of the ladies...he didn't know which and at that point he didn't really care. She tried to sooth him, but her touch made him flinch.
The dark haired detective glanced at John, then away as he reluctantly nodded. “Perhaps...I have errands to run first.”
All that mattered was he was back in the dressing room, lying on his side...on his mattress...on the floor. There was something warm over his body...warm and soft. He assumed it was a blanket, but he didn't have one that was as soft as whatever was draped over him. But, again, he wasn't about to complain about it or think long on it. The cuffs had been removed at some point, cuffs he had savagely been pulling against with the hopeful intent of making his wrists bleed. The pain of the sharp, biting, metal was meant to take his mind off the pain of his body being roughly abused. He could feel a dull throbbing ache from each wrist suggesting he'd at least made them very raw if not bloody. Thankfully, the horrible outfit he'd been forced to wear was gone. Maybe it had been torn off during the celebrations, John could no longer recall. He wasn't trying very hard to either.
Sherlock hesitated. John regained his feet and started to lunge, but it was too late. Claws glinted in the darkness an instant before they disappeared into Lestrade’s chest!
