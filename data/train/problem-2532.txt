Still reeling from the shock, Castiel had no idea what kind of forgiveness Dean was talking about, but remembering that Sam was in danger, he quickly pulled himself together.
— That's smart of you, Sammy, you know it's no use. That's why I didn't tell you all the details until we left, because I knew you'd try to talk me out of it. You'd better not waste your time, this warlock Ogden has already tried to do that. Believe me, I know what I'm doing and what I'm risking. Compared to what Cas has done for me, how many years he's been with us and saved our asses, it's nothing! Just a little spark of soul to make this magic work — I'm ready to do much more for him…
— Speak of the devil, — Dean chuckled, answering the phone. — Hey, Sam, what's up? Did you miss me? We'll be right…
— Oh, Dean... I... — Castiel's hot whisper touched the hunter's face, and Dean slightly touched the angel's lips with his index finger.
— I fixed your wings, Cas, — Dean said with a satisfied smile, which seemed drunken . — I can see them, and I think they're pretty..."
Finally, Dean managed to focus on the angel's face, and he looked directly into Cas's eyes. The hunter's pupils were unnaturally dilated, and his tongue was slurred.
— Cas, you don't have to... — the Winchester began, but quickly changed his mind when the angel tightened his grip and began to move his hand up and down, gently pressing. — Oh, no, forget what I've said ... damn... Please go on…
She took the bloody cloth from the wound and passed it over with her narrow hand, which shone with a radiant light. After a moment, during which Dean felt a strong but gentle warmth, the pain dissapeared without any trace as well as the wound.
...They sat, closely embracing each other, under the dome of the blue-black wings of Cas, which he carefully covered his beloved. Opening his eyes, Dean stroked the soft flexible feathers, and the angel's wings quivered slightly with pleasure.
— Cas, look... — he said in a hushed voice, — maybe this is just my thought, but if... if that kiss offended you, if it made you feel, you know... uncomfortable, I'm ready to apologize, and we'll try to forget that stupid incident, — looking up for a moment, Dean made sure that the angel was listening carefully, and hurriedly continued: — I don't want to ruin our relationship, so... I'm sorry. I should've kept my temper, but this Enochian magic made me act like a jumpy wasted schoolgirl! I'm... very ashamed of my behavior. I promise, Cas, I swear it won't happen...
In disbelief, Dean reached out and carefully took the small piece of paper, as if afraid it would crumble to dust at his touch.
He opened his eyes, which he didn't need to squint at the bright sun that struck them, and the blue of the distant sky was reflected in them, rivaling them in brightness of color. No, he will not sit in the mountains waiting for manna from Heaven. After all, uncertainty and unbearable suspense can be worse than death, and he was convinced that was just such a case. Dean had given him wings and didn't deserve to be abandoned without explanation for some reason he didn't know. Castiel would come back and tell him everything, and then together they would decide what to do with their feelings and that fateful deal.
— Morning, — Dean mumbled, his voice husky with recent sleep. — What a romantic atmosphere you have here. Flowers…
— What, Dean? Why did you lie? — Castiel asked, puzzled. He lowered his wings a little, and the pinkish rays of the rising sun lit up his face.
Catching the bedding that had flown into his hands, Dean angrily tucked it between his head and the back of the armchair and closed his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest.
— Actually, you've just said that, not me, — the younger Winchester continued to tease, seeing Dean's face finally turn red and every freckle be clearly visible. — Come on, that's great! I'm glad you finally admitted it to yourself!
— That's interesting, — she noted. — Hardly it's humane, I could have just knocked him out. But we had money.
This time their kiss was passionate and deep, unrestrained by any fears, free and quickly inflaming an inescapable desire. Dean's tongue slid wetly along the angel's lips and sank inside gently but surely. Castiel's breath quickened, and he drew back a little, breaking the kiss. A vague smile played on his wet lips as he met Dean's bleary gaze.
— I'm just scared of flying, scared as hell! — Dean rattled off, determined to be completely honest. — Right up to the point of nausea and cold sweat! It just paralyzes me to think of going anywhere — by plane, by helicopter, by ... freaking airship, dammit! And the same thing  with angelic flights! I just didn't want to give myself away as a coward, that's all…
— He's not my... — Dean began, but his words were cut off when Matariel gently touched his forehead. It felt like a quiet whisper went through his head, and an invisible force touched his heart softly, as if a light, cool cloth slid across his chest.
They both stopped abruptly, not looking at each other. The sudden silence was broken only by the faint rustle of music coming faintly from the large wireless headphones that Dean had left on the rumpled bedspread. Castiel was about to snap his fingers to stop the annoying sound when Dean reached back, grabbed the headphones, turned off the music, and threw them back without looking at them, and they were lucky to fall on a soft surface.
— Cas? — he heard Dean's voice, or rather, not a sound, but a thought that came to him without breaking the magical silence as if out of time and space.  — Are you here? I can feel you... but I can't see you…
— You... smoked dumbass! — Dean slapped him jokingly, also smiling through his tears and wiping his wet face with his sleeve. — Screw you, it's bullshit!"
The beauty of this world has always fascinated the angel, and each creation of his Heavenly Father caused him a genuine admiration for the boundless imagination and thoroughness of realization. Take, for example, these orange-red leaves, whizzing past in a whimsical dance, falling softly on the cooling ground and covering it with a soft rustling cover. The perfection of the form, the wisdom of the idea, all resemble each other, and each of them is unique in its own way, not like the other leaves, even those that fall from the same tree. Although the same can be said about the main creation of God, about human — a creation that in its splendor and intricacy was many times greater than any work of the artist who had long left his studio, not forgetting to leave an order to the angels to honor and protect his main creation.
Dean felt himself blush harder and smiled as Castiel laughed happily. He swallowed thickly, shifting his hips in the seat, holding his breath as Castiel’s hand slipped even further. “You keep that up,” Dean whispered, glancing over again, “we’re never going to get back to my place.”
better without eyebrows. Though but I swear, he slept with his bedroom door locked until he was in his twenties. Whenever he stays at my place, I’m sure he locks the door and brings his own shampoo.”
Dean attempted to disguise just how much his body reacted to the way Castiel said his name, but judging from the way the doctor was smiling, he had been unsuccessful. Still, at least he hadn’t been a bumbling fool around the guy like he was yesterday; forgetting how to speak properly, and knocking into things. This was progress, right?
Still, he hadn’t been able to eat lunch and had drank more coffee than should’ve been humanly possible, and he spent twenty minutes perfectly lining up cheese slices to look like six pointed stars.
Dean sat up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes, slowly registering he wasn’t at home and had stayed the night at Cas’. The beeping wasn’t his alarm, or even his cell phone, it was Cas’ pager. And that meant there was an emergency.
"Great! Thanks, mom!" Jo called out over her shoulder as she dragged Dean in the direction of the back room. The back room of The Roadhouse was often used for private parties or small gatherings. It had a private entrance, a small kitchen area (staff only, but that had never stopped them from using it), and two bathrooms. Because the room was usually used for dance parties, the floor was kept clear of all furniture-- which wasn’t the greatest set up for TV watching.
“Hunky Texans, it’s the male version of Sexy Asian Beauty,” Benny corrected, his entire body moving with the controller as he went around a turn in the game. “It was either that or Balls of Steel or something.”
It took the two of them about ten minutes to look through all the boxes, to come up with two smaller boxes with board games in them. Aside from Monopoly, that was quickly taken out and put aside, there were only seven games in total. “You know, I have few good once at home that I doubt you guys have tried. My friend Charlie keeps bringing her old ones over to my house. I can go get them if you like?”
and yet, you dump her like she’s nothing. She spent the last few nights in my room crying her eyes out because she thinks you hate her. Now she’s hoping you’ll take her back if she promises to stop talking to me. How is her being friends with me any different than you and Castiel being friends? At least you know she won’t be sleeping with me!” Sam hissed before turning away.
“Um… Okay, call for x-ray, I want two view of his chest and abdomen, lets get one of that leg. Did he hit his head?” Dean glanced over and saw Jo and the nurse shaking her head. As far as they knew, no head trauma. Dean shook his head, “We can get a head CT afterwards, if we need one. I don’t think it’s necessary now. Let’s see if we can find out what we’re working with.”
“Yeah, I bet that’s what everyone is saying about me,” said Dean sarcastically before he remembered something. “Wait, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be in school?”
The first time the whole gang tried to hang out without Charlie, Dean had felt so bad she was being left out and had no one to hang out with that he caved and decided to call her. It wasn’t until Dean got her voicemail that Castiel told him Sam had been planning on taking her to a movie that night, which put Dean back to square one.
“Yeah, Dean, I really do. I can see myself growing old with him, you know? He makes me so fucking happy, happier than I’ve been in such a long time. And I just…” Sam shrugged and Dean nodded, understanding.
“In all the time I’ve known you, brother, I have never seen you run away from anything,” said Benny as he walked behind them. “Don’t start now.”
Clearly confused, the young nurse that had showed John to the room looked down to her tablet and then to the door number before asking, “Mister Winchester, is this not your son?”
It didn’t seem to matter to John that it had been obvious the body slam  wasn't accidental or the fact that Lucifer was on the same team as Dean: it was Dean’s fault. He ‘shouldn’t lose the ball just because someone lightly bumped into him’.
“Was there something you wanted or did you just come to annoy me?” Cas sighed, straightening the papers on his desk without giving them a glance.
into the school library, but Charlie, biggest nerd on the planet and Dean’s best friend, said the school library was tiny. So it had to be true. She also worked at his mom's shop.
Dean watched as Sam put his phone away and picked up his pen again before signing his name. What surprised Dean was that Sam didn't write his name on the sheet he was looking at earlier, but had gone to the one next to it. The younger boy glanced over the sheets one more time before slinging his backpack over his shoulder and starting off down the hall-- thankfully in the opposite direction.
After a lot of debating that school week, Dean came to the conclusion that he should be a good boyfriend and accompany Cas to Sam’s party. The only problem -- scratch that --
“Sam, it’s okay,” Castiel whispered, squeezing Sam’s hand tightly. Sam nodded, grateful, and released Cas’ hand to reach for the pink plastic water pitcher. Castiel nodded and Sam picked up an empty styrofoam cup, pouring himself half a glass to sip on.
He took his time peeling away the rest of Dean’s clothes, tasting and kissing every inch of skin he worked so hard to uncover. Dean shivered as Cas’ hands trailed down his chest, his sides, his thighs, leaving a trail of heat in their wake. By the time Dean was completely undressed, he was panting slightly, his skin on fire and his body aching for Cas’ touch.
From the level of sarcasm, the “Sure, whatever you say,” made it clear the bastard still didn’t believe him. “Just remember, it’s better to rip the bandages off quickly rather than dragging it out,” Cas added when he saw that Dean still looked slightly hesitant.
“My,” Dean’s voice cracked and came out higher pitched than he would’ve liked. He cleared his throat and tried again, “Mine’s closer.”
“I’m sorry. I haven’t seen any of them... I have read the books if that helps!” Castiel gave a small smile, clearly embarrassed.
A hand ran back through his hair gently. “Dean, we need to get you to the car. Do you think you can stand?” asked Castiel.
Dean leaned back, shivering as Castiel’s fingers dipped beneath the hem of his jeans, their eyes locked as he worked open Dean’s zipper. Castiel moved to the side to pull Dean’s jeans free and Dean shifted, his legs falling open slightly. Castiel’s eyes darkened and he crawled between them, pressing against the length of Dean’s body before finding his lips again.
As Gabriel and his family joined Anna on the floor, the only seat left was on the couch between Castiel, Claire, and Amelia. It was a tight fit, but since Claire was practically in Cas’ lap already, they made it work.
Dean clicked his tongue, looking around them until he spotted Castiel standing and surveying the next aisle from where they’d been, his brow furrowed in concentration. “You think so?”
Dean ended up having to half drag Castiel away from the table and Castiel kept looking back at the dirty dishes left there, all the while asking if Dean was sure he didn’t want any help cleaning up.
“Claire,” he said softly, waiting until she looked up and met his eyes. From the expression on Castiel’s face, Dean knew she was either crying or was close to it. “That wasn’t fair to your mom. You know that’s not what she’s saying.”
Well, that was a big ass lie if Dean ever told one. For all Dean knew, they were planning something against
“But I-” with a sigh Dean looked over the tables in search for Castiel one more time before picking up the tray and making his way over to the booth in the back. The booth looked empty from where Dean stood and he didn’t notice anyone sitting there until he was standing right next to it.
As Castiel felt Dean grow more and more aroused by his petting, and hearing his moans, which Dean could no longer restrain, Castiel admired his face, which expressed the highest pleasure, and suddenly realized that he was caressing both himself and Dean with one hand. A few more movements, and they both came almost simultaneously, and their cum mixed in Cas' hand, spilling profusely over his graceful fingers...
The younger hunter carefully picked up the oblong box containing the treasure he had brought — the archangel's feather. He snapped two small locks on the side of the box, opened it, and handed it to the wizard. The latter looked at the feather with fascination and took it in his hands with awe, looking at it with an admiring glance.
But just as Sam set the items on the smooth, polished surface, there was a sharp thud from under the next table, and the muffled voice of the senior hunter.
— Good morning to you, too, Dean, — she said softly. — I'll get you some coffee. You don't mind, do you?
— Dean! — the angel interrupted his discursive tirade, squeezing his forearm soothingly. — Wait, let me say something.
He propped himself up on his hands so that he could get a good look at Cas' quivering cock before fulfilling his audacious plan. The large pink head, glistening with precum, the slight curve of the shaft to the abdomen, the expressively visible veins, the short thick hairs at the base, the tense scrotum —everything seemed so perfect that only an impatient sigh from Castiel brought Dean out of the trance into which he had begun to fall, admiring the masculine beauty of his lover.
— What would you like to get as a birthday present, Cas? — he asked. — There's no way to escape this, it's people's tradition to give presents to the birthday boy.
— Phew, damn! I thought I was dead, — Sam uttered, trying to catch his breath. — Thank you, Cas! If it wasn't for you... There was something... something that set the house on fire in a matter of seconds before I even noticed!
— As I can understand from the look on your faces, I got the nature of the problem you've come to solve clearly, — she said in her usual melodious voice. — So let's discuss it over dinner in a more cozy atmosphere.
— We did it, Cas,— came Dean's voice, hoarse with fatigue. — They are so cool ... your wings are just a fly...
— Well, I'm used to it, — with a grin, he drew his combat knife from the sheath at his belt and slashed his palm with a trained motion. Heavy crimson drops clattered on the bottom of the bowl.
— Well, or you could have... — Dean made an eloquent gesture with a table knife, striking the merchant's imaginary neck, winking at his brother as he did so.
— Dammit, Sam, just wait! — there was an indistinct noise, a couple of low curses, and the sound of something falling.
— That's right, and it's also a poisonous plant that can cause quite nasty burns, — Sam added, saluting with his mug, — and you're welcome.
— I don't want to slow down, — he heard Castiel's throaty voice in reply. — It's not what I waited so long. I want you, Dean Winchester, I want you now, — and his fingers gripped the collar of Dean's shirt firmly, pulling him back to himself unhesitatingly. In an instant, his strong hands turned Dean on his back, gently but insistently laid him on the bed, and the angel was suddenly on top of him, straddling the hunter's thighs.
— No! — Dean suddenly cried out, catching Castiel's wrist, who gave a start of surprise. — No. Like hell I want to forget it.
Such as the ones now, at that very moment, turned around behind him, sparkling with blue lights of spreading grace. Huge and beautiful in their primordial power, these wings were even better and stronger than those he had before the fall, and not even a single battle scar remained on them. Startled, Castiel moved first one wing, then the other, and the sunlight shimmered on the glossy black and bluish feathers.
— Sometimes people are nice just because they're really nice. Although I wouldn't relax either until we figure out what's up.
Dean lowered his gaze for a split second and continued to stare at the stiff gray ribbon of the road running toward them. — I'm the one who gives Cas the present, so the soul necessary for the spell must be mine, too.
In fact, if to think of it, it was also the reason that at this very moment the angel was here, in an old but lovingly maintained car, purring and creaking in the rhythm of the soft music that sounded from the speakers. Castiel's gaze moved slowly to the driver, and a smile touched his lips again, smoothing out the fine wrinkles on them.
The hunter was standing next to his bed, furtively brushing off an old pair of home jeans on his knees. A fleeting, embarrassed smile flickered and faded on his tired face.
— Dammit, Sam! I can tell if someone likes my kisses or not! — Dean's voice was still hoarse from sleep, and he cleared his throat, sitting up straighter. — That's not the point...
With a puzzled twist of the mouth and a shrug of the shoulders, the younger brother carefully picked up the rag with two fingers, walked around the hood and got into the driver's seat, first throwing the filthy piece of cloth into the glove box. The Impala responded to the turn of the ignition key with the same stern silence that its owner had recently maintained. After the first attempt, Dean continued to work on the engine, hidden from his brother by the raised hood that glistened in the sun.
Hot flames roared and raged around, devouring the fragile walls, beams, and ceilings like a hungry predator that has reached its desired prey. The angel focused, searching for Sam in this fiery chaos.  He felt that from somewhere nearby — a tangle of pain, fear, and the persistent thirst for life of the strong-willed and stubborn Winchester led him like a bright beacon light. The angel was about to rush to  the corner of the house to help the hunter,  when he suddenly felt another presence behind him — not even a thought or a personality, but rather a lump of initial anger and aggression, embodied in a creature that he saw and recognized immediately when he turned to have a look it, just in time to avoid the swift attack. A ball of fire, burning somewhere at the level of his face, darted toward him with a menacing hiss. Dodging, Castiel stretched out his hand toward the red-hot sphere that had flown by inertia for some distance, apparently preparing for another throw, and did not allow it to move again.
His mom’s ringtone started ringing somewhere in the living room. “I’m willing to bet you that’s your grandmother calling. I’ll be right back,” his mom said as she got off the bed and slipped out of the room.
There was a beat of silence and then, "Umm, Coach? I think you forgot to say my name..." Sam called out, almost nervously if Dean didn’t know any better, which stopped John who was getting ready to argue with Coach Turner.
Charlie smiled, ripping the box back from Dean’s hands and tossing it onto the bedside table. She flopped on her side, facing Dean and reached for his hands. “Because, there’s only one thing left for us to do! We have to go on a mission, of course.”
Pain shot up his arm as soon as he had put little pressure on it and he looked down to see he’d been done up in a cast. He recalled being discharged early in the morning but he could hardly remember the trip home, just that Bobby and Ellen had showed up together to drive them. His mom had climbed into the backseat with him, supporting him during the ride and walking inside their house. Apparently they hadn’t made it all the way upstairs to his room.
“Is it that obvious that I’m stalling running into my mom?” Jo didn’t even answer that, all she did was raise one eyebrow. “She will take one look at me and know that something is wrong. Then when she founds out that I’m stuck with John as a teacher, she going to get really sad. I can’t stand it when my mom’s sad, Jo.”
Dean's eyebrows rose in surprise, not quite expecting much of a response. He wondered if Jo would know how many people the Medical Director allowed to call him by his first name… He cleared his throat, yet again. “Uh, allergies,” he said at Castiel’s pointed look. He gave a small smile and then started, “Alright, Cas-teel.” Dean winced as he slaughtered the pronunciation of the other man's name, and pushed full steam ahead for a quick recovery, “...
Dean was sure that he would not be as calm as Castiel was if someone had been digging up everything they could on him and showing it to the class. Castiel didn’t seemed all that bothered about it.
Cas stands and holds a hand out to Dean, pulls him up and wraps his arm around Dean's waist. They walk together back to the entrance to the trees.
with Claire. He laughed each time Sam stood up, secretly directing Claire to where Dean's battleships were behind his back as he pretended to get a drink, or go to the bathroom, or get more cookies.
shouting matches between John and Sam. With one last look over to Dean, who seemed to sink into his bed, John turned away and left the room, the nurse apologizing over her shoulder as she went after him.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean spoke through gritted teeth. “Me too. Don’t stop, baby. Don’t stop. Make us come.”
Everyone is gathered around, eagerly waiting. They all have their phones out, and Cas can see various faces peering back at them via Facetime—Kali and Leigha, Michael and Lilly, Anna and Fergus with Gavin and Sasha, Lucas and Meg and Ronald, and even Ellen's daughter Jo.
Dean was just about to round his last corner to go to the signup sheets when he saw Sam. He was standing in front of the board and had his pen poised over one of the papers there, but he wasn't writing anything.  He just stood there staring at it. Just as Sam was about to write something his phone started ringing and Dean watched him jump slightly before he put the pen down before he searched his jacket for the phone. When he finally found it he looked at the screen and his posture fell. He then quickly looked back between the board and the phone before Dean heard him clear his throat.
Dean has never moved through the hospital so fast. He wasn’t even aware he knew it this well, but his autopilot skills take him and Sam straight to the emergency room and, after snarking at a nurse who didn’t recognise his name among the hospital staff, straight to Ellen’s bedside. She’s looking pale and tired, fully dressed with her leg propped up on a pillow, and Bobby sitting at her side sipping coffee and wearing his usual irritable scowl, which deepens when he sets eyes on Dean.
“Oh, thank god, yes!” moaned Dean as he took the first sip of the black elixir of life, everything else just faded into the background. “Wait, what did you just say?” he tried to ask but Claire was already gone.
“I had nothing to do with what happened, I swear!” yelled Sam, getting off his bed to get closer to her. She immediately threw up a hand and he stopped, his shoulders slumping in defeat. “I’m not going to lie, I don’t like Dean, but I never wanted him to get injured. And ever since you and Dean got into that fight after the party? I’ve been trying to- to be nicer, for
Charlie smiled and reached over to squeeze his arm, knowing that Dean was not usually one to talk about
They made quick work of re-writing Dean’s essay in the library, Charlie having spent Dean’s gym period pulling up resources and making an outline for him. It was probably a lot better now since Charlie was a genius when it came to research and she had been able to find a bunch of useful information. It was just before six when Dean and Charlie finally made it out of school. It was raining, just as Dean thought. The rain wasn’t all that bad, but it looked like it had been raining for a while since some puddles had started to form on the streets, especially in the corners where the drains were blocked. If they hurried, they would hopefully make it to Dean’s without getting completely drenched.
"I'll get it!" Charlie jumped up from where she had been laying on the couch, scaring the crap out of Dean in the process (not that he would ever admit that).
“I ate it! Get your mind out of the gutter.” He gave Charlie a pointed look before turning back to the closet. “Aha, got you!” yelled Dean as he pulled the magazine far enough out so he could pick it up. “Hello, sexy!”
“That’s because I’m awesome and you’re welcome, old man,” said Dean with a smirk on his face before heading to the work area.
“It’s my pleasure,” Dean answered back, winking at Castiel. He followed the other man’s directions to where he wanted the tree set up, and together they set about getting it in place. Dean held the tree as Castiel laid down on the floor and began to screw the tree into place.
“Nothing,” Dean answered quickly, smiling wider. By the expression on Charlie’s face, it only made him look constipated.
As he picked up his meds, the doorbell rang. Hoping the sound hadn’t woken up his mom, Dean called out, “I’m coming,” before walking back towards the front door.
After he hung up the phone, Cas didn’t know what to do. John would, without a doubt, cause a scene if he showed up to the hospital. Especially if Castiel and Gabriel were the ones saying he couldn’t go in and see Dean. But that was another thing, why would John even
“I can talk to Sam tomorrow at work,” Dean replied. “Sometimes we go see Ellen, but I think she’s visiting Jo this year. She got an apartment near her college, so they’re going to do a mother daughter bonding thing.”
Nothing happened! Do you guys really believe that if I had something on him that I wouldn’t have used it already?
If the thirty messages that Dean got from her over the rest of the weekend were any indication, she probably was. It didn’t mean that Dean was ready to forgive her anytime soon though. “I don’t care. She can go crying to Sam for all I care.”
Hey guys! Sorry this chapter is a week late! We had a last minute change of plans when the scheduled person was unable to complete their chapter. I picked up the reins and tried to get this out as soon as possible! I hope my last minute penning did the story justice :)
After getting the keys and a quick change of clothes, since there was no chance in hell he was sitting down on the leather seats in his dirty work clothes, Dean thanked Bobby again and said his goodbyes.
“You mean about you liking boys or you liking me?” asked Castiel with a grin on his face that Dean wanted to hide from. Even though he was ninety-nine percent sure that Castiel liked him too, Dean was kind of hoping to disappear right about now.
“Don't sweat it doc.” Dean had a twinkle in his eye and a grin on his face. “She’ll make someone a fine wife one day, but it definitely won't be me.”
Dean huffed loudly. “It still sucked,” said Dean quietly as he cast a glance at Bobby. Something in that look told Bobby that he was forgiven.
The three other shared a looked before Jo cleared her throat and said, “I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Dean is right, sorry.”
“Hey, Bobby!” called Dean when he opened the door to the garage. The small area that was used as the reception was empty so Dean put his backpack behind the counter and made his way to Bobby’s office. “Bobby, you in here?” he asked when he knocked on the door before opening it without waiting for an answer.
“I agree.” Dean grinned as he ran his hands down Castiel’s back, resting them just above the swell of his ass. Dean’s grin turned into a smirk as he tightened his hold on Castiel and rolled them.
“I could be… convinced to spend the night,” Dean answered back. Castiel chuckled and answered him with a kiss.
“Thank you, I was about to say the same thing about you,” answered Castiel, even though his eyes never left Dean’s. “You ready to go?”
“What’s taking so long?” asked Casiel for the tenth time as he walked back and forth in the hospital waiting room.
“Need help?” Dean asked, moving up to the side of the tree. Pine needles rained down on him as the man jumped, dropping the tree so it fell back against the wooden stand with a dull sounding
“No more than the fact that Jo has books about it. My family is pretty religious, so we have more than enough books about demons and angels. I spent a lot of time looking through them as a child,” explained Castiel.
“You’re sure we are going the right way?” asked Dean as he took another turn that he was sure would take them deeper into the forest. By now, they were about an hour outside of town, somewhere lost, at least in Dean’s opinion, in a forest. He had almost asked, “Sam didn’t ask you to bring me here to kill me, did he?” when Castiel told him to take the turn that would take them off the main road and onto a road in-between the trees.
was wanted there. But a few months ago, Dean never could’ve imagined Sam inviting him anywhere. No matter what!
Benny patted Dean on the back and both boys took a deep breath before walking through the doors into the gym. Thankfully, it was still empty, so they went and found a seat on the benches while they waited for class to begin. Jo joined them five minutes later and then the rest of the class came in one by one. The last ones to show up were Alistair and Lucifer, who made a beeline towards Dean the moment they located him. He didn’t know if he was relieved or not when they stopped halfway because John had just showed up.
Cas moved with ease around the kitchen, like he belonged there and had spent a lot of time there. Dean could almost smell cinnamon and clove and turkey and potatoes - everything for his fantasy holiday dinner - and he could even hear the sounds of family gathered around the table, sweet sounds of children laughing as they chase each other around the living room. Woah, where did that all come from?
Dean smiled back at him and shook his head. “Well, lucky for you, Sam and I just did this last week. Lead the way!”
True to his words, Castiel came straight after school and stayed until dark, when his step mom called him and told him to get home right away or there would be ‘hell to pay’. According to the text Casiel had gotten from Gabriel earlier that day, Naomi had been livid when the police contacted her and told her that Lucifer had been suspended from school for a week and that the police would be looking into his involvement in Dean's assault. In true Lucifer fashion, his step brother claimed to be blissfully innocent. Then he told their parents that they should ask Castiel what happened, he was Dean’s boyfriend after all.
“Well,” Sam dropped his hand and shrugged off her snub, “I think Miss Hanscum keeps giving me the most difficult assignment on purpose, just so she can give me a bad grade.”
With a quick look at his mom, Dean saw how she went from being confused to compassionate. As he looked back down, his mom reached under his cheek and lifted his head so he would look at her. “Dean, I’m sure if he gets to know you, he’ll like you back. And if he’s not gay, you can still be friends. I mean you still talk to Benny even though you had a crush on him when you first met him.”
Breathlessly, Dean broke off the kiss and smiled at Cas. “So, tell me more about your family.” He said, and they spent a long time, just sitting there and talking about their families, completely ignoring the movie, and randomly making out. Dean had always loved cuddling and kissing just for the fun of it and that romantic side of him was currently in heaven.
“She’s nine,” Castiel answered, nodding his approval at the tree. Dean, however, could see the large bald spot in the back and shook his head, shoving it back into line.
“Well, he said he was going to leave you alone if I helped him. So, I did. I didn’t plan on starting to like him,” answered Charlie.
Dean turned instead of giving his brother an answer and walked towards the front door. They’d already refilled the empty spots with fresh pines, and Dean had pulled two aside that he thought would work well for Castiel’s family celebration. At the end of the parking lot, just beneath the streetlamp, Dean saw a man approaching.
He’s pulled into front room and Cas pushed the door closed, Dean’s back against it and Cas kisses him again.
. On his knees in front of them is Dean. In his left hand is a ring, in his right, is a sign that reads
Before he could walk away, he was suddenly shoved against his locker with Sam inches away from his face.
Before he could make up his mind, a knock on the door sounded moments before Mary, Bobby, and a police officer walked in.
Dean snorted as Claire dragged the last word out. God, he knew that feeling. “Your dad sounds like my Uncle Bobby,” he said with a soft laugh. “No matter what, that old son of a --” Dean coughed and glanced at Cas, “he, uh, always got me to talk about the ooey gooey stuff.”
After sending a small nod in Benny’s direction, Dean turned his attention towards the girls. “Turns out Castiel isn’t related to Lucifer after all, not by blood at least. Apparently, Cas’s dad married Lucifer’s mom when Cas was little,” he said trying to change the subject.
me, smartass,” he said with an eye roll. “That’s me and my mom. It’s the last photo we took together.”
it was Sam Winchester-- and never talk to him again. Which was probably exactly  what Sam wanted to happen. Sam would never want to be caught alive hanging out with the ‘geek squad’. Well, two could play that game.
“Well, first things first… once we pick out the perfect tree, you’re going to want to let it drink for at least twenty-four hours. The branches will come down and fan out a bit, and the tree will thank you. Don’t listen to that fad about adding sugar to the water or any of that, just plain ol’ tap water and the tree will be happy as a pig in sh—” he cut himself off, coughing a little, but if Castiel’s smirk was anything to go by, he knew exactly what Dean was about to say.
A few of the dads suggested celebrating by going out for pizza, their treat and everything. All of the other boys had jumped at the chance, but Dean hadn’t felt like celebrating anymore. Even though his mom kept pressuring him to join his team, he opted out, wanting to go home with her instead.
Lucifer had picked Castiel up that morning, having convinced his brother to help repaint the coffee lounge, and Cas had texted they were on their way back. It was a rare Saturday night when neither one of them was on call; the moment Cas had gotten into his brother’s car, Dean started planning.
, because you never needed me in the first place!” said Charlie with a glare, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. “You're way too smart to need help, Sam. I’m not stupid. I think you only did this to get back at Dean.”
“Cas, I.. I want you so bad, I have since I saw you in that hospital bed, grouchy and stubborn. But, but, you are off limits -”
With the basket packed, he went to the downstairs linen closet and pulled out an oversized beach blanket, figuring it would work well enough. He packed both in the backseat of the Impala, then sank down onto the couch, kicking his feet up on the coffee table to wait.
“Did you just say that John is the one who is going to be in charge off all of the athletic programs? There must be something we can do to get you out of that. I can call the school tomor—”
It wasn’t long after the car stopped that hands grabbed him and dragged him out of the car. Before Dean even got his footing, someone kicked him in the back of the knee, bringing Dean down. Dean didn’t know if it was better that the wet mud greeted him instead of a hard ground. All he knew was that he was wearing the new jeans his mom had just bought him to try to cheer him up were most likely ruined. It didn’t help that he knew she’d spent way more than they could afford on them.
I'm so very much sorry for keeping you all waiting! Hopefully this chapter will be worth the wait, since the wonderful lotrspnfangirl has looked it (and past chapters) over and fixed it for me. I don't know what I would do with out her.
“It’s alright, I like it!” When Cas had pulled to a stop in front of the house, Dean got his stuff and got out, but before he closed the door, he turned back to Castiel. “Thanks for the ride and for trying to show interested.”
“The Novaks are pretty amazing guys,” Dean said softly, looking up as the bedroom door opened a crack, Castiel poking his head in. Dean waved him over, scooting back to one side of the bed since he’d migrated towards the middle.
“At least he read the books!” Charlie shot back. “But that is fine. Dean just has to make Castiel watch all the movies with him. Right, Dean?”
Storming away, Charlie didn’t know whether she should be glad or disappointed that Sam didn’t even try to stop or follow her. As she walked down the stairs, the person she least wanted to see rounded the corner to take the stairs. John Winchester did a double take as he noticed her, before shaking his head. He seemed
“Yes, I would love some. Your baking is very good. Thank you, Mrs. Win--” Castiel seemed to have forgotten for a moment that Dean’s mom never became Mrs. Winchester. Since he was Sam best friend, Dean figured that he must know the real Mrs. Winchester.
“And you’re the one fucking mine. However, I’m not the one doing the fucking most of the time,” said Dean with a smirk before putting out his arm. “Dean. I have heard a lot about you.”
“Tell me Dean, are you okay with this? Because I am going to devour every inch of you, and I need you to tell me if you want this.”
Somehow, Dean had managed to keep his little date with Castiel a secret from everyone else. How that was even possible was beyond him. Not only were his friends the nosiest people he knew, but Dean struggled with wanting to scream it from the rooftops because,
“I was at home. I got home around five and started on the essay Mrs. Hanscum gave us yesterday.” At the mention of Mrs. Hanscum Officer Kontos rubbed his ring finger and Sam saw the faint lines after a ring there. He couldn’t help but remember the rumors that went around school about Mrs. Hanscum’s divorce last year.
to be on a friendly terms with Sam, he just couldn’t believe that Sam would ever allow it to happen. And if,
Cas blinked at him. "I… I don't know? I guess… maybe a muffin? More than a bean, but definitely not a horse."
After Sam agreed to meet her the next day she ran out of the library. Sam waited at the table for a few more minutes, slowly zipping up his backpack before standing up and walking out the back entrance of the school. Lucifer and Alistair were both there waiting for him.
thought Dean, but he decided to keep that little bit of information to himself for now. Castiel hadn’t actually asked him out yet, so there was no need to get his friends overly excited for something that potentially wouldn’t happen. Dean knew that Charlie would go insane with planning what he should wear, where they should go, what he should talk about, the moment she heard that Dean had a date. Hell, she would probably drag Jo down the rabbit hole with her! “It’s just two friends hanging out.”
Dean choked back a laugh at Sam's resulting groan, and Cas looked absolutely mortified. Just then Amelia came down with her hands over Claire's ears, and glared at them all the way to the coffee machine.
“Oh yeah,” Castiel grinned as placed his hands on Dean’s chest, supporting his weight as he started to gyrate on Dean’s thick cock, “much better.”
Dean felt his cock throb between them and he cleared his throat. “I was tested, after my last relationship. I’m clean.” He felt himself flush slightly, despite knowing how important the conversation was, it was never exactly easy to have.
The walk was invigorating. They passed kids shouting and laughing, building snowmen and snow forts.  An old guy wearing a bright red scarf with a snowblower waved as they passed, spraying a fountain of white over his lawn as he dug out his car. When they finally got back, Castiel’s neighbor was just finishing up shoveling the sidewalk in front of his yard, grumbling about snow days as he went inside. It gave Dean an idea.
"Grab the bacon?" Cas replied, picking up a large, towering platter of French toast. Gabriel breezed by them and grabbed maple syrup, butter, a shaker of powdered sugar, and a can of Christmas tree sprinkles. Dean shouldn't have been shocked - he'd seen the way the man decorated his cocoa the night before, and yet he raised a brow as he watched the man place the sprinkles and sugar in front of his own plate first.
Dean took a quick look to make sure there was nobody else on the nearby tables that could have ordered this, but all the tables nearby were empty. Casting a quick look behind him he saw his mom’s and Charlie’s heads peeking around the corner. Leave it to his mom to provide food for his non-date without even being asked. His mom had the courtesy to stop and go away when she saw Dean looking at them, Charlie did not. Thankfully his mom dragged Charlie away too after Charlie had shown no signs of stopping. The last thing Dean saw of them was a thumbs up from Charlie before she disappeared behind the corner.
Looking him once while the two brothers exchanges pleasantries, Dean couldn’t help but think he snagged the hotter Novak. Not that Lucifer wasn’t attractive, but Castiel with his big muscly arms, his bluer than blue eyes, and the things he could do with his...
"If you guys had been any louder, you could have probably woken the dead. I do have a question though. Which one of you is better with his mouth? Because we heard you both equally loudly."
”It’s probably nothing! Let’s just go. Why are you moving closer to it? Gabriel, come on! It’s noth— Oh  God, Dean!”
“Look, it’s not my place to tell you this but... I think you deserve some explanation why he said that. Just promise me not to say anything to anyone, especially Sam?”
Castiel put his hand beneath Dean’s chin and lifted it ever so gently. “Dean? Dean, can you open your eyes for me?”
“Shouldn’t we call someone and tell them to meet us at the hospital?” asked Gabriel from the driver's seat, putting the car into drive and backing out, back to the road.
“Dude, you can’t hold out on me now.” Smirking, Dean pushed his luck, “I mean, I could’ve gone a second round and I answered the phone instead.”
She turns to Dean and smacks him lightly on the arm as he studies her chart. “And while you’re at it, you can explain why the pair of you are suddenly turning up together. You haven’t been fighting, have you?” At Dean’s shake of his head and Sam’s stuttered protest, her eyes soften and she smiles. “Then you’ve made up then. That’s good. Nothing worse than fighting with family.” She rubs Dean’s arm encouragingly, looking up at him in that warm, familiar way of hers that makes him want to hug her and not let go. “You’ve done good, Dean. Don’t be a stranger to us. We want to be here for you.”
Castiel couldn't help but agree. He wanted to believe that his best friend could never do anything like this but saying Sam and Dean were on ‘bad terms’ was quite the understatement.
“I agree,” Castiel replied as he gently pushed Dean’s chest, causing him to fall back onto the bed. Dean pulled himself back, clearing his legs from the footboard, and sat back up. His eyes widened as he watched Castiel climb up onto the bed and over Dean’s legs, straddling his lap before wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders. He smiled down at him wickedly and asked, “So, what's on the agenda for this
“It’s, uh, new,” Dean answered honestly, giving a small shrug. He listened for a moment, still hearing the shower running, before looking back at his phone. “Really new. But it’s good.”
“No, we’re just going to finish our coffee,” he answered, dropping his card on top of the slip and waving away Castiel’s protest. “I got it,” Dean said, meeting Castiel’s eyes and giving him a warm smile. “You can pay at our next date.”
Sam nodded his head slowly, finally seeming to wake up as he ran his hands back through his hair. "If Dean had ever done that," he said with a small laugh, shaking his head."
“Fuck,” Dean swore, groaning as he pushed up onto his arms. He looked down at Castiel, shaking his head. “I left the chair in front of the counter, too. I had it out so Ry could help me make breakfast this morning.”
“But, he takes it to the extreme. I had been so against him going to medical school at first… there are just some people you can’t please, no matter what you do, just as there’s some people you can’t save. I knew that Dean would take each and every one of those situations as a personal failure, and it would eventually break him apart.”
Sam interrupts him with a hiss, “But I am! You being around, that’s what I need. Do it for me, Dean, so I can move on.”
Castiel stepped inside first, Dean pressing in behind him. He’d just finished kicking of his shoes when a guy he’d never seen before walked around into the hall. At least he could be reassured he had never given Luc an awkward prostate exam...
If school ended an hour ago then he must have slept longer than he thought. Which meant he was late getting home.
“I’m sorry I didn’t stop him sooner. I learned some time ago that I shouldn’t be ashamed of who I am or who my family is, so I didn’t see the point in stopping him. I didn’t think about how it might affect you if he started talking about Sam and his family. Are you alright, Dean?” asked Castiel.
After taking her phone away from her and turning it off, Mr. Devereaux turned to the rest of the class. “How many times do I have to say this! The government can track your every move if you have your phone on all the time. Now, since you obviously didn’t learn anything last time, lets go over this again. Since everyone in here is stupid enough to be on social media, log into at least one of them and-- ”
With one hand on her hip, she dragged out his name as she made sure to hold the plate out of his reach.
Castiel hummed, wrapping an arm around Dean and sinking them both back into the pillows. Dean shifted to he was laying against Castiel’s chest, the other man running his hand up and down his back.
“Well, I didn’t know that until John called yelling at me for ‘screwing you up’,” Mary interrupted him and Dean started to realize that maybe she wasn’t just angry at him. After all, if anyone could get under Mary’s skin it was John.
Dean wasn’t sure if it was the doctor or the big brother in him, but he didn’t fully relax until Luc’s laughter was heard coming from the kitchen followed by Sam telling him to shut up.
Walking into the Winchester's house felt surreal to Dean; he’d spent countless hours growing up imagining what the inside of the house looked like. Turned out his imagination was spot on in most cases. Everything inside was straight out of a interior magazine: big fireplace, designer chairs, paintings on the walls that cost more than Dean wanted to venture a guess at, and all the newest technology. Even with a party in full swing, Dean could tell that the house was usually kept spotless.
“You think that’s what you want, but you’ll figure out that I’m poison, Sam,” Dean whispers, eyes downcast.
“You don’t have to do this, you know. I can have Mom kick him out if you want,” offered Jo as she got some soda cans out of the fridge for their new guests.
going to his grandparent’s house, the part about him helping was a slight exaggeration of him handing her her jacket and suitcase with a hug after listening to his parents fight for hours on end the night before. No one needed to know the suitcase was always packed and ready to go, that his mom took off often after one of their fights.
“Okay, that’s not random at all,” said Jo at the same time Charlie asked, “What is it with this town and dads?”
Suddenly Sam sat straight up again and said, “But you just came back!” loudly enough for the librarian to shush him. With his eyes closed, Sam took a deep breath before saying, “Do you know when you will be back this time?”
Dean glanced up to see Castiel watching him and he smiled, leaning forward. “Ready to get out of here?” Dean asked as Castiel finished off his coffee and nodded, sliding his trench coat on as he stood. Dean laid his hand on Castiel’s lower back, leading him out of the diner and back to the car. He opened Castiel’s door before moving around to slide into the driver’s seat.
Since the living room hadn’t been furnished with so many people in mind, there wasn’t enough space for everyone on the couches. Michael had been quick to claim seats for him and his wife “as his right as the oldest” which turned into a “That’s my seat” debate before Anna gave up to sit on a blanket on the floor with her kids.
Sam’s mind continued to go at warp speed. There was no doubt in his mind that his 'friends’ were behind this. What the fuck had those assholes been thinking? Sure, he and Dean had pushed each other around a few times, but never so bad that they had to go to the hospital because of it.
“Then why are you leaving?” Dean whined as he gripped Cas around the waist in order to try to keep him in bed. Yes, whined because the clock was seven in the freaking morning and he hadn’t had his coffee yet. And now Cas was making it worse by leaving him in this big, cold bed all by himself.
After what felt like forever, his mom finally said, “Maybe it’s better that you found out right away, before something happened. Wait!” Mary paused, an eyebrow raised, “
“I wanted to see you,” Dean replied, hoping to placate Jo, while also drawing her away from the thorny subject of their brother.
He waited until Charlie sat back and had crossed her arms. Satisfied, Sam continued, “I need a tutor for the class
“Let me worry about Sam. Can we please just try? Because I’m a pretty good judge of character, and even though I haven’t known you long, I know we’re going to get along.”
“I don’t think there anything we can do,” interrupted Dean. “I mean, you have met principal Crowley, you can’t reason with him. You’d most likely end up making some kind of deal with Crowley that we couldn’t get out of. Besides, John has been trying to get that job for years. He’s not going to give it up without a fight.” Dean shrugged, looking down at his hands folded in his lap. “It could be worse. I’m only stuck with him for two months, not forever.”
He steps back out into the crisp evening air and gets a few feet down the parking lot to the trees when he spots Sam at the entrance. Cas squints at the man as he gets closer—is he holding a sign?
“Explain what?” Cas asked, grabbing the first two hangers. In the back of his mind, he hoped they matched.
Dean leaned up against the nearest wall and typed what he wanted to say on his phone. When he was sure Charlie was watching him, he made a show of hitting a button on his phone. After that, he crossed his arms and raised one eyebrow towards her with a cocky smile on his face. Two seconds later her phone pinged. When Dean looked down again, Ash and Benny had already replied to his message.
“Attention everyone! Today, I want you all to prove to me that you really belong in this class.” Dean tried not to grimace at the rough tone John used or let it show that the man’s voice made his stomach clench. “I believe some people are more deserving to be here than others.”
Startled awake by the crash, Castiel flailed, scattering his papers all across the floor and knocking over the tray they were sitting on, his red pen falling somewhere beneath the hospital bed.
“Oh, and I just found out from Ms. Hanscum that she backed out from entering a contest with me that might get her a scholarship because she feels like she’s betraying you, which is absurd,” Sam added, turning back around. “So, congratulations, Losechester! You just fucked over one of your best friends.” Without giving Dean anytime to defend himself, Sam spun on his heel and left the cafeteria.
“I think you mean the two underwear models,” said Benny joining in, since they all knew from experience that it would get a rise out of Charlie. Charlie could get quite protective over things she cared about - real or fictional.
Hours later,the front door closed behind him and Dean sighed, his shoulder slumping against it. He felt like he missed out on something big, something that could have been big - something more. Cas was, well, Cas was everything. He was smart, sweet, funny - everything that Dean wasn’t, and more. Yet, Dean could see himself with Cas for the long haul. He could see himself settling down and making Cas his family. He wanted to try.
Dean didn’t know what to do. Sam’s friends had brought him to the woods just outside of town, but between his injuries and the pain in his arm, he wasn’t sure he’d make it back to town on his own. Plus, he had no idea where he even was or what direction he should go. They’d driven here, so there should be a road somewhere nearby, but he couldn’t see it through the trees from where he sat. With some difficulty, he managed to dig his phone out of his pocket only to find the screen broken and unresponsive. It must have either smashed when he hit the ground, or when they had been hitting and kicking him.
“Ever since my brother passed,” Castiel started, giving Dean a knowing nod when he opened his mouth to speak, “we’ve taken turns hosting the holidays, a Christmas and Hanukkah mashup, between the four remaining siblings. This year, it’s my turn. It’s… actually my first-time hosting, and my niece made a point in telling me that I better have a ‘real tree’.”
His mom was quiet for a while, looking at the cast on his arm. “Want to talk about what happened?” she asked eventually.
Meal times with the Novak-Crowley family was unlike anything Dean or Sam had ever been a part of. It was clear from the start that the siblings were all close, Michael and Lucas arguing respectfully over nearly
even know how you feel about Sam. You want to hate him, but for some reason you can’t. And that’s what’s got you so turned around. Sure, you don’t trust him, and you’ve got good reasons for it, but… Dean, you don’t hate him.” Charlie gave a small shrug and glanced over at him before shoving her shoulder into his. “And you should have trusted me, Dean. You’re my best friend. Do you really think I would betray you or something? I was trying to help you, jerk.”
At that moment, Dean’s stomach decided to do all the talking for him and answered Castiel loud and clear. With a sheepish smile, Dean took the key out of the ignition before turning back towards Castiel. “I just need to sneak these back inside. Meet you at your car?”
"No! It's rude to invite someone and then not let them in. Especially when we have already cancelled our plan to be here," Sam said before pushing Castiel ahead of him inside.
He went over to Cas’ side of the bed and tried to shake him awake, receiving a loud grumble in response. Obviously he was not a morning person. This wouldn’t do - they had to go, like 10 minutes ago. So, Dean leaned over Cas and kissed him. Hard.
This staring went on for much longer than would be considered normal - Castiel knew that much - and he could practically feel the atmosphere around them crackling with… something. He swallowed thickly, noting that his breathing had become shallow.
Castiel nodded his head, smiling softly. "I was happy about that, though not surprised. Dean, and Sam, too, have a way of just... charming their way in. They're both phenomenal men, and I'm glad to have them both in my life."
