Cas huffs a laugh and then plants a gentle kiss on his forehead. “Well, this dick of a hunter keeps disrupting his plans and is making him believe in free will, so maybe he’ll get what he wants.”
*****
I hope you can still remember the previous chapters that got us here...
“I wanted to, I just-”
Cas turns away to retrieve the flask of oil on the bedside table. He coats his fingers and explains, “When I said that I control your pleasure, I meant that you are not allowed to give yourself pleasure unless it is at my command. If you are to have an orgasm, I will be the one to give it to you. If I decide you shouldn’t have one, you won’t. No exceptions. Understood?”
“So you were there with Cas?”
“I’m not surprised by that,” Cas replies. “You should know what it means before you do.”
“Then why, Cas? Why are you touching me?”
A short, slightly older man approaches when all of the others have offered their congratulations. He hugs Cas with fatherly intent and enthusiasm, and then turns and does the same for Dean. His touch sets something off in Dean’s mind. Without needing to be told, he understands that this is the creator, the being who he has always thought of as God.
“Everything stops immediately.”
“Shove your apologies up your ass, Castiel.” It would have been a much more convincing statement if he hadn’t been wheezing from the exertions.
As soon as the touch of Dean’s skin connects, Cas sags in relief. He’s not himself; he knows he’s not. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know what’s wrong or how to fix it. Maybe he’s coming down with something. They’ve been traveling on several forms of public transit, and they’ve been exposed to thousands of people in their several destinations. It’s entirely possible.
Without another word, Dean sets a beer down in front of Sam and wanders back to the living room. They don’t talk about the huge hulking elephant in the room until the pizza arrives and they’ve demolished most of it. When Dean settles back into his chair, Sam finally broaches the subject.
Blue fire catches his eye, looking down at him with pure adoration. Dean’s heart thuds out of rhythm to see how much Cas wants him, how much he loves him.
Oh, and they can't seem to stay away from each other.
Cas reappears but stays silent. Dean catches his eye and gives a grateful smile.
Cas is interested, until they reach the bed. Seeing the pillows that still hold their shape from the head that laid on them that morning makes him ill Even with a willing partner practically humping his leg, he only wants Dean.
“So he would have come to that observation on his own?”
“Like what?”
Cas quirks a smile while he flips the pages. “Funny, that’s what I thought when I saw it. Look at the title of this paper, though.”
Dean lets his hands fall to his side. Resignation and disgust season his words as he shoves past Castiel. “Nothing. Forget it. It was my mistake.”
“I didn’t know you needed my permission.”
“Pull your cock out of yourself, pet, or you’re about to be double penetrated,” his Dom warns. There’s a second where time slows down. Their eyes lock and they both freeze.
He turns around then and erases the space between them. “Was Michael there when I was drugged?”
“That’s between us. If you’d like to know, I suggest you ask him.”
A good mile or more from where he lives, Cas finally feels ready to be around the teeming humanity of a bar. He’ll probably get a drink, wallow in self-pity when he sees everyone around him paired up or in comfortable groups, and then he’ll walk back home alone. It’s a safe prediction because it won’t be the first time it’s come to pass. It is the first time in this particular bar, though.
“That’s just one way. There are many ways for us to bond.”
Dean slowly eases down to his knees, hands clasped behind him, head bowed.
Cas licks his lips and fights the grin. “You’re a total sap, you know.”
This time, he doesn’t argue. Cas watches him wind his way through the crowd before he turns to Dean. He untangles himself and steps out of the slanted embrace.
The only response is in his bruising fingertips, which makes Dean smile.
Cas raises his brow in interest as he moves his exploration to the rows of suckers underneath the thickest part of Dean’s tentacle. When he makes solid contact with one, it flattens enough to build pressure between it and his skin. The suction is mild, but it’s apparent, and as soon as one latches on, others cling to him like the antithesis of falling dominoes.
“Please.”
“I know. I know, sweetheart. I was terrified that I would have to live the rest of my life without you.”
Dean remains quiet except for the occasional gasp and recitation of Cas’s name. He feels the chill air on the entire front of his body, but he’d do anything for Cas. If Cas wants him vulnerable, he’ll give it to him. If he decides he wants Dean to be the strong, capable fighter, he’ll do that, too. If he could crack his chest open and give Cas his heart, he would. It belongs to him anyway.
Looking into the front of the café, Dean sees the tail leaning against the pillar of the entryway. He leans his phone out into the aisle without moving his body. When he’s sure he has a good view, he takes a picture and hands the phone to Jimmy.
Cas finishes his question with his lips brushing Dean’s. Fuck. Dean can’t pretend to be unaffected by this man. He’s too sexy, too dominant, too perfect.
Dean nods with a beatific smile, like he won a wonderful bet. “Good. That’s real good.”
Dozens of men are milling around the open foyer, raucous Russian voices booming over each other as they chat. As soon as Castiel is noticed, cries of his name and welcome interrupt the flow of conversation. Taking their turns, all of the council members approach Cas and welcome him home personally. When their eyes move over Dean curiously, Cas formally introduces them. If they offer their hands, Dean takes them with an aggressively firm handshake.
“How will I know when we’re ‘playing’?”
Comment, comment, comment. My happiness depends on it.
He has to fight his way through the increasing crowd of admirers, but he finally makes it to Cas’s side. Thankfully, Cas seems relieved to see him.
“Yes,” Dean says somberly. Alexei disappointed him, but he understands why he kept the truth from him. He remembers several times over the past few weeks where the man tried to cheer him up and give him hope. He sees now that he was hinting at the truth, hoping that Dean would pick up the hints. He had been too devastated to even look up from his place at the bottom, though. He couldn’t even lift his head high enough to think that there was another fate in store for him.
Castiel shrugs, eyes lowered as he takes a step closer. Dean tries to contain the twitch of muscles that looks too much like a flinch. He lifts his eyes again. “I’m just curious why such a...”
“I want to fuck you against those windows with nothing between us and the outside world but that crystal-clear glass. Still okay with it?”
“I’ll bet you can guess,” Cas challenges. Dean loves this playful side of Castiel. He’s only seen it when they are alone, which makes it all the sweeter.
His first task is to help Cas disrobe. He’s been looking forward to this. He still hasn’t found the piercing that Cas mentioned, so there’s really only one place it could be, and he’s chomping at the bit to get his hands on it. Cas shrugs off the kimono-style silky robe, letting it drop into Dean’s hands. Over his shoulder, Cas catches his eye and then nods. Dean slides his hands down Cas’s sides, taking the black silk with them. When he bends, his face is mere millimeters from the angel’s ample, muscular ass. It takes everything in Dean not to bite it. Sucking in a breath, he reasons, “Not here. Not now.”
Dean’s eyes contain so much hurt that Cas has to fix it. He can’t let him stew like he wanted to. “But looking back, I see how much better my life is now. You made the right choice, I think, because now we are together, and I’ve never been this happy.”
Dean’s cheeks pink up a little at being caught mooning over his boyfriend. Sam’s eyebrows hit his hairline in response. “Holy shit, Dean. You’re blushing? Who is this guy?”
Temptation. Dean’s temptation is Castiel. He wants everything about the man. Friendship, intimacy, sex. He had thought that after last night they were finally on the same page. He shakes his head. He can only seem to think from his own perspective.
“The more intensely we feel things, the more confused our bodies get, and sometimes we react in ways we don’t expect. You just have to allow yourself to deal with it in whatever way you need to.”
“A little. Just wasn’t expecting it.”
Cas quirks a smile at the visuals that are racing in his head. “Sharing a life together? Building a family? Supporting him and loving him for the rest of our lives?”
“No, I have no reason to leave.” Such a simple statement, but it bolsters Cas’s crumbling foundation.
“How did that happen?” Sam asks in disbelief.
“I’m sure, but I want you to be desperate for me when I start fucking you, Cas.” Dean captures his mouth again, not giving him the opportunity to argue. With every withdrawal for breath, he sucks on those lush, pillowy lips. Cas leans into the touch, sighing every time Dean licks.
“Cas, oh god. Fuck, amazing.”
“No, I’m at my parents’ house.”
“Come closer,” Dean asks sweetly. With another step, he can finally reach Cas’s perfect cock. He licks the sticky drop from the slit slowly, letting Cas get a good look at it on his tongue. When he hears the broken sound echo in the small booth, he swallows it down.
He is unceremoniously dragged to his feet, one soldier at each arm, and then pinned to the cart by his neck. The snake-like commander hisses his displeasure as he tightens his grip. Another man steps up and swings his musket at Dean’s abdomen like a club. He would have doubled over, but the reptilian grip holds him firm. Air is scarce now, both his lungs and windpipe deserting him. It is the work of a minute for darkness to pull him under again. He wonders if it will be for the last time.
Cas steps closer, taking Dean’s right hand in his. As he speaks, he slides the ring off of his finger and switches it to his left hand.
Cas’s initial thought is to wave it off as nothing and distract Dean from the topic. He doesn’t want to come into Dean’s home and take over. But, this is something that he really wants, and he lives here, too. A few months ago, he would have dismissed the idea immediately, not believing that he deserves to have something good like this. Now, his thinking is much healthier. It’s not perfect, but it’s enough that he feels comfortable asking Dean for what he wants.
Dean has sent him two texts, one replying to his original, the other, asking him to meet him at the warehouse that he just got the keys to. Fuck. That was why he was going to Dean’s place to begin with.
Welcome back, dear readers!!!
They jump and scatter. Alexander, the marshal, and a contingent of guards arrive at the same time.
Dean hums his approval. His hand strokes over his groin, showing Cas a very clear outline that confirms Dean had lied about his size. Cas feels a ghost caress over his own cock, want digging its claws into his soft belly. He manages to hold back a whimper, but just barely.
“Since you are here, you must come meet the queen.”
Cas smiles at the replay of his words from last night. He lifts his hand and places it in Dean’s. Dean laces their fingers together before continuing his cleaning. Slowly, Cas lets his thumb stroke over Dean’s wrist and down to his palm, a gentle caress to reciprocate this sweet gesture.
“He do this often?”
Her eyes take on a dangerous gleam. “He promised to stay with us until the end of Beltane.”
“Oh, stop being so dramatic. Dean might be pissed right now, but I’ve never seen two people more sickeningly in love than you two. You’ll grovel for a while and he’ll take you back.”
Cas stands, too, holding up placating hands. “I wasn’t supposed to be in the building. I told them that I couldn’t be involved, that I wouldn’t jeopardize what we have.”
Dean retrieves it and is back before Cas can fully remove his pants. Since they’ve been dating, Dean has only seen boxers on Cas a handful of times, so it doesn’t surprise him that Cas is going commando now.
“Cas?” he sounds into the room. Suspicions confirmed. “God dammit.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There is silence for so long that he thinks Cas has gone back into the bathroom. His eyes drift shut just as she lets out a pathetic whimper. He can just about see her lower lip sticking out just from the sound.
Dean tugs on his hand to get him to walk beside him along the water line. “He’s protective, but he’s fair. He might ask you about some of what’s in your record, but he won’t make unfair assumptions.”
Cas continues his harsh pace, exerting himself with tremendous force and fervor. He is touching every inch of skin he can, splaying one hand over Dean’s chest while the other goes to his cock. Dean pants, his breath forced out of his lungs before he can make use of it. Dean cracks his eyes open, the blown pupils and glassy eyes somehow filled with emotion that is too much for Cas’s heart. He loves this man, cherishes him; can’t get enough of him.
With that, Cas turns and heads back to the house.
“Yes, master,” he sighs, flexing his muscles to offset the pleasurable sting.
“Others?”
“Absolutely anything.”
“He is a soldier, not a house servant.”
“Wouldn’t it be safer if no one knows?”
“Maybe. If so, it reads, “DD DMS. Does that mean anything?”
Sam looks back to Dean for clarification, but he just lifts his brows like a shrug.
Claire squints at him. “Okay, two things. Is your friend a priest?”
Dean feels insanely satisfied at how that command sounded coming from Cas’s lips. He hurries to follow, just barely getting his jeans pulled up and zipped before leaving the cover of the cabana. His shirt is still in his hand and he steps into his work boots, leaving them unlaced for now.
“Dean,” he moans right next his ear, his desire overwhelming him. His hips are stuttering out of that perfect pounding rhythm.
“See? Reggie didn’t know the shower was taken. He knows now. It’s all good.” Dean offers a hand down to Reggie while keeping his eyes up and alert.
“I’m not tired.”
Cas can’t get enough of this view. Watching the plump, round muscles of Dean’s ass squeeze around his cock is mesmerizing. Hypnotized by the sight, he is taken by surprise when Dean speaks again.
The bullet stops his forward momentum, changes every part of the equation. Boyar staggers and clutches his abdomen. He falls awkwardly, groaning and crying out in distress. Dean watches just to be sure that he isn’t able to get up, and then he runs to Cas’s side. He doesn’t feel remorse for shooting a man or joy at ending his stalker’s career; he only wants to see Cas.
An unappreciated giggle bursts from her lips. “Oh, you adorable creature. This is a simple misunderstanding. To the Fae, sex and fertility are the same. When we say he needs sex, we mean that he needs to be fertilized.”
Her sigh is quiet, but he hears it, even before he turns on the speaker phone so he can cook and talk at the same time. “Why won’t you let me come help?”
*****
“I’ll tell you what. You’ll get fucked.”
He sighs. “I know. I just thought that having this immense knowledge would be all I needed to do this job.”
“I love how eager you are, Dean. You wear your emotions so openly with me, which I treasure.”
“No, um. The rest would be more personal, though. I don’t think I should…”
“He was on school grounds and because I wasn’t a student and I wasn’t family, I wasn’t allowed to see him.” Dean’s eyes fill as he speaks, the pain of that day as fresh as five years ago. Sam has insinuated it’s because he won’t deal with his grief, but Dean knows that it’s because it is  the worst thing he could ever imagine happening.
“Dean, don’t. Not right now,” he pleads. Cas is drowning in the thick scent of his alpha; his lust and sweat making it thicker and richer. He is breathing in the intoxicating blend, wishing that he could get his mouth on his husband.
They wander in and out of shops on their way back to the inn where Cas is staying. He entertains Dean with stories of his time in Elizabethan London.
Instead, Dean clears his throat and changes the subject. “Are you coming down for dinner on Friday?”
“Yeah, you did, but that’s okay. I needed to hear it, and I think you needed to say it.”
Dean frowns. “What do you mean?”
“Spanking?” Dean seems annoyed by that thought.
Sweat drips from his brow, his body trembles from the exertion. “Please, please, please bring me back to him,” he whispers. He refuses to fail now. Leaning his head to the book, he tries once again. When one of his tears slips the edge of his eye and splashes onto the cover, the book jerks to life. A hum louder than he ever remembers hearing buzzes through his body while his eyes are dappled by the glittering lights.
On Dean’s desk are several framed photos, which is what Cas gravitates to first. The oldest one is of a much younger Winchester family, including a toddler version of Dean holding an infant. In the next picture, a teenaged Dean and a younger boy have their arms thrown over each other’s shoulders, giddy smiles cover their faces. Cas knows who it must be.
Cas shushes him and kisses his temple. “It’s okay, baby. You don’t have to. I did this to us. I’ll be the one to walk away.”
Alastair starts to babble as Cas moves. It’s all nonsense pleading, and it is completely ignored. The stringy, gray hair is caught in his fist and yanked at a straining angle. When the glint of steel catches the man’s eye, he tries to struggle away. Cas shakes him like a misbehaving dog. “Be still! Open up and let me see that vile tongue of yours.”
“And wouldn’t that be a terrible shame,” Cas teases, sitting up into Dean’s space and giving him a smacking kiss before reaching for his ass with greedy hands. The swell of his ass is pure poetry and Cas will be damned if he doesn’t enjoy every second it’s in his grip.
He lifts a brow and Dean amends his title. “I mean, master.”
The Harvelles had been ecstatic to see him, despite his waterlogged state of undress. Over time, he realized that they had been his sole champions, practically forcing the sheriff to look into his disappearance. Everyone else in town had assumed that he either left under cover of night, or had met some tragic fate. Although they had packed up his belongings and put them in storage after the first month, they held out hope that he would return.
Dean quirks a lop-sided smile, but looks down.
Dean smiles lazy and sweet, whispering, “Mulțumesc.”
“The Obshchak, Luka, is also a Krushnik? Is that a common name like Smith in America?”
“I can’t believe you would do something so reckless. You could have been killed!”
“Hmm?”
Laying on his stomach and resting on his elbows, Dean is joyfully camped out with no plans other than to take his time. Cas has one hand gripped in his own hair, eyes closed, lips parted, and he is letting the most delightful sounds drift down to Dean whenever he plunges his fingers deeper into Cas’s loose hole. He wants to use his tongue too, but he’s fairly certain that Cas is already at his limit for new sensations. He isn’t even sure he’s going to get his cock inside of him tonight.
“What is it about me that screams meek and mild, Cas?”
Lust visibly overtakes Dean, just as Cas knew it would when he asserted dominance. His cocky golden boy spends his life taking care of everyone else. The pressure of his responsibilities must be overwhelming. It’s no wonder he drops into submission with such ease and relief.
“I think I might have found something.” That statement brings Cas in like a lure. The article is about the endangered status of the fisher cat, and a unique program in Yosemite that is drastically reducing the number of animals killed by vehicle strikes. The program observed that wildlife will use drainage culverts as access points to cross under the roads when available. They increased the number of these culverts throughout the park, especially in heavily travelled areas.
Vicious intent focuses on both the prisoner and his savior. Alastair plots carefully. Now that a member of the royal family is in his sights, his plan must be infallible. He will bide his time and observe the two men. Once he has found the way to inflict the deepest wound, the harshest pain, he will strike. They will both be sniveling at his feet for mercy that they will not receive. Visualizing their downfall has him hardening, and he adjusts himself not so subtly. He licks his lips as he fantasizes about their screams.
“Are you calling my assholery into question?” he grins.
“Son of a bitch,” he grouses looking around for another way in. He knows that Gabe lowered himself from the roof and went through an upper window, but Cole must have taken a different route. He isn’t sure why they didn’t think about the front entrance.
“Yeah, but what are we looking for? Is this part of your research, or is it a clue that we’re supposed to find?”
“But what are you asking for, Cas? What do you want from me?”
Jimmy is out on his back deck thinking when the call comes through. He doesn’t recognize the number, but normal telemarketing calls don’t extend this late in the evening. Answering the call, he is surprised to hear Dean’s voice.
Dean chuckles and forces a kiss to his temple. “C’mon. Maybe you’ll find the inside more to your liking.”
Dean staggers out into the kitchen the next morning, every movement and sound torturous. He hasn’t been this hungover since the SigEp end of year bash his Sophomore year.
“Why?”
She reaches out to brush light fingers down Dean’s back and then turns toward the house.
Turning his attention on Dean, he says, “You think of me as God, but that’s a little formal for family.”
*****
Dean complies, sliding smooth and silky until he bottoms out. “Christ, Cas,” Dean curses as his eyes roll back in his head.
Dean smiles at the snarky asshole comment. It’s so much like Cas that he actually feels a little tenderhearted at hearing it.
Dean has help getting out of the terrible situation his family has put him in. It looks like good things are in store for our boys.
Dean’s face flushes a happy pink as he traces the letters again and looks up in wonder. “This is healed already. When did you do this?”
“Yes, sir,” Dean grins.
Dean’s spine twists with the explosive release, ropes of come erupting with a pressure he’s never experienced. Satisfaction drapes him when he sees the evidence of his bliss covering Cas’s chest and abs; the droplets running down to pool together in his lap. Cas is still chasing his release, and Dean sees the signs that he is close.
As he releases his wings into this plane of existence, gasps of awe rise from the crowd. He lets a quirk of a smile touch his lips. He’s forgotten how enticing it can be to allow others to know his status. Every creature in this land will know a Seraph is among them within minutes. Fae do not fear many other beings, but angels are still rare and powerful beyond compare.
Meg recognizes Cas’s attempt to lighten the mood for all of them, so she plays her part of offended artist. “You come back and see me, gorgeous. I’d love to get my hands on you.”
Cas can’t stand the look of fear in his eyes. Dean is still terrified at the thought of Alastair coming for them. If this training wasn’t the only thing that seems to settle Dean’s nerves regarding a potential attack, he would have told his beloved to fuck right off several days ago. As it stands, he is willing to be thrown to the ground, choked, and pinned to a wall if it keeps Dean happy.
“No, Dean. I’m still so damned unsure where you’re concerned.”
“Here?”
“Oh shit,” he groans. “I’m going to come so hard. Cas, touch me, please.”
Meg doesn’t miss his sigh of relief. “Ready?”
“A car?”
Sitting back down at Castiel’s side allows him to relax. He knows that he’s being watched and judged, but he also knows that he’ll have time to get to know these men, and they will see his worth. He nudges his leg into Cas's, trying to offer him comfort. Mikhail has not only publicly made light of their relationship, called Cas a slut, and questioned his motives for choosing Dean; he's also tried to make Cas jealous. This is going to be the end of their friendship if he doesn't stop.
Dean complies without thought. He is able to get a good rhythm going between his hand and mouth, and he can hear the results in Cas’s erratic breathing. He absolutely loves hearing Cas lose control. There have been so few times, that each one seems magical, a treasure. He wants this one, and he ardently chases it.
His fingers sift over the metallic flight feathers and down into the fluff underneath. They feel different in the water, less individual, but he can still feel when they are laying right or not. The aphrodisiac buzz of coming into contact with them runs up his fingers and then higher into his arms. His breathing comes harsher and his erection is painful and throbbing.
The angel lets his wings fade into existence again as he rests along the length of Dean’s body, his chin propped on his wrists. “The idea excites me beyond reason.”
“I’m not finished.”
Cas leans back a little. “Doesn’t it?”
“Sorry, what?” he croaks. Dean leans up on his elbow and turns to face him as well as he can with Cas still buried balls-deep. His face goes soft with affection.
Dean takes pity on him. “Come on, let’s go sit out on the rocks. I have questions first.”
“Sir, I appreciate what you’re trying to do for me. I really do. Which is why I need to resign.”
“You don’t have to. Sleep, my love. I will keep you here with me.”
When he comes back to earth, he lays Cas out on the bed, sweetly touching every part of him. Stroking his thighs, kissing and kneading the flesh, he whispers, “I could have sworn that I could feel your thoughts just now.”
“I didn’t want to intrude on something private, Dean.”
“He’s really going away this time. He’s never going to bother you again.” Cas is feeling a little shocky from the surprising news, letting his thoughts bleed out of his mouth unfiltered.
Cas pulls Dean down to him, kissing him breathless. “I’m gonna come, baby.”
Cas’s brow is knit with concern, but he doesn’t push Dean for any information. Instead, looks to his guards for explanation.
Taking one of his hands in his, Cas turns it over and kisses the palm. “You are the most beautiful man I have ever seen, Dean. Over thousands of years, I have met millions of people, and none of them can compare to you.”
Dean lifts his brow at the wordy title, but adds words to his searches. After a few more iterations, Dean stops and lifts his hands from the screen.
“Is that why you’ve had your nose shoved up Krushnic’s ass for weeks?” The rat-like features curl up in a sneer.
He’s looking down at where Cas’s drooling dick is bobbing loosely against his. He nods his approval and Dean drips gathered saliva into his palm. When he squeezes them together, the slick friction feels fucking fantastic. “It’s a little gross, but effective,” Dean smirks.
Another surprise is that Dean apparently knows this police station really well. He leads Cas quickly down the hallway and around the corner to the Solicitor’s Room. When he closes the door behind them and throws the lock, Cas is on him. He slams Dean into the wall hard enough for the frosted glass in the door to rattle, holding him there by a forearm braced across his chest. A grunt is pushed out past his lips, and Dean makes a move to fight his hold. Cas leans in and grips his jaw tightly in the other hand.
“Um. Nice place.”
Cas licks his lips and tentatively asks, “Is that where we’re from?”
His earnestness makes Dean answer him honestly. “You’re already saving my life. I don’t want to take advantage of your generosity.”
Dean heals, they have a long-awaited talk...
“When you first brought me here, yes. I was terrified and angry, Dean. If you had told me that you wanted to befriend me, I would have been happy to get to know you.”
Dean’s relief is short-lived, however, because the end of the sentence, coupled with chuckles and blushing, worries him greatly.
When the professor final releases them, he speed walks through the halls and cuts through the Biology building to get to the library as quickly as possible. He even jogs part of the way. Who knew that delusions could make you follow through on your fitness goals?
“You don’t want that book? You were completely wrapped up in it 30 seconds ago.”
Dean opens his mouth to speak, but Cas shakes his head. “You will listen to everything I have to say, and then you may speak.” Dean wants to argue, but he wisely schools his features down to blank impassivity.
When he looks over at Cas, Boyar tries to pull his attention back. “He’s nothing. He’s not worth your time. You deserve so much more.”
He could have spent the holiday with his college friends who lived in Boston. Enough of them had migrated north from New York after graduation that they still have large gatherings. He could have taken any one of several offers to join the families of his coworkers. He could have knocked on the door across the hall from his apartment and hang out with his friend, Meg. He just couldn’t do it. Not again. Not this year.
“That’s all I want,” Dean interrupts. “I want to show you how good it feels. That’s all.”
Cas picks one and scrutinizes it. “Joe Walsh? You really get away with that?”
“Don’t worry, it isn’t anything expensive,” Dean jokes uneasily.
Dean turns to lay on his back. He’s pensive, thoughtful in a way that suggests he’s contemplating something important. “Yeah,” he smiles and then looks up at Cas. “I’m getting ink done today.”
Dean wants him to keep spanking. He wants the driving pain to come, again and again, until the nerve endings cross over into pleasure.
“Dean, who are you here with?”
“Don’t fret, my dear seraph. I do believe that you are on the verge of discovery.” He gives her a curt nod, but he doesn’t trust his words to be diplomatic at the moment.
*****
“I want you to come inside me, and I want you to plug me up so not a drop of it slips out. I want to keep it, baby.”
Instead, he’s left stewing in his bitter disappointment while he watches “Scrooged” with his mother, like they’ve done every year on Christmas Eve since he was deemed old enough to watch it. The Winchesters love tradition, and classic movies are one of his favorites. Since he’s been home, they’ve already watched “Christmas Vacation” and “Elf”, so this completes the trifecta for the season.
“Inside.”
“Because you promised the queen, you fool.”
Rolling to his side, Cas props his head on his hand, his eyes roaming over the gorgeous stretches of skin and muscle. Dean’s shoulders are pink, showcasing the light freckles there.
“She is wise, but in this case, I don’t agree with her. I don’t think she knows you well enough to make this decision.”
“Where’s my ring?”
Dean looks troubled, head hanging. “This is my fault.”
After Bart’s death, he was called before their council to answer for his actions. Based on his story and the previous complaint against Bart, they had let the matter go. They still wanted to discuss the matter with Cas, but Dean couldn’t get him out of the cave, let alone in front of a council leagues away underwater. Finally, one of the members agreed to come to them and have a more informal chat.
“Not to be disagreeable, but I feel like he has been staying quite out of the way. He only speaks to me of my apprenticeship when I ask his advice.”
But getting away when they’re supposed to be in the yard is tricky. He will need to call in a favor or two and get someone to run interference while they sneak back to their cell. It would be exponentially easier to wait, but one glimpse at the hungry way Dean is looking at him is enough to make any sacrifice worthwhile. Pulling away from him is painful, and Russian curses fall from his lips.
Good evening, my lovely readers.
“You sure? It’s a little…”
With a last lingering look, Cas shakes his head, “You’re fucking unreal.”
“No, I’m fine. I’ll only be hurt if you leave me.”
“But the letter from the prince said that he was being held here. After alerting the British Royal Navy to his whereabouts, they certainly wouldn’t have let him come to harm. Right?”
“So you just decided for me, like what I wanted didn’t matter.”
I'd love to hear from you before you move on to another world.
Breathless from the squeezing, Dean gasps, “You going to miss me, Benny?”
“I didn’t-”
This menu is even more overwhelming than the drinks. While he recognizes all of the words, he’s never seen them in these combinations: bamboo rice, crispy garlic, whipped yogurt, quail yolk, pickled cilantro, turmeric cream. He’s intrigued, but looks to Dean for assistance. They agree on steak tartar, yellowfin tataki, beer braised pork cheeks, and cognac mac & cheese with lobster. Each and every one of the appetizers is decadent and rich. It’s an embarrassment of riches if he’s ever seen one. After he’s had a bite of each dish, he has to admit, “This is a brilliant idea. I would have been so disappointed to have to choose just one thing on that menu.”
A text alert brings him out of his musing. “Speak of the devil,” he thinks fondly as he opens his phone.
“Oh god, Luke!”
Dean steps inside and sees his omega, his husband, wearing just the low-slung jeans. His chest is bare, as are his feet. His hair is disheveled from the steamy club and the dancing. Dean has never seen him look more beautiful.
“Me too.” One hand digs into Dean’s hair, the other slides around his shoulders for leverage.
Enjoy some lovely moments between Castiel and Dean before... well, I don't want to spoil anything.
Cas sets down a full basket of food and wine in front of him, courtesy of Meg. The woman is so thankful for Dean’s rescue that all Cas has to say is that he wants to do something nice for Dean, and she flies into action. She goes so overboard that they could strand themselves out here for days and still come home with plenty. Now that he thinks of it, that isn’t such a terrible idea.
Dean grabs Cas’s hand and moves it to his stomach and covers it with his own. “Or maybe that I want you to breed me, pump so much of your come into me that you can feel it distend my belly?”
Both men stare at each other in shock before Dean glances down at his chest and stomach to see the mess. “Did you -”
“Yes, Dean.”
Dean winks at him and heads for his small office. On the way, he corrals an errant basketball that has deflected from the backboard and shoots it. It swishes through the net with a satisfying sound, and a roar of heckling starts between the kids playing.
He knew they weren’t exactly quiet, but there’s no way that they caused that much of a spectacle, even if they had been completely caught up in each other. Cas leans his head back in exasperation. “How bad is it?”
“Will you come back here with me in the spring, Alpha?”
When Dean opens the door to his loft, he feels the deafening quiet like a weight. Just to fill the space with some white noise, he turns on his bluetooth speaker and selects a playlist at random. He breathes easier once the sound of guitars fills the room.
“You like to play chess, correct?”
With a grin, Dean interrupts, “I know, Cas. I know you wouldn’t do that. But, I’m just…overwhelmed by my good fortune.”
“Shit, that’s right. He’s a Seraph.”
They stay still, panting and sweaty while they come down from their respective highs. It is a moment that doesn’t need words, so none are offered. When Cas starts to pull out, Dean flinches. “Fuck, Cas. If I wasn’t bow-legged already, I would be now.”
Dean tilts his head, starting to piece together threads from the last months. “If Cas is destiny, then I’m …"
I've been consumed with writing this week, which makes me blissfully happy. I hope you enjoy the new little chapter. It's almost 4,000 words, so it's not tiny or anything.
“You will never touch me with such disrespect again. I am an angel, a heavenly being who has lived for countless centuries. I am a warrior with authority over legions, and I am the one who has saved you time and time again.”
“Cas!”
All around them, an alien light blooms. Dean doesn’t notice until he pulls back to breathe. His amazement at the bioluminescent glow catches Cas’s attention. Dragging their fingers along the surface of the water, microscopic explosions of neon blue follow in their wake.
Dean shakes his head, reaching out for his arm. “No, angel. You treat me like a king. You care for me even above yourself. It’s obvious that you love me.”
“Yes and No. I work alone, but there are others like me spread out across the world.”
“To me you were. We knew each other pretty well back then.”
When the slick tip of Dean’s other sex organ breaches his body, he chokes out a cry of pure pleasure around the flushed and glowing one in his mouth. It retreats out of his reach, cozying up with Cas’s very lonely cock.
“Cas thought that bending him over and trying to cram the schedule up his ass was a better solution,” Dean relays with a gleeful sparkle.
Dean leans in, determined to ignite the glowing embers that are always burning beneath the surface for this man. He takes a possessive kiss, only wishing that he could pull him in like he desperately wants to. Cas pulls away, breathless. He pulls Dean’s shirt up and over his head, tossing it away, which frees up so much firm, tan skin that he doesn’t know what to attack first.
Dean’s eyes widen in shock and confusion. He doesn’t ask. He instinctively knows better. Instead, he freezes.
“Why did you call?” Fragility creeps through the empty space between them.
A relieved cry escapes Cas when Dean becomes visible. He gathers him into his arms, the embrace crushing. Dean returns it with equal fervor. They stay in the circle of each other’s arms for long moments that become eternity. Cas would be content with never having to let go of him.
Cas sidles up close to him, speaking softly so that the others cannot overhear. “You know there are several things that I don’t mind you taking out on me, but your foul mood is not one of them.”
He kisses Dean’s temple as he relaxes his hold. “He underestimates me as well. I will not give in to him so easily.”
Cas tips his head up to meet Dean’s eye. “Let me be clear. I want to stay with you. Always. I don’t ever want to go back to the way my life was before.”
Once he gets a good rhythm, he can feel the burn of desire filling his cock, so he stops and takes a few breaths. Cas is staring at him in agony. Lust is a swirling inferno in his eyes. Dean lets the head pop out, but he guides it around his hole, kissing the soft ring with his leaking slit. Cas is breathing heavily, and his eyes meet Dean’s.
Breathless and floating with endorphins, Dean feels the strong pulsing of Cas’s cock. He hums his approval. He wishes that he could feel the warm splash of come filling him. It’s not possible, but he thinks it would be amazing to feel.
“Will you promise me to keep an open mind? Some things I want to discuss might sound a little personal, but I swear I have valid reasons that I’ll explain.”
Sam is about to follow when Dean returns. He sits down next to Sam on the couch and slaps a stack of papers down. One by one, he opens them and shows Sam what he’s found.
“Not particularly, no. Every event is a long, boring show of diplomacy and ceremony. God forbid I try to be myself.”
“Excellent.” Luke stands, heading for the door while tossing back a parting command. “Be in the Turkish Room at 7 o’clock. An ambassador for the Bishop of Constantinople will be here to finalize details for his grace’s visit next month.”
Cas is on the knife-edge of release, his lungs heaving, his brain frenetic with the imagery Dean is putting there. Through his sawing breath, he manages to gasp out, “Yes, that’s perfect. So hot. Fuck. I’m coming,” Cas hisses at the overwhelming wave that grips him and huffs out a shout of Dean’s name. Dean groans as Cas spills into him again. Dean watches it happen, greedy eyes taking in every detail of agony and ecstasy written on Cas’s body.
The implication is clear. Without Castiel, Dean will age and die just like any other human. The thought obviously pains him greatly.
“You are my version of perfect, Dean. I just hope I will be worthy of all of these sacrifices you’re making. I honestly had no idea you would be in so much pain.”
“Where is Dean?”
“Today? I know you will. One day soon? Maybe not. I pray that day will come.”
Questions berate him from every rational corner of his mind. What the hell is he thinking? Just this morning, he was desperate to be free of this man, this place. How could he be so easily seduced by a pretty face? Why would he give his virginity, his first sexual experience, to the man that kidnapped him? His heart races and his breathing goes uneven.
Uită-te la mine! and Regarde-moi! = Look at me!
“Because of your name or because you’re so pure and sweet?”
Dean shrugs his leather coat off and offers to hang up Cas’s as well. When he disappears into the closet, Cas peeks in. “This is almost as big as my room,” he scoffs.
Dean huffs a laugh. “We’re starting at the very beginning. Assume I know nothing.”
Gabe snorts and lights a cigarette. “You’ve been telling me how perfect Dean is for months, and you’re a fuck up. I assumed.”
“I’m well aware, Dean. I’ve sucked that fat cock many times.”
“I was setting the mood,” Cas replies, his eyes dropping low, too. “I was getting myself ready for you so that when you came through the door, you wouldn’t be able to resist me.”
The teasing humor shifts on a particularly forceful thrust, both of them shivering from the zing of pleasure.
He surfaces for another brief instant, just long enough to suck in oxygen that he resents needing. Down he dives again, using the force of his ire against fate to fuel him. He reaches lower by using his initial momentum to propel him, and then he grapples with the immovable walls to eek out every additional inch.
Dean is about to make a lewd comment, but sees Cas sink down to one knee. What the hell is going on? His breathing goes erratic, and his pulse quickens. Is this - Is Cas really doing this?
“Yeah, I wouldn’t miss it. Are you sure you want to cook for all of us?”
Dean doesn’t regret a single second of it, even if Cas is agitated the next morning because he’s now behind his deadline for the first time since the trip began. Considering how much Dean has given up to be on this whirlwind tour of the continent with him, he thinks Cas is being just a touch unreasonable.
“What’s wrong?”
Cas leans his chin on his hand, amazement evident on his face. “I can’t believe that there is an entire species that we know nothing about.”
Cas lets go of Dean’s hand to open his fly. He stands up to tug the jeans off and kneels back down on Dean’s lap. His thick cock is jutting up towards his stomach, and Dean wants to get his hands on it. He waits for Cas’s permission, which he gives with a nod.
“Uh, February 3rd.”
“So, what do you have in mind?”
“I’ve never been a fan of my last name. Apparently, it was my mother’s name, but I just never felt any connection with it.”
Dean pushes him back, “No, baby, you’re too big. It won’t work.”
“I thought you told him everything?”
“That’s ridiculous. Everyone leaves some kind of digital trail.”
Looking up, he sees Dean watching from the other side of the wall of windows with a pleased smile. Abandoning his torment of the girls, he joins the man who can melt him with that look.
Cas swallows hard. His mouth is suddenly Sahara dry. “Yes, but it scares the shit out of me.”
It isn’t until they are settled into a scalding bath and Dean can truly wrap himself around Cas that the tension starts to bleed out of him. Cas has his back to Dean’s front, and he feels completely at peace. Dean’s strong hands are moving over him, soothing and reverent. Cas knew that Dean would need time to reconnect tonight, to right the ship, so to speak. On their way back to their rooms, Cas had asked for food to be brought up after a bath, and that they not be disturbed for any reason after that.  Cas has plans for Dean.
“Correct, but a human staying in the Fae realm - any human - would be subject to slave status.”
Nuzzling into him, Dean sucks one of his testicles into his mouth and rolls it before letting it out with a pronounced pop. “I’m the lucky one, Cas.”
He turns at the sound of Dean’s voice, but only the sparkling, shimmering silver of his eyes is visible in the dark.
He will give Dean time. Time to wake up, time to acclimate to his position, time to get to know his new home and those who live there. Castiel hopes that someday they might be friends. When Cas looks up from his yoga practice, he catches the sleepy look of disdain glaring back. Apparently that day won't be today.
“You don’t make it easy,” Cas grumbles. “They’re my DNA results.”
“So are you locked up in your secure location, or can you come and go?”
“It’s a good thing that wood cleans.”
Turning back to each other, they descend into lust, passionately worshiping their partners’ bodies as if there would never be another opportunity. Hours pass with hardly any notice. They kiss and caress every inch of skin, jerk and suck each other’s cocks, and rub their bodies together in a continuous loop of orgasm and hardening again. All the while, the stimulating drops fall upon them like sweet rain.
*****
Dean chuckles from his place by the window overlooking the mountains. “No, not at all. I think it’s just this place. It’s awesome.”
A gutteral sound of torment punches out of Dean. “Fuck, yes. Please, Cas.”
Cas takes hold of Dean, gripping his hip and holding his chin. “Tomorrow.”
Judith and Cas celebrate his successful meeting with Bianca by taking high tea at the Four Seasons.
On the desk in front of them, Cas has a bunch of random items: a pencil, needles, thread, a bottle of ink. “What’s with the arts and crafts supplies?”
“No. No more than I did.”
Cas makes him lay down on his back with pillows propped under his hips and head before continuing. “I’m going to give you a massage while we talk, acceptable?”
“You’re amazed by how fast the bond is growing. You love me.” Dean’s eyes spring open in alarm. “Wait. Am I right? I can understand your thoughts?”
Cas scoffs. “No, you just buy entire city blocks.”
Meg tries to hand a stack of cash over to Cas, who looks at her with bafflement. “He paid upfront for the custom artwork and all of the sessions. This is your cut.”
Dean smiles in corroboration. Revenge can be sweet, even when someone else dishes it up.
Cas had been sketching him, asleep and posed, but in the most beautiful setting. There are tall columns on either side of him, a reflecting pool in front of him, and a breathtaking landscape of waterfalls cascading from rugged mountains behind him. Even in black and white, his eye can fill in vivid color where it should be.
“Didn’t you?”
He looks Cas over carefully before answering, “She and I don’t agree on the best way to proceed.”
Cas must tread carefully, push him to submit without ignoring any true objections. Cas continues to force his deep breathing with a hand pushing gently on his ribcage to guide him.
“His reputation is overshadowing you.”
“Yes, C-sir.”
“Permanent?” Cas can hear both the hesitation and the intrigue in his voice.
“It isn’t a wealthy title, and we have very little except land, but it has afforded some luxuries to my family that others are denied.”
Also, if you are interested in seeing the yoga poses, they are Parsva Bakasana then Eka Pada Koundinyasana I
Dean meets his eye, his lips pursed and plump. Cas shouldn’t be distracted by something so simple. He most definitely shouldn’t be getting hard while Dean is distraught over a man’s death, but it has been weeks of near constant work all without this gorgeous creature by his side. He’s only human.
“Love this. Perfect. So damned perfect. Fuck.” The huffs of breath being forced out of his body make Dean feel proud; powerful.
This entire event rankles. Among this group of ‘masters’, Cas finds not one that he has any respect for. They are all vile, predatory Fae.  Laughter and foul jokes erupt whenever the head of security, Theofanis, issues another order for them to pass along to their slaves. They boast of their rapes and abuse of the poor creatures that have found themselves choked by their cruel collars.
Cas sighs, sounding disinterested. “It’s one thing to pretend that you aren’t educated, Dean, but don’t act like I’m not. You recognized the Latin. I saw it in your eyes.”
“New Year’s Eve.”
“Dean…” Cas aches that Boyar can use Cas to hurt Dean. It’s just another way that he’s let him down.
The scratches are deep and long, but his blood barely trickles out before the wounds close. “Dean!” Cas calls through his panic.
“Oh, absolutely. I’ve wanted those perfect lips split open on my cock since the day we met.” Cas tries to peek over his shoulder at Dean but is caught immediately.
“And?”
“We probably should have just skipped breakfast, huh?”
Theofanis actually chuckles, which Dean sees as a decided victory. It’s the first show of humor since he fell behind the curtain.
Dean chuckles. “What was it?”
Sam Winchester looks up from the map, wide-eyed with anticipation. “Did you find him?”
Cas lets the physician bandage his broken wrist and re-set his dislocated shoulder, but then drags him back to his chambers. A steaming hot bath is waiting for him. The servants try to help bathe him, but Cas takes over and shoos them away. When it is just the two of them, Cas helps him out of the rest of the clothes that hadn’t been cut away to repair the damage. He helps him into the tub and Dean groans at the hot water, “It’s good to be king.”
When he’s all cried out, Dean kisses him on the head and suggests, “Let’s take our find and go back to the cabin. We may be way ahead of whoever is looking for you, but I don’t like taking unnecessary risks.”
One by one, they flop down on the furniture in the sitting area. They chatter for long minutes in the beautiful syllables of Romanian. Dean grinds his teeth because it is exasperating that they don’t even acknowledge he is in the room. None of them, even Castiel. If they want an invisible servant, he will be happy to oblige. He walks quietly away, well, as quietly as his bonds allow, hoping to escape to the little office area of the suite. Castiel notices and tracks his movements. Apparently, he isn’t the only one.
I would love to hear what you thought of the resolution of their huge obstacle. Comments are always answered, and mostly in a timely manner.
Begrudgingly, Bart hands it to him. The envelope has been opened, which Dean acknowledges. Bart looks away guiltily.
Cas jerks him up to lean against his chest and takes his swollen dick in hand, even as he continues the lascivious grind. “Everything about you is gorgeous, you know that? You have the prettiest cock I’ve ever seen.”
“It’s fine. What did you want to show me?”
Cas steps into his space, the tone of his voice exuding a rough air of authority, “Strip.”
“You need to what, Dean?”
On the way here, he was very careful to drive where he wouldn’t accidentally see any of the campus buildings - especially the Biochemistry building. He also refuses to go anywhere that they used to frequent. Of course, he quite slyly covered that up by asking his client to pick somewhere new so that he can see how the old town has changed. Dean never would have picked this place. It’s a mix of so many different cultures and styles that it actually misses having one at all. It’s visual and auditory chaos, and as scans the menu, he becomes certain that the food is going to prove similar.
Cas shushes him again. Dean has been babbling for a good ten minutes. He’s been teased with stopping and starting touches for quite a while. Cas alternates from light, tickling fingertip touches, to tight grips that just pop over the head. He twists, he rubs, he plays with his slit; but what he doesn’t do is follow a rhythm for more than a few strokes. Dean is sweating a little now, starting to shake. He’s not desperate yet, but Cas can sense that he will be soon.
“I didn’t.”
When the sun is setting, Cas is ready. Dean has a number of small oil lamps, and Cas lights them all, placing them strategically around the cave. The result is a beautiful golden glow in their home. He has taken care of dinner and left it near the fire to keep warm. He plans to have Dean feed it to him from his nimble tentacles. He also brought a flask of water out to the table for when their exertions leave them parched and in need of hydration.
To Cas, this is an acceptance that he’s been waiting for his whole life. He never knew his parents, or even who his father was, so to be embraced by this family is more than he ever dared hope.
Cas orders their drinks while Dean cleans up in the bathroom. He feels his presence before he appears. Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Dean sit on the stool very gingerly. He grins with smug pride.
(See the end of the chapter for
After a lifetime of inches, Dean finally feels his foot touch the back of the cart. He doesn’t feel any warmth from the sun, so it very well could be full dark by now. He isn’t sure how long he was out. Dark is perfect, though. He may not be able to see, but neither would his captors. Once he is away, he has the skills to find himself and stay alive until he reunites with his squad. Sam will be tearing his hair out when Dean doesn’t return with his small contingent of soldiers. His brother knows protocol, though. He will stay nearby, quietly waiting for Dean to return to them.
“I was out in the Canadian Rockies, taking pictures of the animals and how they’re affected by the pipeline in Alaska. I was gathering proof that we need to do more to preserve the through ways for migration, especially for the predatory species.”
“That's the one, Dean.”
Dean shoots a mortified look at the prince. “What exactly are you suggesting?”
Dean chokes on the prickling wave of lust that sweeps over him while watching his prince, his Cas, given over to pleasure. He is writhing on Dean’s lap, trembling and lost in the seismic waves.
Cas pouts playfully and gives a counterpoint thrust up into Dean. “Besides, I’ve had to keep my hands to myself for too many months. It’s not fair to ask me to continue.”
Dean shrugs. “Fine by me.”
“How do you have a surprise for me? You didn’t know I’d be here.”
Cas grins. “So, you make old rundown things fresh and new.”
Dean nods in agreement, still staring out over the water.
“Cas, don’t apologize. Everything is good. I’m just concerned because you seem so out of sorts.”
“I think I would let you fuck me…if you could complete a challenge first.”
When he emerges into the wild forest, his senses are more keen than ever before. His vision is hardly bothered by the night; the glorious full moon giving him enough light to hunt by. He can almost picture the trail his omega took through the trees, so vivid and tantalizing is his scent.
He shouldn’t feel such satisfaction at their scandalized expressions, but since he can’t do anything about the issue of accepted slavery, he’ll be damned if he doesn’t try to open their minds to men staying in committed relationships with each other.
“We still have another day. Do you really want to worry about the itinerary -”
Dean stops short and leans against the wall. Cas staggers back with him as the drunk soldier has a death grip on him. Dean’s head weaves as he tries to focus. “You’re beautiful, Cas.”
“Well, we’re friends, Cas.”
“Mom. We’re not dating anymore. He is my ex.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Dean. I don’t know how to draw.”
“Next time, we can paint each other,” Cas offers as rolls Dean to his back.
“And another thing. I know she’s the queen and she thinks she can say and do whatever she wants, but if she looks at me like I’m scum one more time…”
Dean’s breathing is tattered, eyes barely open. “Cas?”
They walk to the front of the building and around the corner. Cas points out his apartment on the third floor, but they keep walking. At the end of the block, an ancient diner sings its siren song of enticing smells. Butter, coffee, and salty bacon waft through the air. Before he swings the door open, Cas takes in the expression of desire on Dean’s face. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you so happy, Dean. I have to admit that I’m feeling a little inadequate.”
Cole grins at him. “I told you Dean wouldn’t leave you over this.”
Dean firmly adheres to the lessons he has received from his mentors. He locks away all emotion; his face and body wearing nothing but contemptuous nonchalance. His lips are pinned down, a slight snarl curling one edge of his lip. His eyes are cold, icy despite their warm color. In this place, when he is with these people, he isn’t Dean Winchester anymore. He is Kir Krushnic, Castiel’s one and only Novobranets.
Dean responds to his every plea with a litany of dissent. No, no, no. Cas’s heart is breaking to see him so distraught. He wants to rip the door off its hinges and carry him to safety.
“And yet you’re resisting,” Dean pushes with heaving breath and a sparkle of mischief.
“Where will you go when you get out?”
“I don’t know anything about motorcycles.”
“While we’re talking about what bothers us, will you share what made you so angry this morning?”
“Yes, oh god,” Dean sighs. “Fuck me, Cas.”
“Holy shit,” Dean laughs, delighted in the newly revealed gift. “Will we be able to do it when we’re not in the same time or place?”
Carefully cleaning the mud from Dean’s body, he is soothing himself with touch; reassuring himself that Dean is here, that he is whole. Cas enjoys the quiet while he bathes Dean. Once again, the marked differences between this man and the foppish prats at court are monumental. He does not have to fill the silence with Dean. He can just...be. He can think, breathe, and meditate. It is such a relief to be in his company. He never feels that he needs solitude if he is with Dean. Dean is his solitude.
Cas stands, statue-still, in the middle of the room. “You said Dean is in trouble,” he prompts when Sam isn’t forthcoming.
“Nothing,” he says too brightly. “I wanted to wish Cas a Merry Christmas.”
“Okay. For me, the amazing feeling I get when I drift off is worth the achy muscles and sore ass for a few days. Being fucked by you is worth a little discomfort later on.”
Kissing Dean’s fingers that are clutched like a lifeline in between his own, he replies,  “Yes, I absolutely did. I couldn’t wait another day.”
“So?”
“Cas,” Dean murmurs, disbelief and reverence in his voice.
He pronounces his name with three distinctive syllables, which makes Cas flinch internally. He can’t decide if it’s done more out of anger or disdain. He stands and, for the first time, looks John in the eye. “I appreciate you coming here, but I can’t afford your rates. You must know that.”
Cas looks disturbed by the thought. “No, I couldn’t have let you do that, Dean. I wouldn’t want you to throw away your career over my mistakes.”
When Cas wraps his perfect lips around the head of Dean’s cock, he thinks he sees heaven. Cas dips his tongue into the slit, lapping up Dean’s most potent flavor. He hums and murmurs, “You taste so sweet, malysh. I could drink you down all day.”
Cas smooths his hands over Dean’s shoulders, fingertips gripping over biceps and curling around his elbows. He gently guides his arms forward, toward the back to the couch. “Hold on tight, sweetheart.”
Dean chuckles and finally gets to his feet, shoving his own pants to the ground. His cock pops free, which Cas turns his head to watch. Dean has many amazing assets, but that beautiful cock is among his favorites.
“It’s quite something, isn’t it?”
“Of course,” he agrees as he looks over the board. Cas has been teaching him the finer points of the game, but he still lures him into traps more often than not.
Dean’s plans to go hunt for dinner are thrown out as soon as he hears soft snores coming from the tent. There’s no way in hell he’s going to leave Cas defenseless here in the woods while he’s out hunting. He’ll just grab some of the dried fruit and nuts for tonight.
Dean shakes him off and tries to gain some distance so he can breathe. Cas holds him firmly and scowls.
After a few reassuring touches, they settle back into the celebratory mood.
Burrowing his face into the side of Dean’s neck, he strokes them both to explosive, earth-moving climax. Dean comes first, Cas’s name tumbling from his lips as he tumbles over the edge. Cas holds Dean even tighter, squeezing his body against him. His cock pistoning in and out of Dean’s hole, he buries himself one last time and strains to get even deeper as he releases pulse after pulse of hot come into Dean.
“I love you more than anything, Dean,” Cas pants, eyes glowing blue as he approaches climax. The truth in his words pulls a whimper from Dean. It’s too raw, too pure of an emotion for him to wrestle with.
“I chose Kir for you because it means leader, just like Dean. It will be on all of your official documents, but I will still call you by your given name. It can be another nick name for all anyone needs to know. You can choose what you wish to be known by.”
“He was rubbing his hands all over himself,” Dean explains with disgust plain in his tone. “and giving me bedroom eyes. I thought I was going to lose my lunch.”
Cas hums in agreement. “It was spectacular. I imagine that it will get even better as our psychic connection gets stronger.”
‘That’s it, Dean. Let it all out,’ Cas thinks. ‘The sooner you run out of fire, the sooner I can have you listening again.’
Cas hums, and Dean starts to pick up the pace, crowding in behind him.
“You gave your word. You cannot break a promise to the Fae, little human.”
“Sounds heavenly.”
Cas smirks, but steps back. “I should only be an hour or two. You can wander. I doubt I’ll be in much danger in the castle.”
Confusion furrows Dean’s brow. “Why?”
“Thanks for taking care of him, Cas.”
It makes Dean grip the headboard more tightly. He hasn’t really had his hands on Cas all day, and the juxtaposition of being caressed so thoroughly while his hands are unable to do the same is taking its toll. Cas is using every bit of his skill to bring him to orgasm, rolling his hips and alternating the motion with dirty grinds, and it feels so fucking good that Dean can only release pitiful grunts and moans to accompany every heaving breath.
“I know, sweetheart. I’m sorry for poking at you.”
“Yes, it is, gorgeous, but this time felt a little like somnophilia, so I wanted to be sure.”
Dean remains passive as he lets Cas lick the honey away, even as lust surges into him. There is only so much stimulation he can handle, and just cataloging each sensation is more than he is capable of at the moment. He will stop Cas soon, knows that he must. But for now, he revels in the feeling. The prince’s mouth is hot, and he uses his tongue like a brush on canvas; varying firmness and breadth. It is dizzying.
Also, the weirdest thing happened today:
“Keep me from coming?”
“Mary is the most loving, sweet soul. She’s everything a mom should be.”
Cas watches Dean’s body tremble above him, losing the rhythm when he gets lost just at the edge of orgasm. Cas swiftly takes over, stroking Dean long and smooth, talking him over the edge. “That’s it, baby. I can’t wait to taste that sweetness. Let me have it.”
Dean contemplates what he says while Sam scarfs down half of his sandwich. He knows that he doesn’t have good relationship history, but now that he knows about Cas, it makes sense. If he has a soul mate that he’s been promised to, why would he ever need or want to be with anyone else? Sam finally breaks the silence with a typical little brother annoyance. “He must be really hot if you’re this goofy over him.”
The doors of the elevator open up in the middle of the apartment, which occupies the entire floor. Cas has seen enough of Moscow’s elite being awestruck by the view to know how special it is. They are facing Red Square and have a picturesque look down onto St. Basil’s Cathedral, which is a beloved icon of Russian culture.
Dean can’t help but get a little thrill out of seeing Castiel so flustered. It’s not a look he’s ever seen on the man. Never. Not once. A swell of pride accompanies the power that warms him. Yeah, that feels really fucking good.
The only Romanian is curvă puțin, which means 'little slut'.
“Do you treasure it enough to actually put your mouth on me?”
“As much as it pains me, yes. I’m afraid that’s exactly what I’m saying.” Cas doesn’t imagine the disappointment that crosses Dean’s face this time. He reaches a hand over to rest on his arm. “I don’t like it, either. I have a part to play in public, but nothing will change what we are behind closed doors.”
They both share a grin over that comment, until Dean adds, “I love you, Cas. I’m sorry that it took us being kidnapped from our regular lives to let myself think of you this way.”
Firm lips cut off his words. “Don’t be sorry. Just be certain.”
“If you continue strengthening the bond between us, you will need to keep it fed at frequent, consistent, intervals. Other than that, you will experience the changes that I warned you about before.”
“Cas,” he tries to reason with him, but Dean is completely out of vocabulary. He huffs his aggravation and points at the pile of garbage by the fire. Then he points to the blanket Cas is wrapped in. Then back to the pile of charred…
“But you didn’t know anything about me.”
“Shouldn’t I be asserting my own dominance around town? How are they going to respect me otherwise?”
Cas opens the door to a little cafe and gestures for him to enter. Dean looks around in horror. There are fussy linen table clothes on every table, porcelain tea pots, and doilies. The air smells of old lady and sugar.
“You thought I was that good of an actor?”
Dean’s eyes widen at the command. Cas has been nothing but fragile for weeks. Dean has been walking on eggshells, not knowing what is going to set him off. He has recognized a pattern to his comments lately. Cas has been focused on strength, weakness, being broken, and now fragile. Dean mentions it quietly to his friend, who looks up at him sadly. In their own tongue, she tells Dean, “You’re going to have to let him go. He has to repair his heart before he can give it to you.”
“We will definitely be using this today,” Cas says and takes the prostate massager out of the box. Dean lowers his gaze as mental images threaten to overwhelm him. “And this,” he says approvingly as he lets a length of silk rope slither down to coil next to the other items.
“Of course. What do you want to know?”
Dean’s smugness turns icy, but he doesn’t complain. “Good. I will take you on as a novobranets.”
“You will be attending the ceremony because to offer such an insult to the queen would completely negate our reason for staying. If you think to cross her, she will cut down everyone that you care about with a single thought. She will never let you leave. If that is what you want, by all means, skip the ceremony.”
Dean chuckles, “I don’t have a clue, Cas. No one ever has.”
Anger slips over his features. “What gap are you referring to?”
“A death was reported at a known crack den. It’s an abandoned building near the freeway. The woman had been dead for at least a day. I think the only reason it was reported was because there was an infant with her, and the baby was screaming.”
The jangle of chains accompanies the man on his way toward Dean. Vaguely, he can hear the other men talking over each other, laughing and competing for attention as they slouch into seats at the front of the car. Only his stalker is silent. Dean looks away, trying to break the electric connection. His eyes pop right back without his permission.
*****
“How do you feel right now?” Dean asks.
Cas takes a step forward then, aggression rolling off of him in palpable waves. “It would be in your best interests to let me work off some of this anger before confronting me. I’m barely keeping it together and despite what my brain is telling me right now, I really don’t want to hurt you.”
“Thanks, Dad,” is all he can manage. He’s too choked up for more.
He wants to turn around and scope out the reactions of the other bar patrons. South Boston is hardly the most gay-friendly place on the Eastern Seaboard, and he feels none too secure giving his back to the room. He will just have to trust Cas to head off any problems. That thought twists in his gut. He’ll be literally giving Cas his back soon; he had better get used to the idea. He walks on wobbly legs, but makes it into the hallway without incident.
His eyes go wide. “Holy shit. I didn’t even think about that, but you’re right.” He chuckles to think back over all of their trysts. “I think we might have a public sex kink in common.”
“That is the idea, isn’t it?”
“Excuse me, sir?”
Our. Bed.
Cas turns and gazes at Dean’s troubled face. He knows how difficult this has been for the hunter, but he must admit that he is looking forward to this time of getting to know Dean better. They have worked together for almost two years, but he feels like there is so much more to learn. Dean is the most complex human he has ever known. Having idle time away from the urgencies of heaven and earth will be good.
Despite his words stinging like a son of a bitch, he nods his acceptance and goes back out into the room. Cas is propped up against the headboard, but now he’s under the covers and reading a book. The domestic scene makes Dean's heart ache. He can picture this being his future, even though he admitted, just seconds before, that it will never come to pass. Despite that, he wants it; he would bleed for it. Instead of fighting for it, he relies on humor to deflect.
For the first time in days, Cas feels like he can breathe.
“How did he know about the gate behind the gardens?”
They emerge from the bathroom together behind a gust of steam and honey-scented soap. Dean pulls up short when he sees Gabe and another guy sitting in the living room playing a first-person shooter game from a scuffed up and sagging brown sofa. Cas bumps into him and scowls at his roommates.
“You’ll be good. I have faith.” The words are perfectly innocent, but the look on Cas’s face is anything but. Holy shit. The promise in his eyes is sin incarnate. When he tells Cas of his observation, he grins while his lips are still caressing the head of his cock. Cas confesses, “That’s only fair. You are my temptation.”
“Let’s fix that, shall we?” He pats the side of Dean’s leg and gets out of bed. “Would you like to go see your present?”
Dean chuckles. “Okay, that won’t come up in conversation much, you’re right. What if I forget?”
“What are we doing here, Cas?”
Cas knows this angle is hitting Dean’s prostate on every stroke; he knows for a fact that Dean isn’t going to last very long. He wants to feel that clenching, pulsing around his cock, needs it like it is the very air in his lungs.
“There’s beer and mustard. Can’t you make something out of that?” His irreverence just winds her up more. She smacks his head on the way past him to scoop up her purse.
“The minute we get back home, okay?” Dean pleads, his eyes softening in desire.
The alpha growls and bares his teeth until his omega ends the chase with his submission. Cas bears his neck to his mate, a thrill running through him.
Dean sucks in a harsh breath at the confession, and Cas lifts his head. “Chto ne tak?” (What’s wrong?)
Looking at the cool confidence on Cas’s face, the calculating stare in his piercing blue eyes, Dean’s heart does a little flip. He is most definitely the Authority here.
“You may heal, but only him,” he explains, gesturing to Dean. “You may fly, but only to his side. Your powers are restored, but only as they pertain to your human charge.”
Jimmy is silent for a moment and looks at the documents that Dean slides over. They are official searches that show the lack of records in his name on the county letterhead. He’s stymied. Did his parents never get a birth certificate for him? No. That’s impossible. He wouldn’t have been able to attend school or get a driver’s license without that documentation.
Cas is mesmerized by the beauty unfurling in front of him. Dean is climbing to truly dizzying heights. Finally, his body gives in and he comes with a sobbing shout. His cock kicks, his muscles contract, but it is a dry orgasm. Cas’s heart stutters in sympathy and yearning. He wants to feel this golden wave of pleasure from the inside.
“Why?” He drags the question out, his sense of unease creeping back to cover him like a blanket.
Dean nods his head slowly. “Sorry, Cas. You mentioned vessels and I realized that we’ve been having sex for weeks and I’d never given the guy a thought.”
Normally, their fucking is peppered with dirty talk. They both love adding commentary, whipping each other into a frenzy with their wishes and desires. This time, all of their words have been spoken. It is too urgent; they just need to feel. So they gasp, moan, and shout out broken syllables of each other’s names. Cas comes first, his head tossed back in bliss. Dean leans down to kiss and suck along the length of his neck, nipping at the tendons straining as his body seizes up in orgasm.
Dean swallows around the lump in his throat. “Wha-what did you have in mind?”
“I know. But that’s not even the half of it. This is the most inefficient way of traveling I’ve ever seen. That one dude, the one with green and purple hair, is in charge of this disaster, and there is no method to how he does anything.”
“What is it?”
Turning slowly, he expects to see anger in his blue eyes, but instead finds hurt. Before Dean can apologize, Cas asks, “Have I ever given you any reason to think that I didn’t care about you above all others?”
Dean complies with stuttering movements. Once he touches, confidence slowly returns. He lifts the edge of his shirt as his fingers caress the skin there. He pushes it up farther, on the next pass, letting little glimpses of his firm abs show. He sees the flickering desire on Cas’s face when he licks his lips. Dean’s glad that he isn’t the only one affected.
Instead, he seems to be handling everything with grace and confidence.  Looking beneath the surface, though, she notices subtle little tells. Cas soaks up every kind word with gratitude, appreciates everything offered to him with genuine amazement.
“Dean,” Cas pleads, holding him at arm’s length so he can’t be pulled close again. Dean’s growl of frustration makes him chuckle. “Stop, sweetheart. Listen to me. I want you, too, in the worst way, but there are precautions we must take first.”
“Dean, just stay away from them for a few days. See how you do without them. Okay?”
Watching Dean free-fall through his orgasm and crash into the waves is breathtaking. Cas almost forgets to keep chasing his own climax. Dean’s muscles are milking his cock, though, which is more than enough reminder. He slows his pace, savoring the gripping, pulsing squeeze around him. His own orgasm sneaks up on him, ripping through him with a sharp shout. “Fuck, Dean.”
Coffee is his only fuel this morning, but it was so worth it. He grins around his cup as he thinks back to the night before. He hasn’t been able to focus solely on Cas’s pleasure like that in a long time. His dominant, and very strong, boyfriend typically turns the tide on him after a few minutes. Last night, though, Dean pleaded with him to lie back and just let Dean give to him.
“He’s no more a puppy than I am, Mikhail.”
Castiel kisses her deep, slow and satisfying. As he stokes her fire, he removes layer after layer of clothing. He would give anything to live in the tropics, he decides. One simple layer of clothing and he would have his prize. Once they are both unwrapped, he flips their positions so that she is straddling his lap. His skilled hands alternate between kneading her breasts, pinching her ruby pebbled nipples more intensely, and then soothing them with feathery touches. Her hips are already arching into him, guttural moans wrenching from her throat, and he hasn’t even gotten his mouth on her yet. He forgot how vocal this woman could be with the right motivation. A wicked idea strikes him. Since Dean won’t join them, he’ll endeavor to give him the show of a lifetime.
“What’s your plan when that door shuts, Dean?”
Dean clenches his jaw at his pronunciation. He bastardizes it into the word ‘brat’ instead of the rolling, broad Russian tones. Glaring at Billy, he scoffs, “You think that little prick scares me?”
Dean is inside the backseat of his Impala before there’s time to think. Looking around frantically, Dean asks, “Where’s Sam?”
Dean is pleading with his eyes, but he can’t make words form. He wants to pull his feet from Cas’s hold. He wants to straddle him and grind in his lap. He is bewildered and looking for an anchor.
Cas shouts and renews his barrage of physical and verbal assault. “You disgust me. Your touch makes my skin crawl. I will never willingly let you have any part of me.”
It isn’t long before Dean is doing his own thrusts in reverse. For a man who has never been fucked, he absolutely has the perfect rhythm. His narrow hips roll, his knees widen, and he keens for more. Of course, his face is a vibrant shade of magenta, and he doesn’t look back in Cas’s direction, but Cas is happy to get this much response from him. In fact, he is practically salivating at the thought of getting his cock inside this man. His hands are trembling and his breathing is ragged.
Dean sniffs and nods, meeting his eye finally. “It made me think, though, about how much can change in an instant. If I had lost you, I would have regretted so much, Cas.”
He finally pulls back, licking away any come that escaped. “What does that mean?”
When he touches it, the twisting fall is much more severe than it ever has been before. If he’d been prepared for the intensity, he might have braced himself. As it is, he staggers when his feet hit the marbled floor and he collides with one of the towering columns. His disorientation on this trip is worse than usual, too. Leaning heavily into the column that caught his weight, he breathes through the dizzying nausea.
“Enjoy it,” Cas directs at Dean. “It is one of the best restaurants in the city.”
“I-uh didn’t get his name. He hit on me, though.”
“Okay, I’ll call you as soon as I have the skinny.”
If you notice, this story is now officially part of a series.
InvictaAnimi and BeesAreAwesome
“You’re too much of a coward to kill me in front of a cell block full of witnesses,” he challenges.
“So you let him suffer?” is asked between clenched jaws, just inches from his face. His grip must tighten, because the color of Alexei’s face is heading toward purple. Struggling to form the words, he says, “It was not my place.”
The smarmy grin gets wider as he steps closer. “Well, it’s of interest to my employer, who is also your friend’s employer.”
By early afternoon, they’ve rehashed the entire story from Dean’s perspective, Mills has read through her notes from her meeting with Cas, and he’s learned way too much information about his stalker. Apparently, he’s not only a violent psychopath, but he’s also smart. They believe that he has committed at least a dozen other rapes and at least ten of those turned to homicide. Unfortunately, they can’t prosecute because all of their evidence is circumstantial. In fact, the only charges ever to stick had to be thrown out during the trial because of a mix up in the chain of custody of key evidence. That botched paperwork is the reason that Michael Boyar is on the street, and could be the lynchpin deciding whether or not Dean makes it to his next birthday.
His trip is smoother than it’s ever been. Between one moment and the next, he is in the midst of the party from the picture. Vibrant energy pulses at him from every body in the room. Dancers swirl chaotically around him, encouraging him to join in. The fringed dresses swing with a mesmerizing swish. He grins at them; his heart light for the first time in recent memory.
Dean and Cas face a couple of obstacles before they can be together again.
“No! Absolutely not. I didn’t even know where you lived until two days ago.”
“I like the burn, Dean. Trust me. I want to feel every little bit of your fat cock shoving its way into me.”
Cas hugs and welcomes each person, introducing them to Dean. The most striking thing that he notices is that their guests represent almost every race group on Earth. Cas’s family is international. It makes sense, when he thinks about it. Cas is decidedly European looking. He doubts that he would have been able to blend in and be trusted in ancient Japan or Peru with a simple costume change.
“Cas,” he whispers when he is buried to the hilt inside of him. “I don’t ever want this to end.”
“My name isn’t Cas. It’s Jimmy. You must have me confused with someone else.”
Cas grips the bars at the foot of the bed in a whitened clench. “Yes, because the man was trying to kill me! Not you!”
“Yeah? You look like a bitch down there.”
“They have always been there, Dean. You just can’t see them on our plane of existence.”
The young man has already made an impact on their morale as well as their bottom line, and he’s barely had time to get his feet under him. Cas couldn’t be prouder. Dean’s strategic competence is the sexiest thing he’s seen in a long time. Well, until now.
“Of course.” Like there was ever any question.
Cas looks down at his bulge and puts all of the emphasis he can on the word paint. Dean can’t help the laugh that bubbles up as Cas pushes into him, trapping him against the shelf.
Cas nibbles on his bottom lip and then inhales sharply. “There is something I can give you that will travel with you.”
“Stop it!” Castiel roars. Dean hurls himself at the window once more, but the angel catches him with his grace in mid-air and sets him on his feet. Wisely, he stays put, even though his expression is enough to make lesser men wither. Dean’s breath is sawing out of his sweaty form, and he folds forward to prop his hands on his thighs.
The moment that Dean feels him there, he finally speaks, “Dean, stop! Please! I’m begging you. Please, they are watching.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Entice you? Hmm. I could remind you that I’m still sloppy and open from you coming inside me earlier. Would that entice you?”
Cas challenges, “Third. You’re forgetting how you told my roommates, in graphic detail, why you’re walking so funny.”
"It's possessive. I'm marking you as mine."
Cas hasn’t said another word since. His sketchbook is open in his lap, and he's working on an ornate geometric piece. Dean doesn’t always have to fill silence. He can listen and sit quietly. This feels different, though. Cas is disappointed and he’s practically forcing Dean to come up with a better plan by refusing his company. In the back of his mind, Dean knows that Cas is right. It just feels too surreal, and he would rather ignore it and hope it goes away.
After her next bit of conversation, Dean tells Cas that she wants to read his hands. Cas doesn’t understand, but nods his consent. She kneels beside him and holds her hands out, patiently waiting for him to place his hands in hers. It is ridiculous to him how much effort it takes to follow through with the simple request.
He turns his head to the side to catch Dean’s eyes. The heat there is beautiful; such expressive eyes, lidded as they are in desire. Cas lets him close the gap while he runs his fingers up behind Dean’s head and into that soft hair that defies description. It varies in shade from honey to fawn to mahogany, depending on the light. He wants to tug and pull on it, but he keeps his touch gentle, contenting himself with devouring Dean’s lips. They taste as sweet as they did when they were covered in honey. Better, even, because he can tease out his natural flavor without the sugary distraction.
“No, I wouldn’t play with you like that. That would be cruel.”
He stops again and comments, “Cas, you’re really freaking me out.”
He’s never heard the word ‘helping’ sound so filthy. Dean relays the story of Cas’s assistance, leaving out anything not PG or better, obviously.
“Book it.”
“It’s nothing, baby. I just fell.” Dean smiles at him, but now that Cas has seen his hands, he recognizes the glassy look for what it is.
“The time travel thing?” Cas growls. “You still don’t believe him? He opened up to you and laid himself bare and you crushed him with your refusal to trust him.” Cas gets louder in his defense of his soul bound husband. “You broke his heart and you could have killed him!”
Castiel tries to lighten the mood, “You were my age not so long ago, Alex. Surely you sowed your share of wild oats?”
Although Claire is seventeen now, he remembers her as she was when they both lived in the Walsh's fourth floor hovel.  She couldn’t have been more than five or six years old then, with her flossy baby-fine blonde hair and huge, guileless blue eyes. His heart had broken every time he saw a sad look of resignation steal away another bit of her exuberant innocence. He would have snatched her away from that horrid pit of filth, but he had only been twelve himself. There was nowhere he could go with her that wouldn’t have made both of their situations worse. Instead, he stayed there with her as long as he could. Despite his own personal discomfort, when she came to him with her quivering chin, begging for her ‘Cat’ to pick her up, he always did.  He lost track of the number of times she cried herself out with her face buried against his chest.
Dean ignores the grumbling and continues, “I want to work because otherwise I’ll go crazy. I’m taking precautions.”
Cas fidgets and squirms until Dean finally slips free of his mate. As soon as Cas can stand, he’s grabbing for clothes and throwing them on haphazardly.
Not his Dean. Not the only man he’s ever loved.
“No, not at all. The emotion that I’m getting from it is that you’re protective of the moment, like I’m something you cherish.”
Dean hadn’t even gone back to their apartment after… well. After. He’d gone right from CalTech to the recruitment office. To be perfectly honest, the recruitment office was next to a liquor store, which was his original destination. When he saw the sign with the proud soldier standing at attention, though, he thought it was a sign sent to him personally from God. Now, he isn’t sure who sent the sign, but the past is in the past where it belongs.
Finally, the man slows. The second between him stopping and turning is the longest of Dean’s life. Is it him? Could it be? How? Was it a lie? Is it a miracle? All of the questions swarm him like an angry hive, casting shadows of doubt on him that he wants to wave away like the pests they are.
“There was no way I was getting roped into wedding plans,” Dean says as he turns on the stove. “We both agreed that we wanted very simple with just our closest friends and family. If she wants to turn it into something bigger, that’s on her.”
When they get to the door, Dean fumbles with the keys while Cas wraps him up in his arms and nips at the nape of his neck.
They, like almost all of the other members of the court, fell asleep in the forest. Drunk on liquor, nectar, and sex; their bodies were exhausted, and sleep pulled them under while they were still basking in the glorious afterglow.
He hands Dean the bottle of tuiça with a warning. “Be careful. It is very strong. Don’t drink too much because I can’t carry you back.”
Cas clears his throat harshly. “Not exactly. I have taken care of his needs in other ways.”
*****
“September 18th. Sounds like the perfect day for a wedding.”
Meg shrugs, “I figured he wouldn’t know that wasn’t a thing.”
Slipping a finger in beside his tongue, he lets it tug and coax Dean open. When he sinks it in all the way, pumping in and out, he reassures him, “This is the only one I would ever consider sharing you, sweetheart. They might see you, but I get to touch and taste. I get to hear those sweet sounds. I get to hear you beg me for more.”
Dean should have known that Cas had ulterior motives with all the sweetness and light from the day before. It was too great of a divergence from his typical selfish behavior. Dean was an imbecile to give the man room to wiggle beneath his shields. Damn the beautiful distraction.
Besides, he has important work, and he can’t be distracted by his beautiful guard. He knows it’s a horseshit excuse, but he needs some time to pack away his feelings again. Of course, that’s not what he’s going to get.
Dean sees the nurturing Castiel disappear and the rage re-appear. He turns back to his brother.
Cas notices the enthusiastic response from Dean with a sly smile. “You agreed to let me put a mark of ownership around your neck and treat you like your sole purpose in life is to bring me pleasure.”
*****
“Fuck,” he mutters and shakes his head.
Caught in his gaze, Dean approaches slowly. “I didn’t know if you’d be back.”
“Mary, we don’t want to keep her from you.” Cas says as he approaches the kitchen. “We just didn’t want our decision to take her in to affect anyone else’s lives. We don’t know how long we’ll have her.”
“Probably because we haven’t decided. He needs to get back to work, but he wants to stay longer.”
Renewed energy allows him to throw himself to the side just as an inhuman roar reaches his ears. It’s hard to place with his head swimming in a fog of agony, but he realizes enough to know that it didn’t come from behind him. It came from a distance away. Hope, fragile and weak, blooms in his chest.
Dean smiles in vindication. Benny rolls his eyes and mutters, “I should have known you’d side with him.”
“It’s fine. I’ll be fine.”
Boldly, he marches into the cathedral alongside the soldiers and dignitaries. He’s seen dozens of pictures of the cathedral, but they don’t prepare him for the splendor of its reality. And again, the idea nags him; how can this be reality? But, it’s all right here in front of him.
“I was good.”
Cas leans back on one hand, guiding Dean’s cock to his hole with the other. As soon as Dean feels the head of his cock push against the soft give of Cas, his eyes snap up to meet Cas’s. Caught in each other, Cas starts the slow, inexorable slide.
“Yes, I want you to mark me everywhere.”
“Nine months longer. That will put it at a year total. I argued to reduce the sentence, but Alex wouldn’t budge.”
That brings him back around enough to focus on Castiel, but his head is loose on its swivel. This undaunted fighter is nearing the end of his resources. He will pass out soon. If he hits the ground, the soldiers will attack mercilessly for the chase and fight he has put them through. Castiel would hate to see this man hurt any more than he already has been. In fluent French, he asks, "If I promise that none of these men will touch you, will you stop fighting and allow yourself to be moved?"
“I need you to be incredibly careful while we are here, Dean. The Fae are tricky and count on tripping up others to gain favors from them. I’m not sure why the queen wants you here for Beltane, but she wants it enough to trick you into agreeing to stay. Don’t trust the Fae. Ever.”
After completing that cycle at least a half dozen times, Dean is covered in a fine dew of sweat, he’s leaking a steady drip of precum, but he feels euphoric. Cas pulls his arms to make him sit upright, and then shifts his hips to sit in his lap. “Wrap your legs around me.”
Of course, Dean can't help but be a brat. “You’re my hero, Cas.”
Meg blinks a couple of times and then her smile creeps up dark and dirty. “Why Dean, a little bit of a pain slut, are we?”
Her words sound as if she is offering him a bargain; a better outcome. It is actually a warning if not an overt threat. If he hopes to protect Dean and keep him whole through this season that they are stuck here, it is necessary to make Dean into the perfect slave.
Cas tilts his head and searches his face. “Close your eyes. What am I thinking now?”
*****
Dean shrugs. “It’s a sign of respect. I treat Baby like a lady.”
“I’m sorry that I’m hurting us,” he replies, a sorrow in his eyes that Dean can’t stand.
Cas hides his smile when he curls his tongue around the now firm nipple and sucks it into his mouth. He alternates pressure, rubbing the tip gently and then tugging on it with the pressure of his mouth. He can feel Dean’s body responding beautifully to the attention. The tension in him is building, his hips are shifting and restless after just a minute or two. Cas knew Dean would enjoy this, but his reactions are so honest that Cas has to give him more. He hollows his cheeks and sucks hard, knowing the answering pull Dean will feel in his groin.
“Lesson? What lesson?”
“Oh, I can and I am. The prisoner will be indentured. He will serve the royal family as penance for his crimes against us.”
“Of course not. Like I told you before, my love, it is an act of intimacy like any other.”
These pictures are unfamiliar, but they really could be of him. Every feature is an exact mirror of his own. The man staring back at him is smiling with such joy that he finds himself burning with envy, even knowing that he’s dead. He thumbs through the pictures, one after the other of his doppelganger and Dean as they are smiling and laughing. In one, their lips are touching, but the kiss isn’t quite happening because they can’t stop smiling.
“Cas, I can’t believe you did that so fast.”
“When I do want to do something for you that you perceive as aftercare, don’t dismiss me. If I’m doing something, it’s because I want to.”
Shame, guilt, lies, plotting, and lots of pining.
“I apologize for the weird introduction. My name is Istvan. I’m a genetic anthropologist.” Cas can see the man extend his hand beside him, so he drops the camera from his face and politely shakes it.
Feeling Cas buried inside of him is amazing, but once he starts moving, Dean feels pleasure on a scale he hadn’t believed possible. “How did I ever live without this?” he cries.
“There’s no fucking way I’m letting him wake up alone.”
The warning shot fired across the bow, and Castiel must literally bite his tongue to keep the snide retort from escaping. If he wants better treatment for this prisoner, and God help him, he does; he must deal with whatever abuse Alex heaps upon him.
It hasn’t always been this way, though, which is why Sam keeps trying. Dean used to be the life of any party, practically glowing with a magnetism that no one could deny, man or woman. Of course, it didn’t matter that everyone had eyes for Dean because Dean only ever had eyes for Cas.
“Cas?”
The motion destroys Dean. His heart clogs his throat, and he swallows back shredding emotions.  He’s seen the same reaction a thousand times. He’s watched children instinctively react to physical threats when they’ve suffered abuse.
Cas snaps at him, “No, it’s quite possible, I assure you. I can make you do just about anything that I want you to, given the right punishments and rewards.”
“This isn’t a sitcom. Life doesn’t work like that.”
Cas scowls. “Why not?”
“Dima, surely you realize that he is barely out of diapers. I know you like them young, but this is almost obscene.”
“Take Fetiță. She can carry him.” When Matei looks unsure, Dean explains, “I don’t think the prince can ride on his own right now, and Raz is strong enough to carry us both.”
“Drugs. What did you take, Dean?”
“I hate to press the issue, but are you ready to believe me yet?”
“I knew you had some ink hiding under there, but I had no idea you were keeping an entire gallery hidden away.”
“Okay...”
His patience is rewarded when all but one of the men pile out of the cart, intent on other duties. Dean waits until he can sense his guard’s attention wavering, and then he explodes into action. He knew his limbs wouldn’t be at their most stable, but he wasn’t prepared for their mutiny. He cants to the left, grabbing the canvas cover of the wagon to brace himself and sling the other leg out into freedom. With nothing to step out onto, Dean goes down to the ground backwards. Graceful, he scoffs.
“I’m sure that’s by design.”
He hates that Cas is right, and he hates that it takes several breaths before he is calm enough to keep talking. “Why are you here, Sam?”
“Love isn’t about who deserves it and who doesn’t. It’s about what you both want. If you love him, you love all of him, and you do what needs to be done to be together.”
“I will be by your side for the rest of eternity. We will witness the birth and death of stars as we take comfort in each other’s arms. You are my home and I will be yours. Nothing will ever come between us again. I have already given you a pathway into my mind and heart. Today, I share my soul.”
“I’m beyond proud, malysh, but I am not at all surprised. I am vindicated by your every success.”
Cas hums his pleasure at the rich timbre of his voice. “Have I told you how sexy you are when you are are pushing all of my boss’s buttons?”
“Then I won’t.”
“Dean, why do you-”
“Hey. Cas. Look at me, please.”
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”
“I can’t remember the last time I watched a movie,” he replies. “Or what it was.”
“Oh, Castiel. No!” Judith gasps. “What happened?”
Dean chuckles and kisses his temple. “Not going to happen, angel. You’re not going to distract me. If your brother came through here with his family-to-be and found us all wrapped up in each other on the side of the road, we’d never hear the end of it.”
“I made my choice, Cas. I chose you. I will always choose you.” Dean’s conviction is fierce, and Cas is humbled by the steadfastness of his pledge.
Sam glares at Dean and the other guy looks like he wants to strangle Sam. Dean huffs a sigh and holds out a hand to placate the other man without looking at him.
Cas feels a little flip in his belly. This building isn’t too far from his own, and it’s on the cusp of the area that is rapidly gentrifying. Meg’s shop is just a couple of blocks away. It's a dream loft, and Cas is already mentally packing his bags. He needs to calm the fuck down. They are not ready for this. Cas had been playing house in his future dreams, not his present ones.
Dean chuckles. “No, Cas. I gave everyone the evening off. I know better than to poke the bear.”
“Okay, sweetheart. Relax into it. You’re going to come hard.”
With a look of contemplation, Cas says, “So, you’re familiar with fellatio.”
His path out of the castle grounds and into the forest takes him through the elaborate gardens behind the castle. Thankfully, this somewhat hidden path was revealed by wheedling it out of Castiel while he was high. This shortcut will save him close to an hour. His simple question about where the prince liked to take his horse for a good ride had resulted in a treasure trove of information about the land surrounding the castle. In a few minutes, he would find the gate that separated the gardens from the wilderness, and he could move more swiftly. Making it to the tree line was the biggest obstacle. Once there, he would be home free.
At Dean’s confused look, Chuck waves him off and takes one of his hands and one of Cas’s. “Never mind. I think you’ll understand as we complete the ceremony.”
He cups Dean’s face gently, just fingertips drifting over the skin of his jaw. “Will you do that, Dean? I’m begging you, sweetheart. Please?”
Dean is happy that Cas is mellowing towards Sam. Earlier, he’d been concerned that Cas was going to strangle him. One of the many things he’s learned about his loving, doting husband is that he is incredibly protective. Watching Dean have to endure the transformation alone had destroyed Cas, and he has pledged to never let anything hurt Dean again.
Cas smiles down on him. “You would make a very good detective, I think.”
“Fuck that. If you’re upset, I want to know about it. This is just a building. It will be here tomorrow.”
“Unnhh. Cas, f-fuck.”
He starts on the velvety head, swirling his tongue around and sucking lightly. Cas pulls back a little, and Dean looks up. Fractured colors light up every surface of the man in front of him. Reds, blues, greens, yellows. “Wow,” he whispers, struck dumb by the sight. “You’re breathtaking.”
“My brother.”
“They’ll see me as a freak.”
When no response comes from his companion, he looks up to see horrified sympathy in Cas’s eyes. “Why would they let their soldiers live in such miserable conditions?”
Cas scowls. “Why so few?”
“It’s too convenient. He was military and then private security for the government. Does that sound like a man who would willingly fall into bed with Russian mafia?”
Ever the nurturer, Dean brushes Cas’s hair off his forehead. “So I’ll get to show you around some history, too. Granted, it’s only a couple of decades compared to the entire rest of history, but I look forward to showing you the world that I grew up in.”
They are staring at him passively, no expression marring their features. Dean stills, waiting for them to explain their presence. After long awkward moments, he speaks instead.
His fingers rub down both sides of his groin, massaging deep into his inner thighs to relax him. When he settles, Cas cups his balls in his hand, rolling them gently and tugging until he gasps and arches. The slide of his body up and back down Cas’s cock makes them both shiver.
*****
Dean meets his eye, mischief sparkling. “Anything for you...Master.”
Carefully, slowly, Dean stokes the fire in Cas. His touch continually throws fuel on the lust burning in his body. When Dean is done getting him ready, Cas is dewy with sweat, babbling nonsense, and pleading with him. His hands are white-knuckled in the sheets, his head thrashing back and forth.
“Please tell me you aren’t placing bets,” Castiel barks out a laugh.
“I don’t like to drive her in traffic, mostly. If someone hit her, I’d probably end up doing prison time.”
“When I first heard the charges in this case, I thought that it was going to be a waste of the court’s time. After all, the defendant was arrested inside the building during an alleged robbery.”
His arm pulls Dean closer as he tucks his nose down into his hair. He’s still not close enough. He needs to feel every bit of Dean’s skin on his, but this isn’t a sexual need. Cas is craving intimacy, needing the comfort of knowing that Dean wants to be in his arms.
“Yeah. I’m taking care of you, making you feel good. Why wouldn’t I like this?”
Dean loses track of everyone else in the room and falls into his kohl-rimmed blue eyes. “You’re a sneak, but I love you.”
In the car, Cas keeps searching, but he types and scrolls with his right hand, letting his left hand hang over Dean’s thigh in a comforting and slightly proprietary touch. He couldn’t possibly know it is something that he used to do whenever they were in the car driving somewhere. Dean feels buoyed by it, by all the similarities he is finding to pre-kidnapping Cas. He’s stopped calling attention to each little quirk and mannerism that they share because all it would do is call attention to the fact that he is different than he used to be.
Cas tenses under him and Dean goes up on his elbow to watch the angel’s face. He trusts Cas, he absolutely does, but there are times that Cas does things for the ‘greater good’ that Dean has difficulty with. He hopes that this is not one of those things.
Dean feels an ache in his chest, knowing that he won’t have the chance to see this relationship flourish before it will be ripped away. He’s mourning already, their firsts and lasts thought of at the same time. The unceasing tick of the clock forces urgency to tint every action. Tears fill his eyes and the words come rushing out without his permission. “Take me with you.”
Within a few more moments, he feels Cas’s tongue join in. That makes his cock harden instantly, and he has to stop and try to gain control.
Dean squints his eyes and purses his lips. “I’m sure you know exactly who he is, Sam. I didn’t want to get into it out in the hall.”
He wakes late in the day, still covered in dirt and stale sweat. Immediately, his temper returns. This entire week has been one of the most frustrating he’s experienced in his adult life, excepting his time in hell, of course.
Marius just nods his head with a sympathetic grin.
Dean stops to process what Cas is telling him. He needs to be smart about this, despite how his heart feels. “Can I ask some follow up questions?”
That’s all it takes for Cas to start chasing his own end. Widening his knees, he sits upright, pulling Dean’s hips toward him as he sinks into his luscious body. Tipping his head up, he feels an absolute deluge of nectar fall on them as he comes so hard he sees stars.
On a normal day, Peak alphas are incredibly strong. Mess with their true mates in any way, and you’re likely to see superhuman feats. Insulting them is a death wish.
He’s brought back to the present when Dean does something new with his marvelous fingers. He slips their flared heads in between his fingers, so that each cock is rutting up in between two tight fingers while the rest of their lengths are still rubbing against each other. The pressure is exquisite, mimicking the press against a barely-stretched rim. “Does that feel familiar, Cas?”
“That’s not really your call to-”
The scowl on the angel’s face intensifies. “Knowledge needn’t be hoarded, my queen.”
Once Dean has a grip on his flexing biceps, their fucking takes on a brutal intensity.
Cas is being cagey about his answer again. “If your bond with me completes, I will be allowed to visit freely.”
“Oh, I’ll bet I can give you a run for your money,” she spits, crossing her arms over her chest and narrowing her gaze.
“Mmhmm. Delicious.”
Unwanted thoughts worm their way in to infest Cas’s flayed mind. This is the last time he will have Dean in his arms. It’s the last time he will smell his sunshine scent of apples and leather. He grips him tighter, trying to delay the inevitable.
“I loved it, Cas. I’m just as into this possessive shit as you are, if you hadn’t noticed.”
On the road, Cas rides at his side, their horses nickering their happiness at the extended run. When they stop to rest, Raz rests his head on Baby’s neck, their bodies nudging and bumping together. Dean watches with fond amusement. “Your boy is trying to seduce my Baby.”
“It is good, isn’t it?” Dean takes a sip of his drink and his mood shifts toward caution.
Cas shakes his head when Dean gives him a campy wink. “I didn’t know you were looking for a motorcycle.”
“Yes, you’ve taken enough of it that it could be affecting your ability to repair your body.” Cas cups his cheek and lets his thumb run idly over his skin.
Dean grins, “Close your mouth, Cas. It’s not quite that big of a shock.”
This confession alone surprises Cas because the proud hunter has been quite adamant about heterosexuality being the only option for him. It strikes him that there is much more to the apparent deception, so he remains quiet. Dean has been tugging on his collar off and on for the past couple of hours, but there is no reason for it to remain on when they are alone. He says as much to Dean.
Dean takes a last look over his shoulder to see Gabe gazing back in approval. Dean winks at him before Cas shuts the door.
Cole’s head pops up at that. “C’mon, Cas. Dean isn’t going to let this get between you.”
The layered pastry is outrageously good. Nutty and crispy and laden with thick honey. It is heavenly. When Cas brings another bite to him, he leans forward impatiently to take it. The prince takes his time bringing his fingers out of Dean’s mouth, chastising him, “Greedy.”
*Sigh* I hope you enjoyed it.
“Which is what?” Sam’s face isn’t showing any emotion, but he’s asking questions. Dean prays that is a good sign.
When they surface, Cas is too overwhelmed to formulate words. He’s caught up in a tangle of adrenaline, wonder, and a vicious clash between what he knows of reality and what he is observing with his senses.
“Feeling you watch me is making me hard,” Dean announces without turning towards Cas.
“I want to look at you. Strip for me.” Cas reaches down to help Dean to his feet, and then he pulls a chair out to sit in and watch the show.
Russian translations:
Cas grins. “You have a lot more control than I thought you would have. I had to keep trying more devious ways to break you.”
Without warning, the queen’s eyes cloud to a milky white and her voice seems to echo throughout the chamber, reverberating in his skull. “Your anger and hatred are aimless, ready to ruin everything within your reach. You need a firm hand to help you wield that weapon before it destroys you.”
There are a lot fewer drains on my time and energy lately, and the temperature here is finally staying in the 80 degree range instead of high 90s, so I'm much less heat-exhausted.
He catches his distorted reflection in a shop window. Excellent. He looks as authentic as he can be, at least on the outside. He’s sure that his accent won’t hold up, though, so he hopes that he finds Cas soon. In previous journeys, he’s been close by, so it stands to reason.
Castiel flushes a deep crimson. “I apologize. They said that you needed my seed.”
Dean shakes his head. “I’m sure that he just got caught up in work and lost track of time. I’ll fetch him now.”
Cas nods and gestures towards them. Dean raises his hand to accept the task. The entire troupe heralds him with a loud ‘huzzah’.
Rolling his eyes, Cas blinks out and back with Sam, rejoining Dean in the back seat.
Dinner with Pakhan and his decision that rocks their lives.
Dean is good at being still. He can sit in a blind with a gun and wait patiently for hours without twitching a muscle. Guard duty is effortless by comparison. Today, he is restless. Something about the situation feels wrong. Did he do something to upset Castiel? Why wouldn’t he want him to do his job?
“So, are we done with the fundamentals, then?”
“Good. Busy.”
Walker is smooth, Dean will give him that. He’d bet that most victims and their families fell for the macho, ‘we’ll take it from here’ bullshit he is spinning. Dean’s grown up with John, though, who is a master at persuasion and manipulation.
“You just don’t. Usually.”
“Later. If you’re good.”
Dean leans over him, placing loving kisses along his cheek and jaw. “The money is great, and it will make things so much easier, but the fact that you did this to help me? That’s what is making me so happy.”
“Your body is heaven itself, Dean.”
“Something amusing, Mr. Winchester?”
Dean excuses himself, and goes into the bathroom to get himself under control. Cas tries to go to him, but John steps into his path.
The queen rolls her eyes. “Oh, for fuck’s sake. He needs your seed, Castiel. Your seed is the cure for the poison.”
“Service him?” she teases. “He’s such a powerful creature. I imagine he will make thorough use of you before the end.”
“Why does it bother you that I asked, sweetheart?”
“Coffee?” he asks when the coffee maker alerts him that it is finished brewing. Cas shakes his head, but continues focusing on his work.
“Beg.”
“Not in the slightest. Touching you will never bother me, Dean.”
“It won’t happen again. I promise.”
There is nothing up here but him and the open air. It’s a dizzying, freeing feeling, but it isn’t doing much for his anonymity. He glances down and towards the patio and sees dozens of faces looking up at him with wonder. That little stunt pretty much outed him as Peak, not that he was trying to hide it.
As she introduces herself, she ruffles a hand through Dean’s hair. Adrenaline and worry light Cas up, and now he is wide awake. Why is she here?
“It’s just an ass, Cas. No need to wax poetic.”
“Oh? I’m not aware of any other angels in this dimension.”
Dean does pull back then to look at Cas. He carefully lifts his eyes only once he is out of Cas’s personal space. He can see the ache that he feels reflected on Cas’s face.
Chapter One of this story was originally posted as a one shot, but as I was writing, an entire story bombarded me. I asked your opinions about continuing, and the overwhelming majority said yes.
“Good idea?” Cas laughs.
“Any lawyer would have chewed this kid up and spit him out. I would have been doomed.”
Cas hears his panic, and lets the mistake go without remark. “Shh. Baby, I promise that you will enjoy it. Do you remember how much you loved letting me finger fuck you?”
Sam doesn’t know how Dean got out of the hospital. It is supposed to be a secure facility. Did this guy he’s with help him? Whatever is going on, Sam wants answers.
Sam’s squinched up nose almost makes Dean laugh, but then he remembers that his sneaky brother stole all of his books.
Sam’s jaw drops as the breath is knocked from his lungs. Cas might as well have punched him in the gut. He sags onto the bed near him and drops his head into his hands.
“I-I’m s-sorry.” His eyes are on Dean, pleading. He believes that Dean will show him mercy and normally, he’d be right. He’s taken care of people his whole life. The Hippocratic oath means something to him. If this man were in an accident or injured in battle, Dean would do everything in his power to save him. Here, though. He will not do anything to put himself in opposition to Castiel. Dean steps back, eyes moving to Cas.
“Besides, we can still do the visual ones.”
As he spins farther and farther out of his depth, Dean’s tentacles are everywhere. The touches get progressively more intense. One of them tangles in his hair. Suckers are latching on to his thighs, spreading them open obscenely wide. One of the arms is creeping up his abdomen, trailing a thick, sticky shine. Cas immediately knows that this is one of Dean’s sex organs. It is leaking for him just like Dean’s cock.
