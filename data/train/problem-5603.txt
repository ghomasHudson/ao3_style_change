When he did manage to blink past it, he found Tony smiling at him, patiently.
He clenched his jaw, and tried to focus on the individual words that the official was saying. He knew he had no chance of following the meaning, but maybe he could distract himself with those individual sounds, concentrate on them hard enough to blot everything else out.
Steve could literally

Still, Tony only felt that electric anticipation, that

“There are lots of problems…” Steve sighed, sinking back into the couch. It was a horrible couch. Too firm and covered in cheap fabric and an ugly orangey-brown colour. Clearly they didn’t give much thought to the little touches at… Steve literally had to look for something branded before he could remember where he was… Talleroy Communications.
He’d certainly never asked himself what he was scared of, before now…

“Steve, I…” He whispered, willing something to follow…
“The Avengers initiative was scrapped,” Tony commented bitterly… and then just carried on talking . “And I didn’t qualify. Apparently I’m volatile, self obsessed, don’t play well with others…”
“...I don’t know, seems like they’re bothering with a lot of the boring stuff I hate about organising parties,” Pepper mused. “I’m just saying, I hate proofing and printing the itineraries. Nothing ever stays in the centre… and there is no way on Earth I’d bother doing that, if I was going to kill everyone anyway. I’d just… tell them there was going to be an orientation event, or something…”
And then the elevator doors slid open, and there was Tony.
the only one who lost people-”
And Steve thought…
“Oh God Steve,” Tony barked, running a harsh caress over the back of Steve’s neck, “Jesus, you are so good at this,

So, already, there’s me, about to get carried away with a relationship that I’m not good enough for, that can only end up hurting this person that I’m actually in love with-”
That someone could just
“Do you feel all, um… Dizzy?” He managed eventually. Steve’s frown deepened, his gaze drawn from the horizon to the inside of his own head as he thought about it.
Steve considered simply ignoring her - he was long past any feeling of sympathy or connection to her, and, honestly, he quite liked the thought of it…
. It just… goes away. Like any other bruise or cut –

to do this next bit. That it had occurred to him, and he’d dismissed it, because it wasn’t really on the theme and it wasn’t really to do with Steve-
recoiled from any attempt to protect him. He’d learned it well enough that he didn’t have to think about it anymore. He’d walked away from so many relationships for that very reason. It was perhaps
And then Tony moved his hands so that he could lean over Steve, shifting just enough that he could thrust into him more sharply and still hit that same place.
...Steve was allowed to look happy to see him, right?
God he was strong.
And the man they were guarding was more openly unnerved than a Hydra boss or a black-market weapon dealer would’ve been – so, either this was a small-scale operation in big scale trouble, or this was a lower-management guy.
“Hello?”
lost people!” Steve outright shouted. “
Until Steve coyly mentioned that he might actually like to go to a Varian party – and then the specific appeal was immediately, viscerally apparent.
“I have no idea,” Steve groaned. But he was glad Bucky was awake. He felt better, having someone to panic with.
The memory of Bucky screaming, and the instinct to bury it.
Stape simply shook his head, sadly – and turned towards the trolleys.
God, how had he missed
After all that investigation, The Avengers had reached the same conclusion they started with – that The Facility was dodgy as fuck. That they had no choice but to go in and see what was going on-
If he blurted out that he was terrified and confused right now-
tell me how glad you am I’ve got a compound to ‘rattle around’ in. Now tell me about your faith in people who haven’t let you down. Now tell me you’re sorry that your best laid plan’s hurt my feelings, that you hope I understand-”
And then a brief musing about the layout of the capital city.
Steve hit him.
Adam was closer – but Steve was faster.
… I don’t know if I would. Just because… it really was half a second. And I’d be scared to death that if I changed something… that I’d be left with something I couldn’t put right…” He sighed, and glanced up at Rhodey. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not sorry, and that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it differently next time. And – does this make any sense at all?”
And Steve just stared at him for a second, trying to work out whether Adam had
“But, yeah…” Tony tried to pull himself back to the point “ You know, I think I
That it
“…which
couldn’t run from it later. It would make it harder to bury, when reality came rushing back to him, as empty and inevitable and awful as it had ever been…

...He’d sort of forgotten that bad things could happen by now. And, when you take for granted that bad things can’t happen, there is no reason not to eat the flower…
That was something.
, obviously,” Tony huffed. “But no, it’s just… There’s some stuff I want to talk to both of you about, that’s all.”
If Steve could tell Tony that he was a vampire, then he could tell Tony that he loved him, that he wanted to be with him for the rest of his life…
By the time they got out into the corridor, it felt like there was a riot taking place in Tony’s brain.
In fact, it should probably be a comfort, to think that Tony had only chosen Clint because he preferred Clint’s company. That would be better than thinking that Tony just didn’t trust Steve to act as cover for him, in a dangerous situation…
If it was really as simple as ‘be completely honest’, then Steve should tell Tony all of that, right now.
And then Steve glanced up. He managed a self-aware little smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, and a shake of his head,
It was the voice Tony used as much as the actual words. Such genuine sympathy, such
And Tony knew the answer was no. It wasn’t
The soft jolt though his bones brought him to his senses a bit…. Enough to recognise that Janine had brought him to a little side room, maybe twelve feet squared – just big enough to fit two little couches, facing each other. He was on one, and Janine was just sitting, patiently waiting, on the other…
A ‘perfectly harmless’ component that had caused Bucky’s arm to malfunction, and throw Tony clear across his workshop-
he always had a snappy comeback, and every argument he ever made was entirely reasonable and contained only truth and rightness – but that’s because he literally has a team of writers. People who spend two weeks crafting that snappy comeback, and rewrite those arguments thirty times, and just don’t have anything controversial come up. They’re never angry or hurt, when they write that dialogue. And no one can talk like that in real life. I’m sorry people expect you to. I’m sorry I did. But… If you always have to mean every word you say, you’re never going to be able to say what you mean. You’re never going to be able to share anything if you have to wait until you’re sure it’s perfect first. I mean, you’re talking to someone who lost their temper three days ago and yelled at you because I felt

But no. Even that didn’t stop him wanting to touch Steve right now.

And then he
“It’s fine,” Tony assured him, with a little shrug and a nonchalant shake of his head, his hand already raised to make an entirely different point-
But, luckily… no, it

“No, I know,” Steve nodded, laid back and
Well, he’d planned all sorts of alternative scenarios to this very moment, in his time.

Which wasn’t really a plan, so much as a plan for making a plan, but it was a start.
…Okay, maybe this hurt more than it would have if anyone else had chosen Clint… Immediately… Without even thinking about it…
Steve got that same uncomfortable, tight feeling in his ribs. He didn’t know if he was remembering it, or if he just felt like that every time he thought of Tony – but he was sure he didn’t like it..
While Happy was settling Wesley into the passenger seat in the front, Tony steered Steve into the backseat of the car - again finding that he was far easier to manoeuvre than his fierce expression would suggest.
that was.
And maybe Steve was still just slightly distracted by the handwriting, but…
Nothing on earth had ever been that beautiful.
And I really hope you like the update!
Looking at Tony right now, so full of passion and brimming with ideas and raring to go, Steve had this sense of

“I love you,” Steve murmured, finding that his jaw was so much heavier than he was expecting.
from his mental spiral.
Tony perked up at that thought, like he already knew it was going to be important.
And it wasn’t the same as the first night he’d met Steve, when Tony had been forced to bury his issues and let Steve in. This wasn’t like the morning after Obie bit him, when Tony had no choice but to swallow his panic and carry on existing.
And then it was just a noise. A not unpleasant melody in the background of a soft, gentle world…
And then Steve curled one hand under Tony’s shoulder, and gripped Tony’s hip with the other, and started fucking into him fast, and deep, and
He couldn’t quite believe that he had

He knew that it was his own fault, for never saying any of these things.

to say. That Steve had stopped Tony from sharing a deep and sensitive fear, with something that sounded like a debate rebuttal… He remembered the trauma and personal history that underpinned this for Tony – that Steve had been in the middle of reminding himself about that very fact, when his emotions kicked in-
what he’d almost done; he couldn’t stop himself picturing the outcome he’d so narrowly avoided.
Steve when he didn’t know what that desire might be twisted into. The deep dread of one day wanting to hurt Steve the way Obie had hurt him – or, worse still, one day believing it was the
He should’ve said something, he should’ve told his ‘boyfriend’ that he had a strange feeling about it and asked to speak to him in private – asked if Tony was sure he was ready to go back into
Of course, it made no sense now. But there was such a feeling of

be immediately disinterested in, when something important was happening.
Steve had lied.
Not that he was capable of worrying about anything, at the moment.
As had been happening all morning, a memory flashed up behind his eyes, without warning or permission - yet another image of himself, naked and pleading and offering himself up, overwhelmed by that pure, perfect desire to submit-
“Why would they do that?” Bucky frowned, still licking the sugar from his lips.
knew where he was going with this…
“Steve,” Tony whispered – or tried to. And then Steve smiled, and gathered Tony up against his chest, so that he could lie down on the couch with Tony cradled against him. Tony melted against him immediately, feeling as though he could carry on falling into him, like he could drown in the warmth of Steve’s skin.
He was compromising this whole mission, simply to avoid pain for himself.

In fact, the more Tony thought about it…
Okay, that was a little bit of breathing room at least… Tony had no idea how much, because he had no idea what time it was – but that was better than

And he turned to look at Steve… Flushed, and a little breathless, scanning the room with wide, endearingly innocent eyes – as
And now that he remembered doing it… he still couldn’t
Oh, but Tony had to be very careful about getting carried away with that thought, before he’d had a chance to speak to Steve about it.
And, heaven help him, for just a few minutes Steve was pleased at the idea of finally having Tony to himself. A reprieve from the constant stream of brash strangers… The hope that Tony might at least
And, well. When he put it like that.
“So, tell me – how do you really feel about Steve?” She went on, in the same casual, conversational tone… So Tony just…
There was another flash, and immediately Tony’s hand was on Steve’s shoulder, pressing against him reassuringly through yet another burst of light-
“Please don’t be alarmed, Captain Rogers.”
For just a moment, he got to be very angry over it.
...Although, none of them had seemed unduly
“You’re a vampire?” Tony repeated, half expecting Steve to laugh at whatever he’d misheard.
…Yeah, Steve felt pretty guilty now. He actually stopped pacing and sank into the couch under the weight of it, as he listed all the arguments Tony had made and all the pain Steve had caused him and all the things he hadn’t thought of at the time. It was all pretty awful…
Because, otherwise, he was left with this awkward silence, and a bunch of filler questions about this mission.
If he could have

But then, that made perfect sense. Everything made perfect sense.
Powered entirely by his own stubbornness, Steve forced himself through three whole pages - almost paying attention to them, and everything.
for the first time. That they were about to go somewhere that there was no coming back from.
There wasn’t any harm in acknowledging that.
… Steve suddenly felt like this moment had come around all too quickly. Snuck up on him, almost.
And he giggled. He didn’t even know
But it didn’t matter, did it?
But Tony wouldn’t be moved
“We’re going to do our best to fix this mess – C’mon, stand up” Steve informed her, offering her a hand. “We’re going to set those hostages free, and we’re going to do our best to make sure no one get’s hurt in the meantime – and if the authorities on your planet have a problem with your family after that, then that’s what they have to deal with.”

been the trauma to deal with.
Steve felt his cock twitch again, some of the tension returning to his legs as his floaty, blissed out thoughts came back into some sort of focus
“No, it’s worse than that,” Tony laughed, joylessly. “No, in my panic to fix the mess with Bucky, I opened all the med lab cabinets and told Steve to go looking for a bio-tech kit. I basically invited him to view my blood exhibition…” And Tony shuddered, remembering all the reasons his entire existence was creepy-
But this was like seeing a ghost.
to happen to him - that he was doomed to keep ending up in this same place, no matter what route he tried to take around it.
to consider Bucky’s particular issues with trust, the things that might make specific treatments more difficult for him. Thinking objectively, as a doctor should, Tony had easily recognised that this particular anxiety might be eased, if someone Bucky trusted was in the room with him. It was an obvious way to reduce the downsides of the patients preferred course of treatment…
It helped him to see

about this introduction, before it snuck up and caught him completely off guard. He’d spent the last six months considering every aspect of his relationships with different people, all the different ways a person could be judged, all the moral questions he had to ask himself about the way he treated others…
But he wasn’t capable of rational thought.

He suddenly felt all the release of letting that tension go –

Well. Tony would be devastated, and he wasn’t pretending otherwise. But, even then, last night would still have meant something.
bad, maybe it was just that it wasn’t as awful as it usually was…
And Steve laughed.
That Steve didn’t know if he would be forced to watch everyone he ever cared for wither and die in front of him-
To be honest, his original plan had become far less detailed at this point. The ‘difficult’ bit, if such there was, had been establishing himself as the only Captain America in this timeline and maintaining the world’s official history of him. His main priority in the last six months had been to keep the secrets of time travel and all knowledge of the future out of SHIELDs hands - and beyond that, to familiarise himself with every detail of the world in 2011, to make sure that he knew more about modern politics and popular culture and present SHIELD employees than anyone… that he wouldn’t be starting out as an interloper to the present, this time around.
“A few things.” Tony sighed, walking into the room and flopping out on the couch, just as Steve had done a few hours earlier. Steve braced for a joke, a challenge, a dig… and was far sadder that it didn’t come “We’re
Steve could feel his lungs burning, his ribs straining against the effort of containing it, like all these pleas and promises were literally building up in his chest-
Immediately, two separate plans presented themselves for evaluation. On the one hand, they

Tony knew that deserved a moment of its own.

“But that means we could just go and get him, right now.”
He heard the sharp intake of breath from Bucky. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the way Bucky had curled inwards, dropping his head and crossing his arms tight, in a desperate bid to hold it together.
And sorry again
...He just strolled over and opened it.
Eventually, the world came back into focus.
He did, in fact, feel
And parts of it came surprisingly easily.
“Not at all – I was just about to explain the different drugs we’ve developed
Enjoy!
But Steve could tell from the way that Tony’s shoulders slumped, it was going to be a little while longer at least.
“That.” Tony suggested dramatically “Is probably a question we should better consider when we are not drug fucked.”
And Steve
By the end of their meal – which

There were only a few scarce details, of course - that was an integral part of this plan. And Steve knew that Nick wouldn’t be able to take much in, while they were still in the middle of this confrontation… But he’d already have an impression. If Steve was doing this right, the horrible truth would be starting to dawn on Nick, coming further into focus with every ominous line he caught…

“Entrez.”
But it was
So he was looking right at Tony when Tony instructed him,
“No, actually,” Tony reassured him automatically, already running calculations in his head. “In a weird way, it’s a good thing. It means the, uh… bad connection, for want of another word, is probably in the joint we updated yesterday. I think it’s gotten…
… But Steve was immediately overwhelmed by that familiar urge to touch him-
“What happened is that someone else used your body to do bad things. That’s the only reason you feel like you remember them,” the man goes on. “And I know that’s a… big idea to get your head around, and you don’t have to figure it all out right now - but just so you know, none of this is your fault, none of it was you, you didn’t do anything wrong.”
For there to be even
“So, what is it they’re pumping up from the basement? Where does that all end up, is it just going into the main water supply?”
“Yeah, of course I am, don’t be stupid,” Steve smiled, waving him on,
He remembered how much he’d wanted to fall into that and stay there. How much he’d wished there wasn’t still that awful thing sitting there between them…
“God, you are so fucking perfect,” just slipped over Steve’s lips, as Tony fell forward, his weigh resting heavily on one arm. Tony laughed, but was too preoccupied with catching his breath to try to answer.
was never the sort to try and bury his internal conflict under other projects and investigations.
…It had always fit.
So, that was a horrible thought that he felt horrible for even feeling horrible about, under the circumstances – and he couldn’t even make himself feel better by focusing on the circumstances, because the circumstances were horrible.
...Something about this arrangement of people felt familiar.
“Oh, no, everything was set up when I joined.”
Steve looked at Adam, trying to maintain a serious glare. Adam just smiled back.
to talk to Steve like this...
“Come.”
The door opened with a jolt. Wesley appeared wearing an impatient expression, which quickly sharpened into apprehension when he realised who it was. Tony noticed that his shoulder still looked misshapen.
He stepped aside, and in strolled a handsome blonde man with broad shoulders and piercing blue eyes. He was wearing a fitted waistcoat over his tastefully sheer black shirt, and pants that probably weren’t considered too tight, on Bulsara….
And then the tender press of Steve’s fingertips against his lips, and,
Instinctively, Tony held his breath - bracing for one of them to start caring about the real world again, and the many uncomfortable questions and reactions that were probably about to hit him…
“And doesn’t he know it,” Steve answered, acerbically. And Bucky just smiled, knowingly,
Which was overwhelmed just as quickly by the memory of Steve standing in the snow, the blood spreading into cerise fractals through the frost on his uniform-
…Like a dream…
And a murmur from his audience,
“Have you eaten?” Tony enquired brightly.
Steve’s fingertips dug into Tony’s back hard enough to bruise, his hips bucking into Tony again as he lifted his head, dragging his other hand through Tony’s hair. Tony sucked against Steve’s throat, running his tongue over his skin, deliberately letting his teeth press into Steve’s neck. Steve let go of a low breath, his hand falling heavily from the back of Tony’s head to the counter-top with dull thud – leverage that he used to push Tony even harder into him.
The pleading was swallowed up by an almost pained gasp, as Steve dropped his head and took the length of Tony’s cock into his mouth.
And Tony knew he had no hope of explaining all the things he was thinking about - he was barely up to thinking about them. But somehow, talking came easily to him anyway.
“But, just so you know – there is
…It would be very different if Steve did it again, though.

Looking back, Steve could see that he was scared to
He’d been fighting this particular shame all evening. Every time his attention turned to the subject of Steve Rogers himself, or any of the purely personal revelations, he’d get this same stab of self-consciousness, and immediately find himself thinking,

“No. I just…” Steve huffed, frantically scrabbling for anything he

“Of course.”
to explain-
“Open your other present, and then you can try it on,” Tony told him, a more imminent heat simmering in his tone. Steve felt it pulsing all the way through his hips, his cock pressed hard against his stomach now, weeping steadily into the fabric of his robe. The wet material dragged across the head of his cock as he grabbed for the second gift, adding an unexpected shock of friction to the electric anticipation gathering up the small of his back-
The all-consuming high of having Tony pressed against his chest…
“Look, Steve,” Bucky began on a sharp intake of breath. “I’m not saying that I understand everything that’s going on with you – but, you know what, I don’t understand a lot of what happens, these days. I don’t understand what the hell Bruce is. I don’t understand most of Asguardian culture. I don’t really understand how I’m still alive, seventy years after falling one hundred feet from a moving train. And, honestly, I don’t really understand how any of us make a relationship work – I don’t really understand how anyone makes a relationship work. I just kind of hope that they do. Like I still don’t understand how this works,” he gestured to his metal arm, “I just hope that it

And Tony knew, even then. There was a wry blooming of inspiration, like you feel when you first realise what the twist in the movie is going to be. Like he should’ve seen this punchline coming,
“What the hell are you doing here?” Nick demanded, in a nervous voice that Steve had never heard him use before.
And it really didn’t help that, that time, Sam and Bucky burst out laughing too.
He headed into the crowd, focusing his mind on the specific details he was looking for-
He should’ve left then, really.
And he felt that pressure ease, and soften into a deep, aching
to think about all these things?
“Hey.”
“And you agreed with him, did you?” Wanda asked, narrowing her eyes.
So, that had left him with nothing to do but go back to the same spot on the couch, and pick up the same train of thought from the night before.
He wanted Steve’s shirt off before he did this
– rather than jumping from being hyper focused on his own failings, to being hyper focused on Steve’s mistakes, and then being confused because it all looked so different…
, and-
Somehow, every hurt and anxiety and angry disappointment he’d ever carried got rolled into this aching physical need. As though it was powerful and pure enough to overwhelm everything about him.
“Mm-hm-Tony,

“Does that mean you’ve not eaten here yet?” She interrupted, her eyes widening.
He found a cupboard full of dull silver implements – no.

He just let his hand run up along Tony’s neck and into his hair, cradling his head, kissing him deeper. He felt Tony drop his other hand, so that he could throw his arm around Steve’s neck, and immediately Steve moved to grab him by the hip, pulling Tony into him-
Steve knew that he couldn’t talk to Tony - even if the laws of time travel would allow it, his current mood didn’t. Even if he’d

He even remembered agonising over these very issues, in another life - fighting the temptation to play favourites with his new team, telling himself that he had a duty to be Captain America for everyone equally, tying himself in knots trying to justify his loyalty to Bucky… Steve suspected that a past version of him would’ve at least felt uncomfortable with his total lack of interest in this-
But, before Tony could beg, Steve’s hands were on Tony’s hip, and on his shoulder, that incredible strength already radiating down through his arms-
But that icy realisation was already spreading up his back, before he’d even finished the question.

It just fit.

“But, no, I should go back to my room and slip into something more comfortable,” he joked, gesturing to his formal jacket. Tony snorted a laugh, and then nodded an acknowledgement,
“So, I, uh, I finished work on the virus,” Tony started, nervously. “Well, I think it’s as well suited for this task as it’s possible to be, anyway. And… when I was running tests with it, I managed to unearth a couple of encrypted files on outside servers - things Hydra shouldn’t have shared off their network, probably. The work experience kid fucking up or whatever, most of them. And I didn’t think too much of it, because it’s not like you can work backwards from there or anything… But then I got to looking at what they were, just, because, you know, they’re confidential Hydra files and we should probably know…”

Something knocked into the side table with a sharp,

“Uh, well, that would depend…” Dr Arden mused...
“Because I wanted to touch base with you, really,” Peirce replied, breezily. “I feel as your overall director I should personally make sure that the reports are correct, and that you’re acclimating well. And, I won’t lie, as a fan of yours, I wanted to meet you.”

“…Understood,” JARVIS answered, kindly.
…Tony couldn’t be sure how long this day had actually been, but it had certainly been epic.
Wesley came to a guttural stop when Steve sneered at him.
Meanwhile, Tony allowed his train of thought to drift aimlessly through his mind, paying no attention to the stops it made along the way. He didn’t even notice that it was following the well-worn track into thoughts of Steve - after all, of all the mental scenery he could have scrolled past, Steve Rogers was the most familiar…
. And it didn’t even matter that he didn’t know what these feelings were, or what they said about him, or that they were nothing to do with the mission-
His vision was actually clouding at the edges by the time he walked into Tony’s lab. His voice felt strange in his mouth, as he tried to call out casually,
An unexpected laugh bubbled over Steve’s lips - at the strangeness of the question, or the silliness of the situation, or the sheer ridiculousness of the answer… he didn’t even know.
– as he climbed on top of the covers, still fully clothed. And Steve grinned, and crawled onto the bed, just about managing to kick his shoes off before he collapsed into the mattress beside Tony. Tony wriggled closer, and Steve pulled him in, letting him settle into that space against his chest that he so perfectly fit.

Tony couldn’t help thinking that things might’ve been different, if he’d known it was Captain America
“Oh yeah…” Bucky squinted. “And then Nat did that lullaby thing, and you kept asking her why she didn’t do it earlier…”
sorry. And this apology
“No, I get it,” Tony smiled, sincerely. “I mean… I’ve kind of thought a similar thing. And, you know, then felt guilty about it, just like this. But, I think what I mean is… I don’t know, they say you should be with someone who has similar life experience, right?”
“What, like Agent Nowak?” Bucky raised his eyebrows at him. Steve shot him a bitter look.
that I should sympathise with
Perhaps it was that he’d been so focused on his way back to Bucky - that he’d had an actual plan to channel all of his feelings into.
“But you being here won’t stop any of that from happening,” Tony challenged. “That can’t be how it works.”
Steve noted the observation, and filed it away. Immediately, he knew he wasn’t going to do anything about that
Tony’s head swam as he finally lifted his head. He had to take a moment to take a deep breath, and wait for his vision to clear-
And then Steve ran his palms the length of Tony’s arms, taking the shirt with him-
“JARVIS, what time is it?”
But he just
A total, primal terror consumed Steve so quickly that he didn’t have a chance to fight it. Every thought in his head was immediately blotted out by the blinding focus on that one word.

… There was quite often a strong link between the biological process of sex and the human understanding of love – a link that often led to confusion and heartbreak in the real world... But it wasn’t the case that people should actively separate sex from love, or that the emotional significance of procreation was ‘made up’… Or that there was any less confusion and heartache, in a world where love and sex were kept separate.

It would still be more information that he had right now.
Somewhere, it occurred to him that he
Tony grabbed the back of Steve’s hair, burying his head into Steve’s neck and moaning his name as he came, and came, and came…
Both he and Steve had spent the first two hours of their shift patrolling the warehouse, like they were supposed to. Growing increasingly bored as they walked up and down between rows and rows of refrigerators, occasionally checking the entrance and the secure doors through to the rest of the facility… But even that level of enthusiasm wore off after a while. Now, Gary was also reclining against the wall by the main door, looking every bit as disinterested as Steve was pretending to be.
Tony began to fidget more urgently, mindlessly bucking his hips up against Steve’s thighs as that frustrated need began to sharpen. One hand went to Steve’s waist, kneading into the curve of his hip in some unthinking encouragement to move against him-
It was also because Tony had just worked out that he was that much closer to taking that next leap of faith with Steve. That, out of nowhere, tonight was apparently the night he told Steve he was in love with him - and everything that represented.
Steve was so distracted by how good Tony looked in it that he didn’t even notice the large gym bag he had slung over his shoulder, until Tony had shrugged his way free of it and tossed it carelessly onto the couch. Steve raised his eyebrows, questioning, but Tony only smiled in response and then sat down next to it.

And Tony just let himself get carried away with the melody of Steve’s voice, picturing his face, the exact way he’d be standing right now…
Okay, so he knew he probably had yet another anxious evening of overthinking ahead of him… He’d get started on that in just a second. Swear to God.
And that spike of irritation at his own ridiculousness.

But five minutes passed, and then ten. After a while, Steve’s shoulders began to ache with the effort of keeping them tense. And then, just as his eyes were beginning to burn, he heard Tony whisper, dryly,
And then Tony heard the faintest little shuffle beside him, and remembered Bucky.
“Security breach,” Tony mocked automatically, mostly to cover his shock.
It was
think about it now - that he had a capacity for rational thought and a control over his reactions that had simply been beyond him last night… A capacity and control that he might lose again at any time, apparently.
Steve was slouched in the corner of one of the couches, his head resting heavily on his fist, his eyes lost somewhere in the middle distance. Not the professional and dignified demeanour he usually tried to maintain, while he was out on company business-
“So, what, he got mad, but maybe not at you?” Bucky guessed, like he was playing a parlour game.
And groaned instead, when he remembered that Steve wouldn’t be home until the evening.
...He even knew that
But something was different.
“Jesus Steve,” Tony gasped, as Steve jerked into his grip. Tony felt that painful throbbing ease into something more comfortable, and then compulsive, as he ran his hand over Steve. Feeling the weight of him, the

“...And
“I know who you are.”
“Shhh. Patience.”
It was like being brought out of a trance and realising there was a gun in his hand. The sudden instinct to not just put it down but toss it aside, to flinch away, to overcorrect. He could not

“Uncomfortable,” Bucky repeated, with the smallest of smiles.

So… Okay.
But at least now they shared enough casual conversation that Tony could grin, and gently enquire,

A little smile tugged at the corner of Steve’s lips, in spite of everything.
Tony giggled, before he turned to pull the gym bag onto his lap.
He followed that feeling through to the kitchen, with no real plans for what he was going to do when he got there - and then he spotted Tony standing by the sink, finishing a glass of water.
I thought, you know, I would try to…undo that, by not doing that again… but I didn’t really know what to do instead, so…”
And then Bucky looked right at him, his intent clear in his eyes

been thinking Tony might do.
“Okay…” Tony muttered, his eyes dropping and drifting into the middle distance, the way they always did when he disappeared into thought for a second. Steve took the opportunity to grin briefly, as though he could really get it out of his system like that. He flexed his hands at his sides, dispersing what he could of this elated energy, pointedly reminding himself of his plan as a way to focus,

This energy conference was going to run to the end of the week - and there was no way he could slip away unnoticed. He was expected by too many important people. Committed to too many important causes. There would be far too many awkward questions about where Tony had gone, and
And there was no emotion in the delivery, no attempt made to sell it - but it was as much effort as he could manage.

“The idea is to think of it less as a weapon and more as a defence… although, it would be able to contain a weapon, obviously…”
It occurred to him that Steve had probably struck Wesley in the shoulder, rather than the head - which was the better option, he supposed. Okay, that particularly nasty break in Wesley’s collarbone might never properly heal… But at least he was responsive, and coherent, and didn’t seem to be having any sensory issues...
Tony never imagined he’d have to critically evaluate that particular coping mechanism. He’d never asked himself whether it was fair, or what it represented, because it had seemed like nobody’s business but his - what could it possibly matter, if Tony had been a bit hard on one dead man purely to spite another…
This specific, pure, heartfelt good…

Still, Steve was aware that this was important, enough that he was trying to sober himself up even before Bucky spoke-

But, before Steve could feel any of the emotions that were probably about to crash over him, Tony carried on, casual as you like,
And… It was like he could see everything more clearly. In finer detail, in higher colour. In slow motion.
And the room fell quiet for a few moments, as Tony flicked through thousands of screen shots and scanned over hundreds of files… and Steve just fell into a quiet lull, watching him…
Didn’t seem to matter anymore
And Steve really wished it didn’t.

Hoping that Bucky was okay wherever he was, that he’d managed to find some happiness in that broken world.
Tony had, in fact, spent the entire flight, happily reliving every moment he’d spent with Steve in the last few weeks…
And, even over the top of his razor sharp focus, some tiny little part of Steve’s mind noted, for later consideration-
But he was sure that there would be nothing he

These floodgates were open now.
Now he didn’t know
Breaking societal conventions on sex and relationships and even letting someone drink his blood was one thing. And hey, Steve knew this little episode wasn’t going to make it into any of the comic books, and there were plenty of his self-proclaimed fans who’d be shocked by his behaviour – and he really didn’t care.

Tony sank into it, letting it close around him and soak into him and swallow him up, the memory echoing in his mind as Steve thrust into him,
“This is not the first time you’ve made me laugh” Steve corrected him, like that was the silliest thing he’d ever heard.
sitting there, frozen inside a body that he couldn’t control. Those were the moments when Bucky was most aware of the horrors he was living through, and his own helplessness against them. Moments when he felt his own limbs hanging from his body like stone, cold and unresponsive and alien to him… Like an allegory for his entire existence.
And then, before another thought could enter his head, he’d blurted it out,
And he shot them another smug look, each in turn, before he continued.
… And I love that.”
The feeling of Steve, warm and solid against his chest, the soft heat of his mouth, the entreating, almost hesitant way Steve put his hands to Tony’s back-
That he’d never really trusted Tony, or thought of him as a friend, or given any thought to the part Tony played in his life.
Well… Well, he wouldn’t yell at someone for it, obviously. That would be unkind.
“But really though” Steve carried on – completely missing the joke “We didn’t actually spend that much time together. It wasn’t like you and me, we didn’t– I mean, we did work together, but I don’t know what stories he could possibly have that he didn’t just read somewhere else, you know?”

She took her time, carefully lowering the bar back into place behind her, and gently polishing her fingerprints from the surface of it – which gave Steve a few seconds longer to consider her… to realise that she wasn’t human. The proportions of her face were slightly wrong, and there was a bluish tint to her skin that he’d just worked out

“How… any of what… works?” Steve clarified, awkwardly.

So, with a bit of conscious effort, he forced his thoughts back into the moment, until his anxiety settled down into almost nothing-

This rush of affection, that cut through all of Tony’s inhibitions and made him feel happy and warm,
“Yeah,” Tony breathed bitterly, like he was talking to himself - before shooting Steve an expectant glare,

Even before he really knew any of them, Steve had understood what he’d just become a part of. Even in the depth of trauma, he’d felt that ray of hope...
“Weird how?”
A couple of hundred yards away, Tony could just about make out Clint and Scott, organising a large group of humans… behind that, Wanda was standing next to Sam, while he yelled impatient commands. A continual movement of others – human and Varian – forming weary lines that marched through the crowd. The unmistakable shapes of Rocket and Groot, directing traffic.

When he closed the door, and turned to look at Steve, Tony was overwhelmed by a surge of such pure,
“So, usually we start with a little summary of The Facility, a little history of the place and what we do here, all of that. And please stop me if you’ve heard all this before – but, often, the things that seem important to you when you leave aren’t the same things that seem so important when you arrive, and a lot of the time people forget to mention those sorts of details to people when they make referrals, am I right?”

And he could never bring himself to hope for someone that was prepared to throw their life away for him.
“I take it the base in Sokovia was a no, then?” Steve sighed, his thumb rubbing anxious circles on the back of the phone he was still holding.
There was something wonderful about this giddy desperation. It had a place in this amazing story, it gave yet another layer of meaning to all the moments that came before and after.

I’m going to do that anyway - so, it’s not even as though I’m lying to him… Well, much.”
Steve melted into it immediately, moaning against Tony’s lips - still rutting against his hand. Tony ran his thumb over the head of Steve’s cock, wetting his fingers before he started working him off in fast, sharp strokes. Steve’s muffled cries reverberated down through Tony’s jaw as he carried on kissing him, devouring Tony’s mouth now, nipping at his bottom lip as he rocked his whole body into him.
“This is so unfair, this really

And Steve smiled, and let go of a little sigh, squeezing Tony’s arms when he told him,
He could recall the vaguely condescending, sing-song tone. The jaunty little flourish as she turned off the faucet. He remembered thinking that she sounded nervous, and not knowing why.
“Okay, well, like this,” he said, plucking a stalk from one of the pots in front of him. He held it up for Steve to examine. It looked like a little sprig of wheat, but with pastel pink petals where the kernels would be. “We call this a JimMiami - this can make you see the theatrical stage show in the mundane world around you, the things you wouldn’t normally perceive to be there.”
The fact that he was able to join in with this conversation - that it hadn’t even felt performative.
He knew they’d both stumble when they walked in. He couldn’t be bothered to brace against it – he didn’t
That was good.
And then Tony was on top of him, pinning him to the bed, covering him completely – grabbing mindlessly at Steve’s clothes and sucking deep, bruising kisses along his neck. Steve rocked up against him, wanting to feel that friction… wanting to feel Tony push back.
Amongst other things…
“I’m just saying that you don’t have to be

“Hey man, you okay?” Bucky asked, casually, as Tony fought his way through those last few feet to him.
“It’s okay baby,” he reassured, dropping his head to press a tender kiss to Steve’s forehead. “Relax. Let me take care of you.”
“Don’t fucking move,” Stape spat, his voice pulled tight and trembling. There was a small cut on his forehead that he had left to bleed profusely, staining the left hand of his shirt a gory red. His eyes were wild, his lips pulled into a confused sneer.

It was… Oddly liberating, actually…
He watched a wave of relief roll over Tony’s features, his shoulders melting under the force of it. It pushed against a tender spot, very deep in Steve’s chest. Automatically, his hands reached out for Tony, his body shuffling closer as he carried on,

There was a pointed silence before Nick sighed, and stepped back towards the door.
Rhodey left a little pause. Then he took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders, obviously gearing up for an in depth response.

…And Tony
They were wrong, by the way.
“Oh, Jesus, Steve, stop, stop I can’t, I’ll- I,” Tony babbled, an edge of genuine panic on his voice, his hands scrambling to find Steve’s arms. Steve paused instantly, relaxing his grip and leaning back - but, before he could give Tony any real distance, or worry about what had happened, Tony carried on, “I will actually come if you carry on like that, I- really, I can’t…”
He felt like his lungs were being flooded with icy water, like he was drowning from the inside out.
Tony considered Steve for a moment. He wondered how they could potentially draw it to The Facility’s attention that Steve would make a particularly interesting test subject.
Or maybe it was simply that now Tony

“Uh… okay…” he muttered – already fishing his keys out of his pocket.
He didn’t even jump when someone rapped, frantically, at his door.
Of course, he knew it would help to analyse the technical set up… But that was a Tony thing. That was something that he would obviously, naturally talk to Tony about…
But, somewhere in the middle of his little speech, everything had started to… shift. The background had faded away and the immediate had started to feel so much more vivid, and… somewhere along the line, he’d stopped play acting. The whole thing stopped feeling so much like a prop in a daydream, and started to feel more… real. Like he wasn’t pretending to do this for a moment, so that he could image what it felt like. He
“Tread balls,” Steve corrected, casually. Mindlessly.
Simply knowing that much made Tony feel better about… well, everything. It made the world seem a fundamentally more positive place, it expanded his very definition of hope and potential.  Even if that was all Tony ever got out of this… It would have made any pain worthwhile, given any life more meaning, guaranteed that he ended up in a better place than when he started.

But Tony didn’t say anything.
underneath him, his lips parting under Tony’s, his hands suddenly gripping Tony’s hips-

And then Tony curled his hand around Steve’s cock, gasping quietly as he realised the weight of it against his palm-
“So… What does that
And then, his phone rang – or rather, vibrated harshly against the coffee table, where he’d apparently thrown it. It was immediately jarring, and Tony snatched it up more to silence it than to answer it. In fact, it wasn’t until he heard Rhodey’s voice in his ear that he recognised that he’d just taken a phone call.
There was just no way that these topics had been picked at random, and no way they were being looked at in isolation. They had to be connected by

He had been swamped by that feeling of pure and simple rightness as he finally wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, the relief of feeling Tony’s bodyweight pressed against him-

He’d feel safe, and valid, and…
If Steve had been able to find words in that moment, ‘stunning’ would have been an apt one - because this might’ve been the only time in his life he could have used it literally. The only time he had been genuinely, physically stunned into silence by something, because it was just that beautiful...
He kept his eyes on Steve as he wet his fingers, his heart racing again as he watched Steve part his thighs and arch his hips - like he was offering himself up.
“It’s okay sweetheart,” Tony whispered warmly.

A pointed observation about why their experiments were obviously flawed to begin with, before an unfriendly agent became involved.
And then he saw the focus in Tony’s eyes and realised that it wasn’t that…
answer. You're scared to be around him
For a few seconds, there was just the sound of his own heart beating in his ears.
Steve glanced up and saw Tony peeling the pillowcase away from his shoulder, his forehead creased with harmless distaste. That same sheepish grin pulled at Steve’s lips again as he looked away… and saw his shirt, snagged on the corner of the bedside table…
The draw he felt to Steve, the way he always knew when Steve was near
Steve saw the casual assumptions that the world made about these things. He could feel in all the careless word choices and default images. Like being Bucky’s boyfriend would’ve been the ultimate in relationship status – like the only reason Steve wouldn’t claim that label was if some criteria wasn’t being met. He just knew, no one would think twice about the phrasing,
had he instigated an conversation-
He was too busy fighting the urge to pull Tony back, to bark at this guy to back off, to snap his spine clean in half-
Steve remembered having Tony pressed against his chest. He remembered Tony telling him,
Some key words in that almost snagged Tony's attention.

up the stairs later” Tony joked weakly, scrabbling for a better argument.
It didn’t take Steve long to recognise that it wasn’t only his bad mood causing the atmosphere. He could feel the tension in Bucky’s arms, the aura of anxiety that surrounded him. He could see the weight of sadness bearing down on Rhodey's shoulders. Wanda’s expression was every bit as dark and hopeless as Steve felt. Dotted between them were the people who, in this moment at least, were responding with desperation - exaggerated attempts at a different tone, ridiculous bids to fill the silence-

He was sitting in the sleek, glass and chrome waiting room outside Alexander Pierce’s office - no doubt irritating the receptionist, who was ignoring him from behind an imposing mahogany-topped desk. His calves had started to throb with the repetitive stress of it-

And then Tony had worked his way down as far as the dip of Steve’s waist, his fingertips digging into Tony’s the soft skin over the curve of Steve’s hipbones, and Steve rocked into it instinctively-
As well as their deep affinity with natural intoxicants of all kinds… or, perhaps because of it… The Varians had a very relaxed attitude to sex. It was, apparently, considered to be a perfectly natural, everyday expression of affection – possibly inappropriate in a business meeting, but certainly not out of place at a party…
Steve’s continued bemusement that he wasn’t going to question it… But it was as though Tony’s brain just dismissed that for him.
“Yeah, I really don’t know what that was about, by the way” Steve told him, somewhat enthusiastically “Your dad didn’t even like me that much, I swear – well, he never acted much like he did…”
And Steve braced his legs, and locked his eyes on Adam’s phone.
beholden to national interests or working according to national authority… but not separate to them either. An independent group with its own internal regulations and its own autonomy - that could still work within existing international laws, and partner with all other interested parties…”

Tony… fighting with something. Coming up against some vital, personal challenge, again and again – the same way he faced any impossible challenge. Back straight, eyes forward, ‘always alright’… And Steve had already worked out that he’d fallen for something, when he’d taken all that at face value. He’d already figured out that he’d missed so many of Tony’s deeper qualities, when he missed his hurt feelings… But
“There are a few of those basements, where we develop different things. Those are mostly the pure medicines, the things we’re good at. Then it gets pumped up to

Steve glanced down. Same.
And Tony took Steve’s hand, as if it was simply an impulse-
Well, several appeals, really.
Something he could lay out and consider
They weren’t at the beginning of anything.
All of a sudden, everything felt so much closer and more vivid - like every sensation in the world was being drawn into him.
Steve’s chest clenched painfully when he thought those words.
And then he felt Steve’s hands curl around his waist, gripping Tony firm as he moved lower, his kisses becoming rougher as he reached the soft skin on Tony’s stomach.
Now, it was only too clear that he’d just been grasping for some structure - some distraction, even - to help stave off a potential mental crisis…
evil you know – my Dad isn’t evil, he’s just- and I did try to – but you don’t understand what it’s like, it’s not like I had anywhere else to go, and he’s my
“Bad day sweetheart?” Tony asked, softly, his eyes full of such beautiful sadness. Steve could only nod, heavily.
Steve had found a quiet spot at the edge of Tony’s driveway, overlooking the ocean. He’d managed to take a few peaceful hours to himself, letting his thoughts unfold naturally as he gazed down at the view. He’d watched Tony return home at sometime in the early afternoon, engaged in an animated discussion with an invisible earpiece all the way from his car to his front door, and the effect was exactly what Steve had been hoping for-
All the weeks he’d spent picturing every perfect detail of Steve’s body, remembering all the pretty little noises he made, trying to recall the heat of Steve’s lips against his neck…
Remembering every interaction they’d ever shared in one instant rush, suddenly seeing what should’ve been obvious at the time.
And now it
He couldn’t do anything but watch as Tony’s reactions played out in front of him - his own responses simply pulled along with them.
rethought that, he’d told
“Yeah, of course”
Tony’s stomach twisted, his mouth watering and his muscles tensing towards Steve. For a moment, he was forced to hold himself completely still – having to gather his senses, and come back into himself, before he could trust his body to do anything at all-
Steve felt as though he’d just been thrown out of the real world.
Steve, who defended enhanced beings as people rather than political points. Steve, who hadn’t made Tony feel like a weird, awkward recluse…
“I know Bucky didn’t have a choice about… my parents – and I know
...Okay, so he couldn’t
But he didn’t care.
“So…Do you still hate Bucky?” Steve asked – like it’d taken all of his courage to get the words out.
He heard himself think,
But it was just an echo now. A shadow of what it had been. Nowhere near strong enough to over-ride how much he’d recently learned.
“And, I don’t know if you’ll ever see him again… But, I guess I

thought about it.
do after something like that happened – how they’d end up in that situation in the first place. He was aware, in the abstract, that he wanted it… But it was a bit like being in a hostage situation and just ‘hoping someone would rescue you’. You can’t daydream about it if you can’t think of a plan yourself. If you don’t know what the thing you want looks like, you can’t picture it.
“And I know you’ve told her bigger lies than that, even when she was your girlfriend, and I’m not saying it’s the same – I’m just saying that, just because you lie, or even if you mess up, it doesn’t mean you don’t love that person,” Steve told him, carefully, like he wasn’t sure if he was stepping onto thin ice.
“Yeah, basically.”
It was meant for this.
When he stepped into Steve, Tony could feel more than just the warmth coming off of his skin. He could
“Well, that was our first hypothesis, obviously,” Nick replied, sardonically. “The only reason we put a couple of field agents on this was in case it turned up a few more of the people we’re tracking. Except that their investigation turned up –
And, just as Tony was thinking that was quite an involved idea for her to bother discussing with either of them right now, Steve casually observed,
But, of course, he could immediately picture how a
Even without the comfort and security of his prior mood… He could feel that there was no malice in this. The way they were moving, the tone of their voices… The happy atmosphere they exuded. Without knowing what the hell it was, Steve already knew it was something…
In the meantime, Tony’s various objections were bubbling up into a shapeless sense of hot, probably disproportionate, outrage-
And then he remembered Bucky.
mode after all.
Like if he let himself remember, if he let himself drift down that particular path… he might end up somewhere unexpected. Somewhere there was no turning back from.
“Oh...Tony…” Steve whispered, as his hands reached out of their own accord, just following this an immediate urge to
“Yeah, I’m here, I’m good.” Tony yawned “We, uh, sobered up a bit, and then we thought we might’ve left tech in the room, so we went back – we’re coming to meet you now.”
“Why?” Steve demanded “I thought none o’these things could hurt you?”
Tony felt himself slip into contingency mode, shutting his reaction down as much as possible so as to give nothing away - looking to leave his options open, while he gathered more data.
And, if Pepper had said that on any other day, Tony might have been hurt by it.
But, at the same time, he was still slightly giddy, and lighter somehow…
He had already made a physical commitment, in some way tied Steve to it, before he’d thought about all this-
And Steve heard his breathing crack painfully before he recognised that he was tearful – and then a sudden stab of panic as he realised that he wasn’t going to contain that sob-
“What was all that about?”
Now, as he made the final walk up to 10880 Malibu Point, his only thought was of Tony. By the time he reached the end of the driveway, Steve had been moving at a near run, barely noticing the way his pace had picked up to meet his heart rate-
Steve now. He’d let Steve know him. They’d shared something. They had…
A heavy fog seemed to close around him, his vision darkening, the whole world falling away from him…
That warmth and reassurance that came from Steve, that confidence in
The time had come to decide where it was going to end.
Wasn’t that how it was supposed to work?
“But what I’m saying is…” Tony tried to start again. “If you’re thinking you stepped out of your lane today… it’s not my lane either. It’s not like you can say the wrong thing to me about being a vampire – because I don’t know what the right thing is either. I don’t really know how any of it works, or what any of it means. So, if you want to ask me whether it’s a good idea, or a dangerous idea, or a… creepy idea, or whatever… You could just as easily ask Bucky. He’d have about as much basis for an opinion on it as I would.”
“Well…” Nick exhaled. “Obviously, a lot of those files are

He’d spent so many nights trying to picture this perfect, pretty face in exactly this moment; trying to
denied that he wanted to be with Tony. He’d never pretended that he thought Tony’s relationship with Pepper was somehow superior, or that he hoped it worked out for them this time. He didn’t claim not to have an interest, here.
“Sir,” Steve replied, following the congregation over to the walk-in refrigerator.
is Fritz Haber,” Steve informed him brightly. “Often called the father of chemical warfare. He’s the man responsible for creating the chlorine gases that killed millions of men in the most brutal way possible, and very nearly won the war for Hitler. Do you know what he was working on, before he became a mass murderer?” He paused, waiting for Nick to shoot him an impatient look before he continued, “Fritz Haber wanted to end world hunger. When he started his research, it was because of a fertilizer shortage in Europe - they say that half Europe would’ve starved to death, if it weren’t for Herr Haber. He developed a method for extracting nitrogen from the air, and that method is now thought to be used in two thirds of the world's food production - did you know that?”
And then he glanced down at Tony, who was looking up at him with a playful smile… And he remembered.
For a few seconds, the workshop was full of the sound of anguished panting, as each of them tried to calm themselves down. Steve just about managed a breathless
“Hm,” Tony smiled, and kissed him again, just once, very sweetly. And then he dropped one arm so that he could squeeze Steve’s hand, a warm authority radiating from him as he said, “come on, let’s go inside.”
“-Then weapons have already occurred to them.” Tony finished for him with a sigh. “And weapon tech tends to appeal to people who want money and power” He pulled what he hoped was a teasing expression when he said it, intending it as a harmless joke at his own expense.
He thought about Obie. Things he wouldn’t have
all at once, and I just… thought…
Without thinking, Tony curled his palm around the length of Steve’s cock, never breaking his rhythm. Steve cried out, only managing a stream of fragmented sounds before it dissolved into a wordless, sobbing plea. Tony felt that pressure reach a tipping point, the unmistakable escalation of wave after wave of pleasure crashing before the last had chance to ebb away.
Tony-
And Maribelle was going on about salt reacting with the water here, or something equally ridiculous, and Tony was nodding entirely at random, and
Drinking again should probably have been on that list too, just to be on the safe side - but he’d well and truly lost his appetite, so he’d have to wait and see if he could face it again in time.
“Yeah, you could say that.” Tony sighed.
Yes, actually.
“…I didn’t say, specifically, one way or the other,” Tony replied, carefully.
The room fell quiet for a few moments, while they both did their best to make sense of the information in front of him. Steve didn’t
And now there was
For a few seconds Tony just looked at him, an amazed happiness flickering in his eyes.
In fact, now that he knew what to picture… the whole thing terrified him, actually.
It was Steve who had been momentarily thrown by it.
“...I liked it,” Tony whispered softly, lowering his lashes.
“...Half a million.”
Sam, Tony and Bucky had been sitting in silence on the uncomfortable wooden bench in their holding cell for about fifteen minutes.
them?” Steve pushed, his eyes alive with interest. Tony was momentarily thrown by the question, and when he hesitated, Steve clarified, “you don’t just make computer simulations, I mean? Or… figure it out on paper, or whatever…”
And then the still detached image of himself, snapping a man's neck with his bare hands…
Steve groan against his throat.
And another aside he’d once made about AI…
Tony took a deep breath that hurt his ribs and made his head swim. His vision darkened at the edges. His jaw felt so heavy, his lungs protested at the effort.
He was pretty sure that Tony believed him now - well, about being from another timeline, and all the things that had happened there, at least. But Steve reckoned that one of the questions at the top of Tony’s mind was still
That he couldn’t…
“And, uh, if you
He traded cheerful small talk with the few engineers that Nick introduced him to on the way, always simply as Steve.
And, as he said it, he took a little step forward – and held his arm out, into the sunlight.
But he had been on that treadmill for days now, and he was exhausted.
“Ah, well I won’t even

be just fine without him – that this whole obsession was a symptom of the very problem he had to fix? Should he stick with his tried and tested mantra, that this was how it had to be and how it would always be and there was no point getting upset about it?
That made this strange, shapeless power feel like something more tangible...something that was making more and more sense, as he replayed that interaction in his mind-
For Pepper to have realised that Tony’s sudden willingness to make phone calls for himself, as monumental as it was,

But Steve wasn’t scared of any of that, the way he used to be. He didn’t feel so alone with all of it anymore. He didn’t feel so entirely pressured by all of it, so overwhelmed by any of it – so completely defined by those parts of it.
… But it was so hard to think back to that moment and not love him. Everything Steve remembered about him was through this filter, every little detail came with context that he couldn’t have known at the time – but couldn’t unknow, now.
Tony couldn’t help it if he was still overcome by a pure feeling of total
He’d have guessed, and worried, and planned, and counter planned, and-
Their eyes met, briefly, as they silently debated who was going to be the one to say it out loud.
“Oooh, try to remember to bring drinks when you come back,” Nat suggested, brightly.
He kept expecting to see some sort of mark on his skin, although he wasn’t sure what it would look like, exactly. It didn’t feel like a bruise or a burn or a scar… It just felt
Bucky smiled indulgently. And then, as he was trying to think of what would be more helpful, Steve went on, “...And whatever I do, it’s going to involve talking to Tony, and then I’m going to blurt out the more inappropriate thing possible, in the worst possible way. And then the ground
...He hadn’t realised how scared he was of it all going wrong, until it hadn’t.
That’s probably what he would’ve thought, if he’d happened to live a different life and never learned anything about aliens or gods or the limitless possibilities of the universe… If he’d been some anonymous businessman with an undistinguished career and no interesting stories, it never would’ve occurred to him that this was something ‘weird’. He never would have asked himself if there was something deep and meaningful about his strange impulses this morning…
“…It broke my heart, Tony,” Steve told him, so sincerely. “It
Steve was rather taken aback by the lift in his chest when he caught a glimpse of the wrapping paper. He didn’t know why he should be surprised by the gesture, seeing as it was so obviously something that Tony would do - or why he should be so immediately and purely

“…Bored,” Steve confessed, with a smile. Tony knew he was smiling. He could picture the

“Er, well-”
Well, Tony wouldn’t know what to do about

“Hi,” Steve smiled back, more knowingly…
“What?” Steve demanded, far more sharply than he intended - regretting it as soon as he saw Tony blink in surprise.

And then there was a pause.
“We took on the greatest evil in the universe, and we won.”
with adrenaline
And that meant Steve’s whole life – all his hope and dreams, all his future happiness – now rested on Tony. It meant that everything Steve had ever wanted, everything being dangled so tantalisingly close, was only possible if Tony was sorry for attacking Bucky like that… or would at least acknowledge that it had been wrong… or even, that he didn’t expect Steve to pretend otherwise…
“So, that’s what you’re going to do now?” He asked, his voice sounding like his own at last. Tony glanced up at him, his eyes flashing gold under the lights before they settled, deep and dark, on Steve. Steve felt his breath catch in his throat… but even that wasn’t

Steve could really remember about the ‘showcase’… He knew it was spectacular. He knew there was a time right at the beginning when he’d felt somewhat awed by it…
He told himself not to be ridiculous.

since Tony had had a good night’s sleep.
But somewhere, all night, he’d wondered…
And then Steve’s hands, pushing his thighs apart, and the firm press of his fingertips into the sensitive skin at the very top of his legs – and that excitement kicked into gear again, twice as hard now.
But he didn’t want to interrupt him.
No inhibitions, no shame…
“So, you’re a drug company, a chemical weapons company, what?” Steve demanded. His eyes were adjusting to the brightness of the lights above his head, able to pick out more of Jesse’s features – he saw the patronising smile when he replied,

“...Because I’m a brat, mainly,” Tony accepted, with a sigh. “But, I mean, also because it was a ridiculous cover story… I don’t know, it wasn’t a plan I’d put a lot of thought into before I did it, if I’m honest.”
But right now, he really had

sure that Steve didn’t really like him, that Steve’s feelings and actions and reactions had to be about more than him – and that proving that fact would change everything.
But Tony knew how much he’d like to. He knew exactly
He hadn’t knocked it over, then.
Steve did a quick scan of the surroundings. The area at the end of both bars seemed to be where the spare crates and empty boxes got thrown, which was good – meant that the bartenders never came up to the very far end, at least… He did a quick tally of the customers waiting to be served, a brief assessment of the system each server seemed to be using, to work their way through the queue… He glanced at Tony and signalled, silently,
to be here with him.
Steve glanced down at his phone as subtly as he could – and then bit his lip so hard that it stung.

that he managed to keep that whole comparison to his outburst in the bunker in his head, that he managed to explain it at all…
“Yeah?” Steve breathed, honest and vulnerable.
“Not if you were controlling the concentration in the water – not if
Partly, it was the legitimate nervousness he always felt on Bucky’s behalf during medical procedures – especially when it came to sedation, and pain relief.
The way he’d known exactly where to bite, and when to stop, and how to seal that wound…
“I think so – she just pushed this at me and she was gone…” Tony found himself leaning back slightly, holding his breath as he unpeeled the seal, not sure what he was bracing for-

And Tony’s hips had jerked at that, and he’d shaken his head, and answered
“You don’t know how many times I’ve daydreamed about being held against this chest,” Tony sighed. “You have no idea what it’s like, being wrapped up in your arms. How safe I feel. How happy you make me…”
Bucky was saying any of this, what the thread of the conversion was supposed to be - Steve didn’t know in which direction to reply. Whether to search for an answer to Bucky’s accusations or look for a deeper meaning in them or to wonder whether something else had happened…

“And you’re interested in my opinion now?” He asked, from absolutely nowhere. Just pulling words in front of him, the way he’d been trained to use any nearby object as a shield, if he had to.
“I’m sorry, I know you’re just trying to help,”
So, thinking back through all the little details of Steve that he had longed for in the last few weeks, Tony dropped his head to kiss Steve’s throat. Steve barked another moan, throwing one hand to the back of Tony’s head and wrapping his other arm tight around Tony’s waist. A spike of pleasure shot up along Tony’s spine, a more immediate, compulsive heat building where Steve had him gripped hard against his body. His kisses became rougher, sucking deep, burgundy marks over the tender skin below Steve’s collarbone.
And it hurt,
But why wouldn’t he have thought that?
...What about in twenty years from now, when Tony was grey haired and tired, and Steve still looked like
He assumed it must’ve been quite a dramatic fall, because somehow they’d ended up a good six feet away from the edge of the pool. Tony had apparently had the sense to throw himself out of the way before Steve landed right on top of him, and had ended up just to his left - the two of them now up to their shoulders in the ball pit, facing the crowd of amused onlookers who had gathered along the poolside.
That part all seemed to happen so quickly. Like it was always already done with, or something.

by this revelation. This sudden
this had grabbed his attention so completely – and, in the first instance, Tony wanted to tell Steve that, too.
But he so much wanted to tell him-
He wanted to have something to say, when Tony asked what this meant for the future - even if it was ‘I read everything there is, and there’s nothing like that in there.’
“I did ask – apparently she usually shows up to this one.” Tony shrugged. And Steve shrugged back – well, they’d guessed that much. According to the notes on Tony’s little file reader, the second-floor parties were all actually themed by substance – and, when you knew that, you could see that alcohol was a much more coherent theme in this room than ‘Black and Gold’. As well as all the very well stocked bars, there were also several staff members circling the room with trays of shot glasses, and ornate glass bottles left on every table. And, as Maribelle was apparently The Facility’s resident expert on alcohol, it made sense that she’d be in this room, if she was anywhere.

“It’s called the Shadow Party, it’s the first room you come to, at the top of the main staircase.” Zan answered efficiently. “You need to be there from nine tonight. I can’t promise when I can get to you – but I will find you before Franciszek arrives.” She was already lifting the bar as she spoke, walking to the other side of it. Barely glancing up at them before she added.

he could feel an additional tingling on his skin. An edge on his nervousness, something he was sure was more than the natural response. He thought back to what Maribelle told them,
And with that, something slipped.
“…Like what?” Tony frowned.
Well, hey, at least he didn’t feel like blurting it out.
And immediately Tony recognised the feeling of Steve positioning himself between his legs, the way Steve pushed at Tony’s thighs. Tony arched his back, letting his legs fall apart, one of his hands grasping at Steve’s hip, trying to urge him on.
His balls tightened sharply, his cock weeping steadily over his fingers as he drew closer to that limit-
They shared a glance,

And then Steve’s body sort of took over, pushing up into Tony in one swift thrust.
“…But yeah, I don’t know for sure.” Tony shrugged. “…

“Maybe she’s using us for her

...Because she was on her way in to spy on him.

to have Steve now, before he’d even worked out what that meant-
It was like leaving a part of Steve out there somewhere, lost in his own personal hell.
Eventually, he made it to 9.56pm. Close enough. As he crossed the drive to the main entrance, he couldn’t help noticing how different it felt, without Bucky there to reassure him, or tease him – or, usually, both. It made Steve feel oddly exposed. Not so much because he was alone, but because this was all so different to what he was used to. It had the strange effect of making everything look slightly different. Making Steve overthink every trivial part of this – even getting into the damn house.
Steve resolved to wait until it had come to a complete stop before he risked starting up again-

, as Steve froze completely, and Tony struggled to kiss him and cringe at the same time.
Tony bit his bottom lip, forcing a third finger inside, trying in vain to create that same friction. The little ripples of sensation dissolved into a maddening, frustrating need far too quickly, teasing the impulse he was trying to sate. His whole body twitched as he recalled the sound of Steve panting, the solid power of his muscles tensing under Tony’s hand, the rush of pleasure that bordered on pain – the dizzying incomprehension that anything could feel that good.
“No, me neither,” Tony admitted.
house, by the way - mostly because it implied a sort of permanence. It suggested that Tony had already gotten used to Steve being here and started taking it for granted.
After a while, Steve had started to recognise just how many little interactions they’d shared each day - that even the ‘insignificant’ ones started to feel significant when they were missing. This past week had made Steve realise that Tony made him smile far more often than he made him grit his teeth… far more than anything else did. God help him, Steve even missed the relentless over analysis of every little gesture…
“I know that Agent Nowak wouldn’t’ve have walked away from the love of his life, just because he couldn’t keep her, or because it was going to be painful later – and you know how I know that?” And he leant forward even further. “Because he

An accomplished smile tugged at his lips. He started running through the individual tasks that he’d completed in the last few days - more for the sense of satisfaction than to actually check his work, but hey, it couldn’t hurt.
Only to realise that he didn’t know if it was
much-
There was no conflict or confusion between Tony’s mental processes anymore. No clash between his panic reaction and his conscious intention, no time wasted on choosing a priority, no difficulty thinking about several things at once. It made his own mind feel strangely distant from him, as though he’d just been programmed to get to Steve as efficiently as possible, and now he was just watching it run…
“Okay. You know what. If something has happened between you and Tony, you
“Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?” Tony exhaled, dropping his arms. And then, because he hadn’t quite finished dismantling his fight or flight reflex, he added combatively, “why the jump scare tactics, every time?”
A cold feeling crawled up Bucky’s spine, cutting through what was left of his spacey intoxication. He knew that, on paper, it was good that Tony had said all that. He knew it should seem positive, that he should
...But he might just give himself a few minutes to sob quietly into his pillow first.
Tony felt the tension leave his shoulders, as a wave of relief crashed through him. He broke into a broad smile and bounded out to the hall, talking the stairs three at a time and eventually coming to a skidding halt by the front door.
“Yes, I have a business reception to be at,” Pepper reminded him in a sharp tone of voice. “Which I did tell you about, but seeing as you weren’t paying attention, I’ll say it again - I have plans this evening. And I

sensation. A feeling that kept threatening to burst out of him, there was just so much of it. Steve grinned, shamelessly, as he watched this group of Varians hanging off of Tony’s every word. His skin flushed as he thought about how especially lovely Tony looked, with his eyes glowing under the light of the lanterns, his hair flecked with gold…
And then lost his breath in a rush, when he saw what was inside.
Steve’s hips snapped up harder, earning him an ecstatic cry from Tony,

But, just so you know, I’m not just going to sit here while you get more and more worked up, and act weirder and weirder, and not say anything. You are getting to the stage where ‘I don’t want to talk about it’ won’t fly, my friend.”

that?
That second kiss came with a rush of overwhelming emotion, a pure, shiny elation that Tony didn’t have a word for yet - something completely out of kilter with his new, neatly ordered understanding of this thing.
“And they sparkle.”
