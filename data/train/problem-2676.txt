and the old documentary which followed.
I thought John deserved the company of someone he still likes.
“Hamish”, Mycroft drawled, a sickly sweet smile plastered on his face.
John mirrored his grin, a comforting warmth had descended on the room, and both men were practically glowing in each others contentedness. “Kids?” John asked.
Northumberland Fusiliers.” He extended a hand, which Hamish took into a brief but firm handshake.
“You were in danger!”, their son protested, heaving another breath as his lungs clambered for Oxygen. True enough, Hamish had saved them from immediate danger by expertly clouting the sniper, who was now out cold at their feet, around the head with the splintered remains of an old support beam from the factory's roof. And, in all fairness, the sniper
Benson had resurfaced at the perfect moment in their lives, and if John believed in fate at all he'd be eternally grateful to her.
John woke to the unnerving feeling of someone else's presence, a feeling soon justified as he looked up slowly from where his head was resting by his son's hand on the side of the hospital bed, to see Mycroft stood across from him. He was staring intently at the digital display of Hamish's vital signs, leaning casually on his umbrella with his left foot crossed loosely over his right. John blinked a few times, trying to clear the sleep from his vision, before sitting up straight in his chair and self-consciously brushing himself down. He glanced briefly to the clock on the wall; he'd slept for just over 90 minutes, and if he was honest he felt worse for it. The clock on the wall seemed to be struggling as he was, laboriously forcing its hands on their circuit of numbers, each tick echoing guilt at not being able to move faster and bring John closer to a time where his son would be with him again.
John cleared his throat. “Enough on me, you’ve probably read it all on the blog anyway. Trust me you don’t want to hear any more about Sherlock, I’d be here all day reeling off his endless annoyances. Tell me about your wife.” John took another sip of his tea as he settled back into his chair slightly.
for the rest of the mountains they had yet to scale.
when he was so lucky to even have it at all.
“I love you too, Dad.” He set his books down, turning over in his bed so John was left staring at his back. “…and I’m sorry”, he added in a tiny whisper before letting sleep take him.
Hamish had drifted off to sleep by the time Benson had arrived, his hand still loosely cradling a stubby pencil and his journal lying open and face down on his chest.
are you thinking, Sherlock?”
. Harmless.” George watched his old Captain's brow furrow as he considered this. Their eyes did not meet, but George took John's silence as indication enough that he could continue. “I get that you want to give him a normal life, John.” His voice was softer now, almost apologetic. “And I commend you for that, really I do. But his parents are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson- just how realistic a goal did you expect that to be?”
George cocked his head towards the mantle. "Friend of yours?"
“Particular favourite of mine”, Sherlock continues “...was the first murder you ever solved.” His eyes are shining, glistening with a mix of pride and affectionate teasing. “What was the mouse's name again, Hamish?”
There really is no excuse for how late this chapter is, so my apologies. It is, however, a relatively long chapter so hopefully that will make up for it? Please don't come to my door with pitchforks and flaming torches.
“Neither are you”, Sherlock whispered in response.
Thanks for your continued readership and for your patience.
Then came Hamish.
and John's was no competition for its intricate and delicate cogs. John couldn't read a person's life from the cuffs of their shirt or the subtle creases round their mouth and eyes. John couldn't systematically dissect the most precise workings of a criminal mind from his stride. John couldn't even so much as deduce a password without a prompt.
“The most irritatingly dull thing about criminal gangs, John, is that they are so beautifully
Sherlock was bouncing on the balls of his feet now, his eyes blown wide as he meandered through the possibilities reverberating around his mind palace. “But it does”, he said after a few seconds. “It tells us everything. There
“How you feelin’ kid?”
“In which case...” Sherlock begins, before capturing John's lips in a light kiss. Both men smile into the kiss as their son scrambles across to the other side of the sofa in a bid to get as far away from them as possible.
“Well, I’m happy with your BP and temperature,” the nurse piped up. “Someone will be round to replace your IV shortly, but shout if there’s anything else we can do to make you more comfortable.”
he'd been. Not only to have risked losing his son, but to risk losing John too. He was scared, because maybe he'd not just risked losing them, maybe he'd already lost them.
Hamish glanced at it and then back at his Dad, the desperate hope and anticipation burning in those startling blue eyes. A small nod from John followed,and the letter was opened and read.
” John turned and took two steps away, running a hand through his hair before rounding on him again. “Christ, Sherlock! Don't get me wrong, I accepted
“Indeed.” John's fists closed tighter into the hospital bedclothes.
Hamish composed another message to Sherlock, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth. He closed his eyes briefly before hitting send.
Sherlock's violin routine had halted when Hamish was born and he took to laying awake in bed in the mornings for fear that even the softest of footsteps would rouse their son from his delicate slumber. He'd sit, stifled and rigid with tension, until he felt the slight movement of John waking beside him or the gurgled babbling of his son through the baby monitor. This practice had been put to an end by John's insistence that Sherlock needn't stifle himself so heavily for the sake of not waking them. John had assured him that Hamish was a heavy sleeper and that as long as Sherlock avoided the violin and anything remotely explosive, all would be well. Not to mention that having to remain still and silent made the detective irritable, and John was always keen to nip Sherlock's black moods in the bud before they had the opportunity to evolve.
“I-I'm sorry, what?” George swallowed, his face contorting with confusion. “How did you-”
perhaps they'd reached an understanding. Apparently was wrong to ever have had the faith in them both that they wouldn't betray him and go behind his back like this. He gave a deep breath, steadying himself.
John's voice came weak, and resigned, croaking with the weight of everything he couldn't fathom into words. “You're 17 years old, 'Mish. That shouldn't have to be your concern. It shouldn't be your
The dark felt so hopeless and unforgiving. John had just expelled a small, irritated sigh when he felt a slight shift on the other side of the bed. The extension of an arm into the space between them, the brush of fingertips against his own, long fingers hesitantly lacing themselves between John's as palms met. John noted the nervous hitch in Sherlock's breathing and sought to reassure him by gently squeezing his hand. Sherlock returned this gesture before gently running the pad of his thumb over the back of John's hand in a slow and soothing circular motion. John narrowed his thoughts to focus on the soft, repetitive caress, letting the comforting familiarity of the gesture ease him slowly into slumber.
John considered this for a moment, and proceeded to pull his phone from his pocket and formulate a text.
“John...” Sherlock urged impatiently. “We need to get going.”
“Pleasure meeting you, Private Benson, but I really must dash – family business.” With that, he turned on his heel and all but skipped towards the exit.
“Oh good” John drawled, “because I was just wondering
Sherlock hardly made a murmur in response to John's comment, choosing instead to keep his eye firmly fixated on whatever was squirming on the slide under his microscope. John sighed. Smalltalk rarely engaged Sherlock on the best of days and using it to avoid the elephant in the room was clearly not going to work. John needed to tackle this head on; there was no other option. It was time for Captain Watson to take charge.
the crime scene, though he had seen the body, and the murder weapon, and the suspect that Lestrade had already (incorrectly) had arrested. Once he'd got over the initial novelty of the situation, he'd set himself to the task as he would a maths problem and contributed quite effectively and significantly to the eventual conclusion of the investigation. He still remembered the look of pure pride and joy on Sherlock's face, the small curve of his lips, the brightness of his eyes:
“Psychology? You think that's because of me?” The creases of John's brow deepened as his eyebrows seemed to knit together, seeking comprehension of Sherlock's theory.
Hamish let his fingers fly swiftly over the keys, typing out a response.
The rest of his sentence was consumed by a strangled cry. When a gunshot rang out, both Hamish and John hit the floor, John instinctively. When he looked across to his son, to see he'd hit the deck too, he sighed, the relief swarming him as he inhaled a deep and steadying breath in an effort to regain some order over his startled heart. He was out of practise.
Beat.
John would never be fully convinced of how far that was true. Old habits died hard, and it had always been a characteristic of his to hold himself accountable for the suffering of those around him. He'd always felt it was his own responsibility to help everyone. It was part of the reason he became a doctor; an attempt to ease that burden by feeling like he was at least giving something back. It backfired of course, served only to amplify this care-taking part of his personality. He couldn't shake it at the best of times, with complete strangers, but to be relieved of that weight now that it was his son unconscious in a hospital bed before him was an impossibility.
“What have we got?” Hamish and Sherlock had posed the question in perfect synchronisation.
of yours?”
In which Hamish enjoys the careers fair more than he'd anticipated.
Mycroft didn’t dare to show his face, but his input was felt. Hamish was made more than comfortable, even as the steady flow of his medication was reduced as the days passed. They were in a private ward, all press attention and communications for Sherlock were diverted. Mycroft had ensured that their time in hospital was spent in complete peace from the outside world, and as much as they loathed to admit it both John and Sherlock were grateful. Hamish underwent his treatment undisturbed and uninterrupted by press attention, and John had never been more thankful of the seemingly endless power that Mycroft possessed over everyone and everything. As the days passed, the medication that was keeping Hamish comatose was reduced, until the only thing keeping him unconscious was his own body's healing processes. John found himself afraid to sleep, to leave Hamish's side for even a second, in case he roused from his slumber. But as hours turned into days, John had to grapple with reality, even whilst desperately trying to keep one hand wrapped round his own misguided hope. His medical mind told him that there was simply no knowing how much longer the healing process would take, and he grew weary. He grew worn and frustrated.
“It's an obvious choice” Sherlock confirmed as he lowered his paper and folded it in half, resting it to one side. “The forensic side is my influence. He needs a puzzle, a mystery, something to test him and keep him occupied.” Something in Sherlock's eyes seemed to ignite, glowing with scorching excitement, anticipation, pride. “He needs the thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through his veins. That unbeatable feeling of being wrapped up in a mystery. He needs the crime, John. It's in his blood.” His gaze softened, his face softening with it into a gentle smile. “But then there's you.”
was the slow but steady sequence of beeps of his son's heart rate beside him. Hamish was still fighting, and John wasn't about to let him fight alone.
“You can't prove that!” Hamish squeals defensively.
. Whoever our culprit is, they aren't adept at this.” Hamish zoomed in on the images slightly, levelling them side by side for comparison. “See, the bruising is inconsistent between victims; messy and brutal killings, but the state of damage to the bodies decreases by the time you get to the third victim. Like he's getting more practised.”
When the surgeon emerged several excruciating hours later, still not a word had been uttered. John barely heard what he was saying to them. He was completely numb, still trapped in the muted bubble which had enveloped him as he'd begun his work on Hamish at the factory. The doctor's words washed over him as his heart finally beat a steady but deafening rhythm.
Hamish sobers and sits up straight. “I have a favour to ask of you.”
“Please, John. He needs you strong and well rested. Go. Home.”
He sits up. “Right,” he says to himself. “Let's get this done”.
“I'm not leaving him.” The words came quiet and low, but firm.
A wry chuckle escaped Hamish's lips, earning him a cautious glare from the sour looking woman sat across from him: today wasn't going to be such a bad day after all.
John opened his mouth to speak, and then closed it again, his lips forming a tight line. He was struck with the blinding realisation of the universal truth that was Hamish Oliver Watson-Holmes. His son wasn't here for the puzzle. He wasn't in it for the thrill of the chase. Sure, those elements were important to him – he enjoyed solving mysteries – after all he
John was anxious to see Sherlock, he had been for hours, and Hamish was well aware of this. Sherlock had been occupying himself at Bart's to keep the idleness of the hospital from driving him, and John, insane. But now, John was struggling to focus on his book. He was suffering the confines of the hospital too. Hamish was doing better now, he was still napping during the day, but his strength was increasing, and he was able to sit in the chair by the side of his bed for short periods. He was a long way off being able to care for himself, but he was far less dependent now.
"Dad, just go. I'll be fine."
Hamish's unsatisfactory assessment of the room's offerings was abruptly halted by the middle aged man he saw struggling through the main door across the room. He was propping the door open with one foot as he hauled his case through, followed by a display board;
of a childhood must you have had for you not to deem a single fraction of Sherlock's recent behaviour unacceptable? What kind of twisted messages and sloppy parenting did you receive for the presence of a 17 year old boy at a
“Took me feckin’ ages.” George continued, looking down into his now empty mug which he rolled absently between his hands. “Civilian life didn’t exactly sit well will me to start with. Took me a while to realise that it wasn’t life as a civilian that disagreed with me so much, but life as an amputee.” George stopped himself abruptly. He wasn’t sure how much more he should be saying, he honestly hadn’t intended on making this visit a post-war shit-story sharing session. John seemed completely at ease with the conversation though. George imagined that, like him, this was possibly the first time he’d had the opportunity to share these memories with someone who was both
John rose to meet him as the nurse excused herself. “Shit Benson. What happened?” he asked, his face stricken as he approached.
John had to do a double take. He'd been gently nodding and smiling to himself in agreement at his son's praise of Sherlock, the man he'd chosen to love, the man he'd waited 2 years  for and never given up hope on. The delay was the fault of his own lack of attention to what his son was saying, his assumption that those words were of course about Sherlock. Not once would he ever have himself believe that words which sung such praise and admirtaion were intended for him. But when the reality of Hamish's praise caught up with him, he found it difficult to breathe past the lump forming in his  throat.
“Bloody hell”, he muttered, chuckling somewhat nervously. “God, it's good to see you, Benson. Really good.”
John pressed his eyes shut once more, the creases around them swelling and becoming more prominent as a result of the stress. Then his face softened slightly, the creases smoothing themselves out as John opened his eyes again. He opened his mouth to speak, but Benson cut him off. “I know, I know.” He sighed. “
Hamish wails before mumbling something incoherent under his breath. “Give it up!” he begs.
And John tried, he fought against the guilt, he focussed on the anger and the betrayal. The pure and simple
“I had a talk to give at his school. He didn't exactly stick around though. Surprised he's not here actually, he said he was leaving for family business.”
“I’ve had better days.” came the reply.
“I take full responsibility”, he mumbled simply. Sherlock had said this on occasion before; deadpan and sarcastic, but never with the words so achingly laden with self-loathing. John was struck with the full force of the magnitude of his mistake. Sherlock was truly blaming himself, wholly and fully, holding himself accountable for the near fatal condition their son was in. Why did John feel guilty? He had a right to be angry. He'd been betrayed and lied to, the man he loved and his own
That's how they stayed that night. John, cocooned in Sherlock's arms, drifting slowly into sleep lulled by the fading footprints of the notes in the air.
John reciprocated this action, offering a dubious affirmative.
It seemed that Hamish's life was happening whilst he and Sherlock were busy engrossed in their work. How had it come to dominate their time to the extent that it'd impacted their relationship with their son like this...
“Do I even want to know where you learnt how to hack that?” John asked with a wry smile.
Sherlock's gaze flicked to where his son's bag was discarded on the kitchen table. Light, barely any books. In fact, just one, an empty notepad. One pen, Hamish wasn't even concerned enough about the content of today's lessons to consider a spare. Hamish was always concerned about lessons. Today must be different. Off timetable, Sherlock concluded, but for what? He made brief eye contact with Hamish, long enough to notice the minute movement of his head as an affirmative to Sherlock's deduction.
George held up a hand. "Don't worry about it. We've come to terms with it. Besides, got a cracking niece to make up for it.” He withdrew another photo, handing it to John as he handed back the wedding snap. John smiled down at the photo in his hands; beaming up at him was a young girl, six or seven years of age, with fiery red hair in thick waves and emerald green eyes. Freckles dappled her dimpled cheeks. George identified her as Darcy - his features illuminated by pride.
have any substantial disposable income, the suit was his most expensive item of clothing. Why wear your most valuable item to a school careers fair? Hamish let his mind skitter over the facts once more in an evaluative swoop.

even, when Sherlock expressed his anger. He tried to banish the thought, but he couldn't help being plagued by the minuscule devil of possibility that, previously, Hamish had considered his anger a price worth paying for Sherlock's pride...
“Are you going to open it?” Sherlock was staring at him now. He'd laid down his cutlery and had folded his hands neatly in his lap. John blinked slightly, pulling himself back from his thoughts.
“I'll explain when Dad comes down”. Hamish cuts him off before he can fully formulate his question. “Sit.” Sherlock eyes him suspiciously, but plonks himself down anyway, sinking into the plush cushions. He stares directly ahead into the lens, his eyes widening slightly as he notices the red light.
"I've been accepted." He said blinking slightly in disbelief. "I've been accepted by Kings."
The last thing he wanted was visitors. Sherlock, Lestrade, Mycroft – they could all go to hell. John wanted to remain in his room; him and his son cocooned in an impenetrable bubble.
“Do you even know how to ride that thing?” Benson roared after him.
with stopping anyone reading such classic prices of literature, even for such a reason as to ensure Hamish's exam success.
Nina had always been meticulous in her care of the flats and their tenants, including her aunt. Mrs Hudson was getting too old to keep scaling the stairs now, so Nina had taken the reigns. Mrs Hudson was still, in spirit, as lively as ever. John smiled at the thought of her calling up the stairs to Nina “You’re not their housekeeper, love!” - though perhaps not this time. John had a feeling that Mrs Hudson would be driving poor Nina up the wall with her endless and restless need to do something to help. She’d already sent Nina to the hospital bearing a basket of Hamish's favourite sweet treats from his childhood; cinnamon swirls, apple danishes, custard tarts.
John spun around on the spot, his face suddenly contorted by an expression that Sherlock could not place; disgust? Rage?
“Hold on. Do you mind explaining to the rest of us?”
All the more reason, John thought, to get their son out of there as soon as humanly possible. John had no doubt that, having been left behind with so little explanation and cruelly (and possibly slightly woundingly to his manhood) outrun, Benson would show up at their location in the not too distant future. Hopefully, John found himself praying, flanked by some armed officers and possibly a disgruntled and slightly ruffled Lestrade.

Lestrade visited.
. It was in this trait that Sherlock had first acknowledged that their son was simply the best of both of them in one person. His emulation of John’s moral compass was endearing, for his understanding to be so advanced at his age. Maybe he simply enjoyed the feel of the tags against his soft palms, or marvelled at the different texture. Sherlock suspected it was a longing to be as close to John as possible which would drive a young Hamish to send his tiny fingers through the small folds of fabric between John’s shirt buttons in search of the them. Hamish couldn’t possibly understand then what they were, but that didn’t mean he didn’t acknowledge their significance. He was, after all, a Holmes and thus most certainly not oblivious.
“I love you, kid”
parent. It was better that way. Everyone in 221B liked it better that way. It was less complicated.
John abruptly slammed the shower controls to the opposite position, letting the sudden rush of cold water bring him back to reality with a start.
The factory was crumbling and structurally unsound, and that was the most positive of all John's assessments. The brickwork was decaying and worn, and the resulting dust which swamped the air was illuminated by the streams of fractured light which crept through the maze of broken windows. The light was poor, however. The scale of the building and the position of the windows towards the top of its colossal walls, left a lot to be desired in terms of visibility. Some rooms, he'd discovered, were empty and deserted, the soft and now early-evening light barely penetrating their walls. Others were crowded with long since redundant pieces of machinery from the building's noble wartime effort. They remained dormant, locked in their own period, and cloaked John in a prickly unease as he'd made his initial sweep of them. He felt like an intruder; like a sharpened needle piercing the bubble of lost time the rooms were cocooned in. He knew, however, that it would be in one such room, with their labyrinths of rusty and sleeping metal workers, and their cloaking shadows, that they would find who they were looking for. The person whom, thanks to their son's timely but
Hamish choked a nervous laugh. “Dad, seriously, you want to do this
Sherlock was suddenly hauled from his thoughts by the sound of Hamish's voice, grave but laced with a tempered excitement, demanding “I need to see the other bodies. Now.” He snapped his eyes down to the body, where Hamish had pulled aside the torn and stained t-shirt to reveal, carved roughly into the flesh of the victim's back, the word
a child. No matter how much Sherlock tried to repress the idea, no matter how many times he regarded his son's tall lean frame and those features which he could manipulate to pass for a man twice his age, Hamish was still a child. That was a fact. 17 years old and still very much a child, and moments like this, just tiny and otherwise insignificant moments like this served only to amplify this assertion. Child; a word that tasted so very bitter on his tongue and so felt so very raw in his head. It brought him doubt, and there was no feeling Sherlock Holmes despised more than doubt. Bounding up to the body in front of him was a child,
“Too little, too late.” John's voice was low but harsh. “Now get out. You have no business with me or my son.”
“Oh George, I'm sorry...”
“Like the soul singer.”
people. What kind of a shitty person would I be to just selfishly sit on that for the sake of living a 'normal childhood'?”
Sherlock pulled John forcefully into his arms, forming a protective cocoon around him whilst murmuring his name into his ear.
If John could bottle the warmth that came from the knowing smile Benson shot him on that first meeting, he was certain he could market it. A smile that simply said
“What does she say?” John asked George, quietly, on one such morning, as Sarah stood by Hamish's bed once more, leaving her daily caress along his forehead. “She whispers a verse to him. Every time”, he added, by way of explanation. “It's in Gaelic, I think, so I assume you taught it to her.”
Hamish nodded. “Exactly. If they'd had a knife, they would have stabbed the victims to death – far easier and less draining than beating them with their bare hands. So, we're left to draw the conclusion that the carvings were made with the sharpest object they could gain access to; most likely a piece of broken plastic. Their blood was drawn from the force with which they had to grip it.” Hamish clasped his hands together and clenched his fists to demonstrate.
Then came the fall. Then came the three years where John Watson's faith in Sherlock Holmes was beaten and stretched and twisted and mutilated. It'd been battered and wounded, but not once broken. His faith was proven to be justified. Those years had pushed and pushed and John had reached the edge more than once, but never jumped.
Sherlock's son. But he was also John's son, and John could see this with such startling clarity now. Hamish was so achingly like his Dad; he wanted nothing more than to simply
Sorry.
. But then he saw the look on Sherlock's face again, and his fortress of rage and his flaring white-hot consciousness crumbled. He looked over to his son, wired up to machine after machine, the soft beeping indicating life, but his form still lifeless and crippled. Hamish was stable, and yet John could still feel him slipping away. He was still consumed by an unwavering sense of loss. And now, he was pushing Sherlock away too. He was overwhelmed by the urge to run to him, to take back each and every scathing word. He needed to cling to him, massage every thoughtless wound and remind himself that there was a man beneath that broken exterior that loved him. He needed to latch onto something tangible, seeking comfort where it had always been.
“You could probably help me with some Chemistry revision.”
, it was like they were family. Sherlock considered that perhaps they were; Lestrade was certainly closer to being an Uncle to Hamish than Mycroft was. Lestrade treated Hamish much in the same way he had always treated Sherlock. There was the façade of the long suffering Detective Inspector who had to tolerate the endless Holmes antics, and then there was the truth, because Lestrade cared hopelessly and endlessly about them. He always had. He'd saved Sherlock, and that was the long and short of it. He'd literally pulled him from the gutter and given him the time and attention that everyone else had failed to. Of course he'd paid the price for his generosity, more than once, but he'd treated Sherlock like a son, and Hamish was blessed with the same treatment. Sherlock had never thanked him. He never would, of course, but even Lestrade wasn't that dense – he
"We're so proud of you, 'Mish. But remember that offer is conditional upon you passing, so no more Shakespeare!" He chided mockingly, wagging his finger.
“We have a lot of talking to do, Sherlock,” he said firmly.
It hadn't taken a lot of convincing to get Sherlock to go to bed. It was less of a relief than John should have found it. Sherlock's soulless and silent compliance was just
“Who was our number two?” Hamish continued. He paused, and sniggered. “Number two”, he repeated under his breath, at which Sherlock fixed him a look, raising one indignant eyebrow, which clearly expressed sentiment along the lines of '

Hamish cast his eyes across the room to a stand for the local bank. The banker, large and balding, and evidently uncomfortable in the suit he was wearing. Maybe because it was a bit snug and he'd gained weight, more likely because of its expense. Not a fat cat banker – evident from the low quality, faux gold watch on his wrist and the age of his mobile phone; two or three years old at least, at least 3 new models had since succeeded it.

I hope that, after all this time, this chapter delivers. I've been very nervous about posting more on this for a long time. But the next chapter is already in draft. I promise not to leave it so long again...
“Two.” Sherlock affirmed this by nodding.
Mycroft grunted and staggered back slightly, releasing his grip on the handle of his umbrella and letting it fall to the floor as he clambered for purchase on the arm of the chair behind him. He dropped down into it, grimacing as he moved a hand up to run his finger tips over where a Picasso of blue and purple would soon begin to paint itself on his cheek. He looked up, recovering from the dazed expression which briefly possessed his features, and shot John an icy glare through narrowed eyes.
Hamish, you are in SO MUCH trouble young man. A few notes here:
“This whole mess is your fault, Sherlock! You better pray -” He faltered, feeling the bile thicken in his throat. “You better
John couldn't help but feel a warmth settle over him. For now at least, everything seemed to be as it always had. Sherlock was sarcastic and short but excitable, and John was well and truly up for being hauled across London in search of a killer. The situation cloaked him in a comforting nostalgia. What he wasn't in favour of, however, was his son accompanying them on this particular adventure. Hamish appeared to be well aware of this fact, and very commendably adhering to their earlier agreement. He remained seated, merely observing his parents as they laid out their course of action.
“Not your fault, mate. I knew what I signed up for.” He deployed his trademark micheivous smile. “It has its advantages...gets interesting at parties.”
telling them. This video is going to be banished to the fiery depths of digital hell.”
They followed as Hamish was wheeled from theatre, to a private ward. John assumed it was Mycroft's doing. Mycroft would have known, John didn't know, or even care, how he knew, he was just grateful that he did. There was a small basin in the corner of the room and John silently approached it as nurses worked on connecting Hamish up to drips and machines. He violently scrubbed at his hands, closing his eyes to save himself from the sight of the water running red with the blood which had caked his hands. Hamish's blood.
That was the truth of it though, wasn't it? Hamish
John cast a glance to the empty space in the left side of the wheelchair, to the now asymmetrical appearance of Benson's lower half, to where his prosthetic had once been.
A look of confusion crossed John's features. “Maybe he was just careless with the knife...that doesn't tell us anything.”
to be a-okay with you, for it not to set bloody alarm bells ringing in your head?”
Sherlock muttered.
“Because you're an idiot.” They allowed themselves a small chuckle, each remembering the first time John had said that so many years previous. John cleared his throat slightly before continuing. “This doesn't mean I forgive you. Wounds like this take a while to heal. You went behind my back, both of you, and even you aren't so emotionally inept to not realise how much that hurts. That's betrayal, Sherlock, pure and simple.” Sherlock averted his gaze, choosing to intensely examine an old acid burn on his left hand. “But I've come so close to losing Hamish today. I am not losing you too. So, if you're prepared to work through this...” he trailed off, gesticulating absently between them.
The camera wobbles slightly as Hamish adjusts it where it's sat on the mantle. He moves to shift the armchairs slightly so they are positioned neatly in frame. He pulls up a third chair from the kitchen, placing it between the two armchairs facing the camera directly. He frowns slightly, his brow furrowing as he makes a soft 'hmph' sound. Unimpressed with his setup, he moves the chairs back to their respective original places in the flat, before hauling the sofa forward. He flops onto it with a sigh, puffing out a breath and closing his eyes briefly.
John barked a disbelieving laugh. “Are your ears working okay?”
“It's 8:45, Hamish.” Sherlock stated flatly and in response Hamish gave a hefty sigh and disappeared without so much as a goodbye. They heard the click of the front door as he left, and Sherlock was already typing a message on his phone.
The nurse was kind, efficient and unobtrusive. She finally introduced herself as Jenny on her rounds the morning after John and Sherlock returned to the hospital. She always left attending to Hamish until the end of her daily rounds, so she could stay longer. John conversed with her as she checked Hamish's vitals, updated his charts and made sure he was comfortable. She was meticulous in her care of him, carrying out her duties with rigorous efficiency, and yet her temperament was one of calm auras and gentle words. John found her to be easy company, and he was endlessly grateful for the routine she provided and the kindness she granted both him and Sherlock. Even Sherlock did not mind her presence even as her stays on shift became longer and more frequent and, though he chose not to speak to her, he was neither cold nor short with her. He'd offer her a small smile of gratitude which she'd accept gracefully each morning, and that was the extent of their interactions, but neither of them seemed to mind. She never overstayed her welcome either, despite staying long after she’d completed her rounds.
Without another word, or even so much as a scornful glance, Mycroft brushed his hands over his immaculate three piece and turned on his heel. As he opened the door John added critically, “And maybe
Hamish smiled, but George noted it didn’t seem to reach his eyes. The boy who was so impassioned about the cause to help people in that lab just a few short weeks prior seemed to be a distant memory from the boy he was seeing before him now. That wasn’t to say Hamish didn’t care, it was clear he bore a large burden of responsibility with the gifts he possessed. It was clear he wanted to pursue the course he had chosen, and he was motivated to do so – fiercely so. He had his Dad’s passion, that thirst for justice and burning desire to do right by everyone burning hot and bright at the core of his being. He was painfully selfless, and George wondered whether the ‘right thing’, was necessarily the right thing
“I realised…” Benson continued, apparently reading this thought, “…that my Dad wouldn’t want me to exhaust myself trying to live up to someone else when all I ever needed to be was
“When I was your age,” he began, gaze drifting off to stare at a point beyond Hamish’s face, on the opposite wall “I lost my Dad.”
John gasped for air as he was brought violently back into consciousness, grasping at Sherlock's shirt. He nestled in as close to Sherlock as humanly possible, desperately seeking warmth and security burrowed in Sherlock's tight embrace. Sherlock clung to him, waiting patiently for the choked sobs to subside and gently kissing the top of his head.
George smiled. For all his intellect, and his extraordinary life, Hamish was so heartwarmingly
“Thank you”, was all he could offer, meekly, in response, and he continued to thank them. Daily.
to drag their son into such a dangerous and messy lifestyle.
John smiled to himself at the memory, each detail of that first chilli heightened by the one he was currently eating. He still marvelled at the knack Hamish had for combining flavours, the way he made his chilli so perfectly tuned to each of their pallets simultaneously. Sherlock so rarely ate at all, and it was unheard of for him to finish a plate of food, but he never left a single ounce of Hamish's chilli. Thinking of the way his son's proud grin spread across his face upon seeing a complete set of empty plates and his three taste testers so very satisfied with their meal, made John's heart swell in his chest. He longed to see Hamish smile like that again. He longed to have them all together, smiling like that again.
John pulled back, his face displaying a concerned frown. “You should rest that”, he said, nodding towards Benson's leg.
The blood that had seeped from the wound in Hamish's chest right under John's fingertips as the life and colour had drained from his face. The same blood which now stained the floor of that god-forsaken factory and had spread like a virus across the dusty tiles as Hamish had choked and spluttered.
“Cause of death?”
, you don't take a chair, you stand, like you've forgotten about it. That, coupled with your obvious skill at managing with the prosthetic, implies the injury was obtained some time ago. You're only in your 40s, so you could still have been serving up until very recently, but no, you were discharged years ago. Before I was born, if not shortly after. So, where has there been a major military conflict in the last 18 years involving the British and specifically your regiment? Afghanistan or Iraq.”
In the early mornings, when Hamish cried, Sherlock would be the one to go to him, soothing him back into a contented sleep or quietly playing with him to keep him happy. Sherlock insisted upon this, wanting John to sleep until it was really necessary for him to wake ready for his morning shifts at the clinic. John did his fair share overnight, but Sherlock was always the one to take on the early morning tears, successfully allowing John a precious extra hour or so of sleep. John had protested initially, feeling guilty that Sherlock had taken on sole responsibility for their son in the early hours, and feeling that he himself wasn’t effectively pulling his weight. Sherlock assured him that such guilt was ridiculous and they soon settled into the regular routine of it; Sherlock minding Hamish in the early hours, and John taking on the role of primary parent for a few hours upon his return from work to allow Sherlock to visit Scotland Yard, or perform any tests he needed to complete in peace. It suited them both, this kind of working relationship, and still allowed plenty of time for them to spend together. John's favourite mornings were weekends, when Sherlock would bring Hamish into their bedroom and John would awake slowly to the sound of his son's soft babbling from Sherlock's lap beside him. Hamish would greet John with a soft bop on the nose, and John would respond by gently pressing a kiss to easy of his son's tiny digits. They would all rise together on these mornings, John pulling his young son tightly into his arms and holding him to his chest as they moved into the kitchen for breakfast. Hamish would curl his fist around John's dog tags, clinging ever so lightly to them. This morning routine crumbled as Hamish grew older and became increasingly repulsed by early mornings; early mornings being defined as any hour before midday. And so Sherlock went back to his early morning violin recitals and John, once again, got used to waking up to find him gone from their bed each morning.
he thought to himself. He allowed himself a small chuckle as he surveyed the room for his next focus. A hairdresser; early 30s – promoting a criminally low paid apprenticeship in hair and beauty – whose recent breakup and subsequent desperation were written plainly all over her make-up caked face and low cut top.
and he was spending it in a coma.
John wanted to keep Sherlock talking, he didn't care what they said to each other, he just needed to bathe in the soothing rumble of Sherlock's voice. The richness of it, like silk or velvet on his ear drums, would lull him into something close to relaxation. He wanted to wrap himself in the charming tones of it, let it hum gently in his ears. However, for the first time, keeping Sherlock Holmes talking seemed like a challenge of impossible magnitude. No words would come, John's tongue was barren, unable to nourish the seeds of conversation. Every godforsaken word in the entire English dictionary was inadequate; their offerings were hollow and meaningless. And so nothing but the hushed melody of their combined breaths penetrated the silence as they both stared up at the ceiling.
Massive thanks to my friend Lea for helping me out with this chapter by RPing some of the dialogue out with me to get the ideas going! It was a huge help my sweet, and the fact that this chapter came out so long is a testament to how much of your input I felt I just had to use! This chapter is dedicated to you, my dear.
were, him and Sherlock, to have their son. He was angry with himself. Angry with Sherlock. Angry that he ever let something jeopardise
Quick thanks to everyone reading thus far, I've never thanked you before and I should have. So, ta very much. :)
“John.” The response came back low and hoarse. Sherlock sounded worn and John imagined he looked worse – withered and drained. John sat up on the bed, making space for Sherlock in a silent plea for him to come closer. John was still angry, and he still wanted to punch the detective, but not half as much as he just needed the comfort and security that only he could offer.
John had not said a word. Not even to Sherlock; he didn't even meet his eyes. Even as they sat in the back of an ambulance, their son unresponsive between them, John said nothing. Even as they waited in the bland and hauntingly empty corridors of the hospital, with their clinically white walls. As surgeons battled to save Hamish, battled to prevent his lung collapsing and to stem the flow of blood from his chest. John said nothing.
Hamish groans and buries his face into the nearest cushion. “Mr Snuffles”, comes the muffled reply.
“Because he was my hero. I got this feeling I couldn’t explain. Like my heart was filling up with memories of my Dad, with everything he’d ever achieved, and everyone he’d ever touched. Everything he’d ever been. I was so proud to be his son, and so desperate to echo what he lived for that I didn’t leave myself any room to feel anything else, or be anything else. It didn’t hit me until I found the army. I’d never known a feeling like it. The excitement. I realised I wasn’t happy before…I wasn’t even me.”
Sherlock was silent, as he always was when faced with his own humanity. There was a time where he'd grunt in discontented opposition, contest any implication that somewhere within him there was the capacity for sentiment. Now, however, it merely silenced him. He'd withdraw to wallow in his own discomfort, still terrified by the vulnerability that his heart exposed him to. He didn't object to it as vehemently as in those early days, he just allowed the words to stagnate in the air. John's brow would always furrow at the way Sherlock's mouth formed a tight line, baffled by the detective’s propensity to still shy away from the way his heart sometimes betrayed him. He'd given himself to John over the years, and heaven knows they'd had numerous conversations about the ideas that Mycroft had planted in Sherlock's head from a young age about love's definition as nothing more than a dangerous weakness. They'd started as arguments; John's frustration manifesting itself, but then John's approach shifted. Arguing with Sherlock Holmes to try and change his steadfast beliefs about love was as effective as a chocolate teapot, and so John devoted his time to making sure Sherlock was loved so wholly and deeply that he could do nothing but reap the benefits.
Private George Benson is based on a real soldier. He fought with the Northumberland Fusiliers in the Great War (The First World War) and was enlisted in Nenagh, Co. Tipperary in 1917 and died in the same year.
As Hamish got stronger over the coming days, he used his waking time productively, requesting various text books and journals to be brought from the flat and studying them intensively whilst scrawling almost illegible notes on various post-it notes and scraps of paper. The variety of text books that had been lined up, snugly and neatly nestled against each other on Hamish's bookshelf, was surprising. John had anticipated that, having a similarly scientific mind to Sherlock, Hamish's course books would consist of the sciences, perhaps interspersed with a few mathematical texts. To an extent, he was right. To one end of the perfectly alphabetised collection were two Chemistry text books, followed by a thick Engineering study guide, but subsequent texts threw John slightly. Three perfectly leather bound history books; one's gold title proclaiming it as a complete guide to the second World War, the second a comprehensive guide to British foreign policy 1910-1960, and the third a student's guide to the Third Reich and the Rise of Fascism in Europe. He smiled to himself, remembering a particular Thursday afternoon some 10 years previous, with an 8-year-old Hamish lying on his stomach, head resting in his palms, in front of the TV; thoroughly entranced by Guy Hamilton’s
"Yes sir!" Hamish rejoined, giving a salute.
” Hamish descended the stairs, shoulders slumped slightly, and his satchel slung haphazardly over his shoulder. His school tie sat at a skewiff angle round his neck.
“Spare me your bloody power complex induced bullshit and listen to me
have my family suffer because of your ego.” John paused and then straightened, before Mycroft rose from his seat and drew a sharp breath to compose himself. John was suddenly acutely aware of the volume he'd reached during his rant as he noticed that the nurses across the hall had averted their attentions to the source of the commotion.
“I fail to see-”
“Procrastinating”, Hamish clarified matter-of-factly.
The soft reverberation of each note, the gentle caress of each sound, sang of those serene and lazy Sunday mornings. They chimed of the laughter of a little boy bouncing energetically on his parents' bed, his squeals as he was tackled into the duvet and tickled into submission. They carried the scent of powder and honey suckle and the touch of tender finger tips grasping at thin air and seeking purchase in the soft cotton of John's shirt.
“It's just a run of the mill triple homicide, John.” Sherlock replied dismissively.
I'm back...anyone still out there?
There was a rumbling chuckle as George's mouth creased into a wry but amused grin. “Son, if I had a pound for every time I'd heard that one in my 40 years, I wouldn't be doing the rounds of London's secondary schools every year.” He sobered up, clearing his throat and straightening himself, shifting his weight onto his right leg and smoothing down his jacket, as though he'd just remembered why he was there and who he was supposed to be representing. “So, interested in a career with your nation's armed forces, eh?” He offered Hamish a leaflet, which he took without acknowledgement and folded into the inside pocket of his blazer.
and his heart stuttered once more before kicking back into its rhythm. John looked back to his hands, still stained with the reddish brown of his son's blood. He'd not made a move to wash them. He'd not even thought to.
“Why?”
“That was
Hamish responded in kind, “Uncle”. He pulled the door closed before adding dryly, “Managed to find time in your busy schedule of being the British Government for family? How gallant of you.”
I know how these things end. People get hurt!” John was visibly bristling now, his chest heaving with the pent up anger.
no knife, John.”
he chastised himself.
“It's not for me.”
to know everything, and yet he'd not picked up on the fact that Hamish had been working away at a University application. Were they really both paying him such little attention? John couldn't fight the sinking feeling in his stomach; the guilt. What else had they missed? What kind of a terrible parent didn't know that their child was applying to University? John had always pictured himself helping his son with things like this, guiding him through the application process, accompanying him on Open Day visits to the institutions he'd chosen. John considered the possibility that perhaps Sherlock was right, and that Hamish had wanted to keep it as a surprise until he was certain he'd successfully been offered a place, but he couldn't help but feel like he'd missed out on a huge part of Hamish's life. University was a milestone, it was a big deal and John would never forgive himself for not seeing Hamish through that. No wonder he'd been stressed. John had just assumed it was nothing more than exam stress and teenage angst. He hadn't even
“Chisenhale?” Sherlock's eyes flickered slightly with a dawning realisation. “
John felt Sherlock's hand slipping into his own, their fingers intertwining. Sherlock gave his hand a reassuring squeeze, small and almost intangible, but enough. John nodded, swallowing thickly as Hamish led them both back into the lab. George straightened as they entered the room, offering John a small, warm smile;
“Private George Benson, formally of the 5
“Bloody hell.” He cast his eyes back over to the fireplace. “And the cluedo?” he enquired with a mirthful smirk.
You trust your comrades to keep you safe. You trust your regiment with your life as they trust you with theirs. You watch each others' backs. Nothing can ever replicate the bond a Captain has with his men, his colleagues, his
“I don’t”, his son replied nonchalantly, without raising his gaze from the page in front of him.
“Benson. Keep him occupied.” He tilted his head slightly in his son's direction. “Stay out of trouble. That applies to the pair of you.”
He settled for “It wasn't your fault.” Because that's the sort of thing people said, wasn't it? That was the sort of thing people like John needed to hear. It had the added benefit of being the truth; John really wasn't to blame. He may have believed he should have done something more, but in reality there was nothing more he
Just the once. Long enough to offer his best wishes and an uncomfortable apology. John found himself bristling through the entire encounter, his sour mood increasing tenfold and threatening to surge from him at any moment. Sherlock was rigid, uptight and cold, and Lestrade was not so dense as to not take the hint. He swiftly made his excuses and left, but the tension in the room still crackled in the air. It sparked like electricity, flooded the room like gas teasing at the air, waiting for the igniting spark.
“Interesting hypothesis”, Hamish acknowledged, looking up at him. “But wrong I'm afraid. At least to an extent. Are you seriously telling me you buy into the 'two typologies' crap? Murderers don't all fit into one of two categories, Greg.”
“He'd want you to.” Sherlock assured him.
“Thinking” he responded simply. John heard an intake of breath and saw the shadow in the window tense. “I owe you both a thousand apologies.”
“Have either of you thought about what I want?” Both men snapped their gaze suddenly to meet Hamish stood in the doorway. Neither of them had registered his arrival, and John inwardly cursed, worrying to himself about how much of their exchange their son had played witness to. Hamish straightened slightly, drawing a short breath before continuing. “I can't have a normal childhood, Dad. I tried.” He swallowed, running one hand through his sandy curls. “Believe me I've
“Ah. Well, actually I was about to come and get you.” He moves to the doorway, most of his body now out of shot, just one foot remaining visible as he calls up the stairs to John. “Dad! Hurry up and get down here!” Sherlock has noticed the camera by now and looks squarely down the lens, cocking his head slightly.
The toast popped and Hamish applied copious amounts of strawberry jam with a swift mechanical motion, before turning and heading into the sitting room. He flopped onto the sofa with Sherlockian grace. “Apparently not.” John muttered.
“Oh Christ. Don't worry, I'm

a child and that Sherlock shouldn’t be jealous of his son's admiration of the scientific and technological ingenuity of Tony Stark. John had also told him that he shouldn't periodically interrupt the Iron Man movies by pointing out any inaccuracies, however major he saw them to be.)
He silently placed the Shakespearean literature he was still clutching on the end of the bed, before moving over to Hamish's side. He leant down, planting a gentle kiss  on the mop of blonde unruly curls which covered Hamish's head. As he moved away, replacing the tender gesture with a gentle ruffle of his hands  through Hamish's hair, his other hand went to the letter that had been pressed closed to his heart. He withdrew it, and without a word pressed it into his son's  hands.
“I was
They'd be okay. With or without Sherlock.
And then it caught up with him, at the same time that the shock wore off and it registered with Hamish too. His son was clutching at his chest, gasping and desperately scrambling for air, the warmth of his own blood spreading across his hand and chest. John didn't think then. He didn't recall how he'd got to his son's side, but he was there now, clutching him desperately as Hamish tried to mouth the word 'sorry' as he violently choked, the crimson of his own blood staining his lips and face as it forced its way from his mouth.
“Try again.” Sherlock was stood behind him, obviously having followed his line of sight and read Hamish's deduction plainly in his face. “Look closer. Come on Hamish it's in the
Wow this chapter turned into a long one.
Sherlock Holmes had never been so taken with another human being in all his life. The way he looked at Hamish, the way he'd cradled him as a baby, the way he would affectionately stroke that mop of soft, blonde curls – it startled the air from John's lungs. These moments left John feeling so beautifully blessed, and the startling clarity they gave him simultaneously stopped and then restarted his quivering heart.
John nodded, and without a further word drew his thumb along the seal to open the envelope in one swift motion. The letter inside was printed on quality paper, topped with the King's College coat of arms baring the college motto
“John-”
And just like that he was thinking of Sherlock again, his heart aching slightly as it offered a weak plea for Sherlock's presence. John withdrew himself from those thoughts by mentally reciting the scientific and medical terminology for every inch of the body which his food would pass on its journey through his digestive system. He followed this by recalling the nutritional value of every ingredient in the meal he'd just consumed. Occupying his mind and neutralising his thoughts was becoming a harder task to manage, and it was draining him.
Hamish gasps, leaping across the sofa to clasp a hand over Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's grin is obvious even under his son's hand, and a pink flush creeps across Hamish's cheeks. John sees fit to continue the assault with a remark of his own.
Sherlock had always said John was lousy at observing – he was right, to an extent. Sherlock's mind was electric and wired and
John's brow creased, his eyebrows forming the perfect model of discontent as he opened his mouth to speak. Hamish cut him off. “Forget it. Fine I was reckless. But it's not just about that is it? You don't get it. I can do this. I'm
John calmed, and so Sherlock cautiously probed.
George blinked several times, opening his mouth briefly before forcing it closed again before he could stammer a humiliatingly weak response. He quickly collected himself, however. “Afghanistan.” Hamish nodded, as if to confirm that he thought as such. “Bugger me. That was feckin' fantastic, if you'll pardon m' French.”
Sherlock smirks. Point taken. Hamish settles himself next to Sherlock, who has reached over the arm of the sofa to retrieve John's laptop and is now furiously typing away, obviously trying to occupy himself whilst they wait for John to make an appearance.
Benson gave a small salute and a wide grin in acknowledgement, and before another word could be uttered, Sherlock had left the room in a flurry of coattails, with John close behind.
John sat up in bed, straining his ears to pick out some sign of the detective from the silence of the flat, but he detected nothing but silence. It was disconcerting. Sherlock's violin had become his silence to the point where complete silence was both alien and down right terrifying. His breath hitched, his breathing halted and his body stiffened completely, as his ears desperately sought some sign of the detective. John's heart and lungs stuttered back into a relieved rhythm as the soft sound of Sherlock's bow drawing out three long and low notes across the strings of his violin drifted in a gentle whisper through the flat. Another silence followed, but John was at ease with the delicate resonance of the last three notes still tickling the air and lightly gracing his ear drums. Another note, this time shorter and a little higher, trembled under the meeting of the bow and strings as John made his way through the flat.
The poster over Hamish's desk, however, had seen each of its companions come and go whilst not moving itself – not even once. It had been pinned in its current position since they'd bought it nearly 12 years ago. Now John thought about it, it was a strange choice for a 6 year old; the glossy image of a Lancaster Bomber. Sure, it was perfectly normal for young boys to like planes, in the same way they liked cars or motorcycles or spaceships – because they were fast and exciting and noisy. But the high resolution image of such an old and iconic aircraft was surrounded by tiny blueprint diagrams of different parts of its engineering, and John couldn't help but think that there was more to the selection of that poster than simply a naive and boyish fascination with speed. He'd never considered it before, he hadn't even realised it was still on the wall after all this time. Did he really not come into Hamish's room anymore? Not even to check on him or say 'hello' after he came in from school? Maybe he wasn't paying his son enough attention any more, maybe that's how they'd become so distant. John sighed, silently vowing to himself to not waste a single morsel of their time together, and wishing with all his heart that he could have back every second he should have spent with his son. The work really had got in the way of them as a family, and maybe it wasn't just Sherlock who had trouble making a distinction between the two after all.
John sighed. “This wasn't big or clever, Hamish. Do you realise how seriously you could have been hurt?” His voice was a mixture of aching concern and heartbreaking resignation. “It's bad enough your Father being a reckless idiot, without you blindly following him...”
“So,” John began, hands curling around the warm ceramic. He couldn't have sounded more awkward, but just where did someone start when addressing a person they'd only ever known in a war zone? Sure, John had respected George – he was a promising young private, his head was screwed on and he was clued up – and he'd genuinely liked the guy, they'd got along well, but so much time had passed and they'd shared so many horrific memories. Was it really possible for a friendship to remain between them, the way it had, with so much guilt weighing on him? John had to be honest with himself and acknowledge the fact that he hadn’t really thought about George all that much over the last 20 years – life with Sherlock doesn’t allow a lot of time for quiet contemplation. But sometimes he’d think of him when he woke up from his nightmares; a flash of his face as he was slowly brought back into consciousness. One thing was certain though, John was bloody glad to see him. He hadn't realised how much he'd missed company that wasn’t Sherlock or Hamish. He
“You're not asleep”, John remarked into the darkness of their bedroom.
Benson shot back a lopsided grin. “Always wanted to be a military intelligence officer – it's something of a hobby. And it's not

. He almost wanted them to have an argument about Sherlock's apparent disregard for his own health; he wanted Sherlock to tell him how much of a waste of time sleep was, John wanted to retaliate and plead with Sherlock to at least get a few hours for the sake of his own sanity if nothing else. At least that would carry some element of normality. It'd be exhausting, but the right kind of exhausting. It'd be impossible and irritating, but anything was better than how emotionally strenuous Sherlock's current state was. John hated it. It wasn't Sherlock.

“Has Dad told everyone my news?” Hamish said in mock annoyance.
Sherlock tuts disapprovingly, sinking further into the sofa and pouting. “If she's
Sherlock's eyes remained fixed on the floor. He couldn't look. He couldn't meet John's eyes for fear of what of what he might see there; he couldn't bear to face it. Now he was sure, so certain he'd made the wrong choice. He'd never doubted himself before, other than that one time at Baskerville. He wasn't used to doubting himself, being wrong. If he was honest with himself, he would admit that somewhere, buried so very deep in the back of his mind that he ignored it, he knew that this had been the wrong path to go down. The only person who could ever confirm or deny that assertion was John. It had only ever been John. And now John had confirmed Sherlock's worst nightmares, because he couldn't look John in the eyes, and that was enough to confirm how far he had strayed, how much he'd abused John's trust. He couldn't bear to see the disappointment on John's face, he couldn't bear to see that final proof that he'd made a wrong turn somewhere along the line. Now he was so hopelessly lost.There was a time when those brilliant blue eyes were a lighting beacon, but now they wouldn't be bright. They'd be dark and sorrowful, but the blame and disappointment in them would be blinding. The
“Unfortunately, Hamish is as emotionally inept as his Father when it comes to admitting his feelings, so you should probably make the first move.” His light chuckle snowballs into a full round of belly laughs when he notices the horror on Hamish's face accompanied by the irritated glare from Sherlock. “You two are such a
Mycroft's nose wrinkled in displeasure, and Hamish smirked triumphantly. He'd always taken great delight from his Uncle's disgruntled expressions. There was no malice in it, it was simply boyish hijinks, and if Mycroft was true to himself he'd probably admit that he secretly enjoyed it. The constant tit-for-tat exchanges were a strange form of affection, but Hamish had long since resigned himself to the fact that it was just
“We're supposed to be singing from the same hymn sheet, Mycroft.” John pressed his lips together as he rounded the end of Hamish's bed, closing the gap between himself and the other man. Being shorter than him didn't mean he couldn't crowd him, rise to his full height in a defensive manner. “We had an agreement,” he continued, his voice remaining level and steady but unmistakably laced with a
Time would pass easily with George and Sarah. It became less like trudging through mud, the endless expanse of a Somme-like battlefield, and more like a gentle stroll, as though the same expanse had blossomed, sprouting the life of long grass peppered with red and white flowers.
“Do you realise how feckin' bizarre that is to witness, lad?” The question came in melodious Irish tones. Hamish placed the accent almost immediately: County Tipperary. He quirked an eyebrow, urging him to continue. Whatever he was going to say, Hamish had deemed it worthy of listening to. Something in the way this man had looked at him made Hamish intrigued to discover what he had observed. He continued as he rounded the table, setting out the leaflets across it's surface. “The way your demeanour shifts like that. Wee bit Jekyll and Hyde, don'cha think?”
“My only condition”, John said finally, shattering the somewhat uneasy silence that had fallen. “You stay out of the firing line. You solve what you can from here. The rest, your father and I will deal with. And don't you two go thinking you're out of the woods yet, either. This isn't over.” He cleared his throat a little. “What do we know?” he asked, peering over Hamish's shoulder at the screen of Sherlock's laptop. Sherlock took a seat, remaining silent and nodding slightly as a cue for his son to begin outlining the case. Hamish pulled up a series of images which filled the screen, photos of each of the victims in turn.
John frowned slightly. In Gaelic, the words carried such a heartfelt sincerity in Sarah's rehearsed whispers that he couldn't help but be moved by them, but their English counterparts seemed ill-fitting and out of place. The translation proved to be a blessing that was seemingly alien from a woman who was essentially a stranger to his son. Sure, John appreciated the sentiment it carried, and the blessing was sweet and smooth like honey in Sarah's polished tones, but its English meaning felt foreign in the air between them.
“And where have you been?” Sherlock rose from his seat and turned his back to head towards the window. His silhouette filled the window frame, the dark shadow almost ghost-like. He remained silent. “Sherlock” John added in a warning tone.
“You’re reading that just for fun?” John inquired, somewhat taken aback.
“He's doing better,” Mycroft remarked, without so much as tearing his gaze away from the figures and oscillating lines on the screen. His tone was bland and almost nonchalant, and John visibly bristled in response. Sometimes Mycroft's talent for maintaining his composure was insulting and John found himself mentally damning Mycroft to hell for his lack of heart regarding his own nephew. Did the man not posses a morsel of compassion, or a single ounce of sympathy?
“Hamish”, came the muffled response against his chest.
John barked a laugh and clapped him on the back. “Take a seat, I'll put the kettle on.”
“I'm serious,” he continued, his voice grave. “You need to go home. Get washed, change into to fresh clothes. Get a decent meal down you and
family business.” He launched himself up from his chair, pacing to the other side of the room and running a hand through his hair. “Sherlock's taken him to a bloody crime scene.” George didn't have to be a genius to work out how very not okay this was. He could clearly see John's internal conflict flashing across his features. He could see the muscles in John's arms drawing tight as he clenched his fists. He startled slightly when John slammed his fist down onto the kitchen table, then eliciting a furious, almost growl-like noise from his mouth. John turned back to face his friend, his face falling slightly. He sighed.
and he couldn't bear it. Hamish couldn't either. Anger, he knew how to deal with – letting his Dad cool off before apologising and ensuring him that he loved him – he could cope with that. Parents were supposed to get angry and frustrated and infuriated with their kids, much like it was almost in the job description of the children to rebel and try their patience over and over again. But disappointment was a whole other ball game. Disappointment was wrought with complexities; it was thorny and difficult to navigate, and Hamish felt so utterly helpless being confronted with it. Anger was easy to reverse because it had a simple and polar opposite. To expel anger Hamish could simply install a state of calm, reinstate happiness and provide a reminder of just how much love he had to give his Dad, but what was the opposite of disappointment? Disappointment had a firm and icy grip, seizing and debilitating, and the object of its focus had no control or possession of a remedy.
In his late teenage years, Hamish had converted his room to suit a more minimalist theme than its previous childhood incarnations. The walls were bare aside from the cork pin board above the head of the bed – displaying various family photos, photos of Hamish when we was young, letters and cards of particular sentimental value, and a few autographs, the most central of which was a signed polaroid of an 8 year old Hamish and his favourite formula 1 driver – and one solitary poster above his desk at the opposite side of the room. The various pin-sized holes across the room told of the different posters which the walls had seen over time; posters which were taken down and replaced as Hamish traversed different phases and adopted different interests. The presence of some was more fleeting than others. Those walls had certainly seen variety, from a borderline obsessive admiration of Buzz Aldrin when he was 9, to the various Marvel posters which had graced the light blue walls. John smiled to himself, remembering fondly the day he'd introduced Hamish to the Avengers when he'd come across some of his old comics whilst searching for something else – the identity of which had long since escaped him. Hamish had been engrossed in them, despite Sherlock's mutterings that such pursuits as comic books and superheroes were nonsensical and childish. (John had, of course, pointed out that Hamish
"I should go back and clean the flat up a bit," John remarked into the silence of the St Bart's lab that Sherlock had confined himself to.
“What the bloody hell are you doing here?” John asked, still disbelieving. “Christ, Benson it's been what...”
I really enjoyed writing Hamish in this chapter; it's really quite fun to play with such a diverse range of characteristics from both John and Sherlock and form them into just one character, but I am still finding my feet with 'Mish so do please bear with me.
of John in their own right. Sherlock would always wonder if Hamish sensed this, appreciated their true value. His emotional intelligence was stunningly finely tuned, he’d always been able to detect the slightest shifts in moods. He was observant on a level Sherlock wasn’t, he observed
“Oi. Enough of the cheek you”, John chastises, but in a mirthful tone. He barely even casts a glance and the rearranged furniture, apparently used to things in the flat going amiss. He moves round the back of the sofa, placing his arms over Sherlock's shoulders as he moves in to place a kiss on his cheek. Ignoring the disgruntled noise coming from Hamish, he moves to touch his lips lightly at Sherlock's neck.
It was John who eventually broke the spell of silence which had descended as they picked at their breakfast.
George Benson was under the impression the unpredictable days were behind him. 5 years in the British army and two tours of Afghanistan were enough to saturate anyone's pallet for adventure. He'd long since succumbed to the gentle and unassuming lull of civilian life. Life was unremarkable and he had come to like it that way. The last time he'd allowed the lure of excitement to entwine him in its trap he'd ended up in a war zone and yet, when an extraordinary young man threw him completely off kilter on a perfectly ordinary morning doing his perfectly ordinary job in a perfectly ordinary school, he'd found himself blazing that same old trail again.
What were they doing here? Doubt. An ugly and destructive element against which Sherlock had endured a relentless struggle, and here it was again raising up on its hind legs and thrashing violently through his mind palace. But when Sherlock saw the way Hamish looked up at him, his eyes searching and full of hope and expectation; a begging to be noticed and approved of and
Hamish rubbed a hand anxiously at the back of his neck. “Erm...internet.” He chuckled slightly to himself. “Anyway, turns out I was right.” Hamish beamed, and Sherlock rolled his eyes as if to say
As the rhythm of Sherlock's strokes dropped into a slower and deeper tone, John was struck with the desperate but heart warming familiarity of it. He was struck blind by the memory that swarmed his synapses, neurons coordinating in a gallery of nostalgic images.
Just like that, John had gone full circle and ended up back at
As the two men marched through the corridors of St Bart's, George could see Sherlock and Hamish in a lab two doors down. As they approached he could see Hamish bent over a microscope, slowly twisting at two knobs on either side and squinting as he tried to analyse what was on the slide beneath. Behind him, Sherlock was pacing through the aisle between two workstations and talking out loud, gesticulating wildly as he theorised, with Hamish seemingly adding small remarks or affirmatives as Sherlock reeled off his deductions.
“You’d be better off telling him that, Dad.” Hamish remarked with a chuckle.
The next 11 days in the hospital limped by.
They both thanked her as she left the room.
John didn't read any further. He was certain the joy had blinded him.
, John. It's human nature. It's understanding. It's sentiment.” The detective averted his eyes, directing them to inspect an old burn mark on the table. “It's you”, he added in a quiet murmur.
“Watch it,” George warned mockingly, “I’ll be telling your Dad you’ve got a potty mouth!”
Hamish rolled his eyes mockingly, “Dad. Seriously. Go. I’ll call Benson if I get too bored.”
John let out a good natured laugh, smiling broadly. He watched as George returned his smile, and followed his gaze where it had settled behind him on the skull that had become such a normal presence in the flat.
The match was struck, and the explosion was deafening.
Sorry again for how long this chapter has taken to get to you, but I hope you enjoyed it regardless!
“Good. Now, see what you can tell me about the body.” Sherlock began walking back towards the unfortunate 30-something splayed out on the ground, but Hamish remained where he was.
John found himself having to confiscate the heavy collaboration of pages from his son out of principle, so he would actually get on with some proper studying for his exams. He scoffed a laugh at the situation. There was something completely alien and just
“He knew it would irritate you”, Hamish shot back bitterly, “which I'm judging to have been a correct assessment.”
“Organised offender.” Lestrade piped up. “They position the body; murders are usually well thought out.”
day he had ahead of him. He was certain Sherlock would have objected to John's insistence that he go to school. Evidently he was wrong. The disappointment actually stung. He grimaced to himself: the thought of spending the day listening to endless drivel about making the 'right choices' and 'leaving your options open' and 'formulating a career path' was almost physically painful. He could already feel the headache coming on. As he boarded the next train to pull up at the platform, his phone buzzed in his pocket.
He always felt a fool for needing it so desperately at times like this. Sherlock loved him and that was certain. Except, maybe at times like this it almost wasn't.
Hamish simply rolls his eyes and continues. “Friend of mine has a birthday coming up...I wanted to record a little message for her.”
And we briefly revisit the wonderings of a certain Private Benson.
Hamish's brow furrowed, and his lips curled into a tight curve of displeasure. Apparently this man was more observant than Hamish usually gave the general populous credit for. Nobody had ever noticed those tiny movements before; the way his shoulders stiffened suddenly, like he was suddenly remembering himself having lapsed for a moment in letting his usual façade slip. Hamish Watson-Holmes was trapped between the two halves of himself – his parents – and the only problem was working out which side was Jekyll and which was Hyde. He feared they were both an eclectic mix of the two. This man was right though, there were two distinct parts to Hamish and, whilst not a single person had noticed before, when he made the transition, the difference between the two was quite startling. There was John; the side that had helped this man without missing a beat. Then there was Sherlock; the side that had snapped back into the icy cold exterior, silently cataloguing every minute detail of this man from behind glazed blue eyes. Details such as the dulling bronze insignia badge pinned to the man's blazer: the image of a rearing horse – it's proud mount wielding a flag, arm stretched towards the heavens...or indeed the crown of flame-like whisps which topped the badge. Despite the deterioration of its sheen, the majority of the lettering was still identifiable, not that Hamish needed them – he recognised the badge's origin without their prompting.
John reached across the table to take Sherlock's hand in his own. He gave it a light, reassuring squeeze and offered a soft smile. “It's you too, you know. 18 years ago I wouldn't have said the same but...” he took a long drag of air before continuing. “That humanity is as much from you as it is me, Sherlock.”
“Urgh.
“How dare you.” Mycroft was almost snarling now, spitting his words like venom. John could not help the sense of triumph that washed over him at seeing Mycroft Holmes with his feathers so violently ruffled. He had to sharpen his focus in order to keep the flicker of amusement from announcing itself in a small smirk on his face. “Do you realise-”
John clears his throat. “So, you just want us to say Happy Birthday?” Hamish nods. “What's her name...this
“But this time,” John continued. “You couldn't be more wrong. You think I'm only doing this for Hamish's sake.”
Part of John was yearning to see him, to hold and to soothe him, and still, there was a part of him that knew he couldn't face Sherlock just yet. He was torn between worrying about whether he'd end up pulling Sherlock out of a gutter somewhere in some shadowy corner of the city and telling himself that he was supposed to be angry beyond reason. Because he
He made it his mission, one which he embarked upon with furiously passionate devotion. Anyone else would have failed to register the effects it had on the detective. They still saw the cold, impenetrable exterior they'd always known, but John could see that his efforts had not been in vain. He saw it in those softened gazes and adoring smiles he was blessed with. He felt it in the gentle touches, the ghosting of skin on skin, the subtle caresses, the way Sherlock would reach for John's hand in the back of a cab. This evolved into minuscule and almost undetectable changes in Sherlock's behaviour in those frequent cab rides; the way John could feel just a slight increase in the heat from Sherlock's body, a slight and gradual decrease in the inches of those worn back seats between them. He could hear it in Sherlock's compositions, see it in the contrast between his lazy gracing of strings and the carefree and jovial movements he made around the flat as he played when noone but John was watching. Later, John saw it in the way Sherlock gingerly cradled their son, the way his mouth formed a lazy but radiant smile. He heard it in Sherlock's quiet murmurs to Hamish as he was sleeping.
“You.Did.What?”, he'd demanded through gritted teeth.
Hamish's lips curled upwards slightly as he went to take another bite of his toast.
The camera is jostled once more as it's snatched from Hamish's hands, and John's beaming face fills the screen. “Shame, we'll just have to invite her over then. I'll be sure to send an invitation along with the tape.” The image blurs slightly as John runs with the camera, Hamish just visible over his shoulder in hot pursuit as he rounds the corner into the kitchen. “Happy Birthday, Léa!”, John adds finally, his laughter mingling with Sherlock's to drown out Hamish's resigned sigh as the camera is switched off.
Sherlock cuts him off abruptly, giving him a withered look. “Don't be obtuse, John, she knows who you are.”
“Bare minimum doesn’t get you into Kings.”
John rolled his eyes. “Are you seriously telling me you've downed beer out of that thing?” George's smirk gave John the answer.
that the words 'triple homicide' would become fairly frequent flyers in the Watson-Holmes vocabulary, but
Without a word, Benson place his mug on the floor next to his feet, and stood up. When John cast him a weary and questioning look, he said simply “Get in touch with whoever it is you need to. I'll drive.” John silently considered this for a few seconds before George insisted “No arguments.”
(See the end of the chapter for
” he exclaims through the laughter. Hamish, having let his guard down, has released Sherlock's mouth, and Sherlock takes the opportunity to speak again.
He added the city to the list of things he loved which had screwed him over today.
“He’s definitely your son”, Mycroft had once remarked, his face contorted with a look utter disdain. Sherlock had simply beamed, Hamish replicating a characteristically Sherlockian smirk in the face of Mycroft’s disgust.
Both men had lost track of the time they'd been laying there, staring blankly into the shadows cloaking the room. The silence wasn't consumed by suffocating tension, it was just empty. Empty and thoughtless. They'd both been lost, thinking but not really. Neither of them really had the capacity or energy to think of anything, but the weight of everything seemed to crush their chests whilst simultaneously pressing from the inside, forcing its way up their throats.
Trust is a peculiar thing.
“Shut up and
"And enough of the cheek," John added, ruffling his son's hair again.
Sherlock was definitely not the model of reliability, or even truth. Hell, Sherlock had pulled the wool over John's eyes more times than he cared to remember and the man's timing left a lot to be desired. As he sat on that splintered chair in that darkened tramway, a rusted but deadly bolt aimed precisely at Sarah's heart, and the death defying situation waiting for him like an old friend, he'd realised how dangerous it was to trust a man like Sherlock Holmes. He also realised he didn't care, because that's what trust was about wasn't it? Unwavering faith. Trusting someone with your own life is one thing, trusting them to save someone else's is another – John had known at that point he was well and truly screwed – but not once did his belief in Sherlock's ability falter.
John demanded, cutting him off. Mycroft seemed partially stunned into obedience as he clamped his lips together. John's sudden outburst had evidently startled the older Holmes. He had always displayed such a ferocious and yet stubbornly collected defiance in the face of anything Mycroft threw his way. Mycroft had come to expect it, rejoining and meeting it with his own steely composure. It was something of a non-conservative yet strangely comfortable arrangement between them, unspoken, but there nonetheless. It suited them both. There was a level of familiarity with the ever present underlying tones of friction. Both parties had come to expect the silent give and take, and honoured it for Sherlock's sake.
Before John could even think about what he was doing, his body was acting without him; his fist collided heavily and squarely with jaw of the British government.
Eventually, John puffed out a breath and slumped backwards, pressing his back further into the passenger seat. He closed his eyes, drawing long steady breaths in through his nose and expelling them through his slightly pursed lips.
Sherlock shifts slightly under the touch. “As much as I'd like to reciprocate this action, John” he begins. “We are being recorded, and I've been reliably informed by our son's internet history that whilst it's not uncommon for such things to be captured on tape, people are mostly paid for such displays.” John barks a laugh and Sherlock returns it with a light chuckle of his own. Hamish groans besides them, burying his face in his hands.
“I came here out of
“No b-Hamish...no biggie? You're 14! Sherlock. 14 year old son. Crime scene. No.” Hamish remembered his Dad's reddening face, and Sherlock's unwavering neutral expression. Hamish hadn't technically gone
Sarah was slight, petite, and fragile looking, but her eyes burned with a bright green ferocity of compassion that John found startling. Despite her small frame, she seemed to fill the room with something akin to angelic possession; the endless reach of her light and warmth filling every crack and crevice. John's heart warmed at the way she'd always run one small hand through Hamish's light curls in a gentle soothing motion, treating him as her own, and whispering what John assumed was a soft prayer.
"Ah”, George responded simply. He had rarely been phased by anything in the time John had known him, and apparently he wasn't going to start now. "Sherlock Holmes then...”, he continued. “What's it like living with the 'Great Detective'?"
He also shares his name with a popular soul singer from the 60s, 70s and 80s.
He was ready to shoot the nurse, who tentatively peeked around the door, down in flames. He was poised to chase her from the room with a torrent of profanities. However, he wasn't entirely sure he had it in him to be so brutal towards her. She was, after all, part of the team fighting to keep Hamish alive. And so, despite the venom towards the entire populous coursing through his veins, John kept his lips firmly and tightly sealed together. She was young, fresh-faced, her bright blue eyes only having recently finished absorbing information for exams. She was meek and polite, and John certainly didn't have the heart to use his catastrophic day as an excuse to ruin hers. She was only doing her job.
“Good.” A heavy silence descended; constricting and suffocating. It was like a dead weight pressing down on each of their chests, robbing them of oxygen and sending the sparks of stabbing pains into their hearts on each beat. Despite his best efforts to be open and frank with Sherlock now, John knew there was so much being left unsaid. There was a man before him who needed answers and guidance, he could see it in his posture, hear it in his voice. The same man who was a genius, a fantastic and remarkable man, was now like a lost child, desperately seeking something to cling to, desperately needing
John called up the stairs to his teenage son's room, not for the first time that morning, to receive the same grumbling response.

George smiled warmly at him. “Don’t fill them, no one is expecting you to. Make your own boots. That’s something the army taught me.”
birthday seemed an increasingly large blot on the horizon, a beast in his nightmares. He'd tried to bring himself to understand, but the Holmes trait of being infuriatingly difficult to decipher had been another one Hamish had inherited. Sure, John was aware of the stresses that accompanied the choices Hamish was on the verge of making, but a lot had changed. He couldn't deny it: he was getting old, and his views and comprehension of the world were out-dated, and he had already reluctantly resigned himself to the fact that there was little he could do to make these weeks easier for Hamish. Sentiment would push him away, alienate him, frustrate him further, so John simply became the
Recognising that same sequence of notes from a lazy morning which felt like a millennia ago, John allowed the warmth of the memory to display itself as a small smile on his face. As the piece came to an end, and the silence was left weighted with the dizzying nostalgia and longing, he felt the heated trail left by a single tear tumbling over his cheek. He swallowed thickly, fighting limply against the tightness in his throat.
a London Met Police database. Not exactly your run of the mill Friday afternoon.”
Reluctantly, John nodded and complied. In that moment it was like every cell of his body reawakened, returning to their begging for their basic needs. He was overwhelmed by them; his body crying out for the bare necessities. Hunger and fatigue suddenly began a ruthless onslaught, and so John returned to 221B, returned home.
But the truth of it is that I'm as knee deep in this as you two are. More innocent people are going to die.”
Mycroft pointedly ignore his comment. “I must express how
Now, at the age of 5, Hamish was able to identify the sequence of letters which formed John’s name. He’d be able to analyse the curved base which distinguished a ‘T’ from the ‘J’ of ‘John’. He recognised the sound which the circle which followed it made, and the way in which the subsequent letters completed the overall sound of his father’s name. Hamish was actively encouraged to use their names if he so wished. Sherlock didn’t like the idea of pigeon-holing him into a certain form of address. Sherlock disliked the formality and stuffiness of father, and Daddy was far too naïve sounding. Hamish often referred to Sherlock as Dad, and John as Pa, but he was increasingly using their names as his mind developed. Mycroft disapproved, of course, insisted that ‘the boy’ should be more disciplined. Sherlock took great delight in the fact that Hamish frequently called his Uncle “old grumpy guts” to his face.
Hamish's body posed a polar opposite. His face was slack, his muscles loose as his arms seemed weighted and hanging, pulling his whole form into a shrivelled kind of slump. He was looking at his feet now, silent, scuffing his foot at something on the floor. His head was hanging, his chin seemingly pulled down to rest on his chest by the gravity of his situation. He swallowed, as if trying to dispel the bitter taste of his own thoughtless and idiotic recklessness.
As he'd grown up one of his favourite experiments was
Hamish's skin was quivering under the spread of goosebumps which were making an assault up his arms and legs, but he tensed himself and slammed his foot down onto the pedal. Sweat began beading on the back of his neck, and his heart was strumming a rhythm in a tempo he'd never previously experienced as the engine splutterd into life beneath him. “I expect so”, he said under his breath through gritted teeth, before tearing away from the curb.“It's just that sort of day.”
, and whom he trusted and respected.
“I should have done something more.” His voice was just a whisper. “I'm a bloody Doctor, I should have done something! An army Doctor at that...” He began to pace, grunting in frustration and running his hands over his face once more. He shook his head, almost in disbelief. “Stupid!”, he spat, “I've treated so many bloody gunshot wounds but when it really mattered, when it really
“Composing a new piece?”, he asked lightly.
“Hamish?” John abruptly stopped walking, pulling lightly on his son's shoulder so he turned to face him. He was searching his face, hopelessly and fruitlessly trying to read him. Read something. Read
3. Chisenhale Works is a derelict factory located around 14 minutes from Bart's. It opened its doors in 1943 at the height of the Second World War and produced parts for both the Spitfire and Mosquito aircraft. It eventually closed in 1972 and has been pretty much left to gather dust since.
“Interesting choice of adjective.” Lestrade muttered.
he thought.
Mycroft retorted, his whole face and body drawn tight and throbbing with tension which John was so seldom witness to in either Holmes. John was balancing on a fine line between amusement and unease at this unusual tension in Mycroft's posture. Still, John did not delude himself into considering Mycroft's unease the result of pure and simple sentiment; Mycroft was simply uncomfortable with not being wholly in control of a situation. It threw him.
John trusted Sherlock, possibly against his better judgement sometimes, but he did. He trusted him wholly and completely from the very start, without even really considering what it meant. He never truly considered the gravity of that commitment at the beginning, because that's what trust is; a commitment of faith greater than any other.
“Hamish? When?” John's brow furrowed slightly, his eyebrows knitting together in confusion.
Why was Hamish such an enigma to him? His own
A military reunion of sorts.
friend then why don't you just do it on your own?” He's pulling a full on Sherlockian sulk and both John and Hamish throw him a look that says
"Brilliant? That he is." John smiled to himself. He chuckled lightly before adding “He's also a colossal pain in the arse.” George barked a laugh at that, shaking his head slightly whilst shooting John a quizzical look. “See those bullet holes in the wall?” John continued. George cast a glance at the smiley face which had become such a trademark part of 221B and nodded, his brow furrowing slightly in confusion. “He was
A silent understanding, pride and joy.
Hamish gave a sad smile, a smile that screamed of how underserving of that love he felt radiating from his Dad. He swallowed thickly.
“He'll be brilliant”, he stated matter-of-factly, and John had no doubt of
So when Sherlock left the flat so soon after Hamish's moody departure in a flurry of coattails, without so much as a word as to his motives, John didn't so much as look up from his paper. Because that's what trust was. That's what faith was. Only, maybe John had chosen the wrong morning to trust, the wrong morning for suspicion not to prick his placid thoughts.
Sherlock raised his gaze from the paper which he lowered slightly. “Makes perfect sense”, he commented before dropping his eyes back to the article he'd been perusing.
George smiled; a small smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. “A blessing.” He shifted his gaze to his feet. “May the embers from the open hearth warm your hands”, he began reciting softly. “May the sun's rays from the Irish sky warm your face, May the children's bright smiles warm your heart, May the everlasting love I give you warm your soul.”
“It's not the words”, George said from beside him, apparently sensing his old Captain's confusion. “It's the blessing. It's the one I used when...” he took a breath, “when we were still trying.”
John watched, frozen in his spot at the other side of the room, as one solitary tear formed in the corner of each of Sherlock's eyes. As they tumbled down his cheeks, magnifying each and every pore of that pale white skin, it twisted John's gut inside him. He'd never felt so violently and heartbreakingly ill. Paralysed by this turmoil, he observed helplessly as Sherlock took one of Hamish's hands between his own and whispered, “I'm sorry. I let you down.” Before John could register that, though the words had been whispered to Hamish, they were directed at him too, Sherlock had turned on his heel and left the room.
Sherlock made a quick sweep of the scene before him.
It was as if his son was only ashamed of his own actions,
I'm so so so SO sorry for the long hiatus. University kinda got on top of me the last few months. Unfortunately I've been stuck writing essays and reports rather than what I want to be writing...but I'm back for now! Here's a short chapter to keep you going for now.
go for pints with Lestrade on occasion but really the only thing they had in common was Sherlock. This was the first contact with someone outside of his crazy crime-solving life in such a very long time. It was honestly a relief, but John struggled to suppress the feelings of guilt for leaving Benson behind, and noticing his old comrade's slight limp and identifying his prosthetic only multiplied this guilt. Of course that was never his fault – but it was in his nature to blame himself regardless.
George nodded, his expression bright with new interest. "I can imagine. A particular favourite of mine was 'The Speckled Blonde'. Bizarre.”
“Hey.” he said, acknowledging George’s presence. His voice was croaky, and his throat was dry. George poured some water from the plastic jug at Hamish’s bedside, which Hamish accepted gratefully.
He smirked. Today just got better and better. Here was his lift, and thus his escape from the tedium of careers day and into the realm of his first triple homicide investigation.
“Elaboration would be fantastic...” John commented with a sigh.
“Well, we've already concluded that whoever left this body here was hardly a competent criminal.”
Hamish allowed himself a small smile. Mycroft may have thrown his sarcastic comments around with the intent of ruffling feathers, but Hamish couldn't help but realise just how
kind of way. In the all consuming possessive way which always rendered Captain Watson a force to be reckoned with. A passionate and driven rage: controlled fury. But now a red mist had descended and the rage was so much more. The rage was an inferno fuelled by betrayal, heartbreak and flickers of regret and even guilt. It wasn't a vengeful anger targeting an enemy, it was a whirlwind and all it was destined for was all out destruction and devastation. Benson couldn't let John inflict that kind of damage – he needed time to work through the raw anger which was coursing through him and collect himself. Which is why George was grateful when the reply from Lestrade directed them to St Bart's hospital, the change of direction extending the journey time and buying time for John's emotions to order themselves. Yet, George still opted for the longest route he could manage through London's streets without arousing suspicion. If John had recognised what his old friend was doing, he certainly didn't acknowledge it. The drive remained silent, and any conversation remained gridlocked in the jam of unwavering tension.
and when Sherlock Holmes would think he would think in a depth incomprehensible to the majority of the population. Sherlock had already accepted that he was losing everything he cared about. “You're always so certain that you're right.”
“I think he’s so proud he’d have burst if he’d not told someone.”
Sherlock was gone by the time John woke the next morning. It wasn't unusual for Sherlock to rise before him, he often did; wandering out into the flat to busy himself whilst John slept on undisturbed. It was a rhythm they'd settled into long ago, John adapting to comfortably sleep through Sherlock's early morning violin sessions.

And I lived my life by that ethos for 2 years. I abandoned everything I knew and took on the family business, retrained as a plumber. I wanted to do everything I could to be a credit to him, and I put so much pressure on myself to be his legacy.”
“How long have I been asleep?” The question was mundane and bordering on irrelevant, but John simply didn't know where else to start. He felt refreshed, but he was still tired of this, he didn't have the strength to continue an argument.
Beat.
John could feel the heat building behind his eyes, reds and oranges and flashes of white as the spark of animalistic rage swelled into a blaze of a more startling intensity. Every nerve in his body pulled tighter and tighter, screaming and wailing and begging for a release, waiting for something to sever the stretched threads and release the restrictive tension.
He was speaking out loud, obviously eager to demonstrate just how much progress he'd made.
“Look, just tell Sherlock t-”
Hamish scowled, and this only made John laugh more.
Hamish cut him off. “I didn't know, I
He'd not unleased his full fury on one Holmes brother, he certainly wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to release the thunderstorm named John Watson on the other.
Sinking down to sit on Hamish's bed, he averted his attentions back to the letter in his hand, having placed the birthday cards on the pillow. He turned the envelope over in his hand, seeking a return address on the reverse side in order to discover the letter's origin.
“What's it called?” he eventually croaked out faintly. And as Sherlock turned, his own face streaked with the evidence of the paths of tears, John hardly needed the verbal response which followed.
“Captain Watson”
Hamish had been engrossed in and surveyed his son's scruffy notes which bordered the page. "Most parents have to confiscate games consoles around exam time. I never thought I'd find myself denying you access to the bard".
cutting this bit out”, he whines.
“You know it's a man?” Benson inquired from across the desk.
The bubble shattered. John's eyes snapped up to the surgeon, who was offering his sincerest apologies, and endless promises about how they were doing everything they could. His heart had seized in his chest, his throat constricting and the thickness of the air almost suffocating. Then came the words
Hamish's uniform was crooked, unusually so. He was always immaculate, like his father. Perfectly pressed trousers and crisp shirt, navy tie done with the most even of knots, both ends matching up perfectly to the point that even the diagonal gold stripes were in line with their counterparts on the opposite end. This morning, however, his tie was at an angle. The small creases in the fabric were just as they always were, the knot still tight and even, but pulled to one side of the line of buttons on Hamish's shirt. It was obvious to Sherlock that he'd tied it as normal in the mirror before drawing it down and across. Sherlock's eyes flicked to the hem of his son's shirt: perfectly pressed, but untucked, displaying similar signs of engineered untidiness. This was a conscious effort, but why? To annoy John? Possible. More likely a signal, a discreet message to Sherlock. Of course John would be irritated at the state Hamish was in, but only Sherlock would notice those tiny details which screamed
“Morning ‘Mish”, he whispered.
family was whimpering and howling like a wounded animal, and he couldn't even hate himself for wishing their places were reversed. John choked out something close to gratitude; he wasn't sure he'd managed to formulate any coherent words but he knew that Benson would have understood regardless. This assertion was confirmed as he struggled slightly towards him, leaning heavily on his crutch, and pulled John into a hug. It was awkwardly lopsided since Benson had to keep one arm supporting himself on his crutch, but John appreciated the comfort it gave him. It was the embrace of two comrades; a silent
“Oh but we're just getting started, Hamish”, Sherlock drawls. “We have so
so often an idiot – but Hamish never treated him like he was unappreciated. Hamish had never taken him for granted, not once, and that was why Sherlock was certain that his son was already a better man that he was...
Sherlock reached the bed in three long strides and shrugged off his coat before folding it over the end of the bed. He sat at John's feet on the far end of the bed, his body turned slightly towards him. “I'm still angry. I'm still upset. And I will be for some time. There is no quick fix for this, Sherlock. But Hamish needs us, and needs us
“Nice of you to join the party”, Hamish remarks dryly.
Sherlock gave an irritated tut before meandering swiftly through the huddle of forensics personnel and sinking to his haunches beside the body which was face down in the foliage. Hamish followed at a slightly slower pace, with Lestrade in tow, documenting the surroundings. They were beneath a redundant railway bridge in the darker corners of Camden town. The undergrowth had been left to spread and multiply like bacteria on the once intricate Victorian stonework. Those old cobbles had probably seen their fair share of criminal activity over the years; drug deals taking place in the darkened shelter, out of view. Hamish wondered if this was the first body to grace its twisted and tangled undergrowth. His evaluative gaze followed the trail of flattened weeds leading to the unfortunate victim. The body had clearly been dragged, a lone assailant then?
It was undeniable just how much John had allowed this man to embed himself into his conscious, his subconscious and even his heart. He'd trusted him indefinitely from day one. Day one being the day he'd shot and killed a man in Sherlock's name without missing a beat.
He felt idiotic, because
John could hardly feel his legs beneath him as he laboured up the stairs to the flat. He'd stooped slightly to sweep up the pile of post that had gathered just inside the door, and he didn't even bother to straighten fully before continuing up the stairs and pushing through the door of 221B. He shucked off his coat and threw it over the sofa before casting a tired but evaluative gaze across the flat. Nothing had moved, everything in the flat was just as he and Benson had left it several hours previous – right down to the mug which had been left on the floor by the vacated armchair.
Then, that was the effect war had on a person.
“Go on then, smart arse...” he rejoined light-heartedly “...do enlighten me.”
“There are probably a few things you should know about Hamish though...”
he thought to himself.
wasn't enough, and John just needed
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were the most iconic pairing to have ever walked the streets of London. The crimes they’d solved together and the lives they’d touched were beyond counting. Something swelled in his heart whenever he thought of everything they had achieved together, the men he had the privilege of calling his parents, his role models, his mentors, his heroes. That something was always tinged with something, a sharp, bitter edge on a warm comforting glow. Hamish could place it now; sadness. How could he ever amount to anything close to that? His parents weren’t just his heroes, they were London’s, nee
Was that what he was? He supposed it fit. Two halves of the same person: the ability to switch between the two like the flipping of a coin – heads to tails. An
John smacked one hand against Sherlock's shoulder suddenly, and let out a noise somewhere between a cry and a growl. He pushed back, twisting violently from Sherlock's arms and raising his hands to grip forcefully at his hair. He turned his back and moved to the other side of the room at a speed which seemed to illustrate that he was being physically repelled from Sherlock. Sherlock could hear his deep and heavy breaths intermingled with almost silent wails of despair.
“Callously murdered, not by our prime suspect; Mrs Turner's Cat, but by Mrs Turner herself!”, John adds in a scandalous tone that Mrs Hudson would be proud of.
Then.
birthday...
“The News.” Sherlock responded without missing a beat. It would do no good to contest John on this matter – Hamish had to go to school today – John was always extraordinary stubborn concerning their son's attendance. It was frightfully boring of him, and most inconvenient, especially on those days when Hamish's presence on a case would prove valuable.
“So you're saying these are...” Benson began.
And for the first time in his life, Hamish Oliver Watson-Holmes did not question the answer, because he knew it was true.
This chapter was going to be longer, but I didn't want to keep you (or my nagging friend who hates me for the heartbreak I've put her through with this fic) waiting, so I decided to divide it into two. It was in two parts anyway so the second will come in a day or two.
“4 hours or so. You were asleep when I came in. I didn't want to wake you. You needed to rest.”
he urged.
was okay. He wondered if Sherlock ever worried over the state of John's heart and mind after an argument in the way that John worried about him.
John couldn't help but feel strangely at ease with the scene before him. Sherlock, their son, and his old army friend all working feverishly at a lead to try and identify their killer...or should that be victim. Hamish was watching, slightly awestruck, over George's shoulder as he frantically typed away on Hamish's laptop. Hamish had used DRAGNET to identify a 5 mile radius of the probable location of the man they were looking for, much to Sherlock's disgust. He'd declared geographical profiling a 'primitive waste of time'. And now, Private George Benson was 'forcibly accessing' Scotland Yard's missing persons database in search of someone living in that area who'd gone missing just prior to the first murder, who was a potential candidate for the unfortunate forced killer.
“Ah, so's you know your insignia, do ya'?” An impressed and knowing smile crossed the stranger's face.
Not until the next morning, when it was so gingerly pierced by the soft sound of a raspy voice from the bed beside them. “Dad?”
an invitation to start...” he falters. “...
It was friendship and warm familiarity. It was the kind of embrace that could only be shared by two men who would fight and die together: it was the relief that the worst was over, but an unspoken
John's gaze softened a fraction, something more complex than hurt sewn within those irises. Hamish tried in vain to place it;
"Dad, get off" he mumbled, pulling away with an over dramatic pout.
Sherlock believed his face betrayed not a morsel of his heart. Sherlock believed he didn't even possess a heart. John knew better. Whether John was adept at deciphering the detective, or whether Sherlock simply unknowingly let his façade slip – his mask crumble – when he was alone with the army Doctor, John was unsure. What he was sure of, was the conclusion he'd drawn from those striking blue irises.
