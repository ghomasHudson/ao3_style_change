“Piss off,” John grins, eyes shifting away from Sherlock’s, and immediately gets up to take Rose’s trunk. He stretches up to toss it on the luggage rack above their heads, his tee shirt riding up to reveal a sliver of toned stomach, pale skin above the waist of his jeans. He flops back in his seat, his short muscular legs stretched out in front of him, ankles crossed.
Sherlock returns quickly, a steaming cup of extremely black coffee in one hand, and a fresh pint for John in the other. He slides in beside John instead of across from him. Their elbows bump as Sherlock stirs in sugar, and John allows one hand to fall casually onto Sherlock’s knee under the table. Sherlock’s pleased little smile, the slight reddening of the tips of his ears, infuses John’s whole body with a quiet kind of joy. He keeps surprising himself, his capacity for happiness growing exponentially the longer he’s home, the longer he’s with Sherlock.
There was a moment of hesitation where Owen was obviously reconsidering letting John go on his own. Then he slammed the door and the cab pulled away from the kerb. John tucked his knees closer to his chest and squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself not to throw up until he was home. Despite a pang of guilt about coming home in this state, he couldn’t wait to see Sherlock, curl up against his chest and go to sleep. He smiled even through his nausea and pressed his knuckles into his eyes. Sherlock was all he usually needed to feel better, anyway.
As he crosses Euston Road, he sees familiar faces amongst the hoards of Muggles. He hoists his bag higher on his shoulder and starts ticking off a mental checklist of every fellow Hogwarts student he sees heading towards King’s Cross to catch the train. There's Violet Brompton, Ravenclaw prefect, probably future Minister of Magic, and absolute fuckwit. And Steven Moorgate, Gryffindor, terrible at Potions but nearly took top of the year in Transfiguration last year, which infuriated Sherlock to no end. He's still glaring at Moorgate when he catches the familiar form of James Moriarty, sixth year Slytherin and
Something giddy has burst open in John’s chest as he salutes Greg and hops out of the train car, dragging Sherlock out behind him. He feels sixteen, immortal and omnipotent.
Sherlock clawed at John's bare back, digging his nails in until John arched and tensed under him. John's thumb worked a maddeningly slow circle at the leaking head of Sherlock's cock as he pumped him gently and went on licking and sucking at his nipples until they were stiff and swollen, wet with John's saliva, standing out gorgeously against Sherlock's pale skin. John kissed up his throat and put his mouth against the hinge of his jaw.
“It’s okay, John, it’s fine,” Sherlock threaded the fingers that had been on John’s neck up through his hair, and cradled his head against his chest. “I can’t either...I’m so…”
“Ever the scientist.” John finally pushes up and searches Sherlock’s face. His eyes have lost the stormy darkness of before; now a gentle cornflower blue, red-rimmed.
“Uh huh,” John lisped out, one endorphin slackened arm flopping heavily over Sherlock’s shoulders. With his other hand, he fumbled at the flap of Sherlock's pyjama bottoms.
“Found a compartment yet?” Rose calls over her shoulder, lugging her heavy black trunk up into the train.
He was absolutely beautiful, and my heart ached at the sight of him. I wanted nothing more than to fall to my knees and lay my head against his stomach, to feel the rise and fall of his breath against my cheek. I lowered myself gently to the carpet.
They settle slowly, breathing hard against each other. Sherlock swivels, mouths at the edge of John’s orbital bone, and John squeezes him crushingly tight. They don’t bother cleaning up. Showers and laundry can be done in the morning. Sherlock eventually turns so they’re facing each other and sighs sleepily into John’s mouth. John pulls the blankets over them and flips on his back, pulls Sherlock to rest securely against his chest.
“Sorry, no further, not right now. You can wait over there in those chairs.” A finger, pointing past his nose. Everything’s all broken up, bits of people, chunks of building. He’s lost inside his mind, everything’s so jumbled. He needs John to sort it out. Needs John to put him right.
John looks up at him with that intense gaze that always makes Sherlock’s stomach flip over. He clears his throat, pauses, and then sets the oil lamp carefully on a nearby table and sits down next to Sherlock on the sofa. It isn’t right to keep calling this a sofa, really, is it, Sherlock thinks frantically. It’s a settee. It’s not a sofa at all, not
He wondered how Sherlock’s blood looked when it dried. Whether it was thick and sticky like a toffee pudding or whether it was powdery, blowing away in the wind, spreading Sherlock’s DNA all over Smithfield. There was a stain there, still. He made himself walk past it at least once a week. Once, at night, when there’d been no one to report a strange man lingering in the street, he’d actually laid down beside it. Laid his cheek against the edge, the pavement digging into his bad shoulder, and imagined he could smell Sherlock there. Thought about darting his tongue out to touch it, to taste what was left of Sherlock in the world.
The first brush is soft, lips tentative, shy. John curls his knuckles along Sherlock's jaw, his head already light. He's kissing Sherlock.
"Oh. I'll just..." John makes to get up, go in their bedroom so Sherlock can sleep in the sofa. He aches, thinking of sleeping alone tonight, of Sherlock sleeping alone. Both of them insomniacs, tending towards behaviours like sleep walking and thrashing nightmares, they need each other to sleep. The bed will be terribly empty without their entangled limbs, Sherlock's sweaty cheek pressed against John's neck, his hands tucked warm under John's tee shirt as John's thigh slots between his legs. Sherlock always runs so hot, sweaty when he sleeps, damp tendrils stuck to his forehead when he wakes up. The bed will be so cold without him in it.
John is not a soft man. He’s spent his entire life being hardened by his experiences, and his emotional walls are high and fortified. He doesn’t gentle easily, isn’t given to grand displays of affection or sentimentality. Sherlock’s always been able to chip away at those walls in a way no one else ever has, though, and now he’s crumbled them entirely. He feels exposed and raw in all the right ways, as though his heart is beating outside of his body, there for Sherlock to take and hold and make a mess of.
The girl at the till is pretty, freckles across an elfin nose, long brown hair gathered in a messy bun, huge blue eyes ringed with mascaraed lashes. She grins at John, allows their fingers to touch as she hands him his change. He nods briefly and looks away.
"No one has ever...I'm not, Sherlock. Not at all. I'm short and plain and average. No one has ever said..." John can't even look at him.
John smiles and dusts his floury hands in the sink. Those blue eyes - those one of a kind blue silver eyes, shot through with black streaks and flecked with grey and just
His forefinger was soon joined by another, which finger I couldn’t tell. It was all just pure sensation, as he worked me open gently, and then not so gently. The entire lower half of my body was throbbing, my thighs burning with the effort of staying upright. John thrust his fingers into me deeply, rubbing over the spot that made me positively
obvious when he said hi to you last night and your face turned nineteen shades of red and you couldn’t talk.” Mike turns a bit red himself, and grins up at Sherlock. “You should come watch him play. He’s
“Hey.” John murmurs, crossing the darkened kitchen to tuck his arms around Sherlock’s waist. “You okay?”
the pub, though. Maybe not even near us at this point. We’re allowed to be on our own because the danger isn’t pressing."
him. He doesn’t even care anymore if this is only a hallucination, he wants this. He wants this every night,
Always so careful with me. Taking it slow because you didn’t want to alarm me, because that’s your nature, to protect me. It’s just who you are.
, but he doesn’t. Instead he rolls his hips again, watching wonderingly as John’s mouth drops open, the bright flush of arousal spreading up his stubbly throat.
John wriggles back and mumbles something incoherent, his head growing heavier against the swell of Sherlock’s bicep. Shushing him quiet, John’s hair tickling the end of his nose, Sherlock reaches down and pulls the bee quilt up over them both. He rubs a hand slow up and down John’s flank and watches the afternoon shadows dancing across the wallpaper.
Sherlock stares at him. Strong, brave John. John who saved him from a rapist, who wasn’t afraid of Jim, who is sitting there unabashedly watching Sherlock about to shoot heroin into his arm. John, who never flinches. John who shared his sandwich, his money, who laughs crinkley eyed and wondrous. Who could ever want to hurt John?
“They’re in the kitchen. You took them off when you were making coffee.” Sherlock says casually, affection plucking at the edges of every word. He looks up at John over the ridge of his laptop screen and puffs at the pipe between his teeth - an ivory encrusted relic he’d discovered in a dusty shop in Notting Hill a few weekends ago. It’s nothing but overwrought Victorian filigree and someone else’s tooth marks on the stem, and John finds it loathsome. Sherlock adores it. “Actually, fetch me a fresh cup while you’re in there.”
John laughed, eyes twinkling, and he rubbed at the beginnings of scruff on his jaw. "Maybe I'll grow it back for you while we're up here."
John’s back is warm and sticky and comforting and it takes enormous willpower to make himself pull out and roll to the side. John shifts sideways, folds his arms under his head and blinks lazily at Sherlock, his neck and face still crimson, his eyes the colour of bluebells, soft and sleepy.
“How long have I -” John’s question is cut off by a yawn. He stretches his arms over his head and throws a leg over Sherlock’s hip. Comfortable. Familiar.
This is their best chance at getting rid of Jim, the only way to catch him out. “John, please. It’s a good plan. It’s solid. Jim loves to be right, he gets off on it. He’ll never even stop to
A familiar voice sounds behind them, and they break apart as though there’s been an explosion. John stumbles over a rock jutting out of the ground, and Sherlock grabs at his shirt to keep him from falling, which knocks him off balance, and they both end up sprawled across wet sandy earth, limbs tangled, looking up into the curious face of Professor Neville Longbottom.
John. John is the opposite. John makes Sherlock remember who he used to be, remember that there is good in him. John makes him feel strong and sure, makes him believe the world isn't as grim as it can sometimes seem. John believes in Sherlock, believes he's something special. Even if Sherlock can't quite believe that about himself yet. John will believe enough for the both of them, for now.
John squeezes his keys in his fist, hard, and then throws them on the coffee table with as much force as he wants to hurl at Sherlock. The sound of it startles them both. They crash into the surface, skid across the length and drop into the floor. The teeth leave dents in the wood. "Why are you doing this? What the fuck, Sherlock? What the fuck is wrong with you? All I've ever tried to do is make you happy, goddammit."
"Mmmmm. Small? Hmm. That's definitely not the impression you gave me this morning..." John lifts his head and smirks crookedly, winks.
John knows he’s won. “Sherlock. You don’t want to upset the patient. What if my blood pressure spikes and I pass out? You’d have only yourself to blame.”
John breathes hard through his nose, his lips a tight line. His distress is coiling down into a cold ball of steel grey fury - the kind that Sherlock saw him unleash on the paedo at the park. Undoubtedly the kind of controlled rage that kept him sane in a home with two abusive alcoholic parents. He breathes deep, soothing himself. Sherlock can actually
But rarely is it measured, paced, their want for each other so long submerged that it’s usually hungry and rough and fast, Sherlock’s legs wrapped impossibly tight around John’s back, John’s teeth leaving purple marks all over Sherlock’s chest and shoulders as their desperate, frenetic cries mingle together and they’re left scratched and bruised, panting exhaustedly into each other’s mouths as John thinks
Sherlock rolled, his arms drifting above his head, knees falling open. John’s hand stroked up the inside of his thigh, and barely over his flushed cock, laying straining against his belly. Just the heat from John’s hand made him tremble anew, and he curled his fingers around the headboard, moaning and arching his hips entreatingly. John fell over him, breath hot and fast in Sherlock’s ear, beard rubbing shiveringly along his neck.
"Alright. So. Honey bees are actually a very small fraction of the world's bee population. Most bees are not honey producing, but honey producing bees pollinate over 80% of the world's crops. They're desperately important to food production, and they're dying off at an alarming rate. Beekeeping and managing the population is still done on mostly a small scale, remarkably unchanged from the birth of beekeeping almost 16,000 years ago..."
“What do you do, John? I mean, other than that.” He inclines his head back at the bar as they emerge into the frigid night. John shivers under his arm.
"Listen, John. I always want you by my side when I'm working. I missed your input and just your presence this week. Just having you nearby helps me to think better. You know that. But we can't
John arcs an eyebrow, grins, takes a sip of his coffee. He's the only person sitting at the small scrubby tables outside Speedy's. It's cold, no one wants to take their coffee outside. Sherlock still hasn't seen him.
“Yeah. Had a real bad infection. I’m alright now. Anyways. I did what you said.” Weasel was practically vibrating with excitement.
He slipped into the booth beside the blonde guy, because he needed to have the barrier of the table between himself and the contact whose name he still didn’t know.
When Sherlock returns, clean and dressed and cried out, John’s awake, sitting on the edge of the bed.
John strokes his hair, murmuring gentle, soothing words against his ear. The aftershocks are strong and numerous, and John holds him through them, legs still locked tight around Sherlock’s waist. Finally, he stops shaking enough to pull out, leaning all his weight hard against the wall, and feeling as if he could slide right down it. John drops his feet to the floor and puts his hand on Sherlock’s stomach, smiles up at him. He catches his bottom lip in his teeth again, like he had earlier in the evening, and Sherlock is completely at his mercy. John could get him to do absolutely anything with that coquettish little lip bite.
. He’s flirting. It’s been so long, so long since anyone’s been playful with Sherlock like this, he didn’t even comprehend. Jim was the last one, but his teasing always had an element of cruelty woven into the joke. John's good natured, as different from Jim as it's possible to be.
John's pleased grin gets quickly covered with Sherlock's mouth. They fall back sideways across the bed, John crawling up Sherlock's body with one knee bent beside Sherlock's hip and the other between his thighs, adjusting his shorter torso and aligning it against Sherlock's longer one so they can keep kissing. It feels both brand new and familiar, the solidity of Sherlock's body under him, the smell of him. This is what they should have always - always - been doing. John's throat aches again. He licks into Sherlock's mouth instead of crying, and runs his thumb down the side of Sherlock's neck, slow. Sherlock shivers, stretches his neck against John's fingers.
“Yes, of course,” John lies easily. “Just come to raid the fridge. Any of those apple pasties from yesterday left?
After he's soothed Sherlock's angry skin, he sits Sherlock - still endorphin drenched and sleepy - on the chair in their bedroom while he strips the bed and puts on fresh sheets. Then he helps Sherlock into one of his own soft, well worn Army tee shirts and a pair of grey sweatpants and bundles him into the newly made bed.
“Thank you. I suspect it probably tastes better to you than it normally would, in the aftermath of that horrendous hospital food, but -”
"Shhhh. I know. I don't mind. Truly. You still smell better than that first day we met." John rubs a slow circle on his skin, and chuckles sleepily.
“I’m sorry I didn’t say something before, I just - “ Sherlock’s stammering, talking too quickly, as he does on the rare occasions his emotions get ahead of his brain. He reaches beseechingly toward John.
“I thought you said it was probably an overwrought tourist.” Sherlock jogged ahead of John, able to make out the lights of at least three police cars winding up the long drive to the manor house as they ascended the swell of the stream bank.
in front of that same cute boy who’s rendered Sherlock entirely incapable of doing either. Though no one has ever made him feel this kind of nearly painful desire. The thought of being rejected by this perfect being, of not having him, makes Sherlock's stomach hurt. He
“Want to.” It was a simplistic solution to whatever was happening between them, and Sherlock knew it, but he didn't have the words to talk about it. He didn't
"You two gonna get out or just sit there staring at the place?" The cabbie heaves his bulk around in the seat to glare at them.
Sherlock shakes his head, his features lit by the faintly bluish glow of the Kindle he has propped against a pillow. "Listen to you. You're like a bear sometimes, John, I swear. A small, grouchy, grizzly bear."
“Christ, I like it when you get bossy.” Then end of John’s sentence faded into a gruff sigh as he handed Sherlock a pillow and tilted his hips up, his legs falling open into Sherlock’s touch.
“Twelve,” Sherlock affirmed. He slipped his hand over the curve of John’s hip, taking his time with every movement, wanting to draw this out. He kissed at John’s bollocks and cupped them in his hand. John arched up with a quick little pant, his bare feet pushing at the sheets. Sherlock pushed his lips harder against the pliable skin, John’s pubic hair tickling his nose. “I miss you.”
Sherlock's eyes went bright, and he looked away, blinking. "Good. I like being right. So, you'll be sleeping -- "
Sherlock scrambles across the floor, his trainers slipping in blood, throws the milk crate and rips the belt from under the blanket, crawls frantically back to John.
"Nope. Nothing. We'll find her. You're clean now. You can think again. We have a home to come back to. We'll find her, and we'll bring her here, with us." John smiles reassuringly, eyes twinkling. "She can have that second bedroom we'll never use."
Sherlock blinks, long black lashes snarling together. His eyes are bright translucent green in the fluorescent light, shards of sea glass. “I remember every single thing you’ve ever said.”
John’s eyes widened in mock surprise as he dropped his jeans with a thump and pushed his pants off. “Sherlock Holmes. Language.”
John presses a tender kiss there before kneeling up and reaching over Sherlock’s belly into the bedside drawer. Sherlock sucks in a long shuddering breath and trails his fingertips up and down the outside of John’s thigh almost absentmindedly. He looks destroyed, the hair framing his face soaked with sweat, the dark flush of arousal mottling his pale skin, his eyes unfocused, mouth lax, lips puffy. The expression of rapt adoration on his face as he watches John fumbling like an idiot in the drawer for the lube is heartbreaking.
John's eyes are closed when he feels the weight of Sherlock settling beside him, the sofa dipping down. Sherlock sits there for at least five minutes before he moves a muscle. When he does, it's to lay a warm palm against the small of John's back. The touch is unexpected, and intimate, overwhelming in it's comfort. It's a touch unlike any they've shared before. It means something different, it's a line crossed. John breathes out staggeringly hard.
They lock eyes and giggle softly, suddenly aware they’re in a very crowded coffee shop in the middle of the day.
“Alrighty then. Be right back with those.” She gave John a big grin, fluttered her lashes a few times and sashayed away.
"Our foyer, too!" He called after her as she twittered down the steps, leaving a swath of gardenia perfume in her wake.
When they’re cleaned up, Sherlock pulls John’s tube of lip gloss from his jeans pocket, not even remembering how it got there, and John tilts his face up. Sherlock takes the hint, and carefully smoothes it shiny over his still puffy lips. John pouts his mouth, eyes locked on Sherlock’s, resting his hands on Sherlock’s waist. The smell of candy floss is going to remind him of sex for the rest of his life.
The tight coil of tension in Sherlock’s stomach starts to unwind slowly. He realises he’s been clenching his teeth - they ache. He smiles back. “Yes. Is that okay?”
“Alright?” John scraped his teeth along the swell of my arse, flicking his tongue against my overheated skin. His finger within me stilled.
John slowly turned his head, taking in his neighbor. Younger than John, but flabby, pinkish and pale, with a receding hairline and soft hands. He was staring at John expectantly. John felt his upper lip curl in a snarl.
and it's all he can do not to bury his face in the curve of Sherlock's neck and hitch his legs around his waist and just pour every ounce of emotion out of his own body into Sherlock's as fast and as hard as possible. Strip them both raw. He breathes through his nose and thinks
“Christ, you’re inside me…that’s gorgeous.” John moves his hand from Sherlock’s head to his hip, digs his fingers in. “I’ve got you.”
“Not always. Not last night.” John pulls his face back enough to look into Sherlock’s eyes and thumbs at his mouth. “You’re still - a bit -
"Yeah." John couldn't take his eyes away from Sherlock unbuttoning his wet shirt. His hair was in half dried tendrils, fluffy and soft. His wet trousers clung to every curve of muscle and hollow of bone. Sherlock's body was different. Stronger. He hadn't seen Sherlock undressed since their reunion. As Sherlock slipped his tee shirt over his head, revealing a taut hardened belly and thick biceps, John realised he was licking his lips.
- after far too many nights of wanting and not having, after all those mornings of laughter over the breakfast table, John winking at him as he got his coffee and a brush of bare feet under the table that neither of them were brave enough to acknowledge, after countless too long stares and bitten lips and John’s hand resting against the side of his thigh in the back of a cab - to just
“John, I’m so sorry.” Sherlock whispered, hushed and hoarse, his voice breaking on the the single syllable of John’s name.
Sherlock taps the side of John’s mug and stands up. “Well, I could use a warm-up. I’m freezing. Going to get a coffee - you want another latte?”
The first few days of term pass in a blur, as they usually do. Determining the best routes to get to classes on time, and readjusting to the daily load of homework after a long summer without it, is dizzyingly exhausting. The first Friday of term, Sherlock finds himself half dozing by the fire in the Hufflepuff common room, the rosy light of sunset filtering down through the freshly cleaned round windows. He stretches his bare feet out on the warm wooden floorboards and rolls up the parchment he’d been working on for Potions. It can wait, not due for a week, anyway. The fire crackles and spits, flickering hypnotically against the copper coloured brick of the hearth.
Of course he doesn't say it. He's never said it. Except when it was safe, bound by the confines of friendship, in the context of John and Mary as a couple. When it was guaranteed not to lead anywhere that was uncharted. Christ, but he can be a coward.
“Oh, yes, yes,” I begged, unabashed in my need for him, but yet still unable to speak the words he wanted to hear.
God, that case. Baskerville. It had really messed with both their minds, but strangely brought them closer together than they'd ever been. It was the first time John hadn't argued when everyone assumed they were together. It was the first time they'd slept in the same room. John had laid there for hours, watching the rhythmic rise and fall of Sherlock's chest, every instinct in his body urging him to lay down next to that warm body, wrap his arms around him, breathe in the scent of his hair. Keep him safe.
Here, in this suspended moment, it's silence. They’re in their tomb. He's going to die. Sherlock's going to die. Together. At least they’ll have that.
John stroked him rhythmic and slow, every sweep of his fingertips sending spirals of pleasure singing down Sherlock’s nerves, stoking the fire deep in his belly. The sweet shivery beginnings of orgasm flooded through his body like a narcotic, making his limbs weak and shaky. “John. I want you, god, I want you,
“Mmmm, no. S’good.” And it was, it was more than good. Every part of me was aching and trembling and sweating and overheated, and I had never felt more wonderful in my life. My muscles were tight around John’s hard length inside me, and I clenched them intentionally as he moved. “I want you to come inside me.”
"God you're beautiful like this. I didn't get to watch you, the other night. Didn't get to see you come." Sherlock whispers, insinuating his fingers into the tightness of John's jeans and stroking over his bollocks. John whimpers and whines, leaves little perfectly rectangular teeth marks in his bottom lip.
"I have. But not for a very long time." Sherlock's hand tangles up with John's hand, and Sherlock's fingers are against his own mouth, which is something John can't look at without a resounding shiver racing through his nerve endings, so he looks at the wall behind Sherlock's ear and breathes.
Sherlock gives his head a few more scrubs and then prods at his shoulders and murmurs, “Time to rinse it out.”
John’s right hand on his back, rubbing a slow circle. John’s left hand on his knee, warm and heavy. John’s lips soft against his cheek. Oh. Kissing - John is
“I know, baby,” John drops his voice down an octave, indulgent and placating. “You’ve just - never made lasagna before.”
John didn't respond. Instead he felt along the wall for the light switch, and not finding one, stepped into the living room and fumbled at the lamp silhouetted against the paneled door. The light came on abruptly, bathing the rooms in a soft yellow glow.
"Gimme a drag." John sidles up beside him, tight to his body, legs touching. Sherlock's arm drapes immediately around his shoulders. The cigarette is right in front of his mouth, held loose between two long tanned fingers. Tanned. So incongruous with everything John has ever known about Sherlock. They really have a lot to talk about. Not now. He wraps his lips around the filter and pulls, Sherlock's eyes on him.
Jim curses but doesn't loosen his grip at all. Instead, his fingers tighten, digging into Sherlock's windpipe. "You always were, and you always will be. You need me. How long have you been clean? A day? Johnny boy's never gonna stay with you, pet. He's going to go find some pretty girl and have babies and you'll be a funny story he tells to his pub mates on the weekends. And you. You'll be crawling back here to me,
“Well, let’s dirty it up, then,” Sherlock giggles back, his head muzzy with a strange kind of giddiness at actually having gotten this beautiful creature alone with him.
, John thinks, his hands wandering down to caress Sherlock's bent knees, which are leaning against John's hips. He licks his dry lips, transfixed by the slide of Sherlock's fingers in and out of his body.
The dom in him is telling him to get Sherlock under control, not permit this kind of disobedience. The husband in him is seething with guilt, agreeing with Sherlock that he shouldn’t have made him leave. The best friend in him is telling him Sherlock just needs to get it out of his system and then he’ll be reasonable.
“Shall we tell Mrs Hudson to send us our belongings and let out 221b?” Sherlock arched an eyebrow, not entirely sure he was joking.
He lays back beside Sherlock, who rolls instinctively toward him. He tilts his face up and their lips meet in a long lazy drag, a deep slide of lips and tongue, exploring each other’s mouths without urgency. John curls his knuckles against the side of Sherlock’s face, tucks a sweaty curl behind his ear.
The air in the room was thicker. Something had irrevocably shifted between them, and they both knew it. It was barely ten minutes since Sherlock had walked into the room, and two miserable long years since they’d seen each other. It was moving too fast. They weren’t giving each other space to understand, they didn’t seem able. Every buried feeling they’d ever had, all the whispered words they’d never said, they were all right here, laid bare in both their eyes. John realised now that Sherlock felt just the same as he always had.
me?” John was having a terribly difficult time imagining Lester carrying a heavy shopping bag, let alone John. Solid, muscled John, who had always been much heavier than he looked. Especially when he was unconscious dead weight.
“Snuggle?” John’s face breaks into a crooked grin, and looks somewhat like himself again, even though his eyes are still heavy with sadness.
John opens his mouth to retort, to say he isn’t ashamed, to say he’s proud of who they are and how far they’ve come and of the life they’ve made together. He opens his mouth to say that, and realises Sherlock is right. He’s been in denial about his own part in this ever since it began. He thought it would be a fun bedroom game, something to spice up the sex, and instead it turned into their lives. It turned into who they are, and it changed their relationship. It changed John. Self-reflection has never been his strong point, but this. He's made everything about Sherlock, when of course that's idiotic. It seems so obvious now, how impossible it is to behave as though a relationship is all about one person. Two people chose this, two people need this, two people live this everyday.
“You had Mycroft fish my gun out of a skip?” The thought fills him with so much delight he can barely suppress laughter.
John closes his eyes before he looks up, giving himself the time to allow this to wash over him, whatever is about to happen. Breathe in, breathe out. He can feel the saliva drying on his lips.
me, but as far as I’ve understood relationships, which admittedly isn’t much, I’ve been given to understand that loving and being
"Yes, I'm aware you've been labouring under the illusion that I'm a virgin for nearly the entire time we've known each other. Mycroft is not always a wholly accurate source of information about me, you realise?"
Sherlock’s never touched any cock except his own. His inexperience doesn’t matter at all as he gets his hand around John’s, satiny hard and wet -
John sighed. God, he was being maudlin. Here he was in a raucous pub in South Bank with his rugby team after their first win, crying into his lager and missing his boyfriend. Pathetic, really, for a forty year old man.
“I won’t argue with that.” Sherlock grabs John’s wrist and puts his lips against his pulse, licks a thin stripe up into the middle of his palm. John giggles, and the sound is so goddamned enticing, Sherlock can’t stop himself from sweeping John into his chest and capturing his mouth in a fierce kiss. John hums approvingly and throws his arms around Sherlock’s neck. They stand there on the sidewalk, entwined and kissing, the wind swirling icily around them, until a catcall from across the street interrupts them.
“Yeah, I fucking know. That’s why I’m asking for gauze.” John still had the assignment in the package he’d picked up in Fargo. He had to get this weasel done with, and fast. The truth was, he didn’t really have any idea how to be a criminal. Beating the fuck out of people and being angry wasn’t enough. He was used to working with cops, not against them. Used to looking for evidence, not destroying it.
, until I could not hold back my pleasure any longer and came silently, hips lifting off the wooden bench, shuddering and biting into my wrist to keep myself quiet.
She’d cried and said she’d never rent the flat to anyone else. “You’ll always have a home to come back to, John Watson.”
When he wakes, Alchemy is gone again and the room is silent. Peeking out of the slit in his curtains, Sherlock sees three empty beds and, through the window at the end of the room, a sapphire blue sky.
." It feels like something out of a film, or a television show meant for Americans. It feels too clean, too perfect. Sherlock thinks of the soot on the doorknob of 221b, the dirt streaked windows, the chipping paint. He wants to go home.
John presses his knuckles against the throbbing pulse point between Sherlock’s legs, and any worries about doing it wrong dissolve into the liquid heat spreading through his entire body. His back arches, legs squeezing together, and John pulls him close. Whispers little
“Yes. We’re done here.” Sherlock turns to see John watching him with an expression both furious and tender, those amazing eyes filled with softness, but his jaw muscles clenched and jumping with anger. It hurts. It’s a punch to the gut, seeing someone look at him again like they care. How has this happened in just a few hours?
“Lester. You have to tell me absolutely everything about this tall English man you saw, including where the fuck did he go?” John huffed out his nose, his head throbbing. His mouth tasted of tobacco and vomit, and he felt disgusting. “But first, go get me a Coke, and something to eat, and do it fast. There’s money in my jeans.”
. Just Greg is fine.” Lestrade laughs and shakes John’s hand. “But do listen to me, alright. If Moriarty is half as dangerous as Sherlock says he is - “
“So, we’re moving forward?” Sherlock finds his voice, hoarse and ragged, his head still spinning with the reality of Molly being here.
"I'm going to go clean up those dishes -" Sherlock's cut short as John's arm tightens around him and yanks him back down.
Sherlock’s fingers stretch up to stroke down the rough surface of John’s cheeks, his shimmering moonlit eyes filling with both heat and no small amount of awe. John’s head turns just enough to catch the tips of Sherlock’s index and middle fingers between his lips. The sharp inhalation beneath him makes his eyes flutter shut in the satisfaction of knowing that after all these years, he can still make Sherlock’s breath catch with just the infinitesimal flicker of his tongue.
John smacks Sherlock’s arm and sticks his tongue out. “Oh, a thumping good endorsement, that! Thanks a
“I know, sweetheart, I know. Me too.” John smoothes his hand over Sherlock’s quivering back, settling him. It’s natural for him to take the lead between them in everything but The Work, and it seems sex is going to be no different. “Come on.”
"It's overwhelming, I know. Feels like it could all slip away so easily." John rubs his nose back and forth against Sherlock's shoulder, traces his fingers over the rise of Sherlock's hipbone. John's touch is already so familiar, so natural. He couldn't bear to ever live without it again.
John just stares at him. Sherlock stares back, unsure of what’s about to happen. Time feels suspended.
John puts his hand over Sherlock’s mouth. “Don’t even say it. Look. We’ll sort this out, okay. One day at a time. But if we’re going to get jobs or anything, we need to be clean, right? I mean, that’s like pretty much the first thing anyone looks at. We have to be clean and in nice clothes, yeah? This place is only £15 a day, Sherlock, and we can shower, we can wash our clothes. There's free food, a way to make sure we eat every day. It’s a waystation, right? A place to sort our shit out.”
“Race you!” John repeated, tossing Sherlock a mischievous grin as he broke into a loose run, his small frame bounding deftly over top of the underbrush.
“Oh, that’s shameful, truly. How dare you not bake fresh bread, you lazy sod?” John teases, finally feeling their normal ease with each other returning.
Sherlock used to tease him about it. Nothing unkind, just needled him for being able to carry a gun, perform surgery on a broken heart valve, and not know the gas pedal from the brake. Sherlock didn’t drive much himself, but he did it well, just like everything. “John it’s easy. It’s just mechanics. You’re a doctor, for god’s sake. If you can maneuver the mechanics of the human body, a car would be nothing to you.”
“I’m sure you’ll want John all to yourself. But listen.” She reaches into her bag, pulls out a pen and a receipt and jots something down on the back, takes Sherlock’s hand and tucks the paper inside. “You boys call me if you need anything, alright? Don’t hesitate, dear. I mean that.”
." John pushes up on straightened arms and looks down into Sherlock's face. "So we'll just take it slow, yeah?"
"Same, no harm meant. Just a joke." Owen smiled apologetically. "Like we always do. We all take the piss out of each other. Just laughs, John. You take the piss out of me the same way. I’m sorry if we offended you. It was a shit thing to say."
He closed his eyes. They were gritty and painful, and he was exhausted. Everything hurt. His body, his mind, his heart. Everything.
“I know.” Sherlock smoothes the blankets down and pulls a chair up to the side of the bed. “I know.”
Sherlock grabs at him as he goes to stand up, and he plants a firm kiss on Sherlock's mouth. "Baby, I'm not going anywhere. Just right in the loo, right next door. I will be right back. Two minutes."
, and he mustn't ever allow himself to forget that. He kisses the smooth pale skin so gently, breathes against Sherlock's back, rubs his nose up into his hair. "You're amazing," he whispers.
“We’ve still got hours until supper. It’s raining, and cosy, and we’ve no where to go. Come to bed with me.”
"Yes, John, come now. Oh god, please, you're so --" Sherlock wrapped his legs tight around John's hips, enraptured by the changing expressions on John's face as he got closer. He crossed his ankles against the small of John's back and rolled to meet John's rhythm. He was still half hard, John so perfectly full and thick inside him, hitting his prostate with every thrust. Electricity swarmed over him, his entire body alight and fizzing with arousal.  "You're so beautiful -- oh, John, there, yes, there, oh god..."
Sherlock obeys immediately, laying down in the center of the bed spread eagle, his cock laying hot and gorgeous against his heaving belly. His eyes fall shut again.
“I don’t even know who Kevin is.” Sherlock closes the space between them, arching up over the bar and putting his lips against his ear, “It was the boots. Mostly.”
“That’s it. There we go. Just shhh. I’m alright.” John slips an arm around Sherlock’s waist and pulls him in, leans back until they’re both laying against the back of the sofa. “Want me to play with your hair?”
He hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. She smokes elegantly, like Audrey Hepburn, her hands long and graceful, blowing the smoke out above her head, chin tilted up. Guilt tramples through him.
John runs his hand down the toned curves and angles of Sherlock’s back, over the lushness of that absolutely wickedly perfect arse, and places a soft kiss between Sherlock’s shoulder blades. Sherlock shivers and presses his hips back, mouths at the hard curve of John’s bicep where it’s laying under his head.
"Like this," John breathes out, kisses across Sherlock's collarbone, and brushes his fingertip feather light against tight furled skin. Sherlock groans low and rumbling and pushes down hard enough that the very tip of John's finger goes in, just that much, a centimeter, and John has to stop himself from burying his whole finger in that tight heat. He's shaking, rubbing his hips in circles against Sherlock's upper thigh, "We would have - if I'd come home - we would have.
Sherlock lurches off of him, and John bends down to pull his pants and jeans up, a creeping sense of humiliation spreading through him. Sherlock glances at him out of the side of his eye as he’s buckling his belt. “You okay?”
“What? What did I say to do?” John swallowed, closed his eyes. It was too much effort to keep them open. A vision swam in back of his eyelids, a half remembered voice.
“Goodnight, Molly.” Sherlock opens the door to the boys’ dormitory hallway, a warm barrel-ceilinged space hung with dozens of copper lamps that cast an orange glow over every surface.
It’s a cool, damp night. The summer is beginning to give over to autumn in the way that it does in the green places of the world, leaving in its wake the smell of wet earth and fallen leaves. The sky glitters with stars - Sherlock forgets how much he misses them when he’s in London, and he looks up with a sigh.
“Yeah, of course I am.” John squares his shoulders, sucks his tongue between his teeth. His mouth never stops moving. It’s distracting.
“What do I look like, John?” Sherlock lowers his lashes, sucks his bottom lip between his teeth, knowing precisely what he looks like.
Sherlock sucked harder, his own cock leaking inside his pyjamas, precome soaking the cotton as he rutted himself against the mattress. John's cock thickened, and Sherlock swirled his tongue in a long languorous upstroke and then pulled off, licking him from root to tip. He lowered his mouth to John’s bollocks and dragged his tingling lips over them, kissed at his thighs. “John, get the lube.”
I gripped the back of the chair, bracing myself as John rubbed his nose up and down my spine. His hands were everywhere - tracing the edges of my shoulder blades, fingertips bumping over my ribs, squeezing my arse - as he worked over my back with both teeth and tongue until I was shaking. His nipping kisses ended with a gentle press of lips to the back of my left thigh as he reached to retrieve the tin of petroleum jelly.
“Shit, yes, let’s - “ Sherlock pulls at John’s bottom lip like he can’t bear to stop kissing long enough to climb the stairs, and then rocks his forehead against John’s like they had in the train car. “I want you so badly. I can’t think.”
, and somehow understood Sherlock couldn't bear to be touched too much. He slept feverishly, reveling in the comfort of John next to him, thankful for the icy cold air conditioning on a body simultaneously speeding out of control and trying to shut itself down.
“Thanks for the smoke.” He seemed to sense John was on the verge of something dangerous, and darted quickly out the door like a mouse, curls bobbing.
A dark pleasure throbs hot in his belly, making his painfully hard cock twitch inside his jeans. John slips his hand from Sherlock’s face and insinuates it between them, caressing Sherlock, rubbing his palm flat over his cock and between his thighs, never breaking eye contact.
John swipes his tongue up the breadth of Sherlock’s pectoral, nips his collarbone. He lays himself tight against Sherlock’s side, kisses his neck. He twists, stretching so he can reach into the bedside table, and sets an icy cold tin of petroleum on Sherlock’s chest.
that. I’ve never in my life had anyone I could just be with. Just be silent with. Just be in the same room with, and say nothing, and still be together. Those things make me feel - safe. And I never did, before you.” Sherlock stops talking, and John can see him trying to sift through his thoughts, pluck the granules of exactly what he wants to say and leave the rest behind.
Taking a steadying breath, Sherlock emerges from the shadows and lopes across the desolate lot, his long legs carrying him quickly to the foot of the enclosed stairwell that leads up to Jim's flat. With a few skipped steps, he's in front of the door. Through the small rectangle of reinforced glass that serves as a scrubby window, there's the blue glow of a telly. Jim hates sleeping with the telly on, needs complete silence. He's awake.
"Well, you always did disappoint me, if you want to know the truth. Never living up to the potential of that massive brain of yours. Content to be my little fucktoy and stick mummy's money right into your arm. A waste, really."
Sherlock sucks in a hard deep breath, filling his lungs, and holds it for a second. Lets it out in a slow exhale. “Okay, so I’m a genius, yeah. Like smartest person in a room, always. Except for my brother. My parents always pushed me, gently, but pushing. Cause they knew I could take it. Wanted me to be top of everything, top marks, top in violin. I knew it was out of love, concern, but I always kind of -- hated it. I wanted to do things my way, always my way. So, I had Jim, first, like that was enough, to have the chavvy boy on the side, you know, my parents had no idea, and it was fun and felt dangerous. And then, that wasn’t enough. I needed something...
. He feels like he’s had one too many at the pub, his head swimming, the rest of him pleasantly warm and slow. All at once, the phrase drunk in love makes complete sense. He’s never felt that before, this dulling of all his senses just because of the proximity of his object of affection, by their breath in his hair, the weight of their body resting against his. He’s had flashes of it with Sherlock before, but they’ve never had this - permission - and it’s exhilarating.
, she must have heard them, but she's happy and they're happy, so they can't feel too embarrassed. John types up the case while Sherlock fiddles with some experiment and then they catch each other's eyes, and drift into Sherlock's bedroom, kissing slow and deep and long, and when they're breathing hard afterwards, Sherlock curls his body around John's and strokes his hair as they fall asleep, and somehow seven years doesn't seem so very long after all.
need it, that they couldn't do anything without it. The only reason he agreed to leave John at the hospital with Harry.
During term, they hadn’t talked about much except chemistry, really, though John looked forward to their study sessions much more than was probably normal. Sherlock gave John a confidence in himself that he’d never had, simply by his presence alone.
“Good. Great. Just, get out. I have shit to do.” He waited until the door was shut, and he went and locked it. It wouldn’t do to have some dumb fuck hooker stealing his shit, possibly fucking up this whole enterprise.
. And alive, and you needed me. I was unbelievably grateful just to be with you and to have you not hate me, truthfully."
"I'm -- I want to be. I want it to be good. For you." Fingers in John's hair, slow circles on his scalp. Sherlock pushes up, just a little, with his hips, into John's belly. He shivers, pulling on John's hair. "Oh."
“I trust you, too.” Sherlock unlocks the box and swings the lid open, ready to stuff the wad of cash in as quickly as possible.
Sherlock can't help but laugh at that, as John giggles against his chest and slots their knees together. John takes Sherlock's laughter as permission, and drags his hand up and then down, beginning to stroke Sherlock with a gentle rhythm.
“Sorry I’m late. I know you’ve been waiting forever.” He pulls his hat off and ruffles his fingers through his hair. He grins and pauses, catching his bottom lip in his teeth, cocking an eyebrow at John. “Worth the wait?”
"Oh, love." John's head fell back as he hitched up into Sherlock's hand. The blushing pink and white mottle of arousal had spread all over John's chest and stomach, his neck bright, his cheeks flushed. He swallowed, carded his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, though his eyes were fixed on Sherlock’s mouth. “You don’t have to.”
“Oh, I think I have - some idea. I want you to finger me until I’m absolutely wailing for you touch me and then don’t, leave me there begging for it until I’m crying. I want you to fuck my mouth until I’m choking on it, until I can barely breathe, until my throat goes hoarse. I want you to hurt me until I’m begging you to stop, and then I want you to keep going. I want so much, John. And now that you’re not afraid, not afraid of yourself, of who you are, I know you want it too. I know you can give me those things. Oh god.” Sherlock’s breathy words dissolve into a high pitched whine as John bites into his shoulder and squeezes his cock at the same time.
“Oh, I am.” John’s hand slid around to Sherlock’s jaw and tugged. “Get up here, gorgeous, and I’ll show you how very serious I am.”
“I just wanted you to hear you. Hear you forgive me, and I thought - if you thought - just for long enough - “ Sherlock drops his eyes to the floor, abashed in the face of John’s fury.
John immediately allowed his charming face to take over, all sweet smile and sparkling baby blues. It was shocking, how easily people were taken in by a pretty face. Rationalisation was easier when people were generally so bloody stupid.
"Very, very much." Sherlock scratched his nails lightly over John's neck and collarbone, pulling the neck of his tee shirt away. He pressed his mouth against that perfect hollow of bone and pulled at the soft skin there with his teeth. John whined softly and twined his fingers up into the back of Sherlock's hair. "For me, John? Please?"
Flirting and sex and crime scenes and murder were so intertwined for them both. They’d fallen in love wearing forensic coveralls and nitrile gloves, bent over bloody corpses. Their first kiss was up against a soot covered brick wall whilst on a stakeout.
John slaps him across the bum, laughing, and Sherlock calls him a prat and pins his hands above his head, so John flips Sherlock flat on his back, both of them giggling uncontrollably, and neither one of them is sure when the play fighting and wrestling turns back into kissing, but soon they're both very distracted from the idea of showering and eating and Sherlock wraps his hand around them both and squeezes and pulls and John sucks another bruise out on Sherlock's neck right before they both come all over Sherlock's fist and collapse panting next to each other.
“Yeah, me too.” They swing onto Lambeth Road and the crowd changes suddenly, no more mothers with buggies and prams, no more families out too late. Here it’s swarms of club kids, neon shirts and leather jeans, platform boots and glowing necklaces. Sherlock smells weed in the air, there’s a queue outside Fire, wrapping round the side of the building, everyone already dancing, snogging, drinking. A writhing mass of people. The energy in the air is crackling.
“Have you ever lost someone important to you? Someone you never expected to lose? Someone that made your life mean something, made all this stupid shit worth suffering through, just so you could see their face at the end of the day? Someone that just reading the paper with them or having a cup of coffee with them...made the pain go away for a while?”
“Yes, I’m alright.” Sherlock nuzzles into John’s lap, his nose brushing the inside of John’s thigh, and that spark of arousal flares brighter.
“Masturbate?’ John grins and tips Sherlock’s head up. “No need to be embarrassed about it. I’m not.”
Her shoes squeak on the linoleum floor, pants swishing as she walks. It’s extremely quiet except for the beep of monitors, the click of fingers on keyboards. No voices. No tellys turned too loud. No hum of traffic. There’s a hush that gives the entire place a dreamlike quality. They reach a closed wood door with a huge brushed metal handle.
The last time he'd eaten so well was the Christmas before he'd left home. His mother's homemade bread warm on the cutting board, a huge rack of lamb glistening with fat, his father telling stories about work and Mycroft rolling his eyes. Don't remember it, Sherlock. Don't think about it.
, this is so hard. I love you so goddamned much, Sherlock.” He says fiercely, and folds Sherlock in his arms, pressing their bodies flush from shoulders to ankles. The words he’s been wanting to say to Sherlock for five years are an avalanche rumbling through him, deafening and unstoppable. Another hard kiss ends in a mumbled chorus of, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
“Shhh, alright, alright. I won’t argue the point. You tell me what year it is, love. You tell me.” John’s fingers come up where his hair meets his collar, sweeping gently back and forth. Soothing. Calming.
He’s going to cry. He can feel it, the lump forming in his throat. He scrambles off the bed and yanks a towel off the shelf, opens the door quietly so as not to wake John and flees down the hall to the loo where he can cry alone, muffled by the sounds of running water and other people talking and brushing their teeth.
Sherlock whimpers a little, his cock thickens, the slippery precome under John's thumb increasing. John slows more, loosens his grip, just slides two fingers up the side, as Sherlock finds his voice. "I wanted you to - kiss me - "
“Aye, we were, my bonny boy,” John slipped back into that Scottish brogue that had absolutely no right to be as sexy as it was. He grinned again and bit his lip, then said teasingly in his normal accent, “But that’s at least six kilometres from here. I honestly don’t know if you can make it.”
Sherlock doesn’t speak when they get home. He takes the steps up to the flat two at a time while John carefully bolts the front door behind them. Mrs Hudson is home, he can see her outline moving behind the etched glass window. Something in him needs to check on her, make sure she’s safe.
John’s shoulders shook with laughter, “I am not taking this to a dry cleaner. Jesus fucking Christ. I would be mortified. It’s absolutely covered in come and lube.”
John. Unchanged. The same inquisitive blue eyes, outlined with long honey-coloured lashes. The same furrow of concern on his forehead, the same gruff worry in his lovely voice. Comforting and familiar and still able to make Sherlock’s skin shiver all over with just a look. Sherlock would know John anywhere, in any time, in any universe. It
I grinned around him, unable to hide my satisfaction at his response, and counted his heartbeats as they thudded heavily on the inside of my bottom lip. I hummed and John quaked above me, emitting a long low groan, and I realised that in my eagerness I had been licking rather hard at the sensitive underside of his cock, bringing him much closer to his crisis than I had intended to.
Sherlock nods, stiffly at first, and then John brushes a thumb over his eyebrow and kisses the end of his nose and Sherlock exhales and goes loose underneath him, and repeats, "Slow."
Sherlock tilted his chin, brushed those beautiful plump lips against John’s. John could feel his eyelashes fluttering against Sherlock’s cheekbone as their heads moved sideways so they could kiss more deeply. Sherlock’s tongue flicked lightly against the seam of John’s lips, and he parted them, meeting Sherlock’s tongue with his own. His scalp tingled as their mouths moved against each other, shivering at Sherlock's fingers roaming up his spine, gathering him close. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled himself up on his toes, their height difference even more pronounced with John in bare feet and Sherlock still in his shoes. John nosed along Sherlock’s jaw and buried his face in his neck. Sherlock hummed a contentedly, and John squeezed him even more tightly.
was that all about?” John breathes, watching James saunter down the hill. He shifts his gaze to Sherlock as his fingers uncurl from his wand.
John laughed hoarsely. He shook his head, and looked up at Sherlock with red-rimmed eyes. “You always make me laugh. Even when everything is utter shit.”
You have no idea.” John runs his hand all over Sherlock’s chest, the taste of his come still strong in his mouth. John’s so hard he thinks it might actually kill him if he doesn’t come soon, but he doesn’t want to rush Sherlock, who seems to be essentially unconscious. He takes off Sherlock’s pants and trousers, which had still been rucked around his calves, and drops them to the floor, then kisses Sherlock’s belly - sweaty, delicious - and up over his chest, until he closes his lips over Sherlock’s thumping heartbeat in his neck and begins to suck.
When John woke, Sherlock wasn't in bed. The surge of anxiety that swept through him was cut short by hearing the quiet hum of Sherlock's voice in the sitting room. He breathed evenly through his mouth and flopped back on his back, stretching stiff calves and an achy back.
,” John pants against the hollow of Sherlock’s throat, moustache scratching deliciously rough on delicate skin. He tucks his arms under Sherlock’s armpits and cradles the back of his head in both hands, pressing their bodies flush together from hips to shoulders. His lips sweep back and forth over Sherlock’s collarbone, up the side of his neck, somehow both gentle and fierce simultaneously.
They’d covered most of west London on foot, John restless after their meeting at the Diogenes, unable to go back to Baker Street and just
, how'd they'd felt all along. The food comes and they eat quietly, sip their coffee and stroke each other's fingers.
“John.” Sherlock tips forward until their foreheads are touching, and extracts his hand from their tangle of fingers, cups John’s jaw instead. “I love you, too.”
Sherlock disentangled himself from John and fetched the wheelchair from the corner of the room. “You up for a little sightseeing to the canteen?”
John tries to smile back, tugs Sherlock’s head down to put their mouths together. Sherlock hums warm into his mouth, kisses John deep and unhurriedly, spinning them so John’s spine is pressed against the doorway. They kiss like they’ve no where else to be, like they could stay here forever, in the silence of this purple twilight, the very last of the daylight ribboning under the front curtains and across the faded carpeting.
, jerks once, twice, goes still and stiff, lets out a soft sob, and then there’s a sticky hand gripping Sherlock’s hip.
“No, love.” The endearment slips out without him even realising he’s said it. “We never really, ah, got round to a redo. I’ve been a bit preoccupied since. Mostly with you.”
“We’ll see, Watson. I wouldn’t count on it.” Rose goes back to petting the now sleeping rat in her lap, winking at Sherlock.
"Sherlock...oh god." John's hands on his hips, fingers digging into bone, and it's still not hard enough. Sherlock needs him at a molecular level. He wants them fused, one person.
. I want to." John breathes, his voice shaking. His face is laid open, so bare with love and pure desire.
Sherlock doesn't know what to say to that, because John's  bursts of affectionate compliments still flummox him, so he just hums in agreement and lets John nip at his neck and his ears and rub his face in his hair. It isn't really arousing as much as it is deeply satisfying - John heavy on his back, pressing him into the mattress, the sound of John's breath against his ear. Just John. Pleasantly grumbly and warm and comforting.
John appeared in the kitchen doorway with a steaming mug of coffee in his hand, hair still slightly damp from the shower. "What, to Scotland?"
"You like your present, pet?" John strokes him lazily, not trying to bring him off, just enjoying the slide of Sherlock's velvety foreskin in his grasp.
John cards his fingers through Sherlock's hair, rubs down the nape of his neck, circles a thumb over the base of his skull. "Just checking."
Tonight, as Sherlock sterilised his arms with alcohol pads, John lazily pulled on his foreskin, rolled it between his fingers. Leaned over and kissed him, nosed into soft brown curls. Sherlock had squirmed, dropped a cold alcohol swab on John’s shoulder and made him jump.
“This is a really nice place, though. I think you both deserve a nice place.” She smiles at Sherlock, warm and sympathetic, and it occurs to him suddenly that John’s told her all about him. That night in hospital, the two of them sharing guarded whispers that Sherlock couldn’t decipher. She knows about the drugs, the homelessness, maybe even the prostitution, though perhaps John wouldn’t have divulged that bit. No, he wouldn’t have. But she’s not stupid, she would know what street kids with addictions do to get money.
“No. I’m not asking. I’m telling. He’s going home. He needs to rest. I’ll text you tomorrow. But I’m serious, Greg. If I get one text tonight, just one - we won’t be in tomorrow. I understand people’s lives are at stake, and I’m not at all unconcerned about that fact.” John squeezes Sherlock’s fingers tightly. “But
“Is that him?” More twangy unpleasant syllables. Everyone sounded ugly and hard here. No soft London vowels, all the words rounded and lyrical. God, he’d even give anything to hear an East End drawl.
“Oooh, hi, Alchemy,” Rose coos at him, holding her hand out across the space between the benches. “I was wondering where you were hiding him, Sherlock.”
He swings his head back to look at John, who’s watching him with undisguised affection, his hands folded above his head. Sherlock swoops down and kisses his belly, John sighs, lets one hand drop to the top of Sherlock’s head. Darts his tongue out to lap at the soft skin over his ribs, and John rolls beneath him, fingers tightening in Sherlock’s hair. Closes his mouth around one perfect nipple and sucks, the skin rising into his mouth, responding to his touch. He flicks the very tip of his tongue across the little nub, and John arches into his lips, but remembers not to be too loud, muffles his cry with the back of his other hand.
Sherlock shifts and sinks into John, hums contentedly. John’s eyes finally feel heavy. Just as he’s drifting off, Sherlock’s full lips sweep gently and purposefully across his jaw.
- dresser, the dusty floorboards creaking familiarly under his feet, the cool weight of the Sig resting against his spine.
“Please. Please may I see your face? I missed it so, and you were asleep before. I just want to...see you looking at me.” Sherlock’s voice was barely audible. John allowed him to pull one hand away from his face, and then the other. “Hey, blue eyes. Won't you look at me? Please."
“Mmm, a bit. Actually, what I’d really love is a shower. Haven’t had a proper one in days. Or a bath, god, that would be glorious.”
, has to watch as John tugs him apart the edges, turns him inside out. He lifts his head. The dip and swell of John’s back as he moves, sweat slipping in rivulets along his flanks, arse tightening as he rocks, and his right arm, pushing
“She’s got it in for me, Mr Watson.” Lester shook his head, as if he just couldn’t believe it. Lester shook his head like that all the time, as if he could somehow dispel everything that was happening, that had happened, with a shake of his head.
Sherlock retrieves his cigarettes from the sitting room, throws open the window to the fire escape and leans against the sash, turning the pack over between his fingers. John’s just putting the coffee on when there’s a knock at the flat door. They both jump. Sherlock’s stomach is immediately in knots.
John considers for just a moment, then gives Sherlock a heartfelt grin. "You're bloody brilliant, you know that?"
“Yeah, Sherlock?” John can’t stop threading his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, trailing over his ears, touching every part of bare skin he can reach.
A cold hard stone dropped into Sherlock’s stomach. He hadn’t known that. Mycroft’s intelligence was good, but not good enough to see into people’s intentions, to see their hearts laid bare. Here was John’s heart, his misery and his anguish, laid in Sherlock’s hands to care for, and he didn’t know how.
touched him like this before, no man, no woman, only Sherlock. It feels like worship, the way Sherlock’s eyes are so wide open, watching him, cataloguing every twitch of pleasure in his face.
“John, I’m Molly. Greg told me about you.” Molly holds out her hand and John shakes it, with that firm, sturdy way he has about everything.
John ends up not sleeping. He just stares into the fire until it dies, until his eyes are heavy and stinging, until his arse is numb and his leg aches, and stares at the cinders as they burn away to ash.
The next nip is more a bite, John’s teeth tugging at the sensitive skin on the inside of Sherlock’s thigh hard enough that Sherlock yelps in pain. His eyes fly open. John grins wolfishly - his eyes dark and predatory. He licks over the red rectangular indentations, brushes his mouth against them in almost a kiss. Then he does it again. Sherlock’s leg curls up against the pain and he can’t stop himself from pushing at John’s head. John looks up, his eyes wide and black, his mouth rubbed pink.
. He allows himself a laugh, and shrugs. “Why? What’re you doing? You sound as though you’ve got a plan.”
John starts laughing, which quickly turns to coughing. He winces, pants out a harsh breath and presses his hand to his side. The fit passes, and he picks up a styrofoam cup from the tray beside the bed, tosses some ice chips into his mouth and chews, watching Sherlock.
does that hurt. His skull feels full of sharp edges and explosions. His ears ring and ring and ring as he settles back against the pillow and tries not to be sick.
in Sherlock’s voice, and he walks his long fingers across the table, stopping just before they make contact with John’s skin. His knee presses against John’s thigh. “I’ve got all night. If we want it.”
John. It seems to be the only word left in his head. He likes the shape of it, how it tastes when his mouth forms the sounds.
Sherlock hasn't done this voluntarily in over a year. It's been all blocking it out, trying not to remember, feeling guilty and disgusting if he was turned on by it, as if his body was betraying him. The last time was three nights ago, and now he thinks maybe that really was the very last time. That the only person who'll ever have him this way again is laying underneath him right now. That he'll get clean, go home, have a life. All because of John. John's given him so much, without asking a thing in return.
“Finally. I thought we were never going to get moving,” mutters Albus, pressing his long nose against the window and waving, presumably at his parents, as they rumble slowly forward.
"Oh fucking hell," John says, his heart thumping so fast it almost hurts, and digs his toes into the bedsheets, his fingers into the soft skin at Sherlock's groin, and grinds his hips
His heart was suddenly pounding with anxiety. He wasn't this person anymore. He just wasn't. He no longer belonged here. His throat clogged with emotion, acidic and burning.
Heedless of the crowd parting around them, John draws the pad of his thumb gently over Sherlock’s mouth and then stretches up on his toes to press a hard kiss there.
It’s windy out, leaves swirling. It’s stopped raining, but the sky is burnished a flat matte grey and the air is damp, the chill reaching right into his bone marrow. Sherlock shivers in his tee shirt and thin jeans, wraps his arms around himself, trying to keep himself from breaking into pieces.
“Keep going -” John husks out, rubbing himself against Sherlock’s hip and mouthing at his collarbone, “You have no fucking idea what this is doing to me.”
Sherlock pressed his tongue into the vein, swept the tip in circles around the head, pumping his hand along the saliva soaked length of John's prick. He took him deep as John's fingers tightened against his scalp, working the tip of his cock with his throat, and John immediately pulled at his hair. Sherlock swallowed around John's cock, slid his hand down to cradle his bollocks, and John positively keened.
Sherlock lifted his head, his own eyes red rimmed and achingly sad. John choked out another sob, his mouth trembling so hard he didn’t think he could even speak. He was looking at Sherlock. Sherlock’s eyes, his ridiculous cheekbones, his caterpillarish eyebrows. He was thinner, his skin was rougher; he looked like he’d been outside a lot, and his laugh lines were deepened, the furrow in his brow more pronounced.
John insinuates a hand in between their pressed together bellies and tilts up on his other arm. As his fingers close around Sherlock’s cock, the liquid heat in his veins begins to coalesce into something much more immediate. John smiles crookedly at him, those startlingly blue eyes sex-drugged and unfocused.
She takes the hint and doesn't try for more conversation. Sherlock lets his eyes close, the rumble of the engine vibrating through his skull.
“That you were an exemplary soldier. A good doctor. All the things people expect to be when they’re children who don’t yet understand the darkness of the world. So what was it, Doctor?” The man’s lips split in a wide smile that didn’t reach the rest of his face.
Sherlock turns with another apology on his lips, but John’s smiling mischieviously. One eyebrow crooked up, biting his lower lip. He’s so pale, those red lips barely pink, every freckle on his nose standing out dark brown against his grey white skin.
But who else would know that? The texter was saying things to him that only he and Sherlock could have known about. John knew Mycroft had bugged their flat, but he had no reason to play with John like this. John suspected he wouldn’t be able to recall details of their private conversations from three years ago, anyway. Moriarty could have, had he been listening in on Mycroft’s recordings, which was entirely possible...but he was dead, too.
, he would mutter, eyes half closed as he stumble stepped into the hallway. Sherlock would sit as rigid as a wooden plank, pretending his heart wasn’t pounding at the sight of John’s coral coloured nipples against his pale chest, his muscular thighs, the tease of a hipbone above the waistband of his underwear.
"Oh, quite right, quite right. You do remember the oddest little details, don't you, Sherlock?" He clicks the telly off and tosses the remote onto the sofa. It bounces off and hits the floor. He shrugs and leaves it there.
.” He mutters, sullenly picking at his fingernails and uncharacteristically sounding very much like the eighteen year old he is.
There was an open door at the end of the table, and some of the guys were out on the sidewalk smoking, huddled round the doorway. The cold night air wafted over the table, mingling with the smell of cigarette smoke. The smell reminded John viscerally of Sherlock, wrapped in his dressing gown, one thin pale arm holding his cigarette out of the cracked open sash of one of the sitting room windows.
John sets the tray on the bed and carefully sits crosslegged next to Sherlock. He strokes his face for a moment, and Sherlock snuffles and turns his mouth toward John's hand, but doesn't open his eyes.
Their new arrangement works shockingly well. John's always been a man of rules and regs. He craves order and definition. Knowing his place on cases, having his role so clearly defined, is comforting. Grounding. The first time he dares to challenge Sherlock at work is a few weeks in. John offers a different interpretation of evidence, and Sherlock entertains him for a while, becoming increasingly terse as John continues to argue his point. Eventually Sherlock turns his back and begins to walk away, a clear dismissal. John grabs at his sleeve to make him listen, and Sherlock rounds on him with fire in his eyes, his voice dead calm, "Shall I send you home, then?"
“Okay, okay, sweetheart. Let’s - I would really like a shower.” John pulls back, laughing, and begins climbing backwards off the bed.
Finally Sherlock collapses back down on the bed, panting and whimpering, breathing out hard through his nose in short little bursts. His hands come off the headboard and curl around the back of John's neck.
“Yes, fine. We’ve been hiking all morning, I think I have a bit of a chill.” Sherlock rubbed his arms as though he was warming himself and tried not to smile when he saw John’s mouth tick up amusedly.
John’s breath catches in his throat at the callback to their first night together, which even at the time felt life changing. It was one of those rare moments John could point to in his life where he
Sherlock swallows, his jaw caught in John’s strong hand, his wedding band hard and cool against Sherlock’s skin. He knows better than to argue, even as every cell in his body is telling him to stay here, don’t leave this room until he solves it, push himself until he can’t think about anything but this, and that's when the revelation will come, that's when he'll solve it -- he opens his mouth to say all that, but the only thing that comes out is, “Yes, John.”
John threw his head back and laughed heartily. "More like your pale urban Londoner who can't go an afternoon without wifi and takeaway coffees. And there's not much heather in Dumbarton, Sherlock. Though we could take a trip to Cairndow, too. I could show you the cottage if it's still there." John leaned in with sleepy eyes and a gentle smile, trailing a finger slowly down the side of Sherlock's neck. "We'll talk about it tomorrow when I'm not pissed, how about that? Come to bed."
a calendar on the wall, pinned in the space between the windows, above a paper cluttered roll-top writing desk.
John shook his head, feeling unaccountably lonely. He'd texted Sherlock after the match, just to let him know they'd won and to see if he was needed for the case. Sherlock hadn't texted him back. He'd had a few moments of concern, but likely Sherlock was just in his mind palace turning over evidence and didn't hear his phone. John could envision him, skinny bare feet curled over the edge of his chair, hands templed in front of his mouth with his fingertips slowly stroking the bottom of his nose, his eyes dark and fathomless and he stared into his own brilliant mind.
Sherlock looked up, at the dark outline of John against the weakening firelight, the tilt of his head that meant he was watching Sherlock’s face. Sherlock exhaled hard, and closed his eyes. John pressed the pad of his thumb into the frenulum and moved his hips, his bollocks hot against Sherlock, his cock nudging against his prostate. “Oh John. Please,
is everything important and good and right, and there is nothing here to be embarrassed about. He trails his finger along the elastic of Sherlock's pants, raises his eyebrows. Sherlock lets out a long shuddering breath and nods, eyes shifting down to watch, watch as John dips just his index and middle finger under the waistband, smoothes his hand flat over Sherlock's hipbone and feels the beginnings of sparse wiry hairs against the heel of his hand. Sherlock shifts his hips, still watching, as John kisses down his belly and runs his hand down the inside of Sherlock's trembling thigh.
He bends his leg, pushes against the mattress, turns toward John and wraps both arms around him, realising as he does that he hasn’t touched John at all. John’s been lavishing attention on him,
it. It's going to bring up all the things he's avoiding thinking about - everything that happened in Bemidji, and what brought him to that. What came before. Moriarty. The fall. What Sherlock did. What Sherlock failed to do.
, Watson often admonished me when I was in a mood such as this one, the insult usually followed by a bruisingly hard kiss meant to redirect my energies into more enjoyable pastimes.
if it happened that way again. His arms pinned behind him, Sherlock whispering rough commands in his ear. His cock stirs just at the memory of last night, and he quickly finishes washing and wraps a towel around himself. Having a wank about it would just make everything even more muddled.
"I want you." John husks out, heat crawling up his neck slow and sweet. He's not felt this since before, this languorous kind of arousal that's all slow kisses and laughing under the covers. It makes his thighs hot.
There always seemed to be a way to find one. One that looked enough like him that John could forget, for a little while, that this had never happened between him and the real Sherlock.
John's voice comes out in a harsh whisper, his face burning. He can't believe the things he's saying, the things he's thinking. He's thought them before, if he's honest, but in startling unwelcome bursts. Always pushed them shamefacedly away, feeling there was something wrong with him. Now he realises, as Sherlock grinds back, moaning and dripping precome all over the sheets, that there is absolutely nothing wrong with either of them. They both love this, want it, and it's nothing they would ever do with anyone else. This is just for them, another expression of the bond that neither of them has the words to describe. Far from having to be ashamed of it, it's something precious and beautiful. Sacred.
"I think slow might actually kill me, John." Sherlock's hands are running into John's hair and down the back of his neck, hard and uncoordinated. "I've thought about this so many times, and how it would feel, and it's - the reality of it is quite different."
Sherlock watched John as he disappeared into the hallway, his shoulders tight. This holiday was going to be emotional for John. Sherlock would have to tread lightly, or John would close up like an oyster being prodded with a stick.
Sherlock kisses at John's wrist, "Criminals tend to get angry when you infiltrate their networks and shut down their financial contacts. Body counts start rising and people get frustrated... I had a few mishaps along the way. Purely physical. It's fine. They'll get better. In time."
"How is Mike?" Sherlock unwound himself and crossed the sitting room to sit next to John, tucking his face in John's chilly neck. He smelled like beer and cigarettes and that faint exhaust smell that lingered in tube stops. "Here. Give me your boots."
“Ah, you’re just out of shape. You’ve always been a lazy thing.” John clapped him soundly on the back, but allowed his fingers to linger fondly, tracing a slow line up between Sherlock’s shoulder blades. Then he flopped back against the grass and folded his arms behind him, looking up into the wide white sky. “When you’ve recovered, we’ll cross over that little stream there and walk to the house. I’d love to get a look at the place after all these years.”
me, sweetheart." Jim smoothly picks the remote back up and the telly comes to life, music blaring into the silent room. "I'm not interested in your ill conceived plotting and your lovelorn begging. I'll be watching. You can be certain of that. When you're ready to play with Daddy, I'll know."
When John starts to shake, his mouth going slack against the fresh bruise on Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock holds him close and whispers
. I needed, I don't know, a thrill, you know? Something really dangerous. And Jim, he, gave me some -- stuff -- one night. I was really stressed out about uni, I had just started and it was hard, you know, actually hard. I didn’t have all the answers already. I’d always had all the answers, John. It was frightening to have to study, have to work. I know that’s so shitty and ridiculous of me, but it’s true, and then Jim said this would help, that it would calm me down, let me relax. And it did. And I couldn’t -- I wanted to be calm, I needed to stop -- thinking all the time. And I failed. I failed for the first time in my life. I failed my whole term. And I just walked away.”
“I can’t -- stop for just a second. I can’t make the key fit when you’re doing that.” His voice breathy and strained, his head light from alcohol, from John’s heat against him.
John’s fingertips tracing the edges of Sherlock’s eyelashes, their bodies curled together under worn blankets.
John looks wary. Heat rises in his cheeks. Perfect cheeks. Just hollow enough, round on the bone, handsome. He’s handsome. His eyelashes flutter as he looks down, upper row catching on the lower as his eyes shut. “I don’t have to. Can I just...finish my sandwich?”
Stumblingly, mumbling apologies at his roommates, Sherlock crawls out of bed and slaps his alarm off, then drags himself to the common room. He’s shivering from head to toe. Luckily someone’s left a throw over the back of one of the chairs around the hearth, and Sherlock grabs it and wraps it tightly around his shoulders. He curls up in the chair, knees to his chest, and waits for Mycroft.
Sherlock wants to watch him sleep all morning, but his own body feels sticky and grimy, his eyelids gritty.
"John." John's name, always so laden with meaning, with what they were and are to each other, was the only endearment Sherlock ever used. John called Sherlock
John may or may not pass out, he's not sure, but he's suddenly vaguely aware of his stomach growling and a dull headache which means he needs more caffeine. Sherlock is definitely asleep, graceful even with his mouth hanging open and come dried sticky all over his stomach, so he leaves him there and pads downstairs for a shower.
“Picked Sherlock’s pocket while you two were sleeping, wrote down the addy. I wanted to give you the chance to call me yourself, but when neither of you did…” She trails off and shrugs. “I decided I wasn’t going to wait for you to disappear again. Mrs Hudson let me in downstairs - she’s absolutely lovely by the way. I didn’t know which flat it was.”
“Same.” Sherlock tucks his arm through Rose’s, and smiles down at her in some sort of apology for not being able to share this with her. He hopes she understands.
When they emerge onto the street, John doesn’t hesitate as he spins Sherlock into his arms and kisses him in the wavering golden light of a streetlamp.
, underneath which is a picture of two smiling witches with three small children who keep trying to run out of the frame as their parents patiently haul them back.
John was falling apart. Sherlock hardly recognised him, the thinness of his frame, the hard set to his jaw. He was doing things Sherlock never imagined John would be capable of. Hurting people, hurting himself. Sherlock rarely second guessed himself, but now...Now he was certain he’d caused this, by not telling John what was about to happen. By leaving him to be sucked in by the quicksand of grief.
When term had ended, John had a sort of vague fear that they wouldn’t have anything to talk about anymore. Or even worse, that Sherlock would stop texting, stop replying, just disappear completely from John’s life. That thought kept him up nights, distracted him when he was trying to study. It
"It's the lip gloss." He smiles, his teeth against Sherlock's upper lip, which is confusingly both endearing and darkly sensual.
, I wanted you that night. I wanted you all the time, but that night was different. I couldn't have held it back," he drops his voice into a dark whisper, pushes two fingers against Sherlock, not in, just there, "I got so hard thinking about you that night."
“You’ve been…” Sherlock pushed at the base gently, and John whimpered, gripped Sherlock’s hair tight enough to make him pant. “Just walking round the flat like that?”
“I want," Sherlock gasps out, hoarse and thin, and slides back over John’s trembling body to sink to his knees again. His fingers slip out and he rubs his hands tenderly along the insides of John's thighs, pushes them farther apart. He spreads his hands over the curves of that perfect tight little arse and licks along the crease.
John laughs a little, and darts his tongue out to skate along Sherlock’s skin. He licks a wet trail through coarse black curls, tongue meandering and reverent, pressing hard into soft skin as he mouths kisses down, down, until he's rubbing his hot mouth against Sherlock's bollocks and pushing his legs apart. Sherlock tightens his fingers in John’s hair, the ache in his chest spreading, warring with the heat flooding his belly as John licks at him.
"Sherlock, do you get the feeling we're playing house?" John smiles, but his eyes look sad. He stares at the bed, makes no move to get in it.
“Yeah, problem?” John turns his head, and the tip of his nose brushes Sherlock’s cheek. His stomach contracts, a shiver running down his neck.
“I want you to come like this, in my mouth,” John pulls off, dragging his lips across the tip in a lingering kiss, and tightens his fingers around Sherlock’s.
John keeps up a maddeningly slow pace, luxuriating in the glorious wet slide of his cock inside the body of this extraordinary, perfect man. This man who loves John so much that there
A pub with the team. Sherlock sniffed again. The smell of a cab, and cologne. John didn’t wear cologne. This was familiar, though. Sherlock shut his eyes and tried to place it. Hugo Boss. The cheap kind that they sold at Boots, not the more expensive ones from Harrod's. Owen - that nurse with the nine times broken nose - he wore it. He must have had his arms around John at some point.
"What about now, Sherlock?" John asks mildly one day, as they stand side by side in the kitchen, pouring honey into jars.
Sherlock cleared his throat very quietly. Testing. Observing John’s reaction. That motherfucker. Still observing him, deducing him, like a bloody experiment, after what he’d put him though. John could feel the rage uncoiling inside him, the kind that made him pound people’s faces into tile walls in airport bathrooms. He wanted to beat the shit out of Sherlock, hit that beautiful face until it was putty. He wanted to scream at him, beat on his chest with his fists, make him hurt the way John had been hurting.
He’s still staring at the note, disbelieving of Mrs Hudson’s kindness, trying to process everything that’s happened since they woke up this morning, when footsteps sound in the hall, and he looks up to see a young dark haired police officer standing in the doorway. Stubble, premature grey hairs peppering the dark brown, mouth set in what looks like an almost perpetual frown, enormous liquid brown eyes ringed with thick dark lashes that make him look younger than he is. He can’t be much older than John and Sherlock, maybe twenty two, at the oldest. Sergeant stripes at his collar already. Motivated, a go getter. Perhaps not that intelligent, but knows the system, works overtime. The type that sleeps in his desk chair instead of going home.
Sherlock reluctantly set the blue and silver plastic handled monstrosity down next to John's laptop and lowered himself into his chair. He stared at the package as if he could discern what was inside just by looking at it hard enough. He curled his knees up and set his chin on top of them, and wondered how on earth he could have known John for over a decade now, and have never known that he had relatives in Scotland. What else did he not know about John?
“I know that.” That eyebrow ticks up again, and Sherlock’s reminded forcibly and uncomfortably of his father. “I’ll keep him in line.”
John flushed harder and shook his head. She turned back round and handed him his card, leaned over the bar, ignoring both Owen and Tommy entirely as her eyes trailed up and down John's face. "I always need a ride home after work. Tube's closed at 2:00."
in the distance, but it can't be him, because he can't even feel his mouth moving. His face is numb, scalp sizzling with static, his brain completely offline.
He slips his phone out of the back pocket of his jeans for what has to be the hundredth time since leaving campus just a few hours before, and runs his thumb over the smooth glass. No new notifications. Sherlock should have been here thirty minutes ago.
“I realise I’m not a genius like Sherlock nor one of your incredibly well-trained lackeys, but shockingly I
Sherlock hitched his hips into John's touch, his arm still resting slack against his lap, blood pooling in the crease of his bent knee, and moaned, his eyes falling shut and mouth dropping open. He licked his lower lip as John wrapped his hand around his cock and stroked.
"No." Sherlock said sulkily, fully aware of how foolish he must sound to John, and hating himself for it. "I like Scottish people fine. I just didn't know
"Fine." John muttered, adjusting the makeshift ice pack Sherlock had rigged from a bag of frozen ravioli they'd packed in the cooler, and one of John's socks. "So stupid. I don't know how I didn't see the bloody pile. Just walked right into it."
Sherlock clears his throat and moves his fingers against John's lips. It tickles, the touch too light, and John grins and scratches his lip with his teeth, and Sherlock grins too. They can't stop looking at each other.
to take care of John, viscerally and instinctually. It became his only purpose. John needed help shaving, showering. His legs shook terribly, his hands clutching Sherlock’s forearms every time they wobbled across the room to the bathroom and Sherlock eased the hospital gown off. John turned away, shoulders hunched. Sherlock tried not to look, not to allow his gaze to roam over John’s body, the curve of bone at his hip, ripple of muscle in his thigh, the blessed gunshot scar that was the reason they’d met in the first place. Sherlock had spent years imagining what that gunshot wound looked like, the knotted scar tissue, white and shining, the angry reddened flesh at the center. He wanted to touch it, memorise with his fingertips the evidence of what had brought John to him.
"Oh, fuck yes." It was out of him before he could stop it, a rough low growl, his nose flaring, breathing hard.
John would lay in bed at night, phone pressed against his heart after they’d said goodnight, and stare at the water stains on the ceiling.
“I already have. You know I can’t stay angry at you. Never have been able to.” John tugged at Sherlock’s wrists, pulled him down until their lips met. John nudged at Sherlock’s mouth, his teeth against Sherlock’s bottom lip. His breath suddenly ragged. So hungry. So raw.
Sherlock can barely stand John’s tenderness. It reaches down inside him and turns him inside out, makes it impossible to conceal the torrent of emotions coursing through him. “Yes. Yes, please don’t stop.”
“I think we will. Dr Watson.” He had a strange haircut. Blunt and square. It almost looked as if he did it himself.
Blackfriars Bridge at sunrise glitters like liquid coal, like onyx, the sun reflecting off a century of thick black paint and stone. Parliament looms golden in the west, a bastion of everything proper and official and good about England, everything Sherlock and John aren't. Round one of the Thames S-curves to the east, only the shining white tip of St Paul's, the sky orange and pink behind the dome.
“Is this something that’s in doubt? That I love you?” Sherlock sounds beyond aggrieved. He sounds on the verge of tears.
Sherlock swallows down the aching surge of affection that wells tight in his throat, and tiptoes out of the bedroom, shutting the door gently behind him.
“What we do to each other, you mean, for you affect me just the same,” I draped my arms over John’s shoulders and touched the end of his nose with mine, rocked our foreheads together. My arousal was a liquid throb in my stomach, spreading hot down the insides of my thighs. “God, how I missed you this week, John.”
There's an irregular shaped area of unmarked skin between Sherlock's shoulder blades, right below his cervical vertebrae. John licks at it, Sherlock shivering against him, and makes a promise to himself that he will never again for a single second allow himself to think of Sherlock as selfish or unfeeling, even when he's being a complete berk, because John's been through war and death and people with their arms and legs blown off, and this is worse because Sherlock did this
“Hey, blue eyes.” Gentle cadence, something deeply comforting about this voice. Something vaguely familiar stirred in the back of John’s mind. “Thought I might never get to see those again. No, just, shhhh. Don’t try to talk, or move. I’ll be right back, just getting the nurse.”
“Oh, god, fuck yeah,” John chants, rocking his hips as Sherlock noses along the crease of his pelvis, sucks at the plasticy fabric of his shorts. “Oh, your fucking mouth was made for sucking cock, wasn't it? Look at those lips, Jesus fucking Christ. I can’t wait to see my come all over them.”
Lestrade clears his throat when Sherlock doesn't say anything. "So. Do you have anything solid for me, or what?"
Sherlock shakes the water out of his hair like a dog, feeling cleaner, both inside and out, then he’s felt in months. “This was a brilliant idea, John.”
“Oh...not so long.” Sherlock sank down to the linoleum, between John's knees, brushed a hand over his cheek. "We'll be back there before you know it. As soon as you're released to leave hospital, we're going home."
"We'll see. You need rest. I'm not going to be the reason you end up back in hospital, alright?" Sherlock says softly, his lips centimeters from John's.
“Planning to sleep in your day clothes?” John raises an eyebrow amusedly as he pulls off his own trousers and hangs them over the footboard.
“Alright, well, I’m off. See you at lunch?” Mike winks and doesn’t wait for an answer, jogging quickly down the stands and out of sight.
“Where’s the Honeyduke’s Express trolley, is all I’m worried about,” John yawns and stretches, bumping Sherlock’s shoulder with his elbow. “Sorry. I’m starving.”
He’s still at Baker Street, or at least the layout of the flat is the same. He scans the room while John’s gone, taking in the rich crimson colour of the fireplace wall, the antique furniture, the thick wool rug, patterned with wear. Piles of books sit stacked on the dry wooden floors, pushed against the walls. A finely detailed bone pipe lays on its side on the arm of a green leather chair. A pair of worn leather boots are tucked neatly under John’s chair where his laptop is normally stashed.
John insists they take the second loaf down to Mrs Hudson, and Sherlock reluctantly relents, but later, when the rain has stopped and John is fussing at Sherlock over the state of the flat and Sherlock is getting stroppy with John because he just doesn’t
The blood had flowed out more quickly than John had thought it would, rivulets running over the curve of his arm and dripping onto the white hotel sheets. He was mesmerised by the stinging, the sight of the split open skin. Pressed a fingertip to the wounds, the ache of it going straight to his soul, soothing a pain he couldn’t even name. He'd smeared the blood, painting his forearms with it.
Sherlock’s never been so distracted by anyone before. It’s maddening, the way John’s crept into his consciousness, made a home inside Sherlock like he belongs there.
He tugs at the pyjama bottoms and Sherlock automatically lifts his hips so John can pull them off. No pants underneath. Lovely. His thighs are long and lean, sparse dark hair following the curves of his muscles, and John runs his hands over them as he goes, kneading gently. Tossing the pyjamas carelessly behind him, he finally divests himself of his own clothes, kicking his pyjamas off his feet and yanking his shirt over his head.
John's eyes are going to burst. His skin is cracking. The emotion that's been building through this wretched conversation is starting to leak now, seep around through the cracks and crevices in his facade. Facade. That's what it is. He feels amazingly disingenuous suddenly. As if he's been playacting at something he doesn't even have a script for. As if the last almost two years of their life together has been a deeply fucked up charade.
“Where’s all your stuff? We all have bags and bits of shit we pick up here and there. Mine’s back at my place, but you -- you don’t have a place, just got out here. Where’s your bag?”
Sherlock presses forward, his forehead resting on John’s shoulder, watching himself slowly pushing into John, his breath hitching. It’s tight, so tight, and John’s clawing at his scalp now. He's trembling, his body fighting the intrusion. Sherlock kisses his neck slowly and rocks his hips just fractionally.
"You're sure?" Sherlock stepped forward hesitantly, took John's elbow. Strong fingers encircled the bone, and John pulled himself gently out of Sherlock's grasp, slipped his hand down his arm and took his hand instead.
“I love you so much.” John whispers against Sherlock’s chest, his mind drifting again, to the memory of the first night they spent together in this bed.
Their eyes meet. Sherlock's freckled green eyes are emerald bright in the white winter sunshine, his stare intense. John's belly tingles. Sherlock's tongue darts out and traces the line of his bottom lip. His coal black lashes flutter, blinking under John's unwavering gaze.
gave us this. This has been all you. So. You know how to do something right. Something I certainly haven't sorted out yet."
They fall into each other, mouths and hands and Sherlock half on top of John with a bent knee pressing John’s thigh into the mattress. Sherlock’s hot, so hot, sweaty and flushed, a sliver of mottled pink chest visible in the vee of his shirt collar. John kisses at the side of his mouth and tucks his damp hair behind his ears with shaking fingers.
“I love you too, John.” Sherlock pressed a hard kiss to the middle of John’s brow and hoped that the rest of their time here would be like this. Something uncomfortable still stirred at the back of his mind, the idea of one little hole in a dam allowing the whole bloody thing to burst and destroy everything in it’s path.
quietly. Sitting cross-legged in the middle of his bed, the light from his wand illuminating the small space, he unrolls the message and reads it again.
“Sherlock, I’m not going to break. It’s not even really that bad of an injury, just...a lot of blood because of where it was. I mean it could have been bad, but it wasn’t, and I’m fine. I ruptured my spleen once during a rugby match. That was way worse.” John tilts his head, reaches his hand out and lays it against Sherlock’s back. “Sherlock. Will you fucking look at me, please? I’m starting to get kind of annoyed here. I did take a knife to the gut earlier, maybe you could at least make eye contact?”
, and his own cock twitches. John smiles, looking up at Sherlock from under his eyelashes, which have always driven Sherlock round the bend with how ridiculously long and curved they are, and ghosts his palm over Sherlock’s swelling prick.
He couldn’t even begin to fathom how they would repair all the things that were broken between them, that were broken and wrong inside John. How they would ever again laugh easily at each other over a stale cup of coffee. Some actions weren't forgivable. Some moments weren't eraseable. John didn't know that he could ever forgive either of them, Sherlock or himself.
The little nub of flesh grows harder under Sherlock’s tongue, and he flicks at it gently, enjoying listening to John’s long drawn out moans. He nibbles, rolls pebbled skin between his teeth, and John's breath catches as his fingers tighten in Sherlock's hair. John pushes at his head, just lightly, but the intent is clear.
"It's perfect. When?" Sherlock breathes, half looking at John, but also now running his nose along the edge of the collar, scenting the leather.
“I know. But you’re not weak, John. You’re the strongest person I’ve ever met. This isn’t weakness, it’s just getting well.” Sherlock held John’s arm as he slipped past the blue vinyl curtain into the stall. John braced himself with one hand against the plastic shower surround and allowed Sherlock to reach past the curtain and wash his hair, scrub his back. Sherlock passed a sponge over John’s shoulders, over the scar, allowed his thumb to brush over John's skin. John shivered, and Sherlock tried not to notice how his hips hitched forward. Desire was coiled deep inside of them, desire that had been dormant for far too long, and neither of them was remotely ready for it to be fully unleashed.
Sherlock can't stand the rising tide of affection in his chest. His heart has already staked a claim on this beautiful being - he can't fight it, can't ignore it. It's painful, how much he wants from John, and how much he wants to give in return. Thirty minutes will never be enough. A lifetime won’t be enough.
I yawned loudly, as Watson seemed not yet to have noticed my newly conscious state, and padded softly over to stand at the arm of the chair. His eyes flicked up toward me as his mouth curled at the corner, making his moustache twitch, though he did not lower his paper.
someone for a cigarette right now. This was an old hospital. He glanced over at the window. Yes, they opened. Perfect. “Lester, in my coat. Cigarettes. Give them to me.”
lips? You could make your fortune sucking off half of London if it didn’t all go in your arm. Alright. Come in. Who the fuck is this?” The door swings open all the way, and with a sweep of his arm, he ushers them in.
John can’t help nibbling at his lip as he returns Sherlock’s heated gaze. “You are an absolutely incurable flirt, Sherlock Holmes. You keep it up, I’m going to end up shagging you right over this table.”
“You could apologise to me a few more times. I’d be alright with that.” But John’s mouth twitched up at the corner.
“I wouldn’t know. I’ve nothing to compare today’s performance with.” Sherlock tries for haughty, but Mike knows him too well.
- wanted to sleep at home, with me, and then you - " Sherlock stops, cheeks flushed, looking embarrassed.
There’s nothing adequate to say to that. Sherlock tightens his fingers around John’s as they cross the bridge, feet rattling across the iron grates. In sync, they cross to the other side and John tugs on his hand. “This way. There’s a NatWest on Tooley Street.”
Slowly, he becomes aware of being watched. He thinks maybe he’s been asleep. He drags his eyelids open to find Sherlock’s face inches from his own, his head propped up on his bent arm. His eyes haven’t lost that softness they had when they were having sex. Maybe Sherlock’s just going to look like that from now on. That would be lovely.
to forget a single second of this night. He wants to record it all, lock it away in his memory. He’s making a room, a room in his mind, just for John. A place to catalogue him. The smell of his neck when Sherlock wakes up with his nose in it. The sound of him slurping soup. What his favourite books are, his favourite rugby team. Whether he prefers biscuits with or without chocolate. The feeling of his mouth on Sherlock’s skin. The colour of his hair in every possible light. To watch him age, remember the first laugh line that appears around his mouth, the first time he gets a grey hair.
As he stood in the shower twenty minutes later, steam rising off his back, Sherlock’s voice rang out his mind, deep and rumbling, “John, do you know how many different types of bacteria and fungi are present in a hotel shower stall?”
"John. It's not that simple." There's a warning in his tone, and John hears it, curls his fingers into Sherlock's palm so there's no doubt the meaning behind this.
John tilts his head up, nudges against Sherlock's nose. Deep breath. Their eyes closed. Like a whisper, there's the barest touch of John's lips against Sherlock’s, just not even a kiss really, but touching. Sherlock reciprocates, pulling John’s bottom lip the smallest fraction between his own, and John surges forward, the emotion of everything the last days have wrought coming out between their hungry mouths, his tongue slipping deep into Sherlock’s mouth as they cling to each other. John's touch is so soft, pulling at Sherlock's lips, his tongue moving in counter rhythm. John’s hands in his hair. Sherlock’s hands fanned across John’s scapula, pressing them together. John's licking across Sherlock’s upper lip, making desperate little whimpering noises that make Sherlock tremble. Sherlock's knees go weak. That's never happened before when he’s been kissed. Never. It's silly, it's absurd, out of a bad rom com.
certainly...but it was more than that. Some of that persistent simmering anger dissipated, he clenched his fists less often, sighed rather than shouted about Sherlock’s experiments taking over the kitchen. He seemed more relaxed, he laughed more often, Sherlock was sure of it.
Sherlock grins too, tentatively, and John wonders how long it’s really been for him, because he’s so shy about all this, and John feels a moment of hesitation.
The footfalls stopped just inside the door to his room. He heard a soft intake of breath. He still couldn’t open his eyes. He knew Sherlock would know he was awake. Could never feign sleep with Sherlock around.
“No, I - it’s lovely. Just, I’m only used to hearing it,” John clears his throat, cheeks reddening, “At certain - more private - times.”
feels like an idiot, but John’s warm smile doesn’t allow room for it. “Alright, then where are we going?”
I could say nothing in reply. I let my hands fall from his hip and hair, bracing myself with outstretched arms against the back of the chair, my cock bouncing untouched between my legs as John drove into me. My hands slipped against the leather, palms sweaty. My hair was stuck to my forehead, to the back of my neck - I was burning from the heat of the fire, from John’s equally sweaty body slapping against mine. His cock dragged against my spot as he pulled out slowly and then shoved back in with force, setting a rhythm that had me keening within minutes. As for himself, I could feel how he shook, how his breathing quickened and grew uneven. He was very close.
Sherlock huffs but complies, peeling his shirt off and shimmying his well-fitted trousers down over those long lean thighs that make John’s mouth water. As he turns to step in, John’s gaze wanders over the scars crisscrossing his muscular back, shiny ropes of pink and white that bite into the smooth skin of his shoulder blades, twist around his ribs and down over one sharp hipbone.
about my foot! Are you even listening?! Why can’t you talk about it?? Why can’t you say Yes, I enjoy being in this relationship, I enjoy being in charge, I enjoy when Sherlock’s a weak little kitten who needs Daddy to spank him and tell him he’s a good boy for taking his punishment? That you need this as much as I do? Why can’t you say you need it, that you want it? What are you ashamed of?”
John pushes it open slowly and they slip through. The door shuts out the cacophony of the club, and they're abruptly enveloped in near silence. The room is cold and moonlight blue, though Sherlock knows it's not actually moonlight but just a neon sign at the liquor store next door. He pretends it's the moon.
Fringe dropped him abruptly on the floor. The side of his head smacked against the metal bedframe. Another kick to his back. And another. They were going to beat him unconscious.
, John,” Already spinning dizzily as John’s left hand meanders promisingly down his belly, Sherlock reaches out and tangles his fingers in John’s hair, looking for an anchor. “Do you want - like yesterday, or - ?”
The scrimmage isn’t half as boring as Sherlock thought it would be, though in part because he’s completely entranced by watching John play. He’s certain no one in history has ever ridden a broomstick so effortlessly. Though Sherlock knows very little about sport in general, or Quidditch in particular, it’s obvious that John’s a natural. Not a single try gets past him as he soars back and forth in front of the hoops, batting the Quaffle away easily, using both his muscular arms and occasionally his feet. Once he bashes it with his head and it goes flying way past the rest of the players and lands on the grass at the other end of the pitch. Every now and then he catches Sherlock’s eye and waves, or does a gravity-defying upside down loop that makes Sherlock’s stomach flip over.
You gasped, just a little, when you came to bed hours later and saw me curled under your sheets. But then you were crawling in beside me, and when I reached out an arm, you let me hold you. I fell back asleep with my lips against your spine and your ice cold feet tucked between my ankles, and I’d never felt more peaceful.
at my assent, rolling against me hard and hot, kissed my neck and my hair, and your hands were everywhere at once. It was so hot under the covers we were both sweating in minutes, your sinewy forearm glistening against my chest as you pulled me against you. I had sweat in my eyelashes when I turned and caught your mouth, pulled your tongue between my lips, salt and toothpaste and last night’s garlicky pasta.
“Shhh, go back to sleep, darling,” John murmurs against Sherlock’s sleep warm throat. He slides his arm across Sherlock’s ribs, pulls him close and squeezes.
He kissed me in response, fierce and hard, nipping at my bottom lip and making me gasp. His hand cupped possessively around the back of my head, holding me in place, and tilted his head to deepen the kiss. I submitted willingly to him, parting his lips with my tongue and licking decadently slowly into the warm wet cavern of his mouth. He hummed against my tongue as his thumb rubbed a circle behind my right ear.
"Alright, love. Separate showers if we must. Though I'll miss you." John eased himself off of Sherlock and padded off to the bathroom.
“I believe you.” Sherlock says. And he does. For the first time in years, he looks around and sees the faces of people he can trust, people who love him and believe in him, and more than anything he wants to preserve this, to not let Jim poison his life anymore. He looks from John to Molly, and then to Lestrade. “Tell me what I have to do.”
Interrupting Sherlock with a finger to his lips, John murmured, “Shhhh. You don’t have to be. I’m not trying to get you hard. I just love every part of you. I love your cock.” John had said, pressing another loose lipped kiss there and sitting up. “You don’t have an obligation to get hard every time I touch you. You know that, baby. So, just, stop apologising.”
He didn’t even know what Sherlock was asking for, but he nodded weakly, hands still over his face. He couldn't say no to Sherlock, never could. Then Sherlock was screeching a chair across the floor and sitting down in it, he could feel his proximity. He could smell the fucking Belstaff, wool and tobacco and mints. He shook and shook, nervous perspiration soaking into the hospital sheets. He didn’t know what to do.
John hears the shower come on as he cracks two eggs into the pan and gets the sugar out of the cabinet for Sherlock’s coffee. His phone buzzes.
It wasn’t what John had always imagined it would be like to kiss Sherlock. It wasn’t sparks and fire. It wasn’t electricity racing down his spine. It was beautifully, wondrously familiar. It was what they should always have been - had already been, without acknowledging it. Sherlock’s lips were silken, almost unbelievably soft, against John’s wrecked bloody mouth. There was a brief dart of a tongue licking John’s top lip, and then Sherlock pulled back, staring into John’s face.
Five minutes later, John's clothes lay kicked haphazardly in the corner of the bathroom and the mirror over the sink is already fogged with stream. John watches admiringly as Sherlock bends over the tub, pouring some kind of posh heavily fragranced bath oil under the tap.
"I wasn't finished." John stands on his toes, reaches up and feels around until he locates a small cube, no bigger than a die.
“I don’t feel like an eighteen year old sometimes, Sherlock.” John’s fingers twist into his hair again, thumb rubbing idly over his eyebrow.
Now Sherlock could have cared less about the damned bags. He wanted John's arms around him again, heavy and solid, John's warm breath against his skin, the slight scrape of his late evening stubble. He sighed, acquiescing, knowing they'd regret it tomorrow morning if they woke up in a house with no coffee and no shampoo, no dressing gowns or clean pants. Stumbling out into the frigid Scottish morning in dirty clothes to search for coffee wasn't the ideal way to start a holiday, no matter how inviting John felt at the moment.
Sherlock thinks about it, moves his hips and clenches his muscles experimentally, and John laughs low in his throat, petting down Sherlock’s back and kissing his cheek over and over.
“Alright. Time to go in, I suppose.” He locates a bin with an overflowing ashtray tucked in the side, and stubs out the cigarette. Alchemy slips gracefully back into his favourite spot, only his eyes visible, glittering black over the edge of Sherlock’s collar.
Sherlock grabs his long woolen coat off the rack by the door, and John easily drops an arm around Sherlock’s waist as they walk out. It feels absolutely right, and Sherlock drapes his arm across John’s broad shoulders in return.
working, sex is a pleasurable necessity. Sherlock's taken home plenty of gorgeous young bodies, all long dark hair tangled in their eyelashes and eager wet kisses - sometimes he's even gone back for seconds before his usual terse dismissal of them from his flat - but The Work always takes precedence over the simplistic needs of the flesh.
Sherlock's hand in his. Sherlock's hand not rotting under ground. No, this hand was warm and real and John could feel Sherlock's pulse thumping in his wrist.
Rose has the good grace to look at least a bit ashamed. “It just sort of - slipped out. I didn’t think you would mind.”
The conflicting emotions in him are confusing as hell. He can’t shake the sense of embarrassment at being fucked up against a wall with Sherlock’s hand over his mouth. No. It’s not embarrassment at that. It’s embarrassment at how much he liked it. That he wouldn’t mind if it happened that way again. That he would in fact
John stirred slowly, wincing and grumbling. He blinked drowsily a few times and looked up at Sherlock, confusion written in every line of his face. The spark of recognition and then something like fear flared in his eyes, and for a moment, Sherlock was sure John was going to scramble backwards and get as far away from him as possible. A mistake. This had all been some drugged reaction to seeing Sherlock again, and any second John was going to mutter a
Sherlock loves rain. The smell of it, pulling ancient damp out of the London sidewalks, turning it into something fresh and clean and cool. The sound of it, smacking against windowpanes, dropping off overhangs. The light inside when it’s raining, grey and calm. Rain is soothing. London rain is omnipresent, constant. Even on the sunniest day, London is a city built for rain. It belongs here.
Sherlock took the angry skin between his teeth again, sucking hard enough to break blood vessels, John tensing his curled leg around Sherlock’s shoulder and gasping out bitten off little cries. When Sherlock was satisfied he’d made a mark that would be a lovely purplish maroon in the morning, he lapped at it gently and kissed over it, up over the waist of the kilt and pressed his lips against John’s belly.
The door next to John opens and the scent of espresso and warm milk, dark chocolate and pastry dough, billows out on a warm rush of air. The couple exiting the coffee shop brush past John, not even noticing him standing there. Hands entwined, their faces tilted toward each other, far too entranced with one another to mind anyone else.
while he was leaning over the side? He must have cleared the alley, people shielding their eyes as they ran.”
"John, I think you need to sit down." Sherlock takes him by the elbow and leads him over to the cracked leather sofa, pushes him gently into it. "Better?"
"You can't be here?" John repeats dumbly, staring at Sherlock cleaning his foot with an alcohol wipe and putting a plaster over it.
. It’s actually quite common for men with brown hair to grow ginger beards. Carriers for the recessive gene on Chromosome 4. But you don’t
"You take my breath away like this." John bends forward and presses a soft kiss on Sherlock's neck just above the collar. "What do you think, sweetheart?"
came out easily, but there’s so much more. So many things he needs John to know. He’s never been good with emotion, with
Sherlock grunts and grumbles, but pushes up off of John’s lap and throws his legs over the side of the bed. John watches him stretching and yawning his way into the bathroom, his shoulders still a bit sloped. He looks downtrodden. “Hey.”
“I love how much you love that.” John whispers, voice hoarse with arousal. “God, it makes me so hard to hear you like this. You’re spectacular, you’re brilliant. I want you so bad, baby, god you can't
He nods, flies back down the steps, slips on his bloody shoes and falls halfway down, cracking his back hard and knocking his head against the railing. It's nothing. He doesn't even notice. Crawls across the floor to kneel beside John. John is deathly pale, his chest fluttering shallowly, everything is blood, blood everywhere. Sherlock gathers his head onto his folded knees and kisses his forehead.
“I love you.” John’s voice is husky, he sounds like he might cry. Sherlock’s worried suddenly that something is wrong.
“No need to apologise.” John stretches back and up, pressing a kiss to the end of Sherlock’s nose. “I wouldn’t have you any other way.”
Sherlock eventually drifted off with a smile on his lips, and missed the silent figure who came to stand in the doorway in the early hours of the morning. Malvo wasn’t there for John, but he was a compiler of information. He liked knowing people’s weaknesses. John’s weakness was very evidently this lanky alien looking man squeezed beside him in the hospital bed. That could be very useful information, should he ever need leverage.
"It's not your fault, you know. Whatever happened to him. It's not your fault, dear. It's clear he's very special to you, and I'm sure you'd never hurt him." She blows the smoke out of the side of her mouth, pats his knee. “I’m sure he loves you very much too.”
Sherlock pulls John toward the steps to his room, shaking his head. “God, yes, John, I am so sure. I think about you
“I’m glad I tricked you in the train car. This wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t.” Sherlock cocks one eyebrow and grins crookedly.
"I'm hardly middle aged, John, thank you." Sherlock fingers sneak under the hem of John's jumper, gentle and slow, cold enough they make him jump.
Sherlock doesn’t sleep. He watches the fluttering of John’s heartbeat in his temple, thinks about the blood in his veins, keeping him alive, the blood on the tile at St Mark’s, and a cold deadly fury skids the lengths of his nerves. He turns over his plan in his mind, over and over, searching for holes, for mistakes, for ways he could really monumentally fuck this up. He rubs his fingers over DS Lestrade's card in his pocket and stares out into the grey sky, until he can't think anymore, until all his thoughts are running together and he's losing the threads that connect them.
"More what, baby?" John darted his tongue out and swept his face back and forth, squeezed the inside of Sherlock's thigh.
Lightburn half turned her head over her shoulder to answer, but kept walking. “It’s sad, really. Local girl, grew up here in Cairndow. She’d been away in Glasgow for, oh, about twenty years. Just came back a few months ago to take over her dad’s business after he passed.”
She squeezed his arm, smiled kindly and left the room. Lester came over and pulled the chair back up beside the bed. He smiled at John, confusion behind his eyes. “You alright, John?”
A pair of canvas chairs under an ancient oak tree. A long eared dog asleep on a hearth rug. Sherlock’s eyes twinkling emerald and cerulean in the firelight, his hair silver. John’s hand curled around a cracked coffee mug.
.” Sherlock’s face split into a wide grin, and he chuckled softly, kneading John’s shoulders and neck.
John's mouth waters, actually waters, and he swallows hard, remembering when this all began, the first time he wanted to pin Sherlock down, put his hands and his mouth on him, make him mindless with pleasure.
, it was Mycroft, most definitely. Probably in one of those awful skin tight jogging outfits he has. Can you imagine the
Now, as then, clearly they have to discuss something Mycroft doesn’t feel comfortable writing down. Sherlock easily dismisses it being family-related - they’ve no grandparents left, no other siblings, no extended family to speak of, and his parents were both fit and healthy when he left for Hogwarts only a week previous.
“Well, just tell me if you do.” With a crack so loud it sounds as if the roof is caving in, lightning flashes in the window and the rain begins, hard and driving, beating against the window. Sherlock turns to look at it, thinking of how the rain always comes in rivers down the steps into St Mark’s, no matter how well he blocks the entrance, soaking his sleeping bag, leaving him curled in a ball like a wet bedraggled cat.
Every time, the body count doesn't matter, the destruction the happens before, it's inconsequential. It's not that he doesn't care, as John accused him of so long ago, it's simply that he's realistic. He understands people
what year it is. John’s still here, and John is really all he ever needed. Linear time is mostly a construction of human science anyway…
“Always.” The man’s voice is sickly smooth, quiet. He runs his hand up Sherlock’s leg, thumbs over his balls. Right here. On a park bench with a million kids about.
“Tease. You are an insufferable tease, Sherlock Holmes.” His voice was already low and gruff, and he was shifting restlessly in his seat. His sizeable erection - his cock was beautifully formed, just as was the rest of him - was tenting his thin nightshirt, and I could sense how much he wanted to take himself in hand, as he slid both palms down over his hips and dug his thumbs into his thighs.
please,” Sherlock begs, mouthing blindly at John’s forearm, resting on the rumpled sheets alongside Sherlock’s head. He succeeds only in licking the crease of John’s elbow, which is strangely erotic.
The look John tosses over his shoulder as he disappears into the bathroom could melt sand into glass. Sherlock rolls and looks at the clock. Barely six. Back when they were what they used to be, more than friends but less than this, Sherlock would listen to John getting up for work at the clinic. Six on the dot every morning, John’s feet would hit the wooden floorboards of his bedroom, and Sherlock would try to find a way to look like he was doing anything except waiting to watch John walk down the steps in just his pants, dressing gown slung over his arm, his hair messy and rumpled.
"It's not nothing. Who did that to you? I swear to god, I will kill them with my bare hands. Fuck the gun. I will choke the fucking life out of them. I will, I will fucking
He fiddled with the Sherlock’s watch, thumbing over the crack. He wished it would slice his thumb open, make him bleed. He was fascinated by blood, guessed he always had been a bit, being a doctor. Doctors had to be a little blood hungry, or the job would be unbearable. But it was deeper now, transformed. He would get mesmerised by the blood on his hands after he beat someone; the split skin, the cracks at the edges of scrapes from missing skull and hitting brick instead, how it dried in brown streams down his wrists. How it dried in the creases of his knuckles and didn’t come out for days.
“I already told you. Take anything you need from me, John.” Sherlock laid his arm flat against John’s leg, the blood now coagulating, the smears on his arm brownish and dry. "I'm yours. I want you to do this to me. I asked you to, remember?"
"God, John." Sherlock put his hands on every part of John's body he could, over his trembling belly, his shaking thighs, his neck, taut and straining. Finally he closed his hand around John's cock and stroked him gently as John rocked and pushed up into his touch.
I have never seen anything in my life as mesmerising as John Watson when he is aroused; his normally indigo eyes deepened to the darkest shade of blue, the colour of the most unknown oceanic depths, changeable and unpredictable; the veins on his arms ropey and protruding; his torso flushed to the navel, the golden hairs that dust his muscular body shimmering with perspiration. He is a specimen of manliness. Yet somehow, he is also gentled; the soft upward curve of his mouth, the sweet intonation of his voice as he speaks to me, the tender care with with he caresses my body. He is both commanding and pliant, both rough and kind. He is a compassionate lover, taking as much care with, and joy in, my pleasure as he does his own.
Sherlock keeps himself from making a smart arse remark about John having just said the exact same thing. “Sorry.”
The little shit holds his hands up in deference. He’s on his knees in the back seat, half out of his pants. He’s repulsive. Sherlock fights gagging, covers his mouth with a dirt smeared hand. “I don’t want any trouble from you.”
“So. You’re a club kid, eh?” John laughs, and Sherlock dives down, captures the rest of his laugh in his mouth. John licks into his mouth, purring a happy little noise, and Sherlock kisses him harder, pulling him up until he’s off his feet, toes barely touching the sidewalk.
It's too much. John can't look into those perfect eyes any longer, not when they're having this conversation. He takes his coffee between both hands and gets up, paces over to the evidence wall and stares at it with unseeing eyes.
Sherlock bent his back, wanting more of those bristly warm kisses. He rather liked himself over John's lap this way, too. He shifted slightly, laid his cheek against his forearms over the arm of the sofa and stretched his legs out so his feet hooked over the other arm. John pushed his shirt up further and kissed gently between his shoulder blades. Sherlock's spine buzzed with electricity.
He showered and smoked, wandered down to the hotel cafe for a coffee, and then got behind the wheel of the Buick. He breathed hard, tried to focus on the job at hand.
,” I said sulkily as I tugged the newspaper from his grip and allowed it to flutter to the floor, “At all hungry for
“Oh no. Absolutely not. I know where that leads. I’ll help you in and I’ll help you out. That’s it.”
"Whether it was done out of concern or not is inconsequential, John. I'm not your pet, to be led around by a leash and patted on the head and given my daily treats. I'm submissive to you, but I'm also a grown man, and you seem to have blurred the lines in your mind.”
John reaches up with a dripping wet hand, sinks it into the cloud of soft curls. Sherlock sighs and presses back into John’s touch. John circles his fingertips, rubs his thumb against the nape of Sherlock’s neck. “Talk to me, Sherlock.”
The smell of Sherlock’s hair after he’s smoked one, thinking John wouldn’t know. Even at a distance, passing behind him as he made a cup of tea or sat at some experiment, John could smell his shampoo mixed with that tobacco smell, and he would shake his head and laugh to himself. Silly Sherlock. Quirky, funny, ridiculous Sherlock. Clever, infuriating Sherlock. Dead Sherlock.
"That counts." Not as satisfying as the first ever, but still good. He runs his fingers down over John's bollocks, soft skin, soft hair, and tugs a little as he rocks up on his knees to get a better angle. John's response is breathtaking, tilting his hips toward Sherlock's hand, grabbing into his hair with shaking fingers, a long low moan quivering through him as his mouth falls open. His thighs are trembling, the lean muscles twitching already.
“He’ll kill you first.” Sherlock says unapologetically, touching his fingertips to the wound on John’s belly. John has to understand.
on the up and up, understand? If we fuck it up, and do something illegal, the whole goddamned thing is pointless.”
"We should stay here forever. Mrs Hudson can bring up takeaways to fortify us." Sherlock says against John's mouth, grinning.
“Just let me warm up a little first.” Sherlock slips back into his chair, this time moving it forward enough that their knees bump under the table.
We did not often express ourselves in long poetic speeches, nor even in those three simple words that seem to drop so easily from other lovers’ mouths. The language of our commitment to one another was in the press of Watson’s lips to my hairline as he boiled coffee for us on some grey winter morning. It was in the glorious tangle of our sweaty limbs under a mountain of blankets, giggling like boys and shushing each other so Mrs Hudson would not hear us as she laid on our tea in the next room. It existed in the proud squeeze of my hand on Watson’s arm when he came up with something brilliant to break open a difficult case, or the protective weight of his palm against the small of my back as we climbed into a cab. Both being fairly terse men, especially where sentiment was concerned, our love was a language of touch.
Sherlock's head dips into John's neck, lips dragging so lightly along the swell of his shoulder, up to tug at his earlobe, down to mouth at his scar. He's exploring, tasting. John can hear his loud inhalations, feel it as the tip of Sherlock's nose rubs gentle circles in his skin.
John rolls his head up into Sherlock’s touch like a cat, closes his eyes and draws in a deep breath. His knees slide up so he can maneuver on top of Sherlock, his feet slipping icily along Sherlock’s calves. He’s hard now - already - and they haven’t even kissed yet. His cock is thick inside his pants, nudging against the elastic waistband, and all Sherlock can think is
John reaches down and palms Sherlock very deliberately through his jeans, his blue eyes roiling clouds and thunder like a summer storm. "I could just do you."
John can feel Sherlock’s eyes on him. He looks up even as his mouth sinks lower, taking Sherlock in until his nose is buried in musky dark curls. Sherlock is gnawing at his lips, watching himself disappearing into John’s mouth. His eyes are so black with desire that there’s barely the thinnest ring of green around the pupils. As soon as their eyes meet, Sherlock’s body contracts, his legs curling tight against John’s ears, and his cock thickens and pulses. A salty burst of precome coats the back of John’s tongue and palate as Sherlock shifts and squirms underneath him.
"Because you needed me to take care of you. Because you --" John can feel himself flailing, looking for something to anchor himself to. He feels like he's falling down a well and clawing at the slick stone walls.
Fuck. If he closes the door now, Jim will be too suspicious. Maybe the distance from the sofa and the sound of water will muffle the soft click of the button. It's his only shot.
"Don't you dare try that again." John pinches in the center of the handprint he just left, before moving his hand back to Sherlock's waist and resuming the steady pumping of his hips. "Just from me fucking you. You come like this or not at all."
Rising more gracefully than a gangly almost forty year old had any right to, Sherlock stood and tipped his head down, looking at John’s bare feet on the wood floor. “Yes, John.”
“Yes, pick up the package. That will be your...assignment once my…this issue in Bemidji is resolved.” John could almost hear the guy wringing his hands.
John can barely breathe, his entire body is hot and shivering, looking down at their cocks pressed together, flushed maroon sliding between his pale fingers. No, god, he’s never done this with anyone, he’s never felt this until he looked up in that lab and saw those shining verdigris eyes boring into him and he knew he’d never be the same again. He’s never had sex that feels like he’s flying, free falling through space, clutching the other person to him just so he doesn’t crash. He’s never done anything like love Sherlock Holmes before - there’s no comparison to peeling back every layer of himself until he’s seething and raw and exposed, letting another person hold every broken wrong piece of him until they don’t feel wrong anymore. He’s never been owned before, owned someone else. God no, he’s never done
blue eyes that Sherlock can never stop looking into, no matter how hard he tries to look somewhere else - are contemplative, almost melancholy.
John’s puttering in the kitchen now, cupboards being rattled, bowls set on the counter. John’s set Sherlock’s chemistry things on the floor by the door to the hallway, his usual spot for them when he’s doing anything food related and needs space. Sherlock folds the laptop closed and unfolds himself from the chair. He hasn’t moved in hours. Stands up and stretches, the muscles in his back protesting rather stringently. He shakes out the stiffness -
John slides up, kissing his way - navel, ribs, sternum - gets distracted by Sherlock’s nipples and stops. He cups his hand over Sherlock’s right hipbone and puts his mouth over his left nipple, tongue moving in maddening little circles, while his lips stay soft and hot against Sherlock’s skin. He drapes his leg over Sherlock’s thigh and cants his hips, hard against him, so
John shook his head, finally found his voice. He croaked out, "I can't. I'm afraid of myself, afraid of...I just
All before he knew what John was going through. He’d had no idea what effect his death would have on John. He knew he’d miss him, of course, but thought he’d be alright. Be stable, at least. Now he knew better.
, that it’s heartbreaking. He wants to wrap John up in these overwarm blankets that smell like their bodies, close the curtains, stay here in this room forever - suspended in time - and never allow anyone to hurt John Watson ever again. Even himself.
You turned me on my back, looking down at me with lust-drenched eyes, that crooked smile playing on your kiss swollen lips, and I couldn’t get you close enough. My entire body wanted you, I couldn’t touch you with enough of my skin.
“Um. Jim would slit my fucking throat if I touched that, a fact which both he and I know well. He knows I won’t mess with it.”
John's so happy suddenly it almost hurts. Sherlock's smiling up at him with the warmth of the goddamn
“Minnesota. He was one of the - he was in a group of homeless people. I picked up...someone. And he was there. I remember his face.” John cups Sherlock’s cheek, strokes a thumb along his jaw. “He must work for Malvo. Shit.”
Little consolation knowing these things when Jim is out there, when no place feels safe. Little consolation in a life so full of exhausting and frightening moments; in a neverending search for clean needles and safe places to sleep, knives slashing in the dark, digging through bins for half drunk Costa's cups and half smoked cigarettes, blood and vomit and terror and always being on the edge of something dangerously dark and bigger than himself.
"Spine straight. Put your knees together. Good boy." John sits back and crosses his legs, left ankle over right knee. "Safeword?"
John shuts the door and locks it with a quiet click. He doesn't turn around. Sherlock’s arms instinctively close around his waist, where they belong.
John keeps whispering filthy beautiful words against his ear, kissing at his neck, tugging at his earlobe with his teeth, and stroking him slow and rhythmic - until he’s weak with it, until he can’t do anything except push John over on his chest on the sink counter, and drape himself over John’s back with a growl. His fingers are still slick with lip gloss as he circles them around John’s hole and kisses the nape of his neck.
Sherlock's beyond caring. He looks John up and down, and turns on his heel, crosses the kitchen. "What are you going to do? Hit me? Go ahead. You want to, I can tell."
“Oh, I missed it. That was the cottage right behind us. Let me just - “ Sherlock turned the van carefully in the muddy gravel filled road edge and backtracked to a long narrow drive bordered with wildflowers and scrubby hedges.
The next morning John’s sore and and stiff, everything aching, his eyelids feeling much more like sandpaper than skin. He wakes up late, nearly noon, and Sherlock's gone. He checks his phone and there's a text,
John steps forward menacingly, wielding his broom like a weapon. “No one uses that word anymore. That’s some old fashioned offensive bullshit, is what that is, What’s your problem? Sherlock doesn’t want to talk to you, I don’t want to talk to you. Just piss off, mate, let’s not have an issue here.”
"Then don't. Talk to me about something else. Tell me about dinner with Stamford the other night. About that play you saw in Covent Garden last week. Just talk to me. All we talk about is cases anymore." Sherlock smiles crookedly, now absently rubbing circles on John's back. "Perhaps I subconsciously excluded you from this morning's activities because -- because I want to talk to you about something other than work. I
Sherlock cuts him off, shoves a finger into his sternum. "No. I didn't. I needed to stay and solve the case, like I've always done. I could have slept today. I could have eaten at the Yard. I didn't need those things last evening. That was all
Sherlock swallows hard, trying to get some moisture back in his mouth. Rising shakily from the sofa, he's heading to the window to look down into the street when John strides back into the room, carrying a large oil lamp in one hand and an old fashioned black leather doctor’s bag in the other.
“I am. You do, too, you know.” Sherlock rubbed his toes against John’s ankle bone and leaned back in his chair with a hum.
“Please.” He murmurs against Sherlock’s open mouth, tongue still lapping at the inside of John’s lips. “Please, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s refused to see it because he’s been afraid of this, of them, what they are, and all the things they could be. Afraid of letting down his guard enough to truly let John love him.
The ripple of arousal that courses through him makes his mouth drop open and he licks his lips and sucks the bottom one into his mouth, crosses his arms over his chest, trying to cover it. "No."
“That sounds nice. We’ll take two.” The man smiled up at her as sweetly as a hungry crocodile, but she didn’t notice.
“Is it our anniversary, then?” Sherlock says quietly, not even half joking, and rubs his thumb over the back of John’s hand.
- times, but." Sherlock's speech is coming on short puffs of air, sucking and biting at John's chest, everything between them right now frenetic heat and want.
“No.” Sherlock realises he doesn’t want to, doesn’t want to black out, doesn’t want to forget everything. Because now there are moments worth remembering. He takes John’s hand, brings it to his mouth and sucks a fingertip between his lips. “I have plans for tonight that are better.”
“Up you get. Come on. We’re going to ride with him to hospital. That’s it.” Her grip is surprisingly firm around his bony elbow as she kicks the drugs and the syringes under the blanket with a severe look at Sherlock. She’s the only person who’s realised, realised that he lives here. She guides him up the steps behind the two paramedics bearing John on a stretcher. Sherlock can’t look at him.
"No. Bet you don't either." John sucks his cheeks between his teeth and somehow his eyes get even bigger, looks up at Sherlock from under those movie star eyelashes. He’s a literal fucking
"I know, John." Sherlock smiles at John's furrowed brow, brushes his fingertip over the bridge of his nose. "I wasn't suggesting it. Merely explaining that other couples do things differently."
These names. These friendships with good, kind people. They belonged to a different life, a John Watson he could barely comprehend anymore. Just typing them felt foreign, disrespectful even. He didn’t have a right to them anymore.
Jim cocks a grin that's all sharp white teeth and sweeps his hand behind him. "Well, do come in, my pet. I expected you
Sherlock moans and slowly lays back, reaching one hand out to stroke at John's stomach and adjusting the pillow behind his head with the other. "Come here."
“You can.” He licks a circle around the head, nudges the foreskin back with the tip of his tongue. “Come in my mouth. You can.”
Sherlock fought back a laugh and settled back against the couch. John's hand fell into his hair, twirling a lock between his fingers. A warm buzz of electricity skidded down his neck, scalp tingling, numbed only slightly by the rather large amount of scotch he'd drunk thus far.
"Christ." The head of his cock pushes through the button up of his boxers and rubs wet against Sherlock's stomach and fuck, he really needs to get a condom on, but this feels good, so good his thighs are already shaking, arousal burning through his veins and hot in his belly, between his legs.
, Sherlock. And you. You've spent the last two weeks letting me be angry with you and shout at you for lying to me, when you had - and this - and Jesus, how could you let me do that, Sherlock?"
The seventh day, John could get up and walk without too much help. He hobbled to the chairs by the window, thin fingers gripping Sherlock’s wrist. The snow had abated, drifts five feet or so resting against the beige brick. Icicles were melting, carving deep holes in the piled snow below them. Sherlock lowered John carefully into the chair, and turned the metal knob that opened the window.
He thinks maybe if he talks it will keep the tears at bay, so he chokes out, "You're going to make me cry," which isn't at all what he meant to say, and it's too vulnerable and too honest, something neither of them is very good at being.
“Sure thing. I’ll just wait out here until you have all that ready.” He was itching to smoke, and he had a phone call to make.
Sherlock grinds back against John, clutching at his hip with exploring fingers. “Oh, John, John, right there,
Sherlock sobs once, ragged and choked, as his fingers contract inside John. The sound of Sherlock’s pleasure and the pressure on his prostate are too much. He feels himself tipping over, his limbs shaking, hot chills racing over his skin. “Sherlock, I -” John comes with a bitten off whine, his leg wrapped tight around Sherlock's hip, fucking himself on Sherlock’s fingers and biting into his lip until the skin snaps under his teeth.
Noon was three hours away. He pulled on his cigarette, sharp burning filling him up. He’d never smoked before Sherlock died. Never once.
She said it with all the flourish as if she’d just announced the arrival of the Queen, rearing back dramatically and planting her hands on her hips. Sherlock had to hold in the scoffing laugh that was threatening.
"As long as you're getting what you need, too. Everything is for you, Sherlock. I meant that. It wasn't the sex talking." John grinned, despite the seriousness of the conversation, and brushed his lips over Sherlock's.
“Five more minutes,” Sherlock mumbles back, suddenly unable to even open his eyes. He curls an arm over John’s stomach.
"I thought we could - kind of - ease in." John clears his throat. He knows he's been hesitant, knows Sherlock's been silently patient. "I know we haven't tried anything...new. I just thought we should let the dust settle before we introduced something...Like what we talked about."
me right now, Sherlock? This. This fucked up disaster of a person right here - it's because I thought I lost you. You idiot. Yes. I fucking love you so much it almost
“I’ve always been. Always.” Sherlock says seriously. He covers John’s hand on his hip with his own larger one, squeezes, and then bends to brush a whisper-light kiss against John’s hair. “Be right back.”
- Sherlock, I - ” John makes a low choked sound and stills, places a carefully light kiss to the end of Sherlock’s nose. He’s panting, voice breathless. “Are you - alright?”
“I’m just gonna - I can’t stand not to brush my teeth first thing. I’m just going to pop to the loo and I’ll be right back.” Fingers trail lightly down Sherlock’s ribs, dance over his hip. John looks down at him as he kneels up on the bed and backs out from under the blankets. “Don’t you move, gorgeous.”
Fuck. Shit. He should have known there would be police involved. His mind starts racing, trying to sort out a story that doesn’t involve Jim, because then they truly would be dead. Jim’s slippery as a fish, he’ll never end up in prison. They’ll probably end up dead anyway, because John wasn’t meant to live, and he’s alive. Jim will never leave them alone.
John kisses the insides of his thighs, close and urgent, his nose pressed into his flesh.There’s something so tender about it, Sherlock’s eyes burn. He strokes John’s hair,  feeling flayed open by the intensity of this, of John’s unrepentant willingness to give themselves completely to each other.
“Yes. I’m sure he’s quite tied up with all that, though of course they wouldn’t quote him in an article - not when they could quote Potter instead.” Sherlock waves a hand dismissively, and drinks the rest of his coffee in one gulp. “Ready to head down to the pitch?”
He couldn’t bear to see John cry. Swooping down and wiping the tear away with his thumb, Sherlock kissed him again, murmuring into his mouth, “It’s alright, it’s alright.”
He's never been so distracted on a case before. Such distractions are frivolous, pointless - a monumental waste of intellectual and physical energy. When he’s
Sherlock's heels dig into his back and John shifts and relaxes and lets Sherlock's tensed thighs and restless hands pull him all the way in, buried inside Sherlock, and the knowledge of that is almost too much to bear, because it's
By the time they get home from the party, though, they’re both more than half drunk and ready for sleep. John gets Mrs Hudson settled in her flat, and practically crawls into bed. Sherlock follows soon after and they curl tightly together with chaste kisses and murmured endearments. Sherlock falls asleep quickly, as he usually does, and John tries, slotting up along the comfortingly familiar plane of Sherlock’s back and breathing in the smell of him as he inhales and exhales deep and rhythmic, trying to make himself relax.
After he was dried off and dressed, he cracked a window, and laid back on bed. Lit a cigarette and pulled out his mobile.
. Sherlock wants to - needs to - know every single thing about him. He wants to take John to all his favourite places in Muggle London, show him the museums and the cafes, take him to Waterstone’s and sit on the floor reading together, their knees touching. He wants to touch that golden hair and see if it’s as soft as it looks. He wants John’s nose sliding up the side of his own, and his mouth -
Sherlock snaps himself out of his reverie by closing his eyes and brushing his mouth over the inside John’s bent knee. John trembles and drops a hand to Sherlock’s waist, pulling him forward. The head of Sherlock’s cock nudges just inside, and John lets out a shuddering exhalation, fingers digging painfully into the soft skin above Sherlock’s hips. Sherlock pushes home slow and steady, trying not to give in to the overwhelming need to just thrust and fuck and slam John up against the counter as hard as he can.
Please note there is drug use in this chapter, just briefly, but if it's a trigger for you, fair warning.
“Feels like I just saw you two - oh that’s right, I did.” She’d been at Greg’s party the night before. “Way to kick off Greg’s retirement.”
"I didn’t mean... I’m sorry. It won’t happen again." Tommy looked shocked and concerned. He backed up a step.
Sherlock bit back a groan, the heady buzz of arousal sweeping through him hot and thick. He could stay like this forever; the sweet warmth of their bodies moving against each other under the blankets, John’s fingers tight against his thigh, John's chest heaving sweaty in Sherlock's arms. The dense heady smell of their combined arousal drifted over him and even laying down, the tendons in his knees went loose and weak. How there was ever a time he'd survived without this, Sherlock had no idea.
John and Sherlock break apart as though they’ve been electrocuted. John's lips are tingling as he turns to see Greg Lestrade, Sally Donovan, and half of London bomb disposal. Greg is staring at him, hands on hips, his cheeks blushed with a bit of second hand embarrassment, but his eyes are sparkling. He raises his eyebrows at John and John just shrugs. Greg tosses his head back and laughs.
But spring term ended, and John went off to America for a summer surgical internship at Johns Hopkins. Sherlock was away in France with his family. There was no time to meet before school picked up again.
"Tell me what?" John's voice lazy and soft with affection, his fingertip tracing Sherlock's cheekbone and then back to his ear, carding through his curls.
Instead he clears his throat and puts his glasses on the end of his nose, picks up his book. “I’ll pop down to Mrs Hudson’s in a bit, make sure she’s ready for dinner tonight.”
"I love you, John. No one else could ever take care of me the way you do." Sherlock nuzzles his face into John's pectoral, brushes his lips over his skin.
“Alright. When will I? I do like to know who I’m working for.” John grimaced through another memory shooting through his mind with all the pain of a blood vessel bursting.
All he wants in the heaviness of Sherlock in his arms, that sweet mouth falling on his again. It feels dangerously simple, just this once, to take what he wants. To give both of them the solace in one another that they’ve denied themselves for so many years. Austerity does apparently have its limits.
"Your back is beautiful. Your trapezius muscle is absolutely perfectly shaped. A specimen. Example of human anatomy in it's highest form." He licks at the writhing muscle, contracted from Sherlock's hands held behind him, nips at Sherlock's neck. "Your thoracic vertebrae, straight and even. Like a Grecian statue." Kisses each vertebra until he reaches Sherlock's fists. His arms are starting to shake with the effort of holding them in the small of his back. "Oh, lovely. It's hard to hold still like that, isn't it? Here, I'll help you."
Sherlock’s fingers are drying. Without another moment of hesitation, he takes John into his mouth and slips his index finger around to rub at his entrance. John curls off the bed immediately with a loud shuddering exhalation, whimpers
Sherlock nodded almost brusquely, and then allowed himself a small grin. "Good," he said again, his eyes on John's mouth.
He’d been in America for less than an hour and already left someone bloody and begging in a bathroom stall. Probably should rein it in a little. Keep a low profile.
John’s standing with his back to the room, apron on, his arms elbow deep in a huge stainless steel mixing bowl that Sherlock has never even seen before. Sherlock slips quietly up behind him and tucks his chin over John’s shoulder. John’s front is covered in flour,  hands kneading a puffy ball of dough that smells curiously comforting. Sherlock’s always been attuned to smells more than most people, his nose being an important contributor to The Work. It's just about The Work.
, until he has to blink back hot tears. John’s touching him everywhere, running his hands over his thighs and his chest, pressing thumbs into the hollows of his hips.
tough.” Sherlock allows himself a grin, caught halfway between between wanting to vault over the stands and run away, and grab John’s face and kiss him hard on the mouth. His whole body is quivering, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up.
“Then get in your fucking car and drive away, and don’t come back here. Ever. Or I will fucking hunt you down.” John doesn’t lower his fists, doesn’t back away. “You deaf? Drive. Away."
“Fuck you again.” His voice sounded weak even to his own ears. It had been an extremely long time since he’d lost a fight. He was used to being the one doing the beating. Karma, John. You deserve this, this is retribution for what you’ve been doing.
There’s nothing more hypnotisingly beautiful than a blissed out, well fucked Sherlock, his hair in a riot of tangles, his arse rubbed pink from friction, his thighs glistening with come. John takes a moment to admire the sight of him - draped wantonly across the bed and still twitching with the last shivers of orgasm - before padding into the loo to grab a small flannel from the cupboard and run it under the tap.
Sherlock nods and mumbles, "Yes, yes," quiet and slurred, his breathing shallow and rabbit fast. He fumbles at his trousers, half undoes the button and nearly smacks John in the face with his belt buckle.
John’s mouth twisted into a sullen smile. “Are you going to tell me I’m your hero, because I really…”
“Sherlock Holmes.” Usually he gives out a fake name, to adults, to strangers, but she deserves the real one.
John's expression softens, and he leans forward and grasps Sherlock by the forearms. "Come up here."
John shuts the door and locks it with a soft click. When he looks at Sherlock again, his eyes are both sympathetic and unyielding. “Sherlock. You are spinning out of control. You just bashed your head into the wall at least three times that I heard, and you’re frustrated and exhausted. You need to go home and have a break.”
Lester looked like John had just petted him. A wave of nausea rolled up in John’s throat, head swimming. God, what was he? What had he become, helping people like this? Telling them how to hide evidence and get away with murder. Sherlock would be so disappointed in him.
“What’s come over you? You’re never so sentimental.” John smiled up at me, his eyes twinkling. His sticky hands roamed up the expanse of my back and settled at my shoulders.
“Yes, I know, you’ve been waiting.” John allowed me to guide him, our fingers intertwined around me, pulling me off with the long, slow movements that I preferred. “You can come now.”
,” I was already near a shameless whimper, my cock now fully hard and nudging out crudely through the part in my dressing gown. I straddled him, pressing my knees back as far as they would go, squeezed between John’s hips and the arms of the chair.
Her face crumples in disgust. “No. I’m not going to call our parents. Jesus, why would you think I’d do that?”
Somehow they stumble to the bedroom, kicking off their trousers in the doorway and collapsing on the bed with shirts half unbuttoned and their hands already in each other’s hair, kissing before they remember that they weren’t for a moment. John already can’t remember what came before this. Was there life before Sherlock was in his arms, breathless and half hard, thrashing and sighing and wrapping his bare legs around John’s back?
Sherlock's clothes had never left his tidily arranged drawers, his suits and pressed shirts all hanging in his wardrobe. His deodorant and hairbrush on the dresser, the book he'd been reading open on the pillow. John had sat on the side of Sherlock's bed so many sleepless nights, staring at that stupid bloody periodic table on the wall, brushing his fingers down the spine of
John smiles indulgently, concern still swimming in his eyes. “That’s my good boy. Food, and rest, and bed. No arguments.”
"John." Warm fingers touched the side of his face, traced his ear and his temple. Sherlock took a deep breath. "I think you should call Ella and make an appointment."
“Oh, Jesus, John,” Sherlock’s eye fly open to look down at John’s bobbing blonde head, at his own fingers twisted in John’s hair, at John’s cerulean bright eyes staring up at him as he licks gentle and slow at the tip of Sherlock’s rapidly hardening prick.
Sherlock enjoyed, craved even, being corrected, but John didn’t relish that particular area of their arrangement, so he looked to eliminate reasons for Sherlock to be corrected when he could. He wanted Sherlock to obey him without corporeal punishment. He wanted Sherlock to feel loved and treasured, John’s good boy, his perfect clever beautiful baby -- not afraid of him or constantly waiting for punishment. That just wasn’t how John operated. Installing the coat hook was a way John still was in control - Sherlock absolutely was not permitted to leave his coat laying all over the flat - but John avoided having to correct him about it. It had worked out well thus far.
Sherlock began recording how many times a day John laughed, the approximate decibel and duration, and what had made him laugh. He regretted he had no control study, that he'd not recorded John's laughter frequency before the The Beard, but it couldn't be helped. Instead he discovered through an extensive Google search and sifting through scads of uni research papers, that most middle aged men laughed 4 to 8 times per day. John laughed 12 - 15 times a day now.
“Just you. I’ll get his from him.” Her smile was kind, patient, as though John were about eight years old and had bubble gum stuck in his hair.
Sherlock’s snoring delicately, on his back with one pale forearm thrown over the riot of peppery curls spread on the pillow. John lays on his side to watch him, the shallow rise and fall of his bare chest, a smattering of greying hair spread across his sternum and trailing between prominent ribs. He crawls his fingers across the sheets, brushes the tips gently over the knot of shiny scar tissue just under Sherlock’s right nipple. Twenty five years, and still it aches. Still it’s difficult to forgive himself for what had happened in the months after Sherlock had come back to him. John had failed him, in so many ways, and promised them both that he never would again. The thought that he had almost lost Sherlock
