"That is not fair, Gabriel. This book has the potential to open the genre and make it more accessible to modern readers." Castiel used some of the phrasing Rowena had suggested for getting Gabriel to look at the Winchester manuscript. Across the table, he saw her smile in satisfaction.
Dean kept his eyes on the road and turned up the radio.
He rose and cleaned up the table, then stepped aside without a word when Sam moved to wash the dishes. After working on his laptop for a few hours, he headed to bed, before his brother for once. It would be a very early morning drive in the dark to Cheyenne Bottoms.
to go jogging in Topeka, but somehow running a single-lane road through empty farmland and getting catcalled by teenagers in pickup trucks just isn't the same."
"Umm… who by?"
"...Or you could just message me feedback too. Then it would all be in one place," Dean countered, feeling contrary.
Dean dropped his hands down to look across the room. "Uh, yeah. Lots of commenters on there and on Facebook. Really pretty spot."
"Good day?"
Charlie had scored a point, Castiel thought. Gabriel scowled at them all for another moment. It was the same scowl Castiel had seen whenever his cousin couldn't get out of some family responsibility.
"Yeah, the guy that picked it up is looking to put it into a slightly different genre. I'm working with his editor to rewrite parts of it."
"That's great."
"Good. Make certain you text me, so that I'll know you sent an email. Also, in response to your previous message, no, I don't think Eric should 'shack up' with Atticus. The story is better served by keeping that tension unresolved. Besides which, Eric obviously tends to desire things and people that he considers unattainable. Good night, Dean."
Rowena MacLeod was striking in any setting, but the woman looked positively out of place in Charlie's tiny kitchen. Today's suit was an expensive-looking dark green coat and slacks, set off with gold jewelry and matching green cat eye makeup. Her dark red hair fell in thick waves and ringlets down her back. She turned to Castiel as he entered and gave him a slow, feline smile.
Castiel didn't like to speak ill of other employees, but Zach Adler didn't exactly endear himself to anyone. The man was inconsiderate and only interested in what would sell big. Technically, his job, of course, but most editors at least had special interests or pet projects. Adler always struck Castiel as a bit mercenary.
Castiel's breathing hitches as tears fill his eyes. Dean had slid down onto the floor to get on one knee while Cas was fully invested in the letter. Castiel sobs as he sets the letter down to look at Dean, a wide smile spreads across his face as tears spill over his cheeks as he sees the silver and diamond band in the small box Dean is presenting, "Well, Cas?" Castiel blushes and laughs as he holds out his hand and nods his head frantically. Dean slips on the ring and Castiel slides onto the floor to kiss Dean softly.
But he set that thought aside as he remembered Lisa. He sighs to himself before letting his heart decide on a big decision. Lisa, who he has known since as long as he can remember, or Castiel, the boy he has never met, whos letters to him he was reading and slowly falling for him.
He wished Castiel had asked him out on a date. His date with Lisa after work ended in a fight. They had fought off and on for months afterward, and broken up at least twice, but, only for a short while. He wasn't happy with his relationship back then, and he really wasn't now. Sure he loved Lisa, but reading these letters, he knew he had somebody out there who loves him more than she does. Somebody who could give as much as he took.
As Dean reflects back on what Castiel had talked about in the last letter he began feeling the way he did when it all went down. He had watched the boy jump out of the window on the third floor of the school and he immediately raced over to him after he hit the bushes. He had recognized him as the boy he found in the bathroom, what was his name? Cassiel? he had thought to himself.
Dean smiled and set the letter aside. He had been to Disney once. It was magical and fun, but it was down in Florida.
As I is writinG tis,
"Dean..." He smiles, "I did it. I finally- gah!" Castiel tries to sit up, but pain prevents him from doing so.
He feared that it might have been another bump in Castiel's life that he couldn't fix because it was in the past, but nevertheless, his eyes started to fly across the page.
Dean makes his way upstairs and back into the confinements of his room. His heart beats a little faster as he sits next to the letters on his bed. He smiles and picks up the next one.
Dean pulled a face as he sees Castiel's next letter was written in green crayon on drawing paper.
As Dean ignores Lisa's calls and texts demanding a reason and pleading not to leave her, he moves on to the next letter.
Pushing the thought aside and finding another fantasy of the boy's, he flips through until he finds one that doesn't seem like a jotted down dream.
But, why was he blushing? And what is his heart racing for? And what's with the butterflies?
Dean himself felt all warm and happy and bubbly as he thought about doing all those things with Castiel, cuddling, kissing, making love. He wanted to be able to pull him close right now and just curl up with him and sleep.
Dean sighs in relief as he sees the next letter looks somewhat normal.
"I love you," Castiel says as they rush to the bedroom to celebrate their engagement.
"Dean! Dinner is ready!" Mary, Dean's mother, calls up the stairwell.
Dean looked at the clock: 6:28. He sighed, he knew he should go and eat, but he couldn't. Not when all he could do was want to read on, find out more about Castiel.
"I'm not... And you're..." Castiel mumbles, piecing things together. His eyes water before fat tears spill over and Dean shushes him as he blabbers, "I'm sorry, Dean! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean it! I-"
"Cas?" Dean whispers. Castiel's eyes flutter open, bloodshot from crying, and being choked.
Holy. Shit. Dean couldn't believe he had forgotten that precious memory! He had taken Castiel's phone from his hands and snapped a few quick selfie as soon as he got his attention with a quick 'Jimmy! Smile!'. The look on his face was too cute too handle and the noise he made before telling him to delete it was practically illegal! Castiel was the cutest, most precious thing in the world and Dean tried desperately to get his attention, desperately trying to get him to talk to him! He knew the feeling of just wanting to be noticed by the person he was interested in. He even added his phone number into the kid's phone in hopes he'd talk to him that way. But it never worked and his small crush was crushed as he started to believe he wasn't interested and never would be.
Dean had to bite his lip and remember that he had seen Castiel this morning. That something good had happened during the years, that he was still alive and well.
With every heavy beat of his racing heart, Dean weaves in and out of the fast lane and normal lane on the highway. His speed is dangerous and his driving is reckless, and he's sure he's going to cause an accident if he doesn't slow down. Horns honk as he slides into the tight spaces between them without warning, only to dart back out and pass the one in front. He's shaking, he's sweating, he's crying. He's fearing for the worst, and he should. He has no clue where he's going, or if Gabriel will even let him into the apartment. A trucker rages and blares his horn as Dean cuts him off, causing him to swerve. Dean steps on the gas, even more, looking at the time. It's damn near midnight and there's too much traffic.
on it in jumbled handwriting.
Dean Winchester was smarter than he would ever let on, and his schooling always came first.
"Alright... Don't stay up too late, hon!" Mary laughs, graceful and angelic.
McCloud
"Homework," Dean mumbles and turns to head up over the stairs, being stopped again.
"Alright, alright... Later then, my love?" Dean proposes as he noses at Castiel's ear.
"Dean? You're still here?" Castiel asks as he wakes up around noon. Dean smiles shyly and nods.
"Jimmy." He mumbles. Mary lets out a shocked chuckled what, taken aback by a name she hasn't heard in nearly three years.
Dean knew in this moment that there was a potential two-sided relationship out there somewhere in Lawrence Kansas, waiting for him with open arms and a sad story to tell that will end up with a happy ending if its the last thing Dean does. The only thing standing in the way of it is Lisa now.
Dean smiled and blushed, now fully aware of the small things about him that Castiel liked. He wasn't even mad at how he had just been told that Lisa was cheating on him, and may still be for all he knew.
With a frown from the partial goodbye letter, Dean looks at the clock. It was nearly time for one of his favorite shows to come on. He knew he was going to miss it, he couldn't just turn away from Castiel's practical high school life story! He was fully invested now, with his letters bringing up memories of the past. Things he'd sworn that he'd never forget and ended up forgetting them anyway! With a sigh over missing his show, he begins the next letter.
"I love you so much, Dean!" Castiel cries, "I was so stupid! I should have told you! I should have corrected you on my name! I should have texted you! I should have called you! I should have taken you out on that date! I should have kissed you again! I should ha-" Dean cut Castiel off with a simple kiss. Their lips move together perfectly like they were born to kiss one another. They kiss until their lungs scream for air and they kiss some more, only parting when things got dizzy.
Dean laughs now as he is positive Castiel is referring to the last piece of writing he had read, about the romantic and intimate dream Castiel had told him about. Dean would be lying if he were to say that he wouldn't gladly, without any hesitation, make that dream come true. He would also be lying if he said that he didn't like the idea of being teased to the point of begging for release, but that is for a later time and a different day.
Dean sniffles and wipes at his nose. He knew how it felt to be different, to be teased and taunted because he liked both boys and girls. He wished that he could have had somebody to make them stop, but instead he fought until they stopped. Dean sets the letter down and rubs at the faded scars on his own wrist. He looks down at the letter again and skims over it. "Awh, Cass..."
Dean's heart broke and melted all at the same time. He would love to cuddle Castiel and watch a movie, he would overheat and give the blanket to Cass, he would probably even hold him tighter to still try and give him warmth. And it was clear to Dean now that he never really did any of that with Lisa. He never watched movies and cuddled her under a fuzzy blanket with her. So, why would he consider doing that with Castiel?
Already noticing the drastic change in the way Castiel's penmanship is, Dean isn't fully prepared for what he is about to read. The many tear stains smudging the ink. The short paragraphs and all too long ones. He frowns and reads the next paper.
"I love you, too."
Dean blushed. He hadn't known that he had given him a hickey! He laughed a little bit, a soft snicker of pride. He promised himself that if he saw Castiel in the hallway, he would kiss him just as softly as he did the first time, only no heat, just soft, gentle, caring, and loving.
Dean sighed in relief, at least he knows Castiel is out of his father's grip. But he still can't shake the feeling he's getting. Why would Cas give him these letters now? Sure, it could be a last-minute bravery thing, but Castiel looked so... Broken... Defeated...
Dean thought to himself. He set the picture aside and started reading the letter...
Feeling himself grow thick and heavy reading the detailed letter of Castiel's dream, Dean knows there's no fighting this one. There's no waiting this one out, especially when he imagines Castiel riding him as he said he had in the dream.
"Just keep reading, Baby!" Dean kisses Castiel's temple.
Dean soon groaned as he slowly realized that the yearning for wanting to know Castiel's story and wanting to make the newly discovered older boy know he was important and life was worth living, was him slowly getting feelings for him. Dean huffed a laugh, quickly moving on to the next one, still smiling like an idiot.
, should go through such a horrible thing like this!
Knowing his letters could only get worse, Dean skips the last three and breaks down. Big fat tears fall down his face and soak into the fresh pages Castiel wrote this morning. He knew this letter was sure to come, and he didn't want to read it. He pinches his arm just to be sure he didn't fall asleep reading the letters, but, the pain on his skin reveals the truth.
After doing the small amount of dishes in the sink, Dean walks to the stairs, being stopped by his mother, "Honey, you've been up there since you got home!" Mary smiles sweetly and fixes his hair, "What on earth are you doing up there?"
"He's in his room studying, wh-"
"I love you too, Dean!" Castiel sobs and kisses him again.
Dean worries his bottom lip between his teeth as the words come up again.
Still blushing and smiling like a mad man, Dean moves onto the next letter.
"Dean, do you have any idea-"
But why was he there? Why give these letters to him after repeating how he will never give them to him? Why didn't he stop when he called out to him? Dean sighs and shakes his head to clear his thoughts. He decided to skim the next few letters to see how his life progressed after this letter. There were more than a few suicide notes, more letters with blood on them. His eyes filled with tears as he read over the letters with bloodstains. He sighed and wiped away the tears that blurred his vision.
"I won't... I love you."
this chapter for whatever reason keeps using multiple spaces in between words no matter what I do. I can't seem to fix it no matter how annoying it is, I am sorry.
Dean bites his lip as he imagines what Castiel would sound like, look like, as he moaned, thrusting down onto him. He whimpers and licks his lips, his hand moving at a fast set pace. Dean pauses briefly to reach for the lotion sitting on his side table, pumping out just enough to provide a smooth slick. He breathes heavily as he presses his thumb into his slit, reading the words on the page.
Dean smiles and mentally slaps himself for not remembering "James". How could he have forgotten all the times he laughed at the small noises he made? How could he have forgotten his small crush on the cutest boy he'd ever met? How did he not recognize him at all? After all, he had saved the boy's life!
As Dean thought back on how Castiel said Gabriel got a job in South Dakota at an Auto shop, things click into place a bit. He had remembered working from time to time on cars and trucks and sometimes bikes with a blond man named Gabriel.
Dean walked up to his locker and pulled out the rather thick envelope,
Castiel's father was one royal douche canoe. Dean felt this hot anger rush through him as he thought about Castiel being beaten and being screamed at for being gay and being blamed for things he had no control over. Dean mentally told Cas that if he ever ran into the guy, he would personally beat his ass for him.
Dean rubbed his eyes. He was getting tired now, tuckered out from reading for a few hours, and, worn out from messing around with Lisa after school in the Impala as they drove around town. He yawns and stretches, trying to ignore the question hammering away at him, the same question that's been at the back of his mind since the first variation of "these letters will never reach you".
"Uhh, History, got a big project that's due tomorrow..." Dean lies smoothly. His mother nods, it was always like Dean to wait until the very last second to do something.
Dean shook his head. He wanted to smoosh Castiel's face between his hands and kiss him, telling him how much he is worth something!
"CAS!" Dean shouts, going into hysterics again, "Gabriel! Where's his room?" Dean asks as he opens a door. Dean's heart breaks before it stops, or stops before it breaks, he doesn't know for certain which happens first. All he knows is that Gabriel is now rushing past him and screaming his brother's name.
Dean blushed at how foolish he was to have let Jimmy go. To lie to his uncle Bobby that he had to much school work now and couldn't come in when, in actuality, he was just hurt that Jimmy- Cas- never showed the same interest in him as he had for him. He hit the palm of his hand to his forehead, muttering about how stupid he was before moving on to the next letter.
"Merry Christmas, Baby! I love you too!" Dean laughs as Castiel kisses him into the soft rug of their living room floor. Dean pushes Castiel back gently and smiles, "We can't do this on the floor, my back won't be happy in the morning." Dean says as he sits them up. With a soft grunt, Castiel gets off of Dean and helps him up off the floor. He hugs Dean and kisses him, humming as he feels the soft flesh of Dean's lips on his neck.
Dean smiled softly at the letter. He was falling harder and harder for Cas with each and every letter he read. He wanted nothing more but to kiss him now, in front of all his homophobic "friends". He wanted to cuddle him close so he could breathe in Castiel's scent and kiss him endlessly. He wanted to be intimate, he wanted to be as domestic as he possibly could.
Dean's frown increased. Castiel hadn't driven him away, he was just up to his head in homework. He hadn't abandoned for late shifts at Bobby's! He wanted so badly to go back in time and stop any of this from happening, just go back and forget about Lisa. He wishes he could just go back in time and make sure Castiel is loved and safe! He would march right up to him and say how he feels about him, he would tell him that everything is going to be okay and he won't let anybody hurt him! Things would be different. Castiel would be happy and he would protect him and love him with his entire being!
Dean couldn't bear any more writing from Castiel, but he couldn't help but read more. He felt compelled to read all the letters, no matter how many there were, or how depressing they got. He needed to know Castiel's story, he needed to know why the boy was crying today, why he smiled so sweetly yet sadly at Dean. And as he recalled, the kid wasn't in any of his classes today, not that he paid attention to who was there anyway.
Dean looked at the tear smudged ink on the next letter. It was longer than the other one he had just read, and he noticed that the handwriting was sloppier too.
Dean wiped away his tears and shook his head.
It was just an ordinary Monday, the sun was shining bright, the trees swayed as the summerish breeze blew through them softly.
Dean giggled, he could practically see Castiel's blushing and jealous face. Wait. Jealous? Was Castiel
"They're here!" Dean grins and heads to the door while Castiel presses a tree-shaped cutter into the brown dough.
He would kiss him, he would hug and cuddle him. He would do everything in his power to make up for the years he didn't know Castiel!
He sets the letter down and takes a shuddery breath. He had recalled poking fun at a student he had only heard of but never knew. And it turned out to be Castiel, the one writing these letters. He whimpered and cried, he felt awful, why did he do it? He was half gay himself, and yet he found himself picking on Castiel. He sighed and laid back on his bed. "I'm such an idiot. I wish I could take back the things I've said!"
"He's alive." Dean sniffs and looks up at Gabriel. Relief washes over Gabriel's face and he crouches next to Dean.
Dean felt his heartbreak a little. This Castiel kid seemed like he had been through a lot, calling a razor an old friend? He was happy that he had done whatever and stopped those kids, for all he knew, if he didn't, there wouldn't have been all these other pages of letters, and he would have never have gotten them.
Attached to the first letter was a picture of the boy he had seen earlier:
The letter has a break in it and it continues onto something new written in different ink.
Castiel hangs from his sturdy ceiling fan. Something that looks weaker than it really is. His face is turning blue and limbs are twitching slightly. There's a note on his bed. "Cas!" Dean's voice is weak, broken, and desperate. He runs over to the other boy, helping Gabriel get him down. Tears stream down both Gabriel's and Dean's face, hands desperately trying to get the rope from around his neck and fan.
For once, in years really, Castiel James Novak is happy and full of life, and it is all thanks to the person he wrote to for years.
He looked at the clock again and it was a minute after his show had started. He looked at his T.V. and back to the letters in his hand. He couldn't just abandon the letters, he needed to find out more! He sets the recently read letter down and looks over the next.
Dean chuckles at Castiel joking about his sexuality as he gets a warm feeling as he imagines the fierce blush on Castiel's face as he writes his feelings down for him. So pure, so innocent and cute.
Wait.
"I love you too, Darlin'. More than words can say." Dean smiles and kisses Castiel's forehead.
"Yes, my love?" Castiel lifts his head to look at the man who had saved his life over a dozen times throughout his teen years. Dean hands him a neatly folded piece of paper. Confused, Castiel unfolds it and looks at Dean in questioning, "What's this?" He asks, tilting his head.
Though any rational person would feel a bit uneasy, Dean felt... Well, he didn't know how he felt, but it wasn't uneasy. He smiled at the short goodbye letter Castiel had written before he moves on to the next one.
Dean stared at the letter in his hands and looked at the clock. It was only seven now. His mother would check in on him in an hour and question his work on the fake project he had made up.
Dean traces his hand down his body and pops the button on his jeans. He slides the zipper down, groaning at the slight vibration it gives as the teeth come apart. He scoots his pants down to give himself room as he removes himself from the tight fabric of his black briefs, quickly getting to work.
"Later." Castiel smiles and turns his head to kiss Dean on the lips, "I love you so much..." He whispers as he rests his forehead against Dean's temple.
Dean couldn't continue the last page and a half. His heart ached for Cas. This was something that he had truly never felt before, something was way different about these letters now. They meant something to him. When Dean first started reading these letters, it was like reading fan mail in a way, but now they meant everything to him. They made him laugh, made him cry... Hell, one of them made him harder than a diamond!
Dean stood there for a brief moment and wondered who the boy was and why he was crying. Also why he was putting stuff into his locker, maybe it was just one of Crowley's cruel doings again, blackmailing some poor kid to put more of those "secret" letters into his locker (it was only letters to say to meet him wherever so they could discuss last weeks episode of Unnatural).
Dean couldn't finish the note. He grabs his jacket from his desk chair, fixes his clothing, throws on his boots, and makes his way down the stairs, "Dean? Dean, honey, where are you going? I thought you were asleep?" His mother surprises him as he makes his way to the kitchen to grab his keys off the table. She sees the tears before they fall heavily on his jacket, "Dean, baby, what's wrong?"
The smile faded from his face as he found some of the words were smudged by tear droplets that have dried over time, leaving the outer edges of the dried droplet black where it touched the ink.
Dean sighed as he walked into the school, it was near graduation and he couldn't wait to get out of this hell hole called High School. As he walked to his locker, he noticed somebody was leaving it, an envelope sticking out. "Hey!" Dean shouted, the boy turned around, tears brimming his sapphire eyes. He smiled sadly before turning away and running into the sea of students, all rushing to get to their lockers.
"He's gone. Dad left Jericho."
"Good. Also, we are so close to getting to those damn vampires. Their leader often deals with demons, so maybe we have a chance to get a lead on the yellow eyed..."

"And go." Natasha said and Thor instantly brought down his fist. Dean was thankfully fast enough and managed to dodge it. He moved behind Thor and kicked him in the legs.
"He doesn't go anywhere without that thing."
"Do it." She whispered again, but Sam still couldn't bring himself to do it.
"Ah! You damn-" Right then Natasha, Tony and Wanda came into the room, followed by Steve, who was supporting Bucky.
"Yeah, who said I was going to steal it?"
"Dean! Dean, calm down. It's just a dream." John held onto his shoulders and tried to wake him up.
"Something is wrong, Dean. Heaven is at chaos..."
"But why is she here? And what does she want?"
"Well he is chasing the same story and we're chasing him." Dean answered.
"Dean is probably pissed at me for that."
After the whole End-of-the-world-thing, after everyone was back, Sam looked for Eileen and they both wanted to start a family in a friendly neighborhood. Now they had twins and Dean was eager to name them. At first Sam was sceptical but after hearing the names, he and Eileen instantly agreed.
Dean looked at the twins and Jack and tried to sound as soft and as innocent as he could, but he knew that it would be difficult with his rough, deep voice.
Sam and Cas looked at him with worry and curiosity.
"To how many foster homes have you been?" Clint asked.
"So there is a devil too? Angels? Demons?"
"Some more, some less." Dean shrugged.
"Honestly, it was just coincidence. I was at the very end of all things when I realized that something was wrong. I felt how one world after another got destroyed. This universe was the closest and I just tried to concentrate my energy on it to prevent it from getting whiped out like the others. Then I looked around and realized that only this world and another one were still intact. The other one obviously being the one where Dean and God were. I went over there to have a look and saw what a monster God had become... I wish I was stronger, but like I said, I am just a fraction of him and could never defeat him."
"Yeah yeah, and what about you and Tony, huh? When will you ask for his hand?" Dean smirked.
Everyone looked at him and Tony sat down, completely tired.
"Steve. We may have found something. Come to our location." Tony said and after that they separated.
At first Sam was scared, but he was the happiest when it was just him and Dean. Of course it wasn't easy and he knew that it was difficult for Dean. He had to steal for them and at the same time he hunted monsters, in hope to find their dad. But yeah, now it was just him. Dean had left and maybe that was the right thing to do, but Sam didn't want the life of a hunter. He was happy with the Avengers and they were more like parents to him than John ever was...
"D-Dea-" John couldn't believe it. He stumbled forward, reached out with his hands and pulled his son into his arms.
"Shut up. I'm bad at this. And you could have been nicer. She just lost her husband."
"Ha! We did it." Tony said happily and removed the helmet. He grinned at Bucky, but his partner looked worriedly at the two kids. Tony turned around and saw why…
"We don't think, we know." Ellen answered him.
"This is unbelievable." Castiel muttured.
______________________________
Sam nodded. "I'm just glad that Dean got over it. Dad and I never got along, but he saved Dean. I thought I would loose my brother and- that... I don't know what I would've done."
"You-He-What-?!" Tony looked concerned at Dean.
"Then where are you going?" Steve asked.
"Charlie and Kevin. They would be the first two people who would recognize him." Castiel said.
"Don't get emotional. It was the least we could do. I just wish we did a better job."
Dean shrugged. "Well I was electrocuted and only had a few days left because of the heart attack..."
They looked around, but didn‘t see him.
"Turn on the news." Castiel told Mary and she did.
Steve got a call from Dean and shortly after he arrived with Scott.
"Alright." Dean sighed. "We will stay one night."
"… alright. I’ll see what I can find." Sam said and grabbed the book.
"I should go." She said and looked at Sam. "I'll see you later, Sam." Sam smiled and tunred to Tony and Bucky.
"We have a plan.“
"Yeah, I'm just glad that I was barely conscious during the flight. I thankfully don't remember being on that death trap." Dean mumbled and looked sick just by thinking about it.
Later Dean went out to grab some food, but he ran into trouble with the police officers.
"Well, you all disappointed me. There is no hope for you, so I thought of a new... structure." God started to explain. "You see, I will create a new universe. Only one. Last time, I made too many. Like I said a new start. The people in that universe will have a similar community, but there will be no monsters. No. When they do something that I don't like, they will be send here. As punishment."
______________________________
"...right. Look, I just wanted to check in. Felt bad for not calling. How are things with you? We couldn't really watch the news recently."
Sunday was a relaxed day. Sam spend a lot of time in the library and even though Dean barely left him out of his sight, he was still a lot more relaxed now when Sam was spending time with Bruce or Steve. His brother clearly liked the Avengers and Dean didn't want to ruin their friendship just because he was paranoid. He himself got closer to Bucky as they spend some time in the gym and Dean realized, that he could learn a lot from him. The Avengers on the other hand wanted to learn more about the supernatural, so they all sat down in the evening and Dean and Sam explained the basics of hunting, like what to do against a ghost or werewolves. Bruce wrote down some stuff and Tony made some online notes.
He wished he could have read every letter Castiel had written, but this was fine. After all, he had to go through a huge stack as is, and he could only imagine what it would have been if he had kept all of them.
Bucky knelt down on one knee so he was at Sam's eye level. "Hey,  it's okay. I am sure your brother just needs some time and being out here in public was probably just too much for him."
"Take care."
Meanwhile Sam, Bucky and Ruby went upstairs, to look for the girl, aka Lilith.
That's it for now. Maybe I'll add something later... who know.
"You are a part of God?" Sam asked.
Tony took a deep breath and turned to Scott. "Show me what you have."
"Fine- I'm fine, man. I told you. Just tired."
A man stood there and smiled slightly at him.
"You couldn't have done better." Sam said. "It was already perfect."
(See the end of the chapter for
"That idiot." Mary breathed out.
"You sure about this?" Bucky asked Sam.
"Okay, hold on a sec. You all think that only I died?" Dean asked.
"Crazy."
"I told you to take care of her." John grumbled at Castiel, as he stepped out of the car.
"Most ghosts instantly attack, because they are set on revenge. If they don't do anything, then it means that they still have a lot of their old humanity in them. Then the fact that she stood by her body, made it clear that she just wanted a way out." Sam explained.
Dean ran as fast as he could into the forest. Surely the man wouldn’t follow him for long. It was only peanut butter and some sandwiches.
"We should go... I have to work tomorrow and the girls will have to go to school, but if you need anything, ju-"
"You want to come?"
"Before I got to Bobby's. I found an old gas station. I drank some water and then suddenly I heard the sound and the glass in the windows shattered." Dean had stopped eating and just glared at his food.
"Exactly. He never really accepted the fact that Dean died. Now, he has the chance to realize, that his father is gone, but that there are still others who can be like family. He will see you and know that you lost your family as well. He will look at you and see that you continue to live, that you can still enjoy life."
"S-Sammy..." Dean's eyes started to form tears as he looked down at his brother's dead form.
"Wait. I thinks she's alright."
"Hello... me." Rob said. He again looked like the old man and glared at Chuck.
Tony and Bucky shook off the creatures and hurried inside. Dean followed quickly and closed the door behind him. He then grabbed a pack of salt and scattered it in front of the door.

"I thought I lost you forever." He looked down at his son. "What about Sam... Is he-?"
"Cas, honey... please sit down." Mary said and gestured to an empty place on the couch, next to Bobby and Ellen.
"Oh come on. I‘ve been through worse. Just tell Sam and Cas that I love them when you guys bring them back. Sam deserves a normal life. Jess as his wife, kids, a house... I always dragged him down with me. I ruined his future... But not anymore. And Cas... tell Cas I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, would you? He- he has to let me go after all this is over...“ Dean said. "And tell Bucky to cut his hair from time to time, otherwise he would look like Sammy. And please, PLEASE don‘t feel bad about this. You and Bucky... I owe you everything and I am honored to die for all of you guys.“ He laid his arm on Tony‘s shoulder and squeezed it slightly. Tony looked up at him. He was crying and trying to say something.
"JESUS! Cas... don‘t do that.“
"Yeah... Will you stay the night?"
"We all are."
"See you in a minute.“ Natasha said and they activated the time machine.
Sam nodded and they parted ways.
Jack nodded slightly and turned around. He looked at Dean for a second, before looking down at his feet.
"Hey, okay," Gabriel said when Castiel didn't continue right away, "don't grind your gears. I'll see what I can do. Ol' Zach isn't going to like me nosing around something he gave the hard pass on… but that just might be a perfect reason to do it."
this week!"
What did surprise him, however, was how often Gabriel seemed to be thwarted at the meetings held to assess the status and priority of Elysium's upcoming releases. At first, Castiel had thought perhaps all the other acquiring editors were just that much better than his cousin, but after meeting most of them and seeing Gabriel work, the only explanation Castiel could think of was that the Editor-in-Chief, Gabriel's older brother Michael, didn't want to seem to be playing favorites.
"Cass—tiel," Gabriel groaned, stumbling and narrowly avoiding using his nickname. "Come on… The last thing I want my name on is some old white guy book glorifying man over nature. Why don't I just shoot myself in the foot and save myself the pain."
Checking his watch, Sam pulled a face. "I have work tomorrow, so no."
"Great. Seems like you're going to be busy the next few weeks."
"A little. Don't need much. Although I'm assuming you do, so maybe I shouldn't text you at eleven at night?"
Dean had finally come out to Sam and Mom as bisexual after his first book was published. Sam had been somewhat surprised but really supportive. Their mother mostly avoided mentioning it since. Dean felt the tension as she paused to find the right words.
Rowena, who had straightened and started to open her mouth, snapped it shut before taking an audible breath in and regaining her composure. "Fine."
to be gay. This could be one of those books! We should be in all genres!"
Gabriel kept going, working himself into another rant. "When Bobby Singer retired, they sent most of those writers over to Adler, but the guy is just dropping half of them on the floor. I get it, they aren't all big names, but sometimes, you gotta make up in volume what you can't get in bestsellers. I heard today he not only bumped Heidi Wesford's book five to next year, even though it's been ready for six months at least, but he also completely tossed Dean Winchester's latest, that guy Bobby nursed through his first publication a few years back. Christ, I almost thought Singer was going to adopt the man..."
"It won't. Promise."
"Hello, Dean."
Gabriel met his eyes, probing.
Dean sent the message, not sure if Castiel would respond. He probably shouldn't abuse the guy's cell number, but the idea of trying to wait for an email reply when he was in the thick of it wasn't appealing. It took several more minutes before his phone buzzed.
Gabriel came through with the Winchester draft; Castiel hadn't doubted he would, really.
Also, taking suggestions for more book-related Charlie t-shirts, so toss me descriptions/links in the comments if you have a favorite. <3
Castiel's rumbling voice sent an odd thrill through Dean's chest. Weirded out, he took a moment to firmly stomp that down, during which the editor continued.
The deep, smoky voice had Dean imagining some grizzled newsroom editor, or maybe a detective noir character. The Elysium website hadn't had any pictures—Dean had checked—but he was sure the guy had to have, like, massive eyebrows and jowls. The voice was completely at odds with his requests for more character depth, his praise for Dean's scenery descriptions, his favorite scene from
Charlie made Castiel his own cup of tea, and the three of them sat down together.
"Yeah, but ours had some fresh characters at least," Gabriel protested. "The main in this one is, guess what, a dark and broody young woman with a mysterious past who just wants to leave it behind her. At least until a similarly mysterious and hot male vampire enters her life…" He fumed, his amber eyes blazing.
Her mouth slanted more deeply. "You know what I mean, Dean. You know that crowd. Your first book slipped in a few around the edges, but the more you branch into that, the more it's going to be publicized. Eventually, someone is going to open their mouths about it and it will go viral or whatever."
Later, after Sam and Dean had said their goodbyes and pulled away from their old homestead, Sam exhaled loudly. "Well, that went well."
"Well, yeah. They're giving you a chance to do more, Dean. Do what you can do."
"Yep, few more birding groups, a fall color photography tour in Konza… Just hope the bad weather stays away." Late October to November, right before winter, could be a rough period in the plains. "You're welcome to come along if anything strikes your fancy."
The grin Gabriel gave him had a vengeful edge to it, and Castiel remembered abruptly how scary his cousin could be when something got under his skin. One of these days, he half expected Gabriel to have some sort of massive showdown with Michael in the middle of a weekly meeting.
Castiel smiled thinly at her before turning back to Gabriel, who was glaring at him. His cousin knew who had instigated this little ambush.
"The Mahaffie Stagecoach Stop, the Museum of Deaf History, Art and Culture,
Dean ducked his head and gave her his toothiest smile in appreciation. "Thank you. You were a great group to work with. Being willing to get out of the cars and hike a little makes all the difference. I even learned a thing or two."
"Dean." His mother gave him a look that reminded him exactly where Sam got his expressions of disapproval from.
Had that been a joke?
Castiel felt vindicated for an instant. If Charlie remembered it too, perhaps he wasn't that far off base.
Castiel's excitement evaporated.
"I'm sure you do…" She looked amused. "But this is so far outside Mr. Shurley's markets that I'm not sure even
, Dean had always thought. He was still looking at the photo when his mother came up behind him.
"It wasn't anything explicit," Castiel admitted, "but I read it. It could have been better—I got the feeling some things got disjointed in editing—but there was something about it. Something
Gabriel glanced at the ceiling, as though asking for divine intervention, then sighed. "
"Well, realistically, you shouldn't text me outside the hours of nine to five, New York time, but I can only blame myself for replying to you outside the office. Doing these feedback cycles via text is going to make it difficult for me to review our editing history later on."
Dean shifted in his chair, sitting up straighter and resting his fork on his plate. He fixed his eyes firmly on his mother's. "So, you're worried that me writing a book with gay people in it means no one is gonna hire me? Too late for that, Mom."
Dean didn't remember to be annoyed at Sam until the following morning after a very late wakeup and his second cup of coffee. He buried his head in his writing until he had to get ready to go, barely grunting in reply to Sam's attempts at conversation and ignoring the hurt looks his younger brother shot his way. Sam may have gotten him to agree to a family dinner, but Dean didn't have to be happy about it.
"Do you think we could sell it?" Castiel asked, getting to the point.
"Good…" Sam shoved his hands into the pockets of his jacket, glancing at the floor in front of his polished black shoes. "Getting into my first assignments finally after orientation week. Not that different from Topeka. Just busier."
"Well, my dear, the problem is that the market for the genre is so small. It's, quite frankly, a bit of a niche interest these days. Bobby Singer was the only one who was really avid about it within the company, and now that he's gone…"
Gabriel was the youngest son of Chuck Shurley, founder and owner of Elysium House. For him and Castiel, Elysium wasn't just an employer, it was a family business—Castiel's mother was Chuck's sister. Castiel had worked at Elysium for ten years, joining almost straight out of graduate school; Gabriel had been there seventeen years and was currently one of their top acquiring editors. But their family ties to the owner didn't mean work was always smooth sailing; it more often garnered them resentment than status among the rest of the employees. Somewhat isolated and always under the watchful eyes of the office rumor mill, it had become their habit to gripe to one another. Well, Gabriel did most of the griping… but he seemed to appreciate Castiel's dry sense of humor and analytical takes on his problems, and Castiel enjoyed getting glimpses into the company's projects outside his own inbox.
"...What do you think, Charlie?" he asked. "I mean, it has queer representation."
"Well…" Rowena inclined her head. "He's already writing gay characters in a hostile market. That takes some amount of commitment to inclusion."
"G'night, Sammy."

His phone buzzed in his pocket, and he grabbed it to check the caller ID out of habit. He gave a start when

When the food was almost ready, Sam set out plates and forks, and the two of them ate together at the table. Dean couldn't remember the last time he'd sat there for a meal before his brother moved in. He listened to Sam talk about Kansas City, and they went back and forth about businesses of interest between there and Olathe. After dinner, Sam sat on the couch, fiddling on his phone. Dean returned to his pile and continued to sort. Long after Sam had stood, stretched, and headed off to bed, Dean was taking photos and typing notes on his laptop. It was after midnight by the time he thought it had something resembling organization.
"How's the latest book going, Dean?"
He had just sent off another round of suggestions on Hurrand's new psych novel and was preparing to look over the third edit of a detective thriller when his cousin Gabriel strode in and shut the door.
"Did you ever read
Dean blinked a few times, eyes gritty from staring at the bright screen for too long and glanced up, first to Sam, and then to the front windows, where night was clearly falling outside. "Uh… Crap. Is it that late already?" He tried to get up and made a face as his knees popped and protested. After a moment to balance himself, Dean carefully stepped out of the ring of material and moved to greet Sam. "Was just getting together some original draft stuff for my editor. How was work?"
Castiel looked over at Charlie again and she made a small shrug.
"Hey, cheaper than eating out all the time," Dean pointed out. "That reminds me, I go shopping Tuesdays or Wednesdays. Give me a list of things you want, and I can pick 'em up while I'm out. I know you like your healthy stuff. I'm more of a meat and carbs kinda guy."
on the same floor as the reception desk, the conference rooms, or the main lunch room. To him, this made his office especially favorable—or, in a word, quiet.
"But why us? There are hundreds of other orphans who need a home."
"Sir, do you know what happened?" Dean asked out of breath.
Dean just nodded, but Sam shook his head. "Dean, where would we go?"
"The first report was two days ago and yesterday they mentioned it on the news. I didn't think much of it, but now... What if it was those monsters?"
"Thanks, but I'm fine." Dean said without looking at Sam and walked away. Sam sighed but then followed him and they walked home in silence.
______________________________
______________________________
"What is it?" Dean asked concerned. They both feared that Jack would have problems to adjust. A lot happened and he and Sam's daughters still didn't understand all of it.
"Jody Mills?" Dean asked.
Suddenly Bruce came rushing towards them. He and Tony had gone off to look for some materials for a new device.
"Dead...?“
After Dean shot the last one, he turned towards the man. "Just get out of here." He said and ran away.
"Yerk."
"Yeah, them doing these experiments is just... urgh." Dean said and took another sip from his beer.
Tony got up and put a hand on Buckys shoulder. "He didn't mean it. He just needs time." Bucky nodded and slowly everyone got up and went to bed.
"We are running out of this stuff." He muttered to himself.
"Not all of them. Just the pack." Dean said. "There are probably more around in the woods."
At that point the front door opened and Castiel walked in. He wore a pair of jeans and a plaid shirt. He had a few stubbles on his chin and overall looked tired.
Dean raised his eyebrows and Sam laughed slightly.
"Yeah, I wouldn't believe a word of what he said, if it weren't for well..." John gestured at Dean.
„Oh you do?“
"Really?" Dean asked hopefully.
"- there were some murders around the country."
"Where do you think you're going?" He asked.
"There are still people in there!"
A few weeks later and Sam, Tony, Bucky, Steve, Natasha and Bruce were fighting against some weird zombie-like creatures. Some days earlier, they talked to Dean. Apparently he only needed Death's ring now, which surely would be the hardest to get. So it was a surprise, when Dean called and told them that he got the ring. Now they met at Bobby's place to make a plan.
He heard another scream and he reached the door at the far end. He kicked it open and saw Dean, tied to a chair. Two normal looking guys stood around him and were cutting him with knives. Dean was bleeding from his mouth, his head and his arms and legs. He panted heavily.
Sam looked at her. "You want us to put you to rest, right?"
"What is it?“ Sam asked worriedly.
"It's a long story..." Castiel muttered. Jack, the new God, turned to Dean again. "We should go. Your world is waiting." Dean nodded and looked back at the others. "Thank you guys. Thanks for everything."
"How do you do it...? How can you... move on?"
"Au! What was that for?"
"Were Bobby and Ellen also together?" Mary asked.
"Do you need help?" Steve asked, always prepared to fight.
"Dean?" Bucky asked.
"Nah... school is not for me."
"Dean?“ Sam asked, but saw nothing. Maybe his brother was just playing a prank again. He shrugged it off and went back to Castiel to keep reading in a book they found.
"All of them saved many lives and killed hundrets of them. But it got... more difficult for Sam and Dean." Rob explained, as he looked over to Dean, who was still looking deep in thought. "They got involved with angels and demons. They even died multiple times and went literally through hell."
"I don't know... what if they talk about this in school?" Eileen said. "I don't want them to get into trouble with other kids." She said and gestured worriedly.
"Hey champ. Did you sleep well?" Dean asked his son and Jack ran over to him.
"You just got here." Bruce said.
"Hi."
Natasha continued. "We talked to Coulson after the mission and mentioned you two. He said that SHIELD had their eyes on these things for a long time, but they always had problems to recruit hunters. And it wasn't easy to find out about killing these monsters, because there is a lot of bullshit on the internet and even a lot of books say the wrong things."
Dean instantly drove over and he hugged Tony tightly as he saw him. The other Avengers were there as well, still looking sad and unsure of what to do.
"Why would he have self worth issues? He had everything. A family, a job, money."

"Huh?“ Dean looked confused.
"No! I still can not trust you Sam. What you and Ruby did...  And Lucifer wants your body."
"No, you would draw too much attention. Bucky and I will be enough to handle it."
"This is actually not bad.“
Dean looked over to his right and saw Tony standing there.
"Come on." Dean said and went ahead.
-- 5 years later --
Dean didn't hesitate. As soon as he heard that people were still in there, he ran inside the burning building.
"Not your choice." Tony grinned.
"Castiel is alright. We promise, everything is fine."
"Dean? What are you two doing here?" Bucky asked him.
"Where are they?" Tony asked, as he and Sam looked around the secret room.
"That could work." Bobby said and the others looked at him. "Maybe she heard something from the other side."
"That went well." John said.
"Mhmmm this is great!" Dean said, while having half of the sandwich in his mouth.
______________________________
"And Dean here is from another universe?" John asked.
"Ant...man... You are one of the new superheroes!" Dean said.
"Just was outside during the brake."
"You boys could be perfect for out little experiments." The guy said and slightly cut at Dean's throat, that a little bit of blood was drawn.
"For now."
"Unbelievable..." Steve muttered and shook his head.
"What happens now? What will Lucifer do?" Natasha asked worried.
"Sssshhh I want to watch this." Clint said and Bruce looked at him weird.
Right before he stepped into the hole, he stopped. He turned around the Avengers looked at him in shock.
"The- You- What?!"
"What is it?" John asked his son.
"Sorry, your father is busy and no one else had time to come. Cas said that you know the way home and can direct me?"
They laughed and then went and told the others the good news. Later they had a little celebration at the Avengers tower with a lot of food and some beer.
"Why not."
"These are creatures from my world. Demons, vampires, ghouls wendigos, werewolves... I- Rob said they don't exist in this world, but now they do. It has to be him."
"Dean."
"This i my brother Dean. Dean, these are Wanda, Vision and Sam, also known as Falcon. They are new members of the Avengers."
Then they vanished again and the light turned back to normal.
A huge man, flesh looking rotten and eyes white and deadly threw Bucky against the wall. Dean tried to shoot him, but the guy was extremely fast for his size and punched Dean in the jaw.
"Hey Sammy..."
"You really want to leave?" Bucky asked.
"I feared that Cas would have no idea about cars in this world as well..." He muttered, as he petted Miracle, who followed them outside.
"Dean! You are back. What took you so long?" Sam asked, as he went up to Dean, smiling and looking for food.
Dean just grinned and pulled his arm away. "Alright, sorry. You are right." He tried to look like he was really sorry. He took out the peanut butter and pretended to put it back in the shelf. He looked past the man, tilted his head and looked confused, as if he saw something weird.
Sam looked around. "How are you guys doing?"
"Hello Dean, hello Sam. I am JARVIS an AI created by Tony Stark. I run this tower and inform the avengers about everything that is going on in here or in the world."
"The God? Like the bad God? The one who destroyed all the other worlds?" Sam asked.
"At her pay grade, she ain't sweating holy water." Ruby explained.
"Want to try out some stuff?" Natasha asked.
"Dad, no!" Sam said to him. "It's alright. He saved us. It's over."
"Where are the others?"
"Murders happen all the time, boy." Bobby said.
"Why?"
"It's complicated, but it was because those stupid demons and- well... anyway, there was a way to bring him back." Dean struggled with the words. It was clearly uncomfortable for him to talk about it. "There was a way to sell your own soul to save someone else."
"Why don’t you want our help, Dean?"
"It's not- its not her anymore."
Tony smiled and clapped Dean on the shoulder. "Well, if we do save everyone, then you will officially be declared a hero."
"This is great, Dean." Sam sat down on the bed and tested the softness.
"How would you ruin our lives?" Jody asked and raised her eyebrow at Dean.
"You are alive! We thought you were dead!" Tony said and instantly hugged the surprised young man.
"FBI?"
"Really, Dean? What happened? No, more like HOW did you NOT die?"
Dean woke up and this time, where ever he was, it was dark. He slowly sat up, even though it cost him a lot of strength.
"Dean. Charming as ever."
"Yes. Come on." Dean wanted to go upstairs to grab their things, but Sam stood still.
"I've told you why."
Clint looked at them and wondered. "Do you know other hunters? You could have lived with them, instead on the streets."
"Let's go Sam, Bucky." Dean said and walked up the stairs.
"But, who is this?" Mary asked.
Dean shrugged.
"Yes... He is not from here and he is not your father, but he looks and sounds exactly like him." Castiel explained in a soft voice.
"Yes, without your wife."
"This is one room. The other is right next door-"
"Yeah, you are right. Thanks Dean."
"Thanks. Maybe the news." Dean said and JARVIS put on the news.
"I have it on Monday. I need to be back by then."
Sam was about to give Ruby the knife, when Dean's eyes widened.
"You will stay here and we will think of something. Maybe... I mean I know you went through a lot, but maybe you will be able to settle down here." Castiel said.
"We should think about who we tell about Dean anyway. He can not stay inside for the rest of his life." John commented and the others nodded.
"Anyway, why exactly are we here?" Kevin asked, as he grabbed a cookie.
"Yes." He nodded again. "Sam and Dean Winchester fought against God. I went to their world to see if I can help, but it was already too late. Dean and God were the only ones left alive. God was about to kill Dean as well and when he attacked, I used my power to bring him to this world."
"What, you mean this?" Dean grinned and kissed Jack on his forehead.
"In my world, she lived in South Dakota."
"Dean, I stopped hunting after we got here 8 years ago. Bucky on the other hand hunted a lot since you left us. He would be a much bigger help then me." Sam told him.
"You don't have to decide now. We will tell a few others, because sooner or later one of us won't be able to hold that secret any longer." John said, glaring at Sam.
The others shook their heads, but left it at that.
After Dean was at a gas station, figuring out where he was, he realized that he wasn't that far from Bobby's place. He found an old car and made his way over to  him.
They waited for two hours, until they finally heard a door opening and four men walked in.
"Well, I should see if Cas found something..." Dean said and then Eileen walked in from the kitchen. She smiled at him and the girls ran outside, to play in the garden, while the adults walked towards the driveway.
"Was it normal for him to be here at the time that the attack happened?"
"Shit... I'm so sorry Dean."
"Is she a hunter?" Bruce asked.
-- 5 years later --
"I’m tired Tony. Sam and I had a lot of close calls and I don’t want this anymore. Sammy deserves a better life and I’m just dragging him with me. There are more and more demons out there and I don’t know if I can and want to fight them alone... I wish I never left with dad."
"...Fine. Have it your way." Dean said and went upstairs.
Dean tried to open his eyes again, but he was too tired. He lost consciousness and everything was finally quiet....
"Oh damn it."
"Yes. Though maybe she also wanted to kill the men there in order to protect others... who knows."
They appeared on a battlefield, where superheroes fought against aliens.
"It's the truth."
When Dean reached the living area, he saw everyone there. It seemed that they were just discussing something.
Castiel sighed. "They wanted Lucifer to get free so that a war brakes out. The humans on this earth would have died, but the angels would win the war and then a new paradise would arise."
"Anyway, is it just you two?" Sam asked.
"Thanks, Dean. But please know, that I will always be there to help you. No matter what." Sam said.
"Half the souls were gone. For over five years.“ Castiel said, though he also looked confused.
"Then who are we going to tell? I am not sure if the kids would understand..." Castiel asked and thought about it.
"Yeah, whatever. I'll take you home. You too Bucky."
"Finally.“ Sam muttered and everyone smiled.
"Dean, what is the last thing you remember?" Bobby asked him.
"Sure. Just call if you need anything. Come on Jack. Dean needs to rest."
Tony sighed. "Dean-"
He heard a boy screaming and ran into a room full of flames.
God chuckled. "Haha yeah... not happening." He snapped his finger, but nothing happened. He snapped again, still nothing. God started to panic. He snapped multiple times and looked around. He glared at his shaking hands. "...no... no no no no NO! What did you do?!"
"I will not just let you fall to your death.“ Tony shook his head with tears in his eyes.
After Dean finished, Sam told him to wait inside, until he would open the door and Dean waited several minutes. He heard mainly Sam and John explaining to the kids about what's going on. Then, there was silence.
"What...?" Bucky asked.
"Well, you guys know about our dad and how he made the deal with the demon, right?"
"Well, don’t worry. I’ll come up with something." Tony said and got up to got to his lab and think.
"And tell them that we found our dead son on the side of the road, months after he died?" John asked and Mary sighed.
In front of the house parked the Impala and Castiel leaned against it, looking at a map.
"Sam? How are you?" Tony asked happily. They celebrated their victory with a huge meal and everyone was having a good time.
"Then I am coming with you."
"We would like it if you and Sam stayed here for a while... At least for now, until we figured everything out. It's not good to jump right back into action."
"Tony… I love you, but PLEASE shut up for like one minute."
"Bucky had told us what happened. We are glad that you two are alright and thankful that you helped him and Tony." Steve stated.
"Guys we have a problem."
"Well, what other option do we have?!"
"When I was four years old, when Sammy was just born, a demon killed our mother, Mary Winchester. H-He burned her. The rest of us got out of the house, but after that... John, our father became a hunter and tried to hunt down the demon who did it. From then on I learned about monsters. Supernatural beings and creatures that just want to kill you. Sam and I never had a normal childhood. We were always moving around, because our father got from one hunt to the next. We often stayed in crappy hotels and we learned to shoot guns and handle knives at a very young age. Later, Sam went to college." Dean looked at this version of his younger brother. "You- He... he never agreed with our father and wanted nothing to do with hunting. When we were in our mid twenties though, John vanished. He got problems on a hunt and I needed Sam's help to find him and save him. A lot of stuff happened and it's far too much to explain it all in one day, but... Sam and I hunted together. Our father died, but eventually we got our revenge, by killing the damn demon who destroyed our lives." Dean took another deep breath.
"Yeah... How about you?"
"I already tried to, Sir. So far no luck."
„Exactly. And we got no time and no choice either.“ Sam was annoyed, but Dean shook his head.
"C-Cas, do you know what-?"
Bucky sighed and then he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up and saw Tony standing behind his seat.
Sam looked up the address, while Bucky and Dean cleaned up.
"Hi." Dean said and waved shortly. Eileen smiled as well. "Hi. S-Sam told me." She said, while gesturing with her hands.
The Avengers looked at the brothers and Steve took a step forward.
"We can not just leave you here." Bucky said.
Castiel nodded. "It... It happened two years ago. You- Our Dean was a firefighter. One of the best in this area. Everyone respected him and he saved countless lives. Even on his last job he saved a little girl, but then-... then the building collapsed and there was nothing they could do to save yo- him." Castiel swallowed and tried to hold back his tears. Sam, who sat next to him gently patted his back. Castiel cleared his throat again. "We have a son. Adopted, of course. His name is Jack. He is eight now.... God how do I explain this to him...?"
"I don't know... maybe they found another secret tunnel."
"Will they be alright?"
"Alright. But still, be careful." Mary said, as she began to clean up the table.
Tony and Bucky nodded and Dean opened the door, letting the beasts in. All three of them shot at the monsters and after a few minutes of nonstop shooting, everything was quiet.
"This doesn't belong in a building factory."
He took a deep breath and looked around. The house stood in front of a forest with a lot of space around it. In the distance he heard cars driving, so the road to the town was probably not far. They had no direct neighbors, so it would be alright for him to be outside, though he still put on a cap, just in case.
"Tony always hums the music theme for like days after we watched the movie." Bucky answered annoyed.
After 20 minutes of driving, they finally arrived at the place where the attack happened.
"We are not scared just... careful." Sam tried to explain. Eileen looked at him with worry and Sam just told them that people should stay inside for now, because of a coming storm.
"I have been to at least 6 different schools before. Why should I try to get along with others or bother to learn anything when I know that I'll leave again soon? When I know that all I'll ever be is a hunter? I have to make money, not waste my time there." Dean whispered. He looked dead serious and Bucky wasn't sure how to respond.
Castiel described the way to the school and Dean jumped into the Impala.
"What‘s with the wings, man?“ Dean looked at them and carefully touched them.
"We report that multiple planes have crashed-"
"Bucky!" Dean yelled and tried to attack again, but the huge man kicked him and punched him again. Dean stumbled to the ground, spitting out blood. "Son of a bitch..." He got up again, but as he looked at the huge guy, he suddenly felt a sting at his neck and then everything turned black...
