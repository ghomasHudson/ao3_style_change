John looked at Sherlock and saw the King looking at him entirely honestly, smiling at him, and all John could think was that his eyes were no longer sad.
Having talked about how the others had met, John’s bitchy other friends, their families and their other friends for over three hours, him and Sherlock were as close as they could possibly get without touching: John could almost feel the electric impulses the younger boy was giving off, dancing along their so-close legs. Sherlock’s pupils were blown from the alcohol, his hands draped casually over the arm of the sofa, his lips as curved as cupid’s bow, slightly open, pink tongue wetting them every now and then-
Sherlock coughed and continued, ‘maybe we could fake being in a relationship for a bit. It would really piss Mycroft off.’
The curtain twitched again, and a strikingly beautiful girl about the same age as Sherlock stepped onto the balcony. She stood next to Mycroft, who frowned at her and wrinkled his nose in the same way that he had done when he looked at John, originally, and Sherlock turned around, away from the crowd, and-
‘Except me,’ John laughed, and Sherlock shook his head. ‘You’re not normal, John. Not at all.’ John smiled at him and Sherlock felt that feeling in his chest again, the same feeling he got when he drunk hot coffee and it burnt his throat on the way down. It hurt, and it made his eyes water, but the taste far exceeded any discomfort.
‘His mother died when he was very young, didn’t she?’ John asked quietly. Harry nodded. ‘He was only five or six. It was very public, though. You were probably a bit young but I remember this picture of him at the funeral. He was sitting by himself, this little kid in a suit and a tie, and everyone else was crying, and he just had this single tear streaking down his face. It was-‘ Harry swallowed. ‘It stayed with me. I hate them, I hate him, but no little boy should see their mother buried. Especially in the way she died…all that mystery.’ Harry fell silent, watching the TV through narrowed eyes.
John whipped around, heart racing, until he laid eyes on the tall, dark haired boy in a long, dark coat. ‘Jesus
John goes to the flat after his twin sons are born and is struck by Sherlock’s gaunt appearance. A flicker of worry surprises him, and he gets the younger man up and dressed and then sits him down with a cup of tea and says,
Irene chuckled. ‘You arrogant bugger. I would have you, right here, until you begged for mercy twice.’
like he did the last time John saw him, over two years ago. ‘My brother mentioned that were holidaying here when I talked to him last week.’ He sniffed, looking around in disdain. ‘Not exactly the Carribean, is it, Johnny?’ He winked at his son, who remained in dumb silence, scarcely able to believe it, that his father was here and joking, laughing like it had been two days since he saw him instead of
John had almost gotten used to Sherlock’s rapid deductions (‘I do not see,’ he had said when the conversation took a minute turn into Sherlock, ‘I observe.’) but not quite- he failed to hide the surprise on his face. ‘Woah.’
‘Was that not good?’ Sherlock pondered. ‘Hmm. Have you seen the, um, rack on the Princess of Monaco? They seem to be quite big, related to the size of the three other teenage girls I know.’
‘Well?’ Sherlock said, and for the first time he didn't sound cocky and arrogant and confident, he sounded scared and timid and a little bit apprehensive. ‘What d’you think? Am I right?’
William’s mouth was working wordlessly. ‘Wh- but- you have to,’ he said finally. Morag stepped in. ‘If you want to remain at the palace, William,’ she said smugly, as if she as sure that Sherlock would just ‘you will stop your relationship with this pleb.’
Sherlock leaned back in his chair and smiled at the ceiling. ‘I love John Watson,’ he whispered, and he couldn't actually believe that John, his John, had actually just
They’re lying on Sherlock’s bed, in Sherlock’s flat. They’ve just come from a case, and John is chattering happily, tracing Sherlock’s hand with his index finger. Sherlock has never been happier, but it is time.
‘Sherlock.’ Mycroft growled, storming through the door of his bedroom waving a piece of paper in his hand. ‘You should have been ready twenty minutes ago. Did you even look at my itinerary?’
And Mycroft is right. They have a son together, the accomplishment of Sherlock’s life, his greatest achievement and his greatest weakness. They live together. When Sherlock thinks the word
Vi and Tavvy exchanged a quick glance before turning around and smirking evilly at their father, who took a step backwards. ‘No, no, no, I wasn't being sexist- OH GOD NO!’
Sherlock straightened up and surveyed his would-be brother-in-law with narrowed eyes. ‘Lestrade, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but that might actually be the best idea I’ve heard yet.’
) even though it’s not what he wants to say, not at all. Even as he collapses onto two knees next to the jumbled mess of blood and coat and thick, curly hair he is still saying it, over and over, in his brain and body and blood, the words in time with the frantic beat of his heart.
Sherlock shrugged, because that couldn’t matter less to him now, not with John so close and so available and so brilliant, his and only his, right in front of him. ‘So what? I have you now.’
Sherlock loved to dance. Ballet, ballroom, tap, he could do them all to a very high standard but as John pulled him onto the dance floor…
His heart racing, his head pounding, John genuinely couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe that Sherlock had done that, couldn’t believe that he had experienced feelings so deliciously intense, and couldn’t believe that he had just
and he needed to take action, because even from a distance he had seen Sherlock self destructing and he’d done
‘You, ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool.’ John’s taken a step closer, his eyes dark and hooded, and Sherlock feels something flickering in his chest that he hasn’t felt for a very, very,
‘Spit it out,’ Sherlock groaned, running his hand through his hair. ‘I only have three months until prom and if I don't ask him soon someone else will.’
‘Hey,’ John whispered, ignoring his daughter for the moment, looking his partner straight in the eye. ‘Hey. Stop. Look at me.’
‘If you die we’re screwed!’ Victor screamed as he slipped down the tiles. ‘Jesus, Sher, what do we do now?’
The moment Sherlock opens the door John’s kissing him, hand in his curls, and the adrenalin rush is so good that John almost passes out.
John brushed his hand away and stood up. ’I need some air. Have fun together, Sherlock. You should have a blast; two psychopaths hanging out together. God, I knew I shouldn't have fucking trusted you. We’re done. Have a fun fucking life, you idiot.’
John managed to get to his feet. ‘He didn’t hit you?’ He said frantically, checking Sherlock all over, though the younger man was still on his feet, if paler than a ghost and shaking.
John chuckled before propping himself up on one arm and kissing his boyfriend gently. ‘You think you’re so funny.’ He murmured, kissing the side of Sherlock’s neck.
He hauled himself through the door and sighed. The cold wind on his face made his mind feel suddenly clear and he even forgot John, because he hadn’t realised he had been feeling slightly ill until now, when he was finally away from the bright lights and the boring relatives and the constant pressure that now he was King, King of an entire country, a Kingdom-
Morag’s eyes flicked over the people in the room. She avoided at Mycroft, dismissed Trisha, blinked at Sherlock and glared at John. John didn’t move, staring straight back at her, that evil woman, that bitch, one of the main reasons why he and Sherlock had to hide their feelings for each other, as if they were ashamed-
fire). ‘You, or the thing?’ He laughed, and he saw John laughing too (oh, how he loved to make John laugh). ‘Funny!’ John grinned, and Sherlock ducked his head. ‘Thank you.’
‘A hell of a lot worse than William Sherlock Scott or Edward Mycroft.’ Sherlock finished. ‘Why are we here, Trisha? Are we having a family meeting without that insufferable bitch?’
Sherlock smiled and let him go, waving at the crowd who waved back, still chanting ‘Johnlock’ over and over, and said out of the side of his mouth, ‘you were right.’
Sherlock nodded silently, and John put a hand over Sherlock’s hand, resting on his knee. ‘I get it.’
Morag glared at the King for a long moment before lowering her eyes. ‘Of course, your majesty,’ she said quietly. ‘Apologies.’
For the first time since he was five years old, Sherlock felt a mother’s touch, and suddenly all those memories, everything he had kept locked up for the past twelve years, came flooding out.
Sherlock bit his lip hard. He wouldn’t do that, wouldn’t do what James had told him too. However much it pained him, Sherlock was an angel. Or at least on the side of the angels.
He needs the thrill, the rush, the buzz like he needs water and oxygen and food: it’s an absolute necessity, and John knows he will do whatever possible to achieve it.
‘Sherlock, I’m not kidding when I say there’s a good chance they’ll all faint. Especially when they find out I’m the mysterious boy you keep being seen with around London. Oh, god, Harry will never shut up about it,’ John fretted. ‘Why are-‘
Sherlock picked up the phone. ‘Hello, John, I’m here,’ he said as calmly as he could. ‘Can you repeat your previous statement, please?’
The curly-haired boy cocked his head and said loudly, ‘Etes-vous stupide, ou pouvez-vous pas parler français?’
‘It’s why I have such an issue with Mycroft,’ Sherlock mumbled against John’s lips. ‘Partly because of the whole getting close to people and killing them thing, but also because he didn’t help me. I think he knew about it, and he did nothing, just stayed at boarding school and didn’t mention it, ever. She left after eight, nine months. I don’t know whether she was fired or not-‘
And even as he says the words he always wanted to say, he knows it’s too late. Sherlock’s chest remains still, his body broken, his ears unhearing and his eyes – his beautiful eyes, that once held all the secrets of the universe alongside the sad little boy he was always trying to run from – open and unseeing.
Harry smiled slightly, though her eyes were rimmed with red as well. ‘Yeah. That was what I got from what you told us.’
Mycroft had adopted a soppy, lost-in-thought look that Sherlock wished never to see on his brother’s face again, and he opened his mouth to insult Mycroft or at least do something to break the weird tension, when he was interrupted by a sharp knock came on the door.
‘A premier?’ Irene said. She was lounging in Sherlock’s chair, eyes fixed on some new show that she loved (all Sherlock knew was that it was set in prison and extremely lesbian; everytime he looked at the screen women were fucking) that was playing on Sherlock’s television. ‘Are you sure?’
possible moment he could have chosen. John would die for Sherlock again and again and again; he would endure eternity in hell for Sherlock; he would do anything and everything in his power to keep that man, that wonderful, brilliant, beautiful man safe.
‘I never said she didn’t,’ Morag replied. ‘I said she didn’t originally want him. What else? She had a three year relationship at university.’
Sherlock was faffing around with Mycroft’s desk, so John had positioned himself by the window, staring onto the street below. The parade had been snaking past for a while, and John was remembering what it had been like when he was ten: the smell of smoke and food, the sound of laughter, the colours blending together in a perfect cacophony of the senses. He’d never forgotten it, and he knew he never would.
‘Because,’ Sherlock whispered, hiccuping slightly, ‘You always know what I mean, regardless of the language I’m speaking.’
Molly’s younger brother, a freckly boy with a huge smile and brown hair, yelled for her and she stepped away from John. ‘Have a good year,’ she said, and John stuck his hands in his pocket. ‘I’ll try.’
‘He’ll be downstairs, love.’ Jenny said comfortably. ‘No need to bother him. He won’t mind. John…are you…’
And John felt an ache in his chest that immediately convinced him, reassured him, consolidated the belief that he was not over Sherlock, that he would never be over Sherlock, that he didn’t want to be over Sherlock and that he wanted nothing more than to be with Sherlock, right then, for the rest of their lives. He didn't care that Sherlock had slept with someone else, he didn't care that it had been Sherlock's fault that over seven hundred and fifty people had died on that New Years Eve all those years ago: all he cared about was Sherlock, having Sherlock, but now he couldn't, he would never, ever, ever be able to.
‘Jenny.’ Jenny said quickly. ‘If I’m calling a Prince by his preferred name, you must call me by mine.’
But it had stuck in John’s brain for years, because deep down he knew that Harry was right. He was the all-British boy, the no-nonsense boy, the simple boy, the comforting boy that the girls brought home, the boy their parents would love but they would soon get bored of. The average Joe.
‘I made a mistake and I’m sorry, but we both know that Sherlock would kill himself a thousand times if he thought it would keep you alive. You need to stop him.’
The waiter stuck out his chest, clearly proud, though still looking at Sherlock a bit suspiciously. ‘Ta,’ he smiled. ‘Do you know him?’
Irene looked vaguely offended. ‘I don't think it’s the stupidest, Sherlock. Think about all the things I’ve done. Seriously. I slept with that substitute teacher-‘
‘Go.’ William commanded, and Sherlock nodded. ‘Fine.’ He turned around, gesturing for Victor to follow him. They were almost out of the door when William called, ‘Sherlock? No…no inappropriate behaviour.’
‘I’m glad you said that.’ John handed his paintbrush to a random woman in all purple next to him, who gave him a thumbs up and promptly started painting the man to her right, before pulling off his shirt. ‘Ta da!’
Sherlock had laughed, at the time. Asked Jenny to stand up to her, to scream at her. He couldn’t, he said, so Jenny should.
she seems to say, and John knows that Sherlock would have loved his granddaughter too. Yet another person who Sherlock never got to meet because of a stupid mistake.
who should never have saved his life with her own. She should have lived, she should have stayed, because Sherlock knows that the only thing worse than seeing John with someone else is seeing John heartbroken.
‘Leave Irene alone.’ Sherlock muttered as he scanned the hall for anyone interesting. ‘I like her.’ It wouldn't change anything, he knew, because Mycroft hated Irene, loathed her even; it was a close call between her and James over who Mycroft detested most. Mycroft's reason for hating Irene was that he didn't trust her- Sherlock often countered this by telling him that he trusted
‘So what about you, Jim?’ John asked politely. Sherlock couldn't understand how his boyfriend hadn't realised something was dramatically wrong with him, and tried to signal with his eyes that he needed to shut up and leave, but John was fixated on Jim. ‘Who are you?’ He blushed. ‘That sounded so rude, I’m sorry-‘
his John, in every sense of the word, no walls up, nothing. No facade, no walls, just Sherlock and John.
Sherlock ignored them all, amazed at how the crowd parted for him as he walked through. Sherlock Holmes was still a teenager, a eleven days shy of his twentieth birthday, and he was the most powerful man in the world.
In some countries, the monarchy had been overthrown in the previous three centuries; none of these countries were world powers. The governments had been nowhere near as good as a single ruler, especially when the ruler was good, and William was extremely good. Sherlock might not agree with the near-dictatorship but it kept their colonies, it kept their allies, and it kept them as the single most powerful country and Kingdom in the world.
Irene hesitated and looked down. ‘Hmm. I-‘ her eyes darted behind him and she went red, looking down before leaning forwards and whispering, ‘later,’ in his ear.
Sherlock shrugged. ‘She’s highly intelligent and she loves it. It’s also a hell of a lot better than her
John wiped his eye with his free hand and chuckled. ‘Sherlock Holmes. Are you asking me to marry you?’
About halfway through the summer, John and Sherlock found themselves alone at the bar in the early hours of the morning. There was soft music playing, few people left in the bar and the lights were dim: perfect, just like everything else from that summer. Since both were eighteen they both had drinks, though Sherlock was barely touching his (he preferred to stay away from intoxicating substances since he’d gone through the clinic) and John didn't particularly want to get drunk.
Sherlock glanced at John; the older man was now glaring at Irene. John hated Irene, hated her with a passion, and every time Sherlock asked why, he would just deny it, despite it being crystal clear.
John’s done this with so many grandchildren now that he feels like a professional: he congratulates Charlotte, who’s being wheeled away to be cleaned up. He suspects she only agreed to go because she’s high on pain medication - no way would the Charlotte he knows leave her children mere moments after they were born - but he’s happy, because he wants a moment alone with his son and his grandsons.
He waited for a reply as he thought of John, with his crinkly eyes and his lopsided smile and his brilliant mind and better heart-
He was clever, he was funny. He was brilliant, he was modest and he had the potential to be the best King in the history of the world. John could see that as clear as day, and he was sure that almost everybody else who knew him could as well.
He did everything he could think of. He begged, he cried, he went on a hunger strike. He ran away (briefly), he pleaded with Mycroft, he even called social services. When none of those worked, he tried to be good: to show them that he could take care of himself. He
If there was one thing that Sherlock and Mycroft agreed on, it was that Mycroft’s twins were the best children in the whole world. Mycroft was only twenty-five and Lestrade, his boyfriend/partner, was a year younger but they’d been together for years and when a ‘government’ friend of Mycroft’s had mentioned there was a trial involving the creation of infants from same-sex couples they had signed up straight away.
‘No,’ Sherlock said, turning around and pointing his pen accusingly at his brother. ‘You have, don't deny it. I’m telling Mummy-‘
‘Where’ve you been?’ John said firmly. Henry frowned, glancing at Jenny. ‘Did your mother not say anything to you?’
But now every part of John is broken, and Sherlock can see it so clearly that it almost kills him to look. So he doesn’t look- he stares straight ahead, at the chair that used to be John’s, and thinks about Culverton Smith and suffocation and, Christ help him, the drugs, the drugs that he went on because Mary told him to and the drugs that could have, would have, should have killed him. He thinks about James Moriarty, and Faith Smith, and the feeling of falling.  He thinks about the mess he’s made of everything, he thinks about a dead dog at the seaside, and he thinks about the light that he actually
John turned sharply, wondering if he had said it out loud. The boy who’d said it smiled, shaking his head. ‘You didn’t say anything. I just- I understood.’
‘Hey, Hunty.’ John joked. The soldiers generally called themselves by their first names or nicknames; John was Johnny, Tigger’s real name was Aidan, but Hunter had said the moment he came through the door, ‘if anyone calls me Quentin, I will kick them in the balls and laugh as they writhe in front of me.’
Sherlock sighed theatrically but did as she said, following her out of the door. Irene led the way, striding confidently through the palace until they reached the entrance hall.
‘Of course!’ Sherlock said. ‘If you desire, you could even meet my older brother, though he is a truly appalling person.’
Jim smiled evilly. ‘Don’t interrupt, I’m not finished. You pull out the ejaculate and you say (continuing on from the last sentence, of course) so will you come to prom with me?’
‘God, John, it’s not like I’m proposing.’ Sherlock scoffed. ‘You’re just introducing your friend to your mother, father and sister. That is not that big a deal.’
‘You go more French when you’re drunk,’ John laughed, and Sherlock playfully hit his shoulder. ‘Well, the French spend half their time drunk. The wine is exquisite.’
about not sleeping with people who might banish us from the country!' Mr Watson exclaimed. Before Sherlock could ask why in God's name they'd had a conversation like that, John’s mouth fell open and he said hurriedly, ‘no, Jesus, no. No, Sherlock’s just- Sherlock’s my friend. We just, um, kept it quiet, you know? So...well. So no one would react like you're reacting.’
He joins the army after Uni because he thinks the adrenalin experienced out in the desert will be a million times better than anything he will feel in a stuffy office in London. He’s right in terms of the physical adrenalin, but there aren't many people who’s lives he can ruin out there, and John decided long ago that
‘We wish for privacy at this time.’ Mycroft was actually crying now, tears running down his face, though his voice stayed strong. ‘Our whole family will make an address in three days’ time. My younger brother apologises for not doing this himself, as is custom, but…’ Mycroft let out a shuddering sigh, ‘he was in no condition.’
But it wasn’t. She was pulling him closer to her, and then her head was on his shoulder and she was whispering into his ear, words tumbling over each other, and Sherlock couldn’t believe what he was hearing. The thoughts of John were banished from his mind; all he could hear was Irene.
‘John,’ Sherlock breathed, and John pulled Sherlock towards him so their heads were touching, his lips just grazing Sherlock’s left ear as he murmured, ‘Will you run away with me?’
John relaxed slightly and sighed, looking out into the city. ‘I don’t know why I came. I guess I just- I had to see you again.’
talking like nothing had happened, like they were still John-and-Sherlock, Sherlock-and-John, but there was no time for that as Sherlock said, ‘He wasn't there when I woke up. We were sharing a bed,’ John winced in the darkness, ‘And he was gone when I woke up. When he didn't come back I got worried, so I dressed and came outside. He was waiting outside the main building, and I watched Sherrinford come out and then I saw them leave. I didn't think much of it, I thought-‘ his voice caught, and John could almost hear the tears in his voice as he continued, ‘I thought they might be doing something for me, but when my father woke me up-‘ He dissolved into tears and John didn't even hesitate before reaching an arm around the younger boy. ‘God, Sherlock.’
Mycroft coughed, glaring at Harry. ‘I have no idea how you got in here, Harriet, but there’s no way you’re going on the balcony.’
‘God, no,’ Victor breaths, and they are kissing again, much more fiercely than before, Victor trying desperately to take off Sherlock’s dinner jacket (the 18
‘How could you?’ Sherlock whispered. He was crying again, clearly thinking about his mother and even John was no longer dry-eyed. He wanted nothing more than to go up to his husband and kiss him, say sorry, hug him and kill that bitch, kill Morag-
Mike Stamford shrugged and picked up the recently dissected heart, moving it into the ‘waste’ bin (it was merely a green, plastic tray which Sherlock dumped all his used body parts in before the hospital cleaners moved them at night) and checking Sherlock’s liver, which he’d added the hydrochloric acid to in the hope that it might dissolve it. ‘This acid is far too concentrated, Sherlock, it’ll dissolve the whole thing. All you’ll have left is a sludgy pile of protein.’
Sherlock’s a good kisser, even when surprised, but John is far too busy experiencing the biggest buzz of his life to care. He’s never done anything with a man before, and he doesn't know if that’s what’s doing it or if it’s just
‘Sir, is your Majesty willing to take the oath?’ The Archbishop asked. Sherlock swallowed and looked at the Archbishop. ‘I am willing.
Harry sighed loudly. ‘What’s the point? They’re stupid, they’re terrible leaders and it’s positively Neanderthal. They’re not better than us just because their last name is…what is it, John?’
‘Oh yeah,’ John remembered. ‘Man U v. Chelsea.’ He had been an avid Man U supporter all his life, though Greg liked Chelsea. It would be a great match, hopefully.
‘And I like you.’ Sherlock continued. ‘Which is strange, because I like nobody. I tolerate some, like my brother, and I feel affection towards some, like my nanny/housekeeper, but I like no one.’
‘Ouch,’ Jim said sarcastically, doing up his flies on Sherlock’s bed. ‘A whore. Never been called that before, though it’s addressed to a friend of mine quite often. You’d love her, Sherlock. Maybe I should organise a, ah, playdate, with the three of us.’
‘Bet you never saw this coming,’ John says, and Sherlock realises that he is moving, moving towards the man he’d thought was his friend, the man he cared most about in this life or the next, the sharp knife of treachery boring into his heart. He wants to take John and tell him it can’t be right, that he can’t be Moriarty, that he’s John Watson and he is his
John encouraged him to eat. John encouraged him to drink. John even cooked him his favourite foods; after Sherlock admitted his favourite dish was macaroni cheese, a meal that hadn’t been cooked for him since his mother passed, John had made it for him after printing the recipe off the internet. Sherlock could still see John, standing in the palace kitchen grating cheese, biting his lip in concentration as the chefs laughed at him.
‘Yeah.’ Victor said. It had been a huge scandal, apparently; Mycroft had shown Sherlock the newspaper cuttings. ‘So?’
In his haze of grief, John realised that he hadn't seen his older sister cry since her girlfriend, Clara, had broken up with her over three years ago.
Mycroft looked suitably affronted, smoothing down his suit. ‘I don’t see what’s so funny,’ he said snootily. Sherlock snorted before turning to John and saying, eyes twinkling with mirth, ‘Mycroft’s always been obsessed with that stupid philosopher.’
Sherlock laughed, and John was so close that he felt the warmth of his breath on his face. ‘You’re an exception, John.’ He paused, blinked, and said quietly, ‘You’re an exception to all of me.’
John had no idea what that stood for (they were in France, so he assumed it was something French) and didn't really care: personally, he would much rather stay with his mum.
It was like the ground had lifted out from under Sherlock’s feet. He dropped John’s hand and backed into the wall, staring into the dead eyes of the one person he had thought he would never, ever see again
Then he noticed the person standing next to Mycroft, and his silent heart stuttered back to life with a jolt that made him gasp.
His life without Sherlock is a life without living: his life without Sherlock is, in a word, non-existent. He cannot comprehend moving forwards without Sherlock by his side, of living and breathing and existing without him. For John Watson, there is no life, no world and therefore no future without Sherlock Holmes: he cannot,
‘Now.’ Henry said firmly. John sighed but stood, walking out of the room and down the hall into the den.
holiday of his life. He liked Sherlock more than he liked any of his regular, term-time friends and he was more upset than he cared to admit that they wouldn't see each other again until the following summer.
), Sherlock’s stepmother, smiled. Sherlock nodded back; he didn’t mind Trisha: in fact, on a planet where Sherlock didn't just hate everyone, he would have liked her. There were stories every other week about how he resented the woman who had taken his mother’s place, which was just plain stupid. It wasn’t Trisha’s fault that she had fallen in love with his father, and it would have been illogical for Sherlock to have thought that. She wasn’t boring and he would’ve said he liked her, though he never said that about anyone, just in case he grew attached. In fact the only problem with Trisha was that she had managed to produce the single most annoying child in the history of the world-
Nathaniel graduates with first-degree honours in Chemistry and Psychology from Oxford University on his twentieth birthday. He’d gone to Oxford a year early, though it should have been two; he’d repeated year thirteen because he’d ‘not wanted to be the youngest there by several years’. John suspects this was not the whole truth, if not a complete lie: he’d wanted to go to Oxford with his best friends, Charlotte Andrews and Callum Hooper, who were in the year below him. Although Mycroft and Sherlock’s parents had both disliked this decision, John hadn't cared because he loves his son and wants him to be as happy as possible.
‘Absurd?’ John cried. ‘He was in your room. How did he get in if he’s practically at the top of MI6’s hit list?’
Sherlock nodded and William reached out with his arms, clasping his son’s shoulders. ‘God, you’re so like your mother,’ John heard him whisper as he pulled in Sherlock for a hug.
‘I forget to mention,’ Sherlock said as he put the picture back on the mantlepiece and sank into his armchair, ‘Tilda came round with something for you from Mycroft.’
‘No!’ John shouted. ‘God, no. I’ve not got a girlfriend. I’ve brought them, though. Um, Sher? Come in.’
‘Thirty years, Lord Sherlock,’ Colin says, and Sherlock huffs. ‘I haven’t seen Mycroft for half a century. Let’s read it, then.’
The first activity was volleyball and John and Harry followed the group of laughing French children. The curly-haired boy, Sherlock, was clearly the leader of John’s group and although he didn't know what it was that Sherlock had said when they walked in, it was clearly an insult of some sort. John didn't like being insulted, and he immediately vowed to stay as far away from him as possible.
But now it’s quiet, and they’re standing opposite each other, John sweating and shivering and breathing heavily, Sherlock pale and fraught with the tension that’s been keeping him going. Too quiet, almost, a silence that needs to be interrupted, and Sherlock’s head and heart and body is so crammed with emotion he feels like he’s going to-
‘Obviously,’ Sherlock drawled, clearly not listening properly. Mycroft closed his eyes, sighed heavily through his nose, and looked at John instead. ‘You inform the crowds, you apologise for keeping the secret but make no references to being ashamed or regretting it. John, you say nothing.’
‘How did I get here?’ Henry was examining his fingernails, and John realised numbly that he was still wearing his dog tags: he looks
‘No!’ Sherlock shouted, gripping John tighter, then, more quietly, ‘No. Please, John, ne me quitte pas.’
The boy, John, was staring at him in wide-eyed astonishment. ‘That was epic, mate, how did you do that? How did- did Mike tell you about me?’
groaned. ‘Right.’ He untangled himself from the other man, doing up his trousers, frowning at the sticky white ejaculate all over them, and sighed. ‘You’re going to get me fired.’
For some reason Sherlock and Irene got on like a house on fire. They were both incredibly intelligent, both incredibly attractive and both wicked at heart: they were
Also that Sherlock was gay, Irene was a lesbian and they had no romantic feelings towards each other, but mainly the in-love-with-John thing.
It saw two adults and two children, two men, one girl and one boy, two fathers and two children, but most of all it saw a family. And John knew, the moment that picture was taken, that although it had been a while since he'd found his family, his family was finally complete.
It was a brief kiss, lasting no more than five seconds, and when Sherlock pulled away (because it is Sherlock who pulls away) he instantly looked terrified. ‘Oh, god,’ John could hear him saying. ‘I didn’t- oh
Sherlock sniffed, and as he stared up at John, he saw that twelve year old boy who’d made sarcastic comments in French at him, and he loved him more for that. ‘Promise?’
God, it smelt like Sunday mornings snuggled in the duvet. It smelt like a warm bath in the winter. It smelt like his mum’s baking at Christmas- it smelt
‘A box,’ Tavvy repeated, looking annoyed. ‘Well, actually, Vi said we should look in the top of the wardrobe so I built a ladder of boxes and toys, and then I climbed up and found this.’ She held out the simple brown box and frowned. ‘I’ve never seen it before. Can I open it?’
‘Oh, John, I’m so happy for you.’ His mother sounded close to tears, and Sherlock grinned, imagining John in there, jaw working frantically, no words coming out.
James had been banished and had, as far as Sherlock was aware, never come back, retreating to Ireland and hiding. Sherlock had thought he would never see him again and he had been utterly heartbroken because he had adored James with all his heart, and suddenly he’d been betrayed, lied to and left in complete disgrace by the last person on Earth he would have thought would do those things to him.
‘Your father would be similarly upset,’ Morag snapped back, ‘to know that you hadn’t used his name. It’s disrespectful-‘
Sherlock had needed to text Lestrade about the case that he was working and his phone was out of charge. Jim didn't have his with him, Irene’s was with Molly and Mary guarded hers like a gold mine so Sherlock had stood up and shouted, ‘Stamford! Give me your phone!’
Sherlock took his seat next to John, smiling out at the hall. ‘Nearly time,’ he whispered, and John took his hand. ‘I know. And you’ll be great.’
Sherlock grinned evilly as he closed the door of his quarters. His quarters held a large bedroom, an ensuite bathroom, a sitting room, a small kitchen and stairs leading to a second bedroom he mostly used for storing his illegal chemistry kits.
’ She tossed her hair, grabbed John’s hand, placed it on her waist and then stood on her tiptoes and kissed him.
‘Hooray for Watson!’ Rebecca Scarborough said sarcastically, glaring at him out of the corner of her eye. Out of everyone in the bunk, Becca was the one person John honestly disliked, because she was the one who was constantly teasing him about Sholto and bitching about him. It wasn’t John's fault Sholto liked him so much and it wasn’t John's fault he was the golden boy of the squadron: it just so happened that he was the only one who consistently followed the rules. John had tried to tell Becca this, but she was having none of it. John had met people like her before, and he knew he needed to stay away from her, because if he was provoked enough he would snap and if he snapped he would be punished and if he was punished he'd be out here for even longer, which he didn't want. Not at all.
But at the same time, it’s exactly the right moment, because everyone needs some to tell them it’s okay, that they’re not broken, and for Sherlock Holmes that has always been John Watson-
Mrs Hudson was walking down the corridor. When she saw Sherlock she wagged her finger at him disapprovingly and said, ‘why did John come in less than an hour ago smelling like a pub and muttering about good-for-nothing-royals?’
At this point John still hadn't realised what was happening. Maybe it was because he was overwhelmed, maybe it was because he was just stupid, but John still hadn't connected the dots when Sherlock finally turned around and met his eye. In that gaze, John saw a dozen different emotions: joy, fear, apprehension, sadness and so many more, and as John watched, Sherlock seemed to mouth sorry before he turned back to face the huge room of people.
As if reading his mind, Harry said, ‘he sounded like a cunt from what Johnny told us. Right, Johnny?’
‘Why is he changing names?’ Charlie said, tossing her long blonde hair behind her and glaring at her older brother. They were just a year apart, and whilst they were often best friends, they were also regularly worst enemies.
Greg looked shifty; he refused to make eye contact, instead fussing over his daughter. ‘A few months ago, maybe April or May, I was asleep in the nursery and Sherlock came in. I wasn’t awake then,’ he added hastily.
‘My father can’t keep it in his pants.’ Sherlock’s stretched out on the bed, hands behind his head. John laughs. ‘What do you mean?’
Quite a collection.’ He watched the waiter closely, expecting a whitening of the face, or a clench of the jaw, or even a punch in the face (it had happened before- Sebastian Wilkes had almost broken his nose).
Sherlock was reduced to a crying mess in John’s arms and John couldn't let Sherlock continue like that- he
There’s nothing to say, not now. Less to say than there was before, when he hadn’t seen the video, when he hadn’t come to his rescue, when they’d been broken and unfixable. Less to say than there ever has before, but maybe more, as well, because Sherlock can’t help but feel that John wants to say something-
‘Thank you, Irene.’ Sherlock said, nodding at her. She waved at Jacob, ruffled Christopher’s hair (the boy scowled) and walked out of the room.
John and Jenny simultaneously gasped. Siger nodded, and John was shocked to see tears pricking his eyes. ‘It’s- it’s not good.’
They sat in silence, staring over the duck pond, hands interlinked, and John decided to ignore whatever he was getting mixed up with, and just go with the flow.
His nose nuzzled in John’s pubic hair, Sherlock sucked John’s dick as hard as he could, fondling his balls, staring up at him all the while. John collapsed back on the pillow, bucking into Sherlock’s mouth as he gasped, ‘Jesus, Sherlock, just like that, god, keep going-‘
Sherlock slammed the door, and John was left staring at the younger boy through the glass, watching him lean against the counter and slam his head against the hard wood, before he left.
a distraction. ‘Fine. Hamish. Come with me. I’ll speak up for you, if you get in trouble.’ He didn’t say how he would do it, but he didn’t need to- the waiter, Hamish, clearly believed him.
Now they’re kissing again, holding each other so close that they are two halves of one whole, an end and a beginning, a gift and a curse all mixed up together. They are John Watson and Sherlock Holmes and, Sherlock thinks giddily, he’s finally where he was destined to be.
Had he never told John he was gay? Of course he had. Why wouldn’t he? He wasn’t ashamed of it, after all, and he was closer to John than he was with anyone. John must know. John surely knew…
He would see Sherlock soon, he told himself as he buttoned up his shirt. Just six months. Six more months, and they’d be together.
The smile crept back onto John’s face despite himself, and he shook his head. ‘You might be a complete stranger, but you’re a complete liability, Sherlock Holmes.’
John watched Sherlock and knew that he would never be able to look at the moon again without thinking about Sherlock.
Sherlock smiled back at her, remembering he had to be polite to John’s family, however weird they were acting. ‘Ok…nice to see you, Molly.’
‘Carry on,’ John interrupts, and Sherlock’s heart begins to race. He doesn’t look angry, or upset: in fact…
Sherlock snorted. ‘That will never work. I don’t want to be refused, and the only way to avoid being refused is to make it as big and as grand as impressive as ever.’
‘To the public, she is referred to as the King mother, Charlotte Elizabeth Margaret,' Sherlock said dramatically. 'To my father, Uncles and Aunt, she's Mummy. To my siblings and cousins, she’s Granny. To me, she's Charlie.'
‘John!’ Sherlock whipped around as quickly as possible and jumped to his feet (because that’s not at all suspicious, his brain whispered), smoothing down his jacket. ‘I thought you’d-‘
‘There is no way,’ Anderson continued, breathing heavily as a vein throbbed in his forehead, ‘that he would say yes because you’re a fucked-up little
Molly’s younger brothers, Callum and Henry, offered to do the washing up for twenty quid; Sherlock gladly handed over the money and whisked Molly into the living room. They were doing a joint project for their A level English coursework and Sherlock knew Molly couldn't do it all on their own; if they did it as quickly as possible he wouldn't have to constantly pester Molly to get it done.
‘Whose are you, Sherlock?’ James growled as he pounded ruthlessly into the younger boy. Sherlock’s eyes were rolling in the back of his head and even as the sane part of his mind shouted body’s just transport, body’s transport, the part overtaken by feeling screamed never stop him, Sherlock. This is what you were born to do-
John loved Sherlock, more than anything, but his boyfriend acted like a spoilt four year old sometimes (many, including Mycroft, would have preferred
‘Right.’ John said. He hadn’t thought Sherlock had ever dated anyone before, but it was still nice to know, even if he was looking oddly suspicious. Maybe it was just the question: Sherlock hated questions. ‘Right,’ he had said in a businesslike manner. ‘Good.’ Then, before Sherlock could reply, he had closed his eyes and put his mouth on his boyfriend’s dick.
‘Indeed.’ Sherlock shot a worried look at John, who was smiling for some reason. Did he not agree that Molly was clearly in need of medical attention? She looked like she was going to faint. ‘I have some brilliant experiments set up at the palace, would you like to come and see them, someday?’
An eternity (or half an hour) later they pulled up outside Bart’s. Sherlock tossed a wad of cash at the cabby, not even pausing to accept the change, before sprinting into the building. ‘John!’ He shouted as he ran. ‘Come! Let’s go!’ He paused, looking back, Rosie by his side. ‘
carbon buckyballs and other degree-level information) and his chemistry teacher couldn't stop him anyway.
Irene was talking, but Sherlock was looking at him, his eyes dancing along his face, dipping lower, then back up, front teeth gently biting his plush lower lip, and John wondered what it would be like to bite that full lip himself, gently stroking it with his tongue-
‘Noted.’ John murmured. Sherlock stopped at the guard post and grinned at the person inside. ‘Mike. Please inform my father I’ve returned, and tell him I have a…’ Sherlock glanced at John, who smiled back at him and finished quietly, ‘friend.’
‘Of your imminent Kinghood? No.’ Mycroft replied snidely. ‘Of father’s blatant favouritism of you? I wouldn't say jealous was the right word, but if you like.’
John didn’t blame Mycroft at all. He realised that his boyfriend’s older brother had acted out of fear for the safety of his favourite sibling, and had told Mycroft this when Sherlock had stormed out of the room, sulking. Sherlock, John had explained, was partially angry at having been caught snogging a male peasant and partially embarrassed that Mycroft had caught him displaying such an obvious share of affection.
enough?’ Sherlock had been saying since John had come back, almost four weeks ago, that he was different. He wouldn't engage in activities viewed as
Sherlock didn’t reply, stopping in front of the final pair of doors down the long corridor. They weren’t particularly ornate, at least compared to most other doors in the palace, simple mahogany crested with gold leaf, but behind them…
And then, in a gesture as old as time and yet absolutely brand new, all at the same time, Sherlock dropped to one knee.
The Archbishop placed the crown on his head and Sherlock didn't even feel the weight of fifteen generations of Holmes rulers on his head: all he could feel was the weight of his heart, beating once more in his chest, as he stole a look at John.
People usually thought they were in a relationship and neither Jim or Sherlock ever corrected them because, in a way, they were in a relationship. They knew everything about each other, they were best friends and Jim was more than a little keen to kiss Sherlock, purely for experimental reasons. That wouldn't happen now, though, because Sherlock was desperately in love with John Watson and would do nothing to jeopardise that. His probability of ever becoming John Watson’s significant other was approximately 2.34% (though the probability of John kissing him was a higher 8.7%, with it increasing even higher to 11.1% when John was drunk) and Sherlock was doing everything in his power to accomplish this.
It’s not okay. No part of their situation is okay, and both of them know that, but he repeats it over and over as he walks to John, stops in front of John, and then pulls John towards him. ‘It’s okay, John, it’s okay,’ he says, over and over, because he knows how it feels to want forgiveness so badly it tears up your soul. ‘It’s okay.’
Irene laughed. ‘Sorry, Sherlock. You’re not my type, and I don't make a habit of pissing off the royal family.’
Technically, Trisha and Archie should have swapped, but William refused to allow this; he insisted his wife should be next to him.
‘Dwelling?’ John repeated, a smile breaking out on his face despite the fact his brain wasn’t functioning properly. ‘Who says dwelling?’
Sherlock had done a horrible thing with a horrible person, and that had been, in John's mind, utterly unforgivable. But when John reviewed it, several months after, he realised that Sherlock clearly hadn’t been planning to have sex with him; there was obviously some deep history with James Moriarty that John hadn’t even stayed to listen too. Originally, John had thought Sherlock had invited Jim there that day, that he had been planning on having sex with him, that he was having a sordid affair, but when he truly thought about it a week later he realised that he couldn’t have done; Jim had greeted Sherlock like he hadn’t seen him for a long, long time. John had stormed off in the first place, over reacting completely when he found out that Sherlock had had sex before him. Why did that even matter? They had loved each other. Why had John been so bothered by that?
‘We’ll go in a second,’ he replied, and then he reached up with both hands to pull Sherlock down to his height and kiss him, kiss him in the middle of the street in the middle of a parade in the middle of the most important moment of his life, so far. John Watson kissed Sherlock Holmes and nobody cared, except for the only two people who needed to care.
John shoots a man less than an hour after he fucks Sherlock outside their flat and he’s ready to do it all over again, because the adrenalin is so much better than anything he’s ever experienced before. He’s found his fix and he
Morag rolled her eyes and glared at him. ‘Your father would be outraged,’ she spat. ‘Outraged to know that you hadn’t risen to met the role of King as he did. You’re going to send this country to the pits, William-‘
‘About five foot five, sandy blond hair in a floppy haircut, blue eyes, short nose, probably wearing a horrific jumper and possibly with a girl.’ Mike rattled off. ‘Better get off, Sherlock. The Witch is coming.’
And then they were kissing again, Sherlock's hands clasped around John's face and John's around Sherlock's because Sherlock knew that if he let go John would fade away from him again and he couldn't do that, he couldn't, he couldn't, kissing frantically, as if they would die if they stopped, as if this was the end of the world and these were the last moments that the two of them would spend together-
‘Technically,’ Mycroft drawled from the corner, ‘either polo or ballet are the sport of our current King.’
‘Not gay.’ John said for what seemed like the hundredth time that week. His parents were desperate to reassure their younger child that being a homosexual was completely acceptable, because they hadn’t with Harry, and she had become so stressed with the thought they would hate her she had turned to alcohol, and look where she was now.
Sherlock grinned at John and ushered him forwards. ‘Thanks, Mike!’ He called as he walked confidently up the path, deep into the private grounds.
‘Not for much longer,’ Morag said, an unstable smile on her face and John realised that Sherlock was right; this woman was clearly insane. ‘You will kill yourself. Like mother like son.’ She laughed. ‘I will rule as consort for Archie. When he’s old enough the people will ask me to stay on, as they did with Charlotte; I will graciously accept.’
Sherlock was even paler than usual and John could see him shaking, even though they were several feet apart. ‘You bitch-‘
Sherlock couldn’t speak. He couldn’t understand why this boy, this brave, good, boy, would ever want to engage in a relationship with him, with the screwed-up, emotionally absent Prince, but if John was foolish enough to want to, Sherlock would never, ever stop him.
was from the playground: Jamie Nickson, one of the bullies, taunting little Billy Prescott because he’d been reading a book under a tree instead of playing football.
‘Thank you for coming.’ Sherlock turned back to the crowd, addressing the square. ‘Thank you for giving us privacy in the last few days.’
‘I think the note would really work.’ Lestrade carefully covered the body’s face again and resumed his crouch next to Sherlock. ‘What would you write, though?’
his by. His son, his daughter, their children, their spouses, all people that Sherlock would have loved but never got the chance to, but it doesn't matter because they exist and they let him celebrate Sherlock.
John nodded and Sherlock stood up, crawling onto the bed, and put his arm around John’s neck. John snuggled into him and Sherlock’s head drooped, resting on top of John’s.
There was no point resisting, not anymore. Sherlock just sat on the bed as John packed his bag. He watched as John put away his Macbook and his blog forever: he watched as John took his files out of the cabinet: he watched as John collected up his plates, his knives, his forks.
‘Imagine living like that, John.’ His mother gushed as the presenter showed the pictures of the Palace. ‘Those boys are the luckiest children in the world.’ John nodded and looked enviously at the screen. They had it all; everything they’d ever need, servants, excellent food, education, money, power and fame.
John just stared at him incredulously. ‘This is in no way your fault. I was shot, for Christ’s sake, in the desert, by the people I’m fighting. You were in no way involved, love.’
John names him Nathaniel Sherlock Watson-Holmes. The name was one of Sherlock’s choices, and it’s just about pretentious enough that it fits in with the rest of the Holmes family’s monickers. His middle name should be Thomas, which is John’s choice, but he can’t bear not to have Sherlock’s name live on somehow. Sherlock’s mother, Violet, is especially pleased, and it is clear from the moment she first holds him that her grandson will fill the hole in her heart that her son once filled.
Sherlock always came round in the end, though. He’d apologise, over and over, looking so sad, and it would end up with John sitting with him on the bed, stroking his hair and murmuring that of course he wasn’t upset, of course he still loved Sherlock, of course he would never leave him, though why the Prince needed reassurance of this John was clueless. Wasn't it obvious that John’s heart belonged entirely to Sherlock? For such a powerful, dominant man, Sherlock seemed incredibly anxious about John’s possibly wandering eye and John didn't know if he would ever be able to teach Sherlock how to properly, completely, trust him. Sherlock had been hurt massively, that was very obvious to John, and although he had suspicions over what had caused his boyfriend’s blatant distrust John would never say anything, lest it hurt Sherlock to talk about it.
He also called Mrs Hudson, who had been his nanny for most of his life. He had asked if he could stay with her, but she was currently in the North nursing her frail sister, and likely wouldn’t be back until after Sherlock which was incredibly inconvenient, but unavoidable.
in school since their A levels had finished, most people were just coming in to get extra info on the Uni courses they were doing (this meant that Sherlock had spent most of the last three weeks sitting in the Chemistry classroom with Jim and three other students learning about the absolutely
They’d been so happy, in those ten years between Mary’s death and then Sherlock’s, and even after all this time he still misses him every single day.
John wasn’t shaking. John wasn't crying, or hyperventilating, or shouting. John was just packing, calm, collected, folding his trousers the way he’d learned in the army (Sherlock complained, but he secretly liked having all of his clothes folded: it made him feel cared for, protected). The only clue that he wasn't just packing for a holiday was in his hands, clenched so tightly the veins were standing out, and his tight, tensed mouth.
Once he’d been to the hospital and had his left hand wrapped for burns, Sherlock went home and sadly crossed idea 3, cookies, off his list. He’d have to think of something else.
Harry muttered something under her breath, still smiling evilly, and Jenny shot her an angry glare. ‘Text me, John, so I know you’re alright. You’re welcome to stay out for as long as you want.’ Sherlock suspected that Jenny Watson didn't usually say this to John, who’s eyebrows had gone all the way up, but for once he didn't mind the special treatment. Anything that meant he had more time with John, really.
As Sherlock hugged his grandmother he realised that Morag was in the entrance hall, glaring at him (as usual). As Sherlock let her go, Morag stormed towards them and said loudly, ‘apologies for the state of dress William is in, your majesty. He was instructed to be here promptly but didn’t listen-‘
With a sigh, he turned back to the room, only to find John had moved so they were standing close together, merely a foot apart. The older man was a lot smaller than he’d previously thought, standing at maybe five foot six inches. ‘You seemed taller before,’ Sherlock said, before he could think what he was saying.
‘Were you and him ever a thing?’ John asked, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, even though John couldn't even see him. ‘No, John. Never. I think…maybe if you hadn’t-‘ he stopped himself just in time and coughed. ‘No. I don't feel that way towards James Moriarty.’
Janine rolled her eyes as two other children, a small girl and a plump boy, sat down next to her. ‘Well. Miracles happen.’
‘My God,’ he gasped, and John tilted his head back as he came as well, shuddering against Sherlock as he braced himself on the back of the chair.
‘Ok,’ John had said, sprawled across the red chair that Sherlock privately referred to as ‘John’s chair’ in his mind palace. ‘Tell me something you’ve never told anyone else.’
Sherlock clambered over him, laying in the bed and pulling the covers over himself. ‘Thank you, Mr Watson. And I you.’
, but he was staring at Sherlock with the deepest relief Sherlock had ever seen on another human being’s face.
It’s like that with almost everyone. Mrs Hudson, Lizzie, even Mycroft, who actually cries as he holds his nephew. Nathaniel looks very like Sherlock, with the dark curls and blue/green eyes (
Sherlock glanced back at John, a look of apology in his eyes and said, ‘I lied. That is true. But I lied because I knew I couldn’t ever just be who I am, in this family. I wanted to remain under the radar, I didn’t want to be looked at like a freak, I didn’t want to be accused of being inhumane, so I lied. I said I was normal, heterosexual, and I was planning on keeping the facade for the rest of my life, but when I met John…’ Sherlock turned around and smiled at John so sweetly it melted his heart. ‘I knew I couldn't do that. And so I gave in to my so-called ‘unnatural’ urges and I have never been happier.’
You could have heard a pin drop. John was stock-still, staring in shock at James, who was still looking at Sherlock, who opened his eyes and stared back at him, at that hateful, evil, psychopathic boy who he had once, loved with all his heart, and yet even now, as Jim brought down his and John’s relationship, the best thing that had ever happened to him, Sherlock couldn't hate him. Still.
He was in Cambridge for his second year as part of the University’s ‘scientific exchange’, a brand-new programme aimed at giving science students at Unis of a ‘lower standing’ to Cambridge a chance to participate in the ‘Cambridge experience’. John had been picked (he hadn’t even applied, they’d literally just told him to go) and basically told ‘go or leave’.
The image of Sherlock, five year old Sherlock, sitting next to his dead mother, watching her, patiently waiting for her to wake up, burned in John’s mind; he shuddered.
Mycroft took his hand and shook it once. ‘A pleasure, brother mine. Now go. John Watson will be waiting.’
'You won't send me away,' John said suddenly, lips still touching Sherlock's, foreheads together, and Sherlock laughed because the idea of him actively sending John away was just stupid, ridiculous, idiotic. 'I am never letting you go, John Watson,' he whispered. 'Not for as long as I live.'
'Honestly, John, I know how hard this must be for you.' A single tear escaped her left eye and she wiped it away fiercely.
Sherlock looked up at him and finally, finally John knew why his eyes were so sad. He had carried around the secrets of his mother’s death for almost twenty years and he had lived all of that believing that it was his fault.
It’s always full, nowadays. It used to be quiet, but the current occupants are well-known, particularly around these parts. One is a best-selling author of crime thrillers, the other a consulting detective with an international reputation who acts as inspiration for said crime thrillers.
He told of two boys who had met when they were aged fifteen and seventeen, in a dark summer three years before. They were both alone; they were bought together by their shared brilliance. One didn’t see the darkness in the other, one saw the darkness present and made it his goal to manipulate it until it was all that you could see.
‘How-‘ John started. Sherlock sighed again. ‘You sit straight, wear comfortable clothes; you don’t need to dress up to be confident. However you have done your hair, trying to conform to social norms. Mike mentioned you were probably with a woman earlier; clearly you spend a lot of time with them; ladies man. Brother is easy; look at the phone. Harry Watson, engraved on the back, scratches round the charger show alcoholic. That was a shot in the dark, a good one though. History, PE, Chemistry and Biology are less clear; you’re athletic, that one was a guess. History; you mentioned a project on the Royal family. That is a module in the AS and A2 A level on the monarchy of our country. Finally, Biology and Chemistry; you have words on your right hand, which also shows you are left handed, that are related to the A2 and University course. Plasmid, Iuropen, and Traphodyl are all part of the medicine course which requires Chemistry and Biology. Armed forces; PE is a requirement, why else would you do it? The female best friend was a bit of a cheat, Mike sometimes mentions his friend Molly and I assumed you were also close; you’re also wearing a hideous sweater that either your mother or a good female friend of yours picked out. There.’
‘So Harry texted me this joke,’ John was saying. ‘And usually they’re stupid, right? But this one-‘ he snorted, and Rosie huffed as the spoon jerked away from her mouth. ‘This one was: what did the beaver say when he slipped on water?’
John resisted the urge to smirk and Greg laughed out loud, fondly ruffling his god-daughter’s hair. ‘Rosamund Watson, you are a liability.’
Hamish laughed, a harsh, dark laugh that made Sherlock raise an eyebrow at him. ‘What about my statement do you find so humorous?’
Mycroft rolled his eyes and stood up. ‘Fine. If you won’t take my advice, Sherlock, then I think you should listen to what almost all of your friends have told you and just
Someone (who, Sherlock had no idea) had pasted tiny little glow-in-the-dark stars across the ceiling. The sun had gone down just a few minutes previously and they were the only thing lighting up the room; Sherlock could hardly see John’s face, let alone anyone else’s.
Irene finally turned away from the screen and looked at Sherlock. ‘He’s certainly got a bee in his bonnet,’ she smirked.
He has three months, he estimates. He used to be a doctor (a good one, too) and he thinks he’s about right with his guess. He doesn't tell anyone until he has about a month left, knowing it will upset them, and even then only tells Lizzie and Nathaniel. Everyone else who would care is long dead- Mycroft, Harriet, Mike.
Mycroft nodded thoughtfully before smiling and saying quietly, 'I wish you a happy coronation day, your Majesty. Congratulations.'
And now Victor, staring at him with such hope in his eyes. The younger man has given up so much already for their secret love: his family, his home, his reputation, and yet Sherlock cannot bring himself to say those three little words. He doesn’t know what that sort of love is, and he hasn’t for a long time: possibly ever, even. Had Francis been a love, or a lover? Had James been a love, or a drug?
He pulled out the chair next to Mike and smiled at the new boy, who had amazingly twinkling eyes. ‘I don’t believe we’ve been introduced,’ he said smoothly. ‘Sherlock Holmes.’
‘Yeah.’ Greg confirmed. ‘Straight after. In all the newspapers I remembered from before, he was happy, smiley, a normal kid, you know?’
‘Johnny? Yes, Johnny was with Mike. He’s been here for ages, Sher.’ Jim stood up and offered his hand to Sebby nonchalantly. ‘Care to dance, Sebby?’
Queen Charlotte was legend all over the world. Her husband, Sherlock’s grandfather, King Henry III, had died at the age of just thirty from a sudden heart attack in the middle of the nineteen seventies. Charlotte had been left with four young children; Sherlock’s father, William, was the eldest at just nine; his younger brother, Richard, was seven, the only girl, Eleanor, was five and the youngest, Zachariah, was not yet one.
touching, the way they looked and touched one another. The day before Irene had actually kissed Sherlock on the
‘Are you saying you like me more than your own brother? You’ve only known me half an hour,’ John said, amazed. Sherlock nodded. ‘Oh, yes. I hate Mycroft.’
He waves the memory stick, waiting to see him, this man he’s been thinking about, waiting for, and finally found-
They had driven the rest of the way to the palace in empty silence, John wondering why Sherlock had sent these men to get him and whether something horrible had happened. Had Sherlock been injured? Had the royal family been in some way affected by Sherlock and John’s friendship/secret relationship? Had Sherlock been killed?
Arthur is visiting the cemetery to pay his respects to his dead grandad when he finds the letter. It’s on a grave that he comes to often: the man who is buried there has a funny name (
before they were gone, and John was just staring at him, and Sherlock was just staring back, and then John made a choking sound in the back of his throat and ran, ran away from Sherlock.
were indestructible as well as immortal. I didn’t know (I’ve healed gunshot wounds, stab wounds and grown back a finger but was not sure if a deadly shot to the head or heart could be recovered from) and was in no way willing to test the theory with my only child. So I bargained: I fought in the wars, and Felix stayed home. He was so young in 1914, only thirty, thirty-one, and barely grasping the concept of eternity. I did what I had to do.’
He’s said something, but he doesn’t know what because his senses are blurring together, into truth and lies, right and wrong, friend and foe, Watson and Moriarty.
And John opened the door, stepping in and leaving Sherlock on the doorstep, wondering how John could be so clueless yet so aware at the same time.
Jim didn't mention it again until the end of the lesson, when, as Sherlock packed up their equipment and his friend sullenly watched, jacket still smoking, he said, ‘or, you know, you could just ask him.’
‘I need Rosie, I have some ideas to bounce off her.’ Sherlock tapped his foot against the floor impatiently, and held out his arms for his favourite little Watson. ‘Rosie! Come to Sherlock!’
‘I’m not your sloppy seconds, Irene Adler,’ Janine snapped. Irene simply raised one eyebrow and held out her hand: Janine hesitated before taking it and following Irene out of the bushes.
‘Thank you,’ Sherlock said. John looked at him in surprise; Sherlock hadn’t said a word since the roof, but now he was talking to Mycroft. He couldn’t pretend that didn’t hurt a little. ‘Thank you.’
John laughed through the tears and reached his hand around, threading it through Sherlock’s eye. ‘Nothing, love,’ he said through the tears.
‘Sherlock-‘ Victor throws his head back, and Sherlock bites hard on the soft, white skin of the other man’s neck. ‘You need to be quieter.’
Every single time John went in for an interview, the first thing they said was ‘Oh! A bond mark! Looks like a lucky someone’s found their soulmate!’
Sherlock was sitting at the top of the slide and even in the dark John was astounded by his appearance. Sherlock had never been fat, never had even a tiny bit of puppy fat, even when they were twelve, but he was so thin now that the biologist in John was worried every time he looked at him. His eyes had lost their sparkle, his clothes were all too big, and his face was so sallow and bony that John thought it would hurt to touch him.
‘Anyone who has ever spoken to me will know that I deduce people. Usually at first encounter, I will tell them their life story, their family, their job, secrets-‘ he paused. ‘Sorry about that. When I met John, it was no exception. I deduced him, after he asked me if I wanted more wine, but instead of gasping or punching me or just walking away, as most of you did, he ignored me.’ On seeing the quizzical looks, he chucked slightly. ‘I know. Most of you would assume I would just move on, seek out the next victim.’ He smiled at John, who had tears in his eyes as he remembered their first encounter. ‘But I didn’t. Maybe that’s what I was looking for all along- someone who would see past my, um, dickness-‘ they laughed and looked at John, ‘and find the real me.’
John burst out laughing. ‘I bet King William paid her to marry him. She’s, what, twenty-seven, and beautiful.’
'I know I'm probably too late,' John continued. 'I know that I waited too long, that I didn't listen. I know that what happened that day was partially my fault. But- Sherlock. I've come back because I can't live without you, and I want to be with you, and I love you. I love you more than anything, I love you completely, I love you.'
John was talking about his A level exams, and Sherlock was just watching him with that look he got when he was actually, really happy. His eyes became lighter, crinkles formed around them and his mouth slid into a half-smile: it warmed John’s heart to know that he was the one who produced that look in Sherlock’s eyes.
‘You’re so childish,’ Mycroft snapped. ‘Anthea, please tidy away this vase. It’s quite disturbing the zen of the room.’ The moment the words were out of his mouth he looked horrified: Sherlock was almost pissing himself laughing. ‘The
All he could concentrate on was John, John standing up there, John here, now, and he wanted to drop everything, run up there and kiss John and say
John is still crying against his dressing gown, and Sherlock cups his head and carries on talking. ‘It’s okay, John.’
‘We’ll go through, Sherlock.’ Siger nodded at John, and led Violet, who was watching John with an amazed look in her eyes, away, glancing back once before facing forwards.
William turned to his advisor, eyes flashing in the same way Sherlock’s did when he was really, really pissed. ‘You are an advisor, Morag. That is all. The decisions are left to me. Do not forget that.’
For the first time in a long time, Sherlock feels that spark of anger, deep in his chest. ‘You’re doing yourself a disservice, John, I can safely say-‘
They sat by the window, and Sherlock made John a cup of coffee and brought a piece of chocolate cake, which he
And John was coming, biting the pillow to try and avoid his parents hearing, and Sherlock was still licking his dick, swallowing his come, gently rubbing his sensitive balls as they emptied into his mouth.
‘Not gay,’ John whispered, his nose gently brushing Sherlock’s, ‘bi. Though I don't like the labels. I mean, I've liked boys, and I've liked girls, and gender isn't an issue for me, but right now, Sherlock, I am gay as
John suddenly looked all shiny, his mouth stretched in a weird way. It took Sherlock a moment to realise this was happiness, and Sherlock felt a jolt in his stomach as he realised that he was responsible for this look on John’s face, he had made him happy, he was the one that made John look like that, him and only him.
Sherlock closed his eyes tight. When he opened them John was looking at him again, eyes almost shut, angrier than Sherlock had ever seen him before.
Sarah was still talking so John tuned back in, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. Instead he smiled as honestly as he could, taking her hand. He’d known from the moment he’d met Sarah that she wasn’t his soulmate: you weren’t meant to know, but John was sure that he would. His soulmate would be obvious.
He goes home that night, ready to tell Mary that it’s over, that he’s in love with Sherlock, that he wants the children and then he’s leaving, but the flat is silent. He checks all the bedrooms and finds nothing: frowning, he walks into the kitchen.
‘Compared with everything else that’s happened today, it’s cake.’ John replied. Sherlock laughed, the laugh that he reserved just for John, hearty and real, and it made John laugh too until they were in hysterics, just feet from the balcony where Sherlock would be making an announcement that had seemed, this morning, impossible.
He watched as John opened his mouth, try to think of something to say, and close it again when he realised that nothing could be said to make this, the end of them, any better. He watched John go down the stairs, watched the door close and watched John walk away forever.
John was giggling to himself, looking out the window, clearly thinking about Sherlock’s insane grandmother. She was eighty-one years old, but as healthy as her son, Sherlock’s father, and looked almost as young. She was rude and patronising and hadn’t really accepted that it wasn’t the 1960’s anymore, but she was also the funnest, most interesting person in Sherlock’s family.
He wanted to pull away, he truly did, because he loved John, but he still loved James, of course he did, and that was what stopped him from pulling away like any decent human being. James was intoxicating, like the heroin he had been addicted to for the entire year he and James had been…together? In a relationship? Sherlock didn’t know and Sherlock didn't care anymore. All he knew, now was that his boyfriend could walk in at any time and he was kissing the boy who had caused the deaths of ninety-three people, probably more, hurt his family, hurt him, and he was loving it.
‘On Monday, and he’ll be delighted that I made the effort. And they’ll be beautiful. I mean, I made them.’
You gave up any right to see or speak to your children when you left us that night and never came back, never even made an effort to see any of us.’
‘Is Lestrade at your house now?’ Sherlock asked brightly. His chemistry was annoying him and he was definitely in the mood to solve a murder. ‘I have some theories for an absolutely delicious shooting that happened last Friday and am eager to have someone to talk to them about with.’
‘How do you see me?’ Sherlock murmured. John was looking at him, eyes flicking over his face like he was attempting to deduce him-
to find out what it is. The entire summer between school ending and Uni starting he looks for it, doing everything he can to itch the scratch he can’t get rid of, but it seems pointless. John doesn't know
John, who was examining the corpse on the floor, looked up at the profanity and raised an eyebrow at his partner. ‘That’s not like you, Sherlock. You usually reserve swears for Mycroft and particularly juicy serial killers.’
‘Sherlock,’ John moaned from under the covers, and Sherlock turned to look at him. ‘John?  Are you-‘
Sherlock dropped John’s hand abruptly and turned, stalking out of the room, mortified. Poor John, standing there with Sherlock clutching his hand, too polite to snatch it back. God, what was Sherlock’s problem? He never allowed emotion to manifest in this way, ever. He had blocked out romantic attachment since the James incident against anyone who could be a possible partner: why now, a year and a half later, was his brain betraying him?
A murmur went up around the crowd; most of them had expected Sherlock to take his father’s name, which was stupid, because Sherlock had never been one for tradition and
John gave it to Henry, who frowned. ‘Look how it’s addressed,’ he said, puzzled. ‘It’s addressed to the subjects of the King and his allies.’
‘Do you realise you swear when you’re angry?’ Irene said, still sitting on the bed. John pointed at her and said, ‘I swear to god if you say another word-‘
‘It is a problem,’ Irene snapped, chucking her shoe across the room, ‘Because she doesn't like me back.’
John can see his shock in his face, he knows he can, because he laughs, a dry, broken laugh from dry, broken lips. ‘Texting. Just texting, but I wanted more.’
John instinctively leapt behind an overturned cart; Becca did the same. John looked up, still hiding, and caught sight of Isaac, hiding inside a hut. Smith was screaming, pointing at the ground, and John's heart leapt as he caught sight of Hunter, staring at the sky, and John honestly couldn't tell if he was alive or dead.
Sherlock talked about a little boy who had cried himself to sleep every night for eight months, huddled in the blankets as Miss Brook snored next door. A little boy who was told he was worthless, useless, stupid and a curse on the world, a boy who was told that anyone he loved would die and it would always, always be his fault.
‘Beautiful, aren't they?’ Sherlock murmured, and John looked at his friend in shock. ‘You don't like any of this stuff, Sher. You didn't even know the Earth went round the sun: you think it’s stupid.’
‘Bah.’ Sherlock waved his hands. ‘Half of the whole ruling thing is boring. I’ll give you defence and the alliance strategies.’
‘What the hell am I meant to say to that?’ Sherlock groaned, hiding his face in his hands. Mycroft shrugged awkwardly and smiled. ‘I know we don’t often discuss feelings such as this, Sherlock, but you must agree with me. Especially since Sherrinford…left.’
John had been at home on a cold February evening, enjoying a quiet supper with his parents, when the doorbell had rung. Harry had got up (ungraciously) and gone to the door. John had heard her asking in a sulky tone who it was and rolled his eyes at her mother: Harry’s bad manners always made him laugh.
‘It’s just the fact that- that it wasn’t the entire familythat told us.’ Jenny sobbed. ‘I bet it was that stupid woman’s idea.’
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and darted from the room without a backwards glance, leaving John kneeling on the floor, totally alone.
‘Who says I’m not?’ Jim smirked, and for a moment Sherlock saw that blank look in his dark eyes. Most people couldn't see any emotion in Jim’s eyes; some (brave) people described him as empty, emotionless, psychotic. These people were wrong. Jim felt and Jim felt keenly, strongly, much more vividly than most ordinary people, just like Sherlock, he just hid it very, very well. It was one of the things Sherlock truly admired about him, usually, but sometimes…
He had been going out with Mary for nearly three months. She was clever, she was pretty, she made him laugh, and he had honestly thought she was the one that would finally make him forget Sherlock. She wanted him to forget Sherlock; she told him that constantly.
In a large bedroom, in a large palace, in a large kingdom, two boys smiled each other as a friendship as beautiful and fragile as the boy with the black hair was formed.
John pulled back and opened his eyes, scanning Sherlock’s face. Sherlock’s brain was short-circuiting. All he could think of was John.
Countless people call him a psychopath and John agrees with them: they’re right. He feels no guilt for what he was doing and he doesn't care about the pain he is inflicting: all that matters is the buzz. Nothing else, just that, and John will do whatever he has to do to reach it.
century, the war and the tension and the possibility of world destruction at all times. Sherlock can’t pretend that he wasn’t a little bit curious to see if he would survive a nuclear holocaust, but it never happened (or, as he’s quick to remind himself, it hasn’t happened yet).
John was the one that broke away, staring up at Sherlock, and then he kissed him, pulling the taller man down to meet his lips, gentle and soft.
Sherlock was sweating even more, despite his thin shirt with the sleeves rolled up. ‘Oh- yeah. Ok. We have fun together, right?’
and chuckles. ‘That was only a couple of months before you died, wasn't it? I know it’s been five years, Sherlock, but I can remember it so,
Suddenly, Sherlock’s whole world stopped. Mike Stamford’s words were lost; the slight breeze didn’t touch his skin; and everything,
‘You must have been with loads of people,’ John murmurs, and Sherlock shakes his head. ‘Apart from you, I’ve had an actual relationship with three others.’
Are you one of those poofters?’ A disgusted look crept onto his face.’ Urgh, you fancy me, don’t you?’
‘I need you,’ Sherlock whispers, and Victor nods. ‘I thought so.’ He smiles, a heartbreakingly happy smile, and brings his hand up to caress Sherlock’s cheek. ‘I can love for both of us.’
Sherlock wondered what he had done; was John unhappy? What had he said? Sherlock knew John hated his middle name, was he angry that Sherlock had used it? ‘What’s wrong?’ He asked, voice unsure. ‘What did I do-‘
Jim smirked and tapped the side of his nose. ‘That’s for me to know and you to try and find out, darling.’
Sherlock had smiled evilly and crouched down. He was naked, he was sweaty, his curls stuck to his forehead and his pupils were huge, and John had never seen anything so sexy in his entire life, and he’d once spent four days watching porn during the floods of 2015-
John didn’t stay in Trisha’s rooms any longer. He left Trisha trying to comfort Morag in her quarters and went upstairs, into Sherlock’s room, where he found his boyfriend crying. John had never seen him cry before; hell, he had barely seen Sherlock portray any emotion like that, despite the eyes that almost always seemed sad. His barricade had never come down enough for him to cry, and John had half-suspected that he would never see Sherlock express such deep and terrible emotion.
‘No, he’s not, and you know that.’ Mycroft straightened a picture on his desk and Sherlock instantly tapped it back. ‘Anyway, Mummy specifically told me that I have to keep you here until ten o’clock on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, otherwise you go home and, I quote,
‘Just Sherlock.’ Sherlock said adamantly. Henry’s smile widened. ‘Sherlock. It’s just, you have these stereotypes of the royal family, especially one as senior as you…’
And then he noticed that John was crying and his expression instantly changed. ‘John, what happened-‘
‘Ignore the paparazzi.’ Sherlock muttered as they approached the guard post. ‘Don’t look at them. If Morag sees a picture of me and a boy sneaking into the palace with a headline like Prince’s bumboy; is our future King a fag? She’ll freak.’
‘Can you talk?’ John asked, and he sounded oddly nervous and Sherlock was surprised that that didn't annoy him; in fact, it was almost endearing-
, 2010) and had remained in love with him through a year and a half of living together, two years of faking his own death, another two years of John being married, and now over a year of John’s wife being dead and John’s daughter being raised.
Captain Henry Watson had been home for three months out of the first ten years of John’s life, busy fighting that dratted war in the desert since John was three years old and before that at the training camps in southern France. John was incredibly proud of his father, always had been, but when Henry had returned full time when John was fourteen, it had been difficult for the boy, now a teenager, to adjust. John could barely remember him and he had got used to the house with just him, Harry and Jenny Watson, his mother. There had been friction, anger and eventually acceptance, and now Henry and John were inseparable.
Sherlock closed his eyes; John could see his eyeballs working furiously behind his lids and he prayed that Sherlock would realise that John was telling the truth. He prayed that Irene had been telling the truth and he prayed that Sherlock would realise that Jim was just manipulating him.
'Who the hell are they?' Harry said, looking at John, who shook his head in amazement. 'No idea. Literally. Never seen one before.'
Sherlock immediately advanced on James, too furiously angry to absorb that John had just fucking broken up with him, and Sherlock realised with a start that it was not just James who he was so fucking angry at, no, he was just as angry at John, John who had called him a psychopath, John who had stormed away, John who had no right to be angry at him, no right at all, because Sherlock hadn't done anything. He’d been a scared and confused kid, that was all, and John hadn't even listened to him, but John wasn't here, and Sherlock was going to take it all out on the man that had fucked up his life completely.
Sherlock ruffled his curls. ‘My God, this is atrocious.’ He took a deep breath. ‘Sorry. Continuing. We have the same friends-‘
He recognised them from pictures. William’s siblings, Eleanor, Richard and Zachariah; several others, including Victor’s father, Balthazar Trevor, and Tanya, a Duchess from the North, he also vaguely recalled.
‘Atta boy,’ John said, coming into the room. Charlie was trailing behind him, closely followed by her dog, Redbeard. They were wearing matching expressions of disgust and Sherlock had to resist laughing as Charlie looked at him, big blue eyes reproachful.
Mycroft was glaring at them. ‘Will you two behave seriously for once?’ He snapped. Sherlock ignored him completely, smiling down at John before lowering his head and kissing him once, briefly, on the lips. ‘Into battle,’ he joked, and John suddenly remembered Irene; was she still in the palace-
Their son is born looking so like Sherlock that John cannot even pretend that he is biologically John’s: that’s how he wanted it, how they both wanted it, though they both gave sperm samples to the hospital.  Lizzie was John’s, it was only fair, Sherlock had argued, that they evened up the playing field, and John can almost imagine Sherlock gazing at his son with an expression of the utmost joy and love and amazement. Sometimes, John can almost imagine Sherlock standing over his son and saying
It was nothing like that first drunken kiss, the one they’d exchanged when they were fifteen. It was
Sherlock bent his head close to John’s and whispered, ‘I can tell your life story just by looking at you.’
He picked up his phone and dialled Irene’s number. As soon as she picked up, he said giddily, ‘Irene. I need something to wear for Prom and it needs to be black. According to my date, it accentuates my cheekbones.’
John’s father walked in and sat next to his son. ‘Turn it on, John,’ he commanded, reaching for the popcorn John had in his lap.
John took a deep breath and tried to tell himself that he was being idiotic, that he was over Sherlock, that he had replaced Sherlock with Mary; why shouldn’t Sherlock move on? John had dumped Sherlock; Sherlock hadn’t dumped John.
‘I haven’t been here for a long time,’ John said quietly, remembering what his father had said. ‘I’d forgotten how happy they all sounded. I’d forgotten about the laughter. Why are they so happy?’
‘I need to get to Hunter!’ John said, trying to be calm, even though Hunter didn't even seem to be twitching anymore. ‘Can’t this wait?’ He tried to stand up but Becca grabbed his arm, pulling him down. ‘I won’t let you go until you answer me.’
So Sherlock swallowed his pride, buried his true self deep within him, and said loudly, ‘Of course not! Of course I’m not gay! I’m straight! One hundred percent straight!’
He knew this from the moment she walked in, and it was further consolidated when she walked up to him and he hadn’t been able to deduce her, which of course raised the question
Sherlock had had to think hard for that one. The gay thing was out of the question; he had told both Victor and Mycroft about that and had plans to tell no one else. He didn’t want to tell John everything that had occurred with James, or his mother’s funeral, but he didn’t want to lie, either. John had an uncanny knack for realising when he was lying.
Mycroft rolled his eyes but Sherlock could tell by the slight blush and pleased yet bemused half smile that Mycroft did want to talk about whoever the hell it was who had captured the heart of a man who Sherlock had been almost convinced was utterly asexual. ’Do you swear on John’s life never to tell anyone?’
Harry laughed; she liked Sherlock, John knew she did, and Sherlock liked her for some odd reason. ‘Oh yeah. Sorry, mate. Well. Don’t let me keep you.’
Henry chuckled. ‘Like half the girls in the country. Alright, son. Text your mother every couple of hours and keep your phone on. Is…is Harry alright?’
Maybe one day Sherlock would do all those things. But today, Sherlock just nodded and said, ‘yes, Sir.’
A mass of black curls shook, before a long, pale face looked up. ‘You found me. Took you long enough.’ He dropped his book and jumped to his feet with an agility that took John by surprise. ‘What do you want?’
Sherlock rounded the corner, and John Watson pushed him against the wall before reaching up and kissing him.
Sherlock tasted better, felt better, looked better than any of the girls he’s groped at the discos or hit on in town or even dated (Janette, for three weeks, and then Sarah for two months this year).
Sherlock talked about his mother for the first time in decades and John listened because that was what Sherlock needed, and John would do anything for Sherlock. Anything and everything, because that was what you did when you loved someone like John loved Sherlock, like Sherlock loved John; they were the centre of your world, and you would do anything to make sure they were happy.
They belong together, and it doesn't matter that John will break him, because for now they’re infinite.
‘Get yourself a friend.’ Sherlock suggested. Mycroft threw his head back, laughing. ‘I have no need for a goldfish, brother mine. Sentiment is a chemical defect, found on the losing side.’
‘You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do this,’ John managed to say, but Sherlock just made a disgruntled sound at the back of his throat and pressed John’s lips back against his. ‘Like you said,’ he mumbled against John’s lips, ‘
Sherlock grabbed James’ tie and pulled him close enough that he could count his eyelashes, close enough that he could see the specks of black in those deep, brown eyes.
There were so many questions that John wanted to ask Sherlock that he knew he never would. What had actually happened to his mother? Why did Sherlock look so sad when he thought John couldn't see him? What had really happened with James, the boy that John suspected had been very, very close to Sherlock at one point but ended up causing the deaths of over seven hundred people?
could have gone better. Their entire group was reunited, and for some reason (maybe because they were all older and mature, maybe because Sherlock and John’s calm and happy vibe affected the rest of them) everything was totally peaceful. Irene wasn't even bothered when Janine announced she was in love with a boy called Callum from home: Sherlock said that she and Molly, who had been at the resort since early June, had been getting closer and closer. Mike had a girlfriend, a sweet French girl from a small village near the resort called Claudette, and spent half his time talking to her and half his time talking about her, and Sherlock and John were
‘I think it is,’ Violet said, and Sherlock made a small choking sound in his throat. ‘What is he doing here, Sherlock?’
Suddenly, there were a pair of strong hands on his shoulders and a head pressed against his shoulder. ‘Deep breaths,’ a voice he knew almost as well as his own whispered, ‘Deep breaths, John. Je t'ai. Je t'ai eu. Je suis avec vous, John.’
Sherlock didn’t laugh. He stood up and glared at Mycroft, scowling at him as he said, ‘he’s right, you know. It’s fucking ridiculous.’ Then he too stood and stormed away.
‘I have known that I was a homosexual since I was in my early teens,’ Sherlock said calmly, ignoring the exclamations from below. ‘I have rarely shown interest in women and whilst I am sorry to have hidden this from you, I didn’t think the time was right. If I am totally honest, I have been scared. Scared that I will be judged, scared that I will be mocked, scared that my kingdom will disown me, but I don’t want to hide anymore. I want to think that we have progressed enough as a society that I won’t be judged, mocked or disowned. I want to think that my people will be loyal to me whatever sexuality I am. Most of all, I don’t want to keep my relationship with John Watson a secret anymore because I love him, and I want a family with him, and I want to grow old with him, and I want you all to know that I love him and I want a family with him and I want to grow old with him.’ Sherlock paused and licked his lips, looking down at the still-quiet crowd. ‘John has helped me become brave enough to tell you all this, and I beg you to please, please accept me for who I am. If it bothers you that much to have a homosexual King, I will step down and give the throne to my younger brother, but this will truly be a last resort. I want what is best for my nation and I want the people in it to be happy, including me, and I am happy with John. Thank you.’
It had been about four months since they’d started going out, and Sherlock and John had been in John’s room. They had gone up on the pretence of playing Mario Kart (Sherlock was scarily good at Mario Kart. It made John physically uncomfortable to see him smash all the records, take home all the trophies and destroy every member of the race without even breaking a sweat) and ended up lying mostly naked in bed with Sherlock giving John one of his breath-taking blowjobs.
It was inevitable, John thought giddily, as he leaned forwards and touched his lips to Sherlock’s. They’d been waiting for it for the last month, waiting for this moment, and it was
‘I’m a curse, John!’ Sherlock cried, glaring at his partner, and John didn’t understand why Sherlock was so convinced of that, why he thought it was his fault, and he just said, ‘why would you think that?’
‘I started that rumour that you were the bastard son of Prince Marcus,’ Irene said, ignoring him completely. ‘And that boy tried to kidnap you for ransom-‘
‘I’ve already fallen in love,’ Sherlock said to his empty room. ‘There is no need to promise anything.’
Molly’s ‘brilliant’ idea was simple; Sherlock would bake cookies which spelled out John, will you go to prom with me? Originally, Sherlock had planned to spell out John, will you come to the large social gathering involving dancing, secret drinking and everyone pretending to like each other held annually for the year 13’s at Sherwood Grammar School with me but Molly had said that would take far too long both to do and to bake, especially considering Sherlock was absolutely awful at turning the little lumps of dough into letters.
Now, as John looked at his heartbroken family, he knew that he would never, ever be able to live his real life. Now, as John's broken heart slammed in his chest, he realised for the millionth time in the last three days that he couldn't do it. He couldn't get over Sherlock, couldn't stay with Mary, and now he couldn't do anything about it.
‘No,’ John heard himself saying, and William was just staring at him, head cocked. ‘John Watson, we already worked this all out before you got here. We’ve been debating it for four hours and this is the fairest option I could tolerate…’
But it wasn’t just any picture. It was the picture that took pride of place in Baker Street, hanging over the desk. It was the picture that saw a daughter’s GCSE exams, a daughter’s A levels, and the heartbreak of a daughter going to university, not just once but twice. It saw a son going to primary and secondary school, a son breaking his arm and a son and a father blowing up the kitchen for ‘science, Papa!’ It saw two men return home when they dropped their youngest child at university, it saw cases and murders and the one pavlova that ever rose. It saw a new consulting detective with dark, curly hair and bright blue eyes take over the family business, all from its place above the desk.
‘Don’t worry,’ Jim grinned, slapping Sherlock on the back. ‘My body parts idea is genius. And I have an even better idea for your first date-‘
that John was standing here now, because he knew Sherlock wouldn’t do that, couldn’t do that, not to their child, but he couldn’t help that thought, the way he hadn’t been able to help that thought from zooming around his brain at least once a day for thirteen years. Maybe Sherlock had never really forgiven him for forgiving Mary, for choosing Mary, for watching him get on that fucking plane with all those things unsaid.
And now it was here, and every thought, every imagine, was forgotten. All that mattered was John Watson, wearing a tight pair of black jeans, a navy jumper and looking as scared as Sherlock felt.
A start and an end, all in one kiss, and as Sherlock pulls away he knows that it will never happen again because they may have been perfect, they may have been infinite, but their paths were never in the same place at the same time. ‘John-‘
John leaned forwards, so close that when he spoke Sherlock could feel the cold rush of his breath against his cheek. ‘I see you as you, Sherlock. But not the you that you want people to see.’
‘The man gripped the back of his neck and hauled him down to his height, clashing their lips together. Sherlock gripped his wrist and gasped at the burning sensation exactly where the man was holding him in a vice-like grip. What was
It was strange to think, but it was the truth. John really liked Sherlock and he thought Sherlock really liked him, and he hoped, hoped,
John was staring at Sherlock, open-mouthed, and Sherlock was staring at his plate, instantly regretting it. ‘Sorry. Say that- say that again?’
John glared witheringly at Sherlock before continuing. ‘If Jacob is a genius then I will have to hire help. Harry would love to live with us-‘
Irene told Jim, Jim told Sebby and by the time Sherlock got into school on Monday morning everyone knew. John had been oddly quiet about the whole thing, which had led to Sherlock suspecting that John wasn't as ‘not gay’ as he claimed, which had further led to Sherlock’s absolutely brilliant idea of asking John to the large social gathering involving dancing, secret drinking and everyone pretending to like each other held annually for the year 13’s at Sherwood Grammar School.
He didn’t want to explain this to Sarah, though, so instead he said, ‘Yeah, well. I didn’t even start getting them until I was three, so they’re a lot younger than me.’ At sixteen, John considered himself almost a man, and it made his brain hurt to think his soulmate was only
‘OH!’ His face lit up, and he turned around, grabbing his coat from the window sill. ‘John! I remember!’
He was sitting at the back, opposite the window, and he could see a boy in a long coat and a tourist cap arguing with a smaller boy who looked vaguely familiar. John briefly wondered if they went to his school before dismissing it; they were probably celebrities or something. There was no other reason to cover your face as violently as the taller boy was doing in the middle of summer.
‘It’s just a coronation.’ Sherlock mumbled: he hated it when Mycroft got all disappointed, it made him feel guilty which in turn made him feel angry because why should he feel guilty about nothing? Thankfully, Mycroft didn't reply, focusing on his phone, so Sherlock turned his attention back to his ceremonial dress. 'Irene,' he said, batting his eyelashes, 'I seem to be having trouble buttoning up this godforsaken shirt. Assistance?' Irene stepped in front of him, deftly doing up all the buttons, smiling up at him seductively because she knew
‘OH MY GOD,’ Sherlock screeched as flames shot out of the oven and singed his eyebrows. ‘MOLLY! YOUR OVEN HAS MALFUNCTIONED! HORRIBLY HORRIBLY MALFUNCTIONED!”
‘Sherly!’ Came the cry, as soon as he had stepped inside. In the entrance hall stood his father, step-mother and brothers, surrounding…
It was like a light had gone out in Sherlock’s eyes. Suddenly they were dark, almost black, and he had moved so quickly John barely registered he was no longer in the chair, instead several feet forwards, just a foot or so from Morag, when he said in a voice so low it actually scared John-
Sherlock turned slowly. Lestrade was no longer asleep; Lestrade was very much awake and staring at Sherlock with an expression of pure shock.
Sherlock’s eyes were darting. He looked carefully at John, then Jim, before saying, ‘you shot Morag?’
John ignored stabbing sensation in his heart, instead saying quietly, ‘He doesn't deserve your love if he’s doing something like this. He doesn't fucking deserve you, Sherlock.’
Sherlock nodded, collapsing back in his chair. ‘Sentiment is bad, certainly. But it is cancelled out by John.’
John groaned and threw his head back as Sherlock kissed down his neck, sucking right over his collarbone, before climbing back up to kiss underside of his chin. ‘Jesus Christ, I’ve wanted to do this for hours,’ he gasped, and Sherlock laughed breathlessly, pausing so their eyes were level. ‘I know,’ he whispered, voice catching in his throat, ‘I know that. I know.’
‘I don’t mind, Lestrade, honestly.’ Sherlock crouched back down and surveyed the body. ‘I don't care what people that much stupider than me think of my intelligence. Jealousy, I assume-‘
Lila’s oldest child, August, was eight and thought the sun shone from Rosie. ‘Dunno what she’ll think of that.’ John glanced at the door as it opened and Sherlock reappeared, Rosie tagging behind, looking so like a nervous child John was filled with an insatiable urge to protect this man, the bravest and best man he knew. ‘Sher?’
A tall girl with dark hair and an Irish accent appeared behind Sherlock, laying a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder as she sat down. ‘So,’ she said in an Irish accent. ‘He deduced you? What did you say? Do you hate him yet?’
. ‘That’s Jim,’ she gestured at the boy on the sofa, ‘And that’s Victor.’ The boy on the floor waved. ‘We’re friends of Jim’s from school: we assume you knew him before? We don’t care. What has my Sherlock been doing to you?’
John halted and moved his head away from Sherlock’s so he was staring into Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock was suddenly worried as his brain began to switch back on. Did this not mean anything to John? Was this just a ‘friend’ thing? Did friends do this to each other? Why did Sherlock not have any friends? Was platonic kissing a thing? If he asked Siri if platonic kissing was a thing right then would John be mad?
Sherlock was just as eager as John if not more so, kissing and touching and looking at him, and John remembered how cool he thought Sherlock’s eyes were when he first came to the resort, over three years ago. They’re not cool, he thought giddily as he stared into them, they’re
‘Don’t you dare stop.’ John growled and Sherlock smiled, ducking back down and licking the top of John’s dick, flicking his tongue along the slit horrifically, brilliantly, slowly. John was incredibly close to coming, and Sherlock knew it, so he was deliberately staving off John’s orgasm for as long as he could, and if John hadn't been so close to coming he would have whacked his boyfriend’s arm and commanded him to
Sherlock looked down at her, puzzled, but as usual he couldn’t deduce a thing about her. Instead he ducked his head and, lips grazing her ear, whispered, ‘definitely.’
Sherlock snorted. ‘God, John, even when you have no reason to be sorry you apologise. What is it with you British?’
‘It’s different,’ Irene said, still gazing at the television. ‘Mycroft isn’t the King of the most powerful empire in the world, and the kids sweeten the deal.’
Jenny, however, thought it would be good for him to socialise and make new friends, so he went traipsing after Harry, who was incredibly excited. Both of the Watson children were incredibly sociable and well-liked, but John just wasn't feeling it. Their father had left less than two months before and this trip had meant to be for all four of them, and although he knew it was bad John couldn't help but imagine what his father would be doing if he was here. He wouldn't make John go to the teen club, he would think it was stupid and let John stay with him, letting him have sips of his beer and playing table tennis-
‘Really?’ Molly looked overly delighted that Sherlock hadn't shot her down immediately and blushed. ‘Oh- well- um-‘
John laughed at his mother’s face but shut up. Jenny loved the royal family, like so many others, and adored occasions such as these. ‘We can see the whole family, together!’ Jenny squeaked as the curtains covering the doors to the balcony opened.
Sherlock smiled, softly and sorrowfully, and then he stood up and left his flat, and their life, without a backwards glance.
Sherlock saw John take off his shoes and slipped off his trainers. John had asked him to dress casually, like a normal teenager, so Sherlock was wearing his only pair of jeans (Morag had bought them for him when he ‘volunteered’ at the soup kitchen in an attempt to show the public that the royal family were in touch with the common people) and a t-shirt John had bought him. It was a deep purple with dark swirls on it, and although Sherlock had originally thought it strangely feminine he loved it. The fabric was soft, the pattern was intricate, and most importantly it had been the first gift John had given him, and that made it special.
‘Can’t argue with that,’ John agreed, and Sherlock reached for the last bottle. He lifted it up, smiling at John with lidded eyes. ‘To friends.’
William sighed and squared his shoulders. He was dressed in his robe, the purple one with the gold lining and red furnish. Sherlock had always hated the robe; it was the twenty-first century, for Christ’s sake, why did they still dress like medieval dictators? Why not wear a suit like the modern dictators they were?
John grinned, drinking in the sight of the boy. He was maybe six foot tall, about a year younger than John, pale, big hands, a shocking amount of black curls and intense, blue(ish) eyes that seemed to see right into John’s soul.
Sherlock was moving forwards, desperate to be near him, to touch him, but John had turned around, walking away from the gathering of people on the front lawn. He didn’t even hesitate to follow him, excitement building up inside as he pressed
to, and now he must put up with strange looks and angry sighs whenever he announces that he’s going out to see him.
disappointing John. He wanted to make John pleased, to make John happy, to make John…well. To make John like him, for reasons he couldn’t quite decipher (thirty years without the urge for human friendship, and suddenly he’s overwhelmed with a desire to impress an ex-soldier-cum-doctor) and didn’t have time to decipher. Not now.
Sherlock frowned. ‘That’s very odd. I’d been planning on asking you for months, my friends all had a bet on it-‘
It was like all his worst nightmares bundled together. The boy Sherlock had never wished to see or hear from again, the boy who had betrayed Sherlock more than anyone in the world, the boy who Sherlock had spent the last two and a half years trying to get over, standing by his dresser, talking to his boyfriend and oh god what would James do? What would he say?
‘I said,’ Sherlock murmured, ‘that you were worth more than my friends, more than my family and more than my kingdom. And do you know what?’
Sherlock gently lay down next to John. He didn’t say anything, simply staring at the ceiling and waiting for John to say something. John always spoke first; he couldn’t resist.
John turned on his side and touched Sherlock’s face gently. ‘Now, we stay together. That’s what we do.’
in his vision disappeared except for one person, approximately six metres away with dark blond hair and sky blue eyes.
Sherlock was closely followed by Trisha, Archie and Mycroft, who stood slightly behind Sherlock as he stepped up to the microphone.
‘He seems so arrogant on TV,’ John had replied. ‘He seems like a right prick. And you’ve heard those rumours about his involvement in the Eye massacre.’
John looked at the paper in disbelief. ‘You wrote that in the hall. Bit pre-emptive, don’t you think?’
‘You have me,’ Sherlock said as he reached for the door. ‘And I bet I know more than anybody else here about England.’ He paused, face screwed up in concentration. ‘France. I meant France.’
‘He’s right, Mycroft.’ Irene smiled sweetly at the older man, who huffed and looked away (Mycroft had a huge problem with Irene, though Sherlock didn't understand why) as Sherlock smiled widely. He didn’t know why he had this subconscious need to impress Irene, to have Irene on his side, for Irene to pat his head and tell him what a clever little boy he was, but it hadn't gone away yet, even though he'd known Irene for almost two years and been fucking her for about eighteen months. He had no way to stop it, and Irene clearly liked it: she had a love for power almost as great as that of James Moriarty, which should have made Sherlock uneasy but didn't.
‘Jenny Watson.’ John’s mother said. Sherlock held out his hand and she grasped it; her hand was shaking. Sherlock smiled at her as un-sharkily as he could, attempting to settle her, and it seemed to work; she offered him a watery smile.
‘Rosamund Watson,’ Sherlock said, very seriously, ‘How would you like to become Rosamund Watson-Holmes?’
A sudden crash made them break apart and Sherlock stared at his son, who was trying to look innocent in John’s arms. ‘I din’t do anything,’ he said innocently, batting his big blue/green eyes at John. ‘The picture falled by itself.’
‘Everyone treats me like I’m made of glass,’ Sherlock said, matter-of-factly. ‘They treat me like a…like a Prince.’
He still hadn’t told him when they sat down to dinner, John spoon-feeding Rosie noodles as Sherlock picked at his beef.
Despite this, he had never had sex, although he had gotten to third a few times with various girls; the first time, he’d been only fourteen. He didn’t come from a religious family but he wanted his first time actually having sex to be special and to be with someone he loved, a view that Harry regularly took the mic out of.
It hurt so badly but so beautifully; in a twisted way, Sherlock felt this was exactly what he deserved for hurting John as he was doing and god what if John found out?
‘God save King Sherlock!’ The crowd cried in unison. It occurred to Sherlock that they might have cue cards.
‘Greg.’ Irene took her seat on Jim’s other side, hair ruffled and lipstick slightly smudged. ‘That Anthea is a
Except, at the same time, it wasn't simple and it wasn't just like it had been when they were children. There were too many illicit glances, too much touching, too much staring, and John noticed it from Sherlock just as much as Sherlock noticed it from him. It gave him hope, as the summer progressed, that maybe,
‘I doubt that will be the title, John, it’s far too long.’ Sherlock said, steepling his hands under his chin and watching Christopher, who was now trying to assemble a 3D model of the human body. ‘No, Christopher, you’re not screwing it in right.’
‘You have too many ghosts for me to join you in wedlock.’ He laughs at that, because never before has he been so perfectly summed up:
John focused on the screen. The official announcer was reading out their names; John heard Olivia Baldwin, a blonde woman in her mid-forties with William’s smile, Paul Fisher, a man in his early thirties with messy black hair; Daniel and Lucas Grey, identical twins with the same blue/green eyes as Sherlock who looked about Mycroft's age if slightly older; Isla Wyatt, who couldn’t have been more than twenty-five and who had William’s sharp cheekbones, Annabelle Fox, who looked about twenty-two, and Dean Samuels who, with his curly hair (albeit a lighter brown than Sherlock’s inky black), slender frame and wicked smile could have been Sherlock’s non-identical twin.
‘Not going to have a strange woman bringing up my kids,’ Greg said adamantly. ‘Just fucks them up. I know this bloody family are obsessed with it but no way.’
‘Dean Winchester disappeared with Castiel Novak approximately twenty minutes ago,’ Jim said. ‘They went in the direction of the PE cupboards and I’m guessing Dean’s banging Cas in there.’
‘But,’ Sherlock continued, ‘For some reason, I keep finding ways to make you stay around here, so I have come to explain. And apologise. Probably explain first.’
‘Not until you admit that girls are better than boys!’ Tavvy said, sitting on Sherlock’s ankles and tickling his knees.
the right amount, the perfectly carved chin and those cheekbones, the right incisor biting down on the bottom cupid-bow lip, John felt something he’d never felt before. A tingle, a feeling, right in the very pit of his stomach, and he didn't know what it was but he
John looked gloomily down at his coffee. If Mike didn’t show in the next five minutes, he decided he would leave. Go home, eat chocolate and watch Jeremy Kyle with Harry-
