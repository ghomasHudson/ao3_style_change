His eyes had been watering, earlier, as he’d said his goodbye. Now, a single tear slipped out and ran down his cheek, leaving a shiny wet trail behind. “God.”
“Nice try,” Tony said distractedly, turning back to his machine. “Just give me a few minutes here, folks, you can have a seat if you want one.”
“Mr. Stark,” Steve says, and then, with a guilty glance down at his arm, “Tony.”
Steve’s not sure what he thinks of that. He doesn’t press.
“It’s raining. It’ll be out soon.”
Tony tucks his dick back into his pants, reaches into the inner pocket of his blazer and pulls out his handkerchief. Steve leans his temple against Tony’s knee as Tony wipes down his face, working in quick, business-like strokes.
“I’ll take you back,” he says.
He invites the team over for dinner before they’ve even finished counting all the bodies. He’s desperate to keep the Ultimates around, he realizes, desperate to stay on. He sees a future in them he can’t find in himself.
Before the tumor, Tony prided himself on being something of a collector. As the pleasure of owning rare and expensive things wore thin, he branched had branched out from art to sculpture to trading card, and, somewhere along the way, tried his hand at keeping exotic fish. He found aquarium maintenance tricker than he’d expected, and the beautiful fish capricious and prone to random disease.
He fell face down, only barely catching himself on his elbows, and something made an uncomfortable, creaky sort of
Sturdy metal chains, probably reinforced with something he can’t break — adamantium, perhaps, titanium. Sturdy metal chair, unyielding under his fingers. Hotel room, probably. Fancy. Ornate four poster bed. Coffeemaker with dozens of little pods, Starktech. Smell of air freshener. Crick in the back of the neck.
Dear Tony,
“I don’t think even a licensed psychiatrist could navigate the emotional ramifications of that foursome, darling,” he says, sliding down on the couch to get his head into her lap.
me read anything.”
Wasn’t there a quote about this, two deaths? Hemingway, he thinks; the first death when a man’s heart stops beating, and the second the last time his name is spoken? He must be witnessing this second death right now, taking part in it. He must be, he thinks, the last person to speak Steve’s name. It’s odd, to feel a sense of connection to this man, only a few years older than him at the time when he had enlisted, probably nowhere near as skinny as Tony is picturing him, to mourn him, but Tony takes a moment to feel both of those emotions anyhow.
Instead, though, Steve meets his eye. “I hated it,” he admits, “you were right.”
Cap’s still holding his eyes. He’s sober. It couldn’t have been a drunken mistake. Tony can see the fear and humiliation badly obscured behind his shaky, too-neutral poker face.
“Of course I can,” Tony reached over, setting a light hand on the newcomer’s orange-clad elbow, and led him gently over to the rack of power tools.
He’s not upset. It’s a fine enough plan.
When Tony had brought Steve home after the Chitauri invasion, that first time, it was a quiet affair. Tony sat on the couch, drinking champagne straight out of the bottle. Steve pus his feet up on Tony’s coffee table and turned on the TV, swapping channels unlike he found whatever shitty medical soap he’d been into.
“Well,” Iron Man says. His voice sounds like he’s about to refuse, but he seems to change his mind, “when you put that way, sure.”
A sick, strange feeling settles in the pit of his stomach, something like grief, like longing. Part of him wants the easy out, Iron Man without Tony Stark. Part of him wants the man who didn’t lie to him, the one who’s understood him all along, who’d put Steve’s happiness, their feelings, over his own secret identity, who’d been held back by some outside force.
For a moment, something like jealousy curdles in the pit of Tony’s stomach, but he shrugs it off and lies easily. “No, no, I’m afraid she’s otherwise engaged. Another night, I’m sure.”
“Listen,” he says, again, “your number was just there. I wasn’t trying to— be weird. I don’t think that just because you—“
I mean, you know it’s Tony.
The rest of the night proceeds exactly how Tony expects it to.
“Yeah,” Tony says, “right. The tumor.”
Steve wants to say, but the words freeze in his throat. Gail had loved him, once upon a time. She won’t understand this. Everyone has a breaking point. He can’t ask her to understand this.
And then he catches Steve staring, his anxiety clearly visible through his awful, awful poker face. He must know Tony won’t dump him here alone, right? If nothing else, Tony’s driver will certainly be ready to take him home. He’s not heartless, over here.
Outside of suggesting an immediate confrontation — which has tactical advantages, but may leave them unsure of what has happened to Amora’s probable victims — he can’t bring to mind a better one, in their current position. Tony has done nothing to compromise the team. He has nothing to be upset with Tony about.
This has to be the reason hypothetical-Tony cares about this, after all. Hypothetical-Tony, despite making a dumb mistake, is still Tony; he hasn’t caught feelings.
He’s still sitting on the edge of the tub when Steve slides, slowly, to his knees and takes Tony’s dick in his mouth, swallowing him down all at once. Tony grips the sides of the side of the tub for balance. You’ve just got to do things, he thinks, and catches Steve’s head with his thighs.
Tony turns back to call for Jarvis to bring him an obituary cocktail, and then remembers just who he is mourning for. He stands and grabs himself a bottle of wine instead, red.
“Best warm you up,” Steve mutters, not particularly directed at Tony, and grabs him by the ankle, folding his knees back against his chest. He keeps his hand on Tony’s calf, holding his legs up to expose the underside of his thighs, and strikes without warning, open-palmed.
Blessedly, Steve gets it.
Before the Avengers had taken residence here, the medbay had been a gallery, and when Tony closes his eyes, he can picture the places on the walls where his mothers’ favorite paintings had hung, cityscapes and careful depictions of birds. He’d never been sure what it was that had made her pick them out, had never thought to ask.
Steve has written a message in his familiar cursive handwriting, loopy and slanted, just under the stems of the flowers.
“You know,” Tony says, his voice all Tony, free of the Stark brand, free of the inflection he’s used to hearing coming out from under the helmet, “you don’t
“You’d best take care of that heart of yours,” Steve said, “Good luck.”
Actually, he’s alright with the second one. A little too alright, perhaps.
They don’t see each other for about a week. Tony drafts several text messages, ranging in content and intensity from,
“Hi, Tony,” the Wasp said. Though Steve didn’t know her identity, he knew the Wasp’s friendship with Tony Stark was old, “Are you busy?”
“No Iron Man?” Steve asks. He’s fully suited up, now, his shield in his hands.
“I didn’t come here for her,” Steve replies. Tony fights the urge to laugh.
“They always come right after you’ve said something,” he points out, “if you don’t go to med, you have to shut up.”
Tony sighs and forks over the medical information expected of him, running through the motions — he doesn’t know how long he has left, exactly, but the specialists place him at six months to five years. It’s inoperable.
“’S kinda exciting,” Arnie tells him, shrugging, “like a riddle fate’s left out for y’to solve.”
“Why are you wearing that?” Steve asked, trying not to sound suspicious. “What happened?”
Steve’s still standing there, leaning against the doorway. When Tony passes him, he follows, his hands in his pockets.
Role-play is good. Role-play is easy, easier than trying to untangle whatever complicated mess of emotions this is pulling out of him.
He wasn’t. The sad, absurd irony of the situation hits Steve. He tries to kick up, angling to kick the man in the chest, but the drugs leave him sluggish, weak. The man ducks easily out of the way, grabbing Steve by the hair and sliding the bar of the gag in place with little resistance, fastening it behind Steve’s neck.
under his breath, but that’s not what matters. He’s used Steve’s real name, which he’s never been told. Iron Man knows, in secret, and though he could have told Tony Stark, this is the kind of dick move that could shatter their friendship. Tony shouldn’t care, shouldn’t feel like he deserves even this scrap of a relationship, and yet anxiety flares in his chest at the thought of being caught in the lie.
He likes that about her. He likes the lack of sensitivity, the lack of weakness, the way she takes charge of situations. He thinks it’s cute when she teases him over his emotions. He likes that she just lets him take care of her, has no issues using his money. He’d never liked to soothe, or reassure, to have to be the strong one.
“That wasn’t part of the bet, Cap,” Tony shrugs, smug. “We said, if you fall.”
“I’unno,” Tony closes his eyes, half-listening to the conversation on the television. “Wish things weren’t so complicated. Don’t want—“
Steve frowns, considering, “The little centipede things count for half, they’re easy. Usual terms?”
It’s a little silly, he’s sure. He would have had most of the same thoughts had they never found Steve, had it been him making the choices. He likes burgers. He likes fries. He likes the color blue. He helps people. He’s been known to go outside, on occasion. He’s been raised too wealthy not to appreciate fine art.
Natasha, who’s laying halfway across Tony, her shirt undone despite no losses calling for it, scoffs.
No, Tony thinks, this isn’t about that. Steve’s willing to leave at any time, but he wants to leave with Tony.
Some moments later, Hank had taken the photo; Janet, sneaking up through the hall to scare them, Steve and Tony, still blind to the world in the center of the room.
“Don’t feel very lucky now,” Steve says, grimacing. He’ll heal in a couple days’ time, he thinks. He goes to stand, but Tony’s hand on his shoulder stops him.
Tony thought Steve would be upset about the team finding out. He wasn’t.
It’s possible, he realizes, that Steve is out in the field right now, fighting guys who use his technology to talk. He takes a moment to throw himself a pity party, imagining Steve surrounded by enemy fighters, each of whom is equipped with a front-of-the-line, innovative distance communication systems, by Stark Industries™, and is using them to discuss the best strategies to kick Captain America’s ass. If only their comms would fail, he might have a chance, but, alas, Tony’s technology is just that good.
“It’s raining,” Tony says, near-mocking, “you’ll slip and fall to your goddamn death. Get back inside.”
Tony stared at him, silent. His surprise, his disbelief showed.
finds this charming.
He was too sick of losing people, too devastated by the simple, sweet thing he’d imagined he’d never have again, to think about any of that.
They try the usual things. Tony, having experimented with many a partner, shows Steve the handcuffs and blindfolds, runs through the motions of establishing safe words.
The team isn’t the same, and not just because they’ve left SHIELD behind. When he’s there, Hawkeye walks around like a lifeless automaton, his eyes downcast, his expression perpetually distant. He takes unnecessary risks in battle, escalating each time they’re out. None of them dare to stop him.
He makes his decision then; he’s going to write a note to Steve, tell him everything, and then he’s going to go out fighting. None of this slow death stuff, none of the heart issues, nothing like that; he’ll try to take them on, and he knows he won’t survive the fight, but it’ll look like he tried.
Steve remembered future-Steve’s —fake Steve’s— words earlier.
“You’d stood her up,” he says, fully knowing he’s wrong. “You were just being a dick.”
Steve ragequits soon afterwards, when another loss has Janet reaching for his fly. He’s by far the most expressive player, his poker face unpracticed, and this extends even post-game; his embarrassed flush reaches down to collarbones.
to objects, to locations. Some of them are undeniable, too canny to dispute, too specific. Others —
Steve wished, suddenly, that Iron Man was there. He could speak his mind with Iron Man without worrying about looking silly.
He knows this before the man even starts speaking to him. They have the vibe about them, the way they’re holding themselves, the way they’re dressed, the weapons they carry, too well-armed for their levels of skill. Terrorists.
Once he’s done with the right hand, Rogers offers him his left. He can’t know how this looks, Tony thinks, digging his fingers into the seams of the second glove to free the zippers. He’s the kind of guy who’d freak out about something like that.
He pulls his pants on, too. “Just let me get him a doctor, Natasha. There’s a chance — people have survived worse, as long as it didn’t go—”
By the time he’s stepped around again, the conversation is over, and it takes him far too long to pick out either Amora or Tony in the crowd.
“Lot of funerals lately. Haven’t gotten it cleaned.”
Tony thinks,
He doesn’t ask, just puts a hand on the side of Tony’s jaw and forces it open to shove the ball gag inside. It’s a tight fit, and it pinches with the kind of discomfort that promises pain in the morning, overwhelming and huge in his mouth.
The two of them stare at his hand, expectant, and then angry black slash marks come through on Bucky’s arm, blotting out entire patches of skin. Steve realizes she’s crossing out the words, going over them in thick circles that must leave no writing legible on her hand. The scribbles quickly cover what she’d written over Bucky’s wrist, too.
Steve trains in the gym with Iron Man, who warms up gradually to him but never takes off the mask, never talks personal details. He makes friends with the whole team, charmed by the Wasp, easily pals with Giant-Man, appreciative of Thor’s combat and easy camaraderie, but, slowly, he and Iron Man grow closest of all. They fight together easily on the battlefield, naturally cognizant of each others’ strengths and weaknesses, getting the same ideas at the same times, keenly aware when the other is in danger.
He smells Steve’s aftershave before he’s registered that Steve’s arrived. It’s simple, clean. Soapy, almost. He sees Steve’s hand and Steve is wearing a blue pattered shirt with white buttons.
Well, uh. Talk to you later. You know my number. Bye.
, and the latter
His voice breaks.
Tony closes his laptop and slides down, off the bed, to sit beside Steve on the floor. Their shoulders bump. Tony’s height is mostly leg, so when they sit, he feels shorter than he really is, Steve’s bulk exaggerated next to him.
Steve pins him, pushes him hard into the bed, leaving a deep imprint of their tangled bodies in the memory foam underneath them. Steve bites at his neck, his earlobe. The familiar hands on his hips squeeze, near bruising, and Tony feels something uncoil deep inside his chest, some tangled knot coming undone, and slides into a welcome calm.
“I don’t know what that is.”
If he was a braver man, he’d ask about the mumbled confession in the dark, the two words he’s still not sure he heard. If he was a braver man, he’d let himself hope, knowing he was setting himself up for disappointment — that Steve had been dreaming even if Tony hadn’t, that he must have imagined someone else. If he was a braver man, he’d take the spell as a cue to try his luck.
“You know, you’ll only find them there if they’ve already been arrested,” Ty points out, peering over Tony’s shoulder as he starts on the first of 903 possible matches, all slightly off. “So, you know, if you want a criminal as your soulmate…”
He takes someone home after the party, a brown-eyed brunette who isn’t quite his type but seems like she’d be sweet when he won’t be able to get it up. Later, in bed, her hands in his hair and his mouth on her nipple, he thinks about how he’d enjoy fucking Rogers.
“It’s not about the mission.” Tony says. Steve doesn’t argue with him. He’s not stupid, and he’s not planning on acting like it, on forcing them into the hamster wheel of a conversation that won’t move.
“I bet you’ll fall,” he says, casually bumping his gauntlet against Steve’s shoulder.
And then someone kicks down the door.
“Well, she’s definitely looking for Thor, or his human identity, anyhow,” Tony types and talks at the same time, relaying the information to Thor via identicard. “I made it sound like I had information. I said I could take her to a hotel I thought he was staying in. She agreed to meet me.”
“Well,” he said, in the kind of calm, measured voice he used when speaking to TV crews, low and trustworthy, “Maybe I’ve moved on to other projects.”
He has time. Stark hasn’t booted him out of his house. No one is threatening his status as a future team member. He’s going to have many opportunities to find the skeletons in Stark’s closet, and, goddamnit, he’ll take all of them.
Steve yawns and reaches over to turn off the light, pulling Tony over to cuddle up. “Yeah, okay.”
Cap, as always, sits alone at the table adjacent to the booth where the Pyms sit, his book in front of him. It’s still fucking Vonnegut.
Pietro is showing off, batting one of the robots around. Wanda, looking bored, doesn’t seem to have gotten off her phone.
“I don’t have a landline,” Steve continues, after a beat. “I’ve never had one here. I’ve been here a year and I still try to find the goddamn thing.”
“I should have known he was lying to me,” he said, “I should have—“
He still passes on the offer of pizza, leaning against the rec room refrigerator. Oddly enough, it’s Fury who glances over at him, assessing. Tony wonders he’s worried about being poisoned; he certainly comes off as paranoid enough.
Then darkness.
“I’ll look after him,” he promised, “he’ll be okay.”
Steve Rogers
“It’s fine,” Steve says, waving him off, “it doesn’t hurt that much.”
He straps the shield over his arm, pulls up his boot, tries hard to summon adrenaline which just won’t come. Unreality surrounds him from all sides. He feels like his point of view has been pushed back further, like a thick slab of glass has been inserted between his brain and his surroundings.
“Yeah,” Tony says, his mouth dry, “just come see me. Phone working? I’ll text you.”
and settles in with his laptop.
, 4:00 AM.
“I’d like to be alone right now.”
“I’ll text you the time, place, and dress code.” Tony says, his smile audible in his voice. “Go on, then, shoo. Bye-bye.”
comms,
When he opens his eyes, everything feels momentarily too bright, and he’s dizzy. He longs, suddenly, to trade this crowd for the comfort of his memory foam mattress and blackout curtains, the cool crispness of his sheets.
At first, they won’t surrender the body to him. He hadn’t been her emergency contact. He wonders who had.
“I couldn’t help noticing all the potential you’re coming up short on,” Steve says, his tone light, almost playful, “and I’d find it useful to test myself against someone stronger than me for once.”
As vivid as it is, it’s just a dream. They’re all just dreams.
Draft of note (keep it short & to point)
They have to give him their names several times before anything sticks. Wasp. Bucky’s gone. Bucky had fallen, and there’s nothing left of him. He hadn’t had a serum to keep him alive. He must be alive. Bucky must be alive, but he can’t be. Giant-Man. He doesn’t trust them. Thor. They’d won the war. They were going to win the war. Iron Man. The robot is called Iron Man.
He’s not too worried. Things come up, and neither of the scientists had ever shown much fondness for him anyhow.
Only his eyes, Iron Man’s blue, remain the same.
“Listen,” Steve says, “I know you didn’t want to have to tell me.”
“Oh, golly, Cap. I don’t know how to tell you this.” He pauses, seeming to consider his words. “Mr. Stark arranged that with Molecule Man. Why do you think it had been so easy to talk him down?”
They’ve moved away from SHIELD. Tony strikes up a contract to use some of the training rooms, the simulations, but since Nick Fury is one stingy bastard, when it comes down to it, he ends up building most himself. The team grumbles, as they always do, about having to attend training at Tony’s black sites in New Mexico, Montana, or, God forbid, Nevada, but Tony thinks the quality of care only improves.
Secondly, that he was wrong. This was never going to help anyone. There’s no way to explain himself in the little time he has left. There’s only one thing to do.
“Yes,” Steve says, quietly, “yessir.”
Tony walks out quietly and sits close to him, so close he can half feel his body heat, can smell the earthy, spicy cologne through a day’s wear. Jasmine, he thinks. The scent underneath is jasmine.
Tony Stark, on a chair four feet in front of him.
“Aren’t you forgetting something?” He asks.
Tony sighs and rolls to his feet, grabbing a robe himself on the way over. Steve is still staring at the collection in the closet.
His hands are sweaty as he takes the pen offered to him. He’s already thinking of the words he’ll need to say. It’s not Steve; he could have loved Steve in another life, he needs to write. Kind of loves him now, even, working off the incomplete information provided to him, he needs to write. Sometimes, he imagines their lives interwoven together, imagines waking tangled up with Steve on Saturday mornings, imagines the shield displayed proudly on its own stand in Tony’s apartments, the ultimate
Today, maybe it’d be enough.
The thought fills him with a strangely fierce sense of protectiveness, anger tinged with something warm. It’s easy to be angry with Tony when he’s in control, when he’s taking charge of the meeting, when he’s telling Steve how things are going to be. It’s harder now, cataloguing the after effects of his fear, his struggle.
Steve hums something that could be protest or assent, a short, amused hmph, and pulls Tony by the hand into the bedroom — he’s the one in this partnership who cares about keeping Tony’s couches clean.
“Oh,” Steve says, and picks up a pair of fuzzy red and black handcuffs, hooking them over a finger, “I’m amenable.”
Well. He supposed that was the reason Tony didn’t touch people.
“I should go,” he says. He’s still kneeling by the bed, his face only inches below Steve’s. They could kiss. Once, they would have.
Jarvis arrives minutes after Steve goes. He knows how to work the equipment in here, knows his way around a first aid kit. Still, Tony can’t talk him out of calling a doctor.
At first glance, it seems to make sense. This man, much more than Tony Stark, fits his conception of how Iron Man should be. His face is open and honest, each expression easy to read (
They have come into the possession of discarded Stark Industries weapons, ones long ago taken off the market. The only issue is that every single item is somehow mangled, disarmed, or damaged. Tony, who had overseen the destruction of the discarded technology, knows full well that they’d beyond repair, that, even if he had wanted to help, he’d practically be building them from scratch.
The map that the card shows him, the summons, is crisp and clear, Stark’s technology. After their confrontation, Steve can’t help but feel a little nervous, a little uncomfortable, at the thought of putting so much trust in Stark.
“Now you’ve gone and lost my spot,” Rogers says, sounding mildly bummed out.
On the left, he’s stored a neatly folded up Berkley Horse. Swings and bondage equipment hang from the hooks. On the bottom shelves, he has the impact stuff, the duller paddles on the left and sharper stingers — the crops, canes, and their lot, his personal favorites,— on the right.
Maybe Steve will talk to Iron Man about his feelings. It’s an unfair hope, but Tony can’t help himself, can’t stop the stubborn desire to know.
He longs to be out on the field with Steve. For a minute, he even considers donning the suit, tracking down the terror cell and taking them down himself. But someone was already on them, long before he’d set his mind to join, and the work he’s doing now — the information gathering, the search for whoever had supplied technology to the bad guys, for whatever else they might have, is work that might just as valuable in the long run.
“Good luck. A future that looks— the way we used to look, Shellhead.”
It has to be the dark.
Steve screams in earnest when the blast hits the center of his chest, red-hot pain blooming across his entire front. Only the epicenter of the blast feels nothing at all, and he knows that’s a bad thing. Third degree.
And so the conversation moves on. Before she bids him goodbye, though, she promises to introduce him to Tony Stark the next day. That doesn’t happen. Two days later, he gets an apologetic call from her; Stark, apparently, is very busy. Steve, who has better things to do, things like wallowing in his own grief and checking out the gym, decides that it’ll happen eventually and lets it drop.
Steve seemed to consider it for a few moments more before nodding. “Okay. What can it hurt?”
Tony huffed and pinched the bridge of his nose. He could not believe that they were discussing this
“See? Now, I can only imagine that this really sucks right now for you, but I know you can rise above all that.”
“I’ve been thinking about this for a while. For about a month.”
« Tony, what’s on your mind? »
Tony tries to hold Steve back but he can't move as if he was stuck to the ground.
As they try to fall sleep, Tony thinks that, even with Peter, the bed seems too big for just the two of them. In his sleep, Peter huddles against Tony. Stroking his son’s hair, Tony can’t seem to erase the image of Steve hurt and hopeless from his mind.
Maria turns to Steve.
As soon as the words leave his mouth, Tony's face turns dark. He looks at the mirror again, lost in his thoughts. Feeling Tony's anxiety, Steve comes closer, put his arms around Tony’s chest, takes his hands lovingly. He slowly kisses his neck.
Steve sighs. « Tony, I’m your husband, remember? You need to tell me everything, even if you think it’s nothing. For the better and the worst, I promised to love you. »
Clint laughs and nods. Yes, it’s about damn time.
For five seconds, Steve stays silent. He’s searching for the best words to answer his beloved.
« Don’t tell me you did this. »
She smiles at Steve, tears still falling on her cheeks. She stands up.
Following Jarvis' instructions, Steve catches up with Tony and the stranger as they enter the elevator. They are still holding hands. By the time Steve decides if he needs to intervene, the doors have already closed.
"Was it like last time when you dreamt about your first meeting with him?"
« Steve? What the- »
« BADAHBOOO! » screamed Peter suddenly, throwing the little toy away. He stayed still three seconds, looking distant. Then he run toward Steve.
Avengers tower, 6 pm. The only sound that can be heard is a butter crackling in a frying pan. A yummy smell of sugar spreads slowly in the room. Alone in a comfy jogging and a white shirt, Steve is cooking pancakes for dinner. For the first time in 6 months, all Avengers would finally reunite for something else than a mission. When Tony sent the invitation, he told them to be here at 8, so it gives him two hours to be ready. Long enough. He flips a pancake, whistling and smiling. He is happy about this little party. He only has to finish this and then he’ll go take his shower. Nat said she would pick up Peter at school so everything is fine. Tony should be here in any minute anyway. Steve looks down at the ring he is wearing. Everything has gone so fast and crazy since they married two years ago.  Tony insisted heavily that he comes and lives with him in the tower. In fact, he literally took all his stuff from his old apartment and brought it here without asking him. He remembers how confused he was when he found the flat completely empty. Well, nearly empty, as the only thing that remained was a business card on the floor, with the tower drawn on it. However, he surprised himself seeing how well he adapted to the situation and to his new life. Living with Tony is everything but a burden. Thrilling, lovely, wonderful hell yeah! But definitely not a weight. They even managed to adopt a child. The first time they met Peter, they absolutely loved him. Despite his young age, Peter is very mature and already shows some interest in science which makes Tony especially happy. This morning, Peter couldn’t stay still, way too much excited by the upcoming party.
What happened? »
« Oh my god, Tony… »
« YOU. ABANDONED. ME! »
(See the end of the chapter for
« Steve, -Maria points at Clint - he said a bad language word, » Steve laughs.
Steve exhales, accepting that, and shoves his hands into the pockets of his ratty suit.
“Slippery hands,” Steve lies, “it’s too damn humid.”
His guess is confirmed once they start talking. Their leader shows him sketches on the clipboard, blueprints, and then yanks a heavy, dusty cloth off a set of wooden boxes, all inscribed with a familiar logo.
Tony and Nat won’t have kids. They’re never talked about it, but it’s a given, considering how little time Tony has left. He’d make an awful father, and she an even worse mother — Hawkeye’s natural ability with kids doesn’t extend to his work partner.
“Oh,” Tony says, “I’ll text you the time and place.”
Tony sighs, but leans forward to tell the driver the new address. They drive in silence, both equally caught, Steve suspects, on the past, or, perhaps, on a different present.
“I can’t help your heart,” Steve said, his hand slipping upwards to rest on the back of Tony’s neck, just where the metal stopped. “But as long as you’ll have me, I’ll be here.”
The writing fades, vanishes. His stomach flips and turns, twisting with shock.
The trick to getting away with things, Tony knows, is to just do them. Hesitation, any trace that you
Maybe he was just being sour over how his cake had turned out.
Tony puts a hand on his side to urge him downwards, onto his knees. When Steve reaches for his fly, though, some stab of fear has Tony catching him by the wrist.
you’re going to be in by tomorrow morning,” Steve interrupts him, speaking in a quick, frustrated ramble, “you don’t have extremis anymore, someone’s pumped mystery drugs into your veins, and by tomorrow you could be—“
Tony doesn’t want to think about that. He rattles on steadfastly, pushing the conversation in waters that could easily be fun for all of them. Rogers pushes him on it, (“What would people do,” he keeps asking, “if they knew? What would they think?”), but when it comes down to it, he’s a good soldier. He’d make an awful whistle blower, and Tony feels a strange security around that fact. A little loyalty has never hurt anyone.
He cups a hand around Steve’s neck and pulls him over to sit on the bed with him, puts his bare feet into Steve’s lap.
“Guess he’s a hard man to get a hold of,” Steve says, stepping around her to stare at the open armor on display. It must be the same suit he’d worn when they’d met. The inside, open and on display, is a soft yellowish gold. For some reason, the chestplate is missing.
Rogers makes a grab for the book, but Tony steps back, holding it out of reach. “I don’t even know who’d let you read this.”
Steve doesn’t. He glances between the two of them, caught between two options, and Tony decides to play nice and give him a hint: “I’m already sore.”
He didn’t know what the issue was.
It doesn’t taste great straight out of the bottle, un-aired. He doesn’t mind.
Natasha isn’t fussed. She surges down again, tries to kiss him. “Shh,” she says, “just relax.”
“So,” Steve says, sounding like he’s trying to be bummed about it, “what do I owe you?”
Maybe Steve and Janet will. A strange jealousy swirls in Tony’s gut at the thought. It must be, he decides, for the imagined normalcy of their married lives, the easy apple pie marriage he’s sure they’re headed towards. It’s not him. It’s never been him. He’s never wanted it, and he knows Steve must have, knows he’d been engaged once before to a woman who’d gone to have four children in a little house in the suburbs.
Even a rambling, desperate Tony is conscious of when he’s in company. With a glance at the waitress, he lets his voice get quieter, “— I didn’t think what happened in the car meant anything. I’m not being weird.”
“Oh,” Steve said, dully. The information settled uneasily in the pit of his stomach. The people around him would age, change. Fourteen years from now, he’d still look twenty-five. “Guess I’ve got that to look forward to. Is there, uh—“
Barton kills Natasha.
Eventually, things get personal, as they always do. Thor switches tracks and focuses his attention on Tony.
“I haven’t got much of anything. Maybe she likes music, ‘cos I had a dream kinda like that a bit ago, only,” he thinks of confessing that he knows the dream hadn’t been anything, that no one he’d ever meet could live in a world like the one that he’d imagined, but chickens out, “I don’t remember it all that well, so many not.”
,” he said, “2004.”
“I need you,” he says, his voice low.
he thinks, blearily, feeling nothing but dull surprise,
“Are you doing alright?” Steve asks him, as they rejoin the rest of the team on the trudge back up to the helicopter, and Iron Man nods.
“Dead.” Tony finishes, stepping in front of her. Of course he’s not dead; he can’t be. He hooks the finger of the man’s red glove on his own metal-covered finger and pulls. It comes off slowly, reluctant to loosen a grip it had held for decades, and then all at once with a wet
“I’m so sorry,” Steve said, for lack of anything else to say, “I didn’t know.”
Steve throws the shield in a neat arc, knocking down several attackers at once, and catches it easily just as it behinds to deviate from course. Iron Man pushes himself unsteadily to his feet, taking Steve’s offered hand.
It has to be Steve, doesn’t it? Steve, who’d lied during the game that night, Steve, who can’t have possibly ever sucked dick, and yet— and yet, in the comfort of his fantasy, Tony can pretend he’d known the term, that he’d meant it.
They clear the “invasion” in twenty minutes flat and regroup, standing around to discuss tactics and laugh at Quicksilver for the four times he’d ended up in the nets, unused to the landscape. It’s a shame that all of them miss the little camouflaged centipede bot that crawls out from out of the rocks. It’s a shame that it happens to strike, neatly, right at Steve’s ankle, knocking him down over edge. He’d taken by surprise. He doesn’t start trying to catch himself until it’s too late, and flops, uselessly, into the safety net.
These rules, for the most part, bother Tony less than probably should. For one, Steve Rogers lives by them far less than Captain America does — one is a historical fiction, after all, and the other only human. Sometimes, too, he delights in pushing back against them, lives to coax Steve out of his comfort zone. It’s a delicate, touchy thing for both of them, exhilarating and frustrating in equal measure.
Right now, he only says, “Write her back, Buck, write her back.”
It was an obvious request for elaboration, the kind of statement too polite to be a question but clearly inching in that direction. Tony set his cake down and picked up his mead.
Just like Tony, he tries to fill himself with things, to shove objects in the glaring holes decades in the ice had torn in his life.
“Oh, yes,” Future-Steve told him. “I haven’t aged at all. That’s the serum.”
He likes this, likes that Steve lets him press and probe, likes that he can take Steve’s big, heavy head and push it this way and that, likes feeling his skull under his skin.
Steve has presumably been doing this for a while, and it didn’t ever make it out onto the public record, has never been caught by the press. It’s not even in his SHIELD files, and it would be, if they knew. Tony knows Fury likes to keep blackmail on everyone he interacts with, and he’s hacked into that repository several times, paranoid to know what the man had found on him.
Sulking, at least, is very well suited to quiet cars.
“I didn’t notice.”
With this in mind, Tony calls his secretary and then his tailor. He needs a half-decent reason to drag Captain America along to one of his cocktail parties if he doesn’t want the paparazzi to sniff out how far into the gutter his brain has gone about the man.
“I don’t know what
Right now, four of them — Steve, Janet, and the twins, because Hawkeye is apparently on a SHIELD assignment and Thor hasn’t been reachable in a couple weeks — are facing off against robotic enemies Tony had designed and commissioned a couple weeks ago. For the cheek of it, he’d given them similar faces to the ones Pym had installed on his robots, but the bodies range from humanoid to insect-like, many jointed with long, spiky pincers.
The man’s only answer is a derisive laugh. Steve frowns.
Hank Pym had taken it, and it's labelled in Janet’s neat hand —
So he doesn’t let up with his thighs. He reaches down with one hand and grips Steve’s head from behind, keeping him in place, jerks forward the best he can without losing balance, thrusting against Steve’s throat.
A loud clanging, huge and metallic, sounds outside the window, jolting Tony straight back into reality. She’s on top of him, so he pushes himself up on his elbows to try to look out the window, adrenaline flooding into his veins. “What the hell was that?”
“I can’t take it off,” he says, “I’m horribly scarred underneath, anyhow.”
Hey, you’re probably sick of hearing this, but it’s Tony. Just, uh. Checking in. Didn’t see you at the meeting this morning. I know you get busy. You’re probably—
It’s not a cemetery he visits often. Several fire fighters he’d once worked with are buried here, along with half a dozen men and women he’d known before the ice, soldiers and classmates and schoolteachers. He doesn’t visit any of them in particular.
“He wanted you to come with him.” He said, the question implied in his statement.
“Don’t be a spoilsport, Rogers.” Natasha says, her annoyance showing. She holds her liquor remarkably well; Tony wouldn’t be able to tell, if he didn’t know, that she’d been drinking at all. “We already stopped poker for you.”
It doesn’t stop Steve. The hard lines of his body might as well be steel, as immovable as the frame of the building. It goes straight to Tony’s cock, a throb so sudden it’s a little uncomfortable.
He can’t sleep for a long time, that night, twisting and turning the stem of the clover between his fingers. Uneasy dreams catch up with him in the morning, dreams of huge, dry deserts, of explosions, sending sand and machinery flying into cloudless light-blue skies, the sandy, coarse dust in the air so vivid he can taste it.
Thor leaves first, clapping each of his teammates on the shoulders in turn. Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch don’t bother saying goodbye — Tony wonders if they had, indeed, actually been in battle— and Hawkeye gives a distracted wave as he leaves, his phone at his ear.
“What is it?” He asks, and Bucky only thrusts his arm over. It’s not like him to be rendered speechless, and Steve bends down to look.
“Your turn, Cap,” Tony reminds him.
Tony is about as discrete about it as he needs to be. He stores the various implements he’s collected over the years in a closet within a closet, a little branch off door in his walk-in.
Steve reaches over, seemingly unable to help himself, and picks up a red dildo of enormous proportions. It flops in his hands, almost bouncy.
Steve was asking about the person underneath, but he drops it for the time being.
The flower goes. None of the words he tries afterwards do.
Steve laughs and cups his jaw, instead, kisses him again, quick and playful. “You give me a second here, then.”
“Are you hurt?” Steve asks, letting his fingers explore what he can reach of the chains behind him.
Two nights later, Tony slides the little red crop into Steve’s hands and whispers, close to his ear,
“Did you want to suck my dick so badly last night?” he asks, remembering the
“Bit high stakes,” Steve points out, “for a riddle.”
Tony lets him draw him up into his arms, lets him kiss him, soft and slow, before he draws away. Steve deserves to have this, deserves this moment of sweetness.
And yet he’s gone out of his way to get the attention of Steve Rogers, a man with whom he has about as much in common as an African parrot with a can of sardines. He wants Steve’s attention. If he’s honest with himself, he wants Steve.
“One way or another, you’re going to talk, pretty boy.” He’s dropped his voice, getting into character. He really doesn’t sound like himself anymore.
Sorry, I know you’re not my therapist. Probably no use rambling on about…
No, no. Not Captain America. Not Steve Rogers.
It wouldn’t be so bad if he could act on it, if he could invite Steve out with him to the museum, if there was space for Steve in his complicated web of a life.
“I shouldn’t have put you in that position, Steve.”
“Pardon me, ma’am?” Tony asks. Steve can see his hand hovering over the pocket with his identicard, ready to end the interaction.
When he falls, he falls hard, the world spinning around him. He chokes, motion sick for the first time in his life, and vomits all over the inside of his own helmet. He hasn’t eaten, so it’s liquid, bile and alcohol mixing, the smell of it enough to have him dry heaving again.
It’s a smell that wakes him up at seven the next morning, the smell of flowers.
“I’m not sorry I had a secret identity — that was necessary,—” Tony says carefully, “but I’m sorry I lied. I’m sorry I used it to— to say all kinds of things about myself. I wasn’t thinking it could ever get out.”
“Hello?”
Rogers blinks the question has caught him off guard. “He’s gotten to San Lorenzo,” he says, as though remembering events as he’s saying them, “the dictator is dying. He’s in love with his daughter.”
“Nooope, no, not going there.” Janet downs her drink all at once, choking slightly. No one’s having fun anymore, except maybe Natasha. Tony ought to stop this, play a good host, but—
“Alright,” Steve cuts in, “don’t, then.”
Steve nods shortly, grabbing again for the briefcase.
Tony’s so close to sleep he could imagine he dreams the “love you,” that Steve mutters into his hair.
He feels like he shouldn’t be peeking, but the weight of the mystery is too large to ignore, now. So, deliberately softening his steps, he shuffles over to the door and pushes.
“Oh my God,” he says, quietly, “I— I don’t know what to say.”
Who is he going to have to lie to, now, to protect this same secret? What has he agreed to?
want to prolong this, to keep Steve here, for the last time, in his reach. There’s some addictive about breathing the same air as the man, and it’s intoxicating to get all to himself.
“Mr. Stark isn’t as much of a snob as he says he is,” Iron Man had told him, “I’m sure he’d love to have something like that.” He had sounded like he believed it, and at the time, it’d been easy to agree.
“Who’re you supposed to be,” he’d asked, thumping Steve on the chest with his open palm, “Sir Lazylot?”
His hand comes up to rest on the side of Steve’s face, his fingers calloused and cold. Steve breathes deep and smells machine oil, strawberry milkshake, rich, musky cologne with a note of flowery spice underneath.
“From the young woman last night?”
“But that’s impossible.” He says, glancing over to Tony, who meets his eyes and desperately tries for more muffled words. He’s paler now, his eyes — the exact same shade as the newcomer’s— open wide in some emotion Steve can’t quite read. Surprise? Fear? “Tony Stark is Iron Man. I saw the suit come off.”
“When?” Steve asks. Tony has the feeling he knows.
He’s never called it by its name. No one has ever called it by its name, to him. It’s always been words with a sort of uneasy, low thrumming tension, the negative space around them forming the actual picture.
The suit is physically strong, stronger than Steve, and capable of both firing at attackers and of limited flight in their tight quarters. The man inside is brave, and very familiar with the suit itself, but almost untrained in hand-to-hand combat.
It’s not the first time he thinks about his soulmate upon waking up in the future. It’s not the first time that it occurs to him that he must have left her behind in the past.
And yet, as watching Steve take Janet’s hand in both of his, pressing his lips briefly to her fingers, he feels strangely empty, strangely unsatisfied.
“What?” Steve snaps.
“That’s just a birthmark, Tony,” his mother tells him, gently taking him by the hand and setting said hand down on the couch next to them.
Guess I’m saying easily could have just been sex & I don’t feel that kind of way about it.
In his eyes, Steve sees the returned affection he hadn’t dared to hope for. He doesn’t know what to do with it.
Steve had shrugged, looking self conscious, “I’d rather be safe than sorry. Have this happen on our own terms.”
“Big words,” Cap says, “what are we betting on?”
It makes sense to him. He’s never dreamed anything unusual for a little boy’s dreams; it’s all robots and cars and Captain America. Sometimes, when he closes his eyes, he can imagine a pencil dancing on paper, detailing figures in action, intricate landscapes, delicately shaded flowers, but he doesn’t know whether to add those thoughts up to anything. He’s always wished he could draw, after all, and it’s satisfying to imagine something coming out of nothing.
Nothing but silence answers her.
Tony doesn’t even know if the Hulk
Steve tips forward on his knees, steadying himself with outstretched fingers on the limo’s carpeted floor, and closes his lips on the head of Tony’s dick. The sensation is sharp and startling enough to be near-ticklish, especially when Steve licks up at the slit.
tonight, mister. Don’t bother getting dressed.”
Well. Steve couldn’t do anything about the heart. He couldn’t keep Tony safe, but.
That’s not right. That’s a mistake of humongous proportions. The blueprints were meant to be incinerated. When Tony gets home — if Tony gets home — he’s going to have to investigate the possible sabotage.
“Well, I’ve got yet to see any proof he’s even real,” Steve says, drily amused, “must be a busy, busy man.”
He’s too far away, too uncertain of himself. He enters the bagel store thinking about the Avengers, about the Illuminati, about Tony Stark. He’s got change in hand as he waits in line — this is so routine he knows exactly how much his order will cost — and he doesn’t notice notice that the usual counter girl is out, replaced with a young man he’s never seen before. A few years ago, he thinks, he would have stopped to make conversation with the newcomer. He’d have been thinking team trainings, about the roster, about the day to day, pleasantly banal arrangements which need to be made for his team to exist.
This, naturally, makes Tony grin even wider. “Well, sweet cheeks, I won, and you owe me one.”
Both of them are smarter than that. Both of them will know.
known this was coming, he makes his way to the kitchen, where he blends chunks of mango with nutritional powder and turns on the TV.
Now, in those moments, Steve mostly turns to him.
Tony must have programmed that thing wrong. What a stinking shame.
“Bye, Tony,” Jan echoes, and then they’re gone.
“I don’t expect you to love me back,” Steve says, quietly, “but it’s always been you.”
Tony reaches up to tangle a hand in the soft hair at the back of Steve’s neck, almost too short to grab, and urges him forward.
The kiss is awkward. Steve’s too shocked to close his eyes. Their teeth clang against each other uncomfortably. Tony remembers his morning breath and goes to pull back, but Steve’s hand on his jaw stops him.
Dear Tony,
The girl won’t be anything. Even if she sells her story, which she had seemed a little too sweet to do, “Tony Stark was too drunk to get it up” isn’t a particularly new headline. If anything, it’s exactly a dime a dozen.
For a moment, with Tony playing the role of
“Oh.” He says.
Steve nods back, lets himself flop back, exhausted. He’s already thinking about the meetings he’s missed, the paperwork taking in the new perp, Norman Osborn. He’s already wishing he’d asked Tony to stay, already imagining a reality where he could have.
“Tony,” he breathed, “Jesus Christ, Tony. Are you alright?”
“I’m fine too.”
It hangs in the air, thick and ever-present, and sometimes Steve is convinced everyone else can see it and just doesn’t have the words to bring it up. He dreams, sometimes, of himself covered in handprints, of people pointing and laughing. There goes Captain America. He’s a—
“If this gets out,” Fury says, calmly, “you’re going to be discharged from the army. We are going to fire you. Your apartment is paid for by SHIELD. Your equipment is paid for by SHIELD. Your team is paid for by SHIELD. Do you have friends, Rogers? Is there anyone on whose couch you’re going to be able to crash after that particular revelation?”
“I haven’t.”
“I couldn’t have asked you to stay,” Steve said, “Not if your life was on the line. But I’d miss you, Tony. Not as my boss, or the team’s benefactor, but as a friend.”
the message from him reads,
“I guess,” Bucky says, again, but this time there’s a touch of defiance about it. He shrugs off Steve’s hand and retreats, his hands in his pockets, back to his tent.
“Sir Ian McKellen was on TV, talking about it.”
Like Steve, he’s bound hand and foot, his ankles chained to the feet of the chair, his hands behind him. Unlike Steve, he’s gagged, a long, sparkling green cloth wrapped around his face, more stuffed in his mouth.
but gets no response.
Steve grimaces, then shakes his head. This sends little black pin pricks across his plane of vision, making it hard to see. He’s still dizzy. He’s still drugged. Odd for his metabolism; they must have injected him with something else while he was out, re-upped the dose.
Tony is hunched forward on the bed, his ass up, his face pressed into folded elbows, his body thrumming, every nerve alive. Between blows, Steve runs his hand down his spinal cord, feeling the jut of each bone, and grips the back of his neck. The fine hairs there catch on the rough callouses of Steve’s palm, scratchy against Tony’s recently lotioned skin, and Tony entertains the fantasy of Steve pushing him over, shoving him down, hitting with all his strength, landing the kind of blows Tony has only felt once or twice before, the kind that would break him, Steve making him take it—
“Does that mean you’re going to be stuck in the lab all that time?” The Wasp asked, sounding a little pouty.
The plan is set, then. Tony has made it without him, because Tony had known all the information and held all the cards.
“There’s no guarantee of a later.” Tony says. “Capre diem, right?”
Steve comes back, carrying the wooden chair, and Tony directs him to set it down by the floor to ceiling window on the other side of the room.
Steve doesn’t move. His eyes are still on the television.
“I do,” Steve says, looking up to meet his eyes. His voice breaks on the second syllable, something deep, deep inside him protesting, but it’s Iron Man. It’s Iron Man.
There are two couches in Tony’s comfortable sitting room, both a cheerful yellow that he’s sure he didn’t pick out. They’re both angled towards the television, creating a sort of semi-circle. They also do the job of breaking the four of them into self-contained pairs, Steve with Janet and Tony with Natasha. It’s comfortable, almost ordinary.
Steve sits, wincing slightly. There’s probably no position that’s entirely comfortable.
Steve’s left the bathroom door slightly ajar. Tony follows him, his bare, damp feet sticking unpleasantly to the tile, and finds him sitting on the edge of Tony’s marble bathtub.
Both of them are breathing heavily. Tony tries to match his breaths to Steve’s but keeps falling out of synch, too fast, so he closes his eyes and pretends they’re breathing in tandem anyways. Steve undoes the cuffs on his ankles and the strap around his knees, rubbing at the skin there.
“Make me,” Steve says, without much heat, the lazy, take-it-or-leave-it innuendo that’s so rare with him. Tony rolls his eyes and playacts wrapping the bandages over his mouth instead of his arm.
He tries to sit up.
Months later, he’d sat on the rooftop with Iron Man, arguing about shadows of craters.
Tony reaches over and laces their hands together. He doesn’t say
It’s gone as quickly as it had come, leaving Steve shaky and exhausted. He doesn’t know what just happened; his closest frame of reference is the asthma attacks he used to suffer as a kid, but the pain is new, as it the confusing feeling just before the attack had subsided, the clear understanding that he’d felt electricity rushing through his body.
He steps into the walk in closet, flicks on the lightswitch, shuts the door, opens the inner compartment, stares.
He’s going to marry her, and he’s going to be happy. In the best case scenario, he has four years left to blow, and she’s easy to have fun with. She’s all he could ask for, all he could want.
Right now, he learns that no one with matching has been arrested in the past twenty years in New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Pennsylvania, California, the whole country. He widens his search, though past twenty years, record keeping tends to be sparse, many cases never digitized.
Briefly, he imagines the cocktail party, the tailored suit, showing off Captain America to guests he certainly will never like, imagines seeing where that 20
Tony feels orgasm coming on so suddenly he near misses the time to pull back, and comes in spurts over Steve’s face, fine white lines clinging to his lips, his stubble, his cheeks, his eyelashes. Steve’s a gorgeous mess, his chin covered in shiny, bubbling drool, his eyes a little bloodshot, dark.
And then everything crumbles into darkness.
Someone is sleeping next to him, a man. He’s bare chested, his face turned away from Tony so that he can only see broad shoulders and a mop of blond hair. They’re just barely touching; Tony’s foot is caught between the man’s sleep-heavy ankles.
He doesn’t have a long time to think about it. Less than six hours later, he plummets into the icy waters of the Atlantic. Bucky must get out of this, he thinks, in some far away part of his mind, as he struggles to keep his head above the water, his hair and clothes soaked through, his teeth chattering, Bucky must get out of this, because he’s got a girl waiting for him, someone he’s connected to so strongly. He doesn’t know if he believes it.
They win the fight against the Liberators. Feeling nothing but numb, Tony breaks out the champagne.
“Come home with me,” he says, the exact same request he’d had a year earlier. “Call Jan if you want to. I could use a drinking buddy.”
Steve turns. His nose is broken, and the blood that still sticks stubbornly to his stubble gives him a near-feral look. His eyes flash, catching the light, and for a moment Tony imagines they’ll fight now, the dirty kind of fighting. They keep track of each other’s bodies, each other’s wounds, and unspoken awareness Tony doesn’t want to start dissecting. He knows about the limp, likely caused by the gash in Steve’s lower thigh, which is deep enough Tony’s sure the blade must have hit bone. He knows about the shallow hooked cuts all over Steve’s back. He’d heard the sharp crack of bone when Steve had had used his own arm as lever and broken the metal restraints, and he’d thought,
Tony nods. Steve leaves him alone on one of the cots to wonder why this had been better, in his estimation, than Tony’s comfortable, red plush bed, and then to pour over the implications of what had happened between them.
Steve was used to it.
There’s no one more human than the man in front of him. And this entire time, despite appearances, Steve hadn’t been falling in love with a robot.
Steve’s watching the television. Tony nudges him lightly with his big toe, and asks, playing at a casual voice, “What’d you lie about?”
and pocket the phone.
That shouldn’t surprise Tony — if they’re soulmates, after all, they ought to be compatible — and yet somehow it does. On a whim, giddy with the strangeness of it all, Tony reaches for Steve’s shirt collar and pulls him in.
He’d expected something else, had craved something else, the first time they’d fallen into bed together, had imagined feeling the same kind of way he feels fighting Steve hand-to-hand; every muscle overworked and raw, every emotion pulled out forcefully from his chest, uncoiled, examined, the ugliest of both of them laid bare. He had imagined feeling the way that he felt when they trained together in the gym, seen and understood, just a touch inadequate. He had pictured Steve’s big, calloused hands leaving bruises on his skin, imagined Steve’s face cause somewhere between passion and distaste, and weakness, imagined dragging Steve down with him into uncertain territory.
Again, his words settle in the pit of Steve’s stomach, hot and upset.
“They wouldn’t believe that,” he says, with conviction he doesn’t feel. The war is too fresh, too recent, too real.
Tony stops short, unease clear on his face.
He wonders what it says about him that, even now, he can’t quite call it by its name.
God, his eyes hurt. His eyes hurt so bad.
and “
On the Ultimates, he strikes up lazy conversation with the Pyms, both of whom he finds interesting to bounce off in training exercises but mostly boring in life. Nick Fury is funny when he wants to be and a pain in the ass as necessary, a quality Tony can respect without liking.
It’s nice, he realizes, to do it this way. Steve knows his body, know what pleasure looks like on him, knows how his face contorts in pain. The hazy, warm feeling of both comes over him, red-hot but secure, he can feel without even looking at Steve that they’re on the same page, that Steve understands.
He picks up the shield, its familiar edge slotting so perfectly into his hand that he must have been made for this, he watches the shield whiz over him, its silver underside blurring in his vision, feels the walls shake through the floor as it hits and reverberates, feels the floor shake as two men fall, gunshots, catches the shield, Jesus, who is that, isn’t he Tony Stark—
So he doesn’t assume much.
He closes his eyes. Steve has been all too present in his head for the past couple of days. Past couple of weeks. The months he’s been out of the ice. He’s overwhelming, too bright, too loud. He leaves Tony feeling like there’s no space for himself in his mind anymore, like every little impulse, every stray thought — the burger and fries, see if she needs help, choose the blue, go get some fresh air, maybe the museum this weekend — can be assigned to Steve.
By the time he finally meets Tony at the doors, he’d been saying goodbye for an hour. Many guests are filtering out now — the older crowd, high strung early risers, the group of women in red dresses, apparently anxious to get away from someone’s advances.
even on the girls’ one. “Neat.”
Tony suspects Cap’s are worse than his own.
“The Wasp did say you had a thing for, uh. For Cap.” He doesn’t say ‘for me,’ and Tony wonders why not. If anyone is the same inside and out, in their mask and outside of it, it has to be Steve Rogers.
At this point, outside of his own body, spread between two consciousnesses and none at all, he doesn’t know anymore. Darkness pulls at him, and he heeds its call.
“Cap,” Tony says, on an exhale, his voice a little high, tense.
They have the best sex of their relationship that night, with her on top of him, his wrists bound to the headboard. She forces him to stay in the moment, her nails digging hard into his skin. It’s not callousness, he tells himself; this is calculated. She cares, and this is how she shows it, her way of taking care of him.
He sees himself on his knees, sees Steve grabbing his hair, pulling, slamming, sees Steve picking him up and fucking him, sloppy and unprepared and painful, almost splitting him in two. He sees Steve hitting him with his full strength, leaving Tony feeling nothing but pain, and he likes the thought, wants it.
« Where are you? »
"Yes, maybe it's time to let him in, don't you think?"
« Wait, did you just say that it was your last mission? »
« What did you say? »
« Nope. You’re only Rogers when you act like a baby. »
Steve turns his head and smiles. « You know what Romanoff? » he replies.
Flashbacks and short images cross his mind. Plane. Him as a pilot. The ocean approaching quickly as he plows into it. Water, so much water, too much. He is going to crash, he is going to-
"Okay, dad."
Two hours later, all the Avengers have arrived. Laughs and discussions are mixing in the air.
He feels ridiculous, even childish. Of course, Steve won’t answer, he is not here. However, deep down, Tony really hopes for a sign. His biggest dream right now is to receive a message saying: « I’m heading back home. » He puts his head in his hands, to escape reality. It’s been one month but it feels like an eternity for Tony. Steve’s shape has nearly disappeared from the mattress. His scent is lost in the air. Dust starts dropping off his clothes in the wardrobe. Tony closes his eyes.  Maybe it’s just a dream. Maybe he will wake up in a few seconds, Steve sleeping next to him. The bed is so cold. Every day, Tony wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, as if his subconscious was looking for Steve too. He feels so empty. Maybe he cried so much that all his feelings have been removed from his heart, from his chest. He feels like nothing could make him happy again, as if happiness has even never existed. He feels… a warm hand on his back?
« Steve, where are you? »
« Round 2. »
« I woke up… - He looks at the ground like a boy being grounded by immediately looks up at Nat again. He walks toward her and climbs on the couch and sits on her knees. - Say that you’ll stay aunt Nat! We need you here! »
« Yerk, it’s too salty. »
« Don’t you dare say it’s nothing. I can feel it and it’s not. You have to trust me, Tony. We’re a pair.»
« Hey, don’t be silly. And don’t get used to it. What’s rare is even more precious, you know. »
Steve pulls him into a tight hug. Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s torso and buries his face in Steve’s neck. Steve runs a hand in Tony’s messy hair.  Both don’t matter how long they stay like this. Tony just wants to enjoy their proximity, when Steve focuses on Tony’s breathing, stroking his hair to calm him down. After a while, Tony’s breathing is finally back to normal. He places his hands on Steve’s chest and gently pulls him away. Steve looks at him, worried. Tony notices it, and appeases him:
« Yes, it- wait, what? »
Ignoring Tony, Steve focuses on the stranger. He looks at him right in the eyes, hoping it will make him feel as bad as possible.
« I want to go with you on your missions. »
« I ran away cause I needed to sort out my feelings, not because I didn’t want you! »
« Let’s take a look around then. Go check the rooms I’ll check outside»
(See the end of the chapter for
"Wait Steve come back!"
He starts walking out. But as he is about to reach the door, he stops and without looking back at Steve, says: « I think I’ll need a shower after this. - he turns his head and gives Steve a look that immediately wakes up his body - and I think you’re going to join me » Then he leaves.
Steve scowls and starts mumbling under his nose. Tony could only catch words like « worst husband ever » and « I’m not a baby. »
« Gosh, it feels so good! » That’s what went through Steve’s mind as hot water hit his skin. It had been a pretty rough day. Despite what people could think, protecting the planet was much more than a part-time job. All day long, he had to run from one end of the city to another, arresting criminals and protecting everyone. Reaching behind him, he tries to catch the shower gel. The stiffness he feels will take a few days to calm down. Maybe he’ll need to massage his muscles with oil. He can’t afford to be in pain while fighting, it would only distract him and he needs to stay focused in order to stay alive. He looks at his arm, where an open wound could be spotted. He was lucky today. One centimeter to the left and it would have been his heart. He is eligible for another of Tony homily, even though he knows that Tony only does it because he worries about him. He lets out a sigh. He will have to face his husband sooner or later. But right now, Tony isn’t home. He’s probably still working at the Avengers HQ, updating his suits or improving Nat’s spy gadgets. Thank God, it will give him time to treat the wound and maybe cook dinner for his lover. He can’t tell when was the last time they did this, just spending time together. Steve’s face turns dark. The last time he and Tony spoke was three days ago. Between his job and Tony’s, they can’t see each other, much less talk. When Steve leaves, Tony comes back from a busy night and when Steve finally heads back home, Tony is already gone again. He can’t even remember the last time they had a full conversation or just more than the « -morning honey. -bye, sweetheart» dialogue. Maybe it’s time to talk to Fury, just to see if they could reach an agreement on getting his old life back. Suddenly, he hears a rumble outside. Before Steve could get out of the shower, all lights switch oﬀ. Steve holds his breath. He hates being in the dark. Too many bad memories come back to haunt him. He tries to get out of the shower but he slips and grabs the shower’s thermostat, turning the water to freezing cold. « SHIT! » He hates to cuss but the situation allows it for once. His body starts shaking. The cold water and the darkness surrounding him remind him of the crash. No, he can’t think about this. Not now. He has to get out of here. He has to- He is in the plane again. Millions of tons of water crush him. He tries to breathe but water seeps in his nose and he is unable to spit it out. He feels the coldness feeling his body, reaching as deep as his soul. He feels every single cell freezing. Half conscious of his actions, Steve pushes the shower’s door. He catches his towel. He has to turn the light on. But it’s too dark, and he is so cold. Too weak to support him, his legs give way. He falls on the tiles and can’t seem to stand up again. Totally petrified, he rolls up into a ball and starts crying. He doesn’t want to be strong anymore. He only want to be protected. His wound hurts, and his current position doesn’t make it any better. He is so tired. He doesn’t know how he managed to hold everything for so long. Now that everything comes back to him, it’s as though nothing can save me now. He just stays there, crying silently.
"Are you ready Steve?"
« It’s…okay…just…need…you… »
Tony makes a step back, in shock. It’s the first time he hears Steve screaming. He looks at the man. « You better go heal your nose. I’ll call you later. »
« Do you want some? »
"You could have saved me, Tony."
He is prepared. He’s going to fight.
No response.
« Don’t worry I am fine. I just need to go to the bathroom in order to look human again »
« Log me in Jarvis. »
Clint walks to the kitchen. A delicious cake smell is floating in the air. Judging by the smell of lemon, it must be Pepper's famous lemon and ginger cake. Glass noises resonate. The tower of the Avengers, usually so quiet, is for one evening the scene of festivities. After all, it is not every day that they can celebrate the fall of Hydra. Arriving at the door, Clint glances around the room and localizes Nat, sitting on a stool. She seems to be in the middle of a discussion with Carol. Clint smiles. He sincerely hopes that their relationship will evolve. They both deserve it.
"Pete, go and sit with aunt Nat okay sweetheart?" murmurs Steve at Peter’s ear.
« Listen, Nat. We are worried about you. Peter told us he saw you crying. »
« STEVE! ANSWER ME! »
« Steve… » Tony begs.
Tony grabs it and returns to the bedroom. Steve hasn’t moved. He is still trembling and bleeding. Tony knows that Steve probably can’t hear him but he tries to talk to him, to get him to calm down.
« Actually, she doesn’t need to get her stuff… » he murmurs.
« She’ll be okay kiddo. I promise. » Tony appeased the worried child, a hand on his shoulder.
Steve smiles. That’s how it should be. Or at least, that’s how it should have been. But reality is often disappointing and this is no exception. He is back in the street, covered with blood and dust. He tilts his head down and looks at the broken iron suit laying at his feet. The little scene he had just imagined disappears, and well as his hope. Why can’t it be this way? His whole world is falling apart, including the people he loves. Nat never came to live with them. He didn’t marry Tony. Peter isn’t their son. He glances around him. Everything is just fire. Buildings are collapsing from all sides. There, across the street, Nat's body is still visible under the rubble. « It’s okay,» she said, «I’m going to protect you ». She kissed him softly on the cheek and without any last word, jumped in front of their enemy. And now, she is gone. Steve feels tears going down his jawline, mixing with the dust and mud drying on his cheeks.  Nearly, a bomb explodes. Steve throws himself on Tony's body to protect him. When he looks up again, another building is gone.  He presses his forehead on the cold metal.
52nd? Does it mean that… No, it can’t be. Not so fast. Steve turns his head. A huge 40th is placed on the wall.
« STE- »
« I huh... I was worried for you Tony. » Steve answers softly. « I don’t know... I feel like it’s been a while now that I have the feeling that something’s wrong and... » He stops three seconds, looking like he is looking for words. « And I was wondering if I could help you. I know it’s not always easy being us and Nat told me you’ve gone through a lot. I really appreciate you Tony and maybe huh... »
"Yes, it was daddy."
« And Auntie Nat… Auntie Nat will be here tonight right? » he whispered, his voice suddenly trembling.
"What?"
And right before Tony takes off, a tear falls on the floor.
Steve smiles. « Eternity with you, it sounds like a good deal. » He wraps his arms tighter around his lover. Yeah, eternity seems definitely great to him. It seems perfect. After all, who wouldn’t want to feel at home forever?
He cleans it with cotton. Thank God, it is only superficial. No need to call an ambulance. Carefully, he bandages Steve’s arm and covers him with the comforter again. He goes to the kitchen and fills him a glass of water. Steve has been sweating too much and he wants to prevent dehydration. Not without difficulty, Steve drinks it all. He is so pale. His head drops again on the pillow. Tony feels helpless, watching his better half battling against fever. Tears start forming at the corner of his eyes. Seeing Steve like this is the most heartbreaking thing he’s ever noticed. He looks so frail as if a single touch could break him to pieces. He gently strokes Steve’s hair. He wishes he could take all his pain away.
« LANGUAGE! » Peter screams.
That was all they asked for. To rest.
"I know it is supposed to bring bad luck but... you look absolutely splendid."
Listening to the voice, Tony lets air coming through his nose again.
Five minutes later, Tony is alone in bed, waiting for Steve to finish showering. He still can’t get over how desperate his husband looked when he woke up earlier.
« Tony, we have already talked about this. I refuse. Having you on the field would only be a distraction for me and I can’t take the risk of losing you. It’s a no, definitely a no. »
« Stay… »
« I love you too Pete »
« Can we stay like this a little longer? » he supplies.
« Steve, what is it? I have never seen you like this. It’s not like you, you’re so strong and- »
« No. We can handle the meeting by ourselves. I think for once in their lives they deserve to be in peace. » answered Nat, smiling while looking at this strange scene. « We’ll call them after. They need to rest. »
They stay silent for a while, both in thoughts.
Tony laughs. Steve looks so lost, looking at him with a confused frown. He is so happy to see him fine again. He regained some colors and he is not sweating anymore.
« I’m going to check on Pete and Nat, see if everything is okay and try not to get killed by the greatest assassin on Earth. If I don’t come back in five minutes, don’t worry I’m probably dead. »
« Hey, hey, hey, stop this, look at me » Steve said, taking Tony’s cheeks with his hand while holding Peter with the other. « I refuse to hear you talking about you like this. Tony, you’re the most carrying person I know. Yes, you made mistakes, we all did. But after all, you tried to repair them and this is my proof that you are a good person. And if Peter has to become slightly like you, I would be the happiest dad and husband in the world. I love you Tony. Nothing can change that. Not even you. »
, two random bitches drunk of their asses, then it makes sense that you don’t notice anything about me.” Tony opened his mouth to continue, but Steve stood, staring him down.
Thankfully Steve didn’t say anything else. At least, not until they were sitting on the little couch facing the TV, watching the first channel that had come on.
Following Steve’s instructions, Tony sat up as Steve knelt down next to the couch, in between Tony’s legs. Tony reached down to try and undo some of the buttons on Steve’s shirt, but Steve grabbed his wrist and pushed it back. “Not tonight. You’ve gotta learn to let someone else take care of you for once.” Steve had been generally looking at Tony throughout, but it was at this moment that he looked Tony directly in his eyes and continued, “You’re gonna let me take care of you right now, right? And then, after this, you’ll start talking to me like normal and let me take care of that, too. You don’t have to hide everything away.” Steve ducked his head down, licking the head of Tony’s dick and teasing the slit. Tony moaned and strained against Steve’s grip on his wrist. Steve only held down harder. “Am I clear?” Tony squirmed and nodded, sighing as he said, “Ahh, yes!” At that, Steve took Tony’s dick in his mouth and swallowed it to the base, the head touching the back of Steve’s throat. Tony exclaimed another, “Ahh!” as he was encompassed in Steve’s warm, soft mouth. Steve swallowed around it again, the contractions stimulating Tony and making him jerk his hips forward. Steve pulled back and went down again, using his mouth and tongue in tandem. He took Tony in deeply for another few moments before pulling him out and licking along the side, stroking his dick with his hand. Steve smiled as Tony continued to buck into his grip, enjoying how much Tony was really letting his guard down. Steve replaced his hand with his mouth again and reached up to pinch Tony’s left nipple again, drawing a gasp and moan from him. Steve used his other hand to palm himself through his jeans.
dignity. Obviously now, it had been for naught. When Steve pulled back, he smiled at Tony and made sure to look him in the eyes as he dropped his hips, grinding his own clothed dick against Tony’s. Tony groaned and wiggled his hips back and forth, looking for
“A ch – ugh, it’s useless talking about this with you. It’s whatever. It’s fine! I’m in the hotel up ahead, I thought we could relax up there but there’s no point now.”
“Tony, thank you, but you really didn’t have to get involved. It’s not like they’re hurting me or anything,” Steve began as they left the place. “They only wanted a picture.”
“Um…excuse me you’re…aren’t you Mr. Ste – oh, my bad, you don’t like being called by your
When Tony’s dick hardened and jolted in his mouth, Steve pulled back and stopped touching Tony. Tony groaned at the sudden disappearance of stimulation. “Come on, don’t do that to me, Steve.” He practically whimpered. “I’m not that far off.” Steve nodded and smiled, but sat next to Tony. He gestured for Tony to bring his legs back up onto the couch and Tony complied. Steve had Tony lay his legs across his lap, and pushed his chest back so he leaned against the arm of the sofa. Steve took Tony’s dick in his hand again and smiled as he said, “Sorry for the delay. I decided I want you to cum while I have you like this, instead.” With that, Steve started stroking him quickly. One hand worked his dick while the other moved to stroke the inside of his thighs. Tony was overwhelmed with the moment, naked physically and emotionally. It felt like Steve was looking right into him with his piercing gaze. Tony tried to look away but when he did, Steve immediately released his dick and grabbed his cheeks, pulling his face back toward him. “You have to look at me if you want me to continue, Tony.”
« Yeah, talking about that, you’re really a bad judge Rogers. I mean, look at the merchandise,» he says ironically, frowning his nose and pointing at himself.
They enter the room. The door closes…only to better reopen 3 seconds later, literally exploding under Steve's power.
Without him noticing, Tony had come closer and kisses him on the cheek.
Tony frowns. « There’s nothing to answer Steve. I understood. You don’t love me I get it. No need to run away once more. »
« Shit… »
« I am terribly sorry sir... »
« She is part of the team buddy so yes she is coming. Why are you asking that? »
He tries to escape but Steve is too strong and he blocks him with his legs. A little sadistic faint smile crosses his face. When it comes to teasing Tony, he never lacks imagination. He loves to push him to the limit, to get him down on his knees. He knows he should probably give Tony what he wants, but he loves to play with him more. Burying his face in Tony’s neck, he starts suckling onto his skin, perfectly aware of how sensitive Tony is there. He makes his way to his ear and nibbles on it. He can hear Tony’s heavy breath. He is still moving his hips and he knows that finish him off this way. He goes back to Tony’s face and nibbles on his lips. Tony’s moans electrify him. Their skins touch, move away, meet again, merge. Everything they fear, everything they keep deep down comes to the surface and feed their mutual passion. The outside world doesn’t exist anymore. The world could be burning and they wouldn’t care. It’s just the two of them, two husbands meeting again after a long time being away from each other. Steve sets Tony free, only to remove his underwear. He is going to explode if he doesn’t touch him right now.
Even though Tony is faking it, Steve hears the pain in his voice. It breaks his heart, to see Tony suffer and to know that he caused it. That’s why he can’t wait any longer. With one step, he walks the few centimeters that separate him from Tony. Gently, he takes his face in his hands and presses his lips against Tony’s. It’s Tony’s turn to freeze. He doesn’t know how to react. He doesn’t know if he wants to forgive Steve. But the sensation of Steve’s lips against his - this sensation -  is the best thing he has ever felt. Steve doesn’t just kiss him. He tastes him, taking everything to his soul. Steve is in heaven. The softness of Tony's skin under his fingers, the warmth of his lips, the proximity of their bodies... Steve feels like he only lived for this moment. He bites Tony’s lower lip gently, and Tony lets out a moan. Suddenly, he pushes Steve away, breathing loudly.
« Nat wait. - Steve grabs her arm gently and pulls her back on the couch - you know, we have a huge apartment. And Peter loves you a lot. »
« Will it be ok sir? »
« Okay, okay, if you don’t want to… »
Clever boy. Tony can’t believe how mature Peter can be sometimes despite his young age.
Sometimes, he wishes they could have met earlier. Maybe he wouldn’t have suffered that much if they did. Now, all he can do is protect him from ever getting hurt again. Without warning, Steve grabs his arms and turns him over. He gently bites his nape and licks his shoulder blade.
