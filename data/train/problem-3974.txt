“Well, happy birthday Sam. I’m 17. I’m also home alone. Wanna come in?” she asks, looking up at him through her eyelashes.
Dean considers how to answer. “I might have drove faster than usual because I was excited about seeing you. I ….didn’t know this was going to happen. It’s earlier than usual.”
“Sam...please. I need you...fuck me.” she pleads, her eyes glassy and a thin sheen of sweat on her skin.
Dean smiles. “I liked it too. I think it’d be fun to do it again. Just tell me when and where, and we’ll go.”
The buzz of the dryer catches them both off guard. They had forgotten they were waiting on Dean’s clothes to finish. Castiel grabs the clothes and brings them over to him. Much to his surprise, Dean strips right there at the table, changing back into his own clean and dry clothes.
“I see. I’m very sorry to hear that, sir. Let me go check on your order and I’ll be back shortly.” he says, walking away.
“Okay, then why don’t you just come home with me and eat supper with us tonight. I can drive you home after.”
“Then that’s what you should do.” Bobby says, grinning and patting him on the shoulder as he stands up.
Dean looks over the test and starts filling in his answers. Once done, he goes back and double checks his answers before walking to the front of the room and setting his paper on Ms. Tucker’s desk.
He doesn’t move from the spot as his body rejoices at being still after all the exertion it was put through today. A few minutes later, there’s a knock at Cas’ door. Annoyed, he leaves the warmth of his bed and opens the door. He’s surprised to see Rowena standing in his doorway.
“I really am sorry about...how things went with us in the past. I know you said it’s okay and you forgive me, but I needed to say I honestly apologize. I, uh. I started going to therapy and I’ve learned some things about myself. It’s hard for me to open up and be vulnerable with people. Especially new people. And especially when it’s someone….I’m interested in. So, when I didn’t know how to talk to you, I turned it sexual. And I knew it was wrong, I realized you were a priest but I did it anyway. My therapist says I have an impulse control issue. And that I often use that to hide behind. I also have self-destructive tendencies. Which I use to push people away because of my fear of being rejected. Sorry, I’m sure you don’t wanna hear about all my baggage and issues.”
Dean holds out his arm expectantly for Gabriel to join him and Gabriel makes his way to stand beside Dean.
Castiel puts his head down and feels tears well up in his eyes. His mind reels with everything that had led up to him deciding to ‘Marry Jesus’ as Gabriel had put it.
Dean hums, with a smile as Cas pulls away. He caresses Cas’ cheek then kisses him, licking against his lips before they part granting him entry.
Sam had thought the nightmares were over. He thought he’d put what had happened in the past, behind him and left it there. He’d even been okayed to go off his meds, was out of therapy and doing great, thank you very much. Then John had to show up and bring it all crashing back down.
Dean and Castiel finally get to have a night alone after they've both confessed their feelings for each other.
Considering his words, Dean realizes that ‘yeah that seems about the right time frame’. “Yeah, actually.”
Dean was the one who found him a few days later in the same state and he reacted the same as Bobby had every day before then- Gently directing Sam towards fresh clothes and encouraging him to go shower. When he came back to his room after the shower he once again came back to freshly changed and re-made bedding. Dean, like Bobby, never mentioned it outside of the moment.
“I gotta say, I wouldn’t wanna be on the receiving end of the ass whipping you just gave out.” Benny adds, while Dean and Cas nod in agreement.
“Uh...” Sam clears his throat and tries to focus. “We head back to the bunker. I’ll keep trying Dean’s cell and you keep trying Cas. We’ll go from there.” he answers, walking back to the truck he’d stolen earlier.
“Hey smartass, did you even grab the pictures?” Dean’s face falls and Castiel takes off running. Laughing maniacally, fully aware he probably looks like a lunatic. But also, he hasn’t this much fun in years. He gets back to his own front door and reaches for- “DAMMIT!” he says out loud to himself.
An older woman who looks to be in her 60’s glares right back at Dean. Eyeing both men as she takes her seat, two tables over from them. A slightly younger man sits across from her, talking on the phone.
“Really, does that mean you want me to fuck you, Alpha?” Dean asks, teasingly grinding against Cas. The scent of firewood fills the Omega’s nostrils and he smirks.
“Alright well, you already know what I do. I guess when I’m not working I like to go for long drives and just listen to music.”
“Well, Castiel not much of a drinker are you?” he smiles nodding towards the still full shot glass of whiskey sitting in front of him.
Castiel casts his eyes down again and he picks at a fingernail. “I like talking to you...but would you mind if I write some more first?” he asks shyly.
Leaning forward slowly, Castiel places a soft kiss against his cheek. Then another along his jaw. Another still, on his neck. He gently takes his chin in his hand before faintly brushing his lips against Dean’s, hoping to get a response. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“If you give me your number then I can call you when I get up. It doesn’t take very long for me to get ready. But, seriously, you really don’t have to.”
“Alright, you brought this on yourself.” Dean says, snatching him up and easily tosses him over his shoulder.
“Oh, um..I appreciate that too, man it’s just...I’m not actually 18 yet. Won’t be for another month, so I doubt they’d hire me.”
Cas locks his hand in Dean’s hair, pulling gently. Waves of pleasure come over Dean and he moans into Cas’ mouth.
“Apparently Chuck wants to watch us roaming around the Earth- alone for the rest of our days. That’s our punishment for not giving in to what he wanted,” Sam says, “We reached out to you, by the way. You never answered.”
“Smartass.” Dean says, shaking his head. He takes a bite of asparagus, chews and swallows. “So, um..where do we go from here?” he asks, a more serious tone in his voice.
Cas pulls him close and presses their lips together. “I thought we could have our own make-out session. But I prefer more privacy.” he says, against Dean’s mouth.
This is my first event and I'm so excited to get feedback! I poured my heart and soul into this project and I'm so proud of the finished product. I sincerely hope this story gives you as much warmth and comfort as it did for me to create it.
“I don’t know what time you have to be home, but the beach is only about 40 miles from here.” Castiel offers.
To his surprise, he sees Sam slipping on his shoes in the living room. “You’re up early. Where ya headed? Library won’t open for another hour, right?”
Dean nearly chokes on his beer as his cheeks flush pink. Coughing for a solid minute, he finally clears his throat,“Uh, Jack….we should really have a talk later.”
Dean’s anger was turning into something else. The tension was still thick in the air between them. He now felt unable to look away from Cas’ blue eyes. He licked his lips and gulped. The animalistic yearning began to consume him. “You just what? He asked. His anger was once again defused by his body’s complete betrayal. It was the familiar lustful urge he had had to fight off over and over.
“Yeah. Don’t get me wrong, I’m thankful for the pay and that it’s not back-breaking work. It’s just a little TOO simple. Mindless, like you barely have to pay attention to what you’re doing. Leaves too much time for your mind to wander. Or maybe that’s just me.”
“Get naked.” Dean says, as he does the same. Once they’re both completely bare, Dean climbs over his Alpha, turning around then bending over, to where the Omega’s ass is right above Cas’ mouth.
“I don’t know if Billy would agree with you on that.” Dean chuckles. “But nah, we all do what we gotta do. Just apparently one of the newer hires didn’t pan out, so….” he shrugs. “It happens, it’ll get worked out.”
He simply nods. Their lips meet and then Dean eagerly takes Cas’ tongue into his mouth. Cas is tremendously aroused by the burning hot wetness. Dean starts sucking and pulling on it, and whimpering moans escape from Cas that vibrate Dean’s mouth.
“Yeah, he just texted. Says he’s staying the weekend at Eileen’s and he’ll be back monday afternoon. He’ll probably be packing up his stuff when he gets here.”
“Well, we kinda have a random variety. Some horror, rom-coms, scifi. I think a little of everything really.”
Castiel standing so close now, the Alpha scent fills the Omega’s lungs. Dean feels even more slick gush out with another moan. This time wetting through his boxers and probably even into his jeans.
His heart is starting to crack, ready to shatter. His hope is being rapidly replaced by doubt. ‘Of course he doesn’t love you. He’s too good for you. How could you ever think you are good enough to even deserve his love anyway?’
“The times I have observed you while sleeping, you seem restless. Sometimes you talk in your sleep and cry out. Knowing you, I assume these are most likely nightmares about the people you couldn’t save.”
“You will NOT come into MY home and talk to ANYONE like that. But you SURE as hell won’t be talking to these boys like that!” Bobby growls furiously right in John’s face.
“Uh-oh. Is that LOVE I sense in the air?” Gabe says, wiggling his eyebrows and grinning knowingly at them.
“Thanks. Cas...I know we started kinda, kinda messed up. But I’d like to get to know you. I mean, like talking and actual real conversations. Do you think maybe...that’d be okay?”
Cas feels like he is being stabbed in the heart. He can’t stand seeing Dean in pain. He lovingly puts his arm around Dean’s shoulders and scoots even closer until there is no more space left between them. He firmly but gently grabs Dean’s jaw and pulls his face back towards him. “You wanna know how I feel?” he asks. Dean nods softly as the tears turn into deep sobs. Cas sees heartbreak on Dean’s face.
Desperately trying to catch his breath, he looks down and is immediately filled with horror. The pillow he’d been hiding his erection behind now has his release soaking into the fabric. ‘Sonofabitch!’
Slowly, the new starts to wear off with Cas and Dean, but it shifts instead to comfortable and reliable. Some nights Cas still sits with Jack and talks but others, he stays with Dean. Sometimes they talk and laugh and just enjoy each other’s company long into the night. Other times, Dean falls asleep earlier than he means to and Cas stays with him anyway. He finds often that his presence and warmth results in a more peaceful rest for Dean.
A little while later, Jack is sitting on his bed, staring at the wall. Tears trickle down his cheeks as he desperately wishes he still had his grace.
Jack swallows his bite before answering. “Sam said you guys needed more time to talk about things. So, I figured there was some dumb argument again that you guys were trying to work through.”
He sits up and looks at him again. Not breathing, no movement. His hand trembles as he reaches out and places his hand over Cas’. Glancing back at Cas’ face, still nothing.
“You’re certainly welcome to grace us with your handsome face anytime, as far as I’m concerned.” Gabe adds.
Sam sighs, then shrugs. “He says he’s sorry and he understands and is ‘on board.’ Guess we’ll see if he really means it.”
Both breathing hard, Dean brushes a fingertip over Cas’ lips. Cas’ eyes flick down to Dean’s mouth then back up again to find desire written on his face. Cas slides his tongue out and licks the tip of Dean’s finger. Dean feels his erection brush greedily push out of the front hole of his boxers and rubbing against the thick, rough material of his jeans.
Thankfully, by the time Dean comes out of the bathroom the sound of John snoring on the couch fills him with relief.
‘god, kill me now.’ Dean thinks. ‘See, he doesn’t know how to answer you because you’ve embarrassed yourself thinking he actually likes you.’
“It’s okay, Sammy.” he says, petting his hair and wrapping his arms around him. Once Sam calms down, he falls asleep. Dean manages to lay him down and cover him up, reaching for the phone. He takes a deep breath then dials. It rings twice before he gets an answer. “Bobby, it’s Dean.” he says, attempting to keep his voice even.
“Yes, just like this Alpha. Need you. Please fuck me. Give me that perfect huge knot inside my wet tight hole and fucking paint my insides with your cum, baby.”
He’d even started getting to know Pam and he and Gabriel started to get closer. Thankful for his second chance at life, he made sure to tell his brother and sister-in-law how grateful he was that they had been there and willing to help him get back on his feet.
Castiel looks up at him, no longer holding his notebook. “Sorry, sat too long. My butt went numb.” Dean says, chuckling.
“No, ‘s okay. Hell, I’d like to have what they have someday myself. Thought I had at one point, but...apparently I was wrong.” he says, seeming to regret finishing his sentence as he downed the only remaining shot of tequila on the table.
The Alpha tilts his hips and speeds up his thrusts. Hitting Dean’s prostate with quick deliberate thrusts.
Dean tries to hide the grin attempting to creep across his face. “I haven’t seen you in here before. First time?”
are,” he says confidently, pointing between him and his brother. Eyes glancing at Cas, momentarily before looking back to Chuck.
Dean walks over and leans against the fridge. “I slept fine.” he replies. “So did you wake up hungry?” he asks chuckling.
Dean tries not to think about seeing Cas after work. However, his job consists of simple repetition and barely requires any thought or concentration. So, of course, his entire shift is spent imagining how well or badly things might go. Remembering how painfully awkward their conversation had been yesterday at the gas station, he worries about making a fool of himself tonight.
Sam half grins at her, taking her hand in his. “Thanks. By the way, have I told you lately that you’re incredible?” he asks, scooting over and brushing her hair behind her ear.
“You’re not gettin’ rid of me that easy. Just wondered if you’d had a chance to think about what you wanna do next.”
“Okay, fine I said I’m sorry. Now let me the fuck go!” he demands, trying to free himself from Jess and Jo.
“Okay. Well, Castiel thanks again for the beautiful pictures. I don’t think you’ll have any trouble finding more work here.”
Tears slip down Sam’s cheeks and he brushes them away. He feels hopeless. He tries to convince himself that Chuck is lying, but he knows better. Besides, why would Chuck lie when he knows the truth hurts worse? He decides to put aside the betrayal he feels from Jack and Cas keeping the deal a secret from them. He knows it won’t help anything now to focus on things they can’t change.
Dean laughs. “Hell yeah it was enjoyable.” Feeling a little less drained but drowsy now, he climbs up and lays beside Cas again.
Fully expecting to find it empty, Dean’s surprised to see Castiel already there when he comes upon the creek.
Sam scoffs, closing his eyes tightly before looking back at Jack. “How could he make a deal like that?!”
“Dean? …..Cas?” Running out of places to check, Sam’s sense of panic increases with each additional moment. “Cas? Dean!?” He calls out, still a few more rooms to go. Getting a sense of something not quite right, he tries calling Dean’s cell again. He realizes he can hear it ringing. It's coming from the archives room. The door is open and surprisingly, so is the hidden entryway for the dungeon. “Dean?” he calls out again, peeking inside. He walks in, following the sound, when he spots it. Dean’s phone is lying on the ground beside the wall. Picking it up, he looks around at the empty room. His mind is reeling. “Where the hell could he be?” he says out loud.
‘Okay here goes’ he tells himself finally. “Cas, I …” his eyes clamp shut and he takes a deep breath before shamelessly returning his attention to Cas. Cas moves his hand away and shifts in his seat, his body facing Dean now. “Are you sure you’re alright?” Cas insists. Dean smiles weakly before shyly darting his eyes straight ahead.  “Can I ask you a question?” his heart beats wildly as he approaches the subject he hadn’t found the courage to address until now.
Dean closes the door and that’s when he notices the door handle is still locked and won’t latch. Climbing in a chair, he puts the chain on the door. He pushes the chair firmly against the door to hold it closed.
Dean throws his head back, downing the rest of his beer, then quickly stands and leaves the table without a word.
His smile causes Castiel’s heart to flutter. “I think I might be able to help with that. I’m sure I have something you can wear. We’ll wash your clothes then you can change back into them before taking the pictures over.” He presses a kiss against Dean’s forehead, then smiles at him.
“Come on Jack, don’t get all ‘godly’ and mysterious on us now. God or not, you’re still our family.” Dean says.
“We’re finally free, Sammy!” Dean agrees with a grin. His eyes glance to Cas before then darting his eyes away quickly when Cas’ eyes meet his gaze.
“No, it’s nice. Better than any place me and Sam have ever stayed. And we really appreciate it man.” Dean adds.
Holding Dean’s hips firmly, Cas pulls back. They both pant, breathing heavily. “Dean, I-I want you.”
“I think we need just a little more time. Oh, and you don’t have to bother with the glasses. We’re just going to drink from the bottles.” Castiel answers.
Stroking quickly and biting his fist, he thinks about the way Castiel’s thigh felt against his. He pictures Castiel riding his cock, eyes closed as he holds himself up with his palms flat against Dean’s chest. Suddenly on instinct, his head falls back and knocks against the door. His heart jumps into his throat as he stops mid stroke in a panic, eyes flying open, as he listens for footsteps. Deciding he’s just being paranoid, he pumps his fist even faster. He imagines Castiel’s mouth around his dick, cheeks hollowing out, mouth hot and wet as his tongue slip slides along the shaft. ‘Oh god! Oh Fuck, yeah!’ Finally his need to cum outweighs his paranoia and relief floods through him as he watches his thick white semen spurts out.
Dean gets dressed in a nice, but one of his less expensive grey suits paired with a simple lavender tie. He finds himself oddly nervous. For one thing, he doesn’t know where they’re going for dinner. Another reason is just how handsome Castiel is. Just under 6 feet tall, dark, almost black hair, pink kissable lips, strong jawline and mesmerizing sky blue eyes. Also, he knows absolutely nothing about the man besides his name and the fact that he’s Gabriel’s brother.
Dean, while mostly thrilled to have Cas there now, is still trying to get the feel of the whole forever thing. He has never believed or even dared to dream about actually ending up with someone for the long haul. Having long ago accepted the whole happily ever thing would never happen- he just wasn’t cut out for it.
“I’m sorry, guess I’m boring you. Alright, back to the fun then.” It says smiling, twisting its hand into a tight fist again.
“I think I’m...I wanna talk about it now.” Dean says, looking up at Cas through his long eyelashes from his place next to him at the table.
Dean clenches his jaw, turns off the stove eye and sets down the spatula. He turns to face Sam again. He gives Sam a death glare. “Yeah, I’m joking. Can’t you tell by me dying of laughter right now?” he says, his tone harsh.
“Of course you can, Dean. You can talk to me about anything.” ‘You got this far’ Dean told himself. “Okay, so you said that angels don’t have emotions and urges like humans do, right?” “Yes.” Cas answers. “But when you lost your grace you became human and so you DID have all those, right?” His heart beating so hard now he could feel it thudding  in his ears. Another “Yes.” is all Cas offered once again.
Sam laughs. “Good to know, but I trust Dean’s judgement. Besides, you’re a good guy Cas. I’m not worried.”
Dean turns and slowly walks to the table, sitting across from Cas. “What’s up?” he asks, doing his best to seem nonchalant. Leaning back in his chair, he interlocks his fingers together and takes a deep breath.
"Well, yeah but also... if you both find something you like, you'll each be leaving with a car of your own."
“Yeah. I’m pickin’ Cas up in the morning on the way to the creek. He’s supposed to call me when he gets up.”
“Oh,” she replies, face serious, “Can’t say I’m surprised, that does sound like something your brother would do.”
Jack adjusts the quickest to Cas living at the bunker. They fall into a routine most nights, of having long talks while Sam and Dean sleep. Sam is still getting used to the awkwardness of running into Cas in the kitchen or the hallway in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning.
Sam feels insulted that his dad doesn’t believe him. Sure, he’s lying, but still. He’s never given him any reason to doubt him before, so why is it so easy for him to suddenly assume he’s not being honest?
Taking a chance, Castiel walks over toward Dean and crouches beside him. “Forgive me?” his eyes begging, as Dean peeks over at him.
“I do tend to focus mostly on nature, but I also have done a fair share of birthday parties, weddings, baby showers and such. I’ve also done yearbook and senior portraits before in the town I used to live in.”
Castiel feels his cock start to swell, as his fingers move to trace Dean’s jawline then down his chest.
Dean runs his hand along Cas’ back and shoulders, pulling his face closer with his other hand. He kisses all along Cas’ neck and jawline. Down one side, then up the other. “Make love to me, Cas.” he whispers, lips beside his ear.
Something about Castiel cooking in his kitchen made Dean feel something he’d never had before. It felt-safe. Plus bacon was never NOT a good way to make a good impression on Dean.
“Oh, you uh, never did get our payment information Castiel. Let me go get-” Sam is interrupted by Dean shaking his hand out.
“I know it’s not, Sammy. It’s not fair to any of us. Look, I know this sucks- majorly even. But it’s gonna be hard for all of us. Hell, it’s my senior year and I’m gonna have to start over at a new school, leave my friends behind. But just think Bobby’s had this house for god knows how many years before we even met him. You really think he would sell it and move us away if he didn’t think it was necessary?”
The driver’s side window is down just enough to let a slight breeze in. The engine roars as they cover ground as fast as Dean is comfortable going without causing Cas to think there is a reason to panic. The radio quietly plays blues music, but the station is getting out of range.
“Oh okay. Well, maybe my mom could pick you up sometime and you could come over to my house if you want.”
“Since when do YOU go grocery shopping?” Sam asks incredulously. Dean glares at Sam and it takes all the restraint he has not to let out the roar of laughter he feels deep in his chest.
The man is surprised enough for Anna to slip out from his arms and runs to the table where Jo, Charlie and Jess look startled at her, then all at once their eyes go wide and they stalk toward the man in front of Benny. Poor Sam is the only one out of the loop now, simply because he’s knocked out cold. A small puddle of drool forming beside him on the table.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I didn’t mean...REALLY. I didn’t mean it how it sounded. I didn’t mean to make you sound…I’m sorry.”
“I’m so sorry, Cas. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you. And I’m sorry for always pushing you away. I know it’s too late to matter now, but... I’m here with you, Cas. I’m here and I’m not going anywhere.”
Having gotten lost in the heat of their ‘discussion’, neither of them had realized where they were. Until now, with the bunker in view just up ahead. Once again, Dean is thankful to get away from this conversation for now. He tells himself they’ll have time to deal with their emotions later, and hopes with all his heart that this time it’s not a lie.
“Yeah, I know what you mean. I know I’m older than dirt, but believe it or not I do still remember what high school was like.” he laughs.
enjoyed all the times you pushed him away and made him feel worthless.” It taunts, obviously relishing in Cas’ pain. “Would you like to know just how that felt?”
“Take one and pass it back, please.” She says, handing a stack of papers to the person in the front of each row.
Dean smiles, kissing Cas passionately and deeply- all tongue. He rolls the condom back off Cas and tosses it in the small trash. “C’mere.” he says, voice low, eyes full of lust.
He pulls her shirt up and she helps him lift it over her head. “I love you.” Eileen says, before meeting Sam’s lips again.
“Thanks.” Sam says, then readily gulps down half the glass. Dean gulps it all down, sets the glass back in front of him panting. “Thanks.” he manages. “So, what’s going on? Is it about…” Dean’s eyes are full of worry and he clenches his jaw, unable to finish.
The boys are getting ready to leave the creek to head home. Once they climb back up into the grass, Cas takes Dean’s hand. “See you tomorrow?” he asks.
Dean takes another sip of his beer before returning it to the table again. He listens to Castiel tell funny stories about times photoshoots didn’t go as planned. ‘god I love looking into those beautiful eyes.’ he catches himself thinking. And for once, he doesn’t try to talk himself out of how he’s feeling.
“A photographer. We were looking for someone to do a maternity photo shoot and then also want to do another once Reily is born.”
Dean takes a seat at the desk, the closest seat to the door. “So, talk.” he says, still not making eye contact, his arms crossed. He lays the folder with the pictures back down.
Dean laughs. Cas gives him a look and Dean bolts across the house chuckling. Cas chases him down the hall before catching him and pulling him into the bedroom. Dean crashes their lips together and Cas growls gripping Dean’s hips. Dean pushes Cas back until he’s laying down on the bed, then crawls over him.
“Our fr-” Dean cuts himself off, taking a deep breath before starting over “Cas, you said you wanted my reason for trying to save you, right?”
“It sounds very silly when you put it that way, but yes I guess that’s a big part of it. I realized when I was around 7 or 8 that I’m gay. So I guess at some point I decided if I couldn’t be ‘normal’, then I had to just be abstinent. I knew there was no other way to get out marrying and having children with someone I didn’t and couldn’t love.”
“I’ll let you know when I get there.” Castiel says, closing the back and then climbing into the driver’s seat of the truck.
Dean cuts him off. “Nnnaa! What did I say? Come on and let’s go. Don’t make me. I’ll do it, man.” he threatens playfully.
Giving him his ‘You’re so full of shit’ look, Dean realizes Castiel might not be able to read that look of his yet and rolls his eyes.
Dean has the urge to ‘accidentally’ glance over at Castiel’s paper, but he’s not going to do that. He wants Castiel to trust him, and he wants to be a man of his word. So, instead he opens his book and quickly gets lost in it.
“He is. They’re both good men. I really like Dean. He and Cas are really good together. They take care of each other.” she says, smiling the biggest she has all night. “I’d like to have something like that one day.” it takes her a moment to realize that not only did she say that out loud, but loud enough for Benny to hear her. Her heart begins to race and she can feel her face flush with embarrassment. “I’m sorry, that was…”she doesn’t know how to finish.
‘Goddammit.’ Dean thinks, putting his head down. He walks past the couch to the bed he and Sam share. He sits down on his side sighing as he settles under the covers.
They both continue moaning before Cas abruptly pulls out. He jerks his cock, holding Dean’s cheeks spread. He pants then moans, as he watches his thick cream spew, landing on Dean’s hole. “Ah, yeah.” Dean moans, feeling Cas mark him with his cum.
“I went to school with Gabe. Adam’s my cousin and so when they started dating I started seeing him around more. He’s really a nice guy. Class clown for sure, but a good guy. We actually got pretty close.”
Without hesitation, he’s pulling them both into a tight hug. “Heya Jack,” Dean says, hugging back. He clears his throat and tries to forget about the subject he and Cas were just talking about. Cas grins while hugging Jack, despite being awkwardly pressed shoulder to shoulder with Dean. He sighs, still angry. “Alright,” Dean says, patting Jack to signal the end of the hug. Jack, remembering what that means coming from Dean, pulls away and takes a step back.
Dean shrugs. “I don’t know, man. As far as I can tell the place is empty.” A simple flip phone catches his eye on a shelf below the register. Relief floods his features as he pulls it out and holds it up to show Cas. “Look what I found,” he brags with a smirk. Hurriedly he opens it, dials and it starts ringing.
“Hello. Table or booth?” a young hispanic woman asks with a polite smile. “And will anyone else be joining you?”
“They should be here in a few hours. I’m thinking maybe we should all take tonight to relax and get some rest before we take on Chuck.”
Cas attempts to comfort him. “Dean.” His voice is deeper and more gravelly than usual as he makes his way closer.
“In love, there’s always risks.” She answers simply. At that, she walks toward the doorway. “Goodnight.”
Castiel takes a seat on the couch, making sure to allow ample space between them, while still being able to reach the table.
Dean grins, tightening Cas’ arm around him, then leaning back against him. “I love you too, sweetheart.”
“Sure.” Gabe says, quickly turning to the other boy. He follows as Adam leads him to the other side of the creek. Gabe sits on the edge of a large rock and Adam, in the water still, moves til he’s standing between the other boy’s knees. What starts out as kissing, rapidly turns into a full blown make-out session.
Dean panics and huffs. He looks to the open portal, then back to Cas. He knows he only has an instant to react before Cas is taken from him forever. “NO!” Dean cries out as he jumps up. Leaping in front of Cas to block him from the Empty’s reach, he tries to speak. He takes hold of Cas’ shoulders, but the tar looking substance hits him square in the back. Dean winces as it begins to sting, burning his skin through his clothes. He lets go of Cas.
“Oh, well, just the hospital. I’m staying in town though. I’ll come by and check in with you guys again before I head back home.”
Dean reaches over and gently covers Cas’ hand with his own. Castiel glances to their joined hands, and then back to Dean.
“Are you sure it’s not just your heat talking, Omega?” he asks, kissing and lightly dragging his teeth against Dean’s neck.
Deans grins at Castiel before bringing his attention back to Thelma. “I’d like to get the anything and everything salad, but is there any way I can substitute the chicken for the mesquite grilled salmon? I’m sure there’s a price increase for the substitution but that’s fine with me.”
“I’m not sure. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been in this life for...I don’t even know where to start.”
Benny is the only one outside family and family friends that knows Dean’s secret. He knows because he too is a male Omega. They met several years ago and that’s how Dean learned about the Alpha scent spray.
Rowena smiles wide and curls against him, placing her head against his bare chest. “I could get used to this, my darling.”
Gabriel and Castiel both turn to face him and Castiel sighs, getting annoyed that the man won’t just let him be.
Cas closes his eyes and sighs. “The way I feel. You. Trying to trust someone again. Then I kissed you and I panicked and almost fell. All the ways I could have been injured if I fell crossed my mind and I freaked out worse. But- you caught me and it was just all too much. I felt so much and it just...came out.”
Sam seems to consider Dean’s words for a moment. “I won’t say anything.” is all he says before settling on his side of the bed.
Though Sam went to bed with a warm feeling in his chest, it wasn’t enough to keep the nightmares from returning. To add insult to injury, when he woke up the next morning he found his sheets and comforter were soaking wet. What he sincerely hoped was sweat, in fact wasn’t. Sam was completely humiliated that at 14 years old he had wet his bed.
Being quite a bit earlier today than it was yesterday when he’d left the house, Dean decides to bring a book with him and go ahead and go to the creek. He figures whatever time Castiel gets there probably won’t be til later anyway, so he’ll just hang out and read until then.
He hangs up and hears the shower cut off. Tucking his phone back in his pocket, he meets Eileen with a towel and a smile.
The heat from Dean’s breath touches Cas’ lips. His cock twitches and starts to swell. A familiar hunger starts to build. He recognizes it as he has felt it before around Dean.
Cas smiles, leaning in and kissing Dean’s lips. “I like you touching me. Thank you for being respectful of what I want. I want to be respectful of you too. So, please if there’s ever anything that I do or ask for or whatever that you’re not comfortable with or just straight up don’t like or aren’t okay with- please let me know.” He brushes his fingers through Dean’s hair.
Cas watches Dean’s fingers disappear inside himself and listens to his moans, feeling precum begin to drool from his slit. He palms himself slowly, long drags of his wrist and begins to pant.
At that, Dean lets go and hops out dripping wet, opens the door and walks out. He comes back, shuts the door and hurries to step back in. He rips the condom wrapper open with his teeth and rolls it down Cas’ fully stiff dick. He reaches down and starts opening himself up with two fingers, leaning against the shower wall, ass facing Cas. He begins to moan as he scissors his fingers apart.
“Stay down!” Chuck growls, annoyed at their stubbornness. He moves to stand beside Cas. More kicks, and punches. Their faces barely recognizable, still they stand, not willing to give in.
Dean chuckles. ‘What the hell, is he just trying to keep me talking for longer?’ They actually have pretty damn awesome milkshakes, strawberry is my personal favorite. For sides, I always go with 2 of their fried apple pies. They do have some chocolate fried pies too, if you like those.”
Dean can’t keep from blushing. “No, they don’t pay me, smartass.” he chuckles and shakes his head smiling. Their eyes meet and he feels his pulse start to race.
Cas pulls back again. “Shit, should we be worried? I don’t wanna cause any trouble.” he says, nervously.
He looks back at her and she winks. “Help yourself.” she says nodding to the coffee maker before leaning against the counter.
“Some people aren’t going to love or accept me, but that doesn’t mean I am unworthy of love and acceptance.” he says to himself again.
His new apartment was close to Gabriel and Pam’s house, so Castiel started having dinner often with them. His nieces got used to him being around and he was happy to get to know them. At the ages of 9 and 11, they were each really becoming their own person and it was a beautiful thing. Gabriel and Pamela may not have a perfect marriage, but there was no doubt they love their girls. They beam with pride anytime they talk about them. And the girls are kind as well as confident.
John grins wickedly before his fist crashes against Dean’s jaw, knocking him backwards. “Come on, tough guy!” he taunts as blood drips from Dean’s mouth. Swinging again, John almost falls forward as Dean dodges his fist.
Eileen keeps checking her phone. ‘I don’t know why I keep expecting a text from him. I told him I need space and he’s just being respectful of that.’ she reminds herself. She sighs. For what seems like the millionth time, she begins writing a text to him, when she shakes her head, erasing the words.
Sam forced himself to start taking walks or going for a run just to get out of the house and get some exercise. Of course, he made the excuse that he wanted to get back into shape so he could play basketball again once the new school year started, when really it was just an attempt to feel better. To escape from the numbness of what had become his daily life.
“I um…” Sam tries. He closes his eyes and immediately runs toward the bathroom. Unfortunately he only gets a few feet before he vomits all over the living room floor. Falling to his knees, he suddenly feels weak. He falls forward but catches himself, hands and knees right in front of the mess he made.
Dean looks at him curiously. “No, I mean it.” he says, watching as he digs his fingers in the sand. “There’s a lot more people out here than what I’m used to. I can’t even imagine what school’s gonna be like.” he admits.
“Yeah but at least what I read is interesting. You like plain old facts and boring nonfiction. Might as well be reading from a textbook.”
‘Stop! What are you doing? Okay, so maybe he likes you. Is this how you’re going to win his heart? By throwing yourself at him like this? Don’t you ever learn? If you let this keep going, you’ll never see him again. You’ll just be an easy fuck to him.’ Dean heard inside his head causing him to stop abruptly and drop his arms away from Castiel.
Bobby sighs deeply and curses under his breath. “Alright Dean, are you and your brother safe right now?”
Sam walks inside the bunker, passes Dean, Cas and Jack wordlessly. He goes straight to his room and shuts the door.
Jack checks the other rooms. “Cas?....... Dean?” He gets to the garage and sees the impala. His stomach sinks.
Castiel opens his eyes to see the question addressed to him. “Oh, um..” he stammers. His mouth seems unable to answer as he feels lost in those beautiful emerald eyes. Realizing the hot guy is still standing there waiting on his answer, he blushes. “Do you have any Kentucky Whiskey?” he hears himself ask.
“DON’T try to tell me I’m NOT broken or that I DON’T have issues! There’s things in my past that just….I don’t even know who I am anymore, okay?!” Cas yells, voice trembling as his eyes fill with tears once more.
Sam comes out of the bathroom and stands behind their father. Eyes wide, he sees Dean not moving on the kitchen floor with blood pouring from the side of his head. “What the hell did you do?! Sam demands, rushing over to his older brother. “GET OUT!” he screams with new found confidence.
Dean feels Cas spread his legs beneath him and he sinks between his thighs. The touch of skin against skin is electric, pumping fire through his veins. He kisses him again. “Do you want me?” he asks, mouth against his lips.
Castiel chuckles, shaking his head. “It’s definitely been an interesting experience.” he says, downing the rest of his champagne.
“Where are you going, baby? Don’t leave.” Ruby says from somewhere behind him. Sam knows he’s not gonna make it home, but he has to. Bobby and Dean will be worried if he doesn’t come home, and they don’t even know where he is. He staggers down the small set of stairs in front of the house but then trips over his own feet and everything goes black.
“Oh.” Dean says. He shakes his head. A horrified look comes over his face. “Oh, please don’t tell me..” his eyes search Cas’ face.
Dean pulls out a chair at the kitchen table motioning for Castiel to sit. He goes to the fridge and turns back to him. “I have beer, bottled water and soda. What’ll it be?” he asks.
Her short red hair is a pixie cut, and wearing dangling skull earrings. She has a half sleeve of tattoos on her left arm. Black vines and roses circling around twisting around her flesh. Her bright red knee high boots, short, tight black skirt, bright red lipstick and a mesh black shirt over a black lace bra.
Sam finishes his water, sets his glass in the sink and hurries upstairs. After grabbing his barely used wallet, he slips it in his pocket and heads to the garage.
“Well that’s good to know, I appreciate that. Now I’m not trying to control every aspect of your life, but where did you go yesterday? And where did you even GET alcohol?"
Dean pushes Castiel’s shoulders back a little from him so he can look at him. “It’s okay, babe. I’m okay, I promise. It was just in the heat of passion. I know you didn’t mean to.” Still the Alpha looked like he was close to crying. Running his fingers through the Alpha’s hair, Dean presses their foreheads together.
more deals! I do have to warn you, though. Beings that die and go to the Empty are asleep. I do not possess the power to wake these beings from this sleep- not even God has that ability. So I can’t guarantee the Angel isn’t asleep and if he is, I will only be able to bring your brother. That part is out of my hands.”
For the first time in 19 years, his chest feels a little lighter. Naomi had told him he should be proud of himself for seeking help. That it is nothing to be ashamed of and SHE is so proud of him for taking the first steps towards self love and acceptance.
“I’m sorry.” Bobby says, not looking up. “I never thought it’d come to this.” he adds, finally glancing up at Dean.
Dean enters the bar and as usual all eyes move to him. Of course, he doesn’t mind. He likes the stroke of ego that comes with Alphas and Omegas alike taking notice of him when he enters a room. The Alphas take in their fellow ‘Alpha’s’ scent, and become jealous of his level of attractiveness before losing interest. The Omegas start silently pining for him, while sneaking glances and smiles at him. It does get annoying for the Omegas to be all over him sometimes, but still it’s better than the alternative.
Painful groaning quickly turns to screaming, as Dean’s eyes shut tight and his face twists in agony.
Watching the Omega intently, the Alpha pounds his fingers more forcefully into him, adding two more fingers. Dean’s face red, breathing erratically as his moans fill the room. Dean cries out with pleasure, whining as slick coats Castiel’s hand up to his wrist. “A-Alpha…” Dean whimpers between moans. “Please...stop…”
“So, I..wanted to give you my-number.” Dean says surprised at his own words. ‘What the fuck are you doing?’ he asks himself internally. “I- mean, if you want it anyway.” he adds feeling like a complete idiot. ‘You’re basically begging a stranger to let you give him your number now, you realize that right?’
Castiel lingers in front of the door with his key in hand. After a moment, he looks up at Dean with something resembling awe. He takes Dean’s hand. “Would you like to maybe do this again sometime?”
“Oh, I uh wasn’t stalking you or anything by the way. I was actually on my way to work, when I saw your car and you sitting out here. Sorry, if it’s weird, I just wanted to say hi.”
[“Hey Sam, it’s me. I uh..” he sighs. “Look, I just wanted to say..I’m sorry. Of course you deserve to be happy. And I get it. You need to try to live your own life. Make your own choices. You’re a grown man, and I- hell I guess it’s time I start treating you like one. Anyway, uh..I guess that’s it. So, I’m on board -with the whole Eileen thing. Just thought I would let you know.” *Click*]
Dean sighs, scooting closer and putting his hand on Sam’s ankle. “It’s not your fault, Sam. It’s HIS fault, and you know it. HE’S the bastard here, not you. So don’t go blamin’ yourself. I won’t let you. So if you’re gonna be pissed at somebody, be pissed at him.”
“What a pretty mouth you have. Looks so good on my cock, baby. MMmmm.” A slightly younger man than his last customer, praises Dean as he fucks into his mouth. “I’ll pay you double if you let me cum in your mouth. Wanna see you swallow my load.”
‘God, you’re so amazing. I’m the luckiest guy on the planet to have such a caring, loving boyfriend.’
“Ain’t nobody at this table here to judge. If you change your mind though,” he winks at her, “you just let me know.”
Cas cups Dean’s face and their eyes meet again. “Maybe it’s time for you to let him go. He’s got to live his own life, Dean. Just like you have to live yours. Let him find his own way. He’s strong and smart. He can do it. And so can you.”
“I’ve always looked up to you, Dean, I just never realized you’re more like a parent to me than a brother. So, I guess it makes sense that it would be hard for you to let me go and live my own life. All you’ve ever known is watching out for me and making sure I’m okay and that I have what I need. You didn’t deserve to be forced to put me first when you should have been able to just enjoy being a kid yourself. You made sure I had as normal of a childhood as you could manage. You gave me everything that you needed but never got. I can’t even imagine how hard that must have been on you. You always tell me I’m much braver and stronger and smarter than you. But I am what I am because of you. I love you, Dean. And I’m so proud of you.”
Dean fills and sets a plate in front of Bobby and then repeats at the empty spot for himself before sitting down.
“What? Oh, yeah I’m great.” he answers. “Have a good night, Jeanie.” he says as he shoves the money in his pocket then hurries out close behind the handsome stranger.
Every time he finishes a drink, Ruby pours more in. Each time it’s something different. Any time he tries to protest, Ruby finds a way to convince him. After a while, Sam’s head is starting to feel fuzzy and when he tries to talk it feels like his mouth isn’t working right. “I think I should get going, Ruby.” he tries to say, but his lips feel numb and his vision is blurred. Attempting to walk out the door, he bumps into someone then runs into a wall before he finally reaches the handle.
“Oh, I’m sure we can find SOME way to entertain ourselves.” Ruby answers, leading him back to her house.
Meg’s parents are divorced. Her dad barely has anything to do with her and her mom overcompensates by wanting to know every detail of Meg’s life including not wanting her to have any privacy.
“I..fine.” Cas sighs. He instantly curses himself for giving in to the admittedly gorgeous man and his puppy dog eyes.
Castiel pulls back, removing his fingers, moving them straight to his mouth and sucking the raw honey taste remnants from them. He moans deeply. Dean pants for a long moment. Then, moving out of the flow of water, he slowly gets down on his knees. Gliding his hand over the Alpha’s shaft, he begins to pump his fist. Castiel moans, and the Omega wraps his lips around the head and down over the shaft. Fully taking him in his mouth, he moans as his mouth moves over every inch.
“Tell. her. you’re. sorry.” Jo says, grabbing a handful of his hair again before stepping to the side, but keeping her hold.
Dean’s eyes flick to Cas’ pink lips, unknowingly licking his own. He notices the sweat gathering beneath Cas’ hairline, the rosy color of his cheeks and sharp inhales of breath. Shutting his eyes, he gulps.
“Well, your eggs are expired by about six months, no milk or flour, basically all I could find was bacon, so we’re having bacon.”
Meg sits up and takes her sunglasses off. “I’m uh..sorry to hear that. I just assumed it was probably a divorce and custody thing like most people around here.” she says, seeming genuine.
The sky is a mix of pink, purple and blue as they make their way out of town. The glowing sun dips below the horizon and disappears. Once they get several miles away from the bunker, Dean finds a place to pull over. He spots an empty parking lot with a ‘building for lease’ sign, pulls in and parks. Dean turns the engine off and leaves the key in the ignition. He leans back against his seat and sighs deeply. He rests his hands on his lap, building up the courage to look over at Cas.
Dean makes his way to Castiel, wondering why he’s in his normal clothes and outside. He has a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.
The Empty laughs, walking back to it’s throne and sitting. “Oh really? And just how do you plan to do that?”
A real smile quickly spreads across Dean’s lips. “No, really. I got it. You’re good. You don’t owe me anything.” Dean insists.
Wishing he had just agreed to ride with Cas instead of insisting  on driving the impala, he drives them back toward his house, silently.
Freezing air cuts right through Castiel’s thick winter coat, sending a shiver down his spine. Looking down at his father’s headstone with conflicting emotions, his face is solemn. With a deep breath, he walks across the snow back to the road. His car is filled to the brim with everything he owns and cares to keep, tightly packed. Even with the heat blasting on high, his toes and fingers are still numb as he makes his way toward a new life.
Chapter Warnings: mental illness symptoms displayed, specifically BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), verbalizing negative self-talk, low self-esteem, implied past trauma, underage consentual intense kissing (idk if it needs a warning for that one, but just to be safe there it is)
Dean leans on the bed, meeting Cas’ lips in a tantalizing kiss. “Yeah, maybe.” He kisses him again. “Come with me? Please.” he says, climbing into Cas’ lap.
Bobby cuts him off. "If that's what you wanna call me, I'd be honored." He says, patting Dean's shoulder with a soft smile.
Castiel looks at him and feels like a magnet is pulling him toward Dean. He catches sight of a flicker of desire in Dean’s eyes. Castiel finds his mouth against Dean’s parted lips.
. He’s just barely able to keep the words from spilling from his mouth. Cas starts walking again and Dean follows.
They both smile at the warmth and closeness. Dean’s eyes close momentarily as he lets out a content sigh.
“Mmmm. Now that’s a familiar sight I could get used to.” Castiel says, chuckling at his own cheesiness.
Setting his backpack down leaning it against the wall, he looks to John. “Fine. What the hell do YOU want?”
Dean’s eyes open slowly and brushes his fingers through the Alpha’s always messy hair. “Cas?” he speaks, waiting for his attention. His heart begins to beat rapidly as he makes his decision.
The parking lot is more packed than he’s seen it so far but he makes his way inside and spots his new friends. They sit between two booths back to back. The first booth is Meg across from Gabe and Adam. The second booth is Charlie and Jo across from Castiel. Dean swiftly decides the safer bet is at the second booth.
Dean finds Cas’ hand and brings his index finger to his lips. Dean thoroughly wets it with his lips and tongue, then guides his hand down as he draws his legs up towards his chest.
Dean grabs his hand, causing Cas to look back at him. He presses a gentle kiss against Cas' knuckles. "Care to join me?"
“Please pass your homework from the weekend, Chapter 10 Review, to the front of your row. Then clear your desk except for your pencil and we’ll begin the test.
They both almost wail with such immense pleasure, seeming to last and last. Finally the unending spasms cease and their bodies continue to slightly twitch off and on for the next few minutes.
A few minutes pass silently as they both try to wrap their heads around the new information. Jack is still filled with shame. He wishes somehow he could go back in time and tell Sam and Dean about the deal so none of this would happen.
“You fit so perfect around me, Dean.” Cas says as he starts thrusting. “Fuck.” he moans, locking his hands onto Dean’s hips.
The man is starting to look scared. “Look, I think we got ourselves a simple misunderstanding here, is all.” he says, looking at Charlie and Jess.
The man chuckles, looking Benny up and down, then tightening his arms around Anna. “Why don’t you mind your own damn business tubby.”
Dean sighs as the fake smile falls from his face. “Forgive me. I know that was an awkward situation to put you in, but…”
“I gotta admit Sam, that was smart thinking asking for Rowena’s help with all this. Speaking of, where
“I tried to tell him ‘I don’t want this’, but he wouldn’t listen. He took himself out of his jeans and told me if I really liked him I would...you know. So, I did. I didn’t really know how, and I didn’t WANT to, but... I was afraid of what he might do if I didn’t.” he takes a breath. “He was older and a lot bigger than me. He played football. He forced me to take my pants off, pinned me down…. then I heard him spit.”
“I’ll go grab us some clothes, be right back.” Castiel says, walking down the hall with his towel around his waist.
Cas takes a bite and has almost exactly the same reaction as before. “Mmm. This one’s really good too.” he says, hand in front of his full mouth.
Bobby puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Alright, if I don’t see you before you leave in the morning, just be careful, okay?”
Dean looks at him with hope in his eyes. ‘Please don’t leave.’ he thinks, but can’t bear to say it out loud.
Castiel leans down plunging his needy cock deep into Dean’s already well fucked hole. His hands grip the Omega’s hips, and he hears him suck air in pain. His hands had found the same spot he had dug his claws into earlier.
This made a wide grin spread across Dean’s face, unable to tear his eyes from the handsome stranger.
The Omega keens, whining moving his ass to try to catch the Alpha’s cockhead on his entrance as more and more slick pours out of him, dripping down off the table onto the floor.
“Just try not to take it out on him, okay? He’s doin’ the best he can. He always has- and a hell of a lot better than HE ever did. “You gonna be okay?”
“Oh, it’s not a problem. Uh, would you like to come in for a minute and I’ll grab the pictures for you.”
Dean puts his head down in defeat and speaks adamantly. “Go. Tell Sam I wouldn’t come back with you. And that I said to honor the deal without me.”
Hanging up, he moves to stand beside Cas again. “Alright, well I guess we should sit tight and get comfortable.” Walking back to the drink coolers, he grabs a gatorade and tosses it to Cas before grabbing another for himself.
“I haven’t started lookin’ yet, but I’m gonna look for a job there. And I’m gonna put the house up for sale.”
Jack’s face is solemn as he considers Sam’s words. “Okay. Let’s do it.” He follows Sam back into the war room where Michael is sitting at the map table.
Miguel leans in. “Was the lady who came in after you, giving you any trouble?” he asks, his face serious.
“So, you spent all day and night at the creek. With these other kids who were also drinking. Is that what you’re saying?”
“No, not over the phone. Can I come over or can we maybe meet somewhere? I don’t want anyone to overhear us but...I’d much rather talk face to face.”
“You decide you didn’t want to keep up?” Anna finally braves enough to ask Benny, pointing to all the empty shot glasses.
The panting, keening Omega is almost sent over the edge right then from finally having the Alpha inside him after being teased so much with his tongue.
“Of course not. I’d like to kiss you at some point, if you’ll let me. But if not, that’s cool too. I like you Cas. I wanna get to know you better.”
Not knowing why, he reaches up taking his hand and Castiel pulls him up. They’re now standing only inches apart.
Dean is so busy he doesn’t even see him come in. Things have been so hectic the last few hours, he’d already forgotten about inviting him to come sit and talk with him while he worked. A few minutes later, he notices someone else sitting at the bar and when he sees that it’s Castiel. ‘Fuck.’ he thinks, rubbing his hand over his face. It’s not that he isn’t thrilled to see him. it’s just he didn’t think the night would be this hectic and now he already feels bad because he knows he’s probably not going to be able to commit as much time as he’d like to, to talking with him.
Noticing Dean has the same type of nervous energy he had at the hospital before Sam had come out, Cas walks up behind Dean and wraps his arms around his chest. “We can order something if you want.” he answers, slowly peppering kisses all along the back of Dean’s neck.
“Well, it’s about me and Eileen.” he pauses, gulping. He can already hear Dean’s voice raising in anger in his mind.
“So how long have you and Meg been together?” Dean asks, before he can keep the words from coming out.
Finally, Chuck groans loudly. “Enough! Just kill them!” Cas stops and turns to Chuck. Seeing the defiance in Cas’ eyes, he chuckles, shaking his head, then waves his hand. The tree behind them snaps from its roots and starts falling straight toward them. Michael dives, shoving them out of harm’s way and the tree instead falls on top of him.
A few short minutes later and Charlie walks back over to them. She holds out a worn scrap of paper with writing scribbled on it. “He’s cool with it. Even says we can stay with him til we get something else worked out. Here’s the address.”
