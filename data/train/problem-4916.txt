Tony had no idea how much he wanted all of that, until this moment. He hadn’t known it existed, to want it. He couldn’t have come up with all of that from nothing… but he could so easily imagine
But, right in the middle of that logical, highly efficient thought process, there was this strange feeling from inside his chest. A sensation that seemed to run under his skin and between his muscles, entirely separate to him even though it came from every part of him. Like pain in a phantom limb, or an itch that wasn’t really there, or…
A different sort of dizziness rolled over Steve as the relief of it washed up along his back. His limbs fell into a pleasant heaviness, tingling at the joints…
keep doing it, if he wanted… A moment that he might’ve gotten through, if he could’ve just thought about how much Tony would hate him, or blame him, or be hurt by it –
That maybe he was about to come face to face with whatever wordless quality it was that always made his blood run cold...
But then there was that little tug again. That strange feeling that he kind of… wanted, to talk about it?
And then he saw Tony pick on one of his many custom-made tools, those delicate, clever hands that Steve knew so well by now… He looked up before he could stop himself. Looking for a smile that wasn’t there, a light that was missing from his eyes…
if you don’t want to…do…whatever they might suggest.” He fixed Steve with what he hoped was a serious look. “I don’t think we have to worry about that blowing our cover, and, anyway, if the tracker is attached, all we really have to care about is getting out of the room. So, just… Don’t be…
“And I’m sorry that I dragged you both on that long, hot, pointless walk to nothing. That was… that was
Which did at least wake Tony up a bit, too. Enough for him to notice the uncomfortable frown on Steve’s face as he tried to place his surroundings, the way he leant awkwardly against the back of the bench, because, really, he just wanted to lie down again… Tony empathised with that feeling – he
Steve let go of a soft, slow breath as Tony swept one hand down the length of his spine, and then back up to his neck again. He let that reassuring coolness radiate from Tony’s touch all the way down his back, and then through the rest of his body. Steve’s cock was still hard, and still burned with every slight movement, but that eye-watering sharpness began to ease. That tight coiling in his groin began to loosen, expanding into his back and hips, eventually settling into a deep, hot ache.
“I have a working relationship with Natasha, she’s used to me calling with specific directives – the call will be quicker without you having to go through all the security clearances and explaining who you are,” Pepper clarified, her tone as focused and urgent as Tony felt. “And, anyway, you need to drink, right?” She left a pause, for Tony to remember that particular detail. “So, you go and do that, I’ll call Nat and tell her everything we know, and if you need to do more than that –
“Beautiful, perfect, fuck, fuck-” and then Steve silenced himself, burying his head into Tony’s neck and sucking a line of deep bruises along the column of his throat.
Steve had finished reading it, at least. If nothing else, he could say that he’d read every detail there was available…
And then he felt Tony’s palm run over the outline of his cock – and Steve’s brain short circuited completely.
was the reason Tony hadn’t called out to Steve in the end – because the idea of doing this in front of him felt every bit as wrong.
And then he saw Tony relax his shoulders and got it into his head that Tony was about to leave - and in his still-inebriated panic, Steve managed to boil that whole revelation down to:
And then a surge of dizzying, shuddering relief, as all the tension left his body in one immediate, intensely satisfying rush-
He saw Clint consider the wisdom in that - or, possibly, just recognise that Steve did at least know Nick Fury pretty well.
occur to him that it wasn’t the smoothest thing he could’ve said… But then he saw the way Tony grinned. Like he was pleased that Steve had asked.
“ Yeah, well, I only found out there were Disney movies like last week, so…” Bucky muttered. And then he looked up at Steve, and then at Tony, attempting a more sober tone when he said again, “I’m sorry.”
your business?” Clint asked directly, narrowing his eyes. Steve sighed, and grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair.
Because he was thinking of the break in at the scrapyard - the way Wanda and her brother had fought the Avengers on Ultrons behalf, actively helped him to steal the vibranium that would later become the core of Sokovia.
He sighed, happily, and pushed himself up off of the couch. He wandered over to the table by the door, thinking that he might as well cast an eye over some of the paperwork. Seeing as he was in a more productive frame of mind all of a sudden-
Steve tried for a reassuring smile, but he knew it hadn’t reached his eyes. He was still being dragged back into those rapidly unfolding thoughts…
“Rather depends on the risk they’re taking though, doesn’t it?” He began wearily. Thinking of how to explain the realities of being immortal without falling down a rabbit hole with it-
He could focus on those tender spots along his inner thighs, and remember the bruising grip that left them.
Steve felt his thoughts abandon him completely, his breaths moving higher in his chest and his heart beating hard against his ribs, as he tried to take Tony in. Tony’s eyes blown so wide they were almost black, his lips parted in an open hunger.
He cast one final glance at the cabinet – and had to flinch away. He knew that being over hungry was probably one of the reasons he felt nauseous, but there was simply no way he could face that. Not yet.
surprised by how nice that was, how deeply and purely satisfying it was… He swallowed hungrily, feeling his body cool and soften, draining the bottle while Tony looked down on him, affectionately.
“Are you okay buddy?” He asked. Gary snapped himself out of a daydream, blinking a few times before a confused frown creased his forehead.
And suddenly he felt far too awake to lie still here like this. Far too aware to lie next to Tony for however long it took him to wake up
Powered entirely by his own stubbornness, Steve forced himself through three whole pages - almost paying attention to them, and everything.
He really didn’t want to say the wrong thing about Tony being a vampire – which was actually far more challenging now that he
“Oh, you definitely have an audience,” Tony smiled, handing him another shot. Steve cocked an eyebrow, and drank it.
the one who lost my tempter. I’m the one who shouted, and made it personal. And, yeah, that’s probably because I was thinking with my feelings too much, too. And, since we’ve been here especially, I’ve thought… You know, the
Belatedly, Steve recognised the way they’d looked at him. The same subtle heaviness in the tone that Nat was using. They might not have been ‘waiting for him’, but they definitely wanted to talk to him… About something they’d discussed in advance, something they were building to-
His breath audibly trembled as he glanced up at Tony again - and found the slightest hint of a questioning expression, beneath his cool exterior. A simple human nervousness, as he waited to make sure that Steve liked his gift-
But all he could do was moan, and gulp for air, and let this pleasure crash over him again and again-
I was an ass to him, too - but-” And then Bucky saw him pinch his lips together so tightly that he had to wonder if he’d drawn blood.
he wanted someone else – immediately struck Steve as being a different thing entirely. Disrespectful, or something-
“We need you to look this over, as soon as possible,” Coulson dictated, already aiming a data case in Tony’s direction.
Steve was momentarily overwhelmed by the familiarity of the conference room. An immediate jolt to the senses; the moment where the familiar felt alien, and what had just seemed normal felt very far away… And then it settled in, and Steve felt it.
It just broke out of him, a constant stream of words just falling over his lips in between frantic gasps, high-pitched and pleading.
Most likely, another twenty minutes of pointlessly cycling through points 2, 3 and 4 - which really meant daydreaming about meeting up with Tony, and then overthinking how much of it would be allowed, and then worrying that he was fucking everything up-
He thought of Steve baring his neck for him, letting Tony run his tongue along his throat, not being afraid-
Of course, Tony burst into peals of laughter at that. Steve fixed him with a faux-irritated expression, while Bucky smiled with mock innocence.
as the doors unlocked. Steve put his ear to the wood and strained to listen. Then he opened the door a crack, to check. And then he looked at Tony. Tony nodded.
For a start, he’d never expected Steve to be as mundanely, relatably honest as that. To say something as human and as understandable and as believable as that.
Right on cue, the sound of agitated voices began to echo through the room, as the commotion rushed up the main corridor and burst into the warehouse.
“Good Afternoon,” Pepper greeted him brightly as she stepped into the workshop, already pulling another book from her shoulder bag. Tony briefly managed a little smile… Until she held the book out to him, and he caught sight of the title.
Instinctively, he screwed his eyes closed tighter and tried to bury himself into Steve’s chest, already aware that this calm sense of
bringing his shield down into Tony’s chest, and Tony falling limp beneath him… “I don’t know, it became this…
lose him there, but I mean… The number of times I’ve imagined what would have happened if I’d made a wrong move in that fight and he’d been seriously hurt. Or if he’d really hurt Bucky… And I know that wasn’t even
Tony managed a smile as he stood up again. He unlaced his tie and tossed it in the vague direction of his jacket, missing it by about two feet. He removed his cufflinks, and carefully placed them on the bedside table, and shook his sleeves loose. And then he glanced back through to the living room, and made the snap decision to get his administrative tasks out of the way before he settled in for the evening.
“Remarkably quick for a woman being force fed sedatives, isn’t she?” Steve noted, sardonically. Tony huffed out a little laugh.
“Maria Hill is trying to coax some answers out of him, out in the lobby,” Nat nodded in that that direction-
Tony still daydreamed about having that argument with Steve, and he still enjoyed a wide range of fantasy responses that Steve might’ve had. Sadness, sympathy, remorse, fuck it, even anger… But Tony knew he wouldn’t enjoy the reality. A patronising, distant look, a softly spoken ‘I understand you’re upset’. Nope. He just couldn’t.
And with that, Steve stood up again. He straightened his back and rolled his shoulders nonchalantly, before he glanced down at Nick, and smiled.
“You’re certain? Because you know it doesn’t have to be now. You know I will always want you, that-”
go on to have all the things he used to want, and achieve the happiness he’d once set his heart on… Steve didn’t envy him at all. He didn’t even envy him the joy of youth or the thrill of the first time-
just because I had a chance to get all that off my chest, or just because I’ve been thinking about what you said, or… I don’t know. But I’ve just figured out that I try
“Alright Captain,” Barton called out, through chewing his food. Ah! That’s way Romanoff was disgusted. Classic Barton. “The shooter, is a ghost, only appears just before a target of his is killed, this is the best look we’ve had In arguably years at the guy.” Romanoff took over, “Followed him down to D.C he’s looking for someone, someone powerful but hidden.” She gestured he wrist around as she was thinking, “not the president sort of level, like generals who aren’t known to the public or political commentators, certainly not some businessman college kid.”
Tony was already in the back seat of the Shield SUV, leaning out the passenger side door as the car was moving, still holding on to the hand grip on the door. Steve was the first to jump in after Tony, forcefully pushing him back into his seat, Steve turned to throw his hand out to help Peter jump in. Peter fell into the leather seat across from the other two, who were giggling to each other, “Tony can you do me a favour and not put your life in danger?” using his arm across Tony’s body as a gentle deterrent for leaning out a car door again.
Peter woke up again in a dark room, he was in the middle of being place onto a bed, tiredness still settling in his bones, reluctant to move. His Dad’s whisper voice filled his ears “Poor kid, he’s exhausted, should we get him some tea for when he wakes up?” A soft hand gently moved his curly hair out of his face again, “Maybe, make him feel at home again? He will be glad to be back home in New York.” Peter curled around the hand that was gently petting him, he let out a mix between a hum and a sigh, relaxation setting into his bones, “Dad? Can I just sleep till tomorrow? Promise I’ll get up for school this time, promise?”
Tony kept it, not like he was struggling for money anyway and honestly forgot about it for the decade, until Steve had one particularly tough
“Peter your Pops is sorry he did not make it to see you this morning. He misses you dearly and asks of you to stay strong and remember that you are from a very tough family and that you can handle anything. He loves you. We all love and miss you nephew.” He turns back to the wall once more and nods, he once again turns to his nephew and Tony, “my time is limited, I may go at any second.” Peter drew in a breath. Tensing up, he’d have to say goodbye to his family again. “Can you tell Pops and Dad, I love and miss them, that I’m safe, I just…. I miss home and I can’t wait to be back.”
“Right we will keep sending videos until they are received, we better get plates and bowls for dinner, Bruce and Tony stay here and keep doing what you’re doing. Alright everyone, a see you soon for Peter.” Steve stood up and directed the team to keep working. A chorus of byes and see you soon’s. The video cuts off. Karen’s soft voice informs Peter, “End of Message. Your Dad has left more data on the incident. But this message was recorded minutes before the anomaly. So, we don’t have much more on the second incident.”
Tony sighed, “Alright kid, but the colours are a bit…. Bold. I like the red though, I have a car that colour. It’s beautiful, you should see it.” He reminisced about his garage at home, which was storing his collection at the moment. Peter didn’t say that it was totally ‘Hot Rocket Red’ the exact colour of his dad’s car, he’d taken Peter out in it a couple of times.
Steve leant back slightly, his legs out stretched in front of him, a bend in the knees to form a slight V. Peter sat in his Pop’s lap, looking up at him as he pulled back slightly, the pair grinning at each other, giving small but ecstatic bursts of laughter. “Hey Petey,” Steve finally broke the silence between them, “Hey Pops.” Peter let the tears flow freely down his face, his Pops had grown his beard back, his arm no longer in a cast and sling, his hair slightly longer, enough to push back into a soft wave.
but Rhodey didn’t know him as well as Steve did. He looked down to his son, this was the life he thought of for his self, in a dream throughout his childhood, he’d always knew he was going to be better than Howard, that wasn’t exactly hard but to truly be in love and to be loved back. Tony felt content with his lot in life. Plus a couple of billion dollars to his name, a husband built like a Greek god and a genius kid who adored him, Tony had hit the jackpot.
He carried on remembering, as he filled the other pan with water, and washed the rice. Mrs Ken and Mrs Sastry. Mickey and Kenny and the little O’Brien kid, who used to run up to Mrs Ken’s stoop with him, mouths watering at the prospect of a warm meal. The nurse’s uniform that his mom used to wear, and her worn out leather work shoes. It had been so long since Steve had thought about any of this. Since he’d felt that happy nostalgia of thinking back to something he’d forgotten he missed… and liking it.
To begin with, there was the physical reaction. It was like an emotional muscle memory, and instant wall of conflicting recollections and associations that flashed up the moment he saw her-
that he didn’t owe anyone his emotions. That it was actually okay for him to miss Tony more than he did Natasha, or to be more hurt by Tony’s death.
“Because you feel like that’s the best way to protect them? Keeping them out of it?” Bucky added, a bit more enthusiastically. And this time Tony could only nod. “Well, I can only tell you what I wish I’d known, way back at the beginning of this – you only hurt people more by trying to cut them out.”
“...Do you want to go out for dinner?” Steve suggested, the most adorable blush colouring his cheeks.
, then it can’t be built on you never needing anything from me, or ever being upset in front of me… Honestly, it’s kind of weird. And I’m not saying… I mean, okay, you standing up for me and not demanding I change everything for you is… nice,” his confident prose briefly stuttered into a mutter as he realised what he was saying, a blush running up his neck as he pulled himself together to carry on. “I’m not saying
But also because it involves people losing their temper - which is great fun to write, but does necessitate a typically Wilma-esque level of notes-
None of those reactions were rational, none of those thoughts made sense, nothing about himself was familiar… but he
And Tony just nodded softly, the slightest hint of confusion in his eyes, like he’d been vaguely surprised this was the route Steve had chosen… but not defensive, Steve noticed. Listening, properly. That was a huge help.
Bucky looks at him for a moment while he goes through those words again. And most of them probably go over his head… But he likes the way they make him feel.
The discovery that the vampire blood samples had been split into ‘families’ would probably have unnerved him at one point, and brought to mind some dramatic, gothic myth… But now Steve simply accepted them as medical terms, no different to the Latin names for flowers.
“I’ll see if there’s anything I can brew to help you, but I can’t promise.” She added. And they both nodded.
He had to break the kiss, to get his hands to the front of Tony’s shirt. Undoing the buttons too roughly, tearing more than he unfastened-
“I’m sorry for all the horrible things you saw during the war – all the terrifying things you had to go through, to go in the first place.” Tony carried on.
They paused in the lobby of the second floor, a few feet from the bottom of the stairs. Tony glanced at the politely-bored young woman, waiting to accept invitations. Then at the double doors on the upper landing, the electronic keypad and the security camera. Then he looked at Steve.
This time it was more a romantic desperation than a physical desire that overwhelmed him. An impulse just as strong and every bit as primal - a need to do something with this incredible abundance of
Every time that pleasure burst a little brighter, burned a little hotter – left a sharper need in its wake. Steve could feel it building in parts of him that had never been touched, pulsing deep inside him, beneath all the barriers he’d ever put up-
He was too busy fighting the urge to pull Tony back, to bark at this guy to back off, to snap his spine clean in half-
Tony instinctively did a quick scan for quiet spots where they could interrogate her – even though he already knew that Steve would beat him to it. And sure enough, before Tony could think of the criteria he was looking to meet,
Steve Rogers, Captain America Steve Rogers?” He added, with an exaggerated frown. “Steve Rogers who died in the forties, Steve Rogers?”
Like if he let himself remember, if he let himself drift down that particular path… he might end up somewhere unexpected. Somewhere there was no turning back from.
a vampire thing, it was something that felt supernatural and inhuman… and that meant it was something frightening, whatever it was.
“I went everywhere in LA,” Tony scoffed, finally meeting Steve’s eye. Steve could see an intention there, a silent warning that Tony was trying to give- “I have been to countless shitty, anonymous bars, by way of some very shady unlicensed taxis, across I don’t know how many miles, in at least two different shirts - which is about as sure as I can be that no one followed me, and no one knows where I am right now.”
a little voice in his head, casually reminding him that this was all very odd. Like a friend making light of how bad something would look on paper…
- along with a pinch of shame, for feeling that way. The frisson of injustice, the feeling that things shouldn’t be this hopeless, that it wasn’t
And then Tony turned away again, and let his face fall into his hands. He let go of a long, slow breath - a sound that Steve recognised as Tony gathering his temper.
There was a low groan from behind him. Tony looked over to see Rhodey pushing himself up to his knees. Next to him, Sam opened his eyes, and then narrowed them in confusion… and then closed them again.
“Oh God, Tony, I’m- I can’t, I-” Steve pleaded, canting his hips to meet Tony’s mouth, pulling at the chains in time with his increasingly sharp movements-
“Tony…” Steve pleaded, fidgeting more urgently against him, his fingertips digging harder into Tony’s skin.
He glanced again in the direction of the lobby. He could swear he felt his body pulling in that direction, like his blood was literally being drawn towards Steve…
And he watched as Tony’s eyes flashed darker, his chest rising up as he took a long, slow breath. The faintest little
He didn’t really have the energy to wash his mug right now either, but certain habits were hard to break. Wearily, he turned on the tap, and waited for the water to heat up.
A loud, metallic clang snapped Steve to attention, and he glanced up to find Clint standing next to the BBQ he’d just slammed shut.
Tony suspected that her monologue had been crushed under the sheer weight of Steve’s withering look – and he was glad.
“Sorry,” he muttered… already thinking of another thing he meant to mention… Bucky rolled his eyes affectionately and put his phone away, sitting up to look at Steve when he asked,
That rant had been Tony coming up against a core struggle of his very being. Yet another moment when who he really was overrode
“Well, that wasn’t really a lie,” Tony muttered, “that was really just incredible foresight…” And Steve huffed another laugh, while Tony gave him a little nod,
“Steve. Before for you go to Howard…” Peggy rested her hand on Steve’s in the middle of the car. “About what happened at the compound with Peter.” Steve stopped with his hand on the door released. “What about it?” Peggy looked around Steve’s face for answers. “He…” Steve reshuffled himself to face Peggy but didn’t release his grip of the door handle. “He’s Tony’s son, Peggy I know this.” Peggy let a gentle smile grace her face, “Never mind, you never were quick off the draw with people.” Steve furrowed his brow, confusion written all over his face, a little bit insulted if he was honest with himself, Peggy gestured towards the door. “Go Captain, Director Stark is waiting.” Steve nodded and proceeded to climb out the car. Making his way to the warehouse doors.
“Open your eyes son. Focus on one thing, your notebooks, a mark on the wall, anything but just one thing.” Peter looked into the corner of the ceiling, the Stark family crest in wood, painted cream to match, he could focus on that. Almost immediately he stopped hearing the downstairs portion of the house. He could just hear Jarvis across the hall, dropping some washing off in Tony’s room. “When you were bitten, I worried this would happen and for a while it seemed like we’d missed it, but your Dad said that if you came under stress this might happen. So, listen, Peter, repeat the steps and know that your Dad and I love you no matter what.”
Peter took the ball from the claw and noticed the far wall was covered in circular green rub marks from where the tennis ball had been repeatedly thrown at the wall at least a thousand times. Peter gave the ball a good overarm throw across the lab to the wall and watched as DUM-EE raced towards it. Peter was impressed until he realized that DUM-EE wasn’t slowing down as he was heading towards the wall. Tony called out “DUM-EE not the…” DUM-EE slammed into the work bench sending wrenches and papers flying across the floor. “Workbench…” Tony sighed rubbing the side of his head. Peter let out a joyous laugh at the sight. Tony turned to Peter as he was watching DUM-EE attempt to pick up his mess with his claw. “So, he’s still working in the future?” Peter continued to watch the cleanup with a wide grin on his face. “He’s your favourite lab assistant before I came around, that is.” Tony gave a gentle smile at the thought, looking down to his shoes. “Come on!” Peter called out, “Let’s go help him!” They stayed with DUM-EE till it got dark outside, the robot notably became sad when they had to leave. “Don’t worry buddy, Rhodey will be with you tomorrow and then me the day after that, Ok?” DUM-EE seemed pleased enough that Tony wouldn’t be gone for long. “And what do you do if you get stuck on anything?” DUM-EE Wheeled itself towards a large red button on the wall and used it’s claw to point at it. “Good boy!” Tony shut the door behind them and locked it again. As they walked back to the apartment during the cold night, Tony turned to Peter as they walked, “I’m glad you know him, he was my first real success and to know I built him well enough that he could last… well, I’m just glad you’re here Peter. As Tony unlocked the door to the apartment, they both walked in and head towards the kitchen to grab some food when they heard something drop from Steve’s room. Peter ran towards the room with his faster speed, but all he found was a glass of water from earlier smashed on the floor by the now opened window.
Steve noticed that the kid kept calling him sir, the kid has some manners, which just highlighted Steve’s thoughts that he was too young to be staying with Tony. When they reached the apartment door, Peter pulled out his key, unlocked and held open the door for his Pops. Steve walked in and waited for Peter to direct him towards Tony’s bed. Peter once again held open the door and watches as Steve placed Tony gently down on the bed, as Steve made a move to stand up Tony gripped on to Steve’s hoodie.
is really lucky.” Steve gestured over Tony’s shoulder, Tony laughed, “I could say the same about you soldier!”
After the success of the first trip to the cabin, Peter repeatedly asked when they could go back, not that he didn’t love his Dad and time alone with him but they always had their scientific passion that they could share together, his Pop’s a man so far from comfort in his own time, just needed something that they could share, just between the two of them. Peter and his Pop’s haven’t missed a trip yet. Well, until this year. Stuck in the past away from his family kind of limits the possibility of it happening again.
Peter nodded, “ and where are your parents this Christmas, Peter?” She quickly grabbed Peter’s upper arms. “Not that you aren’t welcome! Never want you to think you aren’t welcome here!” Peter jumped a little in surprised when she gripped his arm. “Uh, they are.. far away this Christmas. But hopefully home soon!” Anna wrapped her arms around his shoulders as they continued to prepare dinner. “Well we will take good care of you!” Peter gripped her fingers to hug her back.
“Of course, Nephew, I will pass on your message. Young man of Iron, please continue to look after him with all your skills. He is important to the family and… you will probably not forgive yourself if something were to happen to him.” Thor dropped his head at the end, fearful of his own words, what would be considered too much information but if it was the truth was it not necessary to tell. “Thor, what do Uncle B and Aunty Nat know about a shooter with a metal arm? He’s the closest thing to a threat I have here.” Thor nodded, turned back to the wall, Peter had clocked that where ever Thor was in the present, his family were all there, his chest heated up, he felt a bit emotional that his entire family had turned up to figure out how to get him home.
But scrolling down were two photos and links to their Shield profiles of Anthony E. Stark and Captain Steve Rogers.  Tony’s driving license photo and Steve’s Shield ID photo. Peter was almost a perfect blend in Natasha eyes. She let out a gasp, her hands froze over the keyboard. She was ignoring the fact that scientifically that was impossible only due to the fact, that if Stark wanted a kid, he would break the modern laws of science to get one. The file consisted of photos taken of Peter in his room at Tony’s old flat. Through a window but the image was zoomed in to focus on a projected photo in the air from his wrist that Peter was staring longingly at.
and Peter returned it with a casual effort. Tony turned back to Steve and held out his hand to shake, “Hi, I’m Tony Rogers. You’ve been taking care of my son, so thanks.”
“Well, what changed, if your Uncle comes back to us another time you and your parents can work it out? Make a diary of what they remember?” Peter jumped up from the couch and stood toe to toe with Tony. “What do remember specifically from your I don’t know 15
Steve pulled the Velcro of the suit around his neck, just a little tighter to stop the breeze. Adjusting his shoulders, he sat between Clint and Natasha, checking his watch, it was only 11pm. “So, the meeting with your buddy in military architecture had to be at 2am?” Steve gave a smirked smile as he shovelled some noodles into his mouth, man food was so much better nowadays.
Find the radio, cut the lights, break the glass, get out. Simple, hopefully. Steve made his way through the crowd, gently pushing past people, keeping his head down. Finally reaching the technology display, browsing through the display, from Hogan’s ‘happy bombs’ and the blowin’ apart radio that made him and the rest of the 107th walk home for a day or two with the injured. Displayed on the glass shelves above the radio, was the transmitter with the broadcasting abilities over all channels. Perfect for contacting Natasha, where ever she maybe. Hopefully not far and still safe.
“Sorry, I just… I was excited! And you were there and I just couldn’t quite control it, and I didn’t have time to focus on a good whistle so I just-“ Steve face fell slightly, the worry of a father after almost 6 months apart from his son, things change, Peter’s powers had developed fully. “Does the whistling help? I made those just incase, I just never thought I wouldn’t be there.” Peter took a deep breath in and slowly out. He’d struggled on without his parents beside him, but to have his Pops right here in front of him, he doesn’t want to discuss the time he’s had, he’s stronger than ever, his hearing is insane but theses weren’t joyous occasion shared with his family, he’d been alone, no support except for a pre-recorded message.
he’d stared at Tony for far too long. He actually preferred to think that Stark had given him a strange look, rather than think that maybe he’d started it. That maybe Tony was just responding to the strange look Steve had given
The space was long and narrow, with a door at either end, as well as the one he’d just stormed in through. A row of empty office chairs sat at one long desk, lit only by the white static on the bank of television screens – so, they hadn’t managed to get the cameras back online yet…
“You catch their attention as a test subject. You have a reaction to the drugs that they’re interested in, or show some quality they’re interested in.”
But as it was Tony had fallen into his own part of his, trusting completely in the little voice that he’d been trying to silence for months.
“You need to tell me right now the name of your other parent.” Tony leaned against the opposite counter causally, crossing his arms as if he hadn’t asked a million-dollar question, well, Peter thought to himself, If anyone could afford it…
“A message in case Peter can get Karen back on the servers.” Steve sat back up to let all of his Uncles and Aunts crowd around the screen, “Smart move Dr and Captain Stark. Hey Peter, got a new bow for you to try out, you just need to come back and get some wisdom from the old master Hawkeye!”
“Tony come on you know I didn’t have a choice, they needed me!... Do you know what, fine! Be child but don’t chuck my stuff you arsehole! I’ll come get it if you don’t want to see me but I thought we were friends!... Whose Peter?...”Steve asked quietly. Tony jumped off of his chair and took the phone out of Peter hands.
There was a knock at the door, Coulson gave it a second before opening the door. He stared at the two people, he blinked. “Director Stark has ‘request’ or as Director Carter paraphrased to me, he threw a tantrum that you are not back at MIT and studying for your mid-term exams. So, flight leaves in 20 minutes. Pack up.” He shut the door behind him. Tony stood with a mildly confused face, his eyebrow raised in a perfect point in the middle. “Uh so my dad is pissed at me as you can tell!  Let’s head back to campus, maybe Rhodey-bear can help, he’s got me out of some sticky situations!”
Peter stood next to Ana, she gripped the tips of his fingers tightly, Peter watched with his mouth slightly open, wide eyes as he watched his Grandparents step out of the estate car. Tony walked over to lean against the closed living room door, crossing his arms and legs. Peter watched his Dad’s game face take shape on his face, he never realised it had started when dealing with Howard. Peter turned back to watch Mrs Stark, Jarvis held out his hand to help her out of the car, standing up and out of the car, pressing out the cresses of her blazer jacket. “Thank Jarvis.” She turned to look over the car, Howard let himself out, stepping confidently round the car to stand next to his wife, they whispered between themselves. Howard kept glancing towards the open front doors, every time he did Tony frowned.
“No, well just a couple of days, Howard decided to book a trip to the Barbados house as a surprise.” Ana made her way round to stir the soup on the large gas stove, she was very slightly shaking her head, disappointed in the Starks. They are they even taking Tony?  Are just leaving him home alone till Christmas, well not alone, she thought, the Jarvis family would take care of him. “Are you taking Tony?” trying to act calm, “No, I’m not taking the boy, his friend is here, I might have if he wasn’t and I forgot to mention, we are stopping at the Pentagon on the way.” Maria huffed at Howard’s response, “Not again Howard, you said Barbados.” Standing up straight crossing her arms, annoyance clear on her face. “It will just be a stop on the way, the jet will barely be parked for 10 minutes.”
“Young Peter, we have narrowed it down to two possibilities, the first is that the weapon is an escape plan for the alien race, that they could go back in time to try once again to fix their mistake of loss in a battle or the second… is to provide mercy for the victim of the attack, allow them to relive a moment that they wish they could fix. But considering you are not born yet, and these are not your memories, we strongly agree it is the first option.” Thor sat in a meditative pose that Wanda had taught Peter, Thor and Bruce a while ago, a position to find peace and a calm state of mind. Peter decided it would be a good idea to do the same.
How was he? It hit him once again that it was coming up on three months, since he’d seen his parents in person. They weren’t there to ask him once he was home from school, they couldn’t help him with his homework, there wasn’t a dinner waiting for him made by his Dad for their small family to sit down and eat together. He didn’t know how their days have been since he left.
The lost dream, a twinge of sadness ruined the fantasy however, he wasn’t married, Tony wasn’t even his boyfriend let alone seeing anyone on earth, Peter was a weird kid that he’s assigned to protect. He wanted to go see his Ma, go ask her way he was so… lonely.  “Uh earth to Steve? You ok?” Steve shook his head lightly to break him from his stupor. “Yeah, sorry Peter was having a nightmare, so I just helped him get back to sleep.” He made his way towards his side of the bed, climbing in under the sheets. Tony placed the delicate journal back onto the bedside table and turned the lamp off. They both slid down into the bed at the same time, manoeuvring to get comfortable.
Tony showed Peter around campus all morning, pointing out good places to hang out, the science labs, the architecture of the historic buildings. It was a very tiring morning for Peter, as they rounded the corner near the students café, some of Tony’s friend spotted him and called him over, Peter stayed on the corner on the other side of the road just watching the world go by as Tony spoke to his friends. Peter was caught off guard when a strong guy bumped into him, Peter has to usually fake his strength and be moved by the bump because of the super strength ability, he is basically able to keep himself in one spot. But this was different this guy wasn’t built like a football player but he certainly could move him just enough for Peter to notice the shear force as well as the other guy. The stranger threw a look over his shoulder. Sporting a glare that was almost covered by his shoulder length hair hidden under his hoodie. Peter watched as the man quickly man his way to the end of the street at a brutal pace. Peter was broke out of his stares with Tony’s hand on his shoulders. “Lunch Time?”
“I need to get packed for going home,” Peter spoke slowly, the careful choice of words in his tired state, Steve smiled as he patted Peter’s back, “Let me give you a hand, your dad wanted me to make sure the suit was still in one piece.” Steve lightly gestured over to his belt, discarded on the large oak dining table. “I’ve also got a few extra web shooter cartridges with me just incase.” Peter gripped onto his pop’s shirt quickly as a thanks before pushing himself up to sit back on his heels.”Come on Pops, I’ve left the suit hanging up in my room.” Peter yawned grabbing two ends of the blanket to give himself a cape. Peter trailed the blanket with him down the hallway, reshuffling it on his shoulders as he turned into his room.
Steve tried his best to calm whatever uncertainty was plaguing Tony’s mind at the moment, Tony ended up turned and curling himself on top of Steve’s chest, finally at peace. Steve let out a silent huff of laughter, moving a piece of Tony’s hair out from his face. Steve sat with Tony for maybe 10 minutes or so before his stiff muscle began to complain about being held in the one position for so long.
Steve actually took a proper look at Peggy, she was tired and worried, Steve should have noticed when he got in, but he’d missed it, tired himself he supposed. “I don’t give a damn about Howard, Steve.” Steve sat up in his chair again, clasping his hands together between his thighs. “Howard is my colleague, but he has tricks up his sleeves and hasn’t been seen in the public for months. Anthony… he is alone in a flat, that is in a very public campus with a kid. I have Shield on him, but he knows how to evade them.” Peggy was getting emotional, she quickly turned to look out the car window.
sat back on his heels, Peter curled into the front of his chest, his eyes glazed over focused only on the dirt a foot in front of him, his hand curled into his son’s back. He made eye contact with himself. He looked as lost as he felt.
He’d been fighting this particular shame all evening. Every time his attention turned to the subject of Steve Rogers himself, or any of the purely personal revelations, he’d get this same stab of self-consciousness, and immediately find himself thinking,
And it wasn’t a step on the path to an answer or a compromise between two answers or even Tony coming to terms with the fact that he didn’t have an answer – it
A few images flashed through Tony’s head, like the flickering end reels of his father’s old home movies. Random moments from all the other parties they’d had at the Tower. Clint singing a Bryan Adams song into an upturned bottle at Steve’s birthday party. Nat and Sam doing shots at last years New Years Eve party.

But he couldn’t help it if the initial emotional reaction was just a horrible fear that he’d ruined things between them-
him, or thought he was hot, I wouldn’t be thinking about seventy years from now. Maybe I could trick myself into thinking I could just have a bit of fun with him… But I know walking away is going to kill me, and it’s only going to hurt worse the more time I spend with him. And it’ll cost
I found that out, did we?” And Tony shook his head. And Steve took a deep breath, and thought about how to explain it succinctly. “You remember me telling you about how Zola told me all about the Hydra occupation of SHIELD, with his little presentation, on his… digital tape brain?” He asked, and Tony nodded. “Well, when he was saying all that, Nat said something like, it isn’t possible, SHIELD would’ve stopped you doing this. And
“I don’t know.” Tony exhaled. “But I think it’s a possibility, at least. One power hungry scientist stumbles across an alien world ripe with natural riches. Uses the people here as slaves to harvest and develop them. Maybe The Facility is just a testing ground, or a focus group, or something…”
The person she wanted Tony to be was actually just a responsible, reliable human being with a basic regard for their own safety and some sort of stable long-term plan. To cry that she was trying to ‘change him’, to crack under the pressure of simply considering another person, was all too pathetic for Tony to deal with-
of the reasons it was so hard to tell you. Just because I felt like all I could say was that a Hydra thug

They began their weary march over to the right of the building, so that they could approach the dumpsters side on, through the parking lot. By the time they got there, the sweat was beginning to gather along Tony’s back, and the robes were weighing ever heavier on his shoulders.
Steve’s smile settled into an expression that Tony had never seen before… A more confident sort of happiness - more
Steve’s stomach knotted, his skin pulling tight over his shoulders as he realised why that had been a stupid thing to say…
...How reckless and uncaring the Army was to give Steve that serum without a shred of support - without any of the details they
It was only as he was saying it that Steve started to think about all the work that had gone into this plan - how many sleepless nights and personal sacrifices had come good...
“So, America never became a fascist state, then?” Steve pressed on, a knowing edge on his voice. “Nobody being arrested by the government just for existing? No one being locked up and monitored because they are ‘
“Okay, so, just an idea, that I’m literally having right now – might not be a good idea, but.” He started, and glanced back up at Steve. “So, you know the drug they put in the air here, that makes everyone all talkative and relaxed – the one that Dev was
As it was, the elevator had just settled into place on the right floor, so Steve was going to have to do
Also, I'm aware this particular outburst comes across as one sided - I just want to reassure everyone other points and perspectives will get explored before long. I love BOTH my boys.
“...And I didn’t tell you any of that, the first time around,” he pressed on. “Well, not the stuff about Bucky, anyway - everyone knew about Hydra and SHIELD, after we brought them down, obviously… But I never told you that Bucky was alive, or that Bucky was the Winter Soldier… or that I spent the two years after 2014 trying to find him again…”
When he stepped into Steve, Tony could feel more than just the warmth coming off of his skin. He could
“Sorry, say again?” He muttered, surprised by how freely the words slipped over his lips. He saw Tony frown… tighten his mouth, just so…
‘like’ you, the first time I saw you,” Steve told him, through gritted teeth. “I mean, I thought you were the most beautiful man I’d ever seen in my life – and maybe fixated on that a little bit, I guess. Mainly, just… I am pretty sexually frustrated, I don’t know if you could tell-”
“Yes,” Sam answered instantly, and totally seriously - much to Bucky’s amusement. “I mean it, I actually think I’m going to remember this meal when I die. I would
,” she didn’t even glance at Steve when she referred to him, “make us all stupid, apparently. And I’ve just got to sit here and listen to it, or else Steve will get upset?”
“No,” Clint snapped back. “It’s because you’re being ridiculous. You’re trying to hurt her because you’re hurt, and that’s just not okay and you know it. You’re
“Have a nice time!” Rousseau called after them, as Steve power-walked the group in the direction of the flower show - or, more accurately,
Okay, so he knew he probably had yet another anxious evening of overthinking ahead of him… He’d get started on that in just a second. Swear to God.
This time around, Steve kept his head down and his eyes on the goal. He did his best to quiet his thoughts, repeatedly telling himself that he could process this one when he got

...Because, of course, Tony hadn’t had to worry about ‘getting lost’, since he was about twelve years old.
“You don’t think there’s a chance someone is going to recognise us?” Tony snarked, jumping right to the point.
He didn’t know what to say, what more could he possibly say, as Maria moved on to fuss over Tony, Howard held his hand out for Peter to shake, Peter stared down at it. He met his hand in the middle, gripping it firmly, “You’re just as sarcastic as he is. You might be good for him.” Howard released his grip, turning towards the door, motioning to leave, when he suddenly turned and look him up and down, then his eyes flickered to Tony, muttering under his breath, “At least you dress better than him.”
“We are going home, Petey, we are going home to Dad and this man is never going to bother you again.”
“Steve, Steve Rogers?” Peter asked short of breath, almost stuttering out his words. Tony furrowed his brow, Tony slightly leaned forward, sliding into the mirror position of Peter.
“Pops what happened in Budapest?” Peter skimmed the now opened letter for its details, Peter knew all about most of his families’ adventures, his parent were honest with him, but they had never mentioned a Budapest mission taking place to him. The letter looked worn, it had been previously crumpled and smoothed out again. Tony turned to look out the window. Steve sighed. “That was my first mission back as the Captain, We had … a disagreement? It was a bad time for us…yeah…” he trialed off. Tony turned to look to Peter, with a fatherly half smile, Peter got the message, he placed he letter back in the box.
The Winter Soldier stood up, with a crack in his lens of his mask, his orders were unreadable. The flickering screen irritated him. He grabbed at the full face plate, ripping it off of the straps and threw it to the ground. Looking up at his target he scowled at the two twins in the way.
Steve stepped forward, finally standing tall. His future self smirked stepping forward holding his hand out for him to shake it. “Steve Rogers.” Steve laughed tightening his grip, “So am I.”
Steve followed Peter down the side streets towards the new apartment, taking in the boy’s appearance, he was definitely younger than Tony, which wasn’t strangest part, more that he looked quite like Tony, something about his face was just similar enough that it was uncanny.
Steve hesitated for a moment before offering to Natasha, “you know if this does go well and you want company on house arrest you are more than welcome to help me?” She terrifies him, but that might just give him enough to stay away from Tony until he graduates, just until he finds someone else to live with, Tony will be offered some crazy job, he shouldn’t be stuck to just New York because of him.
“Well, I tried, you’re alone for dinner tonight then, because I’ll be at the Bay Harbour Restaurant at 7pm. So, then what are you doing for dinner.” Peter sighed a little, he jumped off the counter and opened the cupboard behind him, shutting it again and check the fridge. “I’ll make some soup or something?” Tony gave a shrug and ‘yeah sounds good’ face.
A Stark pillow fort was not something to messed with. Peter remembers the first time he and his dads built a fort. He had come home from a sleepover at Ned’s house with a bunch of his friends from school. Peter had explained to his dad’s in detail about how cool their blanket fort was. It neatly fit into the small space of Ned’s bedroom using two chairs to hold up the roof. Peter at the time mistook his dad’s disgust at the level of skill as excitement and before Peter could finish telling his story his Dad was already on plans A through G, on how to show Peter the coolest pillow fort in the world.
Steve jumped a little at the slam of the cabin’s door, but quickly forgot about it as his son sprinted towards him, Steve dropped the shield on the dirt floor of the clearing, he picked up the pace to meet his son in the middle, colliding with Peter the pair collapsed into a heap on the forest floor. Steve running his hands over his sons face, not quite believing that he finally had his son back in his arms. Steve was laughing hysterically, over joyed that Peter was finally back in his arms. Peter chest felt like it was going to exploded with how hard he was breathing, he gripped onto his Pop’s forearm, not quite believe that he’d come for him, that for the first time in months he was going home, that his Pops was here. Steve rested his chin on top of Peter’s head, cradling the boy in his lap, arms holding the back of his head into his chest as the other gripped tightly onto the back of his son’s shirt.
And Tony, would probably have thought that Bucky hated him through protective glares and unfriendly dead pan jokes. Maybe they would have gotten along just for him. He could at least believe it could happen that way. That Peter would grow up with a father and an uncle who cared about each other. Here Steve found himself once again, alone and a friend down and unable to explain his emotions to anyone. He was getting exhausted and he really just wish he could have looked forward to having his own Peter. But his real world just wasn’t that fair or kind to him, he was out of time. Again.
As they sat down to dinner, Peter and Tony spent the night trading stories from school or from their families, Peter heavily modifying some to play into the normal family life. Speaking to each other late into the night, Tony was finishing up his story on how he disproved his lecturer’s thesis in a total of 5 minutes in front of his class.
Steve picked Howard up once more, readying to throw Director Stark down the hallway. Peter grabbed Tony round his waist and jumped back down the vent again. “Steve, please stop!” Steve dropped Howard. Peggy stood between Steve and Howard. “Leave now, Howard, I’ll stop by later with the rest of the council members to discuss this… incident.” Howard stop with the help of his guards, carried down the hallway to the elevator a defeated look on his face.
“Young Peter! Are you safe, as soon as word reached Asgard of your disappearance I returned at once to help find you!” Thor’s voice boomed as loud as thunder in Tony’s opinion. “I’m just glad to see you here Thor, how did you get here! Dad said it was too dangerous to travel back!?” So, this runway model was from the future…If he was Peter’s dad. He wasn’t complaining one bit, hell, he might even thank God for his luck!
“Pops the gauntlets got vibranium in it, your shield is a conductor, drop it!” Peter called out. Before Steve could even react Tony reach around and threw the shield at the gauntlet. Steve wrapped an arm around Tony and quickly walked back in to the elevator. Peter jumped back in before his Dad crushed him against the wall as the doors shut. Tony was out of breathe repulsors still pointing towards the door. Peter saw his Pops nervous look towards his Dad, he placed his hand on his shoulder and gave a gentle squeeze. Tony relaxed, he immediately turned around and wrapped Peter in a tight hug, “Are you ok?” Tony asked. Peter nodded under his Dad’s arms, reaching out for his Pops as well. As the doors opened to main lobby floor, Steve turned his family towards the main door, “FRIDAY, get in touch with Thor and send him the footage of what happened. No one goes down there until that thing stops sparking.”
And before Peter even realised it. He’d made it through a couple of weeks. A shift every day, 6am – 2pm. Back to the flat to nap for an hour then hang out with DUM_EE then he would go home and make dinner. It was pretty simple, It allowed him to just run his life without putting too much thought into it. It gave him some money for him to support himself It also allowed the time for Karen to work on simulations of the incident. Peter was walking through the empty quad, a slight breeze in the mid – November air. Not a soul in sight. Well, Until Peter nearly jumped out of skin when Thor’s bombing voice filled the quad, “Nephew Peter!”
Romanoff looked off out of the window, lost in thought. “He has your smile. He just…. whether he’s your long-lost child or a nephew or something, you don’t get a smile like that without having time to grow up with it. There’s something about him, besides being a weird kid.”
They patted each other on the back at the same time, stepping away, Tony turned to Peter and gestured towards the car, Peter and Tony bumped shoulders as they walked away in silence. Steve jogged to catch up with Barton and Romanoff, Captain America time, well, a little selfish act, so he could save his friend but if this was an international assassin that they could take down then, even better In his opinion, by the time he reached the two spies, Barton was already tucking into his second burger if the look on Romanoff’s face was to go by.
Could he just forget Tony? He was never going to get him back, there’s no way to spend another decade in the ice as trade to get to Tony back. He knew himself, he’d spend the next years of his life mourning the lost of his own future, his only family. Could he just forget? To leave the pain behind. There will never be another Tony, fact. He and Tony were suppose to get married? Fact? The memories with Tony were some of the best he had. Fact. Forget the only good thing he’d experience since the 40’s. But then again, the man who wanted all that, a family, the white picket fence and the house on the corner… that man died in the ice. Is it worth it to forget Tony?
“You are not needed a Shield that much, that pure exploitation, you actually think they are going to let you settle in the US?!” Tony hopped off the counter, opening the fridge for milk for his next coffee, “That’s bullshit Steve and you know it. So far you are going to be permanently in your mid 20’s, you won’t get to retire from this, as if you would - you just LOVE it.” He slammed the fridge door closed and held the handle for a while, to support his tired mind.
Tony looked like he blushed. Just a bit, he’d say it was the heat… of the freezing cold office. Tony walked in and sat in his office chair, pushing Rhodey’s jacket that was hanging on the back of the chair on to the floor next to him. Peter jumped up on the desk next to Tony. He was watching the code for DUM_EE’s drive controls scrolled down the screen. “Hey, Steve can you do a ball chuck.”
I think it wasn’t until your dad and I had moved into together that it got to a boiling point. I’m trying to remember it…” Steve looked off into the distance, he’d placed his hands on his hips counting with his fingers, he tapped his belt. “I think your dad came home one day, gosh.” Steve smiled, “It was hot in the apartment, I’d been painting the last section of the living room, when your dad walked in and I…” Steve coughed into his fist awkwardly, “Uh, yeah never mind! How’s Karen!” Peter stood on the other side of the bed, he snorted at his Pop’s clear avoidance of anything sexual when it came to Peter.
The pair walked down the hallway past the room where the crack had appeared, the door left slightly open, Steve noticed Peter glance in to the room, he quick tripped on his step with his trainers. Steve wrapped his arm over Peter’s shoulder, “don’t worry we will get you home, before you know it you will miss the music and food- scratch that Tony’s only fed you takeaway, hasn’t he?” Peter shook his head, “Jarvis’ family pasta dish and then takeaway.” Peter chuckled feeling relieved that at least Steve wasn’t going to harass him much more, he knew why Peter was defensive, he thought about how different this experience could have been if he’d met Steve first, might have been a bit more of a shock waking up in the middle of a spy operation.
’. Well, that’s a dodgy title Tony thought to himself. Quickly shutting the page before turning the bulky screen round to show Obadiah.
“Steve never knew his father, but people always told him he was a lot like him. So even if your parents aren’t with you right now… you’ve got a little bit of them inside your head too.  you will figure this out. Don’t worry about that. You will get home.” Tony placed the watch into Peter’s palm, closing his finger around it. Peter had never seen this before, he assumed if it was anywhere back home it was in his Pop’s study. Maybe on a shelf up high.
quickly whipped the duvet free and allowed his family to climb in under the weighted blanket, as soon as Peter touched down, he found his body wrapped in a mess of arms, he quickly found his parents cocooning him in the middle. “I missed you guys.” Tony rolled and pulled Peter into his chest, out of the arms of his Pops, “We missed you too kiddo but if its required, you’re absolutely grounded in the 2018. No time travel for the rest of your life!”
Open his eyes as the air craft lurched forward when it stopped in the hanger. Bouncing his leg twice to test the injury. He stood up to exit out the back ramp. Natasha stood at the same time, Barton stood in front of her, handcuffs extended. She rolled her eyes, “they would take me a minute to break.” Barton shrugged his shoulders with a cheeky grin on his face, “I know, but it’s the rules for a former everything spy when she enters shield.” He clasped them down on her wrists behind her back.  Steve followed the pair off the aircraft.
Steve ran his hand through Peter’s hair, Peter snuffled and burrowed closer, his nose twitching as he settled again, letting out a soft huff. Natasha walked around the back of the couch, Steve looked up and follower her around as she sat in the tattered oversized Sherlock chair. “Cute.” She commented as she tucked her legs up on to the chair. Steve smiled back. “Aren’t we just, you should see it went the whole family is involved in movie night, I swear no one moves from the couches for hours.” Natasha snorted at the image of her Steve Rogers, ‘hanging out’ on the couch with his family.
“Rhodey! Student Union in an hour! Bring friends!” Tony placed the phone back down and turned towards a very stressed looking Peter. His son was such a goodie two shoes. Seriously, no alcohol before 17! 17!? Like how has a member of the Stark family not had even a glass of wine at dinner ?! Jeez! It’s like Steve raised the kid, but even Steve drank! Peter was pacing in time with the clock tick, sounding his impending doom of going out with his dad.
Natasha threw her book at Peter, his spider-sense alerting him to the danger. He caught the book in his outstretched hand. Natasha smiled, “You miss them?” Peter nodded, “Sorry, just… sometimes I let myself think that i’m actually going home, back to my parents, I know that they are here technically! But… they just aren’t them, not yet, they aren’t confident, my dad would never second guess himself and my Pops, he wouldn’t just follow orders. I know it sounds stupid just… he’s a captain not a soldier.” Natasha slowly nodded and agreed, “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you get home and kick some sense into Steve’s commander voice.” The pair whipped their heads up to the faint sounds in the distance, the roar of engines flying nearby. “Might be sooner rather than later. Get ready kid.” Natasha reached over to the side table to throw Peter his web shooter. Natasha’s watch began to let out a series of beeps. Peter prepared for the worst, he only had a single web shooter capsule left.
He made a lot of noise as Tony and Happy helped him to his feet - Steve standing just behind them, staring down at Wesley like a bouncer. It took an agonisingly long time to cross the few feet of gravel to the car, but, miraculously, no one seemed to notice them in the meantime.
Steve tried to let go of that breath as subtly as he could. Of course, there was a very loud part of his brain still demanding that he hold onto this moment. The part of him that was trying to come up with
And, no, he wouldn’t have told Nat any of this - because he wasn’t an insensitive asshole. But that didn’t necessarily mean the thoughts were wrong.
God, he wanted to find the words for this. If he was going to have this breakdown, and all the consequences that came with it – he’d always wanted to much to find some way to say
Tony to – strip him naked and chain him to a bed. And, yeah, he’d been taught to feel guilty about all of
Tony’s stomach knotted with guilt when Bucky said that - because, yeah, Rhodey probably thought that too.
There was a sharp shriek of tortured metal as the punching bag snapped free of it’s chains, and then a dull crash as it hit the wall opposite him.
He felt Tony squeeze his shoulder again, before he slowly stroked his palm up to the back of Steve’s neck, letting it rest there…
If he just accepted the support that was already there for him, he was sure he could do damn near anything.
Jesus, there were a thousand reasons that Tony wasn’t just some guy, Steve could’ve told him exactly what he was thinking, when Tony thought he was thinking that-
He gave his head a shake, as though that could dislodge the daydreams that were already gathering. He made a point of looking up at the window, and the rainy Sunday afternoon that was flickering miserably on the other side of it, and reminded himself that he wasn’t missing out on anything right now…
“So, if you believe whatever bullshit your superiors told you, about trying to keep me calm and minimizing my trauma with this little charade - don’t bother. We’re well past that,” he told her, with a sigh. “And if you
“You found out that my parents had been killed by Hydra, you found out what they’d done to Bucky, and you told Sam all about it, and you told Nat all about it, and the three of you conducted a secret man hunt that lasted two years – and you were lying to me the whole time. And when the shit hit the fan, you prioritised helping Bucky over everything else, without doing any of the things you could have done to make it
But then Bucky had so casually informed him that they were going back for an ‘unscheduled appointment’ – and Steve
How it might’ve been different, if he hadn’t been forced to be ‘the guy in the spangly outfit’ at all.
Now, there was no reason to be selfless… no real meaning to the word ‘selfless’, no substance to the idea…
“Oh, Steve,” Bucky announced theatrically, leaning back in his chair and throwing an arm over his face. “I
cleverly done, in fact – so practiced and nuanced – that Steve had no choice but to be carried along with it, even now that he knew what Tony was doing.
Oh, this was going to be horrible. Beyond horrible. This was going to mean clawing every one of his worst nightmares to the surface, putting his entire sense of self, his whole concept of reality, into question…
that conversation, and how awful it would be… That I didn’t have any answers for you. And I couldn’t have that conversation without mentioning Bucky, and what was I going to do if you were furious at him, if you just needed to yell about him or… And then more time had passed, and I knew you’d ask me why I hadn’t told you before, and… All that time we
“More,” Steve whispered, far to quiet and breathy for Tony to have heard it. But Tony pushed into him again anyway, keeping to that new, relaxed pace. Pushing into Steve firm and deep – hitting that same spot again. And again. And again. Steve started out screaming sharply with every thrust, but pretty soon his lungs couldn’t keep up with it, and he was left to pant silently as every nerve in his body lit up over and over and over.
“Right, so I’m going to set this to run for a minute, and then check the data to make sure it’s doing what it should be,” Tony explained, as he sat back from his work. “No point putting everything back together, if we’re just going to have to do this all over again in a minute…” he gestured awkwardly towards the missing panel on Bucky’s arm,
He thought about his life. He just let all these unrestricted thoughts occur to him – what he really thought and why things were this way and what he could actually do about it…
knew he’d let his hurt push his anger to beyond the point of reason, aimed it in the wrong places and put it out of all context. He was sorry for that.
convinced him that we should partner up with the humans. Make an effort to learn their language, since they wouldn’t learn ours. Tell them they could use our research, and our labour, if they let us learn from their technology – but really, what they wanted was a scape goat. That’s what really convinced my Dad. Jayba said, if we let the humans use our slaves – and, you know, he just
There will also be other one shots, and yes, hopefully that sequel eventually - but I figure people can subscribe to the series if they're interested in it, so I won't be added a new chapter to this every time I add one 😂
The comfortable way he’d been sitting, how much better he felt for relaxing his shoulders for a while.
“And I should expect nothing less,” Tony answered theatrically, reaching out to take Steve’s empty bowl. And then he turned to throw both of them into the sink with the pans.
“Oh...Tony…” Steve whispered, as his hands reached out of their own accord, just following this an immediate urge to
“I don’t know either,” he whispered - tiptoeing around a conversation that he knew was coming anyway.
Steve felt himself pulling towards Tony in an entirely different way. An emotional longing, rather than a physical need – that urge throw your arms around someone in moments of joy and celebration, but so much stronger.
be in bed. An impression of himself as reckless and irresponsible and unhealthy. That weird impulse to calculate how many hours sleep he could fit in from here… Which didn’t really go anywhere, because Tony had completely forgotten if he had anything to do today.
He wasn’t thinking about anything besides being in Steve’s arms again, and rocking into that feeling, and kissing him-
about it, he was still wryly awaiting a punchline for the universe in punishment for being this smug-
relief. An overwhelming, all encompassing wave of relief that washed all the tension out of him. He felt his limbs turn to jelly, his eyes suddenly weighed down by the scale of this emotion…
He reached out to snatch it up, holding it between his thumb and forefinger, instinctively careful not to tear it-
Tony… fighting with something. Coming up against some vital, personal challenge, again and again – the same way he faced any impossible challenge. Back straight, eyes forward, ‘always alright’… And Steve had already worked out that he’d fallen for something, when he’d taken all that at face value. He’d already figured out that he’d missed so many of Tony’s deeper qualities, when he missed his hurt feelings… But
And, to be honest, it was the only item on this overwhelming list of problems that Steve felt capable of addressing. The
” Steve sobbed, subconsciously trying to roll his body up against Tony’s mouth. His balls tightened painfully, his cock weeping steadily against his skin – but that wasn’t the contact he wanted. Suddenly it felt as though his every sensation was centred right there beneath Tony’s lips. Waves of increasingly compulsive pleasure rolled through his body as Tony sucked harder at his skin, pulsing in him hotter and sharper-
to meet the guy. And, okay, Tony wasn’t exactly an expert… but, from the outside, to him at least, that seemed an awful lot like how regular people made friends.
Tony realised that, if he removed his own faulty hypothesis, and just asked himself the question – why might a
“I’ve missed you,” Steve whispered into Tony’s hair, sounding every bit as overcome as he was. Tony’s palms caressed against Steve’s back, reassuring and possessive, and everything Steve wanted to keep…
Steve had only been thinking of Tony, when he’d decided it was time to leave the White Room – at least in so far as he was up to thinking about anything, at that stage.
He hears the voice speaking now - familiar sounds rather than words he recognises… Although somehow he gathers the meaning…
Steve swallowed hard, and gave Tony’s arm a gentle squeeze, before burying a kiss somewhere in his hair… Tony couldn’t help feeling a little bit smug that his hunch seemed to be working out.
“Hm,” Steve smiled into his hair. And then, really just as a piece of mindless conversation, he added, “I assume you have a pool? For when I
“Did you just come?” Bucky asked through a laugh. Steve winced so hard it hurt his ribs - recognising that he was probably being a tad over-sensitive about the sexual references…
Steve walked over, already smiling gratefully when he took it from her. For a second or two after that she just looked up at him – her face so full of wonder and innocence that it made Tony’s heart ache.

to take these drugs. The fact that Steve would have to make himself a human guinea-pig to get to that stage in the first place. The possibility that they’d get there and realise they just needed an army – that they might’ve been able to bring one, if they hadn’t gotten themselves killed before they could raise the alarm…
Steve breathed a sigh, relieved that Tony’s stream of questions allowed him to stick to his script for a little while longer.
There had always been a procedure to prepare, or the hum or medical equipment, already booted up and waiting impatiently.
He was overwhelmed by the urge to touch him - fleetingly panicked that he might actually do it. Subconsciously, Steve tensed his arms at his sides, clenching his jaw so that nothing unfortunate could slip out.
this feeling, that believed there was no greater priority than holding on to this feeling - even if that proved futile. A part of him that knew this was important in and of itself, regardless of what happened next…

having – to Tony grabbing him like that. He thought he liked it, although he wasn’t sure why he liked it, or…
When, at last, Steve was forced to throw his head back and take a frantic gulp of air, Tony could hear the tension in it - like piano wire pulled to snapping point. He tightened his grip a little, working over the head of Steve’s cock in shorter, rougher motions - waiting until he felt Steve’s back brace before he whispered,
“Oh, right,” Tony accepted, and shook his head, and steeled his expression again. “And you’ve brought us here to go to a
,” he corrected – and then unthinkingly glanced at the body at the other end of the room. Tony looked over.
It was… very… dark. And he wanted to say very eighties, for some reason, but hey, how would he know…
From his spot at the edge of the huge infinity pool, Steve could watch the sun setting over the ocean, staining the sky and the water with a thousand shades of candy orange and pink... If he were to swim over to the other end of the pool, he would be able to look down over miles of unspoiled white sand, dotted with the lush green of palm trees.
referring back to mindless comments that Tony had made, when trying to work out what people were talking about…
And he was glad that Steve had had a chance to rest – and that he could just be glad about that, without all the other complexities.
The way Steve kissed his cheek when he said goodbye, his hand always resting in that same spot on Tony’s hip…
He paused, and felt the warmth of mild exertion pool in his lungs and his calves… and realised that he must’ve been walking around in this particular daydream for a while now. He smiled, blushing in front of himself-
Because, at any other time, hearing Tony so casually suggest that Bucky move in with him would’ve had Steve’s whole attention - and there
He remembered wishing that the two of them could steal a moment here, even though he didn’t know what he wanted to do with it, or why this moment should appeal to him so much
