“Er…” Sherlock glanced up, but John was absorbed in his mobile, his thumb tapping staccato over the screen. Angry by the line of tension running taut through him. Sherlock looked back down at Charlotte who was watching him expectantly. “Yes, yes, bees do indeed communicate through dancing. It’s one way they tell each other where food is, or, if they’re moving hives, where the new nest will be.”
“That should—“ Sherlock swallows. His back arching ever so slightly off the mattress. “That should keep us in pastry for at least a fortnight.”
John rubs his fingertips between Sherlock’s knuckles, down between his fingers, before stroking back, over his palms, and down his arms. Murmurs, “I should leave you to it. Let you get frustrated because you can’t get deep enough. Can’t slide down and take it deep like you want, can you? Can’t feel yourself leaking, hot and thick, down your throat.” John drags his palms up the outside of Sherlock’s thighs to cup Sherlock’s round cheeks and pry them wider, thumbs dipping in to tease around where Sherlock’s pulled taut and open.
“You love how I feel, how I move,” Sherlock says, his voice a mere whisper now, his face blissed out and slack. “I tell you how big you are, how thick, how I could happily die fucking your perfect, perfect cock.” He reaches behind him and grips the chair’s backrest, rising up on powerful thighs, and then he really starts to move.
“No, you just have X-ray brain powers to dissect them down to their pants. And you wield that power like a sodding god, lording it over our heads, that you know all of our dirty secrets—“
You’ve read that physicists really only understand 5% of what the universe is made up of. How then do these people who practically scream the word
Then the crash. Reality, barging in. A dirge, the violin wails. And then sinks. Foundering. The shouldering of a weight so ponderous, John still doesn’t know how he carried it for so long.
Outside: thunder claps. There is electricity in the air, lightning gathering it’s charge. Sherlock’s window is cracked open. Static raising the hair on John’s arms. The scent of wet stone rides in on the breeze. Raindrops pearl on the sill.
“When I was in rehab the first time I was matched up with this therapist, who, apart from being an idiot who believed that yoga was a proper substitute for cocaine—” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “—did have one useful piece of wisdom that has stuck with me ever since.”
“I’m not sure what they know. The case was widely reported, and the DI’s death was included, but I’m not sure that my part in all of it was ever made public knowledge. Why?”
A few rose to inspect him, but he sat very still, allowing them to walk up and down his forearms and over his knuckles. Two inquisitive ones landed on the lip of his thermos cup and dipped their antenna into the rising steam. Singed, they rose and shivered in the air as if sharing the experience with each other, as if they were saying to one another:
“I could hear you moving about.” His legs fall wider, knees bent, as he slips his other hand between his legs. John curses and reaches for the lube and the plug, his eyes never leaving the sight of those long, long fingers, petting at the furled bud and the coarse hairs. The lube leaves sticky tracks behind, gleaming fingerprints imprinted on the inside of his thigh. “Used to imagine you coming in; finding me like this.”
It will take them time to repair what happened, but, John thinks, at least they’re both willing to try.
Sherlock nods, maybe a tad tersely, a tad impatiently, and John smiles. “Thank you for humouring me,” he murmurs, and leans up to kiss Sherlock. At the slide of John’s mouth over his own, Sherlock forgets his frustration. He makes a small helpless noise in the back of his throat and presses himself against John eagerly. Sherlock wants to slip into that space he goes to when someone else is holding the reins. There is so much spinning outside of his control right now that it feels incredible to give it up for a short time and let the whirring machinery of his mind rest. Remembering how good it felt when he was on the counter, coming undone just to the sound of John’s direction, Sherlock closes his eyes as John says, “I love all the little noises you make for me when I touch you.” He noses down to press his open mouth to the thud thud thud of Sherlock’s heart, and Sherlock, lost inside the sensation, tips his head back and makes another one. “Just like that,” John says, his beard both soft and brusque across Sherlock’s throat. “I think I’d quite like to know what sounds you’d make for me, Sherlock—“ Sherlock grips John’s shoulders to keep from falling as John sucks gently on Sherlock’s pulse. “—when I turn you over my knee.”
“Will you let me? Will you just, just lay down with me? Just be with me. Just show me how. Please. I don’t care if we, if it’s not what you want, I don’t care if we don’t. I—”
Sherlock slowly turns his head so that his cheek is resting on John’s belly. “I said, you know I can’t withstand it when you talk dirty to me.”
“I’m not.” John sets his fork down. “Look, you’ve been…taking care of me the last two days. I wanted…to return the favor.”
“Occasionally the day is just too fine not to risk it,” John says dryly, and leans forward to tap on the glass partition that divides them from the driver. John lets him know they’ll be getting out and then scoots across the seat until he is pressed along the length of Sherlock’s thigh. The boy’s eyes drop to John’s lips and his breathing goes uneven. John sets his hand to Sherlock’s knee, fingers resting against the inseam of his trousers. The heat from Sherlock’s skin flushes against John’s palm, hot.
Sherlock twitches, but doesn’t move away. “Not funny,” he mutters, running his hands along the bottom of the tub.
“You came home and found Mrs. Hudson baking,” I continued. “A cake for Mrs. Turner who’s cat was just put down.” John smiled and dipped one finger into the bowl. He lifted it and, his eyes fixed on my mouth, slid it along my bottom lip. A reward.
It made me bury my hands in his hair and tilt his beloved face up to mine and kiss him, wanting to taste it on his tongue.
John hesitates for a moment, perplexed by the request, but then complies, sitting crosslegged on the bed, his back to the fireplace. The heat pulses against his skin and his front feels cold in contrast. He rubs at his arms as Sherlock moves to sitting across from him.
“I am not proposing that you leave. I am proposing that it would be safer for us both if we moved to London. Two women housing together in the city is far less conspicuous than two women co-habitating in the country.”
The words echoed all of the thoughts Sherlock had been hurling at himself. Stoning himself out of guilt, out of desperation, out of an instinct to distract from the pain.
“I used to be a private detective,” Sherlock said, hoping he wouldn’t have to go into much more detail.
John leans back, just a little, just far enough to roll his forehead against Sherlock’s. The position forces their eyes down. Down into the shadowed cup of their bodies. Down to where John is hard and straining and caught in the strip of white light jutting in from the hallway.
“I’m rather desperate for you to fuck me is all, and I need a moment to collect myself, or I’ll just end up frotting against you like an animal and it will be over in seconds.”
“No, no,” he said, waving his hands at me, “you stay where you are. Enjoy your bath. I’m going to finish dressing and then head down to the bar. I’ve laid out your things on the bed. Once you’re ready come down and we’ll go to dinner. You have—“ He broke off to look at his watch, “—a half an hour.”
“You like to kiss,” you say, starting with the obvious. John’s mouth slants up in a half smile that makes something warm unfurl in your chest that you recognise as affection.
Sherlock, head tucked beneath John's chin, curled into John's chest, says, with a sleepy, contented voice, that still stirs John intensely, "Take me to bed, John. I need to be with you. Please. I need you. Alone. Just us."
But he was cut off as the sound of a door opening in the hallway distracted him. Sherlock leaned forward in his seat to see Edith standing in her bedroom doorway, dressed in a pyjama set of faded yellow tulips. She clicked on the hallway light, looked around, up the stairs and at the front door, before flipping it off once more.
So. I guess I'm writing this now??? Apparently being stuck in a hotel room is great motivation to write porn. Oy. Any comments are, as always, greatly appreciated <3 <3 <3
Sherlock’s lips are flushed and swollen, plump and shiny and red. Fuck, what John wants to do to him.
It only takes a minute for Sherlock’s gaze to snap back onto John’s, hot. John recoils a little at the unexpected heat there.“Just like that?” Sherlock says, his words clipped.
Sherlock’s smile. The way the corner of his mouth tugs. Up. And up. Tugs at John’s heart as it goes.
John stiffens. He can feel his face, his spine, go rigid. It’s involuntary, but immediate. His teeth clench. Frustrated with himself, he wills his jaw to relax.
John opens his eyes and watches as Sherlock reaches over and pumps lube into the cup of his fingers. There is a soft blush moving up his chest, flushing the column of his throat. His eyes are dark with pupil as his gaze meets John’s, his hand wrapping around his erection.
Sherlock finds himself quickly divested of his clothes and being directed by John to the window that is currently looking out on what appears to be a strip of concrete warehouses. There’s a small table that’s been pulled out of a crevice in the wall below the window and Sherlock is lifted and set on top of it. John crowds between Sherlock’s legs and kisses Sherlock, bearing him back until Sherlock’s head is resting against the pane of glass.
Angry, John stalks past him, searching the suite for a blanket. Unable to locate one in his current mood, John strips the duvet off the bed, drags it into the foyer and drapes it over Sherlock’s prostrate body.
John’s tentacles refocus, moving beneath Sherlock to prop his hips up for a better angle, so that he can drive inside John and hit him where John needs him, where John needs Sherlock to fill him. When Sherlock’s heels slip against the tile, two slither down to wrap around his ankles and give him leverage to thrust up and meet John’s movements as he presses Sherlock’s wrists down into the ground and fucks himself on Sherlock’s cock.
, his eyes sparkled at me, and, gauntlet thrown, I leaned against the door frame, folding my arms across my chest and letting my eyes rake over him.
“Not to talk about the case,” Evan said, quickly. “I just think I could learn from you. If you’re amenable.”
John, careful with his knees, steps out of them, and then John is pulling his jumper, button-down, and vest off over his head, Sherlock helping when John is struggling a bit to get his cuffs undone.
“Well, all right, but you don’t have to be so rude about it!” Comes the shrill response as her footsteps carry her back down to the first floor.
Penny’s face lit up. “Oh, that’s wonderful!” She pulled out her mobile. “What’s your number? I'd love to help plan it with you.”
Sherlock held his phone cradled in his hand for five full minutes before he could bring himself to do it. Finally he swallowed around the bile in his throat and sent the text.
“Well, yes, that’s the point,” Sherlock says, and John shoots him a look from beneath his brows as he steps up to the table closest to him and sets his fingertips to the glass.
He slid his palms up my chest, his thumbs catching on my nipples as he went, and then, as I trembled, under the lapels of my coat, running them up and over my shoulders until the jacket was sliding down my arms and off. John picked it up and stepped over to the sideboard, an extravagant Belle Epoch piece of heavy mahogany and gold filigree, and folded it neatly on top.
“No.” Sherlock presses his hand to John’s shoulder to keep him from getting up, his fingers splaying across John’s scar. “No. You asked me to show you.”
John squints, the light still needling his eyes, trying to locate the information Sherlock needs in his sleep muddled brain. “There’s a linen closet in the bathroom.”
Above him had been a single man, a broad-shouldered, broad-chested solicitor with rugby-thickened thighs and misshapen cauliflower ears, and a Liverpudlian accent. He was friendly enough when they caught each other in the lift or while collecting their post, but who had the loudest sex that John had ever encountered, complete with 3am headboard smashing, absolutely filthy dirty-talking foreplay and interplay and afterplay interspersed with the shouting-moaning-cursing of their cumming-cumming-cummmmming-ahhhhhhh, and the incessant sounds of the bedlegs squeaking back and forth across the floor directly above John’s bed. Even earplugs did nothing to keep John from feeling like he was in the room with them, just lying right next to them on the juddering bed, as they fucked with feral abandon.
“No,” Sherlock says, tilting his head and studying John. “But I think you’re a good person, which is better.”
You don’t even have time to appreciate it because you have to throw out a hand to guide you through your doorway and then you’re both falling down onto the bed and he squirms electrically below you.
silk robe John has ever seen. The hem must hit him at his upper thighs when he’s standing straight because John can see the full curves of his arse cheeks in his current position. John makes it to the island, mouth agape, sweat breaking out in his hairline, an electric jolt making his cock harden almost instantaneously. He lets the bags sag about willy-nilly as, almost hypnotized, he sidles around the corner and comes to land a foot away as Sherlock twists, to set the milk jug on the counter. His eyes slide over his shoulder and meet John’s, his eyebrow cocked in what John thinks is invitation, and which is confirmed only moments later when he definitely sways his hips a little, blatantly bowing his back, the absolute tart, as he bends back over to presumably look for something else.
It feels so good that John loses himself for long minutes, is full up with pure unrelenting sensation so it’s a moment before he realises that Sherlock has moved down his body and his face is currently framed between John’s thighs, which Sherlock is parting, spreading, to get at, to lick at…
“Sherlock, we need to talk about this,” John says, quiet, but firm, as they gain altitude and the plane levels off.
Sherlock moves his hand away when he reaches John’s wrist and John shudders as the feeling crests, eddying out in sweet churning echoes.
John sighed and he tipped his head back to the sky, his eyes closed. “Charlotte’s mum, Mary, she’s got this very important job that she has to travel for.” Sherlock noted the way ‘important’ was dipped in contempt. “She was supposed to have Charlotte this weekend but she’s got to fly to America. Charlotte’s going to be crushed and I was planning on taking you down the pub to thank you for indulging my kid in all this. I appreciate it, you know, and I wanted to…”
“I’m practically shaking and you’re the picture of tranquility. What do you know that I don’t know?”
Primrose Hill rose before me, a dark patch in the dizzying sea of London’s lights surrounding it. I stopped and spun around, my eyes searching the blackened hillside.
“You didn’t have to give me a gift, you know.” John shifts a little against the pillows at his back, scooting his arse closer to Sherlock, he really doesn’t want to talk about
He groans for good measure around his finger. Closing his eyes at the saltbitter taste like it’s the best thing he’s had in weeks.
John’s fingers knead Sherlock’s cheeks, holding him open so that John can suckle gently at the rim of Sherlock’s hole, can rub the hair on his cheek against the grain, setting Sherlock’s tissue paper skin on fire. Sherlock squirms to get away, but John chases him, holding him, and does it to the other thigh until Sherlock is crying out.
“I want you lower. Would that be all right?” John requests and Sherlock nods. Gripping the hot core of him, John tugs, pulling Sherlock’s hips down, until his cock is snugged between John’s thighs and he is laid out across John’s lap, arse tipped up.
“What are you two doing up there?” And that’s Lestrade’s voice because of course it is. Life is patently unfair and horrible. John hadn't even managed to get Sherlock out of his shoes yet. He sits up and fishes their shirts up from the floor. He tosses the white one to Sherlock and begins to put on his own.
It might be the softest place on his body, downy silk against the tip of my nose when I burrowed there.
The skin around the base of the plug is slightly chafed. More lube is needed, and probably, John amends, needs to be removed altogether. Beneath John’s hand, which rests in the small of Sherlock’s back, he can feel Sherlock trembling. His thighs are quivering with exertion and the cords in the back of his neck are stretched taut. He’s breathing hard and his lips are chapped, his toes curled tightly as if he’s braced against something.
He gripped my hips and fucked me deep and hard, exactly the way I wanted it. I watched us in the mirror. The way he buried himself inside me as far as he could go, the look of concentration on his face as he watched the place where he disappeared inside my body, the sweat gleaming on his brow. His fingers bore into the scallops that circled my waist and I felt them tear through, his fingers slipping inside and digging into my hipbones. He was savage. He was wild.
“If you don’t know that already, you’re not as smart as you think,” John says, low, and continues reading.
John laughs softly under his breath as they’re led through into a large room, white and softly lit like the first. The walls are lined with shelves, with tables laid out throughout, covered in glass with their wares presented beneath. There are padded benches scattered here and there where one could sit and peruse the merchandise.
Not seeing any of the other inhabitants stirring, Sherlock squatted down and made a soft clicking sound with his tongue, his hand held out in invitation.
Sherlock shivers against him. A cataract of sensation that travels down John’s body in a tingling rush of goosebumps.
“Yes, but they had no Chopin or Bach, and I wanted to teach you how to waltz and this one seemed to match the overall tone of the day. So.” Sherlock takes a breath. “Will you?”
0 stories about the club released, a statement to the power and influence the men wielded, however the community could no longer take the risk of keeping John as a member, his reputation being tarnished.
Someone, either Evan or John, got him to get back into bed, tucked him in. He couldn't remember if he dreamed it or not, but he could vaguely remember someone stroking his hair as he fell asleep. It didn’t take long, Sherlock had been exhausted from the emotional toll of remembering what he had done to James the night before he died for Sherlock.
There is a vivacity to him that John has only witnessed in works of great art. He was made to be sculpted, drawn, seen, admired. His chiseled features and his skin that drinks moonlight, his ethereal eyes and his body’s graceful lines. He has always seemed otherworldly, untouchable. Complete unto himself.
Warmth spreads out through you, flushing you with arousal. It unfurls up your spine, a vine of sunlight twisting through you, it’s all the colours of dawn: grapefruit, goldenrod, saffron, peach. You sink your teeth into it, tear it open, and the juices run over, tart and sweet. You worry his bottom lip, just the same, to collect the softest of moans from his throat, to feel the way he swells and throbs with blood, the way he pushes into you, bringing your bodies together at last.
The work of self-worth was never finished. It required constant effort, constant vigilance, constant forgiveness, constant empathy. It was exhausting.
“Sherlock, we knew this wasn’t going to end well. We talked about this yesterday. I told you that I understood the stakes, that I understood the risk. Nothing has changed.”
You have undoubtedly heard of homing, that mysterious instinct inbred in an animal’s DNA that enables them to return to the exact place of their birth to breed or lay their eggs or, alternatively, leads them to their migratory resting place.
John smiles despite himself. It’s all ridiculous. If he can’t laugh about it, he’s doomed. He decides to go with the truth. “I had a prostate exam.”
When you did not move, I reached out and took your hand, tugging you forward until you were perched stiffly across my knees.
Once John is completely bare he kneels on the ground in front of Sherlock’s feet and casts his gaze up at him through his lashes.
Too far gone to protest, Sherlock straightens and, shaking, reaches behind him. John positions Sherlock’s hands on his arse cheeks and instructs him to hold himself open, while, slouching down further into the water, John reapplies his tongue.
“And I’ll belong to you. Say it.” Bitten off. Forced out on a harsh exhaled breath. John can see him struggling to get the words out, completely unaccustomed to asking for what he wants and needs. John is certain that in these types of situations before, from what he’s heard from Trevor and the others, the belonging was rather couched in terms of ownership and was thrust upon him, not asked for. It was often dependent on an exchange of money as well. “Please. I need you to say it.”
“This.” John gestures between them, trying to encompass the exchange of stories, the telling of truths, the debunking of shame. “The honesty and vulnerability that’s required for this type of relationship to work, it’s the sexiest thing in the god damn world to me.”
bed and he’s taking photos of you and he thinks you’re lovely of all confounding things, and it all makes your heart thud a bit wildly in your chest.
“It’s all right.” You gesture towards the door. “I’ll let you get dressed.” You make to leave, swinging your legs off the edge of the bed, but he catches your wrist.
“Right-o, that’s my cue to shove off then. Nice to see you, Sherlock. I’ll put the express on those results just as you requested.”
Sherlock was splitting wood when the Watsons found him. The last glimmering ribbons of mist clinging to the air as the sun streaked through the trees. Sherlock shrugged on his shirt and, buttoning it, went to meet them.
John, scrambling, dipped the spoon he had been using earlier into the bowl and then drizzled the chocolate directly onto his cock. The spoon clanged against the rim as he dropped it, sliding both of his hands into my hair and guiding me forward.
You curled into your armchair like a cat, drawing your feet up onto the seat, and regarded me with the same feline stare.
A man has slipped on behind them and takes the bench across from them, sliding an arm along the seatback and crossing his legs. He’s dressed impeccably in a finely tailored cerulean blue suit and gleaming leather shoes. His hair is black and slicked back from his forehead. He has the coldest, emptiest black eyes John has ever seen.
They lapse into a companionable silence, with only the fire popping in the grate and the rain falling softly outside as their backdrop. John can feel Sherlock studying him. “Do you associate pleasure with something bad?”
It was difficult to gauge what time it was, the daylight muted by his drawn curtains. He lay there for a moment, getting his bearings, as his temples throbbed.
John is already pushing his chair out and reaching down for him, leaning down to meet him, and crushing their mouth together in a desperate kiss that Sherlock feels explode through him in hot bursts of relief and pleasure.
Sherlock bows his back and moans around the tentacle in his mouth as the sensation snaps sharply through him.
Sherlock’s hands are shaking too hard, he fumbles with the lid, curses. John turns them, Sherlock sitting up against the headboard with John straddling his thighs and his slippery wet fingers between his legs, pumping. From a distance Sherlock can feel the lube drip drop onto the tops of his legs; he doesn’t truly feel anything, all of him thick and numb and slipping towards that space where he can experience oblivion, until John is fully seated, and is saying to him as through a wall of glass: “Sherlock, don’t turn off, stay with me.”
“How long were you with Moriarty?” John asks, unable to keep the obvious curiosity from his voice. He’s heard rumours of course, but John would rather get the truth from Sherlock.
“Irene,” he says, nodding to her after he swallows the smoky scorch of the spirit down. John is very aware of the fact that he is naked but for his robe.
Sherlock’s quiet, still pumping his fingers slowly, slowly, torturously slowly, inside John. John, his desperate heart pounding, hammering, yammering against his ribs, reaches between them and takes them in hand. Their cocks are slick with pre-come and sweat and glide against each other. John can’t fit them both in his hand at once so he drags his palm over the silky, plump heads. Opens his mouth against Sherlock’s and sucks on his tongue. John clenches around Sherlock and Sherlock groans, pushing his cock into John’s hand.
Sherlock moans, eyes closed, jerking his chin in a nod, as John fucks him harder, letting the brutal slap of their thighs fill the room.
And then John’s hands are parting Sherlock’s cheeks and there’s no more teasing, no more fannying about, there’s only the broad wet glide of John’s tongue over the throbbing entrance to Sherlock’s body and the long, shocked moan that it elicits.
“And what would make you happy, Sherlock? To be in the loo all morning tomorrow and feeling positively wretched all day? I only want the same, you know, and I can’t imagine the side effects would accomplish it.”
“Ah, it was all cold hard logic was it?” he said, grinning, and my heart soared and I kissed the smile from his lips.
Ellen rolled her eyes in exasperation, but she was smiling. “She rarely drinks, so when she does she gets soused pretty quickly.”
“Trevor and the other boys wanted to be groomed to enter the business world. Shadowing me was helpful to what they wanted to ultimately achieve. But that’s not what you want is it?”
“You don’t have to imagine it,” Sherlock says, hand moving faster and faster. “Because I didn’t put in my notice. I’m still your assistant. And if you have to go to New York three days early to deal with that Novarsky issue before the gala, then I’m going with you.”
John sighs, seeing where this is headed. “Let me guess, you don’t get your trust fund unless you complete your time here?”
Fingers tousling the satiny curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock’s arms warm and heavy around John’s back.
Sherlock doesn’t look up. He’s lying in bed, the duvet tucked loosely around his waist, typing in that manic way he has, fingers tapping emphatically at the glass screen as if he can communicate his irritation through sheer force alone. He looks peeved. It must be Lestrade then. A case.
And now. What Sherlock looks like when he’s shut off. When John’s simmering seething bubbling boiling tongue is shutting him off shutting him down taking him where John can’t follow.
There are times when I simply want to be taken. To be overpowered by you. We have spoken of it between us before. How illicit it feels to give up control, how thrilling it is to be roughly handled, to be vulnerable and completely in someone else’s hands.
“Noor, explain to me please why you even bother coming here at all?” Ruby Tallis, Tom’s ally, asked in a bored drawl.
Tom sighed, theatrically. While these arguments between Tom and Noor were rather common, Sherlock could feel his distaste for Tom grow with each meeting. The man was insecure and defensive and always added tension to the meetings that Sherlock felt were rather petty and immature in nature.
He’s safe. He’s spent many nights in this bed. The smells are familiar, the sounds too. As Sherlock moves about, undressing, John knows which floorboards will creak and how the wardrobe latch will sound when it swings shut. The sight of Sherlock’s naked body has also become familiar to him, adored, beloved. As John lies there he picks out the beauty marks on Sherlock’s skin, the places where blue shadows gather and pool, the places where the light spills, burnishing him.
“Daddy!” Charlotte said, leaping out of her chair. “Daddy, guess what?” Her eyes were bright and her face was wiggling wildly, her eyebrows and mouth and nose twitching in excitement.
He’s trembling again. He lets go. He doesn’t need it, he realizes. Doesn’t even need porn or one of his standby fantasies. He could come like this. He
They haven’t said a word since John walked in, but John can feel the energy building between them. It’s palpable. It must, he muses, be glaringly apparent to anyone who sees them together. It must, he thinks, be apparent from Mars.
And what use is pretence here? So you draw two of his fingers into your mouth, get them wet, and then slip them between your legs.
“The coppers are all over the place,” a woman was saying in hushed undertones one aisle over. “My Janet works for the medical examiner, you know, oh it’s a grisly job, Claire, just awful, and they got a call not an hour ago. Rumour is it was that woman who’s been all over the papers asserting her claim to a baronetcy.”
“My friends, Zoe and Ellen. I’ve been sharing some of the things I’ve been going through with them.”
Sherlock had said. The vulnerability of it makes John arch, hips pushing up, searching for more contact.  A small moan escaping his lips as Sherlock takes his hands away to add yet more oil to John’s aching prick.
“You did warn me,” John says, wry, but aching at this brutally succinct summation of events. It is just like Sherlock to cut to the very heart of things, tender parts unspared by the blade. Sherlock nods, his gaze still zeroed in on John as if trying to divine his next thought.
And below him, held safe within the boundaries of his arms, his words, his body, you break apart into a hundred-thousand pieces.
Sherlock’s marrow is throbbing with how much he wants it, but he’s speechless, breathless, overcome, as he so often is when he’s in John’s arms, and so all he can do is nod helplessly. John lifts his mouth to Sherlock and Sherlock bends to touch them together, moaning at the soft slick slide of John’s lips under his. This man may perplex Sherlock utterly, but he also moors him in a way no one else has ever done for Sherlock. Something has shifted. That unnameable thing he has been searching for from this dynamic for so long has finally been offered to him, freely, no strings. Sherlock has been set before a feast and told to take what he likes and he doesn’t yet know how to do it. Thank God he has John to guide him.
“It’s. It’s—“ you start to say: a one night stand, but it would be a lie wouldn’t it? It is, quite frankly, the most inaccurate word for whatever it is happening between you that you could choose. It is, however, the only one that will do. You have only the one night. You stop in an agitated stutter and he smiles kindly up at you.
John’s not fully hard yet. His foreskin still sheathes the head, but he’s filling, slowly. A steady pump of blood and arousal. Sherlock’s touch distracts him, pulling his attention elsewhere, dividing it, so that John’s mind is fractured and unable to concentrate on any one area.
Sherlock hadn’t eaten two bites of the Bolognese John had made for their dinner before he’d fucked off to the shower when it was his turn to do the washing up. And when he’d come out, smelling delicious and clean and soft, he had then started humping John from behind like an addlepated poodle, whinging for a blow job.
“I think,” John says, sitting up and leaning his forearms on the edge of the tub, “that I’ve earned a bit of a reward don’t you think?”
Finishing his coffee, Sherlock climbed down carefully from his perch on top of the hives and walked to his car. Zipping himself into his bee suit, he got to work.
Sherlock rolls over onto his stomach and John gasps as his cock slips out of the warmth of his body and into the cold icy crush of the air.
Down to the very last vein and ridge, it’s perfect. It even closely captures the texture of John’s foreskin and when John thumbs at it it rolls down the shaft fluidly to reveal the the exact flare of his head. Only the bollocks that hang below it are an approximation. John had been very clear about where they could and could not put plaster, after all.
“Imagine the night we met.” John drops his voice, lets it grow deeper, rougher, as his lips hover beside Sherlock’s ear. “Imagine instead it was a first date. Imagine it was going well. Imagine me walking you home after dinner. And us pausing to say good night on the front stoop.
Honestly, folx, I start grad school again on Monday and I've been writing at a fever pace over the last few weeks because I'm not sure if I'll have much time over the next few months to write. This interlude will be broken up into multiple, POV shifting chapters (I'm experimenting with how that affects pacing/tension build up/etc.) and I'll try and post as many of them as I can before reality hits tomorrow! Sending you all love. I hope you and yours are healthy and well.
“I hope you have a chance to relax this weekend. I’m sure I’ll be seeing you?” Sherlock said, unable to help himself, his hand on the door knob.
Carrying the smoker in front of him, Sherlock puffed one silky, pearl-gray stream inside the entrance of the first hive and then waited a minute for the smoke to take effect before slipping the pry bar beneath the left corner of the box and levering it up.
Taken from Wikipedia: American foulbrood is caused by the spore-forming bacteria Paenibacillus larvae and is a highly infectious bee disease. It is the most widespread and destructive of the bee brood diseases.
“Which is where?” Sherlock takes another bite from the apple and the crunch sounds loudly in the quiet room.
John wants to reward him so he slides one hand into the cool curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck and cups his head. John hears the way Sherlock’s breath alters in that moment. He intentionally slows it, drawing air deep into his lungs. John watches Sherlock’s ribs expand, his belly fill. He lets it out in a slow, controlled rush. It tickles the ends of John’s beard. His breath smells of mint.
“No, Sherlock, I don’t,” John says, as genuine as he ever is, and Sherlock, for some unfathomable reason, believes him.
“To put it mildly,” Sherlock says sardonically. “He’s not just a drug dealer or a human trafficker or funding terrorists through arms sales, he’s also involved in white collar crime. It entirely depends on the opportunity presented to him and what he stands to gain. He’s never at risk, he’s merely in the background, pulling the strings and reaping the rewards.”
“Up until that point I had been asking the wrong question: Why? On the surface there was no rhyme or reason why people did the awful, nonsensical things they did. So I switched it. I decided to find out how. At crime scenes the how will lead you to the why. If I could accept that the equilibrium of the system was at it’s core, unpredictable, I could accept that I couldn’t change it, but that I could in some small part work to control the damage. And I do that through seeing justice served. If the world was a puzzle, then I would be a puzzle solver.
To believe that this deficient body was beautiful, was worthy, was capable of more than misery and pain?
“We’ll go at your pace,” John soothes, and then Sherlock, words tripping over each other, quick, “I want to do it right.”
Clara interjects, her voice lower, calmer, “John, for me, it was a matter of trust. I loved your sister, I still love her, but too much had happened before Harry got into recovery. Too much hurt caused, on both sides. I couldn’t trust her or myself to love each other the way we needed to. And that’s why we split.”
“You don’t know Moriarty; I do. I can’t have there be a power struggle between us when it comes to taking action.”
They sleep this way. For what feels like hours, but in actuality is only a handful of minutes, Nora’s voice waking them to announce their imminent descent into New York. Her long experience serving as John Watson’s stewardess means that she lets them know with enough time to apply salve and giggle and dress and kiss and become presentable again. Experience that has taught her to always carry ear plugs with her wherever they go.
John trails the sponge back up, over Sherlock’s pectorals, brushing over the tight knots of his nipples, which makes Sherlock draw in a shaky breath.
“One I’m sure you’ll excel at, no doubt,” John says dryly, teasing. “You have a rebound rate the likes of which I’ve never seen. I’m a bit jealous, to be honest.”
He tucked his face into my neck and canted his mouth up so that he was speaking against my ear. “I’m going to feed you every inch of my big cock. Every. Single. Inch. I need you ready for me, my love.
But Sherlock shakes his head no. “Tonight,” he says, giving John a quick kiss and then moving to gather his coat from the hook on the wall.
“Fuck,” Sherlock says as the driver comes over the intercom to tell them they’ve arrived. He begins to push back from John, in order to climb off him, but John grips his arms and holds him still.
“I suppose that must be true,” John says eventually, accepting this in that befuddling way of his, resuming his stroking, but this time up Sherlock’s back. “I don’t want you to be afraid of me, Sherlock. If there’s something you’d like to do with me, or, to me, you should always feel free to broach it.”
“But isn’t that risky?” Ellen said, her blonde brows furrowing. “What about all the diseases? They seem terribly vulnerable to me.”
He races into the sitting room, does a quick cursory glance, only to find it empty. He is just stepping into the kitchen when he feels the air behind him move.
“Quite well,” John said, nodding. “It’s why we moved out here, actually. They have an affirming, inclusive model that we were struggling to find in London.”
“You need to call the doctor,” Sherlock said, his voice coming out hoarse and crackly, tearing his eyes away from hers. He couldn’t stand the pity there. It made him think of the night before and it was unbearable.
“My father shared a story with me the night I came to find you at Harry’s.” They both wince a little at the memory, now somewhat less painful for the months that have passed since Christmas, but still, it twinges, an ache in a ghost limb, these things they carry around.
John would be lying if he said he never did. The last six months had been a series of brutal hits. On the eve of a new year he was reflecting on how to move forward.
“Bugger,” Sherlock muttered, pushing himself up to standing and wiping his mud caked fingers off on his trousers.
John doesn’t expect Sherlock to be awake when he returns, heavily laden with bags and no answers to his questions, a little while later.
“And what if I need this,” Sherlock gestures, tea sloshing up and over the rim of the mug and spattering onto the duvet. Irritated, Sherlock glares at it as he sets it down on the bedside table.
The pit where they had burned the hives needed to be covered with earth, any smouldering coals smothered.
Excitement begins to hum through him, buzzing against his skin, the risk of exposure making his heart pound.
Wasn’t that why Sherlock was in Sussex? To change? To exit the cycle? To be accountable for the years he had spent harming himself and others? To do things differently?
John wants to reach out and sweep the hair off his brow. Kiss him. Hold him. Ease him. “What else, Sherlock? What else would it mean to be mine?”
Sherlock’s eyes: wide and blue above him. Not washed out. Not red. So clear and blue and staring into John as John spreads his legs to gather him closer, to hook his legs behind him, to bring him close enough to kiss. And kiss.
“That’s very noble of you, John, however might you consider that I’d like to have sex with you, perhaps? That I’d like to be intimate with my husband even if he’d rather spend time tending to the muscled nuisance of a neighbour while his sexually defunct partner withers away in the background? Is that so surprising? That I’d want my husband to remember why he ever bothered with me in the first place?”
When he reaches the top on his third pass, John closes his mouth and kisses back down. Soft. Chaste.
“Now, I tell you what we are going to do. I am going to lay you down on our bed and I’m going to ask you where you would like to be touched and then I am going to give you the greatest orgasm of your life. How does that sound?”
Charlotte tipped the sheaf of papers away from her chest and rifled through them until she found the correct page. She held it up for Sherlock. There was a large figure 8 drawn on the page and a bee walking it. “Like this?”
I am going to be out of town next week so I might have to break my streak, but it still remains to be seen. Thanks for being here all the same <3 <3
Sherlock’s eyes are washed out in the white light. John draws his thumb over his cheek to tuck his curls back behind his ear.
Sherlock almost bites down on the one in his mouth and John, feeling the tension in Sherlock’s jaw jerks it out in time, to let Sherlock breathe. To let him breathe and breathe and breathe as he grinds his arse down on the fullness of a tentacle with a fresh hot load for him, one that is currently pounding inside him at a frantic pace. The force of it’s fucking pushes Sherlock forward, thrusting his cock into the tentacle that grips him and he cries out, his shout ringing off the tiled walls around him.
John tosses his cardigan in the general direction of the sofa. The black leather is cool at his back through the thin layer of his shirt as he resettles. Sherlock cups his hands around John’s ankles, strokes up the back of his calves. It tickles the hair on his legs.
He licks his lips. Roses, pink, pink. Prick. Prickling up. Your skin under his hands. “I’ve spent the last week with people who talked of nothing but their last moments.” Dark lashes lowered against his cheeks. “They didn’t know it was their last night, last morning, last kiss, last word and they—. We’re soldiers, yeah? But you can’t know. You can’t
John’s heart is thudding against his ribs. His breath is coming in shallow pulls. He feels faintly light headed and he wonders, detachedly, if he is about to have a panic attack.
The girl nodded as if this made sense, looking at the hives with new interest and a piqued curiosity. Most children would have shied away from the bees, taught to fear them by skittish adults, but she didn’t retreat, just watched them fly about with a pair of big brown eyes. Sherlock wondered how old she was. She stroked Carrot’s fur, her fingers sinking into the sleek coat. Sherlock could hear the deep contented purr from where he stood a few feet away.
John shakes his head, dragging his face against the angled planes of Sherlock’s back. Rubbing his bristling stubble all over the fine fair skin.
His voice ground down into you, rough, “I knew the moment I saw you.” They can hear you moan, those Thursday people, they must, they must be able to hear you all these stories up in the quiet unbroken night, all these small noises you are making as he whispers in your ear. “I had to have you. Had to touch you. Had to kiss you.” Tongue curling around and in. Fingers curling up and in. “Knew you were magnificent. Unlike anyone I’d ever seen. I had to, oh, Sherlock.”
So while the kisses have been manifold and plenty, the actual act of lovemaking had been sparse and few between. It was therefore a rare treasure for my cock to be hard of its own accord and filling John’s hand prodigiously and neither of us wanted to waste it. Offering up a silent prayer of thanks to Catullus I lowered myself onto my back, letting my legs fall open as John urged my jeans down over my thighs.
Eating straight from the tin and sipping tea Sherlock set his mind to unpacking the problem. As he worked, the fire warmed him, the apples and cinnamon contented him, and the chamomile calmed him. Despite the fact that the solution remained maddeningly out of reach, Sherlock felt far better than he had the night before.
Unable to settle to anything inside and assiduously avoiding the newspapers with their headlines crying murder which were splashed across his kitchen table,  he brought his violin outside and stood before his hives.
It’s the biggest of the three that Sherlock had purchased on his way back to the hotel yesterday and had taken John slowly working him open with the other two before this one would fit. But if Sherlock is going to take John’s cock then he needs to properly prepared for it, and this one was just big enough to do the job. As John pulls gently at the base the widest part of the plug catches inside Sherlock’s body and resists.
John kisses down Sherlock’s body, as the tentacle inside Sherlock reaches the bright knot of his pleasure and strokes it once.
“This deal isn’t right. I don’t want to pretend anymore. I don’t care what’s going on with Novarsky. I care about you. I want to be with you. I’ll let my people reach out to Irene. We’ll fly back first thing tomorrow and start working on this Moriarty thing. Ok?”
“And when have I given you the impression that I was in danger of that? When have I ever given you the impression that I would do that to you again?”
He looks utterly at peace. His face is at ease, all the lines smoothed out. He could be asleep, but John can see the smile quivering at the corners of his mouth.
“He was investigating the murder of one of M’s associates and I’ve given him all the information I had, but M might as well not exist. He leaves no trace, has others do his dirty work for him. I have serious doubts about whether Lestrade will even be able to do anything. And—“
Resting his elbow on the back of the bench John leaned in, his mouth close to my ear. “Are you wearing them?”
“Ah ha ha.” Sherlock collapses back against his mattress, a goofy smile contorting his mouth, his eyes squeezed shut. His whole fair body flushed like sherbet skies at dawn.
You are thirty-three and a grown-up and this is quite pathetic. One ordinary man cannot come into your life for one ordinary Thursday night and upend things so neatly.
Sherlock is naked within seconds and clambering in with a splash, settling back against John’s chest, his long pale body cradled between John’s legs, the water swelling up his chest to lap at his collarbones.
You’re thirty-five when you whisper, “I love you,” for the first time into the soft silvering vee of hair tapering at the nape of his neck. All of the big sentimental silly cliche feelings you’ve been denying redacted no longer.
“If I. If.” He struggles. Jaw clenched. Looking down. Hands turning his beret in his hands. Around and around. You stand in front of him, wrapped in blue silk. Your mouth tastes like ash and you long for a cigarette. For something to do with your hands. For something, anything, to cut the pain in your chest. Sweat springs up, sticks the silk to you. The heat of the day already pressing like embers into your cheeks. The smell of your body spiking the air with salt.
“You’re not. Sit.” Sherlock handed him the bag of sugar and turned back to finish the meal. It was only a matter of minutes now, frying the rice until it was brown and crispy and then throwing in the frozen carrots and peas, the soy sauce, the sliced scallions, and the shrimp and egg mix.
“It is,” Claire says slowly, her eyes darting to John, clearly uncomfortable that Sherlock has said out loud what she had been implying: that John has overstayed his welcome.
As Sherlock reviewed his notes he felt a knot of worry twist in his stomach. Dread at what he could find tomorrow. He comforted himself with the reminder that these hives were out of range of his infected hives and that loss was a part of beekeeping. There were simply too many variables to control for. A beekeeper did their best. He was doing his best.
John’s eyes squeezed shut for a moment as this confession landed. When he opened them his mouth was smiling, that irresistible little half smile that did things to Sherlock.
John, overflowing with fondness, bites back a laugh as Sherlock finally shucks them into the corner, glaring at them.
He sharpens his tongue to a point and enters Sherlock slowly, pushing his inexorable way in. Sherlock’s body spasms around him, involuntarily clutching at him, gently, in a rolling clenching motion. John begins to fuck him with the tip, bobbing his head to get as deep as he can as Sherlock buries his head in the sheets and cries out. John leans back and spits on Sherlock's hole, running his fingertips around the swelling rim. When he returns his tongue to Sherlock, his beard brushing against the inside of Sherlock’s arse cheeks is excruciatingly pleasurable, sending stinging jolts of ecstatic pain striking out through him. Sherlock’s toes cramp he curls them so tight. His breath comes in short gasping bursts, his heart beating wildly in his ears.
Ellen. Why had Ellen been here? Sherlock crooked his elbow over his face, wishing he could disappear. Had the entire town been witness to his breakdown?
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth ticks up and then he rolls his head on his pillow, shifting his legs, his hips, his shoulders; getting comfortable. His eyes slide shut and his breathing slows down, becoming intentionally deep. John watches the rise and fall of his chest, and then does the same, mirroring Sherlock’s movements.
It makes John smile. “I mean,” he says, taking a step closer so that the borders of their bodies brush against each other. The rough woolen edges of Sherlock's coat hemming them in. “Did you used to have a plug up you sometimes when we would get called out to crime scenes?”
“To his UK operations, yes. Especially this factory in Liverpool.” Sherlock taps the only article of the three that had made the front page. “To the scope of his empire, however? It’s a drop in the bucket.”
“Want to come up here so I can thank you properly?” John cups Sherlock’s face. It's the only place he can reach.
When Sherlock pulls taut, a bow string ready to snap, and his legs float off John’s shoulders, like he’s levitating, John knows he’s almost there.
He pads across the worn lino patterned with faded roses, trailing the soap tinged steam from the bathroom behind him. He’s emanating heat; you can feel the humid burn of it singe your skin as he stops just in front of you.
Sherlock is a bundle of nerves beneath the table. He second guesses himself, wondering if he had fucked up. Was John angry with him? Had Sherlock misread him? His heart thunders in his ears as he hears, distantly, John saying that he needs to make a phone call and would Nick please lock the door behind him on the way out? Sherlock waits for the rest of the people to pass by him and for the click of the lock in jamb before he crawls forward.
“Honestly, who could say no to an offer like that?” John says, laughing. As long as he's with Sherlock, he'd do whatever needed doing. And if that meant tagging along after him, loving him, then John would count it a life well lived.
You can tell it pleases Molly, your almost morgue friend, when you ask her to take your picture in the lab. You tell her it’s for an experiment, something to do with a case.
“I want you to sit on that sofa over there and I want to climb in your lap and I want you to put your cock inside me.”
,” he exhales shakily, crooking one arm over his eyes to hide from, what must be, the purely ravenous way you are devouring him with your gaze. His breath quickens, tripping, skipping; his cheeks are stained to scarlet beneath his elbow.
It is dark aside from Manhattan glowing through the window panes. Sherlock lies where John left him, curled on his right side. The duvet is pulled to his waist, one arm stretched out beneath John’s pillow, one large hand splayed against the sheets. His face is relaxed as John leans down to kiss his forehead, murmuring his name.
He runs his thumb through an ice cream trail and spreads it in a circle around the outside of Sherlock’s hole. Rubbing it into the coarse sparse springy hair before he leans forward to lick it clean.
Saying to Sherlock, with his hands sunk to his wrists in his curls, and licking into Sherlock’s mouth in between sentences, “Could take you anywhere, if you stay quiet like that, just like that, my boy, could bend you over the table and fuck you through conference calls, could put you on your hands and knees on top of my desk and eat you out with my door open at lunch time, when all and sundry could walk in and see my tongue in your arse. You know just what I need Sherlock, fuck, look at what just your hand is doing to me,” shuddering, panting, “It’s too bad you’re not my assistant anymore or I’d take you with me on this trip tonight. What would we do up there thousands of miles above the earth? Just you and me?”
John’s still sort of, not really, but, yes, actually, definitely is, thinking about it two days later as he and Sherlock are making their way through Mayfair, having just come from Harrods in Knightsbridge and a curiosity shop in Piccadilly, and are heading for Oxford Circus, the Underground, and home. People push around them, grunting and swearing under their breaths at their slow pace, heads turned down against the cold.
John pushes in the rest of the way and collapses down on to his elbows. Fingers curling over the edge of the mattress beneath Sherlock’s pillow so that he has the leverage to give him what he needs.
“Hi,” Sherlock said, turning to retrieve the large box that Zoe had put together for him. It was the last of his things so he pulled the trunk door closed before turning back around.
“I think you probably all know the story by now.” Sherlock glanced around the room and was met with varying degrees of pitying nods and compassionate eyes. “I’d like to discuss what to do about the fact that Oliver didn’t alert us, which, I understand the man is going through some difficult family hardships, however it doesn’t sit right with me that this loss was entirely preventable.”
When John pulls away the firelight floods back in, gilding Sherlock. Sparking crimson in the silken sable folds of his curls.
When he’s done he pauses for a moment at the sink, looking at the fogged glass panes of Sherlock’s ensuite door. The air swirls around him, thick with steam. It clings to John’s skin, sticky and warm.
Tonight, John doesn’t have to rush back to the manse to let Jenny out and feed her. He doesn’t have to worry about waking up in a stranger’s hotel room with a man whose name he does not know, but whose hands and tongue know him biblically.
“I’m in here,” John calls from the bedroom at the back of the plane, voice muffled through the thin wall between them. Sherlock unbuckles his seat belt and goes to join him.
When Sherlock pulls his fingers out and slips them between John’s legs, John is a mess. Saliva cooling on his cheeks and chin, a trickle tracking down the side of his neck. But he can’t care because Sherlock is circling, circling, circling. Maddeningly little circles that wind John up before they
“But you’re different, aren’t you? You’re quite extraordinary, I think. So, er, thank you, I guess. Yeah. Thank you for not…for…well…”
John swallows thickly. Bends down and takes a sip. The whiskey burns on the way down, but John can feel faint flickers of warmth take hold in his stomach. It steadies him. Enough for him to meet Sherlock’s indifferent gaze once more.
“Nonsense. How’re Tuesdays to start? Hayley can grab her after her field hockey practice and bring her by.”
Sherlock turns to face him, twisting his long body and resting his forearm on the tabletop. John nods slowly; the words strike him as true. When he had met Sherlock, when he had felt like he was helping people once more, that he was useful, it had turned his life around. He no longer cleaned and maintained a gun with almost religious reverence. He no longer traveled the length and breadth of all of London’s boroughs to keep from putting that well oiled barrel in his mouth and swallowing a bullet.
“If at any time over the next few days you feel like you need help, as memories resurface, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here for you, Sherlock.”
“This situation with Moriarty is prompting me to tell you this earlier than it might have come out naturally. I would have liked more time with you for this to unfold at its own pace, but needs must. I care about you, Sherlock. And I want to stand by you through this. There is no need for you to reciprocate, however I do need you to accept that my affection and my protection are offered to you freely, without strings. I can see you telling yourself many stories about why I’ve offered you all of this in order to make it easier to accept it or, perhaps, decline it. I don’t want there to be any doubt.”
John stands a little straighter, puffing out his chest, and comes close to losing it again when Sherlock bites his lip and speeds up his pace a bit in response. “All right, carry on.”
“I suppose,” John says, feeling wary of whatever Sherlock is about to say. He feels ill matched, as if he is playing a game against a superior opponent.
“Sherlock, come here,” John says, softly, his eyes so dark and full of emotion. His hands run down the insides of his thighs and Sherlock watches as John’s cock, lying soft along the crease where his leg meets his hip, slowly begins fill. “I want you inside me. Now.”
Sherlock flops backwards, almost dislodging John from his lap, and flails a hand out towards his bedside table. He switches on the light and they both flinch at the sudden brightness. A minute later he produces a bottle identical to the one that he had ordered for John.
When he has reached John’s coccyx Sherlock turns his head and rests his cheek on the swell of John’s arse.
“John!” Sherlock’s face lights up as he hops down from his perch with all the grace of a gangly giraffe. John adores him.
But there was something in there that challenged John to look at his own relationship to pleasure and wonder why his automatic association with it was sin. Why did he think pleasure was something to be enjoyed only rarely and in small amounts? That it was something that needed to be earned? Was it simply a matter of the class difference between him and Sherlock? When pleasure was hard to come by, had an ethos been built up to turn it into a matter of value and merit, obscuring the real culprit of extreme income inequality?
John nodded, standing in the orangish glow of the kitchen light, hands in his pockets. The kettle began to rumble and he turned his body slightly toward it, though his eyes stayed on Sherlock. “I’m sure Charlotte will have loads more to ask you next week.”
He’s sweating. His palms. Under his arms. In the backs of his knees. He shifts against the sheets. They stick to his back, his buttocks, his calves.
“Salt,” I said, licking my lips, sweat a thick brine on my tongue, as I closed my eyes against the sight of you licking beads of sweat from the springy coils that surrounded my spent cock, which was growing thicker by the second. Thinking to myself, she would have smelled like the breeze off a sunlit sea. “Wet,” I said out loud, “she would have been soaking,” and you groaned into my skin, opening your hot wet mouth on the flushed skin of my inner thigh as my legs fell wider, my hips hitching up, my hand digging in, pushing you down, down, until you sucked and sucked and sucked. Leaving me purple and throbbing, stinging all over; a twin to the one on my neck. Thinking,
“While I’m entirely tempted to test out what I’m sure are your exceptional oral skills what I really want is for you to sit on my face. Now.”
“Yeah, we should— hey, what’re those?” John catches sight of a sheaf of papers rolled up and sticking out of Sherlock’s right coat pocket which is draped over the arm of the sofa.
His voice comes quietly from behind Sherlock as he steps onto the crowded elevator a moment later, “Be on the ready, then, Sherlock. Today just became very, very interesting.”
, John prevaricates, unable to shake the feeling that he has done something wrong. He feels like something vital ruptured in that moment, some wall he had built for self-preservation stripped away. He feels strangely weak, dizzy, as if he’s suffering from blood loss.
“You feel so good,” Sherlock says, pushing up onto his hands, eyes fluttering, closing, rolling back as his cock plunges and stretches and fills John.
He could hear the rain sheeting on the glass. Could see the bare outline of the window, the panes smudged in chalky ash against the dark outside. Sherlock focused on it until his heart rate had returned to normal, his breathing becoming slow and regular.
Only when you’re satisfied that the imprint will last the week do you move on. Up the tensed bulge of his bicep, pushing his arm up as you go until you can bury your nose in the coarse hair that grows underneath. You flatten your tongue against it and swipe up, licking the sweat and the animal tang of his body into your mouth. It makes him gasp and tremble wildly. You do it again, scraping your teeth through the wiry thicket to coax another deep, broken sound from him, before you relent, and suck sloppy wet kisses down his side. He giggles and tries to push you away, his knees dug into your sides. You cannot resist his laughing mouth and you take a brief interlude to kiss him, sharing the musky-dark taste of his body between you.
Resigned John shoves the sushi in the fridge with a menacing DO NOT TOUCH IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE written on it in sharpie. Allison is waiting for him in the hallway with a chart. John falls into step beside her and tries to school the frown from his mouth as Allison swings open the door to Room 5.
“Stop, stop,” he panted, pushing my hand away a few minutes later. “Not yet. We’re not in any hurry.”
“And what if she had just wandered off a cliff instead of looking to have a bit of a snog in your honey shed with this old beau of hers?” Zoe leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms.
He ends up having to kneel up to retrieve it and John enjoys the view, the ice cream melting cool and sweet on his tongue. He’s admiring the elegance of Sherlock’s back, the line of his spine, the folded wings of his shoulder blades, the freckles dotting his ribcage, the dimples just above his arse, when he hears a splash.
You could read the worry it wrought in the lines on John’s face. The man must feel very much alone, Sherlock thought, remembering the way John had hung his head in his hands at Sherlock’s kitchen table. The faux sunniness of his profusion of exclamation points, which had seemed out of character, a false front for Charlotte perhaps? Sherlock could easily imagine the girl pestering her father to confirm the date for when she could see the bees again. Or perhaps it was just genuine, exhausted gratitude for the loan of Sherlock’s sugar, which must have felt something like grace on a night when the shops had closed and his daughter, new to school and uprooted from her old life, had dropped the information on him as a nasty, albeit innocent, surprise.
Despite the troubling fact that Sherlock feels connected to him on some deep and unfathomable level, he knows, rationally, that he needs to strengthen it if his plan is going to work. John has spent the morning sequestered in private meetings with Irene Adler that Sherlock, though he had tried, was not allowed to sit in on. Sherlock, frustrated, sought out the day’s schedule instead, and, seeing that John would be sitting in with his financial advising team on a video presentation about Novarsky Inc, the conference room had immediately offered itself to Sherlock’s imagination. Two large conference tables pushed together with a third laid across the ends, meant that if he were to hide beneath them and make it so that John was the only one seated along the far end, the chances of him being discovered were low.
“What are you thinking?” John asks fondly, stroking Sherlock’s cheek and searching his eyes. “What’s going on in that big, beautiful brain?”
The darkness is complete but he can feel the warm feather of Sherlock’s breath on his face as he reaches up.
This time Sherlock goes slow, lets John do the work, just sitting on it as John plunges it in and out.
John chuckles and catches Sherlock’s roaming hands which threaten to slip beneath the collar of John’s rapidly loosening robe. John pins them above his head. Which, unfortunately puts him back in range of those damnable lips.
and I came, shaking. Shaking. Streaking the dusty floor with come, spilling out and over my fingers. Rattled. Rattling. My heart racing too fast. Careening. I stood and staggered to you. I pulled you up and pushed you back until you hit the car door. I knelt at your feet, still trembling all over, still shivering, still full up with you.
Sherlock hesitates and John’s heart leaps a bit, hope surging, but a moment later he shakes his head.
“That’s it,” John says, his nose smashed against Sherlock’s, his fingers wound up tight in his curls. “Fuck me. Fuck me hard Sherlock. Just think how good it’s going to be when you’re inside me. I’m going to be so tight for you. God, I want that. I want you to fuck me so hard that I’ll be walking funny for a week. I want your come to be dripping out of me all day you put it in me so deep. Fuck me, Sherlock, fuck—“
“How are you Molly?” John segues, not wanting to talk about his non-existent girlfriend or the actual reason he looks so pleased, which apparently Sherlock knows all about. The cavalier attitude that John had felt on that first night has dissipated. It makes him angry at Sherlock for no rational reason other than that it’s exhausting not being able to keep any secrets from his flatmate.
John slides down, his lower half slipping off of Sherlock and sinks into the hot water with a splash. He rests his cheek against Sherlock’s belly, hands tucked beneath Sherlock’s ribs. He has a dreamy smile on his face and it makes Sherlock’s chest tight to see the pure and simple happiness of it.
“We’re going to split you into two teams.” John makes a cutting motion with his hand, indicating a line being drawn down the center of the room.
Sherlock gasps as the ice cream hits his skin and then, louder, moans, low and deep, as John leans forward.
Again, Sherlock couldn’t help himself, he laughed. “When you put it that way, it sounds quite revolting doesn’t it?”
His fingers slip behind Sherlock’s bollocks and John can feel it. Can feel the hard base of the plug through the thin material of Sherlock’s pants. It vibrates faintly against John’s fingertips. If he strains, he can just hear it: a deep, purring hum.
Hey y'all- I have a request to make. If you're not enjoying this story, if you wish I were writing it differently, if you wish John was some other way, or Sherlock was, that is your right as a human and a reader. I am writing this story the way I want John and Sherlock to be. I'm writing this story to heal something about masculinity that is harmful to me. I'm writing this story because I need tenderness and consent and trust AND kinky sex.
was putting on, for HIV testing and counselling. Angel, a trans man who was pursuing a degree in nursing, had given him his first drink on the house in thanks for volunteering. John can see why it was such a safe place for Sherlock to land.
John strains upwards, needing him to understand. “Sherlock, I love you. I love you desperately. You must know this. You must see that I belong to you too. I want only your health and happiness, don’t you see? I would do anything to give you that.”
For the second time in less than 24 hours a window shatters nearby. John starts to squeeze the trigger but is thrown off balance, carried forward by Moriarty stumbling backwards, one hand twisted in John’s shirtfront, a red circle blooming in the center of his chest. John would like to savor the look of almost delighted surprise on the man's face, but he hasn't the time. The full weight of Moriarty's body crashes into the window behind him and it gives with a sickening crunch, the pane already fractured by the bullet that had passed through him a second before. John tries to brace himself against the window frame, he feels Sherlock grab at his arm, but his feet slip on the glass and he’s tugged through, Moriarty below him, pulling him into his body as they plummet, the earth rushing up towards them with sickening speed.
His cock hangs heavy between his legs. Thick. Swollen. Throbbing. Dripping. John’s leaving sticky fingerprints all along the inside of his thighs in his haste.
“Sherlock, do you trust me?” John asks, stepping close to him, crowding him back against the elevator wall. Sherlock, eyes skittering over John’s face, trying to read his mood, nods. “Good.” John backs off, pulling his jacket straight as the doors slide open. He steps off, confident that Sherlock is on his heels as he makes his way to his makeshift office inside Irene’s.
The way his hands fell, light and stunned, on top of my head as I took him deeper, his cock hardening against my tongue, was
“I thought you were going to challenge it to a duel!” The prat is laughing now, shaking against John’s back.
You don’t make it through med school and basic training without learning how to rein in your pride and take instruction from your betters. John does as he’s told. Sucking at the tip and letting the saliva run down, slicking up the shaft for his fist.
Sherlock cuts both pieces of toast into three fingerlings each, which John finds incredibly endearing. His mum did that for him when he was a lad. Sherlock offers the plate to him and John takes a slice. They eat together in comfortable silence.
“All right, my love, what do you want?” he asked softly, when his fingers had been slicked. My heart clenched tight when he called me that and I swallowed hard a few times before I could answer him.
Sherlock pulls in his elbows and pushes down the bed until he is lying on his stomach. John pushes up, lifting his weight off of him, before settling down on his side next to him.
They stay like that for how long John doesn’t know, long enough for his breath to slow and his heartbeat to sync to Sherlock’s, pressed chest to chest, close. It’s intimate in that way you can be with strangers sometimes, a specific closeness achieved through pure lack of relational history. Just bodies seeking connection and closeness simply for the sake of them.
“I’m sorry,” I said, slipping my hand behind his neck and pressing my forehead to his. “I’m so sorry.”
He can see Sherlock in the distance, stark on the hillside beneath a white sky. It won’t be easy. They’re not easy men.
John comes, his orgasm cutting through him, sluicing up his spine hot and bright, and shuddering, John watches as he paints Sherlock’s chest in wide white stripes.
“You were quiet tonight,” John remarks when you’re back in your hotel room. He sets the keycard down on the dresser and leans against it, facing you. You sit on the bed, toe off your shoes, and shrug. You reach for him.
You gasp at the scrape of his teeth over your Adam’s apple. He soothes you with the sweep of his tongue.
“This bloke over here.” Zoe hooked a thumb in Sherlock’s direction. “The one who faffs about with the bees.”
“Is this your way of telling me that you want to engage in some pleasure seeking activities?” he asks, tugging the collar further down and skimming his lips across his shoulder in its wake. There’s a scattering of pale freckles flecked across his skin.
Sherlock’s breath tearing fast against John’s cheek as John works straining buttons through their holes. He wants Sherlock’s skin, every alabaster inch of it. He wants to watch it blush, grow red from want and touch. Sherlock’s stomach jumps beneath his hands as John parts Sherlock’s shirt and pushes it off his shoulders. John’s heart pounding in his fingertips as they trace across Sherlock’s bare skin.
And John remembers the shame and humiliation that had come with it. The way he had wanted to separate himself from that John in the mirror.
A book lay beside him, but the day was far too pleasant to read. After the toll the last few days had taken Sherlock was content to merely enjoy the calm. Last night he had prepared roast chicken and potatoes with rosemary and thyme. He had eaten it beneath a pink hibiscus sky at sunset and finished it off with a frosty glass of milk and John’s slightly charred chocolate chip cookies. He had gone in to bed with the last symphony of cricket song through his open windows and woken burrowed beneath his duvet in a delectable cocoon of cozy warmth that he had been loath to leave.
“I’m afraid the only way that my brother knows how to show his love is through trying to control every aspect of my life.”
It was not John’s finest moment, but he found that he had absolutely no control over it. The blood was rushing out. The fist had opened. The limb was waking back up.
“The closer I am to you, the less intense the spark. The further apart, the harder you’ll feel it. I can control the intensity of the electrical flow on the violet wand itself. If you can’t feel it, let me know and I’ll turn it higher. Right now, for indirect contact, I have it set on low. When I’m touching you, we ground out and you won’t feel anything. You liked when I was just barely touching you, yes? Not so much the first one when we were farther apart.”
“Good idea,” Sherlock said, smiling dryly at John who huffed a self-deprecating laugh, as he thumbed through to get to the new contact screen. He looked at John, his finger hovering, and tapped it in as John recited it.
Harry watches him over the rim of her glass as she takes a sip and John does a double take. It looks suspiciously like mulled cider and John, a shock of cold slamming through him, reaches to take it from her.
When Sherlock’s breathing has calmed his body is still achingly tight, all his muscles coiled. John whispers, “What do you think would have happened if Lestrade had walked in on that little scene, hmm? Walked in and saw you bouncing on my cock? Saw you moaning my name? Saw my come dripping down your thighs as I shoved a plug in to hold it so that I could eat it out of you later?”
Sherlock woke suddenly and sat up, sticky tendrils of nightmare clinging to him. His heart pounding, his breath coming short, he blinked at the room, black around him.
John doesn’t wait for Bobbi to fumble out a response. He says goodbye and moves on, checking his mobile for the time. Bobbi’s off-colour question has reminded him that he’ll be training the new guy tonight. He’s been hired on to do the night shift for a short time while their regular night shift employee is on maternity leave. The library is open until 8pm during the week to accommodate classes that they offer, as well as for community members who need access to a computer and/or internet after work and school hours. The new hire, a man named Sherlock, would be arriving around 5pm to learn the routine. John still has an hour and a half to finish up the re-shelving and take his break. Mrs. Patterson and her mobile are thankfully nowhere to be seen, the desk she had been occupying standing empty as he passes.
John lies down on his side, facing Sherlock and finds himself looking into Sherlock’s eyes. There’s light cutting in through the window above John’s bed, a waxing gibbous visible just above the treeline. It lends its ivory glow. Outside frogs and crickets join their calls to one another and raindrops glisten on the glass. The intimacy which had seemed so strange and sudden to John earlier is now merely a comforting presence that John accepts and sinks into. He's done second guessing whatever this is, just wants to enjoy it while it lasts.
He licks his lips again, like he’s thinking of it too, and your heart begins to pound against your ribs. He steps down beside you and turns to face the direction you pointed. You miss the feel of his hand on your body. “Do we need a cab?” he asks, as you take a moment to appreciate the cut of his figure in the clean lines of his uniform. The epaulets on his shoulders, the caduceus flashing on his beret, his boots gleaming, glossy jet in the puddle of lamplight on the pavement as he pivots to face you.
“Just that he deserves our compassion and to be treated with humanity, not tossed out and punished for something that all of you have been through at one point or other.”
John Watson with his crisp, tailored suits and his velvety brown beard and the callouses on his thumbs that make Sherlock shiver and his voice that makes Sherlock heel. John Watson with his damnable drownable dark eyes and his war record and his thin pink lips that he licks and licks and that kiss Sherlock until he’s woozy, his blood fizzing up to bubbles like it is now, in anticipation, in promise, in pleasure. That kiss Sherlock like he wants nothing more than to kiss him, asking nothing more of Sherlock but what he wants, not forcing, just inviting, just enjoying. John Watson with his calm, like the eerie quiet eye of a storm; he is sure of himself like no one Sherlock has ever met.
“You.” Sherlock knows what to say. For all that John is pretending to be different than the others, above them and their base urges, Sherlock knows what a Daddy wants.
When they’d arrived back at the hotel after a leisurely lunch John had bid him take out the plug and soak in the bath while he made some phone calls. Sherlock did as he was told and then, finding John still otherwise engaged, had laid down in bed to wait for him.
“Turn around,” he says, long, kiss-drunk minutes later, and you shiver at the dark husky rasp of his voice, shuffling up the bed to wrap your hands around the headboard. Your skin stings in the raw air, alive with anticipation. You feel him shift at your side, knelt close, silky cock tucked against your hip. You hear the snap of the lube bottle and the way John’s breath is coming fast and hard against your right shoulder blade.
“No.” John will beg. He will do anything it takes. But he can’t. He can’t get enough air. He can’t breathe. Panic is a vice around his chest, squeezing. John sags, lets Sherlock catch some of his weight. “You can’t say that. You can’t. Just give me. A minute. Jesus Christ.”
John doesn't meet Sherlock at his solicitor's as he promised. He goes to the pub instead. He sits with it.
“What’s that you’ve got there?” The blanket rustled as he sat up and tried to peer over my shoulder to see what was in my hand.
The breath huffs out of Sherlock’s mouth and in the mirror his lips curve up. “That too.” Sherlock starts the car.
“You felt so good,” John murmured, flexing his thighs. Tightening and releasing me in a slow lazy rhythm. It made white stars explode behind my eyelids. “I want to make you feel good, Sherlock. Come on then, fuck me.”
He says, “Turn around,” when you don’t answer and then he’s gone, stepped away and back, his hand slipped away from yours, and you spin to catch him, to prevent him from walking away.
Another had felt a little light when Sherlock hefted it, so he had covered the top bars in newspaper and sprinkled dry sugar over the top, spraying it with water to make it clump, and entice the bees to gather it. He’d also left a patty of pollen mixed with honey for them to nibble. He made a note to check on these hives in December. If necessary he would feed sugar syrup then, weather permitting. He didn’t like to open the hives during the winter if he didn’t have to, but on days when the temperature breached 10 degrees Celsius the bees would be active, removing their dead and making trips outside to defecate and clean the hive of debris. Sherlock would be able to minister them then without causing undue harm.
John’s stomach roils. “He’ll be disgusted. He’ll probably throw me out. That’s why it’s better if I do it for him.”
I wanted to kiss him just now, him propped up against my body as I lay on my side, his broad back nestled against my thighs, tucked into the crook of my waist, his legs stretched out in front of him with his feet bare against the cool grass.
“It was a silly pastime that saw me through a long winter and I don’t need it anymore,” I said, digging in my heels.
The blade was gone. Desire swelled through me, languid and lapping, matching the pace of John’s tender coaxing. It swirled and eddied, a rising tide of heat and pleasure.
“No?” Sherlock retorts. “Well, I’ll spend my life trying to prove you wrong and consider it a worthy pursuit.”
You want to turn, you want to feel his breath on your mouth, to taste the whiskey on his tongue, but you hold yourself still, so still, as his thumb worries at the half-slipped button below the heave of your clavicles, and slowly, slowly, pushes it through.
…Sherlock might be an arrogant git, but he had the goods to back it up. If there was room for doubt then Sherlock would be the one to find it.
He leaves a string of red marks up and down Sherlock’s thighs, his skin scraped red with the burn of John’s stubble, and by the time he leaves off Sherlock is hard again and shifting restlessly against the mattress. John’s name a supplication on his tongue.
An interesting one, a really cracking one, and look: your mouth is watering at the mere suggestion of all the data you could collect once he’s naked and under your hands.
His brother shook his head and stood. Sherlock noted the thinning hair swept back from his brother’s high brow, the frown lines carved a bit deeper around his mouth. “I’m afraid I need to be getting back. Another time?”
In response to some comments I'm getting, no this isn't the last chapter. There will be two more. Thank you for your support lovely readers. It's the nicest thing to know you want to see more <3 <3
All the tension rushes out of Sherlock’s body and he slumps. His palms skittering down the glass pane, screeching, then catching, preventing them both from tumbling to the ground.
He breaks from you and runs his mouth down the arc of your throat as you bare yourself to him, tilting your head back into his hand. His fingers thread themselves into your curls and lightly fist.
“Does it please you?” Sherlock asks, unable to read the man yet. It’s off putting to say the least. Usually Sherlock was in possession of people’s darkest secrets at this point. Not so with John.
Lestrade laughs and shakes his head. “There is no way that girl could have done that. She’s a wee wisp of a thing.”
John spanks him then and as Sherlock instinctively tenses around the plug, as it's thrust deep inside of him, Sherlock feels himself start to head towards something inevitable, something that, so far, the cock ring had held at bay, and he says, “Now. John, I need you inside me. Now.”
“What did you have planned?” John asks, ignoring Sherlock’s question. He dips another chip and eats it. His eyes locked with Sherlock’s as he chases a trail of vinegar down the side of his hand with his tongue. He catches it, the silvery bead, just as it reaches his wrist and Sherlock, audibly, inhales.
And just like that Sherlock’s arse is two inches in front of John’s face as Sherlock bends over to fish the soap bar out from beneath the water’s surface.
“You think I haven’t dealt with your type before?” Sherlock says with a sneer. “My last don was the toughest they breed. I know what you want. You want someone to order about. To whip and spank and call a naughty boy. You want me to make you angry, to disobey. You want me to be bad so that you can teach me how to be good.” He spreads his big hands on the desktop and stands, leaning forward, getting into John’s space. His voice is a low frustrated growl. “I’ve been acting out for weeks now and you’ve barely spoken to me. Barely looked at me.” John stills, doesn’t give up any ground. Lets Sherlock get as close as he dares. Lets him pout and whisper, a hair’s breadth away from John’s mouth, “When will you take me over your knee and teach me my manners,
I braced my hands on the edge of the counter top to either side of his butterflied thighs and bent over him.
As Sherlock passes John’s seat John reaches out and touches Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock stops and stares down at it.
John feels a flash of heat burst down his spine and he feels, irrationally, angry. He fists his hand tightly around his cock and the blood pounds in his forehead, throbbing in his ears. That should be his cock driving into Sherlock, making him moan wantonly like that, making him look utterly lost in abandonment, in pleasure.
“I like it when you call me sir,” John says. “Reminds me of being in the military. You’re such a good boy, giving Daddy what he wants, what he didn’t even know to ask for. Such a good, good boy, listening and doing exactly what he asks of you.” John speeds up the motion of his hand, rubbing it this way and that so that Sherlock can’t telegraph what will happen next. A helpless moan escapes him. Anticipation making him round his shoulders. “Good boys deserve to be taken care of. Good boys deserve to be rewarded for their good behaviour.” And with that he lifts his hand and brings it down with a firm, solid smack that rings out in the quiet room. The groan that shakes out of Sherlock is uninhibited and loud and ecstatic. The effect is stunning, roses blooming over his white skin where John’s hand had landed, his skin prickled up to goosebumps all over.
“You’re impossible.” Sherlock throws up his hands, the duvet sliding off his shoulders to puddle around his waist.
Ellen’s face was thoughtful. “So it’s like organic farming, but for bees. Free range, no hormones and all that.”
Sherlock laughs, harsh and loud. “It is naive of you to think that any of us will ever be safe again.”
I tried to imagine it, you in place of Calum. Calum had been terrified. Rough and furtive and ashamed. He kissed like a punch, hard and explosive, sharp teeth and pressure, without finesse or pleasure. It had been hand jobs behind old crumbling sheds and frottage while swimming in the pond. It had been a blowjob in a movie theater and once, a quick, dry, painful fuck bent over my grandfather’s kitchen table with my fist in my mouth and only spit for lube, the night before I was heading back to school.
John shoves the duvet down to the foot of the bed and lies down, punching the pillows with perhaps too much force before settling. Shame and anger are vying for primacy inside his chest.
He had sat at the cliff’s edge sucking salty grease and crackling from his fingers, enjoying the crisp breeze and the sour burst of flavour from the grapes, tart on his tongue. The water had been churned to white caps as the wind picked up and Sherlock had eventually moved inland to escape its buffeting force to lie amongst the scraggly pines. He dozed on the sun dappled bed of brown needles and his thoughts turned once more to the Watsons. A host of tragedy and trauma seemed to have chased them to Sussex. They intrigued him.
“I think it’s important for you to know that I’m in recovery for drug addiction,” Sherlock said. “After the detective I told you about was killed, what had been my recreational cocaine habit, turned into something much more serious.”
His fingers fly to obey, shuddering on the slip clasp before they fumble the button through and the zip down.
John slips his hands beneath the floating edges and touches the creamy softness of his skin, gathers him in.
Looking up at me, he took the lace in both hands and tore it away. My cock sprang out, red and rather desperate looking, and John instantly slid it between his lips.
“Sorry,” Sherlock says, smoothing his warm palms through the oil and spreading it out over John’s shoulders.
You brush the tips lightly, kiss each grooved pad. You nuzzle down into the cup of his palm and rub your open mouth over the heel of his hand. The veins in his wrist stand out against your tongue and taste of your soap. They fork and twist and run blue beneath his skin. You follow their path to the inside of his elbow and suck. He draws his breath in through his teeth in a hiss and his hips twitch up, searching for contact. The wet head of his cock catches against your hip and leaves a sticky impression behind. You settle there, sucking on the soft, thin skin until you can taste only him, until you can feel the bruise begin to form, hot against your tongue. When you pull away there is small red mark. You stroke it with your thumb, admiring it. In school that was the place you practiced French kissing on yourself. You remember how it felt to press your thumb to the hickey you’d made, to feel the ache splinter through you. You think of him, on the airplane tomorrow, with his arms folded, the dull throbbing every time he moves. You’re there with him, he’s carrying you with him, he’ll think of you each time and he’ll know it wasn’t a dream.
The streets of Dartmouth Park are quiet and lined with brick three-storey flats. There’s a light dusting of snow covering everything, a sifting of powdered sugar for John to leave footprints in on the pavement, and Christmas trees glow brightly in the windows at he passes. The air is thin and tastes of frost. It lingers in the back of his throat, ferrous and hoary. Reminds him of licking at snowballs when he was a boy, the way the snow clung to the warmth of his tongue magnetically, and how, for a moment before it melted, John imagined he could feel the individual spindles of each snowflake, like tiny hairs, tickling the roof of his mouth.
You point towards your bedroom door. “First door on the right. The taps are a bit wonky. You need to jiggle the cold up and down a few times before the hot water will run.”
The flat is so quiet that John can hear the muted whoosh of traffic from outside. Christmas lights from the flats across the street twinkle behind the gauzy curtains.
“Already?” John asks, as the ends of two curious tentacles slide up the backs of Sherlock’s thighs, questioning.
John licks the fluttering skin beneath Sherlock’s jaw. Tastes his frantic heartbeat. Blood and salt.
“Let me see,” John whispers, his blood pounding in his fingertips as he reaches for Sherlock’s sharp white hips.
He lay still and watched the colour change subtly as the minutes ticked by until the blue had faded to a pale rosy peach and then finally was subsumed by the clear gossamer light of day, signaling it was time to rise. The pair of gray collared doves nesting in the eaves outside his windows agreed and began to coo to each other softly. It was a sound Sherlock had woken to often over the summer. They would be gone soon, migrating to warmer climes. The thought struck Sherlock as a bit sad. He’d rather grown accustomed to their companionship. Mornings would be quiet without them.
the beads bump and slide their way out of John’s body, one tiny explosion detonating at a time until Sherlock’s other hand closes around the head of John’s cock and strokes up and…
Just then the door on their left swings open and a heavily tattooed man in a fitted white shirt, a pony tail, and a beard, steps through, motioning for them to enter.
His brow clears instantly, to be replaced by the clean cut of those incomparable grey-blue eyes sluicing up to meet John’s. They hold his gaze for a moment, the intensity making John’s skin prickle. It’s a gamble, how Sherlock will react. He could take it as criticism, but John hopes he takes it the way he intended, as a way of getting at the heart of the matter. When Sherlock’s eyes drop, John’s throat grows tight.
Noor shrugged. “I’m not telling you there shouldn’t be consequences, but to levy them while he’s not here and without giving him a chance to speak for himself seems unfair.”
Mary gapes at him a moment before her eyes rolls up into her head and she slumps backwards into the seat, senseless.
“Good luck,” John says, “I’ll see you tomorrow?” Ani nods and slumps off to do her afternoon shift as an archival apprentice. She's just come from the nearby University, where she is pursuing a degree in Archival Studies, from a morning of classes. John pushes the cart down the row in the opposite direction.
“I’m wondering if you’ll tell me a little about yourself?” John said, stretching an arm out across the back of the sofa and pulling his knee up onto the cushion. “I feel a bit like you’ve seen all my dirty laundry and, well, your accent’s too posh to be from around here. Where’d you grow up?”
Sherlock slides to his knees as John lifts his hips to unbutton and unzip, to push and to tug, and then there, there, the air is rushing cool and harshly bright over his burning wet skin, but his hand is warm and sweat-slick and he pushes his fist down around himself, tight, tight, tight. So good and tight, to grip it by the base and cant it out.
“I’d like to give you a little more context, as I feel like you’re the only one in the room without it,” Sherlock said, running the towel around the cup before dipping it inside.
“Those are her pollen baskets. Her whole body, even her eyes, are covered in tiny hairs that the pollen attaches to. She then uses her legs to brush the pollen back and collects it in those baskets.”
They eat in companionable silence for a few minutes. Just the clink of their dueling forks against the rim of the bowl and the rain outside.
John points his finger at him. “You’ll keep your hands to yourself, sir, thank you very much. There is no way you are going to be able to wring another orgasm out of me today. I’ve high hopes for tomorrow, but we’ll just have to wait and see.”
Once he's naked John stands for a moment trying to catch his breath. Flexing his toes against the floor, gripping it. Behind him the fire flushes against the backs of calves and thighs, buttocks and shoulders.
“No, I meant…” You gestured to the pile of rumpled blankets that lay on the ground, blushing prettily.
Sherlock kisses the crown again, slippery, satiny, slick, his tongue flickering out against the underside, teasing at John’s frenulum, at the sensitive ridge of his vein. His hand pumps, working John’s foreskin up and down his shaft as John pulses, dripping precome onto his lips with each pass.
This man who is taking all the parts of Sherlock that have been so viciously vivisected by society and his past relationships and making a chimera out of Sherlock’s femininity and masculinity, making them whole in their distinctness, neither one elided in the need to exaggerate the other, both natural, mutually enhancing aspects that Sherlock had watched emerge on video before his eyes when there was no role left to play but himself.
Sherlock nodded as John moved off. He turned to Evan, unable to keep the hint of irritation from his voice. “What did you need?”
Looking across the table at Sherlock, whose chin is leant into the crook of thumb and forefinger, his pale eyes unfocused as the countryside, now black, rushes by out the window, John can read the brittle, tensile quality of stress running through Sherlock. Their afternoon in bed had been a brief respite from the grim reality they faced. John, used to operating in a war zone, almost relishs the intoxicating thrill of adrenaline pumping through his veins, the eerily focused calm of his mind, the future narrowed to the next few seconds, minutes, hours.
John places his other hand on Sherlock’s chest, cupping his pectorals, thumbs brushing, just teasing at the sensitive edges of Sherlock’s erect nipples. John rocks up onto his toes.
He was next in line, the bottle of wine on the conveyor belt when a word cut through the muddle of his thoughts with stunning precision.
His eyes draw down the groove of Sherlock’s spine. Across the delicate wing of his shoulder blade. John wants to dip his fingers in the midnight shadows that pool in the small of Sherlock’s back. Wants to trace the distance between his freckles. Wants to taste the salt on his skin. He wants to kiss the silvery scars, the ones Sherlock got while he was away and the ones John was there to treat.
I’ve told you this a thousand thousand times and I am sure I will tell you a thousand thousand more, but you are a genius.
Who arches into John’s tongue like it’s redemption. Like it’s salvation. Who cries out like he’s seeing God.
John sets the package on the bottom step of his staircase, his other mail sitting on top, safe as houses.
The glances were surreptitious. A quick Sherlockian scan to measure whether John was thinking of his old life and drawing any comparisons. Whether he was regretting his choice to stand by Sherlock.
Sherlock’s heart pounds in his ears as he listens to his own carnal moans, wanton and loud, still echoing through his earphones.
You stick your scotch-soaked tongue in his mouth, a ship wrecked on the way he opens to you. The way he lets you plaster yourself to him, rubbing your still-hard cock against him, letting you make sounds that embarrass you. Lets you want in this way that you don’t want to want, lets you take in this foreign way you don’t know how to take, lets you ask for things, for
On the back of one of him looking at someone off camera, relaxed, with his hands in his pockets, struck golden by the sun, and the brown mountains in the distance:
“No, Mary. It was not the Lewisham Three who was here tonight,” Sherlock goes on. His voice calm and steady. Soothing. “It wasn’t them who killed Billy and it wasn’t them who drank that wine and it wasn’t them who tied you up.”
I groaned involuntarily. Guilt and lust warring equally inside my confused body with anger and resentment.
I know it's egregious that I'm ending the scene here, but I promise, I PROMISE, you'll get it at some point.
Sherlock mulls this over for a moment. “Lets set a record, and then, next time, we can try and break it.”
“I used a shower cap,” Sherlock says, his eyes on John as John steps up in front of him, their toes just touching. “I washed it this morning and don’t like to wash it twice in one day if I can help it. It otherwise takes on truly massive proportions of frizz.”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, just stands there, appraising John cooly, with a distance that feels like a knife stuck in John’s ribs.
Sherlock pauses, dipping his chin, and letting a drizzle of saliva drop down. John feels it hit off the right side and he pushes his hips up, as Sherlock’s fist slides down, smearing the heat of his mouth down John’s shaft.
“You don’t much like giving up control do you?” he whispers, as you madly nuzzle his ear and jaw. The kettle begins to rumble as you nudge the collar askew to taste the skin of his shoulder. “It’s too much, yeah? When I’m the one touching you?” You don’t say anything. It’s not precise, it’s not exact, but you can see how he might have come to this conclusion from your actions. It’s just on the verge of being right, so you don’t correct him. The rest is redacted anyway, it doesn’t
Outside, the world has gone quiet. Except for the odd siren, the occasional blare of a car horn, the night is hushed. There is only the soft sound of your mouths touching, your hearts, in your ears, thumping.
This man grows more confounding and self-flagellating by the minute. Sherlock grinds his teeth to keep from saying something he will regret. He reminds himself that he needs John to like him and that John did not like it when Sherlock acted out. John wants Sherlock to do what he desires, and Sherlock desires to become necessary to John, wants John to crave him, so…
“I want to fuck you with my tongue.” The words come out soft and hoarse, and, John can’t, John, god help him, snorts.
John had underestimated how overwhelming it would feel to have these words from Sherlock himself. It pours through him, clear and sweet as grace, as if he has been pardoned from some inexplicably terrible fate.
Inside Sherlock went through into the kitchen, tracking mud onto the lino, but not really caring. He set the box down on the counter beside the sink and grabbed the kettle. “Tea?” he asked, filling it from the tap.
Sherlock’s hands unclench a little as he says, resigned, “I suppose I might as well go down and see them. Mycroft is sending a car and may well have me forcibly removed from the premises if I resist.”
“You know I can’t actually reliably ascertain that information without more rigorous testing. Like an echocardiogram, for instance.”
John can feel his erection start to wane and he adjusts himself accordingly. The promise of his impending orgasm grows weaker the further they get from Baker Street.
“Nothing, I just don’t see why you’ve called me all the way down here when it’s clear you don’t actually need me.” It comes out more annoyed than he feels, but he’s shaken and all he wants to do is get as far away from Sherlock as he can.
Did it take two years apart to crack them open? To turn them inside out? Did they have to hit bottom in order to see each other properly? To set aside all the notions of who they were and what they did and what was allowed for them to ask for and start again? Is that what growing up was? To have the sense to put yourself back together in a truer way than before you were broken?
John looked up at Sherlock then, as if startled from his memories. “Sorry.” He pushed himself back in his seat and took up his tea, taking a long drink.
“Oh.” John shudders as the silicone scrapes rough and cold against his skin. “Lube,” he gasps, nodding his head towards the box.
There was a space between us, a chasm I could not cross, even if I wanted desperately to do so. I opened my mouth to speak, but no words would come.
Standing at the far end of the library, near the exit that opens onto the path that leads down to the manse, talking to Claire, the chair of the library’s board of directors.
“Nothing I haven’t already given to Lestrade. All of the addresses where I lived with him have been leased under falsified identities. I told you. M is meticulous. He leaves no trace.”
He nudges his nose down Sherlock’s smooth, freshly shaven cheek and sets his mouth against Sherlock’s ear. “You’ll finish going over the figures that Reina gave you and then you’ll go to your apartment and gather whatever you need. When you have everything head over to my house and wait for me there. I’ll be home by 7.”
Sherlock reaches down, transfixed, and wraps his hand around the base, thumb tucked up against John’s balls, smearing the small pearl of pre-come out. John wants to push, to thrust, but he holds back, letting Sherlock explore him. The textures of his skin, the circumference, the dexterity, the veins. Sherlock pulls him down, head towards the floor, testing, and runs his fist up and down, wrist flexing. Tugging.
Idiot. Idiot. Blasted idiot. Polk obviously knew nothing about beekeeping or how to be a decent human being. Instead of alerting the community to his diseased hives as they had all be trained to do, he’d simply dismembered them, letting bees in his vicinity visit the exposed, infected comb and carry it back to their hives, dooming them in return. What kind of imbecile did it take to achieve such levels of careless destruction? Oliver Polk must be a living, breathing git of previously unseen magnitude. A certified wanker. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fucking fuck fuck.
I lost it then, the fantasy merging with reality, overwhelming me, swamping me, sucking me down. Amelia’s soft brown thighs pressing against my ears as I—
John shifts on his knees. The sensation is almost too much. His body feels sluggish with blood. “Sherlock,” he gasps. Air like jagged rocks scraping up his throat. John drops his head against Sherlock’s belly. “Please.”
You’ll remember the clear water falling down. You’ll remember the cool blue tile all around you. You’ll remember his head tipped back, body wet and glossy and warm against you, lips slick, tongue slick, cock slick: yours.
Sherlock’s hair is still held in John’s hand, his neck arched, his arse bowed, his loud panting breathes filling the room with their ragged sound, the very picture of submission.
He can remember, clearly, the conversation that they had had before John would agree to move back in.
“When I’m at home, sometimes I like to take my time,” he starts. “I touch myself everywhere but my cock and see if I can bring myself off that way. Sometimes I like it hard and quick. I’ll take out my biggest dildo and stick it to the wall and bugger myself silly on it. When I just need to be fucked. Hard.”
The water flushes Sherlock’s skin with heat, suffuses him with a warm languid glow that matches the last vestiges of his orgasm still spilling through him.
Sherlock’s hands move over him. Manic. Restive. Stroking at John’s body as if he wants to touch all of him at once and can’t decide which bit to focus on first. Petting his back, his thighs and hips, just skating over the top of John’s arse to rest for a moment in the small of his back before sliding up again to frame John’s face.Tiny after-shocks of pleasure ricochet down John’s spine as the kiss turns deep.
Moving in and out slowly, John bears down and his finger slips deeper. The ache in his thighs intensifies and he writhes against his bed, a high whine trapped at the back of his throat.
“Sherlock.” His right hand came up and gripped my hair. His heels sliding around to the backs of my thighs, digging in. I nipped him lightly and felt him shudder.
The trio of girls took their desserts upstairs to Hayley’s room to watch a movie and the adults settled in the sitting room with coffee, tea, and pastries.
“Then what did you mean? When you said ‘make me’, what were you referring to? What test do I have to pass?” His hands in fists at his sides, words crisply enunciated, cheeks stained scarlet. He doesn’t like having to ask.
Sherlock is standing on his coffee table, hands on his hips, staring at the wall above his sofa, which is covered in tacked up clues.
“I think we’ve moved past what’s typical, Sherlock. I’m open to broadening the definition, in fact, I’m eager to leave it behind if you’d like. I’d love to hear what you think. What do
The morning after their big fight, after Sherlock had promised John the best orgasm of his life and John had been too hollowed out to even get it up, they had driven to Sussex and, once there, still in the early blue tinged hours of Christmas Day, they had laid down in their bed facing each other.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, dropping his head down to brush a kiss across John’s mouth. “I admit I calculated wrong. I thought you were leaving me for a completely different reason.”
As the plane begins to roll out towards the runway John sips contemplatively at his glass and studies Sherlock over the rim.
He wants it soft and he wants it slow and he wants it sweet, and he chose you, and you, you are only too willing to give it to him.
The lingering taste of Sherlock in his mouth, spearmint, and beneath that, what he had been trying to mask: tar and smoke.
He laughs, giggling again, oh delightful sound, and grips the counter in front of him. “I was going to make you eggs.”
“Yes,” Sherlock hisses, thinking John has changed his mind, thinking John is about to do to Sherlock what he had done to him the night before, straining forward, trying to get at John’s mouth again.
“Indeed.” Sherlock pulled open the door and felt the cold sting of the wind prickle across his cheeks.
Because of course John listened to everything Sherlock said, and everything Sherlock was unable to say, was only able to show him, last night.
“Sherlock, Claire Bromley is a lovely woman,” I began softly, to which you huffed. “And she makes a delicious roast on Sundays and those soaps she makes with your rose oil and honey are truly wonderful, but I’m not in love with her.”
Sherlock didn’t know if it had been all of the memories stirred up about his father, the memories of the pain a father could cause, but hearing John call his daughter by her old name (for the second time in mere minutes), made something inside him snap.
“Smugness doesn’t suit you,” Sherlock says, with an impressive amount of dignity for a man covered in his own come. “I’d stick to doctorly concern if I were you.”
“You taste of peaches,” Sherlock tells John, scrunching up his nose in an adorable way that makes John’s heart fizz. Both of them ignoring how pleased they both are at what Angel said. And at what John had revealed to him. The moment passes them by, touching them both differently. It’s still fragile between them. It’s easier to just joke about the drinks. John tips his head back and parts his lips as Sherlock dips down to take another slow, leisurely taste, sucking a little on John’s tongue in a way that makes John more than a little dizzy. “And pineapple. And rum.”
Sherlock chuckles. His hands stroke up John’s back. “You’re going to be tight John. It’s not going to be easy for me.”
“If we do this, it’s likely you’ll be killed.” John can tell it’s meant to shock him out of whatever well-intentioned fog he’s in, but John only nods.
“Hello, Angel,” Sherlock greets the bartender first, raising his voice to be heard over the music, before turning to face John.
You don’t want to see him pull away. You don’t want his eyes to flick down and away and for him to rub the back of his neck and decide you’re not worth it.
Sherlock doesn’t even try and equivocate. “Superb,” he says, leaning in to steal a kiss from John’s smug, pink, smiling mouth.
He walked slowly back to the car and took out the tools he would need to pry open the tops of the hives. Bees glued their hives together with propolis, a substance made from saliva, wax, and plant resins, to keep out moisture and the cold. He would also need his frame grips to pull out the frames inside the hive body to check the bees’ winter stores of honey, as well as the brood chamber where the queen laid her eggs and where larvae pupated. While he had the hives open he would check for evidence of wax moths, cockroaches or robber bees. Weak hives would need to be combined with a stronger one. Too full hives would need to be split if he thought they might be able to build up enough stores in time. Basically he was looking for any sign that the hive needed help before they closed up for the winter.
Sherlock lies on his side facing the windows and John wraps himself around him, his nose resting at the base of Sherlock’s neck, their hands wound up together in the center of Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock ruts mindlessly, his cock bobbing in the warm shaft of sunlight spilling across the bed. He can see John’s erection curved beneath the sheet, the round reddish tip just peaking out. Sherlock wonders if he should suck him off, but the thought is fleeting. He can’t concentrate enough to work his own cock, let alone give John the attention he deserves in the state he’s in right now. He lets his eyes slip shut again and sinks into the sensate darkness where he is awash in texture and sound and emotion.
Zoe shook her head and barked a sardonic laugh. “Should I commend him for not running off like most men would? For doing the absolute bare minimum and still bollocksing it up?”
It’s soothing. Deductions calming the static fury of your mind at rest, the nicotine smoothing out the wrinkles in your thoughts, making them crisp, crystalline, stark.
Ian arrives then, apologizing for needing the loo, and takes over for John, gesturing the next patron forward. As John begins to walk back towards his cart, he notices that Bobbi has lingered, loitering in his path.
Sherlock, dressed in black trousers and his dark, forest green button down, sits on the examine table, legs swinging, rolling down the right arm sleeve. His eyes flick up to meet John’s briefly before Allison says from the doorway, “Just a routine check, Dr. Watson. Nothing to worry about. Took his vitals and did a blood draw.”
He pressed the pads of his fingers against my cock through the lace and rubbed lightly. I leaned back against the seat, the tablecloth hiding us from public view and I pushed my hips up.
“You’re regaining your footing, remember? What better way than to dictate to me every single thing you want from me?”
“Wher-umph” He starts to ask, but you’re kissing him again aren’t you, so it bumbles against the roof of your mouth as you clutch him and turn him.
“I’m not finished yet,” Sherlock says, but he’s leaning forward all the same. John pushes up onto his elbows to meet him halfway.
“Ambitious,” Sherlock remarks from behind him. “I thought you had to leave for work in ten minutes.”
“I was…” I stopped to catch my breath as John’s fingers slipped inside my trousers. “I was thinking of you seeing me in them,” I said, leaning my head down, over my plate, my elbow braced on the table’s edge. “I was thinking of me bent over and you not being able to control yourself. You ripped them and took me.”
“London,” Sherlock says. Parsing, “Rain. Petrol. Cigarette smoke. Woodsmoke. Asphalt. Some old woman’s moldering Yorkie. The Tube was a nightmare. You walked home.”
“Carrot!” The shout startled Sherlock, who hadn’t heard the girl approaching, and he nearly fell backwards in the mud, saving himself at the last moment with an out-flung hand.
“So you’re actually a proper scientist then?” he asks, and you can hear the smile in his voice even if you can’t see it. You relax, leaning back against the counter.
John leans into the doorway after he’s hung up the tuxes in the bedroom closet. His eyebrows are tugged low over his dark eyes, moving over Sherlock as if in triage. “You know, you don’t have to come with me tonight. You could stay here if you’re not feeling up to it.”
“Is it true that bees talk to each other by dancing?” Charlotte demanded, her brow scrunched seriously over her brown eyes.
“I just stopped by to meet you,” John was saying, his head now hidden behind the open fridge door. Time had leapt again and Sherlock blinked at the cup of tea before him. Alongside it were two paracetamol and a glass of water. Sherlock lifted it to his lips and downed it in one long gulp. “I should have introduced myself before, but life is…it’s…busy right now. I’m sorry it took me so long to come over.”
Sherlock looms over him still and hands something down. John, blinded by the harsh fluorescent light behind him, takes it.
“John, you’re it. You’ve always been it and if you had been paying attention that would have been blatantly clear.”
“Cattulus,” I answered, laying the book down on our tattered patchwork picnic blanket which smelled faintly of camphor and pine to better take in the salient details of his line of inquiry:
Heart in his throat, in his temples, beating like wings against the insides of his wrists and his fingertips, John climbs the stairs.
You pick up his hand from where it rests on the rise and fall of his breath, still warm from the beaten percussion of his heart, and lift it to your lips.
“We can’t,” John says, panting. Jenny gives a small yip beside him, nosing at his thigh and John soothes her, asking her to sit.
After, they shrugged on their jackets, which still held the sharp, charcoal scent of smoke from the night before, and grabbed a pair of shovels from the barn. Then, together, they went out to bury his bees.
“I suppose it might be helpful to know what you know about honey bees,” Sherlock said, casting about a bit for where to begin. So many pertinent facts presented themselves at once, wanting to be shared, he hoped the Watsons might pick one he could begin with.
“Hey,” Sherlock says, dropping down to nose and kiss at John’s cheek. His hands are slick where they touch John’s arms. “Hey, what’s going on? What’re you feeling?”
“Then with permission, sir, I’d like a second chance. To show you.” John shivers at the deep timbre of plaintive suggestion in Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock spreads his legs in answer and is rewarded with what feels like two lapping tongues at his hole.
It ended up that I did have him on the sofa after all. And him clad in nothing but his tortoiseshell frames. It was, in a word, superb.
John holds his hips and makes a hot shocked breathless sound, before shoving the tentacle back inside Sherlock’s mouth.
“Well, they would wouldn’t they?” Sherlock says, moving into the room, sidestepping smoothly around the blood stains on the pale blue carpet. The thick pile sinks beneath his shoes as he squats down and takes out his magnifier to look more closely at the ashtray. John thinks it looks like the one Sherlock nicked from Buckingham Palace ages ago.
John stands up. Toes off his shoes. His fingers, gone numb, make clumsy work of his jumper, his button down, his trousers. The air in his garret room is cold, the late September chill seeping in through cracks in the roof. John gulps it down. Standing half naked in the middle of his room, trembling like a virgin. John strips the rest off, adding his vest and pants and socks to the pile collecting inside his empty laundry basket.
To John’s fingers as he breaks apart the fish, his fingers dripping golden grease, the flesh flaky and white as he takes it between his teeth. The fish is thick and muscular, the batter crisp, the vinegar bright, tart like lemons on his tongue.
John stows the food in the fridge and hangs up his coat, still dripping, on it’s peg. He tosses the Waitrose bag full of his soiled clothes down next to his chair. A sick infant with impeccable aim. His socks squeak on the lino as he walks through the kitchen; they’re soaked through. His trousers, a pair of navy blue scrubs borrowed from work, are in a similar state. It’d been absolutely pissing rain as he walked the last two blocks from the restaurant on Marylebone. The door to the en suite is open, steam thickening the air as John makes his way down the hallway. It’s dark in the flat, aside from the fairy lights on the mantle, twinkling amidst the pine boughs, and the light from the bathroom pools on the floor ahead of him, bright and liquid, shimmering.
“Bit cold,” John says and Sherlock nods, pulling the extra quilt he keeps at the base of his bed up and over John’s legs. That helps too. John feels himself relax a little more into the mattress.
“Well brace yourself.” John glances at his watch. “We’re not even half done here and I mean to make it as hard on you as possible. By the time I’ve got you home I’ll place ten to one odds that you’ll be on the verge of coming in your pants.”
“Hi,” John says, a bit breathless as he rocks against Sherlock’s leg, moaning quietly at the friction as his pants and his trousers rub against his cock, which is continues to fatten up quite demandingly behind his flies.
“All right, love, I want you to touch your stomach next. Yes, just like that. You’re doing beautifully.” Sherlock pushes his fingers down his belly, rubbing the oil into the pale auburn hair that grew down his stomach. “It looks like you need more oil.”
“Before, I could have used you,” Sherlock says, “I would have used you. Like a tool to my advantage. I needed you to want me so that I could exploit you, for money, for protection, as a pawn. You’re rich and powerful and there’s nothing M likes more than those two things. I would have taken you down to catch him. I would have sacrificed everything you had.”
“You’re angry that you’re angry. You like to think that you’re tolerant and accepting, but you’re finding it harder to extend yourself that same courtesy.”
Sherlock considered this for a minute, the knot of grief inside him unchanged. He shrugged and nodded at once. “A little.”
“Close?!” John exclaimed, still laughing as he raised his head to stare at me incredulously. “That is…that is the understatement of the year. Christ, that was madness! Pure madness. You make me reckless.”
“John,” you breathe, feeling suffused with heat and want. His tongue slips into your mouth and you moan at the hint of whiskey still burning on his tongue.
Their teeth bump, a sharp explosion ricocheting down John’s body to burn in his toes, as Sherlock opens his mouth and moans.
“Keep.” Sherlock presses his lips together as his eyes roll up into his head, his lashes fluttering shut. “Keep doing that.”
“Would you like to start in here?” John raises his eyebrows as Sherlock pushes up, half out of his seat to look around the car.
What John Watson wouldn’t give to have Sherlock under his care. Boys like Sherlock were John Watson’s specialty. Him swanning about in his tight trousers and his tighter shirts with his creamy skin and his pristine head of glossy curls and that plump, pink, indolent mouth. His heart on his sleeve, protected only by an acid tongue and an affectation of sociopathy. John would love to lavish attention and praise on him. Give him gifts, take him out, treat him well. Would love to show him the measure of his worth. And God. What John wouldn’t love to take whatever the boy was willing to give. The way that soft, luxe, milk-white skin would pink up under John’s touch. The way those long slim thighs would tremble under the bristles of John’s beard. The way that deep chocolatey voice would moan and beg. The way those satiny curls would spill out across a pillow, a desk, the tan leather of his limousine's seats. The unique labyrinthine way his mind worked. The way his incomparable heart beat beneath it all.
“The whole country’s run amok with it,” Ellen said, shaking her head. Sherlock glanced at Evan to take their reaction. They sipped their tea, staying out of it, but Penny’s hand was in theirs, holding tight.
Sherlock is locked away inside himself from the moment Irene leaves. John cannot break through, though he tries. Both unable to sleep, John has his staff ready the jet. They pack and drive to the airport in the purple and gold edged pre-dawn dark.
This time, when Sherlock reaches between them, John arches into the touch, surging up through the loose fist of Sherlock’s left hand, as he pumps John once, twice, three times.
“That’s mostly right,” Sherlock said, reaching across the table and picking up the small bowl of honey from his home hives. “Pollen is rich in protein, which the baby bees need to grow. House and worker bees will also eat it, although honey is their main source of energy as they get older. Once a bee has matured to the point that it becomes a forager it stops making the enzyme needed to digest pollen and doesn’t consume it any longer.” He spooned a small dollop onto the back of his hand, near the base of his thumb and rested it on the arm rest. There were a few bees foraging amongst the blooming ivy that clung to the walls of the house behind them. The honey might entice one or more of them to come down and meet Charlotte.
They’re a sticky, happy duo when Sherlock rolls off of him to lie beside him, both of them smiling. John passes him a few tissues and they clean up. Jenny is sitting up beside the bed, ears perked, alert when John sits up to pull the duvet back onto the bed from where it had slithered off the far corner and onto the ground. John runs his hand over her head, rubbing behind her ears and then gives her the command to go back to her bed, which she does, tongue lolling. John settles the duvet over him and Sherlock and switches off the light.
“Bee bread is a mixture of pollen and saliva and nectar and honey. When the forager bee lands on a flower it collects the pollen and brushes it off the hairs on its body to store in two baskets on its hind legs. It then carries the pollen back to the hive where it stores it inside chambers close to the nursery where the baby bees are developing. Nursery bees mix it with honey and feed it to the babies.”
As an indigo twilight begins to subsume the valley they pick their way back down the darkening path to the gondola. There is a small crowd waiting to board, hikers exhausted and wanting to reach the bottom before nightfall. Adrenaline surges through John as they join the line, now surrounded by strangers. Unable to keep tabs on them all, John steers Sherlock to the back of the line, putting a little distance between them and the knot of people.
Sherlock picks up the bowl and sets it down on the chair to his right. Does the same to their wine glasses. Leans in, across John’s lap. Hands bracketing John’s hips.
