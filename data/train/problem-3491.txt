Castiel nodded immediately when the other man looked at him for reassurance and prided himself on the fact that he only hesitated a little when Charlie pulled him away from Dean and back into the rec room.
"Alright, shut it. I'm just as happy to be getting away from you guys for a month as you are to be getting away from me, so stow your celebrating til I'm done. Second announcement, this one from the bigwigs up on the school board, I'm sure most of you have seen the petition circulating around about school dances, well the administration wanted me to make it clear that they have never denied same sex couples entrance to a dance like Lawrence Free State did during their homecoming. They want everyone to enjoy school activities, but the dance is off campus at The Oread Hotel and the school will not be providing additional security to keep anyone who might want to protest the dance out. So for everyone, just take that in account before you buy tickets, if you think you won't be comfortable then the administration suggests that you don't go."
"Say it again." Castiel groaned underneath him, rutting his boxer clad erection against Dean's thigh unabashedly as the man above him gently bit his collar bone and then kissed away the sting.
"You're a little smart ass, you know that?" Rufus asked, narrowing his eyes suspiciously as Castiel gave his glasses a perfunctory cleaning with the hem of his t-shirt. "Probably why Winchester likes you so much. Y'know this is my second go 'round with him and never, I mean never have I-"
"Do you ever think that there has to be something else out there?" Castiel asked, it was barely a whisper, but Dean heard the misery in his friend's voice and looked over at him.
"I don't want to talk about it," Castiel said moving quickly off of the bed and snatching up the green Henley that Dean had been wearing the evening before, pulling it over his head with stiff, jerky movements and grabbing his jeans off of the floor. "Can you just take me home, Dean? I'm ready to go home."
Gabriel had been hinting that he needed to start getting his thoughts together for the deposition, but every time he tried to think about it he would feel like his skin was being peeled off and he would just end up in the shower, crying until the hot water ran out and his arms ached from scrubbing away at the filth that wouldn't come off.
"Charlie I can't just kiss him," Cas blurted in a panicked rush. "I don't...I can't...what if I do it wrong and it messes everything up?"
"Whatever that is," Dean said, smiling when the other man wrapped their legs tighter together and pulled the blankets back over them. "Guess I'll just have to work a little harder to figure out what yours are."
“Yea, the staff and the patients. There’s some art therapy stuff and every now and then we put a ping-pong tournament together, music therapy is every other week so next week for that and on the weekends we don’t have that we do a movie night. I think they’re watching Caddyshack or something else with Bill Murray tonight.”
"Dick Clark used to host this, every year for like my whole life. Before that he did this show called American Bandstand and a bunch of different game shows. I watch the
"Hmmm," the therapist mused, setting her pen down carefully beside on her desk before she leaned back in her seat with a creak. "You're brothers and sister sound very accomplished, after speaking with your father this morning I'm inclined to think that the entire Shurley clan is just talented beyond all reason. A father who writes, a mother who paints, children who excel in whatever they put their minds to. Tell me, do you have a dog who juggles, Castiel? Because at this point not much would surprise me."
"That's ridiculous. Dean is always having to pry girls off of himself. He was probably just saying that because he knew that you would tell me whatever he said."
It was almost as if his boyfriend could tell how much that folder of papers had frightened him, because Cas kept muttering soothing things in his ear and stroking his hair and shushing the broken, dry-eyed sobs that were wracking through him when the other boy tried to pull too far away from him. Dean hadn't known why he was freaking out so badly, Cas promised him that he wouldn't do it again, but still his emotions were flying between fury at his boyfriend's father and brother who had hurt him so badly and fear the other boy would try to do it again.
And then he didn't sleep because he was too afraid to take his eyes off of it because somewhere in his brain he felt like if he lost this letter then he had he would truly lose Dean. Dean had to come back for something, if not for him, for them, then for the letter. He was sure of it.
"Well, unless he went to the neighbor's house to get it," Gabe said sarcastically, deciding that Sam's lap looked like the very best place to sit in the whole living room and clambering onto the broad expanse of the other man's knees and thighs. "The closest restaurant is like ten fucking miles and I doubt he walked there."
“Cas, I know that the last person who kissed you also killed you, but do you trust me?” Dean asks lowly, his eyes flicking to the other man’s lips and back up to take in the fallen angels’ barely there nod with a smirk.
"I know what you have to do, brother." Raphael murmured lowly, straightening up briskly when the bailiff put a hand on his shoulder. "I bear you know ill will, I deserve this."
"Very well," the judge muttered, gesturing towards the jury. "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury you are dismissed to deliberate and court is in recess until such time as a verdict is ready to be announced.'
With that Ash made to leave the class and Castiel hesitated slightly before following him, Jo trailed behind them still studying the boy's schedule. She noticed that he would have at least one of the three of them or Garth in every one of his classes and did a silent fist pump into the air that caused Dean to raise an eyebrow at her curiously. She just smiled at him, watching Castiel trudge along in front of them with Ash like he was walking to his execution. She hoped maybe he was just nervous, but if he was then he was still doing a pretty good job of hiding it.
But that didn’t stop him from carefully scanning the scribbled names and dates written on the various locks connected to the bridges smaller suspension cables. The key in his left hand pressed sharply into his palm, it’s twin having been stolen by a mischievous, green-eyed enigma of a man five years ago just as the sun had crested over the curve of the horizon.
"I don't really want to talk about it," Castiel sighed, scrubbing a hand through his hair which felt greasy and sweaty even though he and Dean had just showe—"Just…it was all my fault and he's….mad. At me, I haven't talked to him since yesterday afternoon and I'm worried. I'm worried that he's going to do something stupid."
“Jo wants you to tell Adam how pretty and smart she is so she can make out with him.” Ash supplied from the end of the table.
"I want to go shopping with you because we are friends, honey. And when you come over for movie night on Wednesday, Garth's mom will make you a root beer float because that's what she does for her son's friends. Dean will do every oil change your car will ever need forever because it's the only thing he knows how to do for his friends. Ash probably already has you down as medic or something for his stupid apocalypse contingency plan because he is your friend, get it?"
“Got your bags?” The two younger Novaks grumbled in assent and Anna lifted her brown leather satchel in a frustrated way.
But his dad wasn't listening or if he was then he was putting on a very good show of acting like he wasn't so Dean decided to save his voice for when he finally got the opportunity to use it to call for help. And now that they were stopping somewhere that he could maybe do just that, Dean tried very hard to not show how anxious he was to finally get out of the car for anything more than a piss and a stretch on the side of a road somewhere.
He walked ahead of the other man into the dimly lit room and flinched when the door shut loudly behind them. When Castiel turned around to look at Dean he was struck again by how beautiful the other man was, even when he was angry and standing all closed off with his arms crossed over his chest and a thunderous expression on his face.
“So whaddaya say? Practice?” Dean asked, wiping his sweaty hands on his Star Wars bedspread and hoping that his best friend didn’t notice how hopeful he sounded.
The smaller boy tried to control his gasps so that the other boy wouldn't hear him being upset and decide that Castiel wasn't worth all of this trouble. The knob rattled and another more urgent knock followed as Cas collapsed to his knees, still clutching the sink and fighting away the memories of his torn nails scrabbling at the lock on the basement door when his father was out of the house and he thought he had a chance to escape.
Anna’s step faltered for a moment at the door of the building before her shoulders set with a new serenity. She tilted her chin up proudly, her eyes dancing with amusement. “The Novaks will be the hottest motherfuckers at this school.” Her voice dropped to a whisper as she cursed and she looked around self-consciously for a moment.
Castiel stared at the clipboard in his hand like it was a foreign object, clearing his throat and adjusting his bag on his shoulder again.
He saw Dean reach out, almost as if to stop him before he gave Cas an apologetic look and nodded slightly. The other boy's father didn't look away from his son and his eyes were blurry and unfocused and filled with misplaced hatred.
It was Cas's pillow and he didn't want it smelling like fucking girly ass gardenias or something from Meg touching it. Yes, it was technically her pillow and she could have it back eventually, but for now he wanted to pretend like his boyfriend hadn't left at the asscrack of dawn with whispered promises that he would see him as soon as he could. Dean was getting really tired of not having definitive times that he could see Castiel, if he was a movie star or famous or something then this wouldn't be a problem anymore. Then they could just be together and no one would care because it wouldn't seem like his actor was dating down with some out of work mechanic turned bartender.
, but he was too caught up in frowning at his cell phone and scrolling back and forth between his last outgoing call (the one he had made himself to the guidance counselor's office at school) and his most recent incoming call (Bobby all of an twenty six minutes ago). He was looking at the white spaces on his screen for the millions of missed calls of from Cas that seemed to have just magically disappeared.
So it had been surprising to him when Chris had stopped after that first kiss, blushing like a schoolboy despite the graying hair at his temples and murmuring an apology against Alfie's lips before he reluctantly pulled away to get them both glasses of iced tea. The younger man had managed to compose himself long enough to spend another hour in the teacher's company without wantonly throwing himself at the lanky, soft-spoken older man even though really it was all he had wanted to do since the first time he had seen Chris throw his head back and laugh, like full body laugh at one of his corny jokes.
He politely excused his way through the crowd, keeping Dean in his eyeline as he shuffled through the crush of college students and townies who worked in or around the university. The other boy had stopped to talk to Jo, leaning down so that she could wrap an arm around his neck and speak directly into his ear. His boyfriend was smiling and shrugging, probably blushing too but the weird lighting of the club was making Dean looked washed out, but Castiel could tell by the goofy grin that the other boy had that they were either talking about how the test went today, Sam, or him.
Their mouths fit perfectly together and Dean sighed into the kiss. It was exactly how he had thought it would be with the other man; hot and innocent at the same time and it made liquid heat pool in his stomach. If just one kiss did this to him, then he couldn't imagine what else Castiel could do to him if say, he wasn't wearing any clothes.
The water was near scalding, just how he liked it, and felt like a soothing compress for the bruises that were on his elbows from hitting the floor in Dean's bathroom. Cas tried not to think of how when he had left Dean's apartment John had just hit his son across the face or of the purpling marks that so often peppered his boyfriend's skin in places that wouldn't be seen unless the other boy undressed. John knew how to hide the bruises, but there was no way that Dean wouldn't be sporting some sort of shiner at school on Monday. Castiel hoped the obvious injuries would finally be enough that the school might step in and get the people who might be able to help his boyfriend involved. Sheriff Mills had been nice at the dance, Cas couldn't imagine her not doing something to help Dean when he so obviously needed it.
Dean looked over at Castiel and shrugged, grabbing his jacket and sliding it on. He waved at Garth and popped into say goodnight to his friend's mom on their way out of the house, the smaller boy following along silently behind him looking lost in thought.
He went around the apartment gathering a pretty sizeable pile of Cas's things and for the first time he realized how comfortable he had gotten with the other boy so quickly. They hadn't even been dating a month yet, but it felt like they had always been together because that's how right being with the Cas felt. Dean still couldn't believe that he had managed to screw up something so great so fast. This had to be a new record even for him and god, Jo was going to fucking murder him when she got back from Kansas City.
"I'm in a mental ward," Castiel blurted, his father may think he knew, but he didn't know. The writer couldn't possibly know how dreamlike this was for him or how just the two days he had already spent cut off from his real life felt more real to him than a lot of other things had in a long long time. "In Brooklyn. Long Island College Hospital, my doc—um...therapist is named Missouri Moseley. She needs more information about my medical history, more than I knew so she wanted me to ask so that she could treat me better."
So they had been talking about him, probably laughing about something stupid he did last night when he was drunk and god, didn't that thought just hurt Dean more than it should. He was always doing and saying dumb things at parties, why should it make any difference that Cas was laughing about it with some girl he had known for less than twenty four hours.
The larger man pushed the food on his tray away from himself and settled back in his chair. Cas watched Dean push the sleeves of his cardigan up before pulling them back down again; rolling the soft hem of the material between his thumb and index finger before pushing it back up again with an irritated shake of his head. Dean was still upset and honestly, Cas couldn't blame him. If his dad or his mom had said something like that their life would be better if he were dead, well nothing would have stopped him from jumping off that bridge when he had had the chance.
"Do you want to go or not?" Castiel asked adjusting his messenger bag on his shoulder once they were off and moving towards where Gabriel was waiting for him in the convertible at the front of the parking lot.
"Is that what you're saying?" Dean asked, feeling the warmth that he always associated with the other boy blossom in his chest because it had been a rough fucking week not talking to him and being mad about stuff that Cas had said that was completely fucking true.
“That’s because it’s all an act,” Lexi said, feeling a little hysterical because everything that she had said and did since meeting Benny really really had not been part of the usual rigmarole that she put on for her other clients. “You paid Eve for a service and I provide that service.”
"Whatever," Sam said, running a hand through his shaggy brown hair. "Can we talk now? It's kinda important."
Dean made sure to remove them carefully so that he wouldn't mess up the feathers that he had been staring at all night. He just couldn't help imagining that they were real and he could almost picture in his mind how they would join to Castiel's back, moving with the sinewy muscles and spreading out to mirror the boy's moods, wrapping around him when he was anxious or flaring out behind him when he was standing up to those football players in the locker room all that time ago.
"You don't have to do that, Cas. Baby, doesn't play CDs so I could only listen to it at home and I spend more time in my car or at Bobby's garage, he just has a tape player in the shop."
"What?" Dean blurted beside him looking up sharply at Castiel and shaking his head. "Sam told me that Gabe was coming with us to Bobby's; do you not want to spend Thanksgiving together?"
John sighed and ran a tired hand over his face as his older son raced up the stairs to his bedroom, yelling about how all the stupid fish and all the stupid deer were ruining his life. Yea, Parent Day hadn’t really gone over very well at Dean’s last school; turns out most third graders just wanted to hear the firefighter moms and dads talk about rescuing people from burning buildings and not about how the President had commissioned him and his team to monitor toxicity levels in America’s surface waters.
“Alright my dah-lings,” Gabby said, ignoring the fact that Holly was basically tripping into her shoes and that Tasha was still flipping a wig onto her head while Eva continued to fondle her own breast forms. “Now that you’re all ready for battle I have a special guest who has a little bit more experience with drilling things then I do. Please welcome Marine Corps Sergeant Benoit “The Bear” Lafitte.”
"Should I be worried?" Cas called after her, turning to follow her fast-paced stride down the hallway as Charlie rushed past the rec room and showers, skidding around the corner and out of his sight. "Charlie!"
"Oxygen, Cas." Dean gasped, ducking his head and breaking his lips away from the angel's who didn't have to breathe. "I need it, I need it to live."
Guys! Look I did another thing! I'm surprising even myself. Some days I can just spit out 7K words and then others its like pulling teeth to write more than 1K. Obviously, that has been my problem with this fic, but thank you for being so patient and understanding and awesome and I love you. *scampers off to write chapters for other fics while inspired*
Or at least that was what he told himself in the shower and when he was changing clothes, trying to act like he didn't care about wearing the horrible, ill-fitting clothes that Gabriel had brought for him because he wasn't trying to impress anyone. He wasn't worried about impressing Dean because Dean was his friend and Cas was straight and he didn't fucking care what the other man thought he looked like, alright!?
Castiel smiled as he read through the messages and settled on his back, arms above his head as he typed out a reply.
Patrick shook his head disgustedly at the reporters as Cas went to sit back down and Juno returned, fluffing up her blonde hair and giving the two men a confused look.
But still here he was, in a church. A confessional booth. Waiting for the little window between himself and the priest or rector or whatever to open up so he could word vomit his “sins” all over the place.
“That’s weird that they let you be roommates with a girl.” Castiel said, shoving his hands into the pockets of his pants because they were sweating and he thought it would gross Dean out if he wiped them on his thighs like he usually did when they got that way.
something to off himself with the first sharp object he got his hands on, but then another part of of him thought of bolts; ones that were harmless until their sharp edges were used to slice open freckled skin in ways that would do the most possible damage. So he kept his mouth shut and tried to mask the awkward silence between he and the nurse by humming as he shaved, doing it as quickly as he possibly could without nicking himself.
When he returned he was stunned to find that Castiel was already snuggled under the blankets facing the wall, his clothing scattered around on the floor like he just didn't have the energy to deal with being neat like he usually was. Dean tossed another blanket onto the foot of the bed and striped down to his own boxers before turning off the light, sliding under the covers, and spooning up behind Cas.
because Cas hadn't mentioned him by name or anything. But they would know that he was taken and that was enough to settle the primal part of Dean that had wanted to mark up the other man with hickeys and stubble burn since the first day he had met him.
Dean had learned early on in life that birthdays weren't anything special, at least not for him. They were just another day that his mom and dad got into a fight or, after his mom left, dealing with the aftermaths of John's drinking binges. He spent his birthdays doing laundry or grocery shopping or working or cleaning up Sam's scraped knees from falling off of his bike. Dean had learned to stop expecting people to treat the anniversary of his birth like it was something that mattered or had changed the world at all.
Garth couldn't decide how he felt about the guy. He was a little rude, maybe. Garth always tried to not assume the worst in people; his mother had raised him to be a 'glass half full' kind of guy. Maybe Castiel just didn't like Jo, but everyone liked her so that couldn't possibly be it. Maybe he was an alien. Garth had read about some aliens in the National Inquirer who came to earth to engage specific test subjects, but didn't see the point in expending the energy they used to power their cloaking devices in plying pleasantries on people they were not trying to probe. But then the thought struck him that if the dude were an alien that mean that Garth was a potential probee since he had wasted energy being civil to him. The thought made him shudder,
"Which is?" the actor asked cautiously, knowing the answer because from the outside looking in he knew exactly how the public would interpret seeing how Meg and Charlie were with each other in those pictures followed hot on the heels of them breaking up.
"Oh," he replied dumbly, climbing awkwardly to his feet and heading up towards the witness stand. He had to remember not to touch his hair, Anna had been practically gluing it to his head and Cas had promised her he wouldn't mess it up.
"Well, I didn't have a lot of options last year," Dean murmured, glancing over at Castiel who was still frowning, but his eyes had dropped to the couch cushions separating them and the angel didn't appear to be listening to him anymore. "Kind of in the same situation again this year."
And then the door in front of him opened and all of his fears were confirmed. Because there was the same man who he had seen in those blackmailing pictures with his client all those months ago, leather jacket draped loosely over his arm and keys jangling in his hand when he stopped short when confronted with Crowley's motionless form. The part of him that was friends with Castiel Krushnic could admit that he was just the other man's type, handsome and rugged looking with features that were surprisingly delicate for a man, but the part that was James Collins' take-no-prisoners agent only saw the other half of the pair that was out to drive him mad.
"Yea," Dean agreed, making a move to take the bag away from the older man because Bobby was his guest and his mom had managed to teach him more than a few manners before the fire, but the older man tugged it out of Dean's loose grasp and strode towards the exit with an affronted look on his face.
Castiel hadn't been to a mass since before leaving Lake Forrest, all of the pomp and circumstance just served to make him feel more out of place and unwanted, and he hadn't confessed anything more than venial sins even then because like had told Dean after their first kiss, he had always known that he was attracted to other men, the graphic dreams of Elvis in his early teenage years only solidifying the fact that he was going to the part of hell reserved for homosexuals and sodomites.
"Well, then I guess someone will just have to teach you how to use it." She said glancing up from his tie before she pressed a hand to her temple and her cheeks pinkened. "Can you just go talk to them? I'm already starting to get a headache. Hell, take the helium away if they can't handle being around it."
Cas tried to focus his attention on the other man or at least as much attention as he could muster while it felt like his head was detached from his body, wanting to take the harsh edge out of the other man's ragged breathing because Dean was so sexy and wonderful and he wanted to take care of him however he could. He lifted his hand from Dean's shoulder to pet his soft, spiked hair; struggling to make the rest of his body move as Dean pulled back from him, panting mouth open slightly and green eyes dark with desire. He finally noticed that the other man's grip on his thigh was tight and clinging while the muscles of his opposite arm bunched and contracted as his arm worked up and down in a motion that was familiar even though Cas couldn't see exactly what the other man was doing.
"Go fucking where, Crowley?" Charlie snapped, obviously annoyed with having been interrupted by the disinterested foreigner when she and Castiel were talking.
"I think we'll be fine," Cas replied, grasping on to the thin sliver of hope that the other woman had given him and holding onto it with as much strength as his overwrought mind could manage.
"Jeez, Anna." Castiel muttered, wincing away from the paint splotch when a piece of it stabbed him hard under his nail bed, making it well up red with blood. "I'm not a girl, I don't know. Straight?"
Dean nodded dumbly, he could understand family obligation. He swallowed hard. "Are you coming back?"
"You're always good, Dean," Castiel groaned, only half-frustrated by the fact that the other man still didn't believe him no matter how many times he said it. He could feel Dean shoulders shrugging under his hands that had moved up to run over the other man's chest and underneath the cardigan so that he could feel those perfect muscles that he would much rather be writing arias and ballads about instead of doing homework. "C'mere, I'll show you. Let me show you."
"Holy shit, I never thought I would live to see the day when Dean Winchester was ready to settle down."
"I promise nothing!" Gabriel declared loudly, using the larger man's weight against him in order to toss him down on the couch so that he could climb on top of Sam and take in the sight of the chiseled boy's brown eyes that were hazy with desire and it made his breath catch in his chest as he thanked whoever it was out there that had made the younger boy dumb enough to want to be with Gabriel when he could probably have anyone in the world.
Dean had held him afterwards, told him he loved him and that he was beautiful over and over; the sentiments punctuated with soft kisses pressed into his hair and against his temples. That's when Cas wanted the bartender to be tender with him after he wanted him to be rough and not a second before. It helped that Dean was the same way, but that didn't stop the actor from muttering endearments and encouragement throughout their lovemaking just because he couldn't stop the filter that was between his mouth and his heart from going offline anytime Dean made him see stars and wish he had a normal job.
"Um…San Francisco," Castiel supplied because it was the only thing he could think of, in fact it had been practically the only thing on his mind since finding out where Roche had chosen to shoot the movie. That and Dean and whether or not the other man would want anything to do with him if Cas showed up at his apartment or work. "My agent has rented me a house on the beach to live in while shooting the movie for the next couple of months. I'm going up next week to get settled in. You two should visit, one weekend, it would be nice to have some company in that big empty place. I don't know why Crow thinks I need a six bedroom house for just me, the place is massive."
There’d been a lot of reactions from his family and friends when he told them he was applying for the show.
So he caved and took a quick shower, hoping that the sound of the water with its surprisingly decent water pressure hitting the dingy tile at his feet was loud enough to drown out the sobs that were wracking through him as he thought of Cas and his dad and how disgusted he was with himself for betraying the trust of the one person he had sworn never to hurt. It felt like the water would never be hot enough to blister off all of the hatred he was feeling for himself right then. And he deserved the pain anyway, even though he could barely feel it and certainly couldn't find any relief in the scalding water pouring down on his sore muscles.
"Really?" Alfie replied excitedly, glancing back at him and perking up in the front seat. "Wait until my mom hears about this, meeting James Collins my first week in L.A."
“I knew you were a faggot, Winchester,” The boy in front of him sneered, his eyes flickering to the boy behind him and then up and down in disgust. “Whatever, you won’t be around to protect this freak all the time. We’ll get him eventually.”
Dean headed down the stairs towards the kitchen, being careful to skip the second stair from the bottom that he knew would creak insanely loud enough that Bobby always woke up when he heard it. Luckily he had practically grown up in the creaky old house so he knew all of its quirks and which floorboards would give him away as he stealthily moved around the kitchen gathering ingredients for pancakes and bacon, starting a pot of coffee because if he needed some caffeine then Bobby sure as hell would be demanding the beverage as soon as he appeared.
Cas stumbled out of the back door and fell down the stairs that led from the porch to the yard. He landed on his face, palms stinging as he caught himself from busting his lip open, clutching at the ground until he could feel the grass ripping up under his fingers and letting out shaky sobs that were so painfully familiar. He was so tired of letting himself be fooled into thinking that other people cared about him.
Anyway, forgive my tiny quarter life writing crisis, but let me know if you're getting bored I will toss all that angst right back in there! Don't think its disappeared.
"What does that mean?" Charlie asked, opening the door on her side of the car and snatching the phone out of Castiel's hand, thumbing off the speaker option and holding it up to her ear. "Y'know what? Nevermind, we're on our way in right now and you can tell us in person. You're running up my minutes here boss...yea, whatever I know you pay my phone bill, I'm just looking out for the bottom line. We're coming in the back door right now...stop laughing. I hate you."
"It wasn't you, not really." Castiel said softly. "I'm not ready to talk about it yet and this is a great present. Just being here with you."
"Party pooper," Dean muttered, glancing down at Castiel's mouth one last time before moving back down towards the bathroom and shutting himself inside.
"I'll proof-read your paper," Dean murmured against his neck, shifting until he was kneeling on his knees on the couch cushions next to Castiel; cupping his face with one hand and urging until Cas turned his head so Dean could start planting soft kisses over his jaw and up to his mouth. "I'll even make you some tea while you finish it and I promise not to touch you until you're done with your homework, just give me
"I'm not trying to fool anyone," he argued, tugging down his shirt as he willed the other man to just leave already because this wasn't a conversation he was entirely sure he was ready to handle just yet. Plus he felt like he should be discussing it with Dean or someone in his family, not a stranger that he had ended up in a room with because of chance. All he had wanted to do was jerk off, not have some life-altering revelatory discussion about his sexuality, not yet at least.
?” Lexi asked, sitting forward to put her hand out onto Benny’s forearm. She didn’t even mean to do it and after mentally chastising the appendage for a moment, the woman soldiered on. “Christ, Benny how much money did you drop tonight just so you could rub my feet?”
"You did what!?" Dean coughed out around the bite of burger that was currently lodged in his throat.
"No, it's fine." Cas breathed, biting his swollen lip with a wince and pulling back to lean on the other wall of the stall across from Dean; ignoring the insistent erection tenting the front of his shorts.
He stayed with his back towards Dean and allowed the larger boy to pull him back until he could bend his knees around the other boy's and he felt a warm, solid chest pressed up against his back. Dean's arm curled up towards his chest and Castiel could feel his friend's breath against the back of his neck and he thought that if they stayed like this he would be happy forever. He felt like he could take on the world right now.
That would be easier wouldn't it? Except he didn't want to stay away from Dean, he would if he was asked, but god it would probably kill him inside just a little bit. It had been a long time since he had felt like there was anything left alive about himself that could be killed; needless to say the thought of that life being all in Dean's hands was freaking him the fuck out.
By midnight Dean was nursing his second glass of soda and Jess had completely given up all pretense of waiting on the few customers scattered around the bar on a weekday night, she was now sitting next to Sam in the booth loudly discussing Faulkner. Charlie was making dreamy faces at Meg who had stepped behind the bar to give Anna a break and Dean was deleting what felt like the millionth message to Cas that he had typed out that night.
"And would he like me, Dean? Would he think that I'm good enough for his son or would he be worried that I'm keeping you from having a normal relationship because I'm a fucking shirtlifting homo? Your dad is never sober and I don't want you getting hurt because you feel like you have to protect everyone all of the time! Sam knows how your dad is; he can take care of himself."
Castiel cast a searching glance over the other boy's shoulder and Dean turned to see Sam standing at the open door of the Impala, shielding his eyes with one hand to make out who his brother had stopped so suddenly for. A small smile played on Cas's face as he slid his eyes back to Dean, "And you just decided to stop at a park on your way to work?"
“Castiel,” Adam replied pinching the bridge of his nose. “The people that we admit here are very, very sick and I don’t thi—"
How much longer could he kid himself? Was it even healthy to continue to hope that he and Lisa would get back together? She was fucking married at this point, to Benny of all people! Benny was a good dude, the best dude. And Dean was scum for selfishly wanting them to split up.
They stumbled up the four flights of stairs to his apartment, stopping every so often to pull each other into another breathless, bruising kiss that served no other purpose besides making the tense, unexplainable coil of attraction between the two of them wind tighter and tighter. And Dean didn't know how it happened, but he certainly was not going to complain about it when Castiel pressed him hard against his front door once they finally, finally make it into the small apartment.
"Andy!" Jo said excitedly turning to Castiel. "We were like eight, maybe nine and Dean's mom took us to the pool, I caught Dean giving him a kiss on the cheek under the diving board at the deep end. Man, it was so freaking cute, but of course back then I made fun of them both and put them in cootie quarantine."
"Of course darling, I'm not touched, y'know." Juno quipped waving her fork around abstractedly. "You Americans with all of your hang-ups about sexuality. Do your parents know about your closet drama?"
They were all running from something and that's how they had ended up here, in Eden. What a stupid fucking name for something that seemed more like hell most nights. But Wednesdays were always slow for her, mostly because it was the night that all of the LGBT crowd came out and so Eve always sent her home with a disgusted dismissive wave, focusing on how the boys looked and giving her a reprieve since Abbie was much more open to that kind of thing with another woman than she was.
"Charlie," Dean said drily, letting his head clunk back hard on the headboard so that maybe the pain would wake him up from how surreal his life had become. "So what is Charlie going to pretend to be my girlfriend and we'll just go on double dates with our fake girlfriends together so that we can see each other?"
'Lawrence High School Student Handbook' Castiel skimmed the title with a sigh, flipping to the table of contents and reading it disinterestedly, his fingers itching to put at least one ear bud back in to combat the nausea that welled up unexpectedly. He focused on his breathing instead.
"Good," She said smiling wider and toeing his boots towards him. "Because I would've picked the dad who had a beach in his backyard and a foxy redheaded assistant for me to gawk at."
The nurse's voice snapped him out of his Dean-induced stupor, made him realize that he and Dean were just staring at each other over their corner of the table; foreheads so close they were almost pressed together and hands closest to each other tangled together underneath the table. Around them the rest of their tablemates had gone about their conversations, either tactfully ignoring or not caring about the intimate way that Dan and Castiel had arranged themselves.
"Yea about that," Sam cut in, stopping the older man before he had to listen to his brother and Meg reminiscing about how much his costume had sucked compared to their own, again. "Brady's pretty...um hurt? About Meg's new boyfriend. She's into dudes now?"
He hadn't ever been convinced of Jo's intervening expertise. Hell, Becky Rosen still sent half of the class forwards of her Spike and Giles slash fiction and that was after getting Jo's special brand of 'help' for the last six years. But he felt like between himself, Garth, and Dean they could probably offset her half-assed attempts at Oprahing the new kid enough to get the guy laid at least. Judging from Castiel's less than enthusiastic response to Jo, he needed to start with baby steps.
Tessa waited until the two boys had left his classroom before turning back towards Chuck with an astonished look on her face. "That was way easier than I thought it would be. I should've asked for Castiel's help with him a long time ago."
Anna was in her final year at The Joffrey Ballet School and Castiel knew that he was not the only one in the audience who had broken down into an ugly, sobbing mess during her last dance recital.
Castiel nodded and smiled widely against Dean's lips, letting them be caught this time by the hunter who he had wanted to kiss for as long as he could remember. Let the other man take control of the exchange by nibbling on his bottom lip and swiping his tongue across the seam of his mouth until he opened it so Dean could deepen their kiss, pressing Castiel back down onto the couch with a murmured, "Happy New Year."
*ALSO* I realized I picked a really shit day to post this so I may be editing which days I post after tonight, depending on how much it interferes with me/all of you watching the new season. Let me know if another day works better for you guys!!!
It was not what Dean was used to. He preferred classic rock that he often played at ear splitting levels as he cruised around in the Impala or was working in Bobby’s garage. Sam called it cock rock and tried to change the station to NPR when he thought Dean wasn’t noticing. And it really wasn’t what he had been expecting Castiel to be listening to, he seemed more like a blues kind of guy with his deep, smokey baritone and serious demeanor, but if blues had a modern counterpart then Dean figured that maybe this could be it.
They took me to the hospital, the nurse said that I needed x-rays for my ribs and I was having a hard time staying conscious because of hitting my head. I remember there being a lot of blood, most of it was mine, but I'm pretty sure I got one of those assholes before they ganged up on me. Maybe broke his nose or something."
But as they grow, humans become reckless and violent; self-sacrificing to a fault and stubborn in their own devotions to those they feel the need to keep safe. And yet they do not evolve a tough exterior to shield them from the harshness of living, allowing their own flesh to be wrent and blood to be spilt like they do not understand its preciousness.
"Hey Meg," Sam said forcing his voice to sound cheery as he sank even farther into the bed with a defeated sigh. "How's your new boyfriend working out for you?
Castiel had always dreaded summers, they dragged on and on with seemingly no end in sight, trapped in a home that felt foreboding and with a family he felt out of sync with. He usually spent a vast majority of the summer cloistered in his room with his iPod or at the local park jogging and practicing rifle drills with the striped down rifle that his father had gotten for him. It was really one of the few indulgences that had been allowed to him since his father thought that the ROTC at Lake Forrest promoted discipline. He supposed you could count the iPod as an indulgence, but that had been a present from Gabriel and he wasn’t even sure if his father had known about the abundance of secular music that was programmed on the device, not that it really mattered now. The rifle had earned Castiel some strange looks the first time he had brought it to the park that was a couple of blocks away from his new house, but he had managed to convince the few early morning walkers and joggers that he wasn’t the Son of Sam by bribing them shamelessly with coffee and donut holes.
"Anna?" Castiel said concern and anger warring for dominance in his voice as his sister pulled away wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand before covering her mouth and rolling her eyes at him in an endeared way. "What's wrong? Did something happen? With Kevin?"
It wasn't his fault that it was happening and he was getting really tired of getting slapped in the back of his head by Jo every day when she saw him trying to escape from one of his admirers in the most polite way possible, by smiling and complementing them as he gave the 'it's not you it's me speech' over and over until he felt like he was a broken record.
But he wasn't repressed and it had been years since he had been a virgin not that it mattered in the slightest to him when he had been one and he kind of liked that Chris just hadn't assumed anything about him. The attractive, older man who had bought him a drink seemed genuinely interested in Alfie and his past and what had brought him to California. They had been on three dates.
"Why are you out here?" She asked turning her head to look at him and settling her hands on her stomach. "Hiding from someone?"
They made it all the way through dinner and a tour of the house before they had their first slip up and honestly Castiel had been surprised that it hadn't happened sooner. It happened in the garage and if he didn't love her so much he would've had Darla melted down for scrap for betraying him so heinously. Dean had been tinkering with the Porsche off and on all week, admiring the interior and the overall craftsmanship of the vehicle before delving into the engine and tuning it up, insisting that if Castiel was going to keep paying for things all the time then he could at least give the car an oil change.
He could feel someone looking at him, but he didn't tear his eyes off of the screen and Bill Murray because if only he could go back and do over a couple of days until he got it right maybe his life would be better. And he didn't want to see the question on her face if it was Charlie and if Dean was looking at him he definitely didn't want to see that because it was going to just ruin his carefully constructed wall of self control that he had just spent all of that time building so that he wouldn't dwell too much to the image that was flitting through his mind of Dean on the cover of one of his mom's old romance novels.
Not a single voicemail was from his boyfriend, there wasn't even a measly text to let him know that the other boy was still alive and Cas felt the icy dread clawing at his throat until he was shaking. Meg was so distraught and part of him was aware that the fact that he couldn't force any words out of his throat was just fueling her worry. She had already wrapped three spare blankets around his shoulders before he managed to bat her away so he could curl up on his side on her couch and focus on keeping the looming panic attack at bay instead of her fluttering, frantic movements. His mind raced with all the horrible things John could be doing to Dean. Images of torn, bloody fingernails and smoking shotgun barrels assaulted him behind his closed eyelids so he settled on staring blankly at the wall until his eyes watered from not blinking.
Dean downed the rest of the beverage in his cup and looked around the room to see if he could spot Castiel yet. "I'm gonna need to be drunk to deal with you two all night. Where's the keg?"
It wasn’t uncommon for his friend to talk in riddles so Dean just furrowed his brow and gave the other man a confused look which caused Cas to awkwardly clear his throat and poke pointedly at the bowl of ramen in his lap.
“Always,” the angel replies, his stubbled jaw rasping against Dean’s neck as he speaks and tightens his hold on the hunter in his arms. “Every morning that I have with you, forever.”
"What's wrong, Gabe?" He asked in a worried tone, drawing away slightly from the other boy so that he could take in his whole expression.
"Please continue forewoman," the judge offered, waving the startled jury spokeswoman on with a wave of his hand.
"I'm confused," Crowley said, frowning as he crossed his legs and propped his chin up on his hand. "Isn't that what you are? It never helps anything to lie on your resume, dear. Just go in there in what you came in here in. What was it again, Dick?"
He lost himself in the simple, monotonous task that the crosswords provided him humming under his breath as he worked and periodically pushing his glasses back up his nose or running a hand through his hair when a clue for the puzzle stumped him. It was almost fun, working on something that wasn't really challenging but still required paying attention and there wasn't a deadline on it; which was honestly probably the best thing about the brain-teaser. Castiel could put it down and pick it up at his leisure and not feel like his chest was caving in or the world was going to spin off of its axis if he didn't finish it by a certain time. It was freeing.
"Listen, Brett Farve can you leave us alone? We were kinda in the middle of a conversation." Meg said her voice sounding dangerous and laced with venom.
"Oh and Meg is making spaghetti and you are going to eat it," Jo declared pausing as she started to shut the bathroom door behind herself. The petite blonde held up a warning finger when Castiel opened his mouth to tell her that he wasn't hungry, that he probably wouldn't be able to hold anything down until he saw Dean again and knew the other boy was safe. "No sir. You're going to eat it and if you throw up then you're going to be on a steady diet of Pepto and Saltines for the rest of the weekend. Worrying yourself sick over a silly fight is not going to make anything any better. Got it?"
"Yea," Castiel said, squinting at the bowl on the counter that used to be full of bananas and apples and mangos, but was now just full to the brim and overflowing with plastic packaged squares of condoms. "What exactly is going on there?'
He held out a hand to stop her before she ended up sitting on his drawing, but she saw it before he said anything. And the look on her face was just too weird, too much like how she had looked at him in the cafeteria when she had caught him staring at Dean for Castiel not to blush all the way to the tips of his ears and start to sweat.
The short five miles between his school and the house was just far enough for Castiel to realize that he was wandering with a purpose other than just getting home, cutting across side streets and zigging when he should have just zagged his way back onto the straightest, quickest path home. But honestly, it wasn't until he was actually standing on the sidewalk in front of St. John's that he felt the tightness in his chest release just a little bit.
The larger boy had a wide smile on his face and Castiel couldn't help but feel the anxiety drain out of him at the other boy's approach. Dean just had that effect on him, made him feel like he could take on the world as long as the other boy was with him.
"I really think you should just calm down," Charlie said, stepping in closer to him as she looked pointedly over her shoulder to where Missouri was lurking in the doorway, her gaze tracking back and forth between Castiel and Dean as the other patient excused his way past her and continued in the direction of the nurses' station. "Maybe take a deep breath or seven. In and out, that's right; just like that. Now, Cas, I
"Um…your car breaks down, diner's stop serving pie," Castiel searched his mind for something horrible enough that would make Dean do something dangerous and drastic.
"You'd be surprised by how many people are lacking the good Samaritan gene," Gabriel told his brother softly, moving to sit close to the younger boy to gently pry his hand off of the chair; looking at Sam pleadingly as he continued to pace before the younger Winchester dropped heavily into the seat beside him. "We'll find him, Cassie. I promise."
So the summer had passed slowly and Dean had done his level best to not kill his brother who was bursting with stories about his classes and the antics that the older students in his lectures got up to. He spent less time with the guys on his football team when he found that he couldn’t really stomach the stories of their conquests, which he knew he wasn’t much better but he wasn’t the type of guy to kiss and tell, and more time with Jo, Ash, and Garth whom he had always kinda considered his backup friends as horrible as that sounds. However, he amended his previous designation for them rather quickly after a heated night of watching Star Wars with the trio that had degraded into mock light saber battles in Garth’s basement rec room using broom handles resulting in several large bruises, a busted lip, and a broken figurine of a dancing unicorn. Those fun nights had been the only bright spots of color in an otherwise washed out summer and Dean had resolved to have more nights with people he could actually stand to be around.
“Fuck, I didn’t shave my legs this morning,” Dianne cursed as she dug through her trunks of clothes presumably for some hosiery.
"I can do an accent," Castiel whispered into his ear, breathing hot and steamy against his overheated skin that was already becoming slick with sweat. "You vant I do accent, yes?"
Dean had to check himself the first time that Castiel gasped when his bottom teeth unintentionally scraped along the underside of the smaller boy's cock, in Dean's experience teeth weren't good, they weren't always bad either, but he knew that he was not being exactly gentle with his boyfriend because he was hard too and it was difficult to focus on every little thing that his mouth was doing when he just wanted to moan and jerk off and let Cas thrust into his mouth. He was scared of choking though, of gagging on Castiel's dick and making this whole thing decidedly less sexy. His boyfriend may be shorter than him and look slender under those unassuming cardigans that he liked to wear, but he was not small in the areas that counted.
When Dean made it back to his apartment, he snatched up his laptop on his way to his bedroom. He took his friend's advice and changed the sheets on his bed, but chose to keep the mismatched pillowcases on because they still smelled faintly like Castiel and he really wasn't ready to give that up yet. He propped his laptop up on the bed beside him and pulled back up the other man's old myspace page.
Fuck, amazing? That sounded like the kind of compliment that you gave a girl who had just spent a lot of money on a dress for a date with you. Like a prom compliment. Gorgeous? Dean wasn't a model, but he could be; fully, but there was no way in hell that he could say that and still hold on to the thin thread of himself that wasn't a complete stranger. So he settled for something stupid, something that made Dean sound like Cas thought he was a piece of pie.
"I don't see why not," Balthazar replied with a shrug, taking a dainty sip of his coffee before clearing his throat and continuing."She's doing a show about movie remakes and I was going to do a phone interview with her later this afternoon anyway about the film, but I'm sure she wouldn't mind taking a jab at the lower lifeforms of her profession. You could bemoan how paparazzi sensationalize every aspect of actors' lives and work your defense of Meg and Charlie into that somehow."
"Sorry, guys. My day's getting away from me a bit, you know how it is." Garth apologized, flicking his eyes over the cups that had the last names of the patients they were meant for written around the inside edge. "Okay, Lindberg. Winchester. And...Shurley. There you go guys, swallow and show me. Anybody seen Becky around?"
"And how are you and Dean doing? I saw him at the trial, he seemed very supportive of you and your family. What are his college plans?"
Dean noticed Cas give the younger man an almost imperceptible shake of his head before turning all of his attention back to Dean. The angel’s blue eyes boring into Dean with an intensity that always managed to take his breath away.
He had jerked himself awake in the early hours of the morning and run off the adrenaline that was pumping through his veins in the park, leaving his muscles trembling and lungs burning painfully. A part of him hated Rachel for bringing up his father when she knew it was the one thing he didn't want to talk about. A smaller part of him knew that she was just doing her job, which was to help him learn to trust others again. But, damnit! Couldn't she just let him do it on his own fucking terms?
"Dean, please. You're such a fucking tease," Castiel groaned throwing his head back wantonly against the pillows, exposing the long column of his neck.
“Your mother was worried about you,” his father explained, making Castiel’s heart squeeze painfully in his chest. “I told her I would call to check on you, she says she misses you.”
"Oh, don't tell Gabriel." Castiel said and Dean relaxed because he could hear the smile in the other boy's voice.
"Don't you all have something better to do," She snapped to her students causing them to jump and go back to whatever they had been doing before she walked into the classroom.
Guys, I'm going out of town this weekend and finished this in a hurry without proofreading it again. I know I always have some mistakes, but this one might have more than my sadly betaless self usually catches so I apologize for that now. Feel free to shower me with your thoughts, I go where most fangirls fear to go; to a place where shipping is met with the response "Like with boats?" However, I will get to see the most adorable baby ever today so that makes up for it and there may be cute baby spam all over my social media, I'll apologize for that too.
The only ones still stubbornly holding out hope for the older man were him and Bobby. And his uncle had even gotten to the point where he refused to be around John when he was drunk anymore, still talking to him on the phone though when John called in during the rare times when he decided to check in on his boys when he was out of town. Usually it was in the middle of the day when Dean was at school and he only knew of his father's fleeting concern when Bobby slipped and mentioned it in passing, but it was still there and that's what kept him picking up his father from the bars even though his hurtful comments about Sam and Gabe hit too close and too hard to home.
Beside him, the smaller boy surreptitiously adjusted the bulge in his pants and that just made Dean laugh harder because he was so turned on by just a kiss too and what were they going to do when they actually tried to have sex?! They couldn't even make out without both of them creaming their pants. It was so ridiculous and amazing and Dean finally felt like he was on an even playing field with Cas for the first time since they had started exploring what each other liked with heated kisses and brushes of hands over clothing.
"I…" He said drawing out the word and twirling a finger at his confused looking friend. "Rescued you."
"Well...good," Castiel stammered out and for once it was from a pleasant sort of shortness of breath instead of anxiety about saying the wrong thing. "Because...um, I'd hate for you to take my date idea. Y'know for if there are dates...between you and um...me."
Novak. A new student from Illinois who Virgil had discovered through some not exactly school-board approved snooping had left his old school on rather dubious terms, but had been awarded several ribbons after his departure that marked him as a distinguished cadet and an expert marksman. Lord knew they could use more experienced members on their rifle team if they wanted to outshoot those girls at Lawrence Free State so Virgil had decided that he couldn't be too picky when it came to his cadets. Don't ask don't tell seemed to work pretty well for the regular Army, so he figured at least adopting the same policy would make the experience as realistic for his high schoolers as possible.
"Uniforms? That sucks, Cas." Dean said as he made up an answer on the Algebra homework he was supposed to have finished over the weekend.
They had gotten home late the night before, driving into the early hours of the morning with Castiel dozing with his head in Dean's lap until they reached the street that his boyfriend's apartment complex was on and the other boy roused him enough for them to stumble out of the Impala and up to their bedroom. Chicago and everything there that had hurt him was behind him now and he fell asleep in Dean's arms thinking only of the future and how bright it had looked for the two of them; together against anything.
"No!" Dean said quickly, looking over at Castiel who was just sitting there with a pleased expression on his face for finally having made the larger boy embarrassed about something for once. "Not boning! Just...wait how do you even know what that is anyway, Jo?!"
Dean didn't stir until dinner time when Charlie came over and shook his shoulder, rousing the other patient from where he had curled up  with Cas's arm around his shoulders and his head tucked underneath the dark haired man's chin. Cas may have been too busy forming new constellations out of the freckles on Dean's face to have noticed what time it was, but that didn't stop the other man from giving him a grin as he shook off Cas's apology for not waking him sooner.
"Because you knew that you weren't going to stick around long enough for me to ever have to know who you really were!" The other man spat at him, slamming down a clenched fist on his leg and letting out a frustrated growl. "Just tell me who you are, Cas."
fallen asleep from where the other boy had been stubbornly leaning up against them since Castiel had snagged the armchair first yet again. They had also stopped at their table on the walk home and Dean had given him another impromptu astronomy lesson that had taken the smaller boy about twenty minutes to realize was completely made up.
"I forgot to tell you something." Dean said excitedly. "Coach benched me on Friday, since I missed last week's game he's not going to let me play."
"Oh, so you are a movie producer then? And all of the acting credits under your belt are what? Your hobby?"
"Home away from home," the bartender added, shutting his eyes and smiling softly; remembering what his apartment already looked like from just the few times that Cas had stayed over.
He felt like it was just a preview of what they could have together if Dean gave them the chance, but he was also so ridiculously in love with the other boy that he was willing to wait until his boyfriend came to his senses about the whole John thing. Dean had been so patient waiting on the story about his dad and Raphael that it felt unfair to try to force him to do something that he didn't want to do as far as the Winchester patriarch was concerned, but he wanted the other boy to know that he wanted a crappy first apartment that belonged to only them and he wanted to fight about stupid stuff like paint colors and dishes and bills. As long as he did all of those things with Dean, it's what he wanted.
"I bet. Can we go now?" the bartender asked, changing the subject off of something that would make him start cycling like a jealous jerk again when he knew that if anyone was being too friendly with anyone, it was Balthazar towards Cas and his boyfriend would tell the other man to back off if it got too out of hand. Wouldn't he?
"It's nothing, Dean." The other boy said robotically, the muscle in his jaw twitching and his adam's apple bobbing spasmodically giving away the fact that he was trying to keep something back. "Just drop it."
"You bloody well will explain. Do you know what I woke up to? A sodding bike messenger ringing my bell at eight in the morning with a bloody envelope full of pictures of you snogging another man in the middle of traffic!"
Okay everybody! I don't really have much to say this round. Thanks to everyone who's commenting or bookmarking or subscribing. You make me feel warm fuzzies. Keep doing what you're doing.
Holly let herself be mostly pushed towards the rack of clothes and shoes by Kim who seemed way more enthusiastic for the mini-challenge than anyone had any right to be. She snatched off a hanger that had a sweatband with the name ‘Holly Cummunion’ stitched on it in lurid curlicues and claimed the heels that were placed on a low platform beneath it that just happened to be in her size, 11.
"She didn't eat breakfast," Becky said weakly, twisting her hands in her lap and resolutely not looking at Crowley who had started frowning at her. "Charlie, she didn't eat."
Castiel said sounding just as torn up as he did and that shouldn't help, knowing that the other man was just as miserable as he was, but it did.
Sorry that this is late and I know that you've probably been cursing my name, regretting the day you ever stumbled on to this and I'm sorry! But I've been working on something else big and that's no excuse, but when its done ITS DONE and I'm sure you'll like it when I finally finish it. I will be on time next week I promise...I love you all. :)
"I have to go," Castiel forced out, his hand reaching up to cover his throat as he spoke because it felt like his throat was closing up and everything that he had thought he could handle turned out to be things that he really really couldn't handle by himself and he was just so…
Now he just felt stupid for still caring enough to want to try to please Dean. His friend hadn't spoken to him all day Thursday and hadn't shown up at school or the game on Friday at all, much to Coach Wisdom's displeasure. And the only explanation that Castiel could think of was that the other boy was too disgusted by him to want be around him anymore. If Cas had just been able to keep how he was feeling in check then maybe this all wouldn't have happened. He knew that it was one thing for Dean to be supportive and accepting of the fact that Sam liked other men they were family after all, but it was a completely different story when he had to spend every day stuck with a boy who just wouldn't stop mooning at him like a silly prepubescent girl with a crush.
"Of course I saw you," Castiel snapped crossing his arms over his chest. "And why her, Dean? Like it's not enough that you called her my name when you were with her, you have to let her paw all over you in front of everyone we know."
He had shaved, going so far as to use the fancy cologne that Ellen had gotten him for his birthday that he had never used, and parted his hair keeping it down with some of the pomade that he didn't think Sam knew about because if he did then his hulking younger brother would probably never stop making fun of him about it. Dean spent about an hour just pacing around the house, looking for an iron to get rid of a wrinkle in his pants that Sam swore he was imagining and changing his socks and boxers like four times because it was really the only thing he was able to choose about what he was wearing. Everything else had come with the rented suit. Except for the cufflinks.
"Everyone is here for a reason, right?" Cas replied brushing off the apology because if he had an ounce of courage at all he probably would've stood up to Dick and Crowley too, but it had taken everything he had not to start hyperventilating himself during group so he considered the fact that he was standing a victory in and of itself. "Hey, um...what's the next group or whatever? I'm supposed to sit in on some stuff today, figure out what I might need to work on."
"Like anything. I mean there has to be something out there, right? Something bigger than all of this. It is arrogant to think that we are all alone. That we are all there is."
"You've been spending too much time with him if you're already making deals," Castiel muttered, feeling his heart race because if Balthazar could keep Crowley distracted while also slowly bringing him around to the idea of Castiel being allowed to have a relationship then this movie could be the thing that changed his life in more ways than one. "You aren't going to tell him?"
The larger boy watched his friend and smiled as he was reminded of another day when Cas had been sitting on a picnic table, before he had started noticing all of the small little quirks that were specific to his blue-eyed friend. Dean hopped up onto the opposite end of the table and laid back so that his head was next to the other boy's, legs falling off of the end of the table. It wasn't very comfortable. Dean striped off his jacket and rolled it up, motioning for Cas to lift his head up and sliding half of the makeshift pillow underneath. He settled back again and shifted until he had his own portion of the jacket mashed into a comfy position.
"Okay boys," Jo said plopping down heavily at the cafeteria table and letting out a tired sigh, stretching her neck and arms from where they had started to hurt from carting around her heavy backpack all day. "If you're wanting a pie this year, my mom says you need to get on it because after Tuesday she is not going near our oven again until Christmas."
"You're James Collins," Jess said with a shrug, giving him a confused look at the panic that must have crossed his face. "Right? I'm a big Hitchcock fan and I've been following the story about Roche's new movie."
"Where are you two going?" Gabriel called from where he was leaning up against Sam, dwarfed by the long arm that the younger man had slung around shoulders and watching
The knocking on the doorframe was what startled him out of his brooding at about five minutes to midnight, causing Dean to look up to see Cas peeking around the door at him with a shy smile on his face. The other man was in his pajamas already, a pair of Green Lantern pajama bottoms and that horrible Christmas sweater that Crowley had made with grey yarn that Dean thought made Cas's eyes pop six different ways from Sunday. He couldn't fucking knit worth a damn, but the demon sure knew which colors worked best on someone, especially since Gaddy's was a gold color that brought out the lighter strands in his new vessel's shockingly ginger hair.
“Well, jailbait can’t drink any of it,” Raphael answered in a bored tone as he picked at his chipping nail polish. The other man looked up when his remark was met with silence and it was then he saw the scathing look that Castiel and Balthazar were giving him as Kevin blushed down at his feet. “Whaaaat? You bitches know I’m joking.”
Alfie took at seat at the bar, asking the wispy redheaded bartender for a jack and coke and hoping that she didn't look too closely at his fake ID that he only needed for a couple more months until he could drink without it. He didn't think that he had fooled her very much since when he got his drink it tasted way more like soda than alcohol and he figured that once he had finished this one he could go back to the VIP bar with Cas and Dean would serve him whatever he wanted anyway. He pulled out his phone so that he didn't have to make eye contact with anyone and focused on his drink and the level of Angry Birds that he was intent on getting three stars on if it killed him.
It was easy to slip back into whatever this thing was with Dean. Hell, after freaking out all afternoon it was certainly not a hardship to just sit there and let Dean play with his hair and then hold his hand and then snuggle up against his shoulder, muttering that he was going to shut his eyes for just a second. And he probably should've felt really creepy for watching Dean doze, surely Meg would've called him on it if she had caught him watching her nap on the sofa back at the apartment, but he didn't think that Dean would mind since the other man had declared him the perfect pillow as he had slipped off to sleep.
Gabriel stuck his tongue out at the younger man, but went to do what he said pausing long enough to point a stern finger at his little brother. "I spent a fortune on that fucking monstrosity of a costume so you better be there, Cas."
Castiel decided that he had heard enough, maybe Lisa wasn't really a therapist just like a volunteer or something. It probably wouldn't be against the rules for her to date a patient once they discharged and it really shouldn't bother him so much that Charlie was trying to set Dean up with her. He didn't even like guys, okay maybe he appreciated them from afar sometimes, but it always became weird when he started thinking of it in terms beyond that; he could barely look Alfie in the face anymore after giving the other man his number so that he could call about some GRE flashcards that Cas had made. It had felt too much like begging for a date and the pitying look on the other man's face had just confirmed that he really had been acting weird around his study partner even though he had been trying his damndest not to.
"Cas," Dean said seriously, licking his lips and nodding at his lap. "I promise, I'm pretty damn motivated. I'm sure I can think of something I want to win."
He almost fell off the bench when he did finally get his hands back under control long enough to flip the page open and that was only because Cas thought he was going to black out since there was suddenly no air in any area of the hospital, maybe inside those oxygen canisters, but since he didn't have one then he was going to die. Castiel was going to die and this was what he had wanted so why was he freaking out over the feeling of clutching, tearing narrowness that always accompanied his panic attacks?
"I didn't do it," Castiel admitted, plopping down on the bed across from her and clasping his hands together in his lap while she leaned back on his bed and placed the drawing in the space between them on the sheets that had gotten twisted during his earlier nap. "I uh...I was talking to my brother and when I came back it was here. Someone left it for me and Rufus said he didn't see who it was."
"So we're going out tonight," Charlie said beside him, side-eyeing him with a sly smirk on her face. "Alfie said he knows this great bar, bartenders are supposed to be super foxy."
"Shit," the other man cursed under his breath, glancing around the room and shaking his head. "Of course fucking Crowley's missing too. Listen guys, do me a solid and don't cheek your meds. I'm looking at you Ash, I've got to sort this crap out."
He cleared his throat and snapped a quick salute at the boy who was once battalion commander of the ROTC at Lake Forrest, something that Virgil felt couldn't just be stripped away, Novak had earned it."I expect to see you at drill practice on Wednesday. Now get out of here, son."
They hadn't talked about spending the night together and Dean had just figured that Cas would probably offer Roche one of the guest bedrooms in the house because he had already mentioned doing so since they were going to be going to the same places for work together everyday anyway. But he wasn't going to stop Cas if he wanted to come over and the small sting of jealousy he felt about his partner having dinner with the director was soothed by the offer. Dean had just started a reply to Cas saying that he would leave the door unlocked for him when he got home when his phone started going off in his hand again, playing the ringtone he had set for Alfie's number that he had programmed when he and the younger man started seriously talking surfboards and shark repellant.
The lions had been doing amazingly well all season, barring that first disastrous away game and with only two games left in the year Wisdom had been letting the players out of practice earlier and earlier.
"And then what?" Cas asked, his voice small and defeated sounding as he nodded miserably along with everything that Bobby was telling him to do.
People whose families never spoke to them. People who actively had their families turn on them with violence or hatred. People who never told their families and regretted it for the rest of their lives.
When it was over Castiel let out a soft sigh and the hot, damp air on his neck made Dean turn around to see his friend smiling softly. "How many times have you seen this?"
Cas gave the other girl a confused look and shrugged his shoulders like he knew what she was talking about, but he really didn't. He hadn't seen the other girl around the ward during the day before, but that didn't mean she wasn't a patient or anything; is not like being in a hospital was exactly a social event so it was fully possible that she had kept herself in her room up until now and that's why it was the first time he was seeing her.
Naomi had turned prepared to search through the clouds that always covered Chuck's gaze, but had been surprised to find the familiar blue eyes of the other man clearer and more piercing than she had ever seen them; reaching past her defenses to make her forget how to breath for just a second. That second was more than enough though for the other man to get an awkward joke in and for him to use the nickname that no one else dared to use besides her sister and Tessa. It was comforting to know that even though they hadn't talked in a while that they could still pick up where they had left off. Since the disastrous events of the New Year's Eve party when she had realized that until Chuck saved himself she was just reliving the same cycle of unhealthy codependency that she had left behind with Scott in New York Naomi had kept her distance, but now...maybe now she could stop torturing herself by staying away when it was the last thing she wanted to do.
“I don’t watch a lot of movies,” Castiel admitted, crossing his arms protectively over his chest when the elevator doors opened, revealing a large sign proclaiming ‘Adult Psychiatric’ with a big arrow pointing towards a set of double doors with built in windows on the left. “I’m usually too busy with schoolwork.”
"I just got all worried about what I was going to wear to the interview," Charlie admitted, easing her grip on the back of Dean's shirt slightly as she talked. "I mean I have like no nice clothes, everything is donated stuff and I don't want them thinking I'm like...a bum or something."
"No, we have to take a field trip." Dean mumbled above him, tightening his arms where they had circled around Castiel's waist for a second before climbing quickly to his feet, pulling the smaller boy with him out of the bedroom and towards the front of the house.
