He leaves Claire and Kaia with Miracle and makes his way to Cas.
into the darkness of the cabin. And he can feel his own orgasm building, knows this is gonna blind him. Knows if he were still an angel his climax would trigger a supernova in some far distant galaxy.
Cas’ bottom lips trembles and then he’s huffing out a laugh. Dean can feel his cheek heating under his palm. It’s a beautiful sight.
There's an ebb and Dean knows the Grace is leaving his system, knows Cas is taking it back. He cracks his eyelids and watches as Cas swallows the swirling blue light.
He feels rather than sees the smirk that breaks across Cas' face.
Yet so familiar.
Sam had headed out in the Impala with Crowley - Crowley of
Dean patterns circles into the thin layer of dirt and dust that's settled on the hood of the Impala due to its weeks of disuse and watches all the same. He grows increasingly angrier every time someone else exits through the beaded curtain he'd begrudgingly helped Cas hang up.
Dean flinches, hating himself. Angry with himself for not accepting that sometimes some wounds just run too deep to ever fully heal. Especially when they’ve been poked at so recently. Even though it had been the shadow of the Empty, it had smelt like him, it’d felt like him, and it certainly spoke like him too. Suppose you don’t have to be an angel or a demon for a pissed off cosmic being to torture you with all your worst hits.
It's a gamble, something like this might very well make Dean too skittish, might freak him out too much, but it doesn't.
"Better?"
Jealousy shatters across Dean's bones and twist through his stomach like a well placed knife. He spins Cas around and grips his face in his hands, eyes darting across his features cause doesn't he get it yet? How can he not get it yet?
I kept the Crowley cameo out of the tags for the surprise of it. Because yes, the first instance of Crowley is actual Crowley. Also, if you've ever read anything else I've written, you'll know that I am often fond of bringing up the crypt scene and the opening of Goodbye Stranger because they still have never spoken about it and it has been SEVEN YEARS. unacceptable.
But he remembers the way the Empty had crowded into his personal space, wearing the face and milk-white eyes of Dean’s living hell before Cas had hauled the thing away from him, saved him from that asshole
"When'd you get so wise, huh?"
, is cut off when a spectacular array of goosebumps shatter across his skin.
‘More times than we care to count,’ Cas interjects. Dean smiles at him, recognising his own mannerisms reflected in Cas.
"I know," Dean breathes, surprised that he's even able to speak, surprised to find that he really, really does. "I just-" He leans in, a gentle touch of lips, and his throat is so constricted... he doesn't know how to say the words.
The clip has been ejected, and a single round sits atop it.
The flipping sensation is back in Dean's stomach, and he swallows it down thickly, his mind a mess of violent memory and soft desire to kiss, to claim, to love. but Michael gives a violent thump on the door in his brain and Dean swears he can hear the bastard's laughter.
His thumb hovers over the call button. He could ignore her. Wallow in the wave of memories of a little girl with the same blue eyes, glowing full of grace, her hands gently cradling her father’s face as he signed over his life to being chained to a comet.
He takes his kisses lower, leaving a wet trail across Cas’s shoulders, over his heart, across the Enochian still inked into the skin of his ribs. Dean’s heart drums a rapid tattoo in his chest, and he can’t help himself but lean back up to slot his mouth to Cas’ once more; his lips, a drug.
Cas kisses him once more and says, "I know," with conviction, letting the weight of the world wash away down the drain in a swirl of bloodied water.
So that meant Dean was going to do what he always did – had done only a few hours ago – and that was run off in search of more alcohol and pretend like it wasn't a big deal that he was leaving their tenuous friendship with a fatal bullet wound to the skull.
he'd said, when what he'd really meant was:
'I'm sorry.'
Finally, fucking
‘Leaving you was never what I wanted,’ he says.
saving him. Cas kisses his jaw, his ear, his brow, his nose, sucks a bruise to the hollow of his throat, drops his head down to place a kiss over his heart, back to his lips. Every press of his mouth is reverent, every brush of his lips is a prayer, and it breaks Dean open.
Dean shrugs. 'I know I could've done but...' he trails off, not really sure why he'd insisted on staying, on allowing Sam and mom to have some time together.
Dean tries to shake his head, knows sleep is impossible with all his worst hits stuck on repeat, but Cas presses his lips to Dean’s forehead, the world tips sideways, grows dark.
‘Sleep?’ Sam offers, wry grin on his face.
They drive in silence for what feels like forever, Dean coaxing the Impala through the shitty weather and Cas watching the snow descend from the passenger-side window. And things go as swimmingly as they can when the sky's split open and pouring ice over you. The silence isn't awkward (Dean finds it never is with Cas), and he keeps them going at a steady twenty five miles per hour until Baby starts to make a heart wrenching whine as Dean tries to push on through the mounting snow.
It's the first time Dean's ever vocalised what he wants. Usually Cas just goes on instinct when it comes to getting their fearless leader off. Usually it's a lot of rutting, or a blow job. Occasionally, Dean'll fuck him as mercilessly as he did just now. But this?
“You good?”
Dean’s eyes flicker up then. “What do you mean
The unease ebbs and it's all the encouragement Dean needs.
He bites bruises to Dean's collar bone and tightens his grip just a little further, choking off his airway just enough to slow Dean's oxygen intake. To make his body feel all warm and sluggish. An over exposed nerve of sensation.
But there's a big part of Dean that really doesn't want to. Screw the damn weather, he's waited too long for this and if he has to wait any longer he thinks it might kill him.
He glances over to Cas, who had tagged along for the ride, and finds that the angel seems utterly unphased by the cold. Sure, he's squinting as the snow obscures his vision, but Dean can't be certain that that's not just the way Cas looks sometimes.
'So do I.' Cas offers the words so freely it causes Dean's heart to stutter.
“I am so sorry,” Cas whispers after a short while, words muffled in Dean’s hair. “I am so sorry that I hurt you so much.”
Sam, of course, had chosen the last two days to get sick. Nose streaming more gunk than necessary, a violent hacking cough that sounded like his lungs were trying to make a bid for freedom, and an insanely high temperature had his little brother bundled up under all the blankets Dean could find in the motel with a bottle of pills, tins of soup and strict instructions only to get up to pee.
'It might come as a surprise to you, Dean Winchester, but after all these years, I think I know you pretty well.' Cas' breath tickles his cheeks and sends a delightful tingle up his spine. He can't fight the smile that twitches the corners of his mouth.
, a small part of Dean's head tells him.
shaking through Cas makes so much more sense. The angel kisses him as though trying to extract the images from Dean's mind and he's whispering, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," though every press of lips.
It's times like these were the old Dean peaks back through, the same one that'd dragged him to a hooker and assured him he'd get him enthusiastically laid if it were to be his last night on earth. The Dean from before the apocalypse, the one these people in camp had never had the privileged to meet - save for Chuck - who had poked fun at Sam and didn't have to shoulder the weight of the world alone. Killing his Lucifer-possessed little brother was a burden Dean alone was forced to carry, but Cas hopes the hunter before him knows he'd never have to take that journey alone.
‘Anyone else gonna make it?’ Kaia asks Dean.
He leans over and kisses Dean softly, a brush of lips, a flutter of eyelashes on cheeks. His nose bumps against the angle of Dean's and he huffs a little breath that smarts against Cas' cheek.
Cas returns the smile with his own. “Hello Dean,” he says, and Dean huffs a laugh.
“You broke him out of the panic room. You were being such a good little soldier you didn't even question starting the goddamned apocalypse.” The rain grew louder, the branches rattled against the roof of the cabin and somewhere in the distance was a low rumble of thunder. “So yeah, Cas, this is your fault.”
"Bullshit. I'd say that was pretty damn important." Cas shrinks away from him looking anywhere but at Dean, until Dean cups his face with both hands and forces him to look. "I'm not mad," Dean whispers. "I've done some pretty fucked up shit, Cas. So have you. But that wasn't your fault."
As Cas’ cock slides against his, reminding him delightfully of an hour ago, he accepts that yeah, that would definitely be a good idea. His dick gives a twitch against Cas’ hip, throbs in Cas’ loose hand, and he privately tries to argue with himself that trading steamy handjobs in the shower is a perfectly respectable second time. But…
Sure, Kevin had absolved him of any fault but if Cas knew Sam, and he liked to think these days he had a pretty good grasp on the youngest Winchester, then he knew - forgiveness from Kevin or not - the Prophet's death still weighed heavily on Sam's mind. He also knew it was likely Sam would carry that guilt for years, just another cross to bare on shoulders that still hefted the remnants of demon blood, Lucifer and the apocalypse.
But the problem with companionable silence is that it allows the mind to wander after a while, and Dean's brain becomes a mess of his father's teary eyes, his mother's shallow sobs, the empty look on Cas' face in that diner where he looked at him, his head tilted but not really seeing him. There'd only ever been one other time in his life when Cas had looked at him like that and it had felt like as much of a punch in the chest as it had back then.
Cas huffs. ‘Essentially,’ he deadpans.
Then Dean holds out his hands, splaying his fingers to invite Cas to slot them back together. And Cas can't deny that's a tempting offer. He's already reaching across the bed when he gets a better idea and changes course.
“You’re thinking too much,” Cas says after several quiet moments.
His hum has Cas’ hips giving an involuntary twitch up into the wet heat of Dean’s mouth which only succeeds in making Dean smirk, relaxing his throat and letting Cas sink even further into his throat.
He hears Cas take a shaky breath, and then his hands are sliding down the line of Dean’s arms, fingers tangling together. “I-I dreamt of you too.” He runs a thumb idly over Dean’s knuckles, an absent-minded gesture, soothing, grounding. “That’s all the Empty really is. A ceaseless stream of torment. All your faults, all your failings. The people you hurt, the people you failed to save. It’s an excessively cruel form of torture. Trapped in your own mind, acting out every bad decision. I- I mean you saw,” Cas says, his voice suddenly thick. “Playing through what Naomi made me do to you in that Crypt.”
And then Cas is back, moving with a speed Dean would’ve only ever expected from his angelic powers, body flush against Dean’s, arms bracketed either side of Dean’s head, mouth claiming upon Dean’s own.
“You saved my life that night, Cas.” He rests his forehead to Cas’ shoulder and takes a deep, steadying breath. A couple of seconds pass at most and then Cas’ head is tilting, resting atop Dean’s.
He craves the reverence more than he's craved anything in his life.
Cas once held his bare soul in his hands, clutched it tight to his grace and saved him, and as his fingers trail patterns down Dean’s sides, card through his hair, stroke his neck and shoulders, Dean realises that he never
‘I would tear my grace from my body if it would help. I would happily fall more completely than I ever have in my entire existence if it meant I could spend even another second within your presence.’
They sit side by side at the breakfast bar and Dean finds it incredibly difficult to keep his hands from Cas; a brush of hands when picking up their coffee mugs, the bumping of shoulders and the lingering squeeze of a knee. Something soft and warm curls up under Dean’s sternum, as he reminds himself once again that he can have this.
He collapses forwards on top of Dean, whose body is shaking violently, and can barely think to do a single thing else.
Cas leans over and presses a gentle kiss to the swell of Dean’s bicep. “You worked very efficiently.” His lips are as hot as a brand even through the fabric of his t-shirt.
choose you. I don’t care what form it takes, I don’t care where we are.” Cas pulls back, hands still cradling Dean’s face like he’s precious, and he’s starting to believe that to Cas, maybe he is. “It will always be you and me.”
"Dean - "
Cas' hands shoot out and grapple with Dean's hair, try to tug him forwards but Dean wraps his hands around Cas' wrists and shakes his head. Then he laughs when Cas bucks his hips forwards.
The black seeps from Dean's eyes and he gasps for breath. Breath that's oxygen not sulphur.
‘Bullshit,’ he says before he can stop himself.
‘You said it’d protect against things finding us.’ He shrugs, feeling defensive. ‘Figured it wouldn’t hurt to carve it into the bar.’ Carefully, he slides the crate onto the nearest table and makes his way behind the bar to stand beside Cas. ‘Did I fuck it up?’
Cause what's the point in healing Dean if Abaddon's just going to catch him in the grace with a blade.
“I just - I couldn’t - I just wanted it to stop.” Dean can’t find it in him to even look at Cas, simply drops his forehead to Cas’ shoulder and clings to him for dear life. “Never was a smart drunk.”
Dean startles at the sound of Cas' voice and then twists in his seat to look over his shoulder. He glances back and Cas and says through a grin, "You tryin'a get me drunk, Cas?" Without waiting for an answer, he reaches round the seat, groping blindly in the back foot-well for the promised liquor until his fingers catch on cool glass.
They stay that way as they slowly come back to themselves. Cas’ arms tremble as he tries to lift his body back up, but Dean hushes him, tunnelling his fingers through Cas’ hair and holding him tightly to his body. He feels blissfully blank, nothing but euphoria and the weight of the man in his arms. His heart races against his ribs and he can feel Cas’ heart keeping time against his own.
Original lyric for this chapter came in the form of 'And baby I would fall from grace, just to touch your face.' However, it was too spoilery for my liking. Now go listen to Don't Blame Me by Taylor Swift.
With the slightest note of pressure, Cas guides Dean upright, and the hunter goes with it, pliant to Cas' desires.
Their foreheads touch and their eyes lock as Cas makes a loose fist around Dean’s cock. He moans a broken string of words into the hollow of Dean’s throat, languages Dean’ll never understand, until he pants several hot breaths just below Dean’s ear and whispers, “My beloved.”
‘You call her,’ he mutters, a half-assed retort even by his standards. He hits call before he can talk himself out of it.
He makes to move the hand from Dean's throat - doesn't want to push his luck - but Dean shakes his head wildly, snatches out with his own hand and guides it back into place. Cas smiles into Dean's neck, swipes his tongue down the chord of his throat tasting salt and sex and says, "Okay," into Dean's skin.
. His face flames. ‘My ribs?’
Dean can feel a flush creep up his neck, hears his breath catch in his throat. Less than twenty minutes ago they'd been talking about co-parenting a nephilim yet hearing Cas' words, accepting he was a part of their family, floored Dean more than could ever explain. And because Dean's an asshole, and he's chicken shit, and because he can't deal with the gravitas of emotion the way a normal person does, he forces out a strained laugh and says, 'I always forget how much of a big softie you are.'
With a filthy roll of his hips, Cas grinds down into Dean’s lap. “Okay,” he says, mouth wet and open against Dean’s. “Okay.” Cas’ hands rove across Dean’s back; smooth down the fabric of his shirt before reaching the hem and hoisting it up and over Dean’s head. “Okay,” Cas says again, almost as if it’s a mantra to settle himself and Dean squeezes his hands to Cas’ hips, grounding the pair of them.
Cas pauses from nibbling at the tender skin of Dean's earlobe to whisper, "I can feel every part of you. Your soul is singing."
And then she had made him perfect the art another one hundred and twenty six times.
Cas has his hands on his hips, a dark tee tight across the muscles of his arms and the sight has all the blood rushing down to Dean’s groin.
Dean watches as a seemingly endless string of women and men stumble out of Cas' cabin throughout the early hours of the morning. They trickle out in pairs or groups, one girl leaves alone, spinning across the dirt track, the early morning mist swirling around her milky calves.
An animalistic growl escaped Dean. Then his hands were clutching at Cas' ass and he was lifting him up and flipping him down onto the bed, climbing on-top of the ex-angel to kiss him, deeply, sweetly, hands cradling Cas' face like he cherished him. Cas sighed happily and bucked his hips up against Dean.
Cas’ breath is warm on the shell of his ear as he holds Dean to his chest. “Tell me what you need,” he says, all soft spilling down right into Dean’s gut and he knows -
“Yeah.” His voice sounds strange, little more than a whisper. He can barely keep his eyes open. “Yeah that - uh. Yeah.”
Before he can spiral much further Cas says, 'Do you think Sam will come back tonight?'
Cas anchors him, squeezes Dean's hands tight and urges him on with a moaned,
, it’d been far too long since he’d done this to himself, let alone let anyone else do it to him and he’d forgotten just how good that drag could feel. “Cas,” he moans, “Cas, Cas,” and he scrambles to draw Cas’ lips back to his own, to slide his tongue alongside Cas’ to taste and claim and be claimed in return. “
"No. Fucked my shoulder though."
A flush crests across his cheeks. “They’re just pancakes, Cas.”
Dean watches as though an outsider, glad this time he doesn’t have to stand in his own skin, weep those same tears and watch a literal angel cry as he’s torn away from the man that he loves.
He narrows his eyes at the bottle and tilts his head, and Dean smiles at the sight fondly. "I doubt it'll have the desired effect."
Dean worries his bottom lip, parsing the words around until they feel easier on his tongue. “You don’t regret it?” Cas makes a non-committal hum so Dean leans forward, tracing a light finger across the thin pink scar - all shiny and new - that glints at the pulsepoint of his throat.
Days of work had unravelled in seconds. Naomi hauled him back for reprogramming and started small again.
No, the duty of ending Abaddon would fall to Cas and Cas alone. It was labelled under the guise that Cas would be able to take out Abaddon far more easily than Sam would. After all, angel's are cold and they're detached, regardless of a short stint at humanity.
Dean leans forwards and silences Cas' sentence with a swift kiss. "Not your fault."
"A giant collumn of light? Yes."
Cas turns then, climbing into Dean’s lap and seeking out his mouth with his own. “You are a marvel,” Cas says between open-mouthed kisses. And Dean just rides through the feelings, lets them happen. His emotions have gone through such extremes within just the last few minutes his head is spinning. But there’s one thing that settles in him: the thought that he had spent so long -
‘Dean,’ Cas says slowly, straightening up, scowling at the bar.
He crawls across the floor, body shaking, pulls out another bottle of whiskey and sips from that. He can barely swallow. The room spins. He drinks until he vomits. He carries on drinking.
‘Still did it.’
It made sense, they'd agreed. Cas was an angel again these days and though once upon a time he might have played fast and loose with the lives of the Winchesters, there was now far too much at risk. They wouldn't leave Sam's fate in Dean's largely unreliable hands. Which is to say
It was everything," Dean says around the mouth of the bottle. "And I mean that."
, and Dean wants to get closer, somehow, never wants to let him go ever again.
Cas raises the blade and presses it to the side of his neck. It's cold and it pinches, it's rough edge prickling pain against his skin. He feels suddenly woozy.
. He has watched them burn and die and birth, seen galaxies collide, merge, morph in to one, and he thinks, perhaps, he and Dean are like that. That the super massive black holes at the heart of them both, yearn towards one another, gravitating together. And it shouldn't work, shouldn't fit, but they do, they do, they do.
Dean hushes him, breathes, "S'okay," into his mouth and holds Cas to him. And though there's no need for Cas to be apologising, has nothing to be absolved of in Dean's eyes, he chases the next kiss with an earnest, "I forgive you."
‘You know your bitching makes you sound about a hundred, right?’ Claire says as she hooks hers and Kaia’s helmets over the bike's handles.
"No."
The angle now changed, Dean drops his head back onto Cas' shoulder and rocks down harder still onto Cas' cock. And Cas gets the most beautiful view of Dean's slack jaw, his heavy-lidded eyes, the rivets of sweat trickling from his hairline. His face the utter picture of blissed out rapture.
But alive.
Cas registers a small moment of doubt, of surprise, before he kisses back. Dean is solid and warm to his touch. Once, Cas might've been able to see the neurons firing in off in Dean's brain, he might've been able to hear the rush of blood chasing through Dean's veins, he might've felt the warm glow of Dean's soul under his fingertips.
A flush bleeds across the hunter's cheeks and he leans away, startled and afraid.
'It's not. That was one of my most shameful moments in my whole existence.'
He covers his ears with shaking hands. Shakes his head like a dog trying to get water from its ears. Keeps repeating the same words over and over and over and over and over and over.
, but the words die on his tongue. Instead, he swallows thickly, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth and distinctly
‘The Enochian,’ Cas repeats. ‘Rowena’s spellwork is beautiful, but I’m sure she wasn’t behind the Enochian.’
But of course he said nothing, because he couldn't, because neither of them could. Instead he reached out and started stroking Dean's length, dipped down between Dean's legs and sucked at the underside of his thigh, biting a bruise into the delicate skin. He let his fingers wander, gently palmed Dean's balls all while planting soft kisses on sweat slick skin that trailed closer to the hunter's groin.
‘I love you, Cas,’ he says, resting his forehead against his husband’s. Their noses brush. ‘I love you.’ Those words used to scare him, were the only thing that struck fear into his heart with instant certainty.
"Hello Dean," Cas says.
thinking too much,” he grouses.
He feels Cas shift once more, can no longer feel his breath on his skin, and Dean laments the loss of it for all of two seconds before Cas lets out a breathy moan that’d make a pornstar jealous.
Number forty-two had thrown punches.
He didn't fall for this.
Abaddon paces against the edge of the elaborate Devil's Trap, that's reinforced by Enochian scrawled in angel blood. Dirty, but it'll do the trick. There are sigils staining every available surface, trapping the Knight completely.
“You should see yourself,” Cas says, his voice shaking. “You’re taking my fingers so well.”
Something monumental and world-changing always seems to happen on a water’s edge.
Dean snatches up that errant hand and holds it tightly, tracing a thumb over the swell of Cas’ shaking palm. “I’m not going to say it was okay,” Dean says, eyes downcast. There’s a bubble of shame in his gut, something that’d not been there since that night, and he clutches Cas’ hand to stop the tremors that threaten to break him apart at the seams. “It was stupid. And selfish.”
And, of course, Cas had never been able to deny Dean anything. It was exactly how they wound up in this situation in the first place: an apocalypse halfway to completion; the mother of all storms tearing through their tiny camp to welcome the devil to the earth in his perfect vessel; Cas with his wings torn away and burnt out, a heartbeat thrumming under his ribs, a buzz of whiskey and need flowing through his bloodstream as he slammed into Dean harder and faster.
Dean doesn’t need to ask who
‘Heya, Cas.’ He slides his hand down until he tangles his fingers with Cas’, feeling grounded in a way only Cas can achieve. ‘Claire and Kaia’re here.’ They start walking back towards the benches.
When Castiel struck him, there was barely a trace of hesitation left within the angel.
Abaddon shrinks away from it. But her movements are jerky and stilted, like she can't quite control Dean's limbs properly any longer.
When not-Dean begged, Castiel didn't listen.
Please share some kudos and comment if you got this far. And thank you for reading.
Cas walks Dean backwards into their bedroom, mouth a hot brand against Dean’s neck and fuck, he hopes more than anything that Cas’ll leave marks across his skin. The backs of his legs hit the bed and Dean falls backwards, drinking in the sight before him.
Wait, what?
Sam gave the signals for Direl to stay put. He’d take care of the guards.
She smiled in relief, rubbing at her arm. "Ahh, feck off, yeh knob, I’m only twenty years older'n you.”
“I— Okay,” Dean fumbled his bottle. “Bris. Right.”
“It wasn’t cold-blooded either, though it is remarkable that a Congolese monster took so well to the frigid water,” Cas said as Claire continued to write. “But I suppose if the tiny, tropical Monk Parakeet can survive American winters why couldn’t a multi-ton relative of the Plesiosaur? Life is just infinitely fascinating that way.”
“Yeah, yeah, mate, it’s me, it’s only me—”
“You never want me to explain the differential equations,” Cas shrugged, “so I used an appropriate reference instead.”
“If it wasn’t so difficult to find, I’d offer to get you another.”
“Fucking

But it always made sense.
Sam froze, his fork halfway to his mouth.
Sam’s hand found his phone, and he skipped the track without moving his head from his arms.
“No,” Cas answered wearily.
Dean searched Cas again, hoping desperately to see...
They parted, and his gaze lingered, searching her face. This was his chance, this was the opening, just ask her,
(See the end of the chapter for
She froze.
"We only just—"
Castiel frowned.
“So we'll fight them,” Sam said, heading off more argument. “I think Cas should go in the water and draw them out, and then we'll hop in when they show. Easy plan.”
Dean had said his eyes had lit up last night, and coupled with the incredible feeling the spell had given him, he'd really been expecting... something. But he hadn't felt anything since last night, and Sam was starting to think that there simply wouldn't be any effects beyond the treatment and a heavy dose of self-awareness— not that that wasn't great on its own, but...
Her gaze softened. “Now you need to know I’m not upset, love, just curious, yeah?”
“She don’t want me,” he said.

He would wake up, make breakfast for the occupants of the bunker that actually ate, sit in front of his laptop pretending to look for cases, make dinner, and go to bed. Lather, Rinse, Repeat. It kept him going… somewhere. And it kept him from thinking… things.
Wow. Okay. Dean totally had a type.
“I tried
“Wait—” Dean roughly grabbed Cas by the arm. “The warding, that one, and that one,” he pointed.
“What, do you lot not do that?
“Oh, sure I didn’t, that’s why I’m screaming at you out here in the snow, right? That’s why Cas is worried, that’s why Jody is cornering me, that’s why Claire is in trouble, because I didn’t fuck anything up, right? Fuck off, Sam,” he spat. “Leave me the fuck alone.”
He sighed with the first burning drag and headed out into the library, where he encountered another source of that stress: Cas sitting at the far table.
And the warmth of that smile, the genuine, untempered affection— well his chest felt fit to burst from it, and a lopsided smirk crept up his own face.
*D’you hear that?* Direl whispered to Bris.
Bris followed a turn of her hips to face Sam, and winked. The chorus soared in around them.
She wrapped her arms around his waist, and looked up into his face. “We did it, Sam! We really did it! We killed her! That witch's torn to shreds!”
“You’re social beings. You pack-bond,” Cas continued. “Angels… don’t.”
In a flash Bris was advancing on him, stepping right around Sam’s outstretched arm and the bags on the floor, her angel blade gripped tight in her hand.
"Hah!
And she vanished, leaving Sam on his own again.
Sam tensed, a muscle twitching in his neck as he tried to form an answer. "We might," he finally said. "We might need him."
Cas perked up at her interest. “You can also tell that this creature typically eats larger prey that it has to keep a hold of, with the way the teeth curve back.”
Cas didn't answer right away. “I wasn't...
But Gabriel’s attention was quickly drawn back forward, and when Direl followed his gaze, he finally saw the scene playing out before him.
They fell asleep to the sound of typing and clicking, softly filling the darkened room.

“I will help you, Jess,” Sam promised. “I will save you.”
“Send all those assholes back to us! Make
Somehow they made it to the last row of hills. The demons were swarming the hole in the fence. Dean and someone else, maybe Ballo, were just barely holding them off. The selkies seemed to all be gone. Everyone was out but them and the three of them were almost there—
Dean fired his gun and Cas leapt at her, blade raised high.
“Alright, alright, don’t get yer undies in a twist,” Bobby conceded. “Let’s go check it out, then.”
Now in the empty room, he was trying to be as efficient as possible, but the two of them kept messing up which way the fitted sheet went on the mattress. They worked in a thick silence until Eileen spoke up.
He was pulled from his stream of thought when Cas began to fidget next to him.
Boy, Cas, you should have seen his face when I told him he was an uncle. Really, I’m pretty sure he’ll come around.”
It took a second longer, but Castiel brightened, too. “That battle raged for
Dean turned around, but saw no one. “Umm…”
Sam shrank an inch. “Where, um, where are you from then?”
Later that same night, all their preparations finally came together.
“Well, seems to me we ought to figure what caused all this in the first place,” said Bris.
She turned to Sam, eyes dropping to his chest as her lips parted.
Sam and Dean stared at the vial.
Rowena gave a short sigh to the ceiling, "Fine," and resignedly raised her hands to begin.
I'm made of stone,
“From the Angel Tablet?” Castiel asked. He looked back down at Sam’s frantically scratched handwriting, “What do we need.”
Before Bris could answer, Sam turned the corner from the hallway that led down to the storeroom, holding a small wooden box and fiddling with a set of keys. “Alright, Cas, I got it, let’s go.”
He returned the hug, holding her only as tight as she held him. Tentatively, ready for any sign of discomfort, he raised his hand, and stroked her long, rippling hair. “Goodbye, Bris.”
8/21/18 Update: 60k, 3/4 done. I'm writing a freaking novel. XD This series is Harry-Potter-ing, y'all.
And found Cas.
“Oi, now!" came a voice approaching from the crowd. "Make some room in that there moss, this watermelon needs ta sit!”
“Are they after
“What? No! Cas!” Dean shot forward and grabbed the sleeve of Cas’s coat. Castiel stopped, but he only turned back halfway, and he still wouldn't look up from the floor.
Bris’s eyes darted between Castiel’s, her breaths coming sharp. “I know that now, but what were I s’posed to do then? Leave Sam fer
“Oh, quit whining," Crowley rolled his eyes as he stood, "we both know you always loved it when I made you grovel.”
"This is…" His frown cut deeper. "Dean, this might go down to his soul. Everything is— There's so
Br— Broke?
“Whole.”
“Goddamn it,” grumbled Dean.
Cas finally shot out and grabbed Sam's shoulders.
But wait! There's more! Don't miss the bonus scenes and art in the next chapters! :)
“We only know where to find him, Cas, not how to gank him. This is the best bet we have—”
Would telling you
“Hey-hey-hey!” Jody snatched his wrist, “Don’t touch the crime scene! I have to call this in!”
Sam’s heart dropped, the phone landing on his leg. “Have I not told you about Jack?”
“Yeah, you know, gotta be able to take care of your woman and all that.” Dean gestured vaguely with his hand. “If you couldn’t keep her happy, then you failed.”
Sam slumped into his seat. “No,” he answered. “Let’s just get out to the chapter house.”
Her heart swelled at that, how could it not? God, what she’d give to throw her arms around him and—
“Dean, you don't even know what you’re agreeing to,” Sam huffed. “You can’t understand what an archangel will—”
"Yeah."
And it was over in a blink. Cas went back to his seat.
I do, Sam,” she said with exasperation, “or didja forget which one a’ us has been married more’n a few times over?”
Sam flinched back. Dean's eyes were already ringed in red and his snarl was marred by a trembling lip.
Sam rushed out into the hall. “Guys?” he shouted, “Anyone know where Dean is?”
Then she sighed, and looked down her nose with clear disdain. “You always were my most difficult case.”
“Would still have been taken, as was her fate, murdered in your home by a demon in disguise. A
And the more he gave in to that nagging guilt to make it clear that he cared, the more he found that things improved. It wasn’t that he had forgiven himself, he would probably never forgive himself for how he had hurt the others so badly, but he could see it on everyone’s faces— and even better, in their words— their appreciation for these gestures.
“Come on!” Sam snatched Dean’s sweatpants off the end of the bed and threw them at him. “Seriously, get some pants on and get out here!”
“Would you
Gabriel turned to shoot him a glare. “Yeah. No thanks to you.”
Sam turned, and found Gabriel looking up at him sternly.
“An’ ‘e
“Which time?” Sam and Dean said together.
The next morning, after a crowd of criss-crossing goodbyes and promises to
“Don’t call me that,” Sam said curtly. “And no, I wouldn’t.”
“Come on, Rowena, you’re not exactly a shining example of a role-model.”
or anything!”
“The Avett Brothers,” Dean proclaimed. “Y’know how Cas’s inta this folk-y kinda stuff—
Naomi tipped her head slightly to one side. “Do you,” she asked.
“...that none of us cared about him at all.”
Dean drew back far enough to search his eyes. Wet tracks cut down Cas’s face.
“Cas—
~*~*~*~*~
Here!”
Another one came running down the hall to him.
Dean would take his apology.
“Fine,” Dean stepped up into his space, “Why do you have a soft spot for Rowena?”
“Oh,” Claire said thoughtfully. “Huh.”
“Yeah, of course! Here, give me your phone.”
Alright then.” Dean picked up the demon's oddly large gun from where it was currently clipped to Dean's belt. He waved it at the demon, “Why were you at that beach with a net gun?”
“Really weird lately?”
Then Gabriel carefully stepped forward, nudging at Ketch with his toe. “So. We’re back to square one,” he stated.
and you didn’t

“No, Cas, we don't— We
cut in Castiel.
“He kinda loved her, Dean,” she said with half a shrug.
“Yup,” Dean agreed.
“I— What?”
Sam sighed even as a small warmth pulled at his chest. What had he ever done to deserve her?
Then things go haywire, Dean is being thrown, rapid-fire, from memory to memory. He’s stabbing that woman in the neck, he’s threatening Kevin, he doesn’t believe Naomi, he doesn’t stay to help Dean with Sam in the church, he’s strapped to a chair and Metatron is slicing his throat, he’s back on Earth, and above him, all above him is fire, fire streaking down from the clouds because hundreds, thousands of angels are falling, and burning, and taking humans for vessels—
Inas continued to rub her back, now moving in gentle circles... up and down... and up and down... With every pass she found herself letting go just a little bit more and soon she was almost lost in it, the soothing sensation of a loving hand. She sighed, deep and long, marveling at how such a small thing could help so much.
Cas shrugged. “I might as well ask you why you don’t Harmonize your innate being with your brothers and sisters. It’s just not something you do.”
Charlie places a kiss on Dean's forehead and gives him a big hug, then she hurries out as quickly as she can while Cas gives Dean a hand getting up out of his chair. It’s a bit of an ordeal, and Dean uses a cane to leverage himself up, but they make it, and they both shuffle down the hallway to the bedrooms.
“Heaven is not my home,” he said.
Without a word, Sam strode across the room, straight to the shelves. He frantically yanked books out, throwing them on— or at least near— the table, and when he turned to his pile he wasn’t much better, opening one to scan it for a second only to slam it shut, throw it aside, and snatch up another. Dean kept his eyes on his movie, able to ignore him, until Cas entered.
“I don’t like ‘somewhere thereabouts’.”
“I’m not saying he shouldn’t be picking that up, it's beyond shitty that he doesn't, but ‘stop’ is pretty unequivocal.”
Behind them at the trunk, Cas approached Dean cautiously. Dean didn’t look up from the pistol he was loading.
His current song faded out and the radio offered up the next one. Right from the first jangling chord, though, Dean didn’t bother to hold back a groan.
Why not?
yes to Michael, he
He scrambled to sit up, more boxes falling around him.
But Dean just glared back at him. “I don’t
Dean stopped on the path and shut his eyes. A few more long, deep breaths. and he was starting to feel like he might be calm enough to return to the car. Calm enough to suck it up, go back, and never let that happen again.
Not when it
“I think you’re overestimating them.”
“I—” Dean started. He swallowed. “I believe you, Cas. I’m sorry.”
With Dean's honest reaction, Ballo finally seemed to relax. Though he blade did stay in his hand. With a final uneasy look at Cas, he looked around at the wide, empty field. “We needs to move," he said, "They might be followin' us.”
He returned his gaze to the papers spread all around him. “Didn’t think you would still be around,” he said.
Sam flinched, but he steeled himself and knocked his required answer sideways. “Well Dean's always been a huge romantic, so...”
Sebhin pushed, a shout held back by gritted teeth. Something popped in Bris's hand.
Jody’s face creased with concern.
And Tom Petty was really dead.
This was crazy. This had to be a mistake. Everybody thinks about Doc Holliday like that, right?
“Alright, so we need to move,” he said, addressing the rest of the group. “Anybody feel anything else?”
Dean tried to smirk through his pained grimace. “Shit, Cas, you believed some demon’s bullshit?”
Direl ticked back in surprise before narrowing his eyes. “Fine,” he conceded. He crossed his arms and looked down at Gabriel, “But what’s that crap about not playin’ my game? I can see clear as day you’re not picky in the slightest,” he gestured at Gabriel's chest.
“Shit, I'm sorry, Cas! ...Shit. Here, I'll go bring him back over—”

Cas looked to Bris again. So Sam had even discussed what kind of angel he was with her. He could only conclude that Sam trusted her immensely.

“I need
Another breath.
And Sam just watched. Just watched his older brother march back to them and stand off to the side, just watched Cas try to stand a little closer to him, and just watched Dean tense and step back from him.
Dean turned a glare on them, jaw clenched, a slow resentment rising like tidewater. So Sam hadn’t wanted to talk to him because… what? Those two could chat about their serious shit like it was nothing but… but Dean couldn’t handle it? Dean was just fine? Moved past his shit?
Sam scanned the inside for Bris. Most of the cage was water, and thus most of the selkies were currently in their seal skins. Only a few were squeezed against the bars where there was enough room to stand as a human.
Eileen:
“It can’t,” says Jack, and the hope rushes out of Dean. He shuts his eyes and drops his head, letting his hand fall against his thigh.
“Bris, I—”
Bris fell silent, her hands in fists at her sides.
“But… you’re a history buff now?”
Mrs. Ike took a deep breath, reaching out to take her husband’s hand. “We... We were just enjoying a day out at the Preserve. Justin, our younger son, he loved the woods, wanted to be out there all the time. Wouldn’t have ever come home if I didn’t... didn't make him...” She swallowed hard, her voice already strained.
The gas station wasn’t busy, maybe two other cars sitting at the other pumps. Not that Dean noticed them.
“You're saying it wrong,” Cas stated. "It's the Chain-o'-Lakes.”
"Taken care of
“It’s okay, Dean.”
I was trying to help you the same as everyone else.”
They separated and headed east between the hills.

Bris glanced down to his chest, hoping yet again that she might see anything of his heart. But just as he had for the past week, he was keeping it turned away from her.
wrong, a particularly confusing article on the internet, updates on Gabriel, random-ass facts that Dean didn’t even know what had prompted him to share...
Her face fell.
He did his best to hide his flinch. “Hey, you started it,” he said, and dropped a quick kiss to her temple.
Behind him, Sam heard Bris slap her forehead with her palm.
“You didn’t!”
Until the lights cut out, and they were painted in the glare of flashing red lights.
“Besides,” Gabriel went on, “I can
He hunched, and felt his discomfort wrap around him like a second jacket, sitting right there on the surface for everyone to see.
~*~*~*~
Bris entered the library, dropping a duffel bag into the pile that was already gathered at the end of the long tables. It landed with a thud, filled mostly with things like food and water filters, knives and extra ammo. Belatedly she realized it was the most she’d ever carried on a long trip. Usually she traveled by sea, usually alone.
Bris cut him off, pulling him down by the shirt for a kiss; small, almost chaste.
“It, um, must have been hard, being there.”
Dean gave a small shrug, “I dunno, my whole life basically?”
to the Apocalypse Dimension, of course, but they also needed to get back.
Dean bit his cheek in an effort to control his smirk. He utterly failed. “We should have gotten you that thing years ago.”

Rowena burst, utterly appalled. "You've had that blood in you your whole life and you were never treated?"
Rowena entered the throne room, ready to initiate her plan. Her loyal followers were prepared, backup was in place if necessary, and all that was left to do was to get on with it.

He lowered his gun.
He could almost feel the necklace sigh at him. It was terribly disconcerting.

It picked up on the second ring.

Dean clenched his fists. “Why the

Sam hummed short in acknowledgement.
It was heart-shaped.
“What!” Gabriel bursts.
Rowena nodded slowly.
Sam jumped from it. “So—! You, um… you got this from here?” He gestured at the bed. “I-I just mean— I better, um— Yeah— Over there—” he bumbled, bumping into the doorframe as he barely managed to leave.
“We, um, we need to talk,” Sam answered. “About what we’re doing here.”

Eileen:
Cas sat up straighter. “Oh, no, definitely not. There’s been nothing over the radio,” he tossed a hand near his head.
Dean's response fell like a rock to the floor.
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “You are no angel.”
Sam continued, “If you’ve met Jack, I suspect you know what’s up with him, too—”
“Nah,” Sam said easily, “I mean, it might take a while, but we’re talking about

“I know you said… You just seem so upset that I’m here.”
Sam shook his head. “What are you talking about?” he asked, still recovering from his whiplash.
"Thank you," he said.
Sam paused, blinking at that. *Wow,* he breathed. “I’ve

The authoritative tone seemed to be what Direl needed. They heard him take a few harried breaths,

“Then perhaps we should to focus on this one,” Cas accidentally interrupted. “If we can’t fight this Other Michael, maybe we can control ours.”
“Shit, dude, I meant— that’s great! I mean—” Sam leaned forward again. “Shit, Dean, I thought you were going to tell me somebody died, o-or you were leaving or— something.”
Sam lowered the phone, staring at it, frozen in place.
“But now you don’t know what’s right and what’s wrong.” Gabriel looked at her over his cup. “Nothing makes sense anymore.”

he could get at least a smile from her by singing along:
“Stop,” Mary held up a hand. She helped Kevin from the floor. “What are you doing here? Why were you left behind?”
“We've eliminated many options from the lack of clues,” Cas offered.

“Nope.”

“Oh, okay. Yeah, okay, go ahead.”

“What? You’ll kill us?” Gabriel deadpans.
No, Cas wasn’t crazy. Cas was a lot of things, but he hadn’t been crazy in years.
he shouted again, “Cas!
“Wha— No! Why would I—”
Castiel slumped in his seat, all the fight seeming to have gone out of him at once. He stood from his stool and crossed the room to the other kitchen door that led to the back hallways, leaving without another word.
Dean and Cas followed him with Direl in tow.
Dean stopped. He listened. “H-hear what?”
Sam shut his eyes and tipped his head, his mouth hanging open a moment before he could answer. “Well maybe he just
“You’re a terrible nag, you know that—?”
Bris and Cas looked up from their conversation as he passed them. If one of them said something, Dean didn’t hear it, he went right to his room and locked the door.
“What?”
The warmth he'd been fighting flipped to a chill. Cas lifted his chin and tilted his head, “Why?”
Cas looked him up and down. “You didn’t sleep well.”
choices and actions saved them once and for all, Sam. Never forget that.” She dipped her head in a deferential bow. “I am forever grateful to you.”
Dean grimaced without it. “Shit, sorry. I'll find something else—”
“Here, lass!” Ballo rushed to them.
She took her son with an arm around his shoulders, and guided him out of the throne room.
Sam raised an eyebrow.
Huh. Can angels blush? “Come on, Dean, you should go to bed—”
Things were falling away and things were opening— The kitchen was fading and the darkness was edging in—
Dean sighed again. “What else?” he said, squeezing Cas's shoulder.
“Thank you fer helpin' us,” Bris addressed the three of them.

“Just describe it, Bris, it's okay, it's gonna be okay, we’ll find you.”

“I’m sorry—”
Dean cracked his eyes open, looking up from his place on the ground. He lowered his hands from his ears. They’d probably be ringing for days, but he couldn’t care.
“What the fuck was in those drinks last night?”
or-or
“Do you think…”
“Cas!” Dean charged into the fray. Direl wasn’t far behind with a ridiculous battle cry.
His hands went flying, jumpy and rushed, signing what he refused to say out loud.
enough to slow it down while Bris took advantage of the opening. She ran it through, and the angel dropped dead.
“This’ll all be over soon,” she said, placing a hand on his arm, “this’ll all be over, an’ he’ll be home, an’ we can all move on from this.”

Instead she paced in the map room. Back and forth... Back and forth… Back and forth... Begging that the door above her would open, pleading to a God she no longer believed was even there.

difficult.”
“Gonna have to get up early tomorrow,” Dean says. “Sam is sendin’ some curse researchers over who want a look at the library and chat with you, gonna whip up a big lunch for all of you.”
His indignation must have been too much even for Direl, because Direl asked to be let out at the first bar they passed. “Don’t know nothin’ about guns anyhow, don’t need to keep me around fer this,” he said, and practically jumped out of the car.
She recoiled from him, one palm raised and the other laid over her heart.

As Dean popped the top from his most recent bottle, Cas came to join him in the kitchen.
Dean flinched. “I owed him a favor.”
Bris turned to him, sympathy in her eyes, “Don’t understand what, love?”
“What? Wait! Can’t you just unlock it? Work at it?”
“You are truly Lost, aren’t you?”
“I know.”
The early December winds whipped at the sides of the car as they flew down the road, Dean asking Baby for all she had.
Hey, yeh gotta slow down, love.” She stepped around a toppled chair. “Please, Sam, slow down fer me; breathe slow fer me, alright?”
“Fine,” he said. And he turned around to get his own laptop.
But besides that, you know what else is fun? I kinda hope this isn’t how shit goes down in canon. Now, I love the idea of Dean Doesn’t Know enough that I’m writing tens of thousands of words on it, but in canon, a big part of me hopes that it’s just kind of… there. The bisexual thing and the Cas thing. Not a big huge reveal, or a big dramatic moment of realization, just a “yeah… that’s how it is.”
Actually, you know what? Sam had gotten his fun earlier. It was Cas’s turn.
Sam chuffed through a smile. “Alright, so I’m not ‘the Hunter’ anymore?”
until he couldn’t feel the turn of his stomach, the clench in his chest—
Behind them, there was another flash and another thump of feet hitting the ground.
There was nothing
Sam sighed. All he wanted was to ask her if she was okay. But he already knew the answer, so he didn’t. Instead, he just stood from the bed, and slipped on yesterday's pants.
Before Dean could snap back at her, Cas stepped right next to him and glared at her.
“Direl, behind you!” another selkie shrieked.
“An’ again, how would
“But you didn’t, Cas,” our current Dean says under his breath. “Dammit, Cas, you made me lose you anyway.”
Sam's smile gets even wider. He texts back:
Asmodeus returned to his throne, and folded his hands in his lap.
“So I’m done.”
She breathed in through her nose, slow and deep, letting her eyes fall shut. Then she nodded, stretched her legs out in front of herself, and lifted her own cup to take a sip from her drink. She pulled a face at it, and swirled the translucent liquid in her hand as she swallowed it down.
Castiel picked up his blade and stepped out of the crater, facing the house.
Direl shrugged, “Gots me. I block most a’ that out.”

“Right. You gonna… do that?”
“Not a single one. Angels are many things, but they take care of their toys after death.” She smirked up at him. “Recent generations excepted, of course.”

His hand snatched through the empty air, and when he opened it between them Dean's pocket was empty and the Rings of the Four Horsemen sat in his palm.
Sam's mouth worked with possible responses, but in the end, he just scrunched up his face and turned forward in his seat.
You each try to take the blame for every errant happenstance onto yourselves in order to avoid dolloping it on anyone else—
As they caught their breath, the woman placed a hand on his arm,
a lie… right?
Sam stepped right up to Direl, grabbed his face in his hands, and planted a kiss straight onto his forehead.
Cas tipped his head as he considered that. “Well I have been wanting to listen to this,” he said as he dug in a pocket on the inside of his jacket. His hand emerged with a black cassette tape, and he handed it to Sam.
Sandy screeched. “You miserable cretins! Glythur will find me! I will escape these bonds and reunite with my love! We
Dean recoiled. “What?”
As everyone else did their best to finish off the bottle of whiskey they had brought, Cas found himself in the corner with Claire, filling in a new page in her journal for the Mokele-Mbembe.
Dean is seated in one of the comfy chairs in the library. Charlie is in the one beside him, reading the last chapter of

“So...
Dean rolled back over onto his back to see Cas rubbing his stomach.
He appeared next to Sam and Bris again, “I mean, yeah, let’s talk about these two turtle doves! Isn’t it amazing that they found each other? They’re so lucky, to be in the same place, at the same time, with so many conditions met that they could actually hit it off! How many things had to happen just right for this cutie-patootie to find that firebrand in the first place? How many things had to go right so they could realize just how well they happen to fit together? And now they’ve got it, but are they gonna keep it? Tune in next week, ‘cause this shindig ain’t over at the big kiss! There’s no guarantee. There’s no card that says ‘Go directly to soulmate, do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred smooches.’ This is all on them, and
“Well,
He ran forward and flopped down on it. “My stars, an' it’s fantastic!”
“Well then what the hell is he doing?”
He dropped his angel blade from his sleeve and opened the door a crack. Something heavy moved with the door.
Bris glanced at Sam, silently asking his consent.
long, drawn-out realization.
“You know, your eyes ain’t half bad either,” Dean said.
Sam sighed. “Then we have to get down to that park, down to Quitaque.”
Sam tipped his head, “Our souls...?”
“I’m—” Cas caught himself, “I'll try to stop doing that.”
It’d been a while since he'd watched this one, but… Had this movie always been so… gay?
He rolled over— or was he pushed— and his vision blurred even worse as he landed on the hard floor. Now he was looking at some stairs that led down to somewhere.
~*~*~*~
Her chiding expression slipped a fraction. “You are in no position to be making demands, angel.”
She spun, stepping back before he could try to grab her. “No! I don’ wanna hear it, Sam! Go back to yer new floozie an’ leave me in peace, damn it!”
“Sam?”
A woman reached their gap and Cas leapt out at her.
“Would you cut that!” Bris stood from her own bench.
Cas gave him another little smile in return and settled back to enjoy to music. Freakin’ master of comfortable silences...

Cas gave a tiny nod. “I did.”

A trickle of anger entered his stream of horror, “No! I
Cas found himself easily soothed by the song at hand. It was fairly straightforward in its lyrics and the sound was smooth, the singer crooning to him over simple instrumentation.

Bris pulled back, just a fraction, just far enough to speak, and her breath was soothingly hot on his lips.
“How you feelin’?”
“Yeah.” Dean reached out, too. Slowly, with no surprises. He reached out, and took Cas’s outstretched hand in his. Cas tensed with the touch. Dean ran his thumb over Cas's knuckles, trying to soothe that tension away.
Her soft inhale drew Cas’s attention from the stove. Bris’s shoulders dropped as she covered her mouth and shook her head, “Oh,

Cas furrowed his brow at the floor.

“Lord above,” she rolled her eyes high with a smile as they left the kitchen together, “what kinda shit have I gotten myself into?”
“Lucifer?” Cas’s eyes went wide.
He’d just complain that there were no bodies—”
“My Lord, shall you be holding court soon?” it asked in a clipped, official tone. “There are many matters awaiting your attention.”
Dean looked over to Cas in surprise. He was holding himself so stiffly he was shaking.
*Already did,* Sam mumbled.
Dean leaned heavily against Cas, “Wha’s even goin' on right now?”
“Hey, those jackalopes solved your case, didn’t they?”
But then, just as Dean was about to give the signal to attack, a man materialized some twenty feet away from the creatures, wielding an oddly large gun.

“Why… um… why do you like my music so much, man? I know Zeppelin gets your gears goin’ but that's just one band, you like all my shit.” And maybe it was the booze, or maybe just that earlier smile, but Dean also added, “You don't do this with Sam's eighties-soundin’ crap, or Claire's weird techno stuff, or that jazz-rock that Bris listens to. What’s so special about my shit?”
But their hold on him was sure, and he couldn’t struggle free. Mary’s expression toward the boy was soft even as he continued to scream, to beg for them to let him go. She looked up to Jack.
"Aye, yes, but what about what
Yokoth struggled against the chains, “Wait! No! Glythur, my love, please help!
Dean was already pulling his own phone out.
Dean cleared his throat. “Hey, Crowley.
Sam’s spell wasn’t working.
So awful he could almost understand why Gabriel had taken off.
Castiel stammered for a moment. “But— since Lucifer—”
She didn’t say anything as they began to move through the woods together.
“No!” Castiel lunged out at nothing, nearly falling forward if not for Gabriel and Direl catching him. “No!
something like that and not follow it up with either some goddamn clarification or the motherfucking kiss of a lifetime.
” he kissed Dean’s chest, “
Gabriel came out from behind Direl, looking up at something on Sam's face. He reached out to it and Sam leaned down to him, to make it easier.
“I was—" Sam cleared his throat. "We were just waiting on you.” He took the supplies in hand and he and Bris stepped over to the shore to set up the bait, leaning into each other's space as they drenched the meat in the virgin's blood.
“Or many creatures. So far we’ve been dealing with groups of monsters,” Cas noted.

"I don't under—”

“Bris.”
“Please, Bris,” an aunt tried, “you knows we only wants to help. Please, talk to us,
“Go on and try to break a deal with me, Moose, let’s see what happens,” Crowley shot at Sam.
“You will not! You can not! He is
But reality rushed in again, dousing his flickers of hope. He glanced away from Chuck, his nose wrinkling.
The door flew open and there were hands, grabbing and dragging—
“Ah, My ever-inquisitive son,” said Fate with fondness. “The answer is yes. And no. My Sisters and I did use the aftermath of My storm to send Dean to Bris, nudging Bris to hide her coat in those particular woods, nudging Dean to find it. But it was Dean’s choice to pick up the coat, and it was also his choice not to accept Bris’s offer. After that, we had no hand in your dealings. It was
Dean turns and sees the angel Naomi beside him, watching him. He looks back out, at the sea of dead Deans.
Gabriel shouted, and locked Cas’s feet to the ground.
Sam shouted.
“No. No, he was fine,” Dean said through his gritting teeth. “He was
“Yeah, people kind of have a thing for giving drinks crazy names. Sex on the Beach, Purple Nurples, Tequila Sunrise…”
He had looked back down at Cas. There was a streak of fresh blood spread across his front.
Crowley hissed, "did you
"What?" asked Sam.
He had to get better.
Bris and Direl didn’t seem to register the insults being sent their way, too busy frowning at Gabriel. Direl shook his head, “So ye don’t… do… relationships?”
“Well maybe if you hadn’t taken so bloody long getting the wood—!”
he bellowed. He hauled Sam up, stepped up to the edge, and with the slightest hesitation, he leapt into the river.
Okay, so that plan was a bust.
Having reached the morgue, the coroner led them to the wall of little silver doors and opened a drawer holding a middle-aged white man. Just like the other victims mentioned in the newspapers, his nose and ears were missing. He was also extremely pale, even for a corpse.
By the third hour he
Bris snatched her coat back, holding it close.
Castiel stared at the floor.
~*~*~*~
don't worry about it, Cas, it ain't your mess.”
“And this,” she gestured to the body currently being photographed, “is one Alan Renny, the owner of the marina. His wife reported him missing about three hours ago and this was the first place we checked.” She shook her head, “I want to say it was a drug deal gone wrong or something, on account of the knife wound, but with the empty boat I’m inclined to connect it to the disappearances.”
Cas stood and went to retrieve his blade from the monster’s skull, leaving Dean to just blink after him.
“Looks like he hurt a friend pretty bad. An’ you seem to be the only one what won’t even look at him.”
“I told you he don’t need me—”
Cas spoke up, “Sam you're in no condition to—”
“Who the hell are you?” a voice shouted from behind them.
“I did. There were some terrible floodin’ those few weeks ago, an absolute Godsend. The river came right up to us an' the ponds all done overflowed. Our pond— a tree came an' smashed the bars to drobes an' we was able to get out through the hole.”
Who’s ready for a Season Finale!? :D
And she hung up.
Keep pushin' up higher, higher,
“Me? Uh— I’m…” The words came slowly. “I’m... overwhelmed. And... scared.”
“No, Cas, the way he
“Now I know you just reamed out my brother for this,” he said cautiously, “but if I give this back, would you stick around so we can ask you some questions? You're the best lead we’ve had in days to try and figure out what's hurting people around here.”
They picked up Direl from the bar about an hour before sunrise, the trunk now brimming with supplies. Fortunately, he’d had the sense not to get completely wasted—
~*~*~*~*~
He ripped open his jacket and his shirt, revealing a sigil carved into his chest. Everyone leapt back from him as Jack moved forward, arms spread in front of everyone.
“Hey,” Sam nudged him, “maybe you should get out there, too.”
“Right,” Sam chuffed. “Right, yeah. Okay, everybody got their passport?”
Sam leaned down to kiss her forehead, rubbing his thumb across her cheek.
“Right.” “Yeah.” Sam and Dean faltered, staring at their feet.
First things first:
have been a smile.
Blue light streamed from the gaping hole where a door used to be. Their ears began to fill with a whining hum.
If anything she ran faster.
Sam looked back down at his compass. “I’m fine.”
Crowley narrowed his eyes at Dean. “What? What's giving you pause? Is it this spell you’re after? I’ll get you every piece you need, enough supplies to open a
“Cas…” says the bloodied Dean, “This isn’t you. This isn’t you.”
Sam froze.
“I told you, it’s
"What? Oh. Right, ah..." She opened the cut in her jacket sleeve and peeked at the wound. “Wha-! Aw,
think you was gonna affect what’s pro’ly years of unrequited love in an evenin’? You ought to know better than that.”
And Cas’s head tilted with one of his little half-smiles— the one where his teeth peeked through, the one Dean didn’t get to see very often— and completely inappropriate for the moment, but barging in anyway, the damned butterflies
Cas had insisted he would be fine on his own, and Ballo was apparently not taking no for an answer, so Dean found himself walking up the path through the preserve with the tall, brawny selkie.
“Ye gotta get us down there!” Bris cried at Gabriel, whirling to him from the spot that Sam had just vanished from.
“We’ll talk about it more in the morning," Sam answered, "come on, there’s plenty of spare rooms.”
depends on the context. Geez, this language is so friggin’ dramatic.”
Dean frowned at the hand. “Why?”
Gabriel looked up from his drink.
“It seems as though that necklace is aiding your communication with Sam.”
Baradiel still frowned, but this appeared to soothe some of their suspicions. “We are southeast of the centerpoint of the North American continent. The latest humans who lived here insisted on calling the area ‘Wisconsin’.”
Dean winced over his cup. “I didn’t throw it away, Cas, it’s just in my bag.”
when you’re gone. You leave or you disappear or get taken and I’ve got
She looked at him for a heavy moment.
“Maybe we can help,” said Sam.
“You should leave, Bris.”
“You’re not.”
Cas was leaving.
Direl burst. He all but collapsed against a tree, reaching down to rub at his legs. “Are we takin’ a break?
“What?”
“I’m sure I’ll enjoy it just the same,” Bris smiled, holding Sam's gaze.
“Yeah, so you took her out to pick up chicks, real mature.”
When had green become his favorite?
Unfortunately, once they started digging, they quickly realized that the lore... wasn’t going to be very helpful here.
Crowley snorts.
'Cause, I've been waitin',
No! Just shut up!
“Hey, Cas, how far would the protection you put on the river have spread?” Sam asked Cas, standing nearby.

Sam covered the fact that he tripped over his own feet by turning around. Focusing on the demon, and
Bris smiled. Cas was going to do just fine.
“I’m sure you are, Sam,” she said placatingly. “But it means nothing now, doesn’t it?”
Castiel’s free hand shot out to her forehead and suddenly the world was squeezing too tight, her arm wouldn’t swing, her lungs wouldn’t breathe—
“Dean—!” Cas tried, taking a step to follow, but Sam put a hand on Cas’s shoulder.
needs?"
“What does that mean?” Jack asked.
That smile returned now to Chuck’s face, somehow even more elated than before.
“Go where?” Bris asked.
As Castiel watched, he came to realize the angels were making attempts on Direl... but not on Gabriel.
“No,” Sam had to answer.
“I’m—” Dean headed him off. Whatever he was going to say, it was gonna be something all
Bris rolled her eyes at him, dropping her voice a little. *Your boy there, is he sweet on your brother?*
Dean and Cas both looked out at the water and back to Sam.
Dean is in the kitchen, dressed in his full flannel and jeans. We see him pace a bit, see him shift on his feet. Then he huffs a breath, shakes himself out, and closes his eyes in prayer.
He frowned.
“Geez! Sorry guys!" Sam fell into his seat and clunked three beers on the table. "The line was just

She pulled back to look him in the eye.
Dean jerked a thumb over his shoulder at Cas’s retreating back. “Well I am, so… later?”
How am I supposed to do this without you?
the empty place in yer heart—”
~*~*~*~
Cas's hand was was fast on his arm. “Have patience, Dean.”
"They don't!" Sam answered. Another bullet whizzed past.
She burst out into the evening and the cold slammed into her, snapping her back a good few notches from right plastered. Fat lot of good it did her though— she stopped at the sidewalk outside the bar, head swimming with drink, flipping back and forth at the road, not knowing where the fuck she was gonna go. She had to decide quick, but just— but—
said you were in Italy on some big important mission.”
“What?” Sam shouted at who he was guessing was Bris.
...Almost nothing.
“We been talkin’, I’ll explain in a bit.” She ripped his shirts off over his head, in such a hurry she left one sleeve dangling from his wrist. “I
She reached out to his face, slowly, trembling. Her motion was agonizingly restrained, ready to snatch her hand back in a blink. As if everything else hadn’t already crushed it, this alone bloke Sam’s heart.
Sam heart broke at the disappointment already building in Cas’s eyes. “The car is gone, Cas.”

Something clenched in Dean's chest. "Hey, I— Sam, I didn't—"
She couldn’t answer for a moment. Her hand twitched toward her drink, untouched since they arrived. “Sam, even if... Even if..." She shook her head. "You don't need me, Sam."
than my Brother. Is this coming out simple enough for you?”
“Fine. We’ll all have one of these anyway. Kills demons. Regular knives don’t, so don’t bother.”
*Shit, sorry,* Sam whispered under his breath, and he crouched down in front of Gabriel.
had been in the bunker...
“Look— Cas—” Dean turned to him, “What are you doing?"
“Oh, believe me, I’m well aware of the kinds of consequences you deliver. There are no Winchesters in Hell.”
Sam asked him something.
*Demons,* she hissed. She leaned around the corner of the car to listen further.
Sometimes.
Crowley, however, gestured at the body of Baradiel, still crumpled on the ground at his feet. "When in Rome," he grinned, "why not bleed as the Romans do."
She nodded and rested her forehead against his. “Is this to do with that fight Rowena were talkin’ about before?” she asked him for a second time.
“Seven angels left in Heaven…
He tried to come back from it, tried to come back so he could find his gun— he needed his gun— but he couldn’t even see for how much it hurt, he couldn’t move, he couldn’t hear—

Eileen took a step forward, “No, Sam, you can’t—”
Dean held up one of his hands and examined it, flexing it.
"—I see what this is.”
“I can tell.” Sam raised an eyebrow.
“No! I’ve

and you can’t have it, Dean! Besides, it’s sexy.” Sam's eyes widened at his statement.
Bris pulled out the bowl of apple slices and cheese cubes, removing the saran wrap someone had placed over it and plucking out a slightly browned piece of apple.
Sam hadn't laughed. Sam hadn't freaked out. Sam... almost didn’t
“He might not have left!” Sam repeated, beaming. “Cas, he might still be here! Well, i-in Heaven. But he might be

she amended,
“Yeah, see, if I remember correctly,
So Sam took a fortifying breath, and headed in Bris’s direction.
Cas smiled in response, just a lift in the corner of his lips, but Dean's heart still raced at it.
Ice flashed through his body. “No, wait, I—”
Cas narrowed his eyes. The brow ticked higher. “Why?”
Just him. He was the only one who couldn’t handle this.
Just then Dean rushed through the library, hurrying right past them without a word. But before Cas could ask what was wrong, he picked up a concerning smell following Dean.
“Heya, Cas!” Sam smiled. “What’re you doin’ in m’room? Bris's here, man, c’mon...”
Michael shifted Cas's body to face Dean fully. “I remember
Sam bit back his frustration. It wasn't the same at all. But that wasn't going to help right now. Not with Cas like... this.
Bris sighed as she bit her lip, looking down at him with heat in her eyes.
Jody nodded, wide-eyed. “Sure. Yeah. That clears things up.”

The anger drained from his eyes. “Not yet,” Cas sighed.
Cas snatched up a chair from the library table, planting it and himself right in front of Bris.
“Then what
Rowena hummed in understanding. “Magic used to be as common as any profession.
“Now, see, I

that had happened last night. No, of course not. He'd had to go and be a drunken ass at the door, too.
“Castiel, please, stop!” She forced her feet to move again and ran after him. “Please, I can’t lose you too! I can’t— Not all of you at once. I only just— We only just—”
He hoped she couldn’t hear his heart as well as she could see it.
Now Rowena shifted her gaze to Dean, a teasing smirk on her lips and a malicious glint in her eye, and she said to him:
“I don’t think so.”
Dean had moaned,
“No!” Dean’s fingers slipped as he tried to grasp Cas’s coat tighter, “No, Cas, please, just kick him out or something! Cas,
...would Michael even wait at all?
“No wonder you boys have so much trouble,” Rowena said.
Dean's whole body visibly relaxed, practically sagging with relief. "Okay," he said over a quiet exhale, "Fuck. Yeah. Okay..."
"Because you—" Dean rolled his eyes. “What, last night?” He eyed the logo again. “Where?”
Sam slowly lowered his phone from his ear, staring at it.
“I don’t give a flyin’
Castiel turned toward the noise, a hand raised, ready to smite them.
Sam and the necklace jumped in before Cas could,
Dean shot him a grateful smile and settled back in his seat.
Dean rolled his eyes, but damn it if he didn't cave and put half the strips on Sam’s plate. If Sam was fucked up enough to even ask, he probably needed it more that Dean did.
Cas turned his frown on the little speaker. He picked it up from where it had landed on its side and righted it. “This song has always confused me,” he said.
Sam smiled after her, then he looked up the manhole again. “You coming, Direl?”
"I've got about three just in my town, there," Donna jumped in. "Only trouble they get up to is growin' crazy-huge veggies and givin' that stinker Jenkins a hard time. Although, he brings it on himself, really."
He drew. Castiel barely winced. The sigil set into Castiel’s skin, and his shoulders slumped.
Dean turned around in his stool, scanning the bar. Looked like today was gonna be a ‘don't.’
“Today, Dean.”

Castiel’s eyes narrowed again. “

Castiel's entire body pulsed with looping flares of grace, and Crowley’s skin began to peel just being in his presence. How the angel's vessel hung on through this he hadn’t the faintest idea.

“What—” Lucifer stopped, searching the field. “What the— Now where did

He picked back up and Dean
“Cas… I don't think we have a—” He stopped. “Come on.”
His call went to voicemail. Again. He scoffed at his phone and dropped it to the table.
” he greeted him curtly.
“What? You got something to say Mr. Let’s-Play-Hookey-on-a-Case?”
So now, a week after the selkies had killed the witch, Sam was sitting at the kitchen island with Cas, holding the Seal in one hand and his second— and final— beer for the night in the other.
Crowley stood firm.
Lebanon, that would also explain the vague
"What? No!" She gripped his wrist tight. "No, I can, Sam, I can do it—"
As he lay in bed, he held Bris close to him, but even the comfort of her body against his, still sticky with the sweat of making good on her earlier promise, wasn’t enough to calm his churning mind.
"You're choosing— Did you not
Rowena turned to her, bemused, “What? This isn't his business.”
Meanwhile, Dean leaned against his door frame, watching him go with an amused look on his face.
“Oh Lord above,” Bris let her head knock back, “now time travel's a thing, too.”
What is that
“Well, alright, then," said Dean, already shutting the morgue drawer, "so— how do we find ‘em and how do we kill ‘em?”
“Oh, no! No, it’s just that I don’t keep hard liquor in the house anymore.
Her face darkened sharply, and before he could do anything else, she spun from him and stormed out of the room.
Keep pushin' up,
He’s only there because I—”
The world is an infinitely fascinating place, my friends.
“Oh my god,
When they separated, Sam looked down at the remaining pile of supplies and asked, “Hey, you want some help here?”
The selkies waved and shouted their goodbyes as they left, all but Ballo grinning widely.
He stared at the demon in front of him, praying, pleading,

Cas scanned the few people standing around outside, then he pointed, "There, at the side, there's two—"

Sam's expression softened with Direl’s panic. “Here.” He dug in his pocket and pulled out a flask.

Ketch tipped his head, taking a sip from the mug. “Didn’t I?” he said.
She pulled back, her hand still clutching his chin. The witch stared right into Sam's eyes as that washed over him, as the horror dawned on his face, and her own eyes fell heavy, and her tongue ran over her lip. “Oh,
There had to be another way to get back to normal.
“So we can send someone in?” says Dean.
“I see no reason why not,” they said with a sparkle in their eye.
Sam blinked, suddenly fighting a grin. “A talk?”
Claire leaned back, leveling him with a Look and crossing her arms. “He’s told me about Meg.”
“I shouldn’t have said anything. I should have followed the Rules and— and stayed away,” Castiel said. “I thought I could have this, I thought I could do this one thing, but everything I touch falls apart and I should have just held my tongue but I was

“So who the hell am I?” Crowley said, stopping once more, now standing between Asmodeus and the throne. “I’m Crowley, King of Hell, and I’m going to pick up where I left off...”
“Where did he fail? What did he do? The Angels started the Apocalypse, and he stopped it; Hell and Worse came to tear the World apart, and he stopped them; all manner of Spirit and Monster threatened the people of Your World and
Cas frowned. “I don't think so..." He patted his pockets.
So I know there was already SO much music in this chapter, but there’s one more song that I just couldn’t fit in:
Sam held his grin to the corner of his lips. “No, what he said to Inas. I’ve heard him say that before, but it isn't something you’ve taught me yet. ‘A tashka’?”
He turned back to her, holding out the branch, and in doing so caught sight of Bris’s split jacket sleeve where an angel had cut her.
"Aye, I remember. She said you was gonna help us get home. And ye are. And we're mighty grateful. But we both know that's not what this is about. And frankly I'm disappointed."
"Seriously, holler if you need anything. I'll freakin' bring you a warm glass of milk if you—"
I'm thinkin'
“Children,” Inas said.
There. Her eyes softened, though he could see she was wrestling against it. So he tried again.
“And provoke the ire of Jolly Green? I wasn’t reborn yesterday.”
Bris took Sam's hand, tugging on it with a knowing smile. “Oi. Come on down to the river, here," she said.
He turned back to Crowley and asked: “Hey. So what was with that cassette thing you gave me?”
No, he was going to have to suss this out for himself.
She continued to gape.
“I… Well…”
She raised an eyebrow. “Are they cool? Like, not a dick?”
Sam’s eyes flew wide, shining brightly white, and he slammed his Knife into the demon’s back. Asmodeus roared in fury, releasing his hold, and Sam dropped to the floor, scrambling forward on his one working arm. Cas surged to reach him, lifting Sam to his feet, pulling him behind him as they backed away. Dean kept his gun trained on Asmodeus, stepping up in front of Sam, up next to Cas.
Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Thanks for not saying something there.”
“What—? Wait. Explain—?” Dean shook his head and dropped his voice in return,
thinks yer just lookin’ at it wrong,” Bris offered Gabriel. “If these two finally go an’ get their heads outta their asses won’t that just make Cas wanna stay outta trouble all the more?”
“Right. The other night. Yeah, uh— Sorry.” Dean suppressed a wince of his own. “So we gonna go get it?”
“Yeah?” Sam grunted, not actually caring.
“Okay, alright! Just—!”
“Hey, Dean,” says Sam.
Now he just… understood.
"Guys—" Sam started, but was interrupted by the waiter that came to take their order.
He would talk about anything— everything— some old lore he had found that was
of something splitting open, a rush of air from one side of the library to the other, a great flash of light that momentarily blinded them all—

don’t you just let me help you?”
Dean stepped between them, facing Direl, "Calm down, man, we’ve all got the same goal here.”
“But… they’ve been gone for at least a year now.”
Sam slipped the necklace off, and Dean clearly heard him tell Bris that he loved her.
She told herself he was just saying it— Even though he'd been there. Even though he knew exactly what that meant. He had to be just saying it. Like he 'just said' he wanted to make her happy. 'Just said’ he wanted to make her smile. 'Just said' he wanted

Sam rested his cheek on her head and waved a finger at the phone again, moving it back and forth, twirling it in slow, lazy circles.
Cas returned to his search, putting that far from his mind.
“You were working for the
“Kill them all,” Crowley spat.
Castiel stared blankly, his eyes drifting down to his empty hands.
Castiel looked down at the speaker again, still clutched in his hand. “So this past decade of torture—”

“Guys!” Sam shouted, coming up to stand between them.
“Well, I'm thinkin'... Have you got any a’ them…?” she made a finger gun.
The ride to northern Illinois was long and uneventful. Until Cas offered to show Sam the bands they had been investigating.
“Great. Give me a little time to do some research and we should be able to get a plan together.”
Dean scoffed. "Here I thought you'd finally be good for somethin'."

She approached him in the library, a slapdash sandwich in hand, her paltry excuse on a plate. She set it on the table, Sam jolted at the noise.
We return to the bunker, where Sam, Dean, and Jack are gathered in the library. The air is charged and excited, full of possibility.
Now out of that room, their minds suddenly felt clearer, brighter, more able to see the big picture again.

Sam and Castiel both opened their mouths to respond, and shut them again without answer.
“You don’t what, love?”
“Okay the repeating thing is getting a little tired, could we not?”
He turned to help Bris wrangle the archer, but she’d already pinned them and halted any further struggles with a knife at their throat.
But he didn't. He couldn't. That ache in his chest was overpowered by a tightness that screamed at him. A clenching pain that told him Dean wouldn't want that. Whatever that 'everything' was, Dean wouldn't want to talk about it. Wouldn't want to hear it. Might even choose to ignore it because—

have steered clear.
Gabriel turned to leave, but Bris caught him by the arm.
Sam headed straight for the coffee pot when he entered the kitchen. He picked up the can of grounds from where it now permanently lived on the counter and opened the unadorned lid, the post-it note having fallen off days ago.
Cas opened his mouth, but didn't respond.
“Because you’re not menstruating.”
The guitar slowly faded out. Another song came on. Dean didn’t hear it.

“You and your little goonies are nothing but-” Jo’s commanding voice was cut off as a bottle of water thunked off the side of Castiel’s pain riddled head and clattered to the ground. There was shifting from inside the janitor’s closet, and, rather than face Alistair and without seeing whomever threw the water bottle, Castiel sped off down the corridor.
Dean was so taken aback that he lost his words and stood there with his mouth open for a few seconds. “Excuse me?” He managed to ask.
But he banished those thoughts from his mind and opened his eyes again, coming back to the sharp ache in his undoubtedly broken rib, the prickling on his face and aching of his feet. He didn’t need a family, or a friend. He had survived this long without the. He could deal with it a while more.
Cas pulled up Netflix, scrolling quickly down until he found the “continue watching” list and clicked Doctor Who. He nervously looked at the stairs and turned down the volume until he could barely hear the british accents issuing from the TV. She sleeps like the dead, He gritted his teeth and told himself, you can turn it up you idiot you don’t have to read their lips.
He was shoved into the back seat, and when he tried to get to the other door, Dean grabbed his ankle and dragged him back, making him cry out in pain. Then Winchester slid into the car next to him, keeping a hand on his sore ankle. Alistar and Azazel got into the front seats. “You be careful driving my baby.” Winchester said warningly to Azazel, who laughed.
After a minute of wondering about his life choices and supporting Castiel’s neck with one hand, he was standing with the thinner boy balanced awkwardly on his chest in a half-hug. Castiel’s breathing was shallow, laboured and worrying. As Dean took a step out of the alleyway Castiel took a loud wheezing gasp, followed immediately by a gasp of pain. “Hey…” Dean whispered nervously in his ear, “Are- are you awake?”
Cas made the blankets into a cocoon around his, tucking his hands under his chest and lying on his stomach. He had picked up that habit from when he was 7 years old, and scared of the supposed “monster under his bed” the mean kids at school talked about. He had learned not to keep his hands out, or the monster would grab them and drag him under to eat him slowly starting with his toes and finishing with his hair. So he tucked his hands under himself every night, and pulled the blankets under his feet just to make sure the monster couldn’t grab those too.
Dean had been in his room for a while, fixing a lace on his boots while the other two were in the living room. After that, he did a little homework. Then he just lay in bed. He did this for a while. He could hear music from the TV blaring through the house, but he didn’t care enough to yell at Sam to turn it down. That kid had hearing problems or something.
“I find that a little hard to believe, coming from you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well well freak. You’re looking a little rougher than usual today.” Alistair sneered, examining his face. “Wanna explain that? Has someone else been beating on ya, huh? Taking up space on that face for bruises that could have been ours?” He looked around the group. “Or has one of you been havin some fun without me?” He looked especially at Dean, who shrugged.
He started walking off faster than before, the woman behind him said something after him but all he cared about was that she wasn’t following him. He started walking to the nearest church steeple he could see over the tops of the stores.
Dean wishes he would get up. Blue eyes never open. Stitch after stitch after stitch.
He crept to his mother’s room and stood outside the door, listening for any signs of life. When he was certain she was either sleeping, out of the house, or dead, he opened the door. There was no one there. He sighed in relief.

“It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter if I’m alright Cas is dying damnit!” His voice broke on the last word, but he didn’t clear his throat or pretend it didn’t happen. Sam looked away.
He staggered across the sidewalk, feet stuttering along, heart heavy. He had no clothes. No bed. No shelter. He could go hide out in the library, or skip around the shops downtown until nightfall, but he probably looked like a murder victim right now. From experience, people tended to be less happy about that. He didn’t shiver, but he felt cold, and his head hurt. He knew from overheard voices in the hallways that there was going to be a freak cold front these next couple of days, maybe lasting even a week long. Due to current circumstances, it made his mood plummet further. Life apparently couldn’t give him a fucking break.
“I said you better watch your mouth.” She hissed again.
________________________
“No.”
His brain panicked and his hand starting acting on impulse, any sense of self-preservation discarded while Alistair leered down at him. Castiel punched Alistar as hard as he could on the mouth, his knuckles throbbing painfully afterward. Alastair fell back with a yell, clutching his lips with both hands. Blood was dripping down his chin, and Castiel barely had time to feel a pinch of satisfaction before he scrambled on his hands and knees away from Alistair, trying to get as far away from him as he could before he made a run for it.
Castiel realized that they were just going to leave him there, tied to the bridge, alone. With basically no way to get free. His heart hardened at this, a steely look coming to his face. These fools, stupid arrogant jerks, are just going to leave him there. They will let him rot with embarrassment as he yells himself hoarse and has to have someone untie him from this damn bridge. And then they will do it all over again when he returns to school.
He doubted they would in such a public place, but Castiel had learned not to expect anything but the top treatment from the knights of hell.
“I couldn’t get away! Don’t act like I just stood there and took it!” He raised his voice a little.
Alistair knelt beside him and said maliciously “Try anything like that again, I’ll go get the baseball bat and finish the job I started.” Dean watched Castiel’s eyes flitter with fear as Alistar grabbed his arm and forced up the sleeve of the cardigan Castiel was wearing. With a ballpoint pen, he wrote the letters A. A. In blocky letters on Castiel’s arm. THe letters stood for Alistair Abernathy. He finished up and passed the pen to Dean, who quickly crouched in front of Castiel and grabbed his warm hand. As he drew his initials into the pale skin there, he wondered how it would feel to snap all the fingers of Castiel’s hand. To watch blood pour from them onto his perfect, expensive clothes bought for him from his perfect apple-pie-life mom. Probably satisfying, maybe a little disturbing. He dug the ballpoint pen hard into Castiel’s arm, and the boy yelped and tried to jerk away from him. Dean laughed softly, almost managing to succeed in ignoring the guilty twitch in his heart.
Instead of bothering the cleaning lady, who was deeply concentrated on the handle of the device, Castiel creaked up the stairs to his room and dropped off his backpack. He had some homework but that could wait until later at night, after the cleaning lady left and he had his house to himself. It wasn’t that big of a breach in his privacy, but he never felt like doing things when other people were around. Maybe he got that from school.
One of the iron hands that had been clamped to his head, keeping it there, slid down quickly. Down, to his chest. To his stomach. Past his stomach. Castiel bucked and thrashed as Alistair gripped his thigh hard enough to leave bruises. His hands were skeletons, and his eyes were open and cold. Wasps filled Castiel’s brain, buzzing in panic and fear, hyper aware of the hands all over him and the stench of cologne and sweat and dirt that surrounded him. He was so scared he could barely move the way he wanted to, time slowed down but his body was speeding up, four steps ahead of where he wanted to be. Alistair’s fingers were scrabbling at his fly zipper and Castiel could taste terror, coppery and blood like. He brought his hand up quickly as he could, gathering his strength, and batted numbly, with all the strength his possessed, at Alistair’s cheekbone.
Castiel’s vision went red with panic, and he struggled to get away, tossing himself this way and that. Dean grunted and hit him in the face, stunning him for a minute.  Then he wrapped both arms around Castiel, and hauled him roughly to the car, making it impossible for him to escape.
So, after school, they had waited until Castiel’s skinny person appeared in the hallway, then they grabbed him and hauled ass to the pool.
Castiel forced himself to walk calmly to the next clas, and not let everybody see that he was terrified. Azazel had clearly failed the math test, and Cas could still see the glare Azazel had sent his way. The look had promised a beating after school, maybe a few stitches. He really didn't want to go to the emergency room again, but he just didn't know how to avoid them.
“He doesn’t want to be here!” Sam yelled, and somehow, Novak was still not waking up, “But I think we’ve got a duty-”
There was definitely some sort of arguing going on behind him, his ears were picking up what they could but his coughing was making it hard. His body rocked on the ground as Castiel tried to catch his breath. He was soaked from his ribcage up.
He glared at his lunch some more.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stumbled to his feet, legs in the process of falling asleep from being still so long. He took one last look at the grave inscription before he walked away, eyes red and still a bit puffy.
“Yes mother.”
He wished he had a book more than ever now. He paced for a minute - before his ankle started to hurt and he couldn’t keep his breathing even enough for his rib- just for something to do. Eventually he had to sit down with his back to the wall, curled over his knees and breathing shallowly.
It was a warmer day. Castiel realized he hadn’t grabbed jacket, and was grateful for the mid seventies temperature. As he walked he could feel his hips crack, the bones felt like someone had filled them with mortar. Part of him could barely believe he had managed to wake up, another part of him was shaking in fear at the thought of whatever intense misery waited for him when his father got home. Another part of him was thinking about the Knights, and wondering if the others knew how close Alistair had come to drowning him yesterday.
Dean laughed. “So long.” He let go of Cas’s face and walked away, whistling some song. Cas coughed again and let his head fall back to the pavement, pounding with pain and an oncoming headache.
Something big had happened. Like his father losing his job big, or his mother having to get one. Or maybe there was a nasty rumour going around. And what was it she had said about paying hospital bills? Maybe the one for Castiel’s arm had been a bit high. It was a mind boggling thought, considering his father’s money never seemed to end. But that kind of thinking usually got people in trouble so he tried to avoid it.
“Okay. Okay.” He tried to calm his heart, to figure out what to do. He couldn’t just leave him here, he could die if he did. Calling 911 and leaving? Could that work? There was the possibility that when Castiel woke he would immediately tell the police who was responsible for most of his injuries, or, if he didn’t know his attacker he could just blame Dean. Or Alistair and Azazel, and their getting blamed would lead to his getting blamed to by association. Anyone could’ve done this to Castiel, in this area, if they thought he had money. From the looks of him, if Castiel ever did have money it was long gone by now. Well, ER was out, unless something changed drastically on the way to the car. Dean didn’t want his Dad (or Bobby, or Ellen, or anyone else unaware of this little tidbit) that he could’ve been responsible for this.
“Okay. That’s your phone call to make, and soon. You got it?” Dean asked. It seemed perfect, ship Novak down to Indiana and leave the family to the aftermath of missed school and Graduation. It would be a little difficult explaining to Jo how Novak just happened to be gone, but….
___________________________________
He opened the suspected cabinet, and with a lurch his stomach fell somewhere around his knees. The duct tape wasn’t there.
Then he remembered; his father. He had defied his father’s orders, and left the consequences for his morning self to handle. Fear twinged in his stomach as he imagined what might happen this time. Maybe his father would keep up the theme and try to drown him in the kitchen sink? He hadn’t made dinner, and had pointedly ignored his father’s calls, and that was a serious offense. His mother made dinner it sometimes, when there was a special occasion, like the night Zacharia came, but other times it was left to the son. And when he failed to act accordingly, especially if his father told his specifically, it was like signing a form that signed him up to be a test subject for boxing gloves.
He hadn’t forgotten about last night, with the pasta incident. But he also wasn’t going to march up to her and ask what was wrong up front. Tact was a vital part of getting information. Unfortunately, he wasn’t too good with tact. But he would work it in somehow, maybe at dinner or something.
A little into the movie he must have fallen asleep out of sudden fatigue, because when he woke up it was paused and Sam was reading. After a few minutes, Castiel blearily turned his head and found a glass of water sitting under his position on the couch; presumably for him. If not, he was about to piss somebody off. He reached over sloppily and tried to grasp the glass, and Sam said “Oh! You’re awake. I paused the movie, but I think you might’ve missed some-I wasn’t really paying attention and I don’t know when you conked out.”
Probably they knew all of it. Knowing Alistair he had probably grabbed a phone, dialed Winchester’s number and boasted about his work, as long as Winchester would listen. He did seem rather opposed to the idea of what Alistair was doing yesterday. Then he would have called Azazel and maybe Uriel too, accepted their praise and polished his throne at the top of the pecking order. Castiel found himself wondering if the others would approve. Azazel almost certainly would think it was a tale worth writing on gold leaf, worth proclaiming to the whole school, despite the fact that he had abandoned the attack yesterday. Castiel probably could expect nothing less than Azazel’s worst treatment. Uriel...well, Castiel didn’t really have a grasp on Uriel’s attitude. He was basically a carbon copy toadie, sneering and laughing at all the right insults, holding arms behind backs and only joining in when told to. Maybe he would laugh, suck up to Alistair and try to be a real member of ‘the gang’. Winchester….
“Why so quick to leave, Winchester?” Azazel asked sharply, “Not like we’ve done anything wrong.”
“Uhm, why should you?” She furrowed her brow. “Well, for one, I don’t even know this school my first day was less than a week ago. I know, I know, late start, but I was homeschooled until now. I don’t know anyone here, I saw you on the sidewalk this morning and it looked like you and I both need the same thing. A friend.” She reached to his shoulder like she was going to pat it, and he shrank back quickly. She put her hand awkwardly down and said “You don’t have to trust me, I can tell you really don’t believe me when I say I come in peace. But just know that I’m not lying. I don’t know what they’ve put you through here,” she eyed his face “but I had no part in it, and I never will. I just want to be your friend.”
He grunted when the bowl hit him. It bounced off his body and shattered on the floor, spreading sauce and spaghetti everywhere. Then he just stood there, with pasta sauce all over his shirt, looking at the shattered pieces on the floor. He wondered if he should clean up, or leave.
He had arrived to school the monday after he broke his arm, with the dick picks and false cheery encouragements scribbled off his cast. The knights of hell had noticed, and like on Friday, had cornered him and asked to sign his cast again. He had refused again, and they had hit him a couple times before taking his arm by force and signing it. He had gone home and scribbled them all out. By now, his cast was almost black. This happened every single day. Uriel, Alistar and Azazel had kept a cruel grin on their faces the entire time. The only one who seemed to not have enjoyed every minute of Cas grunting and cringing in pain was Winchester, whose own smile had faded once or twice, replaced with a faker look of forced enjoyment. Castiel didn’t even want to know why Winchester was suddenly not reveling in torment, but it was an interesting change. It wasn’t like he was going to walk up to Dean and ask to be friends or anything. Dean was one of the bastards who had tied him to that bridge and broke his arm. He wasn’t suicidal.
You have to put the stitches in carefully, carefully.
She stopped speaking and bit her lip, breathing a bit more heavily than before. Castiel was still rooted to the carpet, a deadpan expression fixed on his face like usual. She stared at him, she looked sincere. Really sincere. Castiel was fighting the impulse, his stupid basic human need to trust her. But it was a losing battle. He always was too gullible.
“What?” She asked, “Why not?” She seemed genuinely confused. The Knights seemed to be getting better actors.
Dean was sitting on the floor, kneeling in front of Casiel humiliatingly low, eyes meeting Castiel’s chin when he looked head on.
“What do you want me to say?” Castiel said, and cursed internally to hear the shake and fearful pitch to his voice.
Castiel lay in his bed drowsily, still fully clothed even though it was 12:30 at night. He just really didn’t want to move from his comfortable position on the bed, even to get pajamas on.
When he got home, there was someone else in the house. He closed the door, and then paused for a moment of alarm as he heard the vacuum going. That simple sound set off alarm bells in his head, because his mother never used the vacuum. He kept his backpack on, and padded to the living room, trying to keep quiet even though there wasn’t a very high chance it was a robber in their living room. What kind of criminal vacuumed the floors after he was done?
The man turned to leave but before he shut the door Dean blurted “Wait! Are you serious?” Novak sr. turned around and looked at him like he was a bug. Dean regretted his life decisions for a second.
“Nothin’. Where’s Uriel?” Dean asked, noticing the absence of their todie.
Even more confused than before, Castiel continued staring at Alistair, who sighed again, delicately. “Azazel’s sister got fucked, he’s home all the time dealing’ with the downfall. Dean-o’s got other stuff to do, and I wouldn't hang out with that retard Uriel by myself for a fucking Porsche. Naomi's got a loving mommy, Meg’s got a new guy and Benny’s been carted down to New Orleans with his family.” He looked at Castiel pointedly, grinning humorously when he saw the puzzlement in the blue eyes. Castiel was frustrated now. Who cared about the status of Alistair’s social life?
Azazel, Alistar, Uriel and Dean looked around him, with their backpacks dropped on the floor a few feet away. Dean was standing closest to him, with his green eyes hard and mocking. Alistar and Azazel stood right across from him about a foot from his legs, and they had their arms crossed in a twin gesture of hostility. Uriel was standing farther away at his other side with a ridiculous looking evil-villain type expression on his face, like he was trying to look mean and menacing but failing. Cas had the urge to laugh at it, but that urge soon passed when Azazel started moving forward.
He was going to die, he was sure, in this sad school swimming pool that stank of bleach, and his last words were going to be a pathetic plea that fell on deaf ears.
Walking through the hallways, his shoes scuffed and squeaked on the floor. His shoulders were pummeled,  like he was invisible. If only I could be invisible to to a the Knights He bitterly thought. His backpack was whacked uncomfortably to the side of his back as a blonde haired teen tried to cross unwittingly directly through traffic. “Watch it freak.” He said loudly, not even pausing to look at Castiel.
“No.” Castiel answered.
_____________________________________
He turned over, and went to sleep soon after that.
“Yes. Lead the way.” He said with nervousness concealed in his voice.
“Dean!”
Not really knowing how to answer that, Castiel stood in the doorway and nodded a bit awkwardly, looking more at his father’s forehead then his eyes. His father didn’t comment on the prominent bruises littering his son’s face.
The car door slammed, and they drove off. Castiel felt light headed, and all of a sudden he gasped for air, letting go of a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. After the fear let go of his heart, and the blood stopped pounding in his head, he spent the rest of his walk to school wondering how Alistair had thrown that bat so well.
He rolled over and grabbed the piece of toilet paper he was using as a bookmark from the desk. After marking his spot, he pulled the covers all the way over his chest before realizing that he was still in his jeans and t shirt.
Gagging on corpses and letting their disassembled limbs drift up through the blue to nudge Dean’s back. Horrible.
“Oh there’s no need for such drastic measures!” Alistair crooned. He sounded like he was trying to make a deal. “Just stay out of my business, and I’ll stay out of yours. Dean doesn’t like it much when you get - involved - in these things, but you step into crap you don’t understand one more time and I’ll do whatever I can to mess up your pretty little face. I can deal with Dean afterward.” The threat was so strong in his voice, it could have melted a cast-iron door. There was a thud and the clatter of cleaning supplies on a shaken shelf, like Alistair had pushed Jo back.
When he got to the right side of the bridge again, it was getting dark. He hurried along the sidewalk, shivering in his soaked clothes. It took him about 4 minutes to get home, and by then it was completely black. He didn’t know what time it was.
The nightmares had started. This one had been….
The morning was crisp, and it was still gaining light. He breathed in deeply, counting on the clean spring air to wake him up fully. He stepped more onto the porch, and surveyed the damage from last night.
But he had to get ready for school. He couldn’t miss today, no matter how much he wanted to just curl up in his bed and die. He was just being a wimp. It was just a few bruises, why was he complaining so much? There are children starving in Africa. Castiel thought this, but internally he knew that this was more than just a few bruises. He could have a concussion, the way his head was hurting and swirling.
*** there is a rape attempt in this chapter, though he doesn't get much farther than kissing and saying extremely vulgar things. You have been warned. It's.... not exactly mild, but not extreme.***
It was kind of comforting, knowing when you were going to be beat and where. A sort of dependability that he could count on, the fact that on a normal day, he would be caught after school and dragged around the building to be punished for some unknown wrongdoing. It was comforting in an off way. As the day went on and Castiel sort of sat through it thoughtlessly, a sense of calm flooded through him. That is, until the last period, when the bell rang shrilly and his class stood to leave, and he felt his stomach start to flutter in anticipation.
Sam didn’t answer. He just got up and carted the two popcorn bins into the kitchen. Transformed from a spitfire protestor to a housemaid in seconds.
He could feel her trying to pierce him with a glare as they sped down the hallways, the waves of people partying like the red sea before Dean. “Well, I’m sure he’s just enjoying a nice day at home with the family.” He lied, and Jo could tell. “It’s not my business, it’s not your business, and this conversation is pointless.”
Castiel’s forehead creased as he watched he start to open her backpack and pull out a purple plastic lunch container. What was she doing?
“Oh come one Deanie, lighten up.” Azazel laughed. “The blue eyed bitch boy might be gone, but you don’t have to take out your righteous anger on me.”
Cas looked at them, terrified. He held his head up. Dean was still holding the back of his shirt tightly, so he wouldn’t slip away. Like he would be stupid enough to try. They would be on him like fleas to a dog if he tried to make a break for home. “What do you want?” Castiel said. His voice was trembling. Dammit.
Dean whispered ‘I love you’ into Castiel’s ear until the light was gone from the blue eyes, and what little life there was in the desecrated body had left. Sam was standing silently next to Dean, not saying a word with tears running down his face, though not as many as Dean. Dean tightened his grip on the body, yelling his name over and over though he knew he was gone.
Beaten again today, not feeling very good. Bruises, and possibly broken rib. Got to be more careful.
Alistair grabbed his leg hard, Castiel jumped and tried to kick out unsuccessfully, only succeeding in grazing the side of Alistair’s cheek with the toe of his shoe. Quick as a tiger he was dragged bodily across the ground, scrunched up into Alistair in such a painful position he screamed. Quickly a hand was over his mouth, dry and disgustingly warm, and he lurched forward trying to bite the palm. Suddenly the hand was replaced by Alistair’s disgustingly hot mouth, tongue plunging indelicately past Castiel’s lips, licking everywhere in the few seconds. Making horrible wordless noises, gagging, Castiel fought to get away from the intrusion that was making his empty stomach rear. His hands were weak and useless, so he used his elbow, trying desperately to get enough leverage to jam it somewhere, anywhere. The mouth was still on his, lips moving and slimy and warm, and Castiel couldn’t stand having them on him, he wanted them off off off off off
Hey guys! Feel free to stalk me at my tumblrl: http://buffywinchester04.tumblr.com/
Jo grabbed something at her side, and held it up. “I found this in the hallway, I assume it’s yours?” She was brandishing Castiel’s backpack, and he nodded. She put it back down and stood up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ma’am, I appreciate it, but I’m really fine.” He said firmly as he could, stepping forward before turning back to say something that would convince her. “I’m going somewhere to….take care of this right now.” He said vaguely.
When he was walking down a corridor near the end of the school day, a bright flash of blonde hair whipped behind him before nails scraped the back of his neck, snatching and hanging on tight to his collar. He held back the instinctive duck-and-skid-away-cowering because it would be unmanly and funny to Jo. He doubted anyone else in the hallway would say anything, because they were afraid he would punch them in the gut. And damn, they were right.
Castiel sat in the library with no book, gingerly resting on the chair and chewing his PBJ slowly so as to savour it. It was the only thing he had packed, he hadn’t even thought to bring a water bottle to wash down the throat-closing peanut butter. He stared absently at the wall ahead of him as he ate.
Reluctantly smooshing his face from the screen, Castiel walked out his room and found his mother in her room. He walked in and lingered in the doorway, listening to the sound of his mother’s TV show issuing from the flat screen TV. His mother was sitting on the bed eating something that looked like nachos and cottage cheese with jalapenos, banana peppers and interestingly, bananas on top of a blanket on the bed so she didn’t get the sheets dirty before his father came tomorrow. She looked at him with an expression of distaste on her face, whether the look was aimed at Castiel or the questionable nachos was debateable.
Cas hissed as he felt a sharp sting at his ankle, and lifted the covers to find a giant scratch on his foot that he wasn’t sure how he had gotten. Being slightly more mindful of the scratch, he swung his legs out of bed and stood up too quickly. Head spinning, he stumbled to the shower.
His heart, which hadn’t been slowing down, began to beat impossibly faster, jackhammering in his chest. How had he been so stupid? Being out of bed this whole time. How much noise had he made? He slowly turned around, his eyes reluctantly going straight to the sight of his father leaning with one shoulder on the kitchen doorframe. He smirked at Castiel, with an amused light in his eyes, but tucked in the corner of them there was something akin to annoyance and slight anger waiting to be unleashed. Castiel gulped and whispered “Father.”
_________
After a while he realized he was watching, not just looking. He didn’t know how long they’d been sitting there, but he had finished his food and wanted more water. He couldn’t bring himself to ask, and he didn’t want to get up and get some himself; he wasn’t sure he was allowed to.
As he walked out his door, he stopped as he saw his mother walk into her room, presumably to get her stuff for her shower. She glowered at him as she passed, and the moment she was gone he released a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
Carried to the ground.
The long crawl to the back door was bitter. Castiel stood on his knees to unlock it, and when he had, he dropped to all fours and again and dragged himself to the back yard. Hoping that his father would give him some time to rest now that he was out of the house, he dropped to the ground and breathed heavily throat his mouth, drooling on the grass but not caring.
He and Azaze; walked partway up the stairs, as Alistar hid behind a wall and waited for the black head of hair to come into sight. They knew he didn’t have an alternate way to get to his last class, he would have taken it by now. So they waited.
“Hey Dean.” Sully said, in that ever friendly voice he never lost, even when Dean’s fist was pounding into his face.
Castiel didn’t pray though. He didn’t know why, but he never really caught on to the idea of talking to God, when he couldn’t talk back. It seemed pointless.
His mother often made fun of him for never missing a mass, but he didn’t let it affect him. He had faith, and he wasn’t going to let it be taken away.
He passed through the swarms of students with the usual difficulties, getting his shoulders knocked and his bag buffed between bodies. The day sped up and everything faded to a blur again until last period ended.
He stared at the wall of his room, and just let his mind buzz pleasantly. He sat there until his hand slipped while rubbing his arm, hitting his thigh with a sharp smack and snapping him out of his daze. He flinched at the  sound and got slowly up from the bed, every muscle screaming at him to just get under the covers and go to bed for the rest of time. But instead, he pulled on his black slacks, a white button down shirt over a pale t shirt, and a blue tie. He rolled the sleeves up to his elbows, and exited his room.
Wincing at the tone of voice, Dean stuck his head out of his room to see Sam looking at him from the doorway across the hall, where he had stuck his head out curiously. He eyed Dean and mouthed the words ‘what’s up?’, which Dean ignored. He didn’t know the answer, and he wasn’t going to waste precious breath telling Sam so.
He walked to the back of the library, and took out his lunch. He had a cutie, a small pbj, a granola bar, and a bottle of water. He started peeling the cutie.
Then came the time to call his parents. He grudgingly gave them his mother’s cellphone number, and hoped she was awake. They needed her permission to fix his arm. From what he understood, he needed a surgery to set it right.
Dinner was ok. Mother was drunk again, but it was quiet and we didn’t talk.
They laughed harder as he turned hurriedly and walked away, eager to get out of the place he thought was safe but apparently was not. They were making a bigger spectacle of themselves that was really necessary, but wasn’t that the point of the Knights Of Hell? To bring attention to themselves?
“Um, are you sure you don’t want those checked out?” She looked pointedly at his face. It throbbed as if acknowledging her stare. He glared at his hands. “They’re starting to look green.”
Cas looked at the clock, and was startled to see it was 12:30 already. If he wanted to go to the library, it was open at 1.
So, Dean walked through the morning routine of getting to school in one piece in silence. Well, not complete silence. He hummed songs from ‘The Muppets’ as loud as he could whenever Sam was near him.
He could almost hear Sam’s neck crack as he whipped it around. “Pizza?” Hope. Cold dignity and hope.
He helped his dad put away in silence, except for when his dad dropped a whole bag of vegetables and cursed. Dean jumped about a foot in the air, his nerves were so shot. His dad looked at him weirdly. He just shrugged.
“Are you going to be okay, Castiel?” She asked suddenly, and he turned to face her, confused and silent. He was going to be fine, he wasn’t dead was he? She sighed, faint humour flickering through her features. “The silence is back huh? I mean when you get home, will you be okay? You’re so quiet, are you going to tell anybody about this, or do I have to?”
Dean groaned, loudly. “Fine. Fine. So what, you’re just going to dream of the number in your sleep? Gonna guess it? Do you got someone else ‘round to help?”
The steam wafted onto Castiel’s back, he was sitting on the floor of the shower because his legs suddenly felt too weak to hold him up. The slightly slimy feel of the floor was not an altogether foreign feeling, as he had done this many times before. The mornings after a hard beating were always the worst, he knew that from experience. He shampooed his hair on the floor slowly, until his arms ached from holding them up and he had to rinse it out. He lingered for a while, just letting himself rest in the cocoon of warmth. Then he realized how much time he had been wasting and hurried along so he wouldn’t be late for school.
Sam sniffed and turned away. “Kinda both.” He said, challenging Dean to find something wrong with this.
He picked at the rope around his waist, plucking and pulling at the knot. He could feel his fingers getting raw as he worked it. After about 20 more minutes of cursing and fraying the impossibly tight knot, he felt it loosen around his waist. He felt a thrill as he pulled it off, but then a jolt of fear as he thought of what he had to do next.
He thoroughly searched his room, looking for the silver duct tape that he knew couldn’t be there because there were only a few places to lose things in his room and he had searched them all. But he searched them again. And again. Desperation built up inside him as he walked in circles around his room, a simple problem blown into a full grown crisis. He dropped to his knees, and thrust his head partway under the bed. No duct tape. Nothing.
Castiel’s ears perked as he heard the shower upstairs turn off and the shower curtain ripped back on the metal rod it hung on. His mother was out of the shower, and she normally took 10 minutes to get dressed, and they would be pushing it but they would probably be on time at the hospital. Castiel didn’t want to piss off their nurses or doctor by being late, but he couldn’t exactly rush the one driving him there so they would just have to be patient if worst came to worst.
Been punching someone over and over again until his knuckles bruised.
Quick as a whip, a sharp sting lanced across Castiel’s face. Like a cat, Alistair had raked his fingernails across his cheek, not drawing blood but it felt like the skin was grafted at least a little. It was a very mild reaction, considering. Alistair didn’t even look peeved about the fact that there was a gob of saliva on his cheek, dripping slowly down the curve of his chin.
“But wait! C’mon dude I’m just trying to be your friend, is that so hard to believe?” A hand grabbed at his sleeve, and he flinched and jerked his hand away as though burnt. Jo mumbled a quiet apology behind him, and he stiffened. He had never heard anyone at this school apologize to him for anything.

Castiel was having a hard time getting his breath out, and he couldn’t make it slow down. There was panic coursing through his body, flooding his mind. What did they have planned? Dean got off of Cas, but kept a hand on his shirt collar and pulled him up too.
______________________________
Dean walked closer and said “I freshened him up a little yesterday. Found ‘im at the arcade, during school hours.” Dean chose to ignore the fact that he and Sammy had skipped school too to come and have a little fun before their dad got home.
The meal started well enough. The clinking of silverware and his father’s chewing were providing a soundtrack. Castiel was eating quietly, eyes only on his food. Out of the corner of his eye his father was eating hungrily, or staring at his mother and Castiel in turns. “So,” he started conversationally, (and quite suddenly, making Castiel flinch) “Castiel, how is school?”
“Castiel, wait!” She looked angry, and sad and her eyes were flashing with something else he couldn’t identify. “Just because I sometimes share a house with that asshole, doesn’t mean I like or respect his decisions. I think it’s sickening, the way he treats the people here. It’s one of the only things me and Sam agree on. And don’t you think I haven’t called him out. He comes home with bloody knuckles and he goes to bed with his ears ringing. But the dumb lump won’t listen, not to anybody. Not even his precious little brother, and that’s saying something.He just defends whatever his goons do with all his heart and it’s hard to fight with him after a while. But please, I’m just trying to be your friend. The reason I didn’t mention Dean at first was I knew it would probably get in the way of things, bring up bad memories.” She looked pained. “I don’t know why I mentioned it just now. But now you know. I really am just trying to be your friend.”
Blue eyes. Black brown hair. Pale skin. Stuble. Lips.
Thank you so much for all the comments and support! Special awesomeness awards to Destiel_Lucifers_OTP_666, Tickette, CastielTheAngel, Swan0314 and (DRUMROLL PLEASE) Viplaja! Thank you so much for all your awesome comments they bring me joy and happiness!
The big brick building seemed to suck all the happiness in the world into it, crush it beneath its weight, and then feed the desiccated joy into the mouth of hell. Maybe that was a shade dramatic, but the description was accurate all the same. There was a flow of students slowly winding through the door, ignoring Castiel mostly. As he walked up the stairs another Senior Castiel didn’t know the name of shoved him down, but out of sheer willpower Castiel managed to remain standing. He glared halfheartedly at the smirking face of the Senior, who turned and was hailed by friends.
He scrambled as close to the door as he dared, trying to make himself seem like less of a target. Zechariah entered the room, face all business. “Time’s up! You should’ve been at the door five seconds ago, retard.”
He grabbed his school supplies from where they had been thrown, and started walking home.
He stood there for about a minute fiddling with his hands, before he realized he was still wearing his work clothes for outside and could go upstairs to change and escape from the awkward situation.
Mend the skin and make it new.
The Knights came out of their shock behind him and started running after him, shouting insults to him and each other. Calling him a Pussy and a coward and taunting him.
Slipping out the door, he opened his banana and tried to swallow a chunk of it without tearing up. He failed, the banana tore its way down his bruised throat and he could barely stand to take another 2 bites before deciding that whatever he thought would happen if he went to school on an empty stomach, would be far less painful than this.
“Honestly, I’m surprised you never learn that that never works! Letting you go right after we got you alone? Where’s the fun in that?” Dean sneered, and Castiel thought about just how many times they seemed to manage to get him alone. He should be on guard for that more.
He hadn’t eaten anything for dinner, but he didn’t really mind. His stomach felt mildly hollow but it wasn’t growling, and he had a ways to go before it was painful. He had a tolerance for hunger, one he had built up over the years. Not that he didn’t eat every day, but often enough to learn to get used to it.
“Your mother has died. Get out of my sight.” snapped Zacheria, in a tone that was meant to mean ‘don’t ask questions just do it.’ Brain scrambling, Castiel tried to make sense out of the words. What did he mean, ‘your mother has died’?
Climbing back to his shaky (and still hurting) knees, he did a few more unyielding circles around the room until he suddenly realized where the duct tape was.
Castiel felt sick. He didn’t want more bruises. He wanted to go home and lay in bed and rest and never get up ever again. But when he got home, he only had a few hours rest before his father got home. And even then he had to get homework done too. The queasyness progressed. He just wanted a way out.
Castiel, stomach sinking, knew where this was going.
Dean Smiled a second before letting the facade fall and punched sully hard in the gut. The boy gasped and doubled over onto the floor, landing with a clank and thud as he fell back against the lockers. Dean chuckled and walked away from Sully, who was groaning on the floor. The bully scattered Sully’s discarded books across the floor and walked away triumphant, even though it hadn’t been much of a fight. The crowd parted in front of him, and he felt powerful. A kind of power he hadn’t felt in a long time.
“So, Novak, i quite enjoyed our time together yesterday.” Alistair crooned into Castiel’s ear, as the thinner boy tried to get away in vain. “I mean, before that blonde bitch showed up and bailed you out. You’re lucky someone pities you enough to do that, Novak.”
Castiel’s hands started shaking. Alistair knew. There was no use denying it, really. He didn’t much sound like he was going to enlighten his friends, more like he was going to sit back and watch them tear Castiel apart. He had been sitting back and watching them tear him apart. He’d probably known forever, just not said anything. The bastard, Castiel thought viciously, though he didn’t know where the animosity came from. It wasn’t like he expected anything from anyone. Least of all Abernathy. How long had he known?
Dean’s mind chose that moment to remember the look in Castiel’s eyes as Dean cornered him in that dirty arcade alley way, the terror flashing through the blue of them. And the feel of hitting Castiel, feeling the skin and bones bruise his knuckles as he slammed punch after punch home. When Castiel had fallen Dean had continued beating on him, just to prove to himself he could. He slammed kick after kick in, just to thumb his nose at his inner self. He kept at it even after his brain was yelling at him to stop, but didn’t let himself think about the person he was beating, to make it easier.  A little something suspiciously like remorse edged it’s way into Dean’s emotional spectrum, and Dean shoved it back out violently. No remorse goes to Castiel Novak. See Novak? He thought You can’t escape me. I’ll just keep coming after you, you can’t spend your entire life hiding behind your parent’s money.
Cas gulped. Down by her locker? This was a trap, blaring in neon letters a blind man couldn’t miss. “Uh-what exactly is the problem?” Came out of his mouth before he could stop it.
Smashed brown glass littered the ground and the floor of the porch, and the beer, long dried carried a scent over the air. The sweet smell made Castiel a bit angry, partly because the teenagers drinking it were breaking the law, but mainly because they had made such a mess on someone else’s house, and they weren’t going to get any consequences for it. His house.
“Well, It’s not really your decision anyways, Sam, I’m oldest one in this fucking house! I get to say what goes! And he-” He pointed at Castiel, “-GOES!”
He walked alongside a busier road, ignoring the weird looks he was getting from the drivers of cars. He curled his fingers into fists and pushed his nails into his palms as a secondary pain to fixate on, besides the hurting spreading through the rest of his body. It didn’t work very well. It was slow going, limping along for the benefit of his ribs and hips and head. Dipping forward to ease the ache in his shoulder, wishing he could just lay down somewhere soft and sleep. But he couldn’t do that, yet. He needed to find some homeless shelter, or something similar, even though he had never heard of any nearby. He could stop by the nearest church and ask around, maybe locate a first aid kit.
“Have you ever sucked a cock before?” Alistair leered, mockingly. Castiel’s head snapped back, nudging the brick wall. His stomach plummeted, his heart did the opposite, beating hard enough to create friction in his chest. He didn’t want to be faced by this He did not not not not- “Huh? You could learn pretty fast, I bet. Those lips are just made for sucking.” Obscenely, Alistair licked his lips, making them glisten. Castiel shifted, for the first time considering pushing Alistair away. Before he wouldn’t, simply because he was not well enough to make a quick getaway and infuriating the beast was not something he wanted to do. But now, he couldn’t believe this. It was disgusting, the mere thought that he would sell himself- his body - for what? A roof? Some blankets. He wasn’t that desperate, and he had no plans to ever be. Still, he could think of no response. If he said no, would Alistair force himself on Castiel? He sat there for a second, thinking erratically while Alistair looked at him expectantly, licking his lips. Castiel cringed when he starting speaking again, wishing he would just go away.
Hey, thank you to the wonderful commenter who somehow alerted me to the fact that my publishing date was three days before I thought it was... I would have been totally unprepared. Thank you to everyone who reads this story.
“I-I-” Mumbled intelligently. This was a problem he had not faced before. She sounded genuine, but then again so had Naomi. How could he be sure he could really trust this Jo? He had never met her before. From what she said, she didn’t even know his name. Should he risk it? No.
“I thought I told you before, I don’t like it when you try to stay up with the adults?”
“Do you have anywhere else to go?”
“Um- it’s hard to explain.” Novak said softly. “He’s just not going to.”
The world was still swaying, Castiel was trying to wrap his mind around what his father was saying. But it didn't seem possible- how could it be? And his father was so emotionless about it, Castiel was almost shocked. But then again, when had his father showed any emotion other than hatred and indifference to his mother, since their wedding? This didn’t seem like the kind of joke that would be funny to Zacheria, so it must be true. His stomach roiled, but he didn’t know which emotion was plaguing it. If his mother had really died...well, there wasn’t exactly anything keeping his father from throwing him out, except for maybe the media getting wind of it, or teachers noticing his absence in school. But after so long without much outside interference, Castiel doubted anyone would notice if he never came back to the house or school. His father had friends in high places, and while they didn’t necessarily know much about Castiel’s home life, his father payed them well when it came to keeping noses out of his business. So, now it seemed like his mother had been the only thing stopping him from being cast out a long time ago.
In the kitchen, he grabbed a skillet from a low cupboard and set it on the stove. He flicked on the burner and turned it to “4” instinctually, then whirled around and grabbed two eggs from the large silver refrigerator. Cas snatched a bowl from the cupboard above the sink and cracked the eggs into it, throwing the shells into the garbage and grabbing a fork.
__________________________
Through the doors, past some lockers, then to the bathroom. Castiel walked cautiously inside, aware that this was a smallish enclosed space where more could transpire than personal hygiene. He turned at looked at the mirror, and pushed all the air out of his lungs.
They watched until midway through the fourth movie, Dean’s butt getting sorer and sorer, until Sam noticed Novak drfiting off again and paused it. Dean bellyached at him, but just layed down on the floor and tried to wait it out. There wasn’t much else to do until dinner, so maybe a nap was in order. Sam was turning the pages of a book loudly a few feet away. Maybe he was trying to annoy Novak awake by making sure he scraped the paper as hard as he could against his sweater.
Shifting, Castiel tried to settle his backpack on a shoulder that didn’t ache as bad. The floorboard under his shoe creaked squeakily, and he stilled with his foot half lifted. He waited to see if his father would look up, but the bald head remained resolutely bent over the phone.
Tile strangling the throat made new. Blue. Striped.
He walked in circles around the kitchen, waiting for his tea to steep. He was going to start this old show he heard a lot about called “Doctor Who”. He wasn’t so sure about the whole “Aliens and space travel” concept, but it sounded good.
It was a beautiful day, with sun shining through light clouds and a bright blue sky. It wasn’t very warm, but it wasn’t cold either. Perfect for a Sunday.
With that, the bucket of popcorn was tucked into the crook of his arm and the next movie was started. The beginning of this movie flew by in a similar manner, before Castiel fell asleep in the middle of a scene with a ridiculous blonde wizard and little blue pixies.
He finished homework for a couple classes and then layed on his bed to read comics. He was halfway through a Deadpool comic when he heard the front door open downstairs. The telltale sound of his dad’s boots stomping to the kitchen and putting food down. “Dean!” He jumped when he heard the voice. “Come help me put away groceries!” Dean scrambled out of bed.
“I’m going to say movies, and you’re gonna tell me which ones you haven’t seen. Just...shake your head if you haven’t seen it.” Sam said, looking back at the VHS stacks. “Let’s start easy….Harry Potter?”
Also, not just the people above but ALL OF YOU who comment make me so so happy and you guys are so awesome thank you! Tell me if you have ANYTHING to say about the story, I will respond. Even tell me if you don't like the way the story's going! Seriously, feedback is much appreciated.
Finally, his pen hit the page with an almost silent tap. He steeled his nerves, and then tried to unsteel them because this was a ridiculous thing and he shouldn’t be so nervous. He was just going to stop writing in a journal.
“Wait! Come on, why can’t I sit with you? It’s not like I’m gonna poison your food or anything! What are you so worried about?”
He looked over at Novak, who was gazing sleepily in horror at the both of them. “What?” He asked. This fight was because of him.
Dean grabbed Sully and slammed him against the wall of lockers, and grinned when Sully groaned loudly. Tears were shining in the fat kid’s eyes, and Dean grinned wider when he didn’t feel any guilt looking at them. So it was only Novak. Strange.
Walking upstairs, still in his shoes, he passed his mother in the kitchen where she was treating her coffee to a heavy dousing of alcohol. He winced as he walked by, thinking about the hangover she was going to have to fight tomorrow if she wanted to avoid a pummeling.
Dean started forward again and Castiel couldn’t keep his eyes off the bat, and he could barely feel the place where it had hit because the terror was coursing through his veins so thickly. He imagined how each blow would feel, thudding on his back and head and sides, breaking and fracturing and bruising.
Quick as lightning, his father stepped forward and slammed Castiel’s head into the door, pushing him backwards with a hand on his forehead. Castiel crumpled halfway to the floor, breathing harshly as he tried to see his way through the painful stars in his eyes. Zacharia crouched down between Casey's legs, and tipped his chin up with the tips of his fingers. “I said, your mother died. Bit it. She’s in chunks on the road, or at least some of her is. And now, “ He tapped his fingers on the side of Castiel temple as Cas recovered, “I want you out. Out of my house.”
Oh wait. He had. What else was new?
After he had paced awhile, Castiel put down the book and took out his journal. He took off the tiny padlock on it, and started writing.
He read that for an hour, and was really starting to get into it, when his mother came into his room and informed him in a slurred voice that dinner was ready. Cas really didn't want to leave his room, but he would get punished if he disobeyed.
He heard familiar laughs and sneers and mentally groaned and slapped himself. Of course you fool how could you trust Naomi no one is actually nice to you. That should have been your warning!
His father’s voice was like poisoned honey. Castiel gulped hard. “I-I remember.”
After taking refuge in his room, ignoring Sam’s efforts to talk and yell at him through the door, and sitting over a pile of algebra homework for a half hour, Dean faced the fact that he had to get some food together, or they were going to starve. In the kitchen, he tried to rid himself of his thoughts by going through the cupboards over and over, and making mental notes of all the staples they were missing.
“Shit.” He whispered again, clenching his hand into a fist and digging his fingernails into his palm. He knew where the duct tape was.
THANK YOU SO MUCh for being patient (and unpatient) with me, I'm SORRY, I shouldn't have been late, but I'm lazy, okay???? Also, today is a day of mourning for all those we lost in the Battle of Hogwarts, May 2nd, 1998. I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan, I have to mark this day, okay? Thank you! All of you.
He paused, thinking just how awful it would be if he didn’t. His first and last name were written in thick tar black sharpie on the front of the journal, and if anyone….if the knights of hell found his journal, he couldn't help but shudder at the possibilities. Enough self pity. He got back to writing.
“Uh, is Mrs. Novak home? Because I’m sure she’d want to-”  Dean was cut off. Again.
“Dean, just because ‘you’re the oldest’ and everything you say goes does NOT mean I’m going to let it happen. This is cowardly. You are a coward. A fucking coward. Don’t let your being messed up mess up somebody else’s life.”
“Hm. Was it your dad?” Alistair asked suddenly, coming out of a few seconds silence, the question dripping with fake empathy. Startled, Castiel’s eyes snapped down to Alistair’s face again, and he grinned even wider now. “Oh, It was daddy, wasn’t it? Is that why you’re sleeping here? Your loaded Dad decided you were looking bad for his reputation? Got tired of having a useless friendless nobody living in his house, and kicked you to the curb?” Castiel’s eyes were the size of dish plates now. He said nothing, looking up at Alistair breathing shallowly through his nose. His mouth parted slightly, wondering how Alistair figured it out. “Or maybe you left on your own. There’s lots of ways it could have happened.”
He managed to sit up by himself, short of breath and slow. He was a little surprised that he seemed to be getting three mostly-square meals a day, in a house where he was unwelcome. Even in a house where he was mostly welcome, three meals was rare. It was a little uncomfortable as Sam handed him things and he settled down to painstakingly peel open the yogurt. The younger boy watched him nervously, before busting out with a “Do you wanna watch something?”
Cast comes off Tuesday!
When he finished picking up everything, he mopped and put that away too.
Sam was stony. Dean put away groceries.
He walked the mile to the library happily, the weather had picked up a little bit since that morning. The sun was beaming proudly through the clouds, warming Cas’ back but not baking it. There was mud all over the roads, still lingering from the rain showers last week.
“It’s nice,” Alistair continued, “That you got yourself a little girl to defend you. That Jo= really is something’, isn’t she? She’s also a relative or something of Dean’s, so I gotta be careful round her so’s not to hurt my dear old buddie’s feelings. Me and Dean had a little disagreement this morning, because of the fact that his balls suddenly dropped off yesterday, but now we’re cool. But he won’t be very relaxed if he knows I’ve been dealing with your little groupie.” Alistair looked Castiel in the eyes and said very slowly, “Let’s get this clear. If you ever make a run for it, or get someone to help your ass, or cause me any sort of discomfort ever again,” Alistair leaned close, and Castiel leaned away- “I will kill you.”
“Bitch.” Dean tossed back, with equal malice.
Castiel still reached into his backpack and grabbed his emergency pocket knife just in case.
“We’re just getting started!” Azazel teased, ever the leader of their little group.
After he had eaten, he read until lunch was over. He normally ate very quickly, so he had time to finish a chapter or two of one of his school books before the bell rang and he headed to math.
“Now, I have had the pleasure of helping a friend of mine out of a sticky situation recently at school.” Jo said, with a tone of voice that told him she was massively downplaying something, and Dean wondered where the hell this was going on, with the vague sense that he was forgetting something important in the back of his head. “Now, as this friend of mine has a pretty tough school and home life, I was expecting a little something like this to happen soon. But of all the stupid, idiotic, brainless, moronic, cowardly things I expected you to do, leaving someone to be drowned in a swimming pool was not one of them Dean Winchester.”
He got the TV to netflix and found the show in question, gazing skeptically at the summary. He started the first episode.
He was halfway through the third episode, silently willing himself to get up and go to the library. He had finished his tea long ago, and made himself two more mugs. This show was really living up to what he had heard about it. At first, he had thought it enormously cheesy and wasn’t sure he would survive the first episode. Plastic people? Really? But he had given the second episode a chance, and was slightly more impressed by it than the first one.
The old arcade was a couple miles from his house, downtown. A small building, about the size of a two bedroom house filled to the brim with pinball machines and ancient shooting games. He only went there sometimes, when he had a bit of pocket money. Now he was on his last few dollars left over from mowing his neighbor’s lawn a few weeks back.
(See the end of the chapter for
For several minutes they stood like that, Castiel’s foot raised halfway over the floor in a tiring manner, and Zacheria ignoring him (or that’s what it looked like. Castiel knew that Zacharia did just like to make people wait for the fun of it too.)
He was feeling pretty good when he started walking home. The knights of hell hadn’t ambushed him in the parking lot, they had failed to get their hands on him in the school, and it seemed like he wouldn’t be going home with new bruises for once.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Prince Dean. I guess I’ll just come back at time that’s more convenient for you then!” Sam said, his voice dripping with sarcasm that practically made Dean wince. “After all, the world revolves around you, right? You can do whatever you want!”
Adrenalin was pumping through his veins from the scare, making him shaky and his hands sweaty. It wasn’t the run-a-mile kind of adrenalin, more the kind that makes you more jumpy. It was in no way helpful to Castiel.
He made a mental note to go later, and headed to the kitchen to make some tea. He had gotten some chai spice from the dollar store, and wanted to see if it was any good.
“Talk or walk Sam. I’m really not in the mood for this right now.” Dean turned and opened their barely magnetic fridge, shutting it firmly behind him once he made sure they had mustard.
Right now Dean was bellowing a fairly in tune version of ‘Istanbul’ by They Might Be Giants, and with every wallowing chorus he could see Sam’s shoulders go up higher. He was just getting to the third rendition when it happened. Sam jerked to him, eyes snapping, and punched Dean in the ribs so fast it was like a denim clad lightning bolt raced through the car. Groaning, Dean stopped singing and looked at Sam accusatory. “That hurt…” He whined. Sam didn’t look at him again.
She looked past Dean, to a confused Sam. “See you later Sam. Hope you’re proud.” She strode out the door.
He watched. He had nothing better to do. It kept Sam happy. Ideally, Castiel would have read the series before he watched the films; but he had more important things to worry himself over than not getting the full story, and the movie was engaging enough, if a little bit dated. Surprisingly enough, he hadn’t fallen back asleep yet 10 minutes later, and the story pulled him in slowly.
Castiel found out as he grabbed it, Wicked was a lot thicker than he thought it was, which was fine, except he really had other things to read school. He had only grabbed watchers intending to read little bits and pieces. But he also really wanted to find out about the cover of the book, which was green, decorated by a woman all in white, whispering into the ear of a green woman clad in black. He assumed she was the Wicked witch. So he grabbed the book and headed on his way.
“Dean, I haven’t even been at this school for two weeks. You’ve been here almost four years. Are you blind or just stupid?” She spat, with an infuriatingly pitying undertone.
His classes went well enough, except for history, when he found out there was a entire paper he didn’t know about. That put a damper on his mood.
When he was out of the shower, with freshly washed hair and a cleaner body in general, he chanced a look in the bathroom mirror. He recoiled as he wiped the steam from the looking glass, seeing a indescribable sight looking back at him.
When they were all done, Sam walked back to the bunker with his shovel and a somber expression. There would be no smiling or laughing that night. There wouldn’t be any for a long, long time. Dean stood and stared at the grave a long time, before moving.
Dean leaned in close and grabbed his jaw with one hand. “That was fun. Thank you, for that exercise.” He smiled a bit more, and then his expression turned serious. “But if you try that again, I will stuff you into a locker, and make sure no one lets you out until you’re hoarse from screaming for help. You got me?” His eyebrows quirked a bit, but he didn’t look like he was joking.
Instead of pausing like he normally would have, Castiel sped up, jogging up the stairs as his father called after him, “Castiel! Get down here now or I’ll skin you!”
While he was treading his path to the checkout desk, something caught his eye. His heart leapt as he recognized the cover of a book he had been waiting for for months.
His vision was starting to white out when he was finally allowed out of the burning water, and he was thrown and fell back onto the cement coughing and gasping and almost sobbing with relief as he gulped in as much air as he could. His vision slowly returned as he curled slightly, not even making an attempt to do anything other than breath.
When he realized he had been staring at the same word for two minutes straight, he decided tonight he was just going to have to admit defeat and go to sleep.
“Whatever you want.” He said monotonously.
Everything in his head hurt, his nose, his ears, his mouth, his brain, his throat. His cheeks ached and his teeth clattered against each other as his father kicked him in the ribs, pointy work shoe digging in like a shovel. It felt excruciating right now, like iron spikes being driven into his side. He was kicked again, and again, and as he felt a rib crack Castiel screamed with his abused throat, making things worse. Again and again, he was kicked and pulled up by the collar to be punched and pummeled. It lasted forever, and felt like being encased in a cold iron maiden, sticky with blood and pain. He was drowning in an ocean of the stuff, and it was dramatic but startlingly accurate.
“I’m not friggin lying!” She sounded slightly exasperated. “Please, just believe me? I’m not Dean’s secret agent. I just thought you looked lonely, and since none of the other sheep at this school were talking to you, I thought I would give it a try. I haven’t even been here two weeks.”
“I could’ve sworn you said something that sounded an awful lot like ‘no.’.” Zacharia glared at Castiel. “But I know that you, my son, would never say something like that. Right? Respect your elders and all that.” He spat out the words my son like he was disgusted to call him that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel sighed and set down the wad of gauze and closed his eyes. Leaning heavily  against the sink, breathing shallowly to appease his ribcage, he tried to see any good points to this situation.
He set the shower luke-warm, knowing from experience that it would only aggravate his injuries if he set it to the normal scalding-hot temperature he normally endured. He watched the dried flakes of blood float down the drown slowly, rubbing his hands slowly through his hair over his face and onto his chest in one big repetitive motion, rubbing off the excess blood and successfully touching every single bruise. For some reason he didn’t mind that pain as much though, at least he was in control of it. He almost forgot about the nightmare under the warmish glaze of the water on his purple back. It hurt some at first, the little pellets hitting his skin and making him clench his jaw. But he grew used to them in a matter of minutes.
