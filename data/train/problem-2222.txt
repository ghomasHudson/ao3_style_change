Sherlock closed his eyes, entered in his Mind Palace and took the box, slowly opening it.
Rosie laughed heartily, while Sherlock and John made evident efforts not to burst out laughing too. It was clear the girl already knew what film it was, but she enjoyed the performance too much to say so.
Strange closed his eyes.
The engine started again, and Mycroft felt the chains vibrate, which began to move so that he was left in a horizontal position, face-up, the incredibly hard dick pointing to the ceiling. He clenched his teeth because supporting the weight of his body was not easy until he noticed how it began to descend until he found support on a surface of a smooth skin surface. Mycroft breathed a sigh of relief, but he tensed up when the chains tightened again, immobilizing him again.
But the main reason to avoid calling them was that he couldn't stop masturbating himself, reproducing his fantasy in his mind over and over again, his cock almost sore by the sudden increase in wanking habits. And, looking at the rest of the Yarders, he could assure they were in the same situation, though nobody dared to bring up the subject when they were together.
But this was the first birthday since John and he were together, which made it special. And he didn't care about how old he was. Sherlock was living the happiest time of his life, and he felt younger than ever. According to the number of times he had celebrated the day he was born, he was around fourteen now.
"When they shot you, the memory of what happened to Anthony came back to me. I didn't know what was going to happen, but I was sure I didn't want to lose you. With Anthony..., I was reluctant to get married. I fear I could spoil everything, and one of the things I regretted most was not having accepted before. So when you got back on the plane, despite everything that happened, I decided to ask you at the first opportunity".
The butler smiled, shaking his head.
“Yes, but I’m his older brother, damn it! Always patronizing him…, I was useless even after… that happened. He couldn’t talk to anybody, John, to anybody!”
"We came because we wanted to," he repeated. "Even though you hadn't come, we had."
“Daddy! Papa! You know what?” She rocketed her way to the living room, throwing her backpack and coat to the floor. John scowled and looked reproachfully at Sherlock, who merely shrugged. He couldn’t deny Rosie had learnt that from him.
Lestrade watched him with narrowing his eyes.
"What's your solution, Sherlock?"
He patted his forehead.
It was Sherlock's turn to threaten him with his finger.
"I'd be lying if I didn't say that... when I knew you were coming for me, I remembered what we went through together in Afghanistan. When we got back to London I fantasized that... we could get that back. But looking at what you have now… I don't understand well why you came to rescue me".
"True. I remember Greg in his office, telling you over and over again to sit down and do the paperwork because you were limping, and you were signing the paperwork standing up, and Greg was crazy, asking me, but why doesn't he sit down?"
"Yes, I'm not going to do voices reading stories."
"To the station! What nonsense," she pursed her lips, clearly fed up with Molly. "All right, I'll wait for you here."
“How many suspects?” This time she spoke a little lower.
Sherlock sighed again.
"That's not possible. We investigated you when you started sharing the flat with my brother," objected Mycroft. His gesture of surprise turned quickly into anger. He looked at Anthea, who was looking back at him from the other side of the glass, visibly nervous, "how could that not be in Doctor Watson's report?"
Sherlock collapsed on John’s body, the two men gasping for air, Sherlock’s body shaking badly.
Sherlock grunted in pain, rolled over, stood, and shook his head to clear his mind from the blow, The guy waved his fists at him, waiting for him, smiling sadistically. A hundred and fifty kilos of pure muscle. The detective envisioned the man beating John, enjoying the pain he was inflicting, with a sadist smile. It wasn't the first time Sherlock saw it. His torturer in Serbia grinned in the same way.
The DI smiled warmly.
"Liar," chuckled John, though he knew the detective was partly right. Sherlock exhaled a contented hum, eyes closed, nose buried in John's neck. John kissed his hair and gently caressed his back with the palm of his hand, making the detective shudder.
“Your… your tongue”.
Lestrade handed him the paper on which there was only one sentence:
"He didn't invite her. It was me," Molly stepped in. "As Sherlock said, you don't have to worry about her. She is dating me".
"I let myself go. It will never happen again".
“Better?”
"That was my mistake."
“What is this, some kind of joke?”
John swallowed and started gasping. Lestrade stirred uncomfortably. May be he shouldn't have asked, but the writer seemed so sad…
“Sherlock, what did you do?” Mycroft muttered, truly worried.
The rest stared at him, surprised. The doctor hesitated for a few moments but dashed Mycroft, followed by his companions.
"That one! Can I take it home?"
"A perfect plan." he smiled.
"I will, don't worry."
John and Sherlock were curled up in one of the cots. Plainly speaking, they fell asleep, John on his back looking for the best position not be disturbed by the sling, and Sherlock lying on his side, glued to the doctor, a protective arm over his chest, avoiding the areas sore from the blows, hugging him as if John were indeed an enormous teddy bear. The detective, exhausted, slept soundly, but John, from the discomfort of the sling and the nightmares, only managed to doze off at times.
He muttered something. The Avengers and Sherlock pierced his ears, and the mumbled words came to them:
"Forget about our wedding being like this."
"Oh, of course, we do."
"But, even though he was not wounded, Clay's misdeeds had come to light, so he had to flee England, and took refuge somewhere remote in East Europe, where he met someone who, at that time, was creating a criminal network".
"We…" Donovan gestured to where Mycroft was standing, gazing at them silently, lips pursed, eyebrows raised.
"Greg, God, ngggggg, John, John stop him, I'll swear…" but, amazingly, Sherlock's cock started to get hard again.
“John, I’m trying to finish an experiment.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He chuckled at his own joke and disappeared through one of the doors.
“Why are you lucky?“ asked Donovan.
“That was before he started murdering twice a week. And, you know, the copycats.”
Mycroft couldn't hold back any longer and burst into tears, relieving the tension, fear, and anguish of the last few months. The DI let him cry, rubbing his back, stroking his hair, and pecking his stitched cheek from time to time.
The boy looked at him without answering.
"Leave me alone; don't take another step! I don't want to hear any more from you. Can't you think about anyone else but yourself? It's over, damn it, this is over. As soon as we get home... fuck, and I was complaining about Sherlock. Fucking Holmes..."
Sherlock moaned softly.
He grunted, sitting on the bed.
"Did you sell John for money?" he hissed, angry and hurt. "Do you know how long it will take him to regain the mobility of his shoulder? How long will it take him to recover psychologically?" his voice broke at the last word.
Sherlock threw him a warning look and then looked at the doctor. Mycroft grimaced, realizing his mistake. But it was too late.
"I read it by myself, idiot. But I assure you that cases will never be the same now I know you really don't think I'm an idiot, but…".
I apologize it took me so long to finish it, but finally, I achieved it".
"You are a soldier, just like me, and you know that if I have to shoot you, I will do it," John continued.
"Don't you like it?"
New nod.
Lestrade observed the plane behind Mycroft. An aircraft out of a science fiction movie. Highly streamlined shape, flat underside, short wings, and propellers integrated into the fuselage.
Sherlock took his hand, which the doctor squeezed with all his strength when Bill pricked him on the shoulder and gradually emptied the syringe's content into it.
"Irene?" asked the rest in unison.
"And there's no way to keep it?"
"Of course, I can."
"Fuck, you feel so good, so perfect," panted John, mercilessly hammering his prostate.
"Time to go," Bill announced.
The woman smiled and shook her head.
Sherlock stopped kneading to caress John, but the doctor put his hands back on the dough, thrusting his hips back and forth.
“You know people,” assured Sherlock. “You know in who you can trust to get you back home,” he caressed her hair, trying to calm her daughter “Remember what I taught you. But I promise you I’ll be back. This is only in case I’m late, ok? You are a brave girl. You could do it”.
An empty grave.
"yesss, mmmmmmm."
A slight nod of his head.
Sherlock moaned a yes, shooking his head with the intensity of the feeling.
John increased the speed of his finger inside and outside Sherlock and added another, pushing slowly and gently, to quickly adding a third one, curving them to find the detectives prostate. Sherlock's extremely erotic moans increased in volume as Anderson gobbled his cock as deep as he could, bobbing his head slowly up and down.
“She is a very clever little lady and very proud of his father.”
"I could never tell Rosie that now," muttered Mycroft, looking at Lestrade, who blinked, trying to hold back tears.
John's tongue moved down and slowly circled Sherlock's right nipple, without touching it, and Greg imitated him. Sherlock moaned harder this time, pulled the ropes, threw his head back, and arched his body. Greg looked in fascination with how Sherlock's cock got harder only with the anticipation of the touch.
"No... not at first. But Sherlock warned me that if you found out otherwise..."
He took the phone and put it in his boyfriend's hand, who looked at it as if he didn't know what it was.
The man nodded. They walked quickly through the empty mansion, reached the dungeon where Irene and Rosie had slipped into the panic room, crossed it and opened a door hidden in the wall. They went down a narrow spiral staircase about ten metres and came to a small door, just over a metre high. The man took out a bunch of keys and opened it.
There was an exasperated sigh on the other side of the line.
The detective frowned and pouted.
"Fuck. You."
“This book cannot exist,” she repeated, about to cry.
"Poor devil. Come on, then."
Other officers got near Sherlock's feet and took one on his hand. The detective pulled hard on his leg to break free from him.
Sherlock glared him and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. He had to calm down. He couldn't panic. He should protect Rosie.
Rosie listened to him with her eyes open, fighting the sleep that made her close her eyelids with Sherlock's voice rocking and lulling her between pages, paragraphs, and words.
“Your gorgeous cock…”
“A present?” gasped Moran, fear drawn in his face.
"It could be a trap," Sholto warned.
“Holy shit!” he screamed, his face blank. He run out of the office, barking orders to all the officers, and in less than five minutes he and Donovan were on Greg’s car, crossing London at full speed, sirens echoing along their path, followed for more than a dozen squad cars.
"Greg, nogggggggg!" he suddenly cried, as the DI, smiling wickedly, started licking and nibbling Sherlock's right nipple, making the oversensitive detective curse with words the DI had never heard even from the mouths of the most slumming criminals. This reaction, instead of discouraging Lestrade, only induced him to play with both nipples at the same time, pinching and rubbing them, hardening them as Sherlock strained the ropes so hard that they heard the headboard cracking.
Mycroft observed Clay, desperately trying to deduce something that might help them. He could not understand how he had been so far ahead of them. It would have been more like Moriarty if he had not been dead. But it was clear that Clay's strategies were borrowed from criminal consulting. And he, Mycroft, had taught him everything he knew. As if he had formed a second Moriarty.
“Are you from Scotland Yard?”
"Hey," protested Sherlock, and the others laughed.
Sherlock increased the pace a little, and then rubbed his thumb softly over the highly sensitive skin of their glands, cupping John's testicles with his other hand, gently squeezing them, making John sucking in a deep breath and stifled a growl. The doctor attempted to buck his hips, intensifying the contact between them and rubbing his cock against Sherlock's, but the detective blocked him.
"Out of a car, off a roof... I'd jump from anywhere to be with you." Sherlock smiled, softly kissing him back.
Holmes looked at Everett with crazy eyes.
"A genius, exactly" he looked at John, who smiled, delighted.
"That's enough," intervened Steve, getting in between them and pushing one on each side.
"For God's sake, Gregory, I asked you to keep an eye on him!" snarled Mycroft.
"That doesn't matter now. Do you have it? Would it work?" repeated Mark.
Mrs. Hudson pointed to the window. John got up, opened it  and almost had a heart attack when he saw thousands of journalists gathered at their door. When they saw him, they raised their microphones and began to bombard him with questions.
Almost as if answering his prayers, his phone vibrated with the tone of an incoming message.
He told Sherlock, and the detective nodded, his look lost in the sea.
Rosie giggled, delighted.
“The writer?” He looked at Donovan, bewildered. ”Is this your new line of research? Going out for dinner with Lestrade and with this ... this writer who only try to denigrate us?”
“You were always so easy to trick”.
Mycroft blinked. He would have given anything to be able to tell him. Finally he breathed in, defeated.
The detective shook his head slightly.
But somehow, being with Holmes rekindled his feelings for Strange. Holmes' and Strange's voices were so similar that he felt like he was listening to Stephen if he closed his eyes. So he shut his eyes when Holmes said he loved him madly, or when assured they would always be together, that nothing and nobody could separate them.
“E.at” mouthed John again, glancing at the children and then at his exasperating husband. Sherlock knew that look. Defying it wouldn’t be a wise decision, so sighing loudly, he started eating again, still checking his phone.
“We found the owners’ bodies buried in the land plot of the house. According to the first analysis, they were tortured before being killed”.
Both laughed, closing their eyes, enjoying the peace and the silence inside the car.
"I wish I had been there when Sherlock told you" chuckled Anthea.
"I will call the press conference. I will sign everything you want!" Mycroft shouted in desperation, raising his hands for the first time, shaking notoriously "please "he almost sobbed, his voice filled with fear.
"I wanna cry".
"Sherlock…"
Lestrade took his radio and asked for more Yard troops, while Mycroft barked orders over his phone.
"Is Sherlock all right?" was the first thing a worriedJohn asked, fearing the worst.
"So, you are now able to remember my name? This is going to last for hours until you come, mate".
“My daughter showed me the way.”
Rosie nodded, the scare giving way to a determined gesture. She took Irene's hand, and she squeezed it lovingly to give her courage, surprised by the girl's bravery, trying to stay calm, even being frightened by the gunfire sounds.
"I'm Geena. Nice to meet you, Doctor. Watson. I was a cook at Musgrave when William... sorry, Sherlock," she rectified when Sherlock glared at her, "was a boy. And who is this beautiful girl?"
“Sorry, kids, the baby won’t come now, but at dawn,” the children groaned in protest and some of them stood intending to go back to the camp. “I misunderstood John.”
The man watched at her, bewildered. He gazed at Anderson, who made an incomprehensible but blatantly obscene gesture towards Donovan. Dimmock rolled his eyes. Anderson was so stupid that he didn't bother to hide that if he continued in his position, it was only because he slept with the DI.
Rosie danced across the living room. Then run to pick up her backpack and grabbed a piece of paper.
Sherlock listened quietly. However it was done, it was clear the aim was to give false information to those who received the photographs:
And Sherlock obeyed, wondering why he was unable to disobey John’s commanding tone. Because he knew it was about John. Any other who would try to manhandle him like that would already be smashed against the wall or the floor, at the very least with his arm twisted by the elbow, to discourage him from keeping on giving orders to Sherlock. But all of his rebel nature dissolved at John’s side, feeling his body, listening to his voice, a strange and unknown pleasure flooding inside him as he let himself go and comply with the doctor’s orders.
She shook her head.
"Trust me, okay? Do you trust me?"
"I don't need anyone to take care of me," replied Sherlock, entering behind him.
A crater was created in each of the strips that were getting deeper and deeper, until connecting both universes by a kind of tunnel. The simulation advanced in time, and when the chronometer marked three hours, the tunnel broke in two.
Geena embraced the detective.
John nodded and closed his eyes, relaxing. A little later, Sherlock came into the bedroom, undressed, put on his pyjamas, got into bed, and cuddled up next to John.
Anthea was out of breath at the doctor's angry greeting. People used to be afraid of Sherlock, but she knew that the doctor was much more dangerous, with all his affable air. She knew this the day Mycroft ordered her to pick him up and take him to that deserted warehouse. Most people trembled at Mycroft Holmes' scrutinizing gaze and threatening air, but the doctor did not. Ignoring him as he checked his phone, getting angry with him, showing him that he was not afraid of him at all. He even allowed himself the boldness of saying, "
“How do you know that?” Greg repeated.
"What did you expect?"
"John, no!" shouted Sherlock, making Anthea and John stop in their tracks, their finger inches away from the decoder.
John was so enraged he could cry. Mad, disappointed, hurt... he had been an idiot for trusting Sherlock. Everyone, from Lestrade to the last rookie in the Yards, Mycroft, Molly..., almost everyone warned him.
"Do you think he' will ever get over it?"
The detective composed a gesture of innocence, but after a few seconds under his husband's scrutiny, he bit his upper lip, caught. It was just what he had planned, to leave them there and go to the castle by himself, to prevent more damage to John's shoulder. He dropped his shoulders, defeated.
"It took you longer than I thought to put all the pieces together, little brother. You're getting older,' whispered Mycroft, teasingly, but Sherlock didn't miss the note of deep sadness in his voice.
"I don't know exactly. Anthea contacted us because Sherlock left her some papers before flying to Afghanistan, and today I received his message about Mylo".
"We should start eating before the food gets cold," mediated Molly, fearing an escalation of bedroom secrets.
As always, I hope you enjoy it.
“Are you ready to play?” John shouted to the kids in his captain’s voice but adding a playful note on it.
"Okay, from now on, we'll limit romance to flowers and chocolates.
“As if you care.”
"It's not a question of power. It's my duty, Gregory. Because when I didn't control everything, my five-year-old sister threw Sherlock's best friend down a well, or set fire to the family home with my little brother in it, trying to kill him, or Sherlock got addicted, or …"
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Everyone survived, everyone except Mike. Missing in action. Days and days of fruitless searching until, in the end, they left him for dead. But nightmares continued to haunt John.
“Yes, thanks.”
“You could find another job.“ Donovan couldn’t help feel pity for the man.
The man wrapped in the tent should have heard him, because he started shouting and trashing again, making both men walked towards Sherlock, who, totally covered by mood, proved to be almost invisible in the darkness. So the detective let the man wiggle and muffle, and waited until both criminals almost tripped over him. Then the detective stood up and hit one of them on the lower valley of the throat, making him chock and, blocking the other’s punch with his forearm, threw an uppercut to his jaw under his chin. The man fell to the ground. He turned around and gave a jab to the other’s man temple, who also got unconsciousness. Then he moved both knocked out men next to the others, gagged and tied them up, getting sure they couldn’t escape. Finally, panting and grunting for the effort, he hauled all the bodies near a big tree at around fifty meters from the camp. He didn’t want the kids to see them.
“I know” responded again Sherlock, stepping back, trying to stop John’s advance.
“Friends’ camp!” repeated Rosie, though her face started to show disappointment. Clearly, their parents didn’t share her enthusiasm.
"I'm sorry for you, Aunt Irene. But it's not Daddy's fault. You give him a hard time when you do that. And, although he doesn't say anything, I know Papa suffers, knowing that you give Daddy a hard time."
You, readers, are all the best
Exhausted, he lay down on the floor, trying to catch his breath when he heard a yelp and some whines of pain mixed with growls and howls.
"You shouldn't take everything for granted, Mycroft Holmes," she shouted, annoyed. "Years ago, I was like you."
"John Clay and Anthony started working for Mycroft at the same time. The first one as a member of the MI6 reporting directly to him and Anthony as his assistant".
Mycroft turned to look at Sherlock, but his seat was empty.
They both giggled, and kept up with the torturing pace for a while, until John couldn't hold back any longer, and started fucking Sherlock with long, forceful thrusts, pistoning his hips harder and deeper inside the detective arse. Greg also speeded up the pace of his strokes and bent from time to time to lick the tip of Sherlock's cock, without forgetting about torturing his nipples.
"No, eat it. You are going to need it" Sherlock looked at him, questioningly. He smiled mischievously, making Sherlock's cock throb. "We still have a lot of non-celebrated birthdays to honor."
"It's not exactly a medieval castle, as you are picturing, with battlements, moat, and all that. We used to call it like this when we were little because it has red conical roofed towers and we spent some summers there. But it's big enough and has enough nooks and crannies to make it perfect for this stunt."
"Good morning, gentlemen, lady, Sherlock, Doctor Watson…"
"Do they play movies?" Donovan asked, rolling his eyes.
“What? Ten corps, double murders, and we have not arrested anyone? Do we not even have any suspects?
The doctor stirred in his chair, uneasy. He swirled the teaspoon inside his cup, without looking at her. Mrs. Hudson sipped her tea and waited.
"I don't know, I swear, I don't know it. He didn't tell us".
John took time to look at the people around them, and he was able to recognize Mrs. Hudson (the landlady never ceased to amaze him. What the hell was she doing in a stag party?), and people who Sherlock and he helped along with their cases. There were also people he didn't know, probably from cases solved by Sherlock before meeting him, like Angelo, who had prepared the catering for the night. John shook his head, looking at Sherlock, a bit disconcerted.
“Will you be able to go back to the camp?”
“Don’t worry, Rosie, he won’t move,” assured John, smiling at her.
"John would never forgive me for not taking care of you," he threw a heavy backpack at him, which Sherlock picked up in the air.
The door opened, and the pathologist disappeared behind it. Instead of going home, Donovan went to a bar where many taxi drivers usually met before starting their night shift, not far from Baker Street. She stopped the vehicle, got into it, bought a sandwich and a drink, and got back into the cab seat.
"Oh, come on, Lestrade, you knew from the start."
Sherlock was knelt near the victim, observing the woman’s neck with his magnifying glass.
John stood and moved to him, who was still near the door, as the others looked at Sherlock, amused.
John hesitated. Putting his life on the line was one thing. But those of his friends...
He spilled a little more wine, this time on Sherlock's hips, that dripped down to his swimsuit. Slowly, he drew with his tongue the shape of Sherlock's cock through the fabric, starting at the testicles, following the shaft and ending at the tip, flicking his tongue on it, feeling it swelling and throbbing at his touch.
"What did you expect? A dungeon? I'm saving that for..." Irene stopped at the pathologist's warning gaze. "Mandy, one of my assistants, is a mother, and from time to time, she leaves her daughter here. That's why I have all this... stuff."
“Papa, you cannot move from here, ok?”
“Are you coming with me?”
"Sending" answered Anthea.
"Look out!"
"You were great!" Mycroft's assistant clapped her hands in excitement when they walked in, as Mrs. Hudson turned on herself and bowed.
“Oh, you do, you truly do. You know what? I should run to the Chief Supervisor and tell him that you are so incompetent that you need external consultancy. At least, that is what you tell him when I, coincidentally, proposed something similar while we were dealing with the serial suicides case, in order to get it solved. You said that I needed external advice due to my lack of skills as DI.” Lestrade was panting hard, anger bubbling inside him. Finally he shook his head, feeling battered. “And now you want John Watson to be some kind of consultant, like Sherlock Holmes in his novels, though in them, he is the world only consulting detective.”
"We must move," Thor ordered, "the spell will not last long here."
Lestrade shook his head.
John chuckled viciously. He sat Sherlock on the carrying bag, and adjusted the restraints to his wrists and ankles and placed his feet into the stirrups, so the detective was bound with his legs obscenely spread, his magnificent ass cheeks wrapped in nylon, his arms raised over his head. The detective felt exposed and vulnerable, but it was so extremely erotic that his cock was about to explode.
He only took it off when he started to coincide with Lestrade in the crime scenes.
They got silent, passing the cigarette to each other, lying on the dune, legs stretched out on the ground, relaxed for the first time in days.
“You were magnificent yesterday, John. Sherlock is very fortunate in having you at his side”.
After cursing and threatening them with all sorts of gruesome deaths, Sherlock tried in vain to break the bulletproof glass or deactivate the electric locks. Finally, accepting he could not escape, he decided to flee to his Mental Palace to endure the wait.
Mike ran his hand down the sleeve, almost with reverence.
"Of course, no," sighed John. "Sherlock will be on his way here by now."
Natasha narrowed her eyes.
The detective sat there, folded legs glued to his chest, arms around his legs, staring at a fixed point on the wall. His face didn't express the slightest emotion. He hasn't said a word; moved an inch o eaten or drunk anything of what an increasingly worried Mycroft had offered him since they arrived at the hospital's waiting room.
A minute later, he also came with an explosive orgasm, thrilled by the idea of coming inside that pedantic prick's mouth, of filling it with his cum, making the detective swallow it until Anderson's orgasmic spasms ceased, finally taking it out of his mouth.
At Baker Street, at Irene's mansion and the warehouse everyone looked at each other in bewilderment, police officers and artificers included. What the hell did that mean? And even more so when listening to Mycroft's words.
"No way, mate," protested John.
Clint and Bruce looked at each other, as Peter looked at them, hopefully.
"All right, let's get it over with," he muttered through his teeth.
"Where is Mycroft Holmes' office?" she quacked at the top of her lungs.
John felt that he was short of breath. He gave him an incendiary look.
“John, you are not going to… aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh”
They came back to the house, where a taxi was waiting for them, their luggage already in the boot.
Sherlock threw him the
The walkie crackled at that moment, and Sholto put the phone away.
"Beginner's luck," grunted the billionaire.
"Sherlock, what you and John have is so incredible that even you can't spoil it."
"It's… that's different. I always knew how I felt about John".
"You're insane," he managed to say amidst laughter.
Soon after, the Captain forced the five ex-prisoners to get into the truck to rest, while the others lay on the sand or explored the surroundings.
He jumped up when he noticed Greg's lube-soaked finger rolling down the entrance of his ass; then, he shoved it in.
The woman smiled, grateful.
Tony turned to Sherlock slowly, clenching his fist, ready to activate the Bleeding Edge armor's fist and reduce that insolent know-it-all to ashes in an instant. He stepped forward.
John shouted a “YES!”, raised his arms in victory and ran around the table, like an athlete doing the lap of honour, weaving his hand, greeting an invisible crowd around him, throwing kisses to the air.
"Thank you, Sherlock."
“When did the vampire start killing twice a week?” asked Donovan
Sherlock didn't want to check his forearm. But he didn't feel any longer the pain. He felt relieved.
Finding that the water was useless, his torturers changed tactics and brought in a huge man with a cruel smile who hit him with all his might. Soon, the massive man lost his smile, exchanging it for a supreme gesture of anger and frustration. He was accustomed to make his victims scream in pain or beg for mercy. Still, the stubborn blond soldier made not the slightest sound at the rain of blows he unleashed upon him. Sometimes he even looked at him defiantly, raising an eyebrow as if to say,
"But, as I said before, my brother is under several arrest warrants. And I don't think a Chinese old wives' tale or Einstein's discoveries will help him with that", he ended on a sour note.
“Detective inspector?"
He stood up and assumed a fighting stance, cautiously circling the man. The man threw a storm of punches, trying to reach the detective. Instead of counteracting them, Sherlock simply ducked or blocked the blows, trusting his fast catlike reflexes and taking his time to scan the man. Jaundice for a liver close to cirrhosis caused by excess alcohol. Oedematous wrists due to renal failure because of dehydration. Swollen knees for lack of cartilage due to overexertion…
Lestrade couldn't imagine all the suffering accumulated under that mask of disdain and pretence of not feeling anything it. He never lacked a friend, someone with whom to share a pint, share his worries, someone to help him get through those moments when everything seemed to be falling apart around him.
"Do you remember when you started going out?" he asked.
Four of the SAS members, the homeless, Mycroft, Lestrade, and Sholto, turned inward, gazing in amazement at the open graves, noting, as Sherlock did, they had always been empty.
"What am I?" purred Greg in his ear.
"Fair point."
"Well, for once, he wasn't too far off track. You'd started working out. More horizontal, but exercise."
“Brilliant.“ Muttered John. Sherlock’s left commissure turned up. He loved when John said that.
"A little paw is moving!" cried the girl, incredulous and exhilarated.
"First, you have to tell me what it's about."
"Fighting with Mycroft."
"John, I don't want anyone... more than you... I couldn't stand..."
"You watched the recording. FRIDAY confirmed it. Even his brother believes it was him, judging the way he talks." countered Steve.
"FRIDAY says the opposite," grunted Tony.
"Thank goodness you've come."
John bit his lower lip.
“Are you sure?” said John, slowly standing.
Lestrade was in his office, giving his team a briefing about the current case. Around him were Anderson and five more officers that where helping him to solve it. He wasn’t planning to arrive at the office so soon, but as Donovan called him last night saying she wouldn’t be able to go to work due to a bad cold, he changed his mind. A briefing with the team would give the case a boost.
But all of it disappeared when Sherlock put the book down, stood up, and gracefully ran towards them through the sand.
John moaned when he finally felt Sherlock's entrance on his cock's tip and tried to buck his hips again unsuccessfully due to the strap that locked up his hips. Instead of going down, Sherlock, attached to the bar, was caressing the tip of John's cock with his crack, playing with it, letting it go in a little, and then coming back up. Sherlock's hole felt terrific, but John needed more; he needed to sink his cock once and for all into Sherlock's ass and fuck him wildly.
Tony laughed out loud and walked away, leaving Natasha, Clint, Bruce, and Steve to say goodbye to him.
"And why didn't you tell him?"
John looked at Sherlock, who shrugged.
“Anticoagulant?”
"I thought the game was never over."
"Boring"
Thirty minutes later, Sherlock found himself in an alley he never thought to set foot in again.
"They love you very much."
"It seems that we have been left alone," he mused and closed his eyes. Could someone be more stupid?"
John Watson met Greg Lestrade and share confidences
"Aunt Lori?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and looked at her, but didn’t say anything.
They walked silently, at a good pace, only accompanied by the sound of their breathing and their footsteps in the gravel on the ground, until they reached a wall with wooden crossbeams nailed up.
"From now on, I don't want any sound until I tell you, got it?
"I'm sorry to bring this up, but…"
"But today he's marrying you," he said softly.
The man mumbled.
Sholto and the homeless stopped behind him, desolate. They were joined by the SAS, who just got out of the truck. Lestrade approached Sherlock and put his hand on his shoulder.
Meanwhile, Stephen summoned two blades, throwing one to Sherlock and the other to Natasha, while wrapping Ironman's armor in a spell, so he could fight spirits.
John chuckled.
"We need a parapet," answered John.
"Years of Academy training...wasted!!" sobbed John between waves of laughter, letting himself be dragged down by Sherlock.
John grinned with Sherlock's cock in his mouth, enjoying his tortured loud moans. His licking, though incessant, was slow and light, while softly stroking his shaft, taking his time, caressing the already hardened cock in the way he knew ignited Sherlock's body.
"I'm not exaggerating one bit," replied Geena without turning around. Sherlock raised the right corner of his lip while John looked at her in surprise. "Do you remember when I made chocolate cake or pies?" She turned to John." Always flitting around. It was impossible to finish the cake without him taking chocolate, cookies, or condensed milk. He was like a cat. Before you knew it, he had fled with the loot."
“I didn’t do anything"
“Why didn’t you tell me about him on the first day?”
Sherlock left the toast on the plate and watched John silently for a few minutes. The doctor let him do. He knew that look. He wasn't deducing him but pondering possible John's answers to a question.
Just as the owner promised, the hangar was quite hidden, a former client whom Sherlock helped to prove innocent of his wife's death, as everyone (especially Anderson) thought. The assailant had attacked and killed her just before he got home, and when the police and paramedics showed up, everyone assumed that he had been the perpetrator.
The doctor was now licking the detective’s perineum, slowly travelling towards his balls, as Sherlock’s cock, totally hard again, started leaking precum. His tongue moved back to his ass, and John breathed lightly on his hole’s skin, exhaling warm breath and then blowing a bit, making Sherlock’s body quiver and groan.
"Sherlock, that's enough," John cut him off, anticipating that the detective would say something that would make
John rubbed his face. He was tired after the long walk towards the house carrying Tommy. When they arrived, there was none in the house, so he had to wait for the owners to get back to the house. Happily, in a garden shed, he found a first aid kit, so he could wrap Tommy’s ankle and dress his forehead wound.
The others nodded. Sherlock looked at him, worried.
"I hope you don't mind, Rosie, but I liked the dress you chose so much that I wanted to wear it."
“I have a lot of work.”
Wandering, she reached the loneliest area of the fair. At the bottom of one narrow and short alley, she noticed a kind of kiosk decorated with alchemical symbols. The wind played with her hair, and leaves fluttered on the floor. Sally approached it, glad to get away from the hustle and bustle of the people. Behind the glass, she saw a mannequin bust dressed in an oriental turban, black eyes, mustache and goatee. A fortune-teller or a wizard, she thought. A name, Zoltar, wrote in big purple letters above the man. Piqued by curiosity, she read the instructions.
Lestrade looked at her, speechless.
His mouth reached the tip of John's cock again, swirled his tongue along the frenulum's edge, moaning in pleasure, making John moan harder.
"Why?" he whispered. "Why, Mycroft? Why did you have to send him? Why couldn't you leave us alone?"
'And now, what do you suggest, genius?", he askef sourly.
Lestrade was desperate. Two weeks after Moriarty’s attack to NSY headquarters, nobody had a clue about where John and Sherlock could be. He had phoned both of them hundreds of times, leaving all kinds of messages, since threatening to beg ones, anything to finally be able to contact them. But he hadn’t any response, not even from John, who had always answered him. He, as Molly, was sick of concern.
Irene was combing Rosie's hair in two braids. When Anthea called her, warning them not to go out of the panic room under any circumstances, she realised something was really wrong, something related to the men's departure. A trap.
"We will not be able to accompany you," the Captain's tone and the faces of his men, reflected disappointment. "But, we can inform you of any abnormal movements in the area."
******
"Stark, you couldn't be more untimely," grunted Everett, throwing him a murderous look that didn't scare the billionaire in the least, who chuckled, mockingly, though happy that those two fools would finally be able to confess their feelings.
And he could deny it boosted his ego the more or less dissimulates attempts of both men and women flirting with him, making him feel attractive and young.
"You didn't have to kill him," groaned Everett, looking at the man's lifeless body who Homest just shot in the forehead to take his car away from him. "Just with showing him the gun, he would have given it to you. You can't go around killing people."
"Are you sure?" he asked in a hoarse voice.
The nurse looked at Bill, not knowing what to do. The pain must have been unbearable for the man, but he kept struggling with him to get to the phone. The blood loss and pain weakened him, but it was still not easy to keep him in bed.
"Sssssssssh," shushed Holmes, "It's okay, it's all right now. We could start a new life, far from here. A new starting, where no one knows us".
"Repeat that," ordered the detective suddenly.
"And now she's going to draw whatever she wants with a non-permanent whiteboard pen."
"I know."
She looked at the woman who wrung her hands nervously. Her eyes were red and puffed as if she had been crying, and her appearance indicated that she wasn't in her right mind. The receptionist flashed her most professional smile, cursing to herself, praying that this scruffy old woman would not be the problem of the day.
John laughed, like the others, but he froze when the image of what Bill just said filled his mind. He shook his head, but the vision of some else's hands running over Sherlock's body made him boil with fury.
Mike left the beer on the table, not yet believing entirely he was there, surrounded by his old friends, instead of the desert of Afghanistan or some lost place in East Europe, working as a mercenary for Clay.
Sherlock looked like he was about to burst with pride. John's face, apart from a similar pride as the detective, also showed absolute stupefaction.
“You promised me that if I helped you to achieve to be DI we would have sex in your office, and that it would be the best sex of my life.”
"That's what we have to find out now."
"Until now, two or more realities could share the same space without being visible to each other, each in a dimension," answered Stephen, "with the inter-dimensional boundaries blurred, both dimensions will come into contact."
Irene looked at the monitor collecting the image from the security cameras outside. Several black cars and vans had parked in front of the house, and several men with battering rams were preparing to break down the door. The rest, armed and barricaded behind the cars, responded to fire from their security team's weapons. She opened a drawer, picked up a gun, opened the magazine to make sure it was loaded, and run, holding Rosie's hand.
John knew the detective wasn't talking about coming.
But with that inexhaustible capacity to surprise Sherlock, John not only not found them hideous, but managed to transform them into happy memories. Thus, one that had a staggered shape (John forced himself not to think about what the torturers used to leave that scar on his back) represented when, on the night of John's stag party, they both drunkenly slipped down the stairs. Another slightly curved one, when both laughed in the lobby after chasing the cab, and so on.
Watson stirred in his seat. Why didn't the man leave him alone?
"They are fine," gasped John.
He lowered his head and spoke almost to himself.
"If I see anything I don't like, I'll kick your ass home, understand, Detective?"
Mycroft let out a shy laugh.
“Serial suicides? But that case was solved! The taxi driver!”
“Thanks a lot for your help, Mycroft”.
Until the muzzle flashed in his head, John meant it was Sherlock Holmes' grave; the same Mycroft built after his fake suicide.
“The teacher gave me this list for you.”
“The freak! Sherlock Holmes!”
"Interpol has issued an international arrest warrant for you, and the FBI has located you in New York, so..."
“Why, Rosie?”
"But if he knew that you knew... why did he use it as a password?"
“I’m not tanned,” he growled.
"Well, it's our wedding weekend. I can't think of a better moment to…
*****
Sholto chuckled
“They are idiots. Ignore them. I’ll go with you to the camp”.
"Does Anthea know what to do?"
The doctor growled when Sherlock’s tongue licked his balls and made a chocked grunt when he felt Sherlock’s mouth around his cock. They both got involved in a battle to make the other come first. Sherlock bobbed his head up and down, and licked the shaft from the root to the tip, circling the glans, obliging John to open his mouth to moan loudly. The detective felt the doctor’s balls tense and cried, trying to put as much as possible of the doctor’s cock in his mouth, sure to gain the battle, when John shoved a finger inside Sherlock’s arse and rubbed his prostate.
She tried to close the door, angry, but Molly stopped her and climbed up beside her, upset.
"Nope, it's our wedding, remember? We have to follow the tradition," mocked the doctor, walking out of the room.
"They don't hold steady," whispered Bruce, impressed and defeated. Sherlock was right.
“He was going to kill you, little brother, and I couldn’t allow it. I told you that since the very moment you discovered he was a werewolf, I would terminate him if he tried to hurt you” Mycroft coldly.
Lestrade and the others turned to him in terror. The DI put a little more pressure on Clay's throat, then released. For the first time in his life, he felt like killing a man. He had done it in his job, but always in self-defence or to avoid a crime, but this guy had something dark and poisonous inside that raised his killing instincts.
The dog followed the girl docilely to her parents. John stroked his head as the animal sniffed the sling.
"I just told you."
Two officers started licking the detective's cock, roaming up and down, around and under and over the shaft, making Sherlock gasp and moan, jolting his hips, shocked by the feel of two mouths in his cock, without taking his eyes from Sally's menacing dildo.
“According to several studies, around thirty percent of the world’s population, around three billion people in the world”.
He needn't tell Sherlock there was something special between him and Mike, the detective figured it out himself. John and Mike were not in love; he never felt for him the way he felt for Sherlock. Still, there was a very special connection between them, reinforced by sharing dangerous situations, long nights on call, surveillance missions, and nights of sex which Sholto joined from time to time and, if he was drunk enough, Bill.
"Did you enjoyed it?" asked the detective nervously.
"Don't worry; there won't be anyone else but me."
Sherlock remained silent, but John knew he'd got his attention.
"Thanks, love. For taking care of me, for putting up with me, "Sherlock waved his hand, dismissively. "No, I know I haven't been the easiest patient in the world. I don't know how I can ever thank you".
“Doctor Watson and I have a matter to attend. Gregory, could you bring Sherlock to the hospital?”
"Of course, at the moment they knew we were to fetch John, they volunteered."
He tried to swallow again. His throat was burning, and his body was screaming for water.
"He is with Moran, Sebastian Moran," he sobbed "it's all that I know, I swear it."
?), reverberating in the water was fuckingly sexy. Since he was humming a romantic song (where Sherlock learned it was a mystery for the doctor), it made both John's heart and cock almost explode. Moreover, Sherlock started singing:
He gently nibbled the tip of his cock, making Greg's whole body contract with pleasure. Just when he felt his victory close at hand, the rings around his glans and his balls began to vibrate, sending spasms of pleasure through his whole body, his impossible orgasm invading every corner him, and, unable to control it, Mycroft opened his mouth to make an incoherent moan, releasing Lestrade's cock, which laughed in his teeth.
"No. Remember Mycroft's documents. Satellites located and controlled a military motorcade, and there was no trace of John or the others. It was the same as with the photos. Diversionary manoeuvring. They moved lots of cars, and lots of men, making a great deal of noise and dust, focusing everyone's attention. A magician's trick. While you look at one hand, you don't see what's going on with the other. The caravan was the decoy. Meanwhile, John and the others would be discreetly taken away. On horseback or riding camels, their captors. On foot the prisoners, under the desert sun, without water, without food... all to weak them physically and mentally, to later bend them more quickly". Sherlock's tone became darker as he spoke, his face contracted with fury, and his gaze became murderous, imagining John treated that way.
"Surprise!" cried John, Molly, Greg, Mrs. Hudson, and Mycroft.
"You made him think you wanted to make up for telling him about the restaurant. You knew that John felt so bad about it that he would do anything to redeem himself. Saving Mike, he would redeem himself in both my and in his eyes. That's why he accepted it almost blindly, giving it all up, turning a deaf ear to my warnings".
Stephen took another step towards Everett, who imitated him, and the two were face to face. The ex-CIA agent hesitated for a few moments, but when he noticed Stephen took a breath to continue singing, he joined him, both mentally thanking Roy Orbison for putting into words what they had had so much trouble saying:
"It's not a drawing."
"We've found the bomb. A child is sitting on it," replied the doctor.
"Give them to Sherlock. And tell him to take it easy. If he keeps solving cold cases at this rate, I'll have to ask Interpol for more".
Suddenly the notes from the song
"Please, don’t…“ Donovan syllabled.
"I do sleep," protested Sherlock.
"Peter..." Tony reconvened. That would not end well.
"Find something to keep him warm, a blanket, whatever!" John ordered, and Rob y Patrick flew to the castle. He took out his shirt and pressed it on Sherlock's back to control the bleeding "Sholto, call an ambulance! We need to get him to a hospital! "he examined Sherlock's injuries "Fortunately, that bugger didn't go through the marrow".
"Okay, put him on".
"I want to talk to Mycroft Holmes," insisted the landlady.
Rosie nodded. She looked at her father's sling, and her lower lip trembled and her eyes filled with tears. She knew his shoulder must have hurt a lot if he had put it on. He hated it.
Sherlock nodded slightly. He took a couple of breaths, drank some water, and forced himself to smile and loosen the muscles in his face.
Suddenly he was panting, leaning on the wall, giggling.
And John complied. He grabbed the headboard and started thrusting into Sherlock faster and deeper, the detective grunting in pain, moaning in pleasure and arching off the bed, to feel John’s cock even deeper. Then John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock, pumping it at rhythm with his hips, as Sherlock groans, gasps and moans got louder and louder, engulfed by the wave of pleasure that spread along his body, almost unbearable, but so delicious that he wished it lasted forever, making him feel renewed, free, loved and alive until, crying John's name in pure ecstasy, he came hard, holding onto John as he shivered and jerked, twisting and gasping as his muscles protested for the sudden strain.
At halfway, Sherlock realized the kids hadn’t eaten anything yet, so he made them stop and they ate their sandwiches in the wood under the shade of the trees.
"Don't get too excited. I'm waiting for your explanation. And if it's not good, I'll beat the crap out of you."
But before they could recover, a new bumper appeared:
"When I inherited the house, I had no reason to soundproof it."
“Hey!” Anderson protested,” if the culprit leaves no trace, we cannot find anything.”
Stephen would give anything to make Everett notice him, love him with the same intensity he loved Ross. But his magic, like the rest of the universe, had two limitations: love and death. Nothing, not even the most potent of myriads, could change them. Stephen knew this well. He spent hours in the New York sanctum looking for some spell to make Everett's feelings for him change. But magic couldn't fight the free will that love implies.
And there was he, almost biting his nails, giving one puff after another to the umpteenth cigarette of the day. Yes, because after the monsters faded in the air, he took a dumped chair, straightened it out, sat on it, and took out a cigarette from his jacket. He lighted it up and had a deep puff, slowly exhaling the smoke. Even Donovan, who had nagged him for started smoking again, ended asking for another cigarette.
"What's going on, Major? Look at me for fuck's sake!" he bellowed, grabbing his arm and forcing the man to turn around.
"But, I would have kidnapped John, not Ross," Sherlock muttered.
The image jumped to the Sherlock, John, and Rosie, happily jumping into the air, expanding their legs and arms in a large "X" shape in the air. When they were at the height of the jump, they shouted I'm a STAR!, making Rodie giggling.
Holmes shook his head, his gaze jumping from Everett to Ross. Even Everett pitied the detective for a moment. His face reflected tremendous confusion, deep pain; he felt lost, despondent, desperate, maddened by losing the love of his life.
John shook his head and smiled in spite of himself.
As if he hadn't had a hard enough time when Sherlock was kidnapped during the case. It wasn't his fault; that was true. For once, he didn't go ahead to catch up with the killer on his own, leaving John and Lestrade behind. He settled into his stride and took up the rear of the line, with the nervous, uneasy air of a thoroughbred whose jockey is pulling hard on the reins, restraining him from bolting before the home straight. And that restraint so threw him off his concentration that he didn't see the guy coming who knocked him unconscious and dragged him into an abandoned cellar.
“My last boyfriend enjoyed skeet shooting. It was really boring to merely look at him while he shot, so I decided to learn.”
Frustrated, fuming, disappointed and hurt, John couldn't understand why Sherlock returned there. To be honest, he hadn't let him explain either, shouting at him that he didn't want to listen to him every time the detective opened his mouth to answer until a  nurse threatened to kick John out of the hospital if she heard him shout again.
"Are you insane?"
“A fucktoy” spat John.
"Git" he snorted.
“That you are grateful to him”.
"What is a drop?" Clay asked theatrically, ignoring him, walking in a circle around the courtyard as if it were a stage, opening his arms while declaiming "Nothing. No one notices it. But a drop falling again and again and again can pierce the rock. And I am the drop that will destroy you, Mycroft Holmes. This time I will break you into such small pieces that you will never be able to get back together".
"Was it after the fire that they started calling him Sherlock?"
“How many do you want?”
"Rob' he called, and the tallest of the homeless squatted up to him. "What do you think?" he asked, giving it to him.
When the living dead was about to pull up Lestrade's throat, something swooshed the air, and the zombie's head rolled on the ground. Amazed, Lestrade contemplated Sherlock's coat flapping over him.
Sherlock was in the kitchen, replacing the material for his experiments according to his order. His face was covered with cuts hidden by little plasters, his nose was red and swollen, as well as his right eye, totally shut due to the swelled eyelids and several cuts reddened his lips.
Geena cleared her throat, looking behind her back. John turned and saw Rosie, looking at the three of them inquisitively, frowning, Sherlock’s book in her little hands. Geena and Bart moved to the kitchen.
They opened the suits bags and gasped. In each one, a stylish Midnight Navy Blue suit in wool, with a white shirt and pearl-grey tie, black belt, and cuff links.
"I don't know. Surgery? Witchcraft?" he frowned. "What if Strange created it? He is the Supreme Sorcerer. I'm sure he can do that."
"Hence your trust issues," muttered Mycroft.
John raised a finger as a warning. Lestrade laughed and got up from the chair.
She even stoically endured Sherlock smashing the flat, muttering it needed a makeover, though it had only been rebuilt two years ago, after Eurus's drone visit.
The doctor moaned hard when Sherlock, in revenge, managed to give a particularly hard thrust inside him.
The detective stiffened.
“My dear sergeant, I have jurisdiction in all the cases I want to. Get him to the helicopter” he ordered to four men in black suits that lifted the blooding knocked out man and carried him to a black van waiting in the entrance.
In fact, they shouldn’t be surprised to hear someone moaning at Baker Street since Doctor Watson’s fame of being fairly active sexually was well known in NSY.
Sherlock laughed, tears filling his eyes.
"Nothing more pleasant than a good dungeon to start the day," Bill mused.
Mrs. Holmes' sigh needed no translation.
The next time he came down, John grabbed him and slowly pushed his cock inside Sherlock, groaning and closing his eyes at the detective hole's warmness around his big hard cock.
John walked over and hugged her. After all these years, when he thought it was unbelievable, Harry finally confronted her alcohol addiction. She admitted herself to a rehab center recommended by Sherlock and paid without complaint by Mycroft. Of course, if there was one thing John could not blame his future brother-in-law for, he was stingy with him or his family.
"He wants to talk to you", he said to John, making a gesture towards the patrol car where Mike had just been put.
"No, please, there's just one more thing, mate, one more thing: one more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don't... be," his voice broke and filled with tears "dead. Would you do...? Just for me. Just stop it. Stop this", he begged, gesturing down at the grave.
"Wha..." Donovan left the question on the air and read the WhatsApp message that had just come in. She frowned, worried.
They nodded, smiling. John stepped aside to make room for him and offered him a coffee.
Sherlock bit his lower lip. He felt nervous. When he thought about asking it John, he was sure the doctor would say no. John, noticing it, smirked, got up, took his hand, and led them to the basement. They both slid down the bar to it.
Somehow, looking at him clouded his thinking like it had never happened before.
But John's dominant nature was still there. He knew that the detective's preorgasmic brain would not register it at that point, so he crawled down inch by inch. He didn't need to move much—just a little.
"I'd rather have Sherlock pick her up. I'll walk you to the door. Rosie, you can gossip through the drawers and make a mess of everything, as if you were in your room."
"You can see it by yourselves."
Then John placed his tongue on the asshole very lightly and wiggle it up and down or side to side very quickly. The detective growled, his tights trembling, as the doctor swirled his tongue around the hole in a circle, a small circle at first, making it slightly bigger in a spiral movement, until he stopped and did it in reverse, tracing the circle sometimes quick, sometimes killing slowly.
“Go…. to ahhhhhhhhhhhhh hell John, oh myyyyyyyyyyy”
Sherlock groaned.
"Why do you say it has to do with Doctor Watson?"
Before Moran could realize what was happening, Sherlock stood, grabbed Moran’s shirt and gave him a header in his nose with all his strength, making Moran howl in pain and bumble back, his hands covering his bleeding nose. Gasping for air, he stuck his tongue out, an animalistic and cruel smile in his face.
The DI turned to look at John, now sat on the bed. Seeing him naked, Greg wondered why he hid that muscular body beneath those horrible jumpers. His stomach, chest, and back were well built, his tanned skin contrasted with Sherlock's paleness in a perfect and sensual match, and his only semi-hard long and thick cock seemed intimidating to Greg.
Wong shook his head amidst the others' chuckles.
"Don't be so melodramatic, dear brother mine. I was teaching you to write with both hands and in both directions, to help you to develop both your brain hemispheres equally".
He wanted to get there before the others and see where the fault was. He came to the alley and looked at his watch. About ten minutes before the others arrived, precisely a quarter of an hour before the Sherlock from the previous timeline appeared in the alley. He bit his lips, guilty. He noticed Sherlock's anguished face, the fear of losing everything, so intense that not even the detective, with his exceptional ability to hide his feelings and act detached from them, could disguise.
The man nodded, ecstatic, leaving the book on the table.
"There's nowhere she's safe. They control everything. Absolutely everything, everyone, everywhere. This is why I let Rosie stay with Molly".
Lestrade felt his cock growing quickly inside his trousers. The image of Sherlock tied up while was relentlessly fucked hard and fast by John, being totally at his mercy, was more that he could stand. He had to resort to all his willpower for not unzip his trousers and start masturbating right there.
"It's a joke," he got serious and laughed again. "Next stop, 221b Baker Street."
"ohhhhhhh, yessssssssss, mmmmmmm."
John looked at the walls, dug into the earth, shored up with wood, and entered the tunnel behind the detective, followed by his friends. The air was not thin, so there must have been some hidden ventilation holes.
"Since you're scolding my little brother for faking his death, you might as well do it for jumping out of a moving car for you."
“Give me a minute”.
"And you believed them?" Sherlock looked at him with his eyes filled with tears. "Fuck, Mycroft! It's Serbia! She's four years old, and she is in London,  alone and defenseless! Don't you realize you've done just what they intended? How could you be so stupid?"
He threw the shield, making the spirits that he found in his path vanish, describing a circular orbit around him, to return to his hands. He threw it back to Thor's laughter, who was handing out commandos with the axe. The multiple Stephens bundled groups of ghosts with whips, while Natasha, after coiling herself into one of Strange's lashes, threw her sword at Sherlock and fought body to body against them, tackling and knocking them to the ground, turning, jumping, ducking, dodging spirits and crushing those who came at them.
"But Mr. Holmes doesn't read his blog..."
The teenager ran to the detective, staring at him with the same excitement John showed when he met the Avengers. He turned to John.
Thor hurled himself to where Steve had disappeared, wielding Stormbreaker hard, knocking out spirits and throwing them left and right, opening a gap for the captain.
"We are in no hurry," replied Sherlock.
You ALL are amazing, readers!!!
"Mr. Holmes is not in," repeated the receptionist, stubbornly.
"My computer?"
"Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock, haven't you learned to shut your big mouth yet?" he chanted, approaching him. "You always were such an unbearable busybody... I know you never liked me. But, so that you can see that I don't hold a grudge against you, I brought you a souvenir" he said, smiling cruelly.
James looked at them critically, while Sherlock displayed documents on his desk, letting James do at will. It was good for Sholto to become familiar with them.
“The bullet shattered my collarbone, so I couldn’t be a surgeon any more, my true vocation. I looked for a job, but nobody saw a doctor in me, just a war invalid. They only saw my limp, the tremor in my hand, my damaged arm, my broken soul… Finally I got a job at a small clinic, but I lost it. “He pointed at the bottles.
“The same you did with your brother, his wife and their sons?”
Sherlock got up and looked out the window. Bill put his hand on his shoulder. The detective closed his eyes, trying to control the despair that asphyxiated him, so much that he felt like screaming.
“Why are you still here?“
"What's going on?" he ventured to ask at last.
Lestrade pulled his boyfriend into the truck to keep him away from the other's accusing gaze. Mycroft looked at Lestrade, shattered.
It was easy for him to recognize in the dark curly-haired man, the sullen, shaggy, and defiant young drug addict who came to his office forced by his older brother. He came wrapped in the highly functional sociopath label that some stupid therapist they had visited previously gave him. Therapists that wanted to get rid of that forked-tongue demon who, even high as a kite, deduced every detail of his life with just a glance and spat them in their faces.
John took his time, his tongue drawing around Sherlock’s entrance, again slowly circling to the centre of the ring, and then, he dipped his tongue inside.
"The one on the screen is the anomaly Ross was investigating. The one who kidnapped him and them, "he pointed to the screen where Mycroft and Lestrade listened carefully, "think he is John."
"It's warm!" shouted the girl with delight, swimming freely once the detective deposited her in the water.
Pete looked sideways at Sholto, who nodded.
Defeated, Mycroft lowered his hand and dropped the gun to the ground.
Donovan frowned.
Bill, Luke, and Henri threw the shovels. Exhausted, their hands bleeding, they sat on the edge of the last of the holes they had dug.
Idiots. None of them could see in him the traumatized, broken, and frightened child who, in desperation, sought mechanisms to cope with the pain, fear, anguish, and depression that threatened to drown him.
Donovan laughed, relieved. Then stopped abruptly.
John clenched his teeth, furious.
"Sherlock sent a message with a complementary plan" she looked sideways at his mobile, resting on the coffee table next to a piece of handwritten paper, and an open book placed face down opened in the middle. Donovan, curious, read it.
Sherlock rolled up his eyes and nibbled at his lower lip in thought.
Sherlock checked the trip route on his phone. He pointed to the northwest.
Some squad cars arrived at the place. A bunch of officers joined the group, taking note of the parent’s complaints.
"I don't want you to get a big head, but… You're a fucking sex god. Too good to be true", gasped Sherlock, his body still shaking a bit as John laughed proudly, intertwined his hands with Sherlock, and bent down to kiss him gently, waiting for Sherlock's orgasm subdue totally.
The driver nodded and, without a word, got back into the cab, crossed his arms and closed his eyes, dozing while waiting for her.
"You win. You win. I'll give it to you".
"Would you let me?"
"Go on," said John, pushing him gently.
On the screen, he saw Rosie approaching the phone. He sadly noted her frown, the same John had when he was worried. And his heart shrank as the girl's face lit up when she saw him and ran to the phone.
John laughed willingly.
"May I know what you were thinking, little brother? Don't you realize you put John and the others in danger? Can you tell me what you are playing at?"
"No, in fact, he was the shortest of the thr..."
"My God, Myc," Lestrade hugged him tightly.
"John is not going to leave you alone."
"And what has my dear brother done this time?" asked Sherlock, sarcasm and mockery equally in the question.
Both chuckled.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment and quickly undid his belt, unbuttoned his trousers and unzipped them, grabbing the doctor's cock, threw his head back and groaned in delight.
"You should see the fridge in 221C," Lestrade thought.
"Why did you ask me to marry you?"
Sherlock noticed the man's gazed fixed on his jaw. He will try to hit him there, accustomed to knocking down his opponents at the first blow, confident that his size and musculature would give him victory.
“Calm down, love.”
Mycroft grimaced.
"Don't be fooled by appearances, Major. Or did you want two shiny new 4x4 running through a desert full of mercenaries?"
“God, I’m fucked,” growled Sherlock, throwing the doctor a murderous glance, but unable to hide a smirk.
Sally smiled halfway. If it were so easy… She moved and tripped with the cable for connection to the power grid. She picked it up and realized that, though the kiosk was still illuminated and Zoltar was still closing and opening his mouth, it was not connected to the electricity grid.
"I don't care," muttered Sherlock without looking at his brother. It was true. Killing him now would be an act of mercy.
"Who is John Clay?" bellowed the doctor to the phone.
John got into the black car that was waiting for him in front of Speedy’s and greeted Mycroft.
John moved the swing so that Sherlock was sitting on the harness, almost drooling, as John covered his dick with lube. To his surprise, the doctor laid on the carpeted floor under him, his huge steel-hard cock pointing to the ceiling. He settled down and put his hands behind his head.
"I don't think you're exactly the one who can criticize other's mistakes," snarled Stephen.
“What the hell are you talking about?”
They did not move.
Sherlock took the object out of the bag and frowned. He gestured for them to surround him and nailed it to the floor with a sharp blow. From the handle, a transparent dome opened, visible only by the bluish hue of the glass that entirely covered them. Sherlock pressed a red button on the handle, which beeped and turned green.
The whip landed on his ass again, and his dick swelled a little more, the rings that around it pressing even harder, without becoming painful.
“You are awesome.“ He managed to say.”
“Yes?”
"Johnny, you're drooling," a playful voice mocked.
"How could you let Peter go there?" cried Tony, his voice trailed evident panic.
Mycroft's assistant got up and grabbed her hand.
"He calculated the gifts you didn't receive since when you stopped celebrating and the ones they would have given you if your friends had known when your birthday was," explained Mycroft.
After a shower and a light dinner, John, Sherlock, and Rosie stayed on the terrace, enjoying the sea's murmur as the girl, in a drowsy voice, told them everything she and her new friends planned to do the next day.
Thank God, Lestrade stirred up heaven and earth looking for cases, old or new, whose files he left at the door of the flat. John, wearing a mask and gloves, picked it up and kept in locked in his old bedroom until the preventive period of twenty-four hours for the virus to disappear from the paper passed, at which time Sherlock threw himself at them like a hungry wolf.
"Sholto," he barked.
Alone.
He approached Rosie, and soon both were surrounded by cheerful animals. Sherlock smiled broadly, both he and Rosie throwing them sticks and balls, and Rosie about to explode with enthusiasm as the dogs laid them at her feet.
“The file?“ Finally asked.
"Let me come with you. I've been to Kazakhstan, I've been to Serbia, I've been..."
Sherlock regretted not having his phone to record the image of Rosie and her friends tenderly feeding the babies fallow deer, cutting the fruit in little morsels so the animals could easily chew them. From time to time, while taking the food from the little hands, they licked the kids, which was celebrated with suppressed yolks of excitement from the children, who enthralled, looked at their tiny teeth, their black noses and their spotted fur.
"And you invaded Afghanistan," Sherlock heard himself saying, chuckling.
"I've already been with them," he grunted in reply.
"Where are we? Why have you brought me here?"
"Rosie is already in bed, although I don't think she will be able to sleep. She's too excited about tomorrow".
"Say that again, and I'll make you eat Stormbreak, Ross," he threatened, brandishing it. Then he smiled broadly and hugged him, clapping hard his back.
Sherlock's vows:
"Are you deaf?" shouted John. "Drop your fucking weapons!"
Mycroft ran out in front of him. Greg stood and cocked his head.
He put it on the table and started lighting the little candles that covered the surface of it. Then he congratulated Sherlock and excused himself; he had to rush to the restaurant.
Until three days ago, when John stopped contacting Sherlock.
Any other human being in the world would have froze at Sherlock's murderous gaze. But John Watson was not just any man. He was a brave former soldier who knew he won. And that Sherlock knew it too. But the detective enjoyed dancing on the danger razor's edge and, above all, pushing John's limits.
"Don't grunt" John got up and went over to Sherlock, hugging him and pulling him in, tucking his thigh between Sherlock's legs and making the detective shudder. "I'll give you a vision of the beach you haven't had before."
“Yes!” some the kids replied.
The men holding him dragged John to the edge of the hole and forced him to his knees. The leader pulled out a gun and pointed it at John's forehead.
"You made such a mess with the red thread, Strange," scowled an amused Wong.
The Serbian raised his arm again to beat Sherlock. That damned detective endured the pain better than any of those he had tortured before, as he knew from Serbia. But that time, his brother was not there to save him.
The receptionist pressed her lips, offended. She was about to order the security team to make her leave the hall when a hurried, panting, and worried Molly rushed into the building, clearly chasing the landlady.
Without making a sound, they approached the voices. She could see Mycroft, standing before a lectern, Clay less than halfway down. In front of them, one of the mercenaries held a camera, while another was messing around with what looked like a radio station.
John smirked, watching Sherlocks's body shiver, while he closed his eyes and leaned back, biting his lower lip in an aroused gesture.
Sherlock nodded.
John looked at them in amazement and glanced at Sherlock, who just shrugged. Then the doctor's gaze fell on Mycroft, and his tired, aching gesture turned into infinite fury. The doctor broke loose from Sherlock and lunged at Mycroft, intending to punch him.
"James, I'm so glad you could come."
“Where is Lestrade?“ Asked to Dimmock.
******
The only time he felt insecure about his scars was the first time John,  kissing him, slowly unbuttoned his shirt, fearing he would find him repulsive and rejected his body, rejected him.
"Come on, John," insisted the detective, "it'll stand.... fuck me……, oh god, please, fuck me."
"Mycroft is here?"
"Unbelievable. His parents didn't freak out?"
"So do I. And you too. Recognize that from time to time to meet people who have nothing to do with crime, murder, or dead bodies".
"Not until you've defused the bombs. When you speak to Mycroft, keep me in the loop".
Peter wrinkled his nose and moved his head from side to side.
"Breath, Sherlock" grunted John between moans, filling the endless orgasm run over his whole body "Breath, love."
"And there are more in the basement. Your father spent his life with his nose in the books. He read those when he was a bit older than you and played pirates with…
He got up and poured some scotch in a glass.
He shook his head. It was undeniable that, despite the constant mistreatment he suffered, that man appreciated John Watson. And Donovan couldn't help feeling sorry for the doctor. She had always liked him. Moreover, she felt attracted by him from the very first moment she met him in the case of the serial suicide, coming along with the freak. To tell the truth, she wouldn’t have minded getting to know the doctor better, in every way.
"Hey, could you ask Myc for something?" she said the name with a tinkle.
"Don't fuck with me, Anthea. Who the hell is John Clay?" growled John again.
"Yes, sir," confirmed the officer, his voice shaking a bit.
"Don't dare to come."
John smacked his ass once more, reminding him who was in control. Sherlock let escape a moaned growl, while John lapped him, interspersing long, slow licks that went all over his crack with small, fast ones, sending shivers to Sherlock's spine. The detective closed his eyes and lowered his head, as John swirled his tongue around the rim, slowly teasing it, relaxing it. He pushed the tip of his tongue inside his asshole, enjoying Sherlock's muffled loud moans, his head buried in his forearms, plunged in the most pleasurable pure torture.
The DI’s ears reddened. Mycroft chuckled. Then narrowed his eyes.
The doctor shook his head. Every minute, he found harder not punching anyone. If they were in the Medieval Age, John was sure they would have come carrying torches and forks to burn Sherlock alive.
Sherlock pulled the strings, knowing what was coming.
"What for?"
"I hate to quote my brother, but, when you eliminate the impossible, what remains, however improbable, must be the truth. I don't know how, but there's another Sherlock," he got up from his chair, "let's go to Baker Street. Maybe we missed something."
"He could"
Moran froze and slowly turned on his heels. He narrowed his eyes, a murderous gaze on them and stepped back near the detective.
The receptionist asked Mycroft to came up to the counter to sign some of John's insurance papers.
“What case are they from?”
"No, no, John!" he shouted with laughter and twisted like a worm when John grabbed both of his wrists. When Rosie dug his little fingers in his ribs, he let out a high-pitched scream before laughing again.
"Sherlock will kill the people who stabbed you, John. You know it. Remember the American agent who beaten Mrs. Hudson?"
“Yes, you did, right after the presentation at Birmingham, remember?“ She emphasized the last word, undoubtedly implying something related to both the writer’s bad temper and alcohol. Mycroft seemed about hiding himself under the table while the doctor made a visible effort to regain self-control. Donovan observed him, fascinated. It was like watching Kraken trying to calm itself down.
The next morning, after rotating everyone’s captaincy, John and the C team made breakfast as Sherlock and the rest of the kids prepared sandwiches and juice for the trip to a nearby river they had planned.
“John, I'll never be able to thank you enough for what you have done for me these last days…" Sherlock didn't look at him, his eyes closed, relaxing at John's touch" I mean I wouldn’t have been able to confront… him without you, without what you... told me yesterday".
Greg was crouched over the longshoreman's body, looking for a clue with Anderson that would let them know what had happened. But they had nothing. He swore to himself. When they got stuck, they went to Sherlock. But now, apparently, he had one escaped Sherlock in New York and another in London killing people.
"He's going to know it anyway."
Both remained silent for a while, John stroking Sherlock's hair, the detective comforted by the firm, rhythmic beating of John's heart. He pressed his head against the doctor's chest and closed his eyes, trying to calm himself down. The thought of almost losing John still terrified him.
" written in black on a white background.
"Thaks, Mrs. Hudson. This idiot has to go now to talk to the other idiot".
Sherlock's strong punch got a cracking sound and broke Mycroft's left cheekbone's skin, leaving him dazed and dizzy. The detective stopped, panting and waiting, observing him. After a couple of minutes gasping, Mycroft took out a small case from his jacket pocket and brought it to Sherlock with a shaking hand.
Sherlock strained in his restraints, his body stilling in the edge of his orgasm, raising his hips, making John squirm with delight at the feeling of Sherlock's dick pulsing and throbbing inside him.
Then, a young, attractive woman with long, straight black hair opened the door. Her gaze was fixed on her smartphone and she didn’t bother to look at her.
"Merlin".
John sighed.
"Well, I guess after since you read the letter, it doesn't matter yet. I didn't tell John because… that way I could daydream."
“Yes, babe?”
Lestrade stared at her for a few minutes, jaw dropped. He knew Sally enough to know she would never say anything she didn’t think. He smiled weakly. After such a long time, it felt great someone gave him credit.
John knelt behind Sherlock, who shuddered at the feeling of his body warmness. He caressed his arse, rubbing his palms on in, grabbing both globes, delighted in the feeling.
“I know that”.
“John…”
Sherlock, who had closed his eyes, opened them, contemplating how, indeed, there was no trace of the detective.
Sherlock shook his head, a sparkle of interest burning in his eyes.
"That's unquestionable," Mycroft settled down next to Greg. After a while, the two of them were half asleep, mumbling.
"That's how I like it," said Greg patting his head.
Sherlock increased the rhythm, both wailing loudly, shuddering, and gasping. He swirled his other open palm around the heads, over the slits, and John let out a soft cry, arching his back slightly, dying to move his hips back and forth, but holding himself to do it.
Mycroft walked quickly to the bottom of the hangar, followed by the others. He opened the door of what looked like a warehouse, and they entered a room from which a corridor with several doors emerged. A tall, circumspect man was waiting for them, sitting on one of the room's chairs; when he saw them, he stood up and shook Mycroft's hand.
"And you decided men were over for you, so this is why you were claiming not being gay."
"John, are you listening to yourself? This is mad! Anyway, they are dead."
"I don't see what's so happy about it," he asked in a raspy voice
“We have to take him to Scotland Yard to take a statement” hissed Donovan “You don’t have jurisdiction in this case”.
"I don't think you have any choice," chuckled John, gently nibbling the nipple as Greg pinched the other one, with his index and thumb, both enjoying Sherlock's desperate writhing, his aroused mewling, his needy groans.
"Whose books are these?" asked Rosie
Sherlock looked at him, grateful.
"Now me," Sherlock went to get another sponge, but the doctor stopped him with a gesture.
Clay nodded, smiling as if he found it extremely amusing.
"Pllsssssssssssss gdddddddddddddddddddd" screamed a sobbing Sherlock as his cock throbbed and he came for the last time.
"I was afraid there was an anomaly, but I couldn't look for it."
The cabs stopped in front of a warehouse on the outskirts. The place was dark and silent. Reluctantly, John wondered if Donovan's theory finally would become correct.
Lestrade face was turning red and it was getting harder for him to breathe. He seriously started fearing for his life, because the doctor hand hadn’t moved a millimetre. John finally looked at him and, realizing the situation, released the grip on him. Lestrade put his hands to his throat and coughed, catching his breath.
"Yes, like Papa," John mused, remembering how, after Sherlock's "death," he locked himself up for several days in Baker Street, without eating or sleeping, unable to accept what had happened. That book seemed like a witch's errand.
"Bombs?" gasped Sherlock.
"I'd like to tie you up and ride you," he said in one breath.
Mycroft let out an undignified squeal and released the sand as if it burned until he heard Sherlock's giggles.
"The student surpassed the teacher," he teased Sherlock, who was about to explode with pride and sulking at the same time.
Natasha nodded. She smiled and approached Sherlock, amused by the resemblance to Stephen.
"Everything," whispered Sherlock.
But in front of these fourteen pairs of eyes fixed on him and only on him, his mouth dried up and his brain went blackout.
“Well, for not existing, it’s a perfect one” Lestrade held out his hand, trying to catch the book. “The best crime novel I’ve ever read.”
"You created the soldiers for your game?" Greg was amazed.
“It’s a piece of the wrapping of one of the energy bars,” Sherlock said “But why is there only this one? There were fourteen bars. Unless…”
*****
“Do you know what the deer eat?” asked Rosie. The man nodded.
"What shall we do?" asked Lestrade, realizing they were on a plank.
Lestrade snorted. Mycroft cast him a warning glance, and Lestrade turned to look at the river, biting his lips to keep from laughing.
"What's that?" asked Lestrade, coming closer to look at the sheet.
The Ghillie Dhu is a magical creature of Scottish folklore, but I thought it fit perfectly for the final chapter, so I took myself the liberty to move him to London :-) , since it is described as a gentle and kind-hearted mountain spirit.
John's gaze traveled back from Peter to Strange, and Everett's from Peter to the detective aiming at them.
"It was all a set-up to bring him down. Think about it. Why organize Mike's rescue and bring you here? To get me? They could have done that in London. I've been kidnapped there a lot of times. It would have been easier and faster. But they needed an incident with international repercussions that would leave Mycroft's hands tied at the same time. That's why Mike's reports came through unofficial channels. Somehow, they knew that, as soon as Mycroft received it, he would tell you that you would come looking for him. So they only needed to capture you and make you disappear. The scandal would blow up in his face. For organizing a covert operation, for endangering civilian's lives, for accepting information from uncertain sources as valid and poof, your position in the Government would blow up, brother".
They soon came within a hundred yards of where Mike was supposed to be held. Sherlock Sholto and the soldiers climbed to the top of the hill and lay down on it to watch him.
The detective’s body trembled uncontrollably as John pumped his tongue inside him, thrusting in and out, as Sherlock gripped hard his hands to the table edge, feeling John’s hot saliva dripping down his crack and caressing his balls, driving him absolutely crazy with the need of come.
Lestrade nodded.
But before he could get to it, his cloak came between him and the door and pointed imperatively to Everett, who, realizing Stephen was leaving, had turned to the fireplace.
John took off his shorts, releasing his painfully rock hard cock, not only to get rid of the pressure of the clothes but knowing that he the sight of it would make Sherlock mouthwatering. The detective looked at John's impressive cock resting on his abdomen, throbbing each time he licked Sherlock's and instinctively licked his lips, his pupils darkening.
“I met Sebastian at the University. He was five years older than me and was studying for a postgraduate degree. I was being beaten by some blokes of the rugby team and he compelled them to stop and leave me alone. He dressed my wounds and took me to have some tea. It was the first time since primary school that someone helped me when I was being bullied.
"Don't be stupid, Everett," he shouted and motioned to disappear in the portal behind Holmes.
Mycroft pressed his lips.
Only one to go!
“What's going on here?”
"Daddy!!!, she shouted in excitement. She frowned, "Are you all right? I can't see you".
He closed his eyes tightly, trying to push away the memory of John's agonizing search all over London that stormy night. The doctor, corroded with guilt and memories, neither returned to Baker Street nor answered his calls. With Lestrade in the pub out of action and Mycroft locked in sullen sulking, the desperate detective could only turn to one person apart from his homeless network to find him as soon as possible. John was in danger, wandering the streets of London alone at night.
Mycroft bowed his head and smiled, approached Lestrade, cupped his head between his hands and closed his eyes. Gently but firmly, he pressed his lips against his, a sweet soft kiss at first, a way to thanks Lestrade for understanding him, for loving and caring for him the way he did.
“I have to go.”
John turned to Lestrade.
"Why have you brought me here?"
Sally hung up, puzzled. She turned to Anderson, who remained silent by the door.
"You don't think we are done here, do you?" he smirked wickedly.
"Eurus was smartest than Mycroft, who was always claiming being cleverest than Sherlock. But she was…
“He had to go to Scotland Yard for the interrogations”.
He stood and put on his coat.
“The book-sign ends at eight. We can discuss it while having dinner here in the hotel. The restaurant.“ He clarified.
The pathologist gawked at her for a few moments and shrugged. It wasn't that strange either. If Sherlock melted away in front of Rosie, why not The Woman?
"Leave them, Greg, this had to happen sooner or later,' sighed John, watching the brothers, clinging to each other, rolling around the truck, hitting and threatening each other, until they disappeared behind it.  Lestrade nodded. John was right. That had to explode somehow.
I hope you enjoy it"
The DI hesitated for a few moments, racking his brain to find a convincing explanation. But lying to John no longer made sense.
"Why?"
“¿Cancer? ¿How could you?”
Sherlock cursed himself again. The pits weren't just a diversionary maneuver. They were a warning. Sherlock lost John once, and he wasn't going to miss him twice. But this time, he would do his own way.
"I'm so happy for you," smiled Harry, "and for Sherlock. By the way, where is he?"
The doctor nodded and approached him, while the others spread out on their cots. They both lay down, and Sherlock hugged him, plunging his face into John's neck. Worried, he noticed the detective was shaking. He put his good arm around him to instill confidence.
"It wouldn't do any good, Dr Watson," he heard Mycroft say. Greg had plugged in the speakerphone. "He is prepared to endure torture, and we have no time to lose".
“Have you colated the fingerprint?”
"May I ask what you're doing here?"
"Quantum entanglement."
Sherlock looked at him for a moment and, desperate, covered his face with his hands, shaking his head and muttering, "no, no, no."
"Vanished?" cried Mycroft, standing up, worried, startling the rest. Lestrade gestured him to wait.
“I've called you on the phone a thousand times, but you haven't picked it up. So I came to tell you. The Chief Superintendent got mad.”
Irene stopped, the locks between her fingers, surprised. She cleared her throat.
"Come on, all passengers bound for New York, follow me," announced Wong, opening a portal leading to the Avengers Facilities.
"You heard him, Greg," teased John.
Mycroft shook his head, unable to stop moaning, his body dissolving into a sea of pleasure that prevented him from thinking and even processing Greg's questions.
"Sorry, John, I'm afraid Sherlock has gone too far this time."
The detective started the four-wheel drive and drove it westwards, along a narrow, rocky, uneven road.
"What kind of nonsense are you talking about?"
"Great. A doctor. How helpful" the sarcasm of Tony's tone made Sherlock step forward, but John stopped him with a gesture.
"John, tell me about Rosie's last birthday," Bill's voice sounded a little closer.
"Skilled enough?"
"No, he is gone off with a bunch of Afghan war veterans. The only difference between them and the rest is they live on the street." she snapped to her feet and cast an eloquent glance at Mycroft.
"I thought your name was Rosie."
"Just one week. I know you are worried about me, but I need you to stay here, stay calm. I'll be back on Sunday".
But he knew Sherlock was also refraining himself; on the contrary, they would be already kissing savagely, tearing up each other clothes, John slamming Sherlock on every wall in the flat, fucking him senseless.
"Please, no, please, no, please, …" he kept repeating.
Sherlock moaned and closed his eyes, nodding. He controlled the urge to rock back and forth when John's hand traced the silhouette of his now completely hard cock through the fabric, brushing the tip with his thumb.
John turned to look at him and blinked, trying to focus his friend.
"Sure, sure, I will remember it every time you pretend don't remember my name".
"Who is Sebastian Moran, John?" asked Greg.
Mrs. Hudson covered Rosie’s ears so she couldn’t hear the string of curses that sprouted from the bedroom, where Sherlock and John were both finishing to get ready.
Steve swallowed and continued walking, trying to ignore the woman's sad face. He saw her hand approaching the electrified barrier Thor created, and his heart shrank. The screams of the spirits that crashed into her were full of pain. He closed his eyes, repeating that she was not her, that hand was not hers, but it was so real...
Sherlock plunged into sex with John in the same passionate way he solved a case or played the violin, with all his mind, body and heart, inexperienced but willing to be taught and to learn, to please and be pleased. And he acted with John in bed as in the rest of his life, studying, testing, experimenting and collecting data about John’s body, inch by inch, methodically treasuring all the information in his Mental Palace, discovering erogenous points in John’s body that he didn’t even know himself, what he liked, what he disliked, deducing what he was ashamed to ask for, making the doctor reach unknown peaks of pleasure while they were having sex together, always wanting for more, as if they’d like to make up for all the time they hadn’t been together.
The detective didn't answer. He'd been pouting on the couch all day. It was the eighth day of the quarantine, he had no more samples to test, and Lestrade just told him he had no more cases he could solve from home.
"Why do you hate Daddy?" asked Rosie, relaxing as Irene separated her blonde hair into locks.
“WE have to find him” the older Holmes pointed out. “Be sure we will get him. That bastard has his days numbered”.
John nodded.
Anderson moved behind Donovan and, taking out her bra, reached her breasts, squeezed them together, pinching her nipples, hardening them as the sergeant moaned loudly, closing her eyes, taking the dildo out of Sherlock ass for a bit.
Sherlock looked at him, blinking, processing his big brother's words. Mycroft grabbed the chair out of the detective's hands.
“I wanted to apologize you for calling him a freak.
), and the fear of bringing painful memories back for both of them made him abandon the idea.
"Nope. It is a Spanish wine. The color is given by natural pigments such as blackberry, blueberry, or the skin of red grapes, thanks to a complex called antiocine".
Greg looked at him, astonished.
John narrowed his eyes and then opened them wide, as did the other ex-soldiers.
. She sighed and settled down in her seat, fighting the impulse to turn around and look at the car following them.
"You couldn't do that," Clay replied.
"It's him".
The woman laughed out loud and wrote something down on a piece of paper. Lestrade, Donovan, and the rest looked at her in amazement.
She turned to the doctor, pointing at the detective.
******
"I... Mycroft... in Serbia. I said..., I shouldn't...."
(See the end of the chapter for
by Jason Mraz and Colbie Cailat enveloped them.
Greg licked his right nipple again, while Mycroft clenched his teeth, his head slightly thrown back. In his vertical position, the stimulation of Lestrade's tongue and fingers seemed higher to him than in a horizontal position. God... that was torture...
Mike nodded.
"He has no idea about what it is," replied Lestrade.
A daily half-hour walk? No matter where they were or how much John protested that he wanted to walk a little further, at half an hour, with atomic clock's precision, Sherlock hailed a cab, and they returned to Baker Street.
He knew Sherlock loved dogs and was eager to play with Rosie and them, only held back by the idea of maintaining his aura of an unabashed consulting detective.
The Sergeant braked hard, stopping on the dune slope.
"That's a lot of head start," Lestrade observed.
Finally, he looked at John, questioningly.
At one point, he pressed his lips together and let himself fall on Sherlock's cock.
"You mean you won't come like this?" teased John, running his fingertips from the detective's navel to his neck, touching the nipples in his path, as Sherlock's hips bucked madly while he blushed even more, shooking his head, arching his back.
John ran his tongue around Sherlock's puckered hole, while the detective squirmed and moaned, feeling the doctor's tongue going up and down the crack, and then going around the hole again, from time to time sticking the tip of his tongue in it, making Sherlock scream with pleasure, his thighs shaking, leaning on his elbows, throwing his head back.
Sherlock leaned his back against the wall, slipped to the floor, hid his head between his bent knees, and began to cry inconsolably, muttering all was his fault, his whole body shaking with every sob.
demands, interspersed with the most obscene moans and curses the detective had ever uttered.
"Don't be an idiot. Of course, you do." he smiled and pecked his nose. "I may let you fuck me in our wedding anniversaries if you behave."
“My phone! What were you doing with it?”
The next morning, Sherlock smirked when Molly called him, speaking gibberish about the last corpse arrived at the morgue. He, of course, knew John was preparing him a surprise birthday party and that Molly's call was only an excuse to take him away from home.
“A lot of work” she replied simply. He gestured to the waiter. ”The same as them.
Sherlock kept digging until he pulled out a small capsule, the size of a grail of rice, and wiped it off with his sleeve. The translucid glass capsule cracked from the blows, and inside it was visible a tiny elongated microchip with a small antenna of very thin copper wire wound around. He took his magnifying glass and observed it in the light of the flashlight while Mycroft, visibly relieved, dropped his head to the ground, eyes closed, ignoring his bleeding cheekbone.
The DI and Sherlock's brother looked at him, worried. John's eyes were unfocused, lost in an unpleasant memory. Mycroft made a gesture, and the agents took the man out of the interrogation room.
"I will show him how to make the bed in the morning" assured Sherlock.
He caught the flu three days ago while dealing in the clinic with the flu season. He had been in bed ever since, with a fever and aching body. His head was about to explode; he couldn't breathe through his nose due to the congestion, and every time he breathed through his mouth, his throat burned as if someone scraped it with sandpaper.
"Agggggggggggggg" Sherlock shrieked through his clenched teeth when John started again jerking his now painfully sensitive cock; he arched his back, trying to tell John he can't come yet after his second brutal orgasm. Still, his mind was unable to coordinate a coherent sentence.
“What for?”
But it wasn’t an experiment.
"So it seems you have something to do after the honeymoon, related to your special husband and magnificent daughter."
He fell silent as Sherlock turned on his heels and stride forward to the truck. He opened the door and walked in, closing it slowly behind him.
"I just came from your office, Greg. Anderson told me neither Sherlock nor you had set foot in there for the last few days. But every time Sherlock went out of the flat, he said he was going to meet you there, so where the hell is he?
"I can't lose him, Mycroft," gasped the detective, broken, his voice weak and quivering," I can't lose John."
John laughed with that pitch giggle Donovan knew so well (both the doctor and the freak giggling at crime scenes), but it resonated with a mix of mockery and bitterness new for her.
“Then he gripped me tightly, he said he loved me, and that he will be waiting for me and ...” John sobbed. ”If I hadn’t asked him to coming with me ... if I had let him stay in the army base ... he would still be alive.”
The doctor bent and licked Sherlock's neck, move his tongue on the tendon, and Greg mirrored him, licking the soft and hot skin, his nose filled with the detective's aroma. Sherlock jumped a bit and then moaned softly at the contact of both tongues that moved from his neck towards his collarbones.
Mrs. Hudson's face lit up as if she just remembered.
John nodded. How could he ever forget it? Every time Bill, he and the others met in a pub, they left an empty chair, Mike's, to somehow keep him up with them. John understood what Bill meant. All of them wanted that chair to be occupied again.
The forensic approached them.
"A hundred per cent, she is loyal to me."
And so on.
"I..." he babbled at last, in a barely audible tone, "I... couldn't... I only..."
"Everything is fine; you don't have to worry. As soon as I can, I'll come and get you, okay?"
“And I’ll clean all that mud from you in return,” wailed John.
"Their being on the streets does not invalidate the military experience they have, their knowledge of the terrain. Do you think Sherlock has chosen them at random? I highly doubt it."
A door opened on his right. Two men came in. One of them bent down and put a glass to John's lips. The doctor moved his head away from the glass.
The detective closed his eyes, biting his lower lip.
John backed away, rejoicing in Sherlock's vision. His arse was not only gorgeous, beautiful, soft, and ready to be fucking madly, but one of his most sensitive places. He was easily overwhelmed with sensations at the touch of John's tongue, fingers or cock, and became a kind of bronco wild horse, trashing, bucking, and twisting madly.
"I'm just looking out for your well-being, Sherlock" he looked at the Avengers and sighed. "You don't know what it's like always to have to look out for a little brother who only knows how to get into trouble."
“John, please…”
Grumbling, the detective crunched in a half-squat between Luke and Bill, the first one standing in front of him and Bill behind him, both facing the detective.
"Well, you should get a map of the house."
"No, Batman's right," said Tony. "Whatever happens, it's done. Now we have to fix it. Bruce, what have you got?"
"What?"
John moved in front of Sherlock and gently teased his right nipple blowing on it, to then slowly circling it with his tongue without touching the hard nub, his mouth traveling through his chest to do the same in the other, as Sherlock whined at the teasing.
"If something goes wrong," continued the doctor in a reassuring voice, "I want you to shoot me."
Rosie nodded again and focused, began to draw a jellyfish between the green algae and blue bubbles. A semicircle to make the body of the jellyfish and then four long wavy tentacles coming out of it.
"Heaven help us if your forensic's theories start to pan out. But they don't. Here's something else. Something... Have you seen this Avenger and Sherlock? They're identical. They could pose as each other just by changing their hair or goatee".
She climbed up the scaffolding in a hurry, leapt between the buildings, and rolled across the 221's roof to the trapdoor, where she quickly descended. In the lounge, Donovan, leaning against the window, gun in hand, peered out without being seen, while Molly and Mrs. Hudson stacked the furniture to form barricades to protect themselves from the shots.
Sherlock bit his lower lip, rabid. He hated being defeated. But he could not let the Yards find out about it. As soon as John sent the message, the Terror of New Scotland Yard would turn to the… the mere idea made him shudder.
"Shall we play chess?" John suggested. At least they would spend some time picking up the pieces when Sherlock got angry and, in one fell swoop, rolled them on the floor.
Four of the convicts were sat in the darkness, eating what Sherlock recognized as the low sugar biscuits and some cans that John bought for the kids, talking about something related to Belmarsh and hostages. Sherlock twisted his mouth. They were planning to take Rosie and the others as hostages to guarantee their escape.
"Geena..., we just have..."
Finally, I thought it was better to split the last chapter in two, so this fifth is basically an epilogue a bit modified from the previous version.
John opened his eyes and almost came with Sherlock's vision: both arms held to the bar, eyes closed, frowning, concentrated on maintaining self-control, disheveled hair falling on his sweaty forehead, body drenched in sweat, pulsating cock hard as hell, head back, mouth half-open... It was sweet torture for both of them, so much so that the detective had long since stopped moaning and just emitted some rhythmic ah, ah, ah, ah, while his biceps and his thighs trembled as his body went up and down.
"Thank you, very enlightening, Bart. Can we go to the house now?"
Donovan watched him, between surprised and amused. Since when did Anderson put the pieces together so fast? Even the freak would have be amazed.
"And Anderson saying I had started running in the morning, and I twisted my ankle."
“We will miss you too. But don’t be sad. Think about all the things you want to do next year, and we will do it when you come back”.
"We came on time."
"We weren't fucking."
"As you can imagine," Mycroft's voice echoed across the room, "Donovan is like a child on Christmas morning. She is dreaming about handcuffing you…"
So when several hours later, he received a call from the hospital announcing that Sherlock was in A&E with a stab wound, he couldn't believe it. The cretin decided, without warning anyone, to return to the basement where he was kidnapped. There, he found the gang's remaining member, who, armed with a large machete, almost killed the detective.
"Where is Sherlock?" he barked in a sour tone.
Sherlock only could nod, a lump in his throat due to how relieved he was. He didn’t know how to thank the shepherd for making Rosie so happy, as well as the other kids, for caring for them... The man smiled, understanding.
"No, Gregory, let him go," shouted Mycroft.
"I thought Papa was always this tall."
"Tell me, Sherlock," she said.
"I surrender, I surrender," he managed to shout between uncontrolled giggles.
The DI nodded, sighing, thinking about how easier his work could be if Donovan and Sherlock could work together without fighting all the time. But they loathe each other, though he didn’t know the reason why. Maybe it merely was hate at first sight. Ambling, he entered the garage and headed to his car. He got into it and sighed again, running his hand through his short grey hair. Years of preventing Donovan and Sherlock from killing each other were getting him old.
John shook his head incredulously.
He was terrified.
"Sherlock, you have to…" Mycroft sighed when the detective disappeared inside the elevator.
Something I was supposed to know by now, but my parents rejected Harry so much for being a lesbian, were so cruel to her, I convinced myself it was wrong to be bi.
"I don't think your Papa would leave Baker Street for anything in the world, but you can come here whenever you want," said Geena, leaving the colossal potato salad bowl in the center of the table and taking the girl's plate to serve her. She threw in a considerable ladle and gave it to her. The girl filled the fork and tried it out.
“Wait, hold on,” urged Sherlock, gasping, trying to catch his breath between his clenched teeth.
John smiled, kissed Sherlock's hair, and indulged him a couple of hours rest.
Mycroft smirked sadly.
"He would keep you company on the nights I do not sleep due to the cases".
“At first it was, but soon, we fell madly in love with each other. It wasn’t easy. In the army it is still difficult to accept that your partner or your superior is gay, and even more so that someone’s boyfriend runs around the base. So we kept it secret. You know, hiding for kissing each other until we were out of breath, looking for solitary places to have sex… It was hard, but really exciting at the same time
"Home."
"But you can't control everything. That's an illusion, Myc."
"This is wonderful. You couldn't have found a better place for Rosie. She is enjoying it a lot."
John watched him leave with a heavy heart, remembering the ambulance ride out of Magnussen's office after Mary shot him, the second time he almost lost Sherlock. A chill ran down his back as they all got in the plane, Mark and Luke pushing Mike and forcing him to seat and the aircraft took off for London.
“Su ... sure sir,” she lied. She didn't want to annoy him.
"We?" he turned to Sherlock, who woke up and was looking at Mrs. Hudson.
Twenty minutes later, John found him sat on the trunk of a dead tree.
"No…, no I need, it's… too much,".
“I heard him talking,” lied Sherlock. It wouldn’t be worthy of trying to explain the man he deduced it “I’m camping with fourteen kids. I cannot put them at risk”.
"Rosie, how beautiful you look!" cried Molly. She, as Mrs. Hudson,  wore a dress with the same floral motifs as the girl's blouse and combed her hair into a bow. The change in her was evident from the time she was dating Irene. Her voice was not trembling. She regained her self-confidence; instead of her everlasting anguished gesture, she was smiling broadly, holding Irene's hand, who, surprisingly, was wearing the same model as Molly.
"Brilliant," murmured John, forgetting about Mycroft.
"Your mouth…….. so fucking good," John murmured in a moan, knowing the praise would encourage Sherlock to swallow the whole of it, and John could felt the tip of his cock in the back of his throat, Sherlock's moans vibrating on John's cock and reaching the doctor's whole body.
"I'd be lost without my blogger."
Mycroft closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and looked at the man.
"Would you like to respond to readers' comments?"
He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to apart those images from his mind.
“Whatever,” Molly cut him “Could you manage with it?”
The pathologist laughed.
"Hey, save something for tonight!" Sherlock heard Lestrade shouting.
"After so much pain, so much anguish and loneliness, Sherlock appeared, erasing all those years with one stroke, making me feel alive, useful, and loved. And while I was bleeding, I told myself it was unfair to die when I just started living".
"You'd love I were fucking you like the cockslut you are, wouldn't you?
"As you said, it's my birthday," said Sherlock. He undid his belt and slid his trousers down his legs to the floor and did the same with his pants, freeing his hard cock. Then moved his hands to his ass, and a wet pop sounded when he removed an anal plug, his hole brilliant with the lube. He threw it across the living room and looked at John.
"Really?"
Ten minutes later, a message arrived on John's phone.
*********
"If you want me to forgive you, it's not going to be enough just to apologize."
"It's wonderful," observed Sherlock, gesturing with his toast toward the green hills around them.
A roar of laughter erupted from all of them, imagining the scene.
"And let yourself go, sweetie," joked Bill, and the rest giggled, amused.
"Because…, because… you are Sherlock Holmes. You are clever and handsome and… I am only…me, nothing special, a soldier, a…" he whispered, feeling strange for confessing his feelings so openly, but relieved for being able to do it at last."
He smirked. Perhaps most ironically of all, Eurus's breakthrough into their lives finally led them to confess their feelings for each other.
"A few more days and we'll be there with you" assured John.
To say the detective was furious was an understatement.
The others followed his example, throwing bushes, earth, and stones away; a small drill bit appeared under his feet.
Whatever he was going to say was lost when John grabbed his lower lip between his teeth and pulling a bit, both lost in each other's eyes, softly licking his lips. John winked and crawled back down to Sherlock's groin, licking the sensitive skin under his balls, to devour Sherlock's cock., engulfing it, lips sealed tightly around it while he bobbed his head, sucking it hard and deep, as the detective buried his hands in the sand, shivering, moaning, leaking and pleading for more with breathy moans.
John looked at Lestrade, who had paled.
, Molly?" joked the doctor.
“You are the next, Mycroft” teased Greg.
"Since we are here, I thought it would be good if they took a look at you."
"I'm fucking you…" and John pushed up a bit the detective's body and let it fall on his cock.
Apologies for the delay in adding this final chapter. We had a kind of hard time, but finally, we managed to overcome it and finishing the fic?
Sherlock got serious. The doctor could see the shadow of a memory crossing his eyes.
“I thought in NSY everyone hated my books. And how they helped you?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sholto turned and saw the dust the truck was raising, driving into an open grave. Sherlock followed his gaze and cursed mumblingly.
"Do you remember their names?" asked Mycroft. John nodded and told him. The older Holmes called Anthea and recited them.
He sat on the wet floor, resting, looking at the devastated camp. After a while, he walked to Rosie’s bumblebee and picked it up. It started raining, Sherlock raised his head, closed his eyes and let the rain clean the mud from his face. Then he got on his feet and went back to the dolmen.
He avoided the bandaged ribs and his tongue landed on the detective’s navel, circling it. Sherlock giggled and pulled John’s hair, trying to separate the wicked tongue from his ticklish spot, but John kept playing with his tongue around and inside Sherlock’s navel, feeling how the detective’s cock got even harder, making his hips thrust, looking for more friction with John’s body.
"Come for me, John"…
The Serbian lowered his arm, hitting Sherlock's back with the baton with all his might.
And John knew it.
“The third from the left.”
Stephen looked at him, blankly.
Sherlock chuckled but groaned when John pressed his muscles around his cock, obliging him to concentrate in not coming.
"Why?
"What were you thinking? Don't you know him?"
“According to your books, you are an expert in solving crimes, and in the way the Yard works, “Watson didn’t miss the woman’s offended tone, “so I thought you could be helpful for us.”
They broke the kiss to breathe, their forehead together, both panting and blushed.
"Even if we tried to shoot them down, we could still hurt them," warned the Captain. "Our bullets will go through the wood like butter."
"Oh yes, yes, yes, yes," he moaned in bliss, when John's finger reached his prostate, taking care of not put too much pressure so Sherlock couldn't come  yet from the light touch.
"You were there, watching everything," hissed the doctor, "and you didn't move a finger."
"How should I do it?"
Anthea nodded to the phone.
"Can I play?" asked Rosie.
"You can't defuse it if you don't know where it is".
John extended a trembling hand that slowly moved closer to the detective, afraid to try to feel him and discover that there was nothing, as had happened to him before. Sherlock's ghost also extended his hand and brought it close to John's, as slowly and shakily as the doctor's, as if he too was overwhelmed with emotion,  until both hands touched.
“Look at me, Sherlock. It's not your fault”.
(The Tempest – Act 3, Scene 1)
"A portable shield," explained Mycroft, "secret military technology" he stressed the last syllables throwing an incendiary look at Mark, who didn't flinch.
Greg approached him and licked his right nipple, his tongue brushing gently against it, just the tip, and then pricking it with his index finger and thumb.
John bit Sherlock's lower lip and pulling it slightly until he let go, enjoying the thrill that ran through the detective's body, accompanied by a barely audible whine more predictable of a puppy than the only consulting detective in the world.
“I’m not going anywhere”.
John smiled heartening. He caressed Sherlock's cheek and lips in the same way Moriarty did before, erasing Jim's touch.
"Shut up," Sherlock sobbed, his heart breaking into more pieces listening to the truth, blinking to conceal the tears.
you are going to receive today.”
Mycroft quickly pulled himself together.
"Granted," he promised, smiling to himself, because of how wonderful were now Sherlock's kisses, and the guilt vanished from his eyes. But John wouldn't change that first kiss for anything.
'We got here"' announced Pete, taking Sherlock out of his thoughts.
"I'm sorry to bother you," the pathologist's worried face appeared on the screen. "But Rosie doesn't stop asking about you and John, and I don't know what to do anymore to calm her. Lestrade and Mycroft were here and... well, she's your daughter. Even though we all acted like everything is all right, and Rosie pretended to believe it, as soon as they left, she begged me to let her talk to you both, just a short phone call... She hasn't even gone to bed yet. I think she needs to know you both are all right... ".
He pointed around in all directions with the flashlight. A little further at his right, he saw another sparkle in the darkness. It was another piece of the wrappings, carefully stuck on a branch.
“John Watson’s book-signing is this afternoon and I want to finish this one before it. So, if you don’t mind…”
John for the first time.
The detective rushed to the next grave, never ceasing to mutter. He dug his hands into the dirt. He didn't need to read the dog tag's name. Sherlock fell to his knees and pressed them to his chest, swinging back and forth, sobbing hard.
He saw Bill Murray and the rest of the group on their knees, like him, their hands also tied behind their backs. He frowned. Luke was missing.
"You deserved all of this and much more," said John "Happy this and the un-celebrated birthdays. They also helped me to figure out what to buy you and to find it," he explained, throwing a thankful smile to the others.
He closed his eyes and pursed his lips.
"Sherlock asked us to find a way to make them go to a castle in France," replied Anthea. "Martha thought there was nothing more credible than a forgetful older woman's ravings. And she was right. You got yourselves in the role".
"No."
"As far as I know, there's not much you can do when John Watson is bent on something. And I'm sure you didn't make it easy for him."
"I… J-john…."
The detective closed his eyes, recovering the map of the zone from his mental palace, looking for a place to hide the children. He opened his eyes and started walking, followed by fourteen tiny excited explorers.
"Did you know border collies are the smartest dogs of all?" asked the woman.
Indeed. Another Sherlock appeared through the portal Stephen had left open.
“You didn’t tell me anything when I went to the hospital” Mycroft’s tone was low and cracked, a bit hurt, but infinitely sad.
“John, what happened?" asked Lestrade, sounded worried. "We received a call reporting Sherlock has kidnapped several kids.”
"I know. Rosie's going to miss you".
The detective nodded and went down a narrow corridor, bending between pipes and air conditioning ducts, followed by the others, until he reached a door no more than five feet high. To the right of it, a code reader. He passed the electronic key that the woman had given him through it and the door opened with a gentle buzz.
"How on earth you deduced he was referring to Rosie?"
He ran his hand across the cover, tracing the title's golden letters with his finger, stroking them. Bart was right. The book had been a treasure for Sherlock. The detective opened it, and the words reverberated in the kitchen, hypnotizing Rosie, John, and Geena with his deep baritone voice.
Before Holmes could unlock the handcuffs, someone knocked hard on the front door. Holmes dropped the hand with the key, and Everett cursed to himself.
“I SAID GET…”
"I'm not sure you're going to finish the ceremony dressed," laughed Lestrade.
Everett searched his memory. Holmes had said that Watson had fought in Afghanistan. He had been shot. He'd been discharged from the army and returned to London with little more than his army pension. He shouldn't have had a family if he shared a flat.
“Have a lovely weekend, dear.”
"What reality of me?"
"Did Sherlock and you have a row?"
Sherlock took her in his arms, the dog jumping around her.
"Do you need anything else?" he asked Mycroft.
“Don’t get your hopes up. I’m not flirting with you.” Watson got up from his chair, picked up a cane that was resting on the edge of the table and, limping visibly, joined Anthea. ”I'm gay. And even if I weren’t, you're not my type.”
"Thank you, Bill."
Lestrade is truly a good friend
The detective froze, the chair up.
Then the music started.
"Or a sleeping bag," John raised an eyebrow, "Forget I said it."
"ohmmmmm John, john. Mmmmmmm I'm going to mmmmmmmm"
"Stop sulking," Greg orderer him ten minutes later, trying to hold in his laughter, "it's your wedding day. You should be happy."
"Yes, a third like Sherlock, or the other, but in the end, like Sherlock. My brother wasn't even in London when the last murder happened."
"People do crazy things when they are in love".
He dropped on the sit and left the cane on the next seat. His leg hurt more than usual. Like the shoulder. And his heart.
"I don't know what you are talking about."
"What Clay said? Of course not. But I remembered Anthony," he looked sideways at his brother, who nodded slightly. "He used to say that if he heard Clay say that again, he would cut his jugular. He did a perfect impression of Clay, saying it, in that unbearably pedantic Clay's tone".
“Yes, love?” he asked, by all means enjoying Sherlock’s frustration.
Two of the prisoners were searching the tents, throwing out everything they found inside, undoubtedly looking for money. They had pulled out three of them from their fixation, and Sherlock glared at Rosie’s stuffed bumblebee, half-buried in the mud. The other two fugitives stayed in the shed, eating and chatting.
"Next time, could you come down dressed as a fireman?"
"Don't you dare" menaced the British Government.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Almost, but no”.
John frowned, lost.
John looked at Sherlock or, at least, the visible part of him, the mope of disheveled black curls that rested on the pillow, the rest of him hidden below the duvet.
Sherlock remained silent for an instant, undoubtedly enjoying one of the best orgasms of his life.
"Ten days, Daddy, not a day less" she reminded him.
John smiled.
Hardly, in line to put up as little resistance to the air as possible, they advanced towards a yellowish light at what seemed to be the dome's end.
The DI heard Mycroft shouting and sighed. If Sherlock's defense mechanism was to close in on himself like an oyster, Mycroft's was terrorizing everyone who stood in front of him, the head nurse in that case. The DI got up and walked over to the counter, pushing an angry Mycroft away from the rabid nurse, trying to calm down the two of them.
"What are you saying, idiot?" We are seeing it with our own eyes," replied Tony.
“Do we have a press conference?”
"Sherlock," there was a hint of worry in the doctor's voice, "Sherlock?"
Both remained motionless, the weapon firmly held against the other's head, without blinking, without moving a muscle, neither willing to lower the gun.
John smiled and shook his head. Peter glowed.
He returned to Sherlock and knelt behind him. Sitting on his ankles, he ran his hands over his back till his arsecheeks.
"I'm taking Rosamund away from here!" threatened the elder Holmes.
The three of them began to march in place to warm up, and then any of them produced a skipping rope, a purple one Rosie and John and Sherlock black ones. They jumped over it, first at a slow pace and then increasing speed.
"The one place no one would look for her," he shook his head as he finished writing another message and pressed the send key.
He dropped into the hole, which was not very deep, followed by John, Sholto, Bill, Luke, Jonas, and Patrick. The tunnel was high and quite narrow, so only Sherlock walked easily through it. The others, especially John, moved carefully so as not to touch the walls with their shoulders.
"Sherlock is on the case. Everything will be all right," smiled Lestrade, kissing him again.
Donovan raised an eyebrow.
Molly scratched the back of her hand.
"And we still have some things to finish. But, as you see, Daddy is all right".
"Yes, sir."
Two weeks later, Mycroft called John to apologize and handed him Mike's file.
When Greg came back to reality, Martha had turned off the TV. The woman sighed, put her laptop under the counter, and turned around to prepare the sandwiches. Suddenly she stopped and turned to Lestrade, Donovan, and the others as if she had realized something.
"It's all set," announced Bart. He bent down in front of Rosie, offering her his arm, as if at an official reception, "Will you come with me, miss?"
"Captain, this is going to hurt."
"What?"
"nggggggggggg gooogdddddddddddd" whimpered the detective, unable to form words, as John rolled his hips. "John...... plssssss".
Donovan felt she was short of breath. She picked up the dossier and went down to the press room. Where the hell was Lestrade?
Donovan enjoyed the surprised glance Anthea gave her. She may not be as smart as Holmes, but she had the winning hand in that play, whatever it was.
Greg himself was making noises he didn't know he could produce, his groans higher-pitched and louder when Sherlock took him even deeper, his hips jerking uncontrollably, his hands firmly gripped at Sherlock's hair.
"Calm down, love, the ambulance will be here soon," said John softly, caressing his hair the way he knew it would relax him.
Like if she had a radar, she woke up just to see the turquoise waters of Mallorca's beaches and shouted in excitement. The little girl was elated. She went to the beach with John, or when her godmother Molly or Uncle Mycroft took her, but never with the two of them.
"And why did he cross over?" asked Steve. "it's not often that one reality jumps to another."
"Theoretically, Mycroft is there to set his new property, and he will need a lot of staff. No one will be surprised if he arrives with them and wants to supervise everything personally".
*******
“It is incredible how much disrespect reigns in your department, DI Donovan” John replied. He turned to Anderson” I understand this man was your superior, and only for that you owe him some respect.
Unlike him, Sherlock, due to his random sleep patterns, fall asleep soundly, which allowed John to play with the detective without waking him. When John woke up before Sherlock, he liked caressing the sleuth’s lips with his index finger and poke it into his mouth. That usually made John groan imagining Sherlock was sucking his cock until he became so aroused that it wasn’t uncommon for the detective to wake up with the doctor straddled on his chest, while John’s cock gently fucked his mouth. The detective didn’t mind being woken up like that; quite the contrary, he sucked John’s cock eagerly till the doctor came in his mouth.
"There's something I don't understand." said Mycroft, trying to divert attention. He turned to Sholto "cookies, avocado..."
Sally reopened the door, her face dark red.
"You can be sure of that".
"I'm here, love, it's over, I'm here," the detective mused, stroking his hair, tears rolling down his cheeks, trembling after days of anxiety and fear. "I thought I had lost you" he whispered, kissing John between sobs, his lips gently brushing each wound.
"He is not going to throw up, is he?" the driver panicked. "If he does, you will pay for the cleaning."
He turned around, his movements as posh and calculated as always, but he couldn't hide the sadness in his eyes.
John took Sherlock's left hand with his, watching the bands on both of their fingers. The detective squeezed it, a part of his brain still in the world of the living. John kissed his hand, and the detective made a sound between a content sigh and a soft purr.
"How romantic!" mocked Mike, laughing.
"Is there room in the army for an old officer?"
"And you decided that sacrificing John was a small price to pay."
Sherlock chuckled.
"Drop your weapons," ordered Bill.
“Of course I do, and you know it. But he has the… deduction thing that allows him to solve crimes in a blink of an eye. And we need these murders to be solved. You must admit it, all of us here owe him half of our careers”.
"Don't listen to him, Mycroft" advised Sherlock, distressed.
"What is hara-kiri?"
“Geena turned to Sherlock.
Sherlock smirked.
He smiled as he noticed Stephen smiled into their kiss, and both deepened the kiss. Everett sucked Stephen's lower lip slightly, and he parted his lips, letting Everett's tongue explore his mouth. The Supreme Sorcerer hummed deep in his throat, and a chill run down Everett's spine. They broke the kiss, both a bit overwhelmed of finally being kissing each other but kept their noses rubbing each other, not wanting to be apart again. Their minds were dizzy with joy, relief, love. Both flushed, panting, aroused, and…
"I want this! The one with one brown and one blue eye" cried Rosie, pointing at a Blue Merle Border Collie, with white chest and grey-blueish tinged fur, and dark patches along his back, tail, face and ears.
"What's your name?" John asked the boy.
Lestrade raised his weapon, ready to shoot Ironman, as Sherlock struggled desperately, seeing the portal closing. Desperate, he punched and kicked Ironman, ignoring the pain of hitting the nanosuit, until Tony held him down to keep him from hurting himself further. Mycroft forced Lestrade to put his arm down. He could shot Sherlock.
But bit by bit, that short blond man who almost went unnoticed, became an essential part of Holmes' work and life. What did the freak call him? Ah yes, his Conductor of Light. Just what she needed now. She smiled softly about the idea of solving crimes with John Watson by her side.
The detective looked at his watch.
He grabbed his hair and pulled Sherlock's head up, so he could only suck the tip for a while, until he thrust his hips up, sinking his cock into the bottom of Sherlock's throat, who effortlessly opened it, then pulled the detective's head up again.
"Do you know how this sling is called?" rumbled John in his ear, while making sure the ropes weren't too tight around Sherlock's wrists and ankles.
John took his fingers out and moved to Sherlock's head, kissing him, softly at first, almost bruising the detective's lips, until the kiss deepened, both moaning against the others' mouth.
John laughed and cried at the same time. He looked at the detective, his face also full of tears, his scowl, the guilt in his eyes. He was happy, relieved, angry... he wanted to kiss Sherlock while strangling him.
"Get on the plane," barked Lestrade in an authoritative tone.
The detective shook his head.
That led to the third stranger thing. Sherlock, always so controller delegated the organization of the wedding entirely on him. Each question about the menu or the best man was answered with a hum or a "whatever you choose is fine with me, John."
“Lestrade, something strange is happening.”
"I don't play James Bond," argued Mycroft.
"This is not heat, Doctor. Watson. Come here at the end of July, and you'll see what heat is."
"Since when did you get on so well with Anthea?"
"Honey, your parents thought you should stay a few days with Irene," the girl nodded, biting her lower lip, pensive. The pathologist smiled, trying to instill confidence in her. "Obey her and behave yourself, okay?"
Sherlock sighed. Of course, he wouldn't. He could not abandon John. Never.
The car stopped near the hangar. He got out and walked quickly to the plane. He stopped in his tracks and opened his eyes widely.
"You drugged me in Baskerville."
Mycroft looked at the doctor’s eyes.
“John, if you want to go, you don’t need to explain anything. Simply go”.
"Of course he likes it. He only pretends not. He enjoyed a lot preparing my birthday".
He didn't know what surprised him more. That their mother had a castle or that they were both going to use it for deception.
“Don’t blame me. It was you who started doing this in my blog” the doctor chuckled.
The man opened his eyes, hoped. Sherlock smiled for himself.
"No. It was a long time ago" John rubbed his head,
The detective's tongue went down to the right nipple and lapped it. John closed his eyes and groaned softly.
Mycroft sighed.
Standing with his legs open on both sides of Sherlock's waist, he stuck his fingers into the shorts' elastic and, swinging his hips slowly and provocatively, slowly lowered them, letting his semi-erect cock appear. The vision made the detective's mouth water. He was nervous at the prospect of fucking John. He wanted to do it right, make him feel as good as John made him feel. And he could tell that John was, too. As he dropped his shorts down his legs, he looked sideways at Sherlock's hard, erect cock, which, though not as big and impressive as his, was also threatening.
"You twat..."
"That's what kidnapped Everett," intervened Sherlock.
Mycroft shook his head.
"You're the biggest idiot I have ever met after Sherlock. No, I think even more than Sherlock, since you are smarter".
"Thanks, Lestrade."
The detective scowled at him surprised by the DI's smug and jocular tone. A few seconds later, his mouth dropped, and he stared at the DI, annoyed and in awe.
Mycroft turned to the group around them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Little by little, they managed to clear the place of them.
“What are you going to do? Killing me?”
"Tell them to stop."
"Go away," he asked.
“John,” the whispered groan of the doctor’s name surprised both men again. The detective was wanking while having a fantasy with his flatmate. A flatmate, on the other hand, whose story of sexual life surely wouldn’t include an asexual freak, moreover being not gay.
He was so embedded in his anger that he didn’t hear the knocks, bumps, racing footsteps and yells behind him.
Stephen nodded.
"I can shoot with my left hand better than you can with both," he grunted, extending it.
"Impossible. He couldn't push a motorbike like that in the sand. Sooner or later, he had to get it started. How come nobody heard anything?" asked Mark.
